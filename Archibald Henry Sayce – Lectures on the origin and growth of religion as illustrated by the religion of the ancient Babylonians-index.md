PREFACE.
A word of apology is needed for the numerous repetitions
in the following chapters, which are due to the fact that the
chapters were written and delivered in the form of Lectures.
I cannot guarantee the exactness of every word in the trans
lations of the cuneiform texts given in them. The meaning of
individual words may at times be more precisely defined by the
discovery of fuller materials, even where it has been supposed
that their signification has been fixed with certainty. The same
fate has befallen the interpretation of the Hebrew Scriptures,
and is still more likely to befall a progressive study like
Assyrian.
How rapidly progressive the latter is, may be gathered from
the number of contributions ^ to our knowledge of Babylonian
religion made sincb the following Lectures were in the hands of
the printer. Prof. Tiele, in a Paper entitled, " De Beteekenis
van Ea en zijn Verhouding tot Maruduk en Nabu," has tried to
show that Ea was originally connected with the fire ; Mr. Pinches
has published a late Babylonian text in the Babylonian Record,
from which it appears that the esrd, or " tithe," was paid to the
temple of the Sun-god not only by individuals, but also by
towns ; and Dr. Jensen, in the Zeitschrift fur Assyriologic (ii. 1),
has made it probable that the azkaru of the hymn translated on
pp. 68, 69, was the feast of the new moon.

THE
RELIGION OF THE ANCIENT BABYLONIANS.
Lecture I.
INTRODUCTORY.
It was with considerable diffidence that I accepted the
invitation of the Hibbert Trustees to give a course of
Lectures on the Religion of the Ancient Babylonians.
The subject itself is new ; the materials for treating it
are still scanty and defective ; and the workers in the
field have been few. The religion of the Babylonians
has, it is true, already attracted the attention of "the
Father of Assyriology," Sir Henry Rawlinson, of the brilliant and gifted Francois Lenormant, of the eminent
Dutch scholar Dr. Tiele, and of Dr. Fritz Hommel, one
of the ablest of the younger band of Assyrian students ;
but no attempt has yet been made to trace its origin and
history in a systematic manner. The attempt, indeed,
is full of difficulty. We have to build up a fabric out
of broken and half-deciphered texts, out of stray allusions and obscure references, out of monuments many
of which are late and still more are of uncertain age.
If, therefore, my account of Babylonian religion may E

seem to you incomplete, if I am compelled at times to
break off in my story or to have recourse to conjecture,
T must crave your indulgence and ask you to remember
the difficulties of the task. To open up new ground is
never an easy matter, more especially when the field of
research is vast ; and a new discovery may at any
moment overthrow the theories we have formed, or give
a new complexion to received facts.
I may as well confess at the outset that had I known
all the difficulties I was about to meet with, I should never
have had the courage to face them. It was not until I
was committed beyond the power of withdrawal that I
began fully to realise how great they were. Unlike
thos" who have addressed you before in this place, I
have had to work upon materials at once deficient and
fragmentary. Mine has not been the pleasant labour of
marshalling well-ascertained facts in order, or of select
ing and arranging masses of material, the very abundance
of which has alone caused embarrassment. On the con
trary. 1 have had to make most of my bricks without
straw. Here and there, indeed, parts of the subject have
been lighted up in a way that left little to be desired,
but elsewhere 1 have had to struggle on in thick dark
ness or al most in dim twilight. I have felt as in a
forest where the moon shone at times through open
spaces in the thick foliage, but served onlv to make the
surrounding -loom .-till more apparent, and where I
had to search in vain tor a '• 1 >-e that would lead me from
one interval of light to another.
The sources of our information about the religion of
u. . an !K m Babylonians aud their kinsfolk the Assyrians
arc almost wholly monumental. Beyond a few strav



INTRODUCTORY. 3
notices in the Old Testament, and certain statements
found in classical authors which are for the most part
the offspring of Greek imagination, our knowledge con
cerning it is derived from the long-buried records of
Nineveh and Babylon. It is from the sculptures that
lined the walls of the Assyrian palaces, from the inscrip
tions that ran across them, or from the clay tablets that
were stored within the libraries of the great cities, that
we must collect our materials and deduce our theories.
Tradition is mute, or almost so ; between the old Baby
lonian world and our own a deep gulf yawns, across
which we have to build a bridge by the help of texts
that explorers have disinterred and scholars have pain
fully deciphered. But the study of these texts is one
of no ordinary difficulty. They are written in characters
that were once pictorial, like the hieroglyphs of Egypt, and were intended to express the sounds of a language
wholly different from that of the Semitic Babylonians
and Assyrians, from whom most of our inscriptions come.
The result of these two facts was two-fold. On the one
hand, every character had more than one value when
used phonetically to denote a syllable ; on the other
hand, every character could be employed ideographically
to represent an object or idea. And just as simple ideas
could thus be represented by single characters, so compound ideas could be represented by a combination of
characters. In the language of the primitive inhabitants
of Babylonia, the world beyond the grave was known as
Arali, and was imaged as a dark subterranean region
where the spirits of the dead kept watch over hoards
of unnumbered gold. But the word Arali was not
written phonetically, nor was it denoted by a single
u2



4 LECTURE I.
ideograph; the old Chaldean chose rather to represent
it by three separate characters which would literally
mean "the house of the land of death."
When the Babylonians or Assyrians desired that what
they wrote should be read easily, they adopted devices
which enabled them to overcome the cumbersome obscur
ity of their system of writing. A historical inscription,
for example, may be read with little difficulty ; it is
only our ignorance of the signification of particular words which is likely to cause us trouble in deciphering
its meaning. But when we come to deal with a reli
gious text, the case is altogether different. Eeligion
has always loved to cloak itself in mystery, and a priest
hood is notoriously averse from revealing in plain language the secrets of which it believes itself the possessor.
To the exoteric world it speaks in parables ; the people
that knoweth not the law is accursed. The priesthood
of Babylonia formed no exception to the general rule.
A- we shall see, it was a priesthood at once powerful
and highly organised, the parallel of which can hardly
be found in the ancient world. We need not wonder,
therefore, if a considerable portion of the sacred texts
which it lias bequeathed to us were intentionally made
difficult of interpretation ; if the words of which they
consisted were expressed by ideographs rather than writ
"•i' phonetically; if characters were used with strange
and far-fetched values, and the true pronunciation of
divine names was carefully hidden from the uninitiated multitude.
But these are not all the difficulties that beset us
when we endeavour to penetrate into the meaning of the
religious texts. I have already said that the cuneiform



INTRODUCTORY. £>
system of writing was not the invention, but the heritage,
of the Semitic Babylonians and Assyrians. The Semites
of the historical period, those subjects of Sennacherib
and Nebuchadnezzar who were so closely allied in blood
and language to the Hebrews, were not the first occu
pants of the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates. They had been preceded by a population which in default of
a better name I shall term Accadian or Proto-Chaldean
throughout these Lectures, and which was in no wise
related to them. The Accadians spoke an agglutinative
language, a language, that is to say, which resembled in
its structure the languages of the modern Finns or
Turks, and their physiological features, so far as we can trace them from the few monuments of the Accadian
epoch that remain, differed very markedly from those of the Semites. It was to the Accadians that the begin
nings of Chaldean culture and civilisation were due.
They were the teachers and masters of the Semites, not
only in the matter of writing and literature, but in other
elements of culture as well. This is a fact so startling,
so contrary to preconceived ideas, that it was long refused credence by the leading Orientalists of Europe
who had not occupied themselves with cuneiform studies.
Even to-day there are scholars, and notably one who has himself achieved success in Assyrian research, who
still refuse to believe that Babylonian civilisation was
originally the creation of a race which has long since
fallen into the rear rank of human progress. But un
less the fact is admitted, it is impossible to explain the origin either of the cuneiform system of writing or of
that system of theology the outlines of which I have
undertaken to expound.



6 LECTURE I.
II. iv. then, ifl one of the difficulties against which the
student of Babylonian religion has to contend. We have to distinguish the Accadian and the Semitic ele
ments which enter into it, as well as the mixture which
the meeting of those elements brought about. We have
to determine what texts are Accadian, what are Semitic,
what, finally, are due to a syncretic admixture of the two.
What makes the task one of more than ordinary difficulty
is the tact that, like Latin in the Middle Ages, the dead
or dying Accadian became a sacred language among the
Semitic priesthood of a later period. Not only was it
considered necessary to the right performance of the ritual that genuinely old Accadian texts should be
recited in their original language and with a correct
pronunciation, but new texts were composed in the extinct idiom of Accad which bore the same linguistic
relation to the older ones as the Latin compositions of
tho mediaeval monks bear to the works of the Latin
fathers. Unfortunately, in the present state of our
knowledge, it is sometimes impossible to tell to which of
these two classes of texts a document belongs, and yet
upon the right determination of the question may depend
also the right determination of the development of Baby
lonian religion.
The A* cadian olcinent in this religion is productive
ofyel (mother difficulty. As Ave shall see, a large proportion of the deities of the Babylonian faith had their
firel origin in the beliefs of the Accadian people. The
names by which they were addressed, however, were
usually written ideographically, not phonetically, after the fashion of the Accadian scribes, and the reading of
these oames is consequently often uncertain. Even if a



INTRODUCTORY. 7
gloss happens to inform us of the correct reading of one
of these names, it by no means follows that we thereby
know how to read its later Semitic equivalent. The
Semites continued to represent the names of the gods by
the same ideographs that had been used by their Acca
dian predecessors, but in most cases they naturally gave them a different pronunciation. Even now,, when the
study of Assyrian has so for advanced that the Hebrew
lexicographer is able to call in its help in determining
the meaning of Hebrew words, and when an ordinary historical inscription can be read with almost as much
facility as a page of the Old Testament, we are still ignorant of the true name of one of the chief Assyrian
divinities. The name of Adar, commonly assigned by
Ass3'riologists to the Assyrian war-god, has little else to rest upon except the fact that Adrammelech or "king
Adar" was the divinity in whose honour the men of
Scpharvaim burnt their children in the fire, according
to the second book of Kings (xvii. 31). 1 And yet the
name is one which not only constantly occurs in the
Assyrian inscriptions, but also enters into the name of
more than one Assyrian king. Can there be a better
illustration of the difficulties which surround the student
1 Lehinann (De lnscriptiuuibus cuneatis quce pertinent ad Samasginn-ukin, p. 47) lias made it probable that Adrammelech represents the goddess Adar-malkat, "Adar the queen," who seems to be identified
with A or Anunit, the goddess "of births" (Jcune, W.A.I, ii. 57, 14),
and to correspond to the Semitic, goddess Erua, "the begetter." In this case the name of Sennacherib's son, Adrammelech, must be con sidered to be corrupt. Erua, however, would be an Aramaic and not
a Babylonian form, if it is a Semitic word; the Babylonian is Eritu, which is given in K4195, 6, as a name of Istar. In W. A. I. ii. 54, GO, and S 1720, 2, Eru, "the handmaiden" (W. A. I. v. 19, 43), is an Acoadian title of Zarpanit,



8 LKCTFRE I.
of Babylonian religion, as well as of the extent to which
he is deserted hy classical tradition ?
Aj3 with the name which we provisionally read Adar,
so also is it with the name which we provisionally read
( i isdhubar. Gisdhubar was the hero of the great Chaldean
epic, into the eleventh book of which was woven the
Btory of the Deluge; he had been the fire-god of the
Arcadians before he became the solar hero of Semitic
legend ; and there are grounds for thinking that Mr.
George Smith was right in seeing in him the prototype of the Biblical Ximrod. Nevertheless, the only certain
fact about his name is that it ended in the sound of r.
That it was not Gisdhubar or Izdubar, however, is
almost equally certain. This would be merely the pho
netic reading of the three ideographs which compose the name, and characters when used as ideographs were
naturally not read phonetically. 1 I have not yet finished my enumeration of the diffi
culties and obstacles that meet the inquirer into the
nature and history of Babylonian religion on the very threshold of his researches. The worst has still to be
mentioned. AVith the exception of the historical inscrip
tions which adorned the sculptured slabs of the Assyrian
1 Hommel (Proc Snr. Bib. Arch. Ap. 1866, p. 119) believes that he
has found the true reading of the name, and a proof of its correspondwith the Semitic Nimrod, in W.A.I, iv. 2. 21, 22., 23. 3. 26, 27, where the Semitic Namratsit answers to the name of an Accadian
divinity which may be read Gi isdu-par-ru or Gis-du-par-ra, But from 8 949, Obv. 6, where the Sun-god is called Ml namratsit, it is clear
that namratsit \> merely personified difficulty, being the feminine of the common adjective namratsu, "difficult." The Accadian divinity, therefore, is the goddess of difficulty, and can have no connection with
a male Fire-god. Her name should probably be read Gi-ib-bir-ra, a derivative from gib, the Accadian form of gig, "difficult."

palaces or were inscribed on clay cylinders buried at the
angles of a royal building, our documentary materials consist entirely of clay tablets covered with minute characters.
In Assyria, the tablets were baked in the kiln after beiug
inscribed ; for this purpose holes were made in the clay
to allow the escape of superfluous moisture, and the fear of fracture prevented the tablets from being of a great
size. In the more southern climate of Babylonia, the
tablets were generally dried in the sun, the result being
the disintegration of the clay in the course of centuries, the surface of the brick being sometimes reduced to
powder, while at other times the whole brick has been
shivered into atoms. But apart from the records of
" the banking firm" of the Egibi family, which carried on
its business from the time of Nebuchadnezzar and his
predecessors to that of Darius Hystaspis, we possess as yet comparatively few of the tablets that once stocked
the libraries of Babylonia and must still be lying buried
beneath the ground. The main bulk of our collection
comes from the great library of Nineveh, which occupied
one of the upper rooms in the palace of Assur-bani-pal at Kouyunjik. It stood within the precincts of the
temple of Nebo, 1 and its walls were lined with shelves,
on which were laid the clay books of Assyria or the rolls
of papyrus which have long since perished.2 The library

The bit namari, or "observatory," on the contrary, was the "tower" of the temple of Istar, whose construction and dimensions are described
in an interesting but unfortunately mutilated text (S 1894). Its breadth, we are told, was 154^ cubits.

consisted for the most part of copies or editions of older
works that had been brought from Babylonia, and dili
gently copied by numerous scribes, like the "proverbs of
S lomon which the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah, copied out." 1 The library had been transferred from
( lalah by Sennacherib towards the latter part of his
reign, 2 but the larger portion of the collection was got
together by Assur-bani-pal, the son of Esar-haddon, and
the Sardanapallos of the Greeks. He was the first,
indeed we may say the only, Assyrian monarch who
really eared for literature and learning. His predecessors
had been men of war; if they established libraries, it
was only from imitation of their more cultivated neisrh
hours iii Babylonia, and a desire to remain on good
terms with the powerful classes of scribes and priests.
Bui Assur-bani-pal, with all his luxury and love of dis
play —or perhaps by reason of it —was a genuine lover
of books. When rebellion had been quelled in Baby
lonia, and the Babylonian cities had been taken by storm,
the spoil thai was most acceptable to the Assyrian king
were the written volumes that their libraries contained.

Xcbo-zuqnb-yukin, who was chief librarian from the Gth year of Bl< 716) to the 22nd year of Sennacherib (B.C. 684), does not seem to have quitted Calah. So far as we know, the first work written under his direction had been a copy of a text of the standard
work on astrology, "The [Humiliation of Bel," which had been brought from Babylon t> the library at Calah.



INTRODUCTORY. 11
No present could be sent him which he valued more
than some old text from Erech or Ur or Babylon. But
naturally it was the works which related to Assyria, or
to the special studies of its royal masters, that were most
sought after. The Assyrian cared little for the annalistic
records of the Babylonian kings, or for the myths and
legends which enveloped the childhood of the Babylonian cities and contained no reference to things Assyrian ; it
was only where the interest of the story extended beyond
the frontiers of Babylonia, or where the religious texts
held a place in the ritual of the Assyrian priesthood, that it was thought worth while to transport them to a
northern home. If the theology was Assyrian as well
as Babylonian, or if a legend was as popular in Assyria
as it had been in Babylonia, or if, finally, a branch of
study had a special attraction for Assyrian readers, the works embodying these subjects were transferred
to the library of Nineveh, and there re-edited by the
Assyrian scribes. Hence it is that certain sides of the
old theology are represented so fully in Assyrian litera
ture, while other sides are not represented at all ; hence,
too, it is that the drawers of the British Museum are
filled with tablets on the pseudo-science of omens which
have little save a philological importance attaching to them.
The library was open, it would seem, to all comers, and Assur-bani-pal did his utmost to attract "readers"
to the "inspection" and study of the books it contained.
But the literary age of Assyria was short-lived. Even
before Assur-bani-pal died, the mighty empire he had
inherited was tottering to its fall. Egypt had been lost
to it for ever j Babylonia was clamouring for indepen

dence; and the semi-barbarous nations of the north and
easl were threatening its borders. Ere the century
olosed, Nineveh was taken by its enemies, and its palaces
sacked and destroyed. The library of Ivouyunjik shared in the common over
threw Its papyri and leathern scrolls were burned
with fire, and its clay books fell in shattered confusion
among the ruins below. There they lay for more than
two thousand years, covered by the friendly dust of de
caying bricks, until Sir A. H. Layard discovered the
old library and revealed its contents to the world of
to-day. His excavations have been followed by those of
Mr. George Smith and Mr. Hormuzd Eassam, and the
greater portion of Assur-bani-pal's library is now in the
British Museum. It is out of its age-worn fragments
that the story I have to tell in this course of Lectures
has been mainly put together.
Bui the sketch I have given of its history is sufficient
to show how hard such a task must necessarily be. In
the first place, the library of Nineveh was only one of
the many libraries which once existed in the cities of
Assyria mid Babylonia. Its founders never aimed at
completeness, or intended to deposit in it more than a
portion of the ancient literature of Babylonia. Then,
further, even this literature was not always copied in
full. From time to time the text is broken off, and the
words "lacuna" or "recent fracture" appear upon the
tabid. The original text, it is clear, was not perfect; the tablet which was copied had been injured, and was
thus no longer legible throughout. Such indications,
however, of the faultiness of the editio princeps are a
good proof that the Assyrian scribes did their best to



INTRODUCTORY. 13
reproduce it with accuracy, and that if they failed to do
so it was through uo fault of their own. But they did
fail sometimes. The Babylonian forms of the cuneiform
characters are often hard to read, and there was no
standard official script in Babylonia such as there was in
Assyria. Education was not in the hands of a single
class, as was the case in the latter country ; most Baby
lonians could read and write, and consequently the forms
of handwriting found upon their monuments are almost
as numerous as in the modern world. Hence it is that
the Assyrian copyist sometimes mistook a Babylonian
character, and represented it by a wrong equivalent. The most serious result, however, of the fact that the
library of Nineveh mainly consisted of terra-cotta tablets,
broken and scattered in wild confusion when the city was
destroyed, still remains to be told. The larger propor
tion of the texts we have to use are imperfect. Many
of them are made up of small fragments, which have
been pieced together by the patient labour of the Assyrian scholars in the British Museum. In other cases,
only a fragment, not unfrequently a minute fragment,
of a text has been preserved. Often, therefore, we come across a text which would seem to throw an important
light on some department of Assyrian thought and life if only we had the clue to its meaning, but the text is
broken just where that clue would have been found.
This fragmentary character of our documents, in fact, is
not only tantalising to the student, but it may be the cause of serious error. Where we have only fragments
of a text, it is not impossible that we may wholly mis
conceive their relation and meaning, and so build theories
upon them which the discovery of the missing portions



14 LECTUBE I.
of the tablet would overthrow. This is especially the
case in the province of religion and mythology, where it
is so easy to put a false construction upon isolated pas
sages, the context of which must be supplied from con
jecture. We know from experience what strange inter
pretations have been imposed upon passages of the Bible that have been torn from their context; the student of
Babylonian religion must therefore be forgiven if the condition in which his materials have reached him should
at times lead him astray. Moreover, it must be remem
bered that the fragmentary condition of our texts makes
the work of the decipherer much harder than it would
otherwise be. A new word or an obscure phrase is often
made perfectly intelligible by the context; but where
this fails us3 all interpretation must necessarily be uncer
tain, if not impossible. There is yet another difficulty connected with our
needful dependence upon the broken tablets of Assur
bani-pal's library —a difficulty, however, that would not
be fell except by the student of Babylonian religion. None of the tablets that are derived from it are older
than the eighth century before our era; how then are
we to determine the relative ages of the various religious
or mythological documents which arc embodied in them ?
It is true that we are generally told to what library of
Babylonia the original text belonged, but we look in
a for any indication of date. And yet an approxi
mately accurate chronology is absolutely indispensable
for a history of religion and religious ideas. If, indeed,
we could explore the Babylonian libraries themselves, their would be a better chance of our discovcrinc; the
relative antiquity of the documents they may still con



INTRODUCTORY. 15
tain. But at present this is impossible, and except in a few instances we have to be content with the copies of
the older documents which were made by the Assyrian
scribes.
I am bound to confess that the difficulty is a very
formidable one. It was not until I had begun to test
the theories hitherto put forward regarding the develop
ment of Babylonian religion, and had tried to see what
could be fairly deduced from the texts themselves, that I
realised how formidable it actually was. There is only
one way of meeting it. It is only by a process of care
ful and cautious induction, by noting every indication of
date, whether linguistic or otherwise, which a text may
offer, by comparing our materials one with another, and calling in the help of what we have recently learnt about
Babylonian history—above all, by following the method of nature and science in working from the known to the
unknown—that it is possible to arrive at any conclusions
at all. If, therefore, I shall seem in the course of these
Lectures to speak less positively about the early develop
ment of Babylonian theology than my predecessors in the same field have done, or than I should have done
myself a few years ago, let it be borne in mind that the
fault lies not in mo but in the want of adequate materials.
It is useless to form theories which may be overthrown
at any moment, and which fail to explain all the known
facts.
So far, I fear, I have done little else than lay before
you a dreary catalogue of the difficulties and obstacles
that meet the historian of Babylonian religion at the
very outset of his inquiry. If the picture had no other
side, if there were little or nothing to counterbalance



16 LECTURE I.
the difficulties, we might as well admit that the time for
investigating the theological conceptions of the ancient
Babylonians and Assyrians had not yet come, and that we must be content to leave the subject where it was
left by Sir H. Bawlinson nearly thirty years ago. Fortunately, however, this is not the case. Mutilated and
broken as they are, we still have texts sufficient to
• liable us at all events to sketch the outlines of Baby
lonian theology—nay, from time to time to fill them in as
well. The Babylonians were not content with merely
editing their ritual and religious hymns or their myths about the gods and heroes ; they also compiled commen
taries and explanatory text-books which gave philological and other information about the older religious literature ;
they drew up lists of the deities and their various titles ;
they described the temples in which their images were
placed, and the relation of the different members of the
divine hierarchy one to another. They even showed an
interest in the gods of other countries, and the names
given by neighbouring nations to divinities which they
identified with their own are at times recorded. It is
true that many of the sacred texts were so written as to
be intelligible only to the initiated; but the initiated
were provided with keys and glosses, many of which are
in our hands. In some respects, therefore, we are better
nil' than the ordinary Babylonian himself would have
bo.n. We can penetrate into the real meaning of docu
ments which to him were a sealed book. Nay, more
than this. The researches that have been made during
the last half-century into the creeds and beliefs of the
nations of the world both past and present, have given
ns a clue to the interpretation of these documents which



INTRODUCTORY. 17
even the initiated priests did not possess. We can guess
at the origin and primary meaning of rites and cere
monies, of beliefs and myths, which the Babylonians knew of only in their later form and under their tradi
tional guise. To them, Gisdhubar, the hero of their great
epic, was but a champion and conqueror of old time,
whose deeds were performed on the soil of Babylonia,
and whose history was as real as that of the sovereigns
of their own day. "We, on the contrary, can penetrate beneath the myths which have grown up around his
name, and can discover in him the lineaments of a soiar
hero who was himself but the transformed descendant
of a humbler god of fire.
In spite, however, of the aids that have been provided
for the modern student among the relics of the great
library of Nineveh, his two chief difficulties still remain :
the fragmentary character of his materials and his igno
rance of the true chronology of the larger portion of them.
This last is the most serious difficulty of all, since
recent discoveries have so enlarged our ideas of the anti
quity of Babylonian civilisation, and have so revolutionised the views into which we had comfortably settled
down, that our conclusions on the development of Baby
lonian religion must be completely modified. At the risk,
therefore, of making this first Lecture a dull and unin
teresting one, and of seeming to wander from the subject upon which I have been called to speak, I must enter
into some details as to the early history of the population
among whom the religious system revealed to us by the
cuneiform inscriptions first originated and developed. Until very lately, Assyrian scholars had fancied that
the rise and early history of Babylonia could be already c

traced in its main outlines. By combining the state
ments of classical authors with the data furnished by
such early monuments as we possessed, a consistent scheme seemed to have been made out. About three
thousand years before our era, it was supposed, the
si nailer states which occupied the fertile plain of Baby
lonia were united into a single monarchy, the capital of
which was " Ur of the Chaldees," the modern Mugheir,
on the western side of the Euphrates. The whole country
was at this period under the domination of the Accadians,
though the Semitic nomad and trader were already
beginning to make their appearance. It was divided
into two provinces, the northern called Accad, and the
southern Sumer or Shinar. in which two separate, though
el- sely allied, dialects were spoken. Xow and again,
however, the two provinces were independent of one another, and there were even times when the smaller states
comprised in them successfully re-asserted their former
freedom. About 2000 B.C., the Accadian was gradually
superseded by the Semite, and before long the Accadian
language itself became extinct, remaining only as the sacred and learned language of religion and law. The
rise of Semitic supremacy was marked by the reigns of
Sargon I. mid his son jNT aram-Sin, who established theii
t at Accad, near Sippara, where they founded an
important library, and from whence they led military
expeditions as far westward as the Mediterranean Sea.
'I'hr overthrow of Sargon's dynasty, however, was soon
brought about through the conquest of Babylonia by Khammuragas, a Kosssean from the mountains of Elam.
llr made Babylon for the first time the capital ni the
country, and founded a dynasty whose ruie lasted for



INTRODUCTORY. 19
several centuries. Before the Kosssean conquest, the
Babylonian system of religion was already complete. It emanated from the primitive Accadian population,
though it was afterwards adopted and transformed by
their Semitic successors. It was originally Shamanistic,
like the native religions of the Siberians or Lapps.
The sorcerer took the place of the priest, magical incan
tations the place of a ritual, and innumerable spirits the
place of gods. By degrees, however, these earlier con
ceptions became modified ; a priesthood began to establish
itself; and as a necessary consequence some of the ele
mental spirits were raised to the rank of deities. The
old magical incantations, too, gave way to hymns in honour of the new gods, among whom the Sun-god was
specially prominent, and these hymns came in time to form a collection similar to that of the Hindu Eig-Yeda,
and were accounted equally sacred. This process of
religious development was assisted by the Semitic occu
pation of Babylonia. The Semites brought with them
new theological conceptions. With them the Sun-god, in his two-fold aspect of benefactor and destroyer, was
the supreme object of worship, all other deities being
resolvable into phases or attributes of the supreme Baal.
At his side stood his female double and reflection, the
goddess of fertility, who was found again under various
names and titles at the side of every other deity. The
union of these Semitic religious conceptions with the
developing creed of Accad produced a state-religion, watched over and directed by a powerful priesthood,
which continued more or less unaltered down to the
days of Nebuchadnezzar and his successors. It was this
6tate-religion that was carried by the Semitic Assyrians
c2

into their "homo on the banks of the Tigris, where it
underwent one or two modifications, in all essential
respects, however, remaining unchanged. Now there is much in this neat and self-consistent
account of Babylonian religion which rests on the autho
rity of the cuneiform documents, and about which there
fore there is no room for dispute. But the inferences
which have been drawn from the facts presented by these
cuneiform documents, as well as the general theory by
which the inferences have been compacted together into
a consistent whole, are, it must be remembered, inferences
and theory only. Owing to the fragmentary nature of
the evidence, it has been necessary to supplement the
deficiencies of the record by assumptions for which there
is no documentary testimony whatever. The dates which
form the skeleton, as it were, of the whole theory, have been derived from Greek and Latin writers. While
certain portions of the scheme have been definitely
acquired by science, since they embody monumental facts, other portions are destitute of any other foundation than
the combinatory powers of modern scholars. The scheme,
therefore, must be regarded as a mere working hypothesis, as one of those provisional theories which science is con
stantly compelled to put forward in order to co-ordinate
and combine the facts known at the time, but which
mnst give way to other hypotheses as new facts are dis
eovered which do not harmonise with the older expla
nations. It not unfreqnently happens that a hypothesis
which has Berved its purpose well enough by directing
research into a particular channel, and which after all is
xrtialty correct, may be overthrown by the discovery of
a single new fact. Such has been the fate of the theory



INTRODUCTORY. 21
as to the development of Babylonian religion which I have been describing above.
The single fact which has shaken it to its very founda
tions is the discovery of the date to which the reign of
Sargon of Accad must be assigned. The last king of
of Babylonia, ISabonidos, had antiquarian tastes, and busied himself not only with the restoration of the old
temples of his country, but also with the disinterment of
the memorial cylinders which their builders and restorers
had buried beneath their foundations. It was known
that the great temple of the Sun-god at Sippara, where the mounds of Abu-Habba now mark its remains, had
been originally erected by Naram-Sin the son of Sargon,
and attempts had been already made to find the records
which, it was assumed, he had entombed under its
angles. With true antiquarian zeal, Nabonidos continued
the search, and did not desist until, like the Dean and
Chapter of some modern cathedral, he had lighted upon "the foundation-stone" of Naram-Sin himself. This
"foundation-stone," he tells us, had been seen by none
of his predecessors for 3200 years. In the opinion,
accordingly, of Nabonidos, a king who was curious about
the past history of his country, and whose royal position
gave him the best possible opportunities for learning all that could be known about it, Naram-Sin and his
father Sargon I. lived 3200 years before his own time,
or 3750 B.C.
The date is so remote and so contrary to all our pre
conceived ideas regarding the antiquity of the Babylonian,
monarchy, that I may be excused if at first I expressed
doubts as to its accuracy. "We are now accustomed to
contemplate with equanimity the long chronology which



22 LECTURE I.
the monuments demand for the history of Pharaonic
Egypt, but we had also been accustomed to regard the
history of Babylonia as beginning at the earliest in the third millennium before our era. Assyrian scholars had
inherited the chronological prejudices of a former genera
tion, and a starveling chronology seemed to be confirmed
by the statements of Greek writers.
I was, however, soon forced to re-consider the reasons
of my scepticism. The cylinder on which Kabonidos
recounts his discovery of the foundation-stone of Naram
Sin was brought from the excavations of Mr. Hormuzd
Rassam in Babylonia, and explained by Mr. Pinches six
years ago. Soon afterwards, Mr. Pinches was fortunate
enough to find among some other inscriptions from Babylonia fragments of three different lists, in one of which
the kings of Babylonia were arranged in dynasties, and
the number of years each king reigned was stated, as
well as the number of years the several dynasties lasted.
An Assyrian copy of a similar list had been already dis
covered by Mr. George Smith, who, with his usual quickness of perception, saw that it must have resembled the
lists from which Berossos, the Greek historian of Chaldsea,
drew the materials of his chronology; but the copy was
so mere ;i fragment that the chronological position of the
kings mentioned upon it was a matter of dispute. Hap
pily this is not the case with the principal text published
by Mr. Pinches. It had been compiled by a native of
Babylon, who consequently began with the first dynasty
which made Babylon the capital of the kingdom, and who Mrni> to have flourished in the time of Nabonidos.
We can check the accuracy of his statements in a some
what curious way. One of the two other texts brought



INTRODUCTORY. 23
to light by Mr. Pinches is a schoolboy's exercise copy of
the first two dynasties mentioned on the annalistic tablet.
There are certain variations between the two texts, how
ever, which show that the schoolboy or his master must
have used some other list of the early kings than that
which was employed by the compiler of the tablet;
nevertheless, the names and the regnal years, with one
exception, agree exactly in each. In Assyria, an accurate
chronology was kept by means of certain officers, the
so-called Eponyms, who were changed every year and gave their names to the year over which they presided.
We have at present no positive proof that the years were dated in the same way in Babylonia ; but since most
Assyrian institutions were of Babylonian origin, it is probable that they were. At all events, the scribes of a
later day believed that they had trustworthy chrono
logical evidence extending back into a dim antiquity ; and when we remember the imperishable character of
the clay literature of the country, and the fact that the
British Museum actually contains deeds and other legal
documents dated in the reign of Khammuragas, more
than four thousand years ago, there is no reason why
we should not consider the belief to have been justified.
Now the annalistic tablet takes us back reign by reign,
dynasty by dynasty, to about the year 2400 B.C. Among
the monarchs mentioned upon it is Khammuragas. whose
reign is placed 112 years later (B.C. 2200). 1 Of Sargon
1 As the reign of Khammuragas lasted 55 years, its end would have been about B.C. 2235. This curiously agrees with the date arrived at
(first by von Gutschmidt) for the beginning of the Babylonian era. If the Latin translation can lie trusted (Simplicius, ad ArUt. do Coolo, 503 A), the astronomical observations sent by Kallisthenes from Babylon to Aristotle in B.C. 331 reached back for 1903 years (i.e. to B.C. 2234).



24 LECTURE I.
and his son Naram-Siii, however, there is no trace. But
this is not all. On the shelves of the British Museum
vou may see huge sun-dried bricks, on which are stamped
the names and titles of kings who erected or repaired
the temples where they have been found. In the dynasties
i »f the annalistic tablet their names are as much absent
;i- is the name of Sargon. They must have belonged to
an earlier period than that with which the list of the
tablet begins, and have reigned before the time when,
according to the margins of our Bibles, the flood of Xoah
was covering the earth, and reducing such bricks as
these to their primaeval slime. But the kings who have
recorded their constructive operations on the bricks are
seldom connected with one another. They are rather
the isolated links of a broken chain, and thus presup
]Mise a long period of time during which their reigns must have fallen. This conclusion is verified by another
document, also coming from Babylonia and also first published by Mr. Pinches. This document contains a
very long catalogue of royal names, not chronologically
arranged, as is expressly stated, but drawn up for a
philological purpose — that of explaining in Assyrian the Accadian and Kossa?an names of the non-Semitic
rulers of Babylonia. Though the document is imperfect
Ilrrossos, according to Pliny (X. H. vii. 57), stated that these observations began at Babylon 490 years before the Greek era of Phoroneus
B.I '. L753), i.e. B.C. 2243, though Epigenes made it 720 years (B.C. 2473). Babylon, according to Stephanos of Byzantium (s. v.), was built 1002 years before the date (given by Hellanikos) for the siege of Troy (RC. 1229), which would bring us to B.C. 2231, while Ktesias
(ap. < reorg. 8ynk.) made the reign of Beloa, or Bel-Merodaeh of Babylon, last lor 55 years from B.C. 2286 to 2231. The correspondence of the reign of the BSlos of KtOsias with the reign of Khammuragas is at least curious.



INTRODUCTOBY. 25
it embodies about sixty names which do not occur on
the annalistic tablet, and must therefore be referred to
an earlier epoch than that with which the latter begins.
But these names, like the majority of those stamped
on the bricks from the ancient temples, are not of Semitic
but of Accadian origin. If, then, the Accadian domina
tion preceded the rule of the Semitic Babylonians, the
long array of sovereigns to whom they belonged must have reigned before the age of the Semitic rulers of
Accad, Sargon and Naram-Sin. This, however, is a conclusion from Avhich the historian will needs recoil. The
long space of 1300 years which intervened between the
time of Sargon and that of the dynasty of Khammuragas cannot have been wholly filled with Semitic princes who
have left no monument behind them. We seem com
pelled to acknowledge that the Semitic rule in Babylonia was not achieved once for all. The struggle between
the older and younger population of the country was not determined by a single battle or a single reign. The
dynasty which followed that of Khammuragas bears for
the most part Accadian names, and may therefore be
regarded as marking an Accadian revival. Before the
age of Khammuragas the same event may have often
happened. Now it was a dynasty sprung from a Semitic
settlement that acquired the supremacy in Babylonia; at other times the ruler of a city which still held out
against the Semite succeeded in establishing his pi/wer
over the whole country. In the dynastic tablet the
immediate predecessor of Khammuragas is a Semite
bearing the Semitic name of Sin-muballidh, and yet we
learn from the inscriptions of Khammuragas himself that
he had made himself master of Chaldsea bv the overthrow

of the Ar.adian prince Eim-Agu. Moreover, whatever might have been the original character of the Semitic
occupation of Babylonia, from the time of Sargon I. downwards it was of a more or less peaceable nature;
Accadiana and Semites mingled together, and from the
mixture sprang the peculiar civilisation of Babylonia,
and the peculiar typo of its people. Sargon himself was a monarch whom both Accadian
and Semite delighted to honour. Myths surrounded his
infancy as they surrounded the infancy of Kyros, and
popular legend saw in him the hero-prince who had been deserted in childhood and brought up among squalid
surroundings, until the time came that he should declare
himself in his true character and receive his rightful
inheritance. 1 He was born, it was said, of an unknown
1 Sargon may be the Thilgamos of iElian, transmitted in a Persian
dn bs, and the legend aboul him is evidently that connected by Agathias
(ii. 25, 15) with Beletares (>. Tiglath-Pileser), who is stated to have been the gardener of the former king, Belokhos or Beleous, and the founder of a new dynasty. In the Epic of Gisdhubar the name of the
gardener wooed by Istar is given as Isullanu the gardener of Anu.

father; as Mars had wooed the mother of the founder of
Rome, so some god whom later tradition feared to name
had wooed the mother of the founder of the first Semitic
empire. She brought forth her first-born "in a secret
place" by the side of the Euphrates, and placed him in a basket of rushes which she daubed with bitumen and
entrusted to the waters of the river. The story reminds
us of Perseus launched upon the sea with his mother
Danae in a boat, of Romulus and Remus exposed to the
fury of the Tiber, and still more of Moses in his ark of
bulrushes upon the Nile. The Euphrates refused to
drown its future lord, and bore the child in safety to

A.a In' grew older he was set to till the garden and culti
vate the fruit-trees, and while engaged in this humble
work attracted the love of the goddess Istar. Then came
the hour of his deliverance from servile employment, and,
like David, he made his way to a throne. For long years
he ruled the black-headed race of Accad ; he rode through
subjugated countries in chariots of bronze, and crossed
the Persian Gulf to the sacred isle of Dilmun. The very
name the people gave him was a proof of his predestined
rise to greatness. Sargon was not his real title. This
Mas Sarganu, which a slight change of pronunciation
altered into Sargina, a word that conveyed the meaning
of "constituted" or "predestined" "king" to his Acca
diau subjects. It was the form assumed in their mouths
by the Semitic Sami-kimi, and thus reminded them of
the Sun-god Tammuz, the youthful bridegroom of Istar, who was addressed as ablu kinu or "only son," as well
as of Nebo " the very son" (ablu kinu) of the god Mero
dach.1 Sargina, however, was not the only name by
which the king was known to them. They called him
also Dddil or Dddal, a title which the Semitic scribes
afterwards explained to mean "Sargon, the king of
ei ostituted right (sar-kinti), deviser of constituted law,
deviser of prosperity," though its true signification was rather "the very wise." 2

But in spite of the atmosphere of myth which came
to enshroud him, as it enshrouded the persons of Kyros,
of Charlemagne, and of other heroes of popular history, Sargon was a historical monarch and the founder of a
really great empire. The British Museum actually possesses an inscribed egg of veined marble which he dedi
cated to the Sun-god of Sippara, and the seal of his
librarian Ibni-sarru is in the hands of M. Le Clercq of
Paris. What may be termed the scientific literature of
the library of Nineveh makes frequent reference to
him, and we learn that it was for the great library
which he established in his capital city of Accad that
the two standard Babylonian works on astronomy and
terrestrial omens were originally compiled. The work
on astronomy was entitled "The Observations of Bel," 1
and consisted of no less than seventy-two books, deal
ing with such matters as the conjunction of the sun
and moon, the phases of Venus, and the appearances of comets. It was translated in later days into Greek
by the historian Berossos; and though supplemented by numerous additions in its passage through the hands
of generations of Babylonian astronomers, the original
When applied to Sargon, the title was ideographically expressed by repeating the character for "king," in order to denote that he was "the king indeed." One of the earliest of the monarchs whose names
are found at Tel-loh is called Taltal-kur-galla, " the wise one of the great mountain."
2 Or perhaps " The Illumination of Bel (Mul-lil)," Namar-Bili. See
my paper on " The Astronomy and Astrology of the Babylonians," in the Tr. Soc. Bib. Arch. iii. 1 (1874). Later copyists mistook the title
for a proper name, and accordingly referred the compilation of the work to a certain Namar-Bili. Up to the time of Berossos, however, it was remembered that the god Bel himself was its traditional author, and the
work is sometimes quoted as simply "Bel" (e.g. W. A. I. iii. 52, 27).

work contained so many records of eclipses as to demon.
Btrate the antiquity of Babylonian astronomy even in the remote age of Sargon himself. But besides our
knowledge of Sargon's patronage of learning, we also
know something about the civil history of his reign. A
copy of its annals has come down to us. We gather
from these that he was not only successful in overthrow
ing all opposition at home, he was also equally successful
abroad. His first campaign was against the powerful kingdom of Elaro in the East, where he overthrew the
enemy and mutilated their slain. Next he turned to
the \V«st. laying his yoke on Syria, and subjugating '•the four quarters" of the world. Then the rival kings
<>f Babylon and other Chaldsean cities felt his power;
and ont of the spoil of the vanquished he built the city
« . 1 Aocad and gave it its name. From this time forward
his attention was chiefly devoted to the West. Year after
\. ar he penetrated into Syria, until at last, we are told,
" he had neither equal nor rival; " he crossed the Mediter
ranean to the island Ave now call Cyprus, and "in the
third year.'' at the bounds of the setting sun, his hands
conquered all peoples and his mouth decreed a single
empire. 1 1 ere on the shores of Cyprus the great conqueror erected images of himself, and then carried the booty of
the island to the opposite coast of Asia. Such a glimpse
into the history of what became afterwards a Grecian
:. when a- yet no Greeks had made their way to their
later home, is startling to those whose conceptions of authentic history have been limited by the narrow horizon
oi the classical world. Its trustworthiness, however, has
been curiously verified by a discovery made by General
de Cesnola in the treasure-vaults of a Kyprian temple



INTRODUCTORY. 31
among the ruins of the ancient Kurion. Here, among
other haematite cylinders of early Babylonian origin, he found one the first owner of which describes himself
as a "servant" or "worshipper" of " the deified Naram
Sin." 1 Naram-Sin was the son and successor of Sargon,
and it is not likely that he would have received divine
honours after the fall of the dynasty to which he belonged.
The fact that the cylinder was discovered in Cyprus
seems to show that even after Sargon's death a connec
tion continued to exist between Cyprus and the imperial
power of Babylonia. Naram-Sin, however, was more bent
on the conquest of Magana, or the Sinaitic Peninsula,
than upon further campaigns in the West. Sinai, with its
mines of turquoise and copper, had been a prize coveted
by the Egyptians ever since the age of the Third Dynasty,
and one of the first efforts of the rising rival power on
the banks of the Euphrates was to gain possession of the
same country. Naram-Sin, so runs the annalistic tablet,
"marched to the land of Magana; the land of Magana
he conquered, and overcame its king." The land of Magana was already known to the inha
bitants of Babylonia. 2 The earliest Chaldsean monuments
1 See my paper in the Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch. v. 2 (1877).
2 Oppert, Lenorniant and myself have long since shown that Magan originally denoted the Sinaitic peninsula, and Delattre has recently
made it clear (L'Asie occidental/') that Melukhkha, which is constantly associated with Magan, was the desert district immediately to the south of the AVadiel-'Arish. Assur-hani-pal transfers the name of Magan to the neighbouring land of lower Egypt, while Melukhkha is used for Ethiopia or Meroe by Sargon and his successors. The name of Magan, however, was probably used from the first in an extended sense, since
a list of reeds (W. A, I. v. 32. 64, 65) describes the ivppatu, or " papy

yet discovered are those which have been excavated at
Tel-loh in southern Chaldsea by a Frenchman, M. de
Barzec, and are now deposited in the Louvre. Some of
them go back almost to the very beginnings of Chaldfean
art and cuneiform writing. Indeed, the writing is hardly
yet cuneiform ; the primitive pictorial forms of many
of the characters are but thinly disguised, and the ver
tical direction they originally followed, like Chinese, is
still preserved. The language and art alike are Proto
Chaldeean : there is as yet no sign that the Semite was
in the land. Among the monuments are seated figures
carved out of stone. The stone in several instances is
diorite, a stone so hard that even the modern workman
may well despair of chiselling it into the lineaments of
the human form. Now an inscription traced upon one
of the figures tells us that the stone was brought from
tlie land of Magan. Already, therefore, before the time
of Sargon and the rise of Semitic supremacy and civil
isation, the peninsula of Sinai was not only known to the
by its having an Accadian name, gizt\ "the flowering reed" (borrowed by Semitic Babylonian under the form of ki&t). That Magan or
Magana was a mountainous country appears from a bilingual lrymn to Adar, which mentions "the mountain of Magana" (W. A. I. iv. 13, 16); and in W. A. I. ii. 51, 17, while Melukhkha is described as "the
country of turquoise," Magan is described as "the country of bronze." It is possible that the name of Magan or Magana is derived from
ma/ka, which signifies in old Egyptian " the turquoise" of the Sinaitic mines. In an early Babylonian geographical list ("W. A. I. iv. 38. 13, II. Magan and Melukhkha are associated with the Babylonian seaport of Eridu, which throws light on "the ships" of Magan and Melukhkha mentioned in AY. A. I. ii. 46. 6, 7, immediately after "the ships of 1 'ilnnin." The trading ships of Eridu would have touched first
at Dilmun, then at Magan, and finally at Melukhkha. For a Babylonian country cr mountain (I) of Magan, such as some scholars have dreamed of, there is not a particle of evidence.

inhabitants of Chaldeea, but blocks of stone were trans
ported from it to the stoneless plain of Babylonia, and
there made plastic under the hand of the sculptor. I
have already alluded to the fact that the quarries of Sinai
had been known to the Egyptians and worked by them
as early as the epoch of the Third Dynasty, some 6000
years ago. Is it more than a coincidence that one of
the most marvellous statues in the world, and the chief
ornament of the Museum of Bulaq, is a seated figure of
king Khephren of the Fourth Dynasty, carved out of
green diorite, like the statues of Tel-loh, and representing the monarch in almost the same attitude ? The Baby
lonian work is ruder than the Egyptian work, it is true ;
but if we place them side by side, it is hard to resist the
conviction that both belong to the same school of sculp
ture, and that the one is but a less skilful imitation of
the other. The conviction grows upon us when we find
that diorite is as foreign to the soil of Egypt as it is to
that of Babylonia, and that the standard of measurement
marked upon the plan of the city, which one of the
figures of Tel-loh holds upon his lap, is the sarao as
the standard of measurement of the Egyptian pyramid
builders—the kings of the fourth and two following
dynasties. 1 Egyptian research has independently arrived at the
conclusion that the pyramid-builders were at least as old
as the fourth millennium before the Christian era. The
great pyramids of Grizeh were in course of erection, the
hieroglyphic system of writing was already fully devc

Loped, Egypt itself was thoroughly organised and in the
enjoyment of a high culture and civilisation, at a time
when, according to Archbishop Usher's chronology, the world was being created. The discoveries at Tel-loh
have revealed to us a corresponding period in the history
of Babylonia, earlier considerably than the age of Sargon of Accad, in which we seem to find traces of contact
between Babylonia and the Egyptians of the Old Empire. It would even seem as if the conquests of Naram-Sin in
Sinai were due to the fall of the Sixth Dynasty and the
overthrow of the power of the old Egyptian empire.
For some centuries after that event Egypt is lost to
hi story, and its garrisons and miners in the Smaicic
peninsula must have been recalled to serve against
enemies nearer home.
If there is any truth in the arguments I have been
using, we may now, I think, accept with confidence the
date assigned to Sargon of Accad by Nabonidos, strange as it may appear to read of expeditions undertaken by
liabylonian kings against Cyprus and Sinai at so remote
;m epoch. Important results will follow from such a
conclusion for the history of Babylonian religion. We shall have time enough for the slow absorption of Acca
dian religious ideas into the uncultured Semitic mind,
for tlic gradual transformation they underwent, and for
the development of those later forms of belief and practice
to which the main bulk of our materials relate. We
can now trace in some measure the modes in which
.\<<a<]ian and Semite acted and re-acted upon one another,
as well as the chief periods at which the influence of the
one or of the other was at its height.
The monuments of Tel-loh carry us back to a pre*



INTRODUCTORY. 35
Semitic era. The deities they commemorate are Proto
Chaldajan, and we may gather from them some idea of
Proto-ChaldsDan religion in the heyday of its power.
Babylonia was still divided into a number of petty states,
which were, however, at times united for a while under
a single head, and each state had its own peculiar cult.
Gradually the encroaching Semite dispossessed the older
dynasties and came to form an upper class, first of soldiers
and traders, and then of priests also, throughout the land. It was in northern Babylonia probably that he made
his influence first felt. Here, at any rate, the kingdom
was founded which culminated in the brilliant reigns of
Sargon of Accad and his son Naram-Sin. Before this,
the old culture of the non-Semitic population had been
fully absorbed by the Semitic intruders. The intercourse
between the two races was already for the most part a
peaceful one. The great mass of the older people were
contented to till the ground, to irrigate the fields, and to
become the serfs of their Semitic lords. But inter-mar
riages must have often taken place ; members of the
same family bear sometimes Accadian, sometimes Semitic
names, and the same king, whether Accadian or Semite,
issues his edicts in both languages. The cuneiform
system of writing was handed on to the Semites while
still in an incomplete state. New values and meanings
were given to the signs, new characters and combinations
of characters were devised, and in writing Semitic words
the old ideographic usage of the Accadian script con
tinued to be imitated. The process was aided by the
patronage afforded to literature in the court of Sargon.
Here Semitic and Accadian scribes vied with one another
in compiling new texts and in making the old ones
d2



,°,6 LECTURE I.
accessible to Semitie learners. An artificial literary dia
lect sprang up, the basis of which was Semitic, but into
which Arcadian words and phrases were thrown pele
incle. By way of revenge, the Accadian texts which
emanated from the literati of the court were filled with
9 initio words and expressions. Sometimes they were
the work of Semites writing in a foreign language, some
times of Accadians who were living in an atmosphere
of Semitic life and thought.
What happened in the case of the language must have
happened also in the case of religion. We know that
many of the gods of the later Babylonian faith have
Accadian names, and that the ideas connected with them
betray a non-Semitic origin; we may therefore expect to
find Accadian religious conceptions accommodated to those
of the Semite, and Semitic conceptions so closely intertwined with Accadian beliefs as to make it impossible for
ns now to separate them. How far this is the case I
hope to point out in a future Lecture.
The fall of the dynasty of Sargon may have brought with it a temporary revival of Accadian supremacy. At
any rate, the Semitic element always remained strongest
in northern Babylonia: in southern Babylonia it seems
to me not impossible that one of the numerous dialects
of the eld language may have lingered down to the time
of Nebuchadnezzar or Nabonidos. Bnt even in northern
Babylonia the Semitic element was not pure. It mainly
represented the dominant class, and not the people as
well, as was the case in Assyria. The result is that the
Babylonian presents ns with a moral and intellectual
type which is not genuinely Semitic. To convince our
selves of this fact, it is only necessary to compare the



INTRODUCTORY. 37
Babylonian with his neighbour the Assyrian. The As
syrian has all the characteristics of the Semite. His
hooked nose and angular features proclaim his origin on
the physical side as unmistakably as his intensity, his ferocity, his love of trade and his nomadic habits pro
claim it on the moral side. The Babylonian, on the
other hand, was square-built and somewhat full-faced,
an agriculturist rather than a soldier, a scholar rather
than a trader. The intensity of religious belief which
marked the Assyrian was replaced in him by superstition, and the barbarities which the Assyrian perpetrated in
the name of Assur and loved to record in his inscriptions
were foreign to his nature. If the Assyrian was the
Eoman of the ancient East, the Babylonians were the
Chinese.
Nevertheless, the contrast of type displayed by the two nations must have been the growth of centuries, and
due to that absorption of one race by another of which
Ireland furnishes so familiar an example. The Semites
of Babylonia—the Babylonians, as I will henceforth call
them—and the Assyrians must once have been the same
people. Assyrian and Babylonian differ only as two English dialects differ, and are therefore known by the
common name of Assyrian ; and it was from Babylonia
that the Assyrians derived their system of writing, the
greater part of their literature, their religion and their laws. It is true that some of this may have been bor
rowed in later times when the two kingdoms existed
side by side, or when Babylonia became the appanage of its ruder but more warlike neighbour ; the main bulk,
however, like the language, must have been the heritage which the ancestors of Sennacherib and Sardanapallos



58 LECTURE I.
carried with thorn into their northern home. The reli
gions dt' Babylonia and Assyria must be treated together,
we shall find, indeed, that in certain particulars they
disagree ; hut these particulars form no portion of their
essential character; they are merely unessentials which
can he put aside without injury to our view of the main
facts.
But, it will be asked, what interest can the religions
of Baby Ionia and Assyria have for us, much more an
inquiry into their nature and origin? They have long
since perished, like the people who professed them, and have left no apparent traces of their influence upon the
nations about whom we know and care most. The
Greeks and Romans concerned themselves so little with
these Eastern barbarians as neither to read nor to pre
serve the only Greek history of Chaldcea which was
written by a native and professed to be derived from
native accounts ; we owe the fragments we have of it to
tlic apologetic zeal of Christian controversialists. Still
less would it appear that these old people of Babylonia
and Assyria can have had any influence upon the world
of to-day, or have served to mould the ideas and the
society of modern Europe. Such questions may be asked, and until lately it would have been hard to answer them.
And yet a moment's consideration might have shown
that there was one nation at all events which has exer
cisedj and still exercises, a considerable influence upon
our own thought and life, and which had been brought
into close contact with the religion and culture of Baby
lonia at a critical epoch in its history. The influence of
Jewish religion upon Christianity, and consequently upon the races that have been moulded by Christianity, has



INTRODUCTORY. 39
been lasting and profound. Now Jewish religion was
intimately bound up with Jewish history, more intimately perhaps than has been the case with any other great
religion of the world. It took its colouring from the
events that marked the political life of the Hebrew
people ; it developed in unison with their struggles and
successes, their trials and disappointments. Its great
devotional utterance, the Book of Psalms, is national,
not individual ; the individual in it has merged his own
aspirations and sufferings into those of the whole com
munity. The course of Jewish prophecy is equally stamped with the impress of the national fortunes. It
grows clearer and more catholic as the intercourse of the
Jewish people with those around them becomes wider ;
and the lesson is taught at last that the God of the Jews
is the God also of the whole world. Now the chosen
instruments for enforcing this lesson, as we are expressly
told, were the Assyrian and the Babylonian. The Assyrian was the rod of God's anger, 1 while the Babylonish
exile was the bitter punishment meted out to Judah for
its sins. The captives who returned again to their own
land came back with changed hearts and purified minds ;
from henceforward Jerusalem was to be the unrivalled
dwelling-place of " the righteous nation which keepeth
the truth."
Apart, therefore, from any influence which the old
religious beliefs of Babylonia may have had upon the
Greeks, and which, as we shall see, was not so wholly
wanting as was formerly imagined, their contact with
the religious conceptions of the Jewish exiles must, to
1 Is. x. 5.



40 LECTURE I.
say the least, have produced an effect which it is well
worth our while to study. Hitherto, the traditional
view has been that this effect exhibited itself wholly on
the antagonistic side; the Jews carried nothing away
from the land of their captivity except an intense hatred
of idolatry, more especially Babylonian, as well as of
the beliefs and practices associated therewith. Now and
then, it is true, some bold spirit, like Bishop Warburton, may have ventured to propound the paradox that the
doctrine of the resurrection was first learnt by the Jews
in Babylonia, but it was treated generally as a paradox, and of late years, if admitted at all, was considered a
proof of the influence not of the Babylonians but of
their Persian conquerors.
The traditional view had no facts to build upon except
such conclusions as it could draw from the Old Testament
itself. To-day all this is changed. We know something
now about the deities whom the Babylonians worshipped,
about the rites and ceremonies they practised, and about
the religious ideas they entertained. The result of this
knowledge is to show us that the Jews did not live in
the midst of the Babylonians for seventy years without
borrowing from them something more than the names of
the months. Nay more ; it shows us that the language
of the Babylonian conquerors was not the so-called
( lhaldee, which is really an Aramaic dialect, but a lan
guage more closely resembling that of the exiles them
selves. It is true that a Jew could not have understood a
Babylonian, any more than a Welshman can understand
a Breton, but it was very easy for him to learn to
understand. Assyrian, that is to say the language of
Babylonia, is on the whole more nearly related to Hebrew



INTRODUCTORY. 41
than it is to any other member of the Semitic family of
speech.
But it was not only through the Babylonian exile that
the religious ideas of the Babylonian and the Jew came
into contact with, each other. It was then, indeed, that
the ideas of the conquering race—the actual masters of
the captives, who had long been accustomed to regard
Babylonia as the home of a venerable learning and
culture — were likely to make their deepest and most
enduring impression ; it was then, too, that the Jew for the first time found the libraries and ancient literature
of Cbaldrea open to his study and use. But old tradition
had already pointed to the valley of the Euphrates as
the primaeval cradle of his race. We all remember how
Abraham, it is said, was born in Ur of the Chaldees, and
how the earlier chapters of Genesis make the Euphrates
and Tigris two of the rivers of Paradise, and describe
the building of the Tower of Babylon as the cause of
the dispersion of mankind. Now the Hebrew language
was the language not only of the Israelites, but also of
those earlier inhabitants of the country whom the Jews
called Canaanites and the Greeks Phoenicians. Like
the Israelites, the Phoenicians held that their ancestors
had come from the Persian Gulf and the alluvial plain
of Babylonia. The tradition is confirmed by the re
searches of comparative philology. Many of the words which the Semites have in common seem to point to the
neighbourhood of Babylonia as the district from which
those who used them originally came, and where they
called the fauna and flora of the country by common
names. Their first home appears to have been in the
low-lying desert which stretches eastward of ChaldaEia



42 LECTURE I.
on the very side of the Euphrates, in fact, on which
stood the great city of Ur, the modern Mugheir. Here
they led a nomad life, overawed by the higher culture
of the settled Accadian race, until a time came when
they began to absorb it themselves, and eventually, as
we have seen, to dispossess and supersede their teachers. The tribes which travelled northward and westward
must, we should think, have carried with them some of
the elements of the culture they had learnt from their
Accadian neighbours. And such, indeed, we find to be
the case. The names of Babylonian deities meet us
again in Palestine and the adjoining Semitic lands.
Nebo, the Babylonian god of prophecy and literature, has «>;ivcn his name to towns that stood within the terri
tories of Reuben and Judah, as well as to the Moabite
mountain on Avhich Moses breathed his last ; Anu, the
Babylonian god of heaven, and his female consort Anatu,
re-appear in Both-Anath, "the temple of Anatu," and
Anathoth, the birth-place of Jeremiah ; and Sinai itself is
but the mountain of Sin, the Babylonian Moon-god. 1 We may thus assume that there were two periods in
the history of the Jewish people in which they came
under the influence of the religious conceptions of Babylonia. There was the later period of the Babylonish

tin' population <>f Moab and Canaan, where the names of Babylonian deities were not (infrequent. The name of Sin, the Moon-god, is met
with in an Himyaritic inscription, and a god who thus found his way to southern Arabia wuuld be equally likely to find his way to northern Arabia.



INTRODUCTORY. 43
exile, when the influence was strong and direct; there
was also the earlier period, when the amount of influence
is more hard to determine. Much will depend upon the
view we take of the age of the Pentateuch, and of the
traditions or histories embodied therein. Some will be
disposed to see in Abraham the conveyer of Babylonian ideas to the west ; others will consider that the Israelites
made their first acquaintance with the gods and legends
of Babylonia through the Canaanites and other earlier
inhabitants of Palestine. Those who incline to the latter
belief may doubt whether the fathers of the Canaanitish
tribes brought the elements of their Babylonian beliefs
with them from Chaldaea, or whether these beliefs were
of later importation, due to the western conquests of
Sargon and his successors. Perhaps what I have to say
in my subsequent Lectures will afford some data for
deciding which of these conflicting opinions is the more
correct.
Meanwhile, I will conclude this Lecture with a few
illustrations of the extent to which the study of Baby
lonian religion may be expected to throw light on the
earlier portions of Scripture. We have already noticed the curious parallelism which exists between the legend
of Sargon's exposure in an ark of bulrushes and the
similar exposure of the great Israelitish leader Moses on
the waters of the Nile. The parallelism exists even
further than this common account of their infancy.
Sargon of Accad was emphatically the founder of Semitic
supremacy in Babylonia ; he was the great lawgiver of
Babylonian legend ; and to him was assigned the com
pilation of those works on astrology and augury from which the wise men of the Chaldaeans subsequently



44 LECTURE I.
derived their lore. Moses was equally the legislator of
the Israelites and the successful vindicator of Semitic
independence from the exactions of Egyptian tyranny, and future generations quoted the books of the Hebrew
law under his name. As we have seen, Sargon was a
historical personage, and popular tradition merely treated
him as it has treated other heroes of the past, by attach
ing to him the myths and legends that had once been
told of the gods.
Now the name of the great Hebrew legislator has long
been a puzzle and a subject of dispute. In the Hebrew
Old Testament it is connected with the Hebrew verb
mashdh, " to draw out," not, indeed, in the sense that Moses was he who had been drawn out of the water, for
this would not be grammatically permissible, though
Pharaoh's daughter puns upon the idea (Exod. ii. 10), but in the sense of a leader who had drawn his people
out of the house of bondage and led them through the
waves of the sea. The translators of the Septuagint, on
the other hand, living as they did in Egypt, endeavoured
to give the word an Egyptian form and an Egyptian
etymology. With them the name is always MbmHjs, which Joscphos tells us is derived from the Egyptian
words mdt "water," and uses, " saved from the water." 1
But this etymology, apart from other imperfections, depends upon the change the translators of the Septuagint have themselves made in the pronunciation of the name.
Modern Egyptian scholars, equally willing to find for it
an Egyptian derivation, have had recourse to the Egyp
tian messu or mes, " a son." This word, it is true, when
occurring in proper names is usually combined with the
1 AnHq. ii. 9. 6; Cont Ap. i. 3L



INTRODUCTORY. 45
name of a deity ; Rameses, for example, the Scsostris of
the Greeks, being written in the hieroglyphics Ra-messu, "born of the Sun-god." But it is conceivable that we
might occasionally meet with it alone, and it is also con
ceivable, though not very probable, that the daughter of
the Egyptian king would assign to her adopted child the
simple name of " son." It is much less conceivable that
such an Egyptian name would be that by which a national
hero would be afterwards known to his Semitic country
men. It is difficult to believe that the founder of the
Israelitish people would have borne a title which the
Israelites did not understand, and which could remind
them only of that hated Egyptian land wherein they had
been slaves.
Josephos has preserved an extract from the Egyptian historian Manetho, which relates the Egyptian version
of the story of the Exodus as it was told in the second
century before our era. In this it is stated that the
earlier name of Moses was Osarsiph, and that he had
been priest of Heliopolis or On. Here it is evident that
Moses and Joseph have been confounded together. The
name of Joseph, who married the daughter of the priest
of On, has been decomposed into two elements, the first
of which is the divine name Jeho, and this has been
changed into its supposed Egyptian equivalent Osar or
Osiris. It is clear that, whatever might have been his
opinion about the name of Joseph, Manetho had no doubt
that that of Moses was purely Israelitish. It was not until
he had become the Israelitish lawgiver and had ceased to
be an Egyptian priest that Osarsiph took the name of Moses.
But Moses finds no satisfactory etymology in the



46 LECTURE I.
pages of the Hebrew lexicon. It stands alone among
Hebrew proper names, like Aaron and David. We do
not hear of any other persons who have borne the name.
If, therefore, it is Semitic, it must belong to an older stratum of Semitic nomenclature than that preserved
to us in the Old Testament. We must look to other
branches of the Semitic stock for its explanation.
There is only one other branch of the Semitic family
whose records are earlier than those of the Hebrews.
Arabic literature begins long after the Christian era,
when Jewish and Greek and even Christian names and
ideas had penetrated into the heart of the Arabian penin
sula. The Arabic language, moreover, belongs to a different division of the Semitic family of speech from
that to which Hebrew belongs. To compare Arabic and
Hebrew together is like comparing Latin with modern
German. There is, however, one Semitic language which
has the closest affinities to Hebrew, and this is also the
language of which Ave possess records older than those
of the Hebrew Scriptures. I need hardly say that I am
referring to Assyrian.
Now the Assyrian equivalent of the Hebrew Mosheh,
u Moses," would be mdsu, and, as it happens, mdsu is a
word which occurs not unfrequcntly in the inscriptions. It was a word of Arcadian origin, but since the days of
Sargon of Accad had made itself so thoroughly at home
in the language of the Semitic Babylonians as to count
henceforth as a genuinely Semitic term. Mdsu signified
as nearly as possible all that we mean by the word
''hero." 1 As such, it was an epithet applied to more
1 Mdsu, "hero," has of course no connection with mdsu, "double,"
on which 869 .Jensen, in the ZeitachHft fur Assyriologie, i. 3, pp. 259.



INTRODUCTORY. 47
than one divinity; there was one god more especially for whom it became a name. This god was the deity
Bometimes called Adar by Assyrian scholars, sometimes
Nin-ip, bnt whose ordinary name among the Assyrians
is still a matter of uncertainty. He was a form of the
Sun-god, originally denoting the scorching sun of midday. He thus became invested with the sterner attri
butes of the great luminary of clay, and was known to
his worshippers as "the warrior of the gods." The title
of Mdsu, however, was not confined to Adar. It was
given also to another solar deity, Merodach, the tutelar
god of Babylon and the antagonist of the dragon of chaos, and was shared by him with tergal, whose special
function it was to guard and defend the world of the
dead. But Nergal himself was but the sun of night, the
solar deity, that is to say, after he had accomplished his
daily work in the bright world above and had descended
to illuminate for a time the world below.
It will thus be seen that the name of mdsu, " the hero"
or "leader," was in a peculiar sense associated with the
Sun-god. the central object of primitive Semitic worship. But it seems to have had another signification which it
is difficult to bring into connection with the ideas of
leadership and war. The character which represented
260. In W.A.I, iii. 70. 167, mdsu is rendered by asaridu, "first
born" or "leader" (in 1. 171 by eJlu and ibbu, " illustrious"). Some might perhaps ses a reference to the other meaning of mdsu (" twin") in the close association of Moses and Aaron. There is no difficulty about the equivalence of the sibilants in the Hebrew and Assyrian
words, since the Hebrew shin corresponds with the Assyrian s in proper names which, like Asshur, belong to the earlier period of Hebrew intercourse with Babylonia, and in words which are not proper names it
always corresponds. The name of Aaron, I may add, seems to find its
root in the Assyrian aharu, " to send."



4£ LECTURE I.
the idea of ma&u or "hero," also represented the idea of
"a collection of books.'' 1 With the determinative of
personality prefixed, it further denotes "a scribe" or
"librarian." It is at least remarkable that Moses the
1 Tel dew legislator was also the unwearied scribe to whom
Hebrew tradition referred the collection of its earliest
documents and the compilation of its legal code.
But it was in the signification of "hero" that the
Assyrian mdsu made its way into astrology, and was
thus carried wherever a knowledge of Chaldean astro
logical lore was spread. The Accadians had pictured
the sky as the counterpart of the rich alluvial plain of
Babylonia in which they dwelt. In the remote age to
which their first observations of the stars reached back,
tin sun still entered the zodiacal constellation known to
us as Taurus at the time of the vernal equinox. It is
in consequence of this fact that the constellation is even
yet called by us Taurus, " the bull." The sun was
likened by the old Accadian star-gazers to a ploughman
yoking his oxen to his glittering plough ; nay, he was even likened to an ox himself; and the title given to
Merodach the Sun-god when he passed through the
twelve zodiacal signs was Gudi-bir, "the bull of light."
Ileiice it was that the ecliptic was termed "the yoke of
heaven," bound as it were upon the neck of the solar
bull; that the first of the zodiacal signs, the opener of
tin' primitive Accadian year, was called "the directing
bull," "the bull who guides" the year; and that two
prominent stars received the names of "Bull of Ami"
and " Bull of Rimmon." But as in the Babylonian
1 See W A. L ii. 48. 25, 26, where mas is explained by Teissu sa mns'ire.



INTRODUCTORY. 4 ()
plain below, so too in the plain of heaven above, there
were sheep as well as oxen. The seven planets were
"the seven bell-wethers," and by their side was another
group of seven stars, entitled "the lu-mdsi" or "sheep
of the hero." 1 The first of these was "the star of the
wain;" and among them were reckoned the star of " the
eagle," the symbol of the meridian sun, the star of the
goddess Balm, "the pure wild heifer" of the gods, and
the star "of the shepherd of the heavenly herds," the hero " who fights with weapons." The last-mentioned
star is Regulus, and in his Greek name of Bootes, "the
herdsman," we may see a lingering echo of the Aecadian
story which made its way through the hands of the
Phoenicians to Greece. Bootes, however, was not ori
ginally the "hero," one of whose flock he was himself
held to be. 3fdsu, the "hero" of the astronomers, could
only have been the sun.
It is not more strange that a name thus intimately
associated with the religious and astrological beliefs of
Babylonia should have found its way to the west, than
that names like Nebo and Sin, which are similarly reli
gious and astrological, should have done so too. Moses, it will be remembered, died on the summit of Mount
Nebo in sight of the " moon-city" -Jericho. Now Xcbo,
1 Jensen has shown that mdsi in this combination was further used
in the sense of "twins," the stars composing the "lu-masi" being grouped as twins. It is an example of the obliteration of the original
signification of an epithet by a secondary one. " The sheep of the hero," the Aecadian lu-mas, became the Semitic lu-mdsi, "the twin oxen," In being an Assyrian -word for "ox." The "seven lu-bad," or
"old sheep," shows, however, what the primitive meaning of hi must Vave been.

as we shall see, was the prophet-god of Babylon and
Borsippa, the offspring of the Sun-god Merodach, and the patron of writing and literature. He also figured
among the stars. Together with the stars of Istar and
Nereal, lie was accounted one of the seven "heroes" or
mdsu. As Nebo was the interpreter of Merodach, so in
the language of astrology his star was itself a mdsu or
solar hero. Sin was the Babylonian name of the Moon
god. We learn from a Himyaritic inscription that his name had been carried into southern Arabia, and there
is therefore no reason why it should not have been im
ported into northern Arabia as well. And we seem to
meet with it in the name of the wilderness of Sin, to
which Moses conducted the children of Israel when they
had first left Egypt, before they arrived at Mount Sinai.
Sinai itself can scarcely signify anything else than the
mountain sacred to the Moon-god ; and Ave can therefore
well believe that a shrine of Sin may have existed upon
it, and pilgrims have made their way to the sanctuary
long before the Israelites demanded their "three days'
journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to the Lord"
(Exod. viii. 27). It is possible that the name of Joseph, like that < f
Moses, may receive its explanation from Babylonia. Already at the time when the book of Genesis was
written, its original meaning seems to have been for
gotten. An alternative etymology is there proposed
(\\x. 23, 24), from tisaph, "to take away," and ydsdph^
" to add ;
" while in the Psalms (lxxxi. G) another deriva
tion is suggested, which would connect it (as was after
wards done by Manetho) with the sacred name oi the



INTRODUCTORY. 51
God of Israel. 1 Now Joseph was not only the father
or the Israelitish tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, he
was also a deity worshipped by the older inhabitants
of Canaan. More than two centuries before the date
assigned by Egyptologists to the Exodus, the great Egyptian conqueror Thothmes III. inscribed upon the
walls of the temple of Ivarnak the names of the cities
captured by him in Palestine. Among them are Yaqab-el,
"Jacob the God," and Iseph-el, "Joseph the God." We are therefore tempted to think that the expression
"the house of Joseph" may have belonged to an earlier
period than that in which it was applied to the tribes of
Ephraim and Manasseh ; that, in fact, like Beth-el, "the
house of God," it was once used by the Canaanites in a
literal sense. Now Beth-el, we are told, the older name
of which was Luz, was taken by the house of Joseph,
and became in later times one of the two great sanctuaries
of the northern kingdom. What if Beth-el had itself
been the more ancient " house of Joseph ;" what if " the
house of the god" and "the house of Joseph" had in
Canaanitish days been one and the same ? The question
may receive an answer if we turn for it to the Assyrian
inscriptions. Here we find aslpu or asip used in the sense of "a diviner." The word was actually borrowed
by the Aramaic of Daniel under the form of ashshdph ;
2
1 Manetho (ap. Joseph, cant. Ap. i. 28) states that the original name of Moses was Osarsiph, and that he had been a priest of Helio
polis or On. Osar-siph is simply Joseph, Osar or Osiris bein substituted for Jeho (Jo) or Jahveh. Joseph, it will be remembered, married
the daughter of the priest of On. 2 We should have expected a samech instead of a shin; the word, however, must have been borrowed, since we do not meet with it elsewhere in the Old Testament. By the side of asipu we find isippu, th(>

in (Id Hebrew and Phoenician, its form would have
more nearly approached that of Joseph. The asipu or "diviner" plays a considerable part in the religious
literature of Babylonia, and the very phrase bit assaputi,
11 the house of the oracle," is actually met with. A god
who seems to be Bel in his character of delivering oracles
through the voice of the thunder is called " the hero who
prophesies" or " divines uprightly." Although, there
fore, it is a point which cannot be proved at present, it
appears nevertheless probable that the name of Joseph
was originally identical with the Babylonian asipu, "the god of the oracle;" and that long before the Israelitish
house of Joseph took possession of Lnz, it had been a
house of Joseph in another sense and the sanctuary of a
( anaanitish oracle. 1
But whether or not we are to look to Babvlonia for
an explanation of the name of Joseph, there is little
doubt that the Babylonian pantheon throws light on the
names of the three first king-s of Israel. Some vears
ago I endeavoured to show in the pages of the Modem
Revieto (January, 1884), that the names by which they
are known to history, Saul and David and Solomon,
were not the names they received in childhood, but
names subsequently applied to them and current among
the people. As regards the name of Solomon, we are
actually told that this was the case; his original name
the name given by the Lord through Nathan — was
name of a particular class of priests whose duties were confined to soothsaying. It was from this word that the character which denoted
"speech" derived its value of isip. Siptu, "incantation," was en in Accadian.

Jcdidiah, which was changed into Solomon, "the peaceful
one," when his father had " peace from all his enemies,"
and had surrounded his new capital of Jerusalem (perhaps
the city of "peace") with a single wall. 1 That David's
first name was El-hanan (or Baal-hanan) has long been
suspected, since it is stated in one passage that Elhanan
the son of a Bethlehemite " slew Goliath the Gittite,
the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam," 2
while the feat is elsewhere ascribed to David; and at
the head of the thirty mighty men of David is placed
Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, where we should
probably read " Elhanan who is Dodo" or David. 3 Saul,
too, is presumably of similarly popular origin, the name
Saul, " the one asked for," being singularly appropriate to a king for whom, we are told, the people had " asked."
~No\v there is a curious parallelism between the three
first kings of Israel and the three last kings of Edom
enumerated in the SGth chapter of Genesis, where we
have, I believe, an extract from the state-annals of the
Edomites. Saul had "vexed" the Edomites, 4 and David
had completed the conquest ; but the accession of Solomon
and the murder of Joab brought with them almost imme

diately the successful revolt of Edom under Hadad, who
bad married the sister of Pharaoh's queen. 1 In strange
accordance with this, we find that the three last Edomite
kings mentioned in the list in Genesis were Saul, Baal
hanan and Iladar—a name which must be corrected into
Hadad, as in Iladarezer for Hadadezer. The kings of
Edom seem to have had a predilection for assuming the
names of the divinities they worshipped. We have
among them Hadad, the son of Bedad (or Ben-Dad), Hadad and Dad being, as we learn from the cuneiform
inscriptions, titles of the supreme Baal in Syria, whose
attributes caused the Assyrians to identify him with
their own Bimmon ; and Hadad was followed by Samlah
of Masrekah or the "Vine-lands," in whose name we
discover that of a Phoenician god recorded in a recently
found inscription as well as that of the Greek Semele. 2
1 1 Kings xi. 19 — 2-"3.
2 See the letters of Dr. Xcubauer and myself in the Athemeum of
Sept. 12 and Sept. 26, 1885. As the worship of Dionysos, the Winegod, had been borrowed by the Greeks from the East, it had long been assumed that the name of Semele must be of Phoenician extraction; but it was only in 1881 that a Phoenician inscription was found in a bay to the west of the Peirseos containing the name Pen-'Samlath (" the
face of 'Samlath"). The first king of Edom mentioned in Gen. xxxvi. is Bela the son of Beor, that is, Bileam or Balaam the son of Beor.
Dr. Xeubauer has shown that Balaam is Bil-'am, " Baal is Am(mi)," i he supreme god of Amnion (as we have learned from the cuneiform inscriptions), whose name enters into those of Jerobo-am and Rehobo
am. An Assyrian mythological tablet (W. A. I. ii. 54, 65) informs us
that Emu (E2?) was the Nergal of the Shuites on the western bank of the Euphrates. The words with which the list of the Edomite kings is introduced ("These are the kin^s that rei<nied in the land of Edom before there reigned any king over the children of Israel") are of course an addition by the Hebrew excerptist. It will be noticed that the
father of the last king in the list, Hadad II. (Hadar), is not mentioned, while, contrary to the almost universal practice of the Old Testament,



INTRODUCTORY. 60
We need not be surprised, therefore, if the name of Saul
also turns out to be that of a divinity. We are told that
Saul came from '"Eehoboth of the river" Euphrates;
and since Eehoboth means the public squares and suburbs
of a capital city, and is consequently used of Nineveh in the book of Genesis (x. 11), we must look for the
Eehoboth of the Euphrates in Babylon. Now one of
the principal names under which the Sun-god was known
at Babylon was Savul or Sawul, which in Hebrew cha
racters would become Saul. In Saul, accordingly, I
think we may see a Babylonian deity transported to Edom and perhaps also to Palestine.
Hadad occupied a higher position than Saul. He
was, as I have said, the supreme Baal or Sun-god, whose
worship extended southward from Carchcmish to Edom
and Palestine. At Damascus he was adored under the
Assyrian name of Simmon, and Zechariah (xii. 11) alludes
to the cult of the compound Hadad- Eimmon in the
close neighbourhood of the great Canaanitish fortress of
Megiddo. Coins bear the name of Abd-Hadad, "the
servant of Hadad," who reigned in the fourth century
at Hierapolis, the later successor of Carchemish, and, under the abbreviated form of Dada, Shalmaneser speaks
the names of his wife and mother-in-law are given. This is explained by 1 Kings xi. 19, where we are told that he was married to the sister
of Tahpenes the Egyptian queen. Mr. Tomkins is probably right in identifying Tahpenes with the name of the frontier-fortress which was known to the Greeks as Daphnre, and is now called Tel-Defeneh, so that the introduction of the name into the text of the book of Kings would be a marginal gloss. Mehetab-el and Me-zaliab are apparently the Semitic substitutes of Egyptian names such as the Egyptian monuments have made us familiar with. Me-zahab would presuppose an
Egyptian Nub, and Mr. Tomkins ingeniously suggests that Genubath, the name of the son of Hadad, represents the Egyptian Ka-nub-ti,



56 LECTURE I.
of -the god Dada of Aleppo" (Klialmau). The abbreviated form was that current among the nations of the
north ; in the south it was confounded with the Semitic
word which appears in Assyrian as dadu, "dear little child." This is the word which we have in Be-dad or
Ben-Dad, "the son of Dad," the father of the Edomite
Hadad; we have it also in the David of the Old Testa
ment. David, or Dod, as the word ought to be read,
which is sometimes written Dodo with the vocalic suffix
of the nominative, is the masculine corresponding to a Phoenician goddess whose name means "the beloved
one," and who was called Dido by the writers of Borne.
Dido, in fact, was the consort of the Sun-god, conceived
as Tammuz, "the beloved son," and was the presiding
deity of Carthage, whom legend confounded with Elissa,
the foundress of the city. In the article I have alluded
to above, I expressed my conviction that the names of
DoiIm and David pointed to a worship of the Sun-god, under the title of "the beloved one," in southern Canaan
as well as in Phoenicia. I had little idea at the time
how six »n my belief would be verified. Within the last
year, the squeeze of the Moabitc stone, now in the Louvre,
lias been subjected 1" a thorough examination by the
* rerman Professors Socin and Smend, with the result of
correcting some of the received readings and of tilling
up some of the lacuna:. One of the most important dis
coveries that have been thus made is that the Israelites
of the northern kingdom worshipped a Dodo or Dod by
the side of Yahveh, or rather that they adored the
supreme Grod under the name of Dodo 1 as well as under
1 Written rrm in the Moabite text, where he elsewhere takes the place of the llebr w waic.



INTRODUCTORY. 67
that of Yahveh. Mesha, the Moabito king, in describing
the victories which his god Chemosh had enabled him to
gain over his Israelitish foes, tells us that he had carried
away from Ataroth "the arel (or altar) of Dodo and
dragged it before Chemosh," and from Nebo "the arels
(or altars) of Yahveli," which he likewise " dragged before Chemosh." Here the arel or "altar" of Dodo is placed
in parallelism with the arels of Yaliveh ; and it is quite
clear, therefore, that Dodo, like Yahveh, was a name
under which the deity was worshipped by the people of the land. I have suggested that Dod or Dodo was an
old title of the supreme God in the Jebusite Jerusalem,
and that hence Isaiah (v. 1), when describing Jerusalem
as the tower of the vineyard the Lord had planted in
Israel, calls him Dod-i, " my beloved." We can easily understand how a name of the kind, with such a signifi
cation, should have been transferred by popular affection
from the Deity to the king of whom it is said that "all
Israel and Judah loved him" (1 Sam. xviii. 16).
That Solomon was a divine name we have the express
testimony of the cuneiform inscriptions for asserting.
Sallimmanu, "the god of peace," was a god honoured particularly in Assyria, where the name of more than
one famous king (Shalman-eser) was compounded with it. As the name of Nineveh was ideographic-ally ex
pressed by a fish within a basin of water, 1 while the
name itself was connected in popular etymology with
1 The ideograph also represented the name of the goddess Nina — a
word which means "the Lady" in Sumerian—who was the daughter of Ea the god of Eridu (W. A. I. iv. 1, 38). There was a city or sane
tuary in Babylonia of the same name (K 4G29, Rev. 8), which explains the statement of Ktesias that Nineveh stood on the Euphrates (up. Diod. iL 31,



58 LECTURE I.
the Assyrian ««»«, "a fish," it is possible that the cult
of Sallimman or Solomon in Assyria was due to the fact
that he was a fish-god, perhaps Ea himself. In a list of
the gods whose images stood in the numerous temples of
Assyria (W.. A. I. iii. 66, Rev. 40), mention is made of
" Sallimmanu the fish, the god of the city of Temen
Sallim (the foundation of peace)." His worship was
carried westward at a comparatively early period, and
in the age of Shalmaneser II. the royal scribe at Sadikan,
now Arban on the Khabur, was named Sallimmanu-nunu
sar-ilani, " Solomon the fish is king of the gods." 1 So,
too, in the time of Tiglath-Pileser III. (B.C. 732) the
Aloabite king was Salamanu or Solomon, a plain proof
both that the god was known in Moab, and also that in
Moab, as in Israel, the name of the god could be applied
to a man.
If a gleam of light has thus been cast by the monu
ments of Assyria and Babylonia upon the names of the
earlier kings of Israel, it is but feeble in comparison
with the illustrations they afford us of the ritual and
religious practices recorded in the Old Testament. The
ritual texts, fragmentary as they are, are numerous
among the debris of Assur-bani-pal's library, and the references we find from time to time in the historical
inscriptions to religious rites and ceremonies give us
tantalising glimpses into the service and ceremonial of
the Assyro-Babylonian priesthood.

Layard disi ered winged bulls at Arban, inscribed with the words, "The palace of Muses-Adar." For a representation of the seal, see George Smith's Chaldean Genesis (ed. Sayce), p. 97.



INTRODUCTORY . 59
In Assyria the king himself performed many of the
functions of a high-priest. Like Solomon of Israel, he
could offer sacrifice and pour out libations to the gods.
Assur-ris-ilim is entitled "the appointed of the divine
father (Bel), the priest (kingu) of Assur ;
" l Assur-natsir
pal calls himself " the appointed of Bel, the priest [sangn)
of Assur, the son of Tiglath-Adar the appointed of Bel, the priest of Assur, the son of Eimmon-nirari the
appointed of Bel, the priest of Assur;" 2 Sargon is simi
larly "the appointed of Bel, the exalted priest (nu-es)
of Assur," as well as " the high-priest (patesi) of Assur ;
"
while Nebuchadnezzar designates himself " the worship
per of Merodach, the supreme high-priest (pate.si), the beloved of Nebo." 3 But the union of the two offices
was by no means necessary. In the far-off prc-Semitic age there were kings of Tel-loh as well as patch's or
high-priests of Tel-loh, and the kings did not take the
title of high-priest, while the high-priests did not take
the title of kins'. The earliest records of Assyria went
back to a period when as yet there were no kings, but
only "high-priests of Assur;" 4 and among the objects
brought from Babylonia by Dr. Hayes Ward is a barrel
shaped weight of green basalt, on which we read : "the palace of Nebo-sum-esir the son of Dakur, the high
priest (patcsi) of Merodach." A distinction is carefully
drawn between "the king" and "the high-priest" in
the imprecation against the Vandals of the future attached
to an old historical text in the Accadian language, 5 and
the poet who embodied the Cutha^an legend of the crea

tion in his verses concludes by saying : " Thou, whether
king, high-priest, shepherd or any one else whom God shall call to rule the kingdom, I have made for thee this
tablet, I have inscribed for thee this record-stone, in the
city of Cutha, in the temple of 'Sulim." 1 Ktesias, there
fore, was justified in making a high-priest of his Baby
lonian Belesys—a name, by the way, which appears in
the inscriptions, under the form of Balasu, as that of a
Babylonian prince in the time of Tiglath-Pileser III. 2
The Semitic title of the high-priest (nisalcku or issakku)
indicates that his main duty was to pour out libations
1 Patesi and xu-es are rendered by the Assyrian nisakku and issakku. These Lave nothing to do with an Accadian nes, as Lotz supposed, much less with nisu and ish, "a man," as Guyard suggested, but are
merely derivatives from the verb nasaku, " to pour out a libation," which occurs in the eleventh tablet of the Epic of Gisdhubar (col. vi. 1. -i). Patesi should probably be read khattes'i or khiUtcsi, since the country of that name is written indifferently pa-se-ki and pa-te-si-ki (W. A. I. ii. 53, 13). The substitution of si (sig) for patesi or kladtesi
in the penitential psalm ("W. A. I. iv. 21, 45) seems due to a blunder of the Semitic scribe, who read the first character (pa) as sig (see v.
19, 55). Nu-ES, "the man of the temple," is a compound ideograph of S( mitic invention, which originated when false analogy had caused the termination akku to be Tegarded as a separate suffix, so that the root of nisakku was supposed to be nis or nis. The old rendering of patt ii hy " viceroy" rested on a mistake ; the word always has reference to the worship of a god. The Nebu-sum-esir mentioned in the text,
for instance, was not the viceroy of a king, but "the high-priest of Mi rodach," who lived at Babylon by the side of the king. The analogy of nisakku has created sakkanakku, "a high-priest," from sakanu, which is borrowed from the Accadian sagan (W. A. I. iii. 70, 40), the Zoganes of Berossos.
- Arbakes is equally the name of a Median chief mentioned by
Sargon, ami Sargon himself may be the Akraganes whom Ktesias makes
the last king but one of Assyria. As Schrader points out (Keilin
schrifteti und Geschichtsforschung, p. 516), in the time of Ktesias, Belesys was the Persian governor of Syria and Assyria, and Arbakes of
Media (Xenophon, Aia/>. vii. 8, 25).



INTRODUCTORY. 61
in honour of the gods, and the phrases in which the
word occurs show that he was attached to the cult of
the supreme god of the country in which he lived. At
Babylon it was Merodach from whom the high -priest
received his title ; at Nineveh it was Assur.
Under the high-priest several classes of subordinate
priests were ranged. There was the sangu, for example, whose title interchanges at times with that of the high
priest himself. The sarigu properly signified one who was "bound'' or attached to a particular deity or his sanctuary, who was his slave and bondsman. The name
may therefore be compared with that of the Le rites, if
the latter, too, arc those who were "attached" to special
places of worship. At Nineveh there was a sangu attached
to the harem which was under the protection of Istar,
as well as one who was entitled "the strong mngu" and
who may accordingly be regarded as one of the chief
priests.
1
By the side of the sangu stood the pcisisu or " anointer,"
whose duty it was to purify with oil both persons and
things. The cleansing of objects by anointing them with oil was considered a matter of great importance ;
even the stone tablets and foundation-stones of a building
are ordered to be cleansed in this way. The use of
"pure water" for washing the hands and other parts of
the body occupies a conspicuous place in the ritual texts, and in one of them we read the following instructions in
regard to a person who is undergoing purification :
2
1 W. A. I. ii. 31. 60, 61. The remains of the palace discovered by
Layard at Arban (the ancient Sadikan) belonged, according to the
inscription on the bulls, to " Muses- Adar the priest" {sangu).

" Pure water give him to drink, and pour out the water
over the man; remove the root of the saffron (?),
1 and
offer pure wine and pure yeast, and place on the heart
the fat of a crane 2 which has been brought from the
mountains, and anoint the body of the man seven times."
Another class of priests were the kali, a word borrowed
by the Semites from the Accadian leal, " illustrious."
The halu was also termed labaru, "the elder," a word
a sain borrowed from the Accadian lobar, which in Sume
rian appears in the earlier form of lagar? In the epic
of Gisdhubar, where Ea-bani(?) is describing the land of Hades which he is doomed to enter, the lagaru and
the pctsisuj or "anointer," are mentioned along with the
isippu, or " soothsayer," and the makh/chu, or " great one," from the Accadian mulch, in which Prof. Delitzsch
sees the "mag" or "(Rab-)mag" of the Old Testament. 4

Ea-bani is made to say, "(for me) is treasured up 5 ai

(there the Lady) of the field, the scribe of the earth, bows before her; (there she . . .) and makes answer in

"The abysses" or "deeps" of the great gods is an
expression which requires explanation. The temples of
Babylonia were provided with large basins filled with
water and used for purificatory purposes, which resembled
" the sea" made by Solomon for his temple at Jerusalem,
and were called apsi, "deeps" or "abysses." 3 It was
with these " deeps" that the pdsisu or " anointing priest,"
whose office it was to purify and cleanse, was specially
concerned. The basins doubtless stood in the open air,
in the great court within which the temple itself was
erected.

A synonym of Icatsutu is tarpu (Acc.idian dirnme, "spectre"), the Hebrew terouphim (see Neubauer in the Academy, Oct. 30, 1886). 1 Zimmern thinks that am, " lord," denoted a class of priests ; but this is unlikely, unless we suppose the word to be borrowed from the
Accadian en, "an incantation" (Assyrian siptu). As, however, the Assyrians formed eintu, "lady" (W. A. I. iii. 4, 55), from enu, this sup
position is improbable.

<M LECTURE I.
The description of E-Saggil,the temple of Bcl-Merodaeh
at Babylon, which, has been translated by Mr. George
Smith, 1 states that here at least there was a second court,
that of "Istar and Zam.una," besides the great court.
'Within the latter was another walled enclosure, built in
the form of a square, and containing the great ziggurrat,
or " tower,'' as well as the temples and chapels of a large
number of deities. This agglomeration of sacred edifices
was due to the fact that the temple of Bel was a Baby
lonian Pantheon where the images and cult of the mani
fold gods of Chaldsea were gathered together. Where
the temple was dedicated to one divinity only, there was
of course only one building.
In one particular, however, the temple of Bel-Mcrodach
differed from that of every other Babylonian temple with
which we are acquainted. This is in its orientation. Its
sides face the four points of the compass, whereas in the
case of the other temples it is the corners that do so.
The cause of this departure from the usual canons of
Babylonian sacred architecture has still to be discovered.
Within, the temple bore a striking likeness to that of
Solomon. At the extreme end was the pardku, or "holy
of holies,'' concealed by a curtain or veil from the eyes
of the profane.2 Here, according to Nebuchadnezzar,
was " the holy scat, the place of the gods who determine
destiny, the spot where they assemble together (?),

shrine (para/c) of fate, wherein on the festival of Zagmuku

lord of the heavens, seats himself, while the gods of
heaven and earth listen to him in fear (and) stand bowing
down before him." l Here, too, Herodotos tells us (i. 183),
was a golden image of the god, with a golden table in front of it like the golden table of shewbread in the
Jewish temple. 2
The little chapel of Makhir, "the god of dreams," discovered by Mr. Hormuzd Kassam at Balawat, near
Mosul, gives us further information about the internal
arrangement of the shrine. In this, Mr. Rassam found
a marble coffer containing two stone tablets which recorded
Assur-natsir-pal's victories and the erection of the chapel.
The coffer and its contents remind us forcibly of the
Israelitish ark with its "two tables of stone" (1 Kings
viii. 9). Before the coffer, at the north-west of the
chamber, was an altar of marble ascended by five steps,
where another stone tablet was disinterred similar to
those in the coffer. The gates that led to this temple of
Makhir were coated with plates of embossed bronze,
which are now in the British Museum. The great temple
of Bel-Merodach at Babylon was adorned in a more

was known in Babylonia. In a fragment of a bilingual phrase-book (K 4207) we read (lines 8, 9), (Ace.) mulu sagar-an-tug-a e-gttr al-murra-in-u-ne, which is translated biruta bit agurrl ipallas, "the foodprovider looks down upon the house of brick." (For ipallas, see
W. A. I. iv. 17, 26, where the corresponding Accadian verb appears
as ide-rainin-barren.) In W. A. I. ii. 44, 74, birutu is the rendering
of the Accadian far (ki-gal), out of the ideographic representation of which the Semitic scribes by an erroneous reading formed the word
kigallu. Now in W. A. I. iv. 13, 12, we find ina Idsal-maMiklxi kigalla

rostly way. Its cedar-work was overlaid by Nebuchad«
nezzar with gold and silver, while its furniture, like that
of Solomon's temple, was of " massive gold."
The coffer of the little temple of Imgur-Bel, or Balawat,
resembled in form the arks, or " ships" as they were
termed, in which the gods and their symbols were carried
in religious processions. 1 It thus gives us a fair idea of what the Israelitish ark of the covenant must have been
like. It, too, was a small shrine of rectangular shape,
carried by means of staves passed through rings at its
four corners. It is somewhat curious that the Assyrian
ark should have assumed this shape. The name by
which it went to the last was that of " ship," a proof
that it was originally in the form, not of an ark, but of a ship. The same transformation is observable in the
Biblical account of the Deluge as compared with that of
the cuneiform inscriptions; here also "the ship" of the
Babylonian version has become "an ark." But the fact
that the arks of the Babylonian gods were once ships
points to a period when the first who made use of them
were dwellers by the sea-shore. We are referred back
to the ancient Chaldsean city of Eridu, on the shores of
the Persian Gulf, from whence, as we shall see hereafter,
the religion and religious ceremonies of pre -Semitic
Babylonia had once spread. The gods of Eridu were
water-gods, and, like the deities of Egypt, had each his
sacred ship. These ships occupied an important place
in the Babylonian ritual ; they all had special names,

gods are represented as standing upon platforms (or boats ?) which are earned on men's shoulders, two men supporting one end of each platform and two men the othur

and were the visible abodes of the divinities to whom
they belonged. Let us listen, for instance, to an old
hymn that was recited when a new image of the god
was made in honour of "the ship of enthronement," the papakh or "ark" of Merodach.
" Its helm is of cedar (?) wood ....
Its serpent-like oar has a handle of gold.
Its mast is pointed with turquoise. Seven times seven lions of the field (Eden) occupy its deck.
The god Adar fills its cabin built within.
Its side is of cedar from its forest.
Its awning is the palm (?) wood of Dilvun.
Carrying away (its) heart is the canal. Making glad its heart is the sunrise.
Its house, its ascent, is a mountain that gives rest to the heart.
The ship of Ea is Destiny.
Nin-gal, the princess (Dav-kina), is the goddess whose word is life. Merodach is the god who pronounces the good name. The goddess who benefits the house, the messenger of Ea the
ruler of the earth, even Nan-gar (the lady of work), the
bright one, the mighty workwoman of heaven, with pure (and) blissful hand has uttered the word of life :
' May the ship before thee cross the canal ! May the ship behind thee sail over its mouth !
Within thee may the heart rejoicing make holiday I'" 1
The hymn was an heirloom from Sumerian Eridu. It
had come down from the days when Merodach was not
as yet the god of Babylon, but was the son of Ea, the
water-god of Eridu. It is written in Accadian, and no
Semitic translation is attached to it ; it is even possible
that some of the expressions used in the hymn had ceased
to be intelligible to the priests of E-Saggil who recited
it. 2 At all events, the references to the ship of the deity

were no longer applicable in the Semitic age of Babylon.
The md or "ship" of the pre-Semitic Sumerians had
then become the papdkhu or "ark" of the Semites; helm
and oar and mast had alike disappeared, and it was no
longer required to sail across the sacred canals of the
temples, but was carried on the shoulders of men.
The festivals at which such arks were borne in pro
cession were naturally numerous in a country where
divinities innumerable were adored. The festival of
Zag-mu-ku, mentioned by Nebuchadnezzar as having been
held at Babylon at the beginning of the year, is possibly the Sakrean feast of the classical writers, when a slave
was dressed in the robes of a king. 1 The service at the
temple of Bel-Merodach which was opened by the hymn
in honour of his ark, was accompanied by another specially
commemorating the festival itself: 2
" The day the (image of the) god has been made, he has caused the
holy festival 3 to be fully kept.
Semitic vjaru, "a heap" ("wall"), though the scribes of Semitic Babylonia afterwards confounded the two words together.
1 The month, however, does not agree in the case of the two feasts.
Athenseos (Deipn. xiv.) says : " Berossos in the first book of his Babylonian History states that in the 11th month, called Loos, is celebrated the feast of Sakaea, for five days, when it is the custom that the masters should obey their servants, one of whom is led round the house, clad in a royal robe, and called Zoganes." The Zoganes was the Accadian
eagan, borrowed as saTcanu by Semitic Babylonian (W. A.I. iii. 70, 40,
ii. 51, 31), probably from saga, "head." Sakkanakku, "high-priest," is a derivative.

No better idea can be formed of the number and variety
of the Babylonian feasts than by reading a hemerology of the intercalary month of Elul, where we find that
every day is dedicated to one or other of the gods, and
certain rites and ceremonies prescribed for each. 3 We

the creative message of the valiant golden god ;" Assyrian : "In perpetuity for ever cause (the festival) to be complete, by the command of the same god (who) brought (it) about."
3 With this hemerology may be compared the following liturgical fragment (K 3765) :
2. On the 9 th day there is no going forth ; to the sun and moon
his offerings (nindabut) he makes. 3. On the 10th day .... there is no going forth ....

lonian with a complete "saints' calendar" for the whole
year. So careful was he not to lose an opportunity of
keeping holiday in honour of his deities, that even the
intercalary months, which were rendered necessary from
time to time by the frequent disorder of the calendar,
were included in the series. Besides the festivals of the
regular Elul, there were consequently the festivals of a
second Elul whenever the priests deemed it needful to
insert one in the calendar. Hence, as the regular Elul
was the sixth month of the year, our tablet is the seventh
of the series.

One of the most interesting facts that result from this
hemerology is, that the Sabbath was known to the Baby
lonians and Assyrians. Its institution must have gone
back to the Accadian epoch, since the term nsed to repre
sent it in the text is the Accadian udu Ichulgal, "an
unlawful day," like the Latin "dies nefastus," which is
rendered by sulum, or "rest-day," in Assyrian. 1 Semitic
Babylonian, however, possessed the term Sabbath as
well, and a vocabulary explains it as being "a day of rest for the heart." 2 Like the Hebrew Sabbath, it was
1 W. A. I. iii. 56, 53.
2 W. A. I. ii. 32, 16, yum nuJdi libbi = sdbattuv. In the new edition
of the Encyclopedia Britannica, the reading sabattuv in this passage is called a "textual emendation" made by Delitzsch. This, however, is
a mistake. It is the reading of the original tablet, and the published text was corrected by myself long before Delitzsch re-examined the
original The Encyclopedia Britannica. makes another strange statement in describing the Hebrew Sabbath as a day "of feasting and good cheer." It was, on the contrary, a day of rest (Gen. ii. 2, 3 ; Ex. xx. 10), "the holy day" on which the Jew was forbidden to do his
own pleasure — "not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own
pleasure, nor speaking thine own words" (Is. lviii. 13) — in exact conformity with the regulations of the Babylonian Sabbath. The compiler of the text (W. A. I. ii. 32) in which sabattuv is explained as "a day of rest of the heart," evidently regarded the word as derived from the
Accadian sa-bat, " heart-resting," and he certainly had in support of his view the similar term nubattu, from the Accadian mi-bat. The
Assyrian verb sabatu is given as a synonym of gamaru, "to complete,"
in W.A.I, v. 28, 14.

observed every seventh day, and was obviously connected
with the seventh-day periods of the moon. But there were two respects in which it differed from
the Hebrew institution. Among the Israelites, "the
Sabbaths" and "the new moons" were separate from
one another ; among the Babylonians, they coincided in
so far as the Sabbath fell on the first day of the lunar
month. Consequently, since the month consisted of thirty
days, the last week contained nine days. In the second
place, the 19th of the intercalary Elul was also a Sabbath.
Why it should have been so I cannot pretend to say.
Besides the stated festivals and Sabbaths, extraordinary
days of thanksgiving or humiliation were ordained from
time to time. In the closing years of the Assyrian
empire, when her foes were gathering around her, the
last king, Esarhaddon II., prayed to the Sun-god that
he would "remove the sin" of his people, and ordered
the /chalj or " prophet," to prescribe " the legal solemnities
{mesari isinni) for a hundred days and a hundred nights," from the 3rd of Iyyar to the 15th of Ab. 1 So, too,
Assur-bani-pal tells us, that after suppressing the revolt
in Babylonia and removing the corpses that had choked
the streets of the Babylonian cities, " by the command
of the augurs (isippntiy he "purified their shrines and cleansed their chief places of prayer. Their angry gods
and wrathful goddesses he soothed with supplications
and penitential psalms. He restored and established in
peace their daily sacrifices, which they had discontinued, as they had been in former days." 2
The sacrifices and offerings of the Babylonians and

Assyrians closely resembled those of the Israelites. Like
the latter, they were divided into sacrifices of animals,
such as oxen, sheep or gazelles, and offerings of meal ; 11 id wine. Wine was poured over the victim or the altar.
When the effeminate Assur-bani-pal had slaughtered a
battue of caged lions, he "set up over them the mighty
bow of Istar, the lady of war, presented offerings over
them, and made a sacrifice of wine over them." 1 An
old magical text prays that " the sick man may be
purified by sacrifices of mercy and peace," or " peace
offerings," as the translators of our Bible would have
expressed it. 2 But although the Assyrian kings are
fond of boasting of their exploits in massacreing or torturing their defeated enemies in honour of Assur, we
find no allusions in the inscriptions of the historical
period to human sacrifice. That human sacrifices, how
ever, were known as far back as the Accadian era, is
shown by a bilingual text (K5139) which enjoins the
algal, or " chief prophet," to declare that the father must
give the life of his child for the sin of his own soul, the
child's head for his head, the child's neck for his neck,
the child's breast for his breast. The text not only
proves that the idea of vicarious punishment was already
conceived of ; it also proves that the sacrifice of children
was a Babylonian institution. In the great work on
astronomy called "The Observations of Bel," 3 we are
told that "on the high-places the son is burnt." 4 The
offering was consequently by fire, as in Phoenicia.

The sacrifices were accompanied, sometimes by hymns
or incantations, sometimes by prayers. The prayers were all prescribed, and a large number of them have
been preserved. Here are some examples of them: 1
"At dawn and in the night (the worshipper) shall how down (ikammis) hefore the Throne-hearer and shall speak as follows :
' Throne
bearer, giver of prosperity, a prayer !' After that he shall how down to Nusku and shall speak thus :
' Nusku, prince and king of the
secrets of the great gods, a prayer !
' After that he shall bow down to
Adar and shall speak thus :
' Adar, mighty lord of the deep places of the wells, a prayer !' After that he shall bow down to Gula and
shall speak thus :
' Gula, mother, begetter of the black-headed race, a prayer!' After that he shall bow down to Nin-lil and shall speak
thus :
' Nin-lil, mighty goddess, wife of the divine Prince of Sove
reignty, a prayer !' After that he shall bow down to Mul-lil and shall
speak thus :
* lord exalted, establisher of law, 2 a prayer !' For three
days at dawn and at night, with face and mouth uplifted, during the
middle watch, the diviner (asip) shall pour out libations."
The best idea, however, of what a Babylonian religious service was like, may be gathered from the instructions
given to the priest who watched in the temple of Bel
Merodach at Babylon on the night of the first day of the
new year. 3 Part of his duty was to repeat a hymn, the
first fourteen lines of which were alternately in Accadian
and Semitic. Curiously enough, however, there was nc
character both of Rimmon and of the plain of Babylonia. The word corresponds with the Heb. Ich&rar. M. Menant has pointed out several
instances in which a human sacrifice is represented on early Babylonian
cylinders {Catalogue de la Collection cle Clercq, i. pp. IS, 112 sq. In pi. xix. No. 181, is a ruder copy of a scene of human sacrifice
depicted on an early Babylonian cylinder procured by Dr. Max Ohnefalsch-Bichter in Cyprus).

connection between the Accadian and the Semitic verses ;
while the Semitic lines were addressed to Bel-Merodach
of Babylon and Borsippa, the Accadian portion had to do with "a god of the sanctuary," whose only resemblance
to Bel was that he is entitled "the lord of the world."
The Accadian verses are thus evidently a heirloom from
a distant past, possibly from the pre-Semitic days of
Babylon itself, and it is more than probable that the
meaning was but little understood by the Semitic priests.
This is how the text begins :
"In the month Nisan, on the second day 1 and the first hour (Jcasbu)
of the night, the priest 2 must go and take the waters of the river in
his hand ; he must enter into the presence of Bel, and, putting on a robe in the presence of Bel, shall address to Bel this hymn : 3
1 Bui. who in his strength has no rival,
Bid, king of blessedness, Bel (the lord) of the world,* Seeking after the favour of the great gods,
Bel, who in his glance has destroyed the strong, 5 Bel (the lord) of kings, light of mankind, establisher of trust ;
e
Bel, thy sceptre is Babylon, Borsippa is thy crown ! The wide heaven is the habitation of thy liver !
lord, thine is the revelation, (and) the interpretations of visions ; father (?) of lords, thee they behold the father of lords;
1 It must be remembered that the Babylonians, like the Jews,
reckoned tin; day from evening to evening.
The Accadian title Uru-gal, "the chief watcher," is used. The tit!- perhaps hud reference to the nightly watch kept in the sanctuary ui' Merodach in the tower of E-SaffeiL

tii in fully.
The preceding Accadian line is : "0 lord of the blessed sanctuary, lord of the world !"
Tie preceding Accadian line reads: "What is the lord (doing)
now ? the lord is resting."
The preceding Accadian line has: "The god of the sanctuary of
mankind, the god who holds the sanctuary of man."

2 With this text must be compared another (unmarked at the time
I copied it), which is interesting as referring to the oracle established within the "shrine" or "holy of holies" (parak) of the temple of Bel:
" (4) Like Bel in the shrine of the destinies the prophecy shall be

" (1) . . . king cf the assinnu listen ; (2) ... in the house of the supreme chief (ab

Various special dresses were worn during the perform
ance of the religious ceremonies, and ablutions in pure
water were strongly insisted on. Seven, too, was a sacred
number, whose magic virtues had descended to the
Semites from their Accadian predecessors. When the
Chaldsean Noah escaped from the Deluge, his first act
was to build an altar and to set vessels, each containing
the third of an ephah, by sevens, over a bed of reeds,
pine-wood and thorns. Seven by seven had the magic
knots to be tied by the witch, 1 seven times had the body
of the sick man to be anointed with the purifying oil. 2
As the Sabbath of rest fell on each seventh day of the
week, so the planets, like the demon messengers of Aim, were seven in number, and "the god of the number
seven" received peculiar honour.
Along with this superstitious reverence for the sacred
number, went a distinction of the animal world into clean
and unclean, or rather into food that it was lawful and

unlawful to eat. The distinction may have gone back
to an age of totemism; at all events, it prevailed as
extensively among the Babylonians and Assyrians as it did among the adherents of the Mosaic Law. In one of
the penitential Psalms, the author expresses his contrition for having " eaten the forbidden thing;" and if Jensen
is right in seeing the wild boar in the sakhu of the texts,
its flesh was not allowed to be eaten on the 30th of the
month Ab, nor, like that of the ox, on the 27th of
Marchesvan. 1 The very mention of the khumzir, or
domestic pig, is avoided in the Semitic Babylonian and
Assyrian inscriptions, and reptiles were accounted as unclean as they were among the Jews. 2 It is true that
there are indications that human flesh had once been
consumed in honour of the spirits of the earth, as Prof.
Maspero has lately shown must also have been the case
in pre-historic Egypt, and a bilingual hymn still speaks
of " eating the front breast of a man;" 3 but such bar

a magical text (W. A. I. ii. 17, 63) it was termed arlu, the Keb. tirel, which is used in Hebrew and Arabic in a precisely opposite sense ; but

and "the flesh of the wild ass," and " the flesh of the dragon" (J<i*bi$), all of which it was unlawful to eat. In S 1720, 17, mention is made
of " the house of the dark (dir) flesh of Ea," where the idea may be similar to that of the Egyptian texts in which the lea or "double" of the dead is described as feasting on the gods. Cp. also an unnumbered

bnrons practices were but dimly -remembered reminis
cences of a barbarous past, and were never shared in by
the Semites. It is equally true that medicine laid con
tributions on the most unclean articles of food, including
snakes, the tongues of "black dogs" and even ordure; but those who swallowed the compounds prescribed by
the medical faculty wore those who had already lost
their faith in the old beliefs of the people, and had
substituted the recipe of the doctor for the spells of the
exorcist and the ritual of the priest. The practice of
medicine has often been accused of antagonism to reli
gion ; whatever may be the case in these modern days,
the theology of ancient Babylonia harmonised but badly
with the prescriptions of its medical school. 1

Lecture II.
BEL-MERODACH OF BABYLON
In an inscription upon a ciay cylinder brought from
Babylonia seven years ago, Cyrus is made to declare that
the overthrow of Nabonidos, the last independent Babylonian monarch, was due to the anger of Bel and the
other gods. Nabonidos had removed their images from
their ancient sanctuaries, and had collected them together
in the midst of Babylon. The priests maintained that
the deed had aroused the indignation of Merodach, "the
lord of the gods," who had accordingly rejected Naboni
dos, even as Saul was rejected from being king of Israel, and had sought for a ruler after his own heart. It was
" in wrath" that the deities had "left their shrines when
Nabonidos brought them into Babylon," and had prayed
Merodach, the divine patron of the imperial city, to "go round unto all men wherever might be their seats."
Merodach sympathised with their wrongs; "he visited
the men of Sumer and Accad whom he had sworn should
be his attendants," and "all lands beheld his friend."
He chose Cyrus, king of Elam, and destined him by
name for the sovereignty of Chaldsea. Cyrus, whom
the Hebrew prophet had already hailed as the Lord's
Anointed, was thus equally the favourite of the supreme
Babylonian god. "Merodach, the great lord, the restorer



86 LECTURE II.
of his people," we are told, "beheld with joy the deeds
of his vicegerent who was righteous in hand and heart.
To his city of Babylon he summoned his march, and lie
bade him take the road to Babylon; like a friend and a
comrade he went at his side." A single battle decided
the conflict: the Babylonians opened their gates, and
"without fighting or battle," Cyrus was led in triumph into the city of Babylon. His first care was to show his
gratitude towards the deities who had so signally aided
him. Their temples were rebuilt, and they themselves
were restored to their ancient seats.
With all the allowance that must be made for the
flattery exacted by a successful conqueror, we must con
fess that this is a very remarkable document. It is
written in the Babylonian language and in the Babylonian form of the cuneiform syllabary, and we may
therefore infer that it was compiled by Babylonian scribes
and intended for the perusal of Babylonian readers. Yet
we find the foreign conqueror described as the favourite
of the national god, while the last native king is held up
to reprobation as the dishonourer of the gods. It is im
possible not to compare the similar treatment experienced by Nebuchadnezzar and the native Jewish kings respec
tively at the hands of Jeremiah. The Jewish prophet
Baw in the Chaldsean invader the instrument of the God
of Judah, just as the Babylonian scribes saw in Cyrus
the instrument of the god of Babylon ; and the fall of the
house of David is attributed, just as much as the fall of
Nabonidos, to divine anger. It is true that the reasons assigned for the divine
anger are not the same in the two cases. But the cause
of the indignation felt by the gods of Chaldsea against



BEL-MERODACH OF BABYLON. 87
Xabonidos offers a curious illustration of the words ad
dressed by the Rab- shaken of Sennacherib to the people
of Jerusalem. "If ye say unto me," he declared, "we
trust in the Lord our God ; is not that he whose high
places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and
hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, ye shall worship
before this altar in Jerusalem?" The destruction of the
local cults, the attempt to unify and centralise religious
worship, was to the Kab-shakeh, as it was to the Baby
lonian scribes, and doubtless also to many of the Jews in
the time of Hezekiah, an act of the grossest impiety.
An annalistic tablet, drawn up not long after the con
quest of Babylonia by Cyrus, hints that before making
his final attack on the country, the Elamite prince had
been secretly aided by a party of malcontents in Chaldsea
itself. It is at all events significant that as soon as the
army of Nabonidos was defeated, the whole population at
once submitted, and that even the capital, with its almost
imoregnable fortifications, threw open its gates. The revolts which took place afterwards in the reigns of
Dareios and Xerxes, and the extremities endured by
the Babylonians before they would surrender their city,
prove that their surrender was not the result of cowardice
or indifference to foreign rule. The great mass of the
people must have been discontented with Xabonidos
and anxious for his overthrow.
The anger of Merodach and the gods, in fact, was but
a convenient way of describing the discontent and anger
of an important section of the Babylonians themselves.
Nabonidos did not belong to the royal house of Nebu
chadnezzar; he seems to have raised himself to the
throne by means of a revolution, and his attempt at



88 LECTURE II.
centralisation excited strong local animosities against
him. Religion and civil government were so closely
bound up together, that civil centralisation meant reli
gious centralisation also ; the surest sign that the cities
of Babylonia had been absorbed in the capital was that
the images of the gods whose names had been associated
with them from time immemorial were carried away to
Babylon. The cities lost their separate existence along
with the deities who watched over their individual
fortunes.
The removal of the gods, however, implied something more than the removal of a number of images and the
visible loss of local self-government or autonomy. Each
image was the centre of a particular cult, carried on in
a particular temple in a particular way, and entrusted
to the charge of a special body of priests. It was no
wonder, therefore, that the high-handed proceedings of Nabonidos aroused the enmity of these numerous local
priesthoods, as well as of all those who profited in any
way from the maintenance of the local cults. Most of the
cities which were thus deprived of their ancestral deities
were as old as Babylon: many of them claimed to be
older ; while it was notorious that Babylon did not become
a capital until comparatively late in Babylonian history.
The Sun-god of Sippara, the Moon-god of Ur, were alike older than Merodach of Babylon. Indeed, though in the age of Nabonidos the title of Bel or "lord" had
come to be applied to Merodach specially, it was known
that there was a move ancient Bel—Belitanas, "the
elder Bel,'
1 as the Greeks wrote the word—• whose wor
ship had spread from the city of Nipur, and who formed
one of the supreme triad of Babylonian gods.



BEL-MERODACH OF BABYLON. 89
Up to the last, Babylonian religion remained local. It was this local character that gives us the key to
its origin and history, and explains much that would
otherwise seem inconsistent and obscure. The endeavour
of Xabonidos to undermine its local character and to
create a universal religion for a centralised Babylonia,
was deeply resented by both priests and people, and
ushered in the fall of the Babylonian empire. The funda
mental religious idea which had underlain the empire
had been the supremacy of Merodach, the god of Babylon, over all other gods, not the absorption of the deities of
the subject nations into a common cult. The policy of
Xabonidos, therefore, which aimed at making Merodach,
not primus inter pares, but absolute lord of captive or
vassal deities, shocked the prejudices of the Babylonian
people, and eventually proved fatal to its author. In
Cyrus, accordingly, the politic restorer of the captive populations and their gods to their old homes, the priests and
worshippers of the local divinities saw the pious adherent
of the ancient forms of faith, and the real favourite of
Merodach himself. Merodach had not consented to the
revolutionary policy of Xabonidos ; he had, on the con
trary, sympathised with the wrongs of his brother gods
in Babylonia and throughout the world, and had thus deserted his own city and the renegade monarch who
ruled over it.
In all this there is a sharp contrast to the main reli
gious conception which subsequently held sway over the Persian empire, as well as to that which was proclaimed
by the prophets of Judah, and in the reforms of Hezekiah
and Josiah was carried out practically by the Jewish
kings. The Ahura-mazda whom Dareios invokes on the



90 LECTURE II.
nick of Behistun is not only the lord of the gods, he is a
lord who will not brook another god by his side. The
supreme god of the Persian monarch is as absolute as
the Persian monarch himself. In the Persian empire
which was organised by Dareios, centralisation became
for the first time a recognised and undisputed fact, and
political centralisation went hand-in-hand with religious
centralisation as well. In Judah, a theocracy was esta
blished on the ruins of the old beliefs which had con
nected certain localities with certain forms of divinity,
and which found such naive expression in the words of
1 );ivid to Saul (1 Sam. xxvi. 19): " They have driven me
out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord,
saying, Go, serve other gods." The destruction of the
high-places and the concentration of the worship of
Yahveh in Jerusalem, was followed by the ever-increasing
conviction that Yahveh was not only a jealous God who
would allow none other gods besides Himself; He was
also a God who claimed dominion over the whole world.
Now it was precisely this conception which the Babylonians, at least as a people, never attained. Nebuchad
nezzar may invoke Merodach as "the lord of the gods,"
"the god of heaven and earth," "the eternal, the holy,
the lord of all things," but he almost always couples
him with other deities—Xebo, Sin or Gula—of whom
lie speaks in equally reverential terms. Even Xabonidos
uses language of sin, the Moon-god, which is wholly incompatible witli a belief in the exclusive supremacy of
Mer idach. lie calls him " the lord of the gods of heaven
and earth, the king of the gods and the god of gods, who dwell in heaven and are mighty." Merodach was,
in fact, simply the local god of Babylon. Events hud



BEL-MERODACH OF BABYLON. !»1
raised Babylon first to the dignity of the capital of
Babylonia, and then of that of a great empire, and its
presiding deity had shared its fortunes. It was he who
had sent forth its people on their career of conquest ; it
was to glorify his name that he had given them victory.
The introduction of other deities on an equal footing
with himself into his own peculiar seat, his own special
city, was of itself a profanation, and quite sufficient to
draw upon Nabonidos his vindictive anger. The Moon
god might be worshipped at Ur ; it was out of place to offer him at Babylon the peculiar honours which were
reserved for Merodach alone.
Here, then, is one of the results of that localisation of
religious worship which was characteristic of Babylonia. Nabonidos not only offended the priests and insulted the
gods of other cities by bringing their images into Babylon, he also in one sense impaired the monopoly which the
local deity of Babylon enjoyed. He thus stirred up
angry feelings on both sides. Had he himself been free
from the common belief of the Babylonian in the local
character of his gods, he might have effected a revolution
similar to that of Hezekiah ; he had, however, the super
stition which frequentlyaccompanics antiquarian instincts, and his endeavour to make Babylon the common gather
ing-place of the Babylonian divinities was dictated as
much by the desire to make all of them his friends as by
political design.1
1 It must be remembered that the attempt of Xabonidos was essen
tially different from the mere gathering of the gods of Babylonia into the great temple of Merodach, which Nebuchadnezzar had made a kind of Chaldsean Pantheon. Here they assumed a merely subordinate place: they weie tb * attendants and servitors of the god of Babylon, and their



!-(l' LECTURE II.
Now who was this Merodach, this patron -go J of Babylon, whose name I have had so often to pronounce?
Let us see, first of all, what we can learn about him
from the latest of our documents, the inscriptions of
Nebuchadnezzar and his successors. In these, Merodach
appears as the divine protector of Babylon and its inha
bitants. He has the standing title of Bilu or "lord,"
which the Greeks turned into Bt^Aos, and which is the
same as the Baal of the Old Testament. The title is
frequently used as a name, and is, in fact, the only name under which Merodach was known to the Greeks and
Romans. In the Old Testament also it is as Bel that he
comes before us. When the prophet declares that "Bel
boweth down" and is " gone into captivity," he is refer
ring to Merodach and the overthrow of Merodach's city.
To the Babylonian, Merodach was pre-eminently " the Baal" or "lord," like the Baalim or "lords " worshipped
under special names and with special rites in the several
cities of Canaan.
The temple or "tomb" of Belos, as it was also called
by the Greeks, was one of the wonders of the world.
1 1 i'rodotos, quoting probably from an earlier author, describes it in the following terms :
• Tip- temple of Zeus B61os, with bronze gates which remained up to
my time, was a square building two furlongs every way. In the middle
slirines and chapels were ranged humbly round his lofty tower. As Nebuchadnezzai himself says, they here "listened to him in reverence and stood bowing down before him." Nabonidos, on the other hand, endeavoured to transplant the local cults of the deities, along with their time-honoured images, to the capital city, to place them there on a
footing of equality with Merodach, and so to defraud him of his privileges ; while at the same time he removed the other deities from the localities when' alone they could be properly adored.



BEL-MERODACII OF BABYLON. 93
of the temple -was a tower of solid masonry, a furlong in length and breadth, and upon this tower another tower had been erected, and upon
that again another, and so on for eight towers. And the ascent to them was by an incline which wound round all the towers on the outside.
About the middle of the incline are a resting-place and seats, where
those avIio ascend may sit and rest. In the topmost tower is a large
shrine, within which is a large and well-appointed couch, with a golden table at its side. But no image is set up there, nor does any one pass
the night there except a single woman, a native of the country, whom the god selects for himself from among all the inhabitants, as is asserted
by the Chalda?ans, the priests of the god. They further say, though I cannot believe it, that the god himself visits the shrine and takes his rest upon the couch .... There is another shrine below belonging to
this Babylonian temple, and containing a great statue of Zeus [Belos] of gold in a sitting posture, and a great golden table is set beside it. The p idestal and chair of the statue are of gold, and, as the Chaldaeans
used to say, the gold was as much as 800 talents in weight. Outside
the shrine is a golden altar. There is also another great altar upon
which full-grown sheep are sacrificed, for upon the golden altar only sucklings are allowed to be offered. Upon the larger altar also the Chaldaeans burn each year a thousand talents of frankincense at the
time when they keep the festival of the god. In this part of the
temple there was still at that time a figure of a man twelve cubits
high, of solid gold."
It is clear from this description that the great temple
of Babylon resembled a large square enclosure formed
by huge walls of brick, within which rose a tower in
eight stages. Below the tower was a shrine or temple,
and outside it two altars, the smaller one of gold for
special offerings, while the larger one was intended for
the sacrifice of sheep as well as for the burning of
incense. 1
We learn a good deal about this temple from the
inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar, which show that although
1 Similarly in Solomon's temple there were two altars, one for larger
and the other for smaller offerings (1 Kings viii. 64).



04 LECTURE II.
Herodotoa was correct in his general description of the
building, he has made mistakes in the matter of details.
The temple itself stood on the east side of Babylon, and
had existed since the age of Khammuragas (B.C. 2250),
and the first dynasty which had made Babylon its capital.
It bore the title of E-Sagila or E-Saggil, an Accadian
name signifying "the house of the raising of the head." 1
Its entrance also bore the Accadian title of Ka-khilibn,
which Nebuchadnezzar renders "the gate of glory." He
says of it : " Ka-khilibn, the gate of glory, as well as
the gate of E-Zida within E-Sagila, I made as brilliant
as the sun. The holy seats, the place of the gods who
determine destiny, which is the place of the assembly

rential awe and standing humbly before him, determine
therein a destiny of long-ending days, even the destiny
of my life ; this holy of holies, this sanctuary of the
kingdom, this sanctuary of the lordship of the first-born of the gods, the prince, Merodach, which a former king
had adorned with silver, I overlaid with glittering gold
and rich ornament." 1 Just within the gate was the
"seat" or shrine of the goddess Zarpanit, the wife of
Merodach, perhaps to be identified with that Succoth
benoth whose image, we are told in the Old Testament,
was made by the men of Babylon. 2
E-Zida, "the firmly-established temple," was the chapel dedicated to Xebo, and derived its name from the great
temple built in honour of that deity at Borsippa. As
Nebo was the son of Merodach, it was only fitting that
his shrine should stand within the precincts of his father's
temple, by the side of the shrine sacred to his mother
Zarpanit. It was within the shrine of Xebo, the god of
prophecy, that theparakku, or holy of holies, was situated, where Merodach descended at the time of the great fes
tival at the beginning of the year, and the divine oracles
were announced to the attendant priests. The special
papakha or sanctuary of Merodach himself was separate from that of his son. It went by the name of E-Kua,
"the house of the oracle," 3 and probably contained the

golden statue of Bel mentioned by Herodotos. Nebu
chadnezzar tells us that he enriched its walls with ; '
glit
tering gold." Beyond it rose the stately siggurat, or
tower of eight stages, called E-Temen-gurum, '"the house of the foundation-stone of heaven and earth.*' As
was the case with the other towers of Babylonia and
\ -syria, its topmost chamber was used as an observatory. Xo temple was complete without such a tower ; it was to
the Babylonian what the high-places were to the inha
bitants of a mountainous country like Canaan. It takes
us back to an age when the gods were believed to dwell
in the visible sky, and when therefore man did his best
to rear his altars as near to them as possible. "Let us
build us a city and a tower," said the settlers in Babel,
,: whose top may reach unto heaven."
The Babylonian Bel, accordingly, was Merodach, who watched over the fortunes of Babylon and the great
temple there which had been erected in his honour. He
was not the national god of Babylonia, except in so far
as the city of Babvlon claimed to represent the whole of
Babylonia ; he was simply the god of the single city of Babvlon and its inhabitants. He was but one Baal out
of many Baalim, supreme only when his worshippers were themselves supreme. It was only when a Xebu
chadnezzar or a Khammuragas was undisputed master of
Babylonia that the god they adored became ' ; the prince
of the gods." But the other gods maintained their

separate positions by his side, and in their own cities
would have jealously resented any interference with
their ancient supremacy. As we have seen, Nabonidos
brought upon himself the anger of heaven because he
carried away the gods of Marad and Kis and other towns
to swell the train of Merodach in his temple at Babylon.
We can now therefore appreciate at its true value the
language of Nebuchadnezzar when he speaks thus of his
god :
" To Merodach, my lord, I prayed ; I began to him my petition ; the word of my heart sought him, and I said :
' prince that art from
everlasting, lord of all that exists, for the king whom thou lovest, whom thou eallest by name, as it seems good unto thee thou guidest his name aright, thou watchest over him in the path of righteousness !
I, the prince who obeys thee, am the work of thy hands ; thou createst me and hast entrusted to me the sovereignty over multitudes of men,
according to thy goodness, lord, which thou hast made to pass over them all. Let me love thy supreme lordship, let the fear of thy divi
nity exist in my heart, and give what seemeth good unto thee, since thou maintainest my life.' Then he, the first-born, the glorious, the
first-born of the gods, Merodach the prince, heard my prayer and
accepted my petition." 1
Once more :
" To Merodach, my lord, I prayed and lifted up my hand :
'O
Merodach, (my) lord, first-born of the gods, the mighty prince, thou didst create me, and hast entrusted to me the dominion over multitudes
of men ; as my own dear life do I love the height of thy court ; among
all mankind have I not seen a city of the earth fairer than thy city of
Babylon. As I have loved the fear of thy divinity and have sought
after thy lordship, accept the lifting up of my hands, hearken to my
petition, for I the king am the adorner (of thy shrine), who rejoices
thy heart, appointed a royal priest, the adorner of all thy fortresses. By thy command, Merodach, the merciful one, may the temple I have built endure for ever, and may I be satisfied with its fulnesr,.'" 4

98 LECTURE II.
Here Merodach, it will be observed, though " lord of
all that exists,'' is nevertheless only the first-born of the
gods. There were gods older than he, just as there were
cities older than Babylon. He could not therefore be
alisolute lord of the world; it was only within Babylon
itself that this was the case; elsewhere his rule was
shared with others. Hence it was that while Nebuchad
nezzar as a native of Babylon was the work of his hands,
outside Babylon there wrere other creators and other lords.
This fact is accentuated in an inscription of Xabonidos,
belonging to the earlier part of his reign, in which
Merodach is coupled with the Moon-god of Ur and placed
on an equal footing with him.
One of the epithets applied by Nebuchadnezzar to
Merodach is that of riminu, or " merciful." It is indeed
a standing epithet of the god. Merodach was the inter
cessor between the gods and men, and the interpreter of
the will of Ea, the god of wisdom. In an old bilingual
hymn he is thus addressed :
l " Thou art Merodach, the
merciful lord who loves to raise the dead to life." The
expression is a remarkable one, and indicates that the
Babylonians were already acquainted with a doctrine of the resurrection at an early period. Merodach's attribute
of mercy is coupled with his power to raise the dead.
The same expression occurs in another of these bilingual
hymns, which I intend to discuss in a future Lecture. 2
The whole hymn is addressed to Merodach, and was
doubtless used in the religious services of E-Sagila. The
beginning and end are unfortunately lost. "Where the
hymn first becomes legible, we read:
1 W. A. I. iv. 19. 1. V 2 tv. a. I. iv. 29, 1.



BKL-MERODACH OF BABYLON. 99
" (Thou art) the king of the land, the lord of the world !
O first-horn of Ea, omnipotent over heaven and earth. 1
(> mighty lord of mankind, king of (all) lands,
(Thou art) the god of gods, (The prince) of heaven and earth who hath no rival,
The companion of Ann and Bel (Mul-lil), The merciful one among the gods, The merciful one who loves to raise the dead to life,
Merodach, king of heaven and earth,
King of Babylon, lord of E-sagila, King of E-Zida, king of E-makh-tilla (the supreme house of life), Heaven and earth are thine !
The circuit of heaven and earth is thine, The incantation that gives life is thine,
The breath 2 that gives life is thine,
The holy writing 3 of the mouth of the deep is thine : Mankind, even the black-headed race (of Accad),4
All living souls that have received a name, that exist in the world,
The four quarters of the earth wheresoever they are, All the angel-hosts of heaven and earth
(Regard) thee and (lend to thee) an ear."
It is impossible to read this hymn without being struck
by the general similarity of tone that exists between it
1 Accadian, "filling heaven and earth."
8 Ivat, Heb. KJiavvdli, or " Eve."
3 Musaru, perhaps the " Mnsaros Oannes" of Berossos. Ea, the god of the deep and of the city of Eridn, was the Oannes of Berossos, and no*; only the god of wisdom and author of Babylonian culture, but him
self a writer of books (see W. A. I. iv. 55, 7), which proceeded as it were out of his mouth.
4 The precise meaning of this expression, which is frequent in the hymns, is uncertain. It may refer to the custom of wearing long black hair, though in this case we should have expected the phrase to be "black-haired" rather than "black-headed." As, however, M. Dieulafoy's excavations on the site of Susa have brought to light enamelled bricks of the Elamite period on which a black race of mankind is
portrayed, it may mean that the primitive Sumerian population of Chaldsea was really black-skinned.

and another hymn which is addressed to the Sun-god.
Let us hear what the latter has to say to us :
l
" lord, the illuminator of darkness, thou that openest the face
of the sick !
MercifuJ god, planter of the lowly, supporter of the weak,
Unto thy light look the great gods, The spirits of the earth all behold thy face.
The language of hosts as one word thou directest,
Smiting their heads they behold the light of the midday sun.
Like a wife thou behavest thyself, cheerful and rejoicing,
Yea, thou art their light in the vault of the far-off sky. In the broad earth thou art their illumination.
Men far and wide behold thee and rejoice. The mighty gods have smellcd a sweet savour,
The holy food of heaven, the wine (of the sacrifice) .... Whosoever has not turned his hand to wickedness ....
They shall eat the food (he offers, shall receive the sacrifice he
makes ?)."
Like Merodach, the Sun-god also is " the merciful god."
Like Merodach, too, it is to him that gods and men alike
turn their gaze. Even the power of Merodach of raising
the dead to life is ascribed to him. A hymn to Samas
the Sun-god begins with the following words :
" Sun-god, king of heaven and earth, director of things above
and below, Sun-god, thou that clothest the dead with life, delivered by thy
hands, Judge unbribed, director of mankind, Supreme is the mercy of him who is the lord over difficulty,
Bidding the child and offspring come forth, light of the world,
Creator of all thy universe, the Sun-god art thou." 2
May we not conclude, then, that originally Merodach
also was a solar deity, the particular Sun-god, in fact, whose worship was carried on at Babylon ?
1 W A. I. iv. 19, 2. * S 947, Obv. 3—8.



BEL-MERODACH OF BABYLON. 101
The conclusion is verified by the express testimony of
the ritual belonging to Merodach/ s temple E-Sagila. Here
we read that
" In the month Nisan, on the second Jay, two hours after nightfall, the priest must come and take of the waters of the river, must enter
into the presence of Lei ; and putting on a stole in the presence of
Bel, must say this prayer : '0 Bel, who in his strength has no equal ! Bel, hlessed sovereign, lord of the world, seeking after the favour of
the great gods, the lord who in his glance has destroyed the strong, lord of kings, light of mankind, estahlisher of faith ! Bel, thy sceptre is Babylon, thy crown is Borsippa, the wide heaven is the dwelling-place of thy liver .... lord of the v/orld, light of the spirits of heaven, utterer of blessings, who is there whose mouth murmurs not of thy
righteousness, or speaks not of thy glory, and celebrates not thy dominion ? lord of the world, who dwellest in the temple of the Sun,
reject not the hands that are raised to thee ; be merciful to thy city
Babylon, to E-Sagila thy temple incline thy face ; grant the prayers of thy people the sons of Babylon.'" 1
Nothing can be more explicit than the statement that
E-Sagila, the temple of Merodach, was also the temple
of the Sun. We thus come to understand the attributes
that are ascribed to Merodach and the language that is
used of him. He is " the light of the spirits of heaven,"
even as the Sun-god, in the hymn I quoted just now, is "the illuminator of darkness" whose face is beheld by
the spirits of the earth. The wide heaven is naturally
his dwelling-place, and he raises the dead to life as the
sun of spring revivifies the dead vegetation of winter.
The part that he plays in the old mythological poems, in the poems, that is, which embody the ancient myths
and legends of Babylonia, is now fully explained. One of the most famous of these was the story of the combat
between Merodach and Tiamat, the dragon of darkness
1 W. A. I. iv. 4G. For a fuller account of this hymn, see above, p. 80,



102 LECTURE II.
;iik1 chaos. Merodach advances to the fight armed with
a club and bow which Ami had placed in his hand and
which subsequently became a constellation, as well as
with his own peculiar weapon which hung behind his
back. It was shaped like a sickle, and is the <V->? or
khereb with which Greek mythology armed the Asiatic
hero Perseus. The struggle was long and terrible.
Tiamat opened her mouth to swallow the god, but he
thrust a storm-wind down her throat, and the monster
was burst asunder, while her allies fled in terror before
the victorious deity. The combat is represented in stone
in one of the Assyrian bas-reliefs now in the British
Museum. There we can see the demon as she appeared
to the Assyrians, with claws and wings, a short tail, and
horns upon the head. When we remember the close
parallelism that exists between this conflict of Merodach
with Tiamat, and the Avar recorded in the Apocalypse
between Michael and "the great dragon," it is difficult
not to trace in the lineaments of Tiamat the earliest por
traiture of the mediaeval devil.
Another myth in which Merodach again appears as
champion of the bright powers of day in their eternal
struggle against night and storm, is the myth which
describes in but thinly-veiled language the eclipse of the
moon. We are there told how " the seven wicked spirits,
the seven ministers of storm and tempest, who had been
created in the lower part of heaven," assailed the Moon
god as he sat in his appointed scat. His comrades, the
Sun-god and the Evening Star whom " Eel" had enjoined
to share with him the sovereignty of the " lower heaven"
or visible sky, fled from before the coming attack, and Sin,
the Moon-god, was left alone to face his enemies. But



BEL-MERODACH OF BABYLON. 103
" Bel" beheld "the eclipse" of the lord of night, and
Merodach was sent to rescue him and restore ouce again
the light of the moon. Arrayed in " glistening armour," with a helmet of "light like fire" upon his head, he went
forth accordingly against the powers of darkness, and the battle ended in his favour, like that against the dragon.
The Bel of this legend, who has settled the places of
the Sun and the Moon in the sky, is not the Babylonian
Bel, but the older Bel of Xipur, from whom Merodach,
the Bel of Babylon, had afterwards to be distinguished.
The Accadian original of the poem belongs to a very
early epoch, before the rise of Babylon, when the supreme Bel of the Semitic inhabitants of Babylonia was still the
god whom the Accadians called Mul-lilla, " the lord of
the lower world." This Bel or Mul-lilla fades into the
background as the Semitic element in Babylonian religion
became stronger and the influence of Babylon greater,
though the part that he played in astronomical and cos
mological lore, as well as his local cult at Nipur, kept
his memory alive ; while the dreaded visitants of night,
the demoniac Ulii and lilat or lilith, from the lower world,
preserved a faint memory of the spirits of which he had
once been the chief. One by one, however, the attributes
that had formerly attached to the older Bel were absorbed
by the younger Bel of Babylon. It was almost as it was
in Greece, where the older gods were dethroned by their
own offspring ; in the Babylonia of Nebuchadnezzar and
Nabonidos, it was the }^ounger gods—Merodach, Sin and
Samas—to whom vows were the most often made and
prayer the most often ascended. Such was the latest
result of the local character of Babylonian worship : the
younger gods were the gods of the younger Babylonian



104 LECTURE ll.
cities, and the god of Babylon, though he might be termed " the first-born of the gods," was in one sense
the youngest of them all.
The title, however, "first-born of the gods" was of
the same nature as the other title, " prince of the world,"
bestowed upon him by his grateful worshippers. It meant little else than that Babylon stood at the head of
the world, and that its god must therefore be the first
born, not of one primaeval deity, but of all the primaeval deities acknowledged in Chaldsea. According to the
earlier faith, he was the first-born of Ea only. Ea was
god of the deep, both of the atmospheric deep upon which the world floats, and of that watery deep, the
Okeanos of Homer, which surrounds the earth like a
coiled serpent. All streams and rivers were subject to
his sway, for they flowed into that Persian Gulf which
the ignorance of the primitive Chaldsean imagined to be the oc( an-stream itself. It was from the Persian Gulf
that tradition conceived the culture and civilisation of
Babylonia to have come, and Ea was therefore lord of
wisdom as well as lord of the deep. His son Merodach
was the minister of his counsels, by whom the commands
of wisdom were carried into practice. Merodach was
thus the active side of his father Ea ; to use the language
of Gnosticism, he was the practical activity that emanates from wisdom.
Ea, however, was not the god of Babylon, nor was
his name of Semitic origin. He watched over the des
tinies of '-the holy city" of Eridu, now Abu-Shahrein,
which stood in early days on the very shores of the
Persian Gulf. How Merodach came to be regarded as
his son we can only guess. Perhaps Babylon had been



BEL-MERODACH OF BABYLON. 105
a colony of Eridu ; perhaps it was from Etidu that the
culture associated with the name of Ea first made its
way to Babylon. We must be content with the fact
that from time immemorial Merodach had been the first
born of Ea, and that therefore between Eridu and Babylon
a very close connection must have existed in pre-historic
times.
Was Merodach himself an Accadian or a Semitic deity ?
The names of the kings belonging to the first dynasty of
Babylon are mostly Semitic ; it might therefore be sup
posed that the deity they worshipped was Semitic also. And so undoubtedly was the Merodach of the historical
age. the great Bel or Baal of Babylon. But we must
remember that the foundation of Babylon went back
into the dim night of the past far beyond the era of its
first dynasty of Semitic kings, and that its very name
was but a translation of the older Ka-dimira, "gate of
the god." The temple of Merodach, moreover, bore, up
to the last, not a Semitic, but an Accadian designation. As we shall see, along with the older culture the
Semitic settlers in Babylonia borrowed a good deal of
the theology of the Accadian people, modifying it in accordance with their own beliefs, and identifying its
gods and demons with their own Baalim. It would not
be surprising, then, if we found that Merodach also had
once been an Accadian divinity, though his attributes,
and perhaps also his name, differed very considerably from those of the Semitic Bel. Even after the Romans
had identified their Saturn with the Kronos of the
Greeks, the essential characteristics of the two deities
remained altogether different.
In the legend of the assault of the seven evil spirits



1(JG LECTURE II.
upon the Moon—a legend which, unlike the hymns to
Merodaeh, goes back to the pre-Semitic epoch—the god whom the Semitic translator has identified with Merodaeh
is called in the Acradian original Asari-uru-duga, " the
chief who does good to man." He receives his title
from the fact that, like the Semitic Merodaeh, he is the
son of Ea, from whom he conve}Ts to mankind the charms
and philtres and other modes of healing and help which
a belief in sorcery invented. But there is little that is
solar about him. On the contrary, he is distinguished
from the Sun-god; and if he fights against the storm
demons with his helmet of light, it is because he is one
of the bright powers of day who benefit mankind. The
fire-god is his minister, but he is himself little more
than the personified agency avIio carries the wisdom of
Ea to gods and men. It is in this way that he is
regarded as the god of life : the spells taught him by Ea are able, if need be, to recover the sick and raise even
the dead to life. Hence he receives the title of Asari
nam-tila, "the chief of life." The title, however, was
justified only by the creed of the sorcerer, not yet by the worship of the solar Bel, the "merciful" lord.
Whether the name Maruduk (Merodaeh) were Accadian
or Semitic in origin, I cannot say. If it is Semitic, it
lias so changed its form that its etymology is no longer
recognisable. It may be merely a Semitic transformation
of the Accadian Uru-dug, "benefactor of man;" in any
case, its origin was already forgotten in the days when
the Babylonians first began to speculate on the derivation
of their words. When first we meet with it in Semitic
texts, it is expressed by two ideographs, which read
Amar-ud, " the heifer of day." This is a punning refer



PEL-MERODACH OF BABYLON. 107
ence to the old Accadiau notion of the sky as a ploughed
field through which the Sun drew the share in his
annual journey. Under this aspect, the Sun was termed
by the Accadians Gudibir, "the bull of light;" hence
when Merodach became a Sun-god, he was identified
with the ancient Gudibir, and astrology taught that he
was one and same with each of the twelve zodiacal signs. 1
We have thus been able, in spite of the imperfection
of our documents, to trace the history of the patron-god of Babylon from the time when he was as yet merely
the interpreter of the Accadian Ea, merely a water-spirit rising with the dawn out of the Persian Gulf, to the
time when he became the Semitic Sun-god Bel, and
eventually the head of the Babylonian Pantheon. But
we have seen at the same time that up to the last he
remained essentially local in character ; if he was lord of
the other gods, it was only because the king of Babylon
was lord also of other cities and lands. It is not until
1 Halevy has proposed to see in the name of Maruduk the Semitic mar-utuki, "the lord of demons." This, however, is worse than the Assyrian play upon the name, and takes no account of the fact that
viaru in Assyro-Babylonian means only " son," never " lord," and that irfuki contains a t and not a d. In W. A. I. ii 48, 34, the Sun-god, it
is true, is called Utuki, but this word has nothing to do with udu, " the
day," but is the Accadian utulc or "spirit." The Sun-god, in fact, was
addressed as "the great spirit." If a conjecture is permitted, I would propose to see in Maruduk a Semitised form of the Accadian Mum-dug,
" he who benefits man," the Asari of the full title being omitted. Muni,
whence uru, " man," is a dialectic side-form of mulu. But the vowel of the first syllable of Maruduk creates a difficulty, and since the Baby
lonians had forgotten the origin of the name, it is nut likely that we shall be more successful than they were in discovering it. Perhaps
Delitzsch is right (Wo lag das Paradies, p. 22S) in seeing in Maruduk mar-Urudug, "the son of Eridu." At all events, Merodach is called '•the son of Eridu" in \Y. A. I. iv. 8, 41, and other places. Maruduk is frequently con*ract«*d into Marduk.



108 LECTURE II.
Babylonia erases to be an independent power tout this
Jocal conception of the great Babylonian divinity tends
to disappear. At Babylon, Cyrus, the foreigner from F.lam, becomes the favourite and the worshipper of
Bel-Merodach, and the priests of Merodach even pretend that he had been the god? s favourite before he came to
Babylon as its master and conqueror. Although, there
fore, it is only in Babylonia that Merodach is the god of
Cyrus, as he had been the god of Nebuchadnezzar, the
foot that Cyrus was not a Babylonian necessarily enlarged the old conception of Bel and gave to him a universal
character. From this time onwards, Merodach was more
and more the god, not of the Babylonians alone, but of
all men everywhere ; when the Greek kings of Asia
caused inscriptions to be written in the Babylonian
language and writing, Merodach takes the place of Zeus,
and, as the grandson of Aua or Eoa, "the dawn," is identified with the Memnon of Homeric story. 1
1 In the cuneiform inscription of Antiokhos SotGr, published by Strassmaier in the Verliandlungen des fun/ten Orientalwten-Conpresses, ii. 1, pp. 139—142, Merodach is called (1. 20) "the offspring of the
god who is the son of Aua" (Abil Aua). In lines 34 — 36, Xebo is called "the son of E-Saggil, the first-born of Asari the chief (ristu), the offspring of the god who is the son of Aua the queen." Here Aua is represented as a goddess, and since her son was the father of Mero
dach, she must correspond to the goddess Zikum of the earl}- texts. Halcvy, confounding her with Ea, has gone on to identify Ea with the
Hebrew Yahveh — an identification which, it is needless to say, is
phonetically impossible. Aua is obviously the Greek Eoa, either the accusative of 'Hws or the feminine of the corresponding adjective. From the time of Ktesias, Memndn, the son of the goddess Eos, had been made an Assyro-IJabylonian prince, and the resemblance of the name of Ea to Eos may have suggested the idea of associating him with Merodach, the lord of Babylon. Teutamos, with his double Teu tocos, the king by whom, according to Kt&iias, Memnon was sent to the help of Priam, is simply "the man of the sea" or tavtim, the uauie by



BEL-MERODACII OF BABYLON. 109
But already before the age of Cyrus there was one
portion of the Assyro-Baby Ionian world in which the
narrower local view of Merodach had perforce disap
peared. This was Assyria. The local gods of Babylonia had been carried into Assyria by its Semitic settlers, or
else introduced into the cultivated circle of the court
by the literary classes of later days. Merodach was
necessarily among the latter. Certain of the Assyrian kings, or at least their scribes, invoke Merodach with the
same fervour as the kings of Babylon. Shalmaneser II.
calls him " the prince of the gods/' just as a pious Babylonian would have done ; and the monarchs of the second
Assyrian empire, who were crowned at Babylon as the German princes were crowned at Rome, consider them
selves placed by the act under the patronage of the
Babylonian god. 1 Although, therefore, the earlier Assyrian kings avoid the mention of Merodach, and the
introduction of his name into a specifically Assyrian in
scription is due either to the affectation of learning or to
a claim to the throne of Babylon, the very fact that the
name was introduced altered the conception under which
which the sea-coast of Babylonia, with its capital Eridu, was known.
Aua has, of course, nothing to do with the god An, "the wind," a title of Rimmon, which forms part of the proper name Au-nahdi (K 344. 6).
1 To "take the hand of Bel" was equivalent to recognition as king
of Babylon. Possibly it denoted that the person who performed the ceremony had entered the holy of holies in which the imago of Bel
Merodach stood—an act permitted only to the high-priest or the king in his office of high-priest (sdkkandku). The sakkanaJcu is sometimes identical with the king, sometimes distinguished from the king (e.g.
W. A. I. i. 64. ix. 64), and the sdkkanalcu of Babylon wai a special
title (thus Esarhaddon calls himself " saManalcu of Babylon," but
"king of Sumer and Accad," TV. A. I. i. 48, Xo. C). Like iangu, the
word expressed servitude to the god.



110 LECTURE IT.
Merodach was regarded, and loosened the bonds of his
connection with a particular locality. In Assyria at least, Bel-Merodach was as much a universal god as the
older gods of the celestial hierarchy.
This transformation of his nature was aided by the
inevitable confusion that arose between Bel-Merodach
and the older Bel. To such an extent Avas this confusion
carried, that we find Assur-bani-pal describing Merodach
as "Bel, the son of Bel." When such a statement
could be made in the learned court of Assur-bani-pal, it
is clear that to the ordinary Assyrian "the son of Ea"
of ancient Babylonian belief had been absorbed into the
solar Bel, the supreme divinity of the southern kingdom. Even at Babylon, however, Merodach did not stand
alone. He shared his divine honours, as we have seen,
with his wife Zarpanitu and his son Xebo. The old
Accadian cult seems to have had a fancy for trinities or
triads, originating perhaps in the primary astronomical
triad of the Sun-god, the Moon-god and the Evening Star. The Accadian triad usually consisted of male
deities. The Semites, however, as I hope to point out in the next Lecture, introduced a new idea, that of sex,
into the theology of the country. Every god was provided with his female reflection, who stood to him in the
relation of the wife to the husband. Baal, accordingly,
had his female reflex, his "face" as it was termed, Bilat
or Belt is. By the side of the Baal of Babylon, therefore,
st I Beltis, "the lady'* by the side of her "lord."
Her local name was Zarpanitu, which a punning etymo
logy subsequently turned into Zir-banitu, " creatress of seed," 1 sometimes written Zir-panitu, with an obvious

play on tiie word panu, or " face." Zarpanitu was of
purely Semitic origin. But she was identified with an
older Accadian divinity, Gasmu, "the wise one,
1 ' 1 the
fitting consort of a deity whose office it was to convey
the wishes of the god of wisdom to suffering lnimanity.
The Accadian goddess, however, must originally have stood rather in the relation of mother than of wife to the
primitive Merodach. She was entitled "the lady of the
deep," " the mistress of the abode of the fish," and " the
voice of the deep." 2 Hence she must have ranked by
the side of Ea, the fish-god and " lord of the deep ;" and
in the title " voice" or " incantation of the deep," we ma)'
see a reference to the ideas which caused Ea to become
the god of wisdom, and brought the fish-god Oannes out of the Persian Gulf to carry culture and knowledge to
the inhabitants of Chaldiea. In the roar of the sea-waves,
the early dwellers on the shores of the Gulf must have
heard the voice of heaven, and their prophets and diviners
must have discovered in it a revelation of the will of the
gods. It is not surprising, therefore, if Zarpanit was
specially identified with the goddess Lakhamun, who was worshipped in the sacred island of Dilmun, or with the
goddess Elagu, whose name was revered in the mountains
of Elam. 3

2 W. A. I. ii. 54. 62, 55, 57. Other titles were " the lady of the city of Kurnnn," though "the goddess Kuriran" was identified with Tasmit (W. A. I. ii. 48, 39), and Era or Erua (W. A. I. ii. 54. 60, 59, S 1720, 2). It is probable that she was identified with Nina the fish
goddess, the daughter of Ea. 3 W. A. I. ii. 54. 58, 65. The name is probably connected with that of the cosmogonic deities Lakhma and Lakhaina, with the same



112 LECTURE It
In Semitic days, Zarpanit, the inheritor of all these
old traditions and worships, fell from her high estate.
She ceased to be the goddess of wisdom, the voice of the
deep revealing the secrets of heaven to the diviner and
priest; she became merely the female shadow and com
panion of Merodach, to whom a shrine was erected at the
entrance to his temple. Her distinctive attributes all
belong to the pre-Semitic epoch ; with the introduction
of a language which recognised gender, she was lost in
the colourless throng of Ashtaroth or Baalat, the god
desses who were called into existence by the masculine
Baalim.
Zarpanit, however, had something to do with the pro
minence given to Nebo in the Babylonian cult. Nebo,
the son of Merodach and Zarpanitu, had, as we have
seen, a chapel called E-Zida within the precincts of the
great temple of his father. E-Zida, " the constituted
house," derived its name from the great temple of Bor
sippa, the suburb of Babylon, the ruins of which are
now known to travellers as the Birs-i-Nimriid. Borsippa,
it would seem, had once been an independent town, and
Nebo, or the prototype of Xebo, had been its protecting
deity. In the middle of the city rose E-Zida, the temple
of Nebo and Nana Tasmit, with its holy of holies, "the
supreme house of life," and its lofty tower termed "the
house of the seven spheres of heaven and earth.*' It
had been founded, though never finished, according to
Nebuchadnezzar, by an ancient king. For long centuries it had remained a heap of ruin, until restored by Nebu
chadnezzar, and legends had grown up thickly around
termination as that which Ave find in the name of Dilniun or Dilvnn itself



BEL-MERODACH OF BABYLON. 113
it. It was known as the tul ellu, "the pure" or " holy
mound," and one of the titles of Nebo accordingly was
" god of the holy mound." 1
The word Nebo is the Semitic Babylonian Nabiu or
Nabii. It means "the proclaimer," "the prophet," and
thus indicates the character of the god to whom it was
applied. Nebo was essentially the proclaimer of the mind and wishes of Merodach. He stood to Merodach
in the same relation that an older mythology regarded
Merodach as standing to Ea. While Merodach was
rather the god of healing, in accordance with his primi
tively solar nature, Nebo was emphatically the god of science and literature. The communication of the gifts
of wisdom, therefore, which originally emanated from Ea, was thus shared between Merodach and his son. At
Babylon, the culture-god of other countries was divided
into two personalities, the one conveying to man the wisdom that ameliorates his condition, the other the
knowledge which finds its expression in the art of writing. This division was due to the local character of Baby
lonian religion which I have tried to bring into relief.
"When Babylon became the centre of the Babylonian
monarchy, Borsippa was already its suburb. But the
suburb had a past life and history of its own, which
gathered round its great temple and the god who was
worshipped there. When, therefore, Borsippa was ab

great" or secret " names of Anu" (W. A. I. iii. 68, 19), while " the goi doss of the holy mound" was Istar (iii. 68, 27).

sorbed into Babylon, its god was absorbed at the same
time; he became one of the triad worshipped by the
pious Babylonian, and was accounted the son of the god
of the larger city. But he still retained the proud title
of bilu asaridu, " the first-born Baal j" 1 and it is possible
that the true signification of the name of his sanctuary
is not "the constituted house," but "house of the con
stituted'' or " legitimate son." 2 Up to the last, moreover, Nebo maintained all his local rights. He was domesti
cated, it is true, in Babylon, but he continued to be the
god of Borsippa, and it was there that his true and
original temple lifted its tower to the sky.3
We have only to glance over the titles which wore
given to Nebo to see how thoroughly the conception of "the prophet" was associated with that of "the writer."
He is not only "the wise," "the intelligent," "the creator of peace," "the author of the oracle;" 4 he is
also "the creator of the written tablet," "the maker of
writing," "the opener" and " enlarger of the ear." 5
Assur-bani-pal is never weary of telling us, at the end of the documents his scribes had copied from their Baby
lonian originals, that "Nebo and Tasrait had given him
broad ears (and) endowed (him) with seeing eyes," so that

R. A. S. xii. 2, 1880). Zag, it seems, signified "first-born" in the language of Dilvun. The proper name of the god of Dilvun to whom the title was given wa3 Pati (K 104), or Wuati (W. A. I. ii. 54, 67), as it is also written.

he had " written, bound together and published the store of tablets, a work which none of the kings who had gone
before had undertaken, even the secrets of Nebo, the list
of characters as many as exist." In the literary dialect
of the Semitic epoch, Nebo went by the Accadian name
of dim-sar, "the scribe," and the ideograph by which he is sometimes denoted was regarded by the Semitic
literati as signifying "the maker of intelligence" and
"the creator of writing." 1
These, however, were not the only titles that Nebo
bore. He was also "the bond of the universe," and
"the overseer of the angel-hosts of heaven and earth." 2
The latter office might be explained as derived from his
duties as scribe of the gods ; but it is hard to discover
what connection there could be between the first title
and his association with literature. Light is thrown
upon it, however, by the fact that the ziggurrat or tower
of his temple at Borsippa had the name of "the house
of the seven bonds of heaven and earth." The seven
"bonds" seem to represent the seven planets, or rather
their stations ; the tower was in seven stages, and each
stage was painted so as to symbolise the colours sjm
bolical of the several planets. Nebo must, therefore,
have once been an elemental god, or at all events a
god connected with the chief of the heavenly bodies.
We know that Babylonian astronomy made him the
presiding deity of the planet Mercury, just as it made
Merodach the presiding deity of Jupiter; but it cannot
have been in reference to this that the tower of his

i2



116 LECTURE II.
templo was dedicated to the seven heavenly spheres. Xcbo cannot well have been one of the seven himself in
the conception of its builders ; he must rather have been
the universe in which the seven spheres were set.
We shall thus reach the true explanation of the ideo
graph by which he was commonly denoted, and which
has been translated " the maker of wisdom," "the creator
of writing," by the Semitic scribes. But such translations
are mere glosses. The ideograph signifies nothing more than "maker" or "creator," and points to a time when
the local god of Borsippa was something more than the
son of Merodach and the patron of the literary class.
He was, in the belief of his worshippers at Borsippa, the supreme god, the creator of the world.
Now there are traces of an old Accadian notion of the
universe according to which "the deep" was a flowing
stream which surrounded the earth like the Okeanos of
Homer. It was sometimes compared to a snake, some
times to a rope, and was then called "the rope of the
great god." The spirit or deity who personified it was
Innlna. 1 (In)nina seems to be the divinity who in later
days was assumed to have given a name to Nineveh, and
the name is to be explained as meaning " the god Xin,"
1 W. A. I. ii. 51, 45 — 49, where " the river of the snake" is described
ns being also " the river of the rope of the great god," " the river of the
great deep," " the river of the sheepcote of the ghost-world," and " the
river of Innina." In 82. 8 — 16, 1, Obc. 5, innana is given as the Acca
dian pronunciation of the ideograph denoting "a goddess," the initial syllable being only a weakening of the determinative an,- "divinity." Nina and Nana. are. merely dialectic forms of the same word, which in
the genderless Accadian meant indifferently " lord" and " lady," though more usually "lady." Nina seems to have been the pronunciation of the word at Eridu, Nana at Erecb, At all events Nina vas, the
daughter of Ea.



BEL-MERODACH OF BABYLON. 117
or "the divine lord," just as Innana means "the goddess
Nana," " the divine lady." It will be remembered that
the worship of Nana was associated with that of Nebo in
his temple at Borsippa. The name of Borsippa itself, moreover, is sometimes written in a punning fashion by
the help of ideographs which would read in Accadian
Bat-si-aabba, " the fortress of the horn of the sea," as if
it had once been held to stand on a "horn" or inlet of
the Persian Grulf. It is therefore possible that Innina
may have been the primitive Nebo of Borsippa, and that, like the Ea of southern Babylonia, he may have been
regarded as himself the great " deep." If so, we should
have an explanation of his title "the bond" or "rope of
the universe," that ocean-stream, in fact, which seemed to bind together the heavens and the earth. It seems to
be the same as "the bond" or "rope of the world" com
memorated by Accadian mythology (W. A. I. ii. 29, 62),
in curious parallelism to "the golden cord" of Homer
(II. viii. 19), which Zeus offered to let the other gods
hang from heaven to earth, in the vain endeavour to drag
him down from the upper end of it.
How the old demiurgic god of Borsippa, the symbolisation of the deep which wound like a rope round the
nether world, became the prophet-god Nebo of the
Semites, is difficult to understand. There is apparently
no connection between them. The prophet- god of the
Accadians was Tutu, the setting sun, who is said to
"prophesy before the king." The legends, however, which attached themselves to the name of Ea show that
the Accadians associated together the ideas of wisdom
and of that primordial deep of which the Persian Gulf
was the visible manifestation ; in so far, therefore, as the



118 LECTURE II.
primitive god of Borsippa was the deep, he might also have been considered to have been the author of know
ledge and intelligence. Indeed, as creator of the uni
verse he must have been credited with a certain degree
of wisdom.
It is possible, however, that the mediation between the
demiurge of Borsippa and the Semitic Xebo was due to
a confusion of the latter with an entirely different god
named Nuzku. Nuzku probably signified in Accadian
"the brilliance of the daybreak;" at all events he was a
solar deity, one of whose titles was "lord of the zenith;"
and in the cuneiform texts his name is often used to denote
the zenith, or elat same, "height of heaven," as it was
called in Assyrian, in opposition to the god of the horizon. 1
Now the ideograph which denoted "the daybreak," and
was frequently used to represent the name of Xuzku.
happened also to denote a leaf; and since the Accadians
had written upon the leaves and rind of the papyrus
before they began to write on clay, it was employed with
a certain determinative to denote the stylus or pen of the
scribe. Hence Xuzku, the god of the zenith, became also
ivliadh, the god of the scribe's pen.
Xuzku, however, docs not appear to have belonged
originally to Borsippa. He is entitled "the messenger"
or "angel of Mnl-lil," 2 the older Bel; and it was only
1 See "W. A. I. ii. Is, r>.~>. The phrase is frequent, " From the horizon
(the god Ue) to the zenith (the god Nuzlcu)." In ii. 54, 73, the god
Ur is identified with Nebo ; hence Nebo and Xuzku will have heen regarded as two different phases of the Sun-god, Nebo being the Sun of the dawn, and Xuzku the Sun of midday.
- W.A.I, ii. 19, 56. In R 2. 1, 159, 5, Xuzku is called "the
supreme messenger of E-kur." The amalgamation of Nebo and Xuzku was no doubt aided by the fact that while Xuzku was thus the iuea



BEL-MERODACH OF BABYLON. 1 1 9
when the older 13el of Nipur became merged in the
younger Bel-Merodach of Babylon, that Xuzku followed
the fortunes of his master and was himself domesticated
in the city of the younger Bel. When the transformation
was finally completed, three separate deities found them
selves united in the divine patron of the literary class. 1
Wherever the literary class went, Xebo their patron
went with them. Xebo consequently became less local
in character than the other divinities of the pantheon, a
result that was further encouraged by the absorption of
his city of Borsippa into the larger Babylon. It is not
surprising, therefore, that Xebo showed a greater tendency to migration than the older and more definitely localised
deities of Babylonia. A knowledge of Babylonian letters
and learning was accompanied by a knowledge of the
senger of Mul-lil the older Bel, Xebo was the prophet and messenger of Merodach the younger Bel. The confusion between the two Eels led necessarily to a confusion between their two ministers.
1 Up to the last, however, the priesthood of Babylon remembered that Xebo and Xuzku were originally different divinities. In the great temple of Merodach there was a separate chapel for Xuzku by the side of the great tower. Xuzku originally appears to have come from Xipur and to have been identified with Xebo when the latter came to sharo witb Merodach his solar character. But originally the local god of
Borsippa, who as the supreme deity of the place was worshipped by the inhabitants as the creator of the universe, was not the Sun-god, but the power which bound the universe together. As this was the ocean-stream which encircled the horizon and was the home of the
rising sun, it was not difficult to confound it with the morning sun
itself. It seems s'.range that Xuzku, the messenger of "the lord of the
ghost-world," and as such the morning-grey, should have come to represent the zenith ; bat the same transference of meaning meets us in the
Assyrian verb napalchu, which properly refers to the rising sun, but
is also used of the zenith. That Xuzku, " who goes on the left of the
companions of the king," was primarily the Fire-god is expressly stated
in K 170, Rev. 5

Babylonian god of letters and learning. In Assyria, Xcbo was honoured as much as lie was in Babylonia
itself. The Assyrian kings and scribes might be silent
about the name of Merodach, but the name of Nebo was
continually in their mouths. 1 His name and worship
passed even to the distant Semitic tribes of the west.
The names of places in Palestine in which his name
occurs, proves that the god of prophecy was adored by Canaanites and Moabites alike. Moses, the leader and
prophet of Israel, died on the peak of Mount Xebo, and cities bearing the name stood within the borders of the
tribes of Eeuben and Judah. When the Israelites entered
upon their literary era. the old name of roeh, or " seer,"
Mas exchanged for the more literary one of JYebi, or
"prophet."
The Semites of Babylonia provided Xebo with a wife,
Tasmitu, "the hearer." She helped to open and enlarge the ears which received the divine mysteries her husband's
inspiration enabled his devout servants to write down.
The revolution which transferred the learning of the
Babylonians from the Accadians to the Semites, trans
ferred the patronage of the literary class from the old
god Ea to his younger rivals Nebo and Tasmit.
I have dwelt thus long on the nature and history of
the three deities who shared together the great temple
of Babylon, partly because our materials in regard to
them are less imperfect than is the case with many oi
the other gods, partly because they illustrate so well the
essentially local character of Babylonian religion. It is
1 In the prayer to Assur, K 100, Rev. 18. Nebo is called "the messenger of Assur," who thus takes the place of Mcrodach of Babylon.



BEL-MERODACH OF BABYLON. 121
this which gives to it its peculiar complexion and fur
nishes the key to its interpretation. In so far as the
worship of Ncbo forms an exception to the general rule, it is an exception which bears out the old legal maxim
that the exception proves the rule. The worship of Xebo
was less local than that of other divinities, because he
was specially worshipped by a class which existed in each
of the local centres of the country. He alone was the
god of a class rather than of a locality. Babylonian
history began with separate cities, and centralisation was
never carried so far as to break up the local usages and
cults that prevailed in them. In the eyes of the people,
the several deities remained to the last a body of equals,
among whom the god of the imperial city presided, simply because he was the god of the imperial city. If Ur had
taken the place of Babylon, the Moon-god of Ur would
have taken the place of Bel-Merodach. The gods of
Babylonia were like the local saints of Catholic Europe,
not like the Greek hierarchy of Olympus, ruled by the
despotic nod of Zeus.
The Semites of Babylonia thus closely resembled their
brother Semites of Canaan in their fundamental concep
tion of religion. As the Canaanitc or Phoenician had
" lords many," the multitudiuous Baalim who repre
sented the particular forms of the Sun-god worshipped in each locality, so too the gods of Semitic Babylonia were
equally multitudinous and local—Merodach, for example,
being merely the Bel or Baal of Babylon, just as Melkarth (Melech-kiryath) was the Baal of Tyre. But the
parallelism extends yet further. We have seen that the
rise of the prophet-god in Babylonia marks the growing
importance of literature and a literary class, just as the



122 LECTURE II.
beginning of a literary age in Israel is coeval with the
change of the seer into the prophet. Xow the literary
age of Israel was long preceded by a literary age among
their Phoenician neighbours, and its growth is contem
poraneous with the closer relations that grew up between
the monarchs of Israel and Hiram of Tyre. What Israel
was in this respect to the Phoenicians, Assyria was to Babylonia. The Assyrians were a nation of warriors and
traders rather than of students; their literature was for
the most part an exotic, a mere imitation of Babylonian
culture. In Babylonia, education was widely diffused :
in Assyria, it was confined to the learned class. We must
remember, therefore, that in dealing with Assyrian docu
ments we are dealing either with a foreign importation or with the thoughts and beliefs of a small and special
class.
This is the class from whom we have to gain our know
ledge of the form of religion prevalent in Assyria. It
is wholly Babylonian, with one important exception.
Supreme over the old Babylonian pantheon rises the
figure of a new god, the national deity of Assyria, its
impersonation Assur. Assur is not merely primus inter
pares, merely the president of the divine assembly, like Merodach; he is their lord and master in another and
more autocratic sense. Like the Yahveh of Israel, he
claims to be "king above all gods," that "among all
gods" there is none like unto himself. In his name and
through his help the Assyrian kings go forth to conquer;
the towns they burn, the men they slay, the captives
they take, are all his gifts. It is to destroy " the enemies
of Assur," and to lay their yoke upon those who disbelieve
in his name, that they lead their armies into other lands;



BEL-MERODACH OF BABYLON. 123
it is his decrees, his law, that they write upon the monu
ments they erect in conquered countries. The gods of
] labylonia are invoked, it is true ; their old Babylonian titles are accorded to them ; they arc called upon to curse
the sacrilegious in the stereotyped phrases of the ancient
literature ; but it is Assur, and Assur alone, to whom the
Assyrian monarch turns in moments of distress; it is
Assur, and Assur alone, in whose name he subdues the
infidel. Only the goddess Istar finds a place by the side
of Assur.
It is not difficult to account for all this. In passing
from their native homes to Assyria, the Babylonian
deities lost that local character which was the very breath
of their existence. How far they owe their presence in
Assyrian literature to the literary class, how far they had
been brought from Babylonia in early days by the people
themselves, I am not prepared to say. One fact, however,
is clear ; in becoming Assyrian the Babylonian gods have lost both their definitencss and their rank. The invocations
addressed to them lack their old genuine ring, their titles
are borrowed from the literature of the southern kingdom,
and their functions are usurped by the new god Assur.
It is almost pitiable to find Bel-Merodach invoked, in
phrases that once denoted his power above other deities,
by the very kings who boast of their conquests over his
people, or who even razed his city to the ground. The
Assyrian, in fact, occupied much the same position as an
Israelite who, while recognising the supremacy of his
national God, thought it prudent or cultivated to offer
at the same time a sort of inferior homage to the Baalim
of Canaan.
At the outset, Assur was as much a purely local divinity



124 LECTURE II.
as Bel-Mcrodach of Babylon. He was the god of Assm
(now Kaleh-Sherghat),the primitive capital of the country. But several causes conspired to occasion him to lose this
purely local character, and to assume in place of it a
national character. The capital of Assyria was shifted
from Assur to Nineveh, and the worship of Assur, instead
of remaining fixed at Assur, was shifted at the same time.
Then, moreover, the importation of Babylonian deities had broken the close connection which existed in the
mind of a Babylonian between the deity and the city
where he was worshipped ; to the Assyrian, Bel-Merodach
was no longer peculiarly the patron-god of Babylon ; his other attributes came instead to the front. Assyria,
furthermore, from the time it first became an independent
kingdom, formed an homogeneous whole ; it was not
divided into separate states, as was so often the case with
Babylonia. A national feeling was consequently permitted to grow up, which the traditions of the old cities
of Chaldsea and the frequent conquest of the country by
foreigners prevented from developing in the south. Per
haps, too, the composite origin of Assur himself had
something to do with the result.
The name of Assur is frequently represented by a character which among other ideographic values had that
of "good." The name was accordingly explained by the Assyrians of the later historical age as "the good
god," with a reference perhaps to their own words asiru,
" righteous," and asirtu, "righteousness." But this was not the original signification either of the name or of the
character by which it was expressed. The god so denoted
was one of the primaeval deities of Babylonian cosmology
who bore in Accadian the title of Ana sar ( An-sar), " the



BEL-MERODACH OF BABYLON. 125
god of the host? of heaven," or simply Sar, "the upper firmament." It was believed that Ana sar was the male
principle which, by uniting with the female principle
(Ana) /ci-sar, "(the goddess of) the earth (and) the hosts
of heaven," produced the present world. It was to this old elemental deity that the great temple of E-sarra was
dedicated, whose son was said to be the god Ninip or
Adar.
A fragment of Babylonian eosmogomy has been preserved to us by Damaseius, a writer of the sixth century,
who had access to older materials now lost. Here Ana
sar and Ki-sar are called 'Ao-o-wpos and Kura-ap^ and Ave are
told of them that they were the offspring of the primaeval
Lakhma and Lakhama, and the progenitors of the three
supreme gods, Aim, Mul-lil and Ea. The worship of these primaeval divinities had been rooted in Assyria
from an early period ; probably the earliest Semitic emi
grants from the south found it already established there.
It wras inevitable that before long a confusion should
grow up between the name of the god An-sar or Assor,
and that of the city of Assur in which he was adored.
But the city of Assur had nothing to do with the god.
The name seems to be a corruption of the Accadian
A-usar, or "water-bank," first corrupted by its Semitic inhabitants into Assur and then into Asur, with a pos
sible reference to the word asurra, " the bed (of a river)."
1
1 The attempt has been made to show that the names of the god
and of the country might to be distinguished from one another by writing the first with ss and the second with a single s. The Assyrians, however, wrote both alike, sometimes with ss, sometimes with s ; and
the fact that the name of the country is often expressed by attaching the determinative affix of locality to the name of the god proves that
they were not conscious of any difference, phonetic oi- otherwise,



12 G LECTURE II.
The confusion between Assor the god and Assur the
city had the effect of identifying the god with his city
more closely than could be the case with the divine
patron of a Babylonian town. The city of Assur was
itself a god : offences against the city were offences
against the god ; the enemies of the city were the enemies
also of the god. The instinct, however, of regarding
the deities they worshipped as individuals, was too deeply implanted within the mind of the Semites to allow
cither this fact, or the further fact that the god himself
was originally a mere elemental one, to obliterate his
individual and anthropomorphic character. Though Assur
was the personification of the city, he was also its Baal
or lord.
The transference of the centre of power from Assur to
Nineveh made the anthropomorphic side of Assur's nature
still more prominent. He represented now the whole
nation and the central power which governed the nation.
He was thus the representative at once of the people
and of the king in whose hands the government of the
people was centred. Assyria became " the land of the
god Assur," belonging to him in much the same way as
the city of Babylon belonged to Bel-Merodach. But
whereas Bel-Merodach was the Baal of a particular city
only, Assur was, like the Yahveh of Israel, the national
god of a race.
There was yet another respect in which Assur resem
bled the Yahveh of Israel. There was no goddess Assur

between the two. In surh a matter we cannot be wiser than our Assyrian teachers.

side of Ann, a Beltis by the side of Eel. 1 If, in imita
tion of Babylonian usage, Bilat or Beltis is sometimes
addressed as the consort of Assur, it is simply a literary
affectation ; Assur was not a Bel or Baal, like Merodach.
Bilat is a Babylonian goddess ; she is properly the wife of the older Bel, in later times identified with Zarpanit.
There is no indication that Assur had a "face" or reflec
tion ; he stands by himself, and the inspiration received
from him by the Assyrian kings is received from him
alone. When a female divinity is invoked along with
him, it is the equally independent goddess Istar or Ashtorcth.
AVe possess a list of the deities whose images stood in
the temples of Assur at Assur and Nineveh. 2 At the
head of each list the name of Assur is thrice invoked,
and once his name is followed by that of Istar. There
was, in fact, a special form of Istar, under which she was
worshipped as "the Istar of Mneveh;" but the form
was purely local, not national, arising from the existence there of a great temple dedicated to her. There was no
national goddess to place by the side of the national god.
Assur consequently differs from the Babylonian gods, not only in the less narrowly local character that belongs
to him, but also in his solitary nature. He is "king of
all gods" in a sense in which none of the deities of Baby
lonia were. 3 He is like the king of Assyria himself,
1 If Istar is sometimes called Assuritu, " the Assyrian," the adjective is always a mere title, and never becomes a proper name (see W. A. I. v. 1, 65). Like the title "Istar of Nineveh," it serves only to distinguish the Assyrian Istar from the Istar of Arbela.

Lecture III.
THE GODS OF BABYLONIA
In my last Lecture I have been obliged to some extent
to anticipate the conclusions to which a survey of the
older literature of Babylonia will lead us. I have had
to refer more than once to the older gods of the land,
and to point out that the Babylonian deities of the later
inscriptions arc only in part of purely Semitic origin, in
part adaptations of earlier Accadian divinities. They
are characterised, however, by one common feature ; they
are all alike local, belonging to the cities where their
cults were established as literally as the temples in which
they were adored. Merodach might, indeed, be invoked
elsewhere than at Babylon, but it was only as god of
Babylon that he would hear the prayer. In Assyria alone we find another order of things, more analogous to
that which meets us among the Israelites ; in Babylonia
the gods arc local Baalim as fully as they were in Phoe
nicia. What differences may have existed between the
religious conceptions of the Phoenicians and Babylonians
in this respect were but superficial, due mainly to the fact that the Phoenician cities were never amalgamated
into a single empire, while Babylon succeeded in impos
ing its authority upon its sister towns.
There arc two ("specially ot the older gods whose names



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 131
have frequently recurred. These are Ea and the original
Bel. Let me speak of Ea first.
Ea, as we have already seen, was the god not only of the deep, but also of wisdom. Ancient legends affirmed
that the Persian Gulf—the entrance to the deep or ocean
stream—had been the mysterious spot from whence the
first elements of culture and civilisation had been brought
to Chaldrea. Berossos, the Chaldean historian—so at
least his epitomiser Alexander Polyhistor declared—had
reported them as follows :
" At Babylon there was a great resort of people of various races who
inhabited. Chaldsea, and lived in a lawless manner like the beasts of the
field. In the first year there appeared in that part of the Erythraean sea which borders upon Babylonia, a creature endowed with reason,
by name Oannes, whose whole body (according to the account o> Apollodoros) was that of a fish ; under the fish's head he had another
head, with feet also below similar to those of a man subjoined to the
fish's tail. His voice, too, and language were articulate and human ;
and a representation of him is preserved even to this day. " This being was accustomed to pas.s the dav among men, but took no food at that season ; and he gave them an insight into letters and
sciences and arts of every kind. He taught them to construct houses,
to found temples, to compile laws, and explained to them the principles
of geometrical knowledge. He made them distinguish the seeds of the earth, and showed them how to collect the fruits ; in short, he
instructed them in everything which could tend to soften manners and
humanise their lives. From that time, nothing material has been
added by way of improvement to his instructions. Now when the sun
had set, this being Oannes used to retire again into the sea, and pass
the night in the deep, for he was amphibious. After this there appeared other animals like Oannes, of which Berossos proposes to give an account when he comes to the history of the kings. Moreover, Oannes
wrote concerning the generation of mankind, of their different ways of life, and of their civil polity." 1
1 Eusebios {Ghron.), Cory's translation :
" The other animals like
Oannes," according to Abydenos (ap. Euseb. Ghron. i. 6, Mai), were Annedotos in the time of Amillaros, the third antediluvian king, called
k2



132 LECTURE III.
A native fragment of the legend has, it is probable,
been accidentally preserved among a series of extracts
from various Accadian works, in a bilingual reading-book compiled for the use of Semitic students of Accadian.
It reads thus :
"To the waters their god has returned ;
into the house of (his) repose the protector descended. 1 The wicked weaves spells, but the sentient one grows not old.
A wise people repeated his wisdom. The unwise and the slave {literally person) the most valued of his master forgot him ; there was need of him and he restored (his) decrees (])" 2
The exact etymology of the name which appears under
Amelon by Apollodoros, Euedokos, Eneugamos, Eneubulos and Anementos in the time of Daos (? Tammuz) the shepherd, and Anodaphos in the time of Euedoreskhos. Apollodoros makes "the Musaros ( lannes, the Annedotos," appear in the time of Ammenon the successor of Amelon, another Annedotos in the time of Daonos the shepherd,
and Odakon in the time of Euedoreskhos. A comparison of Anodaphos
and Odakon shows the true reading to have been Anodakon, i.e. "Aim
and Dagon (Dagan)," who are constantly associated together by Sargon,
and who says of them that he had " written the laws (not " immunitas," as Winckler) of llarran by the will of Ann and Dagon." Annedotos seems to be a Greek compound, "given by Anu." In any case, some of the successors of Oannes appear to have been derived from the
legends of Erech, the city of Anu, and not, like the original Oannes, from Eridu. With the exception of the first, who is made a Babylonian, the antediluvian kings come either from Larankha, which, as we learn
lii mi the Deluge-tablet, is a corrupt reading for Surippak near Sippara,
or from Panti-bibla, a Greek translation of " the country of tablets" or
" books,'' a title given to the Acead of Sargon, according to W. A. I.
ii. 51, 8. We may infer from this that the whole story of the ante
diluvian kings had its origin at Sippara.
1 Iggillum (which docs not signify "a cry of woe," as Jeremias sup
poses) is explained by uatsiru, " the defender," in W. A. I. v. 28, 72. Magiru, "the obedient one," is called his throne-bearer in W. A. I. iii. 68, 7, where the Iggillum is identified with Ea.

the Greek dress of Cannes has not yet been ascertained.
Lcnonnant thought that it represented Ea-Jchan, " Ea the fish." But whether or not this is the case, it is certain
that Oannes and Ea arc one and the same. Ea, as we
have seen, not only had his home in the waters of the
Persian Gulf, he was also the culture-god of primitive Babylonia, the god of wisdom, the instructor of his
worshippers in arts and science. An old Babylonian
sermon on the duty of a prince to administer justice
impartially and without bribes, declares that if "he
speaks according to the injunction (or writing) of the god Ea, the great gods will seat him in wisdom aud the
knowledge 1 of righteousness." 2 Ea was, moreover, like
Oannes, represented as partly man and partly fish. Sometimes the fish's skin is thrown over the man's back, the
head of a fish appearing behind that of the man ; some
times the body of the man is made to terminate in the
tail of a fish. A gem in the British Museum, on which
the deity is depicted in the latter fashion, bears an in
scription stating that the figure is that of " the god of
pure life." Now "the god of pure life," as we are
expressly informed by a rubrical gloss to a hymn in
honour of the demiurge Ea (Obv. 5), was one of the
names of Ea.
Th^name Ea, which is transcribed Aos by Damascius,
signifies "a house," or rather "belonging to a house." 3

Ea was therefore originally the "house-god"—a desig
nation which it is difficult to reconcile with his aquatic
character. Possibly his worship goes back to a time
when the inhabitants of the coast of the Persian Gulf
lived in pile-dwellings like those of Switzerland or the
British Islands; possibly it belongs to a later period, when the old marine god had become the household
deity of those who received his benefits and believed
him to be the source of their culture. He was sym
bolised, it would seem, by a serpent; 1 and to this day the Zulus believe that the spirits of their ancestors are
embodied in certain harmless snakes which frequent their
homes. However this may be, the primaeval seat of the
worship of Ea was the city of Eridu, now represented by the mounds of Abu Shahrein on the eastern bank of
the Euphrates, and not far to the south of Mugheir
or Ur.
Eridu is a contracted form of the older Eri-duga, or
"good city," which appears in the non-Semitic texts of
northern Babylonia as Eri-zeba, with the same meaning.
The place was thus a peculiarly holy spot, whose sanctity was established far and wide throughout the country.
]'>ut it was not a holy city only. It is often termed,
in iv. 6, 47 This scums to be the form which has given rise to the A-os of Dainascius. In O-annes the initial is due to the contraction
of '"'-'(.
1 See above, p. 116. Among the symbols of the gods on contract
stones, the serpent occupies a prominent place. According to W. A- L ii. 59, 21. the snake-god was Serakh, the god of corn and "spirit of K-sara." whose name signified "the treading of corn" (v. 17. 31, 32), and who is called "the overseer" or "assembler of the gods of heaven and earth" (K 4415, Rev. 10). On the other hand, in an unnumbered
fragment (M, line 10), "a snake in thy bed" (asurra-ki) is invoked as a curse.



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 135
more especially in the sacred texts, "the lordly city,"
1
and we are told that one of its titles was "the land of
the sovereign." In historical times, however, Eridu had sunk to the condition of a second-rate or even third-rate
town ; its power must therefore belong to that dimly
remote age of which the discoveries at Tel-loh have
enabled us to obtain a few glimpses. There must have
been a time when Eridu held a foremost rank among
the cities of Babylonia, and when it was the centre from
which the ancient culture and civilisation of the country
made its way. 2
Along with this culture went the worship of Ea, the
god of Eridu, who to the closing days of the Babylonian monarchy continued to be known as Eridiiga, "the god
of Eridu." At the period when the first elements of
Chaldsean culture were being fostered in Eridu, the city
stood at the mouth of the Euphrates and on the edge of
the Persian Gulf. If the growth of the alluvium at the
mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris has always been the
same as is the case at present (about sixty-six feet a year), this would have been at the latest about 3000 B.C. ;
but as the accumulation of soil has been more rapid of
late, the date would more probably be about 4000 B.C.
Already, therefore, the cult of Ea would have been esta
blished, and the sea-faring traders of Eridu would have
placed themselves under his protection.
It will be noticed that the culture-myths of Babylonia,
1 Xux-ki, pronounced Nunpe, according to 82. 8 — 16, 1, Obv. 21.
En-ki, another title of Eridu, means " land of the lord." ^
2 The decay of Eridu was probably due to the increase of the delta at the head of the Persian Gulf, which made it an inland instead of a
maritime city, and so destroyed its trade.

like the culture-myths of America, bring the first civiliser
of the country from the sea. It is as a sea deity that
Oannes is the culture-hero of the Chaldseans ; it is from
the depths of the Persian Gulf that he carries to his
people the treasures of art and science. Two questions
are raised by this fact. Was the culture of Babylonia
imported from abroad ; and was Ea, its god of culture,
of foreign extraction ?
The last great work published by Lepsius 1 was an
attempt to answer the first of these questions in the
affirmative. He revived the old theory of a mysterious
Cushite population which carried the civilisation of Egypt
to the shores of Babylonia. But to all theories of this
sort there is one conclusive objection. The origin of
Babylonian culture is so closely bound up with the origin of the cuneiform system of writing, that the two cannot
be separated from each other. Between the hieroglyphics
of Egypt, however, and the primitive pictures out of which the cuneiform characters developed, there is no
traceable connection. Apart from those general analogies
which we find in all early civilisations, the script, the
theology and the astronomy of Egypt and Babylonia show no vestiges of a common source.
Nevertheless, there is now sufficient evidence to prove
that at the very dawn of the historic period in Babylonia,
maritime intercourse was being carried on between this
country on the one hand and the Sinaitic Peninsula and
India on the other. The evidence is as startling as it is
curious. "

which may he roughly dated ahout 4000 B.C., remind
every traveller who has been in Egypt of the great
diorite statue of king Khephren, the builder of the second
pyramid of Gizeh, which is now in the Bulak Museum.
The execution, indeed, is infinitely inferior; but the
attitude, the pose, the general effect, and to a certain
extent the dress, are remarkably alike. What is more,
some of the Tel-loh statues are carved out of hard diorite
stone. Now one of the inscriptions that accompany them
affirms that the stone was brought from the land of
Magan ; and though in later times Magan was used to
denote Lower Egypt, Dr. Oppert and myself have long
ago pointed out that originally it signified the Sinaitic Peninsula. Ever since the epoch of the Third Dynasty,
Egyptian garrisons had held possession of the Peninsula, and Egyptian miners had quarried there ; and as the age
of the fourth Egyptian Dynasty corresponds with the age which we must assign to the statues of Tel-loh, it
would seem that as far back as six thousand years ago
stone was conveyed by sea from the quarries of Sinai to
Egypt and Babylonia, and that a school of sculpture had already arisen in that part of the world. What clinches
the matter is the fact observed by Mr. Petri e, that the
unit of measurement marked on the plan of the city
which one of the figures of Tel-loh carries upon its lap,
is the same as the unit of measurement employed by the
Pyramid builders. 1
In an opposite direction we may infer that Chaldsean
traders had also made their way to the western coast of
India. Apart from the existence of teak in the ruins of

Mugheir, an ancient Babylonian list of clothing mentions
stndhu, or "muslin,' the iadin of the Old Testament, the o-ivSwv of the Greeks. That <riv8<6v is merely " the Indian''
cloth lias long been recognised ; and the fact that it
begins with a sibilant and not with a vowel, like our
" Indian," proves that it must have come to the west by
sea and not by land, where the original s would have
become // in Persian mouths. 1 That sindhu is really the
same word as o-ivSwv is shown by its Accadian equivalent,
which is expressed by ideographs signifying literally
" vegetable cloth." This intercourse with other countries, and the influence
which a school of sculpture in the Sinaitic Peninsula
appears to have exercised upon the Babylonians, must
necessarily have had much to do with the early develop
ment of Chaldsean culture, even though it were indige
nous in its origin. It therefore becomes possible that Ea,
the deity with whom the introduction of such a culture
is associated, may also have come from abroad. At pre
sent, however, there is no proof of this, though it is quite
possible that some of his features are foreign; and it is
even possible that the primitive Shamanistic worship of
spirits, which, as we shall see hereafter, originally cha
racterised the religion of the Accadians, first became a
worship of the god Ea through foreign influence, other
spirits afterwards passing into gods when the example had once been set.
Ea, however, was not merely a god of the sea. The Persian Gulf, which formed the entrance to the ocean

THE GODS OF BABYLONIA 139
stream that encircled the world, was fed by the great
river on which Eridu stood. Ea accordingly was a river
god as well as a sea-god ; he is entitled not only " the
king of the deep,'' but "the king of the river" 1 also.
Out of the mixture of the two arose the conception of
the encircling ocean, and the further title, " god of the
river of the great snake." 2 Ea was thus emphatically a
water-god, the deity wno presided over the watery element wherever it was found, and whose home was in the
waves of the Persian Gulf.
Ea had a consort who was not at all like the Semitic
goddesses we have been considering in the last Lecture.
She was no pale reflexion of a male divinity, no Anat or
Beltis or Zarpanit, differing from her husband only in
the grammatical suffix of her name ; but a genuine and
independent deity, whose powers were co-extensive with
those of Ea. She was known as Dav-kina or Dav-ki,
"the lady of the earth," and personified the earth just as
Ea personified the water. Water and earth—these were
the two elements out of which the old inhabitants of
Eridu believed the world to have been formed. It was
the theory of Thales in its primitive shape ; the water
god at Eridu took the place occupied by the Sky-god in
other cities of Babylonia. He was in fact addressed, not
only as "lord of the earth," but also as "lord of heaven
and earth," "the master of all created things," "the
ruler of all the world," " the god of the universe," " the
prince of the zenith" of heaven. 3 There is no room here
for the Ami or Sky-god of northern Babylonian theology.

^Not only, then, the elements of culture and civilisa
tion, but the created universe itself proceeded out of that
watery abyss, that "deep," as it is called in our transla
tion of the Book of Genesis, which was at once the home
and the visible form of Ea. Ea was the demiurge, and
a hymn exists in which he is addressed as such under
each of his many titles. Thus he is invoked as u the
god of pure life" "who stretches out the bright firma
ment, the god of good winds, the lord of hearing and obedience, creator of the pure and the impure, establishes
of fertility, who brings to greatness him that is of small estate. In places difficult of access we have smelt his
good wind. May he command, may he glorify, may he hearken to his worshippers. god of the pure crown,
moreover, may all creatures that have wings and fins be
strong. Lord of the pure oracle who giveth life to the
dead, who hath granted forgiveness to the conspiring gods, hath laid homage and submission upon the gods
his foes. For their redemption did he create mankind,
even he the merciful one with whom is life. Ma}T he
establish and never may his word be forgotten in the
mouth of the black-headed race (of Sumir) whom his
hands created. As god of the pure incantation may he
further be invoked, before whose pure approach may the
evil trouble be overthrown, by whose pure spell the siege of the foe is removed. god who knowest the
heart, who knowest the hearts of the gods that move
his compassion, so that they let not the doing of evil
come forth against him, he who establishes the assembly
of the gods (and knows) their hearts, who subdues the
disobedient. . . . May he (determine) the courses of the
stars of heaven ; like a flock may he order all the gods,



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 141
May he exorcise the sea-monster of chaos ; her secrets
may he discover (?) and destroy for evermore. Mankind
may he raise to length of days, and may he overthrow
mischief (?) for future time. Since (their) places he
created, he fashioned, he made strong, lord of the world is he called by name, even father Bel. The names of
the angels 1 he gave unto them. And Ea heard, and his
liver was soothed, and he spake thus :
' Since he has made
his men strong by his name, let him, like myself, have the name of Ea. May he bear (to them) the bond of all
my commands, and may he communicate all my secret
knowledge through the fifty names of the great gods.' His fifty names he has pronounced, his ways he has
restored; may they be observed, and may he speak as
formerly. Wise and sentient, may he rule triumphantly. May father to son repeat and hand them down. May
he open the ears of both shepherd and flock." 2
The fracture which has destroyed the middle part of
the hymn makes it difficult to connect together the
earlier and latter portions of the poem. The poet, how
ever, evidently wishes to show that the demiurge Bel of
northern Babylonia is one and the same with the demiurge
1 Or " spirits of heaven," called Igigi in Assyrian, perhaps from agagit, "to be powerful." The name is ideographically expressed by the deter
minative of divinity followed by " twice five." Jensen, however, haa
shown (Zeitschrift fiir Assyriolor/ie, i. 1), that whereas the Aniinaki or "spirits of earth" were denoted by the numeral 8 (Accadian ma), the
Igigi were denoted by the numeral 9 (Ace. isimu). It is difficult to follow his further combinations, which would connect them with the
rilm of W. A. I. ii. 35, 37 (expressed ideographically by an-nun-gajl, "the great divine princes"), as well as with ra'hebu, the Heb. Rahab.

Ea of the south. It is one of the many attempts that
were made in later days to harmonise and identify the
various local deities of Chaldaea to whom in different
localities the same attributes were assigned. The task
was rendered easier by the numerous names, or rather
titles, which the several deities bore. Here Ea is accre
dited with no less than fifty—all, too, transferred to him
from the other " great gods ;
" and it is by a knowledge of them that the secret wisdom of Ea is communicated
to both gods and men. In Babylonia, as in most primitive
communities, the name was regarded as identical with
the thing which it signified ; hence the mystic importance attached to names and the leading part they played in
exorcisms and charms.
How a water-god became the demiurge seems at first
sight obscure. But it ceases to be so when we remember
the local character of Babylonian religion. Ea was as
much the local god of Eridu as Merodach was of Baby
lon, or Assur of Assyria. His connection with the water
was due to the position of Eridu at the mouth of the
Euphrates and on the shore of the sea, as well as to the
maritime habits of its population. In other respects he
occupied the same place as the patron-deities of the other
great cities. And these patron-deities were regarded as
creators, as those by whose agency the present world had come into existence, and by whose hands the ancestors
of their worshippers had been made.
This conception of a creating deity is one of the dis
tinguishing features of early Babylonian religion. Mankind are not descended from a particular divinity, as
they arc in other theologies ; they are created by him.
The hymn to Ea tells us that the god of Eridu was the



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 14o
creator of the black-headed race—that is to say, the old
non-Semitic population whose primary centre and start
ing-point was in Eridu itself. It was as creators that
the Accadian gods were distinguished from the host of
spirits of whom I shall have to speak in another Lecture.
The Accadian word for " god" was dimer, which appears
as dingir, from an older dingira, in the southern dialect of
Sumer. Now dimer or dingir is merely "the creator,"
formed by the suffix r or ra, from the verb dingi or dime,
" to create." A simpler form of dimer is dime, a general
name for the divine hierarchy. By the side of dime, dim,
stood gime, gim, with the same meaning ; and from this
verb came the Sumerian name of Istar, Gingira. 1 Istar
is said to have been the mother of mankind in the story
of the Deluge, and as Gula, "the great" goddess, she is addressed in a prayer as " the mother who has borne the
men with the black heads." 2 It was in consequence of
the fact that he was a creator that Ea was, according to
Accado-Sumerian ideas, a dingir or " god."
In the cosmology of Eridu, therefore, the origin of the universe was the watery abyss. The earth lay upon
this like a wife in the arms of her husband, and Dav-kina
accordingly was adored as the wife of Ea. It was through
1 W. A. I. ii. 48, 29. There was another dimme, or more properly
dimma, meaning " weak," the Assyrian tarpu, from rcqnc (W. A. I. v. 29, 71). Tarpu is the Hebrew teraphim, which, as Dr. Xeubauer has pointed out, must be connected with the Rephaim, or ' ; shades of the
dead,'' and hence " prehistoric people," and signify the images of dead
ancestors. Dimma, " weak," being confounded with dimme, " creator," by the Semites, caused the ideograph which denotes "a spirit" to
acquire the (Assyrian) value of rap, from rqppu, a synonym ofkatsutu, "the shade of the dead."

her that the oracles of Ea, heard in the voice of the waves,
were communicated to man. Dav-kina is entitled "the
mistress of the oracular voice of the deep," and also "the
lady who creates the oracular voice of heaven." 1 The
(trades delivered by the thunder, the voice of heaven,
thus became the reflex of the oracles delivered through
the roaring of the sea.
We may see here an allusion to the doctrine of a
watery abyss above the sky, of " the waters above the
firmament," that is, of which we read in Genesis. The
sky must have been looked upon as but another earth
which floated on the surface of an ocean- stream just as
did the nether earth itself. Hence in the theology of
Eridu there was no room for a god of the sky. The
visible sky was only Dav-kina in another form.
We can now understand why it was that in the theo
logy of Eridu the Sun-god was the offspring of Ea and
Dav-kina. The name that he bore there was Dumuzi or
Tammuz, "the only-begotten one," of whom I shall have much to say in the next Lecture. At present I need
only remark that he was the primaeval Merodach ; the
Sun-god born of Ea who was called Merodach by the
Babylonians was called Tammuz (Dumuzi) by the people of Eridu. Perhaps Merodach is after all nothing more
than "the. god from Eridu." That he came originally
from Eridu we have already seen.

X.i'ae author of the hymn to the demiurge identifies
Ea with "father Bel." As "the lord of heaven and
earth," Ea was indeed a Baal or Bel to the Semites, to
whose age the hymn belongs. But the particular Bel with whom the poet wishes to identify him was Mul-lil,
the supreme god and demiurge of Nipur (the modern
Niffer). In a list of the titles of Ea, we find it expressly
stated that he is one with " Mul-lil the strong." 1 But
such an identification belongs to the later imperial age
of Babylonian history. Mul-lil was primitively a purely local divinity, standing in the same relation to his wor
shippers at Nipur that Ea stood to his at Eridu.
Mul-lil signifies " the lord of the ghost-world." Lit
was an Accado-Sumerian word which properly denoted
"a dust-storm" or "cloud of dust," but was also applied
to ghosts, whose food was supposed to be the dust of
the earth, and whose form was like that of a dust-cloud.
The Accadian language possessed no distinction of gender,
and Ml therefore served to represent both male and female
ghosts. It was, however, borrowed by the Semites under
the form of lilliim, and to this masculine they naturally
added the feminine lilatu. Originally this lilatu repre
sented what the Accadians termed "the handmaid of
the ghost" (kel-lilla),
2 of whom it was said that the HI
had neither husband nor wife; 3 but before long lilatu
was confounded with the Semitic lilatu, " the night,"
and so became a word of terror, denoting the night-demon

who sucked the blood of her sleeping victims. In the
legend of the Descent of Istar into Hades, the goddess is
made to threaten that unless she is admitted to the realm
of the dead she will let them out in the form of vampires
to devour the living. From the Semitic Babylonians
the name and conception of Lilatu passed to the Jews,
and in the book of Isaiah (xxxiv. 14) the picture of
the ghastly desolation which should befall Idumaea is
heightened by its ruined mounds being made the haunt
of Lilith. According to the Eabbis, Lilith had been
the first wife of Adam, and had the form of a beautiful
woman; but she lived on the blood of children whom
she slew at night.
The "lord of the ghost-world" extended his sway
over this nether earth also. He is therefore entitled
"the lord of the world," as well as "king of all the
spirits of the earth." 1 According to one version of the
story of the Deluge, it was he who caused the waters of
the flood to descend from heaven, and who designed
the destruction of all mankind. "When Mul-lil," we
are told, "approached and saw the ship (of Xisuthros), he stood still and was filled with wrath against the gods
and the spirits of heaven. 2 ' What soul has escaped there
from?' (he cried). 'Let no man remain alive in the
great destruction.'
'
It was then that Ea came forward
with words of wisdom, and protested against this attempt of Mul-lil to confound the innocent with the guilty.
1 W. A. 1. i. 9, 3.
2 We seem to have here a mythological reminiscence of the fact that Mul-lil had originally been the god of the lower world and its hosts of
spirits, and that he was consequently in opposition to the gods of light and the spirits of the upper air.



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 147
"Let the sinner alone bear his sin; let the evil-doer
bear his own iniquity." And though the wrathful gud
was pacified, so that Xisuthros and his companions were
allowed to escape from their threatened death, the rescued
hero did not forget the evil intentions of Mul-lil ; but
when inviting the other gods to his sacrifice after his
descent from the ark, he specially excepted the god of
Nipur. " Let the (other) gods come to my altar, but let Mul-lil not come to the altar, since he did not act
considerately, but caused a deluge and doomed my people to destruction."
In these quotations I have called the god by his old
Accadian name, Mul-lil. 1 But long before this account
of the Deluge was composed, even though in its present form it probably reaches back more than 2000 years
before the Christian era, the Accadian Mul-lil had become
the Semitic Bel. His primitive attributes, however, still adhered to him. He was still the god of the lower
world, whose messengers were diseases and nightmares and the demons of night, and from whom came the
plagues and troubles that oppressed mankind. In a
magical text (W. A. I. iv. 1. 5, 6), Namtar, the plague
demon, is called "the beloved son of Mul-lil"—standing,
in fact, in the same relation to Mul-lil that Tammuz does
to Ea, and in the next line Mul-lil's wife is asserted to
be Nin-ki-gal or Allat, "the queen of the mighty land" of Hades.
This magical text, however, is a good deal older than
1 Mul-lil was also known as En-lil in one of the Accado-Sumerian
dialects. En-lil was contracted into Illil according to W. A. I. v. 37, 21, which explains the "IAAii/os of Damascius (for which we should read

the time when the Semites adopted and transformed the
deities of the Accadians, or at all events it expresses the
ideas of that earlier period. When the god of Nipur
became Semitic, his character underwent a change. As the
supreme deity of the state he was necessarily a Baal, but the Semitic Baal embodied very different conceptions from
those which were associated with the Accadian Mul-lil.
It is true that, as I have just pointed out, his primitive
attributes still clung to him, but they were superadded
to other attributes which showed him to be the supreme
Sun-god of Semitic worship. That supreme Sun-god, however, revealed himself to his worshippers under two
aspects ; he might be either the beneficent god who gave
life and light to the world, or he might be the fierce and
wrathful sun of summer who scorches all nature with his
heat, and sinks at night, like a ball of glowing metal, into
the darkness of the under-world. Necessarily it was
rather under the latter aspect that the Mul-lil of Nipur
became the Semitic Bel.
This is the Bel whose cult was carried to Assyria, and
whose name is mentioned frequently in the inscriptions
of Nineveh, where among other titles he bears that of
"father of the gods." This is a title which he received,
not in virtue of his primitive character, but because he
had become the Semitic Bel. He was distinguished from
the younger Bel of Babylon, Bel-Merodach, as Be/Wai/as
or \loXadrjv (Bel-eth<hi). "the older Baal," 1 when Babylon became the imperial city, and its Bel claimed to be the
father and head of the Babylonian gods. But the dis

THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 149
tinction, as might be expected, was not always observed, and the older and younger Bel are sometimes confounded
together. The confusion was rendered the more easy by the fact
that the wife of the Bel of Nipur was addressed as Bilat,
and thus was undistinguished in name from Beltis of
Babylon. But she was in reality, as we have seen, the
queen of Hades, Nin-ki-gal as the Accadians called her, or Allat as she is named in the Semitic texts. 1 Allat is
interpreted "the unwearied;" 2 like the Homeric epithet
of Hades, dSa/xao-Tos, "the inflexible" divinity who ceases
not to deal on all sides his fatal blows. Her proper title,
however—that, at least, under which she had originally
been known at Nipur—was Mn-lil, "the lady of the
ghost- world." 3 It is under this name that Assur-bani
pal addresses her (W.A.I, ii. 66) as "the mistress of
the world, whose habitation is the temple of the library"
(i.e. the temple of Istar at Nineveh). 4 As Allat, the
1 In a magical text (W. A. I. ii. 18, 40) Nin-ki-gal is called the wife of Nin-azu ; but that Nin-azu is merely a title of Mul-lil is shown by
W. A. I. ii. 57, 51, where " the star of Nin-azu" is identified with Adar. In W. A. I. ii. 59, 35, the wife of Nin-azu is termed Nin-NER-DA.

4 E-barbar ; see W. A. I. iii. 3, 40. For the meaning of harbor, " a
library," cp. W. A. I. ii. 48, 26. The word is a re-duplicated form of
bar or bdra, " to reveal," hence used in the senses of " white" (W. A. I. iv. 21, 5) or "visible" (W. A. I. iv. 6, 46), and "an oracle" (W. A. I.
iv. 19, 48). The compound ideograph bar-bar is interpreted tabbak
riiiika, "the outpouring of a libation," in S 924, 7, and Rm. 2. 11. 149, 4, and mdsi, "a hero," in W.A.I, iv. 21. 30, 32. With the latter signification it was read mas-mas, which is a title of Merodach.
(K 100, 15, K 48, Obo. 18). Since, however, Merodach is called "the
lord of bar-bar-^"" in K 2546, Rev. 1, it is clear that the two senses
of the compound ideograph were played upon, as the reading her©
must be s/p-ti, " an oracle." Between the time of Sennacherib and



150 LECTURE III.
goddess of Hades, she was a much-dreaded and formida
ble figure, who is described in the legend of the Descent
of Istar as inflicting upon her sister-goddess all the pains and diseases which emanated from her demoniac satellites.
The unfortunate Istar, stripped of her clothing and adorn
ments, is held up to the scorn of the lower world ; and
Namtar, the plague-demon, is ordered by Allat to smite
her with maladies in the eyes, in the sides, in the feet,
in the heart, in the head, and, in short, in all the limbs.
Throughout the legend Xamtar appears as the messenger of the infernal queen.
It is thus clear that, just as Eridu in southern Baby
lonia was the primitive seat of the worship of the Chal
daean cultnre-god and of the civilisation with which his
name was connected, Nipur in northern Babylonia was
the original home of a very different kind of worship,
which concerned itself with ghosts and demons and the
various monsters of the under-world. It was, in fact,
the home of that belief in magic, and in the various
spirits exorcised by the magician, which left so deep an
impression upon the religion of early Babylonia, and about which I shall have to speak in a future Lecture.
The analogy of Eridu would lead us to infer, moreover,
that it was not only the home of this belief, but also the
snurce from which it made its way to other parts of the
country. In the pre-historie age, Eridu in the south and Nipur in the north would have been the two religious
centres of Babylonian theology, from whence two wholly different streams of religious thought and influence spread
Assuv-bani-pal, the library of Nineveh seems to have been transferred from the temple of Istar to that of Xebo ; see above, p. 9.



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 151
and eventually blended. The mixture formed what T
may call the established religion of Chaldsea in the pre
Semitic period.
That this conclusion is not a mere inference is shown
by the monuments discovered at Tel-loh. Tel-loh was
geographically nearer to Eridu than to Mpur, and its
theology might therefore be expected to be more largely influenced by that of Eridu than by that of Nipur. And
such, indeed, is the case. Temples and statues are
dedicated to Ea, "the king of Eridu," and more espe
cially to Balm, a goddess who occupied a conspicuous
place in the cosmological legends of Eridu. But Mul-lil,
the god of Nipur, appears far more frequently in the inscriptions of Tel-loh than we should have anticipated.
Nin-kharsak, "the mistress of the mountain," and "mo
ther of the gods," in whom we may see a local divi
nity, is associated with him as wife ; and Nin-girsu him
self, the patron god of Tel-loh, is made his "hero" or
" champion." So close, indeed, is the connection of the
latter with Mul-lil, that the compilers of the mythological tablets, in a latter age, identified him with the " warrior"
god of Nipur, Adar the son of Mul-lil.
Adar, or Ninep, or Uras—for his name has been read
in these various fashions, and the true reading still remains
unknown 1—played a conspicuous part in Babylonian, and
1 The only form out of these three which is monumentally established is Uras. Uras is given as the pronunciation of the second
ideograph in the name of the god ("W. A. I. iii. 70, 203— 207, ii. 54,
34) ; and in W. A. I. ii. 57, 31, Uras is expressly stated to be the name
of nin-ip, as " god of light" (uddane, see ii. 62, 36, where there is a play on the Assyrian baru, "fat," and baru, "to reveal"). From uras the Assyrians borrowed their urasu, "a mourning veil" ''v. 28, 60). Ip and nint -ip were two primaeval deities who in Accadian cosmology

more especially Assyrian theology. He was regarded
as emphatically the warrior and champion of the gods,
and as such was naturally a favourite object of worship
amongst a nation of warriors like the Assyrians. Indeed,
it may be suspected that the extent to which the name
of the older Bel was reverenced in Assyria was in some
measure due to the favour in which his son Adar was
held. In the inscriptions of Nineveh, the title of ''hero
god" (masu) is applied to him with peculiar frequency; this was the characteristic upon which the Assyrian
kings more particularly loved to dwell. In Babylonia, on the other hand, Adar was by no means so favourite a
divinity. Here it was the milder and less warlike Mero
dach that took his place. The arts of peace, rather than
those of war, found favour among the Semitic population
of the southern kingdom.
Originally, like Merodach, Adar had been a solar deity. We are distinctly told that he was "the meridian sun," 1
whose scorching heats represented the fiercer side of Baal
worship. But whereas Merodach was the sun conceived
of as rising from the ocean-stream, Adar was the sun
represented the male and female principles, but the genderless character of the Accadian nin, "lord" or "lady," caused the Semites to change
nin-ip into a god and identify him with ip, that is, "Ami who listens
to prayer" (ii. 54, 35). As u signified "lord" in Accadian, it would seem that they further identified the first syllable of U-ras with the a! a of Nin-Uras. Hence "the Assyrian lung," Horus of Pliny (N. H. xxx. 51, cp. xxxvii. 52), who discovered a cure for drunkenness, as well as the Thouras of Kedrenos (Hist. 15, 16, cp. Suidas and the Paschal Chron. p. 68), who is called the Assyrian Ares and made the son of Zames or Samas. The reading Adar is derived from the Biblical
Adrammelech, but it is quite certain that it is false, and I have retained
it in the text only on account of its employment by other Assyriologists.
1 W. A. I. ii. 57. 51, 76 (where he is identified with Mermer).



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 153
who issues forth from the shades of night. His wife
accordingly is "the lady of the dawn." 1 Like all solar
deities in Babylonia, an oracle was attached to his shrine.
His name is explained to mean " the lord of the oracle," 2
and one of his titles was ' ' the voice " or ' ' oracle supreme." 3
It was on this account that later mythologists identified
him with Nebo, 4 though between the Sun-god of Nipur
and the prophet-deity of Borsippa there was originally
no sort of connection. On the other hand, it must have
been his solar character that gave rise to the two curious
titles of "lord of the date" 5 and "lord of the pig." 6
The latter title was naturally dropped in the Semitic
period of Chaldrean history. Adar bears the same relation to Mul-lil that Merodach
bears to Ea. Each alike is the son and messenger of the

2 W. A. I. ii. 57, 17. It is clear that the compiler of the mytho
logical list here interpreted baru, the equivalent of was, in the sense
of " a revelation" or " oracle," and read his title in Assyria not as Masu, "a hero," hut as Baru, "the oracular god." It illustrates the same
play upon the ideographic writing of the god's name as that which we find in bar-bar or mas-mas for Merodach.

Tammuz; while the title "lord of the date"—the chief fruit of Baby
lonia—reminds us of Cain, who was "a tiller of the ground." Under the name of Baru, Adar was identified with iron, since the name of "iron" was denoted in Accadian by bar, "the shining" (see W. A. I. v. 30, 52), which was written with the determinative of divinity, indicative of the meteoric origin of the first iron worked in Batylonia.



154 LECTURE III.
older god. But whereas the errands upon which Mero
dach is sent are errands of mercy and benevolence, the
errands of Adar are those that befit an implacable war
rior. He contends not against the powers of darkness,
like Merodach, for the father whose orders he obeys is
himself the ruler of the powers of darkness ; it is against
mankind, as in the story of the Deluge, that his arms are
directed. He is a solar hero who belongs to the darkness
and not to the light.
It is thus that one of his brothers is "the first-born"
of Mul-lil, Mul-nugi, " the lord from whom there is no
return." 1 Mul-nugi is the lord of Hades, the god who
is called Irkalla in the legend of the Descent of Istar,
and out of whose hands there is no escape. It may be
that he is but another form of the Moon-god, since the
Moon-god, we are told, was also the eldest son of Mul-lil.
But the name by which the Moon-god went at Nipur
was one that signified " the god of glowing fire." 2 It is
curious to find the mythologists identifying this "god of glowing fire" with Adar; but the error was natural;
both alike were sons of Mul-lil, and both alike represented
the great orbs of heaven.
1 See the Deluge-tablet, col. i. 1. 17. In W. A. I. iii. 38, 7, lie is
called " the throne-bearer of Mul-lilla," and he would therefore seem to have been one of "the throne-bearers" of the Deluge-tablet (col. ii. 45)
who " went over mountain and plain" carrying destruction with them. Irkalla seems to be a Semitic form of a Proto-Chaldsean word. In "W. A. I. v. 16, 80, irhallum is the rendering of the Accadian kcsda,
"an enclosure" (comp. ii. 29, 63) ; and since the queen of Hades was
known as Nin-ki-gal, "the lady of the great country," while uni-gal or
i ri-'j'il, " the great city," was the Accadian designation of Hades or the
tomb ("W. A. I. ii. 1. 191; 30. 13), it is possible that Irl alia represents
an earlier Eri-galla. * W. A. I. ii. 57. 56.



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 155
The chief seat, however, of the worship of the Moon
god was not Nipur but Ur (the modern Mugheir). Here
stood the great temple the ruins of which were partially
explored by Loftus. Already in the oldest documents
that have come from thence, the god to whom the temple
was consecrated is identified with the Moon-god of Nipur.
Already he is termed "the first-born of Mul-lil." The
spread of the cult of Mul-lil, therefore, and of the magic which it implied, must have made its way as far south
as Ur in a very remote age. But we have no reason for
believing that the Moon-god of Ur and the Moon-god of Nipur were originally one and the same. Each Baby
lonian town, large and small, had its own local Moon-god, whose several names are recorded on a broken tablet. 1
The forms under which the Moon-god was worshipped
in Babylonia were as numerous as the forms of the Sun
god himself.
What seems yet more singular to the comparative
mythologist is that, according to the official religion of
Chaldrea, the Sun-god was the offspring of the Moon-god. Such a belief could have arisen only where the Moon-god
was the supreme object of worship. It is a reversal of
the usual mythological conception which makes the moon
the companion or pale reflection of the sun. It runs
directly counter to the Semitic Baal-worship. To the
Semite the Sun-god was the lord and father of the gods ;
the moon was either his female consort, or, where Semitic
theology had been influenced by that of Chaldaea, an
inferior god.
But the belief was thoroughly in harmony with a
theology which admitted Mul-lil and his ghost-world to
1 W. A. I. ii. 57, 56 sq



156 LECTURE III.
the highest honours of the pantheon. With such a theo
logy it was natural that the sun should be regarded as
issuing forth from the darkness of night. And the moon
was necessarily associated with the night. Indeed, in
one passage 1 the Moon-god is actually identified with
the plague-demon Xamtar, who was, as we have seen,
the messenger of the queen of hell. Moreover, the Babylonians were a nation of astronomers. Their astrology
was closely allied to their magic, and the lofty towers of
their temples were used for the observation of the sky.
It is not wonderful, therefore, that the cult of the moon
should occupy a foremost place in their creed, or that
the moon should be conceived as a male and not as a
female divinity.
It was at Ur, however, that the Moon-god was placed at the head of the divine hierarclry, and it wras from Ur
that the ideas spread which caused him to be addressed
as "the father of the gods." At Ur, in fact, he held
the same place that Mul-lil held at Nipur; but while
Mul-lil seems to have represented the dark sky of night,
the Moon-go^1 was the luminary which shed light upon the darkness. He was knowm at Ur as Xanak or Nannar,3
1 W. A. I. ii. 57, 79. Unfortunately, the name of the city where this
was the ca.se is lost. The " Lady who decides destiny," who is identilied with the impersonal "Mistress of the gods" of Semitic worship (W. A. I. ii. 55, 8), introduces us to a wholly different conception, and the later softening of the plague-demon into a mere instrument of
destiny.
- The reading is given by 82. 8 — 16. 1, Obv. 3. Nannakos was supposed to be an antediluvian king who predicted the flood (Zen.
6, 10, Steph. Byz. s.v. 'Ikovlov) ; the name, like the legend of the ark

a name which the Semites by a popular etymology after
wards connected with their word namarit, " to see;" so
that we find Nabonidos addressing the Moon-god of
Harran as " the light of heaven and earth" (nannari same
u irtsitim). In later days, both Nanak and Nannar, like
other of the Babylonian gods, passed into heroes and
human kings. Nannakos was transported into Phrygia, and Xannaros became a satrap of Babylonia under the
Median monarch Artaios—a personage, it need hardty
be observed, unknown to actual history. The Persian
legend, as handed down by Ktesias, is as follows :
l
/ " There was a Persian of the name of Parsondes, 2 in the service of
the king of the Medes, an eager huntsman, and active warrior on foot
and in the chariot, distinguished in council and in the field, and of influence with the king. Parsondes often urged the king to make him
satrap of Babylon in the place of Nannaros, who wore women's clothes
and ornaments, hut the king always put the petition aside, for it could not be granted without breaking the promise which his ancestor had made to Belesys. Nannaros discovered the intentions of Parsondes,
and sought to secure himself against them, and to take vengeance. He promised great rewards to the cooks who were in the train of the king, if they succeeded in seizing Parsondes and giving him up. One day, Parsondes in the heat of the chase strayed far from the king. He had
already killed many boars and deer, when the pursuit of a wild ass
carried him to a great distance. At last he came upon the cooks, who
were occupied in preparations for the king's table. Being thirsty, Parsondes asked for wine ; they gave it, took care of his horse, and
invited him to take food— an invitation agreeable to Parsondes, who had been hunting the whole day. He bade them send the ass which he had captured to the king, and tell his own servants where he was. Then he ate of the various kinds of food set before him, and drank
1 I quote from the English translation of Duncker's History of
Antiquity, v. pp. 298 sq. 2 The name of Parsondes is probably taken from the important town
of Parsindu, among the mountains of the Narnri, on the high-road to
Ekbatana (W. A. I. i. 21. 69, 70).

abundantly of the excellent wine, and at last asked for his horse in
order to return to the king. But they brought beautiful women to
him, and urged him to remain for the night. He agreed, and as soon as, overcome by hunting, wine and love, he had fallen into a deep sleep, the cooks bound him and brought him to Nannaros. Nannaros
reproached him with calling him an effeminate man, and seeking to obtain his satrapy ; he had the king to thank that the satrapy granted to his ancestors had not been taken from him. Parsondes replied that he considered himself more worthy of the office, because he was more manly and more useful to the king. But Nannaros swore by Bel and Mylitta that Parsondes should be softer and whiter than a woman, called for the eunuch who was over the female players, and bade him shave the body of Parsondes, and bathe and anoint him every day, put women's clothes on him, plait his hair after the manner of women,
paint his face, and place him among the women who played the guitar and sang, and to teach him their arts. This was done, and soon Parsondes played and sang better at the table of Nannaros than any of the women. Meanwhile the king of the Medes had caused search to be made everywhere for Parsondes ; and since he could nowhere be found, and nothing could be heard of him, he believed that a lion or some other wild animal had torn him when out hunting, and lamented
for his loss. Parsondes had lived for seven years as a woman in Babylon, when Nannaros caused an eunuch to be scourged and grievously
maltreated. This eunuch Parsondes induced b}r large presents to retire to Media and tell the king the misfortune which had come upon him.
Then the king sent a message commanding Nannaros to give up Parsondes. Nannaros declared that he had never seen him. But the
king sent a second messenger, charging him to put Nannaros to death if he did not surrender Parsondes. Nannaros entertained the mes
senger of the king ; and when the meal was brought, 150 women entered, of whom some played the guitar, while others blew the flute. At the end of the meal, Nannaros asked the king's envoy which of all the
women was the most beautiful and had played best. The envoy pointed to Parsondes. Nannaros laughed long and said,
' That is the person
whom you seek,' and released Parsondes, who on the next day returned home with the envoy to the king in a chariot. The king was astonished at the sight of him, and asked why he had not avoided such
disgrace by death. Parsondes answered, ' In order that I might see you
again and by you execute vengeance on Nannaros, which could nevel have been mine hail I taken my life.' The king promised him that
his hope should not be deceived, as soon as he came to Babylon. But



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 159
when he came there, Xannaros defended himself on the ground that
Parsondes, though in no way injured hy him, had maligned him, and sought to obtain the satrapy over Babylonia. The king pointed out that he had made himself judge in his own cause, and had imposed a
punishment of a degrading character; in ten days he would pronounce judgment upon him for his conduct. In terror, Xannaros hastened
to Mitraphernes, the eunuch of greatest influence with the king, and
promised him the most liberal rewards, 10 talents of gold and 100
talents of silver, 10 golden and 200 silver bowls, if he could induce
the king to spare his life and retain him in the satrapy of Babylonia. He was prepared to give the king 100 talents of gold, 1000 talents of
silver, 100 golden and 300 silver bowls, and costly robes with other gifts ; Parsondes also should receive 100 talents of silver and costly
robes. After many entreaties, Mitraphernes persuaded the king not to order the execution of Xannaros, as he had not killed Parsondes, but to condemn him in the penalty which he was prepared to pay Parsondes and the king. Xannaros in gratitude threw himself at the feet of the king ; but Parsondes said, ' Cursed be the man who first brought
gold among men ; for the sake of gold I have been made a mockery to
the Babylonians.'"
After this thoroughly characteristic example of the
way in which Persian euhemerism turned the mythology
of their neighbours into fictitious history, it requires an effort to go back to the sober facts of the old cuneiform
tablets. Nannaros, or Nannar, however, was originally
no satrap of a Median king, but the supreme god of Ur,
in whose honour hymns were composed and a ritual per
formed similar to that carried on in honour of Merodach
at Babylon. Thanks to the piety of the chief scribe of
Assur-bani-pal, Istar-sum-esses, one of these hymns has
been preserved to us in an almost complete state. The
Accadian original is accompanied by an interlinear Semi
tic translation, both of which the chief scribe claims to
have accurately reproduced. The hymn runs thus :

in his Fragments mythologiques is full of errors, and frequently mistakes the meaning of the lines.

As the original language of this hymn is the Accadian
of northern Babylonia, and not the Sumerian of the south,
it would seem that the priesthood and population of Ur
were derived from the north, and not from the geogra
phically nearer region of which Eridu was the head.
This will explain the relationship they discovered be
tween their own supreme deity and the god of Xipur. Ur was either a northern colony or had become incor
porated in the northern kingdom, 1 and its local god
accordingly became the first-born of Mul-lil. It is pos
sible that the hymns of which I have just given a
specimen were influenced by Semitic ideas ; at all events,
throughout the northern part of Chaldtea, wherever the
Accadian dialect of the north was spoken, a strong

the hymn is really that artificial language which grew up in the court
of Saigon.



Till-: GODS OF BABYLONIA. IGo
Semitic element seems to have existed in the population
from an early period ; and of Ur of the Casdim we are
specially told that it was the birth-place of the Semitic
Abraham.
Now Abraham, it will be remembered, migrated from Ur to Harran, in northern Mesopotamia. The distance
between the two cities appears considerable, and yet there was a very real connection between them. Like
Ur, Harran also was a city of the Moon-god, and the
temple of the Moon-god in Harran rivalled that at Ur.
Nay, more ; Harran was as closely connected with Baby
lonian history and religion as was Ur itself. Its name
recurs in early Babylonian texts, and is indeed of Acca
dian origin, Kharran being the Accadian word for "road,"
and denoting the city which lay on the great highway from Chaldrea to the west. The mythologists of Baby
lonia entitled the planet Mercury " the spirit of the
men of Harran;" 1 and Nabonidos boasts of his restoration
of "the temple of the Moon-god in Harran, in which from time immemorial the Moon-god, the mighty lord,
had placed the seat of the goodness of his heart." Gems
show us what the image of the god was like. It was
a simple cone of stone, above which blazed the star of
the moon, such as we see depicted on the seals and
monuments of Assyria and Babylonia. Sargon couples together Assur and Harran, whose ancient customs he
claims to have restored, and declares that he had " spread
his shadow over Harran, and by the will of Anu and
Dagon had written (again) its laws." Shalmaneser III.

god there which bore the Accadian name of E-Khulkliul,
"the house of rejoicing,'' an<l neither they nor Nabo
nidos seem to have had any doubt that the Moon-god
worshipped therein was the same as the Moon-god wor
shipped in Assyria and Babylonia. Whether this were primitively the case must remain
an open question. It is more probable that the Moon
god of Harran was originally as much a local divinity
as the Moon-god of TJr, unless, indeed, Harran had been itself the foundation of the kings of Ur in their early
campaigns to the west. But the leading place Avon by Ur at the time when its kings made themselves masters
of the whole of Babylonia, caused the Moon-god of Ur
to supplant the Moon-gods of the other cities of the
country, just as the rise of Babylon caused Merodach to
supplant the other Sun-gods of Chalda?a. With the
rowth of the Semitic power in Babylonia, the influence
<r
of the Moon-god of Ur became greater and more exten
sive. Nannar was now invoked as Sin—a name which
at first appears to have denoted the orb of the moon only ]

and the name and worship of Sin spread not only in
Babylonia, but in other parts of the Semitic world. His
name has been found in an inscription of southern Arabia,
and Sinai itself, the sacred mountain, is nothing more
than the sanctuary " dedicated to Sin." It may be that
the worship of the Babylonian Moon-god was brought to the peninsula of Sinai as far back as the days when
the sculptors of Tel-loh carved into human shape the
blocks of diorite they received from the land of Magan.
1 "Whether the name of Sin is of Accadian or Semitic origin must at
present remain an open question. At all events, I cannot believe that it i6 a Semitic corruption of an Accadian Zu-eu.



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 165
However this may be, the Moon-god of Ur, like the
city over which he presided, took primary rank among
the Babylonians. His worshippers invoked him as the father and creator of both gods and men. It is thus that
Nabonidos celebrates his restoration of the temple of
Sin at Han an: "May the gods who dwell in heave:i
and earth approach the house of Sin, the father who
created them. As for me, Nabonidos, king of Babylon,
the completer of this temple, may Sin, the king of the
gods of heaven and earth, in the lifting up of his kindly eyes, with joy look upon me month by month at noon
and sunset ; may he grant me favourable tokens, may
he lengthen my days, may he extend my years, may he establish my reign, may he overcome my foes, may lie
slay my enemies, may he sweep away my opponents. May Xin-gal, the mother of the mighty gods, in the presence of Sin, her loved one, speak like a mother. May
Samas and Istar, the bright offspring of his heart, to
Sin, the father who begat them, speak of blessing. May
ETuzku, the messenger supreme, hearken to my prayer and plead for me."
The moon existed before the sun. This is the idea
which underlay the religious belief of Accad, exact con
verse, as it was, of the central idea of the religion of the
Semites. It was only where Accadian influence was
strong that the Semite could be brought in any way to
accept it. It was only in Babylonia and Assyria and on the coasts of Arabia that the name of Sin was honoured ;
elsewhere the attributes of the Moon-god were transferred
to the goddess Istar, who, as we shall see hereafter, was
originally the evening star. But in Babylonia, Sin became inevitably the father of the gods. His reign extended



166 LECTURE III.
to the beginning of history ; Sargon, as the representative
of the Babylonian kings and the adorer of Merodach, speaks of "the remote days of the period of the Moon
god," which another inscription makes synonymous with "the birth of the land of Assur." 1 As the passage I
have quoted from Xabonidos shows, Sin was more parti
cularly the father of Sam as and Istar, of the Sun-god
and the goddess of the evening star.
But who was this Sun-god who was thus the offspring
of Sin ? The Sun-gods of Babylonia were as numerous
as its Moon-gods ; each city had its own ; who then was
the Samas who was so specially the son of the Moon-god
of Ur ? The answer is not very easy to give. Geogra
phical considerations would lead us to think of the Sun
god of Larsa, the modern Senkereh. Larsa was near Ur,
though on the opposite bank of the river, and its temple of the Sun had been famous from pre-Semitic times.
1 Tsibit Assuri, W. A. I. iii. 11. ii. 32. Oppert is right against George Smith and Lenormant in holding that adl Sin in the first
quoted passage (Khors. 110) cannot he a proper name, Adi-Ur (!). A fragmentary tahlet (quoted on p. 62 of George Smith's Chaldean Genesis, ed. Sayce) contained a legend about the foundation of the city
of Assur and its two temples, E-Sarra, the temple of Adar, and E-Lusu.
We read (line 6): "The god Assur (an khi) opened his mouth and
says ; to the god Khir . . . (he speaks) : 'above the deep (elinu apsi) the seat (of Ea), before (mikhrit) E-Sarra which I have built, below the shrine (asrata) I have made strong, let me construct E-Lusu the
seat of (the god . . .), let me found (lusarsid) within it his fortress . . .
when (the god) ascends from the deep thou didst prepare a place (that was still) unfinished . . . thou didst establish in Assur (D. P. pal-bat
ki) the temples of the great gods . . . .' to his father Anu even to him
(n[/><i u]a8u) (he spoke): 'The god . . . has (appointed?) thee over whatsoever thy hand has made, whatever thy (hand) possesses ; over the earth that thy hand has made, whatever (thy hand) possesses ; the city of Assur whose name thou hast given (jsa tazkura mm-su), the
place (which) thou hast made exalted for ever' (tanx&i darisam)."



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 167
But there is a special reason which makes it probable
that the Sun-god of Larsa was the deity whose father
was Sin. The temple of Sin at Ur, the ruins of which
are still in existence, had been founded by Ur-Bagas,
the first monarch of united Babylonia of whom we know.
His monuments have been met with at Mugheir, at Larsa,
at Warka, at Niffer, and at Zcrghul ; and his bricks
show that he was the founder—or more probably the
restorer—not only of the great temple of the Moon-god at Ur, but also of those of the Sun-god at Larsa, of Mul
lil at Nipur, and of Ami and Istar at Erech. Under his
rule, therefore, the unity of the empire found its religious
expression in the union of the worship of the Moon-god of Ur with that of the Sun-god of Larsa. As the domi
nant state, Ur necessarily stood to Larsa and Erech in the
relation of a metropolis, and its god thus became the pro
genitor of the gods of Larsa and Erech. The Sun-god of
Larsa, like the Istar of Erech, became accordingly the
child of Xanuar or Sin.
It was as Ivur(?)-nigin-gara, " the god who makes the
palace (of the setting sun)," that the Sun-god of Larsa seems to have been known to his worshippers in prc
Semitic days. 1 But when the Accadian Avas superseded
by the Semite, his special name was merged in the general title of Samsu or Samas, " the Sun." He became the
Baal of Larsa, who differed but little, save in the name
by which he was addressed, from the other Baalim of
Babylonia. The fame of the Samas of Larsa, however, was obscured
at an early period by that of the Samas of Sippara. Sip

para in historical times was pre-eminently the city of the
Sun-god. It was there that E-Babara, "the house of
lustre," the great temple of the Sun-god, 1 had been erected in days to which tradition alone went back, and it was
around its shrine that Semitic sun-worship in Babylonia
was chiefly centred. Sippara and its immediate neigh
bourhood had been the seat of early Semitic supremacy
in Chaldaea. It was, it is true, of pre-Semitic foundation ;
its primitive name Zimbir would show this, like the name
of E-Babara itself; and we know that Samas had once
been worshipped within its walls under the Accadian
title of Babara or Birra. But in these remote days Sip
para was probably an insignificant town; at all events,
the memory of later ages knew of Sippara only in connec
tion with the empire of Sargon of Accad and the Semitic
version of the story of the Deluge. 2
In the Old Testament, Sippara appears as a dual citySepharvaim, "the two Sipparas." One of these has been
discovered in the mounds of Abu-Habba by Mr. Hormuzd
Rassam, who has brought from it a monument on which
1 The temple of the Sun-god at Larsa was also known as E-babara (W.A.I, i. G5, 42); its zitjgurrat was called "the house of the bond of heaven and earth" (ii. 50, 19).
- According to Berossos, Xisuthros had written a history of all that had happened before the deluge and buried the books at Sippara, where they were disinterred after the Hood by his directions. The legend seems to have been based partly on a popular etymology which con
nected Sippara with sipru, "a book" (Ileb. sepUer), partly on the fact that the whole district was termed "the country of books," in conse
quence of its being the seat of the library of Sargon, whose city of Accad formed a part of the double Sippara. That the story of the deluge emanated in its present form from Sippara is indicated not only by the legend of the burial of the books, but also by the fact that
the hero of it was " a man of Surippak," a small town close to Sippara.



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 169
is carved a curious image of the divine solar disk. The
other lias been found by Dr. Hayes Ward in the mounds
of Anbar, an hour's distance from Sufeirah and the
Euphrates. The fragment of a geographical tablet seems
indeed to mention no less than four Sipparas — Sippara
proper, Sippara of the desert, Sippara "the ancient," 1
and Sippara of the Sun-god;- but since the historical
texts know of two only—Sippara of Anunit and Sippara
of Samas—it is best to regard the three first names as
alike denoting the same place, Sippara of Anunit, the modern Anbar. It must have been from this Sippara
that the Euphrates received its title, "river of Sippara,"
since Abu-Habba is seven miles distant from the present
bed of the stream.
In the close neighbourhood of this double Sippara,
Sargon built or restored the city to which he gave a
name, and from which the whole of northern Babylonia
received its title of Accad. It is called Agadhe in the
non-Semitic texts, Accad (Akkadu) in the Semitic; though
whether the name is of Semitic or non-Semitic origin
cannot at present be decided. Sargon's patronage of literature, and the celebrated library he founded in Accad,
caused the district to be known as " the region of books." 3
A popular etymology afterwards connected the name of
Sippara itself with scp/tcr, "a book," and the city accord

ingly appears in the fragments of Berossos as Paniibibla, <»r "Book-town."
AYith the spread and fame of the empire of Sargon,
the worship of Samas spread and became famous also.
The empire and the cult were alike Semitic ; wherever
the Semite planted himself, the Sun-god was worshipped under some form and name. The extent, therefore, of
the worship of the Sun-god of Sippara marks the extent
and power of Sargon's kingdom. The older Samas of Larsa was eclipsed by the new deity; henceforward
Sippara, and not Larsa, was the chief seat of the adoration
of Samas in Babylonia. It is to Sippara in all probability
that the hymns addressed to the Sun-god belong. They arc the product of an age of new ideas and aspirations.
They represent the meeting and amalgamation of Semitic and Accadian thought. The scribes and poets of Sargon's
court were partly Semites, partly Accadians; but the Semites had received an Accadian education, and the
Accadians had learnt the language and imitated the style
of their Semitic masters. Though the originals of most
of the hymns are written in the old language of Accad
a language that had become sacred to the Semites, and
in which alone the gods allowed themselves to be ad
dressed — the thoughts contained in them are for the
most part Semitic. We have no longer to do with a
Mul-lil, a lord of ghosts and demons, nor even with an
Ea, with his charms and sorceries for the removal of
human ills, but with the supreme Baal of Semitic faith,
the father and creator of the world, Avho was for his
adorer at the moment of adoration the one omnipotent
<;od. It is thus that we read :

In the closing days of the Babylonian monarchy,
Nabonidos, after restoring the temple of the Sim-god at Sippara, addresses him in the following words : " O
Samas, (mighty lord) of heaven and earth, light of the
gods his fathers, offspring of Sin and Xin-gal, when thou
enterest into E-Babbara, the temple of thy choice, when
thou inhabitest thy everlasting shrine, look with joy
upon me, Nabonidos, the king of Babylon, the prince who has fed thee, who has done good to thy heart,
who has built thy dwelling-place supreme, and upon my
prosperous labours ; and daily at noon and sunset, in
heaven and earth, grant me favourable omens, receive
my prayers, and listen to my supplications. May I be
lord of the firmly-established sceptre and sword, which thou hast given my hands to hold, for ever and ever !"
Nabonidos, the Babylonian, the peculiar protege of Merodach, could not regard Samas with the same eyes
as the old poets of the city of the Sun-god. His supreme
Baal was necessarily Merodach, whose original identity with Samas had long since been forgotten ; and Samas of
Sippara was consequently to him only the Baal of another
and a subject state. Samas is therefore but one of the

younger gods, who illuminates his divine fathers in the
higher heaven. He shares the power and glory of his
fathers only as the son shares the authority of the father
in the human family. Nothing can illustrate more clearly
the local character of Babylonian religion than tins dif
ference between the position assigned to Samas in the
hymns and in the inscription of Xabonidos. In the one,
he is the supreme god who brooks no equal ; in the other,
the subordinate of Merodach and even of the Moon-god
Sin.
As Semitic influence extended itself in Babylonia, the
Sun-god of Sippara came to absorb and be identified
with the numerous local solar deities of the Chaldsean
cities. It was only where a solar divinity was wor
shipped by the Semitic race under another name, as at
Babylon or Eridu or Xipur, or where the Semites had
already adopted another deity as the supreme object of
their worship, as at Ur, that this process of absorption and identification did not take place. At times the local
divinity became the son of Samas. Thus the Kosstean
Sun-god Kit, who had been introduced by the Kossaean
conquest, along with other gods like Simalia and Suga
muna, under the Semitised name of Kittum, was made
his son, 1 and Makhir, the god of dreams, through an error occasioned by the want of any indices of gender in
Accadian, was termed his daughter. 2
1 W.A.I, ii. 58, 11. The Semitic worshipper no doubt identified the name with his own word kittum, "right."
2 W.A.I, ii. 58, 13. In v. 70. 1. 9. 15, on the contrary, Makhir
is a god. He was the god of revelation, since a knowledge of the future was declared through dreams. Hence the Accadian mc-gal-zu,
"knowledge of the oracle," is interpreted sutfu pasaru, "to explain a

This absence of any marks to denote grammatical
gender, which Accadian shared with other agglutinative
languages, must have been a sore puzzle and difficulty
to the Semite when he first began to worship the gods
of his more cultured neighbours. Nin, for instance, in
Proto-Chaldeean, signifies at once "lord" and "lady," its
primary meaning being "the great one." But the whole grammatical thought of the Semite was based
upon a difference of gender. Xot only were nouns dis
tinguished into masculines and feminines, as in our own
Indo-European family of speech ; the distinction was
further carried into the verb. A masculine without a
feminine was as inconceivable to him as the man without
the woman, the husband without the wife, the father
without the mother. But as in Semitic grammar, so
also in the Semitic conception of social life, the male was
the source of life and authority, the female being but
his weaker double, the pale reflection as it were of the
man. The father was the head of the family, the supreme
creator was the masculine Bel. This was the exact con
verse of the ideas that prevailed among the Accadians.
Here it was the mother, and not the father, who stood at
the head of the family ; and in the bilingual texts we
find that in the Accadian original the female is always
mentioned before the male, while the Semitic translator
is careful to reverse the order. Woman in Accad occu
pied a higher position than she did, or does, among the Semites.
The goddesses of Accad, accordingly, were independent

beings, like the gods whose equals they were. But it was
quite otherwise with the Semitic Babylonians. Except where they had borrowed and more or less assimilated
an Accadian goddess, their female deities were simply
the complement of their male consorts—little more, in
fact, than the grammatical feminines of the gods. We
may almost say that they were created by grammatical
necessity. The Sun-god, therefore, as we have seen in a former Lecture, was provided with his feminine com
plement, with his "face" or reflection, as it was some
times termed.
The Semites gave her the general title of Bilat matati,
11 the lady of the world." It was the title of most of the
goddesses. They were seldom deemed worthy of a name
of their own ; they shone by the reflected light of their
consorts ; and as the supreme god of the worshipper was
Bel, and more especially Bit matati, " the lord of the
world;" his wife was necessarily also Bilat or Beltis, and
more espeeially Bilat matati. Sometimes, too, she was called Bilat Hi, "the lady of the gods," in reference to
the fact that the supreme Bel was their lord and master.
One of the Accadian solar divinities with whom the
Bilat matati) when regarded as the wife of Samas, was
identified, was A or Sirrida. 1 A had originally been a
1 A bilingual hymn to the Sun-god, which was recited by the priests at sunset, has been translated by Mr. Pinches (TV. Soc. Bill. Arch.
viii. 2) as follows :
" Sun-god, in the midst of heaven, in thy setting may the bolts of the glorious heavens speak peace to thee ! may the door of the heavens be gracious to thee !
may Misaru, thy beloved messenger, guide thee ! At E-Pari'a, the seat of thy lordship, thy greatness shines forth May A, thy beloved wife, gladly receive thee ! N

male divinity representing the solar disk, "the light of the sun" (Bir-Utu and Utu-ITtu), as he was also entitled
in Accadian. But the solar disk, the face as it were of
the Sun-god, was his female consort, according +o the
religious conceptions of the Semites, and among them, therefore, the old Accadian god was transformed into a
goddess. A, or Sirrida, thus became a Semitic goddess, and sank into a colourless representative of the female
element in the divinity. The transformation was aided

Sun-god, make straight thy path, £0 the everlasting road to thy rest.
Sun-god, of the country the judge, of her decisions the director art thou."
The same hymn was also chanted in the morning, with the substitution
of " Sun-god, from the glorious heaven rising," for the first line. It
was evidently originally intended for the temple of Samas at Sippara, but came in later times to be used in the worship of Xebo at Borsippa,
Nebo being recognised as the local Sun-god of Borsippa.
The original Sumerian form of the name of A was Sirrigam. In
W. A.I. ii. 57. 21 — 31, we have examples of the various ways in
which it might be written : Sir-ri-ga-ma, Sur-ga-ma, 'Sir-ga-m, 'Sir-da-m (Accadian), Sir-da (xiu-da). 'Sir-gam with the ideograph of the sun inserted, 'Sir-da-m (where the ideograph of the sun has the phonetic
value of d'l transferred to it). From line 2G it appears that A was
properly a title, meaning "the father." A gloss on line 28 reads TsabUtu instead of Bir-Utu, but this is a mistake, since tsab was Semitic,
and signified "warrior" (crim in Accadian) and not "light." Pinches (Proct eclings of tin Society of Bib. Archaiolorpj, Nov. 1885) would
connect A with Yahveh ; but this, of course, is philologically impossible, while the supposed instances of an Assyrian god Ya are all due to misinterpretation of the texts, and the name of the Edomite king A-rammu
does not prove that the Edomite deity A was identical with the Baby
lonian. Oppert's proposal to identify A with Malik or Moloch finda no support in the monuments.

by the absence of gender in Accadian, to which I have
already alluded. Where there were no external signs
of gender, and where Nin-Gan, one of the epithets
A
applied to A, might mean indifferently "lord of light" or " lady of light," it was not difficult to bring it about.
One of the deities partially absorbed by the Sun- god
was the ancient god of Fire. Among most primitive
peoples, fire is endowed with divine attributes. It moves
and devours like a living thing ; it purifies and burns up
all that is foul ; and it is through the fire upon the altar

the representative of the fire upon the hearth—that
the savour of the burnt sacrifice ascends to the gods in
heaven. But fire is itself a messenger from above. It
comes to us from the sky in the lightning-flash, and we
feel it in the rays of the noontide sun. The Fire-god
tended therefore to become on the one side the messenger
and intermediary between gods and men, and on the
other side the Sun-god himself.
In pre-Semitic times, however, the Fire-god retained
all his primaeval privileges and rank. He is still one of
the leading gods or "creators" of the pantheon. It is
he who controls the lower spirits of earth and heaven,
and to whom the prayers of the faithful are addressed.
Thus he is celebrated in an old hymn in the following
strains: 1
1. " The (bed) of the earth they took for their border, 2 but the god
appeared not, 2. from the foundations of the earth he appeared not to make
hostility ;

2 In the Semitic rendering, " (In the bed) of the earth their uecka were taken."

4. In the Star(s) of Heaven was not their ministry ;

5. The Fire-god, the first-born supreme, unto heaven they pursued and no father did he know.
6. Fire-god, supreme on high, the first-born, the mighty, supreme enjoiner of the commands of Anu ! 7. The Fire-god enthrones with himself the friend that he loves.
8. He reveals the enmity of those seven.
9. On the work he ponders in his dwelling-place. 10. Fire-god, how were those seven begotten, how were they nurtured 1 11. Those seven in the mountain of the sunset were born ; 1 2. those seven in the mountain of the sunrise grew up. 13. In the hollows of the earth they have their dwelling ;
14. on the high-places of the earth their names are proclaimed.
15. As for them, in heaven and earth they have no dwelling, hidden is their name.
16. Among the sentient gods they are not known.
17. Their name in heaven and earth exists not. 18. Those seven from the mountain of the sunset gallop forth ; 19. those seven in the mountain of the sunrise are bound to rest. 20. In the hollows of the earth they set the foot.

Fire was produced in Babylonia, as in other countries
of the ancient world, by rubbing two sticks one against
the other. The fire-stick, therefore, whose point was
ignited by the friction, was regarded with special vene
tion. The idea of "fire " was expressed by two ideographs
(gis-rar and gis-sir) which signified literally "the wood

of light." This " wood of light" was exalted into a god.
Sometimes it represents Gibil orKibir, the fire-god, some
times it is itself worshipped as a divinity under the name
of 'Savul (in Semitic, 'Savullu). Savul seems to have
been adored more particularly in Babylon ; at all events
he was identified with Merodach as well as with Samas
in those later ages when the cult of the Accadian fire
god passed into the cult of the Semitic Sun-god, and his
name forms part of that of the Babylonian king 'Savul
sarra-yukin or Saosdukhinos, the brother of Assur-bani
pal. It even made its way into the far west. The names
of the kings of Edom preserved in the 36th chapter of Genesis throw a curious light on Edomite mythology,
and show that 'Savul of Babylon was worshipped among
the mountains of Seir. We are told that Hadad the son
of Bedad, Samlah of Masrekah or the " Vine-land," and
Saul of Eehoboth by the river Euphrates, succeeded one
another. Now Hadad, as we shall see, was the Sun
god of the Syrians, whom the Assyrians identified with
their own Eamman or Rimmon; and the name of his
father Bedad is simply Ben-Dad, "the son of Dad,"
another form of Hadad according to the cuneiform inscrip
tions, and possibly the same as the David of the Hebrews,
the Dido, or "beloved one," of the Phoenicians. Samlah
of the "Wine-land" is the Semele of Greek mythology,
the mother of Dionysos the Wine-god. Her Phoenician
origin has long been recognised, and her name has recently been met with in a masculine form in a Phoe
nician inscription. Saul of Eehoboth by the '
river
Euphrates is, letter for letter, identical with the Babylo
nian 'Savul, and his Babylonian origin is further betrayed by the statement that he came from the Euphrates.



L82 LECTURE III.
Relioboth means merely the "public places" of a city; and^ when we remember that in the 10th chapter of
Genesis (v. 11), Eehoboth ('Ir) is the name applied to
the suburbs of Nineveh, it seems probable that in the
Relioboth of the Euphrates we may discover the suburbs
< if its sister-city Babylon. Let us now turn back again to Sippara, the city whose
Sun-god swallowed up so many of the priimeval deities
of Accad, like the Ivronos of Hellenic myth. By the side
of Sippara of Samas, I have said, arose the twin-city of Sippara of Anunit, The final dental shows that Anunit
was a female divinity, and shows furthermore that she
was of Semitic origin. But it was only as a female
divinity that she came from a Semitic source. She was,
in fact, the Semitic feminine of Aniina, one of the pri
mordial gods of ancient Accad. Aniina, it would appear,
must have been adored in Sippara in pre-Semitic days,
and subsequently worshipped for a time by the Semites, who created out of his name his female consort Anunit.
Anunit was identified with Istar, and thus survived,
while her lord and master, to whom she owed her very
existence, passed into almost entire oblivion. For this
it is possible to assign a reason. Aniina signifies " the
master," and is the masculine correlative of Innina or
Inina, the "mistress" of the ghost-world, to whom I
have had occasion to refer before. 1 Like Inina, he pre
sided over the lower world, and was consequently the
local god of primitive Sippara, who corresponded to the Mul-lil ofNipur. But the name was also a general one,
1 As Innina stands for an ulna, the vowel of an, " divine one," beini: assimilated to that of Nina, Annua stands for an nuna, " the great god."



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 18?)
and might be applied to any of the deities whom the
Accadians regarded as specially endowed with power. Hence it is that in a bilingual hymn the Aniinas of the
lower world arc called "the great gods;" 1 while another
text declares that while " the great gods are fifty in
number, the gods of destiny are seven and the Aniina
of heaven are five." 2 Besides the five Aniinas of the
heaven, there were the more famous Aniinas of the lower
world, whose golden throne was placed in Hades by the
side of the waters of life. They were called the Anii
na-ge, "the masters of the under-world," a term which
the Semites pronounced Aminaki. These Aniinaki were
opposed to the Igigi or angels, the spirits of the upper
air, and, the real origin of their name being forgotten, took
the place of the older Aniinas. In one of the texts I
have quoted, the Semitic translator not only renders the
simple Aniinas by "Aniinaki," he even speaks of the "Aniinaki of heaven," which is a contradiction in terms. 3
1 W. A. I. ii. 19, 8. " The Aniinas of the lower world to the upper firmament return." The hymn must be of Semitic origin, as the Accadian version shows Semitic influence. Another hymn (ii. 19. 49, 50)
declares that " the Antinas of the lower world in the hollows I cause to grope like swine." In a hymn in which the Fire-god is identified with Samas, the latter is called "the judge of the Anunnaki" (K 2585, Obv. 9).
2 K 4629, Rev.
3 Upon the analogy of Aniinaki, the Semites have added a final guttural to several of the words they borrowed from the Accadians, like
asiirraku, "a bed," from the Ace. asurra. Similarly the analogy of
issaliku, "a high-priest," from the Semitic root nasalat, "to pour out libations," has called into existence other nouns with final -ahJcu. The Accadian abrilc, " a vizier," borrowed by the Semites under the form of abrikku (82. 8—16. Obv. IS), whence the abhr&c of Gen. xli. 43 helped in the same direction. The adverbs in -ku of Zimmern (Babylonische Bu$sp$alment p. 94), like martsahu or zazalcu, should be read martsaius and zcaatus.



184 LECTURE III.
Though Animit was considered merely a local form
of Istar (W.A.I, ii. 49, 12), the great temple of Ulbar 1

if that is the right pronunciation of the word—which
had been erected by Zabu about B.C. 2340, preserved
her special name and cult at Sippara, from whence it
passed into Assyria. Nabonidos tells us that he restored
the temple "for Anunit, the mistress of battle, the bearer
of the bow and quiver, the accomplisher of the command
of Bel her father, the sweeper away of the enemy, the destroyer of the wicked, who marches before the gods, who
has made (his) omens favourable at sunrise and sunset."
In calling her the lady of battle and daughter of Bel,
Xabonidos identifies her with Istar, an identification
which is made even more plain a few lines further on
(col. iii. 42, 48 —51), where he makes her the sister of
Samas and daughter of Sin.
This identity of Anunit and Istar brings Sippara into
close connection with Erech, the modern Warka, the city
specially consecrated to the goddess of love. Erech, we
are told in the story of the plague-demon Nerra, 2 was
" the seat of Anu and Istar, the city of the choirs of the
festival- girls and consecrated maidens of Istar," 3 where
in E-Ana, "the house of heaven," dwelt her priests, "the
festival-makers who had devoted their manhood in order
1 The word is found in R2. i. 10, (b)ennd ul-bar-mes an u ki itkJntzu, "the lights (?) of heaven and earth kept the "bond." According to
W. A. I. ii. 61, 11, the temple of Ulbar was in Agadhe or Accad, thus
identifying Accad with Sippara of Anunit, and suggesting that the first foundations of the temple went back to the time of Sargon, the father of Xa ram-Sin.

that men might adore the goddess, carrying swords,
carrying razors, stout dresses and flint-knives," 1 "who minister to cause reverence for the glory of Istar." - Erech,
too, was the city with whose fortunes the legend of
Gisdhubar was associated ; it was here that he slew the
bull Anil had created to avenge the slight offered by
him to Istar ; and it was here in UruJc Suburi, "in Erech
the shepherd's hut," that he exercised his sovereignty. Erech is thus connected with the great epic of the Semitic
Babylonians, and it is probable that its author, Sin-liqiunnmi, was a native of the place. However this may be,
Erech appears to have been one of the centres of Semitic
influence in Babylonia from a very early period. The names of the kings stamped upon its oldest bricks bear
Semitic names, and the extent to which the worship of
Istar as developed at Erech spread through the Semitic
world points to its antiquity as a Semitic settlement.
It was not of Semitic foundation, however. Its earliest
name was the Accadian Unu-ki or Unuk, "the place of
the settlement," of which the collateral form Uruk does
not seem to have come into vogue before the Semitic
period. If I am right in identifying Unuk with the Enoch of Genesis, the city built by Ivain in commemora
tion of his first-born son, Unuk must be regarded as
having received its earliest culture from Eridu, since
Enoch was the son of Jared, according to Gen. v. 18, and
Jared or Irad (Gen. iv. 18) is the same word as Eridu. 3

The local god of Erech, however, was not Ea, the god
of the river and sea, but Ana, the sky. Thus whereas
at Eridu the present creation was believed to have origi
nated out of water, the sky being the primaeval goddess Zikum or Zigara, mother alike of Ea and the other gods,
at Erech the sky was itself the god and the creator of the
visible universe. The two cosmologies are antagonistic
to one another, and produced manifold inconsistencies in
the later syncretic age of Babylonian religion. But it was not in Erech alone that the sky was con
sidered divine. Throughout Chaldsea, Ana, "the sky,"
goddess," i.e. the Sun-god Tammuz, the husband of Istar. He had a shrine in the forest of Eridu, while Istar was the presiding deity of Erech. Lamech would be the Semitic equivalent of Lamga, a name of
the Moon-god, according to ii. 47, 6Q, when represented by the character which had the pronunciation of nagar, nangaru, in Semitic (3. 572). Naga-r is probably a dialectic form of Lamga. In S769. 1, 2, the ideo
graph preceded by ab, "lord" is rendered in the Semitic line by gurgurru.
Cp. "Nin-nagar, the great workman (nagar) of heaven," W. A. I. iv. 25, 27. Adah and Zillah, the wives of Lamech, would correspond with
the Assyrian edu and tsillu, " darkness" and " shade." Jabal and -Tubal, the sons of Lamech, are merely variant forms of the same word, which
is evidently the Assyrian ablu, "son" (from abalu, "to bring down"), like Abel (as Dr. Oppert long since pointed out). Ablu refers us to
"the only son" Tammuz (\V. A. I. ii. 36, 54), who was "a shepherd" like Jabal and Abel, and whose untimely death was commemorated by the musical instruments of Jubal. In Kypros, in fact, he was known as
the son of Kinyras, a name that reminds us of the fdnndr, or " harp." Adonis-Tannnuz, it was said, was slain by Arcs in the form of a boar, and Ares was identified with the Babylonian god Adar or Uras (see above, p. 152), "the god of the pig," whose name (an-bar) was used ideographically to denote "iron," in curious parallelism to the fact that
Tubal-Cain, the son of Lamech, was the " instructor of every artificer in brass and iron." There are some who would aver that the TubalCain of Genesis is but the double of Cain, and that it was he and not Ins father Lamech who had slain the "young man" (yeled, Assyrian
ilattu, a title of Tammuz). Adar, it may be noticed, Avas "the lord of
the date," and therefore of agriculture (see above, p. 153).



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 187
received worship, and the oldest magical texts invoke
"the spirit of the sky" by the side of that of the earth.
What distinguished the worship of Ana at Erech was
that here alone he was the chief deity of the local cult,
that here alone he had ceased to be a subordinate spirit,
and had become a dirigir or "creator." 1
Of this pre-Semitic period in the worship of Ana we know but little. It is only when he has become the Anu
of the Semites and has undergone considerable changes
in his character and worship, that we make our first true
acquaintance with him. We come to know him as the
Semitic Baal-samaim, or "lord of heaven," the supreme Baal, viewed no longer as the Sun-god, but as the whole
expanse of heaven which is illuminated by the sun. 2
How early this must have been is shown by the exten
sion of his name as far west as Palestine. In the records
of the Egyptian conqueror Thothmes III., in the 16th cen
tury before our era, mention is made of the Palestinian
town of Beth-Anath, "the temple of Anat," the female double of Anu. Another Beth-Anath was included
within the borders of the tribe of Naphtali (Josh. xix.
1 We must not forget that in inany passages in the Proto-Chaldsean
literature ana denotes simply " the sky," and not a divine being at all, though the Semitic translators, misled by the determinative of divinity
with which the word is written, have usually supposed it to represent the god Anu.
2 Compare the Phoenician account of the creation as reported by
Philo Byblius : " Of the wind Kolpia and of his wife Baau (i.e. Baku,
bohu), which is interpreted night, were begotten two mortal men, Aion and Protogonos so called, and Aion discovered food from trees. Those begotten from these were called Genos and Genea (1 Kain), and inhabited Phoenicia, and when great droughts came they stretched forth their hands to heaven, towards the sun, for this they supposed to be the only god, the lord of heaven, calling him Beel-samin."

38); and Anathoth, whose name shows ns that, besides the
Ashtaroth or "Astartes," the Canaanites venerated their
local goddesses under the title of "Anats," was a city of
the priests. Anah or Anat was the daughter of the Hivite
Zibeon and mother-in-law of Esau (Gen. xxxvi. 1, 14),
and by her side we hear of Anah or Ami, the son of the
Horite Zibeon, who "found the mules (or hot-springs) in
the wilderness as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father."
But Ami did not make his way westward alone. In the
Assyrian inscriptions Anu is coupled with Dagan, " the exalted one," 1 whose female consort seems to have been
Dalas or Salas. Thus Assur-natsir-pal calls himself " the
beloved of Anu and Dagon;" and Sargon asserts that he
"had extended his protection over the city of Harran,
and, according to the ordinance of Anu and Dagon, had
written down their laws." Here Dagan or Dagon is
associated with Harran, the half-way house, as it were, between the Semites of Babylonia and the Semites of the
west. From Harran we can trace his name and cult to
Phoenicia. Beth-Dagon was a city of Asher, in the neighbourhood of Tja'e and Zidon (Josh. xix. 27), and the
fragments of Philon Byblios, the Greek translator of the
Phoenician writer Sankhuniathon, tell us expressly that
Dagon was a Phoenician god. That the statement is
genuine is made clear by the false etymology assigned to the name, from the Semitic dagan , "corn." 2 But it was

mit" (W.A.I, v. 21. 45. 6; ii. 26, 49), and gan is the participle of the substantive verb. In W. A. I. iii. 68, 21, Dagon is identified with
Mul-lil. For his wife Daks or Salas, see W. A. I. iii. 68, 22.

among the Philistines in the extreme south of Palestine
that the worship of Dagon attained its chief importance.
Here he appears to have been exalted into a Baal, and
to have become the supreme deity of the confederate
Philistine towns. We hear of his temples at Gaza
(Josh. xvi. 21 —30) and at Ashdod (1 Sam. v. 1 sq.), as
well as of a town of Beth-Dagon, and we gather from
the account given of his image that he was represented
as a man with head and hands.
It is probable that the worship of Ami migrated west
ward along with the worship of Istar. The god and
goddess of Erech could not well be dissociated from one
another, and the spread of the worship of the goddess
among the Semitic tribes brought with it the spread of
the worship of the god also. I am inclined to think
that this must be placed at least as early as the age of
Sargon of Accad. The worship of Istar found its way to
all the branches of the Semitic family except the Arabic ;
and, as we shall see in a future Lecture, the form of the
name Ashtorcth, given to the goddess in Canaan, raises
a presumption that this was due, not to the campaigns
of the early Babylonian kings, but to the still earlier
migrations of the Semitic population towards the west.
The old sky-god of the Accadians must have become the
Semitic Ann at a very remote period indeed.
But it was the sky-god of Erech only. It does not
follow that where the divine Ana, or " sky," is mentioned
is called Kronos, and Bctylos (Bethel), and Dagon, which signifies corn, and Atlas .... Kronos gave (a concubine of Ouranos) in marriage to Dagon, and she was delivered and called the child Demaroon .... And Dagon, after he had found out bread-corn and the plough, was called Zeus Aiotrios."



190 LECTURE III.
in the Accadian texts, the god who became the Semitic
Ann is referred to, even though the Semitic translators
of the texts imagined that such was the case. There
were numerous temples in Chalda?a into whose names the
name of the deified sky entered, but in most cases this
deified sky was not the sky-god of Erech. It is only
where the names have been given in Semitic times, or
where the Accadian texts are the production of Semitic
literati composing in the sacred language of the priests, like the monks of the Middle Ages, that we may see the
Ami of the mythological tablets. Without doubt the
Semitic scribes have often confounded their Ann with
the local sky-god of the ancient documents, but this
should only make us the more cautious in dealing with
their work.
The original sky-god of Erech denoted the visible sky.
He is opposed to the visible earth, and was consequently in most of the Chalda?an cities an inferior deity, subor
dinate to a Mul-lil, an Ea or a Sun-god, who ruled over
the sky and the earth. But when the Accadian Ana
became the Semitic Ami, he assumed a more spiritual
character. It was no longer the visible heaven that was
represented by him, but an invisible one, above and
beyond the heaven that we behold. Henceforward "the
lieaven of Anu" denoted the serene and changeless regions
to which the gods fled when the deluge had broken up
the face of the lower heaven, and which an Assyrian poet
culls "the land of the silver sky.'' It was to this spiri
tualised heaven that the spirit of Ea-bani, the friend of
Gisdhubar, ascended, and from which he gazed placidly on the turmoil of the earth below ; and it was from his
seat therein that Ami assigned their places in the lower



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 191
heaven to Samas, Sin and Istar, the Sun, the Moon and
the Evening Star, according to the legend of the seven
wicked spirits.
13nt the spiritnalisation of Ann did not stop here. As
a Semitic Baal he Lad become a supreme god, the lord
and father of the universe. It was only a step further,
therefore, to make him himself the universe, and to resolve
into him the other deities of the Babylonian pantheon.
We read occasionally in the hymns of "the one god."
"The ban, the ban," a poet writes, personifying the
priestly sentence of excommunication, like the Ara of iEskhylos or the divine burden of Zechariah (ix. 1), "is
a barrier which none may overpass J
1 the barrier of the
gods against which they cannot transgress, the barrier of heaven and earth which cannot be changed ; the one god
against whom none may rebel; god and man cannot
explain (it) ; it is a snare not to be passed Avhich is
formed against the evil, the cord of a snare from which
there is no exit which is turned against the evil." The
conception of Ann, however, as "the one god" was pantheistic rather than monotheistic. The cosmological
deities of an older phase of faith were in the first instance
resolved into him. In place of the genealogical, or gnostic, system which we find in the account of the Creation in
days, we have a pantheistic system, in which Lakhama and the other primaeval forces of nature are not the
parents of Ami, but are identified with Anu himself. 2 It
is easy to conceive how the old deity An-sar, "the upper
firmament," with all its host of spirits, might be iden

tificd with him ; but when we find TJras also, the Sun-god
of Nipiir, made one with Ami, "the hearer of prayer,"
and the eagle-like Alala, the bridegroom of Istar and
double of Tammuz, equally resolved into the god of
Erech, it is plain that Ave have to do with an advanced
stage of pantheism. This monotheistic, or rather pan
theistic, school of faith has been supposed by Sir Henry Eawlinson to have grown up at Eridu ; but the fact that
it centres round the name of Ami points rather to Erech
as its birth-place. How long it nourished, or whether it
extended beyond a narrow group of priestly thinkers, we
have no means of ascertaining. It is interesting, however, as showing that the same tendency which in Assyria
exalted Assur to the position of an all-powerful deity
who would brook neither opposition nor unbelief, among
the more meditative Babylonians produced a crude system of pantheism. Whatever question there may be as to whether the pure and unmixed Semite is capable of ori
ginating a pantheistic form of faith, there can be little doubt about it where the Semite is brought into close
contact with an alien race. The difference between the
Assyrian and the Babylonian was the difference between
the purer Semite and one in whose veins ran a copious
stream of foreign blood.
The early importance and supremacy of Erech in
Semitic Babylonia caused its god to assume a place by
the side of Ea of Eridu and Mul-lil, the older Bel. It
is possible that the extension of his cult had already
begun in Accadian days. The Ana, or Sky-god, to whom Gudea at Tel-loh erected a temple, may have been the
Sky-god of Erech, more especially when we remember the connection that existed between Erech and Eridu on



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 103
the one hand, and between Tel-loh and Eridu on the
other. 1 However this may be, from the commencement
of the Semitic period Anu apjDears as the first member
of a triad which consisted of Anu, Bel or Mul-lil, and Ea.
His position in the triad was due to the leading position
held by Erech; the gods of Nipur and Eridu retained
the rank which their time-honoured sanctity and the
general extension of their cult had long secured to them ;
but the rank of Anu was derived from the city of which
he was the presiding god. The origin of the triad was
thus purely accidental ; there was nothing in the religious
conceptions of the Babylonians which led to its formation.
Once formed, however, it was inevitable that a cosmolo
gical colouring should be given to it, and that Anu, Bel
and Ea, should represent respectively the heaven, the lower world and the watery element. Later ages likened
this cosmological trinity to the elemental trinity of the Sun, the Moon and the Evening Star ; and below the triad
of Anu, Bel and Ea, was accordingly placed the triad of
of Samas, Sin and Istar. But this secondary trinity never attracted the Babylonian mind. Up to the last,
as we have seen, Sin continued to be the father of Samas
and Istar, and Babylonian religion remained true to its
primitive tendency to dualism, its separation of the divine world into male and female deities. The only genuine
trinity that can be discovered in the religious faith of
early Chaldaea was that old Accadian system which con
ceived of a divine father and mother by the side of their
son the Sun-god.
The importation of the worship of Istar into Tel-loh, with her tewple of E-ana, or "house of heaven," would, however, fully account
for the importation of the worship of Anu at the same time.
O



194 LECTURE III.
The Semitic Ami necessarily produced the feminine
Anat, and as necessarily Anat was identified with the
earth as Anu was with the sky. In this way the Acca
dian idea of a marriage union between the earth and the
sky was adapted to the newer Semitic beliefs. But we
must not misunderstand the nature of the adaptation.
Anat never became an independent deity, as Dav-kina, for example, had been from the outset; she had no
separate existence apart from Anu. She is simply a
Bilat matatij "a mistress of the world," or uBilat Hi, "a
mistress of the gods," like the wife of Bel or of Samas;
she is, in fact, a mere colourless representation of the
female principle in the universe, with no attributes that
distinguish her from Anunit or Istar except the single one that she was the feminine form of Anu. Hence
it is that the Canaanites had not only their Ashtaroth,
but their Anathoth as well, for the Anathoth or " Anats"'
differed from the Ashtaroth or "Ashtoreths" in little
else than name. So far as she was an active power, Anat
was the same as Istar ; in all other respects she was
merely the grammatical complement of Anu, the goddess
who necessarily stood at the side of a particular god. There are still two other gods of whom I must speak
before I conclude this Lecture—Xergal, the god of Cutha,
and Ramman or Rimmon, the air-god. Xergal occupies a peculiar position. He was the local deity of the town
called Gudua, " the resting-place," by the Accadians—a
name changed by the Semites into Ivutu or Cutha —which
is now represented by the mounds of Tel-Ibrahim. For
reasons unknown to us, the necropolis of Cutha became
famous at an early time; and though the Babylonian
kings, like the kings of Assyria and Judah, were buried



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 195
in their own palaces, 1 it is probable that many of their
subjects preferred a sepulchre in the neighbourhood of Cutha.
The original name of the god of Gudua was Nerra or
Ner, a word which the Semitic scribes render by (/asm,
"the strong one," and less accurately namru, " the bright one." 2 Later legends had much to say about this ancient
hero-god. Like Etana, his throne was placed in Hades, where he sat crowned, awaiting the entrance of the dead
kings of the earth. But the hero-king of the myths was
one and the same with the god whom his primitive wor
shippers at Gudua made king of ardli or Hades. He
was, in fact, the personification of death. Hence his
title of "the strong one," the invincible god who over
powers the mightiest of mortal things. The realm over
which he ruled was "the great city" (uru-gal)\ great, indeed, it must have been, for it contained all the multi
tudes of men who had passed away from the earth.
Like the city over which he ruled, the god, too, was
himself " great." He came, therefore, to be familiarlv
known as Xergal—Mrwal in the dialect of Accad— "the
great Xer," or " hero." A punning etymology connected
his name with "the great city" (uru-gal), as if it had
been Ne(r)-uru-gal, "the Ner of Hades." But he was
also "king of Cutha," as well as of "the desert" on

(where " the god of the high voice" is said to be ner). A play seems to be intended on gir (ngir), "the lightning-flash," which was numru in Assyrian, rendered by ner in W.A.I, iv. 5, 15. Numru in the Accado-Semitic of northern Babylonia was written in rebus fashion num-gir, i.e. num-mir. Nerra was pronounced Xgirra ; hence the gloss lira.

whose borders Cutha stood and where its necropolis was
probably situated; while other titles made him "king of
heaven," "the king who marches before Anu," "the
king Xcrra," and "the mighty sovereign of the deep." 1 At Cutha he had been known in pro-Semitic days as
Aria, "the founder," and his wrorshippers had called him
Allamu and Almu, the god " tvho issues forth in might." 2
But his most frequent appellation is U-gur, the god of
" the falchion," 3 and under this name he tended to become
separate from Nergal, the god of the tomb, and to be
regarded as, like the Sun-god Adar, the champion of the
gods. It was as the death-dealing lord of Hades that Nergal
first became "the hero of the gods," "who marches in
their front." The metaphor was taken from the champion
who, like Goliath, places himself before his comrades and
1 W.A.I, ii. 54, 5. The title "king of heaven" must go back to days when the sky-god of Erech was as yet unknown at Cutha, while the title "great king of the deep" indicates a connection with Eridu.
In Phoenicia, we are told, he was known as Sar-rabu, " the great king," and among the Shuites on the western bank of the Euphrates as Emu.
Emu is letter for letter the national god of the Ammonites, Ammi, which, as Dr. Neubauer has shown, appears as 'Am in such Hebrew names as Jerobo-am and Rehobo-am.
- Allam-ta-ea. Allam may be connected with alam, " an image,"
which probably has the same root as alad, " a colossus," alal or ala,
" a demon," alala, " the Sun-god," who was afterwards identified with
Anu, and ulim, " a steer," literally " the strong animal." But the word also seems to have been read 'Sulim (see W. A. I. ii. 61. 72, 73).
3 W. A. I. ii. 2, 342. As Ugur, the god was also worshipped as
"Xcrgal of the Jchddhi," or "apparitions" (W. A. I. iii. 67, 70). In later times the name may have been divided into U-gur, "lord of the gur" which would then have been confounded with gur, "the deep"
(in Sumerian), one of the titles of Ea being En-gar, "lord of the deep" (W.A.I, ii. 58, 53).



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 197
challenges the enemy to combat. It is thus that we read
in the story of the Deluge, when the flood of rain and
destruction is described as coming upon the guilty world :
"Kimmon in the midst of (heaven) thundered, and Nebo
and the Wind-god went in front ; the throne-bearers went
over mountain and plain ; Nergal the mighty removes
the wicked ; Adar goes in front and casteth down." :
As lord of Hades, too, he was made the son of Mul-lil.
A hymn (K 5268), the colophon of which tells us that it
was composed in Cutha, begins with the words : "Let
Nergal be glorified, the hero of the gods, who cometh
forth as the strong one, the son of Mul-lil." In the same
hymn, Marad is declared to be his city, from which we
may infer that Marad was near Cutha. Its protecting
divinity, however, was, strictly speaking, Lugal-tiida, "the
royal offspring," or perhaps "valiant king," a personification of the thunder - cloud and lightning; but it is
evident from the hymn that he had been identified with
the death-dealing god of Cutha. Of Laz, the wife of
Nergal, we know little or nothing. Her name survived
as the local divinity of Cutha, but her office and attri
butes were taken by Allat. Even Nergal himself as
the lord of Hades belongs rather to the Accadian than
to the Semitic period. Among the Semites he was the
hero and champion of the gods, and as such the destroyer
of the wicked, rather than the king of death avIio slays
alike the wicked and the good. The sovereignty of
Hades had passed out of his hands, and he had become

the companion of the solar Adav and the wamor of the
gods of heaven.
Under his old name of Ner, however, a curious remi
niscence of his primitive character lasted down to late
times. In the hymns and other poetical effusions, we
not nnfrequently come across the phrase, "mankind, the cattle of the god ISer." I have already drawn attention
to the agricultural nature of early Chalckean civilisation, and the influence that agriculture had upon the modes
of thought and expression of the population. Not only
was the sky regarded as the counterpart of the Babylonian plain, and the heavenly bodies transformed into
the herds and flocks that fed there, but the human
inhabitants of the earth were themselves likened to the
cattle they pastured and fed. One of the earliest titles
of the Babylonian kings was " shepherd," reminding us
of the Homeric ttoi^v Aawv/j "shepherd of nations;" and
in the Epic of Gisdlmbar the sovereign city of Erech is
termed the subur, or "shepherd's hut." Just as the
subjects of the king, therefore, were looked upon as the sheep whom their ruler shepherded, so too mankind in
general were regarded as the cattle slain by the god of
death. They were, in fact, his herd, whom he fed and
slaughtered in sacrifice to the gods. 1
But apart from phrases of this kind, which embalmed
the beliefs and ideas of a half-forgotten age, NergaJ of Cutha was a decaying godhead. His power waned with

the rise and growth of Semitic influence in Babylonia.
He thus formed a strong contrast to the god of the air
and wind, whose cult belongs essentially to the Semitic
period. The primitive inhabitant of Babylonia paid a special
Worship to the winds. He beheld in them spirits of good
and evil. He prayed for "the good wind" which cooled
the heats of summer and brought moisture to the parched
earth, and he saw in the storm and tempest, in the freez
ing blasts of winter and the hot wind that blew from the
burning desert, "the seven evil spirits." They were the demons "who had been created in the lower part of
heaven," and who warred against the Moon-god when he suffered eclipse. They were likened to all that was
most noxious to man. The first, we are told, was "the
sword (or lightning) of rain ;" the second, " a vampire j"
1
the third, "a leopard;" the fourth, "a serpent;" the
fifth, "a watch-dog" (?); the sixth, "a violent tempest
which (blows) against god and king ;" and the seventh, "a baleful wind." But their power caused them to be
dreaded, and they were venerated accordingly. It was
remembered that they were not essentially evil. They,
too, had been the creation of Ann, for they came forth
from the sky, and all seven were " the messengers of Ann
their king." In the war of the gods against the dragon
of chaos, they had been the allies of Merodach. We
read of them that ere the great combat began, the god
1 Usumgdlu, expressed by ideographs that signify " the solitary
monster." It denoted a fabulous beast which " devoured the corpses of the dead" (W. A. T. ii. 19, 62), and was therefore not exactly a vampire, which devoured the living, but corresponded rather to one of the creatures mentioned in Is. xm. 21, 22, xxxiv. Ii.



200 LECTURE III.
"created the evil wind, the hostile wind, the tempest,
the storm, the four winds, the seven winds, the whirl
wind, the unceasing wind." When Merodach had slung
forth his boomerang 1 and hit the dragon, "the evil wind
that seizes behind showed its face. And Tiamat (the
dragon of the sea) opened her mouth to swallow it, but
(the god) made the evil wind descend so that she could
not close her lips ; with the force of the winds he filled
her stomach, and her heart was sickened and her mouth
distorted." Down to the closing days of the Assyrian
empire, the four winds, "the gods of Nipur," were still
worshipped in Assyria (W. A. I. iii. 66, Rev. 26), and
Saru, the Wind-god, is mentioned as a separate divinity
in the story of the Deluge. Among the winds there Avas one whose name awakened
feelings of dread in the mind of every Babylonian. This was the tempest, called mdtu in Accadian, 2 and abub in
Semitic. It was the tempest which had been once sent
by Bel to drown guilty mankind in the waters of a deluge,
and whose return as the minister of divine veno'cance
was therefore ever feared. As each year brought with it
the month of Sebat or January, with its " curse of rain,"
the memory of that terrible event rose again in the Baby
1 The word means literally " tlie cord of a snare." Zimmern there
fore thinks of "net," but the sculptures show that a boomerang is meant.

It is probably a contraction of Martu, since in the name of the god who afterwards came to correspond to the Semitic Kamman, the first syllable is represented by the character which usually has the value of mar.

varying forms of mal, mar and md

Ionian mind. Matu was a god whose favour had to bo
conciliated, and whose name accordingly appears on
numbers of early cylinders. But though Matu was thus specially identified with
the great tempest which formed an era in Babylonian history, it was not forgotten that he was but one of several
storm-gods, who were therefore spoken of as "the gods
Matu." 1 Like the clouds, they were children of the sea,
and were thus included in the family of Ea. It is possible
that this genealogy was due to the systematising labours
of a later day ; but it is also possible that the gods Matu
were primarily adored in Eridu, and that Eridu, and not
Surippak, was the original city of the Chalda?an Noah.
It is at least noticeable that the immortal home of the
translated Xisuthros was beyond the mouth of the Eu
phrates, near which Eridu was built.
If Eridu were the birth-place of Matu, it would explain
why the god of the tempest was also the god of the
western wind. Elsewhere in Babylonia, the western
wind blew from across the desert and brought heat with
it rather than rain. But in those remote days, when the
northern portion of the Persian Gulf had not as yet been
filled up with miles of alluvial deposit, a westerly breeze
could still come to Eridu across the water. In a peni
tential psalm,'2 Matu, "the lord of the mountain" (mulu
mursamma-lil), whose wife, " the lady of the mountain," is mentioned on the monuments of Tel-loh, is invoked
along with his consort Gubarra, Ea, " the sovereign of
heaven and earth and sovereign of Eridu," Dav-kina,
Merodach, Zarpanit, Nebo and Nana— in short, along
i W. A. I. ii. 56. 41, 42. * W. A. I. iv. 21, 2.



202 LECTURE III.
with the gods of Eridu and the kindred deities of Baby
lon. It is true that the Matu of this psalm is not the
Matu of the west, but of the eastern mountains of Elam ;
ive have seen, however, that more than one Matu was
worshipped in primitive days, and it is the cradle and
starting-point of the name which we are now seeking tc
discover.
But whether or not Eridu were really the first home
of the cult of a god (or gods) Matu, it was with the
west that he came to be chiefly identified. Titnim, the
old Accadian name of the land of Canaan, became the
land of Matu, which the Semites, who faced the rising
sun in their prayers, rendered by Akkarru, " the hinder
country." His worship was carried by Aramaean tribes
across the desert to Syria and Damascus. But before
this happened, a change had taken place in the character
of Matu himself. He had ceased to be Accadian and
had been transformed into a Semitic god, absorbing into
himself at the same time the name and attributes of
another deity.
This other deity was the god of the town of Muru, who
represented the air, more especially the atmosphere when lighted up by the rays of the sun. His Accadian name
was Men, "the exalted" or "glorious," known also as
Mer-mer, " the very glorious." He represented what the
Semitic Babylonians termed the sarurut or "shining fir
mament." His Accadian name was literally translated
into Semitic as Ramanu, " the exalted one," which later
generations connected witha root signifying "to thunder,"
and so wrote Rammanu (for Ramimanu), "the thun
derer." The Hebrew Masoretes started vet another false
etymology. They identified the word with rimmon, "a



THK GODS OF BABYLONIA. 203
pomegranate," and punctuated it accordingly in the passages in which it occurs in the Old Testament. As,
however, the form Eimmon has thus become familiar to
English ears, while Eamman is of strange sound, it is best to adhere to the Hebraised form of the god's name,
in spite of its etymological incorrectness. Eimmon, there
fore, and not Eaman or Eamman, is the form which I
shall employ in these Lectures. 1
Now Eimmon, as wc learn from the books of Kings,
was the supreme god of the Syrians of Damascus. He
was there identified with the Sun-god Hadad, the all
powerful Baal of the northern Syrian tribes. As far
south as the plain of Jezrcel, according to Zechariah
xii. 11, the worship of Hadad-Eimmon was celebrated,
and Hadad-Eimmon is but a compound form which ex
presses the identity of Eimmon and Hadad. The same
fact is made known to us by the Assyrian inscriptions. Not only has Mr. Pinches 2 brought to light a series of
four documents belonging to the beginning of the reign
of Nabonidos, in which mention is made of a Syrian
named Bin-Addu-natanu or Ben-Hadad-nathan, " the son

chieftains written with the ideographs which denote the

Hadad-ezer, in the records of Shalmaneser II. The name
made its way to the non-Semitic tribes of the Taurus.
A Komagenian sovereign bears the name of Kigiri-Dada, which appears also under the abbreviated form of Giri
Dadi ; and Dalilu was a Kaskian or Kolkhian king in
the time of Tiglath-Pileser III. ; while Dadi was a ruler
of Khubuskia, to the south-west of Armenia. That Hadad
was adored even in Edom is shown by the names of the
Edomite kings, Hadad the son of Bedad, and Hadad the
adversary of Solomon.
In Bedad, which stands for Ben-Dad, the exact equiva
lent of Ben-Hadad, we meet with the same shortened
form of the name as that which we find in the Assyrian
inscriptions. It is possible, therefore, that it was confused
with another title of the Sun-god in Canaan, Dod or David,
"the beloved one," the feminine correlative of which is
found in the familiar Dido. Dido was the goddess of
Carthage, not unnaturally confounded, by the piety of later ages, with Elissa, the foundress of the city. Like
Hadad of Edom, David of Israel will thus have borne a
name which the people about him applied to their sove
reign god. It may be that those scholars are right who
believe that the real name of the sweet psalmist of Israel
was El-hanan or Baal-hanan ; if so, David will have been
a popular title derived from a popular appellation of the Deity. He will thus have shared the fate of his son and
successor, whose true name Jedidiah was changed into
Solomon—the name of the old Semitic " god of peace"
when David sat at rest within the walls of his new
capital, Jerusalem, the city of "peace," and had rest from his enemies on every side. 1
"" See above, p. 57.



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 205
Hadad, Addu or Dadda, never superseded the native
name of Ramanu (Ramman) in Babylonia and Assyria, and remained foreign to the last. Ramanu, however, was
sometimes addressed as Barqu or Barak, " the lightning;"
and it is possible that antiquarian zeal may have also
sometimes imposed on him the Accadian title of Meru.
He grew continuously in popular favour. In Semitic Babylonia, and yet more in Semitic Assyria, his aid was
constantly invoked; and, like Ami, Bel and Ea, he tended as time went on to become more and more national in
character. Ramman is one of the least local of Babv
Ionian gods.
This was due in great measure to the nature of his
origin. He began as the amalgamation of two distinct
deities, the wind-god and the air-god, and the extension
of his cult was marked by the absorption into his person
of the various deities of the winds adored by the older
faith. He continued to grow at their expense. The
spirits of the winds and storms sank lower and lower ;
and while the beneficent side of their operation attached
itself to Ramman, there remained to them only that side
which was harmful and demoniac.
The evolution illustrates the way in which the Baby
lonian sought to solve the mystery of evil. The divine
powers he worshipped had once been alike the creators
of good and the creators of evil ; like the powers of nature
which they represented, they had been at once beneficent
and malevolent. By degrees, the two aspects of their
character came to be separated. The higher gods came
to be looked upon as the hearers of prayer and the
bestowers of all good gifts; while the instruments of
their vengeance and the inflictors of suffering and misery



206 LECTURE III.
upon man were the inferior spirits of the lower sphere.
But the old conception, which derived both good and evil
from the same source, did not wholly pass away. Evil
never came to be regarded as the antagonist of good ; it
was rather the necessary complement and minister of good.
The supreme Baal thus preserved his omnipotence, while at the same time the ideas of pain and injustice were
dissociated from him. In his combat with the dragon of
chaos, Merodach summons the "evil wind" itself to
his assistance ; and in the legend of the assault of the
seven wicked spirits upon the Moon, they are nevertheless
called " the messengers of Anu their king." Xerra, the
god of plague and destruction, smites the people of Babylonia on account of their sins by the command of the
cods, like the angel with the drawn sword whom David
saw standing over Jerusalem at the threshing-floor of
Araunah ; and in the story of the Deluge it is because
of the wickedness of mankind that the flood is brought
upon the earth. The powers of darkness arc degraded
from their ancient position of independence, and either
driven, like Tiamat, beyond the bounds of the created
world, or reduced to the condition of ministers of divine
wrath.
If we would realise how widely removed is this con
ception of them as the instruments of divine anger from
that earlier view in which they are mere elemental
powers, in themselves neither good nor evil, we cannot
do better than compare these legendary compositions of the Semitic period with the old Accadian hymns that
relate to the seven harmful spirits. Let us listen to one,
for instance, which probably emanated from Eridu aud
applied originally to the "Matu gods:"

evil !

Another poet of Eridu, in a hymn to the Fire-god.
speaks of the seven spirits in similar language :
1 The Semitic translator misrenders : "gods of the hosts (of the
firmament)."
? "W. A. I. iv. 1. ii. 65 —iii. 26. The hymn is interrupted by a
magical text, a later portion of it being quoted further on (2. v. 30 — 59) as follows : 1. " Seven are they, seven are they ! 2. In the hollow of the deep, seven are they !
3. (In) the glory of heaven, seven are they ! 4. In the hollow of the deep in a palace grew they up ! (In the original, "from the hollow .... came they forth"). 5. Male they are not, female they are not !

"O cod of Fire," ho asks, "how were those seven begotten, how
grew they up ? Those seven in the mountain of the sunset were born ; those seven in the mountain of the sunrise grew up."
Throughout they arc regarded as elemental powers, and their true character as destructive winds and tempests
is but thinly veiled by a cloak of poetic imagery. But
it will be noticed that they already belong to the harm
ful side of nature ; and though the word which I have
rendered " evil," after the example of the Semitic trans
lators, means rather "injurious'- than " evil" in our sense
of the word, they are already the products of night and darkness ; their birth-place is the mountain behind which
the sun sinks into the gloomy lower world. In the 22nd
book of the great work on Astronomy, compiled for Sar
gon of Accad, they are termed "the seven great spirits "
or galli^ and it is therefore possible that they had already
been identified with the " seven gods of destiny,'' the
Aniina-ge or "spirits of the lower world," of the cult of
Nipur. In their gradual development into the Semite Kimmon,
the spirits of the air underwent a change of parentage.
Matu. as we have seen, was, like his kindred wind-gods
of Eridu. the offspring of Ea. But the home of the wind
is rather the sky than the deep, and Men, "the shining
firmament," was naturally associated with the sky. When
Ana, "the sky." therefore, became the Semitic Ami, Rimmon, who united in himself Matu and Meri and other
local gods of wind and weather as well, was made his
6on. It is possible that there was another cause working
1 W.A.I, iii. 62, 12. Gallu was a loan-word from the Sumeriam gulla, mulla in Accadiau.



THE OOPS OF BABYI.OXTA. 200
towards the same result. In Syria, Simmon was iden
tified with Hadad the Sun-god, and there are indications
that in parts of Babylonia also he had at one time a solar
character. As Meri (or Mem), he could easily pass into
a solar divinity, more esj)ecially as the re -duplicated
Mer-mer, " the most glorious,
- ; was a title of the meridian
Sun, who was identified in later days with Adar of Nipur, 1
while it was also the name of Eimmon himself as adored
in one of the smaller towns of Chaldrea.2 We are told,
moreover, that Eimmon was the god who had gone under
the Accadiau appellation of Utu-edina-guba, " the ever
glowing sun of the desert." 3 The elements, therefore,
existed among the Babylonians, as well as among the Aramaeans, out of which Eimmon could have been trans
formed into a solar deity ; it was only the stronger non
Semitic influence which caused them to be displaced by
the associations and conceptions that confined his sphere
to the air. Eimmon, accordingly, among the Babylonians and Assyrians, is the god of winds and cloud, of thunder
and lightning, of storm and rain ; he is the inundator
who is called upon to cover the fields of the impious and
unjust with water, and to pour his refreshing streams
into a thirsty land. His wife went by the Accadiau

bound its several parts together. When mermer is explained by riickltu,
" storm," in W. A. I. v. 11, 46, nothing more is meant than that the god Mermer had come to represent the storm. It is an illustration of the caution needed in dealing with the statements of the so-called lexical lists.

210 LECTURE III.
name of Sala, "the merciful" (?).* As her husband had
been identified with " the lord of the mountain," so she
too was identified with "the lady of the mountain," 2 to
whom Gudea had built a temple at Tel-loh. As "lady
of the mountain," however, she was more strictly the consort of the Sun-god of Eridu ; and a mythological tablet
speaks accordingly of a " Sala of the mountains, the wife
of Merodach." 3 It is to Zarpanit, the wife of Merodach,
again, and not to Sala, that Nebuchadnezzar refers, when
he tells us how he " built in Babylon the House Supreme,
the temple of the lady of the mountain, for the exalted
goddess, the mother who had borne" him. Sala and
Zarpanit, therefore, must once have been one and the
same divinity.
1 The Accadian equivalent of riminu, "merciful," is written with the ideographs sag or sa, "heart," led or la, '-filling," and sucl or m, "extending" (W. A. I. iv. 9, 27, &c). But the final character is pro
bably a determinative only, giving the idea of "long-suffering," in which case we should read sala instead of salasu. In W. A. I. iv. 19,
41, the word is apparently written phonetically, as mij-lil-da : if so, wo must read saqlal instead of sala. The name of the «oddess might then be explained as " woman," sala having this meaning in Accadian. The name seems to be interpreted "the goddess of reptiles" (nalri and namse), as well as "the lady of the place of gold," in W. A. I. ii. 57, 33 (where, by the way, the character dil has the meaning of "place,"
which it has in Amaidian or " Protomedic," and in gis-dil-te, the ideo
graphic mode of writing guza, "a throne"). The mountains, more especially those of the north, were "the land of gold."
2 W. A. I. ii. 57, 33.
8 In W. A. I. iii. 67, 34, Sala is stated to be "the wife of Mul-lil
in the ghost-world." But this seems to refer only to Mul-lil as the Semitic Bel, a Sun-god who rules among the shades below. It is thus
that she is called the wife of Duzu or Tammuz (ii. 57, 34) like A (ii.
57. 12). She was, in fact, originally the goddess of the Sun, and con* scquently her connection with Ram man must have been the result of Ins amalgamation with Mer or Mermer.



THE GODS OP BABYLONIA. 211
Sala was, furthermore, the "lady (or exalted lady) of
the desert" — a title which brings to one's recollection
the similar title of Kimmon, as " the ever-glowing sun
of the desert-land." It is under this title that she is
addressed in a penitential psalm, where she is named,
not Sala, but Gubara, "the fire-flame," and associated with Matu (Mato), "the lord of the mountain." 1 As
the other deities invoked along with her are Ea and
Dav-kina, Merodach and Zarpanit, Nebo and Tasmit, while the whole psalm is dedicated to Nana, the goddess
of Ercch, it is clear that the psalm is the composition
of a worshipper of Nana and native of Erech, whose gods
were the gods of Eridu and those who claimed kindred
with them.
We may, therefore, see in the primitive Sala the female
consort of the Sun-gocl of Eridu—the original, in fact, of
the Babylonian Zarpanit, who became identified on the
one side with the " lady of the mountain," and on the
other with the wife of Meri, the "bright firmament" of
the starry sky. Her name, Gubara, points to her solar connection, and makes it probable that she was not the
moon—which does not seem to have been regarded as
a goddess in any part of Babylonia—nor the dawn, but
the evening and morning star. This will explain why it is that she was known as the goddess of the mountains,
over whose heights Yenus arose and set, or as the mistress
of wisdom and hidden treasure, or, again, as the goddess
of the copper hand. 2 Other mythologies have stories of
1 W. A. I. iv. 21, No. 2.
* W. A. I. ii. 57, 35. The Sun-god Savitar is called " the goldenhanded" in the Veda, a term explained in later Sanskrit literature by the statement that the hand of the god had been cut at a sacrifice and
p2



212 LECTURE III.
a solar hero whose hand has been cut off and replaced
by one of gold and bronze, and it is in the light of such
stories that the epithet must be explained. We are
expressly told that Sala of the copper hand was the wife
of Tammuz, the beautiful Sun-god of Eridu; 1 and we
know that Tammuz, the son of the Biver-god Ea,- was
the spouse of Istar, the evening star. What wonderT
then, that her later husband Rimmon should have become
the Sun-god of the Syrians, whose untimely death was mourned in the plaiu of Jezreel, as the untimely death
of his double, the Babylonian Tammuz, was mourned by the women of Phoenicia and Jerusalem ?
I must reserve the story of Tammuz and Istar for
another Lecture. We have almost completed now our
survey of the principal deities of Babylonia, of those who in the struggle for existence outdistanced their compeers,
and in the official inscriptions of Assyria and later Baby
lonia appear at the head of the divine hierarchy. Purely
local in their origin, their worship gradually extended
itself chiefly through the influence of the cities that wor
shipped them, and absorbed at the same time the local
cults that came in their way. The adoption of Accadian
forms of worship by the Semites was accompanied by a
process of generalisation and systematisation. The reli
gion of Accad was adapted to the religious ideas of the
Semites, and was transformed accordingly. The Baalim of
the Semite took the place of the dingirene or " creators" of
the Accadian. The Sun-god assumed a new and impor
replaced by a golden one. The Teutonic Tyr is similarly one-handed,, and the Keltic Nuad with the silver hand offers a close parallel to the
Chaldsean goddess with the copper hand.

tant place. Wherever the Semite was wholly triumph
ant, wherever he succeeded iu founding an empire, as at
Sippara and Babylon, the Sun-sod acquired undisputed sway. Wherever the older population maintained its
ground, as at Nipur or Eridu, the older deities, leavened
and transformed though they may have been by Semitic
til; >nght, still continued to hold their own. In places
like Erech, where Accadian and Semitic influences seem
to have long struggled for the mastery, the old sky-god remained indeed in name, but was changed into a Semitic
Baal.
But the process of transformation was long, and it
needed many centuries before it was complete. We
have glimpses out of the distant past of a time whe-r. the
two populations lived side by side in peace or war, fight
ing, trading and intermarrying, of Semitic conquerors filling their courts with Accadian scribes and patronising
the study of Accadian literature, and of Accadian dynasties
rising at times in Semitic states. Babylonia in those
days must have afforded a close parallel to Egypt during
the centuries of Hvksos dominion. The Semitic invaders
of Egypt soon submitted to the spell of the higher culture
in the midst of which they found themselves. They
borrowed the titles of the Pharaohs ; they patronised the
learning of their Egyptian subjects ; and while asserting
the supremacy of their own Baal Sutekh, they yet identi
fied him with the Egyptian Set and adopted the divinities
of the Egyptian pantheon. The learned court of an
Apepi Ra-aa-user, which produced one of the two treatises
on Egyptian geometry that have survived to us, offers a
close parallel to the court of a Sargon of Accad, which



214 LECTURE III.
witnessed the compilation of the standard Babylonian
works on astrology and terrestrial omens.
V)\\t there was one important difference between Egypt
and Babylonia. With the help of Nubian allies, the
Egyptians of the south succeeded, after five hundred
years of submission, in driving the Semitic stranger from the northern land he had made his own. The older
population of southern Babylonia was never so fortunate.
The Semite had come into Chaldsea not onlv as a warrior,
but as a trader as well. He had planted himself too
firmly in the cities of the north to be ever expelled. In
Genesis we see Nimrod, the representative of Semitic
domination, establishing his kingdom, not 011I3' in Babel and Erech and Accad, but also in Calneh or Kulunu in
Shinar (Snmer) of the south. And a time came when
Calneh ceased to be the only state of Sumer which
acknowledged the supremacy of the foreigner. Eridu itself, the sacred city of an immemorial past, the primal
home of Chaldoean culture, became Semitic, and the
monarchs of Babylonia assumed the imperial title of
kings of Accad and Sumer.
But all this happened long before the age of Kham
muragas, with whom the history of the city of Babylon
begins. The Babylonia of Ivhammuragas differs but
little from the Babylonia of Nabonidos. The religious
system of the country is already fully formed. Nay, more ; already in the remote age of Sargon of Accad
there arc indications that the process of assimilation and
absorption had long been at work. The son and suc
cessor of Sargon was Naram-Sin, "the beloved of the
Moon-god," a sign that the Moon-god of Ur was even



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 215
now in favour in the court of Accad. In fact, it must
have been among the priestly literati of Sargon that the
union of Accadian and Semitic religious belief took defi
nite shape. It marked the union of the Accadian and
Semitic elements in the population under Semitic rule.
It is possible that some of the mythological tablets in
which an attempt is made to harmonise the deities of the
various local cults and to bring them into genealogical
order, may go back to this early date. It is more pro
bable, however, that they all belong to that later period when northern and southern Babylonia had long formed
an united monarchy.
Unchecked, the tendency of Semitic religions thought would have been to resolve the gods of the popular faith
into one supreme Baal, by the side of whom was throned
his colourless double or wife. This tendency actually
found expression in certain cases. But the cities of
Babylonia had too venerable a history to allow their local
deities to be thus confounded and lost, and the non
Semitic element in the population, though less and less
represented in official documents, placed a check upon it. It wns the genealogical theory, resuscitated in after times
in the Gnostic doctrine of emanations, which obtained
most favour. The gods became a family, and their
temples palaces in which attendant spirits ministered to
their wants.
At the head of the pantheon stood the trinity of Aim,
Bel of Nipur and Ea. The order in which they were
ranked indicates the relative periods at which the three
gods and the cities which originally worshipped them became the property of the Semitic race. The rise of
Babylon, however, brought with it the displacement of



216 LECTURE III.
the older Bel of Nipur. He was forced to yield to his
younger rival Bel Merodach, causing endless confusion
to the Babylonian mythologists. Around the three chief gods were grouped the multi
tudinous deities which Accadian superstition or Semitic
piety had invented and dreamed of. Assur-natsir-pal
declares that there were " 65,000 great gods of heaven
and earth ;" and though we may doubt whether the
Assyrian king was not indulging in a little royal exaggeration, it is certain that the task of enumerating them
all would have exhausted the most indefatigable of
priestly scribes. Besides the numberless minor deities of
the towns and villages, there were the divine titles out of
which new gods had been evolved ; divinities which owed
their existence to the linguistic or literary errors of the
Semites ; and, finally, foreign gods like Kittum and Suma
1 iya of the Ivosseeans, or Lagamar of Susa. As if this goodly
host were not enough, phrases from the ritual of the
temples were elevated to the rank of gods. E-Sagil, for
instance, the temple of Merodach at Babylon, was deified
under the name of "What does my lord eat?" and the
spirit of E-Sagil was known as "What does my lord
drink?" 1 while the divine porters of the temple were
termed respectively "the binder of the waters of the god
of the sea," and " the giver of water for (purifying) the
hand." 2 When we remember how the background of
this vast pantheon was tilled with the obscure deities aud
spirits of the ancient Accadian cult, whose names survived
in magical charms and exorcisms, while the air above was
occupied by the " 300 spirits of heaven," and the earth
1 YV. A. T. ii. 56. ]G. 17 2 W. A. f. ii. 50. 18. 19.



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 21 i
below by " the 600 spirits of earth," we begin to realise
the force of the expression which made the supreme gods
rulers of the " legions" of earth and sky. Bil Icissat,
" the
lord of hosts," was a phrase full of significance to the believing Babylonian.
It would be useless to waste our time over deities who
never obtained a prominent place in the official hierarchy
of the gods, and of whom Ave know little beyond the names.
Now and again, when the Assyrian kings made a triumphal
march through Babylonia, they sacrificed to the gods of
the cities through which they passed, and we hear of
Latarak the son of Anu, of Subulu, or of Utsur-amat-sa ;
but they probably knew as little about them as we do.
It is only from local documents like contracts and boun
dary-stones that we can expect to learn anything about such deities as Supu of Der, and Tug of Kis with the
dragon's face, and what we learn will seldom throw
much light on Babylonian religion as a whole. When
Nebuchadnezzar gathered the gods of Babylonia into his
capital in token that the god of Babylon was henceforth
lord of all the Chaldsean gods, with two exceptions it is
only to deities like Sin and Samas, Bimmon and Gula,
that he erected shrines. "The lady of the house of
heaven" and " the divine son of the house" are the only
divinities whom he mentions that bear unaccustomed
names, and they are doubtless merely titles of Beltis and
Adar or NergaL As long, however, as these multitudinous deities were
believed to exist, so lon^ was it also believed that they
could injure or assist. Hence come such expressions as
those which meet us in the Penitential Psalms, " To the
god that is known and that is unknown, to the goddess



218 LECTURE III.
that is known and that is unknown, do I lift ray prayer."
Hence, too, the care with which the supreme Baal was
invoked as " lord of the hosts of heaven and earth," since
homage paid to the master was paid to the subjects as well. Hence, finally, the fact that the temples of the
higher gods, like the Capitol at Borne, became gathering
places for the inferior divinities, and counterparts on the earth of "the assembly of the gods" in heaven. That
curious product of Mandaite imagination, the " Book
of Nabathean Agriculture," which was translated into
Arabic by Ibn Wahshiya in the 10th century, sets before
us a curious picture of the temple of Tammuz in Babylon.
"The images (of the gods)," it tells us, "congregated from all parts of the world to the temple of el-Askul
(E-Sagil) in Babylon, and betook themselves to the temple
{haikal) of the Sim, to the great golden image that is suspended between heaven and earth in particular. The
image of the sun stood, they say, in the midst of the
temple, surrounded by all the images of the world. Next
to it stood the images of the sun in all countries; then
those of the moon ; next those of Mars ; after them the
images of Mercury ; then those of Jupiter ; next of
Venus; and last of all, of Saturn. Thereupon the image
of the sun began to bewail Tammuz and the idols to
weop ; and the image of the sun uttered a lament over
Tammuz and narrated his history, whilst the idols all
wept from the setting of the sun till its rising at the end
of that night. Then the idols flew away, returning to
their own countries."
The details are probably borrowed from the great temple
of pro-Mohammedan Mecca, but they correspond very faithfully with what we now know the interior of one of



THE GODS OF BABYLONIA. 219
the chief temples of Babylonia and Assyria to have been
like. Fragments have been preserved to us of a tablet
which enumerated the names of the minor deities whose
images stood in the principal temples of Assyria, attending like servants upon the supreme god. Among them
are the names of foreign divinities, to whom the catholic
spirit of Babylonian religion granted a place in the national pantheon when once the conquest of the towns
and countries over which they presided had proved their
submission to the Babylonian and Assyrian gods ; even
Khaldis, the god of Ararat, figures among those who dwelt in one of the chief temples of Assyria, 1 and whose
names were invoked by the visitor to the shrine. The
spectacle of such a temple, with the statue or symbol of
the supreme Baal rising majestically in the innermost cell, and delivering his oracles from within the hidden
chamber of that holy of holies, while the shrines of his
wife and offspring were grouped around him, and the
statues of ministering deities stood slave-like in front,
was a fitting image of Babylonian religion. " The gods many and lords many" of an older creed still survived,
but they had become the jealously-defined officials of an
autocratic court. The democratic polytheism of an earlier
day had become imperial. Bel was the counterpart of
his vicegerent the Babylonian king, with this difference,
that whereas Babylonia had been fused into an united
monarchy, the hierarchy of the gods still acknowledged more than one head. How long Anu and Ea, or Samas
and Sin, would have continued to share with Metodach
the highest honours of the official cult, we cannot say ;
1 W. A. I. iii. 6G, Rev. 7.



220 LECIVK* ill.
the process of degradation had already begun when
Babylonia ceased to be an independent kingdom and Babylon the capital of an empire. Merodach remained
a supreme Baal—the cylinder inscription of Cyrus proves
so much—but he never became the one supreme god.



Lectuhe IV.
TAMMUZ AND ISTAE; PROMETHEUS AND
TOTEMISM.
Among the mythological poems bequeathed to us bv ancient Babylonia is one which., though doubtless based
on Accadian materials, has survived to us only in a Semi
tic form. It recounts the descent of the goddess Istar
into Hades in search of the healing waters which should
restore to life her bridegroom Tammuz, the young and
beautiful Sun-god, slain by the cruel hand of night and
winter. The poem is as follows :
1. "To the land whence none return, the region of (darkness),
2. Istar, the daughter of Sin, (inclined) her ear,

The poem throws light upon certain passages both in
the Old Testament and in classical authors, and in turn
receives light from them. On the one hand, we now
know who was that Tammuz in whose honour Ezekiel
saw the women of Jerusalem weeping at the gate of
"the Lord's house." 1 On the other hand, it is clear that
the Tammuz and Tstar of the Babylonian legend are the
Adonis and Aphrodite of Greek mythology. Like Tam
muz, Adonis, the beloved one of Aphrodite, is slain by the boar's tusk of winter, but eventually ransomed from
Hades by the prayers of the goddess. It has long been
recognised that Aphrodite, the Kyprian goddess of love and war, came to Hellas from Phoenicia, whether or not
we agree with Dr. Hommcl in seeing in her name a
mere etymological perversion of the Phoenician Ashtoreth.
Ad. mis is the Phoenician Adoni, "my lord," the cry
with which the worshippers of the stricken Sun-god
mourned his untimely descent into the lower world.
The cry was familiar throughout the land of Palestine.
In the valley of Megiddo, by the plain of Jezreel, each year witnessed "the mourning for Hadad-Eimmon"
(Zech. xii. 11), while hard by Amos heard the men of

228 LECTURE IV.
Israel mourning for "the only son" (Am. viii. 10), and
the prophet of Judah gives the very words of the refrain:
"Ah me, my brother, and ah me, my sister! Ah me,
Adonis, and ah me, his lady!" (Jer. xxii. 18). The words were carried across the western sea to men of an
alien race and language. " Cry ailinon, ailinon ! woe,
woe!" says the Greek poet of Athens, 1 and. already in
Homeric days 2 the dirge was attributed to a mythic
Linos whose magic fate was commemorated in its open
ing words : "0 Linos, Linos!" Linos, however, had
no existence except in a popular etymology ; the Greek
ailinos is in reality the Phoenician ai-lcnu, " alas for us !"
with which the lamentations for the death of the divine
Adonis were wont to begin. Like the refrain quoted by
Jeremiah, the words eventually go back to Babylonia, and find their counterpart in the closing lines of the old
Babylonian poem I have translated above. When Tillili
commences her wail over the dead. Tammuz, she cries,
like the women of Judah and Phoenicia, " my brother,
the only one !" It was, above all, in the Phoenician town
of Gebal or Byblos that the death of Adonis was com
memorated. Here, eight miles to the north of Beyrut,
the ancient military road led from eastern Asia to the
shores of the Mediterranean, and brought from early
days the invading armies of Babylonia and Assyria to the coasts and cities of Canaan. Hard by was the river
of Adonis, the Xahr Ibrahim of to-day, which rolled
through a rocky gorge into the sea. Each year, when the rains and melting snows of spring stained its waters
with the red marl of the mountains, the people of Gebal
iEskhylos, A/jam. 121. i U. xviii. 570.



TAMMITZ AND ISTAR. 229
beheld in it the blood of the slaughtered Bun-god. It was
then, in the month of Taramuz or June, that the funeral
festival of the god was held. For seven days it lasted.
"Gardens of Adonis," as they were called, were planted, pots filled with earth and cut herbs, which soon withered
away in the fierce heat of the summer sun — fitting
emblems of the lost Adonis himself. Meanwhile, the
streets and gates of the temples were filled with throngs
of wailing women. They tore their hair, they disfigured the face, they cut the breast with sharp knives, in token
of the agony of their grief. Their cry of lamentation
went up to Heaven mingled with that of the Gralli, the
emasculated priests of Ashtoreth, who shared with them
their festival of woe over her murdered bridegroom.
Adonis, the young, the beautiful, the beloved of Ash
toreth, was dead ; the bright sun of the springtide, like the verdure of nature which he had called into life, was
slain and withered by the hot blasts of the summer.
In later times, after the revolt of Egypt from the
Assyrian king and the rise of the 26th Dynasty, the cult
of Adonis at Gebal entered upon a new phase. Egyptian
beliefs and customs made their way into Phoenicia along
with Egyptian political influence, and the story of Adonis was identified with that of the Egyptian Osiris. As the
Sun-god Osiris had been slain and had risen again from
the dead, so, too, had the Phoenician Adonis descended
into Hades and been rescued again from its grasp. How
long, indeed, he Uad remained in the world below was
a matter of doubt. There were some who said that he
shared half the year with the goddess of death, and the
other half only with the goddess of love ; there were
others who declared that his year was divided into three



230 LECTURE IV.
four months was he condemned to dwell in Hades, four
months he was free to live where he might choose, while
the other four were passed in the companionship of Ash
toreth, and that it was to Ashtoreth that he devoted his
months of freedom. But all agreed that the Sun-god of
spring was not compelled to live for ever in the gloomy
under-world ; a time came when he and nature would
alike revive. It was inevitable, therefore, that in the days
of Egyptianising fashion, Adonis and Osiris should be
looked upon as the same god, and that the festival of
Adonis at Gebal should be assimilated to that of Osiris
in Egypt. And so it came about that a new feature was
added to the festival of Adonis ; the days of mourning
were succeeded by days of rejoicing ; the death of Adonis
was followed by the announcement of his resurrection.
A head of papyrus came from Egypt over the waves ;
while, on the other hand, an Alexandrian legend told
how the mourning Isis had found again at Gebal the
chest in which the dismembered limbs of Osiris were laid.
It is clear that the Babylonian poet who sang of the
descent of Istar into Hades had no conception of a festival
of joy that followed immediately upon a festival of mourn
ing. Nevertheless, the whole burden of his poem is the
successful journey of the goddess into the under- world
for the sake of the precious waters which should restore
her beloved one to life. Even in Babylonia, therefore,
there must have been a season when the name of Taminuz
was commemorated, not with words of woe, but with joy
and rejoicing. But it could have been only when the
fierce heats of the summer were past ; when the northern
wind, which the Accadians called " the prospering one,"
began again to blow; and when the Sun-god regained



TAMMUZ AND ISTAE. 231
once more the vigour of his spring-tide youth. That there had once been a festival of this kind is indicated
by the fact that the lamentations for his death did not
take place in all parts of Syria at the same time. We
learn from Ammianus that when Julian arrived at Antioch
in the late autumn, he found the festival of Adonis being
celebrated " according to ancient usage," after the in
gathering of the harvest and before the beginning of the
new year, in Tisri or October. It must have been in
the autumn, too, that the feast of Hadad-Bimmon was
observed, to which Zechariah alludes ; and Ezekiel saw
the women weeping for Tammuz in " the sixth month."
Nay, Maerobius l even tells us that the Syrian worshippers
of Adonis in his time explained the boar's tusk which had
slain the god as the cold and darkness of winter, his
return to the upper world being his " victory over the
first six zodiacal signs, along with the lengthening day
light." We can draw but one conclusion from all this. The
resurrection of Tammuz had once been commemorated as
well as his death, and the festivals had been identified,
not only with that of the Egyptian Osiris, as at Grebal,
but also with those of other Semitic forms of the Sun-god,
of Hadad and of Eimmon. When Maerobius states that
Adad meant "the only one" in Syrian, he implies that
Adad or Hadad—the Sun-god whose festival fell after
the harvests of autumn—was identical with Tammuz.
In Babylonia, Tammuz was the Sun-god of spring ; his foe was the summer heat ; his death was mourned in the
month tof June. If there was another feast in which
grief gave place to joy at his restoration to life, it was
1 Saturn, i. 21.



232 LECTURE IV.
separate from that which celebrated his death, and must
have taken place at a different time of the year. In its
transplantation to the west, however, the cult of TammuzAdonis underwent a change. He was identified with
other forms of the solar deity ; his festivals were merged
into theirs; and, except in places like Gebal, where a
natural phenomenon prevented the alteration, the anniversary of his death was shifted to the fall of the year.
He ceased to be the Sun-god of spring, and became
the Sun-god of summer. In the highlands of Syria the
summer was not the dangerous foe it was in Babylonia ;
it was, on the contrary, a kindly friend, whose heats
quickened and fostered the golden grain. Winter, and not summer, was the enemy who had slain the god.
The story of Tammuz was not of Semitic invention,
however much it may owe, in the form in which we know
it, to Semitic imagination. The month of Tammuz was
called in the Accadian calendar " the month of the errand
of Istar," a clear proof that the legend of the Descent of
the goddess into Hades was already known. Kor is the
name of Tammuz itself of Semitic origin. The Semites
did not agree about the precise form which it should
assume, and it is probable that the form (Tammuz) which
prevailed in the west was due to a " popular etymology."
At all events, the Assyro-Babylonian form is not Tammuz, but Duzu, itself contracted from Duwuzu, and a fair
representative of the original Accadian Dumu-zi or
J)uwu-zi, " the son of life." The word was interpreted
by the Semites as meaning the " offspring," " the only son;" 1 but it may be merely a shortened form of the
name Dumu-zi-apzu, " the son of the spirit of the deep."
1 W. A. I. ii. 36, 54.



TAMMUZ AND ISTAR. 233
The " spirit of the deep" is of course Ea, as is expressly
stated in a mythological tablet, 1 where Dumu-zi-apzu is given as the name of one of his six sons. How early the
designation must be, is shown by the fact that Ea appears
in it as not yet a god, but as a spirit only. We are
carried back to the first dawn of Chaldaean religious
belief. The name was translated by the Semites ' l Timmuz
(or Dimmuz) of the flood" (W.A.I, ii. 47, 29), and the solar character of the deity was indicated by writing his
name with ideographs that signified "the maker of fire"
(tim-in). 2 But this very mode of writing the name,
which probably grew up in the court of Sargon of Accad, proves that already the name had lost its last element.
The "son of the spirit of the deep" had become "the
son of life," "the only son" of the god Ea. It is thus
that a mythological tablet gives "the River-god," who is but Ea under another title, a single son Duzi, 3 where
the name has assumed its contracted Semitic form, and
is written with ideographs that mean " the heart of life." 4
1 W. A. I. ii. 56, 33—38.
2 Tim-i:;e, or Dim-izi, is a good example of what Halevy has termed the rebus. As in several other cases, notably that of the Fire-god
Gibil, the two elements of the name are transposed in writing (Izi-tim instead of Tim-i::i). The tablet in which the name is explained is a
commentary on an old astrological text, giving explanations of the rare words and ideographs contained in the text. The text may have emanated from the court of Sargon at Accad. Izi is given as the pro
nunciation of the Accadian word for "fire" in 82. 8 — 16. 1. Rev. 15.
3 W.A.L ii. 56, 31.
4 The spelling may have originated at Accad. At all events, both A, the wife of the Sun-god of Sippara, and Sala, "of the mountain of gold," are called the wives of Duzu in W. A. I. ii. 57. 12. 34. It is possible that in W. A. I. ii. 54. 8, 9, we ought to read Duzu and Dazu; if so, the two primordial principles, the male Duzu and the female



234 LECTURE IV.
We have just seen that the pronunciation Timmuz
was once known to the Babylonian scribes. But it never
found its way into the language and literature of the
country. The medial labial became a semi-vowel ; and
the attempt to give a Semitic colouring to the word
by hardening the initial consonant, never succeeded in
expelling the pronunciation which their Accadian neighbours had made familiar to the Semites of Babylonia.
The case, however, was different in other portions of the
Semitic world. Here there was no Accadian population
to prevent the Semitised form from holding full sway,
and it was accordingly as Tammuz (or Timmuz) that the
name passed to the west. It is probable that the inter
mediaries were those Aramaean tribes who stretched across
the desert from the borders of Babylonia to the fields of
Syria, and were known in after days under the compre
hensive title of Nabatha?ans. At any rate, the worship of
Tammuz could not have been introduced into Palestine
by the Assyrian conquests, as has been suggested ; had it been so, the name of the god would have had a
different form. Nor again, had such been the case, could
we have explained the early prevalence of the cult of Adonis in Phoenicia and Cyprus, 1 and the traces that it
left even upon Homeric Greece. The name and story of
Tammuz must have come to Phoenicia in those remote
times when it was whispered that " Ivronos" or Ea had
Dazu, will be here identified with Ann (and Anat). What makes this the more likely is that a few lines further Alala and Tillili are also identified with Aim and Anat.
1 The name of Tamassos, the city in whose neighbourhood were the
famous copper-mines of the island, perhaps preserved a recoiled ion of the name of Tammuz. It is called Tametsi by Esar-haddon.



TAMMUZ AND ISTAR. 235
taken Ycfid, 1 his " only begotten son," and arraying him in royal robes had sacrificed him on an altar in a
season of distress. 2
Greek mythology itself knew the name of Tammuz as
well as that of Adonis. Thcias or Thoas 3 was not only
the Lemnian husband of Myrina and the king of the
Tauric Ivhersonesc who immolated strangers on the altars
of Artemis, he was also king of Assyria and father of
Adonis and his sister Myrrha or Smyrna. In the Ivyprian
myth the name of Theias is transformed into Kinyras ;
but, like Theias, he is the father of Adonis by his daughter
Myrrha. Myrrha is the invention of a popular etymo
logy ;
4 the true form of the name was Smyrna or Myrina,
a name famous in the legendary annals of Asia Minor.
Myrina or Smyrna, it was said, was an Amazonian queen, and her name is connected with the four cities of the
western coast—Smyrna, Kyme, Myrina and Ephesoswhose foundation was ascribed to Amazonian heroines.
But the Amazons were really the warrior priestesses of
the great Asiatic goddess, whom the Greeks called the
Artemis of Ephesos, and who was in origin the Istar of
Babylonia modified a little by Hittite influence. It was
she who, in the Asianic cult of Attys or Hadad, took the
place of Istar and Aphrodite ; for just as Attys himself
was Tammuz, so the goddess with whom he was asso
ciated was Istar. At Hierapolis, which succeeded to the
religious fame and beliefs of the ancient Hittite city of

Semiramis and Smyrna are but varying forms of the same
word. However this may be, in the Kyprian Kinyras
who takes the place of Theias we have a play upon the
Phoenician kinnor, or " cither," which is said to have been
used in the worship of Adonis. But its real origin seems
to be indicated by the name of Gingras which Adonis
himself bore. 2 Here it is difficult not to recognize the
old Accadian equivalent of Istar, Gingira or Gingiri, " the creatress." 3
The fact that Tammuz was the son of Ea points unmis
takably to the source both of his name and of his worship.
He must have been the primitive Sun-god of Eridu, standing in the same relation to Ea, the god of Eridu,
that Adar stood to Mul-lil, the god of Xipur. It is even
possible that the boar whose tusk proved fatal to Adonis
may originally have been Adar himself. Adar, as we
have seen, was called the "lord of the swine" in the
Accadian period, and the Semitic abhorrence of the ani
mal may have used it to symbolise the ancient rivalry
between the Sun-god of Nipur and the Sun-god of Eridu. 4
Those who would see in the Cain and Abel of Scripture
the representatives of elemental deities, and who follow
Dr. Oppert in explaining the name of Abel by the Baby
lonian ablu, "the son," slightly transformed by a popular etymology, may be inclined to make them the Adar and Tammuz of ChahUean faith.

TAMMUZ AND ISTAR. 237
As mother of Tammuz, Dav-kina, the wife of Ea, had
a special name. She is called Tsirdu, or 'Sirdu1 —a word
in which I believe we may see the Assyrian hirdu, "a
falcon.'' Now it will be remembered that 'Sirrida, also
written 'Sirdam, and pronounced 'Sirgam, Sirrigal or 'Sirriga, 'Surgfi and Nirda, 2 in the different dialects of
pro-Semitic Chaldeea, was a title of A, the wife of the
Sun-god of Sippara or Accad. As we are told that a
temple of Tammuz existed at Accad, where it was known
by the double name of " the tower of mighty bulk" and
"the shrine of observation," 3 it would seem that the
worship of Tammuz had been transported from Eridu
to the capital of Sargon at the time when the culture of
southern babylonia made its way to the north, and the
empire of Sargon was fusing the civilisation and religion of the country into a single whole. It was then that
the Sun-god of Eridu and the Sun-god of Accad would
naturally be identified together, and that the wife of
Samas of Accad should become the goddess whom mytho
logy represented as at once the wife and the mother of Tammuz.
But the primitive home of Tammuz had been in that
1 W. A. I. ii. 59, 9. As she seems to be identified with Istar in the
game passage, we may conclude that the compiler of the mythological list regarded her as equally the mother and the wife of Tammuz.
- W. A. I. ii. 57. 11, 24, 23, 21, 22, 26. In line 2G the name of A
is also written phonetically by means of the ideograph for father (a). In lines 30, 31, sir-ut-kan and sir-ut-am must each be read 'Sirdam
(or 'Sirudam). See above, p. 178.
3 W. A. I. ii. 50. 10, 1 1. It would appear from this that the pardlcu, or "shrine," was, like that of Bel-Merodach at Babylon, in the highest
chamber of the zitjtjurat, or " tower," from whence observations of the sky could be made.

''garden" of Edin, or Eden, which Babylonian tradition placed in the immediate vicinity of Eridu. 1 The frag
ment of an old bilingual hymn has been preserved,
which begins in the following way :
1. "(In) Eridu a stalk'2 grew over-shadowing; in a holy place did it become green ;
2. its root ([wjom) was of white crystal which stretched towards
the deep ;
3. (before) Ea was its course in Eridu, teeming with fertility;3 4. its seat was the (central) place 4 of the earth ;
5. its foliage (?) was the couch of Zikum (the primaeval) mother. 6. Into the heart of its holy house which spread its shade like a
forest hath no man entered.
7. (There is the home) of the mighty mother who passes across
the sky. 8. (In) the midst of it was Tammuz.
10. (There is the shrine ?) of the two (gods)."
The description reminds us of the famous Ygg-drasil
1 Hence his mother (and wife) is called " the lady of Edin" (W. A. I.
ii. 59. 10, 11.
- See K 1G5, 22 (u-qi gesdin), " the stalk of a grape." Qi ( = lamma)
tar is the Assyrian epitdtu, "a small stalk" (W. A.I. ii. 41. 52, 56).
I '-'>i is also explained as ritu sltehu, "a growing slip" (YV. A. I. ii. 41, 8).
Wu arc reminded of the old story of Jack and the Bean-stalk as well as of the Polynesian tree which enables the climber to ascend into the heavenly land. The mother of Tammuz was called "the (mistress) of the vine" (W.A.I, ii. 59, 11). Hommel {Die Semitischen Volke>; p. 406) very ingeniously reads the "Qi-tree" as gis-Mn, in Accadian rmis-kin, from which lie derives the Assyrian micduklcanu or mudsiJcannu,
"a palm." But the Semitic rendering is not ukkanu, as he reads, but MsJcanu, from the Accadian (jislcin. The palm was the sacred tree of Babylonia, and Adar was '-lord of the date."
3 The original seems to be literally, "while (before Ea) it went
( = grew), Eridu was richly fertile."
4 This appears to be the meaning of the line, the site of the tree
being regarded as, like Delphi among the Greeks, the 6/KJmkus of the earth. The Sunierian equivalent of "earth" is si-mad, which must be read ma I (W. A. L v. oti. 59) with the determinative prefix.



TAMMUZ AND ISTAR. 239
of Norse mythology, the world-tree whose roots descend
into the world of death, while its branches rise into
Asgard, the heaven of the gods. The Babylonian poet
evidently imagined his tree also to be a world-tree, whose roots stretched downwards into the abysmal deep, where
Ea presided, nourishing the earth with the springs and streams that forced their way upwards from it to the
surface of the ground. Its seat was the earth itself,
which stood midway between the deep below and Zikum,
the primordial heavens, above, who rested as it were
upon the overshadowing branches of the mighty "stem.'''
Within it, it would seem, was the holy house of Dav
kina, " the great mother," and of Tammuz her son, a temple too sacred and far hidden in the recesses of the
earth for mortal man to enter. It is perhaps a remi
niscence of this mystic temple that we find in the curious
work on " Nabatlncan Agriculture," composed in the
fourth or fifth century by a Mandaite of Chakhea, where
we are told of the temple of the sun in Babylon, in
which the images of the gods from all the countries of
the world gathered themselves together to weep for
Tammuz. 1 What the tree or "stalk" was which sprang
1 Ibn Wahshiyah, the translator of the Ndbathoean Agriculture of Kuthami into Arabic, adds that he had "lit upon another Nabathrean book, in which the legend of Tammuz was narrated in full ; how he summoned a king to worship the seven (planets) and the twelve (signs of the Zodiac), and how the king put him to death, and how he still lived after being killed, so that he had to put him to death several
times in a cruel manner, Tammuz coming to life again after each time, until at last he died ; and behold, it was identical with the legend of St. George that is current among the Christians." Abu Sayid Wahb ibn Ibrahim, in his calendar of the Ssabian festivals, says under the
month Tammuz: "On the 15th of this month is the festival of the weeping women, which is identical wr.h Ta'uz, a festival held in honour

up like the bean-stalk of our old nursery tale, is indicated
in the magical text to which the fragment about it has
been appended. 1 In this, Ea describes to Merodach the
means whereby he is to cure a man who is possessed of
the seven evil spirits. He is first to go to "the cedar
tree, the tree that shatters the power of the incubus,
upon whose core the name of Ea is recorded," and then,
with the help of "a good masal" or phylactery which
is placed on the sick man's head as he lies in bed at
night, to invoke the aid of the Fire-god to expel the
demons. It is the cedar, therefore, which played the
same part in Babylonian magic as the rowan ash of
northern Europe, and which was believed to be under
the special protection of Ea ; and the parallel, therefore, between the ash Ygg-drasil of Norse mythology and the
world-tree of the poet of Eridu becomes even closer than
before.
Long after the days when the hymns and magical texts of Eridu were composed, the mystic virtues of the
cedar were still remembered. A tablet which describes
of the god Ta'uz. The women weep over him, (telling) how his lord slew him, and ground his bones in a mill, and scattered them to the winds : and they eat nothing that has been ground in a mill, but only
soaked wheat, vetches, dates, raisins and the like" (Chwolson's Die
Ssabinr, ii. p. 27).
1 W. A. I. iv. 15. Rev. 10 — 13. It is pretty clear from the sculp
tures that tin' sacred tree of the Babylonians was the cedar, which was
subsequently displaced by the palm ; so that Hommel's view, which
sees a palm in " the stalk'' of Eridu, may still be maintained. On the
other hand, in W. A. I. ii. 59. Rev. 10, "the divine Lady of Eden" is called "the goddess of the tree of life" in the Accadian of north Babylonia, "the goddess of the vine" in the .Sumerian of south Babylonia. It is clear from this that the sacred tree was also conceived of as the
vine. According to the Old Testament, it will be remembered, there were two sacred trees in the garden of Eden.



TAMMUZ AND ISTAR. 241
the initiation of an augur, and states how he must be
" of pure lineage, unblemished in hand and foot," speaks thus of the vision which is revealed to him before he is
" initiated and instructed in the presence of Samas and
Rimmon in the use of the book and stylus" by "the
scribe, the instructed one, who keeps the oracle of the
great gods : " he is made to descend into an artificial
imitation of the lower world, and there beholds "the
altars amid the waters, the treasures of Anu, Bel and
Ea, the tablets of the gods, the delivering of the oracle
of heaven and earth, and the cedar-tree, the beloved of
the great gods, which their hand has caused to grow." 1
It was possibly the fragrance of the wood when lighted
for sacrificial purposes that gave the tree its sacred
character.
But the cedar was something more than a world-tree.
It was employed, as we have seen, in incantations and
magic rites which were intended to restore strength and
life to the human frame. It was thus essentially "a tree
of life," and the prototype and original of those conven
tional trees of life with which the walls of the Assyrian
palaces were adorned. Those who have visited the
Assyrian collection of the British Museum will remember
the curious form which it generally assumes, as well as
the figures of the two cherubs which kneel or stand before
it on either side. At times they are purely human ; at
other times they have the head of a hawk and hold a
cone—the fruit of the cedar—over the tree by whose
side they stand.
It is possible that, as time went on, another tree became

242 LECTURE IV.
confounded with the original tree of life. The palm was
from the earliest period characteristic of Babylonia ; and
while its fruit seemed to be the stay and support of life,
the wine made from it made " glad the heart of man."
Date -wine was largely used, not only in Babylonian
medicine, but in the religious and magical ceremonies of
Babylonia as well. It is not at all improbable, therefore,
that the later Babylonian tree of life, with its strange
conventional form, was an amalgamation of two actual
trees, the cedar and the palm. It is even possible that
whiie one of them, the cedar, was primarily the sacred
tree of Eridu, the other was originally the sacred tree of
some other locality of Chaldsea.
What gives some colour to this last suggestion is. that
in later Babylonian belief the tree of life and the tree of
knowledge were one and the same. The text which
describes the initiation of a soothsayer associates the
cedar with " the treasures of Ami, Bel and Ea, the tablets
of the gods, the delivering of the oracle of heaven and
earth." It was upon the heart or core of the cedar, too,
that the name of* Ea, the god of wisdom, was inscribed.
And it was wisdom rather than life, the knowledge of
the secrets of heaven and the magical arts that benefit or
injure, which the priesthood of Babylonia and the gods
they worshipped kept jealously guarded. Only the- initiated were allowed to taste of its fruit. In this respect,
consequently, there was a marked difference between the
belief of the Babylonians and the account which we find
in the earlier chapters of Genesis.
AVe can trace the first steps by which the name and
worship of Tammuz made their way from Eridu north
wards. In the same part of Babylonia, a few miles only



TAMMUZ AND ISTAR. 243
to the north, lie the mounds of Tel-loh, which have
yielded to French entcrprize the earliest monuments of
Chaldsean art we as yet possess. We learn from them
that the god of Tel-loh was Nin-girsu. It was in honour
of Nin-girsu that the kings who reigned at 'Sirgulla built and adorned their chief temples ; and in the inscrip
tion of Sukal-duggina(?) he is brought into association
with the god of Nipur and entitled " the valiant warrior
of Mul-lil." Nin-girsu was, in fact, " the lord of Girsu,"
the native name, probably, of Tel-loh. When the cult
of Mul-lil found its way to Girsu, the god of Girsu
necessarily entered into relation with him ; and as " the
lord of Girsu" seems to have been a Sun-god, he took the
place of Adar and became "the valiant warrior of Mul
lil." It was on this account that the mythologists sub
sequently identified Adar and Nin-girsu.1 In Accad, however, an earlier identification had been discovered, in
whose justification, it is probable, more might have been said. After the establishment of the worship of Tammuz
in Sippara, and the introduction of the divinities of
southern Babylonia into the north, Tammuz came to be
addressed there as Mul-Mersi or En-Mersi, the Accadian
or North-Chaldeean form of Nin-girsu. In forgetfulness
of the real origin of the name, the Semitic scribes of
Sargon and his successors seem to have interpreted the
title as if it meant " lord of the horned crown," the head
dress worn by the Babylonian kings. A broken text,
which was probably the compilation of a bilingual Semite,
breaks out into these words: 2 "0 Merodach, go, my

son, take the hand of the white offspring of Mul-Mersi
(Tammnz) ; lull the plague of the sick man to rest ;
change his heart ; assist the man ;
1 grant the spell of Ea ; the offspring of his heart whom thou hast taken
away and the strong food of the man restore (to him)."
"The white offspring of Mul-Mersi" is perhaps an
equivalent of a common phrase in these old texts : " the
man the son of his god." It represents that close
relationship which was supposed to exist between the
Babylonian and the god he worshipped, and which the
Egyptian symbolised by the assumption of an identity between himself and the divine being. But whereas the
pantheistic Egyptian believed in his absorption into the
divinity, the pious Babylonian, who regarded his gods as creators and generators, called himself their son.
The worship of the Sun-god of Eridu had embodied
other elements before it reached northern Babylonia,
besides those which resulted in the identification of
Tammuz and Nin-Grirsii. It was probably as Nin-Girsu
that he became the patron and lord of the green marsh
plants which flourished in the neighbourhood of Tel-loh ;
it was as Nin-girxu that he was adored as the son of Ea
the river-god, rather than of Ea the god of the deep ;
and it was from the story of his untimely death that he
came to be the tergal of southern Chaldsea, the Sun-god
of winter and night who rules, like Rhadamanthos, in the
bored bilingual fragment belonging to the series K(Obr. 6) : bitsa mirSi. Fur Mul-ini'isi, see W.A.I. ii. 59, 8. Girsu seems to mean the '•'bank"

lower world. But he was more than this. The Chal
da?ans were a people of agriculturists and herdsmen;
their monarchs were addressed as " shepherds ;" and just
as Abel in the Old Testament is " a keeper of sheep,"
so, too, Tammuz in Babylonia was accounted a shepherd. This is how an old Accadian hymn speaks of him ( W. A. I.
iv. 27, Xo. 1) :
" Tammuz, shepherd and lord, bridegroom of Istar the lady of
heaven, lord of Hades, lord of the shepherds' cot, 1 the green corn'2 which in the meadow 3 has not drunk the water,
its progemy in the desert is not green of leaf;
the acacia (?) tree which in the canal is planted not,4
the acacia (?) tree whose foundation is taken away ; the grain 5 which in the meadow has not drunk the water."
The poem is written in the artificial dialect which
sprang* up in the court of Sargon, and it probably emanated from the city of Accad. 6 It may have been one
of the dirges chanted in commemoration of the death of
Tammuz, the shepherd who was cut oil like the unwa
tered corn, or the tree from beneath whose roots the
soft soil of the canal slips away.
The story of Tammuz of Eridu did not stand alone.
There were other cities of Babylonia which knew of a
hapless Sun-god cut off in the prime of his life, or pcrish

ing through love of a heartless goddess. But in these
legends, it would appear, the goddess herself was the
cause of the hero's death ; so far from venturing into
the glooms of Hades for the sake of her youthful bride
groom, it was she who had herself lured her lover to
his destruction. This was the light in which Istar was
represented at Erech, and this was the interpretation put there upon the name of the Accadian month of the
Errand of Istar. The fate of the suitors of Istar is
glanced at in the sixth book of the Epic of Gisdhubar.
1. " For the favour of Gisdhubar the princess Istar lifted the eyes :
2. ' (Look up), Gisdhubar, and he thou my bridegroom ! 3. I am thy vine, 1 thou art its bond ; 4. be thou my husband and I will be thy wife.
5. I will give thee a chariot of crystal and gold,

7. that thou mayst yoke (thereto) each day the mighty coursers. 8. Enter our house in the gloom of the cedar. 9. When thou enterest our house

15. let thy (horse) in the chariot be strong in galloping; IG. let (thine ox) in the yoke have no rival.'
17. (Gisdhubar) opened his mouth and speaks, 18. (he says thus) to the princess Istar:
19. '(I will leave) to thyself thy possession,
20. (in thy realm are) corpses and corruption (?), 21 disease and famine.

45. he remained in the forest ; he begyed for his wings.
46. Thou didst love, too, a lion perfect in might ; 47. seven by seven didst thou tear out his teeth, seven by seven.
48. And thou didst love a horse glorious in battle ; 49. he submitted himself; with spur and whip didst thou cling to him ;
50. seven leagues didst thou cling to him galloping ;
51. in his trouble and thirst didst thou cling to him :
52. to his mother the goddess 'Silili with tears didst thou approach.
53. Thou didst love also the shepherd Tabulu,
51. who continually poured out for thee the smoke (of sacrifice). 55. Every day was he slaughtering for thee the victims ;
56. thou didst bring him forth and into a hyena didst change him ;
57. his own sheep-cote drove him away
58. and his own dogs tore his wounds.
59. Moreover, thou didst love Isullanu 1 the gardener of thy father,
60. who was ever raising for thee costly trees.
61. Every day had he made bright thy dish. 62. Thou didst take from him (his) eye and didst mock him:
63. '0 my Isullanu, conic, let us eat thine abundant store,
64. and bring out thy hand and dismiss all fear of us.'
65. Isullanu says to thee :
66. £ As for me, what dost thou ask of me 1
67. O my mother, thou cookest not (and) I eat no* :
1 In W. A. I. iii. 68, 23, Isullanu is called by his Accadian name of
Ri-si-sig or Si-simsim, " he who makes green the living things."

68. the food I have eaten are garlands and girdles ;
69. the prison of the hurricane is (thy) hidden recess.'
70. Thou didst listen and (didst impose) punishment ; 71. thou didst strike him ; to bondage thou didst (assign him) ; 72. and thou madest him sit in the midst of (a tomb I).
73. I will not ascend the height ; I will not descend to the (depth)
74. and yet thou lovest me that thou (niayest make) me as they are.'
75. When Istar (heard) this, 76. Istar was enraged and (mounted up) to heaven. 77. Moreover Istar went before Ann (her father), 78. before Anu she went and she (says) : 79. ' O my father, Gisdhubar has kept watch on me ; 80. Gisdhubar has counted my garlands,
81. my garlands and my girdles.'"
Like Potiphar's wife, Istar thus accuses Gisdhubar of
doing the exact contrary of what he really had done.
The portion of the tablet which contained the conver
sation between her and Anu is broken, but enough
remains to show that she eventually persuaded him to
punish the hero. Anu accordingly created a divine bull
of monstrous size; but without much result, as Gisdhubar
and his friend Ea-bani succeeded in destroying the animal
and dragging its body in triumph through the streets of Erech. With Gisdhubar and the divine bull of Anu,
however, we are not at present interested. What con
cerns us just now is the list given by Gisdhubar of
the unhappy victims of Istar's coquetry. Of the first,
Tammuz, there is but little said. Even Sin-liqi-unnini,
the author of the Epic of Gisdhubar, conld find but little
in the story of Tammuz which could throw discredit on
the goddess. The next mentioned is Alala, " the eagle."
Xow the eagle is stated to be "the symbol (tsalam) of
the noon-tide sun;" and that Alala, whose name is of
Accadian origin signifying " the great Spirit," has solar
connections, is indicated not only by the fact that his



TAMMUZ AND ISTAR. 249
consort Tillili is the sister of Tammuz in the legend of the
Descent of Istar, hut also from the compound title Aldla
alum, "Ahila of the image." 1 In one of the local cos
mogonies of Chalda?a, however, he and his consort took
the place of Assoros and Kissare, the primordial heavens
and earth. Like them, he was resolved into Ann by the
monotheistic school ;
2 and a text associates both him and
Tillili with the cosmogonic deities Lnkhma and Lakhama,
"the gods who are immanent in the heaven and in the
earth." 3 Who the lion and the horse were we do not
yet know; we hear of "a god of lions" (W.A.I, iii. 66,
34), and one of the Assyrian names of the month Sebat was
"the month of 'Silili" (K 104, Rev,). In the shepherd
Tabulu, however, we have the double of the shepherd Tammuz himself. The name reminds us of Abel and
Tubal-Ivain, more especially when we remember that it
is but a tiphel formation— so common in Assyrian—from
the simpler abalii. His fate recalls that of the hunter
Aktason, torn by his own dogs through the anger of

(an) alam; comp. 11. 18, 20, 26. 3 D.T. 122, 17—20. Laban (?)- same, "the brick foundation of heaven" is also mentioned in the same text. Xabonidos, when de
scribing the rebuilding of the temple of the Moon-god at Harran, says that he set about it "by the commission (not "work," as Latiille) of the god Laban (?), the lord of foundations and brick-work" (libndtiy
W. A. I. v. 64-. i. 53), and that on either side of the eastern gate of
the building he placed "two Lukhmu gods who sweep away my foes."
Laban is mentioned (W. A. I. iii. 66, 6) among the gods whose images
stood in the temple of Anu at Assur, and it is probable that he was of
foreign importation. According to Genesis, Harran was the home of Laban. The name would mean "the white one." "The god of the Foundation" (&r) is mentioned in 79. 7-8. 6S. This was the horizon of heaven as opposed to the zenith or Nebo.



250 LECTURE IV.
Artemis, the Asianic representative of the Babylonian
Istar. Isullanu, the gardener of Ami, is probably the
mythic prototype of the historical Sargon of Accad, whom
later legend turned into a gardener beloved by the
goddess Istar. As it was upon the famous king of Accad
that the old myth was fastened, it is possible that Isullanu
had been the representative of Tammuz at Accad before
the cult of the god of Eridu had been introduced there
from the south.
But who, all this while, was the goddess, whom one
legend made the faithful wife enduring even death for
her husband's sake, while another regarded her as the
most faithless and cruel of coquettes? I have already
spoken of her as the goddess of love, and such, indeed,
she was to the Babylonian or Assyrian of later days. In the story of her descent into Hades, her residence in the
lower world is marked by all cessation of intercourse
between male and female in the animal creation, as well
as among the gods of heaven. It was this feature of the
story which caused it to find its way into the literature
of another people, and to survive the days when the clay
tnblets of Assyria and Babylon could still be read. We
find it serving to point a moral in the pages of the
Talmud. We are there told how a pious rabbi once
prayed that the demon of lust should be bound, and how
his petition was granted. But society quickly fell into
i state of anarchy. Ko children were born; no eggs
even could be procured for food ; and the rabbi was at
length fain to confess that his prayer had been a mistaken
one, and to ask that the demon should again be free.
But though a moral signification thus came to be read
into the old Babylonian myth, it wa< a signification that



TAMMUZ AND ISTAR. 251
was originally entirely foreign to it Prof. Tiele has clearly shown that the legend of Istar's descent into
Hades is but a thinly-veiled description of the earthgoddess seeking below for the hidden waters of life,
which shall cause the Sun-god and all nature with him
to rise again from their sleep of death. 1 The spirits of
earth, the gnomes that guard its treasures below, watch
over the waters, and not until they are led forth and
placed on their golden throne can their precious treasure
be secured. It is the earth who loses her adornments,
one by one, as she passes slowly downward into the
palace-prison of the infernal goddess, and it is the earth
who is once more gladdened at spring-time with the
returning love of the youthful Sun-god.
Istar, then, must primitively have been the goddess of the earth, and the bride of Tammuz at Eridu must
accordingly have been his mother Dav-kina. This alone
will explain the persistent element in the myth as it
made its way to the Greeks, according to which the
mother of Tammuz was also his sister. Istar, Tillili,
Dav-kina, were all but different names and forms of the
same divinity. We have just seen that Tillili, at all
events, was the primordial earth.
What Istar was primitively, however, will not explain what she became in those later ages of Babylonian history
to which our monuments belong. Hei origin faded more
and more into the background ; new elements entered
into her character ; and she absorbed the attributes and
functions of numberless local divinities. The Istar of
Assur-bani-pal or jNabonidos was the inheritress of cults

and beliefs which had grown up in different localities
and had gathered round the persons of other deities.
The Istar of the historical period is essentially Semitic.
But let me not be misunderstood. What is Semitic in
her nature is an after-growth, which cannot be explained
unless we assume that it has grown out of non-Semitic
elements. The Semitic superstructure presupposes a non-Semitic basis. It is only thus that we can explain
both the name of Istar and the striking difference that
exists in regard to her character between the Semites of
Babylonia and those of the west. It is only where the
Semite had come into contact with the Accadian that we
find the name and worship of Istar at all. We look in
vain for it among the Arabs of central Arabia, among
the descendants of those who parted from their Semitic
brethren of the north before they were affected by the
culture of primaeval Babylonia. We find the name of
Aththor, it is true, on the southern coast of Arabia ; but
we find there also the name of the Babylonian Moon-god
Sin, and other traces of the influence which Babylonian
trade could not fail to exert in comparatively late days.
Inland, Istar remained unknown.
All attempts to discover a Semitic etymology for the
name have been unavailing. And there is a good reason
why they should be so. The name itself bears evidence
to its non-Semitic origin. We find it in its earliest form
in Babylonia ; and here, though it denotes the name of a
female goddess, it is unprovided with that grammatical
sign of the feminine— the dental suffix —which marks
the names of other genuinely Semitic goddesses. Belit,
Zarpanit, Anat, Tasmit, all show by their termination
their source and meaning ; and Istar, without that termi



TAMMUZ AND ISTAR. 253
nation, in spite of its meaning, shows equally plainly what its source must bo. As the name travelled further
to the west, away from its old associations with Chaldaea,
the grammatical instincts of the Semites could no longer
be held in check, and Istar was transformed into the
Ashtoreth of the Old Testament and the Phoenician
monuments, the Astarte of the Greeks. Even in Baby
lonia and Assyria, when Istar became the representative
of all other female divinities, and the name passed into
a common term signifying "a goddess," the Semitic
feminine suffix was attached to it. But the suffix was
attached to it only when it was thus used, no longer as
a proper name, but as one of the words of the Semitic
dictionary ; whenever it still retained its ancient sense
and denoted a specific deity, it retained also its ancient
genderless appearance. As a foreign name, it continued
to the last a stranger in the province of Semitic grammar.
We can thus understand why it was that the Semites
sometimes changed the old Chaldsean goddess into a
male divinity. On the Moabite Stone, Mesha declares
that he dedicated Nebo of Israel to Istar-Kemosh, "to
Istar who is the god Kemosh;" and an astronomical
tablet 1 informs us that Dilbat, the planet Venus, which,
as we shall see, was the primitive Istar, is " a female at
sunset and a male at sunrise," the word employed for
male being a curiously artificial coinage, such as " maless"
would be in English. In fact, the tablet goes on to add
that Venus Avas not only a male by reason of her identifica
tion with the morning star, she was also the rising Sun-god
himself, and thus " a male and the offspring (of a male);"
1 W. A. I, iii. 53. 30—39.



254 LECTURE IV.
while at sunset she was the god Adar, and thus "an
androgyne and the offspring (of an androgyne)." After
this, we are told that " Venus at sunrise is Istar of Accad
by name," while at sunset she is "Istar of Erech by
name;" at sunrise she is "Istar of the stars," at sunset
Mat ///, "the mistress of the gods." The doubt as to
whether Istar were male or female was the same as that
which Avas felt by the Semites in regard to other Acca
dian deities. 1 Where there was no grammatical indica
tion, where the same word might mean "master" or
"mistress" according to the context, the zealous but
half-educated Semitic neophyte might well be forgiven
the mistakes he sometimes made in his adoption and
adaptation of the older divinities. It was thus that the
ambiguity of the Accadian mn, which signified at once
"lord" and "lady," led him at times to transform the
god Adar into a goddess ; and I have already pointed out in an earlier Lecture how in like manner the god
A became the wife of the Sun. But that a similar doubt
should hang over the sex of Istar proves more plainly
than anything else the non-Semitic origin of her name
and character.'2
"Whon, however, we come to look closely into this
character, we shall find here also clear traces of a non
1 In W. A. I. ii. 35, 18, we arc told that the god Tiskhu was " Istar
of Erech ;" and yet in ii. 57, 35, Tiskhn appears as the equivalent of Adar as "god of libations." But it must be remembered that the Semites were doubtful about the sex of Adar. On the other hand, Iskhara, another name of Istar (ii. 49, 14 ; K4195, 7), is said to be a
male deity whose wife was Almanu or (Al)manati (Strassmaier, 3901).
": That the Phoenicians also knew of a male Istar is perhaps indicated by the Greek myth which made Europa the wife of Asterios, the king ol Phoenician Krete.



TAMMUZ AND ISTAR. 25.5
Semitic descent. In the nrst place, Istar is distinguished
from the other goddesses of the Semitic world by her
independent nature. She is not the mere reflexion of
the male divinity, like Anat or Beltis or Zarpanit ; in so for
as she is Istar, she is placed on an equal footing with the
male deities of the pantheon. In this respect she stands
in marked contrast to the goddesses of the pure Semitic
faith, and to the purely Semitic conception of the divine
government of the world. She holds equal rank with
the Sun-god Baal ; Babylonian mythology, in fact, makes
her his sister, and treats her as if she were a god. We
may even say that she takes rank before him, at all
events in early times, in conformity with the old Accadian
custom of setting the woman before the man, but in fla
grant violation of the contrary practice of the Semitic race.
So far, indeed, from being the double and shadow of the
-god, Istar is rather the divinity who gives life and sub
stance to her divine lovers. Tammnz himself is but
"the bridegroom" of Istar; it was only for the sake of
Istar that his name was held in honour. Istar, in short,
is an anomaly in the Semitic pantheon ; she is there as a
goddess who masquerades in the garb of a god. Away from Accadian influences, in the Phoenician
lands of the west, the character, like the name, of the
goddess was more closely accommodated to Semitic ideas.
Istar had become Ashtoreth, and Ashtoreth had put on
the colourless character of the Semitic goddess. Hence
it was that, just as Baal became the common designation
of the male deity, Ashtoreth was the common designa
tion of the female. By the side of the Baalim stood the
Ashtaroth—those goddesses whose sole right to exist was
She necessity of providing the male divinity with a con



25(5 LECTURE IV.
sort. Asherah, the southern Canaanitish goddess of fer
tility, alone retained some of the independence of the
Babylonian Istar. In the second place, there is a very important differ
ence between the Istar of Babylonia and the Ashtoreth
of Phoenicia. Ashtoreth was the goddess of the moon ;
Istar was not. It was in the west alone that Astarte was
" Queen of heaven with crescent horns ;
To whose bright image nightly by the moon Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs."
It was in the west alone that the shrine was erected to
Ashtoreth Karnaim, 1 "Ashtoreth of the double horn;"
and Greek legend described the wandering Astarte, under
the name of Europa, crossing the celestial sea on the bull
that Ann had created for her so long before to punish
the disdainful Gisdhubar. In Babylonia and Assyria,,
however, Istar and the moon were separate one from
another. The moon was conceived of as a god, not as a
goddess, in conformity witli pre-Semitic ideas ; and the .A loon-god Sin was never confounded with the goddess
Istar. It must have been the same wherever the worship
of Sin extended, whether in Harran in the north or in
Yemen and the Sinaitic desert in the south. But the
worship never made its way to Canaan. Sin failed to>
establish himself there, and the moon accordingly re
mained the pale mirror and double of the mightier Baal.
The Semites of Phoenicia were too distant from the cul
tured kingdoms of the Euphrates to allow their religious instincts to be overridden and transformed. The name
and cult of Istar were indeed introduced among themy
1 Gen xiv. 5, where the wor i is wrongly punctuated u Ashteroth,"



TAMMUZ AND ISTAR. 257
but a new interpretation was given to both. Istar sank
to the level and took the place of the older goddesses of
the Canaanitish faith.
Perhaps you will ask me what is the meaning of the
name of Istar? This, however, is a question which I
cannot answer. The Babylonians of the historical age
do not seem to have known what was its origin, and it is
therefore quite useless for us to speculate on the subject.
Its true etymology was buried in the night of antiquity.
But its earliest application appears to have been to the
evening star. This is the oldest signification that we can
assign to the word, which by the way, it may be noticed, does not occur in any of the Accadian texts that we
possess.
1
The legend of the assault of the seven wicked spirits
.upon the moon tells us pretty clearly who the goddess
Istar was primarily supposed to be. Mul-lil, it is said, " had appointed Sin, Samas and Istar, to rule the vault of
heaven," and, "along with Ann, had given them to share the lordship of the hosts of heaven. To the three of
them, those gods his children, he had entrusted the night
and the day ; that they cease not their work he urged
them. Then those seven, the wicked gods, darted upon
the vault of heaven ; before Sin, the god of light, they
came in fierce attack ; Samas the hero and Simmon the
1 From which we may infer that the name originated in one of the smaller eities of the country. It is possibly a side-form of Iskhara,
Is-tar and Isdihara being alike compounds of is. The suffix -ra or -r
is common in Proto-Chaldsean, and the Semitic spelling of the first syl
lable (with 'am), like that of the first syllable of Ann, points to its having originally been as. Istar appears as Esther in the book of Esther, where Mordechai, it may be noted, is a derivative from Merodach.
S



2-^8 LECTURE IV.
warrior turned and fled ; Istar set up a glittering throne
by the side of Ami the king, and plotted for the sovereignty of heaven." 1 Thus once more the mythologist gives the
goddess an unfavourable character, though it is easy to see what the story means. When the moon is eclipsed,
the evening star has no longer any rival in the sky ; it
shines with increased brilliancy, and seems to meditate
ruling the night alone, in company only with the heaven
itself.
Already, before the days of Sargon of Accad and the
compilation of the great Babylonian work on astronomy, it had been discovered that the evening and morning
stars were one and the same. Not only, therefore, was
Istar the evening star, the companion of the moon ; she
became also the morning star, the companion and herald
of the sun. It was thus that she assumed the attributes
and titles of a male deity, since Bun-khud-e, " the hero
who issues forth at daybreak," was both a god and the
morning star. As the morning star, therefore, Istar was a god and the successor of a god, so that it is not won
derful if the bewildered Semite, who found no visible
sign of gender in the name of the divinity he had adopted, should sometimes have regarded Istar as the masculine
form of Ashtoreth. Some of the early Accadian titles
of Istar belone to her as the star of the morning, though
the title of "Lady of Rising," 2 given her as "the wife
1 W.A.I iv. :». 60—79.

of Ann" (W. A.T. ii. 51. 15), would apply equally to the
evening star. In making her the wife of the Sky-god, the mytho
logies were only expressing in another way what the
poet of the legend of the seven evil spirits had denoted
by saying that Istar set up her throne by the side of
Ann. More usually, however, the relation between Istar
and Ann was regarded as a genetic one ; she was the
daughter, rather than the wife, of the Sky. 1 At times,
again, she is called the daughter of the Moon-god, the
Moon-god being here the larger body which begets the smaller star. It is possible that these different views
about her descent are derived from different centres of
worship ; that which made her the daughter of Sin
having its origin in Ur, while that which made her the
daughter of Ann emanated from Erech. At any rate,
her connection with the Moon-god seems to have been
the more popular view in Semitic times.
As a planet, Istar's ordinary name was the Accadian
Dilbat, or "Announcer." One of the smaller cities of
Babylonia had the same name, and was probably the chief
seat of the worship of the goddess under this particular form. It is obvious that the name must have been
originally applied not to the evening but to the morning star. It was only as the announcer of day and the
herald of the sun that Venus could be the Accadian
representative of the Semitic Xebo. The other mes

sengers of the gods were male ; and in Semitic times
the fact that there had once been a female messenger
was forgotten. The name of Dilbat, it is true, remained, but only as the name of a star ; the place of Istar as the
herald of the Sun-god was taken, at Babylon at all events,
by Xebo.
It is possible that the records of the city of Dilbat. if
ever they are recovered, will show us that this was the
primal home of the name of Istar itself, and the centre
from which it first spread. If so, however, it was little
more than the primal home of the goddess's name. The
real source and centre of the worship of Istar at the dawn
of the historical period, the starting-point from which
it was handed on to the Semites and became overlaid
with Semitic beliefs and practices, was not Dilbat, but
Erech. In the davs when Erech had been a leading
state, when the cult of the Sky-god had been carried by
its people to other parts of the Eastern world, the cult
of Istar also had been carried with it. Wherever the
worship of Anu had gone, the worship of Istar, the daughter of Anu, went too. But the Istar of Erech was
originally known by a different name. She was ]NYina,
"the lady," a title which does not appear to have been
replaced by the name of Istar until after the beginning of
the Semitic period. At all events the common title of
the goddess in the Accadian texts is Ncina ; the word
Istar is never found in them. As Nana, 1 " the lady," she
continued to be known at Erech down to the most recent
times. It was the famous image of Xana that the Elamite

before the generals of Assur-bani-pal recovered it in tlie
s;k k of Shushan. and late texts draw a distinction between
N a ua and Istar. Thus in a tablet of exorcisms, the patient
is told to address ; '
Istar, Nana and Kasba," 1 and an
augural tablet is careful to distinguish between Xana and
"Istar the queen" (inflkalu).*
It was, in fact, easy to identify a goddess who bore so general a name as that of "the lady" with any other
female divinity. At 13orsippa, for instance, Xana was made one with an otherwise unknown deity 'Sutitil (?),
" the goddess who quickens the body." A text copied for
Assur-bani-pal from a tablet originally written at Babylon,
contains part of a hymn which had to be recited " in the
presence of l>cl-Aferod;ich when he had seated himself
(ittasbu) in the house of sacrifice {alciium) in the beginning of Xisan." The latter portion reads as follows :
"(0 Bclj why) dost thou not take thy scat in Babylon? In E-Sag
gil is set thy dwelling-place.
' His is the . . . .' they have not said to
thee, and Zarpanit has not cued to thee. Bel, why dost thou not

'

dwelling-place. '0 Zauiania,3 why dost thou not take thy seat?'
1 K3I64, 18. 2 K 220, Obv. 4, 13. The divine names in this tablet follow in this
order : Istar of Babylon, Xana, Kani-suna, the god of Kibib, Xebo, Tasmetu, Cula, 'Sakin of E-Ana, Samas, Sala, Istar the queen, Xergal {Ugur), Kinnnon, Zamama, Mul-lil. 3 Zamama (in Sumerian Zagaga) was the Sun-god of Kis (W. A. I. ii. 60, 7 ; 61, 52), and was consequently identified with Adar by the
mycologists (W. A. I. ii. 57, 70). On a contract-stone he is symbol
ized by an eagle, which is said to be " the image of the southern sun

It "will be noticed that in this hymn, while Nana has
ceased to be the special goddess of Erech and has become
the goddess of Borsippa, she is ranked -with Balm of Kis
and Laz and Mamit —that terrible "Ban" which even
the gods must obey—who presided over Cutha. Laz
disappeared almost entirely from the pantheon of later
Babylonia, and was remembered only by antiquarians, except perhaps in Cutha itself; 2 but the name of Balm
remained better known. Balm probably was the Gurra
of Eridu, the great mother "deep" which was the home
of the seven evil spirits,"' and represented the waters of
the abyss in their original chaotic state before they were
reduced to order by the creator Ea. 4 She seems to have
been the Bohu of Genesis, the Baau of the Phoenician
of Kis." V\~e gather also from W. A. I. ii. 57, 53, that he was symbol
ised (like Alala) by the eagle. 1 Unnumbered; a lew lines are quoted by Strassmaier, GO 19. 2 Yet in 2 Kings xvii. 30, "the men of Cuth" are said to have
" made Nergal" only, from which we may infer that the ordinary population even of Cutha had forgotten the special name of their ancient
goddess. a W.A.I, iv. 15,5.
4 Zikum and Zigarum or Zikiira are the names of Gurra when regarded as the whole body of chaos out of which the heaven and the earth Avere formed (\Y. A. I. ii. 48. 2G, 27). Zigarum or Zikiira stands
for Zi-Giira, "the spirit of Glira." Cp. Gen. i. 2. If the king of Telloh whose name reads Ur-Bahu is to be identified with the well
known Chaldsean monarch TTr-Bagas or Ur-Zikum, the identity of Balm
md Zikum would be certain. Bahu is of Semitic origin, but was borrowed by the Accadians at an early period.



TAMMUZ AND 1STAR. 26o
Sanehuniathon, whose Greek interpreter identifies her with the night and makes her the mother of the first
mortal men. The Semitic Bohu, however, was no deity,
much less a goddess; the word signified merely "emptiness,"' and was thus a quite unsuitable rendering of the
old Accadian Gurra, " the watery deep." There is little
reason for wonder, therefore, that the recollection of
what Balm had primitively been should have faded out
of the memories of the Semitic Babylonians. As the
gods of the Accadians had become Baalim, so Balm, like
the other goddesses of primaeval ChaldaBa, was swept into the common vortex of Ashtaroth. She became
the wife of the Sun-god of Kis (W. A. I. iii. 68, Go), and,
when he was identified with the Sun-god of Jaipur, of
Adar also (K133, 21). She thus passed into Gula, "the
great goddess," who, though carefully distinguished from both Bahu and Nana in the earlier texts, ended in the
Semitic period by becoming confounded with both. She
was originally the local goddess of Nisin, 1 and had the
titles of "lady of the evening," "lady of the house of
death," "lady of life and death." In one of the prayers
prescribed for recitation in the temple of Merodach at
Babylon, she is invoked as " the mother who has begotten
the black-headed race (of Accadians)." She thus takes
the place that is occupied by Istar in the story of the
Deluge, who is there made to declare that " I have
begotten my people," and is called Rubat, the Assyrian
equivalent of the Accadian Gula. In fact, it is pretty
clear from the local titles of Gula that she must once
have been the evening star ; and we can therefore under
1 W. A. I. ii. 67, 31.



2G4 LECTURE IV.
stand why it is that on the one hand she is termed "the
wife of the southern sun," l and on the other hand is made
the consort of Adar by the mythologists. She forms the
common meeting -point of the various local deities of
Chalda3a who were connected with the Sun-god ; Balm,
A, Sala, all alike are Gula, " the great one ;" and Gula is
but the Accadian original of Rubat, the Semitic Istar.
In this way we may explain the statement that Gula is
" the heaven" (W. A. I. v. 31, 58), the sky of the evening
which was ruled by the evening star.
But it is also quite possible that, as Hommel thinks, one of the elements which went to make up the character
of the later Istar was a goddess of the sky who corre
sponded to the Sky-god of Erech. If so, this might well
have been Gula, whose assimilation to Istar would have
been assisted by the close relation existing between Anu
and Nana. However that may be, the Istar of the
Semitic period inherited the attributes of Dav-kina, the
goddess of the earth. The bride of Tarn muz of Eridu
was not the Istar of Erech, not the Istar of the evening
star, but a goddess of the earth. At Eridu, the goddess of the earth was Dav-kina, his own mother, and we can
thus trace to its primitive home those forms of the myth
of Adonis which made his mother his sister as well. In
Cyprus, the Phoenicians called him Gingras, and declared
that Kinyras was his father's name. Kinyras, however,
is but a popular perversion of Gingras, slightly changed
in pronunciation so as to remind the speaker of t\io
Phoenician kintior, "the zither," just as Kcnkhreis, the
wife of Kinyras, is again but Gingras in an Hellenised
1 W. A. I. i. 70. 4, 5.



TAMMUZ AND I STAR. 265
form. Now the title of Ginsn'as seems to bear the marks
of its origin upon its face. It is the old Accadian
Gingiri, or Gingira, which we are told was the Accadian
name of Istar. 1 Gin-iri, however, meant nothing more
specific than "goddess." It was the feminine equivalent
of the masculine dingir, and, like dingir, signified "creator."
The "great" goddess of southern Babylonia was thus
the creator of the world just as much as the god who
stood by her side.
The identification of Istar and Gingira simplified the
process whereby the worship of the goddess spread through
Babylonia. Each city had its own Gingira, or "creatress ;"
each city, therefore, gave a welcome to its own Istar.
When the empire of Sargon had transported the deities of southern Chaldsea to Accad, Istar naturally accom
panied her bridegroom Tammuz. Whether the Semitic
colouring which the worship of Istar received was given
to it now for the first time at Accad, or whether it had
already been received at Erech, we have no means of
determining. The fact remains that from henceforth
Istar became a Semitic goddess ; her cult was almost
1 W. A. I. ii. 48, 29. The ideographs of which it is a gloss read
Sar-sar, a name of Ea, according to ii. 55, 54. Perhaps therefore we should look to Eridu as the source of the name, where Ea and Dav
kina would he grouped together as " the gods Sar-sar," corresponding to the An-sar and Ki-sar of another system of cosmogony. However, the words explained in the portion of the text which gives the gloss Gingira seem to belong to a document that emanated from the court of Sargon of Accad ; see 11. 40, 47, and the astronomical notices. In the
early Accadian inscriptions Gingira has the more correct form Gingiri (written GiXGi-r/). The mode of writing the name proved very convenient for the Semites, who regarded it as expressing their Ista-ri (instead of Istar or Istaru), as well as for the people of Van in after times, who employed it to denote the name of their own goddess 'Sari
(instead of 'Saris). See also above, p. 143.



266 LECTURE IV.
purely Semitic in character, and the two groat centres of
her worship were the Semitic cities of Erech and Accad.
Her worship was a reflexion of that worship of nature
which underlay the Semitic conception of Baalism. The
tierce passions excited by an Eastern sun found their
expression in it. Prostitution became a religious duty,
whose wages were consecrated to the goddess of love.
She was served by eunuchs and by trains of men and
boys who dressed like women and gave themselves up to
women's pursuits. Istar, in fact, had ceased to be the
"pure" goddess of the evening star. The other elements
in her hvbrid character had come to the front, aided bv
the Semitic conception of the female side of the divinity.
She was now the fruitful goddess of the earth, teeming
with fertility, the feminine development of the life-giving
Sun-god, the patroness of love. The worshipper who would serve her truly had to share with her her pains
and pleasures. Only thus could he live the divine life,
and be, as it were, united with the deity. It was on this
account that the women wept with Istar each year over
the fatal wound of Tammuz ; it was on this account that
her temples were filled with the victims of sexual passion
and religious frenzy, and that her festivals were scenes
of consecrated orgies. As the worship of the goddess
spread westward, the revolting features connected with
it spread at the same time. The prophets of Israel
denounce the abominations committed in honour of Ash
toreth and Baal within the sacred walls of Jerusalem
itself; the Greek writers stand aghast at the violations
of social decency enjoined as religious duties on the
adorers of the oriental Aphrodite ; and Lucian himself

if Lucian indeed be the author of the treatise — is

shocked at the self-mutilation practised before the altar
of the Syrian goddess of Hierapolis. From Syria, the
cult, with all its rites, made its way, like that of Attys
Adonis, to the populations beyond the Taurus. At
Komana in Kappadokia, the goddess Ma was ministered
to by 6000 eunuch-priests, and the Galli of Phrygia rivalled the priests of Baal and Ashtoreth in cutting
their arms with knives, in scourging their backs, and in
piercing their flesh with darts. The worship of the
tierce powers of nature, at once life-giving and death
dealing, which required from the believer a sympathetic
participation in the sufferings and pleasures of his deities. produced alternate outbursts of frenzied self-torture and
frenzied lust.
There was, however, a gentler side to the worship of Istar. The cult of a goddess who watched over the
family bond and whose help was ever assured to the
faithful in his trouble, could not but exercise a human
ising influence, however much that influence may have
been sullied by the excesses of the popular religion.
But there were many whose higher and finer natures
were affected only by the humanising influence and not
by the popular faith. Babylonia does not seem to have
produced any class of men like the Israelitish prophets ;
but it produced cultivated scribes and thinkers, who sought
and found beneath the superstitions of their countrymen
a purer religion and a more abiding form of faith. Istar
was to them a divine "mother,"' the goddess who had
begotten mankind, and avIio cared for their welfare with
a mother's love. It is true that they seem to have pre
ferred addressing her by some other name than that
which was polluted by the Galli and their female com

racles ; it was to Gula, rather than to Istar or Rubat, that
the priest of Bel was told to pray ; and the translators of
the penitential psalms turn the Nana (Iniiana) of the
Aecadian original into istaritu, "the goddess/' instead of
Istar. But if questioned, they would have said that the
goddess to whom their petitions and praises were addressed
was indeed Istar, and that Gula and Nana and Milkat
were but various names under which the same deity was
adored. The people, it is true, may have regarded the
goddesses of Babylonia as separate divinities, even as the
peasant of Spain or Italy may to-day regard his local Virgins as distinct each one from the other ; the educated
Babylonian knew them to be but one — divers forms of
the godhead, but no more, .n fact, he did not scruple
to translate by the common name of Istar the several
names under which the chief goddess of Babylonia went
in the old Aecadian l^mns. It is thus that we read in
one of these :
" The light of heaven, who blazsth like the fire, art thou,
O goddess (istaritum), when thou fixest thy dwelling-place in the earth ;
thou who art stroncr as the earth !
O
Thee, the path of justice approaches thee when thou enterest into the house of man.

rior as well as a bride. Among the Ilittites and their
disciples in Asia Minor, she was served not only by Galli,
but by Amazons — warrior priestesses — as well. The
Artemis of Ephesos, her lineal descendant, was separated
by a wide gulf from the Aphrodite of Cyprus. Both Artemis and Aphrodite were alike the offspring of the
same Babylonian deity, but in making their way to Greece
they had become separated and diverse. The goddess
of the Ilittites and of Asia Minor preserved mainly her
fiercer side ; the goddess of Phoenician Cyprus her gen
tler side. Both sides, however, had once been united iu
the Istar of Chaldiea. The Greek myths which recounted
the story of Semiramis recorded the fact. For Semiramis
is but Istar in another guise. As Istar was called "queen"
by the Assyrians, so is Semiramis the queen of Assyria ; as Semiramis deserts Menon for Ninos or Nineveh, so
did Istar desert her old haunts for her later temple at
Nineveh. The dove into which Semiramis was changed
was the bird sacred to Istar. Her passion for her son
Ninyas, "the Ninevito," whom another version of the
myth names Zames or Samas, is an echo of the passion
of Istar, the Dav-kina of Eridu, for Tammuz the Sun
god. The warrior-queen of Assyria, in fact, was the great Babylonian goddess in her martial character.
While the gentler-mannered Babylonians preferred to dwell upon the softer side of Istar, the Assyrians, as was
natural in the case of a military nation, saw in her mainly
the goddess of war and battle. Like Babylonia, with its
two centres of her worship at Erech and Accad, Assyria
also had its two great sanctuaries of Istar at Nineveh and
Arbela. That she should have had no famous temple in



-72 LECTURE IV.
Assur, 1 the old capital of the kingdom, shows clearly the
comparatively late development of her cult. Doubtless
the earliest inhabitants of the Assyrian cities had brought
with them the name and worship of Istar, but it could
only have been long afterwards that it attained its final
celebrity. Indeed, we can trace its progress through the historical inscriptions until it culminates in the reign of
Assur-bani-pal.
There was a particular cause for this gradual development which Avas connected with the warlike attributes
of the Assyrian Istar. The Assyrians were an essen
dally Semitic people. Their supreme goddess accordingly was that vague and colourless Bilit ili, " rhe mistress of
the gods," who sat as a queenly shadow by the side of
Bel. They had none of those associations with the
older Accadian goddesses, with their specific names and
functions, which the natives of the Babylonian cities
possessed ; apart from Istar, the evening star, there was no goddess among them who could claim a more inde
pendent position than that of a Bilit ili. Assur himself
had no special consort, like Zarpanit at Babylon or even
A at Accad.- Except Istar, therefore, the Assyrian pantheon was destitute of a goddess who could assert her
equality with the gods. But the name of Istar, supported as it was by the
1 Tiglath-Pileser I. speaks of building one there along with temples
of Martu and of Bel-labaru, '-'the old Bel" (Col. vi. 86, 87). He gives Tstiir the title of Assuriti, "Assyrian," not "Assurite."
- Tiylath-Pileser III. once mentions Seruha apparently as the consort of Assur (Lay. 17, 15), but this is in connection with his occupa
t ion of Babylonia.



TAMMTJZ AND ISTAR. 273
traditions, the sacred teaching and the literature the
Assyrians had brought from Babylonia, sufficed to keep alive a recollection of the fact that such female divinities
had once been recognised. Accordingly, while Istar on
the one hand tended to be merged into the vague and
general Bilat ili, on the other hand she absorbed their
attributes into herself. With the increasing fame of her
shrines at Nineveh and Arbela, and the rise of Nineveh
as the capital of the country, the second process went on
rapidly. Istar, therefore, while still preserving her indi
viduality, took upon herself all the offices and attributes
of Beltis, the wife of the Sun-god. The ancient myths
which had made her the bride of Tarn muz and Alala,
and her identification with A in Semitic Accad, had
already paved the way. It was thus that the fiercer
aspect of the Sun-god as a warrior, first reflected on his
consort, the Bilat ili, became transferred to the Assyrian
Istar. Istar of Arbela was primarily a militant deity,
the bearer of the bow of war. If the Assyrians were
to have a goddess at all, a deity with an independent character and position of her own, it was necessary that
she should be a goddess of Avar. The earlier kings of
Assyria, Rimmon-nirari I.,Tiglath-Pileser I., Assur-natsirpal and his son Shalmaneser II., pay her but slight atten
tion, invoking her only at the end of their list of gods ;
and when they address her, it is as " the lady of onset,
the strengthener of battle," " the lady of battle and war," "the chieftainess of heaven and earth who makes perfect
the face of the warriors." Even Sargon and Sennacherib
are chary of their references to her; Avhile Tiglath

rather than to Istar, 1 and Shalmaneser II. distinguishes
between the military goddess Istar and Bcltis (Nin-lil),
" the wife of Bel, the mother of the (great) gods." But
with Esar-haddon all is changed Oracles of encourage
ment and prophecies of victory pour in for him from the
priestesses and priests of the temple of Istar at Arbela ;
Istar declares herself to be his mistress, "who will do
battle with the enemies before (his) feet." She promises
to give his foes into his hand: "Fear not, Esar-had
don," is the prophecy delivered through the month of
the priestess Baya, "I am thy strong Baal, I devise the
might 2 of thy heart: I am jealous 3 as thy mother, for
thou hast given me power; the sixty great gods, my
strong ones, shall protect thee; the Moon-god shall be
on thy right hand, the Sun-god on thy left." Another oracle is even more explicit :
"lam Istar of Arbela, Esar-haddon, king of Assyria ; in Assur, in
(Nineveh), in Calah, in Arbela, long days and everlasting years will I give to Esar-haddon my king. I am the lover of thy limbs, 4 thy nurse
and (thy guardian) am I. For long days and everlasting years thy throne I have established in earth and heaven the might}'. For my
veil of gold in the midst of heaven I am jealous. I will cause the
light which clings to it to shine before the lace of Esar-haddon, king
of Assyria, like the crown of my head, (and) behind his feet. Fear

Kassitu probably means -'the Kassite" or Kosssean goddess ; in Kasdinnam we may see an Aramaean form of the Biblical Kasdim.

Assur-bani-pal inherited his father's devotion to Istar,
as well as her care and protection. It was, however,
upon Istar of Xineveh, ''the queen of Kidmur," 1 rather than upon Istar of Arbela, that his attention was more par
ticularly bestowed. Nineveh was for him "the supreme
city of Istar," and it was " by the command of Assur and
Istar" that his wars were undertaken, and by their help
that they were crowned with suceess. When Teumman
of Elam threatened the empire with invasion, he went
into the temple of the goddess, and, like Hezekiah when
he received the letter of Sennacherib, knelt there at the
feet of his deity, and laid before her the scornful message
of the Elamite king The whole passage in which Assur
bani-pal describes his conduct at this moment of danger
is a striking parallel to what we read in the Old Testa
ment concerning the Jewish monarch.
"When Teumman," says Assur-bani-pal, " strengthened himself in Elam, in the assembly of his forces, I looked to Istar who looks on me.
I obeyed not the command of his rebellious mouth, I surrendered not
the fugitives (he had demanded). Teumman devised evil, (and) the Moon-god devised for him omens of evil ; in the month Tammuz, an
eclipse during the morning watch obscured the lord of light and the sun was darkened ; and as he rested, so too did I rest for three days, that the regnal years of the king of Elam might be ended and his
country destroyed. (Thus did) the Moon-god (give) me his command, which may not be altered In the month Ab, the month of the
appearance of the star of the Bow, the festival of the glorious queen
the daughter of Bel (Mnl-lil), in order to worship her, the great (goddess), I stayed in Arbela, the chosen city of her heart. Of the invasion

:«f the Elamite, who marched godlessly, they reported to me as follows : 'Teumman says thus and thus of Istar,' and they reported the tenor of his message that he would not depart until he had gone against Assurbaui-pal to make war. On account of this threat which Teumman had
uttered, I prayed to the exalted one, Istar ; I wept before her, I bowed beneath her, I did honour to her divinity, (and) she came with favour
to me. ' lady of Arbela,' I prayed, ' I am Assur-bani-pal, the creation of thy hands (and the creation of Assur), the father who created thee,
that I might restore the shrines of Assyria and complete the fortresses
of Accad I seek after thy courts, I go to worship (thy divinity) ; and now he, Teumman, king of Elam, who values not the gods, has come up to (make war). Thou art the lady of ladies, the terror of
conflict, the lady of war, the queen of the gods, . . . who in the presence of Assur, the father that created thee, utterest blessings. In the .... he hath desired me .... to make glad the heart of Assur and to give
rest to the liver of Merodach As for Teumman, king of Elam,
who has sinned (grievously) against Assur (the king of the gods), the father that created thee, and against Merodach thy brother and com
panion .... and (against) me, Assur-bani-pal, whom (thou hast desired) to give rest to the heart of Assur and (Merodach), he has gathered his
army, has made ready for war, has asked his soldiers to march to
Assyria ; do thou that art the archer of the gods, strike him down like
a weight in the midst of the battle, and smite him as a tempest of evil
wind.' My lamentable supplication did Istar hear, and ' Fear not,' she said ; she caused me to overflow with (joy of) heart : 'For the lifting
up of thy hands which thou hast lifted up, for thine eyes (that) are
filled with tears, 1 have compassion.' In that veiw hour of the night
when I prayed to her, a certain seer slept, and he dreams a prophetic (?)
dream. A revelation during the night Istar revealed to him (which) he repeated to me thus: 'Istar who dwells in Arbela entered, and
right and left was a quiver uplifted. She held a bow in her hand ; she drew a heavy falchion to make war ; her countenance was wrathful.
Like a fond mother she speaks with thee, she cries to thee. Istar, the
exalted of the gods, appoints thee this message: ' Thou entreatest to
gain victory; the place lies before thee; I am coming!' Thou shalt answer her thus : To the place to which thou goest with thee let mo
go ! The lady of ladies even she declares to thee thus : I will defend
thee that thou mayest dwell in the sacred precincts of Nebo :
l eat food,
drink wine, keep festival, glorify my divinity ; when I have gone, this

message shall be accomplished. I will cause the desire of thy heart to
prevail ; thy face shall not grow pale, thy feet shall not stumble, thy beauty (?) shall not fade. In the midst of battle, in her kindly womb she embosoms thee and embraces thee on every side. Before her a fire
is kindled (fiercely) to overcome thy foes." 1
Istar is here represented in human form, with a quiver
on either shoulder and a bow in the hand. This, in
fact, is the ordinary fashion in which Assyrian art por
trayed the warlike goddess. But Assyrian art was not
peculiar in thus depicting the goddess of love and war. In the older art of Babylonia, of which that of Assyria
was but a modification, the deities of the popular faith
were all represented in human shape. The oldest cylin
ders of Semitic Chaldaea agree in this respect with the
bas-reliefs of the palaces of Nineveh. It is only the
demons and inferior spirits, or mythical personages like
Ea-bani, the friend of Gisdhubar, who are portrayed as
animals, or as composite figures partly human and partly bestial. Ea alone, in his character of "god of life," 2 is
given the fish's skin, and even then the skin is but thrown
over his back like a priestly cloak. The composite mon
sters, whose forms Berossos saw painted on the walls of
the temple of Bclos, were the brood of chaos, not of the
present order of the world. The legend of the creation
preserved by the priests of Cutha declares that the crea
tures, half men and half birds, which were depicted in
sacred art, were suckled by Tiamat, the dragon -like
personification of anarchy and chaos. Their disappear
ance marked the victory of light over darkness, of the
gods of heaven over the Titanic monsters of an extinct

age. The deities of Babylonia were emphatically human ;
human in character and human m form. They stood in
marked contrast to the animal-headed gods of Egypt,
and harmonised with the Semitic belief that made the
deity the father of the human race, who had created man
in his own image. Even in pre-Semitic days, Chaldaean
art had already followed the same line of thought, and
had depicted its divinities in the likeness of men ; but
in pre-Semitic days this was a tendency only; it was not until the Accaclian came in contact with the Semite
that he felt the full force of the Semitic conception, and
allowed his ancient deities of light and life to take per
manently upon them the human shape. 1 For there are many indications that it had not always
been so. The very fact that the divine beings who in
the Semitic era were relegated to the realms of chaos or
the inferior world of subordinate spirits, were to the last
represented as partly bestial in form, proves pretty clearly
that the Babylonians had once seen nothing derogatory to the divine nature in such a mode of representation.
1 The fact that the gods of Babylonia were represented in human form leads us to expect to find also the converse fact, the apotheosis of
men. Our expectation is fulfilled, at any rate as regards the earlier
period of Semitic Babylonia. A haematite cylinder, found by Gen. di
Cesnola in Cyprus, gives Naram-Sin, the son of Sargon, the invader of the island, the title of god, and on the bricks of Amar-Agu or Euru-Sin
of Ur (W. A. I. i. 5, xix.) the divine title is prefixed to the royal name. It is significant that this deification of the monarch is coeval with the rise of .Semitic supremacy, and that it never took firm hold of the reli
gious faith of the people. At all events, there is no trace of it from the time of Khaminuragas downwards. It is. true that the Kassite
sovereign Agu-kak-rime (cir. B.C. 1630) claims to be descended from the god Sugamuna (W.A.I, v. 33. i. 4); but Agu-kak-rime was neither a Semite nor a Sunierian, and to claim descent from a god is not the
same as claiming to be a god oneself.



PROMETHEUS AND TOTEM1SM. 270
The winged bulls who guarded the approach to the
temple and protected it from the invasion of evil spirits,
or the eagle-headed cherubs who knelt on either side of
the sacred tree, were survivals of a time when " the great
gods of heaven and earth" were themselves imaged and
adored in similar form. The same evidence is borne by
the animals on whose backs the anthropomorphic deities
are depicted as standing in later art. When the gods
had become human, there was no other place left for the
animals with whom they had once been so intimately
connected. The evidence, however, is not borne by art
alone. The written texts aver that the gods were sym
bolised by animals, like the Sun-god of Kis, whose
"image" or symbol was the eagle. It is these symbols
which appear on the Babylonian boundary-stones, where
in the infancy of Assyrian research they were supposed
to represent the Zodiacal signs.
That they were originally something more than mere
symbols is expressly indicated in the myths about the
goddess of love. Gisdhubar taunts her with her treat
ment, not only of Alula, the eagle, but also of the horse
and the lion, whose names are not given to us. Here, at
any rate, popular tradition has preserved a recollection of
the time when the gods of Babylonia were still regarded
as eagles and horses and lions. We are taken back to
an epoch of totemism, when the tribes and cities of
Chaldsea had each its totem, or sacred animal, to whom
it offered divine worship, and who eventually became its
creator-god. Not less clear is the legend of the first
introduction of culture into the valley of the Euphrates.
Oannes, or Ea, it was ever remembered, had the body of a fish, and, like a fish, he sank each night into the waters



"280 LECTURE IV.
of the Persian Gulf when the day was closed which he
had spent among his favoured disciples of Eridu. The
culture-god himself had once been a totem, from which
we may infer how long it was before totemism disap
peared, at all events from southern Babylonia, where
the contact with Semitic thought was less strong and
abiding than was the case further north.
We can learn a good deal about this totemism from the
old ideographic representations of the names of the chief
deities. They are like fossils, embodying the beliefs of
a period which had long passed away at the date of the
earliest monuments that have come down to us. The
name of Ea himself affords ns an example of what we
may find. It is sometimes expressed by an ideograph
which signifies literally " an antelope" {dura in Accadian,
turakhu in Assyrian, whence perhaps the Biblical name
of Terah). 1 Thus we are told that Ea was called "the
antelope of the deep," "the antelope the creator," "the
antelope the prince," "the lusty antelope;" 2 and the
"ship" or ark of Ea in which his image was carried at
festivals was entitled " the ship of the divine antelope of
the deep." 3 We should, indeed, have expected that the animal of Ea would have been the fish rather than the
antelope, and the fact that it is not so points to the con
clusion that the culture-god of southern Babvlonia was
an amalgamation of two earlier deities, one the divine
1 Turakhu is the Arabic arkhu, " an antelope," and is a tiphel formation from the Assyrian verb ardkhu, "to run quickly." The word lias no connection with the Accadian dara. Friedrich Delitzsch lona
ago suggested that it represented the Biblical Terah (Aspyrische S'udlen, i. p. 51).
* W. A. I. ii. 55, 27—30. « W. A. I. ii G2, 30.



PEOMETHEUS AND TOTEM ISM. 281
antelope, and the other the divine fish. Perhaps it was
originally as the god of the river that Ea had been adored
under the form of the wild beast of the Eden or desert.
There was yet another animal with which the name of
Ea had been associated. This was the serpent. The
Euphrates in its southern course bore names in the early
inscriptions which distinctly connect the serpent with Ea on the one hand, and the goddess Innina on the other.
It was not only called "the river of the great deep"
a term which implied that it was a prolongation of the
Persian Gulf and the encircling ocean; it was further
named the river of the subur lilli, "the shepherd's hut
of the lillu" or "spirit," "the river of Innina," "the
river of the snake," and "the river of the girdle of the
great god." 1 In-nina is but another form of Innana or
Nana, and we may see in her at once the Istar of Eridu
and the female correlative of Aniina. Among the chief
deities reverenced by the rulers of Tel-loh was one whose
name is expressed by the ideographs of "fish" and "en
closure," which served in later days to denote tlie name
of Nina or Nineveh. It seems clear, therefore, that the
pronunciation of Nina was attached to it ; and Dr. Oppert
may accordingly be right in thus reading the name of the goddess as she appears on the monuments of Tel-loh.
Nina, consequently, is both the fish -goddess and the
divinity whose name is interchanged with that of the
snake. 2 Now Nina was the daughter of Ea, her eldest

Hommel, where Dungi built her a temple which he called
" the house of the jewelled circlet" (sutartu). This latter
epithet recalls to us the Tillili of the Tammuz legend as
well as the Istar of later Babylonia. In fact, it is pretty
clear that Xina, "the lady," must have been that primi
tive Istar of Eridu and its neighbourhood who mourned
like Tillili the death of Tammuz, and whose title was
but a dialectic variation of that of Xana given to her at
Erech.
After this, it is not difficult to disentangle the primitive
relation that existed between the totems of the antelope,
the fish and the serpent, at Eridu. Ea was the antelope
as god of the river ; as god of the deep he was Oannes
the fish. His daughter was denoted by a compound
ideograph which represented her birth from the residence
of the fish-god, though she was herself one of the poisonous
reptiles that swarmed in the marshes at the mouth of the
Euphrates. It was in this way that the serpent became
connected with the god of wisdom, "more subtil than
any beast of the field" which had been created in the
land of Edina.
It is now possible to explain the allusions in an old
Accadian poem, in which Merodach(?) is made to describe
his weapon of war. After comparing it with "the fish
of seven fins," he goes on to say : " The tempest {main)
of battle, my weapon of fifty heads (I bear), which like
the great serpent of seven heads is yoked with seven
heads, which like the strong serpent of the sea (sweeps
away) the foe." 1 Here the serpent is regarded as essen

PROMETHEUS AND TOTEMISM. 283
tially a serpent of the sea, and in its seven heads we may
see the primitive conception of its divine power. The "evil spirits" were seven in number also, like the spirits
of the earth , and the mythical fish which may be the
totem of the fish-god is provided with seven fins. 1 The
destructive character of the great serpent is naturally
insisted on. Doubtless the serpent-god of the primitive
Sumerian was morally of a negative nature, or else
regarded as injuring only his enemies, while he did good
to those who propitiated him. But this early serpentworship faded away with the transformation of the totem
into an anthropomorphic deity. The goddess Nina ceased
to retain her serpentile attributes, and after the era of
the monuments of Tcl-loh passed almost entirely out of
memory ; while the serpent became, what indeed he
always seems to have been in genuine Semitic belief, the
incarnation of wickedness and guile. We read in the
bilingual lists of "the evil serpent," "the serpent of
darkness ;" 2 and it is probable that the imagination of a
later time confounded this serpent of darkness with the
dragon Tiamat, the leader of the powers of night and
chaos. It was a curious process of development which
eventually transformed the old serpent - goddess, "the lady Nina," into the embodiment of all that was hostile
to the powers of heaven ; but, after all, Nina had sprung
from the fish-god of the deep, and Tiamat is herself " the
deep" in a Semitic dress.
At times Ea was regarded as a gazelle 3 rather than

as an antelope. It was thus that he was entitled " the
princely gazelle," "the lusty gazelle," "the gazelle who
gives the earth" (W.A.I, ii. 5-3. 31—33) ; and Merodaeh
as his son is termed Asari-elim, " the mighty one of the
gazelle-god." A hymn which celebrates Merodaeh under
a number of his archaic names, declares that he is "Asari
elim, the mighty prince, the light (of the gods), the director of the laws of Anu, Bel (Mnl-liJ) (and Ea)." 1
The gazelle, however, was more correctly appropriated to Mul-lil of Mpur, who was specially called "the gazelle
god." 2 We may infer, accordingly, that the gazelle had
once been the totem of Mpur, and the representative of
its god of the under-world. It was, indeed, a peculiarly
sacred animal. We find it repeatedly on the early Chal
daean cylinders, sometimes being offered in sacrifice to a
deity, sometimes simply standing at his side as a symbol.
It frequently takes the place of the goat, which was also
sacred, and as such was exalted into the Zodiacal sign of
Capricornus. Since Tebet, the tenth month, corresponds
to the sign of Capricornus and was dedicated to Pap-sukal,
it is possible that Pap-sukal, " the messenger of the gods," was himself the goat-god. At any rate, there was a
deity called Uz, 3 the Accadian word for a goat ; and a
iv. 70, 55). The position of the name in the list of animals ( \Y. A. I. ii. 6, 7), shows what species of animal must be meant. Lulim, " a stag," seems to be a re-duplicated form of the same word. Both ltdim and
- lim are said to be equivalent to mrru, " king."

curious piece of sculpture on a stone tablet found, by
Mr. Rassam in the temple of the Sun-god at Sippara
describes "Sin, Samas and Istar," as being "set as com
panions at the approach to the deep in sight of the god Uz." 1 The "crown of the Sun-god" is further said to
be the us, or " glory," of the eyes, with a play upon the
resemblance of the Semitic word uzsu, "glory," to the
Accadian uz, "a goat," The god Uz himself is depicted
as sitting on a throne, watching the revolution of the
solar disk, which is placed upon a table and slowly turned
by means of a rope. He holds in his hand a ring and
bolt, and is clad in a robe of goats' skin, the sacred dress
of the Babylonian priests. It reminds us of "the skins
of the kids of the goats" which Eebekah put upon Isaac
in order that he might receive his father's blessing. The
milk of the goat appears in the liturgical texts along with
other offerings to the gods ; thus we rend in a hymn : 2
" The milk of a light-coloured 3 goat which in a pure feeding-place the shepherd of Tammuz4 has reared,
Uz is glossed by Utuki, " the (great) spirit," and explained to be synonymous with the Sun-god. As the document or documents upon which
this tablet is a commentary seem to have been a product of the court
of Sargon at Accad, we may infer that Uz, " the goat," was a title of the
Sun-god of Sippara. The mythical "goat with six heads" is referred
to in a bilingual text (\V. A. I. iv. 30, 11).

O Nin-akha-kiida, 3 lady of the purely-gleaming water, make the
worshipper pure and bright !"
Here the divine goat is associated with Mul-lil, and
perhaps we may therefore conclude that it was specially
adored at Nipur. The inference is not certain, however,
1 Viiila, Accadian qar-us, in a liturgical fragment (S712, 5) we
read of " the wool (or hair) of a qar-us yet unborn ;" and in S 2073, JL 9, mention is made of "the flesh of the qar."
2 " The god of far-reaching purity" or perhaps " the distant gleam"(J). 'S/ii/a, however, may represent sirja, "the horned one." In W.A.I. ii. 4, 662, iigga is written siqqa, and in 6, 5, seqa, and rendered by the
Assyrian atudu, "he-goat." In W. A. I. iii. 68, 12 — 14, Azaga-suga (sud), the wife of Rimmon, is called the milch-kid of Mul-lil, and the names of its two shepherds are given in lines 36, 37.
3 Nin-akha-kiida is invoked in other magic formulae : so in W. A. I.
iv. 15, 39, it is said of the sick man, " May Nin-akha-kudda seize upon
his body and rest upon his head !" and in Haupt's Keilschrifttexte, ii. 26,
she is mentioned along with Bahu and Gula. In W. A. I. ii. 58. 48, 49, we read of "the pure water of Ea, the purely-gleaming water of Nin
akha-kudda, the water of the pure hand, of the pure deep," where the
goddess is associated with Ea and the deep; and in D.T. 57. Obi: 14 — 16,
we have " the spell of Ea and Merodach, the spell of Damu and Gula, the spell of Nin-akha-kudda." Similarly in 1266. 12, 13, an invocation
is addressed to "Nin-akha-kuddu, Nin-kurra, [En-nu-]gi the son of Xin-si-nagar-bu, and Xin-zaditn." In K4195, 12, Nin-akha-kuddu is
identified with Iskhara or Istar. In M 192, 4 sq.,
" the daily food" is
enumerated of Mul-lil, Ea " the king of the deep," " the divine king of
the gods and the queen (of the gods)," Samas " the lord of crowns, the
.decider of (destiny)," "the god who prospers all above and below," Merodach, Adar "the first-born of Mul-lil," Nin-akha-kuddu, Nin
karratim and Istar. Nin-akha-kudda means " the lady who divides the
rising (fresh) water" as appears from the statement in W. A. I. iii. QS, 40, that she was "the lady of the rising waters (a-Ichad) of Ea." The fol
lowing line shows that Agubba, " the purely-gleaming water" (sunqu in Assyrian), was also deified.



PROMOTIIKUS AND TOTEMISM. 287
ae the text belongs to that later period when the cities
and deities of Babylonia had been brought into union
with one another.
I have already alluded to the fact that the Sun-god of
Nipur was connected with the pig. Adar was " lord of
the swine," and the swine would therefore seem to have
once been a totem of the city in which he was worshipped.
Nothing could show more clearly that Babylonian tote
mism belongs to the pre-Semitic history of the country,
and the conclusion is supported by the large place
occupied by the dog in what I may call the zoological mythology of Chaldaea. In Semitic times the dog was
as distasteful to the Babylonians as he was, and is, to
the Semitic inhabitants of other parts of the world. We
have a proof of this in a prayer against the powers of evil, in which we read :
" (From) the baleful fetter, the fetter which injures the feet .... the
xiog, the .snake, the scorpion, the reptile, and whatsoever is baleful, the
possession of the heart, the possession (of the body, may Merodach j) reserve us)." 1
The dog is avoided by the earlier art of Assyria ; and
-even in Babylonia, where a particular and much-esteemed
breed existed, almost the only representation of the animal
that is known is on a terra-cotta plaque of the Sassanian
period.'2 Nevertheless, there was a time when the Baby

Ionian dog was otherwise regarded. Merodach and the
dog were brought into connection with one another.
The beneficent god of later iiaoyionian religion owned
four divine hounds, namedUkkumu, "the seizer," Akkulu,
"the devourer," Iksuda, "the capturer," and Iltebu,
" the pursuer." 1 We may suspect that the dogs were not
always sent on errands of mercy, and that originally they had been devastating winds who followed in the track of
a death-dealing god. An incantation begins with the
words: "0 Merodach, the lord of death, thy hand esta
blishes the house of light," 2 where perhaps we have a
tradition of the asre when Merodach was not as yet the
god who raises the dead to life, but the god of death
only. At all events, the hounds appear in no favourable
character in the fragment of a legend which related to
the shepherd Matsarat-pi-baladhi (?).
3 After a reference
to Eiinmon, the shepherd's heart is told to rejoice because
of the message sent him by Ea through the lips of Mero
dach. "(Ea)has heard thee," it is said to him ; "when
the great dogs" assault thee, then " Matsarat-pi-baladhi,
shepherd of the flock, seize them from behind and lay
them down. Hold them and overcome them. Strike
their head, pierce (nihi) their breast. An expedition they are gone ; never may they return ! With the wind
of mischief;" (3) Dayan rits-su, "the judge of his companions;" (4)
Munasiku gari-su, " the biter of Ins foes ;" (5) Kasid abi, " the seizer of enemies." See Houghton on ''The Mammalia of the Assyrian Sculptures" in the Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch. v. 1.

may they go, with the storm above it ! Take their road
and cut oft' their going. Seize their mouth, seize their
mouth, seize their weapons ! Seize their teeth (silt), and
make them ascend, by the command of Ea, the lord of
wisdom ; by the command of the Sun-god, the lord of all
that is above ; by the command of Merodach, the lord of
revelation" (bar-bar-ti). The recitation of this curious
legend formed part of a religious ceremony, and was ordered to be followed by the triple repetition of a prayer
"before the god Azag-suga." This god, as we have
seen, was primarily a goat, and it was no doubt on this
account that a portion of an old poem about a shepherd
who had driven away the dogs from his flock was intro
duced into the service. The poem, however, like the
service, transports us to Semitic days; the dog has become a hateful creature, and what divinity he has is
of a demoniac character.
Unlike the dog, the ox remained in honour among the
Babylonians, and the mythologists accordingly did not wholly forget that one at least of "the great gods" had
once been identified with this animal. An early geogra
phical list calls Dapara, " the mountain of the Bull-god,"
the country of crystal ;
l and that this was to be sought
in southern Babylonia is indicated by the name of the
Uknu, the river of "crystal." There is some evidence
that the primitive Bull-god was Merodach himself. Ea
and his wife had each two divine "bulls" attached to
them, those of Ea being named " the god of the field of
Eden" and "the god of the house of Eden." 2 These
bull-gods must be distinguished from the colossal figures,

the win god hulls, that guarded the entrance to a temple. 1
We may speak of the latter as "Assyrian bulls," but such was never their name among either Babylonians or
Assyrians. To them they represented divine beings, the
gods or genii of the household, in fact, but not bulls. The face was wanting which was needed to transform the
colossus into an image of the animal. The human head
showed that the creature was endowed with humanity
as much as Ea-bani, the friend of Grisdhubar, whose
body terminated in the legs of a goat, but who was
nevertheless in all respects a man. The bull-like body
of the divine guardians of the household symbolised
strength, at all events to the Semitic Babylonian, who
persistently paraphrased the Accadian word for "bull," when used as a proper name, by words that denoted
"hero" and "strong one." The winged bulls and the
divine bulls of Eridu were not one and the same, however
much the imagination of a later day may have tended to
confound them together.
The fact that the two great deities of Eridu were thus
attended by a body-guard of divine bulls, makes us in
dined to connect the Bull-god of Dapara very closely
indeed with the city of Eridu. We need not be astonished,
therefore, at finding Merodach entitled in early astrono
mical literature Gudi-bir, " the bull of light." The sky,
as we have seen, was regarded as a second Babylonian
plain, over which the sun ploughed his way along the
ecliptic or " furrow of heaven." The pole-star was called
1 In Accadian, alad and lamma; in Assyrian, sSdu, buhidu and lamuiisu. The last word seems to have been borrowed from the Acca
dian lamma in its primitive form (lamas). Alad is " the spirit," from ula, with the suffix d(a).



PBOMETHEUS AND TOTEMISM. 291
its "yoke," 1 and Jupiter, the nearest of the planets to
the ecliptic, was known as Lubat-Grudibir, "the wether"
or "planet of the Bull of Light." The Bull of Light,
therefore, was himself the ploughman of the celestial
fields, the Sun-god who trod his steady path through the
heavenly signs, like the patient ox who dragged the plough
through the fields below. It was as the Sun-god, moving
through the twelve Zodiacal signs of the year, that Mero
dach, it is asserted, was known by this particular name. Now^the explanation of the name of Gudibir as Mcro
dach, the Sun-god, comes from a tablet which seems to
have been a philological commentary on the astronomical
works compiled for the court of Sargon of Accad. We
know that Sargon' s patronage of science produced the
great standard Babylonian work on astronomy and astrology, in seventy-two books, which went under the name
of the "Observations of Bel." It was translated into
Greek by the Chaldcean historian Berossos, and large
portions of it, including a table of contents, are among
the tablets found on the site of the library of Kouyunjik.
In the course of centuries it had undergone a large
amount of interpolation and addition ; marginal glosses had crept into the text, and new paragraphs had been
inserted recording the observations that had been made
1 Or rather, perhaps, the constellation of Draco generally, a Dra
conis being at the time the pole-star. The star (or constellation) was called jiu-bu-khir-da in Accadian, which the Semitic astronomers paraphrased by "the star of Ann, the arbiter (mamit) of heaven"
(W.A.I, ii. 47, 16), and more literally "the yoke of heaven" (v. 18, 2-i). The Accadian (or rather Sumerian) is probably to be read giisiv
kescla, " yoke of the enclosure." Glsm and ijisrara, giiia, gisdilla and gunlrra, are given as dialectical forms of the Accadian word for "yoke"

by the astronomers and astrologers of Babylonia during the whole length of the historical period. In the form,
therefore, in which it was edited for the library of
Xineveh, it was very different from the original work
that had been composed by the orders of Sargon. Old
and new matter had been mixed up in it, and the enlarge
ments introduced into it had probably nearly doubled its
original size. But the original work was itself a com
pilation of records and observations that had been made
during an untold number of previous years. These
records and observations had for the most part been
written in Accadian ; the result being that, although the
astronomy of the Chalda?ans, as we know it, is purely Semitic in form and character, many of its technical
terms are non-Semitic, as well as the names of the celestial
bodies. Hence it is that we find a remarkable inconsis
tencv between certain facts reported by the astronomical
tablets and the astronomical system which they set before
us. This astronomical system is based upon the assump
tion that the sun enters the first point of the constellation
Aries at the time of the vernal equinox. The system
must therefore have come into existence later than the
26th century before the Christian era, when Aries first
became the starting-point of the Zodiacal signs. But
the signs themselves were named, and the path of the
sun through them was mapped out, when the vernal
equinox still coincided with the sun's entrance, not into
Aries, but into Taurus. The whole pre-Semitic nomen
clature of the Zodiacal signs, and the months of the year
that correspond to them, rests on the supposition that the Zodiacal bull ushers in the vernal year. Its Accadian
name was " the directing Bull," the bull that directs



PROMETHEUS AND TOTEMISM. 2 (J8
the course of the year ; and the sign which faced it, the
Scorpion of a later age, was correspondingly termed the star "that is opposite to the foundation" of the year.
We can now understand why the Sun-god Merodach, whom even the astronomers of the historical period con
tinued to identify with the typical constellations of the
twelve months of the year, 1 should have been entitled
" the Bull of Light" in the primitive astronomical records.
He was, in fact, the celestial bull who ploughed the
the great furrow of the sky, and from whom the first
sign of the Zodiac borrowed its name. We may see in
him the prototype of that famous bull of later legend
whom Anu created in order to avenge upon Gisdhubar
the slight offered by the latter to Istar. The Sun-god
eventually became the monster slain by a solar hero.
Such are the results of time working upon the half-for
gotten beliefs and tales of an earlier age.
While in some instances the old totemistic conceptions
were evaded by the degeneration of a god into a mere
animal, in others the reverse process took place, the
bestial element being eliminated from the nature of the
god. It was thus that "the divine storm-bird" of the
ancient Accadian faith passed into the god Zu of the
Semitic epoch. "The divine storm-bird" was a ravenous
bird of prey, of large size and sharp beak, who darted on
its spoil and devoured the flesh. The Semitic Babylonians
identified it with their Zu, partly because zu signified a

identified with Dun-knn-e, " the hero of the rising dawn," or Mercury,
who is elsewhere called " the prince of the men of Harran" (iii. 67, 28), in consequence of the cult that was carried on there. In ^dar, the last month, he was "the fish of Ea" or Pisces. "The Bull of heaven*

294 LECTURE IV.
"stormy wind," partly because a species of vulture was called by the same name. But the conception of the
tempest as a bird which rushes on its prey is common to
many mythologies. In Aryan mythology the stormcloud appears under the varying forms of the eagle, the
woodpecker, and the robin redbreast, the sacred bird of
Thor; while in Chinese folk-lore the storm-bird is "a
bird which in flying obscures the sun and of whose quills
are made water-tuns." The roc of the Arabian Nights,
with its wings ten thousand fathoms in width, and its
egg which it was a sin in Aladdin to wish to take from
the place where it hung, is but an echo of the Chinese
storm-bird. It is in the nest of the storm-bird that the
tempest is brewed; it swoops upon the earth with the rush of his wings, and the lightning itself is but the gleam
of his flight. Even a poet of to-day instinctively speaks of the curlews as "dreary gleams about the moorland
flying over Locksley Hall."
"The divine storm-bird " was known as Lugal-banda,
"the lusty king," and was the patron deity of the city
of Marad, near Sippara. He brought the lightning, the
fire of heaven, from the gods to men, giving them at
once the knowledge of fire and the power of reading the
future in the flashes of the storm. Like Prometheus,
therefore, he was an outcast from the gods. He had
stolen their treasures and secret wisdom, and had com
municated them to mankind. In Babylonia, as in Greece,
the divine benefactor of primitive humanity was doomed
to suffer. The knowledge and the artificial warmth man
has gained are not the free gifts of the gods ; they have
been wrenched from them by guile ; and though man
has been allowed to retain them, his divine friend and



PROMETHEUS AND TOTEMISM. 20T)
benefactor is condemned to punishment. The culture
god of totemistic Marad is thus a very different being
from the culture-god of Eridu; both, indeed, are clad in animal form; but whereas the fish-god of Eridu is
the willing and unhindered communicator of civilisation,
whose successor, Merodach, becomes a god of light and
healing, the bird-god of Marad is a pariah among his divine brethren, hunted out of heaven by the great gods,
and wresting from them by craft man's future knowledge
of good and evil. It was only in the later syncretic age,
when these uglier facts of the earlier mythology were
glossed over or forgotten, that the divine "bull" was
described as "the offspring of the god Zu" (W. A. I. iv.
23, 19).
The scribes of Assur-bani-pal have preserved for us
the mutilated copy of a bilingual poem, or part of a poem, which recounted the flight of Zu to the mountain
of 'Sabu or Kis. It begins thus :
1
" Lugal-tudda (fled) to the mountain a place remote In the hill of 'Sahu he (dwelt). No mother inhabits it and (cares for him). No father inhabits it and (associates) with him.
No priest 2 who knows him (assists him). He who (changed) not the resolution, even the resolution of his
heart, in his own heart (he kept) his resolution.

even the god of the river-reeds (Enna) and the goddess the lady
of the basket of river-reeds (Gu-enna). 1
From his mountain he brought (her), as a woman fashioned 2 for a mother made beautiful, 3 the goddess of plants,4 as a woman fashioned for a mother made

On (his) head he placed a circlet ; .... on his head he set a coronal
(when) he came from the nest of the god Zu. (In a place) unknown in the mountain he made his tomb."
It will be seen that the identity of the god Zn with a
bird is explained in accordance with the ideas of a modern
time. It has become a transformation voluntarily under
gone by the deity, for the sake, as it would seem, of securing a beautiful bride. The old faith of totemism is

thus changing into a fairy-tale. But there were other
stories which remembered that the transformation of the
god was not the voluntary act it is here represented to
have been. A long but broken text explains why it was
that he had to take refuge in the mountain of Sabu
under the guise of a bird of prey. We learn that Zu
gazed upon the work and duties of Mul-lil; "he sees
the crown of his majesty, the clothing of his divinity, the tablets of destiny, and Zu himself, and he sees also
the father of the gods, the bond of heaven and earth.
The desire to be Bel (Mul-lil) is taken in his heart ; yea,
he sees the father of the gods, the bond of heaven and
earth ; the desire to be Bel is taken in his heart :
' Let me
seize the tablets of destiny of the gods, and the laws of
all the gods let me establish (lukhmum) ; let my throne
be set up, let me seize the oracles ; let me urge on the
whole of all of them, even the spirits of heaven.' So his
heart devised opposition; at the entrance to the forest
where he was gazing he waited with his head (intent)
during the day. When Bel pours out the pure waters,
his crown was placed on the throne, stripped from (his
head). The tablets of destiny (Zu) seized with his hand ;
the attributes of Bel he took ; he delivered the oracles.
(Then) Zu fled away and sought his mountains. He
raised a tempest, making (a storm)."
Then Mul-lil, " the father and councillor " of the gods,
consulted, his brother divinities, going round to each in
turn. Ami was the first to speak. He " opened his
mouth, he speaks, he says to the gods his sons :
' (Whoever will,) let him subjugate Zu, and (among all) men
let the destroyer pursue him (?).' (To Rimmon) the first
born, the strong, Anu declares (his) command, even to

him : ... 1 Eimmon, protector (?), may thy power of
fighting never fail ! (Slay) Zu with thy weapon. (May
thy name) be magnified in the assembly of the great gods.
(Among) the gods thy brethren (may it destroy) the
rival. May incense (?) (etarsi) be offered, and may
shrines be built ! (In) the four (zones) may they esta
blish thy strongholds. May they magnify thy fortress that it become a fane of power in the presence of the
gods, and may thy name be mighty ? '
( Eimmon )
answered the command, (to Ami) his father he utters
the word :
' (0 my father, to a mountain) none has seen
mayest thou assign (him) ; (never may) Zu play the thief
(again) among the gods thy sons ; (the tablets of destiny) his hand has taken; (the attributes of Bel) he seized, be
delivered the oracles ; (Zu) has fled away and has sought
his mountains.' " Eimmon goes on to decline the task,
which is accordingly laid upon another god, but with
like result. Then Anu turns to Xebo : " (To Kebo), the
strong one, the eldest son of Istar, (Anu declares his
will) and addresses him : ... '0 Nebo, protector (?),
never may thy power of fighting foil ! (Slay) Zu with
thy weapon. May (thy name) be magnified in the as
sembly of the great gods ! Among the gods thy brethren (may it destroy) the rival ! May incense (?) be offered
and may shrines be built ! In the four zones may thy
strongholds be established ! May they magnify thy
stronghold that it become a fane of power in the presence
of the gods, and may thy name be mighty!' Xebo ;n lowered the command: '0 my father, to a mountain
none hast seen mayest thou assign (him) ; never may Zu
play the thief (again) among the gods thy sons ! The
tablets of destiny his hand has taken ; the attributes of



PROMETHEUS AND TOTEMISM. 299
Bel he has seized ; he lias delivered the oracles ; Zu is
fled away and (has sought) his mountains.' " Like Kim
mon, Nebo also refused to hunt down and slay his brother
god, the consequence being, as we have seen, that Zu
escaped with his life, but was changed into a bird, and had to live an exile from heaven for the rest of time.
The " divine storm-bird," however, who invested him
self bv stealth with the attributes of Mul-lil, and carried
the knowledge of futurity to mankind, served to unite the two species of augury which read the future in the
flight of birds and the flash of the lightning. The first
species was but a branch of the general pseudo-science which discovered coining events from the observation of
animals and their actions, while the second species was
closely allied to the belief that in the thunder men heard
the voice of the gods. The old belief marked its impress
upon Hebrew as well as upon Assyro-Babylonian thought.
" The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind,'' says
the Psalmist ;
x and nothing can show more clearly what
must once have been the Canaanitish faith than the poetic
imagery of another Psalm (xxix.) : " The voice of the
Lord is upon the waters ; the God of glory thundereth ;
the Lord is upon many waters. The voice of the Lord is
powerful ; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty. The
voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars ; yea, the Lord
breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. . . . The voice of the
Lord shaketh the wilderness ; the Lord shaketh the wil
derness of Kadesh. The voice of the Lord maketh the
hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests." In the
Talmud, " the voice of the Lord" has become the bath qol,

rjr " daughter of the voice," a supernatural message from lieaven which sometimes proceeded from the Holy of
Holies, sometimes, like the Saipoviov of Socrates, assumed
the form of an intuition directing the recipient as to his
course in life. 1
This prophetic voice of heaven was heard in the thunder
by the Accadians as well as by the Semites. I have
already noticed that the Accadians believed the sounds
of nature to be divine voices, from which the initiated
could derive a knowledge of the future. At Eridu it
was more especially the roar of the sea in which the
Sumcrian priest listened to the revelations of his deities,
and this perhaps was the oracle through which Oannes
had spoken to men. In the rival city of northern Baby
lonia, where the supreme god presided over the realm of the dead, and not over the waters of the sea, the divine
voice came to men in the thunder. By the side of Mul
lil, the lord of the ghost -world, stood Mul-me-sarra
(Wiil-mo-sara), " the lord of the voice of the firmament/'
Mul-me-sarra, in fact, was but Mul-lil himself in another
form, and hence, as lord of Hades, was the author, not only of the thunder, but of subterranean noises as well.
It is thus that he is addressed in a hymn, which is, how
ever, not older than the Semitic period : 2

Archaeology, Ap. 6, 18S6, pp. 117, 118.

on the east side of it. "Altogether," it is stated, "there are fifteen hymns (to be said) on the north and east sides. On the west, nine

Perhaps Mul-me-sarra is also the deity who is addressed
in another hymn 3 as "the warrior-god (Erimmu), the
bright one, the sword (or lightning) of Istar," and of whom it is said: "May he give thee rest with kindly
hand (rittu), may he rain life and tranquillity upon thee with his hand !
" Under the name of Iskhara, Istar herself
was called "the sword" or "lightning of heaven," and
as such was identified with the constellation of the
Scorpion; 4 and the hand of the goddess Bunene is enti
tled "the inundator of the lightning," that of the Ela

and that of the god of impurity "the inundator of the
crown (?)." 1
The voices heard by the Babylonian in nature, however, were not a whit more sacred to him than the inarticulate
voice which found expression in the name. Like all
primitive peoples, the Chakheans confounded the person
and the name by which he was known. The name, in
fact, was the personality, and whatever happened to the
name would happen equally to the personality. Injury could be done to a person by using his name in a spell ;
and, similarly, to pronounce the name of a deity compelled him to attend to the wishes of the priest or exorcist.
As among the ancient Egyptians, the secret names of
the gods—many of them heirlooms from a primaeval age,
whose actual meaning was forgotten — were not only
especially holy, but also especially efficacious. Xames,
consequently, like the persons or things they represented, were in themselves of good and evil omen ; and the
Babylonian would have sympathised with the feeling which made the Roman change Maleventum into Bene
ventum, or has caused the Cape of Storms to become the
Cape of Good Hope. Whether this superstition about
names was of purely Semitic origin, or whether it was
shared in by the Accadians, we have no means of deter
mining at present ; the analogy of other races, however,
in a corresponding stage of social development would lead us to infer that the superstition was the independent
possession of Accadians and Semites alike. At all events,
it was deeply imprinted upon the Semitic mind. The
gacredness attached to the name of the God of Israel
1 K 220, Rev.



PROMETHEUS AND TOTEMISM. 303
among the later Jews, and the frequent employment of the name for the person of the Lord, bear witness to the
fact. When Moses was ordained to his mission of lead
ing his people out of Egypt and forming them into a nation, it was prefaced by what was henceforth to be
the sacred and national name of their God.
There were names of good fortune and names of evil
fortune, 1 and special significance was attached to a change of name. Three successive usurpers of the throne
of Assyria—Pul, Ulula or Ilulaios, and the father of
Sennacherib—all discarded their old names on the suc
cessful accomplishment of their usurpation. Pul and Ulula adopted those of the two famous monarchs of the
older Assyrian dynasty, Tiglath-Pileser and Shalmaneser,
retaining their original designations only in Babylonia, where the names they had adopted were associated with
ideas of hostility and invasion; while Sargon, who claimed
to be lord of Babylonia as well as of Assyria, identified
himself with the past glories of the ancient kingdom by
taking the name of Sargon of Accad. The adoption of
these time-honoured names of itself conferred legitimacy
upon the new claimants of the throne; along with the
name they inherited the title and the claim to veneration
of those who had borne them. It must have been for a
similar reason that Esar-haddon's name, according to
Sennacherib, was changed to that of Assur-etil-yukinabla, "Assur the hero has established the son," "for
affection's sake," 2 though the prince preferred to retain his earlier appellation of Esar-haddon or Assnr-akh
1 W.A.I, v. 27, 49—52.

iddina, " Assur has given the trother," after his accession
to the throne. We are reminded of the records of the
Jews, from which we learn that Jedidiah became the
Solomon of later history, and the Pharaoh of isgypt
"turned the name" of Eliakim into Jehoiakim.
The preservation of their names was a matter about
which the kings of Babylonia and Assyria were especially anxious. Terrible curses are denounced against those
who should destroy or injure " the writing of their
names," and substitute their own names instead. On
the other hand, the gods are invoked to allow the names
of the kings to last " for ever," or to " guide their names
aright." Even captured cities have their names altered
in token of conquest, and it is possible that the scru
pulous care with which the names of foreign potentates
are recorded in the Assyrian annals, as well as the interest
shown by both Babylonians and Assyrians in the lan
guages of their neighbours, had to do with the peculiar
respect they paid to the name. In the ancient hymns, the phrase, " mankind, what
soever be their name," is of frequent occurrence, and seems to signify that as the special favours of the gods
could be showered only on those whose names were recited,
a vague and general expression of the kind would avoid
the difficulty of enumerating by its own name each divi
sion of the human race. So, too, when the author of a
penitential psalm speaks of a god or goddess whom he
"knew not," it is probable that he is thereby deprecating the wrath of some offended deity with whose name he is
unacquainted. 1 A hymn to the creator calls upon him
J A fragment from the great medical work (M. 1101, Obv. 3 — 14), in which the patient is allowed his choice of a practitioner's receipt or

under his various names to direct the laws of the world,
to raise the dead to life, to overthrow the wicked and
hostile, and to guide the stars of heaven, and puts into the mouth of Ea the following words : "Since his name
has made his offspring strong, let his name be Ea even
as mine is; all the bonds of my laws may he carry (to
them) ; all my secret wisdom may he bear away, through
the fifty names of the great gods." After this, it is said, his hearers " pronounced his fifty names and wrote down
his precepts." 1 As "the great gods" were fifty in number,- the ascription of their fifty names to the creator
was equivalent to identifying him with all of them.
When they lost their names, they lost their individual
personality as well.
Closely connected with the mystical importance thus assigned to names was the awe and dread with which
the curse or excommunication was regarded. Once uttered
with the appropriate ceremonies, the binding of knots and the invocation of divine names, it was a spell which
even the gods were powerless to resist. In Assyrian it
a charm, makes this pretty clear. The whole passage runs : " Cut up
some eyebright (?), the slice of a bird, the tongue of a dog, the plant that grows in the plain, the flesh of the claslum, and the golden Jcakis
of the sheep (Jcakis lunum khuratsi, a species of grebe, according to Houghton), and compound these six ingredients: (or make a kludesitiya of herbs, offer beer, and repeat a spell seven times to the heart :) drink the mixture in wine ; continue drinking (it) for three days, and on the fourth day your health will be restored. (This is) the spell :
' Thou,

' The god, whoever he is, who like a road has determined

was called the mamit, in Accadian the sabba} and was
naturally considered to be divine. In Accadian, Mami
had been a goddess ;
2 the borrowed Assyrian deity, there
fore, assumed the Semitic feminine termination. In the
tenth book of the Epic of Gisdhubar, the goddess Mam
metu, as her name is there spelt, is called "the maker of
fate" who "has fixed the destinies" of mankind, "along
with" the spirits of the earth ;
" she has established death
and life, but the days of death are unknown." 3
Mamit thus bore a striking resemblance to the Fate
of the Eomans and the Ate of the Greeks. Like Ate,
her operations were usually conceived of as evil. Just as
Xamtar, the plague-demon, was also the personification
of doom and destiny, so too Mamit was emphatically
the concrete curse. If she established life as well as
death, it was only because the term of life is fixed by
death ; death, and not life, was the real sphere of her
work. Hence the mamit was known among the Acca
dians as the (nam-) erima or "hostile doom;" and though
Ami. as we have seen, might as the pole-star be called
" the mamit of heaven," it is in no friendly guise that the
mamit is presented to us in the magical texts. It was,
1 In Sumerian, iagga, from an earlier saiigua, perhaps connected with ianga, "a bond,

special class of priests, "attached," like the Levites, to particular sanctuaries, took their name from ianga.
- W. A. I. ii. 51, 55, " Mami the queen." "The river of Mami the
queen" seems to have been near Cutha, since both it and " the river of the companion of Mami" come between "the river of the fortress of Nergal" and "the river of the place of ascent of Laz." In K220, Obv.
27, the goddess Mjamiti is mentioned immediately before Nin-gur, "the
lady of the abyss."

in fact, like the power of excommunication in the Middle
Ages, the most terrible weapon that could be used by the
priestly exorcist. For the power of invoking the aid of
the goddess Mamit by pronouncing the curse was com
pletely in his hands. All that was needed was the per
formance of certain rites and the repetition of certain
words. Armed with the magic wand, 1 he could lay the
terrible excommunication on the head of his enemy, and
cause it to issue forth from the body of his friend. " Let
the mamit come forth that I may see the light," is one of
the petitions we meet with in the tablets ;
2 and TiglathPileser I. states that after his conquest of the kings of
Xahri he " freed them, prisoners and bound as they were,
in the presence of the Sun-god (his) lord, and made them swear to be his servants from henceforth and for ever,
under pain of the curse [mamit) of (his) great gods." 3
In the hymns the mamit occupies a conspicuous place. Thus we read :
" The river-god is bright like the digger of the ground. The curse (flies) before him ; its cry (is) like that of a demon. 4 All the land glows like the height of the sunset-horizon. May the sun at his rising
remove the darkness, and may there never be gloom in the house. May
the curse go forth to the desert, to a pure place. spirit of heaven,
conjure the curse; spirit of earth, conjure it ! — The formula for undoing the curse when the water of the river surrounds a man." 5

rising sun, to " place the point (gir) of the reed of the free-will offerings
and the reed of the priests {qan ninddbi qan urugalli), the implements (unut) of the gods as many as exist, the implements of the sons of the

themselves from the demoniac agencies that surrounded
them. The power of the mamit was such that the gods
themselves could not transgress it, and the mamit Avas
accordingly invoked to protect the mortal from the demons
of plague and sickness. But the plague itself might be
regarded as a mamit or " doom" inflicted by heaven upon
the guilty earth. Such is the view taken in the following
fragment, which I once compared with the Biblical account
of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Perhaps
the doom of Sennacherib's host may furnish a closer
parallel :
:
" A darkness came from the middle of the deep, The doom des(cended) from the midst of the heaven,
The sword (mowed down) the earth like grass ; Towards the four winds the flash (went) overthrowing like fire.

hold a very consistent theory about the origin of disease.
On the one hand, all sickness was ascribed to demoniacal
possession; the demon had been eaten with the food, or
drunk with the water, or breathed in with the air, and
until he could be expelled there was no chance of recovery.
But, on the other hand, a pestilence, an epidemic, which
swept over a whole country, was regarded with the same feelings of awe-struck veneration as the greater
gods themselves. It was believed to be an instrument
in their hands for punishing the sins and shortcomings
of mankind. As we shall see, the same theory was held
by the authors of the penitential psalms in respect of maladies that attacked some single individual only ; but
it was the general persuasion when a wide-reaching cala
mity like a plague afflicted the country. The plague consequently was held to be a divine being who was sent
by the gods, like the storm or the deluge, to take ven
geance on men for their misdeeds.
But this plague-god could be viewed under two aspects.
Under the older one he was Xamtar, the plague-demon,
who was the minister of the gods of the lower world and
the arbiter of human fate. In Semitic times the minister
of divine anger approached more nearly the Jewish con
ception of the angel of death. He was himself a god,
and had under his command not only the " seven gods,"
but also a special messenger, Isum or Itak, " the street
traverser." 1 Isum was represented by the colossi which

given. Like the seven evil spirits, Isum was regarded as having the form of a whirlwind.

stood at the approach to a temple; 1 his master's name
was Nerra (Nera), who, as we have seen, was one and
the same as Nergal, the god of the dead Nerra, "the
warrior of the gods," as he is termed, appears in an old
legend, first brought to light by Mr. George Smith, as bringing death and desolation upon the states of Ba
bylonia, apparently in consequence of their evil-doing.
" Ami had heard" the report of the seven gods who had,
perhaps, been sent to investigate what was going on upon the earth. Accordingly he summoned Nerra ;
" Let thy
hands march," he said, "since the inhabitants of the
country have seditiously broken their bond ;

set thy heart to cause desolation ;

people of the black heads unto death with the desolation (?)

Babylon is one of the first cities to feel the destroying
sword of the Chaldaean angel of death. It is besieged by
its foes, and during the siege, the sword, the famine and
the plague are let loose in its streets. Mul-lil is repre

doom (?), warrior Nerra. Thou didst leave one and go forth against another. The form of a dog dost thou assume and enterest into tho palace. The people saw thee ; their weapons were broken. The heart
of the high-priest, the avenger of Babylon, is full of valour ; when he
urged on his troops to take the spoil of the enemy, before the people lie has done wickedness. In the city to which I shall send thee thou
shalt fear no man, shalt reverence none ; small and great slay together,
and leave not the youngest of the evil race. Thou shalt spoil the first
that come to Babylon, the people of the king which is gathered together and entered into the city, shaking the bow and setting up the
spear, auxiliaries who have transgressed against Ann and Dagon ; thou shalt set up their weapons ; like the waters of the storm shalt thou give
their corpses to the open places of the city ; thou shalt open their trea
sures (1) and bid the river carry them away." 1
Merodacli mourned over the doom pronounced against
his city, and apparently with some effect ; for after a good
many broken and lost lines, the tablet goes on to describe
the despatch of the terrible plague-god to Erech, " the seat
of Anu and Istar, the city of the choirs of the festival
makers and consecrated maidens of Istar," who " dreaded
death," for the nomad 'Suti of the desert had combined
against their state. The eunuch-priests were now com
pelled to bow the face before another deity than the
peaceful Istar, who " cried and was troubled over the
city of Erech." Eventually, however, Nerra was "quieted"
by " Isum his councillor, the illustrious god who goes
before him," " and the warrior Nerra spake thus :
' Sca
iand against sea -land, 'Sumasti against 'Sumasti, the
Assyrian against the Assyrian, the Elamite against the
Elamitb, the KossaDan against the Kosseean, the Kurd
against the Kurd, the Lullubite against the Lullubite,
country against country, house against house, man against

man, brother against brother, let them destroy one another, and afterwards let the Aeeadian come and slay them all,
and fall upon their breasts.' : The warrior Nerra (further)
addresses a speech to Isinn, who goes before him :
' Go, Isnm, incline all thy heart to the word thou hast spoken.'
(Then) Isum sets his face towards the land of the west ;
the seven warrior gods, unequalled, sweep (all things) away behind him. At the land of Phoenicia, at the
mountains, the warrior arrived; he lifted up the hand, he laid it on the mountain ; the mountain of Phoenicia
he counted as his own soil."
In thus marching to the west, the minister of the Ba
bylonian god of death approaches the country in which
another angel of pestilence was seen by the king of
Israel. " By the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite," David had beheld the angel of the Lord " stretching out
his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it." As in Babylon,
so too in Israel, the plague had been a visitation for the
sins of man. It was the instrument of God's anger
wielded by the hands of his angel- minister. That same
angel-minister had once before stood before Balaam, and
with a drawn sword in his hand had threatened the Syrian
prophet with death. He was not a demon from the
lower world, like the old Chaldaean plague-spirit Xamtar ;
he was not the inexorable law of destiny, before whom
even the gods had to submit their wills ; but a member
of the celestial hierarchy, the messenger of a beneficent
God. He came to destroy, but it was to destroy the
guilty. The sins of man, and not the malevolence or
passionless law of a supernatural being, brought death

and suffering into the world. The Babylonian legend of
Nerra, like the records of the Old Testament, tells the
same tale as the Babylonian story of the Deluge. So remarkable an agreement, on the one hand, between
the religious conceptions of Semitic Babylonia and Israel, and, on the other, their equally remarkable contrast to
the older Accadian doctrines embodied in the plague
demon Xamtar and Mamit the goddess of fate, can be
explained in only one way. Even if the fact stood alone,
and we had no knowledge of the earlier history of
Chaldsea, we should be forced to conclude that while the
later population of Babylonia belonged to the same race
as that which inhabited Palestine, it was essentially dif
ferent from the race which had formulated the older
beliefs. The Semitic belief, in fact, stands out in striking
contrast to beliefs which betrayed no consciousness of
human sin, and the necessity of finding in this an ex
planation of malevolent action on the part of the gods
above. The difference between the plague-god of Cutha
and the agencies which had once been imagined to work
evil to mankind, is a difference that cannot be bridged
over by any theory of development; it is necessarily due to a difference of race.

THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALD^A.
To Francois Lenormant, whose untimely death was
an irreparable loss to the progress of Assyrian research,
belongs the merit of first describing and defining the sacred books of ancient Babylonia. With the keenness
of perception that characterised him, he pointed out two
main collections of Babylonian sacred texts ; one contain
ing magic incantations and exorcisms; the other, hymns
to the gods. The magical texts obviously belong to an
earlier and less advanced stage of religious belief than
the hymns ; they presuppose, in fact, a sort of Shamanism, according to which each object and power of nature
has its zi or "spirit," which can be propitiated only
by a sorcerer-priest and certain magical rites ; while the
hymns, on the other hand, introduce us to a world of
gods, and their language from time to time approaches a
high level of spiritual expression. The collection of hymns Lenormant very happily named the Chaldtean
Rig-Veda, and to them he subsequently added a third
collection, consisting of penitential psalms which in many respects resemble the psalms of the Old Testament. All
three collections are generally composed in both Accadian
and Semitic Babylonian, the Semitic Babylonian being a translation of the presumably older Accadian text which



316 LECTURE V.
is written line by line above it. It was natural to sup
pose that what has happened in the case of other sacred
books happened also in Babylonia ; that the magical texts
were first collected together, the collection subsequently
acquiring a sacred character ; and that a similar process
rook place in the case of the hymns. The whole work
would have been complete before the culture and literature
of the Accadians were handed on to the Semites : in this
way the preservation of the Accadian originals would be accounted for, the very words of the primitive documents
and their correct pronunciation having come to be looked
upon as sacred and inspired ; while the Semitic interlinear
translation served, like the Aramaic Targums of the Old
Testament, to assist the priests in understanding the
object of their recitations. As time went on, the reli
gious beliefs which underlay the magical texts became
so far remoA'ed from those of a later age that the texts
themselves gradually passed into the background, the collection of hymns taking more and more their place as
pre-eminently the Babylonian Bible. The theory as thus stated is at once simple and pro
bable. But although in its main outlines it is no doubt
correct, further research has shown that its simplicity is
due to the imperfection of the materials upon which
Lenormant had to work, and that it will have to be very
considerably modified before all the facts now known to
us are accounted for.
In the first place, there are numerous magical texts
which are later, and not older, than man}* of the hymns.
Xothing is more common than to find a magical text
breaking off into a hymn or a fragment of a hymn the
recitation of which forms part of the spell or ceremony.



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALDJEA. 317
A largo number of the hymns that have come down to
us arc thus embedded in the magical documents of which
they form an integral part. The hymn to the seven
evil spirits, for instance, quoted in a former Lecture, is
really a portion of one of the most famous of the magical
texts. In such instances there can be no question that
the hymn is older than the text in which it is found.
Moreover, it is difficult to distinguish the hymns when used in this way from similar poetical addresses to divine
beings, which, so far from being especially sacred, were
employed as spells in medical practice.
Thus in a great work on Babylonian medicine, frag
ments of which I have published and explained, 1 receipts for the cure of diseases, which scarcely differ from those
that would be prescribed to-day, are mingled with charms
and spells for driving away the demons of sickness.
The sick man, in fact, was given his choice between a
scientific treatment and a recourse to the old system of
the primitive "medicine-man;" and it was left to his faith
or superstition to determine whether he would employ
the regular practitioner or his spiritual predecessor the exorcist-priest. Thus in the middle of a list of various
medicines, carefully prepared from different ingredients and mixed with date-wine or water, we find an alter
native spell, which the patient was instructed to "place
on the big toe of the left foot," and there cause it to
remain. The spell was as follows :
"0 wind, my mother, wind, wind, ruler of the gods art thou, wind
among the storm-gods !

318 LECTURE V.
Yea, thou makest the water 1 to stream down (tutsitsa), and with
the gods thy brothers liftest up the stream (etsits) of thy wisdom."
Xow these two verses are introduced by a word which
was read en in Accadian, siptu in Assyrian, and had the meaning of "spell" or "incantation." The same word
introduces also a certain number of the hymns to the
gods, and thus throws light on the object of their quota
tion and use. They were, in fact, spells, and the sacred
ness with which they were invested was due to the fact
that they were so. 2
We now have an explanation of two further facts
which would otherwise be puzzling. On the one hand,
by the side of the hymns to the gods there exist texts
which agree with the hymns in form and character, but
differ from them in being addressed, like the medical
spell 1 have just quoted, to an inferior order of super
natural beings. On the other hand, the place of a hymn
may be taken by a legendary poem or a portion of a
legendary poem. The transformation of the god Zu into
a bird, which I cited in the last Lecture, is an example of
this. If the legendary poem had to do with the divine
powers who were to be invoked or whose wrath had to
be deprecated, its use as a spell was as efficacious as
that of a hymn. Our own folk-lore shows that nothing
comes amiss to the inventor of popular spells ; the Lord's
Prayer or a verse from the Bible are as serviceable in
1 Literally, " the urine," which indicates the object of the spell.
2 The hymns to the Sun-god of Sippara, composed by Semitic priests, form, however, an exception to this rule. The introductory word sipfat with them merely means "to be recited," its old signification having come in time to fake this meaning upon itself.



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CIIALDJLA. 319
curing disease or in removing the curse of a witch as the
most time-honoured combination of unintelligible words.
The relation between the magical texts and the hymns
of ancient Babylonia is now, therefore, clear. In many
cases, at least, the hymns formed part of the magical texts; they were the mystical incantations around the
recitation of which the rites prescribed in the texts were
intended to revolve. The magical text was not complete
without the repetition of a form of words as well as a
direct appeal to the names of certain supernatural beings ;
and the form of words was in many instances furnished
by hymns to the gods or analogous kinds of composition.
It is not only the magical texts, however, in which we
find the hymns embedded and prefaced by the significant word svptu, "incantation." They are still more nume
rous in the ritual texts —in the texts, that is to say, which
describe the religious ceremonies the Babylonian was
called upon to perform. These ceremonies had for the
most part the same end and object as the magical texts ;
they were not so much a communion with the deities of
heaven, as an attempt to compel them by particular rites .and words to relieve the worshipper from trouble, or to
bestow upon him some benefit. Divine worship, in short,
was a performance rather than an act of devotion, and
upon the correctness of the performance depended entirely
its efficacy. The mispronunciation of a single word, the omission to tie a knot at the right moment, would inva
lidate the whole ceremony and render its repetition neces
sary. The ritual, therefore, was a sort of acted magic,
and it is consequently not surprising that the hymns should play the same part in it as they did in the incan
tations of the magical texts.



320 LECTURE V.
It follows from all this that many of the magical texts
are, like the ritual texts, later than many of the hymns.
The fact must necessarily introduce some modification
into Lenormant's theory of the origin of the sacred books
of Chahhea.
In the second place, not only the hymns, but even the
magical texts are at times composed in Semitic Baby
lonian only. There is no trace of an Accadian original
of any kind whatever. And not only is this the case,
but these purely Semitic hymns occasionally glide into what is neither more nor less than unadulterated magic.
Here is a specimen of one, which begins with an address
to the Sun-god full of deep feeling and exalted thought, and finally passes into an incantation equally full of dull
bathos and debasing superstition :
1
" Sun-god, king of heaven and earth, director of things above
and below, O Sun-god, thou that clothest the dead with life, delivered by thy
hands, Judge unbribed, director of mankind, the mercy is supreme of him who is the lord over difficulty (pit
namratsit), bidding son and offspring to come forth, light of the world, creator of all thy universe, the Sun-god art thou !
Sun-god, when the ban {inamit) for many days is bound behind me and there is no deliverer,
expulsion of the evil and of the sickness of the flesh is brought
about (by thee) ; among mankind, the flock of the god Xer, whatever be their
names, he selects me :
1 S 949, Obv. The upper part of the tablet is lost. All that remains
of it are the two last lines : " He clothes with life, and to the blessed hands of my god and my goddess for grace and life entrust me." Then comes a line of separation, and the hymn to Samas is introduced by the
word siptu.

1 Kari ; so in W. A. I. iv. 7,4: " the incantation is laid as a scourge
(Mru) upon his back." The Accadian equivalent was luba (sometimes
written with the determinative prefix al, W. A. I. v. 16. 24, 2-5), which is also translated by the Assyrian sidhtum (Heb. shndh). Sadi was
another Accado-Sumerian equivalent (iv. 1, 42). The word is expressed
ideographically ("cord-hand-cutting," and "cutting cord") in v. 14. 54, 55, where we also find mention of "the scourge," sa ina tabqirtt
nadu, "which is used in penal examination" (Heb. biqqoreth). The
ideographic equivalent of the latter is " rope-length (sarda)-makmg." Bappu is further the Assyrian rendering of the ideographic compounds
"rope-skin-cutting" and " rope-hand-cutting "
(v. 14. 57, 58).



322 LECTURE V.
Here the hymn to the Sun-god is made a vehicle for
removing the ban or " curse" that has fallen on the sick
man. The beliefs which produced the magical texts
must still have been active, although the hymn belongs
to a late period of Babylonian history ; the old doctrine
of an inexorable fate, even if degraded into a belief in
the witch's art, still existed along with the worship of a
god who restored the dead to life and was "supreme in
mercy to those that were in trouble." We have only to
turn to our modern newspapers to discover how slowly
such primaeval beliefs die out, and how long they may
linger among the uneducated and superstitious by the
side of the most exalted faiths and the mightiest triumphs
of inductive science. The fact that one text is magical,
while another contains a hymn to the deity, does not of
itself prove the relative ages of the two documents.
Then, thirdly, it has become increasingly manifest that a good many of the so-called Accadian texts are not
Accadian in their origin. As I pointed out several years
ago, 1 the old Accado-Sumerian language was learned by
the Semitic Babylonians as Latin was learned b}' the medi
aeval monks, and for much the same reasons. It was the
language of the oldest sacred texts ; it was also the early
language of law ; and both priests and lawyers were
accordingly interested in its preservation and use. What
happened to Latin in the Middle Ages had already hap
pened to Accadian in Babylonia. The monks spoke and
wrote in a language which was Latin indeed, but which
had lost its classical purity ; monkish Latin was full of
modern words and idioms, and its grammar was not
1 Babylonian Literature, pp. 64, 71, 72.



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALDJEA. 323
always scrupulously accurate. On the other haud, it contributed multitudes of words, and even forms of
expression, to the languages of every-day life that were spoken around it, and the words were frequently modified
to suit the pronunciation and genius of the languages that borrowed them, just as the modern words which monkish
Latin had itself adopted were furnished with classical
terminations and construed in a classical fashion. The
case was precisely the same in ancient Chaldeea. Here,
too, there was a monkish Accadian, both spoken and
written, some of which would have shocked the Accadian
speakers of an earlier age. The literati of the court
of Sargon of Accad had been partly Accadian, partly Semitic ; the Accadian scribes wrote and spoke Semitic,
the Semitic scribes wrote and spoke Accadian. The
result was necessarily a large amount of lending and
borrowing upon both sides, and the growth of an arti
ficial literary language which maintained its ground
for centuries. The way for the rise of this artificial
dialect had already been prepared by the long contact
there had been between the two chief languages of primi
tive Chaldasa. When two languages thus exist side by
side —like Welsh, for example, by the side of English
they will borrow one from another, the language of superior culture and organisation being that which exerts the
greatest influence. The pupils will imitate the speech of
their masters in art and science even if, as in the case of
Greece and Rome, the masters in art and science are the
subjects in political power.
From a very early epoch, therefore, possibly before the
separation of the Semitic family, the old agglutinative dialects of Chaldsea had been influencing their Semitic
y2



324 LECTURE y.
neighbours. The work carried on at the court of Sargon
was accordingly but a continuation of an older process.
But it was distinguished from the older process in two
ways. It was the work of cultivated men, working upon
literary models with a definite object in view. It was,
moreover, a work that was carried on under Semitic
patronage and supremacy, with the necessary result that in the new artificial language the influence of Semitic
thought and speech upon the decaying speech of preSemitic Accad tended constantly to become greater. Tin1
Accadian texts, which were first composed by Semitic
scribes, and subsequently handed down through generations of Semitic copyists, could not fail to show their
origin and history plainly stamped upon their face.
And such is actually the case as regards a good many of* the texts which in the early days of Accadian study
could not be distinguished from the genuine productions of Accadian writers. It was as yet impossible to separate
classical from monkish Accadian ; to determine whether
the Semitic text were a translation of an older Accadian
one, or whether the Accadian was a literary rendering of
a Semitic original. Even now, with all the progress that
lias been made during the last few years in our know
ledge of the pre-Semitic dialects of Chaldgea, it is not
always easy to decide the question. It is not enough to show that the Accadian text contains Semitic words or
idioms. The words may have been introduced by copy
ists ; while what we imagine to be Semitic idioms may
really be imitations of earlier Accadian modes of speech,
borrowed when the ancestors of the Semitic family still
lived together in tkeir tents by the western banks of the
Euphrates. Apart from the monuments of Babylonia



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALDJEA. 325
and Assyria, wo have no records of Semitic speech which
reach back even approximately to that remote epoch
when the dialects which afterwards became the languages
of Assyria, of Aram and of Phoenicia, were still spoken within the limits of a single community, and when that
community was still leading the life of the Bedouin of
to-day. It is always possible that words and forms of
expression which we believe to be distinctively Semitic
may, after; all, have had an Accadian origin ; before this
can be settled, it will be necessary to exhume more
monuments which, like those of Tel-loh, belong to the
pre-Semitic era, and to subject the non-Semitic language in which they are written to a searching examination. 1
Enough now, however, is known about the charac
teristic features of pure and unadulterated Accado-Su
merian to enable us to assign most of the hymns and
magical texts to their true origin, and to determine
whether their parentage is Semitic or Accadian. Not
unfrcquently the conclusions which have been arrived at
on philological grounds are confirmed by the contents of
the texts. Texts which refer to Semitic deities or to
Semitic sanctuaries disclose at once their real age and
source. It is equally impossible to refer to an early date
compositions which breathe a philosophical spirit, or are in accord with the Semitic conceptions of the divine
government of the world. The only question is, to how
1 Arabic is of little assistance in settling the question, since our
knowledge of it is so recent that it is impossible to say in many cases Avhether the lexical and idiomatic points of agreement between it and the North Semitic languages may not be due to borrowing. Aramaean tribes have lived in immediate proximity to the original speakers of Arabic from very early times, and must have lent many words, if not
idioms, to their neighbours.



o26 LECTURE V.
late a period such compositions belong ; whether, foi example, the account of the Creation in clays, which
bears so curious a resemblance to the first chapter of
Genesis, goes back to the epoch of Khammuragas, or is,
as I believe, a product of the age of Assur-bani-pal. But even when we have determined the relative date
and origin of a particular composition, our difficulties are by no means over. An ancient literature like that of
Babylonia must necessarily contain comparatively little that is original. Most of the works that have come down
to us are based on older literary productions, and are
often mere centos of earlier compositions. The great
Epic of Gisdhubar is little more in its present form than
a redaction of earlier poems relating to the Herakles of
Ereeh. It is full of episodes like that of the Deluge,
which have no very close connection with the main
subject of the work. And the episode itself may be
pieced together out of more than one earlier poem. Thus
the story of the Deluge shows clear traces of having been
compounded out of at least two older narratives, in one
of which the catastrophe was ascribed to the Sun-god, in
the other to Bel (Mul-lil). The Descent of Istar into
Hades, again, begins with a description of the infernal world, which, with a few slight differences of expression,
is found again in the sixth book of the Epic ; a com
parison of the two passages goes to show that the authors
of both have alike copied the description from an earlier
source. The Descent of Istar, indeed, abounds with pas
sages which are plainly borrowed from other poems, and
whose richly poetical language stands out in marked
contrast to the dull and prosaic character of their setting;
while its coin-hiding lines have little connection with



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CIIALD2EA. 327
what precedes them, and are obviously an extract from
a separate work. The authors of the penitential psalms
are fond of adding to their productions a litany of varying length, in which the names of certain divinities are in
voked ; the litany was a common possession which existed
in an independent form, and had been handed down from
an early period. Even the hymns are sometimes put
together out of older materials, like certain of the Old
Testament psalms ; not only do the same phrases and
lines recur, but whole passages as well. It is the same
with the magical texts. Here, too, we have repetitions
and borrowing ; here, too, we have older fragments incor
porated into later texts.
It will be seen from this how much remains to be
done before the sacred books of ancient Babylonia can
be made fully to tell their tale, and to wdiat an extent
the first theory about their origin and history must
require modification. In its main outlines, nevertheless,
the theory first sketched by the brilliant insight of
Lenormant still continues true ; it is only in its details
that it needs correction and improvement.
The magical texts formed the earliest sacred literature
of Chakhea. This fact remains unshaken. They reach
back to a period when the Semitic conception of a
supreme Baal wras utterly unknown—when, indeed, there
was no definite conception of a god at all. The " crea
ting" deity of later Accadian belief had not yet emerged
from the religious consciousness of the Chaldsean. The
inhabitant of Babylonia was as yet in the purely Shaman
istic stage of religious development. The world about
him was peopled by supernatural powers, each of which
was to him a ei or " spirit." But it was not a spirit in



328 LECTURE V.
our sense of the word, nor in the sense in which the
term was used by the Semitic scribes of a later da3r .
The zi was simply that which manifested life, and the
test of the manifestation of life was movement. Every
thing that moved, or seemed to move, was endowed with
life, for only in this way could primitive man explain the fact. He himself moved and acted because he had
life ; life, therefore, was the cause of movement. Hence
the objects and forces of nature were all assigned a si
or spirit. The arrow that flew through the air, the
stone that struck and injured, the heavenly bodies, that
moved across the sky, the fire that blazed up from the
ground devouring all that fell in its way, had all alike
their spirits. The spirits were as innumerable as the
objects and forces which surrounded the Chaldrean, and
as mysterious and invisible as his own spirit or life.
In this phase of faith the moral element was wholly
wanting. The Chaldtean had not yet entered the Garden
of Eden, and eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good
and evil. The visible things of nature may benefit or
injure ; but their benefits and injuries seem altogether
capricious and accidental, entirely independent of the actions and thoughts of man. The same stone which has
killed a man to-day may help to build his son's house
to-morrow ; the fire which scorches to death Avill also
cook the food to sustain life. In each event, all seems
determined by blind chance ; the spirits of nature may
live and move, but they have no passions, no emotions.
If their invisible spirits are to be influenced, it must be
by other means than appeals to their love, their anger,
their jealousy or their pride.
Shamanism accordingly implies, not a priesthood, but



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALD.EA. 329
a body of "medicine-men," or exorcists, who know the
spells whereby the spirits of nature can be compelled
either to cease from injuring or to ill-treat the foe.
Whether the medicine-men of primaeval Chaldsea had to
undergo any initiatory course of training, or whether
the profession were open to all alike, we do not know ;
our records do not reach back to the remote period of
pure Shamanism, the magical texts being merely survivals which in their present form belong to a later time.
It is this class of exorcists, however, which distin
guishes the early Shamanism of Chaldsea from what Dr.
Tylor has termed simple Animism. Shamanism, is, in
fact, organised Animism ; Animism controlled and regu
lated by a body of exorcists who take the place of the
priesthood of a higher cult. It was doubtless the exist
ence of disease which first called this body of exorcists
into being. The prevention and cure of disease is the main
object of the magical texts and incantations. Disease
was looked upon, as it still is in many parts of the uncivi
lized world, as possession by a malevolent spirit. Just as
an external wound might be caused by a piece of stone
or metal, so it was inferred an internal malady must be
caused by an invisible agent of a similar kind—that is,
by the spirit of the stone or metal. The same means
that were adapted for getting rid of the visible stone and
metal would be suitable for getting rid of their invisible
spirits. There is no evidence to show that the exorcists
of Chalda?a ever professed to extract pieces of actual
stone or metal from the body of the sick, like the medi
cine-men of Australia or America ; but they claimed by
their spells to expel the spirits which enabled these pieces
of stone and metal to afflict and injure. Listen, for

The exorcisms for driving away the spirits of disease
gradually introduced a moral element into the character
of the old spirits of nature. But the moral element was
wholly on the dark side. The spirits of disease were
essentially evil and malevolent. In so far as human
passions could be ascribed to them, the passions were those
' of the wicked, not of the good. The worship of the spirits of nature thus tended to become a religion of fear.
Side by side, however, with the growing belief in the
malevolence of the spirits of nature, there existed the



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALDyEA. 331
totemism of which I have spoken in the last Lecture.
Animals, as well as other objects, had each their special
spirit, and these spirits naturally shared the feelings and passions which moved the animals to which they
belonged. The sacred animals were regarded as moral
agents, like men; the ox. whose labours benefited mankind,
protected his worshipper from the attacks of evil ; while
the fish which supplied the inhabitants of Eridu with
food, also brought to them the elements of culture and
civilisation. In this way the Shamanism of earlier and
ruder times began to pass into a higher form of creed ;
the exorcist approximated more and more to the priest,
and the spells he used tended to recognise the distinction
between good and evil in the world of spirits as well as
in the world of men.
It was at this point that cosmogonic speculations first exercised an influence upon the religion of the Chaldrean
states. The Babylonian began to generalise and to sum
up his individual impressions of outward phenomena in
wider and more abstract ideas. Earth and heaven took
the place of the individual objects and forces whose
sphere of action was in the one or the other ; the spirits
of these separate phenomena were subordinated to the
spirits of the earth and the sky. The stereotyped con
clusion of the old Accadian exorcism, as we have just
heard, is, " Conjure, spirit of heaven ! conjure, spirit of earth!" The earth out of whose bosom the agricultu
rist received the bounties of life, the heavens from which
the fertilising rain and dew dropped upon the ground, and the rays of the sun warmed all nature into activity,
became the supreme powers whose spirits dominated
over all others and demanded the reverence of man.



332 LECTURE V.
Unlike the malevolent spirits of disease, the great cosmo
gonic spirits were essentially beneficent ; the moral con
ceptions of Chahhean faith were enlarged by the belief in
the existence of good as well as of evil spirits, and the
superiority of the good to the evil. It was an immense
step in advance, and it corresponds with the time when the
religious literature of Babylonia first commences with the
oldest surviving magical texts. The earliest portions of
the latter belong to the age when the crude Shamanism of
the past had been tempered and modified by the first
beginnings of a theory of the world. From this point onward we can trace the further de
velopment of the older creed. The struggle between
good and evil had already begun in the mind of the
Chaldeean thinker. The supernatural beings he wor
shipped were now divided, for the most part, into two
hostile camps. On the one side stood the demons of
disease and nightmare; on the other, the great cosmo
gonic powers of earth and heaven. It is true that the
terrible spirits of disease, who loved the darkness of night
and the solitary places of the wilderness, were not yet
consciously conceived as demons, but the moment was
not far off Avhen such would be the case. Light and
darkness now stood opposed to one another in the spiritual
as well as in the physical world. The old medicine-man
was fast becoming a priest. The introduction of cosmological ideas and speculations
into Chalda?an religion brought with it two results. First
of all, there grew out of it the conception of creating
gods. We have already had occasion to observe the
essential distinction that existed between the Accadian
and Semitic conceptions of the universe : with the one,



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALD.JIA. 333
all things were made ; with the other, they were begotten. The Semitic Baal was a father ; the Accadian divinity a
creator. According to the Semite, the heavens and the
earth were carved out of a pre-existent chaos ; according
to the Accadian, the heavens and the earth were them
selves primordial powers, maintaining an eternal struggle
with the chaos of darkness and anarchy. The temporary
triumph of chaos means the irruption of anarchy into
the fair order of nature—the destructive hurricane, the
devastating tempest, the darkening eclipse. The return
of light and sunshine, of bright skies and germinating
seeds, marks the victory gained over the encroaching forces of the lower world.
The earth and the sky became the first creators, the
first gods. It is they who create all the good things
which man enjoys below, including man himself. The
spirit of the earth and the spirit of the heaven thus de
veloped into creating gods. But it was before the old
habits of thought and expression could be quite eradicated
from the Chaldsean mind. The spirits which had de
veloped into gods were themselves provided with spirits ;
there was a spirit of Ea and Dav-kina, of Ana and Mul
lil, as well as of water and earth, of heaven and hell.
When the gods took upon them human shape, these
spirits were regarded as similar to the spirits of indi
vidual men ; and the functions and attributes of the
human spirit were reflected upon the spirits of the gods.
At the outset, however, it was with the animal and not
with the human world that the new gods were associated.
They were, in fact, confounded with the old totems. Just
as the heavenly bodies, which seemed to move of their



334 LECTURE Y.
own accord like living beings, were identified with the
sacred animals, so too the spirits of earth and heaven,
of water and air, to whom a creative power had hem
given, were similarly identified with them. The god
was a beast before he became a man, and the spirit that
moved him was that of the brute.
In the second place, the deification of the spirits of
earth and heaven necessarily brought with it the deifica
tion of other spirits which resembled them in character
and power. The test of supernatnralism—-of the exist
ence of a spirit—was the power of movement possessed
by an object or a force of nature ; this power now
became itself the supernatural being, the god or spirit.
The spirit of the moon, for example, developed into a god ; but the god was abstracted from the visible moon
itself, and identified with the creative force of the lunar
orb Avhich manifested itself in motion. The new god
might in turn be abstracted from the creative force, more
especially if he were assimilated to the sacred steer; in
this case the creative force would become his spirit, in
no way differing, it will be seen, from the spirit that was believed to reside in man.
We have now reached the culminating point of the
old Accadian religion. Spirits innumerable still exist,
but they are controlled and overawed by creative gods.
The gods represent the order and law of the universe
embodied by the sabba, or " fate," to which even the gods
themselves must submit. Over against them are the
malevolent spirits of disease, of chaos and of darkness ;
while beside them arc oilier spirits which still retain
their primitive character of moral indifference, neither



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALDJRA. 335
good nor bad, though some might approximate more to the gDod and others to the bad. But gods and spirits
alike were amenable to the spells and exorcisms used by
the sorcerer-priest, for a priest he had now become. By his magical words he could remove the sickness which
was caused by demoniac possession, or bewitch the person
and the property of his enemy ; he could compel the
gods to listen to his petition and to perform his com
mands. In his hands and on his lips was the power of
the terrible sabba, which even the gods were forced to
obey. The sorcerer was still the intermediary between
mankind and the spiritual world.
But, as I have just said, he had lost much of his old
character. Among the spells he employed were hymns which imply a more advanced cult than that of mere
magic. Indeed, the very conception of a creative deity
necessarily brought with it a service of praise and adora
tion and the formation of a fixed ritual. A beneficent
god required another kind of worship than that which
was appropriate to the non-moral spirits of Shamanism.
When the spirit of heaven became Ami, temples were
raised in his honour, and the worshippers who entered
them required something else than that the priest should
" conjure" the object of his cult. We leave the era
which witnessed the rise of the magical texts, and enter
on the era of the hymns.
The Penitential Psalms, of which I shall speak further
on, frequently have a sort of litany attached to them,
written in Accadian only, and invoking the aid of certain
deities under their pre-Semitic names or titles. The
litanv was an old heirloom, selections from which were
taken by the authors of the psalms and added to their



336 LECTURE V.
compositions. One of those translated by Br. Zimmera 1
concludes as follows :
" my god, the lord of prayer, may my prayer address thee !
my goddess, the lady of supplication, may my supplication address thee ! Mato (M&tu), the lord of the mountain, may my prayer address thee !
Gubarra, lady of Eden, may my prayer address thee ! lord of heaven and earth, lord of Eridu, may my supplication address thee !
Merodach (Asar-mulu-duga), lord of Tin-tir (Babylon), may my prayer address thee !
wife of him, (the princely offspring (?) of heaven and) earth, may my supplication address thee !
O (messenger of the spirit) of the god who proclaims (the good name), may my prayer address thee !
(bride, first-born of) Uras(?), may my supplication address thee ! (lady, who binds the hostile (?) mouth), may my prayer address thee !
O (exalted one, the great goddess, my lady Nana), may my supplication address thee !
May it say to thee : '(Direct thine eye kindly unto me).* May it say to thee :
' (Turn thy face kindly to me).' (May it say to thee :
' Let thy heart rest.') (May it say to thee : 'Let thy liver be quieted.') (May it say to thee : 'Let thy heart, like the heart of a mother
who has borne children, be gladdened.') ('As a mother who has borne children, as a father who has begot*
ten a child, let it be gladdened')."
The litany belongs to a period considerably later than that which witnessed the rise and first collection of the
magical texts. It is written in the Accadian dialect of
north Babylonia, which exhibits the old Sumerian of the
south in an advanced stage of decay, and further shows
traces of contact with a Semitic language. The deities
• From Haupt's Alckadische Keihschrifttexte, pp. 116 sq.



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALD/EA. 337
whose names are invoked belong to different parts of
Babylonia, and point to a time when not only the separate
states of ChakUea had begun to recognise a common pan
theon, but when northern and southern Babylonia had
already been united into a single empire. Nevertheless, the litany is earlier than the age of Sargon of Accad and
the supremacy of the Semitic population. Though Mero
dach has already migrated from Eridu to Babylon, still
referred to under its old Accadian name of Din-Tir, the
Sun-god \)i Sippara and Accad is altogether unknown. There is no allusion to either city or to the divinities
they adored. Nana herself, the queen of Erech, is not
yet known as Istar, and the Tasmit of a later day is
" the bridal goddess, the first-born of Uras."
"We are still, therefore, lingering on the verge of the
pre-Semitic epoch. The Semite may be in the land, but
the official religion does not as yet recognise him. The
difference, however, between the religious ideas of the litany and those which inspired the old magical texts is
immense. A whole age of religious development lies between them. The fundamental conception of the pre
ceding period, it is true, still survives ; the deities must
be influenced by the spoken word of their worshipper.
But the spoken word has ceased to be the spell or incan
tation ; it has become a prayer and supplication. Its
efficacy depends no longer on the exorcisms of a medicine
man, but on the faithful petitions of the worshipper himself. And along with this change in the nature of
the cult has gone a corresponding change in the divine beings to whom the cult is dedicated. They have become
gods, bound together in a common brotherhood, like the
brotherhood of the cities over whose fortunes they preside.
z



338 LEC1T-HE V.
Babylonia possesses not only gods; it possesses a pantheon, an Olympus, as well.
It was, of course, only among the more cultivated
classes that this newer and higher conception of the divine
government of the world was likely to be found. The
masses, doubtless, still clung to their old superstitions, their old Shamanism. The formation of magical texts,
therefore, never ceased. The older texts continued to be
interpolated until their antiquity at last threw such a halo
of holiness around them that it was considered impious
to tamper with their words. Other texts of a similar
character were composed, which in course of time came
to receive as much reverence as the more ancient collec
tion. Far down into Semitic times, exorcisms and incan
tations continued to be written, and to receive the impri
matur of the official priesthood. They even entered largely
into the ritual of the temples. But the sanctity attached
to them became fainter and fainter as years went on.
Although the sorcerer maintained his ground among the
uneducated multitude, like the witch in modern times,
the spells with which he served himself were simply
means for curing the bite of a scorpion, and such-like
necessities of popular medicine. They were dissociated
from the worship of the gods and degraded to vulgar uses. Even in medicine the cultivated Babylonian gen
tlemen preferred to employ the drugs prescribed by
scientific practitioners ; the spells were left to the igno
rant and superstitious. The old collections of magical
texts, indeed, remained among the sacred books of the
nation; but this was on account of their antiquity, and
not because they any longer expressed the religious
feelings of the day. The litany at the end of the peniten



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALD.EA. 839
tial psalms marks the beginning of a new era in religious
thought. This era is represented by the hymns to the gods. Dr. Hommel has pointed out that the hymns fall into two main
classes. There arc, firstly, the hymns which show no
trace of contact with the magical texts, and, secondly, other
hymns which are either partly magical in character or else
are introduced by the significant word en (siptn\ "incan
tation." These latter hymns emanate for the most part
from Eridu and its neighbourhood, and bring Merodach
before us as carrying out the behests of his father Ea for
the good of man. Most of them, moreover, are dedicated
to those older divinities who, like Gibil the fire-god, were
eclipsed by the more human deities of the later cult.
But the division must not be pressed too far. The intro
ductory en, "incantation," merely indicates that the hymn
is of sufficiently early date to be incorporated in a magical text, or that it was selected as a spell, like the Lord's
Prayer or the fragments of Latin which have served the
same object in modern times. It is of importance, how
ever, to observe whether the hymn is of a semi-magical
character, like that to the Fire-god which I have quoted
in a former Lecture, or whether it was originally alto
gether independent of the use to which it has been put.
In the first case, we may confidently assign it to the period
when Eridu was still the religious capital of Chaldfea,
and the faith of the people was only emerging out of its
earlier Shamanistic phase. In the other case, where the
hymn itself is free from all taint of magic and Shamanistic
superstition, we may as confidently ascribe it to a later
date. Its precise age will depend upon that of the text
in which it is embodied. If the latter is one of those
z2



o 40 LECTURE V.
late survivals which proved how deer ly rooted the belief
in magic and witchcraft wras among the lower strata of the
population, the hymn or fragment of the hymn which is
incorporated in it may be of almost any period. To determine its age more exactly, we must have recourse to the
language in which it is written and the other indications
of date it may contain. Sometimes these may point to an
early epoch, at other times to a comparatively recent one.
The hymns to the Sun-god of Sippara afford a fixed
point of departure for settling the relative antiquity of
the hymns. They form a separate class by themselves, and were part of the daily service performed by the
priests in the temple of Samas. It is plain, therefore,
that they had been collected for liturgical use, and had
been invested with a sacred character. There were
hymns that had to be recited at sunrise and sunset, or
on the special festivals held in honour of the god. The
individual hymns had doubtless been composed on dif
ferent occasions and at different times, and it is possible
that they had been revised and altered more than once
before they were put together as a single whole. But
whatever may have been the respective ages of the indi
vidual hymns, they were all alike of Semitic origin.
They all belong to the epoch when Sippara and Accad were ruled by Semitic princes, and were a centre and
focus of Semitic influence. It is true that the hymns
are provided with an Accadian text, which is followed,
line by line, by the Semitic rendering, as is the case with
the other bilingual texts of early date. But it is equally
true that the Accadian text is really a translation of the
Semitic. It may hav* been made by Accadian scribes;
it may have been made, and more probably was made,



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALD.EA. 341
by Semitic scribes, like the Accadian texts which ema
nated from the library of Assur-bani-pal ; but it is not
original. The Semitic words and idioms it contains beai
witness to its secondary character. There is only one
period in the history of Sippara, of which we know, to which such a work is attributable. This is the age of
Sargon and his son Naram-Sin. The pre-Semitic epoch
of northern Babylonia was but just passing away ; the sacred texts, the hymns to the gods, the older incanta
tions, were all in the agglutinative language of the first inhabitants of the country. Though the ancient Sun-god
of Sippara had become the Semitic Samas, it was natural
to suppose that he would be better pleased with the lan
guage in which the spirits and deities of Chaldsea had
been addressed than with the vulgar speech of every-day
life. Like the monk of the Middle Ages, accordingly,
who composed his prayers and hymns in Latin, the priest of Samas addressed his god in the older and more sacred
tongue. The sentiment, the expression, might be Semitic, but the form in which it must be clothed before it could
be acceptable to the divinity was Accadian.
In a later age there was no longer the same strong
motive for assimilating the hymns to the Sun- god to
those addressed to the more purely Accadian deities of
Babylonia. The Semitic language became first literary and then a fit vehicle of devotion. Not only were magical
texts written in it, but hymns also, without any endeavour
to render them into the obsolete Accadian. Assur-bani
pal, antiquarian as he was, thinks it no sin to publish hymns to Xebo and Samas in Semitic only, and the in
vocations addressed to the gods by Nebuchadnezzar and
his successors are in the same Semitic language as the



•)42 LECTURE V.
rest of their inscriptions. The translation of the hymns
to Samas into Accadian presupposes a time when the
Accadian influence was still powerful, and when Accadian
was still believed to be the language of the gods.
If, then, we can assign the hymns to Samas of Sippara
to the age of Sargon of Accad, it becomes more easy to
find an approximate date for the hymns to the other
great gods of Babylonia. Like the hymns to Samas, we must suppose them to have belonged to different col
lections employed liturgically in the chief temples of
( 'hahhea. We know, indeed, that this was the case as
regards the hymns addressed to Bel-Merodach of Babylon.
AVith few exceptions they are bilingual, in Accadian and Semitic ; and in the larger number of them the Accadian
text is the original. Where this is the case, and the
hymns belong to the sanctuaries of northern Babylonia,
we may consider them older than the age of Sargon. As
the ancient language of the country continued to be
spoken in southern Babylonia long after his time, the same conclusion cannot be drawn in regard to the hymns
employed there, but it is probable that the majority of them are quite as early as those of the north.
How far they have come down to us in their original
condition and form it is hard to say. In some instances
we can shew that they have been modified and interpo
lated, and analogy would lead us to suppose that such
was generally the case. Nor is it possible to determine
at present whether the collections of sacred hymns used
in the different temples of Babylonia were formed into a
single whole, and thus constituted a sort of Babylonian
Rig-Yeda, as Lenormant conjectured. It is very probable, however, that the unification of the country brought with



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALDJEA. 343
it a unification of the sacred books used in its several
temples, and that the copies of the hymns we possess
were not made by the scribes of Assur-bani-pal from
the hymn-books of different sanctuaries, but from a com
mon hymn-book in which the special collections had been
grouped together. At the same time, if such a common hymn-book ever
existed, it must have contained selections only from the
hymn-books of the individual sanctuaries. One of the
few hymns to ISTergal, for instance, which we possess, was, we are told, copied from the service-book of Cutha, 1
and this is by no means an isolated example of the kind.
On the other hand, the hymns—or more usually the
fragments of hymns — which are incorporated in the
magical texts, perhaps imply the existence of a sacred volume which was in common use among the priestly
schools of Babylonia. This is a point which it must be
left to future research to decide.
But Avhether or not such an authorised collection of
hymns existed for the whole of Chalcbea, it is certain
that a considerable number of the hymns were composed
when the chief cities of Babylonia and their presiding
deities had been, as it Avere, confederated together. The
matter is, indeed, complicated by our ignorance of the extent to which the hymns have been altered and inter
polated before their present text Avas finally fixed ; on
the whole, however, it seems pretty evident that Ana, Mul-lil and Ea, had already been linked together in a
divine brotherhood, and that the other "great gods"
had been assigned their places in a common pantheon,
1 K5268, Rev. 12.



344 LECTURE y.
before a considerable proportion of the hymns had been
composed. A distinct advance had thus been made
beyond the religious conceptions of the litany of the
penitential psalms ; not only are the gods of different cities invoked side by side, but they are now connected
together in the bonds of a single family. The family
system, in fact, has taken the place of a system of mere co-ordination.
Xow the family system implies an entire change in the conception of the gods themselves. They cease to
be creators; they become fathers and children. Along
with this change necessarily goes another. The gods become human. The last vestiges of primitive totemism
fade away, and Merodach is no longer "the bull of
light," the son of " the antelope of the deep," but an
anthropomorphic god, standing in the same relation to Ea that a human son stands to his human father. Baby
lonian religion had long been tending to regard the gods as supernatural men ; the introduction of the family
relation completed the work.
The work, however, in its final form bears clear marks
of artificiality. The whole family system, in which the deities of different states are each given a definite posi
tion, must have been deliberately built up. Family
relationships may grow up naturally among the divinities worshipped in the same locality or in the colonies sent
out by a mother- state ; where these relationships are
found existing among divinities, originally independent and each adored as supreme in its own primitive seat of
worship, they must belong to an artificial system, and
be the product of intentional arrangement. Keligion, in
the hands of its official representatives in Chaldaea, had



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALD.EA. 345
not only passed out of the sphere of simple and spon
taneous belief, it had become organised and reflective
a subject to be discussed and analysed, to be arranged and methodised.
Can all this have been the natural and uninterrupted
development of the old pre-Semitic Shamanism ? With
Francois Lenormant, I think not. Between the religion
of the magical texts, of the earlier semi-magical hymns and of the litanies on the one side, and the religion of
the later hymns on the other, there seems to me to be
an almost impassable gulf, which can be bridged over
only by the assumption of an intrusive foreign element.
What this element must have been Ave know already.
The Semitic nomads of the western desert in the days
of their barbarism had come into contact with the cul
tured kingdoms and people of the valley of the Euphrates.
At first they were content to be pupils ; eventually they became masters themselves. The amalgamation of the
two races produced the Babylonian population of later times, and along with it the history, the civilisation and
the religion of a subsequent era. Berossos expressly notes that Babylonia was the home of different races ; he might
have added that it was the home also of different faiths.
The Semite sat at the feet of his Accadian Gamaliel
when the crude Shamanism of the latter had passed into
a higher phase of religion, and the creator-gods had been evolved out of the spirits of the earlier creed. He adopted
the gods, but at the same time he adapted them to his
own notions concerning the divine government of the
world. They became Baalim, so many manifestations of
the supreme deity whose children we are, and who exhi
bits himself to us in the solar energy. The old goddesses,



346 LECTURE V.
with the exception of Istar, sank to the rank of Ash
taroth and "mistresses of the gods," mere companions
and doubles of the male divinity.
Now, as I have already tried to point out, the keystone of Semitic belief was the generative character of
the deity. A language which divided nonns into mascu
lines and feminines, found it difficult to conceive of a deity
which was not masculine and feminine too. The divine
hierarchy was necessarily regarded as a family, at the head of which stood tk father Bel." If the gods of Accad
were to he worshipped by the Semite, they must first
conform to the requirements of his religious conceptions, and allow themselves to be grouped together as members
of a single family. All that stood outside the family
were servants and slaves—the hosts of heaven and earth
who performed the behests of their masters, and carried
the messages of Baal to all parts of the universe. The
rest of the supernatural world, if such existed, was rele
gated to the domain of the enemy ; it comprised the
empire of chaos and night, which., like the gods of foreign nations, might at times invade the realms of the Baalim,
only, however, to be beaten back once more into the
outer darkness. The empire of chaos, however, was
really a stranger to genuine Semitic belief; it was a legacy left by the Accadians, which was assimilated and
adapted by the Semites as best they could. Where the
Semitic faith existed in its full purity, Satan, the adver
sary, himself was but an angel and minister of the Lord,
and the supreme god was the creator alike of good and
evil, of light and darkness.
The rise of Sun-worship at Sippara, the prominence
given to the solar element in Babylonian religion gene



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALDiEA. 347
rally, the obliteration of the older gods whose attributes
could not be harmonised with those of a Sun-god, and
the identification of deity after deity with the solar Baal,
was again the result of the introduction of Semitic ideas
into the religion of Chakhica. Perhaps the most striking
transformation ever undergone by any object of religious faith was the conversion of Mul-lil, the lord of the ghost
world, into a Bel or Baal, the god of light and life.
Such a transformation could not have been produced
naturally ; it needed the grafting of new religious con
ceptions upon an older cult ; it is a sudden change, not
a development.
Equally hard to explain, except by calling in the aid
of a foreign religious element, is the degradation of the
spirits of the primitive faith into demons. We have
traced the process whereby certain of these spirits deve
loped into deities, while others of them were invested
with a distinctly malevolent character ; but they are not
yet demons. The evil spirits who brought disease or
caused eclipse might be the brood of chaos, and therefore
hostile to the gods of light ; but they were all the subjects
of Mul-lil, and even of the- sorcerer and the medicine
man. It was the necessitv the Semite was under of
accommodating his beliefs to the doctrine of an empire
of chaos that turned them into veritable demons, work
ing for evil against the gods in a world of evil of their
own. Persian dualism was no new thing in Babylonia ;
the gods of good and the spirits of evil had been struggling there one against the other since the remote days of
Sargon of Accad. 1

348 LECTURE V.
In what precedes I have, of course, been describing
only the official religion of Babylonia, as it is known to
us from the sacred literature of the country. It was
the religion of the upper classes, of the priesthood and of the court. What the mass of the people may have be
lieved, and how far they may have participated in the
official cult, we can only guess. The later magical texts
and incantations were condescensions to their necessities
and superstitions, like the legends of the gods which
formed the subject-matter of popular poetry. The differences that exist to-day between the creed of a Spanish
peasant and that of a scientific savant are not greater
than those which existed in Babylonia of old between
the religion of the multitude and that of the school which
resolved the divinities of the popular theology into forms
of the one supreme god. The magical texts and hymns were not the only sacred
books possessed by the Babylonians. There was yet a
third class of sacred literature—those penitential psalms
to which I have so often alluded. The litany frequently
attached to them belongs, as we have seen, to the pre
Semitic epoch, though it has been altered from time to
time in later ages. The litany, however, is not written, like the magical texts and the majority of the hymns, in
the Sumerian dialect of the south, but in the Accadian
of the north. Dr. Hommel is perfectly right in calling
the Accadian of the north neo-Sumerian ; it represents
the Sumerian of the early texts in an advanced stage of
powers who establish the ban,"— " the sins of my father and my mother
I saw not ([sajabi-ya ti ummi-ya khidati id amra) . . . from darkness I stepped forth and (became) the soldier of Samas" (nltu edhuti utsav-va

decay. But this does not prove that it was spoken at a
later period thaii the Sumerian of the south, or that it is
the direct descendant of the latter dialect. There were
several dialects of the Aceadian or pre-Semitie language
of Chaldsea ; one of these gave rise to the Aceadian of
northern Babylonia at a time when the Sumerian dialect
in the south still preserved its pristine purity. What hastened the decay of the northern dialect was its contact
with Semitic. The Semites established themselves in
the northern part of the country long before they settled
in the south. The kingdom of Sargon rose and waned
at Accad more than a thousand years before Sumerian
dynasties ceased to rule in the southern cities. It is not
strange, therefore, if the Aceadian of the north decayed
long before its sister dialect of Eridu, borrowing at the
same time Semitic words and modes of expression. It
is in this Aceadian of the north that the penitential
psalms are written. They belong neither to the same age
nor to the same cit}T . But they are all distinguished by
the same characteristics, which lend to them a striking resemblance to the Psalms of the Old Testament. Let us
take one, for example, which has been preserved to us in
a fairly complete condition :

indicates its antiquity. The expression "whom I know not" means "whose name I know not." The author of the psalm is uncertain aa

Its repetition ensures my peace. 2 Like its original copied and published : palace of Assur-bani-pal,

It is only necessary to read the psalm to see in it
distinct traces of contact on the part of the Accadians
with Semitic thought. The god cannot be addressed
alone ; the goddess necessarily stands at his side. The
introspection, moreover, which the psalm reveals is hardly
reconcilable with the religions conceptions presupposed
by the magical texts and the earlier hymns. The con
sciousness of sin is a new feature in Chaldsean religion,
and belongs to the age that saw the rise of poems like
that on the Deluge, which ascribed the sufferings of man
kind to their wrong-doing. Hitherto the evil that existed
in the world had not been given a moral significance.
It was due to the action of malevolent spirits or the
decrees of inexorable fate rather than to the wickedness
of man, and it was removed by spells and ceremonies
which occasioned the interference of the god of wisdom
and his son Merodach. At most, it was considered a
punishment for offences against the divine order of the

see ii. 35, 36, dri = tanittu, "exaltation"). '-' This is the conclusion of the original Accadian colophon. Th» next line is in Assyrian, and was added by the scribes of Assui-bani

world, like the punishments inflicted by human judges for disobedience to the laws. Unassisted by intercourse
with Semitic belief, Accadian religion never advanced
beyond the idea of vicarious punishment, which grew
out of the doctrine of primitive society that demands an
eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. It is a doctrine
that lies at the root of the institution of sacrifice, and it
marks the high tide of Accadian faith before the Semite
appeared upon the stage. Along with these indications of Semitic influence,
however, the psalm bears equally clear evidence of its
Accadian origin. The consciousness of sin is still but
rudimentary ; the psalmist knows that one of the gods is
angry with him because he is suffering pain. He has
eaten what has been cursed by heaven, or else has un
wittingly trampled on the forbidden thing. In the
language of the Polynesians, he has touched what is
tabooed, and the curse of heaven accordingly falls upon
him. Even when he speaks of his transgressions, he falls
into the language of the old magical texts ; his sins are
seven times seven, that mystical number which was so
closely connected with the spirits of earth. The belief
in the mysterious power of names, moreover, is still strong upon him. In fear lest the deity he has offended
should not be named at all, or else be named incorrectly,
he does not venture to enumerate the gods, but classes
them under the comprehensive title of the divinities with
whose names he is acquainted and those of whose names
he is ignorant. It is the same when he refers to the
human race. Here, again, the ancient superstition about
words shows itself plainly. If he alludes to mankind, it
2a

is to a mankind as many as pronounce a name," as many, that is. as have names which may be pronounced.
We must, then, regard the penitential psalms as originating in the Accadian epoch, but at a time when the
Accadian population was already profoundly influenced by Semitic ideas. This agrees well with the language
and contents of the psalms themselves. They all belong
to northern Babylonia, more especially to Erech and
Nipur. But there is no reference in them to Sippara
and its Sun-god, no trace of acquaintanceship with the empire of Sargon. It would therefore seem that they
mount back to an earlier date than the rise of the city of
Accad, and may consequently be placed midway between the older hymns and those which were composed in
honour of the Sun-god.
But just as the sacred hymns were constantly added
to, new hymns being introduced into the ancient collec
tions perhaps as late as the time of Assur-bani-pal, so;
too, the number of the penitential psalms was increased
from time to time. At first the additions were in Acca
dian; afterwards they were written in Semitic only,
the character of the psalm being at the same time con
siderably changed. "Vain repetitions" were avoided, and the psalm was more and more assimilated in form to
a prayer; on the other hand, forms of expression were
borrowed from the semi-magical hymns of Eridu, and
a stronger element of superstition gradually entered into
the composition of it. Here, for example, is a fragment which I have elsewhere termed a prayer after a bad
dream, but which Dr. Zimmern, perhaps more correctly, would entitle a psalm. The tablet which contains it is



THE SACRED TtOOKS OF CHALD.EA. 355
broken, the beginning and end of the prayer or psalm
being consequently lost. 1
" my god who art violent (against me), receive (my supplication). my goddess, thou who art fierce (towards me), accept (my prayer). Accept my prayer, (may thy liver be quieted).
my lord, long- suffering (and) merciful, (may thy heart be ap

May the seven winds carry aAvay my groaning. May I strip off my evil so that the bird bear (it) up to heaven.
May the fish carry away my trouble, may the river bear (it) along. May the reptile of the field receive (it) from me ; may the waters
of the river cleanse me as they flow.
Make me shine like a mask of gold.
May I be precious in thy sight as a goblet (1) of glass. Burn up (?) my evil, knit together 3 my life ; bind together thy altar that I may set up thine image.
Let me pass from my evil, and let me be kept with thee. Enlighten me and let me dream a favourable dream.
May the dream that I dream be favourable ; may the dream that
I dream be established.

May Makhir the god of dreams rest upon my head.

of life.
To Merodach, the merciful, to blessedness, to prospering hands, entrust me.
Let me exalt thy greatness, let me magnify thy divinity. Let the men of my city honour thy mighty deeds."
The psalm or prayer, it will be seen, was composed
by a native of Babylon, and probably formed part of the

356 LECTURE V.
ritual used in the service of the great temple of Mero
dach. In any case it could hardly have been included
in the old collection of penitential psalms. These were
written in Accadian, and it is not probable that any were
admitted among them whose language showed plainly
their more recent date. Assur-bani-pal informs us 1 that
after putting down the rebellion of his brother, the
viceroy of Babylonia, he "pacified the angry gods and
wrathful goddesses with a public prayer (takribti) and a
penitential psalm, restoring and establishing in peace
their festivals, which had been discontinued, as they were in former days." As the word for penitential psalm
is expressed by the compound ideograph which served to denote it in Accadian, it is possible that on the occa
sion in question a psalm was selected from the ancient
collection ; but it is also possible that a new psalm was
composed specially for the event. That such special compositions were not unusual among
the Assyrians of Assur-bani-pal's days, is proved by a hymn or prayer on behalf of the king which the compiler
of a list of the gods in the chief temples of Assyria has
added to his catalogue. It seems to have been intended
for use in one of them. Where the text first becomes
legible, the hymn reads as follows :
2
;t Joy of heart, production of purity, production of enlightenment (siikalUmtu), the explanation of what is revealed and concealed (?),

men who pronounce these prayers may the land of the silver sky, 1 oil
unceasing and the wine of blessedness, be their food, and a good noontide 2 their light. Health to my body and prosperity is my prayer to the gods who dwell in the land of Assyria."
This prayer introduces us to a subject without a dis
cussion of Avhich no description of a religion can be com
plete. What were the views about a future life enter
tained by the Babylonians and Assyrians? Was their religion intended for this world only, to avoid evil here
and to live happily, or did they look forward to a world
beyond the grave, with joys and miseries of its own ?
The reference to "the land of the silver sky" in the
prayer I have just cited would seem to show that Assy
rian religion was neither a faith which, like that of the
Buddhist, hoped for the annihilation of consciousness,
nor yet a faith which, like that of the Greeks of old,
saw in the future nothing but a dreary existence in a
sunless world, a passage from the world of light and
life to the darkness and the night.
But this conclusion would not be in accordance with
the testimony of the older texts. The incantations and
exorcisms, the semi-magical hymns of Eridu, limit the horizon of their view to the present life. The spirits
1 We may compare with this expression a phrase in a small fragment (R 528) which runs : "At dawn a hymn (khir) before Samas .... four
hymns to Ea the pure god of the land of the (silver 1) sky .... (beginning with) the incantation : The pure seat."
2 Kiriru, allied to htmru, rendered an-izi, " divine fire," in W. A. I.
iv. 15. 18, 19, where we read, " in the noon-tides of day and night" (i.e. the dead of night). In W. A. I. ii. 47, 61, an-izi is translated urru,
" full day," and in iii. 55. 49, 50, as Jensen points out, we have the
four periods of the day enumerated : " On the nineteenth day enter in
the morning the presence of Bahu, at noon (an-izi) the presence of the supreme god, in the afternoon the presence of Iiimmon and in the
evening the presence of Istar."

witl] whom they people the universe are to be dreaded
or praised by the living only. The pains man seeks to remove, the blessings he asks for, all cease with death.
There is little or no trace of any thought of a world
beyond. In the hymns, it is true, Merodach, the benefactor of the human race, is described as raising the dead
to life, but the life to which they arc raised is the life of
the present world. Whatever might have been the sense
afterwards attached to the expression, in the early hymns
it means nothing more than a belief in the power of
spells to restore the dead to life. The recovery of the
sick was considered in no way more wonderful than a
recovery from a state of trance or from death itself ; if
the god of wisdom and magic could effect the one, he
could equally effect the other.
I do not deny that the primitive Chaldeean may have
believed in the continuation of existence after death.
The belief in a Mul-lil, a lord of the ghost- world, presupposes this. The lost friends who returned to him in
his dreams would have assured him that they had not
vanished utterly. But I can find no traces of ancestor
worship in the early literature of Chahhea which has
survived to us. Whatever views the Chakhean may have
entertained about the ghost-world, they were vague and
shadowy ; it was a subterranean region, inhabited for the
most part by spirits who were not the spirits of the dead,
but of the objects of nature. They were typified by the
spirits of earth, and were all the subjects of Mul-lil.
The ghost-world of Mpur lay beneath the earth. It
was here that the golden throne of the Aniinas, the
spirits of earth, was erected, hard by the waters of life
which they were appointed to guard. When the cult



THE SACRED KOOKS OF CHALDyEA. 359
of Nipur and the cult of Eridu were united into one,
this underground region was necessarily connected with the great ocean-stream which encircled the earth. Here
accordingly was placed the home of the Aniinas, and it became the entrance to the realm of Hades. As
primitive Accadian geography, however, identified the Euphrates and the Persian Gulf with the ocean-stream,
the approach to Hades passed into Datilla, the river of
death ;
l and Xisuthros, the hero of the Deluge, was trans
lated to dwell among the gods beyond the mouth of the
Euphrates. 2 This was the land set apart for the im
mortal deities in the belief of the people of Eridu, for
their gods were gods of the sea whose waters washed
their shore. The unification of the creeds of Nipur and
Eridu thus brought with it an identification of the ghost
world with the world of Ea, of the empire of Mul-lil
with the deep over which Ea ruled. The world of the
ghosts and the world of the gods were accordingly con
founded together, the distinction between them being
that whereas the ghosts were still left in their subter
ranean abodes, Mul-lil was elevated to the world above,
there to dwell with Ea and his son Merodach, the god of
light. But this upper world of the gods was immediately above the world of the ghosts, and was in fact the passage
into it.
This theological geography is perfectly incompatible
1 W. A. I. ii. G2, 50. "The ship of the river Datilla is the ship of
the Lady of life and death."
? The story here preserves a feature of the original myth. In the time of the composition of the poem, the seat of the gods was regarded as being in heaven, so that the author of the Gisdhubar epic, Sindiqiuunini, has admitted a contradiction into his narrative.



360 LECTURE V.
with another theory of the abode of the gods, which
placed it on the summit of Kharsag-kurkiira, " the moun
tain of the world." This mountain of the world is de
clared by Sargon to be the mountain of Arallu or Hades :
" The gods Ea, Sin, Samas, Eimmon, Adar and their august wives, who were truly born in the midst of the
temple of Kharsag-kurkiira, the mountain of Arallu, have
excellently founded glistering sanctuaries and well
wrought shrines in the city of Dur-Sargon." 1 Famous
temples were named after it, in Assyria at all events,
and its site was sought in the mountainous region of the
north -west. An old geographical table tells us that
Arallu was the land or mountain of gold, 2 a statement
which reminds us of the words of Job (xxxvii. 22), " Out
of the north cometh gold," as well as of the Greek legend
of the griffins who guarded the hidden gold in the distant
north. We find an allusion to the Babylonian myth in
the 14th chapter of Isaiah (ver. 13). There the Baby
lonian monarch is described as having said in his heart :
" I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above
the stars of El ; I will sit also upon the mount of the
assembly (of the gods), in the extremities of the north ;
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds ; I will be
like the Most High." Here, in this Chaldrean Olympos,
the gods were imagined to have been born and to have
their scats ; its summit was hidden by the clouds, and
the starry firmament seemed to rest upon it. It is pos
sible that it was identified, at any rate in later times,
with the mountain on which the ark of the Chaldtean

Noah rested, " the mountain of Nizir," the modern Eo
wandiz. Rowandiz towers high above its fellows in the
Kurdish ranges, and the Babylonian might well believe
that its peak had never been ascended by mortal man.
If Xisuthros had touched the sacred soil with his ship,
he was qualified by the very fact to take his place amid
" the assembly of the gods." "The mountain of the world" was peculiarly sacred
among the Assyrians. Perhaps their nearer proximity to the great mountainous chains of the north-west, and
their distance from the sea, had made them more ready
to adopt the belief which placed the home of the gods
in the mountains of the north than beside the waters of
the Persian Gulf. It is difficult to tell in what part of
Babylonia the belief first arose. If Kharsag-kalama, " the
mountain of mankind," the name given to the tower of
the chief temple of Kis, is the same as " the mountain of
the world," we might discover its cradle in the neigh
bourhood of Babylon. It will be remembered that in
the hymn to the Fire-god the seven spirits of earth are
declared to have been born in " the mountain of the sun
set," and to have grown up "in the mountain of the sun
rise." Here the sun is distinctly regarded as rising and setting behind a mountain; and since there were no moun
tains on the western side of the Babylonian plain, we must
consider the poet to have looked upon the mountain
behind which the sun rose and set as one and the same. 1
During the hours of darkness the Sun-god must have

of Babylonia. He may, however, have lived after the Babylonians had become acquainted with Palestine, and "the mountain of the sunset" may therefore be the mountainous land of Dhidhi or Phoenicia.

been supposed to have journeyed underneath the earth,
traversing, it maybe, the realms of Hades on his way.
Whether this mountain, which thus fringed, as it were,
the sides of the earth, can be connected with " the moun
tain of the world," I cannot say. In any case, by the
side of a belief in a subterranean Hades and a paradise of
the gods beyond the mouth of the Euphrates, there was
also a belief in a Hades and a paradise which were esta
blished on the loftiest of the mountains of the north.
A bilingual Babylonian hymn, which appears to have been connected with Nipur relates to the latter belief.
It is thus that it begins :
:
"0 mighty mountain of Mul-lil, Im-kharsag (the mountain sky), whose head rivals the heavens ; the pure deep has been laid as its foundation.
Among the mountains it lies like a strong wild bull.
Its horns glisten like the splendour of the Sun-god. Like the star of heaven that proclaims (the day) it is full of glit
tering rays. The mighty mother Nin-lilli (the lady of the ghost-world), the reverence 2 of E-Sava (the temple of the hosts of heaven), the
glory 2 of E-Kura (the temple of the hosts of earth), the adorn
ment of E-Giguna (the temple of the city of darkness), the
heart of E-Ki-gusiira (the temple of the land of light)."
In this hymn the world-tree of Eridu, whose roots were
planted in the deep, has made way for a world-mountain, with its head reaching unto heaven like the tower of
Babel, and its feet planted upon the deep. As the con
ception of the world-tree belonged to Sumir or southern

THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHA.LD2EA. 3G
Babylonia, so the conception of the world-mountain
belongs to Accad or northern Babylonia ; it is expressly termed the mountain of Mul-lil, and is identified with
Nin-lil, the " reverence of E-Sara," whose son was the
Sun-god Adar. It is at least noticeable that one of the
hymns to the Sun-god which originated at Sippara begins
by declaring that he "rose from the mighty mountain," "from the mountain of the stream," "the place of the
destinies." 1
The introduction of an Olympos into Babylonian mytho
logy must necessarily have modified the conception of the Chalda?an Hades, more especially when we find that
Mul-lil, the lord of the ghost-world, was himself asso
ciated with it. The world of the gods was separated
from the abode of the dead ; the latter remained below,
while the gods who had once presided there ascended to
the upper world. Their places were taken by the god
Irkalla and the goddess Allat, originally mere forms of
Mul-lil and Nin-lil, but now distinguished from the Bel
and Beltis into whom Mul-lil and Nin-lil had been trans
formed. The addition of the sky-god of Erech to the
common pantheon of Babylonia still further tended to
divide the two worlds. The Olympos became a ladder
1 W.A.I v. 51, 1 — 6. Can "the mountain of the stream" have any reference to Gen. ii. 10 ? This mountain of the sun is described in the second column of the ninth tablet of the Epic of Gisdhubar (Haupt,
Bahylonische Nimrodepos) :
" When he arrived at the twin (mdsi)
mountains, where day by day they guard the rising (and setting of the sun), their crown (touched) the massy vanlt of heaven, below their foot
ing reached to (kasdat) Hades; scorpion-men guard its gate, whose terribleness is dread and their appearance death ; the greatness of their splendour overthrows the forests. At the rising of the sun and the
setting of the sun they guard the Sun-god, and when Qisdhubar saw them, fear and dread took possession of his face."



3(54 LECTURE V.
to the heavens in which the visible deities of light
Samas, Sin and Istar—ruled over the visible firmament,
while the other gods dwelt in a yet more remote region
of the universe, " the heaven of Ann."
This is the point at which the religious development of Babylonian belief had arrived when the majority of
the legendary poems—or at least the older portions of
them—were composed. Hades is still the gloomy realm
beneath the earth, where the spirits of the dead flit about
in darkness, with dust and mud for their food and drink,
and from whence they escape at times to feed on the
blood of the living. Here the shades of the great heroes
of old sit each on his throne, crowned and terrible, rising
up only to greet the coming among them of one like unto
themselves. The passage to these subterranean abodes
is through the seven gates of the world, each guarded
by its porter, who admits the dead, stripping him of his
apparel, but never allowing him to pass through them again to the upper world. Good and bad, heroes and
plebeians, are alike condemned to this dreary lot ; a state
of future rewards and punishments is as yet undreamed
of ; moral responsibility ends with death. Hades is a land
of forgetfulncss and of darkness, where the good and evil deeds of this life are remembered no more ; and its occu
pants are mere shadows of the men who once existed, and
whose consciousness is like the consciousness of the
spectral figures in a fleeting dream. The Hades of the
Babylonian legends closely resembles the Hades of the Homeric poems.
But side by side with this pitiful picture of the world
beyond the grave, there were the beginnings of higher
and nobler ideas. In the Epic of Gisdhubar, the ghost of



THE SACRED BOOKS OF CHALDiEA. 865
Ea-bani is described as rising like a dust-cloud from the
earth and mounting up to heaven, where he lives among
the gods, gazing on the deeds that are done below.
" On a couch he reclines and pure water he drinks. He who is slain
in battle, thou seest and I see. His father and his mother (support)
his head ; his wife addresses the corpse. His body in the field (is placed) ; thou seest and I see. His ghost in the earth is uncovered ;
of his ghost he has no overnight ; thou seest and I see. The food at the edge of the tomb is bewitched (l) ; the food which is thrown into
the street he eats."
Ea-bani, however, was half a god. Gisdhubar, too, who seems to be associated with him in his future lot.
was half divine. If while E-bani and Gisdhubar were
thus permitted to

On the hills, like gods together, careless of mankind,"
the other heroes of ancient renown, Xer and Etana, were
relegated to the shades below, it was because Ner had
once been Nergal, the prince of the infernal world, and
Etana seems to be the Titan of BOrossos who made war
against Kronos or Ea. But when the semi-human heroes
of epic song had thus been permitted to enter heaven, it could not be long before a similar permission was extended
to heroes who were wholly human. Little by little, as
the conception of the gods and their dwelling-place became
spiritualized, "the mountain of the world" passing first
into the sky and then into the invisible " heaven of Ami,"
the conception of the future condition of mankind became
spiritualised also. The doctrine of the immortality of the
conscious soul began to dawn upon the Babylonian mind, and along with it necessarily went the doctrine of rewards
and punishments for the actions committed in the flesh.
The Babylonian was already familiar with the idea of
sacrifice for sin and of vicarious punishment ; all that



365 LECTURE V.
remained was to enlarge the horizon of his faith, and to
extend his belief in the divine awards for piety and sin
to the life beyond the grave. The prayer I quoted just uow from the compiler of the list of the gods in the
Assyrian temples, proves that some at least of the Assyro
I3abylonian people asked their deities for something more
than merely temporal blessings. They might pray that their monarch should live "a hundred years," 1 but they
prayed also that they themselves might live "for ever"
hereafter in "the land of the silver sky." The world
mountain had followed the fate of the world- tree, and
been consigned to the mythologists and the mythologising poets; even the invisible "heaven of Ann" itself
had vanished into the deep blue of the visible firmament;
above and beyond them all was the true home of the gods
and the spirits of the blest, a home towards which the
smoke of the altar might ascend, but into whose mysteries
none could penetrate till death and the grace of Baal had
freed him from the shackles of the flesh.
1 While 60 was the numerical unit of Accadian literature, the Semitic Assyrians made 100 their standard number. The stereotyped form
of addressing the monarch accordingly was, "A hundred years to the king my lord; may he live to old age; may offspring be multiplied to
the king my lord 1" (K 501, 12—16 ; K 538, 13—16).



Lecture VI.
COSMOGONIES AND ASTEO-THEOLOGY
More than once I have had to allude to the speculations
the Babylonians indulged in regarding the origin of the
world. In an early age these speculations naturally assumed a theological form. As the elements themselves
were regarded as divine, or at any rate as possessed of a
divine spirit, their source and shaping must have been
divine also. They were deities who had formed them
selves into their present order and appearance, or else
they had been so formed by other and superior powers.
In course of time this theological conception became
mythological. The elements themselves ceased to be
divine, but they represented and symbolised divine beings
whose actions produced the existing order of nature.
The mythological conception in turn gave way to another, which saw in the elements inert matter created, begotten
or moulded by the gods. Lastly, schools of philosophy arose which sought to find in matter the original cause
of all things, including even the gods, though they veiled the materialism of their views under a mythological sym
bolism.
Broadly speaking, the cosmological theories of Chaldaea
divide themselves into two main classes, the genealogical
and the creative. According to Accadian ideas, the world



368 LECTURE VI.
was created by the gods ; the Semite saw in it rather a
birth or emanation. A time came, it is true, when the
two sets of ideas were harmonised; and by the assumption
of a chaos which had existed from u the beginning/' and
the further assumption that " the great gods'' had created
the objects we see about us, room was left for the creative
hypothesis, while the belief in the birth of the elements
one out of the other was at the same time stoutly main
tained. The form taken by the combination of the two
ideas will be best seen in the latest product of Assyro
Babyionian cosmogonicai systems, that which describes the creation of the world in a series of days.
First of all, however, let us read the account given by
Berossos of the creation of the world, and professed by
him to be derived from the writings of Oannes, that semi
piseine being who rose out of the waters of the Persian
Gulf to instruct the people of Chakhea in the arts and
sciences of life. It is pretty certain that Berossos had
access to documents which purported to come from the
hand of Oannes or Ea, and consequently to deal with
events which preceded the appearance of man on the
earth. The Chaldsean system of astronomy which Beros
sos translated into Greek was likewise asserted by him
to have been composed by a god, namely Bel ; and the
fragments of the original work which we now possess show that his assertion was correct, inasmuch as the work
bears the title of the Observations of Bel. The inscrip
tions, moreover, expressly inform us that Ea was not only the god of wisdom, but himself an author. "We
learn from a tablet, "with warnings to kings against
injustice," that if the king "decrees according to the
writing of Ea, the great gods will establish him in good



COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY. 369
report and the knowledge of justice." 1 There is, therefore, no reason to doubt the statement of Berossos that
the account of the creation which he gives was extracted
from a document that professed to have been inscribed
by the god of Eridu himself.
" The following is the purport of what he said : There was a time
in which there existed nothing hut darkness and an abyss of waters, wherein resided most hideous beings, which were produced by a twofold principle. There appeared men, some of whom were furnished with two wings, others with four, and with two faces. They had one body, but two heads ; the one that of a man, the other of a woman ; they were likewise in their several organs both male and female. Other human figures were to be seen with the legs and horns of a goat ; some had horses' feet, while others united the hind-quarters of a horse with
the body of a man, resembling in shape the hippocentaurs. Bulls likewise were bred there with the heads of men ; and dogs with four-fold
bodies, terminated in their extremities with the tails of fishes ; horses
also with the heads of dogs ; men, too, and other animals, with the heads and bodies of horses and the tails of fishes. In short, there were
creatures in which were combined the limbs of every species of animal.
In addition to these, there were fishes, reptiles, serpents, with other monstrous animals, Avhich assumed each other's shape and countenance.
Of all which were preserved delineations in the temple of Belos at
Babylon. The person who was supposed to have presided over them was a woman named Omoroka, which in the Chaldasan language is Thalatth
(read Thavatth), which in Greek is interpreted Thalassa (the sea) ; but
according to the most true interpretation it is equivalent to the Moon. All things being in this situation, Belos came and cut the woman asunder, and of one half of her he formed the earth, and of the other half the heavens, and at the same time destroyed the animals within
her (in the abyss). All this was an allegorical description of nature. For, the whole
1 W. A. I. iv. 55. 7, 8. Sipar is literally " a message," but as the
message was in later times a written one, it signifies " a letter" or
"writing." I have translated sitilti (for sitisti), "good report," on the
strength of W. A. 1. v. 17, 4 —7, and the meaning of its ideographic
equivalent, " fatherliness ;" but it may signify " study."

universe consisting of moisture, and animals being continually gene-rated therein, the deity above-mentioned (Belos) cut off bis own head ; upon
which the other gods mixed the blood, as it gushed out, with the eartb, and from thence men were formed. On this account it is that they
are rational, and partake of divine knowledge. This Belos, by whrun they signify Zeus, divided the darkness, and separated the heavens from the earth, and reduced the universe to order. But the recently-created
animals, not being able to bear the light, died. Belos upon this, seeing
a vast space unoccupied, though by nature fruitful, commanded one of the gods to take off his head, and to mix the blood with the earth, and from thence to form other men and animals, which should be capable of bearing the liidit. Belos formed also the stars and the sun and the
moon and the five planets." 1
The account of the cosmological theories of the Baby
lonians thus given by Berossos has not come to us imme
diately from his hand. It was first copied from his book
by Alexander Polyhistor, a native of Asia Minor, who
was a slave at Eome for a short period in the time of
Sulla ; and from Polyhistor it has been embodied in the
works of the Christian writers Eusebios and George the
Synkellos. It is not quite certain, therefore, whether
the whole of the quotation was originally written by
Berossos himself. At all events, it evidently includes
two inconsistent accounts of the creation of the world,
which have been awkwardly fitted on to one another. In
one of them, the composite creatures who filled the watery
chaos, over which Thavatth, the Tiamat or Tiavat of the
inscriptions, presided, were represented as being destroyed by Bel when he cut Thavatth asunder, forming the heavens
out of one portion of her body, and the earth out of the
other. In the second version, the monsters of chaos
perished through the creation of light, and their places were taken by the animals and men produced by the
1 Euseb. dir *». i. 4.



COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY. 371
mixture of the earth with the blood of Bel. What this
blood meant may be gathered from the Phoenician myth
which told how the blood of the sky, mutilated by his
son Kronos or Baal, fell upon the earth in drops of rain
and filled the springs and rivers. It was, in fact, the
fertilising rain. Both versions of the genesis of the universe reported
by Berossos agree not only in the representation of a chaos that existed before the present order of things, but
also in the curious statement that this chaos was peopled
with strange creatures, imperfect first attempts of nature, as it were, to form the animal creation of the present
world. In these chaotic beginnings of animal life we
may see a sort of anticipation of the Darwinian hypo
thesis. At any rate, the Babylonian theory on the subject must have been the source of the similar theory
propounded by the Ionic philosopher Anaximander in the
sixth century before our era. The philosophical systems of the early Greek thinkers of Asia Minor came to them
from Babylonia through the hands of the Phoenicians,
and it is consequently no more astonishing to find Anaxi
mander declaring that men had developed out of the fish
of the sea, than to find his predecessor Thales agreeing
with the priests of Babylonia in holding that all things
have originated from a watery abyss. The fact that Anaximander already knew of the Baby
lonian doctrine shows that it could not have been sug
gested to Bcrossos himself, as we might be tempted to think, by the colossal bulls that guarded the gates, and
the curious monsters depicted on the walls, of the temple
of Bel. And we are now able to carry the belief back
to a period very much earlier than that of Anaximander.

The library of Nineveh contained the copy of a tablet
which, according to its concluding lines, was originally written for the great temple of Nergal at Cutha. 1 The
words of the text are put in the mouth of Nergal the
destroyer, who is represented as sending out the hosts of the ancient brood of chaos to their destruction. Nergal
is identified with Nerra, the plague-god, who smites them
with pestilence, or rather with Ner, the terrible "king
who gives not peace to his country, the shepherd who
grants no favour to his people." 2 We are first told how
the armies of chaos came into existence. "Ona tablet

" Thou, king, priest-ruler, shepherd, or whatever thou art, whom God shall proclaim to govern the kingdom, for thee have I made this tablet, for thee have I written the record-stone; in the city of Cutha, in the

gony (sasur) the mistress of the gods created. In the
midst of the mountains they grew up and became heroes
and increased in number. Seven kings, brethren, ap
peared and begat children. Six thousand in number
were their peoples. The god Banini their father was
king ; their mother was the queen Melili." It was the
subjects and the offspring of these semi-human heroes
whom the god ISTer was deputed to destroy. It is clear that the legend of Cutha agrees with Beros
sos in the main facts, however much it may differ in
details. In both alike, we have a first creation of living
beings, and these beings are of a composite nature, and
the nurselings of Tiamat or Chaos. In both alike, the
whole brood is exterminated by the gods of light. A
curious point in connection with the legend is the descrip
tion of chaos as a time when writing was as yet unknown
and records unkept. Perhaps we may see in this an
allusion to the fact that the Babylonian histories of the
pre-human period were supposed to have been composed
by the gods. The date to which the legend in its present form may
be assigned is difficult to determine. The inscription
is in Semitic only, like the other creation-tablets, and
therefore cannot belong to the pre-Semitic age. It be
longs, moreover, to an epoch when the unification of the
deities of Babylonia had already taken place, and the
circle of "the great gods" was complete. Ea, Istar,
Zamama, Anunit, even Ncbo and " Samas the warrior,"
are all referred to in it. We must therefore place its
composition after the rise not only of the hymns of
Sippara, but also of the celebrity of the Semitic god of
Borsippa. On the other hand, the reference to the pateii



o74 LECTURE VI.
or priest-king in the concluding lines seems to prevent
us from assigning too late a date to the poem. Perhaps
we shall not be far wrong in ascribing it to the era of
Khammuragas. Tiamat or Tiavat, the Thavatth of Berossos, is the
tfhom or " deep " of the Old Testament, and the word is
used in Assyrian, in the contracted form tamtu, to denote
" the deep sea." It was upon the face of the tfhom or
"deep" that " the breath of Elohim " brooded, according
to the first chapter of Genesis. The word is not onlj
Semitic, but, in its cosmological signification, of Semitic origin. It has, however, an Accadian descent. The
belief that the watery abyss was the source of all things
went back to the worshippers of the sea-god Ea at Eridu.
But with them the deep was termed apzu, which a pun
ning etymology afterwards read ab-zu, u the house of
knowledge," wherein Ea, the god of wisdom, was imagined to dwell. The Sumerian abzu was borrowed b)T the Se
mites under the form of apiu. The Sumerians had
endowed it with a spirit, in accordance with the Sha
nanistic faith of early days, and as such had made it the
mother of Ea and of the other gods. But I have already
pointed out in a previous Lecture that the abzu, or deep, of which Ea was lord, was not only the ocean-stream
that surrounded the earth, and upon which the earth
floated, like Delos in Greek myth ; it was also the deep
which rolled above the firmament of heaven, through
whose windows its waters descended in the days of the
deluge. Consequently the mother of Ea was usually known by another name than that of Apzu. She was
Zikum or Zigarum, " the heaven" (W. A. I. ii. 48, 26 ;
50, 27), whom a mythological list describes as " the



COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY. 37 S
mothei that has begotten heaven and earth" (W. A. I.
ii. 54, 18). In the same passage she is declared to be
" the handmaid of the spirit of E-knra," the lower firma
ment or earth ; and with this agrees the statement that
Zikura, a dialectic form of Zigaram, 1 is the earth itself
(W. A. I. ii. 48, 27). But it was not the existing earth
or the existing heaven that was represented by Ziknm ;
she was rather the primordial abyss out of which both
earth and heaven were produced. Possibly an old myth
may have related that she was torn asunder when the
present world was made, the upper half of her becoming the sky and the lower half the earth. This at least is
what we may gather from the story given by Bcrossos.
As far back as the days of the priest-kings of Tel-loh, Zikum was honoured in southern Babylonia under the
name of Balm. 2 She was " the daughter of heaven," to
whom they had erected a temple at Zerghul. Like Gula, she was "the great mother," and in the era of totemism
was known as " the pure heifer." Bau, or Bahu, is the
holm of the Old Testament, the Baau of Phoenician mytho
logy, of whom Philon Byblios informs us that " of the
wind Kolpia and of his wife Baau, which is interpreted
' nisht ' were begotten two mortal men, Aion and Pro
1 Zi-kum, Zi-garum, Zi-kura, are all compounds of Zi, "a spirit," and
are explained by Zi-(E-)kura, " the spirit of the lower firmament." It
is possible that Zi-kum was originally " the spirit of the earth " alone,
Ea being the spirit of the deep. Zi-kura and Zi-garum may have
different etymologies, since (/arum seems to be connected with gar, a Sumerian synomym of apzu. In \V. A. I. iv. 15, 5, e-gur-ra is rendered by the Assyrian upsu. There seems to have been a confusion between F-kiira and E-giira.
2 See Hommel, Vorsemitische Kulturen, p. 380. I do not feel quite
certain, however, about the identification.



376 LECTURE VI.
togonos." 1 According to the book of Genesis, the earth
created by God in the beginning was " without form
and void," the word translated "void" being bohu or
"chaos." The wind or spirit which the Phoenicians
associated with Baau is the Sumerian spirit of the deep,
the Zi Zikum invoked in the magical texts. 2
An allusion to the creation of the heavens out of the
watery abyss, and the subsequent formation of the earth,
is found in a mythological document, where we read :
" The heaven was made from the waters ; the god and
the goddess create the earth." 3 The god and the goddess
must of course mean the heaven and the deep, and thus
presuppose a cosmological theory inconsistent with that of the rulers of Tel-loh, who entitle Bahu the daughter
of the sky. We may gather from this that Bahu and
Zikum were not originally the same divinities, and that
it was only through a belief that the ocean-stream was
fed from heaven that Bahu became identified with it.
The Semites, therefore, could not have come into contact
with the cosmogony of the Sumerians until after the age
of the pateiis of Zerghul. But whatever form the old cosmogony may have
assumed, the fundamental element in it remained un
changed. The watery abyss was always the primal source of the universe. Whether it was the heaven
which first rose out of the deep, and then in combination
with the deep produced the earth, or whether the deep
1 Euseb. Prcap. Evxng. i. 10.

COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGT. 377
itself developed into the heavens and the earth, the deep,
and the deep alone, was the first of things to exist. If
Bahu, therefore, was ever identified with the deep in the
mind of the southern Babylonian, it must have been
when the deep had ceased to be the watery abyss of
ehaos and had become the home of the creator Ea, deriving
its waters from the heavens above.
But it is more probable that the identification was due
to a total misconception of the true character of Bahu.
In the Phoenician mythology as in Genesis, Bohu is sim
ply "chaos," but it is the chaos which existed on earth,
not within the waters of the abyss. It represents that
pre-human age which, according to the legend of Cutha, witnessed the creation of the monsters of Tiamat. These
monsters had their home, their " city," in " the ground ;"
there was therefore already an earth by the side of the
deep. But this earth was the abode of chaos, of Bahu,
and had originated, like the sky, out of the waters of the
abyss. There were thus two representatives of chaos, the primaeval Apzu, the Tiamat of the Semitic epoch,
and the secondary Bahu who presided over the chaos of
the earth. Later ages failed to distinguish between the
two, and Apzu and Bahu thus became one and the same.
But a new distinction now took the place of the older
one. Bahu was no longer distinguished from Apzu; she was distinguished, on the other hand, from Tiamat.
Bahu became one of the great gods, while Tiamat was
left to personate chaos and all the anarchy and evil that
proceeded out of chaos. The spirits of earth were trans
formed into the seven evil demons who had their dwelling
in the deep, and the cosmological sundering of the body



378 LECTUEE VI.
of Zikum took a mythological shape. It appears in the legendary poems as the struggle between Merodach and
the dragon Tiamat, which ended in the rout of Tiamat
and her allies, and the tearing asunder of the body of the
fiend. The poems are all of the Semitic age ; and though
the materials upon which they are based doubtless go
back to a pre-Semitic era, we have no means at present
of determining how much in them belongs to primitive Ciialdsea, and how much is the invention of Semitic
imagination. That Merodach appears in them as the
champion of the gods, proves only that the legends they
embody originated in either Eridu or Babylon. Nothing can show more plainly the wide gulf that lies
between the religions of pre-Semitic and Semitic Chaldsea, than the contrast between the Zikum of Eridu, the mother
of gods and men, aud the wicked Tiamat of the legends,
with her misshapen body and malignant mind. In the
watery abyss in which the first philosophers of Eridu
saw the origin of all things, there was nothing unholy, nothing abhorrent. On the contrary, it was the home
and mother of the great god Ea, the primal source of his
wisdom and his benevolence towards man. It was from
its waters that Oannes had ascended, bringing the light
of knowledge and art to the human race. But the
watery abyss personified by the Tiamat of the poems
belongs altogether to another category. It represents all that is opposed to the present orderly course of the uni
verse ; it stands outside and in opposition to the gods of
heaven, end is thus essentially evil. Not only has the
problem of the origin of evil presented itself to the Babylonian; he has found a solution of it in his dragon of

the drasron is described : J

1 Fragments of an Assyrian copy of the text from the library of Assur-bani-pal at Nineveh were discovered by Mr. George Smith, and published by him in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Arche
ology, iv. 2, a revised edition of them being subsequently published by Prof. Fr. Delitzsch in his Assyrische Lesestuche. They have since been supplemented by a tablet brought by Mr. Hormuzd liassam from
Babylonia, which gives the beginning and end of the text, and shows that it belonged to the fourth tablet of the Creation series. This important tablet has been copied by Mr. Budge, who has been kind enough to allow me the use of his copy. He gave an account of it in
the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, Nov. 6th, 1883, reserving a complete paper on the subject for the Transactions of the
same Society. 2 These are the last two lines of the third tablet of the Creation
Beiics.

Then they placed in their midst by itself his plan ;
:
they spoke to Merodach their first-born ;
' May thy destiny, lord, go before the gods, and may they confirm the destruction and the creation of all that 5? said.
Set thy mouth, may it destroy his plan ; turn, speak unto him and let him produce again his plan.' 2 He spake and with his mouth destroyed his plan ; he turned, he spake to him and his plan was re-created.
Like the -word that issues from his mouth, the gods his father* beheld (it) ;
they rejoiced, they approached Merodach the king ; they bestowed upon him the sceptre (and) throne and reign, they gave him a weapon unrivalled, consuming the hostile :
' Go' (they said)
' and cut off the life of Tiamat ;
let the winds carry her blood to secret places.'

upon words in the original. The god of evil (Kingu, the husband of
Tiamat) is represented as having uttered a word which becomes a plan
or plot : it is this which Merodach is called upon to destroy and r^-create.
2 Literally, "lift up his word."
3 The arming of Merodach with the bow of Aim in " the assembly
of the gods," was the subject of a special poem, of which a fragment
is preserved. One of the constellations was named " the Star of the
Bow ;" and according to the story of the Deluge (Col. iii. 51, 52), when Xisuthros had left the ark and offered his sacrifice on the peak of Mount
Nizir, "Istar (the great goddess) at (her) coming lifted up the mighty shafts (namzabi) which Anu had made.'' That the bow is here referred
to seems evident from a passage in a hymn (W.A.I, ii. 19. 7, 8), where
allusion is made to "the bow of the deluge," in Accadian gisme (gis-bam)
mdtu. The word "bow" is here translated, not by the ordinary Assy
rian midpanu, but by qastu, the Heb. tjesheth. Comp. Gen. ix. 13 — 16.

(Against) the gods my fathers thy enmity hast thou directed
Thou havnesser of thy companions, may thy weapons pierce theii bodies.
Stand up, and I and thou will tight together.' When Tiamat heard this,
she uttered her former spells, she repeated her command.
Tiamat also cried out violently with a high voice.
From its roots she strengthened (her) seat completely. She recites an incantation, she casts a spell, and the gods of battle demand for themselves their arms. Then Tiamat attacked Merodaeh the prince of the gods ;
in combat they joined ; they engaged in battle. Then Bel opened his snare and enclosed her ; the evil wind that seizes from behind he sent before him.
Tiamat opened her mouth to swallow it ; he made the evil wind to enter so that she could not close her lips.
The violence of the winds tortured her stomach, and
her heart was prostrated and her mouth was twisted.
He swung the club ; he shattered her stomach ; he cut out her entrails ; he mastered her heart ; he bound her and ended her life. He threw down her corpse : he stood upon it. When Tiamat who marched before (them) was conquered,
he dispersed her forces, her host was overthrown, and the sods her allies who marched beside her trembled (and) feared (and) turned their back.

he led the illustrious enemy captive like an ox ;
the victory of the Firmament (ansar) he laid fully upon (his)
antagonists ; Merodach the warrior has overcome the lamentation of Ea the
lord of the world.
Over the gods in bondage he strengthened his watch, and Tiamat whom lie had bound he first turned backward ;
so Bel trampled on the foundations of Tiamat.
"With his club unswung (la maidi) he smote (her) skull, he broke (it) and caused her blood to flow ;

He strengthened his mind (?), he formed a clever plan, and he stripped her like a fish of (her) skin according to his plan ; he described her likeness and (with it) overshadowed the heavens ;
he stretched out the skin, he kept a watch, he urged on her waters that were not issuing forth ;
he lit up the sky, the sanctuary rejoiced, ami he presented himself before the deep the seat of Ea. Then Bel measured the offspring of the deep, trie mighty master established the Upper Firmament (E-Sarra) as
his image. The mighty master caused Anu, Bel (Mul-lil) and Ea to inhabit the Upper Firmament which he had created, even the

The legend of the great battle between light and dark
ness thus took the form of a poem addressed to Merodach,
and constituted the fourth tablet or book of the story of
the creation in days.
This story, which bears a curious resemblance to the
account of the creation in the first chapter of Genesis,
was first brought to light by Mr. George Smith. The
first tablet of the series to which it belongs opens as
follows :
" At that time the heaven above had not yet announced, or the earth beneath recorded, a name ;
the unopened'2 deep was their generator, Mummu-Tiamat (the chaos of the sea) was the mother of them alL Their waters were embosomed as one,3 and
the corn-field 4 was unharvested, the pasture was ungrown. At that time the gods had not appeared any of them,

1 This copy seems to have been made in the Persian age, and the
text does not appear to be always correct. This would be explained by the statement that the original was injured. Of much older date is a short incantation (M 1246, 3, 4) which concludes with the words : " O

by no name were they recorded, no destiny (had they fixed).

until they grew up (when) An-sar and Ki-sar were created.
Long were the days, extended (was the time, and) the gods Ann, (Eel and Ea were born). An-sar and Ki-sar (gave them birth)."
The cosmogomy here presented to us bears evident
marks of its late date. The gods of the popular religion
not only have their places in the universe fixed, the period
and manner of their origin even is described. The ele
mentary spirits of the ancient Accadian faith have passed
into the great gods of Semitic belief, and been finally
resolved into mere symbolical representatives of the primordial elements of the world. Under a thin disguise of
theological nomenclature, the Babylonian theory of the universe has become a philosophic materialism. The gods
themselves come and go like mortal men ; they are the
offspring of the everlasting elements of the heaven and
earth, and of that watery abyss out of which mythology had created a demon of evil, but which the philosopher
knew to be the mother and source of all things. The
Tiamat of the first tablet of the Creation story is a very
different being from the Tiamat of the fourth.
The old Semitic confusion between names and things
was, however, as potent as ever. Heaven and earth
existed not in the beginning because no name had been
pronounced in them, and they themselves were nameless.
It was the same with the gods. The gods, too, came into
being only when they received names. The day on which
the names of Lakhmu and Lakhamu were first heard was
the day on which they first " issued forth."

386 LECTURE VI.
I doubt much whether the story in its present form is
older than the time of Assur-bani-pal. Tt is true that a
copy of the fourth tablet, originally deposited in the
temple of Nebo at Borsippa, is now in the British Museum,
but this cannot be earlier than the reign of Nebuchad
nezzar ; and although the ^ast two words of the first line
of the story are quoted in it in an Accadian form, this
proves but little. The scribes of Assur-bani-pal's court
frequently amused themselves by composing in the old
language of Chaldsea, and the introduction of Accadian
words into their texts gave them a flavour of antiquity.
However this may be, the cosmogony of the poem
eventually found its way into the pages of a Greek writer.
Damaskios, an author of the sixth century, has preserved
an account of the cosmological system of the Babylonians, which he probably borrowed from some older
work. 1 " The Babylonians," he tells us, " like the rest of
the barbarians, pass over in silence the one principle of the
universe, and they constitute two, Tavthe and Apason,
making Apason the husband of Tavthe, and denominating her * the mother of the gods.' And from these proceeds
an only-begotten son, Mumis, which, I conceive, is no other than the intelligible world proceeding from the two
principles. From them also another progeny is derived, Lakhe and Lakhos; 2 and again a third, Kissare and
Assoros ; from which last three others proceed, Anos and
Illinos and Aos. And of Aos and Davke is born a son
called Belos, who, they say, is the fabricator of the
world."
1 De Prim. Princip. 125, p. 384, ed. Kopp. 2 So we must read, in place of the Dakh<§ and Dakhos oi tne MSS.



COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY. 387
There is only one point in which the account of Da
maskios differs from that of the cuneiform text. Mumis
or Mummu becomes in it the only son of Tavthe and
Apason, that is to say, of Tiamat and Apsu, " the deep,"
instead of being identified with Tiamat. He takes the
place of the heaven and the earth, which the Assyrian
poet represents as born of Apsu and Mummu-Tiamat.
The alteration seems to be due to a later Babylonian
striving to reconcile the Assyrian cosmological system with the belief that Bel-Merodach was the creator of the
visible world. The birth of the gods is thus thrown back
beyond the creation of the heavens and the earth ; whereas
in the Assyrian poem, as in the first chapter of Genesis, the creation of the heavens and the earth is placed in
the forefront.
Between the cosmogony we have just been considering
and the Babylonian cosmogony reported by Berdssos, no reconciliation is possible. In the one, Tiamat is already
the teeming mother of strange creatures before Bel Mero
dach creates the light, and by tearing her asunder forms
the heaven and the earth. In the other, Tiamat is the
mummu, or " chaos," which, in combination with Apsu,
" the deep," produces Lakhmu and Lakhamu, from whom Ansar and Eisar, "the hosts of heaven" and "the hosts
of earth," are begotten; and then after long ages the gods come into existence, to whom, with Merodach the
son of Ea, the origin of all living things is ascribed. The
names of Ansar and Kisar have, however, wandered far
from their primitive signification. They have come to represent the firmament above and the earth below— not
only the visible sky and the visible earth, but also the
2c2



388 LECTURE VI.
invisible " heaven oi Anu" and the underground world
of Hades.
Like Lakhmu and Lakhanm, they were resolved into
forms of Anu and his female counterpart Anat by the
monotheistic, or rather pantheistic, school to whom I have alluded in a former Lecture. It was to this pan
theistic school that the materialistic school of the cosmo
gonists was most sharply opposed. In the lists in which
the views of the pantheistic school find expression, Lakh
mu and Lakhanm appear as Lakhma, or Lukhma, and Lakhama, an indication that the names are of non-Semitic
origin. It is possible that they denote the element of
"purity" presupposed by the creation of the world out
of the watery abyss. At all events, they are placed in
one of the lists between Du-eri and Da-eri, " the children
of the state," and E-kur and E-sarra, " the temples of
earth and heaven." Like so manv of the Babvlonian
deities, their names and worship were probably carried
to Canaan. Lakhmi seems to be the name of a Philistine
in 1 Chron. xx. 5, and Beth-lehem is best explained as
" the house of Lekhem," like Beth-Dagon, " the house of
Dagon," or Beth-Anoth, " the house of Anat." 1
It is unfortunate that the Assyrian cosmological poem
has reached us only in a fragmentary state. The latter
part of the first tablet is lost, and the second and third
tablets have not yet been recovered. The first half of the
fifth tablet, however, is complete; and as it describes
• Lakhmu is mentioned but rarely in the inscriptions.
" His name,
however, occurs in K 2866, IS, between those of Gula ami Kimmon. Perhaps it is connected elymologically with Lakhamun, the .name of Zarpanit in Dilvuu.



COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY. 389
the creation of the heavenly bodies, we may compare it with the work of the fourth clay according to Genesis,
more especially as the Assyrian poet assigns to the fourth tablet the overthrow of Tiamat and her hosts. It begins
thus :
" (Aim) prepared the (seven) mansions of the great gods;
he fixed the stars, even the twin-stars, to correspond to them ; lie ordained the year, appointing the signs of the Zodiac 1 over it; for each of the twelve months he fixed three stars,
from the day when the year issues forth to the close.
He founded the mansion of the god of the ferry-boat (the Sun-god)
that they might know their bonds, that they might not err, that they might not go astray in any way. He established the mansion of Mul-lil and Ea along with himself.
He opened also the great gates on either side, the bolts he strengthened on .the left hand and on the right,
and in their midst he made a staircase.
He illuminated the Moon-god that he might watch over the night,
and ordained for him the ending of the night that the day may be
known,
(saying) :
' Month by month, without break, keep watch (?) in thy disk ;
at the beginning of the month kindle the night,
announcing (thy) horns that the heaven may know.
On the seventh day, (filling thy) disk, thou shalt open indeed (its) narrow contraction.'2 At that time the sun (will be) on the horizon of heaven at thy
(rising).'"
The rest of the text is in too mutilated a condition
to offer a connected sense, and we may therefore pass on
to another fragment which perhaps belongs to the seventh
tablet. At all events it records the creation of the
animals. " At that time," it declares,

" The gods in their assembly created (the beasts) ;
they made perfect the mighty (monsters) ; they caused the living creatures of the (field) to come forth, the cattle of the field, the wild beasts of the field, and the cieep
ing things of the (field) ;
(they fixed their habitations) for the living creatures (of the field),
(and) adorned (the dwelling-places of) the cattle and creeping things of the city.
(They made strong) the multitude of creeping things, all the off
spring (of the earth)."
The lines that follow are too much broken for transla
tion ; the only matter of remark which they contain is a
statement put into the mouth of some deity that he had
" destroyed the seed of Lakhama.-' Here, therefore, there seems to be a clear reference to the monstrous brood
of chaos which the ancient cosmogony of Cutha regarded
as the offspring of Tiamat. The place of Tiamat has
been taken by the cosmological principle Lakhama, and the crude conceptions of an earlier day have been worked
into the philosophical system of the later cosmology*.
The Babylonian Genesis, then, it will be seen, is neither simple nor uniform. Its history forms a close
parallel to the history of the Babylonian pantheon. Like
the pantheon, it is essentially local in character ; but the
local elements have bee 1! combined eventually so as to
form that great epic of the Creation whose fragments
have come to us from the library of Nineveh. Local,
however, as these elements were in their origin, they all
agree in certain main particulars. In each case the
watery abyss is the primary source of all things ; in each case the present creation has been preceded by another.
How far these common features are due to the compara
tive lateness of the documents from which we derive our



COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY. 391
information we cannot say. For my own part, I suspect
that the legend of Cutha originally knew nothing of the
sea-serpent Tiamat, the chaotic hosts of which it speaks
having been the progeny of the mountains and not of
the deep, But in its present form it agrees with all the
other Babylonian cosmogonies that have been preserved, in making Tiamat their mother and nurse. The Baby
lonian of the historical period was firmly persuaded that
in the ocean-stream that encircled the world lay the
germs of the whole universe.
This belief stands in marked contrast to that pre
historic belief in a "mountain of the world" which sur
vived only in mythology. Xo doubt the two conceptions could be reconciled by those who undertook the trouble ;
it was possible to hold that this mountain of the world
was not the central shaft around which the earth and
heavens were built, but merely the centre of the existing
world. If this view was not generally taken, if in Baby
lonia, hard by the Persian Gulf, the world-mountain
was allowed to drop out of sight, it must have been
because the ideas associated with it did not readily com
bine with the cosmological theories of a later day. At
any rate, the cosmologies of Babylonia, whatever might be the locality in which they were taught, were all based
on the assumption that the wateiy abyss was the first of
things.
This assumption agrees strikingly with the character of the Sumerian culture-god. Ea, the god of Eridu,
Oannes who rose out of the Persian Gulf, was primarily
a water-god. His home was in the deep ; his mother
was the watery abyss. We shall not go far wrong if we
trace the fundamental doctrine of Chaldaean cosmology



392 LECTURE VI.
to Eridu and its worship of the deities of the deep.
Eridu did not communicate to the rest of Babylonia only
the seeds of culture or the adoration of Ea, the gtd of
wisdom ; it impressed upon all the cosmogonies of Babylonia the stamp of its own, and originated that view of
the origin of the world which found its western prophet
in the first of Hellenic philosophers. Like so much else
that had its primal home in Shinar, it was carried west
ward to the shores of the Mediterranean. Phoenician
cosmology also began with an abyss of waters in which
the seeds of all things were begotten; 1 and even the
Hebrew writer tells us that "in the beginning," before
Elohim " carved out the heavens and the earth," "the
earth had been waste and void, and darkness was upon
the face of the deep."
It does not seem, however, that the belief in a pro
visional creation, in the existence of composite animals
who perished when the present world came into being,
can have emanated from Eridu. At Eridu the deep was
not the representative of chaos and confusion ; quite the
contrary, it was a venerable divinity, the mother of Ea
himself. So far, moreover, from the composite animals
of mythology being subjects of abhorrence, Oannes, the
god of culture, the god of pure life, as the inscriptions term him, was actually one of them. It was he who is
described in the fragment of Berossos as half-human, with
the tail of a fish.
These composite creatures were really the offspring of totemism and the attempts of a later age to explain the
figures which totemism had bequeathed to art and mytho
1 Euseb. PrcBp. Evctng. i. 10; Damaskios, Dc Prim. Princip. 123, p. 381, ed. Kopp.



COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY. 393
logy. A place had to be found for the colossal bulls with
human heads and eagles' wings, for the hawk-headed
cherubs who guarded the tree of life, for " the scorpion
men" who watched the sun at his rising and setting, or
for the centaurs, half-man and half-horse, whose forms are
engraved on Babylonian boundary-stones, and who passed over to the Greeks through Phoenician hands. Many of
these, it is true, were beneficent beings, like the man
headed bulls; but the majority belonged to those spirits
of the earth and air against whom the sorcerer-priest had
prepared his spells. They had no place or portion in the
existing order of the universe ; when, therefore, Tiamat
had become a cosmological principle, symbolised by the
serpent or dragon and opposed to the gods of light, it was easy to banish them all to her domain and to regard
her as their mother and nurse.
It may be that this was the work of the priests of
Babylon. At any rate, Bel-Merodach is credited with
having been their destroyer, as he was also the destroyer of Tiamat herself; and it is difficult to believe that this
belief grew up anywhere else than in the city which
owned Merodach as its lord. It is certainly noticeable
that Berossos refers to the images of the monsters painted
in vermilion on the walls of the temple of Merodach when
he is describing the strange creatures of the pre-human
World.
In the epic of the Creation, whether or not it owes its
existence, as I have suggested, to an Assyrian poet of the age of Assur-bani-pal, we may see the final unifica
tion of the varying cosmological legends of Babylonia. They are here combined and harmonised together ; and
though the whole is thrown into a mythological form, as



394 LECTURE VI.
befits the requirements of poetry, its spirit is unmistak
ably materialistic. In spite of the fragmentary condition
in which it has come down to us, it is possible to guess
at the order of its arrangement by comparing it with the
first chapter of Genesis.
The first tablet or book was occupied with the cosmo
gony proper and the creation of the gods. The birth of
the gods of light necessarily brought with it the creation of the light itself. This would have been followed by a
second tablet, in which the creation of the firmament of
heaven was described. The gods needed a habitation,
and this was provided b}r the firmament of the sky. A
mythological tablet, it will be remembered, states that
" the heaven was created from the waters," before that
" the god and goddess," or Ansar and Kisar, " created
the earth," in exact agreement with the account in Genesis.
Here, too, the firmament of the heaven is created out
of the waters of the deep on the second day, dividing
" the waters which were under the firmament from the
waters which were above the firmament," while the earth
does not emerge above the surface of the deep until the
third day. It is therefore probable that the third tablet
of the Assyro-Babylonian epic recounted the formation
of the earth. Unlike the Biblical narrative, however, in
place of the vegetable creation of the third day, it would
seem to have interpolated here the appearance of the
brood of chaos. The legend of Cutha declares that when
the earth was peopled by them, there were as yet neither
"bodies nor brushwood," neither the animal nor the
vegetable world of to-day. However this may be, the fourth tablet recorded the great struggle between Mero
dach and Tiamat, of which no trace appears in the book



COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY 395
of Genesis, though we seem to have allusions to a similar
conflict in the spiritual world in other parts of the Bible.
In Isaiah xxiv. 21, 22, we read " that the Lord shall
visit the host of the high ones that are on high, and the
kings of the earth upon the earth. And they shall be
gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in prison;" while a well-known
passage in the Apocalypse (xii. 7 —9) tells how "there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought against
the dragon ; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more
in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old
serpent, called the Devil, and Satan." The fifth tablet,
as we have seen, was concerned with the appointment of
the heavenly bodies, the work of the fourth day in
Genesis ; the sixth probably related the creation of vege
tables, birds and fish ; and the seventh that of animals
and mankind. 1 In two respects, therefore, the epic would have differed from the Biblical account : firstly, in
the interpolation of the appearance of the monsters of chaos and of the combat between Merodach and the
dragon ; and secondly, in making the seventh day a day of work and not of rest.
The epic never succeeded wholly in supplanting what
we may regard as the local legend of the Creation current
at Babylon. Its cosmogony was indeed known to Da
1 A passage in one of the magical texts indicates that a similar view as to the creation of the woman from the man prevailed in Babylonia, to that which we read of in the book of Genesis. In W.A.I, iv. 1. i. 36, 37, it is said of the seven evil spirits : " the woman from the loins of the man they bring forth," in conformity with the Semitic belief which derived the woman from the man. This part of the magica1
text, at all events, must belong to the Semitic period.



396 LECTURE VI.
maskios, and doubtless suited the philosophic conceptions of the Grreco-Roman age far better than the older crea
tion-stories of Babylonia ; but it is ignored by Berossos, who collected the materials of his narrative from the
priests of Bel-Merodach at Babylon. As one of their
order himself, he preferred to give their own version of
the creation of the world, rather than a version which
was less peculiarly Babylonian, however consonant the
latter might be with the opinions of his Greek readers.
The contents of the fifth tablet introduce us to a side
of Babylonian religion which occupied an important and
prominent position, at all events in the official cult. At
the beginning of the present century, writers upon the ancient East were fond of enlarging upon a Sabaistic
system of faith which they supposed had once been the
dominant form of religion in Western Asia. Star- worship
was imagined to be the most primitive phase of Oriental
religion, and the reference to it in the book of Job was
eagerly seized upon as an evidence of the antiquity ot
the book. Dupuis resolved all human forms of faith into
Zodiacal symbols, and Sir William Drummond went far
in the same direction. That the first gods of the heathen
were the planets and stars of heaven, was regarded by high authorities as an incontrovertible fact.
The plains of Shinar were held to be the earliest home
of this Sabaism or star-worship. The astronomy and astro
logy of Babylonia had been celebrated even by Greek and
Latin authors, and scholars were inclined to see in the
" Chaldeean shepherds" the first observers of the heavens.
The "'astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators" of Babylon, are enumerated in the Old Testa
ment (Is. xlvii. 13) j and the small cylinders brought by



COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY. 397
travellers from Bagdad, with their frequent representations of a star or sun, seemed to leave no doubt that the deities
of Babylonia were in truth the heavenly bodies. The
decipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions has shown that the belief in Babylonian " Sabaism" was, after all,
not altogether a chinuera.
Babylonia was really the cradle of astronomical obser
vations. Long before the lofty zigurr&H or "towers" of
the temples were reared, where the royal astronomers
had their stations and from whence they sent their reports
to the king, the leading groups of stars had been named, a calendar had been formed, and the eclipses of the sun
and moon had been noted and recorded. The annual
path of the sun through the sky had been divided into
twelve sections, like the twelve Jcasbu or double hours ot
the day, and each section had been distinguished by its
chief constellation or star. It was thus that the Zodiac
first came into existence. The names given to its con
stellations are not only Accadian, but they also go baek
to the totemistic age of Accadian faith. The first sign,
the first constellation, was that of "the directing bull,'
:
so named from the solar bull who at the vernal equinox
began to plough his straight furrow through the sky,
directing thereby the course of the year. The last sign but one was "the fish of Ea;" while midway between
the two, presiding over the month whose name was
derived from its " facing the foundation" or " beginning"
of the year, was the great star of the Scorpion. The
fact that the year thus began with Taurus proves the
antiquity of the Chaldsean Zodiac, and of the months
of thirty days which corresponded to its several signs. From about B.C. 2500 and onwards, the precession of



398 LECTURE VI.
the equinoxes caused Aries, and not Taurus, to be the
asterism into which the sun entered at spring-time ; the
period when Taurus ushered in the year reached back
from that date to about B.C. 4700. The Zodiacal circle
may therefore have been invented nearly a thousand
years before Sargon of Accad was born ; and that it was
invented at an early epoch is demonstrated by its close
connection with the Accadian calendar.
With the Semitic domination of Sargon of Accad,
however, Babylonian astronomy entered upon a new phase. To him, tradition ascribed the compilation of the
standard work on Babylonian astronomy and astrology
called the " Observations of Bel," and afterwards translated
into Greek by Bcrossos. But the edition of the work
which we possess presupposes a much later date. Aries, and not Taurus, marks the beginning of the year, and
the text contains references to political and geographical
facts, some of which are probably not much older than
the age of Assur-bani-pal. This is explained by the nature of the work. It was not so much a treatise on
astronomy, as on the pseudo-science that had been evolved
out of the observations of astronomy. The Chaldsean
priests had grasped but imperfectly the idea of causation ;
their fundamental assumption was " post hoc, ergo propter hoc;" when two events had been noticed to happen one
after the other, the first was the cause of the second.
Hence their anxiety to record the phenomena of the
1 icavens and the occurrences that took place after each;
if a war with Elam had followed an eclipse of the sun on
a particular day, it was assumed that a recurrence of the
eclipse on the same day would be followed by a recur
rence of a war with Elam. In this way a science of



COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY 399
astrology was created whose students could foretel the
future by observing the signs of the sky. It is obvious that a work whose object was to connect
astronomical observations with current (.vents must have
been constantly undergoing alteration and growth. New observations would from time to time be introduced into
it, sometimes causing confusion or even omissions in the
text. There are instances in which we can detect the
presence of observations placed side by side, though
belonging to very different periods, or of older records
which have been supplemented by the calculations of a
later age. 1 In their present form, therefore, the u Observations of Bel" have to be used with caution if we would
argue from them to the beliefs and practices of early
Babylonia.
But the astrological science, or pseudo-science, which underlies the whole work, shows that even in its earliest
form it was a product of the Semitic epoch. Between
the attitude of mind presupposed by this pseudo-science, and the attitude of mind presupposed by the magical
texts and Shamanistic cult of Sumerian Chakhea, there
lies an impassable gulf. According to the latter, events are brought about by the agency of the innumerable
spirits of earth and air, and can be controlled by the
spells and exorcisms of the sorcerer ; according to the
astrologer of Sargon's court, they are natural occurrences, caused and determined by other natural occurrences
1 See the examination of the Venus-tablet (W. A. I. iii. 63), by Mr.
Bosanquet and myself in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, xl. 9, pp. 572, 578, where it is shown that a later scrih»> has interpolated a series of fabricated observations in the middle ot an older and genuine record.

wliich. can be discovered and noted by the observer.
Out of the astrologer the astronomer could be born ;
between science and sorcery there can be only an eternal
feud.
It docs not follow, however, that the pre-Semitic population of Chaldsea took no notice of the phenomena
of the sky. Unusual phenomena, such as an eclipse, must
necessarily excite the attention of superstitious and half
civilised tribes ; and the formation of a calendar, the
invention of the Zodiac, and the naming of the principal
constellations, show that a rudimentary astronomy was
already in existence. Indeed, the " Observations of Bel"
not only contain technical terms of Accadian origin, but
embody notices of phenomena like eclipses which pre
suppose a long period of earlier observations. Unless
such observations had existed, even the first compilation
of the work would have been impossible. It was astro
logy, not the rudiments of astronomy, for which the
Somites of Babylonia can claim the entire credit.
In the "Observations of Bel" the stars are already
invested with a divine character. The planets are gods
like the sun and moon, and the stars have already been
identified with certain deities of the official pantheon, or
else have been dedicated to them. The -whole heaven, as
well as the periods of the moon, has been divided between
the three supreme divinities, Anu, Bel and Ea. In fact,
there is an astro-theology, a system of Sabaism, as it would have been called half a century ago.
This astro-theology must go back to the very earliest
times. The cuneiform characters alone are a proof of
this. The common determinative of a deity is an eight
raved star, a clear evidence that at the period when the



COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY. 401
cuneiform syllabary assumed the shape in which we know
it, the stars were accounted divine. We have seen, more
over, that the sun and moon and evening star were
objects of worship from a remote epoch, and the sacred
ncss attached to them would naturally have been reflected
upon the other heavenly bodies with which they were
associated. Totemism, too, implies a worship of the stars. "We find that primitive peoples confound them with
animals, their automatic motions being apparently explicable by no other theory ; and that primitive Chaldsea
was no exception to this rule has been already pointed out. Here, too, the sun was an ox, the moon was a
steer, and the planets were sheep. The adoration of
the stars, like the adoration of the sun and moon, must
have been a feature of the religion of prima3val Shinar.
But this primeval adoration was something very dif
ferent from the elaborate astro-theology of a later day.
So elaborate, indeed, is it that we can hardly believe it
to have been known beyond the circle of the learned
classes. The stars in it became the symbols of the official
deities. Nergal, for example, under hi** two names of
Sar-nerra and 'Sulim-ta-ea, was identified with Jupiter
and Mars. 1 It is not difficult to discover how this
curious theological system arose. Its starting-point was
the prominence given to the worship of the evening and
morning stars in the ancient religion, and their subsequent transformation into the Semitic Istar. The other planets
were already divine ; and their identification with specific
deities of the official cult followed as a matter of course.
As the astronomy of Babylonia became more developed, as the heavens were mapped out into groups of constel

402 LECTURE VI.
lations, each of (vliicli received a definite name, while the
leading single stars were similarly distinguished and named, the stars and constellations followed the lead of
the planets. As Mars became Nergal, so Orion became
Tammuz.
The priest had succeeded the old Sumerian sorcerer,
and was now transforming himself into an astrologer. To
this cause we must trace the rise of Babylonian astro
theology and the deification of the stars of heaven. The
Sabianism of the people of Harran in the early centuries
of the Christian era was no survival of a primitive faith,
but the last echo of the priestly astro-theology of Baby
lonia. This astro-theology had been a purely artificial
system, the knowledge of which, like the knowledge of astrology itself, was confined to the learned classes. It
first grew up in the court of Sargon of Accad, but its
completion cannot be earlier than the age of Kham
muragas. In no other way can we explain the pro
minence given in it to Merodach, the god of Babylon.
But side by side with this " cunningly -devised"
system of theology, the ancient cult of the stars—not as
manifestations or symbols of the official gods, but as
divine beings themselves—maintained itself not only
among the multitude, but among the higher orders as
well. The hemerology of the intercalary Elul, enumerating the feasts and fasts of the month and the religious
services to be performed on each, states that the tenth
day was sacred to the Lady of the Lower Firmament
(Bilat-Ekur) and the divine judges of the starry sky, and that offerings and sacrifices should be made during
the night of it to two particular stars. 1 Towards the

COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY. 403
close of the Assyrian empire, we find an Assyrian scribe
similarly laying down that the king should offer sacrifices
"before the stars, before Assur, before Merodach," and
other gods. 1 The stars, be it noticed, here take the first
place, even before Assur, the god of Assyria, and Mero
dach, the god of Babylon, and hold the same rank as the
colossal bulls and sacred rivers mentioned by the same
author as objects of veneration. 2
In a country which owed so much to its great rivers
as Babjdonia, we should naturally expect to find traces of river-worship. And such indeed is the case. But
the rivers of Babylonia were not, like the Xile, the
bringers of unmixed good. They might indeed be termed
" the bearers of fertility," but their destructive floods
needed curbing by dams and canals; and " the curse of
rain" that descended on the land during the winter
months made the rivers also curses instead of blessings.
Hence it was that, by the side of the cult paid to the
streams, and more especially to the supreme river-god., the divine Euphrates, in whom the people of Eridu had
seen the features of Ea, there was a feeling of dread and
fear, which prevented the cult from attaining its full
development. Nevertheless, an old Accadian text declares
that " the name of the man shall perish who destroys the
body of a river ;" 3 and a Semitic hymn, which is prefaced
by the word siptu, " incantation," addresses the river
(Euphrates ?) in words of adoration and respect : 4

old god of healing spells and his ministering son.

springs, we find traces of a worship of the mountains.
But this worship belonged rather to the days when the
early colonists of Chaldsea had not as yet descended from
the mountains of the East, and its traces are a survival,
assisted perhaps by the conquest of the country in the
historical epoch by the Kosstean highlanders. At any
rate, in Babylonia itself the primitive cult of the moun
tains could be carried on only artificially. The sacred
mountains of the plain were the mounds which marked
the sites of ancient temples, or the towers which rose
within them in order that the priest might continue on
their summits that close communion with heaven which
he had once enjoyed on the high places of the mountain
tops. In the story of the Deluge, the mountain peak of
iNizir, where the rescued hero of the legend built his
altar and poured out his offerings, is called a ziggurrat, or temple -tower. Conversely, "the mountain of the
world" was the name given to a temple at Calah ; and
the mountain of 'Sabu, to which the god Zu took his flight,
was Kharsak-kalama, "the mountain of mankind," an artificial mound near Kis. The most famous of these
sacred tels 01 mounds, however, was the famous tilu din,
"the illustrious mound," at Borsippa, uow represented by the Birs-i-Nimrud. Nebo, to whom the great temple
of Borsippa was dedicated, is called its god (W. A. I. ii. 54, 71). One of "the three great" or secret "names of
Anu" was that of " the lord who issues forth from the
illustrious mound" (W.A.I, iii. G8, 19), in reference to
the fact that the Accadian prototype of Nebo was once
the universe itself, in which the seven spheres of light
were set, and around which the ocean-stream wound like
a rope or serpent. When the old god of Borsippa had



406 LECTURE VI.
passed into the Semitic Kebo, the attributes which Lad
formerly connected him with the firmament of heaven
vere transferred to Ami, the sky-god of the official cult.
A fragmentary tablet, which gives us, as I believe, the
Babylonian version of the buildiug of the tower of Babel,
expressly identifies it with " the illustrious mound."
Here we are told of the leader of the rebellion that when
"the thought of his heart was hostile" and he "had
wronged the father of all the gods," when "he was
hurrying to seize Babylon," and "small and great were
mingling the mound," "the divine king of the illustrious
mound" intervened, " Ann lifted up (his hand) in front"
and prayed "to his father the lord of the firmament."
"All day long he troubled" them; "as they lamented
on their couch he ended not" their "distress." "In
his wrath he overthrows (their) secret counsel ; in his
(fury) he set his face to mingle (their) designs ; he gave the command (?), he made strange their plan." 1 The
very word that the Hebrew writer uses in order to
explain the origin of the name of Babylon, and which
the Authorised Version translates "confound," is here
employed of those who "mingled together" the mound,
and whose designs were afterwards themselves " mingled"
by the god of heaven.
"The illustrious mound" was known as far back as
the time when the months of the Accadian year were
named. The month which corresponded to the Semitic
Tasrit or Tisri, and our September, was " the month of
the illustrious mound." It would seem, therefore, that
legend had referred the attempt to build the tower whose

of the Hicidij of Biblical Arcliaiology, v. 1.



COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY. 407
head should reach to heaven to the autumnal equinox ;
at any rate, it is clear that the mound of Borsippa was
not only in existence, but was already in a state of ruin
when the Accadian calendar was first drawn up.
The sacred mounds of Babylonia, in fact, like the
Gilgals of Palestine, appear to have been the sites of
older structures which had long fallen into decay, and
around which fancy and tradition were allowed to play
freely. They had in this way become veritable hills
tumuli, as we should term them in our modern archieo
logical vocabulary—and as such deserved the venerable
title of sadu, or "mountain." New temples like that of
"the mountain of the world" could be named after them,
but this did not imply a recollection that the sacred
mounds had once been temples themselves. They were
rather, like the mountains of the eastern frontier, the
everlasting altars of the gods, on whose summits worship
could most fittingly be paid to the deities of heaven.
And, like the mountains, they were something more than altars ; they were themselves divine, the visible habita
tions of the spirits of the air. It is possible that Prof.
Friedrich Delitzsch is right in proposing to see in the
Assyrian sadu, or "mountain," the explanation of the Hebrew title of the Deity, El Shaddai. 1 At all events,
God is compared to a rock in the Old Testament (Deut.
xxxii. 15, Ps. xviii. 2), and the worship of sacred stones
was widely spread through the Semitic world.
1 Mul-lil is called kur-gal, sadu rahu in Semitic, "the great mountain," W.A.I, iv. 18, 15; 23, 30; and in v. 44, 41, "the god Kur-gal" is rendered by Bel. In the list of Babylonian kings in -which the mean
ing of their names is explained, the Accadian E-Guzi-kharsag-men is
interpreted E-Saggil-sa Idu-ni, " E-Saggil is our mountain."



408 LECTURE VI.
Between the sacred mounds of Babylonia, however,
and the sacred stones of Semitic faith, there was a wide
difference, answering to a difference in the minds of the
two races to whom these separate cults belonged. The
sacred stone was a Beth-el, or " house of god ;" no habita
tion of a mere spirit, but the dwelling-place of deity itself.
Its sanctity was not inherent ; it was sacred because it
had been transformed into an altar by the oil that was
poured out upon it in libation, or the priest who was consecrated to its service. The worship of these sacred
stones wras common to all the branches of the Semitic
family. The famous black stone of the Kaaba at Mecca
is a standing witness of the fact. So firmly rooted was
the belief in its divine character among the Arabs of
Mohammed's day that he was unable to eradicate it, but
was forced to make a compromise with the old faith by
attaching to the stone the traditions of the Old Testament.
The black stone, though more sacred than any others, did
not stand alone. All around Mecca there were similar
stones, termed Amah, three of which may still be seen,
according to Mr. Doughty, at the gates of the city, where they go by the names of Hobbal, Lata and Uzza. North
ward of Mecca, at Medain-Saleh, the burial-place of the
ancient kingdom of the Nabatha?ans, Mr. Doughty has discovered niches in the rock containing sacred stones.
Above one of them is an inscription which shows that
the stone was the symbol or habitation of the god Auda
(or Aera): "This is the place of prayer which Seruh
the son of Tuka has erected to Auda of Bostra, the great
god, in the month Nisan of the first year of king Malkhos."
Within the last few years, bas-reliefs have been found in
Sicily and Tunisia representing persons in the act of



COSMOGONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY. 409
adoration before a small triad of stone. We are here on
Phoenician territory, and it is not strange therefore that
classical writers should speak of the BaiVv/W or Beth-els,
the meteoric stones Avhich had fallen from heaven like
"the image" of Artemis at Ephesos, and were accord
ingly honoured by the Phoenicians. In the mythology
of Byblos, Heaven and Earth were said to have had four
sons, Ilos or El, Betylos or Beth-el, Dagon and Atlas; and the god of heaven was further declared to have
invented the Baityli, making of them living stones. 1
Bethuel is connected with Aram in the Old Testament
(Gen. xxii. 21, 22); and we all remember how, on his way
to Haran, Jacob awakened out of sleep, saying, " Surely the Lord is in this place," and "took the stone that he
had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and
poured oil upon the top of it, and called the name of that
place Beth-el." In Palestine, however, the Beth-els were
arranged in a circle or Gilgal, rather than singly ; the
isolated monuments were the cones of stone or the bare
tree-trunks which symbolised Asherah, the goddess of
fertility, and Baal the Sun-god. The sun-pillars and the asherim meet with frequent mention in the Biblical
records; and we may gain some idea as to what the latter
were like from the pictures we have on coins and gems
of the famous conical stone that stood within the holy of
holies in the temple of the Paphian Aphrodite, as well as
from the description given of it by Tacitus. 2 On a gem

410 LECTURE VI.
in the British Museum, Sin, " the god of Harran," is represented by a stone of the same shape surmounted by a
star. The " pillars of the Sun" were also stones of a like
form. When the Phoenician temple in the island of Gozo,
whose ruins are known as the Temple of the Giants, was
excavated, two such columns of stone were found, planted
in the ground, one of which still remains in situ. We
cannot forget that even in Solomon's temple, built as it
was by Phoenician workmen, there were two columns of
stone, Boaz and Yakin, set on either side of the porch
(1 Kings vii. 21), like the two columns of gold and
emerald glass which Herodotos saw in the temple of
Melkarth at Tyre (Herodt. ii. 44). The sacred stones which were thus worshipped in
Arabia, in Phoenicia and in Syria, were worshipped also
anions; the Semites of Babylonia. There is a curious
reference to the consecration of a Beth-el in the Epic of
Gisdhubar. When the hero had been dismissed by the
Chaldeean Noah, and his sickness had been carried away
by the waters of the sea, we are told that " he bound
together heavy stones," and after taking an animal for
sacrifice, "poured oyer it a homer" in libation. He
then commenced his homeward voyage up the Euphrates,
haying thus secured the goodwill of heaven for his
undertaking. 1
1 W. A. I. iv. 51, v. 5:2. vi. 1 — 4. The stones or asherim which
had thus been consecrated by oil being poured over them, are frequently
mentioned in the Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions under the name
oihisnlli. Kiiallu is a word borrowed from the Accadian ki-zal, " place
of oil" or " anointing," and represented the " altar," so often depicted on
Assyrian gems and bas-reliefs, which consisted of an upright post or
column, sometimes with an extinguisher-like top. A good representation of three of these columns, of ditferent forms, will be seen on a Phceni



COSMOdONIES AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY. 411
The homeward voyage of the Chalda?an hero is a
reminder that we, too, have finished our survey of Baby
lonian religion, so far as our present knowledge of it will
allow. Two facts in regard to it stand prominently
forth ; its essentially local character, and its hybrid origin. "We cannot understand even its most elementary
features unless we bear in mind that it is the product of
different races and different political systems. In detail,
indeed, it may not always be easy to distinguish between Accadian and Semitic, or between the gods of Eridu and
the gods of Babylon ; but the main outlines of the picture
are clear and distinct, and any attempt to obliterate or
forget them will lead only to confusion and error. That
the materials are still wanting for a complete history of
the rise and development of Babylonian religion, I am only too well aware ; but where completeness is unattain
able, even an imperfect sketch has its merits and value.
And the importance of Babylonian religion to the student
of theology need not be pointed out. Apart from its
general interest in illustrating the history of religion among one of the few races of mankind who have been
the pioneers of civilisation, it has a special interest from
its bearing on the faiths of Western Asia, and more espe
cially on that of the people of Israel. If 1 have not
more frequently drawn attention to the latter, it has been
due to my desire to keep faithfully to the subject of my
Lectures. I have undertaken to treat of Babylonian reli
gion only, not of Semitic religion in general. For such

a task there are others far more competent than myself ;
great Arabic or Syriac or Hebrew scholars, who have
devoted their lives to the study of one or more of these
better-known Semitic tongues. My own studies have of
late years lain more and more in the ever- widening circle
of Assyrian research ; here there is enough, and more
than enough, to fill the whole time and absorb the whole
energies of the worker ; and he must be content to confine
himself to his own subject, and by honest labour therein
to accumulate the facts which others more fortunate than
he may hereafter combine and utilise. This is the day of
specialists ; the increased application of the scientific
method and the rapid progress of discovery have made
it difficult to do more than note and put together the
facts that are constantly crowding one upon the other
in a special branch of research. The time may come
again—nay, will come again—when once more the ever
flowing stream of discovery will be checked, and famous scholars and thinkers will arise to reap the harvest that
we have sown. Meanwhile I claim only to be one of the
humble labourers of our own busy age, who have done
my best to set before you the facts and theories we may
glean from the broken sherds of Nineveh, so far as they
bear upon the religion of the ancient Babylonians. It is for others, whose studies have taken a wider range, to
make use of the materials I have endeavoured to collect,
and to discover in them, if they can, guides and beacons
towards a purer form of faith than that which can be
found in the official creeds of our modern world.

APPENDIX.
The primitive language and population of Chaldsea have excited so
much discussion, and the views held on the subject by Assyriologists have undergone so much modification as their knowledge of the inscriptions has become more extensive and exact, that it is necessary for me
to state precisely the conclusions to which, as it seems to me, the
evidence now at our disposal would lead us. Others besides Assyrian students are probably aware that the question has aroused more than
one fierce controversy ; every step in advance has been gained after a
good deal of fighting ; and not only the name and relationship of the
pre-Semitic language of Babylonia, but its priority to the Semitic Babylonian and even its very existence, have been made the subjects of animated discussion. The discussion, it is true, has usually been the
result of misunderstandings and errors, of hasty conclusions and misin
terpreted facts ; but in this respect it lias not differed widely from most other discussions in science or theology.
The decipherment of the Assyrian inscriptions had not proceeded far before it became clear that the Assyrian syllabary was not of
Semitic origin. This, at least, seemed to the first decipherers the most natural way of accounting for the curious fact that the characters pos
sessed phonetic values which did not correspond to the Semitic words
represented by the same characters when used ideographically. The character which denoted "a head," for example, not only possessed the Semitic value of ris, but also the non-Semitic value of sag. Moreover,
the syllabary expressed very imperfectly the sounds of a Semitic language. The distinctive Semitic sounds of ayin, t<"tli and tsadde, were
wanting in it, or else represented defectively. In place of the clear pronunciation of the consonants which distinguishes a Semitic idiom, it was found that surds and sonants were confounded together at the
end of a syllable. It appeared evident, therefore, that the syllabary, the pictorial origin of which was soon recognised, must have been



41(5 APPENDIX I.
invented ly a non-Semitic people, and handed on by them to the Semitic populations who inhabited the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates during the historical period. Dr. Hincks proposed the name of "Accadian" for the old language and its speakers, and Dr. Oppert believed that he saw in it marks of relationship to the languages of
the "Turanian" or Ural-Altaic family. It was not long before this view of the origin of the Assyrian sylla
bary appeared to find a verification, partly in the discovery of early "Babylonian inscriptions written by means of it in a non-Semitic idiom, partly in the "bilingual texts" of Assur-bani-paPs library, in which the words and documents of the old idiom were interpreted by interlinear or parallel translations in Semitic Assyrian. All that remained was to
analyse the words and forms of the old language — no easy task, however, when it is remembered that they are for the most part written
ideographically, and not phonetically. Dr. Oppert's first essays in this direction were followed by an article of mine in the Journal of Philology
for 1870, in which I endeavoured to give the first fairly complete
sketch of "Accadian" grammar. Three years later this was systemalised and extended by the brilliant and inexhaustible pen of Francois Lenormant.
Dr. Oppert objected to the term " Accadian," which had been adopted from Dr. Hincks by Lenormant, Dclitzsch and myself, and proposed instead of it the term " Sumerian." From an early epoch
Chaldsea had been divided into two main divisions, called respectively Accad and Sumer ; and the monarchs who claimed sovereignty over the
whole country entitled themselves accordingly " kings of Sumer and Accad," in contradistinction to those who could claim to be rulers of
" the land of Accad" only. 1 To Dr. Haigh belongs the credit of first pointing out that Sumer is the Shinar of the Old Testament; 2 while
George Smith, with his usual divinatory instinct, perceived that it must represent southern Babylonia, Accad being the district round the
capital city of Accad, or Agade (formerly read Agane). George Smith'* views, however, were not at first adopted by other Assyriologists, and
1 Kengi Agade, misinterpreted in later days to mean "Sumer and Accad."
"
Halevy's " Rabbinical" etymology of Shinar does not require refutation. Already in Gen. xi. 2, the name of Shinar has been extended to denote the whole of Babylonia, as in Daniel and Zech. v. 11, just as in Micah v. 6, the dominion of Nimrod seems to be extended to Assyria; but in Gen. x. 10r tin- name is still confined to southern Babylonia, aud is therefore used to indicate the southern position of Calneh.



APPENDIX I. 417
it is only within the last three or four years that newly-found inscriD
tions have shown them to be correct.
The arguments by which Dr. Oppert supported his proposal were not convincing, and for some time he secured no converts. But the researches of Professor Paul Haunt, one of the ablest and best-trained
of the younger band of Assyriologists, threw an entirely new light on the matter. I had noticed (in 1874) the existence of more than one
dialect in Proto-Chalda.'an, and in a paper on Accadian Phonology (in 1877) had tried to show that our "Accadian" texts contain newer a?
well as older forms, and that many of them are composed in a language which exhibits all the signs of long decay ; but it was reserved for
Prof. Haupt to demonstrate scientifically that there were two clearly
marked dialects of Accadian, and to point out the principal characteristics of each. He assumed that the standard dialect, that which
preserved the old language in its purest and most archaic form, was
the dialect of Accad or northern Babylonia ; the second dialect, which he regarded as standing to the other in the relation of a daughter or a
younger sister, being the dialect of Sumer or the south. My own view
had originally been the converse of this, but Prof. Haupt's arguments
brought me over to his side. Subsequently, however, his assumption
was attacked by Dr. Hommel ; and after a considerable amount of
hesitation, I have arrived at the conviction that Dr. Hommel is right. "The dialect" which Prof. Haupt would make Sumerian and Dr.
Hommel Accadian, exhibits the language of early Chaldcea in a decayed and degenerated form. It is largely affected by Semitic influence ;
not only has it adopted Semitic words, but Semitic idioms as well.
These Semitisms, moreover, are partly popular, partly literary in origin ; some of them, that is, are manifestly the introductions of a learned class who have imported them into Proto-Chaldaean much in the same
way as Greek terms have been imported into English by men of
science, or French expressions by litterateurs. Now it was in northern Babylonia, and not in the south, that Semitic influence and Semitic
supremacy first made themselves felt. It was at Accad that the earlies
Semitic empire, that of Sargon, first grew up, and it was there that
the first Semitic library was founded under the patronage of a Semitic monarch. Sumer cowtinued much longer under Proto-Chalda3an rule ;
and it is possible, if not probable, that one or more Proto-Chakkean
dialects continued to be spoken in Sumer clown to the days of Nebu
chadnezzar himself. Whether the Semitic name of Accad is derived from the Proco-Chai
dsean Agade, or the Proto-Chaldrean Agade from the Semitic Accad, we 2E

do not know ; but it is certain that the importance of tne city dates
only from the Semitic epoch of Babylonia. The name is represented by a compound ideograph (bur-bur) which signifies "a mound," and a gloss informs us that this ideograph was pronounced tilla. 1 Sir Henry Rawlinson saw in tilla a derivative from elu, "to ascend," with
the signification of " high-lands ;" and I formerly believed that support for this view could be found in the word Accad itself, which I con
nected with a supposed Proto-Chaldsean alca, " to lift up." But this
belief was entirely wrong. Accad has nothing to do with alca, which
means " to love," and tilla is the common Assyrian tillu, " a tel." It
signifies the mound on which a city or temple stood, as well as the mound formed by the debris of a ruined town. Accad was therefore
known as Tilla, either because it stood on the site of an earlier pre
Semitic city, or because of the lofty artificial platform on which it
was built.
The compound ideograph to which the pronunciation of Tilla was attached was applied by Sargon to the country of Ararat or Armenia. This may have been due to a simple confusion of two geographical names which had nothing to do with one another. In the tablet which gives us the name of Tilla, and which appears to have been
intended to explain difficult words in texts emanating from the library
of Accad, Tilla is interpreted to mean Urdhu. Since the Euphrates
at Sippara was termed the Urudtuv, or " river of bronze" (from the Proto-Chakkean urad, "bronze"2
), it seems probable that Urdhu is a Semitised form of Urud, a name which Ave may suppose to have been
given to Sippara or Accad and the surrounding district in consequence of the bronze with which their edifices were adorned. The resemblance
of Urdhu to Urardhu or Ararat, the Assyrian designation of Armenia, may have led the Assyrian king to transfer an ideograph which properly denoted the north of Babylonia to the mountainous land of Armenia.
However this may be, Dr. Hommel has, I believe, made it clear that the texts whose primitive home can be shown to have been
Sumer are in the older and standard Proto-Ohaldsean dialect, while those which display a later and more Semitised phase of the language
belong primarily to Accad. At the same time, it must not be forgotten that the priests of Accad not unfrcqucntly attempted to write in the arohaic and revered language of Sumer ; while, on the other hand, texts
which originated in Sumer have undergone such extensive niod'*?

cations by repeated revision as to be overlaid with the characteristics
of the northern dialect. It is also not impossible that changes similar
to those undergone by the old language in Accad may at a later time
have overtaken the dialect of the south, so that phonetic peculiarities,
which seem to us to belong to Accad, may really belong to the language of S inner in a later stage of decay.
I must here diverge for a moment in order to emphasise the fact that very few of the earlier texts of Sumer and Accad have come down
to us in their original form. With the exception of the contempo
raneous inscriptions of the kings of Tel-loh or Mugheir, and perhaps also of the hymns to the Sun-god of Sippara, which were composed in
literary " Accadian" at a time when the old language had long become
extinct, the earlier literature of Chakkea has been subjected to alterations and modifications of the most extensive kind. Documents of
different age and origin have been pieced together ; words, lines, and
even whole passages have been freely interpolated ; glosses have crept into the text from the margin ; the language has been modernised again
and again ; and the errors of copyists, intentional or unconscious, have made their way into the text. The corruption of the text has been
further increased by the imperfect acquaintance of many of the later editors with the pre-Semitic dialects of Chaldsea. This has been a
frequent cause of error, and in one case at least has resulted in maca
ronic verses, the Semitic portion of which has no real connection with the Sumerian. 1 It is true that the scribes were assisted in under
standing the earlier texts by commentaries, in which explanations were given of the more difficult words and ideographs ; but the explanations of the commentators were not always correct, while the com
mentaries or so-called "bilingual lists" have themselves suffered from
the mistakes and ignorance of later editors. The scrupulous care with
which the scribes of Assur-bani-pal copied the tablets brought from
Babylonia, noting the places where there was " a lacuna" (khibi) or "a recent lacuna" (khibi essu), giving alternative characters wh^re the scribe was uncertain as to the Assyrian character to which the- Baby
lonian original corresponded, and at times frankly confessing the
inability of the copyist to understand his copy (id idi, " I do not
know"), was a growth of comparatively modern date. The Babylonian scribes may have shown the same carefulness for a few centuries before
the age cf Assur-bani-pal, and efforts may have been made to secure
the accurate reproduction of the religious texts as soon as they acquired

a sacred character ; but for at least two thousand }ears alter the era of Sargon of Accad all the causes of corruption above enumerated were
freely at work, and it was just during this period that the larger part of the Babylonian literature we possess assumed its present form. The only wonder is that the non-Semitic portion of it should have been
handed down as correctly as it is. It was probably in the time of
Khammuragas (B.C. 2300) that the main bulk of it came into exist
ence. There seems to have been a literary revival at that period, not unlike the literary revival in "Wales in the 12th and 13th centuries.
A considerable number of the older commentaries were probably
composed at the time ; at all events, the Epic of Gisdhubar and other
similar works are in all likelihood to be referred to this date. Under
Khammuragas, Babylon became the dominant state in Babylonia, and absorbed the older fame of the Semitic empire at Accad and Sippara ;
hence it is that the list of Babylonian dynasties begins with the dynasty of Khammuragas, and that while the antediluvian kings of
Berossos belong for the most part to Larankha or Surippak, the near
neighbour of Accad, the first of them, Aloros, is made a native of
Babylon. But behind the Semitic legends of Accad and Babylon, as may be
seen from the foregoing Lectures, lie older non-Semitic legends which
speak of the origin of culture and civilisation in ChakUea. These
legends describe it as beginning on the shores of the Persian Gulf and
working its way to the cities of the north. This is in complete harmony with what we have found to be the evidence of the native inscriptions.
Eridu, the primaeval capital of the south, was the first home of the god of culture and healing, and it is with Eridu and its deities that the
oldest religious texts are intimately associated. As these texts are in the standard dialect, it would follow that Dr. Hommel is right in
regarding it as the dialect of Sumer.
But yet more. The. cuneiform system of writing was at the outset
pictorial, and its earliest documents would therefore be mainly written
with ideographs, and not with phonetic signs. Xow this is one of the peculiarities which distinguish the texts of the standard dialect from
those composed in the second dialect, and consequently justifies us in assuming them to Eridu and the surrounding district. If once we
assume that the standard dialect is that of Sumer, and the secondary
dialect that of Accad, everything falls naturally into its place. The so-called "bilingual lists" sometimes qualify a word or form
belonging to the secondary or Accadian dialect by a couple of ideographs
which literallv inc-im "the language of woman." This " woman's laiv



APPENDIX I. 421
guage" has been supposed to have a grammatical reference, denoting perhaps what we should call a "weak form ;" but though grammatical
terms were certainly used by the compilers of the lists, it is only those
of a more obvious character, such as "singular" and "plural," "masculine" and "feminine;" and I prefer to see in the expression, "woman's language," a reference to one of those numerous cases in which the
language of the women and the nursery is distinguished from that of the men. In northern Babylonia, where Semites and non-Semites intermingled from an early period, there would have been reasons in plenty for such an appellation. Semitic wives would not have spoken Sumerian with the same purity as their non-Semitic husbands ; while, on the other hand, the dialect of the Sumerian wife would have been regarded by her Semitic husband as essentially a feminine idiom. 1
That more than one dialect prevailed in Chaldaaa before its complete
occupation by the Semites, is not only necessary from the nature of things, but is also borne out by facts. Besides the two main dialects
of Sumer and Accad, our texts, in spite of the corruption they have
suffered, permit us to recognise other sub-dialects, among which may be noted the dialects of Sippara and Eridu. To these must be added
the literary dialect which probably grew up in the court of Sargon of
Accad, and is distinguished by its incorporation of Semitic words and idioms, as well as by its mixture of archaic and more modern non
Semitic forms. An indication of its date may be found in the Semitic
loan-word gabiri, "a mountain" (Arabic jebel),2 which had ceased to
be used in Assyro-Babylonian long before the age of Khammuragas. Corresponding with this literary Accadian was the literary AssyroBabylonian whose beginnings also go back to the era of Sargon of Accad. AVhile the language of Accadian literature borrowed Semitic
words and expressions, the language of Semitic literature borrowed from Accadian. "Where the scribes were either Semites who had learnt
Accadian, or else Accadians who had learnt Semitic, this was only
1 The ideographic designation of Sumer in late Assyrian inscriptions, eme-ku, is probably an example of what Hak'vy has happily termed a
rebus, and should be read emequ —emgu in Babylonian —that is, " wise" or
" secret," in reference to the fact that the old language of Sumer was chiefly
employed in later days in the composition of spells. Ku was chosen instead of QU, partly because of its resemblance in sound to the Sumerian kua, "an
oracle," partly because the similarity of the Semitic asaba, " to sit," to asapu,
" to divine," had given the Sumerian ku, " to sit," the further signification
of " soothsaying." 2 W. A. I. ii. 50, 56.



422 APPENDIX I.
natural ; and since Chalda-an culture and writing were of Sumerian
origin, while most of the religious and other texts were composed in the Sumerian language, it was inevitable that the amount of borrowing on the Semitic side was greater than that on the Accadian side. The
technical terms of Sumerian science, or pseudo-science, whether this dealt with magic or with astrology, were introduced into Semitic docu
ments, and the Semitic vocabulary was enriched with words like
asaTcku, "fever," and ribanna, "a conjunction." As time went on, it seems to have become more and more fashionable, to import Accadian
or Sumerian words into literary Babylonian, and an imperfect know
ledge of the old language not unfrequently assigned to these words a wrong form or a wrong iueaning. The most curious errors, however, on the part of the borrowers were caused by the ideographic character
of the script. "When the cuneiform system of writing was first learned
by the Semites, it was still in process of formation. Its pictorial origin was still remembered, and the Semitic scribes considered themselves at
liberty not only to create new ideographs by combining two or more together, but even to invent ideographs for which there was no prece
dent in the Sumerian s}dlabary. Xew phonetic values were introduced, derived from the Semitic words which expressed the meaning of the
several ideographs, and the characters received new ideographic signi
fications due to the similarity of two Semitic roots, one of which only
was the real representative of the ideograph in question. As the second root was often translated back into Accado-Sumerian, and the AccadoSumerian word so obtained was sometimes used as a phonetic value of the ideograph, the Aecado-Sumerian texts which originated under Semitic influence came to be filled with a strange medley of Sumerian and Semitic.
It was in the Semitic texts, however, that literary affectation was carried to the greatest lengths. In the more modern epoch of cuneiform
writing, when the dialect of literature and the dialect of every-day
life had come to stand more and more apart, the learning of the scribes
was displayed in an almost Kabbalistic play upon the characters of the syllabary. Not content with borrowing words and phrases from the Sumerian literature, which had now entered upon a stage analogous
to that of monkish Latin, they read the ideographs phonetically, and
then imported them bodily into the inscriptions of the Semitic kings. Thus the Sumerians had a word 4ur, signifying " a table of shewbread,"
and represented by the two ideographs ki-gal, literally " great place ;" and we actually find this ki-gal, under the Semitic form of h'gallu, used
in the inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar and his successors, and inter



APrENDix i. 423
preted to mean M a platform." A large number, however, of these farfetched and erroneous forms are to he found only in the so-called
"bilingual lists," audit is probable that they never made their way into any actual text. The compiler of one of these lists was proud of
showing his erudition by heaping words together which only the initiated could understand. But of course it was not the artificial literary Semitic dialect alonf
that was indebted to the Sumerian for the enrichment of its vocabulary. Two lan^ua^es cannot be in contact one with another without mutual
borrowing, and the more cultivated language is the one which usually gives more than it takes. The existence of the Sumerian language, therefore, postulates not only a large number of Sumerian loan-words
in the Assyro-Babylonian of daily intercourse, but also, as students of the science of language know well, a certain amount of influence upon its structure and grammar. Thus I have long believed that the dis
tinction made in Assyro-Babylonian between the present mule/cut ami
the aorist askun —a distinction so contrary to the ordinary character of
the Semitic verb— is due to the influence of the Sumerian, which pos
sessed a real verb with a present and an aorist; and it is difficult to
explain in any other way the order of the Assyro-Babylonian sentence which followed the Sumerian in placing the verb at the end, thus setting at defiance the primary law of Semitic structure. Ecpially
instructive is the comparatively little use made by Assyro-Babylonian of the permansive. which answers to the perfect of the other Semitic
tongues. The Semitic perfect could flourish only where the verb expressed condition and not time ; a language which had developed
real tenses with a temporal signification had but slight need of ita employment. In fact, if he did not already know of the existence
of Sumerian, the comparative grammarian, like the discoverers of the planet Uranus, would have to presuppose it. The same would also be the case with the comparative philologist who undertook an examination of the Assyro-Babylonian vocabulary.
Not only the literary dialect, but the spoken language as well, contained an enormous number of words, of which we seek in vain for any satis
factory representatives in the other Semitic languages. Now it is ?. commonplace of scientific philology that when we come across a largn residuum of words in a language for which we can find no allied worda in the other languages of the same family of speech, we must conclude that a considerable proportion of them have been borrowed from elsewhere. In Greek, Mr. Wharton has shown that, besides G4T words whoso
foreign origin can be traced, there are about 520 which seem to have



424 APPENDIX I.
no Indo-Europaean etymology, and presumably, therefore, come for the most part from a foreign source ;
l and what is true of Greek is true
also of Semitic Babylonian. The roots preserved by one member of a
linguistic family and lost by all its sisters can never be very numerous;
the roots —or words— which it has invented are fewer still ; and hence
the long list of words peculiar to Assyro-Babylonian points with an unerring hand to borrowing from a foreign source. If we would feel
the full force of the argument, we must compare Assyro-Babylonian with Hebrew, to which it bears so close a relationship. The words
peculiar to Hebrew, and probably for the most part of foreign extraction, like har, "a mountain," are in the proportion of only one to ten when compared with the words peculiar to the language of Semitic
Babylonia used, so far as we can judge, in the daily intercourse of the
people. Many of the latter we know to be derived from Sumerian, audit is therefore probable that as our knowledge of Sumerian increases we shall find many more which have had the same origin. At the same time it must not be supposed that Sumerian was the only foreign
tongue upon which the Semites of Babylonia levied their contributions.
At one period or another they were in contact with Elamites, Kossa^ans, Sutians and the like, and it is only reasonable to conclude that they
borrowed something from each. "We know, indeed, that they adopted certain of the Elamite and Kosssean deities, and those who adopt deities
are likely to adopt other things as well. No Semitic parallel has yet
been pointed out for the common Assyro-Babylonian verb kasadu, " to possess ;" it is equally difficult to discover for it a Sumerian derivation ; may it not then be a word, not evolved out of the inner consciousness
of the Babylonians, nor preserved by them while forgotten by their Semitic brethren, but taken from the language of one of their numerous
neighbours 1 There are two facts which make it specially difficult to determine
whether a given word peculiar to Assyro-Babylonian, but not discoverable in Sumerian, is really a loan-word or not. The first is our un
certainty as to the primitive home of the speakers of the Semitic
parent-speech before its separation into the languages of the north and the south. If, as I believe, this home was in the desert on the western
side of the Euphrates, in the immediate proximity of the Sumerian
kingdoms of Chahhea, the parent-speech itself would have been in contact with Sumerian long before one of its dialects developed into
the Semitic language of Babylonia, and we should therefore expect to
* Etyma Grmca, p. vi.



ArPENDix i. 425
find traces of Sumerian influence not only in the Semitic languages of
the north— Assyro-Babylonian, Phoeniko- Hebrew and Aramaean —but
in the Semitic languages of the south as well. The second fact is the
want of any early monuments of Semitic speech except those composed in the dialects of Babylonia and Assyria. The next oldest monuments
are in Phoenician and Hebrew ; but the Phoenicians and Hebrews,
according to their own traditions, had migrated from Babylonia, and a large part of the literature of the Old Testament belongs to the period of the Babylonish Captivity. "We know nothing of Arabic before the fifth century of the Christian era ; and who can tell the extent to which
it had already been influenced by the Aramaic dialects which had themselves been so long in contact with Babylonia 1 For these reasons it is somewhat rash to conclude, with Dr. Zimmern, that the occurrence of the same phrase or idiom in an Accadian and a Semitic text necessarily proves that the Accadian text has been composed under Semitic
influence. The rashness, indeed, is paralleled by the same scholar's assertion that the inteijections ua and a have been introduced into an Accadian text from Semitic Babylonia. As Professor Friedrich De
litzseh remarks, interjections are much the same all over the world. 1 But Professor Delitzsch has himself put forward statements which
make one wish that Assyriologists would submit to a training in
scientific philology. His conception of a root is still that of Ibn
Kbayyuj, if we may judge from his assertion that the Semitic word for
" mother" is derived from the idea of " spaciousness ;" 2 and his opinion
that the word <zd, in the sense of " father,'' is of Semitic origin, is a
greater crime against linguistic science than Dr. Zimmern's belief in
the peculiarly Semitic character of certain vocalic interjections. 3 It is
only necessary to glance over a list of the words for " father" in the
various languages of the world, to discover that ad or at is one of the
commonest of titles given by the child to the parent. 4 Professor De

A page bristling with diacritical marks may look scientific, but not unfrequently the appearance is greater than the reality. Diacritical marks are objectionable for two reasons, first of all because they cannot be reproduced by

litzsch, however, after turning half the Semitic Babylonian vocabulary into Accadian, has now gone to the opposite extreme, and would transform what is Accadian into Semitic. The cause of both exaggerations is the same. He has put his faith in the so-called syllabaries and
bilingual lists rather than in the actual texts which we possess. Far be it from me to disparage either the value of these lists or of the work which has been accomplished by Professor Delitzsch and his
pupils. "We owe it in great measure to him that the decipherment of
Assyrian stands at its present level of scholarship, and the publication of his long-promised but long-delayed Assyrian Dictionary will tend to place the study of Assyrian on the same footing as that of the better-known Semitic languages. But the Leipzig school has, with
one or two striking exceptions, been far too one-sided. Archaeology,
history, religion, mythology, have been neglected in favour of the almost exclusive study of words : words, too, not as bound together in the
sentences of untranslated texts, but isolated and apart. Their explana
tion has been sought in syllabaries and lists of synonyms, rather than in the context of the documents which have come down to us. This
excessive devotion to vocabularies has been too often accompanied by
a misconception or forgetfulness of the real nature of the " bilingual lists." They are for the most part commentaries upon older texts, made we know not when, and intended to explain the meaning of rare
expressed. If the Assyrian tsaddi was pronounced ts, it is better to write it
so than to denote it by a symbol "which may mean anything or nothing.
Where the two letters belong to different syllables, which is rarely the case
in Assyrian, they can be separated by a hyphen (t-s). In fact, when the
Assyriologists come to represent their diacritical marks by letters to which
an intelligible pronunciation can be assigned, I find them flying in the face of phonetic possibilities. It is all very well to represent the simple sibilant
of Assyrian by s; but this is the symbol chosen by Sievers and other pho
Qologists to express the sound of sh, and it is accordingly replaced at times
by sh by those Assyrian scholars who make use of it. Unfortunately, pho
netics prove that the Assyrian sibilant could not have had this value, as
Rawlinson and Oppert long ago perceived. A well-known phonetic rule of
Assyrian is for a dental followed by the sibilant to become samech, the
dental being first assimilated to the sibilant. Now ss is samech, but not shsh. The representation of the Assyrian teth by t is another phonetic error. The Assyrian teth had affinities with dakth and not with ton, as is proved
by its frequent interchange with the former, as well as by the fact that the
same characters were employed to express the daleth and the teth. Its pro
nunciation was in all probability that of the English dh (as in the). As for
the qoph (which in Babylonian passed into g), pakeography and phonetics alike sau timi its symbolisation by q.



APPENDIX I. 427
or obsolete words, ideographs and expressions. The original text was sometimes in Accado-Sumerian, sometimes in an older form of Semitic
Babylonian ; while at other times texts in both languages were commented on together by the scribe. In the so-called non-Semitic column
of the " bilingual lists," accordingly, we must expect to find not only Accado-Sumerian, but also Semitic words as well as ideographs which
may be either of Sumerian or of Semitic origin. Now and then the
scribe displays his learning by introducing synonyms or equivalent ideographic combinations, many of which had probably never been used in any real text at all. The mythological lists, which contain a medley of divine names and epithets drawn from sources of all kinds
and ages, partly Accado-Sumerian. partly Assyrian, partly purely ideographic, partly even Elamite or Kosssean, atford a good example of
the difficulty and danger of trusting implicitly to such guides. It is from this cause that Assyrian has been mistaken for Accadian, Acca
dian for Assyrian ; while ideographs have been read phonetically, and
phonetic characters as if they were ideographs. We must never forget that the object of the commentators was not to provide a bilingual
vocabulary ; the distinction between Accadian and Assyrian was one
which they hardly understood. Their task was to explain everything that seemed obscure to the current language of their own time, and consequently obsolete or unusual Semitic words and forms, as well as rare modes of writing otherwise well-known words, stood for them on precisely the same footing as the Avords of the old dialects of Sumer
and Accad. The lists of Semitic synonyms must be studied with equal caution. The Assyrian scribe had not the same fine discrimination as
the modern lexicographer ; it was sufficient for him to group words together which had the same general sense or could be employed in
parallel phrases. Moreover, in these lists he had an excellent opportunity of displaying the extent of his erudition, and it is therefore by no means always certain that all the words included in them were
ever used either in literature or in the language of daily life. Another fact must be remembered which seriously detracts from the value of the "bilingual lists." Where an Accado-Sumerian word is
translated by an Assyrian one, the latter has generally been taken by the commentator from what may be termed the authorised translation of the non-Semitic texts. But the Babylonian translator had not the
same ideas in regard to translation as a modern scholar. At times,
indeed, he was slavishly literal — so literal, in fact, as to contravene the common idiom of Semitic speech ; but more usually his rendering was a paraphrase rather than a translation. It vis sufficient for him if he



428 APPENDIX I.
gave the general sense of the original, or what appeared to him the general sense ; since the notes attached to the bilingual texts given in
this volume will show that the translators were not always thoroughly
well acquainted with the language the}' undertook to explain.** Hence it is that different Accado-Sumerian words are rendered by the same Semitic equivalent, that Accado-Sumerian verbs are apt to be repre
sented by the same monotonous ideas of "giving"' or "placing," and
Accado-Suinerian adjectives by the same conceptions of " strong" or
" great." Conversely, the same Accado-Sumerian word is made a synonym of different Semitic ones. The result is, that the labours of
the Leipzig school have made us acquainted with a prodigious number
of Assyrian words all signifying " to go," or " to bind," or " to give," or "to be strong." This is well enough for a beginning but we
naturally wish to know what kind of " going," or " binding," or
" giving," is denoted in a particular case. All this goes to show how needful it is to criticise the native voca
bularies, and more especially to control them by the evidence of connected texts, if we would employ them with success. But there is
yet a further and important reason for criticism and control. These native vocabularies are not infallible. Xot only must Ave admit mis
takes on the part of the original translator and the original commentator ; we must admit them also on the part of the later copyists. The Leipzig school has done valuable work by insisting on the necessity of having exact facsimiles of the tablets which have come down to us ;
but when these facsimiles are made, there is a further necessity for
vigorously applying to them the canons of textual criticism. The time
is past when we can accept a reading simply because it is found on
one of the tablets of Assur-bani-paPs library. The Semitic character of Assyrian has been recognised from the first; the linguistic relationship of Accado-Sumerian has been a more dis
puted matter. Dr. Oppert long ago pointed out its agglutinative nature, and endeavoured to connect it with the Turanian or Ural-Altaic family
of speech. I followed in the same path in 1870, and have ever since felt convinced, for reasons which I need not here specify, that it would
eventually prove to be an early representative of the Ural-Altaic languages, though separated from the existing members of the family by a wide interval of time and space. Lenormant's attempts, however, to demonstrate its affinity with the languages of the Uralic branch were not very successful, and the adverse judgment of Dr. Donner seems to
have definitely decided the question against them. These attempts, in fact, brilliant as they were, were nevertheless premature, and, as I



APPENDIX I. 429
said in 1S77, until Accado-Sumerian phonology has been determined in its main outlines, it is useless to continue them. Before we can
compare Sumerian with other languages, we must first ascertain approxi
mately how it was pronounced, and what changes its pronunciation underwent in the course of centuries.
Thanks to Prof. Haupt and Dr. Ilommel, these conditions have now
been fulfilled. Our knowledge of Sumerian is still, it is true, imperfect ; but we now know enough about it to be able to compare it with other
languages with some chance of success. No unprejudiced student of linguistic science can resist the conviction that Dr. Hommel's com
parison of the Sumerian grammar and vocabulary with the grammar and vocabulary of the Turko-Tatar languages is founded on a solid
basis of fact. Some of his comparisons may indeed be disputable, but this does not affect the net result. He has succeeded in discovering the leading laws of phonetic change between Accado-Sumerian and the modern Turkish dialects, and has thus fulfilled the primary conditions
of proof demanded by linguistic science. The structure, the grammar, the phonology, the vocalic harmony and the vocabulary, all go to show that the primitive language of Chaldaia is a remotely ancient representative of the Altaic family of speech. The unexpected resemblances that can be pointed out between such widely-severed members of the same family as Accado-Sumerian on the one side, and the modern
Turkish idioms on the other, are a remarkable illustration of the fixity
of human language. In this, as in his historical combinations, Dr. Hommel's work has been at once so brilliant and so good, that I cannot
refrain from formally expressing my admiration of it. Doubtless he is
rash at times, but rashness is the privilege of the pioneer.
After what precedes, it seems hardly necessary to discuss seriously M. Halevy's curious contention that Accado-Sumerian had no existence Indeed, a writer who maintains that Mugheir is not "Ur of the Chaldees,"
appears to be beyond the reach of argument. But M. Halevy is not only a good Semitic scholar, he has also a keen eye to the weak points in his adversary's harness, and he has defended and re-modelled his paradox
with a perseverance and audacity worthy of a better cause Started
while as yet he was ignorant of Assyrian, it has been supported and preached by him with renewed vigour since his enrolment in the band of
Assyriologists. But his arguments and theory have alike changed a good deal during the progress of his Assyrian studies, although his main thesis remains unaltered, that "Accadian is not a language, but
a form of writing." His chief arguments, however, have been directed, not towards the demonstration of his own theory, but against the



430 APPENDIX I.
assumptions and assertions of certain Assyriologists. As these assump tions and assertions have too frequently heen based on hasty generalisations and imperfectly known facts, their demolition has been a corn,
paratively easy matter ; but it has left the chief question at issue—that
of the existence of Sumerian —wholly untouched. The early relations between Sumerians and Semites, the period when Sumerian became
au ' .ctinet language, the pronunciation and meaning of particular
Sumerian words — these are all subsidiary questions, the answers to
which may be right or wrong without affecting the main point in dispute. The views attacked by M. Halevy are for the most part views which I, at least, have never shared ; for years I have maintained that

1 while M. Halevy will bear me witness that I have myself long
ago called his attention to Semitisms in the Accado-Sumerian portion
of the bilingual inscriptions. To argue from the presence of these Semitisms that the rest of the texts must be in a strangely deformed
kind of Semitic, is an argumentum per saltum which, whatever force it
may have against the views of other xVssyriologists, has certainly never had any force against mine. Apart from arguments which merely criticise the peculiar historical
theories or misreadings of certain writers, I find M. Halevy advancing twc only of any apparent weight against the belief that Sumerian was
a real language. One of these is, that it is expressed by the same characters as Semitic Babylonian. The statement is not quite exact ; but
granting that it is, we have only to glance at the numerous languages which make use of the Latin alphabet to discover its weakness. Even
within the cuneiform system of writing itself, the Alarodian language of Van is written in the characters of the syllabary of Xineveh. M.
Halevy 's second argument is more specious, but unfortunately it is not correct. He asserts that the syntax and idioms of the Sumerian sentence are the same as those of the Assyrian sentence. But it is not
necessary to translate many of tin; bilingual hymns before discovering that the Semitic rendering not (infrequently differs a good deal from the Sumerian original ; and that even in such small matters of idiom as
the order of two parallel words, the Semitic scribe has not cared to
disturb the familiar Semitic expression by a literal translation of the Sumerian text. Thus where the Sumerian has "female and male,"
"day and night," "lire and stones," the Semitic version ostentatiously
1 See, for (rumple, my Babylonian Literature, p. 71.



ArrENDix i. 431
gives "male and female," "night and day," "stones and fire." It is the same disregard of exact rendering which causes different Sumerian words to be represented by the same Semitic one, or the same Semitic
word by different Sumerian ones. Nothing, however, can better illus
trate the diversity of the syntax of the two languages than the incorpo
ration of the pronouns and the extensive employment of postpositions which meet us in almost every line of a Sumerian text ; while the
agreement of Assyro-Baby Ionian and Sumerian in regard to the position of the verb is, as we have seen, one of those contraventions of Semitic
structure which indicate the disturbing influence of a foreign idiom on
the Semitic language of Babylonia and Assyria. M. Halevy's own explanation of the phenomena which, in the opinion of other Assyriologists, prove the existence of the Sumerian language, belongs rather to the age of the Kabbalists than to that of
linguistic science. It ignores all that we now know of the condition
of men in an early stage of culture, as well as of the development of a system of writing. It is neither more nor less than the supposition that the inventors of the Atbash and Kabbala presided over the
beginnings of cuneiform writing. It revives the old theory of a secret
writing invented by a primitive priesthood, and understood only by the initiated few. Such a theory is inconsistent with the doctrine of
evolution ; it inverts the history of writing, and ascribes what is neces
sarily a very late phenomenon to the first beginnings of a written literature. Men who are laboriously developing a system of writing out of pictorial hieroglyphs, are not the inventors of cipher and
" Atbash," or the elaborators of a secret script. A system of writing must have become old and widely used before the idea can arise of
evolving out of it a mysterious script whose meaning shall be known •only to a few. To refer such a script to a primitive age of culture is to misconceive utterly the conditions of human progress. The student of anthropology can only wonder that a theory of the kind can have
been seriously promulgated in this age of scientific knowledge. M. Halevy does indeed support his hypothesis by appealing to the fact that ideographs are of frequent occurrence in the Semitic inscrip
tions of Assyria and Babylonia, and that one of the chief difficulties
presented by Assyrian proper names arises from their being expressed ideograph ically. Rut the fact shows just the contrary of what he would have it prove. No one doubts that the ideographs occurring in a Semitic cuneiform text represent Semitic words, and not a system of
secret or "hieratic" writing : why, then, should they be supposed to
represent a system of secret writing when found in texts which do not



432 appendix i.
contain a single phonetically-written Semitic word? If M. Halevy'a " hieratic" script had ever existed, we should meet with it in inscriptions of whose Semitic character there is no question. But the best disproof of such a " hieratic'

system is the nature of so many of the
documents which, according to the Assyriologists, are composed in the
Sumerian language. A " hieratic" script would have been used for
magical texts and charms, conceivably also for religious literature, but certainly not for historical annals or the legal documents of private individuals. Yet we find historical texts like those of Khammuragas
written in this hypothetical secret writing, and—still more wonderful
to relate —with a translation in ordinary Semitic Babylonian at the
side ; while there are numberless deeds relating to the sale of slaves,
the loan of money or the purchase of property, composed in the same mysterious script and without any Semitic version attached to them.
To believe that such documents are drawn up in a hieratic system of
writing requires the robust faith of a mediaeval rabbi.
Apart, however, from a certain love of paradox which M. Halevy seems unable to resist, it is probable that this curious theory of a
Kabbalistic script as old as the oldest known inscriptions of Chaldsea
would never have been started, but for the premature theories, and
still more the erroneous readings, enounced by Assyriologists on the subject of Sumerian. The correct reading of Sumerian words is a
matter of extreme difficulty, and a considerable number of the readings,
given in earlier works on the language, and not unfrequently quoted at second-hand by philological paradoxers in support of their peculiar theories, were mere makeshifts, which had no pretensions to accuracy. What increases the difficulty is that the Semitic scribes, through whom we have to obtain our knowledge of the ancient language of Chaldjea,
were often as ignorant as ourselves, and either read phonetically what was really written ideographically, or else substituted a Semitic for
the genuine Accado-Sumerian word. It is only gradually that we are acquiring a better knowledge of the Accado-Sumerian vocabulary, and are becoming able to control the statements made by the compilers of
the " bilingual lists." Sumerian, it must be remembered, started with
pictorial hieroglyphs ; it was only by degrees that these came to beused phonetically ; and long before the system of writing had attained
completeness, it was adopted and further developed by a Semitic population. The cuneiform script is therefore like a palimpsest where the original Sumerian text has been overlaid by a Semitic one ; and in
order to reach this text, the decipherer must first work his way through
what overlays and conceals it. If we would read it rightly, we must



APPENDIX I. 433
divest jur minds of the prejudices derived from the study of its later
Semitic phase, and endeavour to interpret it hy the analogy of similar
ideographic systems of writing, like the old Egyptian or the Chinese. It is only in this way that we shall come to understand the principles
that have guided its growth. We shall then discover, for instance, that determinatives have played a much more important part in its constitution than the Assyriologists, or indeed the Semitic scribes themselves, have supposed. The determinatives retained by the Semitic syllabary are but a remnant of those that enter into the com
position of the old Sumerian ideographs. The ideograph of " water," for example, is not only a determinative in the compound character
which signifies " to drink" (nqk), but also in the word which denotes
a "storm" or "deluge" (inatu). Of equal importance with the recognition of this extended use of determinatives, is the recognition of a
principle which prevails widely in all pictorial systems of writing. When phonetic values are beginning to attach themselves to the
primitive ideographs, an attempt is made to assist the memory in remembering the pronunciation and meaning of a particular word, by writing it in ideographs which denote words whose sound and signifi
cation alike recall the word intended to be expressed. Thus " a fetter"
was called saggid or mgidd in Sumerian ; but it was represented by the
two characters, su, " a hand," and gid, " to extend," sugid being sufficiently near saggid in pronunciation, while the idea of "a fetter" was called up by that of "extending the hand." 1 At other times the
meaning and pronunciation of an ideograph were defined by coupling it
with another, which either gave its pronunciation—in which case the
ideograph became a simple determinative, as in A-pur, " water"— or else indicated the precise shade of meaning with which it was used. An
illustration of the latter mode of combining characters may be taken from
the Semitic texts composed in the court of Sargon at an epoch when the
cuneiform system of writing was still in process of formation. Here, for
example, we find the ideograph of hand—idu in Semitic —further defined by the attachment to it of the character which had the phonetic value
of gap, and accordingly reminded the reader of hap, " a hand." It is
from a neglect of these and similar devices common to all pictorial
forms of script, that the Sumerian vocabulary has been filled by Assy
riologists with monstrous or hybrid forms. It is only of late that
Assyrian students have begun to realise that the characters of an ideo
graphic system of writing are seldom to be read phonetically. When
1 W. A. I. v. 29, 71., 41, 47.
2F



434 AFPENDIX I.
a word is expressed by a combination of character, its pronunciation can only be recovered either by a gloss or by a comparison of the various modes in -which it is written. The error of the Semitic scribes,
who read ki-gal as higal instead of iar, has been too often repeated in
these latter days. It cannot be supposed that the criticisms of a scholar so erudite and
keen-sighted as M. Halevy should remain wholly barren. In fact, they
have helped to further the progress of science, though not exactly in the direction he desired or intended. His earlier objections led to
Prof. Schrader's discovery that the characters of the cuneiform script had all been catalogued and named in the Accado-Sumerian period, and that many of the values assigned to them in the third column of
the so-called syllabaries are merely Semitised forms of these names.
He has himself done much towards forcing his brother Assyriologists to recognise, not only that a goodly number of the Accadian texts belong to the Semitic period and were composed or re-modelled by Semitic scribes, but also that from the first what he has termed the
rebus played an important part in the formation of compound ideo
graphs and ideographic expressions. The rebus was always a favourite plaything in the hands of Semitic litterateurs, though it attained its
greatest proportions in the later ages of cuneiform writing, when the
ideograph of " crown" was used to denote izzu, " strong," because one
of its values was gir, which also signified " power," and the name of
I ) alius was written Dari-musu, in order to assimilate it to the Assyrian
dam and musu, "everlasting" of "name." But the theory itself which M. Halevy 's "rebus" has been called upon to support, will share
the fate of similar curiosities of philological literature, and be classed with Sir William Jones's denial of the existence of Zend, and Du<rald Stewart's demonstration that Sanskrit was an invention of the Brah
mans, palmed off upon the unsuspecting mind of the modern European. M. Halc'vy, however, is not alone in denying to the Sumerians the
credit of originating the culture which most Assyriologists ascribe to
them. I cannot pronounce an opinion on Prof. De Lacouperie's theory that the ancestors of the Chinese were once in contact, probably in Elam, with the inventors of the cuneiform system, of writing, since I
am not a Sinologist; though I find it difficult to believe that "the Bak tribes" could have carried not only the forms of the Sumerian
ideographs, but also their pronunciation with so little alteration as Prof.
De Lacouperie maintains, across nearly the whole length of barbarous Asia. But there are other writers who would substitute for the Sume
rians of the inscriptions the shadowy race of Cushites ; and since in



APPENDIX I. 435
recent years the Cushite theory has been revived and defended by so
great an authority as Lepsius, it is necessary for me to state in a few words why I feel myself compelled to reject it. That .Babylonian tradition brought the early civilisation of the country from the waters of the Persian Gulf is perfectly true, and we have seen that the evidence of the monuments tends to corroborate it. It is also perfectly true
that there seems to have been intercourse, if not between Chaldsea and Egypt, at all events between Chaldaaa and the Sinaitic Peninsula, as far back as the days of the Fourth Egyptian Dynasty, and there is no reason why this intercourse should not have brought with it certain
elements of Egyptian art and civilisation. Put the cuneiform system
of writing v;as already developed, and the culture of Tel-loh had already entered upon its later stage. There is nothing that would lead us to
believe that the beginnings of this writing and culture came to Eridu from abroad.
If Lepsius were right, the primitive hieroglyphs out of which the cuneiform characters were evolved would offer resemblances to the hiero
glyphs of Egypt. But this is not the case. With the exception of such
obvious symbols as a circle to denote the sun, which occur in every
pictorial system of writing, the ideographs of Chaldaia and Egypt have nothing in common. Even the idea of divinity is represented differently in them. In Chalda3a it is expressed by an eight-rayed star ; in Egypt,
by a stone-headed axe. The existence of the famous " Cushite race," in
fact, depends on a misinterpretation of a verse of the Old Testament,
eked out by the loose terminology of Greek writers who spoke of " Ethiopians" in the east as well as in the west. The basis of the whole
Cushite theory are the words of Gen. x. 8, "And Cush begat Nimrod."
Critics, however, have long since agreed that the passage about Niinrod is a later insertion in the ethnographical table of Genesis, and the preceding verses show that in the original text Cush is understood in the same geographical sense as elsewhere in the Old Testament. Properly speaking, Cush denoted Ethiopia or Nubia, and was a name borrowed from the Egyptians, who called that part of the world Kesh ; but since the southern coasts of Arabia were peopled by colonies from Ethiopia, it was further extended to them. The regions adjacent to Cush, Phut
or Punt on the Somali coast, Egypt, and even Canaan, with its Philistine emigrants from the Delta, were described as the children of Cush, just as the Libyans or Lehabim were described as the children of Egypt
There is nothing to show that between the geographical Cush of Gen. x. 6, 7, and Cush the father of Nimrod, there is anything more than a
similarity of name; for aught we know, the latter may be the Sumerian
2 f2



436 APPENDIX I.
god of darkness and eclipse, Kus or Kusi. In Gen ii. 13, it is true, a
land of Cush is brought into connection with Assyria and Babylonia;1
but the text here is probably corrupt. Instead of Cush, the original reading was probably Cash, that is Kassi or Kossaeans, the vowel a having slipped into the Kthibh from the q'rt. It is possible that the father of Niinrod was also Cash rather than Cush, in which ca.se Nimrod
would be a representative of the Kossaeans. However this may be, Cush is never found elsewhere in the Bible with any other meaning than that
of Nubia or southern Arabia, while the Kusu of the Assyrian inscriptions means Nubia alone. The hypothesis started by Mr. Pinches2 that the
Chaldseans came out of Kappadokia because a Kappadokran district is
called Kusu on an Assyrian tablet, reminds us of the ethnographical speculations of a former age, which identified the Cymry with the Cimbri, and derived them both from Gomer. For the Cushites, Mr. Bertin would, like M. HaleVy, substitute the
Semites ; only, unlike M. Halevy, he believes that the Semites, after inventing the cuneiform system of writing, handed it over to the Sume
rians. But this is to invert the real order of events. The arguments
brought forward by Mr. Bertin in support of his thesis tell a contrary
tale ; the primitive ideographs and their primitive phonetic values are Sumerian and not Semitic. When Mr. Bertin can show that the
Semitic vis was used by the Surnerians as a phonetic value of the
ideograph for " head," while the value of sag was not known to the
early Semitic texts, it will be time to listen to his theory. Meanwhile
we may rest content with the old doctrines, however commonplace
they may be, engaged in the less ambitious task of strengthening and
testing their foundations, and working out the problems which they
still present.
1 The Asshur of verse 14, however, is not Assyria, but the city of Assur.
Gihon, which Avatered Cush, seems to be a Hebraised form of G-ikhinnu, " a snare," borrowed from the Sumerian gi-khan (W. A. I. iv. 22, 31). Gi-khan i< usually written sA-khan, with the determinative of "a cord," and sx-khna
(pronounced gikhari) is said, in W. A. I. ii. 35, 6, to be a name of the
Euphrates. We must not forget that the first syllable of the classical
" Kusstean" gives us the vowel o instead of a. Gikhinnu will have been assimilated to the Hebrew word Gikhon.

MR. G. SMITH'S ACCOUNT OF THE TEMPLE OF BEL.4
" I iiave discovered a Babylonian text, giving a remarkable account
of the Temple of Belus at Babylon ; and as my approaching departure
for Nineveh does not allow me time to make a full translation of the
document, I have prepared a short account for your readers, giving the
principal points in the arrangement and dimensions of the buildings. Additional interest attaches to this inscription from the fact that it
is the first time any detailed description of a temple has been found in the cuneiform texts ; it thus supplies the first information as to the
dimensions of the great temples, and it is fortunate that the one
described was the most famous in the valley of the Euphrates.
The importance of this temple is well known ; it was the grandest
religious edifice in the country, the centre of the national worship, and
one of the wonders of the capital, Babylon. This temple was founded centuries before Babylon became the chief city in the state, and retained its fame even down to Koman times. Herodotus and Strabo have given us accounts of the Temple of Belus,
the former representing the principal building as one stade in length and breadth, and as consisting of eight stages or towers one above
another, forming a pyramid, the highest stage being the sanctuary. Strabo states that this building was a stade in height, a stade being
supposed to ecpial about GOO English feet. The height given by Strabo for the tower of the Temple of Belus has already been considered very cpiestionable (see Bawlinson's ' An
cient Monarchies,' vol. ii. p. 515), and, now that we have the dimen
sions of the building, must be rejected. First, I must remark on the Bal^lonian measures used, that they
are principally the cubit, ecpial to about 1 foot 8 inches English • and the gar or sa, equal to 12 cubits, or 20 feet English ; but there is
another series of numbers used in measuring, consisting apparently of
* Atheiucum, Feb. 12th, 1876.



438 APPENDIX II.
numbers of barleycorns arranged in sixties ; thus the first number is a
length of 11-33-20, which consists of 11 x 3600 + 33 x 60 + 20 bailey
corns, in all 41,600 barleycorns, or 1155 teet, 7 inches. The barleycorn was the standard unit of measure among the Babylonians, and for this reason was used sometimes in measures of length without the other
terms. First in the tablet we have the measures of the outer court, called
the 'Grand Court,' which is given as 11-33-20 in length (that is. about 1156 feet) and 9* in breadth (that is, 900 feet). There is a
calculation as to the area of this court, which I pass over, and come to the next court, called the ' Court of Tshtar and Zamama.' This
space is reckoned as 10*33 - 20 in length (1056 feet) and 4 - 30 (450 feet) in breadth. There is again here a calculation of area, which I omit.
Round the court were six gates admitting to the temples. There
were, 1, the grand gate ; 2, the gate of the rising sun (east) ; 3, the great gate ; 4, the gate of the colossi ; 5, the gate of the canal ; and 6, the gate of the tower-view.
The next division is the space or platform apparently walled, and called a kl-galli, sur, or bind. It is uncertain if this was paved, and
its extent is also uncertain. It is stated as a square, three ku in length
and three Ku in breadth, but the value of the lai is uncertain. The
four Avails faced the cardinal points, in this agreeing with the other
parts, all the buildings having their sides west, north and south. There were four gates, one in the centre of each side of this division :
1, the gate of the rising sun (east); 2, the southern gate ; 3, the gate
of the setting sun (west) ; 4, the northern gate. Inside stood some building or enclosure, the name of which is
damaged. It was 10 gar long and 10 gar broad (200 feet by 200), connected with the great Ziggurat or tower, which was the inner and
crowning edifice of the group. Round the base of the Ziggurat or
tower were ranged the chapels or temples of the principal gods, on its
four sides, and facing the cardinal points. On the eastern side stood a sanctuary or temple, 70 or 80 cubits long and 40 cubits broad (117 or 133 feet by 67 feet), with sixteen shrines, the principal being the shrines devoted to the god Nebo and Tasmit his wife. Xebo was considered the eldest son of Bel, the great
deity of the temple. On the northern side stood two temples, one devoted to the god Ea, the other to Nusku. The temple of Ea was 85 cubits long and 30
broad (142 feet by 50 feet), and that of Nusku was a square, 35 cubits
each way (58 feet bv 58 i»p*\



THE TEMPLE OF BEL. 439
On the southern side stood a single temple dedicated to the two great
gods, Anu and Bel. This was 70 cubits long and 30 eubits broad
(117 feet by 50 feet).
On the western side were the principal buildings, consisting of a Rouble house, with a court between the two wings. On the one side
the wing was 100 cubits long and 20 cubits broad (16G feet by 3-1 feet).
On the other side the wing was 100 cubits long and 65 cubits broad
(1GG feet by 108 feet), and the space between them was 35 cubits wide
(58 feet). The building at the back was 125 cubits long and 30 cubits
broad (208 feet by 50 feet). I do not properly comprehend the dis
position of the buildings on this side, and my description of the position of the western temples must be taken as conjectural. In these western chambers stood the couch of the god, and the throne of gold mentioned
by Herodotus, besides other furniture of great value. The couch is
stated to have been 9 cubits long and 4 cubits broad (15 feet by 6 feet,
8 inches).
In the centre of these groups of buildings stood the grandest portion
of the whole pile, the great Zigguiat, or temple-tower, built in stages, its sides facing the cardinal points.
The bottom or first stage was a square in plan, 15 gar in length
and breadth, and oh gar in height (300 feet square, 110 feet high). This stage appears to have been indented or ornamented with buttresses. The next or second stage of the tower was also square, being 13 gar
in length and breadth, and 3 gar in height (260 feet square, 60 feet
high). The epithet applied to this stage is obscure ; it had probably
sloping sides. The third stage differs widely from the lower ones, and commences
a regular progressive series of stages, all of equal height. It was 10 gar in length and breadth, and 1 gar in height (200 feet square, 20 feet
high). The fourth stage was 8 1
.- gar in length and breadth, and 1 gar in
height (170 feet square, 20 feet high). The fifth stage was 7 gar in length and breadth, and 1 gar in height
(140 feet square, 20 feet high). Probably by accident, the dimensions of the sixth stage of the tower are omitted in the inscription, but they can be easily restored in accordance with the others. This stage must
have been 5h gar in length and breadth, and 1 gar in height (110 feet square, 20 feet high). On this was raised the seventh stage, which was the upper temple or
sanctuary of the god Eel. This building had a length of 4 gar, a



440 APPENDIX II.
breadth of 3 J gar, and a height of 2 J gar (80 feet long, 70 feet broad,
and 50 feet high). Thus the whole height of this tower above its foundation was 15 gar, or 300 feet, exactly equal to the breadth of the base ; and as the foun
dation was most probably raised above the level of the ground, it would
give a height of over 300 feet above the plain for this grandest of Baby
lonian temples. The only ruin now existing at or near Babylon which can be supposed to represent the temple of Belus is the mound and enclosure of Babil, the ruins corresponding fairly with the account of these structures in
the Greek authors and in the inscription. The sides of the building
face the cardinal points, like those in the inscription ; the remains of the two sides of the enclosure now existing indicate a circumference
about equal to the Greek measurement, and slightly in excess of that in the inscription ; but it must be remembered that the exact length
of the Babylonian measures is not known, and there are different
opinions even as to the length of the Greek stade, while the present remains of the wall require careful measurement to determine more
exactly their length and the dimensions they indicate. On the other
side of the Euphrates stands a ruin, Birs Nimroud, also consisting of
an enclosure, various temples, and a temple-tower ; but this represents the site of the temple of Nebo at Borsippa, and its angles, instead of
its sides, face the cardinal points, while not a single one of its known
dimensions agrees with the corresponding point in the inscription. The mound of Babil, which is already identified by the best authorities
with the temple of Belus, consists now of the lower stage of the tower and the ruins of the buildings round it."

oikamme with dim in the ideographic representation of dimme, "ghost" or
" female colossus," seems to show that kammeda must mean " cloud-like" or " unsubstantial."
2 Rikani (as in line 47, amur rikani) is akin to rikdtu, by which bar,
"bright," is rendered (W.A.I, ii. 30, 35). 3 The Assyrian damil, " a fold," is borrowed from the Accadian tabba. The Accadian sur(ra) is rendered by damil and kapalu, "to fold," in W.A.I, iii 70, 159. It is here represented by izkhad (as in W.A.I, v. 19, 29), which
Zimmem reads itspa from etsepu. For damu=kilallan, " double," see W. A. I. v. 15, 44.

Accadian sabba, " head," instead of the Sumerian sagga, showing the extent
to which this originally Sumerian text has been interpolated by the Accadian
scribes of northern Babylonia. If gisal, "a ravine" (iii. 36), is Semitic, it
will be an example of a Semitic word foisted into the text by the scribes of Accad. Lines 36 and 37, in fact, are mere amplifications of the original line 38. 3 The Accadian sakhil has been borrowed from the Semitic sikkur, but
the change in the pronunciation shows that the borrowing was on the part
of the people, and not of the literary class, and that it probably goes back
to an early period. As lines 49 and 50, however, repeat the same statement, it is probable that line 50 is an interpolation. In line 51 the Sumerian sigar has, as usual, been confounded by the litterati of Sargon's court
with the Semitic sigaru, "a cage" or "fetter," the Accadian form being simar (W.A.I, iv. 18, 29).

Sus'ub is rendered by the Assyrian esipu and us'ap, and sus'ubu, "a girdle," was a literary loan-word in place of the native Semitic dumsu. Instead of susubbi lalaghgha-lil, the Semitic version has

5 SurwppA, from rapti, "to be weak," Heb. replunm. See Zimmern, Busspsalmen, pp. 26, 27. Jensen is wrong in making it "fever." In W.A.I, iv.
15, 38, it means " weakness." The Accadian equivalent signifies " one who is gone to his rest," and, as Zimmern shows, is probably to be read seddhe
or sede (in W.A.I, iv. 15, 38, seddhe is translated kutstsu, " skinlessness"). From tins the Semites would have borrowed their sSdu (Heb. sMd, see above, p. 441), for which no satisfactory Semitic etymology can be found. Sedu is
also the Semitic equivalent of the Accadian alad, or " warrior spirit," which
along with the lemma, or " divine colossus,'' guarded the entrance to a palace
or temple. Zimmern is doubtless right in holding that the collection of
.Magical Texts was known to the Assyrian scribes under the title of surpu in consequence of the first tablet of the scries having begun with this word, e See next page.

7. Above they roar, below they peep ; 8. the bitter breath of the gods are they. 9. The great worms 2 who have been let loose from heaven are they !
10. The mighty ones (khufi, W.A.I, ii. 37, 13, Strass. 3440) whose roar is in the city ; 11. who cast down the water of heaven, sons who have come forth from the earth !

21. The god of the man, shepherd who lookest after the sheep

Assyrian tarputu (W.A.I, v. 38, 27; 40, 35), the Heb. teraphim, which Dr.
Xeubauer has already connected with the root raphd. The worship of the
terdphim indicates an early ancestor-worship among the Semites. 6 Munassir, see W.A.I, iv. 16, 54; in the Atarpi legend (iii. 56) the Airgod is said to have "ruined" (issur) the field.
1 Here the Assyrian translator has used the feminine alidti, hereby getting into a difficidty, as the demon was called "son" (maru) in the preceding line.
Ud-gal: the Ud-gallu is conjoined with the tir-bat, or " beast of death," in K3938, 6, and in S 477, ii. 11, the mention of "the flesh of the ud-da" follows that of the flesh of the gazelle, of man, of the dog, of the boar, of
the ass, of the horse, and of the wild ass. In R 149, udda-kkul is " poison."
Perhaps the udda was a species of serpent. At all events, in W. A. I. v. 41, 6, umii is the synonym of nwimassu, "reptile."

have been worn on " the head of a female slave," the Accadian equivalent
of suku being sola (11. 68 —72). The latter is translated ipru, "a veil" (ii.
39, 50, stba in line 53 being nallasu, " clothing"). Compare epartum =
nakhlaptu, "a veil" (W.A.I, v. 28, 68). Hence "a dark veil" is vaguely rendered siratu, "ornament," in W.A.I, v. 16, 17. Xisuthros, in the story
of the Deluge, tells his wife to " fold up (epi) the veil" of Gisdhubar and
place it nn his head. The ideographic equivalent of nindabu, "a free-will
offering," is miku Innana, " the veil of the goddess," in reference to the sacri
fice of their virginity by the women of Babylonia in honour of Istar. The
reference in the text is to a sort of monastic vow, whereby a man placed himself under the protection of the deity, and, as in the case of Gisdhubai, by wearing a veil on his head became proof against all evil spells. a In K 4207, 15 (ms)lib-sa-an-tuk-a (sagar-tugga) is rendered by biriita.

1 The printed text has, falsely, Dazarma.
- The three lines 23— 25 are evidently an interpolation. They interrupt
the context, as the father and mother of the primitive god of Nipur must
naturally have been followed by the mother of the primitive god of Eridu
the Moon-god, the Sun-god and Istar, belonging to a wholly different and
later theological system—while the alliteration in the Semitic version of
the 25th line shows that it must be the original of which the Accadian is a
translation. It contains a play upon the name of Istar: " nis Istari sa ana kibiti sa Aniinaki istdnu la isaru (istaru)"

synonymous terms.

1 Gikhinu, from the Accadian gikhan (also written sA.-khan). In W.A.I. ii. 35, 6, we are told that Gikhan (sA-khan) was a synonym of the Euphrates, which explains the Gihon of Gen. ii. 13, where the word has been assimi
lated to the Heb. glkhun, " a spring."
2 In the Semitic version ikhme, " scorches" (?). 3 Accadian uru. 4 Ittu, "sign," "omen." 5 Fragments of Accadian from the words put into the mouth of Ea in other magical texts inserted here by way of a charm.

read kMlpaUi, and compared with the Aramaic khilpd, " sedge." It was a plant that grew on the mountains (ii. 28. 16, 17). 7 The Semitic translator, in his word-for-word rendering, has here produced an extraordinary violation of Semitic grammar :
" (with) the plant that gladdens life cover like [as it were] and enclose" (!).
8 Agu-ziga in Accadian, literally "the hour of the fresh breeze." Thus
we have the following hymn (D. T. 57, Rev.) : (1) " At dawn (agu-ziga) the bird proclaims not the fresh breeze (ziga) ; (2) the waters of the deep (gurra)

1 Accadian gu-kud, elsewhere written K&(gu)-kud. 2 In the Accadian, " the blessed handmaid turns not back her hand."
3 In translating "one that exists not" (literally, "none is"), the Semitic
scribe has mistaken the meaning of the Accadian mulu nu-tilla, "the eunuch."

1 hatalik means "he was king," not "he took counsel," here, as is shown
by its equivalent in the Accadian text (d-gdgd). The Semitic imrsu,
"adviser," has been adopted in the Accadian version, pointing (like the
mention of Sin, Samas and Istar) to the composition of the poem in the Semitic era.
2 The Accadian text reads, "at the beginning they beset with violence the festival of the Moon-god."
" The Accadian imitates the Semitic idiom in this sentence, proving that the Semitic version is the older.

1 The Semitic version is different here : " the news is that of my son the
Moon-god, who is grievously eclipsed in heaven." The text published by
Haupt has, " the son of the prince Nannar."
2 In the Accadian, " men of death." 3 In Haupt's text, " they seek the land, upon the world like a storm they
BWOOp."
* Lines 26 — 44 have been published by Haupt in his Akkaclische und
Sumerische Keilschrifttexte, ii. pp. 76, 77. 5 The Semitic samlin (Heb. simldh) has been introduced into the Accadian

" The smiter of the neck, the falchion, the blade that proclaims
me Anu, 2 (I bear). 2. That from whose hand the mountain escapes not, the lasso oi
battle, (I bear). 3. The spear (Sum. agar) of the hero, the long shaft of battle, (I bear). 4. The strap which is bound fast to the man, the bow (qastu) of
the deluge (abubi),3 (I bear).
1 This line is evidently corrupt, and since the Semitic qarradu has been introduced into the Accadian text, it must be regarded as an interpolation. The line must originally have run, urn-sag eri bab-sig-s'ig, "the hero has carried to the city."'
8 In the original Accadian, "the blade, of my divinity."
3 Is this an allusion to the "bow" of Gen. ix. 13 — 16? At any rate the
original phrase, "the bow of the deluge," is Accadian (gisme nuitu), and the word gisme, "bow," is rendered not by the usual Assyrian midpanu, but by qastu, the Heb. qesheih. [For the pronunciation of gis-bam. "bow," see
W. A. I. ii. 39, 31.] A fragmentary text gives an account of the arming of
Merodach with "the bow of Anu" in "the assembly of the gods" before his combat witli Tiainat, and one of the constellations was named "the star of the bow."

1 This is the Semitic paraphrase, the translator having punned upon the
resemblance of the Semitic sari, " winds," to the Accadian sarra, " the hosts
of the firmament." The original Accadian text is literally, " which to the dwelling-place of the hosts of the firmament turn the head."
4 Literally, " stone of light."

is a loan-word from the Accadian balay, expressed by an ideograph which is translated egH, "to surround," and amamu, "to bind" (W.A.I, v. 27, 10). In W.A.I, v. :)-2. ('2— 65, tiggii ("a ring," from egu) is a synonym oikhalhhallatu ("a chain") and wnqu, "a ring," and is represented by kamlcammat
tipwrri, " a ring of copper," and kamlcammat ubani, " a finger-ring," preceded by the determinative of "vessel" or "copper" as well as by the Accadian lalab (written balag-lab, preceded by the same determinative).

neous; cause of further changes; nomad
irruptions and amalgamation of the two
races also modified both religion and civilisation : absorption of the deities into Baalim and Ashtaroth ; the gods of Accad transformed into the Semitic family; all outside were the servants and slaves who carried the messages of Baal everywhere ; chaos, night and foreign gods considered hostile ; Satan, in pure Semitic faith, an angel of the Lord, 346-7. Fire-god partly absorbed by the Sun-god;
his attributes, privileges and rank ; hymn to him, 179-80; the fire-stick
and its ideographs, Gibil or Kibir, and worship as Savul ; afterwards considered the same as Merodach and Sanias, 180-1.

in pre-historic Egypt; but such barba
rous practices almost unknown to the Semites, 83-4 and notes.
Human shape and character of the gods contrasted with the animal-headed deities of Egypt; harmony of Semitic be
lief that the Creator made man in his own image ; tendency of art among the
two races ; the winged bulls at the
entrance of the temples, and the eagleheaded cherubs on each side of the sacred tree, were survivals of a time when the gods were worshipped under similar forms, proved by the written texts, 278-9. Hymn to Bel-Merodach in the beginning of Nisan, 261-2 ; hymns to the Sun-god of Sippara, a clue to the relative anti
i quity of the rest ; used daily in the
service of the temple of Samas ; and at sunset, sunrise, and on special occasions; all of Semitic origin, and belong to the time when Sippara and Accad were great centres of influence ; internal evi
dence of the period when they were composed, as during the reigns of Sar
gon, Naram-Sin and Nebuchadnezzar; general inferences respecting the rest,
341-4; hymns used in spells implied a
higher cult than mere magic; the conception of a creative deity necessarily
introduced praise, adoration, and a fixed ritual ; contrast with Shamanism, 355.
Incantations, exorcismsand magic, limited to the present life : Chalda?an belief in a ghost-world, or continued existence after death, under Mul-lil as lord, only vague and shadowy, 358.

Ashtoreth ; sometimes a male divinity; the Istars of Accad and Erech different, 253 ; Istar ceased to be the pure goddess of the evening star, and was regarded by the Semites as the goddess of fruitfulness and love; the voluptuousness and debasing character of her worship denounced by the prophets of Israel, and shocked the Greeks; diffusion of her cult and its abominable rites, 266-7; the gentler phase, when not
tainted by popular frenzy, said to have had a humanising effect upon the cultivated classes; addressed in the peni
tential psalms as Gula, Nana and Milkat, 267-8 ; Accadian hymns to Istar,
268-70 ; the Syrian deity warlike, and worshipped by the Hittites and their
disciples in Asia Minor; the Gulli and Amazons; descent of Artemis and Aphrodite; story of Semiramis; different phases of her cult, and temples at Nine

Lehman on Adraminelecli and Adar-Milkat. 7, note. Lenonnant Francois on the Sacred Books of Chaldsea ; contents of the two main collections; a third series consisted of

older compositions, as the Epic of Gisdhubar formed from earlier poems on the exploits of Herakles of Erech ; the Descent of Istar exhibits plainly bor
rowed passages: the penitential psalms,
hymns and magical texts, show the same
traces of repetition and borrowing;

god were unknown, and only pure Sha
manism prevailed, 327-8.
