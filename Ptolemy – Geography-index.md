Preface



PREFACE
C
LAUDIUS PTOLEMY {ca. 90-168 A.D. j holds a place among the
fort-most ot those who have made contributions, to the science of geography.
It is nut a little; surprising that there has never appeared a complete English, Ger¬
man, or French translation of his work in this field, often as his name is to be nwt
with in the literature which treats of the t\pa ns ion of geographical knowledge
and the cartographical records of the same.
In his Introduction Professor Fischer has called attention to tilt lack of a
thoroughly satisfactory edition ofPtoltmjf’s Geography, and iti the preparation of
tins translation based upon the generally recognized best Latin andGreek texts,anti,
it may be further noted, upon the critical texts and studies of Wilberg and Mullet,
this puzzling fact sEamis in the forefront of the difficulties with which it has been
necessary to contend, No one edition is alone a safe guide.
There arc doubtless imperfections in tlic translation; it, however, has been done
with great care and labor, l hat there is a lack of exact agreement w ith this or that
text will be noted by (hose who critically examine the translation. With very
few exceptions geographical names have been given as in the original Greek or
Latin texts. Occasionally the modern English word has been preferred. The inten¬
tion has been to give that reading which. In tlie translator** best judgment, is a
faithful presentation of what Ptolemy intended to set down in his great work- As
close an adherence to the original as possible has beat the aim, never overlooking
the fact that not a few of his sentences, particularly in Kook I and also in Book V II,
arc considerably involved. Jt has been stated that this fact may have contributed
much to deter readers from a critical study of his Geography, particularly of his
Book I, but which, of course, must be read tube able to understand the remaining
seven.
It k in the field of mathematical geography that Ptolemy^ fame as a geographer
especially rests, into which field he was ltd th rough his interest in mathematical
and astronomical studies. Herein, it may he stated, his was the most considerable
attempt to place the study of geography on ft scientific basis, giving to him, there¬
fore, lirtt plate among the ancient writers on the subject. Perhaps it is the com¬
pleteness of his system, as has teen noted, that especially contributed to that end.
There is in it the appearance of a finality, a complete summing up of what had
been contributed by those who had preceded him ■ by Hipp.ireiius, by Eratos¬
thenes, and especially by Marinus. His work is indeed the mam foundation r.u
our geographical knowledge ol the. classical day -<l 1 he whole ot modern cartogra¬
phy has developed from his Atlas/’
He made hut little contribution to descriptive geography, noting, as he docs,
the imperfect character of his own infbttnation concerning many parts HJ. the
earth, chiefly because of their size and their remoteness, and the difficulty with
winch one is confronted in an effort to discriminate between statements made by
[ xiii ]



PTOLEMY'S GEOGRAPHY
geographers who Imd preceded him, and between statements also to 1>l- iound in
itinerary records, in the records of travelers and explorers,
Marinus (ca. 70-130 A, 1)() appears to have been regarded his most reliable
source and inspiration, whom he praises for his diligence and sound judgment, and
whom he seems to have followed closely; yet lie points out his many defects.
In chapters six to twenty of Rook T we find his principal references 10 this
noted Tyrian, hit close contemporary, and it is from Ptolemy alone we have prac¬
tice l ly our only information concerning that great geographer,
Ptolemy considered it as his chief tush to reform the map of the inhabited earth \
perhaps we may well say ike considering, as he did, that the only trust¬
worthy method in map-making had its basis in the determination of the latitude
and longitude of places.
Professor Lise her, a> will be noted, has presented a most admirable summary of
Ptolemy’s assumed task as a geographer, his methods and achievements, his relation
to Marinus and to certain others who were his predecessor* in this particular field, to
the relation of text and maps in bis Geography, to the renaissance of Ptolemy’s
Geography more than a millennium after his day, in which revival Dorknus Nicolaus
German us was a great leader.
In h is Rooks II VII lie lists more than eight thousand localities, giving what
he thought to he the correct latitude and longitude of each, in which, of course
there arc numerous errors, as we know to-day. The remarkable fact, however, is
that he was so nearly accurate in his records] that Ptolemy purposely falsified his
records h hardly to he entertained for a moment,
Jt would be a task of years to cany through to completion a comparative .study
of the geographical information which we find set down in the various manu¬
script and printed editions of his work.
Since the issue of the first printed edition of Ptolemy's Geography ifiorc than
fifty edition* have appeared, varying greatly in content}; and in valuej in same of
these the text is incomplete, and in many the ma|*s do not appear.
Good editions of Ptolemy arc regarded as items of great interest by those l ibraries
and private collectors so fortunate as to posses copies.
More than forty manuscript copies of the geography are known, and here again
there is great variation in the status;. ri he mi mix: r of those copies which can he con¬
sidered fairly complete is not large, many are but fragments. The fine existing
manuscript copies are in both Latin and Greek, the former dating from the Ren¬
aissance period or from the early fifteenth century, the latter as early as the eleventh
century, and are the oldest ones known. Of his Geography in Arabic there is a
fine copy in Constantinople dating from about the middle of the fifteenth century,
and there arc a few fragmentary copies extant
In Europe during recent years a very considerable amount of scholarly research
activity has been turned to an investigation of rite character and influence of Vtol
.inyV Geography. Prominent among those who have lalwrcd diligently within
ihi', field may lie named my very good friend Professor Lischcr, Paul Dingo,

Jt [ttrlirtps first would Ih: observed by one whotriLically examines his maps, that
in what were remote regions his mast striking errors are to be noted. Important
and lengthy lists of errors have been well referred to by certain Ptsdemy students;
that is, to certain, coasts, for example, set down as rivers, to the names, of certain
mountains given ns those of trilws, to a number of actually mistaken names, to
certain names doubled or trebled, to the addition of an initial letter to certain
names, One can easily become confused in an attempt to seaivlt out witAt we fllftj1
call the correct spelling of very many of the names as id dawn in (lie various
•editions of hes Geography. No specnil attempt, in this translation,, has been fTitfdt
to pass upon the relative merit of the variations; it indeed will be found that many
of the names recorded in the text do not exactly agree with the Ebner manuscript
map records. That has been selected which, as before noted, hassecaned to the trans¬
lator to be t h e pre fe rablc onc. Here again tlic reader may be referred to such cri tical
Judies as those of W ilbcrg and Muller and to the studies of a runnhcr of modem In¬
vestigators of high rank.
A reference may well be [Hade to Ins recorded length and breadth of the inhabited
tart In He seems to have been the first to give to the terms length and breadth the
designation longitude and latitude. Ik greatly exaggerated the total longitude of
the inhabited earth, and yet he reduced this from that given by Mar inns and by
others who had preceded ]dm. He increased by almost one third the length of the
Mediterranean j he makes the Indian Ocean an enclosed sea by joining the south¬
eastern region of Asia to southern Africa, and by those who accepted Ids geogra¬
phy this might Well have been the reason for less vigorous and less early effort to
reach the Indies of the Hast by an attempt to drenmnavigatc Africa; he- increased
very greatly the size of [he island Ceylon (Taprobana). Yet who is there who
will not be remarkably impressed with tbe near approach to accuracy of Ills records,
in the main, not forgetting the time in which he lived? Let the concluding para¬
graph of Professor Tisclicr’s Introduction here be read.
To this translation there has been added, in full disc reproduction, the twenty
seven maps of the Codex Ehmriarttfs now belonging to The New York Public
Library, to the very remarkable importance of which manuscript attention has
been called. Two other maps have been added: the Kuysch Map in the 150S
printed edition of Ptolemy^ Geography, and the New World Map ill the 1521
printed edition, having the name "America” conspicuously appearing Ptros* what
we now call South America, where Waldseemnller, in his great World Map of
1507, had placed it.
The Codex Woerawaris atopy of the Geography prepared by Domras Nicolaus

manuscript being largely taken as a basis Tor the earliest printed editions, (Men¬

Introduction



INTRODUCTION
>A«A<
O
N the occasion of his vl&it in Fddkirch I Jfir&[ hoard from Dr, Edward Luther
Stevenson that he purposed translating the text of Ptolemy’s Geography
into English, Since such a translation dots not c xiM, either in English or in Ger¬
man, the information pleased me very much.
Of course I did not conceal front myself and iny courageous and enterprising
friend the difficulty of the task. A critical edition of the Greek text which would
meet all justifiable demands has never yet appeared, nor is there any Latin, Italian
or French translation extant that reproduces adequately the previously published
Greek text. Dr, Stevenson knew all thui; nevertheless lie lias taken upon himself
the exceedingly meritorious labor of translating the eight honks of Ptolemy's Geog¬
raphy into English* After much painstaking toil the work is at last successfully
completed,
Since in the course of these years T have always testified to a lively interest in
the translation, it did not come to me as something unexpected when Dr. Steven¬
son asked me several months ago to write an introduction to his successfully com¬
pleted translation of the Geography.
The wish of a scholar so illustrious for his i n vest i gat ion s in the held of historical
geography and cartography, that l would write aai introduction to his translation,
I could all the more readily comply with, since my own comprehensive introduc¬
tion to the great Vatican publication of Ptolemy: Claudil Ptoletmd Geogr&phim
CIr&illttf Cudetc graCCtis $2 photoiypice depicttis^ lias at length appeared in fail'
proof. The title of this introduction read?,: Joseph! Fischer S. Commentation
Cl. Ptolcm&ci vitflf 0peri/ms, influxu sueadan. References to this Commentary
are indicated in the following pages by the word Coismsenttuio.
In a manner deserving gratitude Stevenson offers, in addition to the text, a
reproduction of the Ptolemy maps, from the valuable Codex Ebneriamts of the
Lenox Library collection in The New York Public Library. The choice of the
Codex Ebnaianm is a very fortunate one, since this Codex furnishes the original
copy for the maps in the important Roman editions of Ptolemy of the years 1
1490, 1507, and 1508, in which the Ptolemaic maps arc reproduced more accu¬
rately than in most other editions: see Jot- Fischer S. /., An important Ptolemy

Historical Society, Historical records and jWk'j, New York, /p/j, v. 6, part st
f. 216-234)} a ten Cortmientathyp. $40-343
That the maps essentially belong to the Geography of Ptolemy, and offer with
essential accuracy the original Ptolemy maps, I have shown in the two treatises:

Tile choice of the word which Ptolemy always applied in the sense
0/ representing graphically, or of drawing, as well as the exact designation of that
which is to be represented (rip1 Me}1' ij|i^ obsoun^ijv, “our inhabited earth”), and
also the statement atmul the manner of the representation fcrvjqifreov w; ext paMora

incontestably that he regarded at his proper task the representation of our ocku

How Ptolemy, toward the end of ins life (about 150 A. D.), after the comple¬
tion of his chief astronomical work, the A Images^ and of his gicat astrological
work, ilie Teirabiblos^ in which he also treats important geographical questions
(Commcniiitiot f. 35-56), came to devote himself to the cartographical repre¬
sentation of the habitable earth, this he himself tells us with all desire d clearness
in the sixth chapter of Rook 1.
After praising highly his contemporary Mario us (ca, 70-130 A. D„) who had
devoted himself all his life with great seal and good judgment to the revision of
his world map (t?£ too yeoy^ai^Mav ;tw&>a>; and after he had made in

the map of the ockumenc in accordance with the Commentarics of Marinus

the manuscript copies of the tradition, that they had ascribed to Ptolemy what did
not belong 10 him {the Supplements), and had denied to him wfestis incontestably
to be acknowledged as his, i. c. the maps, except the map of the world.
It is a stra-ige caprice of fate that just that map of the world which one so
often see* copied as Ptolemy’s map of the world does, not go hack to Ptolemy.

be expected; bur the simple conical projection, Schonc has already correctly noted
and for this reason has justly denied that Ptolemy could be regarded as die origi¬
nator of the world map.
In the meantime Professor Dr, Adolf Deissirann has succeeded it) finding in
the So rail Library of Constantinople a Ptolemaic manuscript in Greek which
gives the world map in the modified spherical projection ns used by Ptolemy, Pro¬
fessor Deissmann kindly placed at my disposal text and maps of this manuscript
in photographic reproduction. It was my first impression that I had hcforc me
ihe genuine world map of Ptolemy, but I was soon convinced that although the
projection is that of Ptolemy the contents of the map do not correspond at all to
Ptolemy’s data as they are found in the last three chapters of Rook VI 1, but have
been greatly modified by the additions of Agathodamon {Gommetitatiu, f. 5/5
52 j ). In the final results of my earlier investigations nothing therefore is changed
by the new discovery; the twenty-six provincial maps of the A-redaetion, and the
sixty-four small provincial maps of the B-rvdactinn go hack to Ptolemy, but the
world map* essentially the same in both the A-redaetion and the B-redaction, is
to be accredited to the Alexandrian geographer Agathodamon,
Wh en Profes&or L"5r_ Albert Herrmann, in his treatise: Marimtti Ptolemans and
HireKdrfen (^Zekschnflder GesclbchaftfmVErdkundet BerEmi tgjq^p. 7<f0—7^7;

tried to furnish evidence that Ptolemy did not need to draw- any maps since Marinos
added to his first edition maps which would have essentially met the demands even
of his latest edition of the text, he doubtless recognized that Marinus added maps
to his first editions of the Emendation of the world map. That this, however, would
have met the demands of his latest text edition, ot even the text of M minus as
revised by Ptolemyj seems to me as absolutely untenable* So far, primarily, as the
projection is concerned, it plainly appears from the twentieth chapter of Rook J,
that the distorting projection of Marinus dons not satisfy Ptolemy at all. Further¬
more, while Marin us assigned, though only rarely, an exact position to the indi¬
vidual cities, mountains, and other topographical objects, Ptolemy demanded that
in all eases a determination as nearly exact as possible of the latitude and longitude
be added.
As a matter of fact, Ptolemy, in Books II-VII, has listed sonic 8,a00 locations
determined with apparent accuracy down to five minutes* That these were copied
from ail extant map is obvious to anyone who takes flic pains to compare the text
and maps in the English edition by Stevenson. It is clear that the version, based
on the earlier Marinas maps and the latest Marinas text, in which the world map,
outlined if) uniform scate of measurement, was lacking, provides no compensation
for the loss of the map, and this in fact is expressly emphasized by Ptolemy* Only
in the case of the seaports, and in the case of a few inland cities, did Mannus, in
the latest edition of his Emendation of the 'world mapt Furnish, in fairly practical
deta ils of position, a statement either of longitude or latitude. In most cases, how
I$1



I N T RODUCTIO Nr
cvt-r, he gave information about neither longitude nor latitude. It is sclf^cviiient
that if the maps of Marinus had sufficed for the test of the Intent edition, then not
so many scholars would have endeavored, but in vain, to make amends lor the miss¬
ing m&p by supplying an adequate new one. Even Ptolemy himscll could not in
that ease have said, a* he die! say, that he would complete the latest edition of
Maiinus by the restoration of the missing mapj rather lie would have been com¬
pelled to say that Marinus had undervalued hk own life work since lie expressed
regret thot it had not been possible for him to add such a map also to his latest
edition j. the earlier map was entirely sufficient. Thai Ptolemy neither thought nor
said. For him the restoration of the missing world map was considered the main
task. That the maps added to the earlier Marinus editions, however, rendered lum
(Ptolemy) essential sen ice is obvious, and, ns it seems to me, can still be proved.
Ptolemy wanted to restore completely, not only a map which would correspond*
as far as possible, to the existing text of the latest edition of Maiinus, but he wanted
also to furnish :m improved Marines map altogether according to the ideas of
Marines himself* In order to attain this end and secure it for the future, he had
to solve, in addition to his main problem, two secondary problems. He had ( I ) to
submit the collected material to a reexamination, and (a) to perfect the map-draw¬
ing (a) by an exact and tabular pre sen tat ion on one plane, not on eight or more,
and together the positions in longitude and latitude of that which was to be entered,
and (b) by determining a proper kind of projection. How Ptolemy solved these
secondary problems we learn from chapters six to twenty-four of Hook I, and in
detail in hooks IJ—VII.
Since the Greek text* in many passages, is very difficult to understand, and since
the Latin and Italian translations, as already remarked, frequently do not agree,
and this statement also applies to the unfinished French translation of Halma, we
welcome the fact that the English translation of Dr. Stevenson make? it easy for
us to follow the arguments 0/ Ptolemy*
In the first place, Ptolemy, in conformity with hi? plan, deals with (he mis¬
takes of which -Marinu? was guilty in collecting the material. These relate:
( t ) rhe exaggerated extension of the inhabited earth in longitude and latitude.
Instead of eighty-seven degrees of latitude of Mari mis, Ptolemy gets by com¬
putation eighty <!egrets, and instead of the two hundred and twenty-five degrees
of longitude there are only one hundred and eighty degrees Cammenta
65-79) * (2;) to the definite location of cities especially, concerning which Marin us in
his numerous commentaries made adjustment according to the most divergent
points of view, ami frequently has made either no statement at all or only con¬
tradictory ones (I, l8, 5). In my G&mmeuiatfo I have attempted to fix the subdivi¬
sions of Mar-inns’ latest work according to the statements of Ptolemy, III doing
thyf it appeared that, 111 order to find as nearly exact as possible the definite loca¬
tion of a place, at least eight different sections of Marinus would hsve to hi con¬
sulted (Comtmntath) p. S0-S5).

PTQLKMY’S GEOGRAPHY
(j) to the determination of lhe several territorial boundaries (I, I 6),
.Before Ptolemy passes to his second tusk, or problem, he calls attention 10 a few
more recent discoveries of which Marines was ignorant. Chapter seventeen is
devoted to these discoveries {Comm?fitatio3 f. S^—SQ). 1 he rectification of many
erroneous positions of Marlows, Ptolemy undertook in Books TI-VH without
mentioning Marinus. Tin; second subordinate task, which concern^ itself with the
most faithful possible drawing of the world map3 is introduced hy a repetition of
tiie words of Elis plan: Aomov &' dv tu xlxiu ti|V tq;u6ev ifj; jarcaY{ja<pig Lniay.i
^■aoitai (Rcliquum autem erit,. ut qua rationc delincanda tabula sit considcremus,
J, 18, i).
Since the inhabited earth can be represented on n globe or an ft plane surface we
have to consider two points in the guide to the drawing and in the drawing itself,
one general and the oilier special Whether the representation of the earth is to
lie made on a glolie or on a plane, there must lie in either case earnest endeavor
to present in understandable form the cartographical material that is to be inserted.
The absolute necessity of a handy form of presentation of the material Ptolemy
justifies under a twofold presupposition j maps either arc found with the text or
without. If maps are offered they have to be copied ami in that process mistakes
creep in unobserved, and these mistakes increase to such an extent in additional
copyings that the original is scarcely to he recognized. What is- to l>e done in such
a ease? Well, we go back to the original map or to a tare fully made copy. But
what it" such can not lie found? Then surely there is nothing that can be dyne
i f the material has not been offered in usable form. Most of those who have under¬
taken to drift the missing map of Marinus have tried Lo solve the problem out
of Marinus* text. In most instances, in this attempt, they have foiled to get the
correct determination of position because Marinus did not present the data in a
practical form}, in one passage the longitude of a place is given, in another the
latitude, and. in very many instances both of these details are lacking or arc con¬
tradictory (1, I 8, 4).
Thai under such circumstances the drafting or revision of a map is impossible
is self-evident, The material must be so offered that it can be practically treated,
and tor each entry an exactly determined position must be given. When that is
i ho case we can surely draft a map anew, and correct it where it is at fault. This
secondary task Ptolemy has performed in Books II—VIJt How one could con¬
clude^ however, from the performance of this task that Ptolemy repudiated his
main task and added, no maps to his work, is to me incomprehensible. The most
convenient nnd most reliable means of emending a map perhaps corrupted by
copying, tie would thereby have sacrificed at iIlc outset. Neither is such a change
of his main purpose made more probable by saying that Ptolemy as an astronomer
wa? accustomed to mete tabular lists, since, as we know, the astronomers of
antiquity, just as do the astronomers of our day, made use of celestial globes and
stelEar maps. Reference to mere astronomical tables is, in our present case, nil
the more futile, inasmuch as Ptolemy himself made use on the one hand of the

sake of certainty Ptolemy demands both* namely maps and convenient text {Cout
?nt'nUiiioi p. 130—138; Fischer^ Ptoletnaas- mid Agathadtimon^ p. 78S4 ).
In what manner the systematic Ptolemy would uflcr the improved and addi¬
tional material of which use can be made he tells us in chapter nineteen of Hook 1:
‘"Ici the casco/ all the provinces we have given their boundaries according to
longitude and latitude j, for the more important nations their positions relative
to each other, in the case of the most important dries* rivers* hay*, mountains and
similar objects the exact positions.M To these detail* concerning provinces, lie
it said Eiy rlic way* the sixty-four small provincial maps of the H-redacrion corre¬
spond (Joi. Fiscfmr^ Dvr Codex Bttmeyanits 111, p. 151-137)* and they have
been added in immediate connection with the text in Hooks II—VII.
By means of the word i&cttjov (special) pul conspicuously at the top, Ptolemy
c^lls attention to the contrast wath the word formerly used by him: jeaivdv ( general).
Tn general the requirement ts that* for the drafting either on a globe or on a plane*
the cartographical material must be presented in a handy way. Drawing upon a
globe has its peculiar difficulties as has ill so drawing in a plane its special problems.
Since the drawing upon a globe offers In Itself a similarity with the shape of the
earth* no device of art is necessary for that. The drawing upon a globe his* how¬
ever* its disadvantages. One can not insert everything which a world map ought
to present and can not see at one glance the entire map. These difficulties do not
obtain in drawing upon a flat surface* but others in turn appear which must he
overcome. Angles and surfaces must be indicated as faithfully as possible. The
projection selected by Marinus in which only the parallel of Rhodes is divided
in a right relation to the meridian-elrclt is in no respect suitable* probably the
genuine spherical projection invented by Ptolemy is the most usable, and particu¬
larly the special modified spherical projection recommended hy him, In which
the curved parallel, and* except the middle one, the likewise curved meridians
display the system of degrees on the globe. In this project Inn nlso the faithfulness
of representation is bcyt secured. Characteristic of Ptolemy’s way of working, is
the concluding sentence of the last chapter of Hook I, in which he selects tor him¬
self the Iletter, even if more difficult, modified spherical projection.
How Ptolemy proceeded in his tabors, he himself ha? told us in the nineteenth
chapter of Hook J, hy designating his chief problem as “n twofold task/* He does
this with perfect justice* since lie wants to furnish 1 revised collection of material
for a Marinus map that has to be outlined* and also himself to insert into

PTOLEMY’S GEOGRAPHY
oiTered in various places by Manillas, and then, (%) by checking op the reports of
those who had visited the localities in. question, and the details inserted in acCu
rmely drawn maps, Notiue Ivy the way, that we leant horn this last assertion how
high Ptolemy rated the maps. That among the maps he used, first of all those of
MarinuS are to be underload, which is assuredly a reasonable hypothesis and, ns
we shall see later, can be proved even to-day. If according to the data just quoted,
we observed the sy&tomtizer and cartographer Ptolemy at his work, we sec that
he had maps before It ini, especially the world map of Marinos in its several sec¬
tions, and how he compared them with statements in the latest text of Marinos, and
corrected the points of disagreement in accordance with Mamms’ latest statements.
Hut Ptolemy was nor satisfied even with that. What had been gathered from
Marinos was now compared with the latest reports of investigators and with other
exact maps and then corrected and inserted in the world map. Restoration of the
text and of the map went hand in haroh That here a mistake might occasionally
creep in, is easily seen and is shown by myself in the GonmimUtic in many con¬
crete instances (p. 136-163). Here let me call attention only to one example.
Tii the eleventh map of Asia live cities arc entered which are not mentioned at all
in the corresponding text. On the other hand in the description in the text of the
tenth map of Asia these live cities arc mentioned in three different places, but in
the corresponding tenth map not a single one is entered, although there is no lack
of space (Comriu-niaitG} f, /J5, 156). ft is very remarkable that the com La¬
tency is found in the A-reduction but not in the H-rcibcHonof the Geography of
Ptolemy. As it seems to me, this circumstance bear* witness that in the twenty-six
provincial map?, of the A-red act ion wre have before us the first revision of the general
map or, let rite say# of sectionsof the unified map of Marinns; hut in the E-redaction
we have a series of maps adjusted to a text intended for convenient use, and
arranged, not according to countries, hut accenting to provinces. I11 the CorfV.v
EiJflOMJMW, Donnus Nicolaus Gcrmanus, who used the A- and B-rednctions for
his edition, noticed the error, and corrected it according to the B-redaction.
As in this point so also in .1 much more important respect Donnus Nicolaus lias
revised the maps of Ptolemy in the spirit of Ptolemy. Instead of the modified pro¬
jection of Man nits, selected by Ptolemy for Ids territorial and provincial maps,
in which only the middle parallel of the special map was divided in right pro¬
portions, l>onnus Nicolaus (who ls erroneously called Danis Nicolaus in the L'lin
edition of Ptolemy of 3482) has on cacti map divided at least two parallels in
right proportion. Thereby he has attained effectively the greater similarity striv¬
en after by Ptolemy, with a drawing upon the globe. The maps of the reproduced
Codex Ebmrlamu plainly show this. Since the ,fDonk Projection1* introduced
by Do mius Nicolaus German us became generally known (Fischer, Die Entdcck^
Ufigendet Xar/iwuneti m Am<\rlhn7FrirJmr%} rpo2f f. Si, Belize fj - English

INTRODUCTION
this very projection has hud. to serve as proof that the maps of Ptolemy could not
have originated with Ptolctny, since he assuredly would not have applied the
<<:Donis Projection^ but the muddied Marini)} projection.
We see by this; example to wliat conclusions one is led, unless one goes back
to the original source. If one had given but a casual glance at the Greek or
the oldest Latin manuscripts, one would soon have been convinced that nil the
provincial maps- of those manuscripts are actually drawn on the modihed Mari mis
projection. In very recent times two works have appeared to which we must
here allude, at least briefly, Professor Dr. Albert Herrmann, whom I have a 1 ready
mentioned, Isas tried to e&talilish, in lib study: Marram von Tyrtit (Petvrmanni
gcographhche Miitf'Uwigsn, Gotha, Jfljo, ErgStmtngsheft jop, p. 'n :in
extended and somewhat altered form, his view chit the maps of Marinus would
have E-i.tfficed. That Marinu 5, in sp itc 0/ the cxpl ici t st atcment of Ptolany to t lie con¬
trary, added maps to his latest edition, and this too, in the modified Marinus projec¬
tion introduced by Ptolemy, is, I am convinced, untenable. To confirm tbit- more
exactly would lead us too fur. Harmamt is very deserving of gratitude, however,
for the two maps wrhich he has appended to his invest igallons, The first might har¬
monize well with [He conception of Marinos, US exemplified in Ills latest edition,
but instead of the relatively few insertions (about 200) 7,000 of them or more
wrcre to be expected. Plow significant for the discovery of America Was Marinus'
idea that the earth extended beyond two hundred and twenty-five degrees of longi¬
tude is shown on the second map. This exhibits the network of Marinus. The
middle parallel is that of Rhodes, As actual author of the map the learned
Florentine, Paolo Toscandli, is designated as “Marinus redivivus” with an appeal
to the profound study of Hermama Wagner, Dir. Rec&nilruktton der Tcsatnelii
Karla i'om fafire 14/4 (Neckrichfeft dvr GtselUcdutft dvr Winmtchnftnn, phU,~
hiit. Klasre, G8itin£mt t$94t Nr„ 3, p+ 236).
The second very recent work to appear has as its author Professor Dr, Ernst
11 enigma 1111, the title of whose work reads; Marinin von Tyrol, Geograph itttd
KitHograph {Pauly* Ruai-EncydopUdtc, Nsue Beerbcktmg, Bdr 14, columns
i76y-'i“QS)‘ Ilonigmana, too, has appended to his study (col. 1785) a recon¬
structed Marinus map. It is indeed interesting to note how different are the two
reconstructed maps. That Honigmann gives all of the names and Legends in the
Greek language, while Herrmann renders them in Latin, Is of less consequence.
Incomparably more important is the difference in the contents offered. Thus in
Honigmann 10 mountains are found, whereas the map of Herrmann exhibits an
abundance of mountain ranges. But it is not our task hereto explain in detail the
two very different reconstructions. Much more important is the welt established
conclusion that Honigmann, retying upon the clear evidence of Ptolemy, empha¬
sizes decidedly that Marinus added no map* to his latest edition of the Emends
tion of the cwi>r!d map.
But Honigmann, in spite of the purpose, expressed again and again clearly ami
distinctly by Ptolemy, of furnishing the missing Marinus map, and especially of

thus completing the unfinished work of Marinos, writes: *'Thc ntinitmis pas¬
sages from which Fischer in his stud ies Pwfcwtitts and A gntkoicmiw, as also in his
P/otemaw ah Kartogntph tries to prove cJist Ptolemy had added maps TO his work,
arc evidence after all, only of this, that he wished to furnish a guide to map
drawing, a fact which has never been questioned." (col. ] 77 E 3 note.) In saying
tiiis. he says what to me 1? incomprehensible. Involuntarily one asks one*s self:
was Ptolemy realty so unintelligent as to write in Book Ij 2, 2: “Since it is at pres¬
ent our task 10 draw our Oekumenc wills (he utmost possible faithfulness of
representation with the actual world/' and then* instead of this, offered only tablet
according to which a map of the earth might be drawn? When* then, Ilomg
inann continues: <cTo Ik sure lit (Ptolemy) has also drawn maps, tile only ques¬
tion concerning' which is, whether lie also published them with the Guide,J> then
one can scarcely withhold the query: ought Ptolemy to have renounced the easiest
end Hale it guide to the drawing of maps, and not also have given, at the same time,
the maps already prepared: It would simply appealr inexplicable that Ptolemy
should again and again represent the draft mg of maps as En s main task, while the
practical furnishing of the material and the invention of a suitable projection w’ere
but subordinate tasfc^, and yet in spite of that could cling so obstinately to the
solution of the subordinate problems, that he quite forgot the completion of his
main task {Comment£it&t Supplements').
Ptolemy completed text and maps, and text and maps lie published together.
That any doubt whatever could arise over this is caused on the one hand by a
wrong interpretation of the already mentioned Agathodamon legend {Co/fVne>t
tatr&i p. log^izo) and on the other hand, by ignorance of the textual tradi¬
tion of Ptolemy's Geography, In all of the oldest and most authoritative Ptolemy
manuscripts of the A-rcdaction and of the E-redaction, maps are still found
or else reference is especially made in these manuscripts to ilte fact that maps
had been found in the original copy, ’l l]is last statement holds true especially of
the Codsx Vaticanui graecitt igi, which Mommsen and Muller consider so im¬
portant that its testimony outweighs for them that of all the other Codices yCom
mentat'sOy p, i66—rji} and Supplements).
As proof that both text and maps, were transmitted in the same way, we may
here first of alt niune the important Greek manuscripts of the A-redaction: the
Codex Ur&iwu graecui Hz3 the above-mentioned, hut hitherto unknown Codex
C onstantmopolitamti Seraglhmiit graecm 57, the Codex A thorn grace#j, the Codex
Yenctm Marcianos graecns 516y as well as the Fregmmtim Tabricmmtm grae
cum. Also the most important manuscripts of the B-rcilaetion show maps;
unfortunately (hey have not yet been published. The manuscripts of the H-redac¬
tion nre divided into two groups. At the head of the older group, with sixty-five

He who assumes that rhe text of Ptolemy goes hack to Ptolemy himself must
assume a lso, in accordance with the principles of a sound criticism, that the maps
similarly transmitted also go hack to Ptolemy, If we inquire more carefully
about the relation between maps and (ext three interpretations arc possible: (1) the
maps might have been drawn according to Ptolemy's tettj (z) the text might
have; been derived from the maps; (3) or both text and [imps may show' an
independent transmission, so that the maps may represent the remodeled and
completed Marinus maps, and the text the remodeled Marinus text, AM three
possibilities I have investigated thoroughly. In this investigation I came to the con¬
clusion that the third possibility conforms to the truth ( Commentatio, p- 1
Still another legitimate objection is, however, to be met: it 33tolemyhad actu¬
ally added to his Geography the maps transmitted to us, then traces of them
would necessarily be found in the literature of the ancient people. In my Com
Tmntatio t have treated in detail the question whether or not from the Traditions
of the subsequent time the existence of Ptolemy's maps can also be proved, ilic
investigation revealed that the maps of Ptolemy exercised, for n long time, influ¬
ence among the Greeks and By*samines {Agathodamon, .Puppus, Marciart t?f

In conclusion a few more brief statements concerning the present condition
of Ptolemaic investigations may perphups he desired. Properly speaking, a biog¬
raphy of Ptolemy docs not exist, and even the necessary preliminary labors for one
are lacking. Neither is there as yet any complete critical edition of his works, such
for example, as his Geography. The life-time of Ptolemy can be pretty accurately
determined as extending from about yo to i6fl A.D. (Cow/rHutatsv, p, 11—21s.)
The place of his scientific activity was certainly in Alexandria, hut the place ot
his birth remains uncertain, even though weighty considerations speak For Ptol
cmais Hermeiu* The most usual assertion, making Pdusium bis birthplace, rests
upon a misunderstanding, for in Arabic the first name of Ptolemy, Claudius, is
interpreted with "cl QcludT,” but this can easily be read as Fcludi/* As a mat¬
ter of fact Fetudi or Phrludi was read and interpreted later as Pelusium (Com
mmtclin, f. 20-25), If in the Middle Ages Ptolemy was often referred to as
belonging to the royal family of the Ptolemies, and in the Ptolemy manuscripts

AM not uimwift, Most Illustrious Prince, that Ptolemy the Geographer do
pictcd the earth with the greatest skill and the most thorough intcjrm.ition, and
that were we to attempt anything new in these studies, our work would incur
the censure of many 5, for all those who ermine this deli neation of ours, contained,
in these maps, which wo now send to Yon, especially if they are these who are
ignorant of the art of geometry, and observe that it difttre from that which Ptol¬
emy set forth, will convict us forthwith either of ignorance or of rashness. They
will affirm that we did not know nur limitations, or that we were indiscreet in
falsifying so great a work, as swn as they observe that we have altered it in die
least particular. They will never 1m persuaded, nor will they think it other than
impossible, if any tme else should have a better method of depicting the earth,
that that me [bod had escaped the notice of such a great mail as in truth was
Ptolemy, lor he alone, even including die many excellent geogiMpliers why flour¬
ished before him, first discerned a method by which he could represent die several
localities of the entire earth in picture.
It would be much the same thing as to assert that neither the work of 11 timer,
the prince of poets could he set in order by Pisistratus, nr the divine work of
Lucretius be emended by Cicero, nr the paintings of Tolletyna be corrected by
Seppomust Such persons are like those who will praise nothing that they do not
think they can understand, since any method that they hope to understand ami
comprehend themselves they judge to he the host for representing the world.
If confused by the frequency of the lines of longitude, not equally distant une
from rhe other, they jilight say they would die rather have that rare and vast pic¬
ture of Ptolemy’s set out in straight lines, than thisour multiplex and elaborate pic¬
ture with its incl hied and curved lines.
And we do not now claim that there is anything to he found in the picture of
Ptolemy that should lie corrected or emended, or reduced to order, since al l things
were bv him. so skilfully and wisely represented, that nothing relating to the posi¬
tion of countries seems to be wanting in Ins maps-, but we say this much that cve
may convict those rn.cn of their ignorance who, with or without knowledge of
I)



PTOLEMY !S GEOGRAPHY
such matters, arc moved by a kind of envy and haired on seeing anything set down
that is beyond their comprehension, and immediately turn and abuse the author.
If those who arc not altogether ignorant of geography or cosmography, and art
in the habit of reading Ptolemy, will compare, with a calm mind, our picture
with Ik is, they will certainly think our picture worthy ot some praise, instead of
blaming it, for they will see that we undertook a hard and difficult task, mill
brought it to such an excellent conclusion, that they will he compelled to wonder
at it, especially when they discover that we have in no particular departed from
the intention of Ptolemy, although wc have deviated a little from his picture.
Since Thou canst plainly see, f > Most Illustrious Prince, how thi ngs arc, 1 beseech
The? to give heed for a while to what Ptolemy says and to what wc have done.
Ptolemy, as 1 soon learned from hi a writings, tel b us that there U a txvolbh!
system of depicting the terrestrial sphere* The first, he assent, is that in which
instead of circles (1 quote his words which are in the eighth book) wc represent
the meridians neither inclined nor curved hut as straight perpendicular lino. The
second, he says, is that in which we use everywhere Curved and inclining lines,
as the scheme of the places on the earth itself demands, and not straight lines.
Of die two methods he approves the second as somewhat more artistic and
tubule, hut in It is picture he lias followed the first method, it that picture be his
which is to be found in old copies, and in which, it appears that anyone depict¬
ing the enrth and making use of straight lines for circles, is not lar Iron', the truth.
But we for our part, Most Illustrious Prince, when we were reading at our leisure
his writings, which were not altogether foreign to our profession, and came upon
the description somewhere in the first book near the end, wherein he says that we
should regard what is done with care and with seriousness in a map rather chan
what is done too easily and too thoughtlessly; having read this, L say, we suddenly
began to reflect by what means we ourselves might obtain some glory.
Believing that an opportunity was offered us whereby our powers might come
to light by raising some monument to our industry, we immediately undertook the
task of making a picture in the proper way, which would receive mute general
approval than previous pictures, even were lie himself to be the judge.
Instead of circles wc have made use of sloping lines, where they would seem to
he required, that are not all equidistant (as he himself advises we should do) and
the location ol places hilling between two parallels wc have given in a reckoning
from both. In order that one might make the more easily and accurately an esti¬
mate of the location of any place, which could not be clearly expressed by straight
equidistant lines, wc have not hesitated to express by moans of parallels, in each
of our pictures, the extent in miles of every degree whatsoever in longitude.
Wh at shall I say lurther when in no copy of Greek or Latin text can be found
a picture which tells us the si*e and shape of any island, or gives it proper descrip¬
tion, nr tells, in any region or province, how many and what kinds of peoples may
be found, what towns, cities, rivers, harbors, lakes, and mountains, or under what
place in the heavens they lie, or in what direction they face.

Wc have inserted certain of these tilings, but not all, yet all arc givers by Ptolemy
himself in his Writings; ami we have distinguished boundaries by dotted lines, so
that even an unpracticod eye can see them easily.
The size of the picture itself, which heretofore was too large and exceeded tire
common size of books, we have reduced, while carefully keeping the dimensions
of all localities to a size that will make it more acceptable to those wishing to study
it. The remaining work of that illustrious man wc liavc left untouched, and it
remains ai it was at first.
When, therefore, I had almost finished this work, and was thinking of some
distinguished person to whom to dedicate it, no one truly seemed to us to be more
worthy of this dedication than Yourself] for Thou art the only one, to speak the
truth, of all the rulers of Italy, who is greatly delighted by such writings and pit>
tu res, and who has around hi mother learned men excelling in this art, and in many
other arts; who can readily correct any mistake on our part, and at the same time
can give commendation to what h rightly done.
Omitting other learned men dwelling in Thy city in these times, who h more
skilled in mathematics than Johannes Rlanchmus, or in physics than Peter the
Good: Why is more learned, in medicine than Sonzinus? Who is more subtle in
dialectics and in philosophy than Brother Francis? Who is more skilled in civil and
canon law than Franciscus Pored I must Who is more advanced in theology than
Johannes GattUs, and at the same time more expert in Greek and Latin? Who, in
fine, is more excellent in every' kind of lead dug than Hietonimus Castellanos?
Time would fail me, O Illustrious Prince, to enumerate the famous men who serve
in Thy city, and Fain would l follow their virtues! Truly they would not dwell in
Thy city if they did not witness Thee (because Thou knowest that virtue is the
guide of the life of men) giving Thy support to men who are eminent as teachers,
and leading them from taking (he ease they deserve to the active business of read¬
ing and writing. And so Thy integrity and Thy virtue can never be praised as they
deserve. As in Thy past life Thy virtue Iras devoted ilsdf to learning, may it still
show favor to the learned, and by its munificence draw the rest of mankind to the
same seal for virtue*
Accept then, 0 Most Beneficent Prince, Who art tin: Ornament of our Italian
nobility, this work, which \vc have dedicated to Tbcc, and which we now send
Thee, not so much that Thou shouldst read it as that Thou should^ correct it.
If in it TSiou shouldst find anything blameworthy, I beg that Thou mayest ascribe
it not so much to weakness of my mind as to the greatness and difficulty of the task.
But shouldst Thou find that in this work we have labored for the common good
not in Vain, then we earnestly heseech Thcc that in many other different arts,
which hitherto have remained untouched, it may be permitted to ns by Thy kind¬
ness and liberality to give free exercise to out talents.

which portraits and pictures may require,
gising [hem proportion in relation |0 onc
another so that their correct measure apart
can be seen by examining them, to note
whether they form the whole or a part of
the picture. Accordingly therefore it is not
unworthy of Chorography, or our of its
province, Lo describe the smallest details of
places, while Geography deals only with
regions ant! their general features,
The habitable parts of the earth sEiould
be noted rather than the parts whicEi arc
merely of equal size, especially the prov¬
inces or regions and their ■divisions, the
JifTcrences between these being rather the
more important. Chorography is most con¬
cerned with what kind of places those are
which it describes, not how large they arc in
extent. Its concern is to paint a true like¬
ness, and not merely to give exact position
am! size. Geography looks at the position
rather than the quality, noting the relation
of distances everywhere, ml emulating the
art of pointing only in some of its major de¬
scriptions, Chorography needs an artist, and
no on e p rc^ents i t righ tl y uni csslie isan art i st.
Geography does not call for the same re¬
quirements, as any One, by means of lines
.Liul plain notations can fix positions and
draw general outlines. Moreover Chirog¬
raph y docs not hnvc need of mathematics,
which is an important part of Geography.
In Geography oneimint contemplate the ex¬
tent of the entire earth, as well as its shape,
and its position under the heavens, in order
that one may rightly state what arc the
peculiarities and proportions of the part
with which one is dealing, and under what
parallel of the celestial sphere it is located,
for so one will be able to discuss the lengtli
of its days and nights, the stars which arc
lixed overhead, the s-tny:- which move above
the horizon,, and the stars which never rbL
above the horizon at all; in short nil things
having regard to our earthly habitation.
It is the great and the exquisite accom¬
plishment of mathematics to show all these
things to the human intelligence so that the
sky, too, having a representation of its own
character, which, although it can nut be
seen as moving around us, yet we can look
upon it by means, of ail image as we look
upon the earth itself, forth* earth being real
and very large, and neither wholly nor in

Let. Hut now as we propose to describe our habit abl e ea rth, ami Jn o nler that the descrip¬
tion may correspond as for as possible with
the earth itself we consider it fitting at the
outlet to put fortEi that which is the first es¬
sential, namely, a reference to the history of
travel, and to the great store rjif knowledge
obtained from the report of those who have
diligently explored certain regions; what¬
ever concerns either the measurement of the
cartli geometrically or the observation of
the phenomena of fixed localities; what¬
ever relates to the measurement of the earth
that can be tested by pure distance calcula¬
tions to determine how for apart pi acts arc
situated; and whatever relations to rived
positions can be tested by meteorological in¬
struments for recording shadows Tlmlast is
a certain method, and is in no respect doubt¬
ful. The other method in less perfect and
needs other support, since first of all it Is
necessary lo know in determining the dis¬
tance between two places, in what direction
each place lies from the other; to know how
far this place Is distant from tEiar, we must
al&o know under what part of the sky each is
located, tit at is, whether each extends to
Wiird the north, or, so to speak, toward the
rising of the sun (the cast), or in some other
particular direction. And these facts it is
impossible to ascertain without the use of
the instruments to which we refer. Ry the
use of these instruments, anywhere and at
any lime, llsc position of the meridian line
can easily be found, and from this we can
ascertain the distances that have been trav¬
eled, Rut when this has been clout, the
measurement of (he number of stadia docs
not give us sure information, because jour¬
neys very rarely are made in a stmight line.
There being many deviations from a srraigfit
course both in land and in sea journeys, it i&
necessary to conjecture, in the ease of a land

journey, the ruiure and the extent of the
deviation, and how tar it departs from a
straight course, and to subtract something
tram the number of stariiit to make the jour¬
ney a straight one.
Even in sailing the sea the same thing
happens, as the wind is never constant
throughout thu whole voyage. Thus al¬
though the distance of (he plates noted is
cart fully counted, it does nor give us a has is
for the determination of the circumference
of the whole cartlij nor do we ascertain an
exact position for the equatorial circle or for
the location of the poles.
Distance which is ascertained from an
observation of the stars shows accurate!y all
these things, and in addition shows how
much of the circumference is intercepted in
turn by the parallel circle*.,and by the me¬
ridian circles which are drawn through the
places themselvesj that is to sny, what part
of the circumference of parallel circles and
of the equatorial circle is intercepted by the
meridians, or what part of the meridian
circles arc intercepted by tine parallels and
equatorial circle.
After this it will readily he seen how
much space lies between the two places
t h eJ nsel ves on (he c i neujn.fi: rence o f the large
circle which is drawn through them around
the earth. Thus measurement of stadia, ob¬
tained from careful calculations docs not
require a consideration of the parts of the
earth traversed in a described journey; for it
is enough to suppose that the circuit of the
earth itself is divided into as many parts as
one desires, and that some of these parts are
contained within distances noted on the
great circles, that gird the earth itself
Dividing the whole circuit of the earth of
any part of it noted by uur measurements
which arc known as stadia measurements, is
a method not equally convincing. Therefore
Ik cause of this fact alone it has been found
necessary to take a certain part of the cir¬
cumference of a very large celestial circle,
and by determining the ratio of this part to
tile whole of the circle, and by counting the
number of atadiu contained in the given dis¬
tance on the earth, one can measure the sta¬
dia circumference of the globe.
When we grant that it has been demon¬
strated by mathematics that [he surface of
the land and water is irt its entirety a sphere,
and hat the same center as the celestial globe, and that any plane which passes
through [he center makes at its surface, that
ii, at the surface o£ the earth and of the sky,
great circles, and that the angles of the planes, which angles are at the center, cut the circumferences of the circles which they
intercept proportionately, it follows that in
any of the distances which we measure on (he earth the number of the stadia, if our
measurements arc correct, can be deter
miuvd, but the proportion of this distance to the whole circumference of the earth can not be found, litcause no proportion to the
whole earth can thus lie derived, but from
the similar circumference of the celestial glolie that proportion can he derived, and
the ratio of any similar part on the earth’s surface to the great circle of the earth is the Mine,

HOSE geographers who lived before us
sought to JlX correct distance on the earth, not only that they might determine
the length of the greatest circle, but also that
they might determine the extent which a region occupied in one plane on one and the same meridian r A fee t obsc rving therefore, by mean* of the instruments of which I have
spoken, the points 'which were directly over each terminus of the given distance, they
calculated from the intercepted part of the circumference of the meridian, distance* oil the earth. As w c have said, they assume the Location
of the points to l>c in one plane, and the lines p;is:-fog through the terminals of the distance, to the points which are directly overhead, must necessarily meet, and the
points where they meet would be the com¬ mon center of the circles. Therefore if the
circle draw'll through the poles were inter¬
cepted by lines drawn from tire two points that were marked overhead, it would be un¬
derstood that it formed the total extent of the intercepted circumference compared
with the whole circuit of the cs rtb.

have constructed for measuring shadows, by
which instrument we can easily ascertain a
great many other useful things, For on any day nr light we have the elevation of the
north pole, and at nny hour we have the
meridian position of the given distance by performing a jingle measurement; that is, by measuring the angle that the greatest
circle drawn through the line of the dis¬ tance mako with tEic meridian circle at die
vertical point; in this way we can show the
reqiii red circumference Ely means of this in¬ strument, and the circumference of the equatorial circle which is intercepted Eu> tween the two met id Ians, these meridians
being parallel and circles like the equator.
According to this demonstration, if we measure only one straight distance: on the surface of the earth, then the number of itadiu ol tlie whole circuit of the earth can I* ascertained. And as a result nf this we can obtain the measurements of j*E! dis¬ tances, even when tEiey arc not exactly on tEie
same meridian or parallel, by observing carefully the elevation of the pole, and the
inclination of the distance to the meridian,
and vice versa. From the ratio of the given part of the circumference to the great circle, the number of the stadia can be calculated
Irom tile: known number of stadia in the cir¬ cuit of the whole cartfl.

Concerning the geographical narrations
of Marimts
M
ARINDS the Tyrian, the latent of the
geographers of our time, seems to us
to have thrown himself with the utmost seal
into this matter. He is known to hive found out many things that were not known before. He has sea relied j'jiC: t diligently the works of al¬
most all the historians who preceded him. He has not only enrnetted their errors, hm
the reader can clearly sec that he has under¬ taken to correct those parts of the work which he himself had done badly in the ear¬ lier editions of his geographical maps. If
vt c examine closely his last work we find few defects. It would seem to he enough fur us to describe the earth on which we dwell
from his commentaries alone, without other
investigations^ When, however, he appears to agree with certain others in a conclusion thai is un¬
worthy of belief, must oiten in questions con¬ cern ing t he method nf drawing, or when he refuses to give the attention lie should to an
opportune invention, We have been moved hy no unworthy motive to think, as regards part of his reasoning and method, that we could, bring forward something more in
keeping with the rest of the work and its author. And this without wantiJig words we
will endeavor to do to the best of our ability,
dwelling briefly on each kind of error as
reason dictates,
First of all let us deal with that which pertain? to history. He considers that our
earth extends a greater distance in longitude
eastward, and to a greater distance in lati¬ tude southward than is right and true. For not unreasonably we call the distance ex¬
tending From the setting to the rising sun rhe longitude, and the distance from the north to the south polo tile latitude, when
we mark the parallels in the vault of the hcavensr Moreij ver the great er d ismnoe we call longitude, which is accepted by all, for
the extent of our habitable earth from cart to
west all concede is much greater than itse» tent from the north pole to the south,
CHAPTER VI1

F
IRST of all, Marinos places Thule as
the terminus of latitude on the parallel that cuts the mos-t northern part of the known world* And this parallel, he shows as clearly as is possible, at a distance of sixty
three degrees from the equator, of which degrees a mend ton circle contains three
hundred and sixty, Now the latitude he notes as measuring 31,500 stadia, since
every degree, it is accepted, has 500 stadia. Next, he places the country of the
pmntf Agjsymbaby name, and the promon¬
tory of Prasum on the same parallel which terminates.rhe most southerly land knowrn to
us, and this parallel lie places below the winter solstice. Between '3"hole -Lind the southern termi¬ nus he inserts altogether about eighty-seven degrees which is43,500 stadia, and he tries
to prove the correctness of elds southern ter¬ mination of Ins by certain observations
(which he thinks to be accurate) of the
fixed siar:- anti hy Certain journeys made both on land and on sea. Concerning this we will make a few observations.
In his observation concerning the fixed stars, in the third volume of his work, he
uses these wards; (lThe Zodiac is consid¬
ered to lie entirely above the torrid zone and therefore in that /one the shadows change,
and all the fixed stars rise and set. Ursa
Minor begins to be entirely above the hori

Gcelc is elevated eleven and. two-fifths

and that in the course of rite sun from the equinoctial to the summcrjolsticc, the north
pole continually rises above the horizon
while the south pole is correspondingly de¬ pressed, and that on the conic ary in the course of the sun fmm the equator to the winter
solstice the south pole rises above the hori¬
zon while the north pole is depressed.” ] n these statements Marin us narrates only
xvhat is oliscrvd (on) the equator, or be¬
tween the tropics. But what, after being learned from the records or from accurate
observation* of the fixed stars, are the hap¬ penings in places south of the equatort ho
in no wise informs us, as if one should place
southern stars rather than equatorial direct¬ ly overhead, or assert that mid-day shadows,
over the equator incline south, or show all l!ic stars of Ursa Minor risen or set, or some of them visible at the time when the south pole is raised above the horizon.
In what he adds later he tells us of certain observations, of which, nevertheless., he is not entirely certain in his own mind.
He says that those who sail from India to Limyidea, as did Diodorus the Samian, which is related in his third book, cell ns that Taurus is in a higher position in the
mid-heavens than in reality it is and that flic Pleiades are seen in die middle of the
masts,and he continue*,“tho*c w ho sail from A labts to Azaiua sail straight to the south,
and toward l he star Canopus, which there: i* tilled Hippos,that is the l lnr*c, nrtd which is far south. Stars are seen there which arc
not known to us by name, and the Dug Star
rises before Proeyon nnd Orion, ami he lore
the time when the sun turns hack toward, the summer solstice.'1
For these observations concerning the stanf Marinus clearly states that some places are located more northerly than the equator,
as when liesaysthat Taurus and the Pleiades
are direcllyover ihe beads of the sailorc. As
a matter of fact these stars arc near the equator. lie indeed show* some star* to Ik;
no further sou ill than north, for Canopus
can. be seen by those who dwell a long dis¬
tance north of the summer solstice; and
several of the fixed stars, never seen by us, can be seen above the horizon in places south
of us, and in places more toward the equa¬
torial region than those in the north, as around Mercie. They can he seen as is (.’a no
pus itself, which, V hen appearing above the
horizon is never v isible to those who dwell
north of us. Those who dwell toward the
south cql! tliis star I lippos, that I; the I lorscj
nor is any other j-tar of those known to us. culled by that name.
Mari mas, infers, that be himself deter¬ mined by mathematical proofs that Orion
is entirely visible, before the summer sol¬ stice, to those who dwelt below the equa¬
torial circle, also that with than the Dog
Star rises before Proeyon, which lie says is observed, as far south even as Syetic, In these conclusions of Marin us there is noth¬
ing appropriate or of value to us because be extends the position of hi; inhabited coun¬ tries too far south of the equator.

’lONCE KN fNG the voyage from Aro
J mata lo Rhapta, Marinus tells us that a certain Diogenes, one of those who were ac¬ customed to sai! to India, having been d riven
out of his course, and being off the coast of
CHAPTER IX
Aramata, was caught by the north wind and,
after having sailed with Frogloditica <-n his right, came in twenty-five days to the lake
from which the ftik flows, to the south of
which lies the promontory of Rhaptiun. He tells u* also thru a certain |.'lieopliiUi^,
one of those who were accustomed to sail to
Azunia, dri veil, from Rhapt;; by the south wind came to Arnmata on the twentieth day. In neither of these cases does he tell us
how many days wore occupied in actual
sailing, hut merely states that Tlveophihis took twenty days, and Diogenes, who sailed
along the coast of Trogloclittca,took twentylive days
I It only tells us how many days they were
on the voyage, and not the exact sai ling
time, nor the changes of the wind in
strength and direction, which must have
taken place d unrig a voyage of such long
duration. Moreover he does not say that
rhe sailing was continuously south or north,
hut merely say* that Diogenes was carried
along by the north wind while Thcophilus
sailed with the south wind. 1 hat the wind
kept the same strength anti direction during
the whole voyage is related in neither crt*e,
and it is incredible that for the space of so
many days in succession, it should have done
so. Therefore although Diogenes sailed
from Aromata to the swamps, to the south
of which lies tlie promontory of RKiapimm,
in twenty-five days, and Thcophilus from
Rhapta to Aromata, a greater distance, in
twenty days, and although Thcophilus tells
us that a single day’s sailing under favor
able circumstances is calculated at e,6do
stadia (and thk computation Marians him¬
self approves) Diiocortli clever tlielc&s says
that the voyage from Rhapta to the prom¬
ontory' of Fnsum, w'hich takes many days, afi
computed by Diogenes is only 5,000 stadia,
Tlie wind, he says, varies very suddenly at
the equator, and squalls around the equa¬
tor on cither Side of tile hne are snore
dangerous. From these considerations we thought we
ought not to assent to the numlnTiuj; of the day?, because it is plaiu tu all that on tlie

the same daily distance traveled as possible, hut in the even course of the journeys* Or voyage? or that they were wholly rmde in

have ascertained exactly the required dis¬
tances if lie had, with more skill in mathe¬ matics, considered what takes place in those localities. Since this observation was not made, it remains that wc follow what reason dictates, that is* wc must ascertain how far the distance extends beyond the equator. We can also ascertain tv hat we require to
know through information concerning the kinds* the forms, and the caters of the
animals living there, from which wc draw
the conclusion that the parallel of the re¬ gion of Agisymba is the same as that of ibtEthiopians and extends from the winter sol¬ stice to the equator, although with us in
places opposite to that region, that is, in the summer solstice, they do uor have die color of the Ethiopian*} nor is the rhinoceros ant!

south of us the inhabitants are moderately black such as from the same cause are the
Garamautcs-i whom Marinos himself de¬
scribes, and whom he places neither under the summer solstice nor north of it, hut much
too tar to the south. In the regions around

monstrous animals are bred.

S agreement the refore with this informa¬
tion, vii!,, that the inhabitants are Ethio¬ pians, as those who have Sailed I hr re have told us, Marinos describes the region of
Agisymba and (he promontory of Prasum, and the other places lying on the same parallel, is situated all on one paraltel, which is opposite the parallel passing
through Meroe- That would place them on a parallel distant front the equator in a
southerly direction i 6 ■' or rd>oiit 8,200
stadia, and by the same reckoning the whole width of. the h shim hie world amounts to
79° 25'or altogether 40,000 stadia. Now che distance between Lcptis Magna
and Gamma* according to I'laccus and
Maternus, is placed at 5>40fl stadia. The time of rhcir second journey was twenty
day's, a more nearly correct time than the dm because it was directly north, while the first journey of thirty days had many devia¬
tion*. The travelers who several limes made the voyage kept die reckoning of each day*3
distance, and this was not only properly
done, hut done of necessity on account of the changes of the water and the weather, Just as we shouId have <louhts with regard to di$tances that are great in extent, and rarely
traveled, and not fully explored, so in regard to those that are not great and nut rarely hut
frequently gone over* it seems right to give
credit to the reports of the voyagers.
CHAPTER XI
The errors of Mannus in calculating the longitude of the habitable earth
0\V far the latitude of the habitable
earth extends is clear tu us from what
we have just stated. Marinus gives us the
longitude, between two meridians, enclos¬
ing a total space of fifteen hours.. It seems to i is that the distance eastward is shown to
be greater than it should be, and that if it be reduced, as it ought to be, it will he seen
to include not quire the space of twelve

at the extreme cast Serest oina and Calhgara.
The distance from the Fortunate I?land1?
to the Euphrates at HicropollS, which we place with Marinus on the parallel passing
through Rhodes, must be reckoned accord¬
ing to the number of stadia, determined by Marions, both because of the continual measuring of this distance by voyagers, anti
beta trie Marinus It as corrected the reports of the distance hy ascertaining the allow¬ ance to be made for deviation and the varia¬
tion!- of the rate of travel, Marinos also makes one degree of the three hundred and sixty which the largest L-i re I e contains, meas¬
ure _>OQ Stadia on the surface of the earth,
a measurement which is proved hy distances that are known and certain. Likewise the circle which passes through Rhodes, Ma
rinus shows to he jG0 distant from the
equator, and each degree to measure approx¬ imately four hundred stadia, anil the excesF
of chat itumhci (according to an exact reck¬ oning of the location of the parallels), in some measure counterbalances the defect in
the others, and is negligible in the whole
computation. The distance from the Euphrates at Hie
ropolis to the Stone Tower, Marinus gives
as eight hundred and seventy-six schena, or 26,28-0 stadia. The distance from the Stone T ower to Sera,the capital of theSer-fif, which is a journey of seven months, he
computes at 36,2.00 stadia. Since the^-c two distances are measured on The same parallel, we shall shorten both by making a neces¬ sary correction, as it is clear tliat Marinus made no reduction for deviations in cither journey, and in computing the second jour¬
ney fell into the same mistakes as those he made when measuring die distance be¬ tween the Gflrama/iUi and Agisyiuba, for in that measurement he reckoned the num¬
ber of stadia tmversed in four months, and
was compelled to make a reduction. It is quite possible that the rate of travel was
not uniform over so long a space of time, and
that this was the case In the seven months' journey it is not unreasonable to suppose,
and it is more likely to have been the case, than in the journey from the GaraWMifes
to Agisymba. This last journey was made hy the king of the country, is w as becoming
with no sinull prepara non, and was made
wholly in fine weather. The journey from the iitone l ower to Sera was exposed to
winter tempests, for it lies, according to
Marinus himself, Ofl the pa nil cl that passes through Bpanrium and the Hellespont. Wherefore there must have been many de¬
viations in that journey, especially since it vmis undertaken for the purpose of carrying merchandise. Marinus tells us that a cer¬
tain Macedonian named Maen, who was .11 so called Titian, son of a merchant father, and a merchant himself, noted the length
of this journey, although he did not come [0 Sera in person but sent others there.
Marinus does nnt seem to agree with the rinding* of these merchants, and he especial¬ ly disagrees with the statements of the mer¬
chant Philemon whose reckonings make the length of the island of Hiljemia from cast to west a twenty days' journey. Mann¬ us would not believe this, although Phile¬
mon told him that he himself had heard it from the merchants themselves, Marinus says of the merchant class gen¬
erally [hat they arc only intent on their business, and have litrle interest in explora¬ tion, and that often through their love of boasting they magnify distances. In their
journey that occupied seven months they brought no information worth remember¬ ing, and what they related on their return about the time they bad consumed in travel was nothing but an extravagant statement.

OR these reasons therefore, and be¬
cause the journey is not on one and the ^amc parallel, for the Stone Tower is on the parallel that passes through Byzantium,
and Sera is more to the south and on the parallel that passes through the Hellespont,
it seems to us proper that the number of
[he -itadin, via., 36,200, which was com¬ puted from a journey of seven months, should be cut down to not Ices than one
liiilf; and for an easier understanding only
to one-half; so that the distance in stadia may be computed as 18,100, or forty-five

the region of Agisymba, animals which, can
not he transferred to localities outside the limits of those assigned to them by nature, ' In is reason does not hold likewise in reck¬
oning the distance of tlie Stone Tower from Sera, for throughout the whole distance, lie the intervals great or small, there is the same
temperaLe climate. It is much the same as (hough si man, who could not he convicted by law as a thief, could he convicted never¬ theless, according to the rightful precepts
of philosophy. Wherefore the former distance which Alarifius gave from the Euphrates to the
Stone Tower, vi;;., 876 sclien a must be re¬
duced because of deviations on ihe journey, to only 800 fieb.cna or 24,000 stadiaj and
this is verified by the particular measure¬
ments taken on chat journey, and by the frequent visits made to those places on that journey. That the journey had deviations
is clear from statements made by Marinas
himself] for in making the journey from the ford over the Euphrates at Hieropolie through Mesopotamia lo the 'figris, and
through the Gtir&ntfmtes of Assyria anti Media to Echat-ina and the Caspian Gates, and from there through Parthia to Hochatompilum, the rig Lit cuuesc is. to follow the
parallel of Rhodes, as this parallel passes through those regions. To precede from i Jcchntompiium to the city of llyrcuniu it
is necessary to deviate to the noirth, The ci ty Hyreania lies about midway between the
Smyrna and the Hellespont parallels, the parallel of Smyrna is also called the parallel
of Hy resin in, lust the parallel of thr Hel¬ lespont passes through the southern shores
of the Hymanian sea, which ire situated
somewhat to the north of the city of Hyrcania which cakes its name from that sea.
The journey thence to Antioch .Margiatia
through Asia, lint turns to the south (since Asia is on the same parallel as the Caspian Gates), and then turns to the tiorthj since
Antioch is close to the Hellespont parallel.
I’Vom Antioch to Ractria the journey de¬ viates to the east, and after ascending the
Comedon mountains it bends to the north. I' rojii the mountains,, where it comes to the
plain at their base, it inclines to the south,
lor the mountains extend north and east.
The ascent is placed by Marimt&on the Hy
Kantium parallel, and. the southern and
eastern ranges a re located on the Hellespont
parallel. The mountains themselves he
pi;iccs to the east, but plainly extends them
so a* partially to decline to the south. Like¬
wise he fiays that the journey tor fifty schena
before coining to the Stone Tower, deviates
to the north. When you have traversed the
plain, at the base of the mountains you ar
rive at the Stone Tower, and irorn there
you come to the mountains which run hi
an easterly direction, ending at Imao which

the promontory of Cory, hence we gather that the voyage, if we subtract one-third
tor the circuit of the bay of Argaricus, may
be reckoned as 2*030 stadia, not allowing for any variation in the wind. Tf however
we subtract one-third for the variation
front a direct course owing to the winds,
there remains a distance of about 1,350 stadia in a direct northerly course. When
this ilistante is transferred to a distance
measured on the equatorial parallel, and is diminished hy one-half in proportion to the
intercepted angle, we have the distance be¬ tween the two tner i dm ns paring through
the promontory of Cory and. the city Curnla as 675 stadia or iiliout j ' 20f, bucause tile parallel drawn through these paints differs
from the greatest circle in nothing worthy of note,.
From the city of Curula the course of
navigation is, so he [ells us, toward the win¬ ter rising of the sun 0* Tar ns Palura and measures 9,450 stadia. Subtracting one
third for changes in the direction of wind
we have a distance in one direction of 6,300 stadia. Taking from this distance one-sixth
we may then reduce it to the equatorial par¬
allel and we sisal I then find the distance between these meridians to lie 5,250 stadia or ioy 30b The shore of the Gangctic bay
he places at a further distance of 19,000 stadia. From I’ul Lira to the city of Sad a is [3,000
stadia by navigating the aforesaid bay to¬
ward the equatorial rising of the sun, and since the course is directed toward the equa¬
torial rising wc must allow for the deviation
and deduct one-third. When we have done
this we are left with a distance of about 8,670 stadia Or 170 20'. Thence lie mikes the voyage from Sadn
to the city of Tnmala to measure: 3>jC)0 stadia in a direction toward the winter ris¬
ing of the sun. Deducting onc-third for
variable winds we have a distance in a straight line of 2,330 stadia, and deducting
a further one-sixth for deviation toward
Vulturous we find that the distance between
the meridians is 1,940 stadia or ahont 30 30' plus ao', that is j'J 50'.
The next distance from Tatnala to the
Golden Chersonesus he gives as [ ,600 stadia toward the winter rising of the sun, so that
a like fraction luring deducted there is a dis¬
tance left lictween tile meridians of 900 stadia or 1 0 4&\
CHAPTER XIV
Gottcormng the voyage from th0 Qclden
QharsOncsus fw C&itsgara
A R1NUS does not tell the number 1V J. of stadia from the Golden Chersone
sus to Cattigatu, but he says Alexander wrote that the shore line extends toward
the south, and that those sailing along the shore came, after twenty days, to Zaba.
From Zaba carried southward and toward
the left* they came after some days to Cat* tigara, He lengthens the distance, inter¬
preting some days to mean many day*, and
believing (ridiculously it seems to me) that the expression Some days'1 was used because t lit d ays Wt rc tOO [Daily to lie COUnted. Who
is lit ere who could not count the number of
11 ays even if they expressed the circuit of the entire earth, or what induced Alexander,
when he meant many days, to say some days?
Jlo united says concerning Dioscorus that he occupied many days sailing from Jihnpta to PrStsum. One ircry naturally would understand by some days a j&w dayst
(or that is how wo are accustomed [0 speak. Lest, however, we seem, like our friends, to
accommodate our conjectures to the num¬ ber we have laid down, let us compare the voyage from the Golden Chersonesus to Cattigan, a voyage consisting of two voy¬
ages — one voyage of twenty days to Znba,
the other of so [Me days to> Catrignra — let us compare, I say, this twofold voyage with the sailing from Aromatu to the promon¬
tory of Frosuin, which took the same num¬ ber of days aft far as Rhapta (as Tbftophilus relates), and many more to Prosurn (as
Dioscorus tells us). Now let us, 3ft Marinus did* agree that tome days and many days correspond in
meaning, when from conclusions which arc
in keeping with reason we have shown by

on the parallel which liet i6’J 25' south of
(he equator* and when the parallel drawn through Ammata to Prasum is counted as
io° 4o\ lienee it is not incongruous to assign the Hiune number of degrees to the distance be¬
tween the Golden Chersonesus and Cat
tigara by way of Zabi. The part of this distance which ties between the Golden Chersonesus and Zaha need not be lessened,
because it extendi in a straight tine, follow¬ ing the course of the equator, but tile part of the distance lying between 7aha and Cat
tigara, because Its navigation deviates to the south on its eastern shore, must be lessened,
that we may bring it to the norm of (he equator. If then we attribute half of the
degrees to both distances on account of our knowing no difference between them, and then subtract because of known deviations a third part of the degrees measured be¬
tween Znbt and Cat tigara, which were at first set down as io° 20we shall have a distance from the Golden Chersonesus to
Cat tigara equated to the position of the
equator, or about 17° io^
We have already shown that the distance
from the promontory of Cory to the Golden Chersonesus is 34° 48'. Wherefore the whole distance from Coiy to Cnttigara amounts to about 52 Q. The meridian, which
is drawn through the source of the Indus river, Marinin places just west of the most northerly promontory of the island of Ta proban a, which is opposite Cory, From
Taprobana the meridian which runs through the mouth of the baefis river is
distant a spaoe of eight hours, or i20u, and furthermore the meridian passing through
the Baetis is 50 from the meridian drawn through the Fortunate Inlands. Whence we
gather that the meridian drawn through
Cory is distant from the meridian drawn through the Fortunate Islands by a little
more than 145®. The meridian drawn
through Cat tigara is distant from the meri¬ dian through the Fortunate Islands n little
more than 1770, which very nearly agrees
with the distance wc found elsewhere by
measuring the parallel passing through
Rhodes,
If wc grant that the entile longitude as far as the metropolis of the Sines b 180”, or
twelve hours’ interval, observing that all
agree that Cattigara lies a little toward the
cast, then we can determine the length of
the parallel, passing through the island of Rhodes as measuring shout 270,000 stadia.

il E general distances of Marlnus, both
of longitude eastward and latitude
northward, we have shortened for the rca
sons wc hove already given. Besides doing this wc have altered the positions of cities in
several places where Marians has given con¬
tradictory and false traditions which lie took from various faulty editions with incorrect
notes concerning places which were wrong¬
ly said to lie opposite each other or on the same meridian. For example, he says that
Tarragona is opposite Caesarea, which he calls lol, and he says that one meridian is drawn through Tarragona and through the Pyrenees mountains, which mountains m
reality arc not a little to the cast of Tarragona, He also places Pachynus opposite Leptis Magna, and 1 Inner;] opposite Thorns. He
gives the distance from Pacliynus to 1 limem as about 400 stadia, and from Leptis to
'Haems as more than 1,500 stadia, follow¬
ing the writings of Tiniest hones, and in an¬
other place says that Tergestum is opposite Ravenna, and from the bay in the Adriatic
sea into which Hows the river Tllamcntus,
he says that Tergestum is distant toward the summer rising of the sun 4S0 sEadia, and
that Ravenna is distant toward the winter
rising 1,000 stadia. He likewise says that Chelidonia is opposite Canopus, and Acha
manta to faphos, and Paphos to Scbemii
Eum. He place* Achnmanta 1,000 stadia distant from Chelklones. Now the distance from Canopus to Scbcnnitum, according to
TimosthcncB, is 490 stadia. But if this last
distance is measured on the same meridians, then without doubt it should he greater as
lying on the circumference of a greater parallel.
After this he says that Pisa is distant in
a southerly direction from Ravenna 700
stadia, but in the division of chinas and horns he puts Fisa in the third hour inter
t 3* 1



BOOK ONE — CHAPTER XVI
val and Ravenna in rhe fourth. From Lon¬
don in Britain he puts Niomagus fifty
nine milts south, in a somewhat westerly direction.
i le places Mount At bos on the same par¬
allel as the Hellespont, and yet notwith¬ standing this, Amphipolls, and tire neigh¬
boring places on rite Hellespont parallel,
and adjoining one another, and those that
arc situated on Athos, and at the mouth of the river Strimon, he places in the fourth
clima, that is, nest below the Hellespont
parallel, hi the same way he plates almost the whole of Thrace below the Byzantine parallel, and yet al! its interior cities he
places in the ditiu that is above [he parallel. He also says he will locate Trapezes on the Byzantine parallel, after showing that Satala in Armenia is sixty miles toward the
south, when he draws the parallels he draws the Byzantine parallel through list ala, and not through Trapeze®,
He promises that he will truthfully de¬ scribe the Nile, so [hat one can trace its
course from, its source northward as far as
Meroc. Likewise he says that navigation with a north wind can he made from Aromata all the way to the lakes from which
the Mile takes its beginning, although A co¬ mma Is actually far east of the Nile. For Ptolemais Theron Vies east of Me roe and
east of the Nile a journey of ten or twelve days, and Angtistiora, which is between
Occlim peninsula ami Direft, is 3,500 sta¬ dia cast of Ptolemais and the Adulicus gulf, and from this strait to the promontory of
Great Aromata toward cite cast still, j,ooo stadia more.

he makes Italy to be hounded on the north not hy Rhetia and Norictim only, hut also
by Pannonin, and Pannoma on the sou tit he

He says that the Sogdumit and their neigh¬

habitable earth, adjoin India, but the par¬
allels through the territory of these peoples do not closely follow those two which are
drawn north of the limns, the most norther¬

CHAPTER XVII

T
H ES E and similar mistakes have been
made by Marinos, either on account of (he multitude of volumes, all disagreeing, of which he made use, or because, as he him¬
self says, he has not yet come to the last delineation of his. maps in which, so he tells tis, he would make some necessary correc¬ tions Lit the eh mas and the hour indications. In addition to these mistakes be gives us
some further assignments of localities with which the knowledge of onr times does not
agree. For example he places the bay of Sacha!ita on the western More of the prom¬ ontory of Syagros, but all who navigate these parts unanimously agree with us that it is
toward the cast from Syagros, and that
Sacha lit a is a region of Arabia, and front it the bay of Snchalitn takes its name.
Again Simylla, an emporium of India, is not only placed hy Macinus west of the
Comarris promontory, but west of the river Indus, whereas in fact it is as far to the south
as the mouths of the river, according to the testimony of those who have navigated those waters and have thoroughly explored those parts, and have come directly From
litere to us. It is called by the aborigines
LfTimu]a,}1 and from those who have come to us we have learned many more details
concerning India, especially of its divisions
Into provinces, and WC bftVt also learned much concerning its interior a* far as the
Golden Chcrsonesus, and from thcrctoCattigara. We have also learned that those who
sail there sail to eastward, ant! those return¬ ing sa i I to westward.
The navigators say that the time of the passage is uncertain, and that beyond Sin a is the region of the Saras and the city Sera,
What regions he east of this. they say are

unknown, for they have stagnant marshes, in which grow reeds so chick and so large, that
catching hold of them, and upborne by them, men can walk across these marshes, They say further that not only h there ii Way
from there to Bactriana through the Stone
Tower, but also a way to India through
PaLimbothn. The journey from the capital Sin a to
the gate of Cattigara runs to the southwest,
and therefore does not coincide with the meridian drawn through Sera and Catti
gara, as Marin us reports, hut with one
drawn more to the east. We ha ve learned also from the merchants that from Arabia Felix they sail to Aromatn^
to Azania, to Rhapta, and to the regions called Barhary. This sailing js not exactly
south; but southwest. The voyage from
Rhapta to Frasum is also southwest. The lakes from which the Nile takes its beginning are not near the sea, but are very
far inland,. The shore line from the Amniata promontory to Rhapta is otherwise
than Marimis has shown it to be; nor Can an ordinary day - and - night voyage be
counted in stadia because of the changeable
ness of the winds at the equator, but is lim¬ ited to about 40a or jOO stadia at the most.
There is, first of all, a continuous bay in which, after sailing for one ilay from A to¬ rn ata we come to Panoconc and to Oponc, an emporium, distant one day’s Sail from J'ano
cone. Sailing from the emporium, they say
that we enter another bay which marks the beginning of Aflame, at the entrance 10
which appears the Zmgis promontory, and
Mount Phalaiigis, remarkable for its three peaks. The name of this bay is Apocopa, and
it takes two days and nights to cross it, After tins is Parvum Litus (Little Shore), at the distance of two days* voyage, then Magnum Litus (Great Short). Of the five distances,
the last two arc said to occupy the same time in sailing, A further four days' wiling, they say,
brings ns to another hay, in which there is the emporium of Essina. It requires two days and nights to cross this bay; then after
a day and night sail one comes to the sea¬
port of Scrapioiiisj thence begins the hay
which leads to Rhapta, a voyage of three
days and nights. At the head of this bay
they say there is an emporium called Toni
cus, From this emporium toward the Rhap
tmn promontory there is, they inform us, a
river called Rhaplns and also a city of the
same name, not far from the sea.
The bay extending from Rhaptuin to the Prasurn promontory, although great in size,
is not of great depth, The barbarians who
dwell on its shores are cannibals.
CHAPTER XVIII
The incoTtwnicnce of the method of jVJ(in/jut for delineafirtg the
habitable earth
W
HAT is worth remembering jp. tra¬
dition and story, we have thus far set
clown, lest we should seem to have raised doubts and to have left them unsolved, lor we believe that all things will k known to
us when we have settled all the particulars. It remains for us to turn our attention to
the method of making maps.'l‘here are two ways in which this matter may he treated;
one is to represent the habitable earth as
spherical; the other is to represent it as a plane surface. Both have this common pur
posc, that is, they arc constructed for use,
to show (in the absence of any picture) how from commentaries alone the student may
be able, with the utmost facility, to construct a new map.
Recently the makingof new copies from
earlier copies has had the result of increas¬ ing some of ilic faults that were originally small into great discrepancies.. If then there
are not enough data for the method of con¬ structing maps from commentaries (with¬
out any traditional pictures), it will be im¬ possible for ns to reach our desired end. That
has happened in the work of Marinus sev¬
eral times, for copyists do new follow' his Inst
edition of a world map, blit attempt to con¬
struct a map merely from commentaries.
Thus they ait misleading In many particu¬ lars on account of their unbecoming shape
and general confusion which any one expert in geography, can easily detect. Although
it is necessary to know the longitude as well
as the latitude of any place that we may be
able to fix its right position, nevertheless in
the edition of Marinus this cannot be im¬ mediately found. For in ore place he gives
only the location in latitude, as in his ex¬ planation of the parallels, hut in another
[ 3& J



HOOK. ONE — CHAPTER XIX
place he gives only the longitude; lienee in
Ins drawing of meridians wc find* as a rule,
jio note of both longitude and latitude, but
in one instance we find reference to paral¬
lels, in other instances wc find meridians so
noted tlmt when we have one posit ion wc lack the ocher.
When we are working with comment a
ties, it is requisite to have n knowledge of both latitude and longitude at the same t ime, since in all commentaries something is al¬
ways said concerning both positions. If we were not to search out, one by one, through
the wrhole volume, the data concerning any
given place, we should miss particulars
which are worthy of note. Moreover in giving the positions of cities,
maritime cities arc the more easily describ¬ ed, and he keeps generally % certain order i n namin g th em, but i n treating of cities that
arc inland, the same method has not been employed; for the distances between them arc not noted, except in a few instances where it happens that the longitude in the
one case and the latitude in another case have been given us,
CHAPTER XIX
Of the cotroensmcc of our method of
delineating the ishotc earth
W
E Therefore are undertaking a double labor, first in keeping the intention that Marinos had throughout his whole
work, besides that which we have obtained by corrections; and second in adding those things, with as much accuracy as possible,
which to him were not known, partly on
account of history then unwritten, and part¬
ly on account of a later series of more accu¬
rate maps. In addition wc have given special atten¬ tion to n better method in fixing the bound¬
aries of each particular country; wc have given their particular position both in longi¬ tude and in latitude. After that, wc have recorded noteworthy in formation concern¬
ing (he inhabitants of the various countries,
and their relations one to another. We have noted the chief cities, rivers, gulfs, and
mountains, and all other things which in the map itself might show distances where they
arc worth knowing, that is in say how many
degrees (the great circle has 360 such de¬ grees), if it is a question of longitude, the
meridian drawn through a certain place is
distant from the meridian that marks the ut¬ most boundary of the wwt, If it is a question
of latitude, then wc note how ninny degrees
the parallel drawn through it is distant from the equator on the same meridian. Wc are able therefore to know at once the exact posi¬ tion of any particular place; and the posi¬ tion$. of the various countries, how they are
situated in regard to one another, how situ¬
ated as regards the whole inhabited world.
CHAPTER XX
Of the lack of symmetry in the maf that
accompanies the geography of Marimtt
E
ACH method of map making has some¬ thing peculiar to itself, When the earth
is delineated on a sphere, it ha$ a shape like
its own, nor is there itny need of altering at all. Yet it is not easy to provide spate large enough (on n globe) for all of the details
that arc to be inscribed thereon; nor can one fix ort^s eye at the same time on the whole sphere, but one or the other must be moved, that is, the eye or the sphere, if one wishes
to see other places. In the second method wherein the earth is represented as a plane surface there is not
(his inconvenience. But a certain adjust¬ ment is required in representing the earth as a sphere in order that the distances noted [heroin may he shown on the surface of the globe congruent, as far as possible, with the
real distance on the earth. Marinos gives this point his deepest con¬
sideration, criticising and rejecting all pre¬ vious methods of deltreating distances on the surface of a sphere, yet nevertheless he
chose a method which Sa the least satisfac¬
tory of all for locating distances with cong rue ncy, For with rega rtl to the 1 ines which he inserts for the parallels and meridians he
writes in at equal distance from one another,
as is the general custom, in the form of straight parallel lines. Only the parallel through Rhodes has be
kept in rigid proportion to its meridian ami the circumference of the equatorial circle.
This parallel is distant 36° from the equa¬
tor. In this he follows almost exactty the
l 39 1



PTO LEMYJS GEOGRAPHY
method of Epitccartus. In the case of the
Other parallels lie has paid no at tent ton whatever either to the right proportion of
their length,, or to their spheric shape*
At the outset, if the eye is fixed on the middle of the fourth part of the northern hemisphere, in which part the most popu¬
lated portion of the world is situated, the
meridians will have the appearance of straight lines, when the sphere is turned,
and that surface comes directly under the
eye. But this cannot be the ease if they are parallel lines on account of the elevation of
the north polcj for the segments of the
circles clearly show their curvature in the direction of the meridian, Now according to both truth and appearance the same me¬
ridians intercept the similar hut unequal cir¬ cumferences of the parallels which differ in length but arc always greater the nearer they are to the equator,
Marinos notwithstanding makes all the
interceptions equal, rl"he space of the cli¬ mates north of the parallel passing through
Rhodes, he extends beyond the actual, and
the climates in the south lie makes smaller than the actual. It follows that the distances
of places from one another as shown on his
map cannot k the same as their measured stadia, for rite distances that ire on the equa¬ tor lack one-fifth of their given measure¬
ment, which i$ the proportion the parallel passing through Rhodes is less than the equator. 1 'he distances that a re on the paral¬ lel pissing through Thole, Marinus in¬
creases by four-fifths, which is the propor¬ tion the parallel through Rhodes £s greater than the parallel passing through Thule. It
being given that there are one hundred am! fifteen parts into which we divide the equa¬ tor, of these parts the parallel passing through Rhodes, which is 36° distant from
the equator, measures 93and further the pafallrl which is 63° distant from the equa¬
tor, and passes through Thule, measures
fifty-two such parts.
CHAPTER XXI
What mwt be done should one desire to delineate the earth On a plane surface
HEREFORE we shill do well to keep straight lines for our meridians,
hut to insert our parallels as the arcs of cir¬
cles-, having one and the same center, which
we suppose to Lie the north pale, and from
which we draw the straight lines of our meridians, keeping above all else similarity
to a sphere in the form and appearance of
our plane surface. 'flic meridians must not bend to the par¬
allels, and they must be drawn from the same
common pole. Since it Es impossible for ill
of the parallels to keep the proportion that there is in a sphere, it will he quite sufficient
to observe tit is proportion in the parallel cir¬ cle running through Thule and the equi¬
noctial, in order that the sides of our map which represent latitude may he propor¬
tional t to the true and natural sides of the earth.
The parallel passing through Rhodes must he inserted because on this pari]Id very many pmols of distances have been regis¬
tered and inserted in right relation to the
circumference of the greatest circle, follow¬ ing in this Marinus who followed Epitecarcus. By thus doing we shall insure that
the longitude of our earth, which is the bet¬ ter known, will be in right proportion m the
latitude. We will now show how this may
he done, treating first, as far as is necessary, of the properties of a sphere.
CHAPTER XXII
Menu the habitable earth may be
shown on & sphere
HE intention of the individual who wishes to make a globe, having regard to the grater or smaller number of place
names he may wish 10 insert, will determine
the size of the globe, which, in accord with his ahllity and purpose will be constructed.
The larger it is made, the clearer and the fiilter will he the description of the various
places chat are indicated on its surface.
Whatever size the globe to be constructed may have, the position of the poles being de¬
termined, let there be connecting them a
semicircle which we will place a very little distance from the globed surface, so that
when it revolves it almost touches it. Let
this semicircle be narrow that it may not cover many places by its width. Divide one side into 1 So divisions, and markon this the
numbers, beginning at the middle which
l 40 |



BOOK ON fi — <J K A l1 T M. R. XXUl
cuts the equator. Repeat this; process for the Other side.
Ill like ilia liner draw the equinoctial line; divide this second semicircle into a like
number of parts, viz,, 180, and begin the
numbering from the limit of the most west¬
ern men d i a n. Begin the work of iiwcribi ng by noting the degrees of longitude and lati¬
tude assigned to the various places in the known commentaries. Insert each of the places in its right position on the globe, find¬
ing the position of the intersection of the
parallels of latitude with the movahte me¬ ridians as we previously explained,
Next inscribe the degrees of longitude
found in 1 fie commentaries, at the points where the meridians cut the parallels of lat¬
itude. Mark the degrees of latitude along a
meridian line, then you can pin in the locali¬ ties in their ascertained positions in the man¬
ner in which it is customary to fix stars on a sohd sphere. We can insert meridians of whatever number we wish, by using semi¬ circles, instead of straight lines,' I 'he position of the parallels of latitude we can indicate
by placing our instrument lor drawing par¬
allel lines in its proper position* which position when found with regard to one meridian, we can then adjust to the other
meridians* including both meridians that shut in the habitable world.
CHAPTER XXIII
Explanation of the martdavit and fmaUch
used in our delineation
T
HH meridians* according to what we
have already shown, will embrace the space of twelve hours. The parallel that bounds the most southern limit of the habit¬
able world will be distant from the equator
in a southerly direction only as far as the parallel passing through Merne is distant in
a northerly direction. It has seemed proper to us to put in the meridians at a distance from cadi Other lhe
third part of an equinoctial hour, that i*j
through five of the divisions marked on the equator. The parallels that are north of the equator we have inserted so that: The first parallel is distant from the equa¬
tor the fourth part of an hour, and is, distant from it geometrically about 4“ 15',
Tile second paral lel we make distant half
an hour from the equator, and geometrical¬
ly distant 8° 15', The third parallel we make distant from
the equator three-fourths of an hour, and geometrically 12° 30'.
'Phe fourth parallel is distant one hour and is i6y . This is the parallel through Mcroc.
The fifth parallel is distant one and onefourth hours, and 20” t Hie Sixth parallel, which is under the
summer solstice is distant one and one-half hewn;, and 2350', and is drawn through Sycnc.
The seventh parallel is distant one anti three-fourths hours, and 27c t o*. The eighth parallel is distant two hours,
and 30" 20', 'Phe ninth parallel it distant two and onefourth hours, and 33° 20'. The tenth parallel is distant two and onehalf hours, anil 36°, anti is drawn through Rhodes,
The eleventh parallel is distant two and
three-fourths hours, and 38° 33'. The twelfth parallel is distant three
hours, and.400 55'. The thirteenth parallel is distant three
and one-fourth hours, and 430 03r. The fourteenth parallel is distant three
and one-half hours, and 45°.
The fifteenth parallel is distant tour
hours, ami +8° 30'. The sixteenth parallel is distant four and one-half hours* and 5 iL 30'.
The seventeenth parallel is distant five
hours, and 34 The eighteenth parallel is distant five and
one-half hours, and 56 ' io\ The nineteenth parallel is distant seven
hours, and 38°. The twentieth parallel is distant seven
hours, and 61 'llie twenty-first parallel is distant eight
hours, and 631', and is the parallel drawn
through Thule. Resides these, one other parallel must be drawn south of the equator with the tune
difference of half ati hour- It should pass through Rhaptum promontory and Cattigara, and should he about the same length as
the parallel in the opposite part of the earth
which is distant 8° 2£' north of the equator.

K the delineation which is made in the

of showing the proportions of the speciat parallels* We will draw a right-angled par¬
allelogram A BGD, the side All of which is
about twice as long as the side AG, (See Figure L)
Place the side AB uppermost which will represent the northern limit of the delinea¬
tion. We will then divide the side AE in half by the line KZ drawn to it at right angles; and to this line we will so const met the congruent normal straight line that, midway of the length of the former line (Aft), it makes one and the same straight line with EZ, that is, then, the line EH,
Now let the line EH consist of thirty-four parts, then HZ will measure I 3 I anti fivetwelfths. WithH as a center anti at a distance
of seventy-nine parts measured along the line HZ, draw the circle TKL, which will represent the parallel tlirough Rhodes, Then, that we may arrive at the limits of
longitude which are distant at intervals of siV hours measured on hc-th sides of the point
K, we will take a distance measuring tour
parts on the line HZ, the line of the median meridian,, which is equal to five on the par¬ allel of Rhodes, for the reason that the ratio
of a great circle to that parallel is as that
of a quinary number to a quaternary, as it is measured by Kpiteeartus, Measuring
nine of these parts from the center K along
the parallel through Rhodes I11 both direc¬
tions, we liave eighteen points through which to draw meridian* with H as a center.
Any one of these meridians will differ ift
time from the next by one-third part of ait hour, anti also those meridians which bound
the edge of the known world will lie HTM
and HLN, fn the same manner the parallel of Thule is drawn at an interval which is distant fifty
two parts lrein II lji the line 11Z: this 1* the
arc COP; then we will draw the equinoc¬ tial line IbR from the center H with a radius
of ] i 5 parts, and the southernmost parallel,
opposite that drawn through Meroe, MYN at 3:1 interval of 13 1 and five-twelfths parts
distant from H.
The ratio of the are RSI and COP will be the same as that of the numbers 1 (5 and
which is the ratio of these parallels on a
globe, since (lie line is made up of 11 § parts such as the 52 of the line HO, and as the
ratio of the line 1 IS to HO so is the are 1SR
to cor.
Now there remains the distance on the meridian OK or that lietween the parallel passing through Thule and that through Rhodes, which is found to measure twentyseven parts, or segments, and the distance between the parallel of Rhodes and the
equator which should measure thirty-six parts or segments, and finally the distance between the equator and the parallel oppo¬
site that passing through Me roe which should measure sixteen and five-twelfths like parts or segments.
Furthermore OY representing the extent
in latitude of the known world is seventynine and five-twelfths such units,or in whole
numbers eighty, the median extent in longi¬
tude re prescnted by TKL will be 144, which agrees with those which are fixed by the authority of geographers; about the same
proportion have the 40,000 Stadia of lati¬
tude to the 72,000 stadia of longitude in the parallel of Rhodes. From the same center
H, and at intervals distant from b the same number of parts or segments %vc have given
alxjve, we can draw as many of the remain¬ ing parallels as we wish.
Now i n dee d we a re no t perm i t led to c a ri y

and with the arc MYK divided in both di¬
rections into ninety pans or segments, equal
in size and number to those taken on the
parallel of Moroe we can then draw to these
marked points the intervening straight lines
from those points marked in the equator

ward (he south on the other side of the equa¬
tor such as arc the lines RF and IX*
I hen, that we may the more easily mark
the localities which ate to he placet! on the
map, lei ns take a narrow ruler, equal in
length to the lire HZ or to the line IIS, and
so attach it at the point II that it can lie
moved, and when it is swung over, through¬
out the length of the map, one of its sides
can be applied to tire meridian line tor its en¬
tire length, by means of a notch in the side
just at the pole* This. done, let us divide this
side into 13 [ and live-twelfths parts or seg¬
ments corresponding to the line HZ or at
least into r 15 segments on rhe line HS, and
We then number these segments beginning
at the equator. Through these numbers we
shall be able trs draw parallels to the south
cm most parallel which we have put d Own
on our map. If* however, we divide the me¬
ridian 0Y on the map into all of the seg¬
ments, and put the numbers beside them, we
ire apt ty eon fuse the writing in of the places
situated next to them. Having divided the
equator into r8o " embracing a space oi
twelve hours, and having given them: num¬
bers beginning from the west we may at
wiays carry lorward the edge of the ruler to
my indicated degree of longitude, binding
died the given posLlinn in latitude hy means
of the division made on the ruler we can
make the correct notation of every tocality,
just as we have demonstrated above in the
case of spherical delineation.
We shall lie able 10 make a much greater
resemblance to the known world in our map
if we see the meridian lines, that we have
drawn, in that form in which meridian lines
appear on a globe, when the axis of the eyes
is imagined as directed upon a motionless
globe through a point IkEotg the eyes in
which occurs the intersection of that merid¬
ian and that parallel which divides respec¬
tively the longitude ami the latitude oi Lite
known earth into two equal juirt?, and also
through the center of the globe, 50 tint the
extreme parts which he opposite each other
appear and arc perceived hy the eye in like
condition.
First, however, in order that we may'de¬
termine how great is the inclination of the
parallel circles and of that plane which is
passed through that point of intersection
and tit rough the center of the globe at right
angles to the median meridian in longitude,
the great circle limiting the hemisphere be¬
fore our eyes is taken, i, e. the line A BCD
(see Figure II), and the semicircle of that
t itil.'ith IT
meridian which divides the hemisphere in
halves, is the line AEG, and the point In
which, before our eyes, this semicircle
intersects the parallel cutting the middle
latitude, is the point £•; then through the
point E there is drawn the semicircle of
another great circle RED so that it makes
right angles with the semicirele AEG, its
plane, as \s apparent, folk upon the axis oE
the eyes; and with the arc EZ, of twenty
live and live-rixths degrees marked off (for
by tills many degrees, in fact, is the equator
distant from the parallel passing through
Syecie, which is placet! almost in rhe median
latitude of the known world), there is also
described, through the point Z, the semi¬
circle RZD of the equator.
Therefore both the equatorial plane and
the plane of the other parallels will appear
i ndi n ed t wenty-t h roe and ft ve -si x thsdegrees
to the plane placed in the axis of the eyesj
and of so many degrees is the arc EZ.

is also then drawn Til, which plainly is the perpendicular to the line BZ. Mow since the straight line RE is of ninety parts anrl EZ of twenty-three and five-sixths, the hy¬ potenuse, HZ, will be ninety-three and

and one-third (units) of the 360, which is the measure of two right angles; the other angle which is equal to'I'HZ or twenty-nine
and two-tliivds of the same units. For the same reason, the ratio of the line HZ to ZT is that which 181 and five-sixths has to forty

when the delineation is to be made upon a
plane* Having settled these preliminaries let u,s draw again the map AJ3G1) (see Figure

Now divide E2 into ninety parts, the
number of degrees in a quail rant of a circle, then the lire ZH which is marked off at
sixteen anti live-twelfths degrees, HT at twenty-three and five-six tils degrees, IIK at sixty-three of the same; if we consider the
point 11 as lying in the equinoctial line, then
the point T will he that through which is
drawn the parallel of Syene which is located almost in the middle of the habitable earth,

drawn the parallel which terminates die northern boundary of the known world run¬ ning ilirough the island of Thule, Now if
we produce rhe line ZE, and in this pro¬ duced line we make HE to have 181 and five-jixths of the same segments, or even
1 8gdegrees (whether wc take the one num¬
ber nr the other does not make much dif¬
ference in our imp^s appearance), then let us
draw the arcs PKR and CTO, and MZN,
with the center L and intervals K, T, Z. In

HOOK ONE —CHAPTER XXIV
ih]£ manner, let us keep the fight ratio of the
inclination of the parallel* to the plane that corresponds to the line of vision when the line of vision is made to direct itself to the
point T rmd is necessarily perpendicular to the phine of the map, so that in consequence the extreme parts of the map which arc drawn opposite to one another arc equally well discernible.
RllIj in order that longitude may agree
with latitude, let it be our task to deter¬
mine tlic eighteen meridians so that the number of semicircles may be complete, hy
which all longitude is embraced, since on a globe a great circle is made up of five parts such as t lie parallel of Thu It: has a hour two and one-fourth, that of Sycnc frmt and
seven-twelfths and that of Me roc four and five-sixths, anti since on either side of the meridian line ZK., at every third part of an
equatorial hour, the number is completed;
we take segments which on each of these three parallels are equivalent to one-third of an hour, or rive degrees; that is, segment* of which the lire l^z contains ninety, and
we make incisions on the three parallels at
two and one-fourth unit? from K, at four and seven-twelfths frum the point J', and at
(bur and five-sixth* from the point Z. Then when we have drawn the arcs through rite three mutually corresponding points to rep¬
resent the other meridians, as also the arcs SIY and FXQ, which are the limits of longi¬
tude, we shall also add the other arcs to ncprcscjTt the remaining parallels, again
with the center L, and at intervals of as many segments as are to be made on the line ZK for the distance of the parallels from the
equinox. Thai a greater likeness to a sphere is
achieved by this method than hy the former will be self-evident. When the sphere stand*
motionless before the eyes, and is not re¬ volved (which necessarily holds true for a
plane map), anil the eye rests on the middle
of the object, one certain meridian which, because of the globe's position, lies at the middle of the plane passing through the axis of the eye, will exhibit the appearance
of a straight line, while those on either side
Appear mhexed with thgir concave side to¬
ward it, and die more so as they lie farther
from it, which is also observed here with
exact analogy, just as it is also seen chat the
symmetry of the parallel arcs keeps the proper ratio of one to another, not only in the equatorial line and the paral lel of Thule (as was done in the former case j, hut m the
others also, as closely as they can be made — the thringiilty of doing this is evident
and that the conformity of latitude as a
whole serve toward a true, general Ion git ode ratio, not only in the parallel drawn Through
Rhodes, but in all of the parallels. Now if we produce the straight line
SWY, os was done (n the earlier figure, the ate TW clearly makes a smaller ratio to the aresZS and KV than that proper one which
is shown in this map and which occurs in the arc IT; and i f we were to make this arc
TW agree with the extension KZ of lati¬
tude, the arcs ZB and KV will be greater
than those which agree with the hue ZK just as arc IT itself is larger; and if we
take the arcs ZS and KY to agree with the
line ZK, the arc WT will be smaller than
that corresponding to the line KZ, just as it is smaller than the arc IT. Although lor these reasons this method
of drawing the map ls the better one, yet it
is less satisfactory in this respect, that it is not assimpleasthe other; because with that
method, when the ruler is applied and car¬ ried over the map, given even one parallel
drawn in and divided, individual localities, can he put i Li pi ace j here, howevu r, s tnce
such a thing can no longer be done, by rcawin of the meridian line being indexed at the middle, all of the other circles must be written in, and positions which lie inside those quadrate circles mu*t he found by con¬ jecture, after finding rheir relation from the given data to the whole sides which limit
the article*, Since tit Is is so, even though for me both here ami everywhere ihe better and more difficult scheme is preferable to
the one which is poorer and easier, yet both methods are to me retained for the sake of those who, through laziness, arc drawn to
that certain easier method*

HAT Which should he condtleral in
general geography must here he ex¬
plained, and also how the drawing of imps
should he emended in keeping with the pres¬ ent knowledge of the known parts of our
habitable earth, as far as it concerns the ques¬
tion of the relation of place to place, and also their likenesses, and the method of depicting
them. Beginning with the particular narration
let us first make a statement respecting the degrees of longitude and latitude which
have been assigned to well‘known places*
Approximately these arc correct, since the. traditions concerning them are continuously
the same; that is, in the main the traditions
agree. Blit as to the degrees ascribed to lo¬ calities not as yet thoroughly explored, be¬
cause of the incomplete and uncertain
knowledge wc have of these places, they should be computed rather from their near¬
ness to the localities ilready laid down, and
the inOre thoroughly explored. This should
be done lest any of those localities which have Keen inserted fur completing the whole earth7* picture should he without a fixed and
definite place.
Therefore we have written on the mar¬ gins of the pages notations respecting the
different degrees of different places, and
have used these as measurements, in the first place of longitude; then we have noted the
degrees o£ latitude in such manner that if
any corrections must be made, from 1 fuller investigation, they can he inserted in the ad¬ joining spaces which 11 avc been left vacant
between the separate pages.
Moreover we have selected the projec¬ tion which wc especially consider the best in tile making Ot maps, this being the; tine in
which wc start at the right hand. The work
may then proceed from places already in¬ serted to those not yet inserted. This can best be carried nut it wc write in the northern latitudes before the sou the in ones, and the western before the eastern ones; since to the eye of the writer or reader the northern lo¬
calities appear in the upper part, and the eastern appear 011 the right hand, on both
the globe and the map of the habitable earth.
First ni ;l 11, therefore, let Us sit down
Europe which we separate from Libya by the Straits of Hercules, anti from Asia, after
WC have put in the seas :md the swamp of Myotis, by the river Tams and by the me¬
ridian drawn through it to the unknown re¬ gion; then let us put in Libya ami place it likewise next £0 the sea which extends from
the bay lying near Prasum,a promontory of Ethiopia, as far as the Gulf of Arabia, Let ns separate Libya from Asia by the isthmus
which extends from the interior of Hcroo
polfticus to our sea, and separates Egypt from Arabia and Judea, Let us do this that
wc may not divide Egypt, in making a divi¬
sion of the continent, by the Nile, because continents are bounded more properly,
where it is possible, by seas than by rivers. In the last place lei us put in Asia, keep¬
ing the same plan as in the parts of each eon

tinent, of disposing »l each of them accord¬ ing to its relation to the whole earth, and to the entire inhabited regions in the continents themselves, first writing in the toast that is most northern, then the western, and the
scat and the island*that art nearest together, ami those which in some particular are most worth}r of mention.
After this let us distinguish, in the de¬ scriptions, die various prefectures, and provinces of the earth, treating them as we have before noted, in accord with the known
positions of localities and according to what
especially ought to he inserted, spurning the
multitudinous traditional farrago concern¬ ing the peculiar qualities of their different inhabitants, except that, in the case of quali¬ ties renowned by general report, wc make
a short and suitable note on the religion and
manners- Li tills way the opportunity will he given to any erne, who desires it, for draw¬ ing the parts of the carill in maps accord¬
ing to tlic particular prefectures and prov¬ inces, one or many, and the right relation of the places of each other on the maps will be
preserved, together with the rigJu sise and the right shape. Nor will it make much dif¬ ference if in these mops wc use parallel me¬ ridian straight lines instead of curved lines,
provided wc keep the proper proportion of tilt meridian degrees to the degrees marked on the great circle, that is thcequatorT which is in the middle of every map.
Having stated these things, let us begin our particular descriptions with the western part of Europe according to its provinces or prefectures.

ASSYRIA is terminated on the north by jt\ the part of Armenia Major, as we
have said,, next to the NaphlteS mountains;
on the west alone by Mesopotamia along the
designattd part of the Tigris river; on the south by Susiana to the boundary which runs
along the Tigris river to the terminus, the
location of which i s i n S 4 36
on the east by the part of Media extending along the boundary joining those two ter*
mini, tvhich we have named, along which boundary arc the Chmthras mountains, the
terminal locations of which
So 39 jo
are and 38
The part of this land which is near Armenia is called Arrapachitis; that which
is near Susiana is called Sittaccna; between
these the Garamaei dwell; near these be¬
tween Arnpachitis and the Garamact is Adiiulcna; that which is between the Gam
maei and Sittaccna is called A pul I on i las, and the race of tht Samhutoe is above this; above Adiahena is located Calaoena and above the Garmnact is the Arbelitis region.
Rivers flowing through this land empty
into the Tigris river, as the Lyon, the sources of which rivers are

could be marked Out on a sphere, anti on a
plane in such manner as to be most truth¬ ful and with relative dimensions such as
are to be found on a solid, sphere j it is
fitting to add to the exposition of the whole
inhabited earth an epilogue lor the demon¬
stration of those tilings, which have been
expounded in generalj this now will be
a ppmpr lately done,
CHAPTER V
A descriptive lUrrtmary of the mop of the
inhabited earth
W
E have divided the jiihabifed regions
into three large divisions as seemed
proper to the ancient writers who examined
these areas, and have left us (heir conclu¬ sions in their commentaries, as we ourselves desire todo, partly from what we have seen
and partly from the tradition! of others We have set ourselves to depict such a map of
the whole inhabited earth presenting noth¬ ing untried concerning those things which in part are useful and can well fill the mind
by giving it something which is historical, □musing and exciting it to exercise its powers.
That part of the earth which is in habited by us is bounded on the east by the unknown land which borders on the eastern races of
Greater Asia, namely the Smae and the Scrcsi and On the south by the likewise un¬
known land which encloses the Indian sea
and which encompasses Ethiopia south of Libya, the country called Agisymba, and on the west by the unknown land encircling
the Ethiopian gulf of Libya and by the Western ocean bordering on the western¬
most parts of Africa and Europe,, and on the north by tlie continuous ocean called the
Ducalydonian and Sarmatian which encom¬
passes the British islands and the northern¬
most parts of Europe, and by the unknown
land bordering on the northernmost parts of Greater Asia, that is to say on Sannatia
and Scythia and Serka, The water more¬ over is much greater in extent than is the
land.
Our sea (Mediterranean) has many bays which open into it — the Adriatic,, the
Aegean, the Propontis, the Euxinc, and the Sea of Maeotis—and it flows into the ocean
tlirough but one outlet, the Straits of Her¬
cules resembling an isthmus, for those nar¬
row inlets of the sea have the shape of a chersonesus. The llyrcmnium sea, called
also the Caspian, is suiroutided on all sides
L 1$$ J



PTOLEMY’S GEOGRAPHY
by land aiul has the shape of an istand j and
we may say the same of the Indian sea, for with its gulfs, the Arabian, the Persian, the
Cangetic, and that which is called the Great gulf, it is entirely shut [n, like the Caspian
by land on all sides. Wherefore the entire
earth consists of three continents, Asia,
Africa, and Europe. Asia is joined to Afri¬ ca by the part of Arabia enclosed by our sea and the Gulf of Arabia, and by the un¬ known land which it washed hy the Indian sea, and is joined to Europe by the land
which lies between the Sea (swamp) of
Maeoiis and the Sirmttx sea in which is the basin of the river Tani^
Africa Is separated front Europe by the
Atlantic Straits of Hercules, touching Europe nowhere by itself but only through
Asia since the latter is coterminous with
both the other comments along their eastern borders.
Of these three parts of the world Asia
is the largest, Africa is next in size and Europe is the smallest. Of the seas sur¬ rounded by land, as lias been said before,
the first In $i;reis the Indian sea, the second is Our sea, the third is the Hyrcanlum or
Caspian. Of the most notable gulfs the first and largest is the Gangetic, the second is the Persian gulf, the third is that one which
is called the Great gulf, the fourth is the
Arabian, the fifth the Ethiopian, the sixth the Pontic, the seventh is the Aegean sea, the eighth is tile Maeotis, the ninth the
Adriatic sea, the tenth the Propontis.
Of the most noted islands the first is Taprohana, the second the island of Albion,
one of the British islands, the third is the
Golden Chersonesus, the fourth is J libernip one of the British islands, the fifth is the
Pteloponesw, the sixth is Sicily, the seventh Sardinia, the eighth Corsica also culled Cyrnus; the ninth Crete, the tenth Cyprus,
The southern boundary of the inhabited earth is defined hy the parallel which is
south of the equator sixteen degrees and
twenty-five minutes of such degrees as are
those of which the great circle has three hundred and sixty, and the parallel through
Meroe is precisely the same number of de¬ grees north of the equator. The most north¬
ern parallel i& .sixty-three degrees north of the equator and is, called the parallel pass¬
ing through the island of Thule. Where¬
fore the breadth of the entire earth, which
as yet is known to us is seventy-nine degrees
and twenty-five minutes, or approximately
eighty degrees or 40,000 stadia, inasmuch
as one degree measures, foo stadia, as has
lieen found by careful measurement, and the circuit of the whole earth is [ 9o,ooo stadia.
The extreme eastern region of the world
known to uz is defined by the meridian pass¬
ing through the (Metropolis of Sinac, which
meridian is distant from that drawn til rough
Alexandria measured to eastward on the equator, one hundred and nineteen andonelialf degrees, that is, about eight hours.
The extreme western limit is defined by the meridian drawn through the Fortunate
Isles which is distant from the meridian of
Alexandria sixty and one-half degrees or
four equatorial hours, and distant from the semicircle which Is farthest east one hun¬
dred and eighty degrees or twelve equatorial hours. Therefore the known length of the
earth, measured along the equator, is ninety
thousand stadia, hut measured along the
most southern parallel is approximately
eighty-six thousand three hundred and fifty
stndLe, and measured along tilt most north
ern parallel It is forty thousand tight hun¬ dred and fifty-four stadiaj and again, along the parallel of Rhodes, upon which meas¬
urement? arc usually made, and which is
thirty-six degrees distant from the equator,
approximately seventy-two thousand stadia; and along the parallel through Syciic, which
is twenty-three degrees and fifty minutes irom the equator, being in about the middle of the world's breadth, is eighty-two thou¬
sand three hundred and thirty-six stadia. These calculations are made according to
the proportion of the aforesaid parallels to
rhe equator. The length therefore of the inhabited earth is greater than its breadth,
in the northernmost climates by approxi¬
mately one-fifth of the breadth, ami in the
climate of the parallel of Rhodes hy about
one-sixth more, and of that under the paral¬
lel of Syenc by an amount equal to that
along the paraltcl of Rhodes, and in the
southernmost dimates about the same, and
along the equator by as much and in addition one-fourth.

CHAPTER VI
Description of the Anaitiary Sphere with
a representation of the inhabited earth
I
N what we have stated above concerning
the relative location of different places
on the earth we have made use of equal
measurements. It will not be out of place
to add to this an explanation of the way jn which our earth can he depicted on a plane surrounded hy an arm illary sphere. Several
have attempted to give this demonstration but have ended with this most absurd state¬
ments uLet those represent the earth as a sphere wh o understand theca rthJ5 ] ote rior.’i
Let it now be our plan to delineate on a plant an armillary sphere enclosing a part
of the earth, with the assumption that the point of view is such that we look directly at the intersection of the meridian passing through the signs of the tropics ant! cutting
in half the length of the inhabited earth and the parallel drawn through Syene which
cuts in half the breadth of the inhabited
earth. Let the calculations of the size of the
armiliary sphere, of the earth, and the dis¬ tance of the point of view be such, that in the interval between the circle of the equator
and that along the circle of the summer
solstice the whole known part of the earth shall appear with the more southerly semi¬
circle constructed to appear through the
middle of the circle upon the earth, in
order that there may nol he by this any obscuration of the in habited earth placed
in the northern hemisphere. Following
this plan it is clear that the aforesaid me¬
ridians will present the appearance of one
straight line following the same axis, and
further for like reason as the parallct
through Syene will appear perpendicular
to that line it will make all others appear to be drawn in the form of curves to these
straight tines, namely, the meridian which
Cuts both poles and the parallel which is
drawn clirough Syene, and let these lines be more curved than others which are more
distant from the straight lines, which is an obvious adjustment. An easy method whereby we can give a
representation, to the eye, as nearly as pos¬
sible, will be as follows: Let tile meridian which crosses the equa¬
tor on the sphere be marked A B C D, and
passing through the center E the diameter
rrcuitv v
A E C. Let A be the arctic pole, and let C be the antarctic pole. Let us then take
B F and L> C, and B H and D K on the circumference covering the distance that
the tropics are from the equator; also A L and A M, N C and C O at distances of the arctic and antarctic poles; and let us divide
the summer solstice A E at P. Since then the parallel passing through Syene should foil between E and F, and the ratio of the
parallel through Syene to the equator is
that of about four to five, let the length of
E P which divides E P A be about four to
l 161 J



PTOLEMY'S GEOGRAPHY
fifteen (i. e. 2,4® to 9tr ), thus E A will be
four think (the length ) of the line passing
through the center of the earthLei us. also take E Q nf three parts of the.
same length attach of the four parts of R A,, and with the center K and the radius E Q
there is drawn the circle Q R which extends a found the earth in the same plane- Then
making use of a straight line equal in length
to E Q and dividing it into ninety equal
parts, or one quad rant, E P is given sixtythree such parts, E S sixteen and five
twelfths, anti E T sixty-three of the same
paits. Produce X S Y to intersect the perpen¬
dicular, namely that along the parallel of
Syciie, T will lit us be the point through
which is drawn the parallel cutting the soul hem limit of tine inhabited earth, or
that opposite the parallel through Meroe, and Y is similarly the point through whieh is drawn the parallel limiting the arctic
boundary passing through Thule.
Then take another point more to the
south tlianT as Z, and let Z and D be joined,
and let S Y and Z D be produced to meet at W„ If then we regard these circles as in the plane through the signs of the tropics
and the poles, and through the axis of the eye (the lines) produced from W to A C
through M, G, 15, K and O make thereon sections of five parallels toZ through which is drawn tlic equator 1) A. Those parallels
which join\V to D, B, F, II, and C, make at
A C the sections through which are drawn
the terminal pans of the earth on the same parallels- Likewise also in drawing the parallels to he described on the earth, taking
upon Li R the individual distances from the
equator, as Z and T, the sect ions of the semi¬
circle Q V R made by these straight lilies joined from W, and opposed to these Sec¬
tions points at corresponding distances, we will have the sections, as seen by the eye,
of five parallels to W, through which is drawn the equator D- The lines from W to Ll, B, F, H, and C make portions such
as A T B and C T E the same as A E of the
aforesaid parallels. Taking from these the
intervals of the Several meridians 011 either side of A V, and on the line X Y, and in the proper ratio on three parallels, we draw
through the corresponding three points the
portions of the neighboring meridians, as
also those terminating longitude K Y, F G,
and P C.
Tlic number of lines to be drawn on the
map will be determined by the amount of
t h c dcscriptive male r ini to he inserted, Care must be taken in the planning of the circles that each be graded through the four as¬
sumed points, and care taken in the picture
that it docs not end too sharply in the section
of the circled termination and that it pro¬
duces no extraordinary appearance. Also the circle must he adapted to its contents, although, ihe names of cities may he inserted
outside the circle of the map itself (that
is, in the margin) by surrounding in that
ease the defective appearance of tlic map
with an outer circle which agrees with the
true circle itself Care must be taken that die lines through the poles art circles wi th su [table d i fie rentes of width and color. Moreover the portions
which are placed outside the earth should
have laintcr color than the portions which
arc offered to our view, and because they
arc more remote than the parts to which they urc joined, lot them lie shown in their
true likeness in circles and spaces of their
own.
In addition, as to the circles of the signs, let them fall on the earth along the more
southern semicircles and through the win¬
ter solstice, and let us give them in places
here and there their proper denominations.
On the circles of the earth itself let us write
their distance or degree numbers, and the hour numbers 0f tha11 ocation. Let us place
around the outside circle the names of the wintis likewise, j ust as on the circular sphere
at the adjacent five parallels and tlic poles.
CHAPTER VII
Epilogue to the fiwegiWig
I
T seems fitting to insert an epilogue
niter the foregoing. Our representation
of an armillary sphere (with the earth
placed in the same) will he understood if
the eye is fixed on a locality in relation to
which tlic meridian circle (a$ commonly
divided) pusses between the points that
mark the tropics ami becomes a straight line,
which straight line as a circle divides into two equal parts, as noted, the longitude of
the inhabited earth.
[ i€a ]



IJOQK SEVEN — CHAPTER VII
Moreover the parallel which we draw through Syene Es a circle which has a lati¬
tude almost equal to that given to the earth
itself.. Let the ratio of the size be so ar¬
ranged, that is* of the sphere and the earth
and the perspective itself, that in the space which lies between the circle of the equi¬
noctial line and the circle of the summer solstice, the entire inhabited earth may he
shown to us. (See title-page illustration.)
Let the more southern semicircle be
drawn on the earth through the middle cir¬
cle oi the signs j let there be no northern ad¬ dition to our habitable earth which extends to the hemisphere of the arctic. Where¬
fore the said meridian lines, drawn around the axis of one straight tine, will give us a fanciful representation, as though the eye
were surveying a plane surface, and the
parallel which is drawn through Sycnc
will seem for the same reason to lie a straight
line. The rest of the true circles, drawn
through the cities, will appear as straight
lines. Let the meridians be adjusted to that which passes th rough Syene, and let the
parallels lie the more carefulty adjusted which are the more distant from it on both sides, in order that the arctic circle may curve more toward the north than the sum¬
mer solstice, and the winter solstice curve more than the equator because it is bent more
to the south, and the Antarctic circle curve
more than the winter solstice.
The known part of the earth is so situated that it is nowhere entirety walled around hy the ocean, except only in case of the land of Kaptis, which belongs in part to
Africa and in part to Europe* according to the testimony of the ancients.

1. What presuppositions are necessary in
making a division of our habitable earth
in the nitip^
2. What adaptations must be made in each
map.

CHAPTER I
What frcmpfOsitions er? neettsary in ntaking j? drtiijjQM of oar habitable earth
in the maps
IIAT is the part of the diligent and
assiduous traveler in the field of geo¬
graphical investigations; what is the part of n reasonable consideration 0/ the subject
matter of geography with which we are familiar anti which is within our province
rather than that of the former; all this we have sufficiently explained, in my opinion. As the practice of our predecessors ad¬
vises us, we should lie re repeat], by incam
of an epilogue, through what places each parallel or meridian is drown, ksi we should hecome subject to ridicule in setting down
our places in haphazard manner, not locat¬
ing them correctly on a given circle nor properly placing them between the adjacent
parallels in the manner in which a repre¬ sentation of the whole habitable earth
should he set out before the eyes in one com¬
plete map. It remains for us to show hew wc set down
all places, so that when we divide one map into several maps, we may be able accurate¬
ly to locate all of the well-known places
through the employment of easily under¬
stood and exact measurements.
As It is necessary therefore, in a single map of the entire habitable earth — since there must be kept a proper proportion in
the location of the sites of the different parts
of the earth which wc act down —-to con¬
tract some parts 011 account of the crowding of others, and rn expand yet other places on
account of the lack of knowledge of cer¬
tain others, that which many do without sufficient reason “lest they should appear to depart from traditional accounts — who
in their maps consequently are led to make many errors in the measurements and repre¬ sentations of regions, nr who give the
greatest part of their map to Europe in lati¬
tude and longitude because the sites and places to he inserted therein art more numer¬ ous. They leave very littte space for Asia in longitude, and for Africa little space in latitude, on account of an erroneous con¬
sideration of the relative size of the coun¬ tries, and therefore misplace the Indian sea
to the north of Taprobana, and in the same
map give intimation of au empty space to¬ ward the east, and have nothing m describe
toward the north, and extend the western
ocean to the eastern shore.
Then, too, thei r map is often drawn out of proportion in a southerly direction, in con¬ necting the vast extent of Africa with India making them a continuous whole; this, how¬
ever, they may have done to make room for the numerous places to he located on the western coast.
Some surround the cartli on all sides with
an ocean, imbued with such an opinion, making a fallacious description, and an un¬ finished and foolish picture.
We can avoid this common error by divid¬ ing our map io such manner tfiat the regions
which are the more crowiled with places
are shown alone, or in a map with other re¬
gions in which there is greater distance be¬
tween the circles; then the countries with
fewer inhabitants and eontai til rig fewer sites in one map will be included in spiicea of lesser size between the circles than when
represented on a single map.
I rf5 \



P TOLIMY'S GRUG R A P H Y
All mtip need not mmirc the same ilistanccs between the circled, blit in each map
the same proportion however most be kept
throughout, as for example, when we deycrilic [lie head alone wc speak in terms of
tlit head, or when wc speak of the hand
alone we speak in terms of the hand, and
wc do not figure equally for the head and ihc hand unless we are drawing a figure of
the whole man in cine image. And so it docs oot matter whether we sometimes increase
the size of the whole or sometimes lessen
it; likesvise it matters not in the special part
which wc can increase, or lessen, for in¬ stance, if there should be numerous locali¬ ties in certain parts in which there arc to
he many entries. Again it will not be far
from the truth if instead of circles wc draw straight lines as wc have shown at the be¬
ginning of this work.
Moreover in the separate maps wc shall show the meridians themselves not inclined and curved but at an equal distance one frOMl another, and since the termini of the
circles of latitude and of longitude of the habitable earth, when calculated over great
distances do not make any remarkable ex¬
cesses, so neither is there any great differ¬ ence m any of ntir maps, \V lien wc divide
our map according to the proportion of the
several parallels to the greatest circles, we say it ought to he done by comparing dislances and we do not seek out every distance
on the map but that which is from one ex¬ treme locality to another extreme.
chapter II
W hiti eJapfatiou un each imip

S
UCH things therefore being presup¬ posed, let us begin the task of a division such as the following:
Wc will make ten maps for Europe; wc will make fbar maps for Africa; for Asia
wc will make twelve maps to include the
whole, and wc will slate to which continent
each map belongs, and how many and how great are the regions or provinces in each,
and we will further explain what ratio the
parallel which passes through the middle
of the region has to the meridian, stating also what is the circumference of the entire
map, and giving throughout each region
the assumed elevation (latitude and longi¬
tude) of the chief cities, and the greatest
length of a day in each of them. Wc shall take the measure of distances in longitude without traveling to each men¬
tioned locality, but from the meridian of Alexandria, either nt sunrise Or sunset, and
from the number of equinoctial hour* be¬ tween the places. Beside5 this we shall find
in which of the constellations of the celestial
circle is the longitude of the places, and in which of the constellations the sun is once
or twice directly overhead, ant! the con¬ stellation^ jKssitifin with regard to the trop¬
ics themselves. Wc shall It am m addition what stars each may have overhead, if by
observation the latitude should appear at
the same equinoctial point, that is if the
latitude were always measured on the same
parallel. We have shown in a mathematical work
that the sphere of the fixed stars revolves aF the revolution of tbe earth and of the equi¬
noctial signs, not around the equinoctial
poles, but around the pole of the circle
through the middle ol the zodiac, erratical¬
ly, so to speak- Tile same stars are not at all times directly overhead in the some place, hut of necessity are more northward at one
time than at another, anti others are more southward,
But it might be considered useless to add such nn epilogue, since it is according to
law in the celestial sphere, following this
hypothesis in stated durations of time, that
we fix the site of a place on a circle which
extends from pole to pole, counting the whole distance on one meridian, and noting
that the same is a? many degrees from the equator as the parallel of the place to be determined Is distant.
Anri this it alsn will be easy to perceive at both poles although the location of nn
place is determined by the constellations of the fixed stars whether many or few.
'I’llesc things heing settled beforehand
we can now attend to that which remains.

CLAUDIUS PTOLEMY
THE GEOGRAPHY
Beat known today as the author of the AiiHGgfSJ, in which he expounded the geocentric astronomical system that buhl sway in Europe until the 19th century, Claudius Ptolemy (on9I> Iftfi a.n.) wn* ul$o fumed as A geographer. His reputation in this area rests mainly on his Guide to Crvgrapky, one of the great classics in the history of civilization, which listed over H.fKN] places in EurojV. Africa and Asia, tabulated according In latitude anti longitude,
Although the Guide tv Geography Contained many errors, II exerted great influence Oil later generation?, including such explorers as Christophtp Columbus, who used it to fortify his conviction that it was possible to reach Asia by traveling westward, As it turned out, Asia wras not nearly' as close as Ptolemy had claimed. Similarly, it was; not. until the 16th century that the voyages of Captain James Cook disproved the Ptolemaic idea that a southern, continent bounded the Indian Ocean, In spite of these and other shortcomjr&f, however, the Guide re 11 mi ns an important landmark in the first serious at tempts to construct an accurate geography of the world.
