THE HOMELAND RECLAIMED
I dedicate this book to my son, Gregory
Zoltán Botos, trusting that he will continue
my research. May ISTEN, the God of the Magyars, grant him wisdom.
"In the course of the struggle for existence, there comes a period
when it becomes very important for a nation to be aware of her own
origin, her past, her accomplishments and her mission. What others
know of her is also of vital importance because they may be in the
position to form the future of this nation. If a power intends to
intervene in the life of another nation, for the purpose of exploitation
and territorial gain, it first ruins its image and then is able to enslave



it."

FOREWORD
Carbon 14, still largely ignored by Middle Eastern archeologists,
has shown that Europe in the third millennium B.C. was no primitive
land of barbarians. The megaliths spread all over Western Europe are
now dated fifteen hundred years earlier than they were thirty years
ago. The megaliths, in the writer's opinion, were closely associated
with the spread of metallurgy.
Recorded history provides us with no record of a Mediterranean
people coming out of that area. The movement has always been into
it and into Mesopotamia likewise. Gordon Childe saw the
connections between Europe and Mesopotamia but in his great, and



now derided work, "The Danube", blinded by the chronology of his
time, he got the direction wrong and postulated the activities of
Sumerian prospectors in Central Europe. We have records of the
Amorites, Hittites, Hurrians, Luwians, Mitannians and even
Myceneans, together with the great Sea Peoples at about 1200 B.C.
into Palestine and Egypt, an event which ended the Bronze Age and
should be linked to the end of Troy and the Kassites' long rule in Iraq.
At this time the Hittites were pushed south into northern Syria by the
same group of invaders, who were armed with long swords and
socketed axes or palstaves. These invaders obviously came from an
area where advanced metallurgy flourished and copper and tin were
abundant.
In the light of the above evidence, it is quite possible that the
Sumerians came from the Carpathian Basin and the Balkans in a
similar manner. The linguistic parallels cited by Mr. Botos are
impressive. The Tartarian tablets have sadly been ignored by
archeologists in the West. The evidence for the horse and for
wheeled vehicles and for this movement was quoted by this writer in
1971 (in World Archeology). Since that time, the importance of the
Iberian Peninsula as a source of copper, tin and silver, together with
Sardinia with the same minerals, has occupied his studies.
Metallurgy was never practiced extensively in the Near East, and
bronze is notoriously late in reaching Egypt. The true tin bronzes in
the Royal Cemetery at Úr are anachronistic and the complex is dated
six hundred years too high, an idea that is anathema to
Mesopotamian archeologists. A similar situation exists in Egyptology
where the archeologists, in Sir Alan Gardinerʼs words have never
been able to escape from the spurious shackles of Manethoʼs King
Lists. Herodotus, whose description of Babylon which he visited was
remarkably accurate, and who visited Egypt before the time of
Manetho and the Ptolemies, is derided and ignored.



This brings us to the question, postulated by this writer in 1978, of
"Who was Sesostris I?" (Sesostris I was most probably not an
Egyptian.) Herodotus describes this ruler of Egypt of the new 12th
Dynasty (after a period of general upheaval throughout Egypt, the
Near East, Anatolia and Mesopotamia) as ruling an Empire extending
as far as Scythia and Colchis and across Anato
lia. Scythia extended beyond the Lower Danube and was certainly in
touch with the metal rich peoples of the Carpathian Basin. It is
exactly at this time, circa 2000 B.C., that the "Porteurs des Torques",
copper and tin-bronze in quantity, European type pins, axes, silver
and money rings appear in the Levant. Hurrians and horses appear in
North Syria.
In the Danube Basin, the Bodrogkeresztúr people are smelting
Carpathian native copper, and socketed cast axes of the Tiszapolgár
and late Lengyel peoples are being produced with a C.14 date of
2695 B.C. It is from these areas that the socketed cast axes and
silver of the Royal Tombs of Ur derived, dated to 2201, 2160 and
2088 B.C. by C.14 and, of course, the Royal Burials contain also four
wheeled "chariots" of an Anatolian or for that matter a Balkan type.
Mr. Botos' painstaking research indicates that the Hungarians
(Magyars) were not late arriving barbarians into the Carpathian Basin
but were possessed of a cultured civilization. This is contrary to the
accepted view that has been propagated in the West.
In conclusion, Mr. Botos has written a stimulating book that should
make historians and archeologists think again and reject the
hackneyed view that civilization spread from the Fertile Crescent to
Barbarian Europe. He has refocused our eyes on the important
cultures of the Carpathian Basin and the Balkans which had so much
influence on the city of Troy and Anatolia.

PREFACE
The purpose of this book is to incorporate the often conflicting
research of Hungarian and foreign linguists and historians into a
comprehensive study. I have read hundreds of studies which all
demonstrate outstanding research into many different aspects of
Hungarian History, covering many different time-periods. But how do
these mosaic pieces fit into a unified whole? Drawing from the
research of many historians in anthropology, archeology,
ethnography and other auxiliary sciences, I shall attempt to present
the overall picture of Hungarian history. This work will not be
complete because newer and newer facts are coming forth daily and
the already existing data are so many that a single researcher cannot
make a really comprehensive study. This book is only a pointer in
that direction. It is hoped that the new Hungarian historians will
research along these lines. Historical science demands the truth.
Otherwise history writing is just a political weapon.
In this book I shall attempt to correct some of the errors,
exaggerations and false data, which have been propagated in the
writing of Hungarian history. Every nation deserves a true history



from which, in case of need, it can draw strength and learn from the
mistakes of the past. The future of every nation depends on its
knowledge of the past and on whether that knowledge is the truth.
I shall attempt to prove that the Carpathian Basin was not
populated by Slavs at the time of the Magyar Conquest, that the
Magyars found there a people related to them, and that their
"conquest" was in truth a "homecoming". In fact, the people who
inhabited the Carpathian Basin were autochthonous to the territory
and had lived there for millennia. Some of them migrated from the
area when conditions forced them out, and they returned when the
time was right.
The Carpathian Basin is geographically ideal for settlement. It is a
large plain surrounded by mountains and well watered by mountain
streams and rivers. It is a territory with natural defenses, accessed
through only a few mountain passes. In my discussions of this
territory, when recording archeological excavations and settlements,
I continue to use the term Carpathian Basin rather than the names of
individual countries in this area, unless it is absolutely necessary,
because their boundaries are artificial. They were established in
1920, at the Treaty of Trianon, and are continually undergoing
change.
The history of Hungary was written by the West. History is usually
written by the victors. Hungary has been occupied by various
nations in the past, the Austrians, the Turks and, most recently, the
Soviets. The version of Hungarian history written by western
historians has been reproduced for centuries and is even taught in
Hungarian schools as "Hungarian history". At the time that these
historians were writing, they did not have the knowledge available to
us today through the auxiliary sciences of archeology, anthropology
and linguistics.



This is not a chronological history of the Magyars. It is rather an
attempt to see them in a new light, in their relationship to the
Scythians, Huns, Avars, and even the Sumerians. With the aid of
archeology, anthropology and linguistics, we shall see the Magyars
with a different perspective. It is time to change the old concept of
the "barbarian" Magyars. It is time for Hungarians to look back with
pride.
Chapter 1.
Magyars - Barbarians?
"The Magyar language stands afar off and alone. The study of
other tongues will be found of exceedingly little use towards its right
understanding. It is moulded in a form essentially its own, and its
construction and composition may be safely referred to an epoch
when most of the living tongues of Europe either had no existence,



or no influence on the Hungarian region.
"Originating in an age too remote to be defined or even
discovered, and receiving from time to time infusions-from the
various tribes and tongues who have visited or been visited by the
Magyar race, it has yet retained all its essential peculiarities, and
offers to the inquirer some of the most curious topics of research.
"The roots of the Magyar are for the most part exceedingly simple
and monosyllabic, but their ramifications are numerous, consistent,
and beautiful. I know of no language which presents such a variety of
elementary stamina, and none which lends itself so easily and
gracefully to all the modifications growing out of its simple
principles."[1]
This was written by Sir John Bowring (1792-1872), an English
philologist who spoke many languages, one of them Hungarian. He
translated many Hungarian poems into English and issued a literary
chrestomathy. R. Nisbet Bain, a linguist from the British Museum,
noted that the Hungarian language is "a miracle of word formation".
Ebersberg, an Austrian linguist, says that the Hungarian language is
so perfect that it is as if it were created by a congress of linguists to
serve conciseness, smoothness, harmony and clarity of expression.
Cardinal Giuseppe Mezzofanti, an Italian writer and linguist, (1774
1849), who spoke fifty-eight languages fluently and was familiar with
one hundred, stated: "After Latin and Greek, Hungarian is the most
musical language and the language most suited to poetry." Jakob
L.K.Grimm, a German linguist, (1785-1863), recommended that
Hungarian be adopted as an international language.[2]
Why can we no longer hear about the beauty and antiquity of the
Magyar (Hungarian) language? The modern history books and
encyclopedia describe the Magyars as "wild, barbarian horsemen"



whose language belongs to the Finno-Ugric language group. "This
group also includes the Finns, and the Voguls and Ostyaks of
Siberia." (World Book Encyclopedia) The Encyclopedia Americana
states: "The history of the Hungarian State began suddenly in 895 or
896 A.D. "It also tells us that the Magyars were of Finno-Ugric stock.
In the Encyclopedia Britannica, we read: "The proto-Hungarians were
apparently an ethnic blend of Ugric and Turkish peoples living in
Western Siberia." "By the late 9th century, the Hungarians had
entered their present location, subjugating the resident Slavs and
Huns." Linguists who promote the Finno-Ugric theory of the origin of
the Magyars state that the Magyars were so primitive that they had
no words to express even the most simple elements and they picked
up their vocabulary from the peoples they met on their travels
throughout Europe. This is how they explain the large number of
foreign words and expressions in the Magyar language. Hungarian
students are taught that their ancestors were primitive tribes related
to the Voguls and Ostyaks and that they originated in the snowy
wind-swept steppes of Siberia. If the Magyar people were as
primitive as the Finno-Ugric theorists state, their language would not
be as well developed as the aforementioned European linguists
found it to be.
Karin Mark, an Estonian anthropologist has stated that the Magyar
origins cannot be found among the Voguls and Ostyaks because
there are unbridgeable differences between them and the Magyars.
The most famous Finno-Ugric linguist who has been called "the
apostle of Finno-Ugric linguistics", Björn Collinder, writes: "The
Finno-Ugric phonetic system lacks the Magyar phonemes - á, é, cs,
gy, í, ly, ny, ó, ö, sz, ty, ú, ü, zs, - fourteen phonemes, and the Finno
Ugric languages also lack the verbal prefix.” [3] Miklós Gábori writes
that, at the time of the Sumerians, the territory of the Urals and
Siberia was unpopulated. According to the Finno-Ugric hypothesis,



the ancestors of the Hungarians lived on these aforementioned
territories with their relatives, the Voguls and Ostyaks in 6000 B.C.
Gyula Lász1ó states that such territory which the linguistic science
declares to be the "Ural-Finno-Ugric territory" never existed.[4] He
also mentions that there is no Finno-Ugric archeology, folk art, or
anthropology that prove connections with the Magyars.[5] Doctor
Badiny asks on what the Finno-Ugric relationship is based if the
Finno-Ugric languages lack fourteen Magyar phonemes and there is
no Finno-Ugric archeology, anthropology and folk-art to prove a
relationship with the Magyars.[6]
Hungarian history, as the West knows it, was written by the
enemies of the Hungarians, by those who conquered them and who
wished to keep them under their dominance. In 1526, the Holy
Roman Emperor Ferdinand, of the Hapsburg house of Austria,
became King of Hungary. The Hapsburgs ruled Hungary from that
time until 1867 when the dual-monarchy was established. The
Austro-Hungarian Empire lasted from 1867 to 1918.
The Hapsburgs forbade the publication of Magyar (Hungarian)
writings dealing with the subject of self-pride, patriotism, pride in the
historical greatness of Magyarország (Hungary) or dealing with
internal or foreign policy. At the same time, they supported and
propagated publications which spread the concept of national self
depreciation, emphasizing that the present-day Hungarians
originated from a primitive people, from "the lowest branch of
mankind's family tree" and portraying the Magyars as "pagan,
barbarian hordes" whose diet consisted of raw meat. This
description of the Magyars is widely accepted even today. Edouard
Harriot, a former French minister, called them cannibals who did not
belong in the European community. [7]
This derogation was encouraged in order to break the national



spirit of the Hungarians and bring them under the yoke of the
Hapsburgs who knew that a nation which loses its national pride,
which turns away from its ancestors and despises them, has no
future but one of servitude and slavery. In pursuing their relentless
disparagement, the Hapsburgs represented the Magyars, who
reclaimed the Carpathian Basin in A.D. 896, under the leadership of
Árpád, as merciless barbarians. Emperor Joseph II, (1780-1790), who
was also King of Hungary would not allow the ancient Hungarian
history to be taught in Hungary.
In 1848, the Hungarians began a freedom fight against the
Austrian occupation, and defeated the Austrian army in 1849. At that
time, the Austrian Empire was in alliance with the Russian Empire,
and the Austrians naturally asked for the Russians' help. The
Russians proved to be good allies and sent powerful armed forces
against Hungary. These superior forces defeated the Hungarian
regiments and thus enabled the Hapsburgs to restore their rule over
Hungary. Under such circumstances it was not possible for the
Hungarian scholars to work freely and objectively in the research of
the Magyar origins. The Austrians appointed professors to the
Hungarian Academy of Science who did not even speak Hungarian.
Joseph Budenz, a German from Rasdorf, Germany, did not speak
Hungarian, yet he was appointed Professor of Hungarian Linguistic
Science. He introduced the hypothesis of the Finno-Ugric origins of
the Magyars, which was supposedly originated by Aeneas Silvius
Picolinimi, Pope Pius II (1448-1464). According to this theory, the
Magyars were descended from the primitive Ostyak and Vogul tribes
of Siberia and also related to the Finns. From this time on, the
Magyars were called a Finno-Ugric people. In his efforts to advocate
the Finno-Ugric theory, Budenz was aided by the Germans,
Hundorfer, Schedel, Munk and Ferber. Hundorfer changed his name
to the Hungarian Hunfalvy, Schedel to Toldi, Munk to Munkácsi, and



Ferber to Szinnyei.
In the sixteenth century, Adam Kolart was the first writer serving
the Hapsburg interest to produce anti-Hungarian texts. He flooded
the universities with anti-Hungarian writings. At the Hungarian
nation's strong objections, the Hapsburgs removed Adam Kolart
from his position but, in private, he continued to spread anti
Hungarian propaganda. He stated that, at the time of Árpád,
Magyarország (Hungary) did not exist as a country because there
were no Magyars living there, only Slavs.[8] This information is
propagated even today. (see the aforementioned encyclopedia).
It has been documented that, at least from the time of the Roman
occupation, this territory has been inhabited by a people speaking
the Magyar language. The Roman historian, Ammianus Marcellinus
recorded that the Roman legions, the most modern and largest army
at that time, fought for 44 years to conquer Pannonia, from 35 B.C.
to A. D. 9. Pannonia was the name the Romans used for the area
which we call Hungary. He told a story about the Pannonians (early
Hungarians) which is quoted by Edward Gibbon in his Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire. (Chapter 19, section 48)[9] In A.D. 359,
during the reign of Emperor Constantine II, the people of Pannonia
revolted because they could no longer bear the weight of the
increasing taxes. The Emperor tried to mitigate the people's
dissatisfaction and called a meeting at. Szerém (in Latin Sirmium),
where he wanted to persuade the people to pay their taxes. When he
declared that the taxes had to be paid, one of the desperate listeners
took off his boot and threw it at the Emperor, shouting: "Marha!
Marha!" At that point, the revolt erupted. The Pannonians tore off his
golden robe and broke his golden throne. He escaped on horseback
wearing a soldier's uniform and helmet. It is notable that this
interjection "marha!" is presently in use by the Hungarians when they
are angry or indignant. Its meaning is "cattle" but used in this way it



means "beast" or "brute". Luitprand, writing in A.D. 910, stated that
the northern neighbors of the Byzantine Empire were the Magyars.
The border between Byzantium and the Magyars was the Lower
Danube.[10]
The Hungarian legend of the Enchanted Stag (which in the
original legend was a doe) is the story of the sons of Nimrud, Hunor
and Magor, who followed the white stag to the land of King Dul of the
Alans where they found and married two of the king's daughters and
established the people of the Huns and the Magyars. They migrated
to the Carpathian Basin where they found a people speaking a
language similar to their own. This would cause us to question the
theory that the Carpathian Basin was populated by Slavs when the
Magyars arrived there with their leader, Árpád. It also allows us to
answer a question that has puzzled the Finno-Ugric linguists for so
long -why the people Of Árpád, who were small in number, were able
to impose their language on a "larger Slav populace" in the
Carpathian Basin. The simple explanation is that they did not need to
force anyone to speak their language because the language of the
ancient populace was the Magyar language. We still do not know for
sure whether all the people who came with Árpád spoke the Magyar
language. According to some sources, some of them spoke a Turkic
language although the Megyer "nation",[11] the leading group, spoke
Magyar. If that were so, then they gave up their Turkish language and
adopted the language of the ancient populace, which we now call
Magyar.
According to the Finno-Ugric linguists, the Hungarian word
"csizma" (boot) is a Slav word. They cannot imagine that the
"nomadic" Magyars of the ninth century could possess the skill to
make boots. The above-mentioned story indicates that the Magyar
speaking people, who lived in the Carpathian Basin before the
Roman occupation, wore boots and not sandals, as did the Slavs.



Pannonia, in the first three centuries after Christ, until the Huns
arrived in the Carpathian basin, in A.D. 375, was the name given by
the Romans to Transdanubia, (the part of Hungary which lies
between the Danube, the Dráva and the western border of the
country) and the territory between the Dráva and Száva rivers. After
the fall of the Roman Empire, the Huns occupied the territory, which
the Romans called Pannonia but they no longer called it Pannonia.
The Avars occupied it after the Huns and this territory received the
name of Avaria. From the beginning of the eighth century to the end
of the ninth century, the western sources mention the name
Pannonia but when they use this name, they do not apply it to the
territory of Transdanubia, as the Romans did, but to two different
territories. The territory that is now called Austria was called Upper
Pannonia, and the territory between the Dráva and Száva rivers,
close to the Adriatic Sea was called Lower Pannonia. The chronicles
of the monastery of Altha, in the ninth century, state: "The land of
the Avars or Huns, after eight years of continuous war, was occupied
by Charlemagne who chased out the Avars, and Avaria, that is upper
Pannonia, which now receives the name of Austria, up to the country
of Bavaria, was divided among the churches."[12]
The Finno-Ugric historians also state that the Magyars lived in
Etelköz, between the Szeret and Prut rivers, before returning to the
Carpathian Basin and that, while the Magyar men were away on
campaigns, the Pechenegs attacked their wives, children and old
people who were left at home, totally annihilating them. (Constantine
Porphyrogenitus records that the Pechenegs attacked the Magyars,
but he does not say that it was a fatal attack.) They explain that the
returning Magyar men were forced to flee from the Pechenegs
toward the Carpathian Basin and, after they had conquered the Slavs
who were living there, they married Slav women. The modern
Hungarians are supposedly originated from these Slav mothers.



Raising children was the duty of the mother, because for many
months the father was away from the family while he was
campaigning. According to Slav historians, the Magyars conquered
Slav territory and married Slav women, but why and how would these
Slav mothers have taught their children the Magyar language, when
the Magyars were considered to be enemies? Logically, the Magyar
children would have learned the Slav language and the Hungarians
of today would not speak the Magyar language.
According to Slav historians, the territory of Szvatopluk, the ruler
of the Slav tribes, was in the Carpathian Basin. The Képes Krónika
(1358), and the Óbudai Chronicles, also written in the fourteenth
century, both state that Árpád bought the Carpathian Basin from
Szvatopluk for a white horse, a saddle ornamented with gold and a
golden bit. This information must have been written into the
Chronicles by someone who was not Hungarian but who was
working against the Hungarians. Who was Szvatopluk? The original
sources write his name as Zwentibold. This name was originally of
German origin but was slavicized to Szvatopluk or Sventopolk. The
western Chronicles write: "Zwentibold and Rastez had a camp north
of the territory of the Margrave of Moravia and they attacked the
German territories in Pannonia."[13] This Pannonia, (Upper
Pannonia, presently Austria), and not the Pannonia in Transdanubia,
was the territory which Charlemagne destroyed completely. As the
Avars were killed, Charlemagne settled in their place Slavs and
Germans. After the dissolution of the Avar Empire, Zwentibold
managed to create a temporary Slav rule in that area. In A.D. 860,
Zwentibold and his uncle Rastez made an alliance with the slaves of
the salt-mines and they started to harass the German states in
Upper Pannonia. King Ludwig II sent his son Ludwig to settle one of
these conflicts and he, himself attacked Zwentibold. When he was
captured, Zwentibold negotiated with Ludwig and betrayed his



uncle, Rastez. Ludwig II then called an assembly of the Franks,
Bavarians, Saxons and Slavs who unanimously decreed that
Zwentibold should be blinded and lose all his power. This happened
in A.D. 870 and after that Zwentibold disappeared from the history
books. He died in A.D. 894.[14] How then was it possible for Árpád
to buy the Carpathian Basin from Szvatopluk (Zwentibold) in A.D.
896? The Slavs also claim Pannonia as the land of Szvatopluk
(Zwentibold), but the Pannonia that they claim is the territory of
Transdanubia, in the Carpathian Basin, not Upper Pannonia in
Austria, which was originally the land of Zwentibold. Why do they
claim that Zwentibold's territory was in Transdanubia? They want to
establish that they were present in the Carpathian Basin when the
Magyars arrived there. Today they are excavating large numbers of
Avar graves and claiming the artifacts as a "Slav" inheritance. The
Hungarians could easily disprove that these artifacts are of Slavic
origin. They would only need to present the many thousands of Avar
artifacts that have been excavated in Hungarian territory which are
identical to the so-called "Slav" inheritance.
The hypothesis of the Finno-Ugric origins of the Magyars has
been accepted for over a hundred years and no other theory has
been allowed to be proposed in Hungary. However, in 1978, Gyula
Lász1ó published the results of his archeological research and cast
doubts on the validity of the Finno-Ugric hypothesis.[15]
Gyula Lász1ó states that if one area of craftsmanship reaches a high
level, we can safely assume that all areas of craftsmanship have
attained relatively the same level. The craftsmen of the Árpád era,
the blacksmiths, silver and goldsmiths, saddlers, fletchers,
carpenters, wheelwrights, potters, furriers, and metallurgists were all
highly advanced, so the rest of the craftsmen must also have been
on a similar level. With the aid of Gyula Lász1ó, we can examine the
Hungarian words relating to the household: ház (house), ajtó (door),



ajtófélfa (doorpost), küszöb (threshold), fal (wall), fedel (roof), which
are all Magyar words from before the time of Árpád. Dr. Lász1ó
concludes that, in the Carpathian Basin, the Magyars were living in
houses and not in mud huts as has been widely taught. This has
been proven by the archeological findings at Felgyő, where large
houses were uncovered, built of rammed-earth walls, wood and
bricks. These houses were in every respect much closer to a modern
structure than to a mud hut.[16]
István Bona, at Dunapentele, unearthed large numbers of mud
huts. "On the maps which indicate where the mud huts are, it is
more likely that we are looking at Slav settlements, than at Avar or
Magyar settlements."[17] Those territories, where mud huts were
found in larger numbers, were definitely not the territories of the
settlement places of the later Avars or Árpád's Magyars, but Slav
settlements.[18]
The Slav tribes were located in the territories surrounding the Avar
and Magyar territory. In large numbers, the Avars settled the Slavs in
these territories as a people of serfs. In spite of the fact that most
historical works state that the Slavs were in the majority in the
Carpathian Basin, and that Árpád's people destroyed their empire,
we shall see that, in the time of Árpád, there was not an organized
Slav state in the Carpathian Basin, just scattered Slav settlements.
All the words that had connection with the house existed in the
vocabulary of the Árpád Magyars before they entered the Carpathian
Basin. It is obvious that the Slavs did not teach the Magyars how to
build houses but, on the contrary, they learned from the Avars or the
Magyars.
The Magyar laws and documents bear witness to the fact that the
houses were constructed above ground. In these documents we find
phrases such as: "they burned them (the houses) down"; "they took



them apart and carried them away"; "they rebuilt them". All these
phrases refer to houses rather than mud huts.[19] The Magyar
Chronicles write about the laws of King István from the eleventh
century, which are addressed to a settled populace (villa).[20]
Before the time of Prince Géza (970-997) there is no mention of
settlements. However, thirty to forty years later, in the time of King
István, the documents mention settled villages. This would seem to
indicate that the Magyars who entered the Carpathian Basin in A.D.
896 were not a nomadic people as is commonly believed. They had
simply migrated from Etelköz to the Carpathian Basin.
In the present, there are large numbers of Slavs living in the
Carpathian Basin so the reader might ask how it was possible that
Árpád's people found a Magyar speaking people when they arrived
and the Magyar Chronicles do not mention the Slavs. About four
thousand years ago, the Proto-Slavs settled in the Sarmatian desert
where they became connected with the Scythians. According to
Herodotus, the Slavs lived in the territory of the Valda hills and along
the river Volga. The equestrian peoples all brought servants with
them from the Sarmatian desert into the Carpathian Basin. Later on,
these servants received the name "sclavus" in Latin, meaning "slave,
servant" which is the origin of the name of the Slavs. The Serbs and
Croats were settled on the northern borderline of the Byzantine
Empire by Emperor Heraclius to defend his borders against the
Avars. After the fall of the Avars, the Slavic Serbs and Croats slowly
infiltrated into Transdanubia. At the time that Árpád's Magyars
settled in the counties of Szerém and Veröce, they found no Serbs or
Croats in those counties, because at that time, the Serb and Croat
people lived as shepherds in the valleys of the Morava, Ibar, Lim and
Zéta rivers. Only in the twelfth century A.D. did they begin to spread
to the northwest. Until 1459, Serbia was a subsidiary state of
Hungary and the Serbs were able to migrate freely into the territory



that they had earlier devastated as allies of the Turks. The Hungarian
kings supported the settlement of foreigners in Hungary because
they needed workers. The aristocrats were very willing to employ
them for lower wages. At the beginning, they were very modest and
satisfied with very little. Because the kings favored them, in 1495,
the government gave them an exemption from taxes. In 1597, in Bács
and Bodrog, which were formerly 100% Hungarian counties, there
were 35 Serbian villages. In the counties of Temes and Torontál, the
populace became almost entirely Serbian. The Serbs pledged their
allegiance to Emperor Leopold, King of Hungary. At the Belgrade
Assembly, June 18, 1690, 36,000 families about 180-200,000
people, had to leave Serbia. They were allowed to resettle on the left
bank of the river Száva in Hungary. They came to this territory with
the understanding that after the liberation of Serbia, they would
return to their land. In 1691, the land of the Serbs was free again but
they found their life more prosperous in Hungary so they remained.
The Serbs did not want to accept taxation in Hungary, so many
disputes emerged. Because they gave so much opposition to the
government, the army advised the government to give a separate
territory to the Serbs in 1694. They received the eastern part of
Slavonia and the county of Bács. In this way the Serbs took a large
part of the Hungarian territory.
The distorted historical writings of Adam Kolart, Berzeviczy and
others became the sources from which modern historians took their
information. These lies and derogatory statements were used as a
basis for the Peace treaty at the end of World War I, the Treaty of
Trianon, 1920, which accorded not only considerable areas of
Hungarian territory but also large numbers of Hungarian population
to the neighboring states, where they have lived, since 1920, as an
oppressed minority. The people of Hungary, although they begged
that their right to self-determination be respected, were ignored and



were not even given a plebiscite, except for the citizens of Sopron,
who voted to remain within the Hungarian borders. Nobody
sympathized with the descendants of "uncivilized, uncultured
barbarians".
The Serbs had no right to the territories on the left banks of the
rivers Száva and Danube, either historically or by dint of numbers of
populace, yet they received the Voivodina with 564,000 Hungarians,
at the Treaty of Trianon. In 1941, the Hungarian and the Serbian
governments agreed that the Serbs would return Zombor, Ujvidék,
Kikinda, Versec, the Baranyai triangle and the territory of Muraköz to
Hungary, but, a few days after this announcement, with the financial
support of the Americans and the English, a coup overthrew the
Yugoslav government and nullified the agreement. This Slavic
influence, by dint of the numbers, became a threat not only to
Hungary but also to the whole of Europe.[21]
If the history written by the enemies of the Hungarians is
inaccurate, where then can we find the true Hungarian history?
Modern Hungarian historians, archeologists and writers such as
János Hetényi, Mihály Horváth, Lász1ó Szalay, Gyula Illyes, Ferenc
Eckhart, György Györffy, Gyula Lász1ó, Bálint Hóman, and József
Eotvös, have all done extensive research and document the true
historical facts. Ferenc Kunszabó in his work És Ég az Oltár,
(Budapest, 1992) presents information taken from these historians.
The Magyars of Árpád who lived in the Kazar Empire were
merchants well-known to Byzantium. They taught the whole of
Europe the process of working fur and the waterproofing of leather.
It is also a known fact that the Magyars of Árpád entered many well
known cities in the Carpathian Basin which were mercantile centers
of the Avars or of the ancient populace: Munkács, Pozsony,
Esztergom, Nyitra, Pest, Buda, Ungvár, Tolna, Pécs, Vasvár, Eger,



Bihár, Gyulafehérvár, Győr, Veszprém, etc. If the homecoming
Magyars were barbarians, they would have destroyed these cities.
They did not destroy them but built even more cities such as
Komárom, Himesudvár, Borsód, Szabolcs, Feketevár, Tasvár. Árpád
built a castle for himself on the island of Csepel in the Danube. The
priests and bishops of Pannonia, at the time of the arrival of Árpád,
all fled in panic from Pannonia but shortly after, they wrote in letters
to Rome that, instead of harm and harassment from the Magyars,
they were offered a welcome to return.
Imre Stammler, school principal and amateur archeologist, has
researched the evidence of an iron industry and the production of
tools and weapons in the tenth century. The results of his research
were published by the Pedagogical Institute at Kaposvár, in the
Somogy County Archives (1989). His paper was acknowledged by
Gyula Lászó and János Gömöri, both well-known archeologists. Imre
Stammler tells us that he started to research the names of the
settlements originating from the names of leaders of the pre
Christian Magyars. He felt that in these places he would find
evidence of the level of civilization of the tenth century Magyars. He
reported his first findings to the leaders of the Archeological Institute
of the Hungarian Academy of Science but, instead of support and
encouragement, he experienced rejection because he was not an
acknowledged archeologist. In spite of this, he continued his
research and excavated many more remains than he had anticipated.
Modern dating technology can accurately determine the age of
these findings and, if it were applied, we could learn much more
about the Magyars of the tenth century.
Until now it has been generally accepted that the Magyar people
began their class system at the time of King István I (A.D. 1000
1038) and that before that time, all Magyars were free nomads.
However, according to the most recent information, they had already



developed a class system before they entered the Carpathian Basin.
They had a well-developed social structure and their military
hierarchy was based on units of ten. The majority of the Avar people
survived the conquest of Charlemagne and many of their industrial
sites remained. The Magyars were able to learn the techniques
practiced at these sites.
In the ninth and tenth centuries, the use of metal weapons and
tools was widespread. Iron was needed to make swords,
arrowheads, bits, stirrups, carriages and agricultural implements. In
Asia and in Central Europe, there were many peoples, all part of the
same ethnic group. This large ethnic group has been known under
many different names. The "nation" which was in ascendance at any
given time gave its name to the Empire. It was important for a leader
to have knowledge of metallurgy because knowledge was power. In
the tenth century, the Magyars were in power and they have left
evidence of their metalworking industry.
In the county of Somogy, which was originally an autonomous
state at the time of Árpád but was annexed by the leader of the
Magyars, we find many smelting-works around the settlements that
were called by the names of Magyar leaders. In the same county,
archeologists have also excavated settlements with names that
reflect the working of iron – Vasas (ironworker), Ötvös (gold or
silversmith), Kovácsi (smith), Vértes (armour), Csatár (soldier),
Tömörd, Tömörke, Tarkány (smith -- ancient term), Vaskert
(ironyard), Vaskalap (iron hat). We can be sure that they date to the
time before King István because the kings of the Árpád Dynasty
unified the nation and raised it to statehood. In Zamárd, János
Gömöri, an archeologist from the Hungarian Academy of Science,
excavated the foundation of a smelting-work with blast-pipes and
cinders, which he determined to be from the Age of the Avars.



In 1989, at the place named after Faisz, one of the leaders of the
Magyars, Imre Stammler found an area where there were many iron
smelting-works. It was excavated by János Gömöri, who found an
almost perfect blast furnace and eighteen almost perfect blast
pipes, many iron balls weighing approximately 6 pounds and many
cinders, ceramics and wood charcoal. The excavations should
continue here because it is certain that the workers' residences
would be found. At that time, workers who obtained that rare
knowledge were given special privileges. They lived close to the
workplace under the protection of the leader. I will name a few of the
settlement names which reflect the names of "nations" or their
leaders, locations in which blast furnaces were found: Árpád, Tetény,
KáI, Horka, Bogát, Faisz, Bulcsu, Megyer, Nyék, Keszi, Örs, Kürt,
Jenő, Tarján, Tarhány, Usubu, Jutás. With this superior knowledge of
working iron and producing weapons, the Magyars could not have
been barbarians, and this explains their superiority over the West in
weaponry for the period of several hundred years.
Already in the reign of King István I, (1000-1038) (Saint Stephen),
there was taxation throughout the whole country and we know that
taxation is the basis of every well-founded society. Only in this way
was it possible to build and maintain roads and bridges and ensure
public safety. At this time new cities came to the level of international
fame - Székesfehérvár, Zalavár, Vác, Sopron, Buda, Kalócsa, Zimony,
Nagyvárad, Kolozsvár, Brassó and, in Northern Hungary, mining and
mercantile cities such as Selmec, Kormóc, Eperjes, Löcse, Szepes,
Kassa, Zolyom, Késmark, Újbánya, Bélabánya. The coins at the time
of King István I contained 93% silver and became one of the most
favored currencies of Europe.
At the end of the eleventh century, the merchants of Hungary
became so rich that King Kálmán (Könyves Kálmán) (1095-1116)
raised their taxes 100%. He also bestowed full citizenship on the



Jewish people living in the country. The National Assembly in 1114
was obliged to regulate the number of youths who wanted to enter
industrial apprenticeships because they were depleting the
agricultural workforce.
In the reign of King Béla III (1172-1196), there were more than one
hundred mining cities in Hungary. At that time, most of the national
income came from the mines, from industry and from trade. The
extent of the nation's wealth is shown by the work of the gold and
silversmiths and by the fact that Princess Elizabeth (Saint Elizabeth)
took with her as a wedding gift to Thuringia a complete silver cradle,
a silver bathtub, chains and other gold and silver treasures, the like
of which had never before been seen in Thuringia. According to
Bálint Homán, in the Middle Ages, half of the silver products and
two-thirds of the gold products of the known world at that time were
produced by Hungary. Abu Hamid al Garnati, an Arab traveler who
spent three years in Hungary, between 1150 and 1153, wrote in his
journal that the Magyars had seventy-eight cities and villages
surrounded by walls and gardens.[22] The National Assembly of
1405 gave the citizens of the chartered cities the same rights as the
aristocracy and the church hierarchy. This law remained in force until
the Hapsburgs appeared in Hungary. King Matthias Hunyadi (1458
1490) forbade the export of armaments and regulated the
movements of the foreign merchants in the country. His writings
state that, in the county of Somogy, the populace neglected the
agricultural work because of their interest in trading. According to
Ferenc Eckhart, there were circa eight hundred chartered cities and
centers in the country whose population numbered about one
thousand in each, making about eight hundred thousand merchants
and industrial workers, approximately twenty percent of the entire
population of Hungary. In 1627, in the Selmec Mine, for the first time
in the world, an explosion was used to loosen the coal for harvesting.



A record of this event can be found in the mining log, which is
presently kept in the Museum at Sopron.
Only two decades after the Magyars had reclaimed their homeland
in A.D.896, the "barbaric, pagan, boorish Magyars" were able to
make high connections, receive honored titles such as Patrician and
make royal marriages. The Byzantine emperors were extremely
particular about whom they honored as a guest or a friend, into
which royal house they married and which royal princess they
accepted in marriage. Whoever was so honored by the Emperor
must have been of a similar rank to him. Viktor Padányi tells us that
the Roman title of Patrician came into use in the sixth century and
that the Popes of Rome, Byzantium and Ravenna bestowed this
honor on foreign personages of royal rank such as Alaric, Theodoric,
Clodwig and Charlemagne. "The Magyar leader, Bulcsu Horka,[23]
the greatest European military leader of the tenth century was also
awarded the title of Patrician and he was baptized a Christian in A.D.
948 at Viddin." The Emperor was his godfather.[24]
Many marriages took place between the Magyar and foreign royal
houses. Bulcsu Horka's aunt was married to Arnulf, Prince of Bavaria.
King Kálmán of Hungary (1095-1116) was widowed. The Byzantines
offered him the Lady Nikeforosz as his wife. The father of Nikeforosz,
Botongejatesz, became Emperor of Byzantium. Piroska, the only
daughter of King Lász1ó (who became Saint Lász1ó) also married a
Byzantine Prince who later became Emperor. Margit, the daughter of
King Béla III, and Anna, daughter of King István V, also married
Byzantine Emperors. Perhaps the Magyars were not so barbaric after
all. If they really were so in 896, and they climbed to such high
positions in Europe in such a short time, then they were a very
talented people, blessed with great intellect.
When the Magyars entered the Carpathian Basin to reclaim their



ancient homeland, they were a civilized equestrian people unlike the
westerners who were primarily urban dwellers. Each society, the
urban and the equestrian, had its own characteristics. The urban
dwellers accepted the structure of city living, decorating their
houses and their surroundings and constructing large edifices that
were meant to last. They placed great value on tolerance and
peaceful coexistence. These factors contributed to the development
of this society.
The highly mobile equestrian civilization, on the other hand,
valued its freedom, and speed was the basis of its lifestyle. More
than anything else the people cherished their independence. Instead
of the stability so important to the city-dweller, the horseman's life
depended on his mobility.
Both societies had to overcome problems of distance. The one
used water as a means of transportation, the other used the horse
and carriage. They differed greatly from each other in the
development of their society, especially in the beginning, but both
societies contributed equally to modern civilization. Instead of
permanent constructions, the equestrians needed to create
products which were light, easy to assemble and disassemble, and
easy to carry. They developed a much higher standard in clothing
because life on horseback demanded tight garments and boots. In
the course of history, when the Hapsburg Emperors wished to dress
up, they wore the costume of the "boorish, barbaric Magyars", which
later developed into the military uniform of the Magyar Huszars. In
the eighteenth century, this uniform was adopted by the West,
together with its name. It became known in German as "hussar", in
English as "hussar" and in French as "houssar". The American
military dress uniform was adapted from the uniform of the hussars,
which was introduced into America by Colonel Kovats de Fabriczy,
who served under General George Washington.



The equestrians developed better weaponry, shields and arrows;
more beautiful jewelry and a greater variety of folk arts than did the
city-dwellers. They used leather, wood, bone and precious metals.
They produced carpets, textiles and metalwork. The abundance of
their folk-songs, dances and instruments by far surpassed that of
the western urban societies. They also used a runic script which they
carved on rods. "These folk arts were adopted by the Goths who
settled in the Meotis Moor from A.D. 180-370. The Goths carried
these folk arts with them to the West as Gothic arts." [25] This
equestrian culture was just as valuable in influencing the
development of modern civilization, as was the urban culture. It was
responsible for introducing a higher level of hygiene to Europe. The
Turanian or Ural-Altaic peoples used baths - the Turkish bath, the
Finnish sauna and the Chinese bath. None of these is of Indo
European origin. The art of the goldsmiths and silversmiths was
absent from the early river civilizations of the West. It was taken to
China by the Huns and adopted by the Persians and Byzantines who
had close connections with the equestrian civilizations. The Persians
and Byzantines developed this gold and silverwork to a higher
degree of sophistication and later brought it to the West and back to
the Magyars with more refined techniques.
The "barbaric” Magyars made many valuable contributions to the
progress of mankind one of which was the use of the carriage which
made it possible for people to settle in the fertile inland territories.
The use of the carriage was transmitted to the West by the Magyars.
It was adopted together with its Magyar name "kocsi" (kotshi) e.g.
German "kutsche" (kootshe), French "coche" (kosh), English "coach"
and Italian "coccio" (kotshio).[26]
The famous English archeologist, Sir Leonard Woolley, states: "the
most convenient and easily recognizable criterion of civilization is
the knowledge of the art of writing." [27] At a time when none of the



European peoples, not even the Greeks or Romans, had a writing
system that they could call their own, the early Magyars had their
own alphabet and numerical system. The Greeks took their letters
from the Phoenicians, and the Romans developed their alphabet
from the Greeks and the Etruscans. Adorján Magyar, a Hungarian
linguist and ethnographer, points out the similarity between the
Magyar and Etruscan writing but discounts the theory that the
Magyars copied the Latin alphabet that the Romans took from the
Etruscans. He states that the Magyar runic numerals show a greater
similarity to the Etruscan than to the Roman numerals. How is this
possible if the Magyars appeared in Western history only a thousand
years ago, as is commonly believed? According to Adorján Magyar,
the only explanation is that the Etruscans and the Magyars had the
same primeval origin, or that the Magyars were living in Europe at the
time of the Etruscans. "Either the Hungarians received their
numerical figures from the Etruscans or the Etruscans from the
Hungarians."[28]
Sándor Forrai, a Hungarian linguist who specializes in the study of
runic scripts, states that the modern system of Hungarian shorthand
writing developed from the methods used by the Magyars at the
time of Árpád in the ninth century. This conclusion is based on an
analysis of a stick calendar carved in the Szekler runic script and
other sources of the runic script.[29]
Professor Badiny, of the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina,
talks about the destruction of the runic script in Hungary:
"During the reign of István I, it became a duty of the Church to
destroy any relics of the 'pagan' past, just as the Conquistadores
destroyed the culture of the Incas in South America and the Mayan
and Aztec cultural wonders in Central America under the pretext of
spreading Christianity." [30]



There were several reasons for this purposeful destruction. One
was to remove all traces of the ancient "pagan" past. In the yearbook
of the Jósa András Museum at Nyiregyháza (1969 and 1971
editions), we can read that András Vitéz, the Canon of Rozsnyó and
Judge of the County of Gomor and Kishont, in 1816 found a
document in the archives of the Szilássy family, entitled: "Vatican,
1000, C.A.L. Oct. Diefesto L.A.C. AP" which he translated into
Hungarian. The text described how King István I. had all his advisors
sign a law which Domonkos, the Archbishop of Esztergom had the
responsibility of enforcing through the Christian Church. This law
was proposed by Pope Sylvester and adopted by King István and his
Council of ministers. The law ordered the destruction of anything
written in the Magyar, Szekler or Cumanian (Kun) runic script, which
was written from right to left and used by the Hungarian Christian
priests. The Latin letters were to be used in place of the runic script.
It was further ordered that the Christian priests received benefits if
they learned the Latin letters but, if they used the runic script, "the
pagan writing", they would lose the right to be teachers and priests.
Any priest discovered using the runic script was to be fined 20 gold
"pensas". Furthermore, the pagan writings were to be erased from
Church buildings, and prayer-books written in the runic script were
to be destroyed and replaced by Latin books. There was a reward of
one to ten dinars for anyone submitting ancient runic documents.
The documents and carvings were ordered to be burned "so that the
desire to return to the ancient pagan religion will be quenched."[31]
In the Hapsburg era, it was the intention of the imperial regime to
crush the national pride and present the Magyars as a wild,
uncivilized people, thereby creating a justification for its plan to
"germanize" or annihilate the Magyars. The Austrians found it very
disturbing that the Magyars had developed their own writing system
before the Europeans and therefore they sent a special commission



to Hungary to destroy everything that proved a link to the ancient
culture.[32]
Egyed Rudnay writes that the Hapsburg House and the Catholic
Church both had an interest in blackening the name of the Magyars
so that they could conquer them because they could not conquer
them by military means.[33] From the podium and from the pulpit,
they propagated the false information that the Magyars learned their
civilization from the West, that they adopted Christianity from the
West and that they learned statehood from the West. But if we look
more closely at Europe in A.D. 896, we will see how this information
could not possibly be true. Historians call the period between the 7th
and 10th centuries in Europe "the Dark Ages". The Magyars in the 9th
century found in Western Europe an uncultured and disorganized
system. The blood-union, which unified the Magyars into a
confederacy, took place about 500 years before the formation of
most of the European states. The Kingdom of France was unified
under Louis XI (1461 1483). Bismarck (1815-1896) unified the
German states. Italy was unified by Garibaldi (1807-1882). Ernst
Sackur, a Jesuit priest, writes about the situation in Europe in the
tenth century in his book "Die Cluniacenser Halle" in 1894. He states
that the aristocrats robbed and killed each other and among them,
the princes were the worst robbers. If a wandering knight gathered a
few rocks on top of a mountain, it was declared to be a castle.
Europe was prey to wild animals but people were in greater danger
from robbers. Everyone was a fugitive and a nomad with no
permanent residence. They did not build walls, but lived in caves and
lean-to shelters.
In the Chronicles of Charlemagne we see that "their buildings
were built of mud and wood."[34] The French bishops ordered the
monks to build stone walls around their monasteries as a defense
against the Norman invaders. The monks asked how they could do



that because they had no knowledge of masonry and nobody to
teach them. "What they built in the daytime fell down at night." [35]
Widukind, the chronicler of Henry the Fowler, (926-936) called the
towers built for defense against the Magyars "cities" because they
were built of stone, yet they could accommodate only nine soldiers.
Widukind noted that, besides these "cities", there were no other
stone walls in the German states.[36] In Belgium, all the old houses
were made of wood, in spite of the fact that this territory had very
few trees but was rich in stone as a resource. The stone castles of
Holland were built after the fourteenth century. Cellini, the famous
Italian gold and silversmith, who spent two years in the service of
King François I of France (1515-1547), complained that, whenever he
traveled in France, he was accommodated in a tent because there
were no buildings.
The kings of Hungary who were of foreign origin did not like the
fact that the Hungarians were more advanced culturally at an earlier
date than they were, and therefore, whenever they could, they
destroyed any evidence of cultural superiority in Hungary. For
example, The Holy Roman Emperor who became Ferdinand III of
Hungary (1537-1567), robbed the castle of Buda and the royal
graves in Székesfehérvár.[37] Leopold Hapsburg who became King
Leopold I of Hungary (1657 1705) destroyed the castle of Visegrád
because of its elegant beauty. The French castle of Blois, built in the
sixteenth century, was beautiful but had no toilets. The corridors
were used for that purpose. In the old houses of Belgium, inside
toilets were added only recently. The ruins of the tower of Visegrád
in Hungary, built in the thirteenth century and destroyed by King
Leopold I, retain traces of its water-flushing system. The castles of
Maté Csák, built in the thirteenth century and taken over by King
Charles Robert early in the fourteenth century, were all equipped
with flush toilets. The French became acquainted with bodily hygiene



and the custom of wearing underwear at the time of the crusades.
So Árpád's Magyars, who already practiced the custom of washing
themselves and wearing undergarments, found a very primitive
Europe
The Pope, the Bishop of Rome, had no more power than any other
bishop. Pope Sylvester II was brought up in the Benedictine
monastery at Cluny in France. This monastery was established in
A.D. 910 and became very influential in the spreading of Christianity.
The Cluny program was designed to increase the power of the
Papacy. The Cluny monks were missionaries who converted many
people to the Roman Catholic Church by teaching them agriculture.
[38] That this action was used as a means to gather converts is
proof that the Western peoples had no knowledge of agriculture.
That the Cluny monks did not attempt to convert the Magyars by this
method, is one proof that the Magyars already practiced agriculture.
In fact, the only place from which the monks could have learned
about agricultural methods at that time was Hungary, which was the
only territory in Central Europe where agriculture was established.
The Magyars had already used agricultural methods in Levédia, (in
Turkestan) where they were settled before they migrated to Etelköz
and the Carpathian Basin.[39] Aurel Stein, a Hungarian traveler in
Turkestan, found traces of an irrigation system, dating back to the
ninth century, in the territory that was called Levédia.[40] It is
obvious that the Magyars of Árpád, before they came into the
Carpathian Basin, were already a civilized group, since they had
developed a system of irrigation to improve on their methods of
agriculture. The Slavs who were counted among the "civilized"
western peoples, were at that same time, grazing their sheep in a
nomadic fashion. As time passed, they learned plowing and seeding
from the Avars but, since they had no horses, they harnessed their
women to the plough.[41] The situation was the opposite of what



has been propagated. The Magyars did not learn their civilization
from the West, rather the West learned from the Magyars.
In A.D. 961, the Pope crowned Otto I. Emperor, but he was greatly
disappointed with him. Otto demanded obedience from the Pope
himself. So the Pope asked Taksony, the Magyar Kagan, to support
Rome. This is another proof that the Magyars of Árpád were a
cultured people. It is unimaginable that the "barbarian", defeated at
Lechfeld in A.D. 955 would have been asked to provide this service.
Taksony's heir, Géza, gave his support to the Pope. To show his
appreciation, Pope Sylvester II sent a beautiful crown to Vajk, the son
of Géza, and crowned him King of Hungary. Vajk was converted to
Western Christianity and became known as King István I (Steven),
and later became Saint Steven. The Pope gave the Hungarians the
authority to elect their own King, who did not need to go to Rome to
be crowned but needed only the blessing of one of the Hungarian
cardinals to become King. It is obvious that the Vatican trusted the
Hungarians. At the same time, the German Emperor had to have the
blessing of the Pope at his coronation. The Hungarian crown also
possessed the apostolic right. The Archbishop of Esztergom was
named as Primate not only of Hungary but of all the Christian
nations. He was second only to the Pope. Could the "pagan, boorish,
barbarian" Magyars have been able to receive such high ranking
positions?
The Magyars had to be converted to Christianity by fire and
sword. They were Christians of the Eastern rite and were not under
the jurisdiction of the Holy Roman Emperor. In A.D. 910, Luitprand,
Bishop of Cremona, wrote: "The people of Hungary are obviously
Christian." [42] Although they were Christians, the Magyars were
branded as "pagans" so that they could be "converted" to
Christianity of the Western Rite and swear allegiance to the Holy
Roman Emperor. Anyone who was not a Christian of the Western Rite



was called "pagan".
The spreading of Western Christianity in Hungary was mainly due
to the efforts of the German missionaries. The bronze artifacts of
Kettlach, which are well known among archeologists, are all
decorated with Avar Christian motifs. (Fettich Nándor) German
monks sold those bronze artifacts to the Magyars. If the Magyars
were interested in buying these artifacts of the Christian religion,
they must already have been Christian. They were converted to
Christianity of the Eastern rite after Bulcsu Horka was baptized in the
Eastern rite in Byzantium. Bulcsu brought back a monk with him to
Hungary, made him bishop of Visegrád and established a Greek
Orthodox monastery at Visegrád. The fact that many Greek
Orthodox devotional objects can be found in Hungary, that the
Bishopric of Visegrád was Greek Orthodox and that the foundation
document of the Pannonhalma Abbey is written in Greek is evidence
that the Magyars were already Christian.[43]
Many recent Hungarian historians state that the conversion of the
Magyars to Western Christianity was necessary because otherwise
Hungary would have been erased by the attacks of the Christian
West. This is simply not true. Until their conversion, the Magyars
were in a position of superiority. The attacks from the West did not
cease with the conversion of the Magyars. Hungary was forced to
defend herself and a short time later lost her power and almost lost
her language. Latin and German became the official languages of
Hungary for almost a thousand years. Only the common people
continued to use the Magyar language. The Magyar people, who
were used to freedom and independence, were suddenly thrown into
serfdom. It was in the interest of the Holy Roman Emperor to convert
the Magyars to Western Christianity because, by doing so, he could
obtain the political rule over Hungary, which he was unable to
accomplish by military means. The military superiority of the



Magyars, which lasted for more than a century, was obvious from
their successful campaigns.

THE HOMELAND RECLAIMED
Chapter 2.
The Campaigns of the Magyars
In the tenth century, two great European leaders warred against
each other and changed the history of the era. One was Otto the
Great, King of the German states, and the other was Bulcsu Horka,
leader of one of the Magyar "nations". The accomplishments of
Bulcsu Horka have long been ignored by Western historians but they
deserve some recognition. When Otto was crowned King, in A.D.
936, he began to unify the central German states. Under his father,
Henry the Fowler (Duke of Saxony, 919-936), many feudal princes
had resisted the idea of unification and, in the reign of Otto I, they
continued to resist. Prince Ebelhardt of Bavaria led a revolt against
the King. In Saxony, Otto's brothers, Thankmar and Heinrich, also led
a revolt against him. In Lotharingia, Otto's brother-in-law, Prince



Giselbert, was the leader of the uprising and Prince Eberhart of the
Franks led his people against the King. Hugo, the King of Northern
Italy, demanded the Duchy of Burgundy. The Czechs revolted under
the leadership of Boleszlo.
Bulcsu and his inseparable companion, Lehel, who was the leader
of another Magyar "nation", both knew well the danger threatening
the Magyar people if Otto were successful in unifying the many
principalities of Germany. Only Bulcsu and Lehel, because they were
neighbors of Bavaria, were aware of this danger. The rest of the
Magyar "nations" and their leaders were far away and did not hear
much about the preparations for the unification of the German
states, so they did not sense the danger. Bulcsu and Lehel sized up
the situation well. They knew of three situations in their history
where the Germanic princes had united. One of them was the
occasion of the murder of Atilla[1] on his wedding night (A.D.453),
after which the Germanic princes temporarily united to break up the
large and powerful Hun Empire. The second was Charlemagne's
victory over the Avars in A.D. 796 and the third was in A.D. 907 when
the German King, Louis the Child, attacked the Magyars with a
united German army. He was defeated by the Magyars at the Battle
of Pozsony (later named Bratislava by the Slavs) in June, 907. The
following is an account of this battle, which is rarely mentioned in the
European history books, taken from an article by Professor Badiny.
[2]
In June, 907, an enormous German force gathered in the territory
around Ennsburg. The Germans employed the same maneuver that
Charlemagne had used successfully against the Avars. Three armies
advanced simultaneously. The King, Louis the Child, remained in
Ennsburg with Count Aribo and his army. On the Northern shore of
the Danube, was the army of Luitpold, German Prince of the Eastern
borders. The southern branch was led by Dietmar, Cardinal of



Salzburg. The commander of the Danube fleet was Price Sieghard
who was related to the King.
First, small units of Magyars exhausted Dietmar's force with
repeated harassment. Then, when all the Magyars had gathered
together, they attacked Dietmar. This attack was like a storm against
which there was no defense. The hail of arrows caused great losses
among the Germans yet the Magyars were unable to penetrate the
German lines. Therefore they employed cunning to overcome the
enemy. A small cavalry unit attacked the Germans and immediately
retreated. As they retreated, they turned in the saddle and directed
their arrows on the Germans who were chasing them, causing them
to break ranks. This was a maneuver that the Huns, Scythians and
Avars had used successfully centuries earlier. For two days, they
continued this tactic of attack and retreat and totally exhausted the
German army. On August 9, the exhausted German army was
attacked from every direction. Cardinal Dietmar died in the battle. At
night, the Magyars silently swam across the Danube on their horses
and, at dawn, before Luitpold could receive the news of Dietmar's
defeat, he was attacked by the Magyar army and he too was
defeated. Nineteen Bavarian lords and thousands of soldiers died in
battle. A few were successful in reaching Ennsburg, the camp of the
King, Louis the Child.
On the third day, the Danube fleet was attacked and Prince
Sieghard fled for his life. In three days the Magyars had defeated
three great armies. Louis the Child, with a fresh army, attacked the
Magyars. The battle took place in a forest clearing. The Magyars had
earlier hidden soldiers in the forest. The German king attacked and
the Magyars again retreated. When the Germans followed them and
passed the line of the forest, the Magyar soldiers came out of hiding
and attacked them from the rear. The retreating Magyars turned
around and the Germans, who were completely encircled, had no



chance. Only Louis the Child was able to escape with a small escort
to Passau. The rest of the army fell victim to the Magyars.
At the news of this defeat, the Bavarian populace fled deep into
the forests, the mountains and the moors and the Magyars had free
passage into Germany. They spared the castles and cities but
entered the churches and monasteries to repossess the treasures
that Charlemagne had stolen from the Avars, relatives of the
Magyars. These churches and monasteries also served as armories
for the Germans. According to the German chronicles, the Magyars
stole treasures and destroyed the following churches and
monasteries: St. Florian, Mattsee, Mondsee, Tegernsee, Schliersee,
Schaftarn, BenedictBeuren, Korchelsee, Schlehdorf, Stafelsee,
Polling, Diessen, Sandau, Siverstatt, Thierhaupten, Freising.[3]
The Western border of the land of the Magyars was at the River
Enns. The Magyars were faced with the same opportunity that had
faced Atilla after the Battle of Catalaunum. The route was free and no
army could have resisted further Magyar attacks. Neither Atilla nor
Árpád availed himself of this opportunity, although Árpád could have
used it to avenge the death of his two sons who had died in the
Battle of Pozsony. Árpád and his people did not pursue territorial
gains because they had committed themselves only to retrieve the
stolen Avar treasures and to prevent the Germans from uniting. They
had already experienced the danger first-hand at the Battle of
Pozsony and realized that their survival as a nation was at stake. The
goal of the Germans became very clear. They adopted as a slogan
the words of King Louis the Child: "The Magyars must be
annihilated." ("Ugros Boiariae Regno eliminades esse.") The same
prayer was said in the churches.
Bulcsu and Lehel took this opportunity to disrupt the interior and
foreign policies of Otto. Viktor Padányi calls their attacks on the



German states "a program of constant well-planned harassment."
Bulcsu was the greatest adversary of Otto in the middle of the tenth
century. The struggle between the two began in A.D. 937 with
Bulcsu's first great European military campaign and ended in 954
955 with his second great military campaign. (There were many
smaller campaigns in the interim.) According to Victor Padányi,
Bulcsu's inability to thwart Otto's plan does not reflect a failure of the
Magyar weaponry or the inferiority of the Magyar military force but
was a result of the German oligarchies' unreliable alliances with
Bulcsu. From the time of the campaign of A.D. 937 until A.D.955, the
Magyars made annual attacks against Otto or the German and Italian
allies loyal to Otto.[4]
Victor Padányi also states that, if we compare these military
campaigns of Bulcsu, which on the surface appear to be senseless,
with the squabbles among the German princes, then we will
recognize that these campaigns were conducted with a very
deliberate political purpose. If the Emperor made new allies within
the German states or outside of them, these new allies would, in the
following year, surely be the objects of a devastating campaign
launched by the Magyars. If one of the princes allied with Bulcsu left
this alliance and sided with Otto, then his state, which had been until
then spared from the Magyar destruction, would immediately be the
object of a Magyar attack. The Magyar military ventures were, for
eighteen years, conducted in order to prevent unification of the
German states and were not merely "robbery campaigns", as they
are repeatedly labeled by western historians.
Otto slowly gained dominance and, in a few years, became ruler
of all the German states. From the Magyars' point of view, this was a
very dangerous situation because their neighbor, the friendly
Bavaria, became a threat when it became a possession of Otto's
brother, the hostile Heinrich of Saxony. Heinrich had developed a



hatred for the Magyars during his childhood in the court of his father,
Henry the Fowler. The humiliation caused by the Magyars, the
constant fear of attack and the nine years of tribute which his father
had been obliged to pay to the Magyars all nourished this hatred. In
A.D. 949, after losing a battle to the Magyars, Heinrich of Saxony
made an oath to eradicate them from Europe. In A.D. 950, he broke
into the land of the Magyars, penetrated as far as the River Rába (the
city of Győr) and mercilessly devastated this territory, returning
home with prisoners and a large booty. This success was
exaggerated in the German Chronicles and, as a result, the Germans'
self-confidence was renewed. The chronicles, which had until then
made little mention of the hundreds of Magyar victories, now openly
stated the German intention to conquer Pannonia (part of the
Magyar territory).
Otto, too, had many difficulties with rebellious princes. Berengar
III, the son of the former Emperor Berengar, had declared himself to
be King of Italy, not as a vassal of Otto but as heir to his father. Otto
could not tolerate that. Therefore he attacked Berengar and
defeated him, even though the Magyars had come to Berengar's aid.
Berengar III was forced to give up the northern part of the Kingdom
of Italy. Otto gave these lands to his brother, Heinrich of Saxony.
Now, in addition to Bavaria, here was another threat to the Magyars
in the south-west. Ludolf, the son of Otto, jealous of the increasing
power of Heinrich, made an alliance with Konrad the Red and the
rightful Prince of Bavaria, Arnulf. In A.D.953, these three broke out in
revolt against Heinrich of Saxony. Otto intended to settle this
personally but was unsuccessful. The three rebellious princes,
Ludolf, Konrad and Arnulf asked the Magyars for help. Bulcsu saw an
opportunity to break the growing power of Otto. In A.D. 954, he led
another major campaign, with an estimate of 30,000 to 35,000
soldiers and 120,000 horses.



The Magyars, according to their custom, took along four, six,
eight, even ten horses per man, for two reasons. First, they could
exchange the exhausted horses for fresh horses, covering greater
distances, and second, they could use these extra horses to carry
the booty home. It was a widespread international custom for each
soldier to support his own family by bringing home the spoils of
battle. The Magyar soldiers carried very few personal belongings
other than the food they took with them - a sack of powdered meat,
a sack of millet and a sack of powdered milk. They also carried a
folded dried animal stomach that was used as a basin when they
needed to wash themselves.[5] They prepared the meat by boiling it
in a cauldron. Then, in its own lard, they fried it till it was red, and
then dried it in the sun. In its powdered form, it lasted for months.[6]
Let us pause for a moment and consider these facts. Almost all
western historians, writing about the Magyar Conquerors, label them
as "barbarian hordes" who conquered the Carpathian Basin in
A.D.896, yet these "barbarians" carried washing utensils with them
and also had the foresight to carry enough food, in dehydrated form,
to last the entire campaign. Almost one thousand years later in 1812,
when Napoleon attacked Russia, Kutuzov, the Commander-in-Chief
of the Russian army, destroyed all food supplies in the path of
Napoleon so that the Napoleonic army was weakened by starvation.
This was sufficient for the defeat of the French army, one of the
most advanced armies of that era. In the tenth century the Magyars
were prepared for the worst circumstances, by carrying sufficient
quantities of dried food with them.
Another advantage the Magyars had over their western
counterparts was the bow that they used as a weapon. It was a
composite bow, similar to that of the Scythians, made of dried,
animal sinews, which allowed them to take accurate aim at several
hundred meters distance. When they attacked an army they could



shoot seven or eight-hundred meters, whereas the western bows,
made of flexible wood were unable to shoot half the distance.[7]
Writing about Bulcsu's campaign, Victor Padányi states that the
Magyar army rode through the allied German territories and attacked
three Frankish states. Then, "Konrad the Red welcomed Bulcsu and
the Magyars in Worms with a fine celebration and showered them
with gifts, after which he led them to the other possessions of Bruno,
the territories of Köln and Maastricht." [8]
Today, historians still call the military campaigns of the Magyars
against Otto and the German States "robbery campaigns". How
could these campaigns be "robbery campaigns" when the German
princes themselves, including Otto's son and his brother, his
relatives and vassals requested the aid of the Magyars and even led
them to the territories they planned to attack? The purpose of the
Magyar campaigns was to repossess the Avar treasures and weaken
the enemy. Therefore, the accusation that the Magyars committed
devastation purely for the sake of robbery and looting is unjust. Their
campaigns were strategically planned and the devastation and
looting were a result of planned attacks.
Viktor Padányi continues with a description of Bulcsu's campaign
of A.D.954, which covered a large territory in a relatively short period
of time. After the Magyars had defeated the army defending
Maastricht, they rode into Brabant (presently Belgium) and attacked
Cambrai. Bulcsu's younger brother fell during the attack on the
castle. Bulcsu wanted to set fire to the city to avenge his brother's
death but he spared it on the pleas of the magistrates. The Magyars
then rode through the northern part of France and towards the south
where they destroyed Burgundy, another of Otto's possessions.
They crossed the French Riviera into Italy, where they attacked and
conquered Friault, Verona and Aquileia and then returned to their



own land. This part of the campaign, which covered over five
thousand kilometers, took approximately two months.
Victor Padányi suggests that modern military leaders examine the
leadership, military maneuvers and preparedness of this campaign.
"The whole campaign took seven months, approximately two
hundred and fifty nights, five hundred meals per soldier, five hundred
feedings and enough water for 120,000 horses. They crossed five
large rivers, the Enns, the Rhine, the Rhone and twice the river Po,
not to mention the many smaller streams."[9]
Padányi writes that Bulcsu's campaign had a shocking effect in
Europe. All across Europe, in all the churches people prayed: "Lord,
deliver us from the arrows of the Magyars" (De sagittis Hungarorum,
libera nos, Domine). The campaign had the opposite effect than that
expected by the rebellious princes. Instead of turning against Otto,
the populace turned against the princes, who were then forced to
render their loyalty to Otto. Prince Ludolf, Otto's son, barefoot and
weeping, went to ask mercy of his father, who pardoned him but
confiscated the principality of the Schwabenland. Konrad the Red
also hastened to return his loyalty to his father-in-law. Only Arnulf of
Bavaria resisted with a last desperate effort, but eventually Otto and
Heinrich were victorious. They immediately began a bloody revenge.
They executed many aristocrats and ecclesiastics. Arnulf fell
defending Regensburg and all those who could flee, took refuge
among the Magyars. The refugees desperately asked for another
Magyar intervention. Heinrich's rule, after the victory of Regensburg
was unbearable.
That was definitely a good opportunity for another campaign, if
the Magyars wanted to break up the power of Otto and Heinrich.
Bulcsu knew that well, but the circumstances were not favorable, for
two reasons. One was that he could no longer rely on any help from



inside the German states, as he had in the campaign of the previous
year, although the Bavarian fugitives assured him that the populace
of Bavaria would give him their support. The second reason was that
the prospect of another campaign was not widely accepted among
the Magyars. Each "nation" was autonomous and, before a campaign
could be launched, the leaders had to come to a unanimous
decision. It was sometimes possible to convince the leaders to act
together but they could not be ordered to do so. The "nations" were
not all convinced of the German danger, not even Taksony, who was
the Kagan, the leader of the confederacy. The soldiers, who had
returned from the previous campaign, wanted to enjoy the benefits
of the booty they had just brought home. The army recruiters
(zoltans) were unsuccessful in arousing interest in another
campaign.
In April, A.D. 955, only two divisions of the two borderline tribes
undertook the campaign but even they were lacking the motivation
to fight. They had to leave behind a stronger force than previously to
guard the borders from the hostile neighboring states. Scouts who
were sent to reconnoiter the situation returned with unfavorable
reports. The Magyars spent two months in uncertainty at the
German borderline, during which time many soldiers deserted. At the
beginning of June, Bulcsu sent an envoy to sound out Otto. In return,
Otto sent only a very small present to Bulcsu, an action that revealed
his attitude. To effect a victory on the scale of that of the previous
year, the Magyars should have had not eight or ten thousand men
but rather forty or fifty thousand. Finally, in July, Bulcsu, Lehel and
Botond decided to launch the campaign. The timing was disastrous.
By that time of the year, armies were usually returning from abroad.
During the previous three months, the heavy German militia had
been able to position itself and upset the strategy of the Magyar
army whose speed normally never gave the enemy a chance to take



up its position.
Heinrich was in possession of the castle of Regensburg, which
had been rebuilt. The Magyar army, which broke into Bavaria, also
committed the mistake of spending two weeks in a futile attack on
this castle. They left a few thousand men there to lay siege to the
castle and rode with a weakened army towards Füssen, where Otto
was waiting with all his forces. The aid that the Bavarian fugitives had
promised never materialized. The seventeen-year old Prince Arnold
of Bavaria, whose father, Arnulf, had died in battle, joined the
Magyars at Regensburg with only one hundred and twenty Bavarian
soldiers. Finally, about seven or eight thousand men rode into battle
in the Field of Lech (Lechfeld, A.D. 955) between Füssen and
Augsburg. The light Magyar cavalry was surrounded by a wall of
shields and suffered a tragic fate. The actions of the indignant
Germans were brutal and beyond words. The leaders of the Magyar
army, which was in a hopeless situation, tried to negotiate but the
Germans would not negotiate unless the Magyars laid down their
arms. After approximately five thousand Magyar soldiers had set
down their weapons in a pile, instead of negotiating as promised, the
Germans attacked the disarmed Magyar soldiers and butchered
them. Bulcsu and Lehel were hanged on the spires of the
Regensburg cathedral.
András Zakar and Endre K. Grandpierre explain what caused the
sudden fall of the Magyars at the beginning of the tenth century.[10]
German history teaches that the Battle of Lechfeld in A.D. 955 was
the final victory of the West over the Magyars, that after the battle
the Magyars were forced to turn to a peaceful life and that they
begged to receive the Christian religion. German historians write that
the Germans forgave the Hungarian atrocities and sent Christian
missionaries to convert the Magyars to the only true religion. They
insist that, after the Battle of Lechfeld, the Magyars had no power to



retaliate. This version has been taught throughout the world.
This is not true. The Magyar retaliation after the Battle of Lechfeld
was three times as devastating as their defeat at Lechfeld. In their
warring campaigns, the Magyars always deployed three separate
armies. Two were always on the offensive and the third was the
defending army. Historians, writing about the Battle of Lechfeld, for
some reason do not mention the third Magyar army. They only
mention the armies of Bulcsu and Lehel, yet Anonymus, in two
complete chapters, clearly describes the role of the third army under
the leadership of Botond.[11] Botond fulfilled his duty with great
success. It is true that he was unable to intervene in time to save his
comrades but afterwards he took a severe revenge. Anonymus
states: "The remaining Magyar warriors, when they saw their
comrades fall into a difficult situation because of the cunning of their
enemies, bravely and heroically stayed at their posts. They did not
abandon each other but did all in their power to help those who were
in trouble. Like injured lions, they ran shouting between the weapons
and they put down the enemy with horrifying killings. Although, the
armies of Bulcsu and Lehel were defeated, the Magyars of Botond
ran down those who had defeated Bulcsu and Lehel and killed them
all in a horrifying manner." "The larger part of the German army,
which was headed toward the river Rhine, was followed by Botond's
army. When the Magyar army caught up with them on the plains, the
Germans closed ranks like a swarm of bees because the Magyars,
with their arrows would not allow them either to retreat or to
advance. The Germans, frightened to death, surrendered to the
Magyars. When the Magyars captured them, they decapitated them
all. They killed them in revenge for their comrades who were killed
by the Germans. The German soldiers and the standard-bearers
numbered eight thousand.[12] That was not enough. Under the
leadership of Botond, they devastated the German states. The



Hungarian chronicler, Simon Kézai, states "... they crossed the river
Danube at Ulm and when they reached the Monastery at Fulda, they
took enormous treasures and destroyed the entire Schwabenland. At
the city of Worms, they crossed the river Rhine. There they met two
armies, the armies of the Prince of Lotharingia and the Prince of the
Schwabs. After defeating and routing these armies, the Magyars
entered the land of France and made enormous destruction among
the Christians and the monks. From here, they went to the river
Rhone as far as Raguza. They destroyed two cities, Susa and Turin
and opened the route to Italy. When they came to the flatlands of
Lotharingia, they crossed them on horseback at a fast speed and
took large booty with them. After this, they returned home."[13] The
Magyars still could not overcome the loss of the battle of Lechfeld. It
was not that losing a battle caused them great distress, but the
reason that they were so upset was that Lehel and Bulcsu were
hanged. This was not a fitting execution for courageous soldiers.
"Prince Zolta and his men were extremely upset by the dishonorable
execution of Lehel and Bulcsu and the other Magyar soldiers and
they became real enemies of the Germans. Prince Zolta and his
knights, because of the offence caused by the enemy, wanted to
take revenge and they did not make a secret of the methods they
wanted to use in revenge."[14] The Hungarian Prince Zolta organized
a second revenge after the Hungarian defeat at Lechfeld. "Prince
Zolta, fired with anger and supported financially by some Germans
who asked his help and because he was so upset by the death of
Lehel and Bulcsu, sent a huge army against King Otto. He named
Botond the captain of one army, Szabolcs as captain of the second
army and Orkony as captain of the third."[15] This is another example
of the Magyar custom of always sending three armies to a campaign.
It is obvious that the Magyars were still a formidable enemy after
their defeat at Lechfeld but shortly after that their power began to



decline. If it was not the Lechfeld defeat that caused their decline,
what caused them to lose their power? Unfortunately there are no
written documents to give us this information. If there were a secret
conspiracy in the West to annihilate the Magyars, there would
obviously be no record of it, so we would look for it in vain. If there
had been any mention made of it by Magyar historians, it would have
been erased by the Church, the fanatical advocators of the Finno
Ugric theory or the followers of the Hapsburg absolutism. Because
the Magyars have no written history of this time period, and because
the chronicles of Anonymus and Kézai were disregarded by Western
historians, the Hungarian historians simply accepted the record of
the Germans that stated that the power of the Magyars was broken
after the defeat at Lechfeld. Later Hungarian historians also
disregarded these two sources because the actions of Botond belied
their account of the peaceful Christianization of Hungary. Shortly
after his second successful campaign, the apparently healthy
Botond mysteriously lost all his strength and suddenly died.
Hungarian history makes little mention of him.
Otto I was well aware of the military strength of the Magyars, even
after their defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld. The Germans suffered
their greatest losses in the battles that followed and Otto came to
realize that it was not possible to subdue the Magyars by military
means. Therefore he decided to use the weapon of diplomacy with
which the Magyars were inexperienced. The given word was of as
much value as an oath to the Magyars as it was among the Huns.
Wess Roberts writes of the Huns: "Their guilelessness and naive
faith in human goodness frequently caused them to fall prey to the
intricacies of more skilled practitioners of diplomacy."[16] The
Magyars inherited this same characteristic. The Germans, however,
lacked this sensitivity and were more practiced in cunning and
diplomacy.



During the Middle Ages, the Church was a political power Because
the Germans were unable to make Hungary a vassal by military
means, they decided they would first convert the Magyars (who even
today are still called "pagan") to Western Christianity and then they
would be able to overpower them politically. This is why the
missionaries to Hungary were almost all Germans. The Germans did
not expect much resistance from the Magyars because they knew
that Bulcsu himself had been a Christian of the Eastern rite.
Luitprandt, Bishop of Cremona, in 910 had written that the people of
Magyarország were obviously Christian. [17]
Professor Badiny, in his paper "The Godly Conquerors" shows that
the Magyars were Christians of the Eastern rite and asks why they
are still called "pagans". He explains that, until the decision of the
Second Vatican Council of the Roman Catholic Church in 1962,
anyone who was not Roman Catholic was a pagan and a heretic.
"Only with the decision of this Council were the Christians of other
sects acknowledged to be God-fearing Christians... Therefore, the
expression "pagan" referring to the Magyars at the time of István I,
simply meant "non-Roman-Catholic".[18]
Otto was undoubtedly a better diplomat than military leader,
which is why he did not attack the Magyars in their homeland after
the Battle of Lechfeld. It was obvious to him what would have
resulted from such an attack. Instead of another attack against the
Magyars, he attempted to gain more power and prestige for himself.
His aim was, with the blessing of Rome, to crown himself Holy
Roman Emperor by Divine Right, just as Charlemagne had done. He
would gain political dominance over all the Christian nations of
Europe. With this coronation, both the Pope and Otto were expecting
to gain political power and prestige. The Pope especially was hoping
to gain more power to strengthen his influence because at that time
he was hardly more important than any other bishop. Only the Cluny



Monastery gave greater prestige to the Papacy. In spite of all this,
the coronation of the Emperor took a long time to materialize. It did
not take place until A.D.962, after the settlement of a dispute
between Otto and the Pope. Otto had taken it upon himself to defend
the Vatican but, in return he demanded political sovereignty over
Rome. Otto and the Pope could not come to an agreement. To settle
the dispute between them they asked the Magyar Kagan, Taksony,
the strongest leader at that time, to be mediator. Their request was
brought to Taksony by the monks Salectus and Genzanini Zacheus.
Egyed Rudnay, a Hungarian historian, discovered this information in
the writings of Sackur, a Church historian.[19]
It is obvious from this request that both Otto and the Pope
acknowledged the Magyars as the strongest power in Europe. Kagan
Taksony decided in favor of the Pope and hoped that in return the
Church would support him. Taksony's heir, Géza, also favored the
Papacy. Because of the alliance between the Magyars and the
Papacy, the Magyars ceased their attacks on Germany. One of the
weaknesses of the Magyars was that they had a strong belief in the
power of the given word. It was an ancient Scythian-Hun-Magyar
custom to trust the verbal promise more than the written document.
The Magyars could not even imagine that a promise could be broken.
When Kagan Taksony was asked to become mediator between Otto
and the Pope, he believed that friendship and peace would ensue.
At that time when the German "friendship" was so warm, Taksony
was a young man, 38 years old, too young for the Germans to wait
for his natural death. Here again, Hungarian history is vague. All
references merely state that, although Taksony had been in good
health, he died suddenly. His son, Géza, who was 14 or 16 years old,
took over the leadership. Otto found the time ripe to overcome the
Magyars.



It is natural and desirable to build peace and friendship with a
former enemy. This is the final goal for every war but was this really
the German goal? The Germans' feelings towards the Magyars, after
the many German losses, were obviously very hostile. But the
Germans were also convinced that they could not retaliate against
the Magyars with weapons, therefore they camouflaged their goal
and put it into a religious context. They began their "friendly"
approach to the Magyars when a child was the Magyar Kagan and a
group of advisors was ruling the country in his place.
In August of A.D.972, Otto I visited the Benedictine Abbey at
Einsiedel where he gave a charter to certain selected monks. He
selected Brother Wolfgang who was the most suited to his purpose
to be a missionary to Hungary. Historians recorded that Wolfgang's
journey was unsuccessful because, soon after his return to Germany,
Emperor Otto sent another missionary to Hungary. Wolfgang was
supposedly recalled by Bishop Pilgrim. Endre Grandpierre says that it
is unimaginable that a bishop would have the power to recall an
envoy sent by the Emperor himself. Grandpierre contradicts those
historians who say that Wolfgang's mission was unsuccessful and he
comes to the conclusion that, because of the fact that immediately
after Wolfgang's recall another envoy was sent to Hungary, the
mission of Wolfgang must have been very successful. Wolfgang was
the one who established the continuous diplomatic exchange
between Germany and Hungary. If Wolfgang had not been
successful, the Emperor would not have appointed this simple monk
to be Bishop of Regensburg on his return to Germany. That fact in
itself showed a certain tendentiousness. It was at Augsburg that
Bulcsu and Lehel were hanged after the Magyar defeat at Lechfeld
and this city was to the Germans symbolic of the defeat of the
Magyars, so the appointment of Wolfgang as Bishop of Regensburg
was also symbolic. Emperor Otto I. in A.D. 976 gave another large



land donation to Wolfgang to reward him for his efforts to suppress
the Magyars. He was entrusted with the upbringing of the German
princess, Giesel des Trau (Pledge of loyalty), known as Gizella, who
became the wife of King István I. There is no doubt that Wolfgang
was very successful in the Hungarian court because his success
ensured the acceptance of a second envoy, Bishop Bruno.
The German goal was well camouflaged by the peace and the
missionary activities. Endre Grandpierre suggests that a secret
international conspiracy attacked the Hungarian power. This
international conspiracy had such power and worked so methodically
that in a short time it crushed the unsuspecting great power of the
Magyars. There are no records of the coup, written by Magyar
historians, and the names of the participants are not known. They
were probably the advisors of the young Kagan Géza, the twelve
aristocrats who represented Hungary at the Assembly at
Quedlinburg in A.D.973, who accepted bribes from Bruno. The
Germans did not approach with their friendship when Zsolt or
Taksony were the rulers. Why not? Because under the strong Kagans
it was not possible to prepare a coup. It was easy for the advisors to
persuade a young inexperienced child Kagan to accept the new
religion.
The German and Magyar contacts, for a long period of time, had
consisted of the exchange of swords and arrows. Any other
connections such as diplomatic connections were nonexistant. After
the death of Kagan Taksony, when young Géza became Kagan,
suddenly everything changed.
Bishop Bruno showered the Magyar aristocracy with gifts from
Otto. The advantage of using gifts to bind the receiver was already
used successfully in ancient times. They first gave small unimportant
gifts and later more valuable gifts. The receiver was obliged first to



make small and later larger concessions. According to György
Győrffy, some of the gifts which the Magyars received came from
the Emperor's own treasury. Others came from the treasury of the
Archbishop of Mainz and others from the Abbey of Sankt Gallen.
Gold can open many gates. In the past, gold has opened the
gates of Babylon, Thebes, Carthage, Rome, Buda and even
Tihuanaco. Gold can raise someone to power or can destroy
empires. J. Bratianu, Minister of Rumania, boasted to the French
diplomats that he purchased Transylvania for ten million gold pieces.
He used the gold to bribe people to obtain Transylvania from the
Magyars.[20] Gold can buy empires. Bishop Bruno's large carriages,
packed with treasures, were escorted by armed guards on the road
to Esztergom. On the way, Bruno had to go to Passau to see Bishop
Pilgrim. Bishop Pilgrim was the organizer of the entire anti-Magyar
movement. He gave Bishop Bruno the letter which Otto the Great
had written to him. This is the only document, which has survived.
Emperor Otto was indubitably a great German ruler who did great
deeds for the Germans. He very skillfully camouflaged his conquest
of Hungary by spreading Christianity. He was the first to introduce
the politics of the "Drang nach Osten". His greatest desire was to
eradicate the Magyars. The following is the text of the letter written
by Otto the Great to Bishop Pilgrim of Passau:
"Otto, Emperor by the Grace of God, to Pilgrim, Reverend Bishop
of the Church of Passau. We send our regards and our grace. We
send Bishop Bruno and we commend him to your most attentive
care. Give him whatever he needs, support him with your men, with
horses and anything else he might need for his journey. Treat him
with the greatest honor and lead him carefully to the border of the
Magyars with the shortest route possible because we exhorted him
to influence the Magyar King as soon as possible to act in our cause.



Take good care of our envoy, Bruno, so that he may cautiously
accomplish his goal. If our plan is successful, it will be extremely
beneficial to you and yours." [21]
In spite of its simplicity, this letter reveals many secret thoughts
and plans. Between the lines, I see a secret plan to conquer Hungary.
The view of historians which is constantly echoed, that the Magyars
of their own will desired Christianity and asked the Germans and the
Bohemians to send missionaries, cannot be the truth. If the Magyars
really wanted Christianity, they had the opportunity to adopt it in the
Carpathian Basin because the majority of the Avars survived the
campaigns of Charlemagne and they were already Christians of the
Western rite. Why would they have approached the hostile Germans
and the Bohemians when they already had Christians in the country?
It is also a fact that the Magyars fought for a full century against
those changes, which were imposed on them when they adopted
Western Christianity. Moreover, even after they had adopted Western
Christianity, with a chain of rebellions some of them demonstrated
that they did not want to abandon the ancient faith. Tonozuba and
his wife were buried alive because they would not give up their
ancient religion. According to Grandpierre and other historians, not
all the people who came with the Árpád Magyars were Christian.
Some of them practiced the religion of the Sun-God, which was the
most ancient form of worship. They did not worship the Sun but
revered it as the representation of God. Some historians call this
religion the ancient Christianity. Luitprand called the Árpád Magyars
"Christians." The ancient religion is probably the remains of the
Manicheistic religion, which is a religion that follows Jesus but does
not recognize the Old Testament. The different religious views
among the Árpád Magyars indicate that the Magyar people practiced
religious tolerance. Wilmos Dioszegi writes that they were not
pagans.[22] Cornides, Theophilactus and Thuroczi all state that



Árpád "prayed to the One God" but at the same time honored nature.
[23] This is proof that the Magyars had a monotheistic religion.
Some of them were Nestorians and others Mazdeists but all their
religious views sprang from the basics of the Sumerian "Magus"
religion, which was the religion of love. The belief in one God and a
religion of love, which took many forms, united the Magyars. This
religious harmony, which made them strong and united, had to be
destroyed. That was the only way to break up the power of the
Magyars. If the intentions of Otto I were clear and sincere, why did
he not turn openly to Kagan Géza? Why did he warn Pilgrim twice to
be very careful and secretly enter into Hungary? We notice that the
special caution was to be observed outside the Hungarian border
and not inside it. This part can only be understood with the
knowledge that in the Middle Ages, the no-man's land surrounding
Hungary, which was used for defence, was not under the influence of
the twelve aristocrats who prepared the coup. Great caution was to
be exercised because the border guards would try to catch anyone
crossing the border. Inside the border, the men who prepared the
coup were waiting for the German envoys and escorted them not to
Géza but to their leaders, where they discussed their plan and how
to fulfill it. The result of these discussions was the presence of the
twelve Magyar aristocrats at the Assembly at Quedlinburg, which
took place at Easter time in A.D. 973. This letter also reveals that if
the plan were successful, it would be beneficial to the Germans,
which in effect meant that they would break the power of the
Magyars.
The Hungarian history of that era notes that the desire for peace
among the Magyars was so strong that they all of a sudden
sacrificed all their national interests, their ancient religion, their god,
their freedom and their territorial integrity. They did not care that
they were overcome by their enemy. They only wanted peace. Who



can believe this, asks Grandpierre, when for twenty years there had
been no wars with anyone and nobody dared to attack them because
Hungary at that time was the greatest military power in Europe?
Western historians in their records of this era, write that the Magyars
were constantly asking for peace with those Germans whom they
had recently defeated in many battles. A nation cannot change its
customs from one day to the next. This plea for peace on the part of
the Magyars was invented by historians who distorted the truth with
the intention of representing Hungary as a weakened, defeated
nation whose only escape was to become Christian. The letter of
Bishop Pilgrim to Pope Benedict VII in A.D. 974 stated: "According to
the alliance between the Germans and the Hungarians, we started to
spread Christianity as the peace prevailed."[24]
According to this letter, the Magyars and the Germans made an
alliance. This alliance meant that the Germans secretly occupied
Hungary. An interesting fact about the Quedlinburg agreement is
that every written document that has survived mentions only the
spreading of Christianity. This was the beginning of Hungary's loss of
independence. Otto I was the one who created the great power of
Germany. He was the one who first determined the politics of "Drang
nach Osten". He was the one who dictated the terms of the
Quedlinburg agreement. He announced many times that his first task
was to break the power of Hungary. Otto I was not the Pope or a
Patriarch. He was Emperor. Therefore, writes Grandpierre, his goal
could not be a religious goal but purely a political goal. Regardless
how well it was camouflaged, his only goal was to conquer the
Magyars. Otto I, at the time of the writing of the Quedlinburg
agreement. was the representative of an anti-Hungarian power.
Spreading Christianity in Hungary was just a camouflage to cover his
goal.
Earlier, I stated that the Magyars, after their defeat at Lechfeld,



remained as strong as before. If they were still such a great power,
how could the Magyars accept such a humiliating agreement as the
Quedlinburg agreement? Amadée Thierry writes about an
international coup.[25] He says that when Otto accomplished the
alliance with the Magyars at Quedlinburg, he immediately began to
fulfill his plan. Close to the Hungarian borders, he created a center, in
the city of Passau, where the Hungarian conversion (anti-Hungarian
action) would start. The leader of this center was Bishop Pilgrim. The
Pope gave Pilgrim extraordinary powers to do whatever he had to do
to convert the Magyars.
Otto decided to give a German wife (Adelhaid), to Prince Géza,
using the old accepted weapon of marriage to effect his goal. The
Germans had used this ploy once before, to remove Atilla. They gave
Krimhilda Hildegund to Atilla and she, on their wedding night,
murdered him by putting a knitting needle up his nose and into his
brain. Adelhaid's goal was not to kill Géza, but to open the Hungarian
borders to German immigrants. That was the only way for the
Germans to break the power of the Magyars. They had been unable
to do that by war, but with secrecy and politics they succeeded.
There are countries, which are weak in war but are extraordinarily
strong at the peace treaty. At Quedlinburg, only the Magyars made
concessions. The Germans made none. The Magyars gave up all
their traditions. The agreement stated that the Magyars were to
withdraw their guards from the marchlands and open their borders
to missionaries and anybody who wished to enter the country. They
were to allow churches to be built, parishes to be established and in
Hungarian territory there were to be no restrictions placed in the way
of the spreading and practising of Christianity. Prince Géza was to
marry Adelhaid and promise to give positions, land and titles to her
ten thousand German bodyguards. Amadée Thierry says that this
Quedlinburg agreement was an agreement which we would make



today with an undeveloped country in order to be able to sell our
manufactured goods and impose our moral standards.[26]
Hungary opened the gates to a Western invasion into the country,
not a military invasion, but a continuous peaceful occupation. It is
obvious that it would soon become an economic ideological and
political oppression. The representatives of the Magyars pledged
that, without any selection or regulation, the borders were opened to
anyone who wished to enter the country. They would even give them
land and help them to multiply and to climb us the social ladder by
giving them titles and positions. So Hungary, in a short time, lost its
nationalistic character and if there were any objections from the
Magyar people against this foreign invasion, the revolts were
suppressed by foreign soldiers.
The bodyguard of ten-thousand of Adelhaid, occupied Géza's
palace and he himself was a prisoner in his own palace. For the
Germans, this solution was better than killing him as they had Atilla.
But who was able to make such a demoralizing, humiliating one
sided peace in the name of the country? A legal government is
unable to make such a treaty. Only the group, which prepared the
coup, could do so, the people who gave gifts (bribes), promising to
bring peace and convert the people to Christianity. Pilgrim,
Wolfgang, and Bruno created a secret, inside power working in
foreign interests. This group accomplished the task that Otto had
been unable to accomplish with military means. This is the way that
the Hungarian great power, without losing a major war, became
subordinated to the enemy, the Germans.
The Magyars were shocked to learn that the Germans even
fabricated official documents in order to gain possession of
Pannonia. Bishop Pilgrim of Passau, on the suggestion of Otto,



fabricated four documents, which are known as the Lorch Forgeries.
These four forgeries were to be the proof that the last four deceased
Popes had placed Pannonia (now Transdanubia in Hungary) under
the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Passau.
As soon as Kagan Géza, (the father of King István I, Saint Steven),
learned of these forgeries, he immediately demanded an
investigation. Otto's accomplice, Bishop Pilgrim, asked Pope
Benedict VII to certify the validity of these documents. The Pope did
not dare to do this because Hungary was a major power in Europe
although, at the same time, Germany was the "favorite son" of Rome.
The Pope intended to satisfy the wishes of Germany and, in an effort
to do this, he came across a reference to the Tudum in his papers.
The Tudum was an Avar leader, the second-in command to the
Kagan, who, living in northern Hungary, had survived the campaign
of Charlemagne and, in 811, had accepted the sovereignty of the
Archbishop of Salzburg. Therefore the Pope appointed the
Archbishop of Salzburg to be Vicar of Pannonia and in so doing
satisfied Germany. Géza discovered this devious move and simply
ordered the German Bishop Bruno to leave Hungary. The residence
of Pilgrim in Passau was destroyed in a military assault and all the
correspondence between Pilgrim and Otto was confiscated. These
documents have never been found. This occurred in A.D. 973,
eighteen years after the so-called "fatal defeat" of the Magyars at
Lechfeld.
Kagan Géza's son, Vajk, was crowned King of Hungary in A.D.
1000. He became a Christian and took the name István (Steven).
During his reign, the Germans continued to try to dominate Hungary.
In the reign of Emperor Konrad II., the Germans again took the
offensive. From time to time, they broke into the western border
provinces of Hungary from Bavaria, but István was able to repel
them. Konrad II tried to make an alliance with the Byzantine or



Eastern Roman Emperor against the Magyars, just as Otto the Great
had done. He probably did not feel strong enough to attack the
Magyars on his own, even though the Magyars had suffered a "final
loss" to the Germans at Lechfeld. Konrad II sent his envoy, Werner,
Bishop of Strasburg to Constantinople in 1027. The Magyar King,
István, upon learning of the mission of the envoy, denied him free
passage through Hungary. That was enough reason for the German
states to attack the Magyars in 1030. They attacked with two
separate armies, one marching on the right shore of the Danube and
the other on the left shore, led by the Bohemian Prince Bratislav,
looting and destroying. In spite of this, the German attack came to
naught and the enemy was driven back to Vienna. Again, the
Magyars did not overrun the German states, because they were not
interested in territorial gains.
The German peoples, under Emperor Heinrich III, in 1042, again
tried to occupy Hungary and Prince Bratislav was again an ally.
During this campaign, the Emperor succeeded only in capturing the
castle of Pozsony. (Pozsony, now Bratislava, was the coronation city
of the Hungarians.)
In 1043, the Emperor again moved towards the Hungarian border.
The German influence within the country was strong and the
Hungarian King, Aba Samuel, subsequently made a peace offer
which was very advantageous to the Emperor. He offered to give up
Hungarian territory from the River Lajta to the Szár Mountain and
promised payment of four hundred pounds of gold as tribute along
with the freedom of the German prisoners. However, the Magyar
people did not support their king's peace conditions and forced the
king to retract his offer. As a result, in the following year, 1044, the
largest power in Europe again attacked Hungary. Simon Kézai, the
Magyar chronicler, writes that the Emperor attacked from the
direction of the city of Sopron but he could not cross the flooded



territory between the Répce and the Rába rivers. Therefore he
followed the shoreline of the River Rába in the direction of the city of
Győr, where he found a ford which allowed him to cross the river and
follow the main road leading to Győr. At the village of Ménfő, near
Győr where the battle took place on July 5, the Emperor was
victorious over the Magyar army but it was not an easy victory.
Nowhere do the Germans write of a big victory. Simon Kézai, the
chronicler, writes of the battle as follows: "In this battle, a large
number of Germans died."[27] King Aba Samuel died as he was
fleeing from the scene of the battle and Heinrich marched into
Székesfehérvár where the feudal vows were sworn in the cathedral
which was built by Saint Steven.
The Magyar nation could not accept the unbearable humiliation of
becoming a vassal of the Emperor and united to shake off the yoke.
Peter, who was crowned King as a vassal of the Emperor, was not
accepted as King by the Magyars. He was forced to flee but was
captured and was blinded. At that time a saying was coined in
Hungary: "We pay the Germans not with gold but with steel.” The
exiled grandchildren of Arpád came back as soon as they were
called and Endre became king.
In 1051, Emperor Heinrich III, collecting all the military power in the
entire empire, attacked Hungary. His Danube fleet, packed with food
and ammunition, was led by Bishop Gebhard. On the northern shore
of the Danube, the army was led by the Bohemian Prince Bratislav
and Welf, Prince of Carinthia. Emperor Heinrich III and his armies
started out in Carinthia and crossed the counties of Vas and Zala. At
the village of Sümeg, he reached the ancient Roman road and
marched against Székesfehérvár. The Magyars retreated and took
the populace and animals and all the food with them. (Again, note
that this was in the eleventh century, 800 years before Napoleon's
defeat in Russia.) They starved the army of the Emperor and, using



that tactic in many small attacks, they exhausted the enemy, taking
away their desire to fight and exhausting them mentally. Upon their
arrival at Székesfehérvár, the Emperor's army was already defeated.
At once they turned and took the shortest way home. The light
Magyar cavalry chased them and there was no escape from their
constant attacks. The northern army suffered the same fate. Bishop
Gebhard had sent a letter to the Emperor for further instructions.
The Magyars intercepted the letter and, in the name of the Emperor,
gave the order for the Danube fleet to turn back at once, so it was
not able to come to the aid of the Emperor, who badly needed it. On
October 25, the Emperor was in Hainsburg and on November 12, in
Regensburg. The greatly humiliated Emperor was thinking only of
revenge. King Endre tried to make peace but his efforts were in vain.
The Emperor convinced the Pope, Leo IX, to put pressure on the
Magyar King. The Pope excommunicated Endre but he did not
budge. He never accepted the Emperor as his feudal lord. It became
obvious to the whole world that the Holy Roman Emperor, with all his
power was not successful in making the Magyars his vassals. This
fact was reinforced by the Papal secretary, Wiebert, who noted in his
diary: "The idea of the Roman Emperor conquering Hungary has
dissolved into the air."[28]
The world's greatest lord at that time, who had already obtained
the right to make Hungary his vassal, gave up this right. The Emperor
no longer desired to have King Endre's homage, but looked instead
for his friendship. Therefore, he promised his daughter, Sofia, in
marriage to Endre's son, Salamon. Sofia, at that time, was already
engaged to the Prince of France. She broke that engagement and
married Salamon. This is again witness to the fact that the "barbarian
hordes", which according to the Finno-Ugric linguists did not even
have their own language, were able to make marriages with the
highest-ranking families as equal partners.



On September 11, 1146, Konrad III delegated the leadership of the
army to Heinrich of Austria. The united German army invaded
Hungary and took Pozsony and its castle. The Germans bribed the
castle guards and in this way were able to occupy the castle. When
the Hungarian King, Géza II, learned the news, he encircled the
castle so that the Germans occupying it had no way out. When the
German intruders learned that they could receive no outside help,
they negotiated a treaty by which they would pay a tribute of three
thousand pounds of silver if they were given free passage out of the
castle. The Magyars could have killed them but they allowed the
Germans to leave. This was a situation of negotiation similar to that
which followed the Battle of Lechfeld, where the Germans promised
to negotiate but, instead of keeping their promise, they butchered
about five thousand unarmed Magyar soldiers.
Unfortunately, European history books omit this fact and many
others about the Magyars because, if they were to mention them,
they would have to share their glory with a nation, which they do not
consider to be part of Europe. Soon after the German threat came
the Tatars, followed by the Turks and the Hapsburgs, who all tried to
occupy and destroy Hungary. These struggles caused the Magyar
populace to diminish and lose its dominant role. In the nineteenth
century, the history of Europe was written by the major powers that
omitted any mention of major Hungarian achievements throughout
the preceding millennium, since they still did not acknowledge the
Magyars as a European nation. At the same time, they over
emphasized a small defeat for the Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld
in A.D. 955, glorifying the German victory.
Regardless of how much the Germans over-emphasized the
significance of that "victory" over the Magyars, there are two factors
that diminish its importance. One is the fact that this "victory" did
not take place in the land of the Magyars but in the heart of Germany



and the other is that, for seventy five years following this "victory",
the Germans did not dare to risk an attack against the Magyars. In
A.D. 1030, when Emperor Konrad II. invaded Hungary and advanced
as far as Pozsony King István I. defeated the Germans, chased them
out of the country and oven occupied Vienna. This significant victory
of the Magyar army over the Germans, which occurred after the
slaughter of the Magyars at Lechfeld, is not even mentioned in the
European history books.
So we can see that both sides had a specific aim in mind when
they went to war. While the Magyars were asked by the German
princes to aid them in their inside struggles, the Magyars used that
opportunity to maintain the balance of power in Europe. At the same
time, the German Emperor intended to subdue the Magyars and
make them his vassals. During the many campaigns that the
Germans launched against the land of the Magyars, they devastated
the country just as the Magyars did the German states. While the
Magyars were weakened by centuries of continuous struggles and
wars, the western world grew in numbers and progressed in the area
of the sciences and the arts. Western historians wrote the history of
Europe. They made of the Magyars a band of robbers who just
robbed the West but, at the same time, they did not mention their
own goal of aggression.
[1] Western historians spell this name "Attila" but I will follow the
recommendation of Professor Ferenc Badiny-Jós who writes "Atilla".



Atilla was named after the ancient name for the river Volga, the River
Etel. Etel or ATIL means "the water of life". With the suffix LA, it
becomes "giver of the water of life" -- A-TIL-LA.

THE HOMELAND RECLAIMED
Chapter 3.
The "Annihilated" Avars
As early as 1882, Zsigmond Fekete, a Hungarian researcher, came
to the conclusion that the reason for the so-called "robbery
campaigns" was the repossession of the stolen treasures of the
Avars. He noted that it appeared to the Magyars, at the time of the
campaigns, as if they were traveling to well-known places because
they found Magyar artifacts that were familiar to them.[1]
The artistry of the Avar treasures is legendary. So that we may
have an idea of the quantity of the Avar treasures taken by
Charlemagne, I shall name a few places which were recipients of the
treasures in Charlemagne's will: Aachen, Rome, Ravenna, Milan,
Aqueilia, Grado, Cologne, Mainz, Salzburg, Trier, Sens, Besancon,
Lyon, Rouen, Rheims, Aries, Vienna, Embrun, Bordeaux, Tours,



Bourges. The personal recipients of gifts are almost innumerable.
Einhard, the chronicler of Charlemagne, also benefitted. As a master
silversmith, he tried to adapt the eastern motifs into the Western
Christian artistic objects.
It is mistakenly believed that Charlemagne annihilated the Avar
aristocracy and maybe even the entire populace. Gyula László, who
researched the tenth century graves in Hungary, discovered that the
Avar graves greatly outnumbered the Magyar graves, an indisputable
proof that the Avar populace did not "vanish" in the 8th century but
survived the campaigns of Charlemagne and Pepin.[2] The Avars
were buried in separate cemeteries, so the identification of the
graves was not a difficult task. We know for a fact that the wife of the
Magyar Kagan, Taksony, was an Avar and also that several of the
military leaders in the tenth century campaigns were Avars who
survived Charlemagne's campaigns, regained their strength, and
often led the Magyars to the sites of the stolen treasures. The
Hungarian archeologist, Bálint Csanád, who examined the graves of
the 10th. century Magyars, came to the conclusion that the military
leaders who set out to repossess the treasures were Avar aristocrats.
[3] A picture on the title page of the Képes Krónika (Magyar
Chronicle) shows five Avar leaders with medals indicating their rank.
Many sources report that the Avars (Huns) were still living in
Pannonia when Arpád's Magyars entered the Carpathian Basin.
According to the Chronicle of Salzburg in the twelfth century: "The
Magyars who came from Scythia chased out the Huns."[4] According
to Gervinus Ricobaldus: "The Magyars came from Scythia and took
over Pannonia, chasing out the Avars who were the people of Atilla."
[5] They were referring to Upper Pannonia. Otto, Bishop of
Friesingen in the thirteenth century, Dandolo of Venice, the Bojar
Chronicles, Ptolemy Lucensis in the 14th. century and, in the 15th.
century, Gobelinus Persona all mentioned that the Magyars settled



among the Avars in Pannonia (Lower Pannonia).
Since the Avars left many geographical names and names of
settlements, such as Bécs (the Magyar name for Vienna), Miskolc,
Kassa (now Kosice in Slovakia), Eger, Győr, Fehérvár, Csanád,
Veszprém, Szeged and Kikinda, and since the Magyars were
outnumbered by the Avars and spoke a dialect of their language, the
Magyars had no need to change the Avar place names which
remained in the Hun/Avar/Magyar language. It is an accepted fact
that a people will not borrow settlement and geographical names
from another language. A people always uses its own language for
this purpose. Although the Magyars encountered a much larger Avar
populace living in the Carpathian Basin, the Magyar language did not
die out as the language of the Bulgars did when they settled into a
larger Slav populace. This is why we can state with certainty that the
language of the Avars was Magyar.
Einhard, the Chronicler of Charlemagne, noted that the Avars
really loved gold and precious stones. He described the war, which
Charlemagne waged against the Avars in Upper Pannonia. He stated
that the Avars were annihilated: "The utter depopulation of Pannonia
and the site of the Khan's palace now a desert, where not a trace of
human habitation is visible... The entire body of the Hun nobility
perished in this contest, and all its glory with it." He also stated: "...no
war in which the Franks have ever engaged within the memory of
man brought them such riches and such booty...one may well think
that the Franks took justly from the Huns what the Huns had
formerly taken unjustly from other nations."[6]
The map of the Frankish Empire in the Harper Atlas of World
History,[7] shows the eastern border of Charlemagne's Empire,
marked with a heavy line, but fails to mention that this was also the
western border of the Avar Empire which lasted for two hundred and



fifty years. This atlas does not contain a map of the Avar Empire.
The city of Győr, in the Danube valley, was the capital of the Avar
Empire, whose borders stretched from the Black Sea to the Baltic
Sea, from the River Enns to the River Don. Einhard's account of the
way the Franks obtained the Avar treasures is not exact. He writes
that there were so many battles and so much bloodshed that every
living creature in the area surrounding the Kagan's palace was
annihilated and the whole area became a "desert". In the yearbook of
the Lorch Abbey, it is written that the Jugur and the Kagan were
slaughtered.[8] From this source, we also learn that the one who
planned this murder and carried it out was the Tudum who was the
second-in-command after the Kagan. This source calls him "regulus"
- little king. Aventinus, the German chronicle which was published at
a much later date, states that the Tudum poisoned his father-in-law,
the Kagan, with wine. (321a, 277). Therefore the booty mentioned by
Einhard was not obtained as war booty but from robbery with
murder. Johannes Longus writes that the Tudum, the Prince of the
Avars or the Huns, surrendered himself and his country to
Charlemagne and he became Christian in A.D.795.[9]
Einhard also writes that the whole area became like a desert, with
no survivors, because of the bloodshed of the many battles. If that
were true, then there must have been a great number of Franks who
also fell, since the Avar Empire was, at that time, the strongest power
in Europe. The campaign led by Pepin a year later was a cover-up for
the murder of the previous year so that he could claim that the
treasures were booty from the campaign. Einhard may have been
exaggerating when he reported that only two Frankish leaders died
in Pepin's campaign. The Avars were so strong that they were feared
by every other nation and some smaller nations even posed as Avars
in order to avoid being attacked. It is unimaginable that such a strong
force could not have killed more than two leaders. The only other



explanation is that without their Kagan, whom they had lost in the
previous year, the Avars became an easy target for the Franks.
Einhard calls the Avars "Huns" and uses the names
interchangeably. Those Avar-Huns, who survived Charlemagne's
campaigns, united with the Magyars who had come to reclaim their
homeland in the Carpathian Basin and, during the Magyar
campaigns, tried by all means to repossess the treasures they loved
so much. Again, these were not "robbery campaigns". Robbery is a
crime in which property is forcefully taken from its owner. The
repossession of this property is not a crime. Einhard's statement that
the Franks "rightfully" took the treasure from the Avars because the
Avars "unjustly" took it from other nations, is far from the truth. The
Hun/Avar Khanate was a military and mercantile empire. The Huns/
Avars were allied with Persia against Byzantium and they collected
an annual tribute from Byzantium in order to avert a war. At that time
this was a widely accepted practice. The Roman and Byzantine
Emperors and also Alexander the Great all collected tributes in
exchange for keeping the peace. The Avar Empire was the strongest
power in Europe. If that were not so, Byzantium would not have paid
a tribute of 80,000 soldii per year for 54 years, a total of 4,320,000
soldii, (soldius was the money unit).[10] Very few of the Avar
treasures originated from the West. Only one time, when the
Frankish king, Siegbert, lost a war against the Avars, the Franks had
to pay a heavy tax but the amount has never been specified.
The silk route from China to Europe crossed the Avar Empire. The
Avars collected a toll from the merchants. Tributes and tolls were the
two major means in addition to trading by which they amassed their
treasures. A third way in which the Avars obtained their treasures
was by means of the exchange of gifts which accompanied
diplomatic negotiations. The more powerful the negotiator, the
greater the gift. In this way the Avars received many valuable



treasures. When Byzantium became short of soldius, the Byzantine
Emperor began to pay his tribute with precious artifacts. The custom
of the exchange of gifts was based upon ancient traditions. Can the
collection of tributes and tolls by the Avars be considered to be
"unjust" when it was a
commonly accepted practice? Even if it were, does this justify
Charlemagne's robbery of the Avars? Most of the treasures which
were taken from the Avars by Charlemagne were deposited in the
cathedrals and abbeys of Europe.
According to Anonymus, one of the Avar leaders was named Orsur.
During the campaigns, one of the companions of the Magyar Kagan,
Taksony, was the Avar leader called Urcund. These names
demonstrate what a large role the “annihilated” Avar aristocrats
played during the Magyar campaigns. Árpádʼs Magyars
acknowledged the “annihilated” Avar aristocrats as equal partners.
This was obvious in the record of the negotiations between the
Magyars and the Byzantine Emperor, when the names of the Magyar
leader, Árpád, and the Avar leader, Kursan, are mentioned with equal
respect. The two peoples, the Avar and the Magyar, kept their own
identities within the nation but, in the case of war, they united under
the priest-king, Árpád.
During this period, the Avar people still retained its good name
even after the victory of Charlemagne. The Franks needed to explain
their theft of the Avar treasures, so they used Christianity to justify
their exploitation. They declared that their robberies were the will of
God. This is why Einhard wrote that the Franks took the Avar
treasures "rightfully" but, in all honesty, is there any justification for
these robberies, even if the Avars had come into possession of these
treasures illegally?



As Christianity became stronger, the name of the Avars received a
greater and greater degree of notoriety, until there was no nation,
which would establish any connections with them. Later, even the
Magyars, after they had been converted to Western Christianity,
refused to associate with them and withdrew from the Avars all the
power that they had held. It was even forbidden to mention their
name. This is why the other name of the Avars, the name "Várkun"
was used in a shortened form: "Kun". "Várkun" meant the Kuns who
lived in castles. "Vár" in Hungarian means "castle". These Avars
became known as the Kuns or Cumanians. We now have a clear
picture of the design of the Christian religion. Instead of uniting the
two brother-nations, the Avars and the Magyars, who had the same
language, the Church separated them and made them deadly
enemies of one another. The reason was that the Kun / Avar nation,
who lived outside of the Carpathian Basin had not yet accepted
Western Christianity. Note that the Avars within the Carpathian Basin
were Christian. Charlemagne wanted to take their land, so ruined
their name.
King László, (1077-1095) who was known as Saint László, the
most well-loved of the kings of the Árpád Dynasty, whose
achievements greatly benefitted the nation, strengthened and
expanded the Magyar borders. During his reign, the Magyar nation
was almost invincible. These achievements were superficial because
it was he, in the long run, who caused irreversible damage to the
nation. He extended the Magyar influence to territories where the
Magyars were not in the majority, territories which he had inherited
from relatives. After the death of Demeter Zvainimir, the Croatian
king, in 1088, the Croatians offered him the throne. Until 1920,
Croatia was an autonomous kingdom within Hungary,
At the same time, Saint László prevented the Cumanians (Avar
Kuns), who lived beyond the Carpathian Mountains, from entering



the Carpathian Basin. These Cumanians were allied with Byzantium
and were trying to rejoin their separated brothers. All Magyar-related
people, during the previous millennium, had regarded the Carpathian
Basin as their homeland. But these brother-nations were separated
by religion. Rome would not allow the "pagan" Cumanians to settle
among the Magyars and Avars who were already Christian because
she feared that the newly Christianized Magyars and Avars would
discard their Christianity and return to paganism. (Even so, about
two hundred years later, in the reign of King Béla IV, 40,000
Cumanian families were allowed to enter the Carpathian Basin and
settle between the Danube and Tisza rivers, territories presently
called Kiskunság and Nagykunság.)
The Germans, too, feared an influx of Avars, which would
strengthen the power of Hungary. The Christian beliefs aided the
German interest. Saint László almost annihilated the Cumanians
living outside of the Carpathian Basin and, in so doing, left room for
the Slavs and Vlachs who were freed from slavery after the fall of
Byzantium in 1204 to infiltrate into the territories of the Huns and
Avars, whose populace was now very sparse.
In the eleventh century Huns, Avars and Magyars were still living
in the northern part of Hungary (Felvidék) now Slovakia. This was an
independent state called the country of the Black (northern)
Magyars. In the travel log of the Bishop of Camers, Kietbertus.
during his journey to the Holy Land in A.D.1054, he writes: "after a
long journey across the barbarian country which is inhabited by the
Huns, we crossed the Danube, and reached the King of (Lower)
Pannonia." (Southern Hungary)[11] The Abbot of the St. Hubert
Abbey, Theodoric, also took the same route to the Holy Land. When
he reached Felvidék (Northern Hungary) he was attacked by the
"barbarians" and was forced to enter Upper Pannonia.[12] It is
probable that this part of Northern Hungary was called "Fekete



Magyarország". "Fekete" means "black" and black was used by the
Huns to indicate a northern location. Bishop Bruno, in A.D.1008,
travelled by boat to the Black Huns from Regensburg. Ademarus
wrote that later Bishop Bruno went to the territory called "Fehér
Magyarország". "Fehér" means "white". Therefore he went to the
territory of the Árpád Magyars or White Magyars who were relatives
of the White Huns (Western Huns).[13] Again, Ademarus writes that
White Magyars of the country of King István (King Steven) attacked
the Black Magyars and converted them to Christianity "by force and
with love".[14] King István caused his uncle, the ruler of the Black
Magyars to flee to Poland.
Because the Szeklers who live in Transylvania (Erdely) believe that
they are descended from the Huns, modern historians have
concluded that this area of Hungary was the location called "Black
Magyarország". However, this is not so since a journey by boat from
Regensburg to Transylvania is not possible. (See the aforementioned
quotation about Bishop Bruno.) It is also not likely that the ruler of
the Black Magyars would flee towards Poland from Transylvania. This
means that the Black Magyars lived in Felvidék, in the County of
Nyitra, in Northern Hungary.
Similarities between more than 300 names of settlements in
Felvidék and in Transylvania prove that, after the annexation of the
Black Magyars by the White Magyars of István I, large numbers of
the Black Magyars were resettled into Transylvania to serve as
border guards. These settlements were not established all at once,
but gradually, as needed. A few examples of settlement names
follow:
Felvidék Transylvania



Abód Székely-abód
Pusztabodok Bodoki (mountain)
Zsuk Felső-Zsuk
Enyedpuszta Nagy-enyed (Aiud)
Eresztvé~ny Eresztvény
Komjat Komjatszeg
Vajna Vajnafalva
Nagykolozs Kolozsvár
Again it is clear that the Huns, Avars, Magyars and the Szeklers who
are related to the Huns, all spoke the Magyar language.
Who were the Avars, whom history teaches were annihilated by
Charlemagne? When did they come to the Carpathian Basin? The
Avars appeared in Europe in three waves, in A.D. 550, A.D. 568 and
A.D. 670. We have been erroneously taught that the Avars were
descendants of the Eastern Asian people called Juan-Juan. The
Avars migrated from the territory of the White Huns (Western Huns)
to the West after A.D.550 and settled in the eastern part of the
Carpathian Basin. Albion, King of the Lombards, who had occupied
Pannonia since the collapse of the Hun Empire in A.D. 453, asked the
Avar Kagan, Bajan, to form an alliance against the Gepidae, a
Germanic tribe. As a result of the ensuing struggle, the Avar/Huns
repossessed the Great Hungarian Plain, which was originally the
central point of the Hun Empire. In A.D. 568 and 569, when the
Lombards departed from Pannonia, the Avars immediately occupied



that territory and extended their western borderline to the River
Enns, the former borderline of the Empire of Atilla. In an alliance with
Persia, the Avar/Huns defeated the army of the Byzantine Emperor,
Eustinius II. and forced him to pay them an annual tax. Eventually the
Byzantine "soldius" was devalued and the Avars, under the rule of
Kagan Bajan, restored its value by the addition of gold to the coins
using them as Avar currency.[15]
The Chinese called the Western Huns "White Huns" or "A-pa". The
Persians called them "Abar". Around A.D. 310, one branch of the Hun
tribes conquered Western Turkistan and assimilated the populace
they found there, the "Var" and "Abar" peoples. The name of one of
the Avar tribes was "Var" and another was "Chuuni" and they were
also known as the Var-Kuns. The Onogurs and Sabirs (Subareans)
called all these peoples in Asia and in Europe "Avar" or "Apar". The
Hun/Avar names were used interchangeably. The names "Abar" and
"Apar" were used for the same people that the ancient Greeks called
"Aparno" who were actually the Parthians.
The history of the Parthians is not yet well known. Historians
represent them as a people of unknown origin, in spite of the fact
that there are enough data to identify their origin. Their empire
extended from the Euphrates River to India and for five hundred
years Rome was unable to defeat them. Professor Badiny made a
study of the Parthians, in which he quotes Professors Basham,
Pijoan, Frye and Ghirshman.[16] Professor Basham writes that the
Parthians came from the North in about 250 B.C. and occupied
Bactria, but he does not mention that the Parthians were part of a
huge ethnic unit.[17] In a very short time, they were able to establish
an empire that extended from the River Euphrates, in the west, to the
Indus River, in the east. The southern border was the Persian Gulf
and the northern border was a line from the Caucasus Mountains, to
the Caspian Sea and the Oxus River (the Amu Darya). This empire



lasted for five hundred years in spite of constant attacks by the
Romans. During that period of time there was no civil war within the
Empire. The Parthians were united in their struggle against the
Romans. Another interesting fact is that they introduced entirely new
customs and decorative motifs to the people of this territory.
Jose Pijoan describes the arts of the Parthians. He states that the
Parthian art cannot be categorized as Hellenistic as is generally
claimed, but was the "forerunner" of the Byzantine style of art.[18]
This conclusion was drawn from artifacts found in recent excavations
in the Chorezm, which were created by the Sassanidae, one of the
many peoples who lived in the Parthian Empire. In addition to the
Parthian art objects, there can be found ornaments of many different
styles, which indicates that the Parthians were a people of an
advanced and enlightened culture. Moreover, the theater was
already a well-developed art form. We can definitely say that these
people were not nomads as is generally believed.
According to Richard N. Frye, the Parthian custom for the
succession of kings was "unusual and obviously Asian".[19] The
crown was inherited by the eldest male of the ruling tribe, who also
had to be the fittest, physically and mentally, and not necessarily the
son of the deceased ruler. If we combine the observations of
Basham, Pijoan and Frye, we can conclude that the Parthians came
from the North; their art was unique and their custom of royal
succession indicates that they were Turanian or Ural-Altaic.
Historians say that the term "Turanian" or "Ural-Altaic" is just as
comprehensive as the term "Indo-European", so we are actually no
closer to identifying the origins of the Parthians. However, one
source, Sebeos, tells us that, in 210 B.C., Arsak, the eldest son of the
King of the Ephtalites (the White Huns) became King of the
Parthians.[20]



Roman Ghirshman writes in detail about the Parthians but does
not identify their origin:
"These people who originated from 'one center' in spite of
encountering, in this large territory, autochthonous peoples and
differences in climate and terrain, succeeded in developing an
elaborate civilization."[21]
In Ghirshman's description, there is not a word of
acknowledgement or praise for the people who united and ruled this
huge territory for five hundred years and caused the collapse of the
empire of Alexander the Great.
If we examine more closely the three peoples who made up the
Parthian ethnic unit, the Sarmatians, the Sacae and the Kush, we will
come to a surprising conclusion: all three are of "unknown origins".
At least, this is what the Indo-European historians and linguists teach
us. How is it possible that a powerful nation, which ruled for 500
years and developed such a high level of civilization and culture,
could be "of unknown origin"?
Elemér Csóbánczi suggests that the problem began with the
ancient Greek historians who gave to the ancient people of the
Caspian Sea territory names in the Greek language, which they had
fabricated. Thus the ancient Caspian people were named "Scutas" or
"Scyhae" (Scythians).[22]
Justinus M. Junius, a Roman historian who lived in the second
century A.D., writes that, according to another historian, Trogus
Pompeius, the world's most-ancient people were the Scytha.[23]
Numerous Greek, Latin, Armenian and Chinese records state that the
principal tribe of the Scythians were the Kush (Chus). Calmet, the
famous biblical commentator, noted that another frequently
mentioned Scythian tribe was the Saga tribe.[24] This name, "Saga",



was a Greek name for the Kush (Chus) tribe. Both names refer to the
same people. Calmet says that the same thing happened to the
Massageta tribe. The name "Massageta" is of Armenian origin but
was distorted by the Greeks. The Armenian meaning of "Massageta"
was "Great Chus". According to Armenian writings, "Massageta" was
originally written "Maschus" or "Massachut". They combined two
words, "Mas" and "Chus"or "Chut". The Armenians used
"Massachut". The Greeks pronounced it "Massageta". From the Chus
name came the later name Chazar or Kazar. The Arabs called the
Caspian Sea "Chusar", which came from the name "Chus" or "Kush".
"Mare Caspium Arabicus Cusar."[25] The ancient historians most
often mention these three tribes: Daha, Saca and Massageta.[26]
The Scytha, Massageta, Saca, Daha, and Chus (Kush) names all
refer to the same people. Herodotus, Strabo and Eustinius all
describe a bloody war between Cyrus, the King of Persia and
Tomyris, Queen of the Scythians. All three mention different people's
names. Herodotus mentions Tomyris as Queen of the Massageta.
Strabo calls her the Queen of the Saca and Eustinius calls her the
Queen of the Scytha. Among the ancient Scythian peoples, the
Parthians have an important historical name. The Parthians were a
branch of the ancient Chus/Kush tribe, which departed from the
main tribe and thus they received their name. The Armenian
historians sometimes called them "Chus" (Kush) and sometimes
"Parthus." Finally the name "Parthus" remained.[27]
Mosis Chronensin wrote that the Kazars appeared for the first
time in the first century A.D.[28] Elemér Csobánczi suggests that
upon superficial examination the Kazars might appear to be of
Turkish or Jewish origin. It is probable that they were neither of
these. First of all, the ancestors of the Turks appeared for the first
time in A.D. 600, five hundred years later than the appearance of the
Kazars. The Jewish origin appears unlikely because only the Kazar



Kagan, his relatives and aristocracy were converted to Judaism,
approximately 300 families. It was this conversion, which caused the
Kazar revolt. A small minority tried to force the Jewish and Talmud
laws on the Kazars and others who lived in their empire. Another
argument against their being Jews is that even if all the Kazars had
been converted to Judaism, they would only have been Jews by
religion, not by race. They were not a Semitic people.
Csobánczi quotes from Byzantinus Faustus: "The king of the
Massagetae, the leader of numerous Hun armies, gathered all his
forces ..." and from Eliseus: "...destroyed the defences of Tzur and
led the Massagetae... opened the gates of Tzur, city of the Alans,
and allowed the army of the Huns to enter."[29] Csobánczi asks
what happened to the Massagetae and Scythians of the fourth
century A.D. and where the Huns were hiding before A.D.375. He
suggests that the Huns were relatives of the Massagetae, Sacae,
Dahae, Sarmatians, and Scythians, with the same customs and an
advanced equestrian culture because they "appeared" on the same
territory just as the these peoples "disappeared".
When the Greeks came to the conclusion that the Scythians were
made up of many different peoples, the concept of "Scythian"
changed. Procopius wrote of Atilla's "Massageta-Hun" regiment. The
Greeks began to use Greek names for the different Scythian peoples:
Dahae, Sacae, Thysogetae, Parthi. All these names were incorrect
because they were not the names by which these peoples called
themselves but were all Greco-Roman historical distortions.
Viktor Padányi writes that, in the first century A.D., these names
all disappeared just as the name "Scythian" did and, at the same
time, new names appeared on the same territory: Huns, Avars, Sabirs
(Subareans), Kushites, then Onogors, Saragurs, Kazars, Turks, and
Magyars.[30] Present day historians use approximately 300 names



for these same peoples who lived in Eurasia.
Historians generally believe that the ancient Scythian people died
out or were absorbed into other nations but, as the findings of
archeologists in Mesopotamia became known, historians noticed
that these Greco-Roman names were not known in Sumer, Babylon,
Assyria, Chaldea, Syria, Elam, Persia and the territory of the Hittites.
Instead of the Greek names, such names as Hunut (Karnak
inscriptions) Unni (Persepolis inscriptions), HsiungNu (Chinese
Annals), Chus (Kassu, Assyr, As, Uzi, Kusan, Khazar), Avar (Vár, Obor,
Apar, Par, Parni, Parthi), Dah, (Tachi, Taochi, Dak), Shupri, (Sparda,
Saspir, Savard, Sabartoi), and other variations in the Caucasian and
Caspian territories were found in Egyptian, Babylonian, Assyrian,
Chaldean, Hittite, Persian, Armenian, Neo-Persian and Arabic
sources from the 17th century B.C. to the 10th century A.D.[31]
Viktor Padányi points out that the word "saca" means "people".
The plural "sakit" means "peoples", from which "Skita"- or "Scyth" is
derived. Csobánczi goes even further and concludes that the Huns
and the Scythians were identical peoples.[32]
The connections between these peoples can clearly be seen. If
we examine the three ethnic components of the Parthian Empire, we
can state that all three belonged to the Turanian or Ural-Altaic group.
One of them, the Sarmatians, whom Herodotos called "Sauromata",
can be easily identified with the Sumerian SA-UTU-MADA which
means "heart .... inside ....city" or "the heart of a country". This name
became the name of a country and when the country no longer
existed it became the name of a people.[33] The name "Sauromata"
then was derived from the Sumerian language.
The second ethnic unit in the Parthian Empire was the Saca. We
already know that "Saca" means "people". The third was the Kush



(Chus) people. Eliseus mentioned that the Huns were called Kush
and according to Asolich the Massageta were also Kush.[34] So it is
obvious that although the Greeks mentioned many peoples living in
the Parthian Empire, these nations all belonged to "one people"
speaking the same language. One of the names of these peoples
was "Huns", relatives of the Avars and the Magyars.
József Tóth has written a short study of the Huns and Avars.[35]
Since the contemporary writers called these people Huns, Avars and
Magyars interchangeably, we may conclude that these people all
used the same language, dress and customs. Imre Luchinics, in the
introduction of his translation of the writings of Menander, quotes
the opinions of some historians in connection with the Hun-Avar
names. Malalas calls the Avars one of the tribes of the Huns.[36]
Theophilactus uses both names interchangeably and calls the Avars
"Huns".[37] According to Menander, we know that Hun interpreters
were used by the Byzantines to communicate with the Avars. The
chronicler of the Lombards, Paulus Diaconus, writes: "The Huns who
are also Avars" and "Huns who are also called Avars".[38]
The contemporary historians probably took their information from
the fact that the Vár-Huns absorbed many Hun peoples such as the
Sabirs (Subareans) and the Huns of Pontus, whose leader was called
Mogyer. We can presume that Magyars fought alongside Avars from
the writings of Theophilactus: "The Hun-Ugors received the first
Avar appearance in Europe around A.D.460."[39] The Hun-Ugors
were also called Magyars and there were Magyars who came with
the Avars. The second influx of Avars in A.D.568 was again
welcomed by the Hun-Ugors and at that time again Magyars came
with the Avars into the Carpathian Basin.[40]
The Magyar Chronicles relate that, after the Battle of Krimhilda, in
A.D.453, (in which the Huns were defeated by the Goths), three



thousand Hun men retreated to the field of Csigle. The Huns lived
there for several centuries before the Magyars returned to their land.
[41] Hungarian historians presumed that the field of Csigle was
located in Transylvania, since the Szeklers believe themselves to be
the descendants of the Huns, but its exact location was never
identified.[42]
There are three places called "Csigle" in historic Hungary. One is
located in the north (Felvidék) in the county of Nyitra (presently in
Slovakia). Its present name is Szigel, but in 1461 it was written
"Cyglen".[43] The second "Csigle" is in the county of Veszprém and
is presently called "Csögle". The third "Csigle" (now Csiglen in
Magyar and Ciglean in Rumanian) is in the county of Szilágy in
Transylvania.[44] In the neighborhood of the first "Csigle" there is a
village called Szakoly, and near the third "Csigle" there is also a
village called Szakoly. Szakoly is a dialectical variation of the name
Székely (in English - Szekler). Which one of these "Csigles" was the
one mentioned in the Chronicle? We cannot regard the "Csigle" in
the County of Veszprém as a possibility because, until the year A.D.
536, it was occupied by the Goths who were the major instigators of
the rebellion of the people of the Empire against the sons of Atilla.
The "Csigle" in the County of Szilágy in Transylvania cannot be
counted either because that territory was under the rule of the
Gepidae. King Ardaric of the Gepidae was the most faithful friend of
Atilla but, after the death of Atilla, he became one of the most hated
enemies of the Huns. It is not likely that a group of defeated Huns
would have saught refuge in his territory.[45] Therefore the "Csigle"
in the County of Nyitra, in the valley of the River Nyitra, was the "field
of Csigle" in which the three thousand Huns were able to find a
hiding place.
This conclusion is supported by the fact that the final battle
between the Huns and the Goths took place at Krimhilda in



Pannonia, near the Neato River, according to Jordanes.[46] Among
geographical names, the river names undergo the least amount of
change. The name "Neato" can be easily understood to be the
Nyitra River. There is no other river in Felvidék which begins with the
letter "N". Therefore the battle probably took place in the southern
part of the Nyitra River, close to the Danube, where Atilla's eldest
son, Ellak, fell. Atilla's other two sons, Dengezik and Irnik moved to
the territory between the Danube and the Tisza. A village name
witnesses to the fact that the Huns lived here. It is presently called
Romani but in the twelfth century it was Tuman. In the fourteenth
century, the name Tuman was still in use but later it was no longer
used.[47] Tuman was an ancient Hun name. The father of the
legendary Hun Emperor, Motun, was called Tuman (Toban) at the
end of the third century B.C.[48] There was a Hun settlement in the
fourteenth century on a peninsula in the Azov Sea, which was called
Toban (Tuman).
Is it possible that the three thousand Hun men were able to
remain in hiding in the field of Csigle? The writings of Menander
Protector (in A.D. 581) appear to prove so when he mentions the Hun
interpreters in Byzantium.[49] Why would the Byzantines have kept
Hun interpreters if they had no need for them?
In A.D. 568, new groups of Avar /Huns accompanied by groups of
Magyars arrived to strengthen the group in Csigle. They were called
Avars or VárKuns. The contemporary chronicles do not mention the
Huns in Csigle but, a century later, the King of the Longobards,
Perctari (Bertaridus) says: "In my youth, when I was dethroned and
exiled in A.D. 662, I went into hiding and found refuge with a pagan
king who was ruler of the Huns."[50]
After A.D. 670, still more groups of Avar /Huns and some Magyar
tribes arrived, led by Kuber. "In the vast region of the Steppes, when



many peoples co-existed, it was the strongest group, militarily, which
gave its name to the Empire. First the Huns rose to power, then the
Avars, followed by the Magyars, but all co-existed for centuries."[51]
The West knew of the Magyars but did not recognize the names they
called themselves, Utigurs and Kutigurs.
The ruler of the Avar Empire was called the Kagan and the Tudum
was his second-in-command. According to the Chronicles, at the
end of the 8th. century, after an eight-year long war against
Charlemagne and the Franks, an inside struggle broke out among
the Avars and the Tudum murdered the Kagan. In A.D. 795, the
Tudum sent an envoy to Charlemagne, announcing his surrender and
his decision to become a Christian.[52] At the same time
Charlemagne undertook his second campaign. He plundered Győr,
the capital of the Avar Empire but spared the territory of the Tudum,
north of the Danube (Felvidék). In AD. 796, in Aachen, the Tudum
was baptized a Christian.[53]
The remaining Avars still continued to fight the Franks and they
defeated Gerold, the brother-in-law of Charlemagne, and Eric of
Friaul. In A.D. 804, the Avars lost hope because the Bohemians also
began to fight them. Therefore, the new Kagan, Todor, in Quierzy,
asked Charlemagne to give him a settlement place between
Szombathely and Deutsch-Altenburg, and Charlemagne granted his
request. Soon after that, the Kagan Todor died and Charlemagne
assured his heir, Abraham, of the title. In so doing, he put an end to
the Bohemian aggression against the Avars.[54] Now both the
Tudum and the Kagan were Christian and they made peace with
each other. Unfortunately, the Slavs caused the Tudum a great deal
of trouble. In 811, Charlemagne himself tried to smooth out the
troubles between the Slav leaders and the Avar leaders.[55]
The Avar Empire continued to exist in two areas. One was, with the



acknowledgement of Charlemagne, under the rule of the Kagan,
beside Lake Fertő and the other, under the rule of the Tudum, in the
County of Nyitra. The chronicles still mentioned the territory beside
Lake Fertő in A.D. 873. The other territory, in Felvidék, under the rule
of the Tudum, although it was not mentioned in the chronicles, still
existed in A.D. 896 at the time the Magyars returned to the
Carpathian Basin with Árpád.
The chronicles do not mention the country of the Tudum in
Felvidék by name but it is clear from the provisions in the laws that it
still existed. According to Theophilactus,[56] there was a law which
ordered that "clausura" (bartiers or obstacles) be built at the sites of
fords by which the Huns/ Avars could leave their territory. The
Magyar Chronicles called these obstacles, which were man-made,
"kluza". They were intended to prevent the free passage of
undesirable elements. These "undesirable" people, according to the
chronicles were the Huns, Avars, "Ungari" or "Hungari". At that time
the Huns and Avars had been given a bad name and nobody wanted
to associate themselves with that name.
In A.D.796, when the Tudum was baptized a Christian, he vowed
to be a vassal of Charlemagne's. However, he did not keep his vow
because during the struggles in Transdanubia he went to the aid of
his countrymen against the Franks and later surrendered to Pepin.
[57] In A.D. 799, on the side of the Saxons, he again attacked the
Emperor but he was pushed back north into Felvidék. In A.D. 803, he
surrendered for the last time and went to Regensburg to pay homage
to Charlemagne.[58] The Emperor pardoned him but encircled the
Tudum's territory with a deep, wide ditch.
According to maps drawn at that time, there were only two roads
leading out of the territory of the Avars, one to the north and one to
the south. At the northern pass a village called Kolos (Hradistya) and



at the southern pass a village called Nyitra-Kolos developed. The
name "Kolos" is derived from the older word "kluza" (Latin: clausura).
The German Emperor Arnulf later destroyed the barriers in about
A.D. 890 because he needed the help of the Avar/Magyars against
the Slavs. This must have been the place in which the people of the
Tudum remained until the Magyars returned to their homeland with
Árpád. From time to time, the chronicles call these people Magyars.
Vidukindus, a monk living in the tenth century, expressed the opinion
of his time when he said: "The Avars are the remains of the Huns and
we now call these Avars Magyars."[59] There are at least five
instances when tenth century historians called the Magyars
Parthians.[60] I could list many more sources, which describe the
military manoevers which took place before A.D. 896 and which call
these people Magyars but space does not allow. The important
observation here is that the Magyars were in the Carpathian Basin
continuously from the time of Atilla. The book of the Monastery of
Saint Wandregisilius, in the year A.D. 877 notes that, at the time of
the fall of the Frankish Empire in A.D.843, King Louis received the
country of the Huns, Avars or Magyars.
We can see that the Avar Empire was not annihilated as Einhard
stated. As we know, there were two Avar territories. One was the
territory of the Kagan Todor, in Transdanubia, circa A.D. 804, whose
position was strengthened by Charlemagne. Moreover, at his death,
Charlemagne assured Todor's heir, Abraham, of his position as
Kagan. Abraham's biblical name proves that he was a Christian. The
other Avar territory in the County of Nyitra, in Felvidék, was ruled by
the Tudum. It appears that the Avar Empire was split into two parts
because of the Tudum's actions but it ceased to exist only after both
leaders became Christian and it lost its political role. At that time,
when a country became Christian it relinquished its power to the
Holy Roman Emperor. The fall of the Avar Empire was caused by its



adoption of Christianity. It was important for the West to convert the
Avars to Christianity so that they could thereby obtain the political
power over them and collect the tithe from them. Unfortunately, in
the past, Christianity was only a means to reach these goals.

THE HOMELAND RECLAIMED
Chapter 4.
The Huns
History records that the Huns suddenly appeared in the fifth
century A.D. "out of the shadows" and there is no knowledge of their
past. Even in the Magyar Chronicles, other than a few notes about
the ancestors of Atilla, there is hardly any mention of them.
However, the eighteenth century missionaries to China had an
opportunity to study Chinese history and make notes. Herbelot,
Klapproth and Brouset and more recently De Groot and Chavannes
have studied these notes and made available to us numerous
resources which give us much more information about the Huns.



Among the Chinese sources the Si-Ki records are the richest. Sze
Ma-csen, who lived between 145 B.C. and 87 B.C., was the writer of
these notes about the Huns, which fill more than two hundred
volumes. The fact that these notes are in accord with the few notes
about the Huns in the Magyar Chronicles is proof that they are
historically correct. There is a great distance, chronologically and
geographically, between the two.
Using the information from the above-mentioned missionaries and
the Chinese Annals, Benedek Baráthosi-Balogh wrote a very
complete book about the Huns- A Hunok Három Világ Birodalma.[1]
The Chinese Annals record that the Huns, in ancient times, did
not form a united nation but lived in many different tribal units.
Hoang-Ti "The Emperor of the World", in about 2400 B.C. already
mentioned the Hun people but called them by different names like
Hi-Un-Nu, Hein-jun, Hiung-No, Hsiung-Nu and Dsongo. In time, the
Dsongo Huns became known as the Csángo and they later settled in
the area of Transylvania that is still called Csángo. Historians and
linguists have tried for centuries to understand the meaning of the
name Csángo. The Csángo dialect has the most ancient elements of
the Magyar language and their folk tales are the most ancient of the
Magyar folk tales. It is a well-known fact that the Csángo and Szekel
people of Transylvania believe that they are direct descendants of
the Huns and this was acknowledged in Greater Hungary by their
tax-exempt status. It is possible that they are not the descendants of
Atilla's Huns but of an earlier influx of Huns, such as the Western
Huns. The explanation that the name Csángo is derived from the
Magyar word "csángál" which means "wanders aimlessly away"
appears to be without foundation, since it is unlikely that a people
would describe itself in this fashion.
Emperor Szun wrote that, in the 24th and 23rd centuries B.C., he



went five thousand "li" west of China and conquered the Dsongo,
Saca, Tik Huns and Kiongo Huns. In the north he conquered the
mountain Dsongo Huns. Emperor Ju conquered the Kienlien people,
the Saca, Kussu, and the Western Dsongo Huns. Later Chinese
sources have clarified that the Kussu people mentioned in earlier
chronicles were the Ugor people. Already by the 23rd. century B.C.,
there were four major peoples among the Huns - the Dsongo, Saca,
Ugor and Kiang peoples.
Emperor Hi-Fu, in 2350 B.C., acknowledged that refugees who
arrived from the land of Seennar (Mesopotamia) built irrigation
canals in China. Drs. Douglas and Jenks discuss the similarities
between the canals in China and Sumer, the similarities between
their sciences of astronomy and medicine. They also mention that
Emperor Yao (2085-2005) gave an audience to twelve shepherd
princes from Susa.[2] As these people migrated from Mesopotamia
to China they passed through the land that is presently called Tibet.
In their language the name Tibet was TO-BO-TAJ. In Sumerian and in
the Hungarian language, TO means "foot of the mountain", BO
means "large panorama" and TAJ means "territory". The people who
lived here until A.D. 612, were called the TO-BO-TAJ people. In A.D.
612, the Kun (Cumanian) prince married the princess of China. From
this time on, these people were suppressed by the Chinese and
Cumanian peoples.[3] I will name a few of the Tibetan kings whose
names are identical to Sumerian, Scythian, Hun, Sabir and Magyar
names and also geographical names. King names: Kos, Lato, Tori,
Palkor, Nyatri, Csogyal. Mountain names: Kun, Tar, Must, Korum,
Jura, Gura. Lake names: Manas Sarovar, Leh, Kara, Korum. Tibetan
counties: Szech, Kan, Kagyu, Sima, Ladag, Urga, Nyurga, and
Bartok. Family names: Shatra, Tompa, Sur, Gyali, Csap, Punk, Pala,
Rampa.[4]
In the third millennium B.C., the Chinese were located south and



southeast of the big elbow of the Hoang-ho River (the Yellow River).
The territory south of the Chinese may have been very sparsely
populated because they were never involved in a war to the south.
East of the Chinese, near the ocean shore, there were very weak
tribes who were soon assimilated into the Chinese people. Strong
Hun tribes were living to the west and north of the Chinese. The
Chinese were an agricultural people while these people, whom the
Chinese later called Huns, had a nomadic lifestyle and were
occupied with animal husbandry. From the beginning of the Hia
Dynasty (1766 B.C.) there are regular historical records of the Huns.
In early Chinese history, the Tik Huns were the strongest enemy of
the Chinese. The Sang kings established principalities to defend
their territories from these people. Historians have come to the
conclusion that it was the struggle between the Huns and the
Chinese that caused the Chinese to unite. The Dsongo Huns, the
Hunik and the Kienun, first appeared as enemies of China but later
became allies and helped Emperor Ven to the throne. Ven was the
first Emperor to unite the Chinese but he committed a fatal error by
dividing the Chinese territory among his generals, making them
vassals. During this feudal rule China lost its strength. In 850 B.C., as
a result of an inside struggle, the Huns broke into the border states
of China. From this time on, the Huns settled in large numbers in the
Chinese territories, which they had conquered. They taught the
Chinese their military tactics and they slowly became assimilated
into the Chinese people. In this way, they strengthened the Chinese
populace and tipped the scale in favor of the Chinese. Huns fought
against Huns.
However, about two hundred years later, the Huns regained their
power and the whole of China became close to becoming a vassal of
the Huns. China came to the conclusion that she had to defend
herself against the Huns with castles and walls. At this critical time,



the Chinese were ruled by an outstanding emperor, maybe even the
greatest emperor, Mu, who was famous for his wisdom. When the
occasion arose, the king of the Dsongo Huns sent his most trusted
man, Jin Hu, who happened to be Chinese, to Emperor Mu to find
out what the Emperor was really like and what to expect from him.
The Emperor showed him his cities and castles, explained the
Chinese laws to him and told him that in spite of all this apparent
order, there was constant turmoil in the nation. He asked what was
the reason that the Huns had no inside struggles. Jin Hu answered
that the Chinese had written laws but the laws, camouflaged as
justice and goodness, were used to exploit the people. The situation
with the Huns was the reverse. The Hun leaders tried their best to be
humane and righteous. They always wanted the best for their
people. As a result the people were loyal to their leaders and had
sincere respect for them. When Emperor Mu heard that, he became
alarmed and decided that he would not let Jin Hu return to the Huns
because he would be a threat to China since he was so wise. The
Emperor made him a loyal follower and Jin Hu then suggested that
Mu send Chinese musicians and women singers to the court of the
Hun king in order to corrupt the King. If he learned to like music and
women, dissention would arise between him and his ministers and
the Hun superiority could be weakened. Emperor Mu took the advice
of Jin Hu and soon after that he was able to defeat the King of the
Dsongo Huns and confiscate twelve countries from him. The
Chinese Annals talk of twelve countries, but they probably mean
twelve territorial possessions. In 600 BC., Emperor Mu caused the
Red Huns and the White Huns to fight each other. The Chinese
recognized five compass points, each represented by a color. Black
was the color of North. West was white, South red, and East was
blue. Yellow was the color of the center of the compass. The
Western Huns or Ephthalita probably received their name from this.
They are often called the White Huns.[5]



The Chinese believe that Emperor Mu was born a Hun. He was the
founder of the Chin Dynasty in 676 B.C. Emperor Mu introduced new
burial customs to China, the Scythian/Hun burial customs. At the
funeral of a deceased Emperor, his loyal men and his servants had to
be buried with him. At the death of Mu, in 621 B.C., almost two
hundred men were buried with him. This custom was continued until
401 B.C.
In 617 B.C. a new Hun tribe among the Tik Huns, the Szoba,
appeared in this territory. The Chinese Annals write that the Szoba
Tiks broke into China. Nations and countries received their names
from their location and from the major occupation of the people. I
would venture to suggest that the Szoba Huns built houses with
rooms since their name "Szoba" in the Magyar language means
"room" or "house" just as the Avars were later called Vár-Kuns
because they built castles. (Hungarian "vár" means castle.)
In about 525 B.C., several Hun tribes appeared as a factor in
Chinese history. Such tribes were the Tali and Giku tribes. In the
fourth century B.C., the Chinese started to build the Great Wall of
China. The viceroy, Vuling, came to the conclusion that with infantry
and carriages, the Chinese could not fight successfully against the
Hun cavalry. He adopted the Hun customs and military tactics. He
visited the Hun leaders and asked for their alliance, which he
received. His goal was to obtain absolute rule over China. For this
purpose, he abdicated in favor of his son and obtained for himself
the position of commander-in-chief of the allied forces. His plan
however did not succeed. After his death, the Hun alliance broke up.
Benedek Baráthosi-Balogh writes that, from the time of the rule of
Vuling, the Chinese Annals always call the Huns "Hungno" or
"Hunno". Probably, while visiting the Hun kings to ask for their
alliance, Vuling learned their actual name.



Benedek Baráthosi-Balogh points out that the pronunciation of
the ancient Chinese suffix "no" was "nor". Therefore the Chinese
pronounced the Hun name "Hunor", just as it is written in the legend
of the White Stag, which tells us that the Huns and the Magyars are
descended from the sons of Nimrod, Hunor and Magor.
Emperor Vuling intended to unite China under his rule. Emperor
Si-Hoang-Ti continued this policy. In 238 B.C. after he had
succeeded in suppressing the inside revolts, he concentrated on
fighting the Huns. Si-Hoang-Ti hated the Huns so much that he
ordered the name of the Huns, Hunno, to be abbreviated to "Hu", so
that their name would not be longer than the name of his empire.
The Emperor heard a prophecy, which predicted that the "Hu" would
overpower him. To prevent this, he attacked the neighboring Huns
with 300,000 men and conquered them, confiscating their territory.
In China, he built walls around forty-one cities. He built new roads
and renovated the old ones. Si-Hoang-Ti made the completion of the
construction of the Great Wall a project in which everyone was
forced to participate. He took hundreds of thousands of prisoners of
war to help in the construction of the Wall, which took ten years to
complete. One million people were constantly employed in this
project and half a million died as a result of this labor. Their corpses
were buried in the Wall.
Attacked by the Chinese, the Huns retreated to the territory of the
Hoang Ho river (the Yellow River) and the individual tribes ceased
their attacks on China. Everywhere, in the Hun territory, the "tanhu"
or "senyő", that is the Emperor of the Huns, took over the command
of all the Hun tribes. In the case of danger, the individual tribal
leaders united under one leader, the Senyő, as did the Magyars in
later years.
The title "Senyő" evolved into the name of a tribe and later into the



personal name of a leader, which is written in the Chinese annals as
LAUNTHE. This name can be found in the genealogy of Atilla and
Árpád. The later Greek sources write it as HILIENTHE which is the
probable origin of the later Magyar name Levente. Among the
Magyars this appears as a personal name rather than as a tribal
name or a title. Árpád's eldest son's name was Levente. This
evolution to a personal name is similar to that of the name Zoltán
that originally was "zoltán" meaning a messenger (e.g. Zoltán
Kodály).
Benedek Baráthosi-Balogh states that the unification of the Hun
tribes so strengthened the Hun nation that the very existence of the
Chinese was in jeopardy.[6] We do not know for sure who was the
first Hun "senyő" or "tanhu" because the Chinese Annals mention
only "the great Hun kings" who live "far to the north" and do not
mention their names. The first leader that they mention by name was
Toban. We do not know when he started his reign but in 219 B.C. he
was mentioned as the absolute ruler of the Huns. The Annals
mention many of his wars. When he was defeated by the Chinese, he
started to extend his territory towards the West. It was the Senyő
Toban who created the first united Hun empire, but we will see that
his son Mo-tun (Bátor) raised the Hun Empire to almost unbelievable
heights. Before I explain how he did this, I will describe the tragedy
of the Senyő Toban.
The Huns introduced the custom of polygamy in order to ensure
the nation of descendants because they lost so much of their
populace in the constant warring campaigns. This was the first and
most important reason for the custom of polygamy. Another reason
was the protection of the family of a warrior who died in battle. The
deceased warrior's closest brother automatically received the
responsibility of protecting the warrior's widow and children. This
was a social arrangement, which was a widespread custom. The



Chinese Annals relate the following story:
The eldest son of Senyő Toban was Mo-tun. Toban's second son
was his favorite. Toban intended to move Mo-tun out of the way so
that the second son could inherit the empire. To accomplish his goal,
the Senyő sent Mo-tun to the King of Aszi as a guarantor for peace.
While Mo-tun was there, Toban suddenly attacked the King of Aszi,
whereupon Aszi expressed his intention to kill Mo-tun. However Mo
tun managed to escape and ride home on a very fast steed. Toban,
acknowledged Mo-tun's bravery and authorized him to be the leader
of more than ten thousand soldiers. Toban believed that this honor
would satisfy Mo-tun and make up for the decision to remove him.
Mo-tun was not appeased. He quietly prepared himself to regain his
rightful heritage.
He used whistling arrows and commanded his men during archery
practice to aim together at the object that he had marked with his
whistling arrow. Anyone who refused to obey the command was
beheaded. At one archery practice, Mo-tun aimed a whistling arrow
at his most splendid steed. He immediately beheaded those who
were afraid to shoot. Soon after, he did the same thing with his
favorite wife. At that time, some of his men were afraid to shoot and
they were also beheaded. Later on, during the hunt, he aimed a
whistling arrow at the ornamented steed of the Emperor. His entire
escort simultaneously shot at the horse. He could see then that he
could trust them completely. After that, he went hunting with his
father, Senyő Toban and aimed a whistling arrow at his father who
died when all the escort followed suit. Mo-tun ordered his
stepmother, together with her son, the favorite son of the Senyő, to
be killed because she had caused the Senyő to plot against him. He
also ordered the execution of any minister who refused to obey him.
Then he made himself Senyő.



The Huns pardoned this crime of Mo-tun's because his deeds, as
Emperor, made the Hun Empire unbelievably powerful. The
pronunciation of the name Mo-tun is not clear but Sinologists have
recently accepted the pronunciation as Bogatur or Bátur. Mo-tun
(Bátor) was the greatest figure in Hun history. Only Atilla's deeds are
equal to Bátor's. "Bátor" in Magyar means brave".)
Bátor established the great, powerful, Hun World Empire of
Central Asia. At the beginning of his reign, he did not have to be
concerned about Chinese attacks because the Chinese were
occupied with their own inner struggles. The territories to the east
and west of Bátor's empire were settled by other Hun nations. To the
east was the Empire of the Tung-hu (Eastern Huns), which extended
from Manchuria to North Korea. Between the Hun Empire and the
Tung-hu Empire was the unpopulated Gobi desert. It was a custom
of the Turanians, wherever possible, to surround their territory with
an unpopulated territory. (The Magyars also used this custom when
they reclaimed their homeland in the Carpathian Basin in A.D. 896. It
was also the medieval defense system.) Bátor knew that, although
they were separated from him by a four hundred kilometer wide
desert, the Tung-hu were his most dangerous neighbors. For an
equestrian people the distance was not an obstacle.
The Chinese Annals relate a story about Bátor and the Tung-hu.
They relate that when the Tung-hu learned that Bátor had killed his
own father, the Emperor, they sent a messenger to him. They
demanded a horse that had belonged to his father, Toban, which was
able to run a thousand "li" without a rest. Bátor called his ministers to
ask their advice and they announced that this horse was too valuable
to give to the Tung-hu. However Bátor retorted: "Should I honor a
horse more than a neighboring state?" and he gave the steed to the
Tung-hu. The Tung-hu interpreted this gesture to mean that Bátor
was afraid of them and they sent another message demanding his



wife. Emperor Bátor again called his ministers to ask their advice and
they angrily shouted that the Tung-hu had no honor if they
demanded the wife of the Emperor. They called for an attack on the
Tung-hu. Bátor responded: "Should I honor a woman more than a
neighboring state?" and he sent his wife to the Tung-hu. The king of
the Tung-hu became more arrogant and invaded the territory
between his land and Bátor's. The Tung-hu, sent another message to
Bátor, that this unpopulated territory was situated so far from the
capital that the Emperor was hardly able to reach it, so the king of
the Tung-hu claimed it for himself. When Bátor asked his ministers
for their advice about this unpopulated territory, some advised him
to give it to the Tung-hu. Báitor flew into a rage and shouted: "You
want me to give this land, the foundation of our empire, to these
people?" He ordered the execution of all those ministers who had
given this advice.[7]
Bátor attacked the Tung-hu, who were unprepared since they had
considered him to be a weakling. He subjugated them and extended
his border to the ocean. In the south, he re-conquered from the
Chinese a territory that had been formerly populated by Huns. He
broke through the Great Wall of China and re-conquered the
territories that were occupied by Huns who had become assimilated
into the Chinese populace. The Annals mention that Bátor had more
than three-hundred thousand archers on horseback. These archers
were Huns, related to the Scythians, whose archers could shoot
twenty arrows a minute.
Senyő Bátor conquered five Hun territories. After these
conquests, he was acknowledged as the Senyő of all the Huns. The
Hun Empire of Bátor included the entire Turanian Basin from the
Caspian Sea to the Ural Mountains. The Chinese Emperor Kao
attacked Bátor with 320,000 men. Bátor tricked him by seemingly
retreating and caused the Chinese to follow him into the extremely



cold territory of the North. Before the entire Chinese army was
assembled, he counter-attacked the Chinese Emperor, Kao. He was
victorious but we do not know why he spared the Emperor and his
defeated troops. The Chinese Annals do not state the fact but it is
obvious that from this time on, 200 B.C., the Chinese became
vassals to the Huns. There are a few letters remaining from Emperor
Bátor to the Empress of China, who was later widowed, and her
letters to him in reply. From her letters, we find out that the Senyő
Bátor, conquered twenty-six more neighboring countries, thus
unifying all the peoples who used bows and arrows and they became
Huns.
Bátor accomplished the reorganization of his empire. From among
his sons and brothers, he appointed four viceroys to rule over four
territories in the four directions of the compass. The Annals mention
that these viceroys were called left and right "hien" kings, and left
and right "kokle" kings. Apart from these four kings, there were six
more kings ruling over the six corners of the empire. These six were
called the left and right "dsitok" kings, "unguthe" and "cienciang"
kings. According to the Hun beliefs, the left side of the body is more
important. So among all the viceroys, the left side kings, or "hien"
kings were next in importance to Bátor. Most often the heir to the
throne held this title.
If the Huns had a preference for the left side, and the Magyars
believe that they are related to the Huns, then this preference has to
be reflected in the customs of the Magyars. In the earlier-mentioned
frontispiece of the Képes Kronika, the leaders of the country were
pictured with Árpád, with the most important personages to his left.
Here we should mention an interesting connection. Because
certain information, data or facts were not written or were lost in the
course of history, the small mosaic pieces of the past must be found



and put together. One such mosaic piece is the custom of giving
more importance to the "left side" of the hierarchy, as was
mentioned in the Chinese Annals. This ancient custom probably
originated from a religious belief. Dr. Sándor Nagy states that the
worship of the god Bál, Baal or Bél was so widespread and fervent
before Christianity among the ancient populace of the Carpathian
Basin that in the territory of present day Hungary alone, fifty-eight
geographical names begin with the prefix "Bál" or "Bél" e.g. the
village of Bálványos, Beled, Bélmura, Bakony-Bél, and Lake Balaton
(Balaton means "the lake of the god Baal".[8] The ancient people
honored and worshipped the god Baal so fervently that they named
the left side of the body, where the heart and the feeling of love is
located, after their god. "Left" in Magyar is "bal". More importance
was given to the left side of the body. It is easy to see that this
custom originated from religious beliefs. It has continued in the
Carpathian Basin throughout the ages and is obvious in the burial
customs of Árpád's Magyars.
Gyula Lász1ó's recent excavation of numerous Magyar graves of
the tenth century revealed that the custom of placing the more
important personages to the left of the leader was widespread. The
dead always looked toward the east, the direction of the sunrise,
waiting for their resurrection. To the left of the most important grave,
the graves were richer than those to its right. The number of
projectile points and ornamented articles indicated the rank of the
deceased. Women were always buried to the right of the leader.
After Bátor's death, in about 174 B.C., his son, Kiok, still led
successful campaigns but during the reign of Kiok's heir, Losang, the
Hun influence began to decline. In 147 B.C. the five Hun kings who
had become vassals of Bátor, left the Huns and allied themselves
with China. Vei-ching, the Chinese Emperor of the Han dynasty,
learned the military tactics of the Huns or Hunors. In the spring of



124 B.C., he broke into the Hun Empire with 30,000 men. Another
two regiments attacked from the north. The Hien king of the right
side was not prepared for the attack because he was expecting the
arrival of the Chinese only a few days later. Vei-ching, during the
night, encircled the sleeping Huns. The Hun king was able to break
through the encircling Chinese but his entire army was annihilated.
Year after year, newer and newer campaigns were launched from
both sides. Slowly the Huns lost their dominance. De Groot writes
that China at that time did not regard the Huns as uncivilized
barbarians. On the contrary, those Huns who went over to the
Chinese side received the full trust of the Emperor and received high
rank and positions. Many aristocratic Hun families settled into China
and received the rights of Chinese citizens.[9] The Chinese trusted
them so much that they appointed them to be border guards.
In A.D. 68, Senyő Ajente died. His younger brother, Hilikuanko,
according to Hun traditions, married his widow, who was until that
time the "first lady". Hilikuanko took this title away from her and gave
it to his first wife. The former empress was hurt and took revenge.
She convinced the kings of two Hun territories, Kuszu and Bor, to
rebel and join the Chinese. Hilikuanko, during his short life, did a lot
to reinstate the hegemony of the Huns but he was poisoned. He was
the last ruler who could have done something to reinstate the power
of the Huns.
The Chinese caused ongoing struggles within the Hun Empire by
supporting an upstart Senyő. Unable to defeat the Huns by military
means, the Chinese, by causing these fratricidal wars, weakened the
Hun Empire. In about A.D. 44, the Chinese of the Han Dynasty and
the Eastern Huns made a blood union. The Chinese delegation and
the Senyő went up to the top of a mountain where they slaughtered
a white horse. They mixed the blood of the white horse with wine
and they all drank of the mixture from the same cup. Then the



Eastern Huns left their territory on the borderline of China and
resettled further to the west where they regained their power. They
made an alliance with the king of Khong-Ki and together they
conquered Osun. The rest of the smaller kingdoms in that area
united with them voluntarily. At this time, the Emperor of the Huns
became the only ruler of the whole of Central Asia.
There was a conspiracy in the country of Khong-Ki against the
Hun Senyő Csitki and his empire. This conspiracy must have been
very serious because, when he discovered it, the Senyő executed his
wife who was the daughter of Khong-Ki. China became jealous of the
power of Csitki in Central Asia, and again used formerly successful
maneuvers to weaken the Huns. The Chinese Emperor influenced all
the kings who were vassals of Csitki to join in a unified uprising
against Csitki. Fifteen countries launched an attack from the north
and from the south and were joined by a Chinese army from
Turkestan. This action was so skillfully accomplished that Csitki did
not even suspect that it was planned. He had only a few thousand
men in his castle when he was attacked. He had no choice but to
fight to the end. This became the greatest epic in the history of the
Eastern Huns, according to the Chinese annals. Csitki flew the five
colored flag from his castle, which signified that he was the Senyő of
the Huns and the Lord of the World. A small cavalry tried to break
out of the castle, and attack the 60,000 men surrounding it. They
were beaten back but, during the night, they made another attempt,
in vain. In defending the castle Hun women were fighting alongside
Hun men. The little group had to give up the outer walls of the castle
and retreat into the keep, where they fought to the end, burning the
castle around them. Csitki fought valiantly and, although covered
with blood, he attacked the incoming enemy. A Chinese officer cut
off the head of the Senyő. The last independent Senyő of the Eastern
Huns met an honorable death.



The Chinese annals record that there were 1518 Hun deaths and
145 prisoners from about 3000 people in the castle. The annals do
not mention that the unified armies killed more people than were
recorded, nor do they mention that they annihilated the Hun
populace, although it was a Chinese custom to boast about how
many people were killed in battles. The Chinese warrior had to give
the exact count of how many of the enemy he killed, or else he would
lose his head. This would lead us to believe that the majority of the
populace of the Huns survived. Only the personal bodyguard of
Csitki, the people in the castle, were killed or captured. If the
populace survived then they must have fled in a direction where
there were no enemies. The countries of Tavan and Assun were
enemies of the Eastern Huns, so they could not flee to the east. The
country of Assun had 188,000 soldiers. Tavan had 60,000. Khon-Ki
closed the route to freedom with 120,000 men. On the territory of
the Aral Sea, was located the enemy nation, the Hops, in the
northeast direction, the KiuKuns, and in the north the Tinglins. Only
one route was open for escape, the Baks Creek, which led into the
Steppes, into Baskiria, where the Ugor-Magyars were living.[10]
This fact is very important for the clarification of the Hun-Magyar
relationship. All contemporary writers called these people Scythians,
Huns, Avars, Parthians and Magyars, interchangeably. That was not
disputed until 1849 when the Magyars were declared to be a Finno
Ugric people, and their relationship to the Huns was denied. The
Árpád Magyars, in A.D. 896, came into the Carpathian Basin as Hun
Magyars, to reclaim their homeland. The Hungarian legend of the
Enchanted Stag tells us that the Huns and the Magyars were brother
nations. Maybe this is why the Huns of Csitki found refuge with the
Ugor-Magyars where they lived together for several centuries,
learning each other's customs. One hundred and twenty-six years
later, another group of the Eastern Huns, those who had been left



behind when Csitki's Huns fled into Baskiria, decided to take the
same route to join the Ugor-Magyars and the Huns and they settled
into the Irtish-Ural territory. This combined group of Huns and
Magyars became known as the Western Huns.
In A.D. 104, the Western Huns conquered Kis Bukharia. It was this
territory of Kis Bukharia which Sándor Kőrősi-Csoma, the famous
writer of the Tibetan Dictionary, named in his will as the territory
which later researchers should investigate for the possible origin of
the Magyars. Presently, Dr. Miklós Érdy and Dr. István Kiszely are
trying to prove that the Magyars originated from the Uighurs who
lived in Kis Bukharia (Dzungaria) but it is obvious that the Huns and
Ugor-Magyars conquered these people and settled among them. In
A.D. 120, the Western Huns unified under their rule the territory
between the Lop Lake and the Caspian Sea. In A.D. 261, the Sienpi
people forced the Huns to move out of the territory that they
occupied. They were unable to move to the south because the
strong Persian Empire blocked their way. Baskiria was not large
enough to support them, so they were forced to move to the territory
north of the Caspian Sea where the Alans were living. The legend
mentions that Hunor and Magor married the daughters of King Dul of
the Alans. From this time on, the Chinese Annals do not mention the
Huns but we can follow them in the European sources.
Most modern western historians take their knowledge from the
Roman historians. Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen has written a
comprehensive study of the Huns, which corrects many of the
misconceptions handed down throughout history.[11] He says that
Claudian and Jordanes echoed Ammianus Marcellinus when they
called the Huns "the most infamous offspring of the north" "fiercer
than ferocity itself". They said: "They were a faceless mass, terrible
and subhuman." Otto Maenchen-Helfen says: "Ammianus'
description is distorted by hatred and fear."[12] J.O. Thompson



believes almost every word of it and places the Huns of the latter half
of the fourth century in the "lower stages of pastoralism". They lived,
he says, "in desperate hardship, moving incessantly from pasture to
pasture, utterly absorbed by the day-long task of looking after the
herds. Their iron swords must have been obtained by barter or
capture, for nomads do not work metal."[13]
Otto Maenchen-Helfen disputes this view concluding that if the
Huns had not been able to forge swords and cast arrowheads "they
never would have crossed the Don." "The idea that Hun horsemen
fought their way to the walls of Constantinople and to the Marne with
bartered and captured swords is absurd. Hun warfare presupposed a
far-reaching division of labor in peacetime."[14]
Thompson stated that the Huns could not weave because they
had no time for it. Maenchen-Helfen points out that in the Sarmatian
(Hun) graves: "many hundreds of spin-whorls have been found made
of stone, alabaster and cut from the bottom of clay vessels." The
Huns spun the wool of their sheep and also made linen. Ammianus
speaks of their linen clothes and the fact that they had all kinds of
domesticated animals.[15] Priscus Rhetor, a Roman historian, was
sent by the Roman government with a message to Atilla in A.D.448.
He described the woolen mats in the house of Atilla's wife and the
handmaidens embroidering linen cloths. He wrote that Atilla slept on
a bed covered with linen sheets.[16]
Claudian and Ammianus denied that the Huns practiced
agriculture. Maenchen-Helfen says that they did so and quotes
several sources for this information - Sinitsyn, 1960, Stilor, 1959,
Csallány, 1961, who found sickles, corn grinders and hoes in their
graves.[17] Ammianus said "...the Huns are never protected by any
building...not even a hut thatched with reeds." Maenchen-Helfen
contradicts this statement: "In South Russia, the Huns had no



permanent dwellings but they certainly had shelters, tents of felt and
sheepskin, materials which probably most of them were still using
after they had settled in the Hungarian plains."[18] These felt tents or
yurts are quite comfortable, spacious, well-aired and easily kept
clean. They are still used today as dwellings by many people in
Central Asia and China.[19] By the middle of the fifth century, the
Hun nobles had houses in villages. "Attila's 'palace' consisted of a
single square or rectangular room, furnished with seats and a bed or
couch, screened off at one end of the room by tapestries."[20]
Priscus Rhetor described Atilla's residence: "It was made of polished
boards, and surrounded with wooden enclosures." He mentioned
that not far from the house was a large bath built by Onegesius "who
was second in power among the Scythians".[21]
Western historians represent Atilla as a barbarian but the Magyar
Chronicles describe him as a humanitarian, just and merciful ruler.
György Zászlos-Zsóka states that Atilla never annihilated a nation
entirely as did the Romans when they overcame the Carthaginians
and the Etruscans.[22] Atilla listened to the pleas of Saint Genevieve
and spared Paris. He spared Rome at the pleading of Pope Leo.
Otto Maenchen-Helfen describes Atilla as unpretentious and
liking simplicity: "Attila wore neither a diadem nor a crown; his dress
was plain; his sword, the clasps of his shoes and the bridle of his
horse were not, like those of the Hunnic nobles, adorned with gold
and gems. He drank from a wooden goblet and ate from a wooden
plate."[23] Priscus Rhetor describes a meal at Atilla's table: "The
cupbearers gave us a cup, according to the national custom, that we
might pray before we sat down." "A luxurious meal, served on silver
plate, had been made ready for us and the barbarian guests, but
Attila ate nothing but meat on a wooden trencher. In everything else,
too, he showed himself temperate; his cup was made of wood, while
to the guests were given goblets of gold and silver. His dress, too,



was quite simple, affecting only to be clean. The sword he carried at
his side, the latchets of his Scythian shoes, the bridle of his horse
were not adorned, like those of the other Scythians, with gold or
gems or anything costly."[24] Priscus was surprised that the Huns
were able to speak several languages: "I was amazed that a Scythian
spoke Greek. The Scythians are a colorful mixture of people. They
generally speak, beside their mother-tongue, the Gothic and Latin
languages."[25]
More recently, Wess Roberts, writing of Atilla says: "Attila was less
savage than the Romans, who cast thousands of Christians to wild
animals for mere entertainment. In comparison, he was less cruel
than Ivan the Terrible, Cortes or Pizarro." He goes on to say: "In his
sparing of Rome, he showed more mercy than did Denserich, Belizar,
the Norsemen, the Germans and the Spanish mercenaries who all
pillaged it without regard."[26]
Again, Roberts says: "Attila's legacy is generally unfamiliar to us in
the Western World. We are naïve about his historical importance as a
genius civilizer, his open-mindedness and richness of views, in all of
which he far exceeded Alexander the Great or Caesar." [27]
The physical description of the Huns as sub-human monsters,
found in the writings of Ammianus and Jordanes reflects their
intense hatred of their enemies. The Germans and Italians, enemies
of the Magyars, called them "a monstrous nation, a horrid tribe, a
tribe more cruel than a wild beast." In the Chinese Annals, the Huns
are described as tall, with light brown hair, suntanned skin and large
noses. Of course, this is from the standpoint of another culture. Otto
of Friesing called the Magyars monsters "but Gardisi, a disinterested
observer, called the Magyars handsome and pleasant-looking."[28]
Dr. István Kiszely, an anthropologist who excavated two Hun



cemeteries in Central Asia, found that the contents of the graves
were identical to those of Scythian graves. He researched the Hun
Empire, which existed during the period between the fourth century
B.C., and A.D. 91. So far there have been no Hun cemeteries found in
Hungary and anthropologists have surmised from this that the Huns
cremated their dead. However, in Central Asia, the Huns did not
cremate their dead and it is not likely that, when they returned to the
Carpathian Basin with Atilla, their customs changed. It was reported
that no Hun graves were found in the Carpathian Basin but, in that
territory, Hun graves were labeled Sarmatian graves. According to
the anthropological data, the Sarmatian graves in the Carpathian
Basin are totally identical to the Hun graves in Central Asia.
Therefore, we can state that the Carpathian Basin "Sarmatians" were
actually Huns. Otto Maenchen-Helfen states that the pottery,
agriculture, costumes and dwellings of the Huns were similar to
those of the Sarmatians.[29] The anthropological material unearthed
in Mongolia indicates that Huns lived there before the Mongols. The
Huns were city dwellers at that time and they were identical to the
Western or Ephthalita Huns who, in A.D. 568, as Avars, entered the
Carpathian Basin. Anthropologically speaking we should not talk of a
first or second "conquest" of the Carpathian Basin. We should talk of
a continuous resettlement of the ancient people under different
names.
The religious beliefs of the Huns in Central Asia can be analyzed
from the 9000 rolls of parchment which were found by Aurel Stein in
cave churches of Central Asia, especially those found in the cave
church designated as No. 15. In these parchment rolls nineteen tribe
names can be linked to Scythian names. In 1957, the Hungarian
Academy of Science received the 9000 rolls of parchment, which
they have not yet studied. However, the study of these parchments
could be a decisive factor in the determination of the origin of the



Magyars.

THE HOMELAND RECLAIMED
Chapter 5.
Scythian / Hun / Avar / Magyar Cultural Connections
According to Otto Maenchen-Helfen, the Latin Chroniclers of the
fifth century A.D. knew "next to nothing about the Scythians,
Cimmerians and Massagetae, whose names the Greek authors
constantly interchanged with that of the Huns."[1] He says that
Jerome identified Herodotus' Scythians with the Huns,[2] and he
himself identifies the Huns with the Royal Scythians.[3] Rolf Rolle
describes the Scythian costume, as depicted on a vessel found in
the Pazyrik graves in Siberia: "The long, braided tunics are of
embroidered, fur trimmed leather. Trousers, embroidered



lengthways, and soft ankle-length boots complete their outfit."[4]
The Hun shepherds wore a pointed sheepskin hat, sheepskin vest or
tunic and wide trousers and boots. According to Gyula László, the
Magyars of the time of Árpád wore a similar costume.[5]
The Scythian horseman trained his horse to kneel down. "This was
very important in battle as kneeling on command could mean the
difference between life and death for a fallen and heavily armed
warrior, relatively immobile on foot, who could save time getting
swiftly back on his kneeling horse." This was not a custom known to
the Greeks. If it had been "Xenophon would not have left us such
exquisite instructions on the mounting of a horse - by clutching the
mane or using the lance in a kind of pole-vault in order to catapault
onto the saddle. He lays particular emphasis on 'posture'. The
ancient writer warns that the rider might otherwise present 'an
indecent sight from behind' since trousers were unknown to the
Greeks."[6] The Scythians/ Huns/ Avars/Magyars all used saddles,
stirrups and horseshoes. The Roman army, even in the third century
A.D., went to war without those essential pieces of equipment, which
were introduced into Europe by the Germanic people, a thousand
years after the Huns.[7] The stirrup came into use in Europe around
A.D. 700. The acceptance of the use of the stirrup led a whole era
into Europe - the age of Chivalry, according to Viktor Padány.[8] At
this time the stirrup had been used by Turanian peoples, in particular
the Uz people, for 2500 years.
The tents of the Hun villages were on wheels and were artistically
created. These yurts were comfortable and warm and contained a
cooking stove and chairs. The Chinese adopted the Hun custom of
sitting on chairs. The Hun families had many children. The Scythian,
Hun and Magyar children rode on the backs of the sheep and
learned how to use the bow and arrow.[9] There were more women
around the tents than men. The women were partners to their



husbands and had a voice in decision-making. Hun women had more
rights than Chinese women. This is why the Chinese gave some of
their women to the Huns for wives. A few of the Chinese wives even
organized coups in the Hun history. The Huns had large numbers of
skilled workers to supply the hundreds of thousands of soldiers with
the equipment they needed, the saddles, stirrups, bits and bridles,
the bows and arrows, carriages and wheels etc. Their principal foods
were milk products and meat from the hunt. The Huns enjoyed their
fermented milk, "koumiss", and the Scythians and Magyars likewise.
They all had a custom of riding with a piece of meat under the
saddle. It has been commonly believed that they did this to soften
the meat and eat it raw, a custom attributed to barbarians. Who
would have thought that these "barbarians" knew that the raw meat
had healing properties, which eased the saddle sores on the mount's
back? Recently, an Englishman has been credited with the
"discovery" that raw meat heals the wounds on the backs of
racehorses.
In battle the Huns, Scythians and Magyars used the tactics of
repeated attack and retreat. The horsemen must have trained
rigorously and diligently to have been able to react obediently and
swiftly to the signals to attack and retreat, turning their bodies in the
saddle and continuing to fire their arrows as they retreated. At
another signal they turned around and again attacked the enemy.
This was later named the "Parthian shot" and may well be the origin
of our phrase "parting shot". The Greeks called the Scythians "horse
archers" because they were so skillful with their small composite
bow. These horse-archers were ambidextrous and extremely
accurate and their arrows traveled a great distance (over 500
meters). A practiced archer could shoot around twenty arrows a
minute. According to Rolf Rolle, "a composite bow of this nature
would have taken between five and ten years to produce, as special



types of wood and horsehair string were used and long periods of
seasoning were necessary."[10] It required a significant amount of
skill to produce such a bow. The arrowheads used by the Scythians
were made of bronze. The later Huns introduced arrowheads made
of iron, which could penetrate metal armor.
The Hun horseman who brought home a head from battle
received a glass of wine from the Senyő. There is no evidence to
show that the Huns kept slaves. Bravery was held in high regard and
even a brave prisoner was allowed to fight among the leaders. The
Huns took care of their injured fighters, about two thousand years
before the other peoples of the world. It was the soldier's duty to
bring out of the battle the body of a comrade who had died. Those
who brought out a corpse inherited all his movable goods.
There is no evidence that either the Scythians or the Huns were
fishermen but, according to Rolf Rolle, some Scythians were farmers.
They grew barley, millet, rye, peas, lentils, beans, flax and hemp. "In
recent years, indications of horticulture have been increasing. The
charred pips of apples and cherries verify their cultivation; drying
ovens for fruit show a kind of preserving system which is still in use
today."[11] Otto Maenchen-Helfen also writes that the Huns
practiced agriculture.[12] Claudius and Ammianus denied them the
knowledge of agriculture.
The Huns were the first to develop a tribal system. Later, one tribal
leader became ruler over all the tribes. This unified the entire Hun
people. The Magyars had a similar system. Within the empire there
was a loose territorial interdependence. There was almost total
autonomy from the Emperor. Civil wars between the tribes, instigated
by the Chinese, caused the fall of the Hun Empire.
A world power such as the Hun Empire must have developed an



organized system for keeping order. Their military organization was
based on the decimal system. That in itself shows a great level of
civilization. The Chinese Annals mention twenty-four high
dignitaries. Under each of these were 10,000 men. There was one
commander or corporal for every ten men. (This commander in
Hungarian is called a "tizedes". "Tíz" means "ten".) For every ten
corporals there was one captain. (Captain in Hungarian is
"százados". "Száz" means "one hundred".) Over ten captains, was
the colonel. (Colonel in Hungarian is "ezredes". "Ezer" means "one
thousand".) In charge of ten colonels was a commander called
"tizezredes". "Tizezer" means "ten-thousand". The entire army was
divided into four army corps. Each army corps had 100,000 men and
a commander who was called a "százezredes". ("Százezer" means
"one hundred thousand".) These four commanders reported directly
to the Senyő (emperor). If the Huns were so "boorish" and
"barbarian" as they are so often called, they would not have been
able to develop such a precise system, and moreover maintain it for
a long period of time. In later years, the Magyars also organized their
armies according to the decimal system. The Chinese Annals praise
the Hun laws. Between the Senyő and the nation there must have
been an agreement that the new Senyő must be elected from among
his descendants. In their three thousand year history there was not
one occasion that the Senyő was elected from another family. The
Huns, Scythians and Magyars all had the custom of swearing an oath
with blood, (blood brotherhood). By drinking a mixture of wine and
their own blood, into which their weapons had been dipped, they
swore allegiance for life. Two warriors drank from a single drinking
horn. Rolf Rolle says: "This simultaneous drinking was obviously
important; it sealed the bond to the death and perhaps even beyond
into the next world."[13] Rolf Rolle shows a picture of a gold plaque
depicting two Scythian warriors swearing blood brotherhood. This
plaque was from the Kul-Oba kurgan from the 4th. Century B.C. This



shared custom of swearing blood brotherhood proves the
relationship between the Huns, Scythians and Magyars more than
anything else does. In a nation's history, the language might change
but the customs generally survive.
There is another custom that is shared by the Huns and the
Magyars. Once a year, when the leaders came together for a
National Assembly, those who did not participate were expelled from
the union. The Senyő nominated his heir but the National Assembly
elected him. The rite of election was not regulated. This caused the
wars of succession among both the Huns and the Magyars. Benedek
Baráthosi Balogh writes that the Magyars, in their thought, their
customs, their laws and their temperament were completely identical
to the Huns. The Huns were a warlike army people but according to
the Chinese Annals, they did not have the custom of vendetta or
blood feud.
"Whosoever raises his sword against another shall be killed.
Whosoever steals from another, his family shall be taken (probably
as servants). For smaller infringements of the law, the penalty is a
whipping; for larger ones, execution. The longest term of
imprisonment was ten days and very few prisoners could be found."
[14] The Szekel Chronicles of Csik, about 1796, state that the
Szekels are the descendants of the Huns and one of their laws
stated: "To be born as a Szekel means to be born free." The
chronicles do not mention imprisonment as a punishment for crime.
It is commonly believed that the name Székely (Szekel) is derived
from Scytha (Scythian).
As for the religion of the ancient Scythians, they worshipped the
Sun-God and they also had a custom of sacrificing a white horse. In
China, the Huns did likewise but the Magyars no longer sacrificed
horses. They honored the white horse and valued horses so much



that they buried many horses along with their master. Some of the
Hun/Scythian burial customs were continued by the Avars and
Magyars, who also buried servants, horses and treasures along with
their lord. "The Hun custom of disfiguring their faces with deep
wounds as an expression of mourning was also found among the
Magyars. Jordanes mentions it in "Getica."[15] The Scythians also
practiced similar mourning rituals of disfigurement.[16] The
Scythians, Huns and Magyars all believed in life after death and
provided the corpse with all the comforts he would need on his
journey to the next world. They regarded the cemetery as sacred
ground. The Huns and Magyars also practiced religious tolerance.
Among the Huns of Atilla, Buddhism, Nestorianism, Manicheism and
Christianity were all accepted. Manicheism, which was the practise
of Christianity excluding the Old Testament, originated in the
Parthian Empire. Nestorianism was a similar religious philosophy.
When the Sassanid dynasty of Persia broke up the Parthian Empire in
A.D. 302, the Parthians, who were also known as Aparni, Avars, Huns
and Magyars, formed a new empire in the Carpathian Basin, which
became known as the Avar Empire, and they brought with them
these sects of Eastern Christianity. (The Magyars were just as
tolerant as the Huns and the Avars. In 1568, at the National Assembly
at Torda, Hungary was the first country in the world to announce
freedom of religion) The Senyő of the Huns greeted the rising sun
every morning with open arms and every month he greeted the new
moon in the same manner. The Huns believed in the spirits of
Heaven and Earth. They believed in foretelling the future by the
stars. This was a very ancient custom. There were Magi (shamans)
among the Huns as among other Turanian peoples.
When the history of the Eastern Huns came into public knowledge,
it was not accepted by many of the Western historians because
some of the dates did not correspond with those of Western history.



The major reason for this reluctance to accept it was that, on the
borders of Europe, Hun tribes were found at the time that they were
recorded to have existed in China. Western historians did not realize
that the Hun Empire was so large that it reached almost to the
borders of Europe. Finally it was a historian named Hirt who clarified
the information about the Huns by establishing data about certain
historical events of which the Western historians were unaware. In
About A.D. 452, the King of Suk-tak sent an envoy to the Hsiung-Nu
Huns to ask the Huns to release the merchants who were captured
at the Conquest of Kutsang. The country of Suk-tak was the country
that the Western historians called the country of the Alans. Because
the King of the Alans died fighting against the Hsiung-Nu Huns, his
country became part of the Hun Empire. We know from the Western
Chronicles, that the Huns, together with the Alans, attacked the
Eastern Goths in A.D.375.
The people of the Csitki Huns, in the middle of the first century
before Christ, disappeared from the records of the Chinese. In 91
B.C. the same thing happened with the people of the Northern Huns.
They ceased to be mentioned in the Chinese chronicles. In A.D. 261,
the Topa peoples were pressing all the peoples who were in their
way, including the Huns. At this time, the Black Huns were living in
the territory of the Urals. The White Huns were living on the Eastern
shores of the Caspian Sea. Ammianus Marcellinus records the home
of the Huns to be beside the Caspian Sea. Marcianus Heracleata
writes that the Huns lived in the Boristhenes territory after the Alans.
The Magyar Chronicles from A.D. 373 on, record that the Hun
leaders were the ancestors of the Magyars.[17] They mention Béla,
Köve, Kadicsa, and also a leader named Kádár. The Chronicles
mention that two Hun families were eligible for the election of the
Senyő, Zemény and Érd. Senyő Kun originated from the Zemény
family and also Karotán, Uld and Rugacs. With Rugacs, the family



died out. The Érd family was well known for the Senyős Oktár, Rof,
Etele (Atilla) and Buda.
Not only are similarities in customs an obvious connection
between the Huns, Scythians, Avars and Magyars but also similarities
in the motifs in their art and music. Dr. Miklós Érdy has conducted
research in Central Asia in Uiguria, Chorezm, Turkistan (Bukharia),
and East Turkistan. He collected folk motifs in embroidery and folk
songs that are identical to Hungarian folk motifs and brought them
back to Hungary. On one of his journeys, Dr. Érdy became
acquainted with Du Yaxiong, who conducts research in Chinese
folklore and music, and who, contrary to the usual lines of research,
is researching the connections between the Hun and the Magyar folk
music following it from East to West. Du Yaxiong has stated that the
structure of the Magyar folk songs, which are on a pentatonic scale,
strongly resembles that of the Uigur folk songs. He supports the
statement of Zoltán Kodály that the Magyar folk music is "totally
different" from the Finnish folk music. In 1987, Zoltán Kallós, a
Hungarian ethnographer, also emphasized that there was no
relationship between the Hungarian and Finnish folk music. Where
similarities between the folk music of these two peoples were
apparent, it was concluded that they were due to the Turkish
influence on both. Du Yaxiong states that the Uigur language was
"the same as the Hun but with a slight difference."[18] Dr. István
Kiszely also supports the relationship between the Uigur and Magyar
folk music and folk motifs in embroidery.[19]
Both Béla Bartok and Zoltán Kodály noticed that the character of
the Chinese folk songs and Hungarian folk songs was very similar
but neither of them suggested the influence of the Huns' migration
to the West. Kodály said: "Time wiped the Easterners' character from
the Hungarian people's faces, but cannot stop the flow of melodies
from the depths of their hearts and thus shows the ancient East." He



also said that the Hungarian folk music was "the ancient tributary of
that great thousand-year old Asian music and culture."[20]
The Huns began to move towards the West in A.D. 91. The
characteristics of the songs of the Hun peoples remained in the folk
music of the Uigurs and the Magyars. According to the French and
American history books, the Uigurs in the sixth century were the
teachers of the Asian countries. In their zenith they were more
advanced than the Indians and Chinese, and the Arabs learned from
them. Dr. Érdy states that the German researchers support the Hun
Magyar connection. The research of the Chinese folk music indicates
that the Magyar folk music is rooted in the Hun music. There are
numerous written documents dating back more than a thousand
years, the Magyar Chronicles, the legend of the Enchanted Stag, the
writings of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, all of which support the
Hun-Magyar connections. Constantine Porphyrogenitus called the
Magyars "Sabir-Asphaloi". It is a known fact that the Sabirs or
Subareans were a Hun people.
In the Hungarian folk art, the favorite motif is the tulip.
Ethnographers believe that this tulip motif is one of the most ancient
ornamental motifs of the Magyars. In spite of its ancient origins,
historians state that tulips were introduced into Hungary in the
seventeenth century from Holland. In his Asian research, Dr. Érdy
has found that the tulip motif is a very old motif. The home of the
wild tulip is in Central Asia, where there can be found a hundred and
twenty five varieties. Royal Hungarian ornamental objects from the
11th, 12th and 13th centuries, along with money and paintings, have
been found bearing the tulip motif. The ivy motif was the favorite
motif of the Árpád dynasty. It was found on Atilla's sword and other
articles. The tulip motif can be found on the coronation robe of Saint
Stephen, which was made in the 11th century. This tulip motif can be
traced back to the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. In the Pazyrik mound



graves of Huns or Scythians in the Altai Mountains, carpets were
found ornamented with this motif. According to the design on one
carpet, the dead Hun or Scythian ruler, on his horse, is riding before
God who, sitting on a throne, is handing him an ivy vine, with the
flower of life, the tulip, at the top. That symbolized life after death.
[21]
Dr. Érdy describes how the people of the Steppes celebrated the
coming of spring. After a long, cold winter, in the middle of April,
when the sun warms up, millions of multi-colored flowers cover the
Steppes. The people living there count this flowering as the
beginning of their year. They count their years, not from the rotations
of the moon or the earth, but from the number of times the Steppes
have flowered. This is why the tulip flower became known as the
flower of life.[22]
The Hun peoples brought with them from the Steppes the motifs
of the ivy and the tulips. According to Gyula Németh, the ancient
name of the tulip was "Lola", and it remains in the Persian and Arab
languages as "Lola", later becoming a girl's name. In the Turkish
language the tulip is called "la-le".
Besides the tulip, there is another ornamental motif on the
coronation robe of Saint Stephen, the bird motif. Until recently, it was
thought to be used as a filler, having no significance, yet in heraldry,
birds have an important position as protectors. On each side of the
tulip, they stand in a watchful stance with their heads turned
backwards facing the tulip. The "daru" (crane) is the noblest species
of the protecting birds of heraldry because of its extraordinary
vigilance. Between the tenth and fourteenth centuries it was widely
favored among the Magyars as a domesticated bird used for warning
against strangers because its hearing was even sharper than a
dog's. This is why it was given a place on the coronation robe as a



guard-bird. Two species of these cranes were widespread in
Hungary. One was the common grey crane (Grus g. grus) and the
other was the demoiselle crane (Anthropoides virgo). Both species
made their nests in almost all the territories where the wild tulips
grew. The grey crane nested more to the north of the demoiselle
crane. The Magyar people became acquainted with these birds on
the Steppes of Central Asia and came to like them. An interesting
fact is that the Goths were also steppe people originally, but in the
German folk motifs or religious heraldry, these guard-birds can be
found only in a few places. At the same time they are widespread in
Hungary.
From the early Western European, Byzantine, Armenian, Arab, and
Persian sources, it can be shown that the Magyar folk-poetry, folk
tales, folk-art, archeological findings such as swords and arrows,
horses, dogs, Magyar burial customs, their horse burial customs all
show connections with the Huns. In caves in China, used by the
Huns, Dr. Érdy discovered cave drawings depicting the legend of the
Enchanted Stag. He found these drawings in Cave No. 249 at Dun
Huang, in the county of Gasu, in northwest China and published his
findings in 1984.
Another Hungarian legend, the dream of Emese, can also be found
among the legends of the Buryats in Mongolia where the highest
shaman was supposed to be born from a mother who was
inseminated by an eagle. According to the Hungarian legend, Ugyek,
the descendant of Atilla, took Emese as his wife. On their wedding
night, Emese was visited by a great bird, the TURUL bird, a huge
eagle, which descended upon her, covering her with his black wings.
Half asleep, half awake, Emese had a dream. It seemed that a crystal
spring had sprung from her loins and began to flow toward the West,
growing bigger and bigger, into a swelling stream, flowing over
snow-covered mountains, finally reaching a beautiful plain. There,



the river stopped, and a magnificent tree sprang up from its waters.
Every branch and leaf of that tree was of pure gold, as was the fruit,
which grew abundantly on the miraculous tree. Emese, in her dream,
lay down under that tree, in the middle of the beautiful land, and fell
asleep. When she awoke, she was back in her husband's tent. The
memory of that dream stayed with her forever. Nine months later, a
son was born to Emese, the first-born son of Ügyek. He was named
ÁLMOS (Boy of Dream) and became the father of ÁRPÁD, who led
the Magyars across plains and mountains into that beautiful land
which once belonged to the Huns and which was, according to the
minstrel's songs, their rightful inheritance.[23]
In 1983 and 1984, Dr. Érdy researched the Hungarian folk motifs.
He found 23 basic motifs identical to the Scythian, Hun, Subarean
and Altaic peoples, and none that were similar to those of the Finno
Ugric peoples. In 1989, Dr. Érdy presented the results of his
researches to the Hungarian Academy of Science, and opened a new
avenue of research.
In 1988, Professor Izabella Horváth, an art historian, in a paper
entitled "From Inner Asia to the Carpathian Basin" presented the
results of her research into the art of the Magyar people and
contested the theory that it was influenced by the Byzantine, Persian
and Islamic art.[24]
Izabella Horváth and her colleagues collected animal motifs in the
territory of Eurasia. They studied artifacts from the museums, and
pictures in archeological reviews. They developed three charts
showing those cultural characteristics, which they intended to
analyze. The thirty-eight animal motifs were divided into five groups.
The chart showed that the motifs of the Scythians, Huns, Avars and
Magyars were for the most part identical. The second chart showed
so few resemblances between the Finno-Ugric and Magyar motifs,



that they could be disregarded. The third chart showed much less of
a resemblance to the Sassanid, Persian, Byzantine and Islamic art
than to the Scythian-Hun-Avar art. In the first chart, the griffin motif
appears in a substantial number of designs, more than any other
animal. The second chart compares the griffin motif in the same way
as the first chart. Here it can he seen that the griffin motif appears
more often in the art of the Huns, Scythians, Avars and Magyars than
it does in the art of any other people. Griffins are often depicted
guarding the Scythian gold. Again it was very obvious that in the
Byzantine and Islamic art, the griffin motifs were much fewer in
number than in the art of the people of the Steppes. In the German
or Carolingian arts the griffin motif appeared even less often, yet
Minns, Fettich Nándor, and Talbot Rice, stated that the arts of the
Germans originate from the Scythian art.[25] They based their
assumption mainly on animal motifs. Yet in the Hungarian folk art the
griffin appears in much larger numbers than among the Germans.
This is why it is advisable to reexamine the former conclusions.
Western historians have attributed the origins of the Hungarian
folk arts to the Byzantine folk arts, because it never even occurred to
them that a "barbarian, nomadic people” with "Finno-Ugric" origins
could have developed such beautiful motifs.
It is a well-known fact that among the peoples of the Steppes,
birds of prey signified godly origins. The lion and the tiger signified
the power and strength of royalty. This is why in the folk art, the bird
of prey and the lion or tiger blended into a single motif and the griffin
evolved with a bird's head and a lion's body. The griffin came to
signify the godly origin and power of the royalty and the griffin motif
was found most often on royal possessions and garments, for
example the Hungarian coronation robe, the artifacts in the Pazyrik
graves of the Scythians and the Noi-ula Hun graves.



In the Magyar legend of the dream of Emese and the legend of
the origins of the Buryat people, the nation originated from God in
the form of an eagle. The doe was the ancient mother of the nation.
The leader whose father was the Turul bird or eagle, (legend of the
dream of Emese) and whose mother was a doe, (legend of the
Enchanted Stag) must have had great power at that time. The pair of
Griffins guarding the tree of life is a motif that often occurs in the folk
arts of the people of the Steppes and the Magyars. The conception
of Álmos, the son of Emese, by the Turul bird, signifies his heavenly
origins. Arnold Ipolyi describes Álmos and Árpád as priest-kings.[26]
In the folk arts of the Steppe people, the griffin motif indicates the
duty of the priest-king towards his people. This cannot be found in
the art of the Ostyak and Votyak people living near the river Ob in
Siberia, who are supposedly the ancestors of the Magyars. Álmos
originated from the TURUL clan from which the Turks, who ruled for
a long period in the territories of the steppes of Eurasia, also
originated. Csernyecov demonstrates that the Steppe peoples
migrated from the south and east towards the north and not, as the
Finno-Ugric linguists state, from north to south.[27]
The data from the folklore show that there is a resemblance
between the Magyars and the Eastern peoples.[28] The tale of the
Tree that reaches to Heaven is the most often mentioned. A dragon
kidnaps a girl and carries her to the top of the tree that reaches to
Heaven. Those who started out to try to save her all died in the
attempt. Finally the little swineherd tried to free her. With his axe, he
cut steps in the trunk of the tree and climbed higher and higher,
reaching the different levels. On each level was a different world. On
one level lived the Wind, on another, the Moon, and on another, the
mother of the Sun. These all helped the little swineherd to reach his
goal. The researcher stated that this folk-tale represents the
ceremony of the táltos or shaman (holy man). The shaman, in a



similar way, climbed higher and higher up a tree that was raised in
the middle of the tent. This folk-tale preserves the beliefs of the
ancient religion. The ancient people believed in the tree of life, which
was the life-giver and preserver of every living creature. That there
were connections to the cosmos is shown by the fact that on the
seventh and ninth branch of the tree lived the Sun and the Moon.
Adorján Magyar has related the legend of the Enchanted Stag, which
remains as yet unpublished, in which he describes the twins, Hunor
and Magor, growing up into hunters. He describes their adventures
as small children, climbing higher and higher up the mountain in
search of the mother of the Moon and the mother of the Sun.
The archeological findings seem to prove that the people who
used the griffin and ivy motifs were made up of people from three
different territories that were far from each other. The people who
used only the griffin motif came from the territory of the Iranian
plateau into the Carpathian Basin, but not by a direct route. They first
went to the territory called Magna Hungaria where they joined with
the people who used the ivy motif and here a people who used the
acanthus motif, who originated in the Caucasus, obtained power
over them. This consolidated group, now called Avars, then migrated
to the Carpathian Basin to rejoin their brother-peoples in the land of
Atilla.
Those who used the griffin motif came from a territory where
there was no forest and birds of prey were dominant. This is how
they developed the griffin motif. Those who used the ivy motif came
from a territory of dense forests. The griffin is connected to the
Magyar legend of the Turul bird and the ivy to the legend of the Tree
of Life.
Géza Radics writes: "Herodotus, the father of history writing, in
the 5th. century, mentions a revolution which broke out among the



Scythians. As a result of this revolution, the Scythians were forced to
leave their territory north of the Black Sea. According to Herodotus,
the Scythians settled in the above-mentioned territory of Magna
Hungaria. It is not impossible that the ancestors of the people of the
griffin motif could be found among these Scythians, who were living
near the people of the ivy motif in Magna Hungaria or even together
with them until they went together to the Carpathian Basin. It is
probable that the Scythian/Magyar identity evolved from here."[29]
Géza Radics does not believe it possible that the people who
used the griffin motif who came from the Iranian plateau, the people
who used the ivy motif who came from the Volga territory, and the
people of the Caucasus who used the acanthus motif all spoke the
Magyar language.
However, the story of the tree of life was widespread in almost
every territory where the Magyar language was spoken. At the time
of the people of Árpád, it must have been even better known. This is
why we would expect the ornaments of the Arpád era to reflect the
knowledge of this tree of life, just as it is reflected in the folk-art of
the Eastern peoples. However, in the folk art of the Arpád era, not
one artifact represents the tree of life. In the folk-art of the Árpád
people, the palm motif was often used. Among the early Avars, we
can find the motif of the tree of life carved on bones, and also among
the later Avars, carved onto belts and belt-buckles. Gyula László
writes that wherever the motifs of the griffin and ivy were found, the
language was Magyar and suggests that the Magyars inherited the
story of the Tree of Life from the Avars.[30]
Historians have stated that the legends of the Tree of Life, the
Turul bird and the Enchanted Stag are actually totem legends. The
progenitress (ancestress) of the twin brothers, Hunor and Magor,
was the Doe that led them through the Meotis Marsh. The belt



buckles of the later Avars carried the design of the doe. We may
conclude that the legend of the enchanted stag and the legend of
the tree of life both originate from the later Avars.
In Hungarian territory, archeologists have found belt buckles of
the later Avars, ornamented with animal representations such as the
deer, the bird, the lion, the wild boar and others. The Árpád
Chronicles only mention one totem animal, the Turul bird, which
Árpád inherited from Atilla. The origins of the belief in the totem
animals go back much further than the time of the homecoming of
Árpád. Among the Szekel Hungarians there is still the belief that they
are of Hun origins.
The legends of the Enchanted Stag and the Tree of Life, and the
folk music all indicate Avar-Hun connections. The Saint László
legend also reveals pagan connections. Saint László, the blond
horseman, fought against the black-haired Kun (Cumanian)
horseman who had kidnapped a Magyar girl. Originally the legend
probably had pagan protagonists, but in the eleventh century, Saint
László was the hero. This was originally a cosmic drama in which the
light fought against the darkness and good against bad. Both
warriors were invincible but the Kun had only one vulnerable point,
his heel tendon. The Magyar girl cut this tendon and the Kun warrior
was defeated. The horses followed their masters' example and
fought each other, biting and kicking each other. This legend is also
found among the Scythians who predated the Greeks. The Greek
legend of Achilles must have been adopted from the Scythians.
These data are important for several reasons. Firstly, because the
date of the Magyars' reclamation of their homeland is about four
hundred years earlier than is now accepted. Secondly, the
Carpathian Basin was not a sparsely populated area occupied by
Slavs, as is commonly believed and thirdly, the Magyars who



reclaimed their homeland were not barbarians but had connections
with the Scythians, Huns, Avars and the ancient populace of the
Carpathian Basin who had lived there for millennia.

THE HOMELAND RECLAIMED
Chapter 6.
The Magyars and the Ancient Populace of the Carpathian Basin
In linguistic discussions new questions have arisen regarding the
Turkish and Magyar origins and the origins of the names Turk,
Onugor and Magyar. New theories have surfaced, one of the most
important being that, already at the time of the earliest migration of
the peoples of the Steppes, a Magyar-speaking people was living in
the Carpathian Basin. The originator of this theory is Lajos Marjalaki
Kiss, who stated:
"I have a strong belief that the Árpád Conquest brought a political
change, and formed a new state in this land, but the populace in this
territory remained 90% the same as it was before the invasions of
the Huns, Avars, Bulgars, Slavs and Germans. The majority of the
people did not come into the Carpathian Basin with Árpád. They
lived there before the Huns and the Avars and spoke a Magyar
language. It is my conclusion that these were the descendents of a



Magyar-speaking peasantry who were the Scythian, later called
Sarmatian people from the millennia before Christ."[1]
Elemer Zalotai, in his handwritten essays, often expresses the view
that a Sarmatian people, which populated the Great Hungarian Plain,
were assimilated into the Magyars of Árpád.[2] Dezső Simonyi
believes that, already in the fifth century A.D., the Ugor-Magyars
entered the Carpathian Basin with the Bulgars.[3] Géza Nagy
connects the appearance of the Ugor-Magyars in the Carpathian
Basin with the dissolution of the Bulgar Empire in Caucasia.[4] No
matter how the Ugors settled into the Carpathian Basin, one thing is
sure - that they did not come with Árpád, but rather with the Huns,
Avars or Bulgars, and not in the ninth century, but in the fifth or sixth
centuries.
One of the tribes of the Bulgar Kagan, Kuvrat, was called by the
Byzantine writers, "Onugor". The name of the Hun king whose
empire at that time was on the shore of the Sea of Azov, which was
visited by Kuvrat, was "Muager" (Magyar). Kuvrat was the founder of
the Dul dynasty. The Magyar legends mention King Dul of the Alans.
When the White Stag led Hunor and Magor, each with one hundred
warriors, through the Meotis Marsh, and disappeared from their
sight, Hunor and Magor found the two daughters of King Dul and
their handmaidens, whom they kidnapped and their descendants
became the Huns and the Magyars. The legend of Hunor and Magor
is mentioned also in an ancient history book of the Magyars which
only recently came to light in a Turkish translation. In 1543, at the fall
of Székesfehérvár, at the time of the burning of the King's castle,
The History of the Magyars, written in Latin, fell into the hands of the
interpreter of Suleiman I, Terdzsuman Mahmud, who translated it
into Turkish in the Tarihi Ungurusz. Terdzsuman was born in
Hungary, became a Turkish slave as a child and worked himself up to
the position of interpreter.



According to the Tarihi Ungurusz, (translated into Hungarian in
1982 by József Blaskovics), when the sons of Nimrud, Hunor and
Magor, arrived in the Carpathian Basin, they found an ancient
populace speaking the Magyar language. The Tarihi Ungurusz was
written before the discovery of the Sumerian clay tablets. At that
time, to be named the descendants of Nimrud was not a claim to
distinction. After the discovery of the Sumerian tablets, when the
whole world accepted Sumer as the cradle of civilization, it became
popular for nations to link their ancestry to the Sumerians. In the
legend, the distant past and the actual historical events became
intermingled. The important point is that at some time in the past,
there were Magyar and Bulgar connections. The second important
point is that, when they entered the Carpathian Basin, the Árpád
Magyars found, not foreigners as is often emphasized but, peoples
related to them. Some of the "nations" who came with Árpád,
particularly the Megyer "nation" spoke the same language as the
people they found in the Carpathian Basin. The Magyar people are
definitely more ancient than historians lead us to believe. József
Hampel says that the Avars remaining in Pannonia met the Árpád
Magyars and lived side by side with them. We know that from the
archeological remains.[5]
Géza Nagy recognizes the connections between the Caucasian
findings and those of Hungary. According to Gyula László, these
findings support the Onugor settlements in the Carpathian Basin
between A.D. 568 and 678. At that time, the Kutugurs, Huns, Sabirs
(Subareans), Onugors, and Bulgars settled in the Carpathian Basin
among the Avars. The early Russian chronicles call the Caucasus the
Magyar mountains.[6] The Russian Chronicles also state that, in the
Caucasus, there was a city called Madzar (Magyar).
Gyula Rhé was the first to mention the continuation of the Avars in
the Carpathian Basin.[7] Recently, Tibor Horváth, a Hungarian



archeologist excavating the territory of Caucasia and the River
Kuban, discovered pottery and metal artifacts that were identical to
the round handled pottery and metal artifacts of the Avars. The art
and culture of the people of the Caucasus shows an amazing
resemblance to that of the Avars in the Carpathian Basin. Tibor
Horváth says that we cannot state that these were simply copies and
we have to conclude that there were connections between the Avars
and the people of the Caspian territory. The Avars in the Carpathian
Basin must have separated from the people of Caucasia. When they
entered the Carpathian Basin in A.D. 568, the Avars brought with
them some of the peoples from Caucasia and the Kuban territory -
Huns, Sabirs, Onugors and Magyars. Gyula László's discovery that,
in A.D. 670, a large group of Magyars entered the Carpathian Basin,
was the deciding factor in his conclusion that the Magyars twice
reclaimed their homeland, once in A.D. 670 and again in A.D 896.[8]
According to the Magyar Chronicles, there were 108 different
clans of Magyars who made up the seven "nations" who returned to
the Carpathian Basin with Árpád. Historians tell us that the Magyars
were living in Etelkőz before moving west into the Carpathian Basin.
They were actually one of the many ethnic groups living in the Kazar
Empire.
Until the seventh century A.D., the Kazars had been living in the
Caucasus. The Arabs forced them to move to the north where they
settled near the river Volga. They established a new capital, which
they called ITIL. This was the same name as that from which Atilla is
derived, ETEL, the original name of the River Volga. This city of ITIL
was built on the bank of the River Volga. Historians treat the Kazars
as they do other Turanian or Ural-Altaic peoples, simply declaring
them to be of unknown origins. But, if we look more closely at this
people, we will see that they are not unknown. Their name "Kazar"
belongs in the family of the Turanian or Ural-Altaic languages. The



Magyars, who also belong to this group, and not to the Finno-Ugric
group, have many words of a similar structure. For example: Hungár
- one of the names of the Magyars; huszár - cavalryman; kufár
peddlar; vizár - flood; kosár - basket; hinár-sea-weed; futár
messenger; the Tatar name also belongs in this group.
The Curator of the Soviet Academy of Science (the Hermitage), Dr.
Artamonov, writes that, in A.D. 730, the Kazar Kagan, Bulan, adopted
the Jewish religion and soon after, the rest of the Kazar aristocracy
followed suit.[9] Artamonov dates this conversion to the latter half of
the eighth century. There is more information about this in the letters
of the Kazar King Joseph, an anonymous writer from Cambridge and
in the writings of Jehuda Halévy. All three mention Dagastan, the
ancient center of Kazaria, where a coup took place. It is also
mentioned by a Hungarian historian, Ojtózi Erdelyi-Kádár.[10]
Artamonov wrote that Jewish fugitives took refuge in Kazaria and
in a short time they converted the Kazar aristocrats to Judaism. It
was relatively easy to convert them because, according to
Artamonov, the Kazar aristocrats did not want to belong to either the
Byzantine or Arab sphere of influence and be subjected to the
efforts of both to convert them to their religions. They preferred to
choose a third religion to avoid conflict. One of the ethnic elements
among the Kazar people was the Turkish or TUR-UG people.
According to Professor Kálmán Gosztonyi of the Sorbonne
University, the Sumerian word, TUR-UG, means a fragment of a
people. These Turkish people crossed the Caucasus to reach the
Aral Sea, Caspian Sea and Lake Baikal. Here they met a highly
cultured equestrian people with whom they united in a loose alliance.
When the Kazar aristocracy was converted to Judaism, they elected
two Christian, two Jewish, two Mohammedan and one pagan advisor
to the Kagan. In a short time, the entire advisory committee was
comprised of Jews. In spite of that, the people of Kazaria did not like



the laws of the Talmud. Obadja took over the power from Kagan
Bulan. He assigned Bulan to a position of second-in-command and
the Kagan, from this time on, functioned only in a religious capacity.
Under Obadja's rule, the Jewish religion became the state religion in
the Kazar Empire. In one of his letters, King Joseph of the Kazars
mentions Obadja, whose son inherited the throne, as the biggest
patron of the Jewish religion . Only the son of the ruler could inherit
the throne, never a foreigner. Thus the dual-monarchy was
established. When revolution broke out, the Magyars, who were
living in Kazaria, took the side of the revolutionaries because they
could not accept the new religion, Judaism. At that time, the
Magyars played a significant role in the history of Kazaria.[11] The
Talmudist Jewish leaders invited foreign powers to help them
suppress the rebellion of the Turkish and Magyar Kazars. Thus the
outside powers, the Uz and Pechenegs obtained power in Kazaria.
The Kazar people were very much weakened by this inside struggle.
According Artamonov, in A.D. 854 and 855, the Kabars, one of the
peoples of Kazaria, fled to the side of the Magyars. The name Kabar
was written by Arab writers as Habr (singular) and Ahbar (plural).
Ahbar later became Kabar.
Because of the Jewish coup in Kazaria, the Magyars were divided
into two major camps. One group left Kazaria and formed a new
state between the Caspian and Black Seas together with the Hun,
Onugor and Sabir (Subarean) peoples. They became known as the
Kuma Magyars. The name of their capital was Madzsar (Magyar),
located on the bank of the river Kuma. The palaces of this city, the
Christian churches and Mohammedan mosques, and the irrigation
canals, now in ruins, are witness to an outstanding culture and a free
empire. A traveler named Pallas, made drawings of this city in the
nineteenth century. Moses of Chorene was the first to mention this
Magyar settlement. In the tenth century, Gardizi mentions that they



were followers of Jesus, Mohammed and various idols. No one
mentioned that there were Jews among them.
The Kuma Magyars had lived on the northern slopes of the
Caucasus Mountains, from the year A.D. 460 on. They had
connections as far as Kiev until the thirteenth century. László
Bendeffy collected many data to prove the existence of the Kuma
Magyars.[12] These Magyars were Christian and, in 1329, Jerettan,
(originally Gyertyan), King of the Asian Magyars, asked Pope John
XXII to send a bishop to his country. The Pope sent Bishop Thomas
Mankasola. All the Magyars from Magna Hungaria and from Bactria
eventually gathered in the territory of the Kuma Magyars
(Kunmagyaria). One hundred years earlier, a Dominican monk from
Hungary, called Julianus, had met many Baskirian Magyars on this
territory, and they were able to understand each other perfectly. At
that time, in Hungary, the Magyars knew about the existence of
Kunmagyaria, where people spoke their language. In the fourteenth
century, the people of Kunmagyaria asked King Lajos the Great, King
of the Carpathian Magyars for help against Tamerlane, the Mongol
but King Lajos refused because he did not want the Mongols to
attack his country. In 1395, Tamerlane completely annihilated the
Magyars in Kunmagyaria. Only very few were able to escape and
they took refuge in the mountains surrounding the Kuma, Malka,
Bakszan, Csegem, Cserek, and Terek rivers. Today, the Abkazo,
Osszat, Kabar, and Kurd peoples are those who connected with the
Kuma people and kept their customs.
The other group of Magyars, because of the civil war in Kazaria,
migrated towards the West, and settled at first in Levédia, between
the Kuban, Don and Dnieper rivers. The pagan Kabars who also
objected to the imposition of the Jewish religion in the entire Kazar
Empire joined the migrating Magyars. The rulers of Kazaria did not
want to accept that they were losing the Magyars because the



Magyar military strength was very important to them. Therefore, at
the beginning, they tried to persuade the Magyars to stay with them.
They offered them the chance to fight as mercenaries for Kazaria but
Álmos and the Magyars knew that if they accepted this proposal, the
Magyar people would be erased, because of the constant struggles
within the Kazar Empire, just as were later the Pechenegs and the
Uz, who accepted the same offer. At that time the devastation and
genocide reached tremendous proportions. Many nations were
extinguished such as the Pechenegs, the Uz and the Cumanians yet
András Zakar writes that historians ignore this fact.
The historical data around this period are disappearing worldwide.
Those historians who mention the civil wars in the Kazar Empire
usually omit the Talmudist coup and the resulting separation of the
Magyar nation into two groups and they do not mention the
genocide in the Empire which included the Magyars, Scythians,
Pechenegs, Uz, and Cumanians. Those historians who deal with this
topic mention how powerful and civilized Kazaria was but they fail to
mention that Kazaria was powerful only while the Magyars were part
of the Empire. After the Magyars departed, the Kazar Empire lost its
power and disintegrated. It was not the Magyars who learned from
the Kazars who became Jews, but rather the Kazars who learned
from the Magyars and adopted the ancient Magyar political
structure, which made Kazaria into a strong and civilized nation.
Professor Kálmán Gosztonyi of the Sorbonne University explains the
origins of Kazaria. Without the knowledge of the languages of
ancient Asia Minor, we cannot determine where the Kazar language
belongs. According to Professor Gosztonyi, every known Kazar word
can be understood with the help of the Sumerian language. For
example: TUR-UG in Sumerian means a small nation that has broken
away from a larger nation (a fragment of the whole).[13] TUR-UG
became TURK in English and TÖRÖK in Hungarian. Even today the



Hungarian word "tür" means "to break". This name is very fitting for
the ancient Scythians and the Sarmatians because in this large
territory where they lived there was not a large unified nation. In
1000 B.C, they arrived in small groups from the south side of the
Caucasus Mountains. This is why even now many historians believe
they were a Persian people. But if we compare the surviving Scythian
names with the Sumerian words and meanings, we can see an
obvious connection. There is no question that there is a Sumerian
and Iranian mixture in the language. Only those linguists and
historians who did not have a thorough knowledge of the Sumerian
language state that the Scythian and Sarmatian languages are
derived from the Persian languages. They actually show a closer
connection to the Sumerian language than to the Persian language.
The Scythian and Sarmatian peoples were the major populace of
Kazaria. At the beginning of the seventh century, Theophilactus did
not call the Kazars by this name. He called them Turks but in A.D.
626, they were called Turks who lived in Kazaria.[14]
András Zakar writes that the contemporary historical sources
mention the tragedy of the civil war in the Kazar Empire but none of
the sources mentions the reason for the civil war.[15] These sources
name the Pechenegs as enemies of the Magyars, but do not explain
why they were enemies, or in whose service the Pechenegs acted.
To understand the situation we have to describe the background at
that time.
The Magyars had always known why the strong Magyar nation had
to separate into two groups and why they had to be killed. They also
knew how they could avoid a recurrence of this division. First they
had to become strong again. This is why they united with the
survivors of the Kazar civil war, the Kabars and the Cumanians
(Kuns). With this new alliance, the Magyars migrated towards the
west. After leaving Levédia, they settled in Etelköz in the ninth



century. Here they made their first blood union, which emphasized
their unity and their determination to prevent possible recurrence of
this coup in Kazaria.
The seven Magyar leaders came to the conclusion that only a
unified leadership could achieve the enormous task of resettling into
the Carpathian Basin. Therefore they made a blood-union and
elected Álmos to be their leader. They declared that the new leaders
should be elected only from the descendants of Álmos. Anonymus
described this blood union, calling the new leader: "ducem et
praeceptoram". Álmos and his son Árpád were spiritual and political
leaders at the same time.
Álmos was the Magyar leader or Priest-king who prepared the
Magyars' return to their ancient homeland. He ordered them to
manufacture all the tools and implements that they would need on a
long journey and grow enough food for the journey. Only by being
prepared could they undertake a successful migration. If they had
not made adequate preparations, this undertaking would have been
a disaster.
When Álmos realized the danger of the Talmudist coup, he
immediately ordered that the Magyars should prepare to leave and
look for a new country. The migration of four hundred thousand
people and an unbelievable number of animals required a great deal
of planning. The preparation for this migration was described by
Dunlop, Marquart and Macartney. Professor Artamonov, in his
aforementioned book, offered new data about the Talmudist coup in
Kazaria. Antal Bartha, a well-known Hungarian historian, adopted
these data and in 1964, he wrote an article about the coup in the
Szazadok, No. 4. p.807. Unfortunately, in 1968, Artamonov was
relieved of his position as curator of the Hermitage museum and in
the same year, for reasons still unknown, Antal Bartha, in the



Történelmi Szemle, Issue 1-2, Nov. 1968, retracted the statements
he had made in 1964, in which he had accepted Artemanov's data.
László Makkai writes in the 1968, issue No.II, of Minerva, p.43 "Az
idők sodrában": "The dissolution of the tribal union was the first blow
to the power of the Kazar Empire."[16] The Chorezmians joined the
departing Magyars. Today these people are called "Kaliz" by the
Hungarians. In the twelfth century the Hungarian laws allowed these
people to practice their customs. Several place names have
remained in Hungary which are a reminder of these people. The
name, "Chorezm", in Sumerian was KU-MAGGAR-RI-IES-MA. The
meaning of this name was "Holy, glorious, nation's land". This name
was identical in the fifth century with the name that Moses of
Chorene used for the Magyars: Ku-Maggarii. The Sumerian word
analysis is from Elemér Novotny. These two statements tell us about
the origins of the Choresmian people and the Sumerian connections
of the Magyar people. We stated earlier that the Magyars refused the
Talmudist Kazars' proposals to be the policemen of the state. The
Pechenegs and the Uz accepted this assignment and were later
erased because of the inside struggles. The same fate would have
befallen the Magyars if they had accepted that role. The last remains
of the Pechenegs, under the leadership of Tonozuba, settled in
Hungary in the reign of Stephen I. Tonozuba and his wife were buried
alive by the Christians because they would not accept Christianity.
The birth of Prince Álmos, who became the Priest-King of the
Magyars, was the greatest joy for all the Scythian and Magyar
peoples because in him they saw the savior of the people. Anonymus
is not sparing in using the most glorifying adjectives in writing about
Álmos. There is a mystery about the death of Álmos. Until recently,
the Hungarians did not know what happened to him, how and under
what circumstances he died. The anti-Hungarian history writing
states that Árpád was ordered to kill Álmos but why would Árpád



have killed his legendary father? Such an act would have caused the
Magyars and the Scythians to hate him. It was not necessary in order
for him to obtain power because Álmos had already appointed him
as his successor.
In the County of Zemplén, in 1958, now in Slovakia, archeologists
discovered the grave of a Magyar prince from the time of the
Magyars of Árpád. The head of the skeleton was cut off and placed
at the right shoulder. The skeletal measurements were identical to
the measurements of the body of Álmos. At the time of his burial,
perfect silver replicas of the golden weapons of Álmos were placed
in his grave. This was done so that the weapons which Álmos used,
which were believed to have magical properties, could be used by
Árpád as the new Priest-king. The only prince of the Magyars, at that
time, was Álmos. Árpád and, later, King István, inherited the original
sword of Álmos which is presently in a museum in Prague. The
decoration on the sword found in the grave was identical to that of
the sword of St. István. The decoration of the saddlebag, the
sacrificial goblet, the horse's harness and other objects from the
grave such as bracelets, necklaces and ankle bracelets made of gold
and silver, ornaments for braiding, the quiver with seven arrows,
leather clothing with silver decoration, were all identical to those of
the Magyars of that period and all indicative of the high rank of the
person buried in the grave. The appearance of the identical sword in
this grave proves that this is the grave of Álmos.
It is possible that Álmos was a victim of the revenge of the Kazars.
He probably realized that the Kazars would follow the Magyars who
had left their union, and he prepared for the possibility that he might
be killed, by giving the leadership of the Magyars to his son while he
was still alive. Some historians theorize that, once they had
accomplished their mission, the Magyars sacrificed Álmos as a priest
king, a divine person. But this was never a custom among the



Magyars so why would we suppose that they did that? If we accept
such a supposition, we would be supporting the theory that the
Magyars of Árpád were really pagan barbarians.
In the vicinity of Szomotor, in the present land of Slovakia, where
the grave of Álmos was found, the Magyars buried him and paid him
their last respects. In Hungarian "szomorú tor" means a sad feast or
a burial feast. "Szomorú" in modern Hungarian means "sad"; "tor"
means "feast". Both words are still used today but the phrase
"szomorú tor" has been replaced by "halotti tor" which means "feast
of the dead" or "burial-feast". "Szomorútor" was mispronounced
"Szomotor" by the Slavs. The earliest written Hungarian version of
the word "szomorútor" was found in 1803, in the writings of Szirmay
who writes: "Szomotor olim zomoru-tor pagus Hungaricus".[17] This
is evidence that this was Magyar territory because the Magyars
would not have buried their leader in a foreign territory. This territory
later became inhabited by Slavs and was given to Czechoslovakia in
1920 at the Treaty of Trianon. If we disregard the Slav influence on
the Hungarian word, we can see a Hungarian name which goes back
about 1100 years and we can see the progression of the Hungarian
language: "z" changed to "sz"; "zomoru-tor" became "szomoru-tor"
which later became "Szomotor" in the Slovak language. This burial
feast was called a sad-feast because the Magyars had to bury their
priest-king who had done so much for the nation.
Another very strong and populous nation which was almost
completely erased because of the inside struggles in the Kazar
Empire were the Cumanians (Kuns) One of their last remaining
groups also received a welcome in Hungary. They are now living in
the territory called Kiskunsag and Nagykunsag in Hungary.
Anonymus in his "Gesta" says that, as the Magyars crossed the
River Dnieper at Kiev, together with other nations that had joined



them, seven Cumanian armies, who were mercenaries of the Kazars,
attacked them. The Magyars defeated the bald-headed Cumanians.
These Cumanians were those who had accepted the Jewish religion
of the Kazars, which insisted that they shave their heads. This
baldness protected them from the Pecheneg mercenaries. Those
who did not accept the Jewish religion despised those with shaved
heads. The long braided hair of the Ural-Altaic people indicated their
freedom and dignity. Baldness indicated humiliation, submission and
weakness. This baldness also meant a loss of freedom. The
populace of Kiev came to a peaceful agreement with the army of
Álmos. Everyone was able to stay home and their leaders sent their
sons into the service of Álmos. The seven defeated Cumanian
leaders, when they saw the goodness of Álmos towards the people
of Kiev, voluntarily accepted him as their leader and swore an oath of
loyalty to him.
In 892, the united Magyars elected Árpád as their leader. Árpád
soon made diplomatic connections with the Byzantine Emperor, Leo
the Wise, and convinced him to undertake a joint campaign against
the Bulgars who were at that time a major power in the Carpathian
Basin. Leo accepted this alliance in A.D. 894 and it came time for
Árpád to take back the ancient land of the Magyars which had
belonged to Atilla, and later the Avar Kagan Bajan. Árpád entrusted
the leadership of the Nyék and Jenő "nations" to his eldest son,
Levente, who, with the Byzantine allies, attacked the Bulgars from
the south, on the lower Danube, while Árpád, with his main power,
entered the Carpathian Basin through the Verecke Pass. Levente's
attack was very successful, and he even occupied the capital of the
Bulgars, but then Leo the Wise let the Magyars down by making
peace with the Czar of the Bulgars, Simeon. The Bulgars then with
their full army were able to turn against the two Magyar nations, led
by Levente. Even so, Levente kept up a fierce battle as he retreated,



so that the power of the Bulgars was weakened and the army of
Árpád was able to take over the rest of the Carpathian Basin, which
did not resist him because they were Magyar-speaking.
The people living in the Carpathian Basin, who were related to the
Magyars, accepted Árpád as their leader. Simon Kezai writes that,
when Árpád's Magyars approached Transylvania, the Szekels went
out to meet them and entered Pannonia with them.[18] Árpád
accepted the Carpathian people into the organization of the new
state. The Magyars did not subjugate the people living in the
Carpathian Basin as the Rumanians and the Slavs propagate. The
Rumanians claim that their ancestors, the Wallachians, (Vlachs) lived
in Transylvania at the time Árpád entered the Carpathian Basin with
his Magyars. It is interesting that there is no documentation that the
Vlachs had to defend themselves from the incoming Magyars. How
is it possible that, if there were so many of them, as they propagate,
they did not hold back the Magyars or the Huns and Avars who
preceded them? There were very few passes through the Carpathian
Mountains through which the Magyars could enter the Carpathian
Basin. The older maps of the region do not show a territory occupied
by Wallachians.
The Magyars entered the Carpathian Basin through the Verecke
Pass in the north and the Lower Danube in the south. Subsequently,
other peoples, the Uz, the Pechenegs and the Kuns, tried to enter
the Carpathian Basin by the same routes but were unable to do so
because the passes were well-defended by the Magyars. The Kuns
were able to settle in Moldavia and Havasalföld and remained there
until the Tatars annihilated them in A.D. 1241. The Vlachs did not
appear until the 1300's.
When we read the "Gesta" of Anonymus, we can see that the
populace voluntarily paid homage to the Magyars and were pleased



to accept them. They pledged their sons into the service of Árpád to
prove their loyalty. If these sons proved themselves worthy and
brave in Árpád's service, he rewarded them with gifts of gold, and
land and entrusted them to guard the castles and the borders giving
them equal rights in the organization of the state. After the fall of the
Avar Empire, there had not been a single well-organized state in the
Carpathian Basin before the arrival of Árpád and the Magyars. As the
Magyars advanced into the Carpathian Basin, they stopped several
times for a celebration, which lasted for days. Pannonia was the last
place that they occupied because they were expecting the greatest
resistance from the Pannonians. However, they encountered very
little resistance except for the representatives of some foreign
powers. Mén Marót, a Frankish feudal lord, when he was ordered to
give up the land that he occupied in Pannonia and surrender it to
Árpád, the rightful heir of Atilla, refused to do so. Árpád then sent an
army against him and, as this army was approaching, the populace
on the way joined Árpád and paid homage to him as the descendant
of Atilla and the rightful heir of this land.
Árpád's soldiers left their families in the territory of Transylvania
until they had occupied the whole Carpathian Basin. The security of
these families was not taken care of by the Magyar army but was
entrusted to the inhabitants of Transylvania, the Szekels, who were
willing to accept the task of protecting them as a related people. At
that time, the Slavs had no kings or leaders of historical importance.
They lived in small groups isolated from each other or in
communities as vassals to some other major power. They slowly
infiltrated more and more, individually, as shepherds or as servants
of one of the other nations. The Vlachs infiltrated in a similar way, but
much later, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. That there was
no sign of the Rumanian language north of the Danube before the
fifteenth century was recently proven by the Rumanian linguist,



Professor Petrovice, at the Academy of Science in Rumania but his
theory was rejected by the Rumanian Daco-Roman historians.
The Magyars of Árpád occupied the city of Atilla, Etzelburg, where
they spent twenty days in celebration. The castles and palaces of
Atilla, built of stone, particularly impressed them. Atilla's city was
built not in Buda, as many historians mistakenly record, but in the
Pilis Mountains, near Esztergom as is recorded in the
Niebelungenlied.
Anonymus writes about the populace who lived in the Carpathian
Basin in A.D. 896. He says that it was a densely populated, fertile
land, populated by a Magyar-speaking peasant people (Scythian
Sarmatian people). They were peaceful shepherds, and farmers and
had so many new masters that when Árpád came in with his
Magyars, they were not alarmed. They did not rise against Árpád
because in their legends they recalled Atilla, the Sword of God, who
was the ancestor of Árpád who came to chase out the Bulgars, Slavs
and Germans who were temporary settlers in that territory. The
people of Árpád organized the populace they found here into a
Magyar state. This ancient populace just found a new master in
Árpád and continued their daily lives as serfs. This ancient populace
of serfs could not have been Slavs since Anonymus does not identify
them as such. He just calls them peasants or serfs. We will find out
what language this populace spoke from the geographical names,
which Anonymus mentions, the majority of which are Magyar. The
Gesta of Anonymus mentions the names of rivers which were
Magyar: Duna, Tisza, Maros, Szamos, Körös, Temes, Olt, Zala, Rába,
and Lake Balaton. They preserve their ancient names in spite of the
fact that many different peoples ruled this land, such as the Celts,
Dacians, Romans, Sarmatians, Huns, Bulgars, Avars, and Germans.
Only the rulers changed, the peasant people remained.



There are numbers of organized cemeteries all across the
Carpathian Basin to witness the fact that the ancient populace
remained there. Cemeteries were excavated in Keszthely, Moson,
Székesfehérvár, Szentes, Szeged and many more towns. The dates
of the graves prove that the Carpathian Basin was populated
continuously from the third century A.D. The people buried their
dead in organized cemeteries before, during and after the time of
Árpád. Among these poor peasant graves, the rich Árpád Magyars
were buried, with colorful gold and silver ornamented belt buckles
and some with harnessed horses. At the time of the people's
migration, they buried their dead in graves 1.5 to 2 meters deep, and
the corpse was always laid down from west to east. The most useful
objects were buried with them. In the eleventh century, the Christian
burial customs came into use. The age of the graves can be easily
determined from the type of burial. Géza Nagy made the
connections between the Scythian and Magyar burials from the
types of graves that he found. József Hampel, as was mentioned
earlier, recognized similarities between the Hun and Sarmatian
peoples by studying their graves. Most recently G. Csallány, at
Szentes, Ferenc Móra at Szeged, Gyula Rhé at Veszprém, excavated
thousands of graves of the different migrating peoples. Csallány
identified the Hun-Magyar connection, Gyula Rhé the Avar-Magyar
connection and Nándor Fettich the connection between the Scythian
artifacts from South Russia and those of the Avars. Obviously
archeologists have been unable to determine the identity of the
ancient populace of the Carpathian Basin.
In the Carpathian Basin can be found geographical names identical
to Sumerian names, which go back to 3000 B.C., which indicates
that they must have had some Sumerian connections. The
Carpathian Basin has always been inhabited by Turanian people,
Scythians, Pannonians, Huns, Avars, Magyars, Sarmatians. The Slavs



who lived there in scattered settlements, called the ancient populace
of the Carpathian Basin "Polovec". This ancient populace called
themselves "Palóc". Today the Palóc people are located in the county
of Nográd in Hungary. This ancient Palóc people joyfully greeted
those tribes among the Árpád Magyars who spoke their language.
We know this from the "Gesta Hungarorum" written by Anonymus.
The people of Árpád appointed them to be the defenders of the
northern part of the Carpathian Basin (today Slovakia). The Magyars
settled in a territory, which had been inhabited for millennia by a
people who were related to them.
The Magyars of Arpád did not disturb the customs and religion of
the people they found in the Carpathian Basin. They cordially
accepted the Christian missionaries. Constantine Porphyrogenitus, in
his work entitled "Tactica", wrote that both the Christians and the
Mohammedans called the Magyars "pagans" but he noted that their
character and integrity evoked respect and that their military
strength was awesome. They did not practice polygamy or human
sacrifice, and were not idol-worshippers but in fact worshipped only
one God. They placed great value on their sworn word and foreign
missionaries who came among them were not killed.[19]
The Magyars who entered the Carpathian Basin, in A.D. 896,
numbered approximately 400,000, a considerable number for that
time in history.[20] These people were the only nation in Europe,
other than the Greeks, who had their own writing system. They
brought with them a thousand years of culture and customs. The
Magyar titles of rank were identical to that of the Assyrians. For
example, the "kashanu", the Assyrian king's Chief Justice, was in
Hungarian "Kusan", Árpád's second-in-command; "salat" was the
prince of a county in Assyrian, and in Hungarian it was "zsolt". In
Akkadian, "siltani" became Sultan in Turkish; and the Assyrian
"tarton", the leader of the army-engineering corps, which is in



Hungarian "tarjan", was the leader of the miners and blacksmiths.
The Assyrian "kundu" was the commander-in-chief of the army,
which in Hungarian was "kende". In Assyrian "harku" was a vice-roy,
which in Hungarian was "horka", just as in Bulcsu Horka.[21]
The people of Europe at that time called the Magyars "Scythians".
Pope Gregory XI, in his Papal Bull, called the Magyars the Royal
Scythians. The Magyars had more animals than all other European
nations possessed. Gardizi, the Byzantine historian, writes that the
Magyars wore furs, silk and brocades, that they carried weapons
ornamented with gold and silver and that they wore undergarments
like all the other Scythians. The civilized Greeks did not even wear
undergarments. The other European nations adopted the use of
undergarments during the wars of the Crusades.
The accepted view of historians is that Árpád's Magyars were a
union of two peoples, the Ugors and the Turks, with the Turks in the
minority. They place this unification outside of the Carpathian Basin.
The skeletal remains of the people of Árpád were examined by Pál
Lipták and his findings were published in 1954. The results of his
anthropological research were the following: 20% Ugor origin and
80% Turkish origin, which is the reverse of the accepted theory. In
the 1930's, according to Lajos Bartucz, the Turanid (Turkic) race
made up 25-30% of the Hungarians, the Eastern Baltic 20% and the
Dinaric 20%, a total of 70%, all of which were round-headed. The
Ugors were not round-headed.[22] In his study in 1992-1993, Dr.
Gyula Henkey states that the Turanid race makes up 30.5% of the
present-day Hungarians, the Turkic race 48.7%, the Pamiroid, 11.7% ,
the Slavic 2.2% and the Finno-Ugric only 4.6% .[23]
The customs and chronicles of the Magyars from Levédia and
Etelköz showed a Turkic influence. According to the archeological
results, Gyula László declares the remains of the Árpád Magyars to



be of Iranian-ScythianTurkish origin.[24] Constantine
Porphyrogenitus calls these people a Turkish speaking people.
The Finno-Ugric theory states that the people of Árpád were
Ugors (Magyars), whose ancestors were ruled by a Turkish minority.
It also states that this Turkish minority gave the Ugors their customs,
culture and military tactics and then the Turks were assimilated into
the Ugors. If we look at the anthropological research, this theory
cannot be substantiated because the physical evidence shows that
the Magyars were 80% Turkic and only 20% Ugors.
We can make another very important conclusion from the skeletal
remains about the male/female ratio among the Magyars. So far 68
skeletons of the Árpád era have been analyzed and 44 of them are
men and 24 women. Lajos Marjalaki-Kiss says that among the Árpád
Magyars there must have been fewer women than men, causing the
Magyar men to marry the women of the ancient populace they found
in the Carpathian Basin. We have only approximate data about the
number of the people of Árpád. According to Ibn Ruszta, an Arab
traveler, when the Magyars were in Levédia, in the eighth century,
they were able to maintain 20,000 horsemen. The populace must
have been approximately 150,000 - 200,000 people. A century later,
joined by the Kabars, this number had increased to approximately
400,000, as they entered the Carpathian Basin. The populace which
they found in the Carpathian Basin must have numbered many times
that of Árpád's people. In present-day Hungary, speaking in
anthropological terms, the ruling element of the Magyar people is of
the Eastern Baltic and the Dinaric race. The Turanic type is found
particularly in the part of Hungary called Kunság, where the
Cumanians settled in the 13th century. Both dominating types, the
Eastern Baltic and the Dinaric can be linked with the skeletal remains
of the ancient populace.



Archeologists excavated many thousands of graves of the ancient
populace in which they found female skeletons with an ornamental
metal band around their head at the temples. Until recently, these
graves have been declared to be Slavic graves. If the ancient
populace were Slavic, then why did the Árpád Magyars not adopt the
Slavic language? The majority always absorbs the minority. The
Árpád Magyars adopted the language of the ancient populace but
gave the name "Magyar" to the nation and to this language.
Therefore the ancient populace spoke the "Magyar" language.
Historians are forced to acknowledge that the women who wore
ornamental metal temple bands were not Slavs. We know that the
numbers of the people of Árpád were small. They could not have
imposed their language on the ancient populace. Because the
language of the present day Hungarians is Magyar, the language of
the ancient populace must have been "Magyar". It was not possible
for the people who wore temple bands to have come into the
Carpathian Basin with the people of Árpád because it can be shown
that they had existed in the Carpathian Basin for millennia. In Levédia
and in Etelköz, where the Magyars had settled before migrating west
to the Carpathian Basin, no temple bands have been found in the
Magyar graves.
The people who wore temple bands must have spoken the
Magyar language because these people gave their language to the
people of Árpád and kept the Magyar language alive. Adorján Magyar
was the first to collect several thousand pages of ethnographic data
of the ancient populace in the Carpathian Basin. Unfortunately,
because of financial problems, this research has never been
published. The research of Lajos Marjalaki-Kiss and Sándor Nagy
supported the theories of Adorján Magyar.
In an attempt to support the Finno-Ugric theory, Gyula László
quotes Károly Mesterházi on the subject of the so-called "ancient



populace" outside of the Carpathian Basin. "Artifacts characteristic
of the ancient populace were excavated at Poltava, Csernigov and
the Oka river territory. The dating of the artifacts from the Oka River
territory and the determination of their ethnic origin is somewhat
inexact and their connection with the Magyars is rather questionable,
yet somewhere in these territories we must research the
development of the material culture of the ancient Magyar people."
[25]
From this quotation we cannot establish that the "ancient
populace" of the Poltava, Csernigov and Oka river territories in
Siberia were identical to the people in the Carpathian Basin whom
historians have up till now called "Slavs", but this is what Gyula
László infers. At the time of the peoples' migrations, only the people
of the conquering nations moved on, but the poor people, the
common people, remained. This ancient people of the Carpathian
Basin did not come in with Árpád, but had been living there for
millennia. Géza Radics asks why we should look for the ancient
Magyar people in the Oka River territory if their connection with the
people of this territory is "questionable". [26]
Bálint Hóman, the greatest Hungarian historian of modern times,
around the time of World War II, had supported the Finno-Ugric
theory but later changed his opinion about the origins of the Magyar
people. The following is a statement from Bálint Hóman: "...it can be
concluded that there was neither a Finno-Ugric ancient people, nor a
Finno-Ugric language, and we should rather call these people the
Finn-Magyar people."[27] Professor Hóman repeated this opinion on
several occasions and he denied any relationship whatsoever with
the Osztyak-Votyak-Manszi people. Sándor Csőke, a noted
Hungarian linguist, also stated that there was no Finno-Ugric
language, that there were no linguistic or historical data that prove
the Finno-Ugric origin of the Magyar people. "This theory was made



up by linguists and historians."[28] Björn Collinder has shown that
the hypothetical Finno-Ugric language lacked 14 phonemes, one of
them the "gy" sound, which is found in the name of the Magyar
people. If the Magyars were descended from a people who did not
have the "gy" sound, why would they have used it in their name?
Sándor Nagy points out that, genetically, there are no similarities
between the Magyars and the Ostyak and Vogul or Finno-Ugric
peoples. The latter do not grow facial hair as do the Magyars and
they have pronounced Mongoloid features. The information and
pictures are taken from Zoltán Trocsanyi: Észak Nómadai.[29]
In contrast to the pictures of the Ostaks and Voguls is the
description of the Magyars by William Ripley: "...it appears that the
Magyars are strikingly fine looking and well-developed people. The
facial features are regular, the nose and mouth well defined. There is
nothing Asiatic or Mongol to be seen." "The present traits of the
Hungarians seem to lend force to the hypothesis that the same race
was also firmly rooted in the Great Danubian Plain before their
appearance."[30] Arthur de Gobineau says: "The Unitarian theory is
backed by such arguments as the following: - "The Magyars are of
Finnish origin and allied to the Laplanders, Samoyeds and Eskimos.
These are all people of low stature, with wide faces and prominent
cheekbones, yellowish or dirty brown in color. The Magyars,
however, are tall and well set up; their limbs are long supple and
vigorous, their features are of marked beauty and resemble those of
the white nations."[31]
According to the Finno-Ugric theory, the language of Árpád and
his people was Magyar and they were the first Magyar settlers in the
Carpathian Basin. However only a few of the "nations", such as the
Megyer nation, spoke Magyar. There are other historians who state
that the majority of the homecoming Magyars were called Turkish



and that their language was Turkish. Du Yaxiong, stated that the
language of the Avars and the Uigurs was identical to that of the
Huns and that the Hun language was a Turkish language. In his book,
mentioned earlier, he writes: "Zang Kian, who was a famous traveler
in ancient China, thoroughly learned that language (Hun) when he
spent ten years in a Hun prison. He was the envoy of the Chinese
Emperor and twice he traveled to the West, in 138 B.C. and 119 B.C.
He was generally regarded as the pioneer who made the first journey
from the middle of China to the West. From his Hun dictionary and
Syntax, I can state that the Hun language was a Turkish language."
[32] Otto Maenchen-Helfen concurs with this statement: "to judge
by the tribal names, a great part of the Huns must have spoken a
Turkish language." [33]
Ferenc Kunszabó questions whether the Magyars were Turkish.
The Magyars of Árpád entered the Carpathian Basin approximately
360 years after the flight of Mohammed. If they were Turks, they
should also have been Mohammedans. There is no record in History
of any nation that gave up the religion of Islam for "paganism", and
sun-worship. There is also no record that the homecoming Magyars
kept in their language the names and titles of Islamic priests. They
always had the Taltos and Magus priests. Kunszabó's third point is
that the contemporary historians called the Magyars a "freedom
loving" people. The Turks accepted Islam with a blind obedience
dictated by the Koran. His final point is that the religion of Islam
forbids the eating of horsemeat. They allowed only cud-chewing
animals to be eaten. The Magyars raised horses and horsemeat was
a staple in their diet. Were they a Turkish people or were they not?
[34]
The homecoming Magyars adopted the language of the ancient
populace, as did the Huns and Avars before them. If the ancient
populace which Árpád found in the Carpathian Basin had been Slav,



as is commonly taught, Árpád's people would have been slavicized.
Therefore, we can make the conclusion that the language of the
ancient common people of the Carpathian Basin was the language
we now call "Magyar". This people was in the majority. The ancient
populace that remained, which was not assimilated by any of the
conquering peoples, was the people who kept their language and,
with time, they gave the language to those who settled among them.
This ancient populace gave names to everything, and because
Árpád's people also learned their language, this is why all the
geographical names are "Magyar". The language of the ancient
people was not analyzed by the Academy of Science, but the time
will come when we cannot postpone any longer the research of
these people. We have to recognize this ancient people because
they gave the present Magyar nation its language and the majority of
its populace. Árpád, the priest-king, the leader of the Megyer
(Magyar) nation, gave the name and statehood to the country and
the name to the language.
In the labyrinth of many different names and peoples, we have to
come to the conclusion that the formation of the Magyar people
cannot be tied to the formation or migration of any of the other
peoples. The formation of the Magyar people cannot be tied to the
Sumerian, Scythian, Hun, Sabirian, Avar, Parthian, Turkish peoples.
Even so, the Magyar people, during their long history, were
connected to the above-mentioned peoples. The Magyar people
were not formed in distant Asia or in the Fertile Crescent, in
Mesopotamia, but were the people of the Kőrős culture, one of the
oldest of the world's civilizations. In the far distant past, many
thousands of years ago, nationality was not important. Survival and
overcoming the hardship of the elements was of prime importance.
The Magyar people were formed in the Carpathian Basin many
thousands of years ago.

THE HOMELAND RECLAIMED
Chapter 7.
Early Man in the Carpathian Basin
According to the most recent archeological findings, the
Carpathian Basin was the cradle of the Magyar people. The
Carpathian Basin was formed by different geological changes and its
history began in the Paleozoic Era in the Carboniferous Period. (500
million years ago) It was roughly its present shape in the Oligocene
and Miocene ages but, in the first period of the Pliocene age, (7
million years ago) the larger part of the Carpathian Basin was
flooded by the sea.
This Pliocene age sea left sediment 400-600 meters deep in



Transylvania and 400 meters deep in Transdanubia (Pannonia). At
the end of the Pliocene age, as a result of a drier climate, the sea
retreated and left dry land. The remains of the Pliocene age are
especially evident in Transylvania in the form of brown coal and rock
salt. In the Ice Age, the peaks of the Carpathian Mountains were
covered with ice, as were all other European mountain peaks. As a
result of the warming of the climate after the Ice Age, the streams
continuously filled the valleys with sediment and slowly the Danube
and Tisza rivers were formed. The rivers all emptied from the
Carpathian Mountains into a natural basin, which became known as
the Carpathian Basin. This is a perfect example of a centripetal water
system.
The Carpathian Basin was a territory inhabited by man almost from
the time man first appeared on earth. We can document the
continuous habitation by man from the most primitive age of
prehistory to the present time.
The earth and man too underwent many changes until they
reached their present forms. We will mention three of the stages of
man's development. First the Neanderthal man, who lived 80,000
years ago and whose remains can be found in Germany, France,
England, China, Belgium, Africa. The characteristics of the
Neanderthal man were a long head, narrow protruding forehead,
large round eye sockets, broad cheekbones, broad nose, heavy
protruding jaw without a chin. He was stocky and short about 155
156 cm. tall.
Secondly, Cro-Magnon man, who lived approximately 35,000
years ago. The Cro-Magnon man was much taller than the
Neanderthal man, 180-184 cm. He had a long head, a cranial index
of 73-76 and a cranial capacity of 1400-1500 cubic centimeters. He
had a high forehead, strong, heavy jawbones and a developed chin.



His limbs were well proportioned. The Cro-Magnon man could be
found all across Europe at that time. Two skeletons with Negroid
characteristics were found in a cave near Menton, France and are
now known as the Grimaldi remains. They were buried at the end of
the last Ice Age and belong to the Aurignacian culture. From this find,
scientists have concluded that, at the end of the Wurm Era, (20,000
years ago), men were already divided into different races.
Thirdly, in the last stage of Man's development, the skull became
shorter (mesocephalic) and then round, (brachycephalic). Examples
of both were found in 1908 in the cave of Offnet in Bavaria, in two
trenches where thirty-three skulls were excavated, 60 percent of
which were mesocephalic and brachycephalic. These findings were
from the end of the Wurm Era, from the Azilian culture (10,000 years
ago).
Since the brachycephalic was the last stage of human
development and the examples excavated were from the end of the
diluvial epoch, anthropologists came to the conclusion that the
development of the human skull progressed from long to short
(dolicocephalic to brachycephalic).
It was necessary for me to explain this development so that we
can evaluate correctly the results of the excavations in the
Carpathian Basin and so that we can prove from the research of
Etelka Toronyi that the Carpathian Basin was inhabited by man
continuously from the time of Homo Primigenius and in this region
man's development progressed rapidly.[1]
Hungarian archeologists had enormous success from the outset
because they found the above-mentioned three stages of man's
development in the Carpathian Basin. Tivadár Kormos found at Tata
stone tools of the Mousterian culture about 80,000 years old. Breul,



a French archeologist, compared the stone tools found by Kormos
with tools from the Mousterian culture of other countries and
declared that the tools at Tata were made by Neanderthal peoples.
József Malasz found, in the cave of Habaponir in the county of
Hunyad, a segment of a toe that was also Mousterian (early Wurm
era). János Danca, in the cave of Subalyuk, County of Heves, found a
complete skeleton of a Neanderthal type. These important findings
prove that Neanderthal people lived in the Carpathian Basin, as in
other parts of Europe.
Hungarian archeologists also successfully excavated Cro-Magnon
(or Homo Sapiens Sapiens) remains from the diluvial strata in the
Carpathian Basin. Etelka Toronyi mentions her professor Jenő
Hillebrand, who found examples of Cro-Magnon remains in different
cultural levels. In 1909, in Repashuta, he found a child's skull in the
Magdalenian strata, about 15,000 years old. In 1912, in a cave at
Pálfi, in the Solutrian strata, he found a child's tooth, about 20,000
years old. Ottokár Kadic, in 1925, in the caves of Eszterház and
Csakvár, found the bones of a forearm in the Solutrian strata. Géza
Mégai, in the vicinity of the city of Miskolc, found a neck-bone in the
Solutrian strata. In 1940, in a cave in the county of Borsod, a jaw was
found in the Solutrian strata, which was declared to be the jawbone
of a Cro-Magnon. We could name many more examples of the Cro
Magnon man, who used polished stone tools, who lived at the end of
the Diluvian Era in the Carpathian Basin and who was the ancestor of
the Caucasian type.
In 1871, Miksa Hantken presented a skull, which he had found in
the cave at Nagysáp in the county of Esztergom, to the May 10
session of the Geological Society. The authenticity of this finding
was accepted by the world's scientists. Rutat, the famed Belgian
professor, suggested that the brachycephalic diluvial age skull be
called the Nagysáp type (Facies brachycephalis de Nagysáp). These



findings prove that at the end of that Diluvium, the most developed
type of man, the brachycephalic type, was found in the Carpathian
Basin. This type in the later Bronze Age made up 36% of the
populace of the Carpathian Basin and the dolicocephalic type was
already diminishing in number.[2]
From the evidence we have presented we can conclude that the
Carpathian Basin was not only the cradle of man's development but
also, as a result of a rapid genetic progression, it was the territory
where different races developed. We shall examine next how man
developed in the Carpathian Basin.
At the time of the appearance of Cro-Magnon man in the
Carpathian Basin, 35,000 years ago, the cultural development of this
territory was already more advanced than that of the rest of the
world. In the Szeleta cave, which is located in the Bükk Mountain in
Northern Hungary, large quantities of leaf shaped spear-heads were
unearthed. Nowhere in the world have others been found with such
perfect forms. The perfect form and workmanship misled scientists
to declare that these well-developed objects belonged to the
Aurignacian culture in the Carpathian Basin, an independent local
development, 30,000 to 20,000 years ago. However, Radio-Carbon
14 analysis and pollen analysis have recently shown that these
objects were from the Wurm I and II interglacial ages (60,000 and
30,000 years ago). From the archeological research in the
Carpathian Basin, it has been shown that during the Wurm I and II
interglacial ages, people were living not only in caves but also in the
open in dwellings built on pillars, arranged in an oval shape. These
dwellings were unearthed on the shores of the rivers Ipoly, Vág,
Hernád, in the territory of the Dunakanyar, the curve of the Danube,
where today the city of Esztergom stands, the shoreline of Lake
Balaton, the territory between the Duna and Tisza rivers, and the
territories of the Olt, Maros and Kőrős rivers. It is interesting to note



that, in Buda, there is a hot spring that is called "Rudás". In the
Hungarian language, the word "rudás" means "provided with poles".
It does not seem possible that a spring would be provided with
poles, but if there had been at one time a settlement of pole
dwellings at this site, the name would be fitting.
In 1955 and 1956, surface excavations proved that the ancient
populace lived not in scattered single dwellings but in a village
system for example in Pilisszentmárton, Pilisszántó, Szob, Zebegény,
Szeged, Othalom, Nográdverőce, where the community life was
probably the first in the world. The Danubian Aurignacian early man
lived in this new type of settlement, 30,000 years ago, thousands of
years before the people of the rest of Europe dared to leave their
caves.
These open settlements were made possible by the thick layer of
loess that was carried and deposited by the glacial winds. This loess
was a very loose soil that stored the water well and was well suited to
primitive agriculture. This explains why these open settlements were
found everywhere on the banks of the rivers. The above-mentioned
surface excavations proved that the ancient man, from the beginning
of the Wurm I-II inter-glacial ages, not only chased and hunted
reindeer, but with stone scrapers (hoes), started to work the land.
Gordon Childe stated that "Danubian Man" cultivated the land along
the banks of the rivers from the River Dráva to the Baltic Sea and the
River Vistula to the Meotis Territory (Sea of Azov). Already in the
Stone Age, they lived in roofed stone houses and in villages built on
pillars. This type of settlement spread out from the Carpathian Basin.
They domesticated animals, pigs, sheep and horses, and had very
few weapons and hunting tools, which means that they were
agriculturalists and not hunter-fishers.[3]
Around the dwellings, researchers found crescent shaped hoes



made of stone the handle of which was made of deer antlers. They
found workshop sites of different sizes where these implements
were made. This proves that, in the Carpathian Basin, agriculture
was so widespread in the Wurm interglacial age that it was
necessary to produce these tools in large quantities. The people
were far enough advanced in their civilization that they were living in
villages and dependent upon each other, developing special trades.
On the hill at Csitár, in the County of Hont, a huge quantity of these
agricultural stone implements were laid down side by side and
covered as if they were being stored. They were new and ready for
use. They were discovered by accident while a farmer was plowing.
These products date back to the end of the third Wurm Ice Age.
These tools predate the polished stone tools of the Neolithic Age.
We must note that such well-developed stone implements, which
were used in the Wurm age, have never been found anywhere else in
the world. Similar objects were found outside of the Carpathian
Basin, but they were much simpler and coarser and belonged to a
much later time. We may conclude that in the Carpathian Basin, in
the Paleolithic Age, in the Aurignacian period, in the Wurm I and II
interglacial ages, we can find open settlements and the beginnings
of agriculture. This was the first agricultural development in the
world. The people of the Carpathian Basin were the first to leave the
security of the cave and begin to build dwellings. From their
observation of nature developed their knowledge of agriculture and
the necessity of the manufacture of large quantities of agricultural
implements.[4] In 5500.B.C. Danubian man had already developed
an export trade. According to Marija Gimbutas, stone tools were
found in a pit in Boldogkőváralja "indicating that the villagers here
clearly specialized in the preparation of stone tools for export."[5]
Sir Leonard Woolley and Jacquetta Hawkes describe the Sesklo
culture of Greece as the oldest culture in Europe which dates back to



6000 and 5000 B.C.[6] Etelka Toronyi calls this culture the Proto
Szekel (Székely) culture, based on archeological findings at the
rivers Olt, Maros and Kőrős and in the territory of Banat. This culture
is also called the Vardar-Morava, Kőrős (Cris), Starcevo or Oltenian
culture.
In the 1950% archeologists of different nationalities found, in the
Olt valley in the county of Háromszék, an ancient city called Erősd.
This city was built in 6000 B.C. with a city plan, with wide streets and
large parks. The citizens lived in comfortable houses of several
rooms, surrounded by gardens. These houses were heated with
colorful ceramic stoves placed in the middle of the house. The arch
of the entrance gate was carved with ornaments and was similar to
that of the present-day Szekel entrance gate. These several
thousand year-old buildings are almost identical to the present-day
Szekel houses. The pride of the Szekel house even today is the
carved entrance gate and the colorful ceramic-covered stove just as
it was in 6000 B.C. (In recent times, many of the Szekel gates
standing in front of Hungarian homes were torn down and burned by
Rumanian officials. Some, like that in the illustration, have been given
a Rumanian name and are claimed to be Rumanian.) Among the ruins
of Erősd, archeologists found baked enameled ceramics,
ornamented with undulating lines, which are identical to the modern
Szekel ceramics. Several similar ceramic objects with animal
symbols in relief were excavated in the Kőrős cultural center. Similar
relief ornamented ceramics were found in other centers only three or
four thousand years later.
Another planned city was excavated in 1967 in the territory of the
Iron Gate, at Lipinski-Vir. Here archeologists excavated a group of
forty-one houses, which were built according to a city plan similar to
that of Erősd. It is worth mentioning that not only is the city plan of
Lipinski-Vir identical to that of Erősd, but also the style of the houses



and the ceramics. Thirty-three small statues representing people
were found here. The carving of the statues shows a highly
developed form of art. The faces of the statues are expressive, very
individual and wear an archaic smile. In the territory of
Hódmezővásáhely, and in some parts of the Hungarian Plain,
hundreds of artifacts were found which were very similar to those of
Erősd. At Kökénydomb archeologists found a colorful headless
statue of a woman, which they called the Venus of Kökénydomb.
This statue is circa 7500 years old.
The aforementioned UNESCO publication mentions two other
cultural centers that are supposedly older than the Kőrős culture.
These are the Natufian and the Jericho cultures. According to Dr.
Etelka Torony, no earlier cultural center attained the same level of
development as the Kőrős culture. The Natufian culture mentioned
by the Unesco publication is 10,000 years old, dating back to the
Neolithic age, and can in no way be regarded as an independent
cultural center because anthropologists found no evidence of the
simplest levels of an early settlement. What they found here were
the earliest agricultural tools of this culture. In the Carpathian Basin,
workshops for the manufacture of agricultural implements and the
remains of group settlements were found which have been dated to
belong to the Paleolithic age, 25,000-30,000 years ago. The other
cultural center of city builders mentioned by Woolley was located in
the Jordan River Valley on the shores of the Dead Sea. Since there
were no ceramics of the Paleolithic Age found in the lowest strata of
Jericho, Dr. Etelka Toronyi states that Sir Leonard Woolley's
chronology is incorrect, when he dates Jericho before Kőrős. In the
second level of Jericho, which could be the same age as the Kőrős
and Erősd cultures, ceramics were found which indicate the level of
the cultural standard of that time. The ceramics which were found
here are much more primitive than those of the Kőrős and Erősd



cultures. The walls of the ceramics are thick, formed by hand not on
the wheel, and badly glazed. None of the ceramics of Kőrős and
Erősd, was as primitive as those of Jericho II. Even in the highest
level of Jericho, no ceramics were found which were made on the
potter's wheel, not to mention the ceramics ornamented in relief.
Statues were found and pottery ornamented with designs of human
figures, but these are all very roughly formed statues and cannot be
compared with the much more artistic statues of the Kőrős culture in
the Kökénydomb and Irongate territories.
From the above mentioned facts we can see that the first
Neolithic Age city-cultures were created by the Proto-Szekels. It is
interesting to note that the most ancient Sumerian culture, the Al
Ubaid culture, is much younger than the Kőrős, Erősd and Lipinski Vir
cultures. The Proto-Szekels developed the techniques of wheel
thrown ceramics, highly-glazed ceramics, and also the building
techniques which spread to the Balkan Peninsula, to the Aegean Sea
shoreline and the offshore islands, to Asia Minor, to the territories of
the Mediterranean Sea, the territory of Caucasia, the Aral Sea
territories and the Far East. The beginnings of the Danubian I and II
cultures and the other western cultures were all found in the Kőrős
Culture. According to Dr. Etelka Toronyi, as the Proto-Szekels
produced their glazed ceramics, they discovered the secret of
smelting metals. The smelting of metals takes place at a temperature
of 1700 degrees Celsius and above, which the Szekels employed for
their glazing. They lived in a territory, Transylvania, where not only
copper but also tin could be found in veins and in ores. Therefore, we
can make the conclusion that the Szekel people were the first people
to discover bronze. This statement is supported by the large number
of bronze artifacts found in the Carpathian Basin. The fact that
almost every tool made of copper found in the Carpathian Basin was
a replica of polished Stone Age tools, allows us to conclude that the



Proto-Szekels used copper at a very early period in history. The
copper objects found in Transylvania were of a very high level of
workmanship. Bracelets, arm-ornaments, brooches and buckles
were found in large quantities and of very fine workmanship, seen
nowhere else in the world. Dechelette, the famed French Bronze-Age
researcher made a list of the locations and ages of the articles
found. This list shows that the most primitive Bronze Age objects in
Western Europe date to 2000 B.C. but in the Carpathian Basin, the
bronze objects made by the Szekels date back to 4000 B.C. and a
bronze adze found in the county of Torontál, which is inscribed with
the Szekel Runic Script, dates back to 5000 B.C.
Jan Briand compared the bronze findings of Asia and Europe and
stated that the adzes, spiral brooches, bracelets and buckles from
Transylvania are the most remarkable remains of the Bronze Age.[7]
The rich appearance of the bronze articles and their many different
forms lead us to conclude that the Proto-Szekels were the first to
make bronze from copper and tin. Not only on the basis of
archeology can we state that the creators of the pre-historic culture
were the Proto-Szekels, but we can prove from the metrical analysis
of anthropology that the direct descendants of the Proto-Szekels are
the present-day Szekels and Magyars. A bronze adze found in
Tordos witnesses to the fact that the first forms of writing existed in
the Carpathian Basin, 7000 years ago. We can be sure that the
inscription on the bronze adze is really a form of writing because the
objects excavated at Tordos by Zsófia Torma, ceramics and round
seals, are inscribed with markings identical to those on the bronze
adze. These ceramics and round seals are dated to be from the
same period as the adze. This important collection of articles
inscribed with the Runic Script was studied by Dr. Mátyás Fehér
whose conclusions were published posthumously by his wife, in two
volumes.[8] The Szekel Runic Script of today shows a strong



resemblance to the script on the bronze adze of Tordos and the
ceramics and seals excavated by Zsófia Torma.
John Dayton's research supports the conclusions of Etelka
Toronyi: "The European Bronze Age preceded that of the Near East.
The same pattern is apparent in the development of glazing and its
allied craft, metallurgy."[9] Writing of the production of bronze
artifacts in the Near East, he says: "Tin does not exist in the Near
East and came from China or from Europe (Bohemia)"[10] He points
out that native copper did not exist in Egypt and that in Central
Europe and the Carpathians, large quantities of native copper, gold
and silver are to be found.[11]
Kálmán Miske, a Hungarian archeologist, already in the early
1900ʼs informed us of the results of the excavations at Velem St. Vid
in Hungary. He offered indisputable proofs that Bronze Age mining
contributed to the spread of bronze artifacts in Western Europe.[12]
Antimony was mined in the Rohonc Mountain in Burgenland (Western
Hungary) near Velem St. Vid. This Hungarian territory was given to
Austria in 1920 at the Treaty of Trianon. The antimony mines are still
in use today. The Hungarian name for the mining area was Szalonak.
Its present name is Schlaining. The majority of the artifacts found in
the three excavations at Velem St. Vid are presently on display at the
museum at Szombathely. There must have been a large population
at Velem St. Vid in the Bronze Age for John Dayton, quoting Kalman
Miske, says: "This site has also yielded tuyeres, crucibles, and some
fifty stone moulds, mostly for socketed axes, and must have been a
very important production centre."[13] He later says: "Evidence is in
fact accumulating for trade over a large area of Western Europe
during the Third Millennium."[14] Most of the Bronze Age artifacts,
hand-wrought or cast in a mold, which can be found in the museums
of Western Europe, originated from Velem St. Vid. Miske mentions
that, already in the Bronze Age, bronze was made from an alloy of



copper and tin but the Velem St. Vid process was an exception
because it used antimony instead of tin. It is an indisputable fact that
antimony bronze was developed at Velem St. Vid. John Dayton
supports this conclusion and again reinforces the fact that antimony
is not mined in the Near East.[15]
Elemér Csobánczi writes that an artifact of antimony and gold was
found in the grave of the Egyptian Pharaoh Kheneri of the Second
Dynasty. He quotes A.R. Burne who says that the two metals, gold
and antimony, can only be alloyed by the use of a catalyst, a third
metal called Tellurium. Geologists have found only three places
where the three metals can be found together, in natural form - in
Australia, North America and in Zalatna, Transylvania. We can
conclude that the Egyptians received these metals from
Transylvania.[16]
Gordon Childe states that, in the Bronze Age, the alloy electrum
was made of two parts gold and one part silver. This process was
known in only four places, the Carpathian Basin, Troy, the Caucasus
and Mesopotamia.[17]
The ancient name for Szombathely indicates the nature of the
ancient people who inhabited this region. The original name was
Szabaria, which means a settlement of Szabir/ Szubar people
(Subareans). The Subareans were a Mesopotamian people and the
accepted theory of diffusion states that they migrated from
Mesopotamia to the Carpathian Basin. Dayton, however, proves that
"from a geological point of view and in view of the archeological
evidence, the Hungarian/Bohemian Basin offers all the elements for
the discovery of metallurgy."[18] He also states: "It is also quite clear
that the metallurgical wealth of Mesopotamia was developed from
Central Europe."[19] Dayton contends that the movement of peoples
was the reverse of that accepted by historians. His theory is that



because of an intense drought at the end of the Fourth Millennium in
Europe "there was a movement of peoples into the Mediterranean
and Near East, if not into Egypt."[20] The ancient people, already in
the Bronze Age, using sailboats, reached the island of Crete, Asia
Minor, Egypt and Africa.
It should be no surprise that the Carpathian Basin was a densely
populated area during the Bronze Age, when we consider that man
had lived in this area for millennia. Archeologists have found human
remains of 94 people dating back 2.5 million years. The skull found
at Vertesszöllős dates back 500,000 years.[21] In the Neolithic Age,
one of the most important materials used by ancient man to make
weapons and tools was obsidian. Three obsidian mines were found in
the Carpathian Basin, at Tarcsal, Tokay and Csitár, where large
numbers of tools were manufactured. By natural progression the
population increased and this area was densely populated in the
Bronze Age. Elek Fényes writes that the trade routes for obsidian and
salt began in the Carpathian Basin and that amber, shell and silk
routes crossed the Carpathian Basin. It is a known fact that trade
routes always passed through populated areas.[22]
The main requirement of the economical production of an article is
that the raw material should be worked close to the place it was
mined, thereby reducing the expense of transportation. This was all
the more important in an era when the finished product was
transported by carriage on bad roads. The amulets found at Tartaria
in Rumania, (formerly Tatarlaka, Hungary), are proof that civilization
originated in Transylvania. An ancient form of writing on these
amulets, which date back to 5000 B.C., places the discovery of
writing in Transylvania rather than in Sumer. Similarly the invention of
the wheel can be credited to the ancient people of the Carpathian
Basin. "The earliest certain evidence for a wheeled vehicle comes
from the pottery model of a wagon found at Budakalász in Hungary,



in a Baden Culture burial of about 2900-2400 B.C."[23]
Zsófia Torma tells us that this wagon was a "burial wagon" in
which the people of the Carpathian Basin used to send their loved
ones to the afterlife, just as the Vikings sent their dead on their
journey in ships.[24] She points out that, according to the research
of Nandor Fettich and Stuart Piggott, many wagons have been found
in the Carpathian Basin and in Mesopotamia. This would indicate that
the people who migrated from the Carpathian Basin not only traveled
by wagon but also brought with them their burial customs to
Mesopotamia.
John Dayton says: "It is also curious that the horse and the first
wheeled vehicles (probably pulled by oxen) also appeared in Europe
during the early part of the Third Millennium, perhaps about 2800
B.C. The horse is of the Asiatic type, the Tarpan or the Przewalski
horse, and so it appears that the farmers and pastoralists who
spread into Europe during the Fourth Millennium with horses,
originated in the steppes of southern Russia or central Asia, and not
necessarily in the Near East."[25] He mentions that in 1950, Piggott
pointed out that a domesticated horse appears with the Copper Age
in Hungary, with the Tiszapolgar/Baden culture.
Ferenc Móra excavated Bronze Age skeletons in the villages of
Szöreg, Pitváros, Tökö1 and Ószentivány. If we compare the cranial
index and somatic or physical data of his findings to those of the
present Szekel people, we see that they are almost identical. If we
study the cranial characteristics of the Bronze Age people and those
of the Szekels, we will find that the same percentage of each type of
skull appears in each group. In other words, the dolicocephalic,
mesocephalic and brachycephalic are represented in the same
proportions in each group. The cranial index mean is 81.3 for both
groups. The hyper-brachycephalic is 5.6% in both groups. Both



groups have the same percentage of mesocephalics - 76% to 80%.
At the same time the eastern racial characteristics are noticeable in
the faces of both groups. The only difference is that the present day
Szekel man has grown from 161 to 166 cm. while the woman has
grown from 149 to 155 cm. but this is a general occurrence. As time
has passed, there has been some mixture with other peoples, but
the characteristics of the ancient people have predominated.[26]
Calvin Gebhart, in The Races of Mankind, states that the Szekels
are the oldest and purest branch of the Magyars. Elemer Csobánczi
says that the ancient populace of the Carpathian Basin has survived
to the present day in such groups as the Kalotaszeg Magyars, the
Szekels of Erősd, the Barkok and the Torockok.[27]
I shall attempt to prove that, in the Bronze Age, because of over
population and drought, some of the Proto-Szekels and Proto
Magyars migrated from the Carpathian Basin in carriages and they
populated territories which at that time were not populated or just
sparsely populated. I shall also attempt to prove that they carried
with them their ancient culture and technical knowledge, their
religious views, customs, legends and folktales and that, in different
eras, when they were in distress, they returned to their ancient land
under different names and found refuge in the Carpathian Basin.
They even came back as conquerors or returned to give help to their
brothers who were in trouble in their ancient land, for example, the
Avars returned to help the Huns and the Magyars returned to aid the
Avars.
We are going to start by examining those peoples who, according
to Hungarian legends, are relatives of the Magyars. By examining
their cultural treasures and anthropological data we will prove that
these peoples were related to the ancient Bronze Age people of the
Carpathian Basin. First we will examine the connections with the



Sumerian people because modern unbiased linguists appear to
prove the Sumerian-Magyar connections. This is not the place to
prove this connection by linguistic analysis; there are many books
that do this, but I find it very important to mention the
anthropological data of the Sumerian people.
The physical characteristics of the Sumerian people bore a
striking resemblance to those of the Bronze Age people of the
Carpathian basin, according to Etelka Toronyi. They were entirely
different from the Semitic people who later settled among them. The
Sumerians were generally of the mesocephalic and brachycephalic
type, just like the Bronze Age Carpathian people and the present
Szekels. The strong, well-developed nose, the strong chin and
certain eastern elements around the eyes and the face are apparent
in all of them. The Sumerians and the Bronze Age Carpathian people
were identical in height, 155-165 cm.
The cultural connections between the Sumerians and the Bronze
Age Carpathian people are easier to present than the somatic
similarities. Sir Leonard Woolley, in the lowest cultural level of the city
of Ur, discovered well-developed bronze objects that had no
primitive characteristics. This indicates that a new ethnic group
appeared in this territory and brought with them the knowledge of
bronze metallurgy. In the upper and topmost levels, the bronze
artifacts completely disappeared, according to Woolley. Etelka
Toronyi explains that, at that time, a new conquest or war cut off the
route to the territory from which the Sumerians were obtaining the
tin that was necessary for the manufacture of bronze. John Dayton
says: "Glazing dies out in Mesopotamia after the conquest of
Babylon and Persia by Alexander, to reappear with the Parthians in
the first century B.C."[28] The ethnic group of people, who carried
with them the knowledge of the process of making bronze, were the
ancestors of the Szekels, the Proto-Szekels. This is proven by the



fact that the bronze objects found in Sumer were completely
identical in composition to those of the Carpathian Basin. The spiral
motif, which is so characteristic of the Carpathian Basin bronze
objects, can also be found on the bronze artifacts of the Sumerians.
The brooches, fasteners, and hairpins excavated in Sumer all bear
the motif that is found on similar artifacts found in the Carpathian
Basin. The bronze objects in the Carpathian Basin predate those of
Mesopotamia by thousands of years. Every stage in the development
of bronze can be found in the Carpathian Basin. This is why we can
state that the Szekel emigrants took with them the knowledge of the
production of bronze to Mesopotamia.
I have previously stated that the Szekels believe themselves to be
the direct descendants of the Huns. Writers contemporary with the
Huns described the Huns as stocky, with a wide chest and a strong,
muscular, well-developed upper-body. All the sources agreed that
their heads were round and they had well-defined cheekbones. To
point out the connections between the Huns and the Carpathian
Basin Bronze Age men, Etelka Toronyi mentions one of the rituals of
the Huns. It is not known why it was developed. Hippocrates was the
first to mention this ritual, approximately 2400 years ago. He wrote
that beyond the Meotis Marsh lived a people who, after the birth of a
child, started to shape their newborn baby's head, which was still
soft, by tying bandages around it in order to help it to become
longer. This description was regarded as a fairy-tale until the end of
the nineteenth century when Karl Ernst von Bauer, a German scholar,
found the kind of skull described by Hippocrates, in the Crimean
Peninsula. After this, anthropologists began to search for this kind of
skull that they called macrocephalic or distorted. From time to time
they found a few of these distorted skulls but the largest number of
these skulls was found in the Carpathian Basin. Until now, 47 of them
have been found. The interesting thing about this is that some of



these distorted skulls were found in the Bronze Age cemeteries of
Tökö1, Székelyudvárhely and Arad-galy. This fact proves that this
custom of binding the heads of babies goes back to four or five
millennia B.C. Such ancient macrocephalic skulls have never been
found anywhere else. A few that were found were of a much later
date.
One group of anthropologists concentrated on finding out where
this custom began and which nation continued to practice this
custom. They discovered that Bronze Age macrocephalic skulls were
found in the Carpathian Basin. It was more difficult to find out which
nation continued to practice this custom. In 2000 B.C.,
macrocephaly appears to have been discontinued in the Carpathian
Basin, but it appears to have been reintroduced by the Huns.
Macrocephalic skulls were founds in Hun graves of the sixth century
A.D., in the Carpathian Basin. Dr. Etelka Toronyi concludes that at the
end of the Bronze Age, a group of people migrated from the
Carpathian Basin and took with them their custom of skull distortion.
This tribe must have been a leading tribe and this custom was used
to single out certain people or the leaders. In every territory where
the Huns settled, this skull distortion was discovered. The distorted
skull was probably a sign of rank. To support this theory, there is a
visible example. In China, the leaders or great men were represented
with large heads - Lao Tse and Confucius; in India - Buddha.
In the Hungarian language the term "fő" (head) is still used to
denote rank - főember (head man or leader), főnök (boss), fővezér
(commander-in-chief), főrangú (noble, aristocratic) and so on. This
custom of distortion was carried world-wide by the Huns and it was
the Huns who initially took this custom out of the Carpathian Basin
and who took it back to the Carpathian Basin when they returned
with Atilla. Why did the Huns choose the Carpathian Basin as the
center of their empire? They chose it because they knew that it was



their ancient homeland.
The history of the Avars is closely connected to the history of the
Carpathian Basin. For almost 300 years, the Avars ruled the same
territory as the Huns did before them. Kagan Bajan chose the same
place as the center of his Empire. He was called back to the Duna
Tisza territory to aid the Huns because he knew that the Huns and
Avars were related. The skeletons found in the Avar graves reveal
that the somatic measurements of the Avar people were identical to
those of the Bronze Age people. Their average height was 163 cm.
and their cranial index was 79/80, which is the measurement of the
mesocephalic skull. The physical characteristics of the Avars were
very different from those of every other group which migrated
through the Carpathian Basin, the Goths, Gepids, Lombards, but
they were identical to the Huns.[29]
In the following cemeteries were found the distorted skulls: Gáter,
Mosonszentjános, Ceben, Keszthely, Üllő, Kiskőrős, Osku. Among
the several hundreds of Avar skulls that were excavated, were found
a few which were identical to the Hun macrocephalic skulls. The fact
that among the Avar skulls distorted skulls were found, which are
characteristic of the Carpathian Basin Bronze Age people and the
Huns, indicates that the Avars also originated from the Carpathian
Basin. Although archeologists have not yet found any examples of
the distorted skulls among the remains of the Magyars, the custom
did not die out with the Avars. In Hungary, at different times, laws
have been published to prohibit this custom. Istvgn Veszprémi, the
chief physician of the city of Debrecen, in 1760, reminded the
midwives not to bind the baby's head with bandages or use any
artificial means of molding the baby's head. Károly Szeli wrote in
1777, in his book entitled: A Magyar Baba Mesterség: "The midwife
should not under any circumstances form the baby's head."



András Lugosi-Fodor, chief physician and Judge of the County
Court of the County of Doboka, in 1817, wrote in his book entitled:
Asphixia Neonatorum that the two major reasons for the death of
newborns was that they were dropped on their head and their heads
were formed with bandages or by hand. Samuel Dombi, the chief
physician of the County of Borsod, in 1807, forbade all methods of
molding the head of a newborn.[30]
Among the people of Palóc and Matyó, the custom of wearing an
elongated headdress probably originated from the ancient custom of
forming the head of the newborn.
The anthropological data of the Árpád Magyars are identical to the
data of the Bronze Age people of the Carpathian Basin. This would
indicate that their ancestors lived in the Carpathian Basin and that at
some point in history these people left their homeland, returning at a
later date as Magyars, with the knowledge that this was their ancient
home just as the Huns and the Avars did before them.
Trepanation or cutting into the skull was successfully employed
already in the Bronze Age, as can be seen from the excavations at
Szöreg and Pitváros. It is obvious that the patients survived the
operation because the incisions on the skulls found here had healed.
The use of trepanation in the Carpathian Basin appears to have been
discontinued abruptly at the end of the Bronze Age, between 2000
and 1500 B.C. but reappeared in A.D. 900. Many skulls were
unearthed dating to the period between 1500 B.C. and A.D. 900, but
none of them showed evidence of trepanation. Not only did the
practice of trepanation disappear at the end of the Bronze Age but
also the practice of skull-distortion. The latter returned to the
Carpathian Basin with the Huns and the practice of trepanation
returned with the people of Árpád. In the graves of the Árpád
Magyars many skulls were found to have undergone trepanation and



the edges of the incisions all healed, which indicates that the
patients all survived. Etelka Toronyi describes a very successful
trepanation that took place in about A.D. 900 on a skull that was
excavated at Verebely. It appears that the cranium was pierced by a
club. The surgeon trepanned the edge of the wound and inserted a
silver plate inside a cap that fitted tightly over the open area. Thus
the cranium was protected from infection. We know that it was a
success because the edges of the wound healed.[31]
Many peoples passed through the Carpathian Basin but none of
their graves contained a trepanned skull. Such skulls were found
only in the graves of the Árpád Magyars. No other nation of this
period appears to have had the knowledge of the practice of
trepanation.
The data found in the Carpathian Basin convincingly prove that
the ancient people of the Carpathian Basin had a more developed
civilization than other peoples of the same era. They also prove that
this territory has been inhabited continuously throughout history.
The fact that certain related peoples living outside of the Carpathian
Basin, such as the Pechenegs, Jazigs, Cumanians, Matyó, and
Szemere, saught refuge there when they were in danger, and the
fact that others, such as the Magyars, came to the aid of those living
inside the Carpathian Basin, the Avars, proves that the knowledge of
their origins was never lost and they all returned to their place of
origin.
The Carpathian Basin was the territory where man first used
chipped stone as tools or weapons, first used polished stone tools
and where men first left their caves and started to build dwellings in
open territory. The first villages and cities of the world were built in
the Carpathian Basin. The beginnings of art are also found here, for
example the smiling stone statue, and the multicolored, highly



glazed, disk-thrown pottery. This is where copper tools were
developed into bronze tools, where agriculture developed, where the
first system of writing was developed and the wheel was invented.
The agricultural demographical boom and unfavorable climatic
conditions forced this ancient people of the Carpathian Basin to
migrate on horseback and with horse drawn carriages carrying with
them throughout the world the knowledge of how to make bronze.

THE HOMELAND RECLAIMED
Chapter 8
The Discovery of Writing
Zsófia Torma, already in the 1800s, found near Tordos (now
Turdas in Rumania) a large number of ceramics decorated with signs
similar to those on Sumerian and Trojan pottery.[1] The Hungarian
Academy of Science did not acknowledge this discovery but
contemporary foreign historians, researchers of the Sumerians,
accepted her conclusions and acclaimed her work. In 1961, N.
Vlassa, a Rumanian archeologist, excavated a settlement at Tatárlaka
(now Tartaria, in Rumania), 18-20 kilometers from Tordos and, on the
lowest level, found 26 burned clay idols and 3 amulets on which
writing is clearly visible. This writing closely resembles the
prehistoric writing of Jamdet Nasr.[2]



The Tatárlaka (Tartaria) tablets
In 1965, Adam Falkenstein, a German archeologist, stated that the
art of writing was developed at Tatárlaka under Sumerian influence.
At the same time, M.S. Hood stated that the Tartaria amulets have no
connection to writing. He stated that the Sumerian merchants
brought these amulets with them and the people of Tatárlaka just
copied them without any knowledge or understanding. This infers
that the people of Tatárlaka never knew the meaning of the text,
although they used the amulets for their religious ceremonies.
Historians in general give very little credibility to the theory that the
Sumerian people might have migrated out of the Carpathian Basin
and could have taken with them the aforementioned knowledge,
religion and folklore to Mesopotamia. The majority of historians are
of the opinion that civilization progressed from south to north and,
as the last Ice Age retreated, the territories that became free of ice
were gradually populated. The announcement of Boris Perlov that
the Tartária amulets were made of local clay exploded this opinion.



He said that the signs on the amulets were the remains of a
widespread writing system. His C-14 analysis placed them at 5000
B.C. or approximately 1000 years older than the Al Ubaid findings
and 2000 years older than the Minoan ceramics.
The Tatárlaka signs were written by impressing the letters onto
the soft clay surface, which was then baked. This discovery that the
technique of "Sumerian" writing was first used in Tatárlaka shocked
the scientific world. It meant that this writing technique was taken
from here to Mesopotamia. The Tartaria tablets resemble the
Tordos-Vinca ceramic shards. This is proof that the Tatárlaka signs
were not a local development but a major part of the epigraphic
writing of the Vinca culture which dominated in the sixth and fifth
millennia B.C.[3]
According to Sándor Forrai, all writing systems are
interconnected. Historians in general have not considered this
possibility. If they had taken this into consideration they would have
discovered that the Árpád Magyars were not barbarian illiterates. In
the ninth century, they possessed the most advanced abbreviated
writing system, the runic script.[4]
According to Forrai, writing developed in the Carpathian Basin
and became more sophisticated in Mesopotamia. Among the ten
signs on the Tartaria tablets, six are identical to the characters of the
Magyar runic script. One of them was the double cross, which
represents the "gy" sound. In Sumerian the double cross represents
the sceptre, the sign of the ruler, which is translated as PA. Similar
runic signs were found in the Balkan Peninsula. The connection
between the Tordos, Tatárlaka, Balkan, Cretan, Minoan, Egyptian,
and Mesopotamian writing systems was presented by Jovan
Todorovich, a Croatian historian who specialized in writing systems.
[5]



In Mesopotamia, the Sumerians developed the pictographs into a
system of ideograms, in approximately 3,500 B.C. The infinitive was
expressed by combined pictographs, which became an ideogram.
For. example, the verb "to eat" was expressed by the pictograph of
bread in the pictograph of the mouth. The syllables that included
consonants were expressed with suffix signs. This was possible
because their language was agglutinative, as is the Hungarian
language. They used written determinatives that were not
pronounced, for example the eight-armed cross or star, which
indicated "DINGIR" - divine or heavenly connections. In time the
eight armed cross was simplified to the single cross in cuneiform,
which later became the same sign in the Magyar runic script and
represented the phoneme "D". In no other runic script did it have the
"D" sound. The Sumerian pictographic writing influenced the
Egyptian pictographs. Because the Egyptians used this writing
primarily in their churches and on their statues, the pictographs
became called hieroglyphs, which means holy carvings.
Chambell, an English researcher, writes that in Upper Egypt, in the
city of Karnak, on the wall of one of the temples, it is written in
hieroglyphs, that in the empire in the reign of the Pharaoh Tutmoses
III, there lived a people called the Maghars who were fighting on the
side of the Hittites. The hieroglyphic text mentions the cities of Arad,
Árpád and Maghara in the land of the Maghars. (Arad is also the
name of a Hungarian city which was given to Rumania in 1920.) The
name Maghar is almost identical to the Sumerian name MAH-GAR
and the Hungarian name Magyar. Since the signs of the Magyar runic
script most closely resemble those of the Phoenician runic script and
Hungarian city names appear in that region, it would indicate that the
Magyars lived here at the time of the development of the runic script.
This runic script spread to Inner Asia among the Turkic peoples and
spread to the west among the Etruscans in the Italian peninsula and



the Pelasgians in the Greek islands. The early Greek and Latin
speaking peoples also used the runic script. Forrai made a table that
shows fifty percent similarity between the Magyar and Phoenician
runic scripts and forty-four percent resemblance between the
Magyar and Etruscan runic scripts. There was only a twenty-eight
percent resemblance to the Old Turkic runic script. This disproves
the theory that the Magyar runic script developed from the Turkish.
The Glagolitic, Cyrillic or other scripts do not resemble the Magyar
runic script.
The reason that the runic script is written from right to left is that,
in early times, the script was carved onto horizontal, rectangular
wooden rods. The rod was held in the left hand and the runes were
carved with the right hand, so it was logical that it would read from
right to left. Even the earliest Latin writings were written from right to
left. The direction changed when papyrus replaced wood. The
earliest carved script was called epigraphic script. This later became
paleographic writing when papyrus was used. The special
characteristic of the Magyar runic script was its ability to abbreviate.
Abbreviation was necessary because carving on wood was a long
and tiresome task. The scribe-carver made the best use of the
materials and time available. These abbreviations always followed
the rules of the Hungarian grammar. The same methods were used
approximately one thousand years later by those who developed the
Hungarian shorthand writing. In 1598, János Telegdi wrote his Latin
Rudimenta, which explained the rudiments of the Magyar runic
script, for use in school.[6] He wished to reinstate the use of the old
Hungarian runic script into the Hungarian public life, because this is
the only suitable writing system to express the Hungarian speech
perfectly. For every phoneme there is an individual sign. Thirteen
Hungarian phonemes cannot be expressed by the Latin alphabet.
This is why approximately one thousand years was needed to



perfect the expression of Hungarian phonetics in the Latin alphabet.
For example, we have to use two letters to express the Hungarian
phoneme "gy" as in Magyar. In the runic script there is an individual
sign for the sound "gy". Similarly, the Magyar phonemes "sz", "ty",
"zs" and others have to be expressed by two letters in the Latin
alphabet.
The first agricultural settlements appeared in the Balkan Peninsula
in the 6th millennium B.C. How did the early farmers live? They lived
in mud huts and they cultivated the land with stone tools. The main
crop was barley. At the end of the 5th. millennium B.C. houses
appeared with clay walls. The frame of the house was made of wood;
the walls were woven out of twigs and covered with clay mud. The
house was heated with a large earthenware stove. When the house
deteriorated with age, it was demolished, levelled to the ground and
a new one was built on top of the ruins. Thus the ancient settlements
were built one on top of the other, just as the Sumerian cities in later
times. In time, the farmers learned how to use the axe and other
tools, which they made of bronze.
What did the ancient populace of Transylvania look like? The large
number of statues found during the excavations help us to form a
picture of them. They portray a peaceful manly face with a well
developed nose. The hair was parted with a comb and braided at the
back of the neck. (The Huns, Avars and Magyars wore their hair in
the same way.) It is interesting that the 5000 year-old man, recently
discovered in the Alps and nicknamed "The Ice-man", in
reconstruction also had a well-developed nose with a high bridge.[7]
The statues of women are covered with geometric designs. The
same designs can be found on statues from the earlier Tordos
settlements. These lines, cunningly folded into each other, had some
meaning in the past, maybe tattoos that could have been fashionable



at that time, or maybe a magical fantasy, whose meaning we do not
know today. At that time the fertility cult was widespread, and many
statues of the fertility goddess have been found. A pitcher from the
early Vinca culture is decorated with a drawing which was probably a
picture of a tabernacle seen from outside. The early Sumerian
tabernacle is very similar in appearance. Is this another coincidence?
Two thousand years separate the two tabernacles. T.S. Passek,
Doctor of History of the Soviet Academy of Science, appointed V.
Titov, an archeologist, to research the question of "Sumerians" in
Transylvania. Titov came to the following conclusions:
1. The Tartaria tablets were created locally and the signs on them
were the remains of a widely used writing system.
2. The text of one of the tablets names six ancient totems which
are identical to those on a list found at the Sumerian city of Jamdet
Nasr and also to those on the burial stamps of the Kőrös (Starcevo)
culture, which predated the Vinca culture and is the predecessor of
all other cultures.
3. The signs should be read counter-clockwise.
4. The meaning of the texts (using a Sumerian decipherment)
seems to indicate that the ancient Transylvanians conducted ritual
killings. At Tatárlaka a mutilated man's skeleton was found, which
would seem to prove this.
5. The local god named SAUE is the equivalent of the Sumerian
god USZMU. The translation of one of the tablets indicates that the
god SAUE, commanded the ritual burning of the tenth leader of the
tribe in the 40th year of his rule.[8]
What do the Tartaria tablets reveal? There are many theories but,
as yet, there is no definitive answer. A unified study of the Tordos



Vinca cultural remains could probably provide the solution. What do
the Tartaria tablets tell us about the people who wrote the Sumerian
language before the country of Sumer actually existed? Dr. Titov
asks if they might be the ancestors of the Sumerians.
Some historians believe that the proto-Sumerians separated from
a people who were living north of the Caucasus in Gruziya (present
day Georgia), settled for a time in Kurdistan and later finally settled in
Mesopotamia. Dr. Titov asks how they were able to give their
knowledge of writing to the peoples of South East Europe. As yet
there is no answer to this question.
The Kőrös (Starcevo) and Balkan cultures exerted a great
influence on the culture of Asia Minor. We can see the influence of
the Tordos-Vinca culture on the Aegean culture. The epigraphic
writing on the ceramics found in the legendary Troy is identical to
that on the ceramics of the Tordos-Vinca culture. Dr. Titov states
that the primitive writing system of the Aegean culture goes back to
the fourth millennium B.C. and was influenced by the Balkan and
Mesopotamian cultures. Other historians support his conclusions,
notably John Dayton and Sir Leonard Woolley.
Here it should be noted that, in the fifth millennium B.C., the
creators of the Vinca culture migrated through Asia Minor into
Kurdistan and Huzistan and settled there as proto-Sumerians. In this
territory, shortly after they arrived, the epigraphic writing-system
known as the Proto-Elamite writing system was developed, which
was very similar to the earlier Tatárlaka and the later Sumerian
writing.
It is now clear that the people who developed writing were not the
Sumerians but the ancient populace of Transylvania. What other
explanation could there be for the fact that the most ancient



Sumerian writing found in Mesopotamia, which was dated to the
fourth millennium B.C., appeared in an already well-developed form?
The Sumerians, in Mesopotamia, used the same epigraphic writing
as the people of the Carpathians and Balkans and developed it into
pictographs and cuneiform.[9] In their tablets they do not call
themselves "Sumerian". This name was given to them in the 19th.
century by the western historians. They called themselves MAH
GAR.
The Tartaria amulet has been deciphered using the Sumerian
language. Dr. Titov deciphered it into Russian. Sándor Székely
deciphered it into Hungarian and with the help of Dr. Ferenc Badiny
Jós, refined the decipherment using the Sumerian Lexicon of
Professor René Labat. Dr. Badiny states that all other decipherments
are incorrect:
The Tartaria Amulet
"The reason for the error in decipherment was that those who



deciphered the tablets did not notice that the hole above the vertical
line of the cross which divides the disk into four segments was part
of a Sumerian pictograph (Labat No.74) GIDIM, which means
demon." This decipherment by Sándor Székely, led Dr. Badiny to
conclude that the writing on the amulet was Proto-Sumerian.
The discovery of the word GIDIM, demon, indicates that the
people who wore these amulets believed that every creation on earth
has a counterpart in heaven. This view was taken from the Sumerian
religious remains. The more imperfect the earthly creation, the more
perfect was the heavenly counterpart. The heavenly counterpart of
the underworld was paradise or Dilmun. The counterpart of the most
merciless queen of the underworld, ERESKIGAL was INNANA, the
virgin mother. Every city on earth had a heavenly counterpart. The
counterpart of the city of UR was the moon; that of SIPPAR was the
constellation Aquarius. Already, in the oldest Sumerian epigraphs,
the cross was found as a letter-sign meaning pair or counterpart
(Labat, No. 74)[10]
Dr. Badiny modified the observation of Sándor Székely in the
following way. His interpretation is that the cross that is connected to
the hole or circle in the amulet does not mean "demon" but rather
informs us in which direction to read the signs. The signs should be
read in a clockwise direction not counter-clockwise as Dr. Titov
recommended. The decipherment should start at the upper left
comer. Sándor Székely correctly stated that the first sign was DUR
DIS. DUR = settlement, foundation, or as a verb, to live or to settle.
(Labat, No.436) DIS = God, One. (Labat No.480) Sumerologists take
the meaning of this word from the Semitic Akkadian, and do not
pronounce it DIS but ISTEN which means "God" or "One". The
Sumerian language uses the word DIS to express "the only one" or
"God". Dr. Badiny points out that the Hungarian word "dics" meaning
"praise" originates from the Sumerian DIS and in old Hungarian



meant "the only one". Therefore DUR - DIS can be deciphered as
"the only settlement" and, added to the sign of the cross, it meant
"the counterpart of the only settlement." In this sphere of concepts,
the "counterpart" refers to the heavenly counterpart who could not
be a demon but a godly power or defending spirit. This is why it is
logical that the circle is located at the end of the cross and served as
a hole with the purpose of allowing the tablet to be used as an
amulet. The DUR sign, according to Labat 436, can also be
pronounced as TUR. TUR-DIS is almost the same as TORDOS. If we
apply the Sumerian vowel harmony, which is accepted by every
Sumerologist, we find TUR-DOS. This means that the name TORDOS
is 7000 years old. The meaning of the signs deciphered so far is "the
defending spirit of the counterpart of Tordos."
The epigraphs of Tatárlaka must be accepted as Proto-Sumerian,
as has been acknowledged by the Soviet archeologists. This means
that the epigraphic signs, which were found in the Sumerian cultural
centers, are a more developed form of those found on the Tartaria
tablets. We can find an outstanding example in the sign of DUR. On
the Tartaria tablet, the upper part of the vertical line of the sign of
the cross points toward heaven and the lower part to the earth,
which shows that the two are connected. The Sumerian epigraph
does not demonstrate that concept because the spreading of this
religious view made it unnecessary. By that time it was accepted that
Heaven and Earth were connected. Most of the epigraphs of
Tatárlaka and Sumer are almost identical. The difficulty is with the
decipherment of the later signs, which are ideograms that could
express proper nouns, adjectives or verbal nouns and the possessive
case, which is derived from the context of the signs. The following is
the decipherment of the right upper quarter of the tablet: The first
sign is identical to the one in the left upper quarter, DIS meaning
"God, or Glorious". The second is a smaller form of the same sign.



The next sign is a small circle and the last sign in the line resembles
the letter "C". The sign above them looks like a rake and is
deciphered as SAL-AS (Labat No. TM.329), meaning "charming
woman, witch". The decipherment of the circle is SAR (Labat No.
396) meaning "perfection". The last sign, resembling a "C" is
deciphered as BUZUR (Labat No. 411) meaning "secret". The line
then reads: DIS SAL-AS SAR BUZUR which means: "The glorious
charming woman (goddess) who knows all secrets".
As we can see, this is a prayer to the protectress of Tordos and
this decipherment explains why so many small statues of the fertility
goddess were found around Tordos near the tablets. The signs in the
lower left quarter of the tablet: the first sign is IGI (Labat, 449),
which means "eye". The second sign is deciphered as MIN (Labat,
471) means "two" and the third sign PA (Labat 295) means "head,
leader". Therefore the meaning of IGI MIN PA is: "two guarding eyes".
The fertility Goddess in ancient times was often portrayed as the
Goddess of the Eyes, with representations of owl's eyes on many of
the statuettes and artifacts. According to the grammatical rules of
the Sumerian language, there is a possessive relation with the
goddess in the upper right hand quarter. The meaning of the three
groups so far deciphered is: "The two watchful eyes of the patroness
of Tordos, the glorious goddess who knows all secrets." The last
quarter completes the prayer. The first sign SA (Labat 353) means
"face" and "attention, watchfulness". The next sign AB (Labat 128)
means "father". The semi-circle is the rising sun deciphered PIR
(Labat 381). The three signs together SA-PIR-AB mean: "the
watchful sunfather" or the concept of the Sun God. The full text of
the amulet is: "May the two watchful eyes of the patroness of
Tordos, the glorious goddess who knows all secrets, protect us in
the light of our Sun God".[11]



Table of signs from Tatárlaka and Sumer
The cult of the Mother-Goddess has been extensively researched
by Professor Marija Gimbutas of the University of California, Los
Angeles.[12] Numerous statues of the Fertility Goddess have been
found in Central Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin, dating
back to the 6th and 5th millennia B.C. About sixty of them were
found at Mehtelek. According to József Bíró, at the time of the Kőrös
culture, the Mother-Goddess was called ERES or ERŐS. This name is
preserved in the name of the city Erősd. The name of the Greek God
of Love, EROS, may be connected.[13] In The Language of the
Goddess, Professor Gimbutas offers an explanation for the lines on
the statuettes of the Goddess. The M sign had aquatic significance,
as did the chevron and the meander. It is interesting to note that the
ancient people also represented the Mother Goddess as a "primeval
mother" in the form of a doe.[14] In the Magyar legends, the
progenitress of the Magyar and Hun nations was also a doe.



According to Marija Gimbutas, the Mother Goddess has been called
ANA, ANNIA, ANU or ANKU.[15] In Hungarian, the word for "mother"
is "anyu". The Sumerian word for "mother" was AMA. The Sumerian
God of Creation was ANU. Somehow, in the migration from the
Carpathian Basin to Mesopotamia, the matricentric pantheon of
goddesses became a patricentric pantheon of gods, but the name
for the creator remained --ANU.
Many of the figures of the Goddess are decorated with three
parallel lines. This pattern is repeated many times on vases and
other artifacts. Professor Gimbutas says: "The tri-line sign seems to
symbolize a triple or multiple life substance of dynamic quality..."
"The triple source is linked with the triple Goddess, an astonishingly
long-lived image documented as early as the Magdalenian epoch..."
[16] She mentions that this symbolic tradition is continued in
Anatolian and Mycenaean figurines and in Bronze Age figurines from
Cyprus. This tri-line symbol can also be found on representations of
the Goddess in Sumer. The Sumerian Goddess of Fertility and Birth
was NINHURSAG. Again, the "Ice-man" found in the Alps, wore
tattoos of three and four parallel lines. It has been suggested that he
might have been a shaman or a trader.
The Rumanian/Hungarian dispute about who has more right to the
possession of Transylvania motivated the scientific world to research
the area of Transylvania. The theory of the Daco-Roman continuity
has gradually lost credibility while more and more data have come to
light to prove the Magyar continuity. Ida Bobula, Professor of
Sociology and Anthropology at Ricker College 1951-1959, found 535
Hungarian words identical to Sumerian words in the Sumerian
lexicon. This significant discovery revived the dormant theories of
the nineteenth century researchers of Sumerology, Colonel
Rawlinson, A.J. Sayce, Lenormand and others, that the Sumerian
language shows connections to the Ural-Altaic languages, especially



the Hungarian language. The research of Ida Bobula and Zsófia
Torma motivated Kálmán Gosztony, a professor at the Sorbonne
University in Paris, to continue the research of the Sumerian
Hungarian connections. He expanded the number of Sumerian
Hungarian cognates to 1200 and presented sixty grammatical rules
that were identical in Sumerian and Hungarian.[17]
Zsuzsanna Kovács-Telekiné studied the ancient history of
Transylvania from original documents and she noticed that, when
Ptolemy mentions the populace of Dacia (Transylvania), he writes
"Kau-ko encio". She noticed that if we leave off the "encio" it
becomes "Kau-ko" or in Hungarian "kő-kő" which means "hegy
hegy" or "mountain-mountain" i.e. mountains. This document was
dated only twenty to thirty years after the Roman conquest of Dacia.
She also noticed that Ammianus Marcellinus, writing about the war
of the Roman Emperor Valens against the Goths also writes the
name of Transylvania as "Kau-Ko".[18] The Sumerian words KO, KA,
and KAU all have the same meaning as the Hungarian "Kő" i.e.
"stone". In Sumerian, the plural was formed by repeating a word:
"KAU-KO" i.e. "mountains". The Szekels today still use the word
"Stone" for "Mountain". The names of many Transylvanian mountains
end with "kő", like Unokő, Szarkő, Siposkő. These mountains are all
1600 to 2000 meters high. If we take the root of the the name
"Caucasia" (cau) then the name is identical to the Proto Sumerian
name for Transylvania.
The ancient Magyar suffix "A" means river. Many of the rivers in
Hungary end with this suffix: Duna, Tisza, Száva, Dráva, Morva,
Mura, Rába, Rabca, Zagyva. The River Euphrates in Mesopotamia
was called in Sumerian BARANYA.
Zsuzsanna Kovács-Telekiné, at the 27th International Orientalists
World Congress at Ann-Arbor, Michigan in 1967, presented another



name of the River Danube which was "Ister", the name of the
Sumerian Goddess of Fertility, ISTER. At the 29th International
Orientalists Congress at the Sorbonne in 1973, she presented
Sumerian words, which she found as geographical names in the
Carpathian Basin. SAMAS was the name of the Mesopotamian Sun
God ,which is reflected in the name of the river Szamos. NAP is
identical to the Magyar word "nap" which means "sun". Napoka is the
ancient name of the city of Kolozsvár (now Cluj in Rumania) and
contains both the words NAP and KO. The Sumerian word AM-ARU
means "flood" (Hungarian - áradat) and can be found in the name of
the River Maros, which is called by the local people "Maras". "OS" or
"as" (in ancient Magyar "aszo") is identical to the Sumerian AS which
means "river". A smaller river in the vicinity of the River Maros is
called today the Sik-aszo. The Transylvanian river Zsil is identical to
the Sumerian word ZIL, which means "sparkling" (Hungarian-csillog).
The ancient name of the river Olt was ALUTA which was one of the
names of the Sumerian goddess of Fertility who was also called
INNANA and ISTER.[19]
Historians have for decades questioned whether the
development of writing took place in Mesopotamia or the Carpathian
Basin. The diffusionist anthropologists and the migrationists state
that writing developed in the Near East. The followers of the Radio
Carbon 14 school state that it developed in Transylvania. The
geographical names of the Carpathian Basin are of Proto-Sumerian
and Proto-Magyar origin, several thousand years earlier than the
arrival of the Dacian and Latin languages in this territory. This fact
could be of vital importance as an argument against the Daco Roman
theory. The ancient people of the Danube region, that is the ancient
populace of the Kőrös culture, not only migrated with their carriages
to Mesopotamia but also left their mark on the territory of Egypt. I
shall present a few old Egyptian and Hungarian words which are



identical and I would like to suggest that the migration from the
Carpathian Basin was not concentrated only in Mesopotamia, but
spread in all directions. John Dayton believes that some of the
populace of the Carpathian Basin migrated across the Mediterranean
by sea, reaching the Levant and continuing on to Egypt "in large
ships of Lebanese cedars and others carried on to Mesopotamia
with their solid-wheeled carts and oxen." He also suggests that,
because of the similarities between the Sumerians and the people of
the Indus Valley, "objects and traditions were carried towards the
Indus".[20]
Professor Tibor Baráth of the University of Montreal did extensive
research into the Magyar/Egyptian connections which he published
in 1968 and 1973.[21] He presented many cognates that indicate a
close connection between the two peoples. The word "water" in Old
Egyptian was "MO" which remains in the Hungarian word "mo",
which means "wash", and in the Hungarian word "mocsár", which
means "swamp". The Egyptian name for "house, building, palace" is
FAR which resembles the Hungarian words "vár" (castle) and "fa"
(wall). The name of the Egyptian ruler is pharaoh and the ancient
meaning is "large house" (Hungarian - nagy ház). The Hungarian
counterpart is "háznagy" (majordomo) or "várnagy" (commander of
the castle). The word "country" in the Egyptian language is TA, which
resembles the Hungarian word "ta", which means "region". The word
TA is from the Old Egyptian word GEB-TA. The meaning of GEB is
"grassland". This resembles the Hungarian "gyeptaj" which means
"grassland". In ancient times, Egypt was caller MAZAR, MIZIR, which
reminds us of the name of the Magyar people. Another word which
makes us wonder is the Hungarian word "nádor" meaning "palatine"
which linguists try to trace to the Slavic languages in spite of the fact
that the Slavs have no similar rank. Egypt's attorney general was
NADRJ.



In the preface of his Tibetan-English Dictionary, Sándor Kőrösi
Csoma writes that the Sanskrit language shows more connections to
the Hungarian language than it does to the language of any other
European nation. The structure of the Sanskrit language and the
structure of several Indian languages are parallel to the structure of
the Hungarian language and all are different from the Western
European languages. For example, in Hungarian, suffixes are used
instead of prefixes. The only exceptions to this rule are Proper
Nouns. Several verb tenses are formed by adding a syllable, rather
than by using an auxiliary verb as do all the other European
languages.[22]
I would like to draw the reader's attention to the fact that the
origins of the Hungarian people have not yet been determined. One
area, which has not been researched, is the analysis of the
settlement and geographical names. There are many names whose
meanings are as yet unknown, for example the river Sajó and the
settlements along this river, Sajóbabony, Sajóecseg, Sajógalgóc,
Sajókaza, Sajósenye. These names are the proofs of the antiquity
of the Hungarian people. Another interesting Hungarian word, which
dates back to the late Paleolithic Era, 25,000 years ago, is
"kövesztett" as in "kövesztett szalonna", which today means
"steamed or boiled bacon". The actual meaning of the word
"kövesztett" is lost today because of the changes made by the
progress of technology. This word reflects the period in which men
heated stones in fire and on the hot stone, in a pot of water, the
bacon was cooked until it became soft. With this process, the bacon
was preserved and was easily edible. Therefore the word
"kövesztett" meant "softened". Looking at the word "kő" which
means "stone" we might logically think that the word "kőveszt"
means "to harden", whereas it actually means "to soften".
Although it is generally believed that the Hungarian language



stands alone and is unrelated to any of the other European
languages, except Finnish, there is established research comparing
Hungarian to more than sixty languages, which are completely
isolated from each other. Is it possible that the Hungarian language
is related to these languages? Sándor Kőrösi Csoma, the author of
the Tibetan-English dictionary, identifies 240 Sanskrit words with
Hungarian words. József Aczél states that the Magyar people had a
close connection with the Greeks. Ármin Vámbéry establishes a
Turkish-Magyar connection. Bálint Gábor Szentkapolnai studied the
Mongol-Magyar connection. Christoff Sonngott researched the
Armenian-Magyar similarity. Zsigmond Varga researched the
Sumerian-Hungarian connection. László Szabédy studied the Latin
Magyar connection. Géza Kúr researched the Etruscan-Magyar
identity and the above-mentioned Tibor Baráth, the Egyptian/Magyar
connection. János Fadrusz studied the similarities between the
Magyar Runic Script and the Etruscan alphabet finding all the letters
identical except four.
Adorján Magyar writes that it is an established fact that if a people
obtained knowledge of an object from another people, then they also
adopted the name of that object. The uniqueness of the Hungarian
language is that its vocabulary shows a close relationship to most
other European languages. This quality led European linguists to
state that the Hungarian language was a language of borrowings
taken from all the European nations. It is easy to disprove this view of
the Hungarian language. In the Hungarian language there are logical
word derivations and the words are logically connected to each
other. A language made up of borrowed words cannot be so logical.
The present Hungarian word "kő", "stone" is in proto-Magyar KA, KE,
KU, and in a dialect of Hungarian today is KU. The Hungarian word
"kemény" meaning "hard" was formed from the proto-Magyar word
KA, KE, KU. The root words are always of one syllable. The words KA,



KE, KU are not only one syllable but they only have two sounds
(phonemes). For the prehistoric man the hardness of the stone was
of major importance. The name of the quality of hardness was
derived from the stone (KE - Ke-mény). Without any doubt the Slav
word "kamen" which means "stone" and is of two syllables and five
sounds, is a later development and is derived from the Hungarian
word "kemény". There is obviously a reasonable connection between
the Hungarian words "kő" and "kemény". At the same time between
the Slav word "kamen" (stone) and the Slav word "tvrdo" meaning
"hard" there is no accoustical or meaningful connection. This
signifies that these words are not developed from each other.
The Hungarian word "viz" (water), the Finnish "vete", the Slav
"voda", the German "Wasser" are related accoustically. We can see
that the Hungarian word is of one syllable, the others are of two
syllables and four or five sounds, which proves that they are all later
developments. In the Turkish language the words for water and
stone are of completely different form. "Su" or "tas" means "stone"
(kő), "sub" means "water" (viz). This means that the Magyar
language did not originate in Asia but developed in Europe. Is it
possible that the nomad Magyars did not know of water and stone
while they were in Asia and found them only when they migrated to
Europe? Of course not, but since they now use the ancient words for
these objects, they obviously adopted the language of the
autochthonous people of the Carpathian Basin which is now known
as Magyar or Hungarian. We can conclude that these ancient words
originate from the Prehistory of Europe and that the modern
Hungarians are descended from a people indigenous to Europe. The
language is obviously very ancient because most of the root words
are of one syllable, e.g. "fej" (head), "szem" (eye), "kéz" (hand), "láb"
(leg), "lég" (air), "fű" (grass), "fa" (tree), "tűz" (fire), "víz" (water). The
modern Hungarian language is the European ancient language,



which developed in the Carpathian Basin. The ancient populace
migrated from the Carpathian Basin in every direction and from this
ancient populace the European peoples, the Aryans, took their
knowledge and their words.
This is why the Hungarian language has cognates and
grammatical similarities in more than sixty languages. If we take the
Hungarian language as the "lender" language, then most of the
linguistic problems can be solved.[23]
Géza Barczi, a member of the Hungarian Academy of Science and
a supporter of the Finno-Ugric hypothesis, published the
Etymological Dictionary of the Hungarian Language.[24] He lists the
words that supposedly came into the language of the Árpád Magyars
at the time that they reclaimed their homeland from the Slav people
who were supposedly living in the Carpathian Mountains at that time.
Barczi says that, because the Magyars were extremely barbarian and
nomadic, their vocabulary was very poor, especially in expressions
describing occupations. How could the people of Árpád have taken
these words from the Slav people? Gyula László, who was also a
Finno-Ugric theorist, writes of the Slavs: "The Byzantine writers
mentioned the timid people of this territory (Carpathian Mountains),
who were afraid to come out of the forests, who knew very little
about metals and lived almost at the level of the Stone Age people,
gathering nuts and berries and living from fishing and hunting and a
little primitive agriculture."[25] "We have found very few
archeological data which prove the existence of the Slavs. Those few
artifacts which were found were discovered in the valleys of creeks
and in caves and indicated that the Transylvanian Slavs lived almost
at the level of the Stone Age people."[26]
The lifestyle of the Slavs who lived on the periphery of the
Carpathian Basin was close to the level of the people of the Stone



Age. Supposedly the standard of living of the Western Slavs was
higher but did it reach the standard of living of the Avars who were
living in the Carpathian Basin before the arrival of Árpád's Magyars?
The contemporary writers describe the Avars as a rich, civilized
people who enjoyed luxury. The Avars or Var-Huns built enormous
strongholds made of earth and clay and received their name from
this activity (Vár-Huns or Vár-Kuns, "vár" in Hungarian means
"castle"). They used the Slav or servant people to do the
construction of these castles. The Avars settled the Slavs, who lived
on a Stone Age level around the Avar strongholds, in an area called
the "gyepű", the marchland or no man's land. The duty of the Slavs
living in the marchland was to guard the Avars from attack and in
later wars they fought in the front lines.
"The conqueror, to a certain extent, has to make the conquered
people conform to his standards, otherwise he could not make use
of them."[27] The Slavs were under the Avar military rule and Avar
rulers governed them. Later, the Slavs began to organize their lives in
the same way the Avars did. Before this could happen, the Avars had
to educate the Slavs and raise them from the Stone Age level. This
effort resulted in a large part of the Avar vocabulary being adopted
by the Slavs. The Hungarian words that have been labeled as “Slav
borrowings” are ancient Avar-Magyar words. At the same time, these
words can be found in the Sumerian vocabulary.
The name by which the Slavs called the Avars - OBOR - is itself a
Sumerian word. UB means "region" (Labat 139-306) UR means
"lord" (De Sarzec 291)[28] The word UB-UR or OBOR means "feudal
lord". The Magyar historians were forced to accept that there were
two homecomings of the Magyars because Gyula László's proofs
were so convincing.[29] The first of the homecomings was that of
the Avars, the second one, that of Árpád and the Magyars. The
people of Árpád, at least the Megyers, from which the nation took its



name, spoke the same language as the Avars and the ancient
populace of the Carpathian Basin, with whom the Magyars made an
alliance. Many words from this ancient language appear in the list of
the so-called "Slav borrowings", in the language of the Slavs and
also among the Sumerian vocabulary. The linguists did not find many
specifically Avar names in the Carpathian Basin because the ancient
populace, the Avars and the Magyars all spoke the same language. In
some way they were all connected with the Sumerian language. It is
obvious that the Slavs took over words from the ancient language
and the Avars and not the reverse. The Slavs definitely do not
originate from Mesopotamia. Those Slav words that can only be
analyzed with the help of the Sumerians, must have been adopted
from the Avars, the Magyars or the ancient populace of the
Carpathian Basin. The Finno-Ugric linguists state that the words that
the Slavs borrowed from the Avars are Slav words and the barbaric
Magyars borrowed these words from the Slavs.
Géza Barczi stated that the Magyars borrowed occupational
vocabulary from the Slavs. The Byzantine writers wrote that, at the
time of the Avars, the Slavs were on the level of the Stone Age. At
that time, they obviously did not have occupational words. If they
developed occupations that they learned from the Avars, they would
have adopted the Avar words for those occupations. The Finno-Ugric
linguists declare that the names of the following occupations which
are Hungarian words, were borrowed by the Magyars from the Slavs:
"mészáros" (butcher), "esztergályos" (woodworker), "kádár"
(cooper), "takács" (weaver), "csizmadia" (bootmaker). These words
can be found in Sumerian also. If a people, which had no connection
with Mesopotamia, had in their vocabulary a large number of
occupational words, then without doubt we can state that they must
have taken over these words from another people who had a
connection with the Sumerian people or from the Sumerians



themselves. "Mészáros" (butcher) is in Sumerian MASARU (D. 594
8g) meaning "to cut" [30] and US (DSA-113) meaning "person doing
the action". Therefore MASARUS (mészáros) means "a cutting man"
or "butcher". This word then existed in Sumerian and in the ancient
Magyar language.[31] "Esztergályos" (woodworker or turner, now
lathe-operator) was in Sumerian ISTERGALUS. IS - means to drill
through (DSA-138). TER - means "tree” (D.375-21) GAL means
"great, huge" (DSA-39), and US- means "man" (DSA-113). So the
meaning of the word ISTERGALUS (esztergályos) is "man who carves
the tree" or "woodworker” .... “Kádár" (cooper) is in Sumerian KAD
UR. KAD means "basin" (L.222). UR means "man" (L.225-575). The
meaning of the word KAD-UR (kádár) is "man who makes basins or
barrels" or "cooper". "Takács" (weaver) is also supposed to be a
word borrowed from the Slavs, but it is unbelievable that a people
who lived in caves would have a weaving loom. The word "takács" is
in Sumerian TUKU which means "to weave" (D.125-43) or "weaver"
(DSA-207) and added to this is US (DSA-113) meaning "man". The
word TUKU-US (takács) means "weaving man" or "weaver". In the
ancient language the "U" was predominant and it changed to "A" in
the Hungarian language. The "s" often became "cs" in Hungarian.
Gyula László writes that the Magyars of Árpád wore a linen shirt with
a stand-up collar.[32] The shirt was made of a woven material
because the old Magyar word for shirt was "inag", now "ing". In
Sumerian IN (DSA 77) means "flax" and AG (DSA-7) means "to make"
and INAG means "shirt".
In the graves of the Árpád Magyars, large numbers of saddles,
bits, stirrups, horseshoes, swords, needles, artistically decorated
belt-buckles and jewelry were found. This proves that there were
blacksmiths, silversmiths and fine artisans. Gyula László found, in
the Slav graves of the time of Árpád, clothes which were made of
animal skins and sandals made of leather and thongs.[33] In the



Magyar graves of the same period were found the remains of boots.
[34] The boots were sewn from the side, had soft soles, and were
made of leather and felt. The Slavs wore sandals, not boots, but
according to the Finno-Ugric linguists they had a word for a boot
maker. At the same time, the Magyars wore boots but according to
the Finno-Ugric linguists, they had no word for "boot maker".[35]
Ida Bobula made the significant observation that the "Slav" words,
which the Finno-Ugric linguists claim were "borrowed" by the
Magyars, do not exist in the Slav languages which are spoken in
territories distant from Hungary. The distant Slavs use other words
for the same concepts. This indicates that the neighboring Slavs
borrowed from the Magyars and not the reverse.
According to the Germans, the German word "dolmetschen" (to
interpret) came from the Magyar word "tolmácsol" (to interpret). The
Germans and the Slavs took it from the Magyars in the thirteenth
century. It is possible that, many centuries earlier, it had been
adopted by the Magyars from the Mitannian language.[36] It is
interesting that the Hungarian word for "explain" is "magyarázni"
which means to use the Magyar language to explain a concept. This
must be a very ancient word.
Dr. József Aczél, a Greek scholar, states that the Magyar people
had close connections with the Greeks.[37] He finds 3000 Pre
Hellene and Hellene root words that are identical to Magyar root
words and also finds grammatical similarities. Besides the linguistic
connection, there are other connecting factors. Herodotos writes
that the name of the first Scythian king was Targiatos. By linguistic
progression, the hard consonants became softer. The "t" became
"h". If we drop the Greek ending "os", then we find the name of one
of the mountains of Transylvania, Hargita.



Hippocrates (460-377 B.C) when he writes of the winds, waters
and places, writes: "In Europe, there is a Scythian people who are
living around the Meotis lake different from all other peoples, who
are called Sarmatians. Their women ride horses, use bows and
arrows and throw spears at their enemies, until they lose their
virginity. They eat cooked meat and drink milk from their horses, and
eat "ippak" which is cottage cheese made from horse milk." It is
interesting to note that the Magyars also drank horse-milk and ate
"ippak". Herodotos (484-424 B.C.) (Book IV, Ch.V) writes that the
Scythians say that they are the most ancient people on the earth and
the children of Targiatos. The legend says that Targiatos descended
from Jupiter and one of the daughters of the river-god, Bory. During
the rule of Targiatos, a plough, yoke, axe and a cup fell from heaven,
all made of gold. These golden objects burst into flame as Lipoxais,
the eldest son of Targiatos, approached them and he fled. The
second son, Arpoxais, also fled. The youngest son, Kolaxais, was
able to approach without their bursting into flame, so he inherited
them. This is the reason that the Scythians always carried a cup on
their belt. Herodotos (Ch.10) writes that Hercules tied his oxen and
fell asleep. When he woke up, he did not find his oxen. In a cave, he
found a hermaphrodite who told him the oxen were there but she
would give them back to him only if he would sleep with her.
Therefore, Hercules gave her his bow and his belt from which a cup
was hanging and he stayed with her. They had three sons, Agathyrs,
Celon, and Schytes. The Scythians claim to be the descendants of
Schytes, the youngest son of Hercules. From the linguistic evidence
and the legends, it appears that there was a connection between the
Greeks and the Scythians.[38]
Every legend has a historical background which, in time, changes
and fades and develops into the legend or even into a folk-tale. The
deeds or acts are not fabricated but reflect actual events which are



exaggerated or clouded.

THE HOMELAND RECLAIMED
Chapter 9
The Sumerian-Hungarian Identity
In the nineteenth century, Jules Oppert, François Lenormand, A. J.
Sayce, Colonel Rawlinson and others acknowledged the linguistic
connections between the Sumerians and the Hungarians, but they
did not find a large enough number of cognates to prove their theory.
Because of this, the Hungarian Academy of Science rejected their
hypothesis that there was a Sumerian-Magyar connection. However
János Galgóczy, Ede Somogyi, Ida Bobula, Zsigmond Varga, and
Kálmán Gosztonyi of the Sorbonne University, Paris, have since
researched the Sumerian/Hungarian connection and discovered over
2000 cognates and also grammatical similarities between the two
languages.[1]
Kálmán Gosztonyi states that the Hungarian language has only a
secondary connection to the Finno-Ugric languages, The Finno
Ugric/Magyar connection was based on the names of eleven human



body parts, which showed similarities. At the same time there are
forty-five body parts, which are identical in the Hungarian and
Sumerian languages. In addition, the Hungarian suffixes are almost
all identical to the Sumerian. He says that there is one very wide
disparity between the Hungarian and Finno-Ugric languages. In the
Finno-Ugric languages, in the double digits, the "tens" take second
place. In Sumerian and Hungarian, the "tens" precede the "ones".
Dr. Gosztonyi also points out that in Ostyak, "man" is LUU, and in
Zurjen, U. These Finno-Ugric languages must have taken the word
from the ancient Magyar LU or the Sumerian LU. He found that
among 53 Sumerian grammatical characteristics, 51 are identical to
the Hungarian and only 21 are identical to the Finno-Ugric
languages.[2]
The linguistic connections between the Sumerians and the Ural
Altaic peoples were observed by Professor Samuel Noah Kramer:
"The first Sumerian rulers kept up an unusually close, intimate
connection with a city-state called ARATTA which was probably
located in the Caspian Sea territory. The Sumerian language was an
agglutinative language which to a certain extent reminds us of the
Ural Altaic languages."[3]
Not only are there linguistic similarities between the Hungarian
and Sumerian languages, but there are also similarities in the
customs, legends and religion of these two peoples. The present
day Hungarians still have the same custom as the ancient Magyars,
and the Sumerians, of holding a festive wake for a deceased person.
Friends and relatives gather at the house of the deceased where
there is an abundance of food and drink and this becomes a festive
occasion where everyone remembers the deeds of the deceased.
One custom of the Sumerian soldiers was to throw a leopard skin



loosely over one shoulder and go into battle brandishing a small
battleaxe. The Magyars of Árpád had this same custom. Among the
Hungarians, this use of the battleaxe persisted well into the twentieth
century at the time of World War I. The Sumerian men wore trousers
decorated with fringes and the women wore a headdress of pearls.
Even today, among the country folk in Hungary, the same costume
still exists. The Sumerian God of War and of the Storm was called
HADDU. Árpád, when he lined up his men to enter the Carpathian
Basin, according to the Chronicles, prayed to HADUR for protection.
According to the Szekel legend, after Atilla's death, his son Csaba,
who had fled, was supposed to return with some help, along the
"Hadak utja", the route of God or the triumphal way, and every year
they waited for him in the springtime. The Sumerians beheved in life
after death. They believed that one of their gods, TAMMUZ
(DUMUZIK or SUBA = Csaba) died and was resurrected. They
celebrated his resurrection every year at the time of the New Year.
They believed that he would return to earth, be born of a virgin
mother, and would redeem the world.
There must be some significance to the fact that the Sumerians
called the wheel MAGGARU, a word that resembles the name
Magyar. According to Ida Bobula, the name Magyar originated from
the Sumerian word MAGGAR. MAG means "Magus" or "wise man"
and AR means "flood" or "crowd". So MAG-GAR means "a large
number of wise men". Similarly GAR in the name Hungar means a
large number of Huns.
The similarities between the customs, art, mythology, religion and
language all indicate a close and long-lasting connection between
the Magyars and the Sumerians or possibly that these were the
same identical people. According to anthropologist, Lajos Bartucz,
the Sumerians belonged to the Caucasian race but had some
Mongoloid characteristics. He says that they were short and stocky,



with small hands and feet and most of the men shaved their heads.
Those who did not shave their heads wore their hair in three braids.
They belonged to the brachycephalic group.[4] In the early stages
of archeological research, anthropology was not recognized as an
important partner in the research and many skulls were destroyed.
The large numbers of Sumerian skulls that were unearthed were not
studied before they were destroyed and as a result we no longer
have enough of them to make a clear and exact anthropological
determination.
I.E. T. Hamy tried to reconstruct the anthropological picture of the
Sumerians from the remaining statues and reliefs. Sir Arthur Keith
states that from his examination of the few remaining skulls, he
concurs with the conclusions of Hamy.[5] Hamy makes a clear
distinction between the Sumerians and the Semitic types. The
Semites were dolicephalic and bearded, while the Sumerians were
brachycephalic, with mongoloid features, high cheekbones, and
shaved face and head. Among the Sumerians, Hamy found a third
component, which he called Armenoid (the Hittites). Roland Dixon
wrote: "A short headed (brachycephalic) people migrated south in
the dawn of ancient times."[6] This was probably a group of people
from the ancient Kőrős culture who wandered south as Etelka
Toronyi and Adorján Magyar also stated. Most recently, John Dayton
supported this theory.[7]
Felix von Luschen writes that only a dreamer would state that the
Sumerians belong to the Aryan race, because he would like to
believe that the Aryans discovered writing.[8] According to Von
Luschen, after the Semites conquered the Sumerians, one segment
of the Sumerians remained in Mesopotamia, another segment
migrated to Caucasia and others to the Turanian Plain, India and
China. Francois Lenormand and others mention a Turanian Medea.
According to Koenig, the original inhabitants of Medea could not



have been Iranian because they called their god Huba.[9] (Huba was
the name of a leader of one of the "nations" who came with Árpád
into the Carpathian Basin.) One group of Sumerians migrated to India
and settled in Harappa and Mohenjo Daro, which were excavated in
1946. We know that the Sumerians were outstanding astronomers
and mathematicians, gold and silversmiths. They had an advanced
legal system with laws protecting the weak and the state was based
on the family unit. They used ceramics and cutlery. They were
familiar with the wheel. They knew how to build an arch and a dome.
They built cellars under their houses and were architects of hanging
gardens. They developed irrigation systems and plumbing and built
pyramids. They developed a system of mercantile law.
Zsigmond Varga proves that there is a connection between the
languages and cultures of the Ural Altaic peoples and that of the
Sumerians.[10] Pater Anton Deimel, after reading Zsigmond Varga's
book, in his last writing before his death, states that only those
scientists who speak agglutinative languages will be able to solve the
Sumerian secrets.
Dr. Elemér Novotny, a member of the Hungarian Academy of
Science, has also proved that there are linguistic and cultural
connections between the Sumerian and Hungarian peoples.[11] His
research deals with the linguistic remains of the Sumerian and
Hungarian languages, which show similarities. Two Hungarian
writings which are earlier than the twelfth century, the "Halotti
Beszéd" and the "Königsbergi Maria Ének" can be understood only
with the help of the Sumerian language. Dr. Novotny corresponded
with Professor Sz. P. Tolstov, the leader of the Chorezm expedition
and with Professor I. M. Diakonov, Curator of the Eastern-Asian
Institute in Saint Petersburg, both of whom accept the possibility of a
Sumerian-Hungarian relationship.



Dr. Novotny disputed the theory of most linguists that the
Sumerian language is a dead language and had no relationship to
any other language. He examined the language as if it were a living
language that had progressed historically. He studied Hungarian
texts of the eleventh and twelfth centuries that clearly show a
relationship to the Sumerian language. He states that the names of
many of the Sumerian gods appear in geographical names in
Hungary. For example: IN-NA-NA the Sumerian Heavenly Mother,
survives in a village name - Nana. The river Ister, an ancient name for
the Danube, derives its name from ISTER, the Sumerian Fertility
Goddess. The father of Árpád, Álmos has a Sumerian name, GAL
MA-GUS. Dr. Novotny explains that the letter "G" often disappeared
from the beginning or end of a word. Therefore GAL-MA-GUS
became AL-MA-US and later AL-MU-US. The meaning of the word
GAL-MA-GUS was "children of the great God".
Ida Bobula supports the theory that the Sumerian language is not
a dead language and she follows the same method of studying the
language as if it had progressed historically. She states that the
letter "D" in Sumerian changes to a "T" in Hungarian.[12] For
example:
Sumerian Hungarian
DAL (vessel) TAL (plate)
DAM (spouse TAM (help, partner)
DAR (splits open) TAR (opens)



DAG (add, increase) TÁG (wide)
DAN (to be bright) TAN (teach, enlighten)
TANÍT (teach)
TANÍTÓ (teacher)
TANÁCS (advice, counsel)
TANU (witness)
TANULÓ (pupil)
TANUL (learn)
TANULT (learned, educated)
TANULMÁNY (essay, study)
TANULATLAN (uneducated)
Elemér Novotny writes that one of the most ancient portrayals of
the god EN-LIL was the lion headed eagle. This statue was the
defender of all the Sumerian cities and was not a god in itself but
was the mythological symbol of the power of EN-LIL. It was the
unified picture of the king of the animals and the king of the birds,
the symbol of EN-LIL the god of earth and air. A relief, depicting this
symbol of the lion-headed eagle with wide-spread wings, was found
in the city of Ur and dated to the third millennium B.C. The cuneiform
script often mentions this symbol.



Ida Bobula suggests that this is a representation of the legendary
TURUL bird of the Magyars and analyzes the word TURUL in
Sumerian: TUR means "young or new"; ULLU means "shiny"; so
TUR-ULLU means "new light". In Temesvár, Hungary (presently
Timisoara in Rumania), a similar representation was found. Dr.
Novotny says that there are two possible explanations for this. One is
that this is the influence of the Sumerian culture in this territory and
the second is that it is an independent product of a nation related to
the Sumerians, which broke away from them and became isolated
from them. I would like to suggest that there is a third explanation,
that this might have been a symbol belonging to the ancient people
who took it from the Carpathian Basin to Mesopotamia.
The Sumerians had more than one name for the eagle but all the
names are preceded by the word DINGIR meaning "god" and
followed by HU meaning "bird" but this HU is not pronounced. e.g.
DINGIR IM-DUG-UDHU - God storm cloud bird. DINGIR IM-GIG-HU=
God dark cloud bird.
The name IM-DUG-UD-HU is found in the Chronicles of
Anonymus from A.D. 1200 where the river TUKUTA is mentioned and



DUG-UD-A, which became Tukud, the original name of the village
Tököd in Hungary. The Akkadians called the eagle AN-ZU which is
also a name of Sumerian origin. AN in Sumerian means "sky" and ZU
means "well-known". So AN-ZU means "the one who knows the sky
well".
The God EN-LIL had other names in Sumerian. He was called
GAL-MAH which means "great exalted" and SU-MAH which means
"merciful-exalted".
Dr. Elemér Novotny described Sumerian customs which are
important in the Sumerian-Hungarian connections. The High
priestess EMES, who was usually the daughter of the king, carried
the statue of the god EN-LIL every evening to the top of the Ziggurat
to the sanctuary, where she lived. According to the religious beliefs
of the Sumerians, the gods sometimes came down to earth to visit
their earthly sanctuary where EMES, the high priestess lived. The
visiting god, EN-LIL, in the form of an eagle, impregnated EMES who
gave birth to a child who became the king. This is how the
Sumerians explained the divine origin of their kings. It was necessary
to mention this Sumerian custom so that we can make a comparison
between it and the Hungarian legend of the Dream of Emese.
Anonymus in his chronicle "Gesta Hungarorum" (circa A.D. 1200)
which was based on earlier sources, relates the legend of the Dream
of Emese:[13]
"Anno dominice incarnationis DCCCXVIIII "Ugek" sicut supra
diximus - longo post tempore de genere "Magog" regis - erat
quidam nobilissimus dux Scitiae. Qui duxit sebe uxorem "in
Dentumoger" filiam Eune du beli anni ducis - nomine "Emesu". De
qua genuit filium, qui agnominatus est: "Almus". -Sed ab eventu
divino est nominatus: Almus, quia matris eius - pregnanti per
sompnium apparuit divina visio, in forma asturis que quasi veninens



eam gravidavit."
The following is a free translation:
"In the year of Our Lord 819, as was mentioned above, Ugek, who
was a descendant of the people of King Magog, and was the most
noble prince of the Scythians, in Dentumagyaria took in marriage
Emese, the daughter of the Prince Eunedubeliani. A son was born to
them whose name was Almus. He was named Almus after a divine
event. His mother was impregnated by a divine vision which
appeared to her in a dream in the form of an eagle".
We can see a close connection between the account of
Anonymus and the ancient Sumerian belief. This ancient Sumerian
belief was still vividly alive among the Magyars in the year A.D. 819.
There are several outstanding similarities:
(a) The name Emese is identical to that of the Sumerian high
priestess EMES. That means that the mother of Álmos was a high
priestess among the Magyars.
(b) The Magyar high-priestess Emese, just the Sumerian high
priestess EMES, was the daughter of a ruler. The father of Emese
was Eunedubeliani whose name in Sumerian, according to Professor
Badiny was ENE-DU-BI-ELI-AN-NI.[14]
(c) The Sumerian national god EN-LIL or GAL-MAH in the form of
an eagle, impregnated the high priestess, EMES. The TURUL bird
impregnated the Magyar high priestess, Emese. Therefore the
people and the priests had to accept her son, Álmos, as their



legitimate ruler, of divine origin.
(d) The divine origin of the ruler was most important among the
Sumerians. According to their religious beliefs, the king always
descended from Heaven. Therefore the divine origin of the king was
expressed in his name. The Sumerian form of the name Álmos was
GAL-MAH-US which means "the son of the most exalted". US means
"son"; GAL-MAH means "most exalted" .[15]
Dr. Novotny says that the formation of the name Álmos went
through the following stages: GAL MAH-US, GAL-MU-US, HAL-MU
US, AL-MU-US, ALMUS, ALMOS. Álmos is a given name used in
Hungary today. HAL-MUUS became Halmos, a commonly used
Hungarian family name. We can see that the name of the first prince
of Hungary, Álmos, was a Sumerian name. Some of his ancestors
also had Sumerian names. Another explanation of the name of Álmos
is that the Turul bird visited his mother in a dream (Magyar “álom”).
Álmos then means "child of dream".
(e) Ügek, (nobilissimus dux) the father of Álmos, descended from
the Scythian clan of Magog. The Sumerian name was UG-EGE which
means the leader or prince of the clan. (IGI, EGE, EKE, EK).
(f) Magog in Sumerian was MAH-UG. MAH was also MAG meaning
"exalted or sublime". UG or UKU means "son or descendant".
Therefore MAGOG means "the son of the exalted".
(g) Árpád was the son of Álmos. In Sumerian it was UR-PAD-E
which, with the changes due to vowel harmony, became AR-PAD-E.
UR or URU means "shepherd, pastor or priest-king". In the names of
the Sumerian kings, UR, UTU, UTUL often appear with the meaning
of "defender" or "pastor". PAD or PADA or PADE means "named" or
"chosen". The name of the Sumerian king A-AN-NI-PAD-DA, who
was the king of Ur around 2800 B.C., means "chosen lord or ruler".



Dr. Novotny notes that, in the dialect of the region of Palóc in
Hungary, Árpád is pronounced Orpod or Orpád, which is closer to
the Sumerian UR-PAD or UR-PUD. In naming a king, the Sumerians
placed great importance on including in his name his divine origin.
The Finno-Ugric historians, however, propose that the name of
Árpád comes from "árpa" meaning" a grain of barley". How could this
name be given to the leader of a nation, whose father, Álmos, was of
divine descent? They also state that the people of Árpád were
nomadic people. If this were true, they would not have been farmers
producing barley, and if they had this word in their vocabulary, it
would not have been an important word, suitable for the name of a
leader.
There are also connections between the literature of the Magyars
and that of the Sumerians. Dr. Etelka Toronyi points out that there
are similarities between the epic poems of the Sumerians and those
of the Hungarians.[16] Sándor Petőfi (1844), one of the greatest
Hungarian poets wrote the epic János Vitéz, based on Hungarian
folk tales and legends. This was 30 years before
the Epic of Gilgamesh was discovered. In world literature there has
been no resemblance as remarkable as that between János Vitéz
and the Epic of Gilgamesh. János Vitéz fought with monsters as did
Gilgamesh. The goal both of János Vitéz and of Gilgamesh was to
obtain immortality. János Vitéz, in the same way as the Sumerian
TAMUZ (Gilgamesh), began his adventures as a shepherd king. Both
left their homes and set out on their adventures, with the blessing of
a loving woman. Jgnos Vitéz had the blessing of his beloved Iluska;
Gilgamesh had the blessing of his mother. János Vitéz turned from
the life of a shepherd to become a Hussar and, as a result of his
bravery, became the most decorated Hussar. As a Hussar, he went to
Tataria, Italy, Poland and India, finally coming to the aid of the French
against the Turks. He gained the hand of the princess of France as a



reward for his deeds, but rejected her for his beloved Iluska.
Gigamesh rejected the love of the goddess Ishtar. The death of
Iluska motivated János Vitéz to search for the secret of immortality.
Gilgamesh was motivated to do the same after the death of his
friend Enkidu. In both “János Vitéz” and “the Epic of Gilgamesh”, a
thorned flower was to give to the youth his everlasting life. The one
difference is that Gilgamesh brought up the flower from the depth of
the sea and then lost it on the shore of a lake where he fell asleep
whereas János Vitéz found the flower in the ashes of Iluska and
threw it into the Lake of Life where it again became Iluska. When
János Vitéz and Iluska left fairyland, they lost their immortality.
In 1847, three years after Petőfi had written his epic poem, János
Arany, another great Hungarian poet, wrote the trilogy of Toldi. This
work was also based on Hungarian folk tales and legends and was
not influenced by János Vitéz. It was also written while the Sumerian
clay tablets lay beneath the desert sands. In the first part of Toldi,
Arany describes the Hungarian Plain, and the enormous strength of
Miklós Toldi:
"Rémlik, mintha látnám termétes nővését
Pusztitó csatakban szálfa öklelését
Ez volt ám az ember ha kellett a gáton
Nem terem ma párja heted hét országon.
Mint komor bikaé olyan a járása
Mint barna ejfél szeme pillantása."



Translation:
"I seem to see his well-developed body going into battle with a
tree-trunk as a lance. This was the man who was needed to stop the
flood which was about to break through the barrier. There is no-one
like him in the whole wide world. He walks like a saturnine bull; his
glance is like the darkness of midnight."
The author of the Epic of Gilgamesh, written 5000 years before
"Toldi", describes Gilgamesh as "a restless hero, unrivaled and
undisciplined" who "has the craftsmen of Erech cast gigantic
weapons for himself and Enkidu."[17] Toldi left his home to look for
glory. Gilgamesh also left his home to fight the enemy of his country,
Humbaba (Huwawa). Gilgamesh said that if he died at the hand of
Humbaba, he would be remembered for ever as a hero. Both Toldi
and Gilgamesh left for their journey with a kiss and a blessing of their
mothers.[18] Toldi had an escort called Bence; the escort of
Gilgamesh was Enkidu. Toldi met with a bull which had escaped from
a slaughterhouse on the streets of Buda and he grasped it by the
horns and subdued it. The most famous heroic deed of Gilgamesh
was his struggle with the Heavenly Bull and his victory by holding it
by the horns and immobilizing it. Toldi wrestled with a Bohemian,
who was believed to be invincible, and was able to overcome him.
Gilgamesh wrestled with Enkidu who had unbelievable strength. Both
Toldi and Gilgamesh were invincible but both were finally overcome
by their need to sleep. Toldi loved Piroska but gave her up to his
friend. Gilgamesh rejected the love of Ishtar. Toldi came to the
realization that man is mortal. When his friend Enkidu died,
Gilgamesh was shocked by the mortality of man.
It is worth mentioning a Hungarian choosing-game or counting
out rhyme in the discussion of Sumerian-Magyar connections: [19]



An tan témusz
Szoraka témusz
Szoraka tiki taka
Ala bala bambusz.
László Pass, a linguist, deciphered this rhyme which has been
repeated by children for millennia as an encouragement for the sun
to rise in the morning. This rhyme has several forms. A second one
is:
Anta dunguz
Szúr raga dunguz
Szúr raga digi daga
Ala bala banduz.
László Pass analyzes the first word "Anta" as the Sumerian word
ANTA meaning "above".[20] The second part of the word - TA - is a
derivative of the Sumerian DUG, DU meaning "act" or "do". (Deimel,
79) This compound word means "rise" or "get up". The second word
"témusz" or "dunguz" is the word which has changed the most. We
should consider historical linguistics and recognize that "d" changes
to "t". The vowels were all originally "u"; "témusz" was originally



DUMUZ which is just a variation of the word DUNGUZ. The sound
NG was originally pronounced as "m". The word was the name of a
god in Phoenicia and Babylon, TAMUZ. (TAMUZ was also the
Sumerian name for Gilgamesh) This name can be found in the
Sumerian name DUMUZI ABSU. The meaning of DUMU is "boy", "ZI"
means "faithful" and ABSU means "ocean". ABSU or ZU-AB means
"water-house" or "water-inn". (Hommel: 1-6) According to the
Sumerian legends, the ocean was the night-time residence of the
Sun-god. László Pass says that the name DUMUZI ABSU means "the
watery home of the god DUMUZ." The name DUMUZ can also be
found in the Hungarian legends. Prince Csaba (the youngest son of
Atilla) made the Hun/Magyar leaders swear allegiance to the god
Damaszek so that they could go and reconquer the country of Atilla
in the Carpathian Basin. The name DUNGUZ appears as the name of
one of the sons of Atilla in a slightly different form - Dengizing. One
of the Pecheneg princes was called Tonuzoba.
The word "szúr" in the second line, is SUR in Sumerian and means
"squeeze" or "give birth" (Precizion, 266-154). The next word "aga"
is RA in Sumerian and means "clear, shiny or brilliant" (Deimel: 189)
In this case it means the brightness of the sunrise. In the old Magyar
language, it was "reg" which in the old Paloc dialect became "regvel"
later becoming "reggel" which now means "morning". The second
part of the word was "ga" which means "house, home".
The word "digi" in Sumerian DIG means "overflow" or "flood"
(Deimel: 83) In this case it means "flood" of light. The next word
"daga", in Sumerian DAG means "spread, expand" (Hommel: 17-20).
In this case it means "spread or swell".
"AI" ALAG, in the fourth line means "to cut or chop".[21] It means
here "to cut". "bale", Sumerian BAL means "take away or remove"
(Deimel: 25). "Bambusz" is present in the vocabulary of the Szekels,



today and was in their vocabulary before they became Christian.
"Bambusz" was the name of the spirit of darkness and was used to
scare or threaten children when they misbehaved. The original
Sumerian name might have been BAR-BUZ. BAR in Sumerian meant
"sun, light". BUZ meant "destruction, deserted". The word BUZ
appears in the Hungarian word for a club type of weapon
"buzogány". The meaning of the complete rhyme is: "Wake up,
DUNGUZ, give birth to the morning, flood the light and cut and
chase BAMBUS."
This little rhyme was used at the holiday of the winter solstice
which the ancient people celebrated from December 21 for nine
days, celebrating the victory of light over darkness or goodness over
evil. To erase this ancient holiday, in A.D. 353, the Christian Church
in the Vatican ordered that the birth of Jesus should be celebrated
right in the middle of this holiday, on December 25. This is why the
Hungarian word for Christmas, "Karácsony", is not of Slav or German
origin as is often believed, but is an ancient Magyar or Sumerian
word GURU-SUN which means "turn from the darkness".
This little counting-verse can also be found among the Finnish
people but it is much more unrecognizable:
En ten dem
So raka tem
So raka tike taka
Ela bela boms



Pakkela, the author of the Finnish short story, "The boyish girl"
mentions that this rhyme has been well-known to the Finnish
children for a long time.
Dr. András Zakar, who was the secretary to Cardinal József
Mindszenty and author of many historical researches, remarked that
ancient remains can be found in the literature of the Magyar and the
Finn peoples but that their mutual roots are found in the southern
territory of Sumer and not in the Siberian tundra. The Magyar
Sumerian connection was stronger than that of the Finns and the
Sumerians.
Zoltán Kodaly and Francis G. Galpin influenced Professor Badiny
to compare the Sumerian and Hungarian music.[22] To do this,
Professor Badiny says that we should follow Galpin's methods.
Galpin compared the notes of the Sumerian musical instruments with
the Babylonian, Assyrian and Hebrew liturgical music. Because this is
an acceptable method, the comparison of the Sumerian-Magyar
musical connections can be studied in this way. These are the steps
to follow:
1. Become acquainted with the Sumerian instruments.
2. Compare the Sumerian and Hungarian musical instruments.
3. Recognize the Sumerian scale and catalogue of staffs and
compare this with the Hungarian.
4. Continue with the methods of Galpin and add to his researches
using information to which he did not have access because the first
publication of Sumerian music was published in 1977 by University of
Berkeley, California.



Galpin categorized the Sumerian instruments into three groups, (i)
drums and percussion instruments, (ii) wind instruments and (iii)
string instruments.
(i) Percussion instruments. The first surprise is that the
Hungarians call the drum "dob" just as the Sumerians did. Three
cuneiform signs exist signifying "drum" but the Sumerologists who
do not speak Hungarian pronounce these as "dub" not "dob". The
cuneiform sign for "drum" can be recognized on the Sumerian seals
placed before the name of a god or a priest-king, but then it must be
read BALAD-DI which means "law-drum". The Sumerian custom of
announcing a new law was to play a drum-roll to call the people
together before the announcement of the new law. In Hungary, but
not in the rest of Europe, this custom exists today. Galpin mentions a
Sumerian musical instrument which he calls "sistrum" for which he
cannot find a Sumerian name. This "sistrum" is identical to the
Hungarian instrument, the jinglers (csörgő).
(ii) Wind instruments. The Sumerians had two kinds of pipe, just
as the Hungarians do, the short shepherd's pipe and the long
shepherd's pipe. According to Galpin, the Sumerian name for the
short pipe was TI-GI and it had three finger holes on top. On a fourth
hole they were able to play melodies in a diatonic scale. We do not
know for sure the name of the long pipe. In the cuneiform texts, in
which musical instruments are mentioned, it is called GI-BU which
means "reed" which is blown or GI-GID which means "long reed".
Badiny believes the Sumerian name is BU-RU-LA which is "Furulya"
in Hungarian. Whistles made from reeds or weeping willow are called
SIP in Sumerian and also in Hungarian. Archeologists have found
Sumerian music for the whistle which was dedicated to the god EN
LIL. The text of this music was: "the shepherds sat down and played
to EN-LIL a soothing melody on their reed whistles." In this text,
according to Professor Badiny, the Sumerian word IR meant the



same thing as the ancient Magyar "ir", that is, "soothing". Galpin
mentions whistles from all over the world, but omitted to mention the
Hungarian whistles, yet the Hungarian museums are full of the same
kind of double-whistles which were found in Mesopotamia, made of
wood or copper. Innana left instructions that, on the feast of Dumuzi,
the Sumerians should play pipes ornamented with lapiz lazuli and
pearls. Ornamented whistles and whistles made of silver can be
found in Hungary. Galpin mentions one more wind instrument which
he names KITMU. This word can be found only in the Labat lexicon,
in the Akkadian word list. It is an Akkadian word which meant in
Sumerian "black opener". In Sumerian this was TAR-AG. These
whistles in the Hungarian museums are called the "Török" pipes but
in the time of the Kuruc, in the early eighteenth century, they were
called "tárogató".
Most of the horns or trumpets which were made in Sumer and in
Hungary were made from the horns of the cattle. The horns were
originally used for calling purposes. In the cuneiform writings of the
time of Gudea, the horn is written SI-MU. According to Professor
Badiny, the present Hungarian word for horn - "Szarv" is derived
from the ancient Magyar word SI. Many Hungarian words are derived
from this ancient word, such as "szigony" (anchor), "szivarvány"
(rainbow) (a pair of horns in the sky).
(iii) The string instruments. The Sumerians used two kinds of
harps, the horizontal and the vertical. The vertical harp was plucked
with the fingers. This action was expressed by the Sumerian word
PAN-TAG-GA or PAN-GATAG which is almost identical to the
Hungarian word for the same action "pengetek". The Sumerian seals
show horizontal harps or dulcimers which are played with a small
hammer-type instrument, as is the Hungarian cimbalom. The vertical
harp itself is not found among the ancient Hungarian musical
instruments, maybe because of its large dimensions which would



make it cumbersome to carry during the migrations. The zither was a
horizontal instrument resembling the harp and is commonly used in
Hungarian
folk music. The Sumerians also had instruments identical to the
Hungarian lute, lyre or "koboz". The Sumerian name for the lyre was
PAN-TUR which means smaller strap or ribbon in Hungarian "pant"
or "pantlika".
Almost all of the Sumerian instruments can be found among the
Hungarian musical instruments. All the drums and all types of
whistles. They had the simple whistle, the double whistle, and
compound pipes of five and seven whistles, all made from reeds.
The length of the pipes determined the pitch of the sound. The
measurements and shape of the shepherd's pipes are identical in
Sumer and Hungary. The shape and purpose of the horns is also
identical. The string instruments are all identical except for the fact
that the vertical harp is missing among the Hungarians. Galpin could
not identify one of the Sumerian instruments but described it and its
description fits the Hungarian hurdy-gurdy. In northern Hungary and
in Transdanubia, the bagpipe can be played with the diatonic scale.
This instrument must have been a very popular instrument in
Hungary because its name - "duda" - appears in a family name
Dudas - all across Hungary. The name "Dudas" means bagpipe
player. The Sumerian sign, L. 574, is pronounced DUDU and means
an instrument like the bagpipe. The German name for bagpipe is
"Dudelsack" which may come from the Hungarian word "dudal"
which means "to play the bagpipe" and "dudol" which means "to
hum". Rattles and jinglers were popular among the Sumerians and
the Magyars.
The possession of identical instruments shows the probability of a
similar musical development. Béla Bartok traveled to Anatolia and



Mesopotamia in 1936, probably to research this similarity, and he
recorded on a phonograph 90 folk songs. In 1937, he published his
remarks about these folksongs in the issues No. 2, 4 and 5 of a
publication called "Nyugat", under the title "Népdal gyűjtés
Törökországban". He says:
"The master of the house, without much persuasion started to
sing a song... I could hardly believe my ears, because the melody
was just like an ancient Magyar refrain." He continues: "The fact that
it is possible to identify such a relationship raises this subject to
international importance. There is nowhere in the world, at least to
my knowledge, another case where the history of folk music goes
back so many centuries and where such an indisputable relationship
can be established."
Bartok also stated that the musical origins of the Turks and the
Magyars go back to the sixth and seventh centuries A.D. but at that
time the ancestors of the Anatolian Turks lived on the borders of
Eastern Europe and Central Asia and the ancestors of the Magyars
lived in the territories of the Caspian and Black Seas. Bartok
concluded that the folk music of both the Turks and the Magyars
must have come from a mutual ancestor and dates back a minimum
of 1500 years.[23]
According to Bartok and Kodaly, the ancient origins of the
Hungarian music are found in the East. Not only are the Hungarian
pentatonic melodies identical to those of the East but, in both
territories, the pentatonic scale was based on a scale with three
intervals and had a repetitive format. Kodaly said that this scale
could have been an independent development among peoples who
could not have had a connection with each other such as the
Africans, the North American Indians, the Celts and the Chinese, but
the obvious identical character of the structure of the melody, the



phraseology, and the rhythm of the Hungarian music to that of
Western and Central Asia indicates that it originated in that territory.
He also says that if we find such an identity between the music of
the Magyars and the people remaining in these territories, we cannot
conclude otherwise than that, at the time that the Magyars broke
away from these peoples, this musical heritage was already
established and the Magyars brought this ancient musical heritage
with them, when they migrated to the west. Today the Hungarian
musical culture is the farthest reaching branch of the Asian musical
culture which spread from Central Asia to the Black Sea and beyond.
Kodaly studied the ancient Hungarian musical origins for almost
three decades and he came to the conclusion: "The Magyars
brought their musical culture together with their language, from their
ancient home."[24]
Dr. Badiny writes that the Hungarian instrumental folk music and
folk songs are a direct continuation of the MAH-GAR or Sumerian
melodies. the origin of the Hungarian word "nóta" meaning "song,
melody" is Sumerian. The analysis of this word emphasizes how well
the Sumerian melodies and the Hungarian songs correspond in their
psychological effects. Foreigners say that the Magyars take their
pleasure sadly. The Sumerian word for "song" was NO-TA which
resisted any linguistic change and can be traced back 5000 years.
Both syllables have independent meanings which combined give the
new meaning of the word NO-TA. NO or NA which was pronounced
"NO" means "sorrow" and also "stone" both of which are heavy. In
the ancient Magyar language too, the meaning of "sorrow" and
"stone" was expressed by "no". The second syllable, TA, was a suffix
indicating departure. Even today the Hungarian mother says to her
child "We are going Tata" when they are going somewhere. The
ancient meaning of the ancient word NO-TA was "leaving sorrow
behind". In their music, Hungarians leave their sorrow behind while



they take their pleasure sadly. Many of the Hungarian melodies are
sad but at the same time they act as a catharsis in the same way that
the "blues" acted for the African slaves in America. We have to
acknowledge the antiquity of the Magyar language and its richness
for, even at the time of the Sumerians, the healing power of music
was accurately expressed in the word NO-TA. Anne Drafkorn Kilmer
and her associates at the University of California at Berkeley
published 'Sounds from Silence" in 1976. They deciphered some
cuneiform signs which denoted musical notations. They believed
that this was a Hurrite melody from 1400 B.C. but they noted that
this same melody was known in the cities of Ur and Nippur 2000
years earlier. Professor Badiny sent this melody to Dr. Domonkos, the
musical director of an orchestra in Los Angeles who, with his
associates, made a comparison between the Sumerian/Hurrite
melody and a Hungarian melody which begins:
"Szivárványhavasan...", finding them to be identical. This same
melody, written in a tritonic scale was found among the ancient folk
songs collected by Bartok and Kodaly. There was not just a
resemblance between the melodies but they were found to be
identical.
Both Bartok and Kodaly state that the origins of the music of the
Magyars are to be found in Asia. Professor Badiny proves the
Sumerian connection. I would venture to say that the tritonic and
pentatonic scales were played by the ancient populace in the
Carpathian Basin and, just as the language, motifs and customs did,
traveled east to Asia and southeast to Mesopotamia with the
migrating Danubian peoples and returned at a later date with the
Sumerians, Huns, Avars and Magyars.
Men became civilized when they turned their energies to
concentrate on the quality of living rather than on mere existence.
Culture is the intellectual development applied to every aspect of life,



metallurgy, art, ceramics, music, architecture, religion, mining, and
laws.
In human development the greatest leap forward was the
development of agriculture because thenceforth man was not at the
mercy of unpredictable conditions. Another important development
was the discovery of metallurgy in ancient times. The development
of durable metal tools allowed men to work the land more efficiently
and more easily.
John Dayton states: "Bognar-Kutzian (1972) placed the earliest
copper age of Europe in the Tisza Basin... This area, located inside
the great bend of the Carpathians, has rich native copper in the
south, and the copper of the Hungarian Erzgebirge and the Mátra
Mountains to the north. Hammer axes are found all over this area,
and ingots from the Bodrogkeresztur culture in Hungary show that a
trade in metals existed. "He states that these cultures date to the
first half of the third millennium, a thousand years earlier than
Gordon Childe suggested.[25]
There is yet another important observation. It is that the
widespread findings of the copper age axe-adzes in the Carpathian
Basin and the clay models of axes and adzes in Mesopotamia led
John Dayton to ask the following question about the Sumerians:
"How did these people know of the copper/bronze originals?"[26]
He credits Gordon Childe with identifying the source of the Near East
copper and bronze as somewhere along the Danube Valley.[27]
Childe "had thought that Sumerian prospectors had been
responsible for the exploitation of these ores in 'barbaric' Europe at
this time. It would appear, however, that copper melting and casting
were in existence in Europe by the first half of the Third Millennium
and spread from there to the Near East."[28]



Certain Sumerian tablets have been kept at the Museum of the
University of Pennsylvania. (N.I 1117, 2337, 2473, 2742) Professor
Samuel Noah Kramer of the University of Pennsylvania mentions the
decipherment of these tablets in his book: Sumerian Mythology,
(1963), in the chapter on the creation of the pickaxe. In this chapter
he calls the axe-adze "the pickaxe". In Sumerian times the pickaxe
was revered and played a very important religious role. Professor
Kramer states that all the writings on the tablets are very easily
deciphered except for a few sections which cannot be understood.
[29] Professor Badiny says that no doubt we cannot yet understand
everthing from that age. But all the Sumerian literary texts added
together will help us to understand. Professor Kramer was writing in
1963. Since then, a number of emigrant Hungarian Sumerologists,
have been working on the decipherment of these tablets and they
have successfully deciphered those parts which Professor Kramer
stated could not be understood. Their decipherments reveal amazing
information about the Sumerian religious world. Instead of "the
Creation of the Pickaxe" they gave the title: "The Covenant".[30]
The following is the decipherment:
1. EN-LIL, according to his unchangeable desire, separated
Heaven from Earth and the Earth departed far from Heaven.
2. EN-LIL dug out the seed from the inside of the earth so that
wheat could be grown from it according to the law.
3. EN-LIL appointed the pickaxe to be the symbol of the alliance
between Heaven and Earth and ordered that work was the duty of
the pickaxe and the reed basket.
4. EN-LIL exalted the pickaxe made of gold and its container
made of silver. The head of the axe was of lapiz-lazuli and was as
strong as the heavenly bull which was able to move floodgates.



5. After EN-LIL had created the pickaxe in this way, and had
decreed its fate, He took the holy crown from his head and set it on
the head of EM-BAR, whom he had sent down to earth before that.
He now looked down on them with favor.
6. The inhabitants of Heaven surrounded them and placed the
holy pickaxe in front of them.
7. The inhabitants of Heaven, uttered prayers to EN-LIL and then,
with a heavenly chorus, gave EN-LILʼs holy pickaxe to the earthly
EM-BAR so that he might use it as needed. (In Hungarian today,
"man" is "ember".)
8. The heavenly chorus sang in this way: "Take EN-LILʼs holy
pickaxe as an everlasting covenant. We declare a covenant between
us and you and those who come after you.
9. IZ-TEN, through EN-LIL, gave the Earth and the Tree of
Knowledge to you and your descendants for ever more. Settle and
multiply on the rich territories of the four rivers. (IZ-TEN in Hungarian
is "Isten" and means "God".)
10. The Holy Pickaxe is the symbol of the Covenant between us
and you, who on the earthly place with the result of work, will build
IZ-TEN's earthly empire. The Covenant of the Holy Pickaxe will allow
you to rule the world.
11. Therefore we order all of your descendants to live and work
with the power of the Covenant Pickaxe. Keep the pickaxe in your
hand and use it well for the glory of EN-LIL."
12. When EN-LIL saw his golden Pickaxe in the hands of EM-BAR
who settled on the earth, he shot a bolt of lightning at the Pickaxe
and his voice sounded like thunder on the earth: "I made a Covenant



with you EM-BAR of Kos. With the power of the Pickaxe. you will be
the Master of the World as long as you serve with loyalty and keep
my Covenant."
13. The inhabitants of Heaven helped the Kassites on the earth,
according to the Covenant. Abundance and happiness was on the
Earth under the strength of the Pickaxe.
14. The Pickaxe built cities and the house of the Pickaxe became
the sanctuary of the truth but the house which rebels against the
Covenant, the home of disobedience, is the destroyer of the Pickaxe.
15. The Pickaxe cuts off the head of Evil, throws down its crown
and cuts out its roots, but the Tree of Life which grows the Flower of
Goodness is its helper and defender.
16. The father of EN-LIL decreed the duty of the Pickaxe and,
under the power of the Covenant between Heaven and Earth,
ordered that the Pickaxe be glorified for all eternity.
17. The inhabitants of Heaven kept their Covenant well because as
the light of the soul leaves the body of the earthly EM-BAR, he has
power to form and rule the earth and he continues the work of
creation, according to the will of IZ-TEN. In the same way, among the
inhabitants of Heaven, EN-KI was the one who created with the
power of EN-LIL, every other material and body on the earth.
18. EN-KI, according to the Covenant, blessed the country of the
Tree of Knowledge with trees, plants, birds, and animals and caused
them to multiply all over the earth and he hid gold, silver, copper and
all kinds of metals inside the earth. IS-KUR, one of the inhabitants of
Heaven, became the caretaker of all these because it was he who
brought gold and silver to Earth from Heaven.



19. After this, EN-KI filled the four rivers with an abundance of
fish. The heavenly caretaker of the waters was EN-BI-LU-LU.
20. The sons of EM-BAR, with the power of the Tree of
Knowledge, created the plough and the yoke. They formed them
with the pickaxe. They planted the seeds which they received from
EN-LIL and the Earth became rich in harvests of grain. The grain
beautified the fields of the earth. The Pickaxe built irrigating canals
and EN-KI appointed EN-KIM-DU, one of the inhabitants of Heaven,
as caretaker of the canals.
21. Abundance and happiness filled the Earth. The people started
to build houses and KABTA, an inhabitant of Heaven, taught the
descendants of KUS to make bricks and the frame for the bricks. (In
Hungarian, even now, the frame is called "kapta".)
22. The animals multiplied. They built stables for them. They
milked them. EN-KI wanted DUMUZI, the loyal shepherd of Heaven,
to teach the people of EN-LIL to care for the animals and to use their
milk. This is the way the inhabitants of Heaven kept the Covenant
with the people of the Holy Pickaxe, the people of EN-LIL, who were
the descendants of KUS.
It has already been mentioned that Professor Samuel Noah Kramer
observed the linguistic connections between the Sumerians and the
Ural Altaic peoples.[31]
Árpád's Magyars brought with them the ancient religious view of
the Magus religion. They not only wrote with the runic script on rods
which could easily be destroyed but they also painted, on the walls
of the churches, paintings representing the ancient symbols of the
Magus religion. In the chapel of the castle of Esztergom one such
symbol is to be found, on a lion painted on the wall. This symbol is
the four triangles on the side of the lion. This is the only lion



remaining on this wall. According to Professor Badiny, there were
originally fourteen of them but they have been erased.[32]
Replica of the Lion of Esztergom
The ancient Sumerian Magus religious beliefs were not accepted
by the followers of the new religion, Christianity. Therefore the
Christians simply painted over the lions in order to erase them. This
action fortunately preserved them for a long time but now only one
remains until the present. In time, the upper layer of paint peeled off
and the original picture of the lion reappeared. This became one of
the strongest proofs of the ancient connections of the Hungarians.
The word for lion in Sumerian was UR-MAH or MAH-UR. MAH meant
"great, powerful and knowledgeable". In astrology, the Lion



constellation was the house of the sun, which beamed its blessings
on every living creature. It is interesting to note that a few Carpathian
Mountains have the name "Magura" which is similar to MAH-UR.
The ancient autochthonous people in the Carpathian Basin and the
Árpád Magyars had religious views which were similar to those of the
Sumerian Magus religion. The Sumerian form of government was a
theocracy. To the Sumerians, their priest-king was the representative
of God. They believed that he was descended from God and they
called him PA-TE-SI. The similarity between the Turanian and
Sumerian religious views was first recognized by François
Lenormand and later by Von Orelli who writes: "The ancient
Sumerian religion appears to be similar to that of the Turanian
peoples. They believed in spirits and Magi."[33] Professor Badiny
mentions many other researchers who are of the same opinion:
Armin Vambéry, Holger Pedersen, Fritz Hommel and Thureau
Dangin.[34] These similarities are a strong proof of the Sumerian
Hungarian connection. Among the Turanian peoples, as among the
Sumerians, the Mother Goddess was known as the Queen of
Heaven. Like the Sumerians, the Turanian peoples believed that their
leaders and their people were of divine origin. The Magyars had a
similar belief. Antal Endrey writes about the Magyar legend of Hunor
and Magor, who were believed to be of divine origin as the sons of
Nimrud.[35]
Because they were of divine origin, the Huns and the Magyars
took on the name KI-EN-GIR which means "the children of God". In
the same way, BE-EL-GAR (Bulgar) means "the children of Baal". The
divine origin of the HUN-GAR people can also be found in the
cuneiform tablets. It is written that the HUN-GAR were the first
people on the earth. The Sumerians believed that man appeared on
earth when the constellation of Aries was in ascendance.
Astrologists still name Aries as the first constellation of the Zodiac.



The Sumerian name for Aries was MUL-LU-HUN-GA, the meaning of
which was Hun men's house in the stars. Here originated the belief
that the Hun descendants were all the descendants of the Ram
(Aries) (Hungarian KOS , pronounced "kosh"). In mythology and in
the Bible, the constellation of Aries was called KUSH. According to
the Semites, KUSH was the father of NIMROD. The Kush or Cush
nation (Kassites) originates from the constellation of KUSH as the
descendants of DU-MU-ZI. René Labat says that, up to the time of
Hammurabi, the name of the constellation of the Ram was written
KUS (L. 318) (pronounced Kush). In the First Babylonian dynasty, in
the time of Hammurabi, the syllables were changed. What was
written KUS became FU, and NAP became UTU or BABBAR. The last
Sumerian king, LUGALZAGGISI, declared himself to be the
descendant of KUS.[36] Around 2400 B.C., the Sumerian people
believed that they were the descendants of KUS.
Among the Magyars, the belief in divine origin can be found in the
legend of the Dream of Emese. The cult of the Mother Goddess can
be found among the Magyars and among the Sumerians. Both
peoples honored the Mother Goddess as the symbol of motherhood.
It was under the Semitic influence that the Mother Goddess lost her
title of Queen of Heaven and received the title of Goddess of Love
with the name of ISTAR (Ishtar). Their attributes were not the same.
ISTAR stated about herself "I am the great prostitute". This statement
ruined the public morals. While the Hungarian mother lived by the
laws of the Queen of Heaven, INNANA, or Boldogasszsony, there
was no fear that the Hungarian nation would die out because of a
lack of population.
In the old cosmological religious view, the power of God was
manifested in everything on earth and in the sky. Thus, in the city of
Ur, the Sumerians worshipped God whose power was manifested in
the Moon. In Sippar and Nippur, the Sun was the manifestation of



God. The Christians mistakenly believed that the ancient people
worshipped the Sun and the Moon and that they were idol
worshippers. No matter which manifestation they revered, the
Mother Goddess was the unifying force of their religion. Among the
Turanian peoples, the Mother Goddess had the title of the Queen of
Heaven and she was represented by the planet Venus. (The Romans
worshipped Venus as the Goddess of Love.) The light rays from
Venus which reached the earth were the godly blessing on earth.
The earthly representations of Venus were the many beautifully
formed statues of women found among the Turanian peoples. Those
who revered the Sun, placed a lion at her feet. Those who revered
the Moon placed a bull at her feet or just the horn of a bull. In
Carthage, she is found with the bull's horn. In the Parthian Empire,
her name was ANAHIT and a lion was at her feet. This representation
is also found among the Sumerians and Magyars.
It is interesting to note that the Puns, whose capital was Carthage,
were also supposed to be of unknown origins, as were many
Turanian peoples. The names Hun and Pun sound very similar. The
religious view of the Puns indicates Turanian connections. Maybe
this is why the Romans had to destroy them as they later tried to
destroy the Huns.
Among the ancient peoples, obtaining food and building families
were the two most important life functions. The religious view
emphasized their importance. The most effective time period for
supplying food and the continuation of life was when the center of
strength was most effective. The best time for planting was when
the planet Venus, or DIL-BAD, came into line with the star BETA
VIRGINIS and the star SPICA. This season was symbolized by the
date-palm and the ear of grain. These were represented on the
rosetta on the flank of the lion at the foot of the Mother Goddess and
on the lion of Esztergom. These two plants gave the people the two



major sources of food in Mesopotamia. This is why the Sumerians
represented the Alpha Virginis star (Spica) and the Beta Virginis, by
the ear of grain and the date palm. Both stars were included in the
constellation of Virgo. When Venus enters the constellation of Virgo,
the constellation becomes the Leo Constellation and in this time
period the planet Venus receives the name of Leo and there are two
lions in the Heavens. This is why, in the statue of INNANA, the
rosetta is between the two lions at her Feet.
As we learned in "The Covenant" the God, EN-LIL created Heaven
and Earth and appointed the God, ENKI, to be the creator of every
good thing on earth. The Sumerians held ENKI in high regard and
addressed him to intervene for them with the all-powerful EN-LIL.
When the Semites overran Sumer, they adopted the Sumerian
religion and gave the attributes of the Sumerian gods to the Semitic
gods. Thus the Semitic God, EA, received all the honors previously
enjoyed by ENKI. This is why, on the clay tablets, they marked the
high rank of EA with four cuneiform signs in the same way as it can
be seen on the lion at Esztergom. These four cuneiform signs on the
side of the lion indicate the rank of the god EA and his earthly
representation, the king.
The number 40 is a magical number in the royal power. The
highest advisory board of the Árpád Magyars, which was named
Ukkin-Puhru, was made up of 40 members and the Avar Kagan was
buried with 40 arrows.[37]
Because the Semitic conquest took place in Mesopotamia and the
semiticized religious remains can be found in Esztergom, this means
that the Árpád Magyars must have had some connections with the
religious customs of Mesopotamia. The lions in Esztergom were
painted by the Magyars. The Sabirs (Subareans), who came from
Mesopotamia, joined the Magyars and became known as the Megyer



nation. Perhaps this is the biggest proof that the Magyars were
connected to the Sumerians who, according to some linguists, called
themselves MAH-GAR or in today's language Magyar. Another
Sumerian/Magyar connection which I have mentioned before are the
many "Sumerian" geographical names which were found in the
Carpathian Basin. They bear witness to a Sumerian/Magyar ancient
populace because these geographical names go back to 3000 B.C.
Among the most important Sumerian religious holidays were
those which honored the fertility goddess, which even now can be
found among the Roman Catholic holidays of the Hungarians. Lajos
Kálmány, a Catholic priest, in the middle of the last century, gathered
a number of ancient religious customs found among the Hungarian
people, which were not included in the Catholic liturgy, but rather
were the remains of the ancient religion which honored the Mother
Goddess. They honored the Great Mother Goddess and seven other
Goddesses - the Goddess of Birth, the Goddess of Sorrow, the
Goddess of the Harvest, the Goddess of the Candle Blessing, the
Goddess of Help, the Goddess of the Month and the youngest, the
Virgin Mother, who became the Virgin Mary in the Christian religion.
The ancient religion prohibited all physical work on Tuesday because
that was the day which honored the Mother-Goddess yet it was a
good omen to start an important task on that day. For example the
incubation of eggs. Women who could not conceive had to fast for
nine consecutive Tuesdays to elicit the aid of the Mother-Goddess.
From these holidays we can see that the great Mother-Goddess was
the giver and protector of life, the giver of plenty and the protector of
regeneration of man and animals.[38]
József Huszka found among the Magyar folk motifs a theme of
decoration around the picture of Astarte, a later name for the
Mother-Goddess.[39] Most recently, in the folk motifs, Gábor Papp
has found evidence of Sun-worship.[40]



Ida Bobula says that almost every ancient religion has a concept of
Magna Mater but the Hungarian "Boldogasszony" or Mother
Goddess (ancient pronunciation: Badugasan) was in Sumerian BAU
DUG ASAN. In Sumerian, the meaning of BAU was "food-giver", DUG
was "benign, benevolent" and ASAN meant "goddess". The similarity
between the Hungarian and Sumerian Mother-Goddess is very
obvious and cannot be accidental. We know BAU from the cuneiform
signs and pictures on the clay tablets. Most often she is represented
as a lady with a crown and a ruffled skirt, sitting on a throne with a
tree of life in front of her or a life branch which carries fruit in her
hand, or a goblet which signifies her identity. There is often a dog
and a bird in the picture. On the crest of the city of Lagash can be
seen a Sun-bird (or Turul) with open wings. This is an obvious
connection with the Árpád crest and the legend of the Hungarian
origins.[41]
Here I show a Babylonian seal of a lion on which the four
cuneiform signs are clearly visible.[42]
Picture courtesy of Dr. Badiny
These signs indicate the rank of EA. Now if we study them closely,
we will see that these signs create a picture of three hills, an ancient
pictograph already existing before the discovery of writing. From
here it was adopted into the cuneiform sign with the meaning of



MAD or KUR. MAD means "country" and KUR often means
"mountain" or "mountainous country". The origin of this symbol is
very ancient. It is possible that it originated among the
autochthonous people of the Carpathian Basin. Many historians
suggest that the three hillocks represent the three mountains in the
Carpathian mountain chain, the Tátra, Mátra and Fátra. The symbol
of the three hillocks can be found on the shield of Árpád. Is it
possible that the migrating Danubian people took this symbol with
them to Mesopotamia and it became a symbol of the Árpád Magyars
to remind them of the three mountains of their homeland? Recently
the Slovaks have adopted the symbol from the Hungarian shield
because the three mountains were given to them by the treaty of
Trianon.
Just as these three hillocks are a proof of the Sumerian-Hungarian
connections, so is the Hungarian word "kapu" which means "gate".
The word "Kapu" is important because it is made up of two syllables.
The first syllable "ka" is KA in Sumerian and means "gate". The
second syllable "pu" is PU in Akkadian and also means "gate".
Therefore this word originated from the time when the two peoples,
the Sumerians and the Akkadians, intermarried and the Magyars
probably adopted it from the Subareans.
Another meaning of these four cuneiform signs on the side of the
lion is "the lord of the four directions, north south east and west."
This title was used by the Sumerian rulers. Another symbol of the
lord of the four directions is the cross with four equal arms which
was used by the Magyars of the early Árpád era on their coins,
indicating again their connections with Mesopotamia.
Looking again at the picture of the lion of Esztergom, we will see
that there appears to be a whip extending from the mane of the lion
to the end of its tail. If we count the dots marked on the whip, we find



exactly fifty. These fifty dots represent fifty months or the exact time
it takes for the planet Venus to complete its path in the heavens,
bringing blessings and abundance to the earth. In the fiftieth month
everything comes to bloom in abundance. The cuneiform sign No.
9.428 from the Vatican collection states that "the whip of ERU is
lashing above the tail of UR-GULA".[43]
P. Grossman states that the first star of the tail of the Lion, which
today we call Denebola, was the Star of the Whip.[44] In the beliefs
of the eastern peoples, this star was the Star of Misfortune and
Death. Because the lion is the symbol of the power which came from
Heaven, the punishment of Heaven is included just as the whip of
God strikes the ruler who does not do his duty.[45] The tradition of
the Whip of God was so deeply rooted in the religious beliefs that it
can be found everywhere among the Turanian peoples. Even those
peoples who did not know the lion, developed motifs which included
the whip of God as the tail of their totem animal. If this custom was
so widespread in the Scythian Hun world, then why do the present
day historians declare that Atilla's statement that he was the Whip of
God (Scourge of God) is absurd? In the Scythian-Hun world there
was no slavery. Even prisoners of war, with valiant deeds, were able
to raise themselves to the highest ranks. When Atilla learned the
social structures of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires, and
the fact that they both had millions of slaves, it was no wonder that
he declared himself to he the Scourge of God and started out to try
to free those slaves.
Another basic belief of the ancient Magyar religion was that the
center of the world or the center of the heavens was in the place
where the golden apple was found. We must know that there were
many fairy tales about the tree which reaches to heaven, on the
highest level of which everything that grows is gold. This is the
empire of the Sun, where the creator of every goodness, the Sun



God is living. From here originates the orb of state in Royal
Kingdoms. That belief also existed in the Sumerian world, in the third
Ur dynasty in the 21st century B.C. The Sumerians believed that the
Center of Heaven is the North Star.
Even after a thousand years of Christianity, there are still some
traces of the religion of the Sun God among the peasants in
Hungary. The Hungarian people accepted those parts of Christianity
which they were able to identify with the ancient religion. The dual
deity of the Sun and the Moon can be found in the Hungarian fine
arts and in poetry. (For example in the works of the poets, Endre Ady,
Atilla József, László Nagy and also in the paintings of Csontváry, one
of the most famous zodiacal painters.)
At the time of the Árpád homecoming, the custom of having two
kings was widespread. There was a king and sub-king or viceroy.
The King was of divine origin and was sacred and believed to be the
son of the Sun. Here we will see the origin of the Magyar title Kende
(king), according to Professor Badiny. EN-KI was the God of the
Sumerians who settled every goodness on the earth. This name can
be pronounced EN-KI or KI-EN. According to the Sumerian/Magyar
grammar, it makes no difference. It meant the lord of Knowledge or
the knowledge lord.
The first syllable of the Magyar word "kende", KEN is derived from
the Sumerian word KI-EN; the DE is the Sumerian DU which means
"to originate" or "to come" (Labat No. 206). The meaning of KI-EN
DU or "kende" is "originating from KI-EN or EN-KI" in other words "of
divine origin". This was the title of the King in the dual monarchy. The
title of the sub-king or viceroy was "gyula" which is derived from the
Sumerian word UR-GULA which is the same as the Sumerian name
for the constellation of Leo. (Later, the word "gyula" was replaced by
the word "nádor".) The sun reaches its strongest power in the



constellation of Leo so, in the earthly rule, the Kende reaches his
peak of power when unified with the Gyula. This is clearly a good
example of theocratic rule. The Kende and his queen were destined
to bring the power of the Sun-God into their Kingdom. At the same
time the Gyula and his queen were destined to bring the power of
the Moon-God to the earth. This was the conclusion of Sandor
Bosnyak.[46] In the theocratic customs of the Magyars, the two
worlds were divided in the following way: The world of the Sun and
the world of the Moon.
The World of the Sun
The Kende or Sun God ...represented by .......... Leo
Emese, the Sun-Queen ......................................Virgo
Judicial power. .................................................Libra
Police ...............................................................Scorpio
Traditions ........................................................Sagittarius
the Treasury ....................................................Capricorn
The World of the Moon
The Gyula or Moon-God ..represented by ...... Cancer



Leadership of the army. ..................................Gemini
Productivity and supplies .................................Taurus
the Army. ........................................................Aries
Education .........................................................Pisces
Health ............................................................Aquarius
We can see that the two earthly representatives of heaven were
destined to work for the benefit of the nation.
The Tree of Life motif is widespread among the Hungarian folk art.
The scientific term for the Tree of Life is the Symbol of Everlasting
Life. The Tree of Life or the Tree which reaches to Heaven ties the
center of the earth to the center of the Heavens and the North Star
is considered to be the center of the Heavens. According to the
beliefs of the Ural-Altaic peoples, before they came to the earth they
were living in the blue surroundings of the Tree which reaches to
Heaven. These folk beliefs symbolize that the Turanian people have
divine origins.
If we pick up a map of astronomy which deals with the changes in
the sky in the past ten thousand years, we will see that the Milky Way
is located on the outside and that the Constellations of Gemini and
Orion stretch into it and also the constellation of Aries (the Ram, in
Sumerian KUS), which brings the beginning of life. The Sumerian
name for the North Star was IBILU-E-MAH which meant "the house
of the youth who knows everything". The Babylonians accepted this
term but applied it to the son of ANU.
IBILU (L.144) = youth



E or HE (L.324) = house
MAH (L.57) = knowledgeable, powerful
The Magyar legends adopted these beliefs and called the North
Star the "Világügyelő .... the caretaker of the world".
The legend of the Caretaker of the World:
"When the world was created, God stretched up to the top of the
heavens and broke off a piece of the sun. From this piece of the sun,
he formed the first man and the first woman. Because a little piece of
the sun remained in his hand, he created man's two most faithful
servants, the horse and the dog. After the first night on earth, the
woman found a beautiful golden flower in front of her house. She
picked it, covered it with her kerchief and carried it happily to show it
to her husband. As they opened the kerchief together, instead of the
golden flower, they found a beautiful little baby boy who smiled at
them and addressed the woman as "Mother" and the man as
"Father". God commanded that the son of man be named
"Világügyelő" (Caretaker of the World) and ordained that he become
the teacher of the whole of mankind from the beginning to the end of
the world."
Here I have to mention again that in the Magyar language the word
"explain" is "magyaráz". Is it possible that there is a connection
between this and the legend? According to the legend, the North
Star is the home of the Caretaker of the World. A Sumerian



cuneiform tablet from 3000 B.C. states that the North Star, IBILU-E
MAH is the star of EN-LIL. This star belongs in the constellation of
Ursa Minor and Ursa Major. Because both constellations are the
helpers of the Virgin Mother, INNANA, then her son, the Caretaker of
the World, is in constant connection with her, the mother of
everything which is born on earth.[47] Only in the Hungarian folk
beliefs can those astrological connections be found. Therefore we
can presume that the Magyar people have very ancient origins.
