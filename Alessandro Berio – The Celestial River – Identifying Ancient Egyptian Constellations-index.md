SINO-PLATONIC PAPERS is an occasional series dedicated to making available to specialists and the interested public the results of research that, because of its unconventional or controversial nature, might otherwise go unpublished. The editor-in-chief actively encourages younger, not yet well established, scholars and independent authors to submit manuscripts for consideration. Contributions in any of the major scholarly languages of the world, including romanized modern standard Mandarin (MSM) and Japanese, are acceptable. In special circumstances, papers written in one of the Sinitic topolects (fangyan) may be considered for publication.
Although the chief focus of Sino-Platonic Papers is on the intercultural relations of China with other peoples, challenging and creative studies on a wide variety of philological subjects will be entertained. This series is not the place for safe, sober, and stodgy presentations. Sino- Platonic Papers prefers lively work that, while taking reasonable risks to advance the field, capitalizes on brilliant new insights into the development of civilization.
Submissions are regularly sent out to be refereed, and extensive editorial suggestions for revision may be offered.
Sino-Platonic Papers emphasizes substance over form. We do, however, strongly recommend that prospective authors consult our style guidelines at www.sino-platonic.org/stylesheet.doc. Manuscripts should be submitted as electronic files, preferably in Microsoft Word format. You may wish to use our sample document template, available here: www.sino-platonic.org/spp.dot.

The Celestial River:
Identifying the Ancient Egyptian Constellations

Abstract
WHILE the descriptions of many of the Greek constellations found in the works of Eudoxus (366 BC)
and in The Phaenomena of Aratus (275 BC) may have originated from an Assyrian source circa 1100 BC
(Schaeffer, 2006), many of the Greek constellations do not have a clear Mesopotamian precedent
(Rogers, 1998b). They may have been created around 2800 BC (±300 years) (Ovenden, 1966) by a
culture of “navigators” that could determine the cardinal directions by observing the circumpolar
constellations (Rogers, 1998b). Due to the paucity of reliable astronomical data on the constellations
of ancient Egypt (V. L. Davis), there is no consensus on their identity (DeYoung, 2000). This paper
proposes that a new opportunity has arisen for deciphering the ancient Egyptian night sky, based on
parallels between the iconography of the list of nomes, or administrative districts of Egypt, and the
classical constellations visible in Egypt circa 3100 BC.
This astronomical study of the night sky in ancient Egypt, using modern software (Voyager,
2009), demonstrates that the emblems of the districts of Upper and Lower Egypt represented ancient
constellations that were rising, setting, or culminating in sequence (table 1). The “emblem
constellations” indicate that the ancient Egyptians possessed early representations of many of the
classical constellations known to the Greeks, such as Leo ; Scorpius ; Aquila, the eagle
; the water-bearer, Aquarius ; Taurus ; Orion ; the dog of Canis Major ; and

Lepus, the rabbit . The analysis of the emblems of Upper and Lower Egypt enabled a
hypothetical identification of 36 ancient Egyptian constellations (table 2). Furthermore, 28 out of the
38 Egyptian constellations are nearly identical matches, both astronomically and iconographically,
when compared to the Ptolemaic list of 48 classical Greek constellations. Major new interpretations
for the Egyptian circumpolar constellations are also proposed.
Methodology
Why was Osiris worshipped at Abydos, Hatmehit, the fish goddess, worshipped at Mendes, or the ram
headed Amun worshipped at Thebes? Is there an explanation for the location of these cult centers in
specific ancient Egyptian cities? Could the Egyptians have laid out their kingdom according to a
divine principle, a “Nile in the sky” where terrestrial localities had cosmic equivalents?
Research of the sacred geography of ancient Egypt has focussed primarily on the celestial
alignments of temples and royal tombs with the cardinal directions, solstices, and heliacal risings of
important stars (Haack, 1984) (Clagett, 1995) (Spence, 2000) (Shaltout & Belmonte, 2005). The work of
talented astronomers and Egyptologists in the last 60 years since Neugebauer and Parker (1960), has
been hampered by a lack of clear archaeoastronomical evidence, thereby relying on scarce
astronomical texts and imagery such as those present in the interior lids of sarcophagi from the First
Intermediate Period and astronomical ceilings of the New Kingdom.
In 1916, the French archaeologist George Daressy theorized that the 22 nomes of Upper Egypt
had astrological and planetary alignments on a grand scale (Daressy, 1916). Without astronomy
software that could recreate the night sky for any given location and period of history, he was unable
to precisely analyze the rising and setting constellations as seen by an ancient Egyptian observer. To
test Daressy’s hypothesis it was necessary to recreate the night sky of ancient Egypt. This analysis uses
astronomy software set to the year 3100 BC and the coordinates of Memphis (30.57° N), capital of a
unified Egypt during the Old Kingdom. Although the nomes were clearly defined by the 5th dynasty
(Morkot, 2005), they can be traced back to the predynastic period of 3100 BC, when they first appeared
(Najovits, 2003). While this early date does not prove that the constellations were invented in ancient
Egypt (in fact, they may be prehistoric), it demonstrates that the emblems were an early and complete

list of the classical constellations, which falls within the estimates provided by Ovenden for their
creation (2800 BC, ± 300 years).
While previous studies, such as those by Lull and Belmonte, have proposed that the ancient
Egyptians possessed almost entirely unique constellations, perhaps with the exception of Leo, the
“divine lion,” known as mꜢı͗ in New Kingdom astronomical ceilings (Lull & Belmonte, 2006),
this paper proposes that they had many of the same constellations that were known to the Greeks.
One clear example is the constellation of the eagle, Aquila, which is symbolized in the name of four
different districts with various representations of the falcon: Upper Egyptian 5th and 18th ,
Lower Egyptian 3rd and 20th . These nomes represent the specific times when Aquila rises, sets,
and is in its upper culmination. The most logical explanation is that the Egyptians also had the Aquila
constellation, which the Babylonians called Aquila, MULÁ.MUSHEN , the “eagle.”
While there is no specific mention of emblem constellations in the limited trove of Egyptian
astronomical texts, this does not necessarily preclude their existence, especially since many of the
emblems symbolized the gods themselves (e.g., the Hare was symbolic of the rabbit goddess Unet)
who are present in Egyptian art and literature. Also, literary proof that the ancient Egyptians
associated the terrestrial Nile with a celestial Nile is supported by the Ptolemaic-era “Book of the
Faiyum,” a mythologized map of the Faiyum region, where deities are paired with their cult centers
and specific localities are linked with cosmic equivalents (Tait, 2003). This notion is reaffirmed by a
hymn to the sun disk Aten, from the 18th dynasty pharaoh, Akhenaten, which makes reference to a
“Nile in the sky”: “For you have set a Nile in the sky, that it may descend for them, and make waves
upon the mountains like the sea” (Simpson, 1973). Not only did the ancient Egyptians align their
temples to important stars, but perhaps they followed a guiding principle when drawing the
boundaries of the districts and establishing the cult centers of the Egyptian pantheon, and thereby
creating the Nile in the image of the heavens.
Confirming the celestial locations of the districts are the annual religious festivals (Schott,
1950) and the Cairo Calendar Papyrus of lucky and unlucky days (Bakir, 1966) that celebrated
particular deities and mythological events. Christian Leitz was the first to propose that the Cairo
Calendar Papyrus contained astronomical data, while Hardy proposed that it was a star almanac
(Hardy, 2003). More recently, a statistical analysis has revealed that the lucky and unlucky days

correspond to the synodic month and possibly even the variation of brightness of the star Algol
(Porceddu, Jetsu, Markkanen, & Toivari-Viitala, 2008). Following Porceddu et al., the astronomical
calculations for the Cairo Calendar Papyrus are set to the year 1224 BC.
Summarizing the methodology: first, the study compares the names of the districts with the
constellations visible on the horizon or in upper culmination positions in ancient Egypt, looking for
obvious iconographic and symbolic parallels with the classical constellations. Second, the analysis
groups nomes with similar iconography (e.g., falcons, water jars, lions, etc...) to determine if they
represent the same constellation but in different celestial positions, such as setting or rising. Third,
the paper finds philological or literary evidence for these constellations, in Egyptian, Greek, and
Babylonian sources, and also looks at early Arab names for some of the stars (aṣ-Ṣūfī, 1874). Fourth,
the research finds parallels between the patron gods and major cult centers of the nomes with the
associated constellations. Fifth, the paper complements this with an astrotheological analysis of
artistic representations in various sources, from the Book of the Dead to Ptolemaic era zodiacs. Finally,
the study confirms the celestial placements of the nomes with the festivals and events defined in the
Cairo Calendar Papyrus and other sources.

Notes to Table 2:
1. Cassiopeia closely resembles the shape of the “throne of horus” hieroglyph present in the
emblem of the second Upper Egyptian Nome. Unlike the Greeks who saw Cassiopeia as a
sitting queen, the Babylonians saw Cassiopeia as the Stag, MULLU.LIM, perhaps emblematic of

the horns of the animal. Like the bear of Ursa Major, this association of Cassiopeia spread to
several cultures around the world. The Quileute tribe of North America saw this constellation
as the “Giant Elk Skin.” The Sami saw it as elk antlers, and the Chuchkee of Siberia saw the
stars as five reindeers. According to La Lande, quoting from Firmicus and the Egyptian sphere
of Petosiris, there was a cerf “deer” constellation north of Pisces, while Bayer had the name
cerva for Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia sets with Aries, the ram, and with the star in Draco, Altais, the
Arabic “goat” (from more southernly latitudes such as Thebes). It is also in its lower
culmination with Aries, when the head of Capricorn is rising. However, it is too early to
confirm that, like the Babylonians, the Egyptians also saw Cassiopeia as the horns of a goat.
2. Wainwright argued that Cygnus was the falcon-headed god Anu, anw, (Wainwright, 1932)
which is highly unlikely given that the falcon was clearly the Aquila constellation. The ibis
nome coresponds to the setting of Cygnus, and it matches iconographically with the Greek
swan. In fact, the Daressy zodiac represented the ibis with the sign of Aquarius because
Cygnus sets along with the water-bearer.
3. The Ramesside Star Charts reference “the stars of the water,” which is probably Alphard
Hydrae. However, during the New Kingdom, when Alphard rose, Acamar was in its upper
culmination, and when it set, it was in its lower culmination. The star Acamar, “river’s end,” of
Eridanus, rises with Sirius, from the Southernmost longitude of Egypt at Abu Simbel circa 3100
BC. Sirius heralded the rising of the River Nile. It is in its upper culmination, when Aquarius
rises.
4. Hydra, the water serpent, could be emblematic of the horned viper with the water jars
depicted in the nome emblems.
5. The capital of the ninth nome of Lower Egypt, which corresponded to Orion setting and
Scorpius and Ophiucus, the serpent holder, rising, was called Busiris by the Greeks, or ḏdwt
by the Egyptians, written with the hieroglyphs of a hand holding a serpent.
6. Triangulum is in its upper culmination when Sirius rises. The star Alsciakaut, Arabic for
“thorn,” was in its upper culmination with Triangulum. The name spdt for Sirius means “thorn.”

I. The Emblem Constellations
Archaeologists found the world’s oldest astronomical stone circle in Nabta, Egypt, in an area that is
now desert but once contained a lake used by early pastoralists (McKim Malville, Schild, & Wendorf,
2008). Large stones delineate a circle with four “windows,” which align with the summer solstice and
the North and South poles. Possible alignments to Arcturus, Sirius, Orion, and Ursa Major have been
proposed, indicating that these constellation were sighted as far back as 4500 BC. The Egyptians
continued to align their monuments and temples to the stars, perhaps using a plumb line and
constellations such as Ursa Minor and Ursa Major to pinpoint north (Gingerich, 2000). It is no
coincidence that the Egyptian word for “star” sbꜢ is also the name for the plumb line
surveying instrument sbꜢ . To the Egyptians, having the physical world live in harmony with
the celestial world, maintaining order and balance, is the ideal they called mꜢꜤt .
A “celestial Egypt,” in which each administrative district corresponds to a constellation or
asterism, would imply a grand vision for the layout of their kingdom. The Egyptians divided the Nile
into nomes, or districts, called spt , each with a capital city and a patron god. According to
Daressy’s theory of a celestial Nile, sailing down the river was akin to journeying on the path of the
sun through the stars and constellations. In fact, the Milky Way itself was possibly seen as a “water
way,” perhaps the “Nile in the sky.” While Daressy’s concept was correct, the methodology presented
in this paper is more precise in aligning the constellations with both the Lower and Upper Egyptian
nomes (chart 1 and table 1). The present study determines that the nomes of Lower Egypt began on
Aquarius and ended on Leo, while the nomes of Upper Egypt began on Gemini, cycled through all the
signs, and ended on Capricorn.

CHART 1. Classical star map with Ptolemaic constellations compared to
nome emblems overlaid on a map of the sky circa 3100 BC as seen from
Memphis (30.57° N).
Leo, Aquila, and Triangulum
The 20th nome of Upper Egypt, spd , named after the falcon war god, who was the son of Sopdet,
the goddess of Sirius, provided initial evidence for aligning the emblems with the constellations. The
nome’s emblem was a plumed mummified falcon resting on a lion-shaped bier. This obscure symbol
can be deciphered by observing the same sky as an Egyptian priest, or hour-watcher wnwty ,
would have observed in Memphis, five thousand years ago. The star Sirius, whose heliacal rising
heralded the Egyptian new year, would break on the eastern horizon together with the star Algieba, of
Leo, represented in the emblem by the lion-shaped bier . At the same time as Algieba and Sirius
rose, the star Altair of the eagle constellation, Aquila, would set or “die” on the western horizon as
represented by the mummified falcon. Thus, all three stars, Sirius, Algieba, and Altair, would align
across the horizon (chart 2).

CHART 2. Canis Major and Leo rising, Aquila setting, and Triangulum
in upper culmination, representing Sopdu .
One more clue confirms the stellar identification of this nome. While Sirius and Algieba rose,
and Altair set, the constellation of Triangulum was in its upper culmination, which may have been
represented by the triangle hieroglyph spd, meaning “sharp,” both in Sopdu’s name and in the
name for Sirius itself as spdt . In fact, Eratosthenes linked this triangular constellation with the
Nile Delta. This stellar alignment, fused into the emblem of the 20th nome of Upper Egypt, suggests
the existence of Leo, Aquila, and Triangulum in the Egyptian night sky.

FIGURE 1. Daressy zodiac showing the falcon of Horus under the sign of
Sagittarius (image edited by author for clarity).
Corroborating the identification of Aquila as an Egyptian constellation, not just Graeco
Babylonian, is the Roman era Daressy Zodiac (fig. 1), which depicts three concentric rings. The outer
ring shows the Sphaera Graeca, the Hellenistic zodiac that survives to this day (Daressy, 1916). The
middle ring depicts the Sphaera Barbarica or “foreigner’s zodiac” with the zodiacal signs of the
Egyptian dodekaoros, which were also recorded by Teucros of Babylon (Boll, Jaʻfar ïbn Muhammad, &
Dyroff, 1903). The sign of Sagittarius corresponds to the falcon of Horus, presumably because Aquila
rises with Sagittarius.
Virgo
The nome of nḫn (Nekhen) , which was represented by a circle with two feathers, is emblematic of
the Pisces circlet, which sets opposite Virgo. One of the Egyptian star decans near Virgo was called bktı͗
, represented by a pregnant woman, while the name nḫn meant “child”. The town of nḫb
(Gr Eileithyiaspolis), at one time the capital of the nome of nḫn, was named by the Greeks after
the goddess of childbirth, Eilithyia. Nḫb was the cult center of nḫbt , the vulture goddess and
creatrix, emblematic of Upper Egypt. The Egyptians believed the vulture was a mystical self-creating,
virginal mother, because the Egyptian vulture shows no external visual differentiation between the
male and female of the species. The Egyptian word for “vulture,” mwt , also meant “mother.”

CHART 3. Spica setting with Aludra the “virgins” in lower culmination,
and Altair in upper culmination, representing the nome .
Sirius, the brightest star of Canis Major, was identified with the goddess Isis-Sothis, the
Egyptian mother goddess. Diodorus explains that the ritual procession of the Festival of Isis was led by
dogs, an association illustrated in a passage by Diodorus:
On the stele of Isis it runs: “I am Isis, the queen of every land... I am she who riseth in
the star that is in the Constellation of the Dog; by me was the city of Bubastus built.”
The capital of the 18th nome of Upper Egypt was a place for the worship of Anubis, the dog
headed god, as the city was known as the “House of Anubis.” This nome corresponded to the time at
which Canis Major’s star, Aludra, known as the “Virgins” to early Arab astronomers, was in its lower
culmination, and Spica, the brightest star in Virgo, the virgin, was setting (chart 3).
Libra and Hercules
The nome of the Oryx that corresponded to Auriga and the goat Capella, was the site of the
mythical battle between Horus and the god Seth as a gazelle. As Daressy discussed, the weight balance,
symbol of Libra, was the emblem of the capital of this district (Daressy, 1916). This identification with



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
21
the scales is explained by the fact that Libra rises opposite Aries, and sets opposite Auriga (chart 4),
which implies that the constellation of Libra was present in ancient Egypt.
The Cairo Calendar Papyrus describes how on the III Akhet 23, the mythological event “Ra
judges the dispute of Set and Horus” took place, which corresponded to October 9, when the sun was
in Libra. The Babylonians knew Libra as “the scales” MULZI.BA.AN.NA. Interestingly, the Chinese knew
the nearby constellation of Lupus as the “Trials” 頓頑, and part of Libra as “Executions” 折威. Another
asterism in Centaurus, also close to Libra, was called the “Railings” 衡, which means to “weigh or
measure.”
CHART 4. Libra setting as Auriga and Capella rise, representing the
capital of the Oryx nome. Libra rises opposite Triangulum.
The Judgment
As previously mentioned, the Triangulum constellation is in its upper culmination when Sirius is
rising, probably giving origin to the Egyptian name of Sirius – spdt . Triangulum also sets opposite
Libra, and was known by the Greeks as Deltoton, named after their letter delta. The strings attached to
the pan of a weight scale form the exact shape of a triangle, reminiscent of the constellation.
Meanwhile, in its lower culmination, was the star, known in Arabian astronomical traditions as Al
Mizān, or the “scale-beam.” Therefore, as Libra was rising, the star Al Mizān, or the “scale-beam,” was



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
22
in its lower culmination, and in its upper culmination was Canis Major and the star Wezen, which
literally means “weight” in Arabic (chart 5).
CHART 5. Libra rising, as Triangulum sets, and Canis Major is in upper
culmination, as symbolic of the Judgment scene.
This alignment between Libra, Triangulum, Al Mizān, and Wezen provides a possible
interpretation for one of the most enigmatic scenes in ancient Egyptian art: the last judgment (fig. 2).
One version depicts a kneeling Anubis (Canis Major), adjusting the weight (Wezen) of the scales
(Libra). On one side of the scale is the feather of Truth being weighed against the heart of the
deceased. The cynocephale, or dog-faced baboon of Thoth, sits atop the scales, possibly symbolic of
Hercules, which rises with Libra and was known as the Kneeler, Engonasin. The Daressy Zodiac (fig. 1)
represents the baboon under the sign of Capricorn, perhaps since Hercules sets with Capricorn.
Babylonian star lists call the constellation of Hercules, MULUR.KU, the “sitting dog.”

Orion and Scorpius
The nome of Ꜥnḏti (Andjety) corresponded to the time at which Orion was setting, or “dying” in the
western horizon, and Scorpius was rising (chart 6). This remarkable evidence indicates that Andjety
represented Orion in the list of emblem constellations. He was a precursor of the god Osiris, wsir ,
who wielded the same crook and flail that would later become Osirian insignias (Hart, 2005). Osiris
was known as sꜢḥ (K Locher, 1991), and was represented as such in the lists of star decans.
He was identified as Orion in the Pyramid Texts: “Look! He comes as Orion, Osiris, who has returned
as Orion...” (PT 819/20) (Faulkner, 1985). According to Plutarch, the goddess Isis buried her brother,
Osiris, in Busiris, the capital of the nome Ꜥnḏti, enshrining it as an important pilgrimage center.
The Upper Egyptian nome of Abydos, one of the most important religious centers of ancient
Egypt, aligns with the Lower Egyptian nome of Andjety, when Scorpius was rising. According to
Plutarch, the great mystery festival that celebrated the death of Osiris occurred in Abydos “when the
sun passes through Scorpion” (Plutarch, 1936). The Egyptian association between the scorpion and
Scorpius was first proposed by Wells (Wells, 1985). The link between Orion and Scorpius is further
demonstrated by one of the titles of Osiris, which was “He who dwells in the house of srḳt
(the scorpion goddess)” (Hart, 2005). This confirms that Scorpius was not only a Graeco-Babylonian
but also an Egyptian constellation, known in hieratic as ḏꜢr .

CHART 6. Orion “dying” as Scorpius rises, representing the nome of
Andjety .
Centaurus, Sagittarius, Sagitta, and the False Cross
The nome of tꜢ-sti , the “land of the bow,” near the border with Nubia, corresponds to the time at
which Sagittarius, the archer, was setting, and Orion was rising. It could refer to the stars in Sagittarius,
which were known as the bow, القوس , in Arabic. A Babylonian tale recounts how Marduk’s bow was
made into a constellation: “The third name, ‘Bow Star,’ he made visible in heaven; he established its
position with respect to the gods his brethren.” The MUL.APIN Babylonian star lists preserve the
name of a bow constellation as BAN, identified with Canis Major. The Babylonians also had an arrow
constellation called
MUL
KAK.SI.SÁ, identified with Canis Minor, which sets opposite Sagitta, the arrow.
The 4th and 5th nomes of Lower Egypt were represented by crossed arrows over a shield, nrt , and
correspond exactly to the rising of Sagitta, the arrow, which sets opposite Canis Major. Sagitta also
sets opposite the False Cross asterism, which has a star called Aspidiske, Greek for “shield,” the Latin
Scutulum perhaps emblematic of the shield of nrt.

In Mesopotamia, Orion was the True Shepherd of Heaven, SIPA.ZI.AN.NA (Rogers, 1998a). The
constellation of Centaurus rises in accordance with the 13th nome of Lower Egypt, ḥḳꜢ-Ꜥnḏw . The
constellation matches the shape of the shepherd’s crook, Ꜥnḏw, (fig. 3a) that Andjety and Osiris
wielded (fig. 3b) and which represented the name of the 13th nome.
Delphinus
The 22nd nome of Upper Egypt was the knife mdnı͗t. Delphinus, a small but peculiar
constellation, sets opposite the star of Denebola in Leo (chart 7). Based on its shape and position on
the nome list, there is little doubt that it represented the knife from the mdnı͗t nome (fig. 4a).
Confirming this is a New Kingdom apotropaic wand that depicts an early prototype of the zodiac signs
(Serres, 2010) that predates a presumed Ptolemaic-era influence on Egyptian zodiacs. It portrays a
knife instead of the lion for Leo (fig. 4b). The Babylonians also had a knife constellation, called
MULGÀM , the scimitar or crook, associated with Capella, which rises when Delphinus, the
knife, is in its upper culmination.

Capricorn & Aries
A portion of the Greek celestial iconography and zodiac was heavily influenced by the Mesopotamian
culture as evidenced by kudurru boundary stones and cylinder seals (fig. 5 a, b, c) (Schaeffer, 2006).
The “Water-Goat,” called MULSUHUR.MÁSH by the Babylonians, was the emblem of the
Sumerian water-god Ea and would become the symbol of the zodiacal sign of Capricorn (fig. 5c).
However, the fish-goat may also have Egyptian origins, first appearing on coffin lids in the Middle

Kingdom, around 2000 BC. The Egyptians divided the night-sky into 36 decans, the earliest system for
organizing the stars, each with a presiding deity (Neugebauer, 1951). Other cultures later adopted
similar night divisions, although based on lunar mansions, such as the Hindu Nakshatras, the Arabic
Manzil, and the Chinese Hsiu (Weinstock, 1949). The constellation of Piscis Austrinus, the Southern
fish, sets with Capricorn. The Egyptian decans listed stars near or that rise with Piscis Austrinus called
ẖry ḫpd srt , or “Under the tail of the goat,” which uses the hieroglyph ḫpd depicting
a fish’s tail and the hieroglyph srt representing a goat (Conman, 2006-2009) (K. Locher, 1981)
(Belmonte, 2001). Perhaps, this decan can elucidate the origins of the strange fish-tailed goat image of
Capricorn.

bow. b. Babylonian seal depicting winged centaur with scorpion tail. c.

Aquarius and Crater
On some occasions the emblems match Greek zodiacal imagery in quite surprising ways, as can be
seen with ı͗mt-ḫnt of the 18th Nome of Lower Egypt, which means “Southern Prince.” The
emblem depicts the royal child with water jars ḫnt, and it corresponds exactly to the time at which
Aquarius, the water-bearer, was setting. It also aligns with the “Feast of Anket: welcoming the rising of
the Nile” on I Akhet 7 (July 25), who is depicted in the Denderah circular zodiac holding two ḫnt water
jars (fig. 6a) similar to the depiction of Hapy as Aquarius in the Denderah rectangular zodiac (fig. 6b).
That the Egyptians had a vase asterism may be evidenced by a depiction in Ramses VI’s tomb (fig. 6c).
The Babylonian MUL.APIN lists Aquarius as MULGU.LA, , the “Great One,” likely a reference to

the Sumerian water god, Ea, patron deity of the world’s oldest city, Eridu, who is often represented
sitting on a throne pouring water from a vase (fig. 6d).

The capital of ı͗mt-ḫnt, Per-Bast (Gr Bubastis) was named after the cat goddess, Bastet, perhaps
in reference to the fact that Leo rises when Aquarius sets (chart 8). The 20th nome of Upper Egypt,
nꜤrt-ḫntt , Southern Sycamore, also composed of the water jar hieroglyphs, corresponded to the
time at which Aquarius was rising (table 1). The 14th nome of Lower Egypt, ḫntı͗-ı͗Ꜣbtı͗ ,
represented by the water jar hieroglyph, is emblematic of the rising of Crater, the water-bowl
constellation, that sets opposite Aquarius. Plutarch records of the Egyptians that, “in their holy rites,
the water jar in honor of the god heads the procession.”

CHART 8. Aquarius setting as Leo rises, representing the nome of ı͗mt
ḫnt and its capital Bubastis.
The Great Square of Pegasus
Rising near Aquarius is the Great Square of Pegasus, which was represented by the “White Wall” nome,
ı͗nbw-ḥḏ (table 1), one of the clearest correspondences between the nomes and the constellations.
The Egyptians must have pictured the Great Square of Pegasus as the enclosure wall of a celestial
temple. The capital of the “White Wall” was Memphis, near the Great Pyramid of Giza, the largest
monument of the ancient world. The Chinese knew some of the stars in Aquarius as Tien Luy Ching or
the “Heavenly Walled Castle.” They also called one of the stars in Pegasus Peih, or “Wall.” The
Babylonians knew the square of Pegasus as MULAŠ.IKU, or “the field,” and it was one of their most
important constellations.
Pisces and the Lyre
On the date of I Akhet 22 (August 9), the Egyptian calendar of lucky and unlucky days advise not to
eat fish, since on this date, the gods take on the form of a fish (Maystre, 1941) (Lichtheim, 1976).
Reconstructing the night sky for this date during the New Kingdom (1224 BC), we find that the sun sets
opposite Pisces and Piscis Austrinus. The 16th nome of Upper Egypt, ḥꜢt-mḥı͗t was represented by



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
30
a fish, and was the cult center of the fish goddess Hatmehit. It corresponds to the time at which Pisces
was setting along with the Lyre constellation (chart 9), which has a strong resemblance to a small fish.
The Lyre itself, envisioned by the Greeks as the harp of Orpheus, may have been represented by the
Sistrum nome , a musical instrument sacred to Isis and the goddess bꜢt.
CHART 9. Pisces and the Lyre setting, representing the 16th nome of
Upper Egypt .
The capital of the 19th nome, wꜢbwy , which corresponded to the rising of Pisces (table 1),
was called Oxyrhynchus by the Greeks, so named after the Mormyrus fish that was worshipped by the
local city’s priests. The Upper Egyptian nome of nḫn (Nekhen) is symbolized by the hieroglyph of a
circle with two feathers. It aligns with the rising of the circlet of Pisces (table 1) and matches the
circular shape of the constellation. The capital of Nekhen was called Latopolis by the Greeks, named
after the Nile perch, Lates niloticus, a fish sacred to the goddess Neith, who was venerated at the city.
Thus, two very important Egyptian cities, Oxyrhynchus and Latopolis, were both named by the Greeks
after sacred Nile fish, and both corresponded to the rising of Pisces. It appears that Ptolemaic Greeks
may have been aware of the celestial correspondences of the capitals of Egypt, and named these cities
accordingly.

The Knot of Pisces and Corona Borealis
The Denderah zodiac depicts two sacred Nile Carps tied to a cord, representing the Knot of Pisces.
The Egyptian month of mnḫt shares an etymology with the word mnḫt , which means
“clothing,” or “fabric.” In fact, during this month (II Akhet 5), which would have corresponded to the
time at which the sun was in Virgo, rising opposite the knot of Pisces (chart 10), the Egyptians
celebrated a festival of offering to Hedj-Hotep, the goddess of weaving. Another goddess of weaving,
Tayet, was worshipped at the town of Buto in the 5th nome of Lower Egypt, where her name was also
an alternate spelling for the town. This nome corresponds to the time at which the Knot of Pisces was
in its lower culmination. One variation of the emblem of the 11th nome of Upper Egypt , which
corresponded to the rising of Virgo, represents the twisted flax hieroglyph symbolic of the knot of
Pisces. It also represented the Crown of Lower Egypt , which may have been symbolic of the rising
of Corona Borealis.
CHART 10. The Knot of Pisces sets opposite Spica and Virgo, as
celebrated during the festival for the weaving goddess Hedj-Hotep.

Aries
According to Daressy, Thebes corresponded to the sign of Aries, the ram (Daressy, 1916). The priests of
Thebes, the capital of Egypt during most of the New Kingdom, worshipped the ram-headed god ı͗mn
. Daressy was partially correct about the link between Thebes and Aries. Based on the
sequence of nomes and the corresponding constellations, the powerful capital corresponded to the
goat-fish of Capricorn when Aries was in its lower culmination (chart 11).
CHART 11. Capricorn rising as Aries and Cassiopeia are in their lower
culmination, representing the Theban nome.
Perseus
The 13th nome of Upper Egypt, , is represented by the hieroglyph of the horned viper of Hydra,
the water jars of Aquarius, and the tree (chart 12). The brightest stars in the Perseus constellation
resemble the shape of a tree, possibly the sacred Persea tree, ı͗šd (fig. 7a), which Ra, in his cat
form, protected from the serpent Apophis. Setting with Aquarius was the knife of Delphinus, which
symbolizes the knife Ra uses to behead Apophis (fig. 7b). The Babylonian protective lion demon,
Ugallu, was often depicted wielding a dagger (fig. 7c).

CHART 12. Perseus in its upper culmination while Hydra and the star
Alphard rise, and Aquarius sets, representing nḏft-ḫntt .
The nome mnw , named after the god Min, also means “tree” in ancient Egyptian. This
was the district where the city of Panopolis was located and where the Greek hero Perseus was
worshipped. According to Plutarch, Osiris’ tomb “lies in the encompassing shade of a persea tree.” The
name “persea” is an ancient Greek name for an unidentified Egyptian tree (Quattrocchi, 2000).
Goddesses such as Isis and Hathor were called by the epithet “Lady of the Sycamore,” perhaps since
Virgo sets opposite Perseus.

Auriga
The Oryx nome, mꜢ-ḥḏ , aligns with the rising of Auriga’s Al Anz, known as the “he-goat” to the
Arabs, and Capella, whose name is Latin for “she-goat” (R. H. Allen, 1963). The charioteer of Auriga
was often represented holding a small goat, perhaps because he would rise opposite the shepherd,
Boötes. The Babylonian Goat-Star MULUZA has been identified with Vega, which rises opposite Capella.
Taurus & Corona Australis
Early pastoralists probably domesticated the cow in Southern Egypt as far back as 9,000 years ago
(Hirst). They had specially prepared burials for cows, and left rock art depicting cattle dating to 5500
BC (Schild & Wendorf, 2003). During the Egyptian Old Kingdom, the Pyramid texts refer to a “Bull of
Heaven” and a “Bull of Light” which is the father of the Pharaoh. MULGU4.AN.NA or the “Bull of Heaven”
was the Babylonian name for Taurus. The 10th , 11th , and 12th nomes, all
depicted the bull in their emblems. They fall within the time at which Scorpio was rising and Taurus
was setting. Corroborating this is the fact that the Daressy zodiac represents the bull for the sign of
Scorpio (fig. 1), which confirms that the Egyptians also saw Taurus as a bull.
CHART 13. Taurus rising as Corona Australis sets, representing, the
“Mountain Bull” .



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
35
The “Mountain Bull” nome corresponds to the rising of Corona Australis, which sets
opposite the Hyades of Taurus (chart 13). Given the horn-like appearance of Corona Australis, the
Egyptian may have seen the constellations as the horns of the bull (fig. 8). Corona Australis may have
been represented in Seti I’s tomb (Eisler, 1941), indicating that the Egyptians recognized it as an
asterism. The Babylonian MUL.APIN star tablets make reference to the “Crown of Anu” in conjunction
with the Taurus constellation, the heavenly steer.
FIGURE 8. Outline of Corona Australis, possibly the horns of Taurus.
Canis Major
The identification of Sirius and Canis Major with dogs is found in disparate cultures all over the world.
To the Phoenicians, Sirius was Hannabeah, “the Barker.” In China, Sirius was known as Lang Hsing, or
“Wolf Star,” and Tseen Lang, “Heavenly Wolf.” The Chinese asterism of the Celestial Wolf 天狼 was
part of Canis Major, while in the opposing Sagittarius the Chinese had the Dog 狗 and Dog Territory
狗國 asterisms. The Alaskan Inuits envisioned Canis Major as a “Moon Dog.” To them Sirius was
known as the “Red and White Fox,” both trying to go down the same hole. The Seri of the Southwest,
the Osage, and the Cherokee Indians also saw the Canis Major constellation as a dog (Kelley & Milone,
2005).
Diodorus records how, in imitation of funerary rituals performed by the Egyptian priests of
Anubis, the ancient Greeks also wore dog masks, representing the hound of Hades, Cerberus, during
sacred funeral rites (Siculus, 1933-1967). The dog as psychopomp or guardian of the underworld
became a widespread symbol throughout the world: from Anubis, to the Greek Cerberus, the
Germanic hell-hound Garmr, the Vedic sons of Sarama, Odin’s two wolves, and Arawn and his hounds
(Menache, 1997).



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
36
The jackal nome of ı͗npwt , where Anubis was worshipped, corresponded to the time at
which Canis Major and Sirius were in their lower culmination or “the underworld,” and the star
Edasich of Draco, known as the “hyena,” يخ
ّ
الذ by early Arab astronomers (aṣ-Ṣūfī, 1874), was in its
upper culmination. Meanwhile, Lupus, known as UR.IDIM, the “mad dog,” by the Babylonians, was
setting along with the star Auva, اء
ّ
العو , the Arabic “the barker” (chart 14). This could indicate that like
the Greeks and Phoenicians, the Egyptians also saw Canis Major as a dog. The New Kingdom
apotropaic wand depicts a dog for the sign of Capricorn (fig. 2), perhaps because during that time,
Capricorn set while Canis Major rose.
CHART 14. Edasich Draconis, “the hyena,” in its upper culmination,
while Sirius is in its lower culmination and Lupus sets. Representing
the jackal nome of ı͗npwt . The star Auva “the barker” is setting.
Several festivals during the ancient Egyptian calendar confirm the association between the
dog-headed funeral deity, Anubis, and the constellation of Canis Major, or “great dog.” The Cairo
Calendar documents for the day of II Akhet 4 (August 21) show it as the “day of the going forth of
Anubis for the inspection of this wꜤbt for the protection of the body of the god” (Bakir, 1966). This date
corresponds precisely to the time at which Canis Major was in its lower culmination during sunset.
On IV Peret 2 (February 15), “The Majesty of Geb proceeds to the throne of Busiris to see Anubis, who
commands the council on the requirements (of the day)” (Bakir, 1966). This event corresponds to the



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
37
time at which Canis Major was in its lower culmination at sunrise (chart 14). The festival of IV Shemu
22 (July 5), “Feast of Anubis who is on his mountain” (Bakir, 1966), marks the nearly heliacal rising of
Sirius and Canis Major. The “Going Forth of Anubis” on III Peret 6 (January 20) during the time of
Aquarius, corresponds to the time at which Canis Major rose as the water-bearer set.
The Egyptian word for “jackal,” sꜢb , is nearly identical to the Egyptian word for “star,”
sbꜢ , perhaps because Sirius, the dog-star, is the brightest star in the night sky. The Pyramid
Texts of Unas refer to a “Jackal” star, “your nose as the Jackal — an Imperishable (circumpolar) Star,”
which could be Edasich, the “hyena,” or Thuban, a Draconis, which was known as Al-dhi’b الذئب , to
Arab astronomers, meaning “the wolf.” Thuban or Edasich could have been represented in the
Denderah circular zodiac by the circumpolar wolf figure on a hoe. In Babylon, there was also a
circumpolar “fox” star called
MUL
KA
5
.A .
On the Denderah zodiac, between other circumpolar constellations, the figure of the jackal
appears to be on top of a hoe (fig. 9). Whenever the herald of the New Year, Sirius, rose in the sky,
Triangulum was in its upper culmination. In fact, the Babylonian name for a Trianguli was
mul
UR.BAR.RA, the “Wolf, seeder of the plough” (Hunger & Pingree, 1989) since Triangulum was seen
as a plough by the Babylonians. The Jackal is also touching the beak of an upside down falcon,
probably representing the setting of Aquila as Sirius rises.
FIGURE 9. Jackal on a hoe, representing Sirius rising as Triangulum, is

Gemini
Gemini was known as

Gods,” represented the constellation of Gemini, the twins. This nome represented the time at which
the eagle, Aquila, rose in the East, and the stars Castor and Pollux of Gemini set in the West, providing
one of the clearest pieces of evidence that the nomes corresponded to specific constellations
(chart 15).
CHART 15. Aquila rising as Gemini sets, representing the nome of the

Lepus
Even the relatively minor Greek constellation Lepus, the rabbit that Orion hunts, has a parallel in the
Egyptian nome wnt . The patron god of Unet was the ibis-headed lunar deity Thoth. There is no
mention of a “rabbit constellation” in a dynastic text or monument, however the constellation may
have been represented by Unet, the rabbit goddess herself.
Cancer
While not represented in the Nomes, Ptolemaic-era zodiacs depict the sign of cancer, the crab, the
Babylonian MULAL.LUL, as the scarab beetle, an insect which the Egyptians saw as metaphoric of their
sun god, Ra, as it rolled its dung ball across the ground like a celestial sphere. The insect, a perennial
inhabitant of the desert tombs of Egypt, represented the solar god ḫprı͗ . His major cult center was in



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
39
Heliopolis, capital of the 13th Lower Egyptian nome ḥḳꜢ-Ꜥnḏw , which corresponded to the time at
which Libra was rising, and Cancer was in its upper culmination (chart 16).

II. The Circumpolar Stars
Ursa Minor
Clagett wrote that the identification of the Northern constellations present in the ancient Egyptian
celestial diagrams was “extremely difficult if not impossible” (Clagett, 1995). Ancient Egyptian
astronomical ceilings that depicted the circumpolar constellations often pictured a female
hippopotamus figure with a crocodile tail, occasionally named Ꜣst-ḏꜢmt, Isis-Djamet. She is probably a
representation of the nursing goddess, Taweret that also has a crocodile tail, and stands on her
two feet (Lull & Belmonte, 2006). Locher tried to associate Taweret with the stars of Draco (K Locher,
2001), drawing the figure of the deity by combining various constellations, including Draco. However,
the evidence indicates that the hippopotamus was associated with Ursa Major or Ursa Minor. Early
Greeks or Minoans, through a diffusion of the cult of Taweret, may have interpreted the bipedal



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
40
hippopotamus figure of Taweret as a regional bear, an animal that, unlike the African hippopotamus,
actually stands on its hind legs (fig. 10). It has been argued that Ursa Major as a bear may have Ice Age
origins (Julien, 2012) to account for the wide dispersal of the myth.
FIGURE 10. a. Ursa Major as the bear, Akkadian dabû. b. The goddess
Taweret. c. The hippopotamus, Egyptian dı͗b, as Ursa Minor.
In Greek tradition, the earliest mention of the bear constellation comes from Homer, circa
eighth century BC. The Egyptian word for “hippopotamus,” dı͗b , is the probable origin for
the Akkadian dabû (Cohen, 1947) (Civil, 1998), Hebrew dōbh, Arabic dubb, and Ethiopian dĕb(b)
meaning “bear” (Botterweck & Ringgren, 1979) from which the Arabs named the brightest star of Ursa
Major, Dubhe or “she bear.” These terms for “bear” could also be related to the Egyptian word for
crocodile, dpy (by interchanging the plosives “p” and “b”).
Lull and Belmonte claimed that Taweret (in her form as Ipet) was the same as the
hippopotamus figure present in Ramesside star charts, called rrt, which means “sow” in ancient
Egyptian. The Egyptians incorrectly classified the taxonomy of the hippopotamus as being part of the
pig family. While the bear constellation does not appear to have Mesopotamian origins since Ursa
Major (and perhaps Ursa Minor) was originally known to them as the wagon, MULMAR.GÍD.DA (G. A.
Davis, 1946), the Babylonians had a circumpolar star or constellation, which has not been definitively
identified, called mulŠAH, “the pig,” perhaps etymologically related to the Egyptian šꜢ , “pig”
(PIE sū̆meaning “sow”).
Ursa Major was a she-bear to the Greeks, the nymph Callisto (Καλλιστώ), who resembles
Taweret, a female hippopotamus with nursing attributes. Taweret was seen as a protectress of
childbirth and pregnancies, due to the female hippopotamus’s behavior defending her young. Her



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
41
epithets included “Lady of Heaven” and “Mistress of the Horizon.” Taweret did not have any major
cult centers, since she was worshipped as a household goddess, but another hippopotamus goddess,
ı͗py (Ipet), with iconography similar to Taweret, was worshipped at Thebes. Given the Egyptian
taxonomical classification of hippopotamuses as pigs, it is conceivable that Ipet’s name may be
related to another Egyptian word for pig, ı͗pḥ . Ipet was worshipped at a temple in Karnak (ı͗pt
swt), dedicated to the “Great Ipet." The Theban nome corresponded to the time at which Capricorn
was rising, and Polaris, of Ursa Minor, was in its lower culmination. In its upper culmination was Virgo,
perhaps explaining the nursing, motherly qualities of the deity. More than Ursa Major, the
hippopotamus matches the shape of the constellation of Ursa Minor, with its distinctive curvature
following the “pregnant” belly of the mythological figure (fig. 10c).
Around 1800 BC, the cult of Taweret spread to the Levant region and then to Minoan Greece
(Weingarten, 1991). The association between the female bear and Ursa Major probably also spread to
the distant corners of the world (Gibbon, 1964) (Berezkin, 2005). Given the predynastic origins of
Taweret, her astronomical associations, the philological origins for the word “bear,” and the diffusion
of the cult of Taweret, it is reasonable to assume that the bear constellation originated in ancient
Egypt, as the female hippopotamus.
Ursa Major
In astronomical ceilings, the crocodile is often called ḥḳw n sꜤḳ, “The Plunderer,” and has been linked
with a variety of constellations by Egyptologists. While Ursa Minor may have been the hippopotamus
in ancient Egypt, Ursa Major may have been pictured as the crocodile, also a circumpolar
constellation, that often accompanies Taweret. The long tail of Ursa Major resembles a crocodile more
than a bear or a hippopotamus (fig. 11). Taweret also had crocodilian attributes, which may have
added to the confusion between Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. The Sumerian dimšah, meaning
“hippopotamus,” may exist as the Arabic timsah, meaning “crocodile,” with an Egyptian origin in their
word for crocodile, msḥ (Civil, 1998), compounding the scribal confusion between the two
circumpolar aquatic creatures. Unconvincingly, to justify the long tail of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor,
which is uncharacteristic of bears, the Greeks claimed that when Zeus threw Callisto and her son,
Arcas, to the heavens, their tails stretched.

FIGURE 11. Ursa Major as the crocodile.
The sixth nome of Upper Egypt, ı͗ḳr , whose emblem was a crocodile, corresponds to the
time at which the star Alkaid of Ursa Major, the last star on the tail of the crocodile, was in its upper
culmination. The “Birth of Sobek,” the crocodile god sbk , on II Peret 11 (December 28)
corresponded to the time at which the sun was in Capricorn, and as it set, Alkaid was in its lower
culmination. The star Muscida, Latin for “muzzle,” could represent the crocodile's snout and in fact,
the heliacal rising of the star Muscida may have been celebrated during the festival of the “Day of the
cutting out of the tongue of Sobek (the crocodile god)” on the I Shemu 14 (March 29) (chart 17). The
same festival happened on II Akhet 22 (September 8), and it marked the rising of Muscida, “the
tongue of Sobek,” with Pisces during sunset. In fact, the Daressy zodiac represents the crocodile
within the sign of Pisces. The shape of the constellation, the position of the crocodile nome, Ptolemaic
era portrayals, and festivals celebrating Sobek, all indicate that Ursa Major was seen as the crocodile
in ancient Egypt.

CHART 17. Ursa Major and Muscida “the muzzle” rise with Pisces,

Boötes
In the past, Ursa Major was identified with the foreleg constellation Meskhetyu (Renouf, 1874)
(Pogo, 1930) (Clagett, 1995), supported by an interpretation of the Great Magical Papyrus of Paris that
states that the “bear” was a foreleg (Neugebauer & Parker, 1960). Despite this, there is another
possibility. The foreleg could be the constellation of Boötes since it corresponds to the second nome
of Lower Egypt, ḫpš , when the star Arcturus was in its upper culmination and Capricorn was
rising. Confirming that this nome represented Capricorn, was a festival during the sign of the goat-fish,
on the II Peret 13 (December 28), called “Day of Sekhmet going forth to Letopolis (the capital of the
ḫpš nome).” Sekhmet was a lion-headed goddess whose festival may have represented Leo rising
opposite Capricorn.
A Late Period festival, during III Shemu, when the sun was in Gemini, was marked by
throwing a bull’s leg into the sky (Alliot, 1949-1954) as part of the marriage of Hathor and Horus at
Edfu (second nome of Upper Egypt). At sunrise, when the sun was in Gemini, Boötes would be setting.
During sunset, Arcturus and Boötes would be in their upper culmination as seen in chart 16. The fact
that Boötes (in particular the star Seginus) sets, while Orion rises, explains the association between



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
44
Osiris and Meskhetyu present in the Kom Abu Yasin bull coffin. This association has puzzled
researchers who believe that Meskhetyu corresponds to Ursa Major (Lull, 2006). The first cataract of
the Nile at Elephantine, in the first nome of Upper Egypt, corresponded to Gemini, and in the late
period it was believed that the Nile surged forth from the lower leg of Osiris, the holy relic preserved
there (Kees, 1961).
This new interpretation of Meskhetyu is evidenced by observation with the naked eye on a
clear night. The stars form the undeniable and perfect shape of an animal foreleg, including the kinks
of the leg, with the hoof composed of Muphrid, u Bootis and t Bootis (fig. 12). Ancient Egyptian
depictions of Meskhetyu match the constellation, even more precisely than the Chariot of Ursa Major.
Meskhetyu was originally pictured as an adze that supposedly resembles Ursa Major, however, the
ancient Egyptian adze, with its peculiar shape, is also a better match with Boötes. The adze was used
in the Opening of the Mouth ceremony, where it magically allowed the mummy to speak and breathe.
FIGURE 12. Boötes redrawn with Meskhetyu overlaid.
Meskhetyu was also associated with the foreleg of the god Seth. The Papyrus Jumilhac of the
Ptolemaic period states that the foreleg of Seth is thrown into the heavens where it is guarded by the
great hippopotamus goddess (Vandier, 1962). The 11th nome of Upper Egypt, šꜢ , was represented
by the animal of Seth (perhaps a donkey). It corresponded to the time at which the three horse
related constellations were aligned. Muphrid rose in the East, while Scheat and Pegasus, the flying
horse, were setting, and Sagittarius, the centaur, was in its lower culmination (chart 18). Scheat was
known to early Arab astronomers as the “horse’s shoulder.” The Daressy zodiac represented Leo as the
Donkey, perhaps since Pegasus set while Leo rose. Leo also rose opposite the small constellation



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
45
Equuleus, “the horse”, which incidentally rises opposite Cancer and the stars Asellus Australis and
Asellus Borealis, the donkeys Dionysus and Hephaestus rode against the Titans.
CHART 18. Boötes “the foreleg” rising, Pegasus, the winged horse,
setting, Sagittarius, the centaur, in its lower culmination, representing
the 11th nome of Upper Egypt, .
A Great Alignment
The foreleg of the Egyptian god Seth was tethered to a mooring post by the hippopotamus goddess
Taweret, which is reminiscent of the Babylonian epic of creation, in which Marduk fashioned earth
and heaven by dividing the body of Tiamat. He used her thigh to prop up the two realms, and, to keep
them together, he bound them with a rope made from her tail. In the epic of Gilgamesh, one of the
heroes tears off one of the legs of the heavenly bull of Taurus, and throws it to Ishtar who wails over it.
On some occasions, Meskhetyu is represented as a bull’s head, attached to the foreleg. Arcturus sets
opposite Taurus, which further confirms Boötes as the foreleg. In fact, Boötes, the Babylonian,
mulŠU.PA, was identified with the god Enlil, who was sometimes depicted with the hind legs and horns
of the bull god.

FIGURE 13. Denderah rectangular zodiac detail with astronomical
identifications. (Photo by author)
A detail of the frieze in the great Hipostyle Hall of Denderah depicts a falcon god spearing
Meskhetyu, who is tied to a rope by Taweret (fig. 13). An astronomical interpretation of this depiction
supports the claim that Boötes was Meskhetyu, Ursa Minor was the hippopotamus, and Ursa Major
was the crocodile. A re-creation of the night sky from the period at which the temple was first built,
during the Middle Kingdom (Kipfer, 2000), reveals a magnificent alignment between the circumpolar
stars. Both Alkaid of Ursa Major (the crocodile) and Muphrid of Boötes (the hoof of the foreleg) were
aligned on the meridian. In its lower culmination was Polaris, the tail of the hippopotamus of Ursa
Minor. Meanwhile, rising on the East was Sagitta, the arrow, with Aquila, the eagle. In the rectangular
zodiac, this scene was placed next to Sagittarius, exactly when Aquila and Sagitta were rising (chart
19).



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)

CHART 19. Aquila, Sagitta are rising, Polaris and Pisces are in their
lower culmination, and Alkaid and Muphrid are in their upper
culmination, as depicted in the rectangular zodiac of Denderah (fig.
13). Arcturus is at 18°N, the orientation of the Denderah temple.
While Alkaid, Muphrid, and Polaris were aligned on the meridian, the Knot of Pisces, the
Arabic Alrischa “the cord,” was in its lower culmination, which could symbolize the cord (or “golden
chain”) tied to the foreleg on the Denderah zodiac (fig. 13). As discussed by Spence (Spence, 2000), two
circumpolar stars such Polaris and Alkaid could have been used to pinpoint the North Celestial Pole
by sighting a line between them. Around 2100 BC, at the beginning of the powerful Eleventh Dynasty,
Polaris, Alkaid, and t Bootis (the tip of the hoof) were in perfect alignment on the meridian.
Draco
Identifying Böotes as the foreleg constellation permits a reinterpretation of the circumpolar
constellation Draco, the serpent. Taweret, which the present analysis has already identified as Ursa
Minor (or perhaps Ursa Major), was often pictured alongside her serpent consort Apophis. The tenth
nome of Upper Egypt, wꜢḏyt , the rearing cobra, corresponded to the constellation Draco, when the
star Eltanin of the head of the serpent dipped below the horizon and was in its lower culmination,
while the star Unukalhai, from the constellation Serpens, rose in the east. Meanwhile, the head of



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
48
Hydra, the water serpent, was in its upper culmination (chart 20). This nome represented the perfect
alignment between the three serpent constellations of the celestial sphere.
CHART 20. Eltanin Draconis sets and is in its lower culmination, as
Unukalhai Serpentis rises, and the head of Hydra is in its upper
culmination, representing the wꜢḏyt nome.
Although the serpent is not depicted alongside other circumpolar constellations in
astronomical ceilings, perhaps for magical reasons, possible depictions of the stellar serpent can be
found in the Amduat, as evidenced in Seti I’s tomb, from the eighteenth dynasty, as the protective
serpent, Mehen, showing an outline similar to the constellation of Draco (fig. 14). As a circumpolar
“imperishable” constellation, Draco, symbolized by the Ureaus serpent, was representative of royal
power and protection since the constellation “defeated” the horizon every night.



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)

FIGURE 14. Detail of Seti I’s tomb.
Draco was an important constellation because its star, Thuban, marked the Celestial North
Pole for many centuries during the peak of the ancient Egyptian civilization. Confirming the
association of the wꜢḏyt nome and Draco is the festival of “The Birth of Apophis,” the serpent of chaos
feared by the Egyptians. The festival was celebrated on III Peret 22 (February 5), during the time of
Aquarius. Until about 2800 BC, as the water-bearer was rising, Thuban was in its lower culmination;
and while Aquarius was setting, Thuban was in its upper culmination.
III. The Celestial Boat
The Pyramid Texts of Unas, from circa 2300 BC, record the earliest spells from the Old Kingdom.
Inscribed on the walls of his pyramid, they describe the Pharaoh’s ascension to the stars after his
death on a solar barque:
Become clean: occupy your seat in the Sun’s boat and row the above and elevate those
who are far off. You should row with the Imperishable Stars, sail with the unwearying
ones, and receive the Nightboat’s cargo. (J. P. Allen & Der Manuelian, 2005)
The boat was so sacred in the ancient world that, throughout different cultures, it represented a
constellation in the starry heavens. The ancient Greeks associated a Southern constellation with a
boat, called the Argo Navis, named after the story of Jason and the Argonauts (Apollonius & Seaton,
1912). The Babylonians also had a boat constellation called MA.GUR and they had a celebration called
the “Festival of the Boat of An.” The Chinese had a “Celestial Boat” called Tianchuan 天船, which was
associated with the Perseus constellation. Early Arab astronomers called one of the stars in the



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
50
Southern Phoenix Nair al-Zaurak, meaning the “bright one of the boat,” since they saw that asterism
as a dhow, or small boat (R. H. Allen, 1963).
Unlike the Greeks who saw their gods traveling on chariots across the sky, the Egyptian
pantheon sailed the heavens on boats. Senmut’s New Kingdom astronomical ceiling also depicts a
boat constellation surrounded by stars. Plutarch wrote in “De Iside et Osiride”:
Thus they say that Osiris was a general, that Canopus, from whom the star took its
name, was a pilot, and that the ship which the Greeks call Argo, being made in
imitation of the ship of Osiris, was, in honour of him, turned into a constellation and
placed near Orion and the Dog-star, the former being sacred to Horus and the latter to
Isis (Budge, 1912).
According to Plutarch, the Egyptian constellation of the ship of Osiris inspired the Greek Argo Navis.
The Egyptians themselves must also have had a boat constellation, though from the emblems of the
nomes it is not immediately clear whether this constellation was the same as the Greek Argo Navis.
One festival during the month of II Akhet, when the sun was in Virgo, celebrated the “fixing the front
piece of the prow on the Sacred Boat.” This celebration could be a result of Virgo rising together with
Canopus, the brightest star of Argo Navis.

CHART 21. Sagittarius sets with the “hoof” of Boötes, while Argo Navis is
in its lower culmination as represented by the boat under the feet of
Sagittarius in the Denderah zodiac (fig. 5a).
The Ptolemaic-era zodiac, in the temple of Denderah, shows a small boat below the feet of
Sagittarius (fig. 5a). It must correspond to the time at which Sagittarius was setting alongside the “hoof”
of Boötes. Meanwhile, the constellation of Argo Navis was in its lower culmination, metaphorically
under the feet of the horse (chart 21).



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
52
CHART 22. Altair rises opposite the star Naos, the “ship,” representing
nmty .
The 18th nome of Upper Egypt, nmty was named after the falcon god who is often shown
perching on a crescent-shaped barque . In the Coffin Texts, he supervises Sokar’s hnw
boat. The brightest star of Aquila, Altair, rises opposite the star Naos, which in Greek
means “ship” and which was part of the Argo Navis constellation (chart 22). One of the Egyptian
decans is called ḥr-ı͗b wiꜢ , “the one in the middle of the ship,” which Conman identified with
Altair (Conman, 2006-2009). Belmonte and Lull also proposed that the constellation ḏꜢt, “The
Ferryboat” was associated with the area of Argo Navis. With this, it is sufficiently clear that parts of the
Argo Navis were the celestial boat constellation from ancient Egypt, even if the Greeks did not
preserve its original shape.
Conclusion
Given the large number of sequential and precise matches, 38 in total, and their confirmation with
various calendrical festivals, it is seems more than reasonable to conclude that the nome emblems
represented the original ancient Egyptian constellations. Only 5 of the 42 nomes did not present a
clear astronomical identification. Also, only 10 out of the 48 classical constellations remain without



Alessandro Berio, “The Celestial River” Sino-Platonic Papers, 253 (December 2014)
53
probable Egyptian parallels. Thus, we can conclude that the Egyptian nightsky was one of the major
inspirations for the creation of the classical constellations recorded by Aratus and Ptolemy.
Of the classical zodiacal constellations, the study confirms with a high degree of certainty that
at least half of them already existed in early Egypt: the lion of Leo, the scales of Libra, the scorpion of
Scorpio, the water-bearer of Aquarius, the fish of Pisces, the bull of Taurus, and the twins of Gemini.
Less precise, but nonetheless conclusive, are the identifications of Virgo with the mother goddess and
Sagittarius with the bow. Festivals such as the those for the scorpion goddess and Osiris during the
month of Scorpio, the birth of Apophis, the serpent deity, when Thuban was in its culmination, or the
festivals for Anubis that coincide with the rising of Canis Major, serve to confirm the methodology of
the research.
Instead of recording the constellations in lists, like Ptolemy, or in poems, like Aratus, the
Egyptians etched their constellations onto the very map of Egypt. Each district was a constellation,
and the Nile River was an earthly manifestation of the Milky Way, a celestial river upon which the star
gods and the souls of the deceased sailed. Not only does the study show that the Egyptians had many
of the same classical constellations as the Greeks and Babylonians, but this new understanding can
provide an overarching framework for explaining the origins of the various cult centers throughout
Egypt, and also help us better understand the mysteries of the ancient Egyptian star cult. Perhaps now
a new meaning may be gleaned from the words ascribed to the Greek sage, Asclepius, in “The Perfect
Discourse” when he states that “Egypt is an image of heaven” (Fowden, 1986).
