# Index for Tom van Bakel – The meaning of arrows depicted on Indus stamps, according to the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 (Ritual rules for birth).pdf

The meaning of arrows depicted on Indus stamps,
according to the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25
(Ritual rules for birth)
Arrows are depicted on ANE cylinder seals as well as on Indus Valley stamps. Nevertheless, they have a different meaning: on ANE cylinders seals they mean ‘life’ and on Indus stamps they represent a male embryo that enters a womb. In this essay, the significance of some Indus signs will be studied step by step on the basis of The Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25, which describes the rituals for birth.
Number 1
On the left side of this imprint is one of the many arrows that are depicted on Mesopotamian and Indus Valley cylinder seals. In Sumer these arrows indicated a number of concepts:
In Sumer the word ‘Ti’ means ‘arrow’, ‘timber’, ’rib’ and it also means ‘life’.
http://www.volker-doormann.org/slavery.htm.
As you see, one of the meanings is: 'life'. Since the name of the goddess Nin-ti means 'she who makes life' a detached vertical arrow depicted on a cylinder seal may mean something like: 'who makes life'.
H-2144 A
A comparable arrow is depicted on this damaged Indus stamp. It has a different meaning as it stands in for an embryo which is being engendered, because according to the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19 a male embryo may enter a womb as an arrow the quiver:
6. Or, 'May a male embryo enter thy womb, as an arrow the quiver; may a man be
born here, a son after ten months.



H-2144 B
In the same sentence we read: ‘May a man be born here, a son after ten months’: on the other side of the stamp this ‘man’ is depicted as a simple human figure.
6. Or, 'May a male embryo enter thy womb, as an arrow the quiver; may a man be
born here, a son after ten months.
H-1687 A
The arrow sign can be linked to Krittika, a nakshatra symbolized by a knife or a spear:
3 Krittika, an old name of the Pleiades; personified as the nurses of Kārttikeya, a son of Shiva. Astrological Mate: Surya (Sun)
Symbol: Knife or spear
Rigvedic name: Agni, god of fire
Indian zodiac: 26°40′ Mesha – 10° Vrishabha Western zodiac: 22° 40′ Taurus – 6° Gemini
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra



H-525
According to the following list, Krittika is also symbolized by an axe, a razor, and by a blade:
3. Krittika — ‘The One Who Cuts’
Range: 26°40' Aries — 10°00' Taurus Symbol: axe, razor, blade, knife, flame, peacock Deity: Karttikeya, Agni (God of fire) Mode of Functioning: Active Caste: priestly or brahminical Gender: Female Body parts: hips, loins and the crown of the head Humor (Ayurvedic Constitution): Kapha Direction: the arc covering the directions from east, south-east to south Guna (Essence): Rajas Tattwa (Element): Earth Gana (Type): Rakshasa (demonic) Orientation: Downward Disposition: Mixed (alternates between sharp and soft) Ruling Planet: Sun Sounds: A, Ee, Oo, Ay Animal symbol: Sheep or Goat Primary Motivation: Kama Enemy: Vishakha
Published: en.vedicencyclopedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
It is clear that an arrow is related to these weapons and tools, so it is not unreasonable to link it to the nakshatra Krittika.



M-208 a
And thus we may assume that an arrow stands in for a male embryo entering a womb in Krittika (Pleiades). When a child is conceived in this nakshatra, it is not unusual that, after about ten months, he is born in Shatabhisha, a nakshatra in Aquarius.
25 Shatabhisha
‘Comprising a hundred physicians’ Sadachbia Astrological Mate: Rahu (North lunar node) Symbol: Empty circle, 1,000 flowers or stars
Rigvedic name: Varuna, god of celestial waters
Indian zodiac: 6° 40′ – 20° Kumbha Western zodiac: 2° 40′ – 16° Pisces
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
According to this table Varuna, the god of the celestial waters, is the Rigvedic name of this nakshatra and in the Indus Valley Civilization his symbol animals are a fish and a crocodile.
And thus the two signs on the stamp above suggest the conception of an embryo and the birth of a ‘son’, as described in Khanda 19:
o The arrow on the above stamp indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow
the quiver in Krittika. o This embryo is born as a man about ten months later in Shatabhisha, which has the
Rigvedic name ‘Varuna’.
o On the stamp this water god/nakshatra is symbolized by a fish.



h1985A
Varuna, the god of the Celestial Waters, is a male god and his masculinity is symbolized by the four fins that collectively suggest an X-sign, which is the Sumerian sign for 'man':
pap [RELATION] (86x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. pap 'first and foremost, pre-eminent; father; male, virile; brother' Akk. abu; ahu; ašarēdu; zikaru
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
As you see in ancient Sumer this X-sign had the following meanings: 'first and foremost, preeminent; father; male, virile; brother'.
So, a fish is the symbol animal for water in general, and when four fins are added to it than the combined sign symbolizes Varuna, the male god of the Celestial waters.
M-186 a
This means that the two signs on this stamp suggest the conception of an embryo and the birth of a child, as described in Khanda 19:
o The arrow on this stamp indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow the
quiver in Krittika in the first month. o In the tenth month, this embryo is born as a man in Shatabhisha/Varuna, a nakshatra
symbolized by a the four-finned-fish sign.



K-32 a
But Indus stamps also depicted fish with only two fins, and this type of fish represented Saraswati, who was originally a river goddess and later became the goddess of knowledge, music, art, speech, wisdom, and learning:
The Sarasvati River (IAST: Sárasvatī-nadī́) is a deified river first mentioned in the Rigveda[1] and later in Vedic and post-Vedic texts.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasvati_River
Saraswati (सरस्वती , IAST: Sarasvatī) is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, music, art, speech, wisdom, and learning.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati
M-978 A
Kanda 24 describes the ceremony for the new born child and in this Kanda Saraswati is described as goddess of speech and music although she not mentioned by name:
Khanda 24. 1. Now the Gâtakarman (i.e. ceremony for the new-born child). (-) 10. And let him recite over (the child the following text), 'Speech, the goddess, united with mind, together with breath, the child, uttered by Indra—may she rejoice in thee, the goddess, for the sake of joy, the great one, the sweet sounding, the music, full of music, the flowing, self-produced.'
Saraswati is thus mentioned in the birth ceremony, and literally the two signs suggest the following: the arrow denotes a male embryo entering the womb, like an arrow the quiver, and the fish suggests that the father reciting a text over the newborn child, in which the goddess of speech and music is invoked for the sake of joy.



M-185 a
The father recites the text in the tenth month when the sun conjunct to Sravana, a nakshatra in Aquila:
23; 20 Sravana (hearing or ear) Range: 10°00' — 23°20' Capricorn Symbol: ear, trident, row of three uneven footsteps Deity: Vishnu, Saraswati Mode of Functioning: Passive Cast: Mleccha Gender: Male Body parts: ears, genitals Humor (Ayur Vedic Constitution): Kapha Direction: south, northwest Guna (Essence): Rajas Tattwa (Element): air Gana (Type): Godly Orientation: Upward Disposition: Moveable Ruling Planet: Moon Sounds: Ju, Je, Jo, Gha Animal symbol: monkey Primary Motivation: Artha
Published: en.Vedicencyclopedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
Saraswati is the deity of this nakshatra, so when the sun conjunct to Sravana it is the right time to recite a text in which the goddess of speak and music is invoked for the sake of joy.
And thus:
o The arrow on the above stamp indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow
the quiver in Krittika, in the first month. o And the fish with only two fins suggests that a son is born in Sravana and the father,
for the sake of joy, recites a text that invokes the goddess of speech and music.
It is clear that the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra describes what actions should be done and what texts should be spoken before the conception of a son, during pregnancy up to ten days after birth. It appears that these activities have some relationship to some nakshatras.



H-148
On this imprint we see the arrow sign on the left and next to it are two fish. As mentioned, the four-finned-fish in the middle represents the water god Varuna. Along with Apas, he is also the deity of Purva Ashadha:
20. Purva Ashadha Range: 13°20' — 26°40' Sagittarius Symbol: hand held fan Deity: Apas, Varuna Mode of Functioning: Balanced Caste: Brahmin Gender: Female Body parts: Thighs and Back (from neck to waist) Humor (Ayurvedic Constitution): Pitta Direction: northeast to southeast, via east Guna (Essence): Rajas Tattwa (Element): Air Gana (Type): Manusha (human) Orientation: Downward Disposition: Ugra (fierce and severe) Ruling Planet: Venus Sounds: Bu, Dah, Bha, Dha Animal symbol: Monkey Primary Motivation: Moksha Enemy: Pushya
Published: en.vedicencyclopedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
In the seventh month, the sun passes through Purva Ashadha. When this happens, the pregnant woman's hair is parted and she takes a bath and puts on a new garment:
Khanda 22. 1. In the seventh month, at her first pregnancy, the Sîmantonnayana (or parting of the hair). 2. He causes her, after she has bathed and put on a (new) garment which has not yet been washed, to sit down behind the fire. 3. He sacrifices, while she takes hold of him, with the Mahâvyâhritis. 4. He cooks a mess of food,
And thus, the three signs suggest three activities from conception and birth of a son:
o The arrow on the above stamp indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow
the quiver in Krittika (first month). o The pregnant woman takes a bath in the seventh month, when the sun passes through
Purva Ashadha, a nakshatra of the water god Varuna (four-finned-fish). o About nine months later this male embryo is born as a son in Sravana. The goddess of
this nakshatra is Saraswati who is represented by a two-finned-fish with a ‘hat’.



M-302
On this imprint of an Indus stamp we see the arrow sign on the left and next to it are two fish with two fins representing Saraswati, who is the also the deity of the nakshatra Swati:
Swati — the Self-Going Star; Its representative is a yellowish star commonly known as Arcturus (Alpha-Bootis). Range: 06°40' — 20°00' Libra Symbol: coral, young plant, sword Deity: Vayu, Saraswati Mode of Functioning: Passive Cast: Butcher Gender: Female Body parts: Chest Humor (Ayurvedic Constitution): Kapha Direction: west, southwest and the southeast Guna (Essence): Venus Tattwa (Element): Fire Gana (Type): Deva (godly) Orientation: Level Disposition: Moveable Ruling Planet: Rahu, (noordelijke maansknoop) Sounds: Ru, Ray, Raa, Tha Animal symbol: Buffalo Primary Motivation: Artha Enemy: Rohini
Published: en.vedicencyclopedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
So the first fish may represent Saraswati in Swati and the fish with a ‘hat’ represents the same goddess in Sravana. Above the second fish is an inverted V-sign symbolizing two spread legs, suggesting that Saraswati assists during the birth to the child in Sravana.
This means that the three signs indicate three phases from conception of an embryo to the birth of a child, as indicated in Khanda 19-25
o The arrow on the above stamp indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow
the quiver in Krittika (first month). o The first two-finned-fish represents Saraswati in the nakshatra Swati (fifth month).
o About nine months later this male embryo is born as a son in Sravana. The goddess of
this nakshatra is Saraswati.



M-962
An arrow is engraved on this Indus stamp together with three different fish:
o The arrow indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow the quiver in Krittika (first
month). o The first two-finned-fish represents Saraswati in Swati (fifth month).
o The pregnant woman takes a bath in the seventh month, when the sun passes through Purva Ashadha, the nakshatra of the water god Varuna symbolized by the four-finned-fish. o The fish with the ‘hat’ represents Saraswati, indicating the birth of the son in Sravana (ninth month).
The third fish has an inverted V-sign above it: two spread legs suggesting childbirth in Sravana.
H-1678 A
An arrow is engraved on this Indus stamp together with three different fish. The two lines at the right symbolize Indra who utters speech in Khanda 24:
Khanda 24.
10. And let him recite over (the child the following text), 'Speech, the goddess, (Sarasvatī) united with mind, together with breath, the child, uttered by Indra—may she rejoice in thee, the goddess, for the sake of joy, the great one, the sweet sounding, the music, full of music, the flowing, self-produced.'
So, the four signs on this stamp indicate four phases from conception and birth of a son:
o The arrow on this stamp indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow the quiver in Krittika in the first month. o The first two-finned-fish represents Saraswati in Swati (fifth month).
o The fish with the four fins represents Varuna, the deity of Purva Ashadha in the seventh month.
o The second two-finned-fish represents Saraswati, indicating the birth of the son in Sravana (ninth
month). o On the far right are two lines engraved that symbolize the storm god Indra in the tenth month.



M-684
We go on with this sign carved on this broken stamp. Generally it is seen as a ‘rake’, but when compared to Sumerian signs it symbolizes the concept of ‘big’ or ‘great’:
Proto-Cuneiform Signs by Ashur Cherry
gal [BIG] (6612x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. gal; gu-la; gu-ul; gal-gal; ku-ul ’(to be) big, great; (to be) retired, former; (to be) mature (of male animals)’ Akk. Rabû
gal
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
M-1122 A
In the middle of this broken Indus stamp is another 'great' sign. It refers to the Goddess
Saraswati for in the ‘The Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25’ she is the only deity who is called ‘the great one’:
Khanda 24. 10. And let him recite over (the child the following text), 'Speech, the goddess, (Sarasvatī) united with mind, together with breath, the child, uttered by Indra—may she rejoice in thee, the goddess, for the sake of joy, the great one, the sweet sounding, the music, full of music, the flowing, self-produced.'



M-37 a
On this stamp the 'great' sign is on the far right, indicating Saraswati, the goddess of Sravana:
o The arrow on the above stamp indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow
the quiver in Krittika (first month). o The two-finned-fish represents Saraswati in Swati (fifth month).
o The ‘great’ sign represents Saraswati indicating the birth of the son in the nakshatra
Sravana (ninth month).
M-1814
On this stamp, the ‘great’ sign is the third one in the row:
o The arrow on the above stamp indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow
the quiver in Krittika (first month). o The two-finned-fish represents Saraswati in Swati (fifth month).
o The ‘great’ sign represents the goddess of speech and music in Sravana (ninth
month). o The fish with four fins indicate that the child engendered in Krittika is born in
Shatabhisha/Varuna in the tenth month.



M-323
Again, on this stamp, the ‘great’ sign is the third one in the row:
o The arrow on the above stamp indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow
the quiver in Krittika (first month). o The two-finned-fish represents Saraswati in Swati (fifth month).
o The ‘great’ sign represents Saraswati who is mentioned Rigveda hymn 10-184, which
is recited in the seventh month.
o The fish with a ‘hat’ sign indicates that the child engendered in Krittika is born in
Sravana in the ninth month as Saraswati is the deity of this nakshatra.
h2148A
We will now study a number of tablets with three signs on the front that we already know: the arrow, the fish with two fins and the ‘great’ sign:
o The arrow on the above stamp indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow
the quiver in Krittika (first month). o The two-finned-fish represents Saraswati in Swati (fifth month).
o The ‘great’ sign represents Saraswati who is mentioned Rigveda hymn 10-184, which
is recited in the seventh month.
h2148B
But at the back we see a human figure holding a kumbha. This figure is the child born in the tenth months and the kumbha he is holding has three different meanings.



H-346 A
On this side of a small round tablet we see the same arrow, fish with two fins and a 'large' sign.
H-346 B
Here we see another human figure holding a kumbha. First of all, according to Kanda 25, a child is fed after his birth, which is here suggested by his holding a kumbha:
3. Let him mix together butter and honey, milk curds and water, or grind together rice and barley, and give it to eat (to the child) thrice from gold (i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon),
A kumbha (Sanskrit: कुम्भ ) is a type of pottery in India. Traditionally, it is made by Kumbhars, also known as Prajapatis.
In the context of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist mythology, the kumbha symbolises the womb. It represents fertility, life, generative power of human beings and sustenance and is generally associated with devis, particularly Ganga.
In Hindu astrology, the kumbha stands for the zodiac sign Aquarius and is ruled by 2 important
planets that is (Saturn and Rahu). Kumbha is also associated with the Kumbha Mela, which happens when the planet Brihaspati moves into Aquarius.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbha
It turns out that this kumbha symbolizes a womb and it also represents the zodiac sign Aquarius.



H-2147 A
A broken tablet with a two-finned-fish and a 'great' sign.
H-2147 B
So, the kumbha on the back side symbolizes a womb, which means that it represents the maternal principle and the human figure represents the son being born.
In addition, the same kumbha stands for the zodiac sign Aquarius, and thus the son is born when the sun passed through this constellation in the tenth month.
H-940 A
Again a tablet with an arrow, a two-finned-fish and a 'great' sign.
H-940 B
So we have noticed that the kumbha symbolizes three different meanings:
o The Kanda 25 reads: ‘Let him mix together butter and honey, milk curds and water,
or grind together rice and barley, and give it to eat (to the child) thrice from gold (i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon)’, so the kumbha is a cup in the first place. o It symbolizes the womb which indicates childbirth.
o And it stands for the zodiac sign Aquarius suggesting that this human figure is born
when the sun passes through this constellation.



H-230 A
We move on to the second sign here, this sign is more or less similar to the Egyptian ankh and symbolizes ‘life’.
In the Rigveda Agni is called: ‘Lord of all life’:
Rigveda hymn 1-27 Agni.
3 Lord of all life, from near; from far, do thou, O Agni evermore Protect us from the sinful man.
As well as: ‘Spring of life’:
Rigveda hymn 1-31 Agni.
10 Agni, thou art our Providence, our Father thou - we are thy brethren and thou art our spring of
life.
‘The Hymns of the Rigveda’ Translated by Ralph T. H. Griffith
2nd edition, Kotagiri (Nilgiri) 1896 From the Preface to the first edition, May 25th, 1889
And so, the four signs on the stamp above indicate four activities from conception of an embryo to the birth of a child, as described in the Sankhayana Grihya Khanda 19-25:
o The arrow on the above stamp indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow
the quiver in Krittika (first month). o The ankh sign suggests that in Krittika Agni gives life to the engendered embryo in the
first month (see below). o The first two-finned-fish represent Saraswati who is mentioned Rigveda hymn 10-184,
which is recited in the seventh month. o The second two-finned-fish suggests that Saraswati assists during the birth to the son
in Sravana in the ninth month.
An ankh made of Egyptian faience
In Egypt ankh represents the word for ‘life’:
The ankh or key of life is an ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol used in Egyptian art and writing to represent the word for ‘life’ and, by extension, as a symbol of life itself.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankh



M-769
On this broken stamp is an ankh sign next to the arrow sign. The point is that Agni is the deity of Krittika:
3 Krittika
an old name of the Pleiades; personified as the nurses of Kārttikeya, a son of Shiva. Astrological Mate: Surya (Sun) Symbol: Knife or spear
Rigvedic name: Agni, god of fire
Indian zodiac: 26°40′ Mesha – 10° Vrishabha Western zodiac: 22° 40′ Taurus – 6° Gemini
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
So the stamp above suggest that the fire god gives ‘life’ during the conceiving of a child.
M-815
But Agni is also the deity of Visakha. It could therefore also be that Agni still gives life to the fetus in the sixth month:
16 Visakha
‘forked, having branches’; also known as rādhā ’the gift’ α, β, γ and ι Librae Astrological Mate: Guru (Jupiter) Symbol: Triumphal arch, potter's wheel Rigvedic name: Indra, chief of the gods; Agni, god of Fire Indian zodiac: 20° Tula – 3° 20′ Vrishchika Western zodiac: 16° – 29° 20′ Scorpio
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra



M-123a
On this stamp the ankh is on the far right. This suggests that Agni continues to give life after birth as requested in Khanda 25:
Khanda 25. 7. (He then makes two other oblations with the verses,) '(May) this Agni, the excellent one, (give)
thee to-day life for (our) prayers; give us life that we may live long,'—(and,) 'Life-giving, Agni, be
strong by Havis; may thy face and thy seat be full of ghee; drinking ghee, the sweet honey of the cow, protect, as a father (protects) his son, here N.N.' The tenth oblation of the mess of cooked food with the verse, 'Thou, Soma, givest bliss to the old one' (Rig-veda I, 91, 7).
H-68
Also on this stamp the ankh is on the far right: again in Khanda 25 Agni is asked to continue to give life after birth.



H-64
We continue with a sign that is in third place on this stamp: a scale with food which is going to be sacrificed in the seventh month, according to Khanda 22:
Khanda 22. 1. In the seventh month (Purva Ashadha: Varuna), at her first pregnancy, the Sîmantonnayana (or parting of the hair). 2. He causes her, after she has bathed and put on a (new) garment which has not yet been washed, to sit down behind the fire. 3. He sacrifices, while she takes hold of him, with the Mahâvyâhritis.
4. He cooks a mess of food,
5. According to some (teachers) boiled rice with Mudga beans. 6. The implements used and the Nakshatra should be of male gender. 7. (He then sacrifices with the following texts,) 'May Dhâtar give to his worshipper further life and safety; may we obtain the favour of the god whose laws are truthful. 'Dhâtar disposes of offspring and wealth; Dhâtar has created this whole world; Dhâtar will give a son to the sacrificer: to him you shall sacrifice, an offering rich in ghee.'
And so, the four signs on the stamp above indicate four activities from conception of an embryo to the birth of a child, as described in the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25:
o The arrow on the above stamp indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow
the quiver in Krittika (first month). o The ankh sign indicates that Agni gives life to the fetus in Krittika, in the first month.
o The scale with food suggests that food is sacrificed in the seventh month.
o The fish with four fins indicate that the child, engendered in Krittika, is born about ten
month later in Shatabhisha/Varuna.



M-1206 AE
Here we see an arrow and a fish with four vertical lines next to it. The number four occurs in Khanda 24 describing the ceremony for the newly born child. Herein it is described that pulverized hair of an ox is mixed with four substances to be given four times to the born son:
Khanda 24. 1. Now the Gâtakarman (i.e. ceremony for the new-born child). (-) 6. On the tenth day a name for common use, which is pleasing to the Brâhmanas.
7. Let him pulverise black and white and red hairs of a black ox, intermix (that powder) with those
four substances (see Sûtra 3), and give it to eat (to the child) four times: such (is the opinion of)
Mândûkeya (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad).
8. If he likes (let him do so) with the words, 'Bhûh! The Rig-veda I lay into thee, N.N., svâhâ!
And so, the three signs on the stamp above indicate three activities from conception of an embryo to the birth of a child, as described in the Khanda 19-25:
o The arrow on the above stamp indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow
the quiver. This happens in Krittika (first month). o The two-finned-fish suggests that Saraswati assists during the birth to the fetus in
Sravana in the ninth month. o The four lines indicate the four substances and the four times the child has to eat the
four substances mixed with the hairs of the ox in the tenth month.
.
I think that many of the signs applied to the Indus stamps can be understood from the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Chapter 19-25 . Therefore, this essay will be continued

Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Chapter 19-25
Khanda 19. 1. Let him pound the root of the Adhyândâ plant (Prisniparnî ('speckled-leaf,' Hemionitis cordifolia) Hemionitis cordifolia); and sprinkle it at the time of her monthly period with the two (verses), 'Speed away from here; a husband has she' (Rig-veda X, 85, 21. 22),
21 Rise up from hence: this maiden hath a husband. I laud Visvavasu (Some of the most prominent gandharvas include Tumburu, Visvavasu (who was the father of Pramadvara), with hymns and homage. Seek in her father's home another fair one, and find the portion from of old assigned thee. 22 Rise up from hence, Visvavasu: with reverence we worship thee. Seek thou another willing maid, and with her husband leave the bride.

Or, 'As the earth is pregnant with Agni, as the heaven is with Indra pregnant, as Vâyu dwells in the womb of the regions (of the earth), thus I place an embryo into thy womb, N.N.!' 6. Or, 'May a male embryo enter thy womb, as an arrow the quiver; may a man be born here, a son after ten months. 'Give birth to a male child; may after him (another) male be born; their mother shalt thou be, of the born, and (to others) mayst thou give birth. 'In the male verily, in the man dwells the sperm; he shall pour it forth into the woman: thus has said Dhâtar (possessing; bearing), thus Pragâpati has said. 'Pragâpati has created him, Savitar has shaped him. Imparting birth of females to other (women) may he put here a man. 'From the auspicious sperms which the men produce for us, produce thou a son; be a well-breeding cow. 'Roar, be strong, put into her an embryo, achieve it; a male, thou male, [a bull, o bull] put into her; to generation we call thee. 'Open thy womb; take in the man's sperm; may a male child be begotten in the womb. Him thou shalt bear; (having dwelt) ten months in the womb may he be born, the most excellent of his kin.'

'May he succeed who lights fire' (V, 37, 2),
2 With kindled fire and strewn grass let him worship, and, Soma-presser, sing with stones adjusted: And let the priest whose press-stones ring forth loudly, go down with his oblation to the river.
'Of tawny shape' (II, 3, 9), with Svâhâ at the end (of each verse).
9 Born is the pious hero swift of hearing, like gold in hue, well formed, and full of vigour. May Tvastar lengthen our line and kindred, and may they reach the place which Gods inhabit.
Footnotes 46:3 20, 3. On suṅgâ compare the note of Nârâyana and the verse quoted from the Karmapradîpa, p. 131 of the German edition. On kusakantaka Nârâyana says, kusakantakam kuso darbhas tasya kantakah sûkî (sûka, MS. Berol. Orient. fol. 60z) tam vâ peshayitvâ. I do not understand why the commentators of Pâraskara, whom Professor Stenzler has followed in his translation of Par. I, 14, 4, make kantaka equal to mûla. 46:5 Nasto dakshinatah stands here as in chap. 19, 1. Âsvalâyana I, 13, 6 has dakshinasyâm nâsikâyâm, and so has also p. 47 Pâraskara I, 13. Comp. the natthukamma treated of in the Pâli Buddhist texts (Mahâvagga VI, 13) and in the medical literature.
Khanda 21. 1. In the fourth month (Leo) the Garbharakshana (i.e. the ceremony for the protection of the embryo), 2. Sacrificing six oblations from a mess of cooked food with (the six verses of the hymn), 'Agni, joined with the prayer' (Rig-veda X, 162),
Rigveda 10-162 Agni 1. May Agni, yielding to our prayer, the Raksas-slayer, drive away The malady of evil name that hath beset thy labouring womb. 2 Agni, concurring in the prayer, drive off the eater of the flesh, The malady of evil name that hath attacked thy babe and womb. 3 That which destroys the sinking germ, the settled, moving embryo, That which will kill the babe at birth, even this will we drive far away. 4 That which divides thy legs that it may lie between the married pair, That penetrates and licks thy side, -even this will we exterminate. 5 What rests by thee in borrowed form of brother, lover, or of lord, And would destroy thy Progeny, -even this will we exterminate. 6 That which through sleep or darkness hath deceived thee and lies down by thee, And will destroy thy progeny, --even this will we exterminate.
3. With (the verses), 'From thy eyes, thy nose' (Rig-veda X, 163), verse by verse besmearing her limbs with Âgya salve.
Rigveda 10-163 1. From both thy nostrils, from thine eyes, from both thine ears and from thy chin, Forth from thy head and brain and tongue I drive thy malady away. 2 From the neck-tendons and the neck, from the breast-bones and from the spine,



From shoulders, upper, lower arms, I drive thy malady away. 3 From viscera and all within, forth from the rectum, from the heart, From kidneys, liver, and from spleen, I drive thy malady away. 4 From thighs, from knee-caps, and from heels, and from the forepart of the feet, From hips from stomach, and from groin I drive thy malady away. 5 From what is voided from within, and from thy hair, and from they nails, From all thyself from top to toe, I drive thy malady away. 6 From every member, every hair, disease that comes in every joint, From all thyself, from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.
Khanda 22. 1. In the seventh month (Purva Ashadha: Varuna), at her first pregnancy, the Sîmantonnayana (or parting of the hair). 2. He causes her, after she has bathed and put on a (new) garment which has not yet been washed, to sit down behind the fire. 3. He sacrifices, while she takes hold of him, with the Mahâvyâhritis. 4. He cooks a mess of food, 5. According to some (teachers) boiled rice with Mudga beans. 6. The implements used and the Nakshatra should be of male gender. 7. (He then sacrifices with the following texts,) 'May Dhâtar give to his worshipper further life and safety; may we obtain the favour of the god whose laws are truthful. 'Dhâtar disposes of offspring and wealth; Dhâtar has created this whole world; Dhâtar will give a son to the sacrificer: to him you shall sacrifice, an offering rich in ghee.' (Besides) with the three verses, 'Negamesha, fly away' (Rig-veda Khailika sûkta, after X, 184, vol. vi, p. 31),
Rigveda 10-184 1. May Vishnu form and mould the womb, may Tvastar duly shape the forms, Prajapati infuse the stream, and Dhatar lay the germ for thee. 2 O Sinivali, set the germ, set thou the germ, Sarasvati: May the Twain Gods bestow the germ, the Asvins crowned with lotuses. 3 That which the Asvins Twain rub forth with the attrition-sticks of gold, That germ of thine we invocate, that in the tenth month thou mayst bear.
and in the sixth place the verse, 'Pragâpati' (Rig-veda X, 121, 10).
Rigveda 10-121 Ka. 10 Prajapati! thou only comprehendest all these created things, and none beside thee. Grant us our hearts' desire when we invoke thee: may we have store of riches in possession.
8. (The husband then) parts her hair, upwards, beginning from the middle, with a porcupine's quill that has three white spots, or with a Darbha needle together with unripe Udumbara fruits, with the words, 'Bhûr bhuvah svah.' [‘Erde, Luftgebied, Himmel]. 9. He lays down (the thing he has used) in her lap, 10. Ties (the fruits) to a string of three twisted threads and fastens them to her neck with the words, 'Rich in sap is this tree; like the sappy one be thou fruitful.' 11. (The husband) then says to lute-players, 'Sing ye the king12. 'Or if anybody else is still more valiant.' 13. Having poured fried grain into a water-pot, let him cause her to drink it with the six verses,



'May Vishnu take care of thy womb,' 'I call Râkâ' (Rig-veda X, 184, 1; II, 32, 4-8).
Rigveda 10-184 1. May Vishnu form and mould the womb, may Tvastar duly shape the forms, Prajapati infuse the stream, and Dhatar lay the germ for thee.
14. Let him then touch her (with the words), 15. 'The winged one art thou [A falcon are you, a bird], the Garutmat; the Trivrit (stoma) is thy head, the Gâyatra thy eye, the metres thy limbs, the Yagus thy name, the Sâman thy body.' 16. Let him cause her to sing merrily, 17. Wearing, if she likes, many gold ornaments. 18. A bull is the fee for the sacrifice.
Footnotes 48:8 22, 8. Comp. above, chap. 12, 6. 48:10 Nârâyana: tisribhis tantubhir vritte sûtre udumbaraphalâni . . . gale . . . badhnâti. I have translated accordingly. Pâraskara I, 15, 6 uses the same expression trivrit. Professor Stenzler there translates it, on the authority of Gayarâma, 'dreifache Haarflechte,' and says in his note on that passage that, according to Sâṅkhâyana, he would have to tie the things with a threefold string to the neck of the woman, as if Sâṅkhâyana's statement were different from that of Pâraskara. But both authors have the same word, and only the commentators differ in their explanations thereof. 48:11 Âsvalâyana more explicitly says (I, 14, 6), Somam râgânam samgâyetâm iti. 48:13 In my German translation there is a mistake which should be corrected. I have there referred shalrika to the verses Râkâm p. 79 aham, which are actually only five in number. The six verses are Vishnur yonim, &c., and the five verses mentioned. 49:15 Vâgasaneyi Samhitâ XII, 4. 49:16-17 16, 17. Nârâyana: modamânîm harshayuktâm tam mâṅgalikair gîtair gâyayet . . . mahâhemavatîm bahvâbharanayuktâm vâ gâyayet.
Khanda 23. 1. Let him pound the roots of the plants kâkâtanî, makakakâtanî, kosâtakî, of the eggplant, and of the indigo plant, and besmear (therewith) the place in which she is going to be confined, in order to drive away the Rakshas.
Khanda 24. 1. Now the Gâtakarman (i.e. ceremony for the new-born child). 2. Let (the father) breathe three times on the new-born child and then draw in his breath with the words, 'Draw in your breath with the Rik, breathe within with the Yagus, breathe forth with the Sâman.' 3. Let him mix together butter and honey, milk curds and water, or grind together rice and barley, and give it to eat (to the child) thrice from gold (i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon), 4. With (the verse), 'I administer to thee honey food for the festival, the wisdom ("veda") raised by Savitar the bountiful; long-living, protected by the gods, live a hundred autumns in this world, N.N.!'(with these words) he gives him a name beginning with a sonant, with a semivowel in it, consisting of two syllables, or of four syllables, or also of six syllables; he should take a krit (suffix), not a taddhita. 5. That (name only) his father and his mother should know. 6. On the tenth day a name for common use, which is pleasing to the Brâhmanas. 7. Let him pulverise black and white and red hairs of a black ox, intermix (that powder) with those four substances (see Sûtra 3), and give it to eat (to the child) four times: such (is the opinion of) Mândûkeya (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad).



8. If he likes (let him do so) with the words, 'Bhûh! The Rig-veda I lay into thee, N.N., svâhâ! 'Bhuvah! The Yagur-veda I lay into thee, N.N., svâhâ! 'Svah! The Sâma-veda I lay into thee, N.N., svâhâ! 'Bhûr bhuvah svah! Vâkovâkya (colloquies), Itihâsa, and Purâna—Om! All the Vedas I lay into thee, N.N., svâhâ!' 9. The production of intelligence (is performed) by thrice saying in his right ear, 'Speech!' 10. And let him recite over (the child the following text), 'Speech, the goddess, (Sarasvatī) united with mind, together with breath, the child, uttered by Indra—may she rejoice in thee, the goddess, for the sake of joy, the great one, the sweet sounding, the music, full of music, the flowing, self-produced.' 11. Let him tie a piece of gold to a hempen string, 12. And bind it to (the child's) right hand until (the mother) gets up (from childbed). 13. After the tenth day let him give it to the Brâhmanas, 14. Or keep it himself.
Footnotes 49:1 24, 1. Comp. Dr. Speijer's essay on the Gâtakarman (Leiden, 1872). Nârâyana observes that, as it is prescribed below (chap. 25, 4) that a mess of food is to be cooked in the sûtikâgni, here the sûtikâgni is established, and sacrifice is performed therein. The Sûtra I, 25, 4, from which it is to be inferred that the sûtikâgni should be kept, is considered, accordingly, as a Gñâpaka (see Professor Bühler's notes on Âpastamba I, II, 7; Gautama p. 50 I, 31; Nârâyana's note on chap. 25, 4, p. 133 of the German edition). 50:2 Abhyavânya should be corrected into abhyapânya, as in IV, 18, 1 nearly all the MSS. read nivâta instead of nipâta. The Sâmbavya MS. reads in the text, trir abhyânyânuprânya; in the commentary trir anyapânyânuprânyâ. Comp., on the terminology of the different vital airs, Speijer, Gâtakarma, p. 64 seq.; Eggeling, S.B.E., vol. xii, p. 20. 51:8 Veti vikalpârthe. bhûr rigvedam ityâdikaturbhir mantrair asâv ity atra pûrveva (read pûrvavat?) kumâranâmagrahanapûrvakam kumâram prâsayet. Nârâyana. 51:12 Bâlasya dakshine haste. Nârâyana.
Khanda 25. 1 1. After ten days the getting up (of the mother from childbed). 2. Father and mother with washed heads, wearing (new) clothes which have not yet been washed; 3. And so also the child. 4 4. Let (the father) cook a mess of food in that same fire that has been kept from her confinement, 5. And let him make oblations to the Tithi of (the child's) birth and to three constellations with their (presiding) deities. 6. Let him place in the middle the oblation to that constellation under which (the child) is born; the deity, however, is constantly to precede (the corresponding Nakshatra). 7 7. (He then makes two other oblations with the verses,) '(May) this Agni, the excellent one, (give) thee to-day life for (our) prayers; give us life that we may live long,'—(and,) 'Life-giving, Agni, be strong by Havis; may thy face and thy seat be full of ghee; drinking ghee, the sweet honey of the cow, protect, as a father (protects) his son, here N.N.' The tenth oblation of the mess of cooked food with the verse, 'Thou, Soma, givest bliss to the old one' (Rig-veda I, 91, 7).
Rigveda 1-91 Soma. 7 To him who keeps the law, both old and young, thou givest happiness, And energy that he may live.



8. Having pronounced aloud (the child's) name, 9. And caused the Brâhmanas to say auspicious words, 10. And having sacrificed in the same way every month to the Tithi of (the child's) birth, 11. He sacrifices, when one year has expired, on the (ordinary) domestic fire.
Footnotes 51:1 25, 1. After ten days the impurity (asauka) that falls on the mother at her confinement, ceases; see Gautama XIV, 16; Manu V, 62; Vasishtha IV, 21. 52:4 Comp. the note on chap. 24, 1. 52:7 The first Mantra is corrupt; in the Âsvalâyana-Srauta-sûtra (II, 10, 4) its text runs thus, âyush te visvato dadhad ayam agnir varenyah, &c. Comp. Atharva-veda VII, 53, 6. 52:11 'The words "every month" (Sûtra 10) retain their value p. 53(here also). Thus the sûtikâgni is to be kept through one year. After the lapse of that year one should sacrifice every month on the domestic fire as long as his life lasts. As it is said "in the domestic fire," the sûtikâgni is not to be kept any longer.' Nârâyana.
