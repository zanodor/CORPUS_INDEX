The learned Vidura, conversant with the jargon of the Mlecchas, addressed the learned Yudhiṣṭhira who also was conversant with the same jargon, in the words of the Mleccha tongue, so as to be unintelligible to all except Yudhiṣṭhira-- Mbh.1.147.7848 O son of Pandu, Vidura also told thee something in the Mlechchha tongue to which thou also didst reply in same language--Mbh.1.149.7905 (Jātugr̥ha parvan)

When the people no longer follow the Pāṇḍavas, Vidura, knower of dharma’s every nuance, speaks
to Yudhiṣṭhira to make him sensible of the peril he is in. The learned Vidura speaks to Yudhiṣṭhira in
the dialect of the mlechchas, which only they two understand. Vidura says, ‘He who knows that his
enemies are plotting against him must take care to guard himself against danger. He who knows that
there are weapons other than blades of steel, which can kill the body, and who knows how these can
be rendered harmless, shall always be safe from his enemies. The wise man protects himself with
the knowledge that neither the consumer of straw nor the drier of dew burns those that live in a hole
in the heart of a jungle. The blind man does not see into the future; he has no sense of direction. He
whose purpose is not firm, never finds prosperity. Remember this, and be vigilant. He who accepts
the perfidious offering of a deadly weapon, not made of steel, from his enemy, to dwell in, escapes
death by fire by burrowing like a jackal underground: a tunnel with many exits. Ranging over the
world a man acquires knowledge of its ways; by the stars he finds his direction; and he that controls
the five senses remains safe from his enemies.’ Yudhiṣṭhira says to Vidura, ‘I have understood you.’

Now Vidura walks around them in pradakshina, bids farewell to them and turns back into
the city. When the people, Bhishma and Vidura have all gone back, Kunti goes up to
Yudhiṣṭhira alone, and asks, ‘Kshattri spoke to you strangely and softly, and you replied in
the same tongue which none of us understood. If I can know what he says, tell me.’
Yudhiṣṭhira replies, ‘The virtuous Vidura said to me that we should be warned that the
mansion built to house us in Varanavrata has been built with incendiary materials. He said,
“The path to escape will be revealed to you,” and also “Those that can control their five
senses shall gain sovereignty over the whole world.” What I said to the good Vidura is “I
have understood you.”’
Note: the path to escape is later revealed by Khanaka, sent by Vidura.
Yudhiṣṭhira explains to Kunti what Vidura told him in mleccha about incendiary materials

Yudhishitra looks around the edifice, and drawing Bhima aside tells him that it has been built with every possible incendiary material. The eldest Pāṇḍava smells the fat mixed liberally with ghee and lac, and says to his brother, ‘Parantapa, our enemies have used clever artisans to create this palace. They have built it with hemp, resin, heath, straw and bamboos, all soaked in ghee. The villainous Purochana is Duryodhana’s man and he stays close to us because he wants to immolate me in this murderous palace. But, my brother, the keen Vidura knew about the danger and warned me of it. He warned me that Duryodhana has plotted to kill us all.’ Bhima says, ‘We must return to the old palace.’...Vaisampayana continued, “The same day, a miner, a friend of Vidura’s, comes to the Pāṇḍavas and says to them in private, ‘I am a master tunneller, and your uncle Vidura sent me to you. Tell me what you want me to do. Vidura, who trusts me, said, “Go to the Pāṇḍavas and help them.”’ ‘Tell me what I can do for you.’ ‘I have learnt that Purochana means to torch this house of lac on the fourteenth night of this dark fortnight. He will fire the front door and immolate the Purushavyaghras, the Pāṇḍavas, and their mother Kunti while they sleep.” The vile Duryodhana has plotted your murder, my lords. So that you believe me Vidura said these words to me in the mlechcha bhasha, the very ones he spoke to you as you left Hastinapura, and also the reply you made to him in the same tongue.’
Khanaka, miner, explains in mleccha

The miner repeats Vidura’s conversation with Yudhiṣṭhira in the rare dialect. Hearing those words, Yudhiṣṭhira is satisfied. He says to the miner, ‘Welcome friend! I know now that you are indeed a true and trusted friend, devoted to my loving uncle Vidura, and that he has sent you... Look how cunningly Purochana has built this great house of lac. It is slick against the arsenal of Varanavrata, with its lofty ramparts and no escape on any side when the fire breaks out. Thus Vidura guessed at the murderous intention of Duryodhana... The miner replies, ‘So be it,’ and immediately and carefully begins his excavation, to create a large subterranean tunnel leading out of the palace. The mouth of the tunnel is in the very heart of the palace, level with the floor, covered over by planks of wood and a carpet, so Purochana who is always
at the front door never suspects a thing... O King, they live vigilantly in the palace of lac, with every show of friendship and trust in Purochana, while in fact they are anxious and intensely sensible of danger. The citizens of Varanavata never know anything, either, about the Pāṇḍavas’ plans. Indeed, apart from themselves, only Vidura’s trusted friend, the miner, has any inkling of what is afoot.”

A sharp wind blows through the night, and while Purochana also sleeps from a surfeit of wine
with which Bhima plies him, Bhima sets fire to the room where Duryodhana’s man lies. He
then sets his brand to the front door and to other parts of the deadly house, which blazes up
fiercely, as it has been built to do. The Pāṇḍavas and their mother go down into the miner’s
tunnel. As the palace burns, the heat and the roar of the towering flames awaken the people of
Varanavrata, who come running out of their homes. Their hearts breaking to see the inferno,
they cry, ‘Ah, Duryodhana’s evil man built the palace with incendiary materials under our
very noses. And now he has murdered the sinless sons of Pandu, as if they are enemies. A
curse be upon Dhritarashtra, who allowed this. Purochana has already paid with his life for
his sin; one day the king and his demonic son will also pay.’ And they weep, helplessly, for
by now the fire has all but consumed the great edifice
The great escape from the blazing lac house

All night, the people stand around the blazing mansion, and lament. Meanwhile, Kunti and her sons emerge from the mouth of the tunnel, some way from the palace and melt away into the night, unobserved. But they are full of sleep and fear, and they cannot go as quickly as they want, since Kunti is with them. The others, too, are faint from exhaustion, all but one of them. Then, Rajan, Bhima of untold strength and the fleetness of his airy father picks up all his brothers and his mother, and carrying them easily, plunges along through the night. He sets Kunti upon his shoulders, the twins on his hips, and carries Yudhiṣṭhira and Arjuna in either arm.

...Vaisampayana said, “At this same time, Vidura has sent another man he trusted, a pure soul, into the forest surrounding Varanavrata. This man sees the Pāṇḍavas making their way through the trees with their mother. He sees them trying to measure the depth of the river in a certain place, obviously wanting to ford the water to safety on the other side. Vidura knows well how deep Duryodhana’s hatred runs and how murderous his agents are. He sends his trusted agent to the Pāṇḍavas to help them, and this man now brings the sons of Pandu to a boat tethered to the riverbank, an extraordinary craft with engines and sails, made by the finest shipwrights, one that is proof against wave and wind, a boat that flies across any current as swiftly as a thought. The man now says to the Pāṇḍavas, ‘O Yudhiṣṭhira, listen to what I have to say, so that you know that I am indeed sent by your uncle Vidura. “The wise man protects himself with the knowledge that neither the consumer of straw nor the drier of dew burns those that live in a hole in the heart of a jungle.”

These are the very words Vidura said to you and by these know that I am his trusted man and his agent. Vidura, who knows all things, says to you, “Kuntiputra, you will one day surely prevail over Karna, Duryodhana and his brothers, and the evil Shakuni in battle.” My boat is ready to bear you away, far from these places of danger. It is a marvellous boat and goes softly and smoothly over the river.’ Then, seeing Kunti and her sons apprehensive and forlorn, the tall man goes on the boat with them himself. He says again to them, ‘Vidura, who sniffed your heads in love and embraced you fondly, says that you must be ever vigilant, for the peril to your lives is very real.’ With that, he takes the Narapumgavas and their gracious mother across the Ganga. He helps them ashore there and softly cries Jaya!
