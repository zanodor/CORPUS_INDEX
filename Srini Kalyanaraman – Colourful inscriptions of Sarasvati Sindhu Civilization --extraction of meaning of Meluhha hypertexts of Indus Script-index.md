Image = Sound = Meaning conveyed by an iron smelter
--All words are semantic indicators (ellāc collum
poruḷ kuṟittanave)--i.e., rebus (in Latin ablative
plural of res = things) means ‘of or by things’ and
by extension ‘not by words but by things.’
-- In these culture-specific Indus Script messages,
semantics of ‘leap’ and ‘blaze’ IMAGES are used
to signify one word : sāḷ ʻworkshop’.
--The IMAGES of ‘leap’ and ‘blaze’ are used
because a similar-sounding, rebus word signifies
this word sāḷ ʻworkshop’ of kolhe ‘iron smelter’
Images of tiger convey the
word: kul, kola ‘tiger’ rebus:
kol ‘working in iron’ kolhe ‘smelter’

Colour Vision. [quote]To see anything at all we need some tiny little helpers inside our eyeballs, the so called photorecptors. There are two different types of them: rods and cones. Both of them are sitting on the retina and pass information of light on to our brain. There are about 120 million rods which are very sensitive to light but not to color. The cones are the photoreceptors which are responsible for our color vision. They are only
about 6 to 7 million of them, gathering together very closely in the center of the retina, the so called fovea centralis. And here comes the clue: Each of those cones is carrying one out of three different photopigments and therefore reacts differently on colored light sources. For each of this three types there exists a specific color absorption curve with peaks at different points in the color spectrum. •S-cones: sensitive to short wavelength light with a peak at ca. 420nm (blue)
•M-cones: sensitive to medium wavelength light, peak at ca. 530nm (green) •L-cones: sensitive to long wavelength light, peak at ca. 560nm (red) [unquote]

Normalised absorption spectra of the three human photopsins and of human rhodopsin (dashed).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopsin Rhodopsin detects electromagnetic radiation—light with wavelengths in the range 400
700 nanometres (1 nm = 10−9m). Rhodopsin was discovered by Franz Christian Boll in 1876.

[quote] Small cells called photoreceptors
in the eye play a vital role in night
vision and also affect how the eye sees
color. Photoreceptor cells are located in
the retina, which is the light-sensitive
tissue that lines the back of the eye.
There are two kinds of photoreceptor
cells: cones and rods. Each type of
photoreceptor works to convert different
levels of light into signals that are then
sent to the brain to form a visual
representation. [unquote]

Lin, Shuo Wang, Julie A. Brefczynski-Lewis, Chris A. Frum & James W. Lewis (2021) Chinese-English bilinguals show
linguistic-perceptual links in the brain associating short spoken phrases with corresponding real-world natural action sounds by
semantic category, Language, Cognition and Neuroscience, 36:6, 773-790, DOI: 10.1080/23273798.2021.1883073
Abstract. ”Higher cognitive functions such as
linguistic comprehension must ultimately
relate to perceptual systems in the brain,
though how and why this forms remains
unclear. Different brain networks that
mediate perception when hearing have
recently been proposed to respect a
taxonomic neurobiological model for the
processing of different acoustic-semantic
categories of real-world natural sounds...The
results revealed a double-dissociation of
cortical regions that were preferential for
representing knowledge of human versus
environmental action events, whether
conveyed through natural sounds or the
corresponding spoken phrases depicted by
either comprehended language. ”

Figure 2. (A) Features from the neurobiological taxonomic model (from Fig. 1)
that were being tested in the present study, contrasting brain responses to action
sounds (green box) relative to speech (red text), and further contrasting the
semantic category human action sounds (yellow box) versus environmental
action sounds (blue box). Resulting cortical activation patterns of
Chinese/English bilingual listeners (n=16) projected onto (B) fiducial and (C)
inflated 3-dimensional surface models of the brain (standardized PALS atlas).
Colored cortices depict regions differentially responsive for representing
knowledge of human actions (yellow hues, puncorrected < 0.0005; pcorrected < 0.05)
versus knowledge of environmental action events (blue hues), whether heard
and correctly categorized as natural sound stimuli (perceptual system, PS), as
corresponding spoken Chinese phrases (Chi), or corresponding spoken English
phrases (Eng). Regions preferential for processing language (transparent red)
versus the natural sound stimuli (transparent green) are also illustrated for
comparison (both at puncorrected < 0.0005; pcorrected < 0.05). Histograms show the
BOLD percent signal change (average ± SEM) for various regions of interest
illustrating activation preference for the human (H) versus environmental (E)
category of action sound, whether heard as natural sounds or spoken phrases in
English or Chinese. IPL = intraparietal lobule; MFG = middle frontal gyrus;
SFG = superior frontal gyrus; STG = superior temporal gyrus; TPO-J =
temporal-parietal-occipital junction. Refer to text for other details.

[quote]Fig. 1. Pyramids and Palm Trees example stimuli and results from Adamczuk et al. (2016). (Top) “Stimuli and tasks in fMRI experiment. Associative-semantic task with words (blue) and with pictures (purple). Visuoperceptual task with words (cyan) or pictures (yellow). Resting baseline with fixation point (red). Subjects were asked to press a left- or right-hand key depending on which of the 2 lower stimuli matched the upper stimulus more closely in meaning (blue, purple) or in size on the screen (cyan, yellow). A given concept triplet was presented in either the word or the picture format, and this was counterbalanced across subjects. Arrow in the top of the figure shows a timeline of 1 fMRI run, with each condition indicated in its respective color. The order of conditions was randomized for each run and subject. Translation: deur = door, hek = fence,
raam = window.” (Bottom) “Area in the left posterior MTG of significant correlation
between amyloidosis (SUVRcomp) and fMRI response during associative-semantic minus visuoperceptual condition (Contrast 1) (cluster peak −57, −45, 9, ext = 64 voxels, clusterlevel Pcorrected = 0.006). The color scale indicates the T-values. MNI coordinates are
indicated in the left upper corner and orientation of the brain in the right upper corner.” Figures reproduced with permission. We note here that whilst the visuoperceptual condition controls for the visual appearance of word/picture stimuli, it is likely to have placed lower demands on working memory. This is because unlike the associativesemantic condition it did not require the meaning of three words to be stored in working memory and compared). Consequently, the contrast map (bottom) may partially reflect
this. [unquote]
