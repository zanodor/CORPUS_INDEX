Celtic Astrology -- Early Irish Astrology: An Historical Argument by Peter Berresford Ellis
Early Irish Astrology: An Historical Argument by Peter Berresford Ellis
Ed. N.: This article was first published in Réalta (vol 3. n. 3, 1996),
the journal of The Irish Astrological Association.
In all histories of western astrology there is a curious omission.
There are no references to early Irish, nor - indeed - ancient
Celtic, astrological practices. In fact, the only serious scholarly
study on Celtic astrology was published in a French academic
journal in 1902. [1] This dissertation, in the light of modem
research, is open to debate.
The major reason for this neglect of the subject, at least during
the last fifty years, has undoubtedly been the insidious influence
of Robert Graves' The White Goddess (1949). This book has done
singular disservice to those who seek to study the realities of
Celtic cosmology and, especially, the practice of astrology.
Graves was not a Celtic scholar. His highly imaginative inventions
of the so-called 'tree calendar' and 'tree zodiac' inspired an
outpouring of books purporting to be on 'Celtic astrology'. Graves
and his acolytes have, unfortunately, seized the popular



imagination but their 'tree zodiac' has nothing at all to do with the
realities of the ancient Celtic world.
This is not the place to dissect Graves' inventions. This would
take a lengthy article. In this polemic, I intend to confine myself to
a brief outline of the historical reality of astrology in Irish society.
Ireland was, and still is, part of the Celtic world. The Celts by the
3rd Century BC had reached their greatest expansion in Europe.
They occupied a territory through Europe from Ireland, in the
west, to the central plain of Turkey (Galatia), in the east, even as
far as the sea of Azov, and north from Belgium, south into Italy, as
far as Ancona, also south to Cadiz on the Iberian peninsula. They
were one of the great founding civilizations of Europe; the first
northern European civilization to emerge into recorded history.
Although we have many hundreds of texts and inscriptions in
Continental Celtic languages dating from the 4th Century BC, our
earliest survivals from the extensive literatures of the Insular
Celts, the Irish and Welsh, do not start to date much before the
6th century AD.
Greek and Latin writers show clearly that the Celts were not
only advanced in astronomy but that they were respected,
especially by the Greeks, for their 'speculations from the stars'.
Even the Romans, from Caesar to Pliny, paid tribute to their
astronomy. One of the first to note that the ancient Celts believed
the world to be round (not flat) was Martial (c. AD 40-103/4) who,
himself, claimed Celtic ancestry.
The famous 1st Century BC Coligny Calendar, once thought to
be the most extensive document in a Celtic language but now
surpassed by other fascinating discoveries, has been dated to its
original computation, by its astronomical observations and



calculations. This highly sophisticated lunar and solar predictor
was, according to the leading Celtic scholar, Dr Garrett Olmsted,
first constructed in 1100 BC. [2] It is important to note that the
concepts of the calendar find parallels in Vedic cosmology. We
will return to this later.
It was the Greek Hippolytus (AD 170-236), using an earlier
source, who stated that the ancient Celts foretold the future from
the stars by ciphers and numbers after the manner of the
Pythagoreans. Space precludes a discussion on the argument
which took place among the Alexandrian School of Greek writers
as to whether the Celts borrowed their ideas from Pythagoras or
whether Pythagoras borrowed his ideas from the Cults. This
fascinating argument among Greek scholars began in the 2nd
Century BC and continued for some centuries. The concept that
the Greeks borrowed from the Celts, found a leading advocate in
the Athenian-born scholar Clement of Alexandria (c. AD 150 - AD
211/216).
To turn to the position in Ireland, the evidence shows that the
Irish, like the rest of the Celtic world, were also highly advanced in
astronomical observation, particularly in the construction of
calendars. One of the first Irishmen we can name as an
acknowledged expert in this field was Mo-Sinu maccu Min (d. AD
610), the abbot of Bangor, Co. Down. [3] His pupil, Mo Chuaróc
macc Neth Sémon of Munster, is recorded as having written a
major work on astronomical computations. Alas, no copy of that
seems to have survived but we do have a similar work by
Cummian (d. AD 633), a professor at Clonfert, Galway. [4] Then
we have a mid-7th Century astronomical text by Aibhistin (more
widely called Augustin and once confused with Augustine of
Hippo). Aibhistin was the earliest medieval writer to discuss the
question of the tides in relationship to the phases of the moon.



[5]
The Julian calendar appears to have been introduced into
Ireland by the end of the 5th Century AD, with the incoming of
Christianity, displacing native calendars. But a most exciting
recent discovery has been the 'lost' Irish 84-year Easter Table
covering the years AD 438-521, found during the 1980s in the
Biblioteca Antoniana, in Padua. This was the calendar, or
computus, referred to by Colmbanus in his famous letter to Pope
Gregory to support the Celtic dating of Easter. [6] It becomes
clear from both calendrical studies and astronomical tracts that
the forms of astrology being practiced in Ireland from the
introduction of the Christian period would be substantially the
same as those being practiced by the Greco-Romans at this time.
The Greco-Latin forms appear to have displaced the native
Irish system when Christianity and Latin learning entered the
country. This system was fairly well established in Ireland by the
7th Century AD from when our earliest surviving texts, on
astronomy and related astrology, survive.
In the 12th Century AD the new Arabic learning swept into
Ireland, carried there by returning Irish religious and scholars who
had been teaching in the great universities of Europe such as
Bologna, Padua and Montpellier. Father Francis Shaw SJ has
pointed out that at this time the Irish medical practitioners, who
were renown throughout Europe, adopted Arabic medical ideas.
As Father Shaw says: 'Arabian medicine had for sisters Arabian
philosophy and Arabian astrology'. [7]
During the period of the 12th to 17th Centuries we find many
works on Arabic astronomy and astrology being translated into
Irish [8] and that the Irish astrological practices took on the



Arabic forms which were also adopted by the rest of Western
Europe. One of the areas in which scholars must do more work is
with the countless untranslated and unedited Irish medical texts,
an area where astrology was used. Before 1800 the Irish language
contained the largest collection of medical manuscript literature
surviving in any one language.
With the English conquests of the 17th Century, the native
traditions of astrology were quickly stamped out and astrology
became the province of the colonists and their culture. One of the
last native works was written by a Jesuit priest from Co. Down,
Father Manus O'Donnell SJ in the mid-17th century which was
based on the Lunario of Geronymo Cortès, which has
subsequently been translated, introduced and edited with notes
and a glossary by F.W. O'Connell and R.M. Henry entitled An Irish
Corpus Astronomiae (David Nutt, London, 1915).
We can trace this historical development of Irish practices in a
linguistic mode in the earliest writings we find that the vocabulary
used to name the zodiac, planets, the galaxy and constellations,
were given in native concepts. [9] For example:
The constellation of Leo was known as An Corran, which means
a reaping hook. Next time you look at Leo note the sequence of
brighter stars rising above Regulus in the shape of a back-to
front question mark'?' which consequently resembles a sickle.
Mars was called An Cosnaighe or 'the defender'. Venus was
identified by at least three or four ancient names, as was Mercury.
These survive in modem Manx; The Pole Star was An Gaelin - the
beam that lights the way home. The Galaxy or Milky Way was
called Bealach na Bo Finne (the way of the white cow). Of the sun
and moon we have a surprisingly extensive vocabulary in Old
Irish. There are five names for the sun and six for the moon, all



native concepts.
Perhaps it is superfluous to add that these terms were also
backed by the necessary mathematical technical jargon required
for the practice of astronomy and astrology. One should point out
that while this vocabulary still survives in Irish, the English
equivalents are loan words from Greek, Latin and Arabic.
When the Greco-Latin ideas took firmer hold on the Irish
perceptions, we note a change in the vocabulary. Native ideas of
planets and zodiacal signs began to be dropped in favour of the
Greco-Latin concepts and these were, at first, simply translated
into Irish. For example:
Aries became An Rea or Reithe, a translation of ram (aries =
Latin for ram and so on); thus the constellation of Cancer was
known as An Portán, the crab. There being no concept of lion in
Old Irish the word used for Leo here was Cú - a large hound; while
Virgo was Oighbhean, a young girl; Capricorn became Pocán, the
goat; Sagittarius was An Saighead, an archer or soldier, and so
on.
We can perceive areas where the native and imported
concepts ran side by side for Orion was named An Selgaire Mhór
(The Great Hunter) but the Belt of Orion was called Buaile an
Bhodaigh (enclosure or belt or the enlightened).
The final linguistic process in Irish took place after Arabic
learning was introduced in the 12th Century and soon even
translations of the names were dropped in favour of a simple
Irish-ising of the foreign word. Therefore, Orion became Oirion,
Aires was Airges, followed by Leo, Saigitairius, Mercuir, Uenir,
Joib and Mars. The modern Irish astronomical vocabulary (in
terms of names of planets, constellations and so forth) is now



mainly made up of loan words just like the English
astronomical/astrological vocabulary.
During the early 20th Century, when there was a reawakening
of interest in astrology, researchers, seeing this obvious loan
word vocabulary, jumped to the wrong conclusion that there had
been no native tradition of astronomy or astrology in Ireland. Both
A.H. Allcroft (The Circle and the Cross, 2 vols, Macmillan, London,
1927) and Lewis Spence (The History and Origin of the Druids,
Rider and Co, 1949) believed there was no advanced native
traditions. The reverse was, of course, true. Indeed, as Dr Dáibhi
Ó Cróinin has already pointed out in his excellent book Early
Mediaeval Ireland 400-1200, Longman, 1995, the Irish
astronomers were doing work, which was often far more
advanced and accurate than their European counterparts. The
lists of astronomical sightings of bright stars, comets, eclipses
and so on, recorded in the annals and chronicles are more
accurate than in most other European documentation. [10]
It would be bizarre if the early Irish had been highly advanced
in astronomy at this period but did not practice astrology. The
proof comes with our first surviving Irish astrological charts
dating from the 8/9th Centuries. These are to be found in Swiss
and German libraries like many Irish literary remains of this
period. [11] As an aside, we significantly find the signs of the
zodiac carved on some of the Irish High Crosses, such as the
early 10th century cross of Muiredach at Monasterboice.
Indeed, in Old Irish there were at least seven words for an
astrologer. Rollagedagh (one who gains knowledge from the
stars), fisatóir (one who gains knowledge from the heavens) - still
found in Manx fysseree as a word for philosopher; eastrolach (one
who gains knowledge from the moon), fathach (one steeped in



prophecy) and n éladoir (one who divinates from the sky), and
réalt-eolach (one versed in astrology) and réaltóir. To be
pedantic, néladoir is argued as meaning a 'cloud diviner' but it is
glossed in a 14th Century manuscript as 'astrologer' as are all
these terms. [12]
In the Brehon Laws we find that astronomers/astrologers had to
be qualified. The degree of foirceadlaidhe was a degree of the
fifth order of wisdom, in which one had to prove their knowledge
of astronomy and astrology. The earliest word for a horoscope in
Irish occurs as nemindithibh, noted by Dr Whitley Stokes in the
Thesaurus Palaeohibernicus. Nem = heavens/sky while
nemgnacht means a studying of the heavens, perhaps our
earliest word for astrology. Indithem is an act of consideration.
For overwhelming proof that predictive astrology was practiced
in ancient Ireland one only has to turn to the innumerable
references in Irish mythological texts and what are rather
disparagingly referred to as 'pseudo' histories, that is stories of
early Irish history which fall in the scholastic mind in the grey
areas between mythology and history. Stories are full of
references of birth charts drawn up by Druids and also Christian
religious. In one text attributed to the 7th Century is there a
question asked of Cillin, which disproves the theory of some
critics that the ancient Irish merely look for omens in the clouds.
Dénamh me an leársgáil na realtai. Cen uair rathciuil agam?'
("Make me a map of the stars. What hour will be auspicious for
me?") Now the term leársgáil na realtai, a chart or map of the
stars, makes it clear what is wanted - a horoscope.
Most important is the statement given by Felim Bocht Ó
hUigiunn in the 14th Century: 'bi uair ag an impidhe na reaht
eolais '-there is always a correct moment to ask a question from



the stars (or to gain star knowledge). Any modem horary
astrologer will tell you that much.
There is an 8th Century Irish poem which endorses the idea
that the ancient Irish did not begin work on building houses until a
right moment to start had been assessed by an astrologer. One
verse says:
I have heard there was a house building
In Tuaim Inbhir
Nor is there a house more auspicious
with its stars
with its sun and its moon
To come to our most important question: it is pertinent to ask
whether anything can be salvaged of the earliest Irish astrological
traditions before the introduction of the Greco-Latin forms? It is
still early days to make definite pronouncements but initial
researches indicate that the ancient Irish, and, indeed, the
ancient Celts, were practicing a predictive form of astrology
which paralleled the early Hindu forms, that which we now called
Vedic astrology. In other words, a study of linguistic concepts and
early cosmological motifs and calendrical philosophies of both
Celtic (inclusive of Old Irish) and Sanskrit/Vedic cultures give a
path back to the common Indo-European roots of our cultures,
This is not at all surprising. Most readers will be aware of the
Indo-European hypothesis and know that, of all the European
cultures, Ireland has preserved more links with the Hindu branch
of the Indo-European culture than any other western European
people. The links between ancient Irish culture and Sanskrit/Vedic
culture have been commented on by scholars since the 19th
Century. As early as 1815 Adolphe Pictet had pointed out the links



in De l'affinite des langues celtiques avec le Sanscrit. Professor
Myles Dillon (1900-1972) was one of the leading pioneers in this
fascinating field of study, showing the commons points in
mythology, in social custom and, importantly in law. There are
many points of reference in the Law of the Sénechus or, as it is
popularly known these days, the Brehon laws and Hindu Laws.
[13] But the common link of language is obvious.
As Dr Calvert Watkins of Harvard University has pointed out:
the Celtic languages, most clearly Old Irish, represent an
extraordinarily archaic and conservative linguistic tradition within
the Indo-European tradition.... The classical Old Irish nominal and
verbal system of the eighth century of the Christian era is a far
truer reflection of the state of affairs in Indo-European than is the
Latin system of more than a thousand years before. In the
syntactic domain of word order, the structure of the archaic Old
Irish sentence can be compared only with that of the sentence in
Vedic Sanskrit or the Hittite of the Old Kingdom.' [14]
As early as 1895 Dr Heinrich Zimmer had observed
corresponding cosmological perceptions in the earliest surviving
Celtic calendar, that of Coligny, and Vedic cosmology. The final
word confirming this appears to be Dr Olmsted's detailed analysis
of the calendar. [15]
The idea that these 'signposts' might lead to the fact that
ancient Celtic astrology and Vedic astrology also had a common
link, another surviving parallel, was thrown into sharp relief by a
small gloss on a 9th Century Irish manuscript at Wurzburg. The
word budh was glossed by 'point of fire' and 'planet Mercury'.
Certainly Cormac's 10th Century Glossary (an early Irish
dictionary) explains that budh/bott' means 'Aine's fire', Aine was
an Irish deity, thought to be a moon goddess, although she



appears in a male form as well as female. If budh was a name for
Mercury then it places us close to the Vedic ball game.
Boudi and the stem budh appear in all the Celtic languages. It
means - all victorious, gift of teaching, accomplished, exulted,
virtue and so forth. In Breton today, for example, boud means 'to
be'. You will see the stem in the name Bouddica, more commonly
referred to in English as Boadicea, the Celtic warrior queen of the
Iceni who led an uprising against Roman rule in 60 AD The
important thing is that the word occurs in Sanskrit and Buddha is
the past participle of the stem budh, to know or enlightened. This
is the title given to Sakyamuni Gautama - the Enlightened One.
What is important is that in the Vedas the planet Mercury is also
known as budh.
Can the Celtic branch of Indo-European and the Sanskrit
branch of Indo-European both retain this same concept? What
other common concepts do the Celts and the Vedas have in
common when observing the night sky? I believe that this
research will eventually point the way to the earliest forms of
Celtic astronomy and astrology. The Old Irish name for the month
of July, incidentally, was Boidhmis (month of Boidh). Orion's Belt,
as previously mentioned, was BuaiIe an Bhodaigh. And Budh na
Saoghal was a term for 'world knowledge'.
But, as I stress, it is early days as yet. The research is ongoing
and I am well aware that my good friend, Professor Gearóid Mac
Eoin is currently is inclined to believe that budh in Irish is only a
'ghost word', an element deriving from bith 'world, life' often given
as findbudh and which was misidentified by Micheál Ó Cléirigh,
compiler of Foclóir no Sanasan Nua, the first published Irish
dictionary, printed in Louvain in 1643. There is still much to sort
out linguistically before we can draw the final line but these



studies are demonstrating early Irish perceptions of cosmology.
Naturally, most astrologers would doubtless like to see, as final
proof, a collection of specific early Irish, or Celtic, charts
comparable with surviving Greek horoscopes of Vattius Valens, or
Critodemus or Antigonus of Nicaea. Such charts have still to be to
be found and identified. I am not too sanguine about this. We are
lucky that the 8th/9th Century Irish charts survive in Basel. A lot
of early material was destroyed in the 17th and 18th Century
during the concentrated attempts to suppress the Irish language
and books and manuscripts. I doubt that we will find anything that
predates the medieval period. That is not to say the situation is
entirely without hope. [16]
The field of research is wide and there are, sadly, hardly any
workers in it. To give an idea of the problem, the vast wealth of
Irish language medical books are still fairly untouched by
translators or researchers. Our Knowledge of Irish mythology is
based on some 150 tales Professor Kuno Meyer and Dr Eleanor
Hull have both estimated that there are a further 400 identified
texts that had not been examined and that a further 50/100 which
could still be hidden in libraries. This should give an idea of the
enormity of the task to be undertaken in areas of Irish manuscript
research.
Texts in Continental Celtic are still being discovered. In 1993 a
bronze tablet with 200 lines of legal material in Celtic was found
in Northern Spain. So far, however, the Coligny Calendar remains
our principal text from the pre-Greco-Roman period giving
information on early Celtic cosmology.
What we can be sure of, at this time, is that the Irish (and the
Celts generally) have a long tradition of astrological learning



stretching back to a time before Christianity and the incoming of
Greek and Latin learning. We can trace the development of Irish
astrology fairly easily from the 7th Century AD, when our records
in Irish and Hiberno-Latin begin to survive. But for anything prior
to this period we must, at this time, turn to Continental Celtic
remains.
One point cannot be over stressed; that this long and rich
tradition of Celtic astrology has been sadly neglected and, albeit
perhaps unwittingly, suppressed by those who would prefer to
follow the fantasies and inventions of Robert Graves and his 'tree
zodiac'. Until recently, in an Irish and wider Celtic context, we
have not been able to see the star' for the trees!
