Abstract: The precession has its cause in the gyroscopic movement of Earth’s axis, which has an enormous influence on human temporal orientation since ancient times. This very slow movement is noticeable by several essential effects: The change of the star at the celestial pole due to the gyration of Earth’s axis and the shift of the constellations at the equinoxes and solstices, caused by the difference between the tropical and sidereal year. Usually the discovery of precession is attributed to Hipparchus, who, like Ptolemy misjudged its rate, although both had much more accurate data available. In addition, there is strong evidence that another effect of the precession, namely the difference between the tropical and sidereal year, was recognized by the Babylonian astronomer Kidinnu even before Hipparchus. Numerous descriptions of the earlier functions of polar stars and constellations as seasonal vertices have been handed down to us in myths and religious symbols. The lecture also deals with the ages and in particular with the difference between the ages caused by precession and the Platonic year, which is actually based on the Great Year of which Plato wrote and which is triggered by the course of the planets. An intriguing question is how the rate of precession was estimated by different scholars. Finally, the influence of the vernal equinox constellations on the yearly count is explained in more detail.

Introduction
Precession refers to the change in direction that the axis of rotation of a rotating body (gyroscope) performs if an external force exerts a torque perpendicular to this axis. The axis of rotation describes a revolution on the surface of an imaginary cone with a fixed cone axis. The precession is clearly shown by the table gyroscope, which does not turn over in spite of a tilted position, as long as it rotates. (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Präzession)
Especially in astronomy precession means the change of direction of the earth axis, which is a consequence of the mass attraction of the moon and the sun in connection with the deviation of the earth figure from the spherical shape. It is expressed by the progress of the vernal equinox along the ecliptic, from which the name precession (Latin for 'progress') is derived.
Seen from Earth, this motion can be detected in relation to the fixed stars. Therefore the Earth’s axis points during long periods of time to different positions of the Northern and Southern sky. It describes a circle which is called the circle of precession.
On the Northern sky there are some bright stars near this circle: our current Polaris, Alpha Ursa Minor now, but some 5.000 years ago Thuban (Alpha draconis) and some 13.000 years ago or in future Vega, main star of Lyra.
Myths tell about these celestial situations. E.g. the many primordial myths and sagas of dragons or the Indian Prince Druva. (Bhagavad Gita) This is what was announced to him: "The stars, and their figures, and also the planets shall turn around you.“ (Dechend, 1977)

In many myths the world rests on a turtle, remember that Lyra was made by Hermes from a tortoise shell, given to Apollo as a bargain.
The movement around the former Polaris was compared with a mill. The Northern direction was called therefore „SeptemTrio" after the stars of Big Dipper, which were seen like seven threshing oxen.
The cosmic machine (mill, drill, or churn) produces periods of time, it brings about the ‘separation of heaven and earth’, [...] the Mill ceases to be understood, while the memory sticks to an instrument for crushing foodstuff’(Loiodice, 2020).
On the Southern sky there is only one bright star, that could work as a polar star, some 13.000 years ago or in future again: Canopus, main star of Carina, the ship. It could be, that the myth of Noah’s Ark during the deluge is an allusion to this situation.
Due to the Earth’s gyroscopic wobble, the seasonal cardinal points, i.e. the equinoxes and solstices also shift against the fixed stars. One constellation of the ecliptic after the next moves backwards through the seasons against the annual path of the Sun. Each constellation of the zodiac, with respect to its size, serves as a marker for about 1.500 or 2.500 years. Surely this shift, which we call now precession, was observed in ancient times and found expression in cults and myths.
With the help of precession it is possible to verify the correctness of time calculations (Krojer, 2003).

The whole cycle of precession is often also called the Platonic year. This name, however, does not fit the true core, because Plato never described the precession but the so-called Great Year instead, when all planets would align again at the same places as they did at the mythic beginning of time. (Callataÿ,1996)
We need to realize that one special moment of the year is arbitral decisive for the observation of the precessional shift of the constellations causing the ages: It is the moment before dawn at day of vernal or autumnal equinox. For calendrical purposes and also for the start of the seasons, the equinoxes and in particular, the beginning of spring, seems to be the primary moment. In French, therefore, spring is called printemps (the first temporal period). We still find an echo of this numbering in the Latin names of the months, where September (seventh), October (eighth), November (ninth), and December (tenth) only make sense if the first month is March. In ancient Rome, in fact, the spring month of March was once was the first month of the year.
But the effect of precession, as Giulio Magli shows, may also have been noticed in diverse cultures by observing the rising places of special stars (Magli, 2005), (Spence, 2000).
But we want to concentrate here on the vernal equinoctial constellations.
Gemini
More than 7.000 years ago the constellation Gemini annually announced the dawn of the spring day. The myth reminds us of a starting age with Castor and Pollux the Dioscuri. The foundation of Ancient Rome reminds to the twins Romulus and Remus, nursed by a Wolf with celestial milk (Rothwangl, 2009).
Taurus
After the age of Gemini, respectively some 5.500 years ago, all vernal New Year’s days started with Taurus. The myth of Taurus and Europa was part of the Minoan culture of Crete.
Because the 4QZodiac Calendar of the Dead Sea Scrolls as a kind of world horoscope starts with the creation of the world with Taurus, it is argued that due to the precession of the equinoxes, in c. 4,000 BCE., the sun would have been at the beginning in Taurus at the vernal equinox. (Jacobus. 2014)
In Egyptian Memphis, a parallel of the Taurus cult is known as the Apis cult. The holy Apis bulls were used for ceremonies and buried in special tombs.
Aries
The next age and heliacal equinox constellation was Aries and some myths tell us about the transition from Taurus to Aries. For example the most famous legend about Theseus is his slaying of the Minotaur, seem to signal the end of the age of Taurus. Another motif is Mithras and the slaughter of the bull.
The bible tells of the forbidden worship of the golden calf, which was destroyed by Moses, who wear horns of a ram. The Argonauts were searching for the Golden Fleece, the skin of ram. In Egypt, Amun, the God with horns of a ram was adored.

There exist a great the number of ancient Greek statues of Hermes Kriophoros (Ram-Bearer), which suspect the fact that the constellation of Aries, with the point of vernal equinox, at that time was the sign of the beginning of the new cycle of life – the beginning of spring. (Theodossiou. 2012)
Pisces
The crucified lamb at the beginning of the age of Pisces is a parallel of the bull sacrifice at the transition from the age of Taurus to Aries.
At the beginning of the Christianity the constellation Aries was already vanished through the morning Sun at vernal equinox. This was the signal of the ending of the age of Aries and the beginning of Pisces.
The sacrificed lamb was a symbol for Jesus, as well as Ichthys, the Latinized Greek word for fish, meaning the vernal heliacal rising constellation Pisces. It was the symbol adopted by early Christians as their sign for the new age and religion.
Aquarius
If one looks at present in the spring morning before sunrise to the East so one sees hardly any star of the constellation Pisces, but already the constellation Aquarius.
There exist also allusions for Aquarius as the next age in the Gospel:
The Gospel of Luke 22: 8-10 tells of Jesus, who gave advice where to celebrate Passover in future: at the house of the man bearing a pitcher of water.
Yet the most prominent forecast is found in the revelation of John of Patmos.

Here a quote of Franz Boll (1867-1924):
“After many up to this date found parallels of the apocalyptic world of imagination compared with astrological texts one has to expect that in the Apocalypse the starry sky and its figures must have an extraordinary meaning”. (Boll.1914)
There are so many apocalyptic allusions for the Christian end-time, which would come at the end of the age of Pisces that I present only a few:
Famous is the Beast stepping out of the Sea, a major topic called also the Antichrist, and the number 666, mentioned in Rev 13:1-6.
We can easily identify this Beast as LEO, the constellation opposite Aquarius, which now at spring equinox at morning is setting in the west and at autumn equinox is rising in the East before dawn.
But let us now discuss the rate of the precession.
The term precession originates from Hipparchus (about 150 BCE). He has determined the rate on the basis of a shift of the star Spica against the autumnal equinox by 2 degrees since Timocharis (150 years before him). He should have found even with his own observations the value of 75 years for 1 degree, but he assumed 100 years each 1 degree, which results in 3000 years for 30 degrees. Ptolemy (100 - 160 CE) measured again the distance of Spica to autumn equinox with similar result as Hipparchos. (Manitius, 1912) Many other Western astronomers have used this value up to Johannes Sacrobosco (1195-1256). Only Kepler (1571-1630) determined the rate with 72 years for 1 degree more precisely.
We should notice here that Spica, brightest star close to the ecliptic, is the main star of Virgo and was called in Latin „spica virginis“, the virgin's ear of grain, or arista. Thus also aristocracy and the term era may derive from it. Also
the narrative ‘born from a virgin’ becomes a different meaning if considered in precessional terms.
Yet even before Hipparchos the precession seem to be noted by Aristarchos (3rd cent. BCE) , who calculated the sidereal year, whose duration he presented in the continued-fraction technique. Its difference to the tropical year results almost in 1 degree in 100 years. It can be assumed that Hipparchos and Ptolemy used his data. Another notion of precession some 150 years before Hipparchos derives from the Babylonian astronomer Kidinnu (in Greek Kidenas). (Rawlins, 1999). He also realized the difference of tropical and sidereal year but his result concerning the precession is only 50 years each 1 degree, thus twice as fast as Hipparchos’. This calculation would result in the number of 18.000 years for the whole precessional cycle, or 1.500 each 30 degree.
Aetios (c.100 CE, doxographer and eclectic philosopher) made an interesting comment that the Great year would last 18.000 years:
“The Great Year comes into existence if all (planets) arrive again in the same place from where their movements started ... according to Herakleitos, the Great Year consists of 18.000 years”.
Here we have a citation which presumable caused the great confusion, concerning the Great Year, which means the period between alignments of all classical planets and the Platonic year, which some people falsely call the entire cycle of precession of about 25.800 years.
There were however a number of ancient and medieval astronomers, who did not use Ptolemy’s too "slow“ value of 3.000 years each 30 degree nor the too fast value of 1.500 years each 30 degree, but used a moderate middle value of 2.000 years each 30 degree, resulting in 66 years each 1 degree or 666 years each 10 degrees, which would be the rate of precession for one decan (10 degrees) and is also the ominous number of the revelation of John of Patmos. The stars of the decans were the base of so many decan calendars and were used to measure time in this way: “Ten days later one decan has emerged from the underworld and one has disappeared. All the decans have then moved one place on the series” (Waerden, 1974).
Every about 600 to 700 years, the decan stars lost their significance regarding the seasons due to the precession and so these calendars expired.
Many assertions exist that also in ancient India this value was in use (Galaisière, 1773) (Pingree, 1972) (Hartner,1979) (Bennedik, 2007).
In the fourth century CE, Theon of Alexandria assumed a changing rate (trepidation) of 66 years each 1 degree. (Gessner, 2021) Many Arabic and Persian astronomers used later this value.

Paul Kunitzsch) Libros del Saber of Alfons of Castillia (1252-1284) − Judah ben Verga of Lissabon (c. 1470)
The effect of this value of precession upon calendars is still manifest in the Anno Domini years. This yearly count was invented by Dionysius Exiguus some 1.500 years ago. As a Christian monk he was surely influenced by end of the world fever, because at his lifetime the year of the world 6000 occurred, which counted since the fictitious creation of the world. Dionysius dated Christ’s incarnation on the former day of vernal equinox (25th March). He dated anno Domini after forecasting the planetary massing some 1.500 years in the future, which marked for Dionysius the end of the world at the end of the Piscean age. Using the value of 2.000 years each 30° he backdated from this planetary massing his "anni ab incarnatione domini Iesu Christi“. This had the effect that in May 2000 a rare planetary massing occurred (Rothwangl, 2016).
Conclusion
We should be aware that precession influence our current yearly count, which is based upon an outdated astronomical dogma and a wrong precessional rate of 2.000 years each 30° with the result that a planetary massing, marking a Platonic year occurring in May 2000 occurred. How much doctrines like the Great Year or the precessional ages also influence today's politics, respectively how politics uses such doctrines, shall be shown by two recent examples which are hardly based on pure coincidence: The inauguration of the Russian president Vladimir Putin took place on 7th May shortly after May 5, 2000. During the victory celebrations of the new American president Barack Obama the TV news showed posters with the inscription: DAWN OF NEW WORLD. These images were followed by an excerpt from the musical Hair with the song lyrics: "This is the Dawning of the age Aquarius ..." (Rothwangl 2022)
The end of the Christian Age of Pisces and the dawn of a new age through precession brings a new ‘weltanschauung’ based on current science. This brings new paradigms that, on the one hand, it reduces old dogmas to absurdity, makes it ridiculous and satirise them, but on the other hand also make it clear that myth was the science of the past. Our recent situation is summed up by Anthony Aveni (born 1938) when he says: "What is current mythology we call science.” (Aveni. 1992)
A todays example of this satire is the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM), the deity of a religious parody invented
by the US physicist and author Bobby Henderson. This gave rise to the cult of Pastafarianism, a social movement that promotes a light-hearted view of religion. It originated in opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools and can be seen as allusion of the end of the Piscean Age as well as the start of the Aquarian age. According to the Austrian ordinance, only religious headgear is allowed on public documents. Against the religious ordinance Niko Alm, former member of the National Council in Austria enforced that he was allowed to wear a pasta strainer on the photo of his driver's license. (APA, 2011)
In the meantime, even a German man named Sebastian has managed to wear a Fishbone Bandana in his German identity card. It symbolizes that from the fish (ICHTHYS) only a skeleton is left. (Spaghettus, 2021)
This is clearly a spiritual sign of the time (zeitgeist) for the ending Piscean Age, just as once the sacrificial lamb was a symbol of the ending Age of Aries (Aries), or before the motifs of the bull sacrifice by Theseus, Mithras and Moses at the end of the Age of Taurus.
It can be certainly considered that the perception of the shift of the constellations against the equinoxes and solstices due to precession found its way into the cultures and cults and acts as a time-giving factor such as all other movements of the Earth and other celestial bodies in the consciousness of mankind.
