Note on the illustrations
T he great majority of the drawings in this book have been rendered at a standard scale, viz:
0 12 INCHES 2 FEET
u 1 1 1 1 \1 i.l 1 1 1______________ 1
0 30 CM 60CM

In some instances, a smaller scale has been used (indicated by the symbol • • ):
0 1 2 FEET 0 30 60 CM
1 ----- 1------- 1 i-------1------- 1
T he symbol ( • ) indicates that the drawing is not rendered to scale. Emphasis has been placed on an accurate rendering of the engravings on the stones. The intention is to produce a documentation of the actual signs and symbols carved by the artists. I have usually shown an outline of the stone and used shading to indicate its shape and form, but primary consideration is directed towards depicting the engraved art. The renditions are based on rubbings, photographs and drawings taken at the actual sites and then compared in the studio to produce a final drawing. For the most part, the engravings are remarkably well preserved con sidering that they were done about $,000 years ago. At the Loughcrew sites there are special problems in rendering the stones, because the engravings appear to be older than those in the Boyne Valley, inferior techniques are used on an inferior quality stone, and they have suf fered far more from weathering. Cairns T and L, as the focal mounds in the Loughcrew complex, contain the most engravings, and fortunately both these sites are roofed. The satellite mounds are completely exposed, and it is here that discrepancies are likely to arise. I have rendered the art at these subsidiary sites by consulting the early illustrations done by Du Noyer and early photographs, as well as the present archaeological evidence. Nevertheless, these drawings must be treated with caution, and the details are not always reliable. I have drawn conclusions from these stones only in cases where the existing evidence is substan tial, or where my own renderings agree with documentation done by other researchers.

Part I
IN T R O D U C T IO N
The River Boyne takes a spiral course as it meanders up from the plains of Kildare, winds its way through Meath and takes a curious bend before emptying into the Irish Sea. The bend in the river encloses a picturesque area dominated by three large stone structures known as megalithic mounds and named Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth. These are strategi cally positioned on ridges, appearing above a landscape dotted with smaller mounds, earthworks and standing stones. The Boyne Valley complex continues to be an imposing and impressive feature of the landscape today, as it was when erected over five thousand years ago during the age of stone. It belongs to the Neolithic period and its major structures were completed sometime between 3200 and 3700 b c according to radiocarbon dating. This places the mounds among the world’s oldest remaining buildings. Another striking feature has only recently become known. One of the mounds in the complex, Newgrange, was found to be aligned to the position of the rising sun at winter solstice, the shortest day of the year. The earliest reports of this event were not taken seriously, but in time the evidence proved overwhelming Newgrange was a large-scale solar construct, intentionally designed and of a type previously unknown. The recognition that the long passage within the mound at Newgrange admitted a narrow beam of light illuminating the central chamber at midwinter added an entirely new dimension to Boyne Valley studies. There was no doubt that the light made its appearance every year in spectacular fashion, but how could this discovery be reconciled with conventional archaeological theories regarding the purpose of the mound? Newgrange was - and still is - considered to be a giant tomb, yet the new information tended to support the alternative theory that such megalithic structures were designed for astronomical purposes. M y own field of research involves yet another intriguing feature of the mounds. The complex of sites in the Boyne Valley contains, painstakingly engraved in the chambers and passages and on the kerbstones surrounding the mounds, perhaps the largest accumulation of Neolithic art in the world. M y main long-term project was, if possible, to explain the meaning and purpose of this vast collection of enigmatic abstract art. By the end of 1979, after ten years of research, I had already come to some preliminary conclusions. The alignment of Newgrange to the midwinter sun was evidently a major feature, central to the concept of the mound. I also concluded that the art contained in the mound must directly or indirectly
7



relate to this central feature. I f this relationship between the mound and its art was correct, it would imply that similar mounds containing similar art would also feature astronomical alignments. From the very beginning I could not regard Newgrange as a unique solar construct. Its size and use of complex techniques suggested that there must have been preliminary models upon which the scheme had been based. I was also aware that unless comparable Neolithic devices could be found elsewhere, very little could be determined about the precision with which Newgrange had been laid out, or whether or not it represented a systematic method of time reckoning. The line of enquiry I was pursuing could be verified only by systematic field research embracing all the major mounds in the Boyne Valley. In order to help eliminate possibilities of coincidence, another large complex of mounds situated in the Loughcrew Mountains would also have to be investigated. The Loughcrew complex is second only to that of the Boyne Valley in its size and in the quantity of megalithic art it contains. Together the two complexes provide the great majority of all megalithic art in Ireland. Eventually the project would expand to include most of the Irish sites containing megalithic art.

The mysteries of the art could be explained only in terms of the mysteries o f the mounds themselves, especially the way they interacted with light. The original art research project was therefore expanded to include an archaeo-astronomical investigation. Although I had failed to interest archaeologists in my ideas, a fellow artist and amateur astronomer, Jack Roberts, saw a certain logic in my reasoning and was keen to test my ideas in the field. Our field research began in late 1979 at Newgrange, where we observed the midwinter sunrise, and ended one year later in the chamber of nearby Dowth, where the rays o f the setting sun projected a beam of light at winter solstice. During 1980 we had made comparable solar observations at over thirteen megalithic sites. We gradually came to realize that the mounds were indeed accurate sun chronometers whose structures are a celebration of light and measurement. We also discovered a clear and distinct link between megalithic art and the astronomical events that animate megalith ic structures, giving them meaning and function. The story of our discoveries is the subject of this book. But many researchers before us had, in varying degrees, anticipated or at least suspected an astronomical significance, both in the alignments of the mounds and in the signs and symbols that make up megalithic art: their story should also be told. Even before these comparatively modern visitors, however, Celtic history and tradition alike echo the high prestige of the mounds. Locked away in Gaelic manuscript and lore are fragments of evidence which show that these mounds have captured the imagination and admiration of generations o f peoples, extending down through ages of time.

The lords of light
Megalithic mounds in ancient Ireland
Newgrange casts its long shadows over a mist of legend and myth through which we can perceive only glimpses of a real place in the moving billows of fable and fantasy. The mound first appears in the very earliest Irish prose stories which belong to a group known as the Mythological Cycle. Although what survives of these tales is contained in a few large manuscripts written in medieval times, the origin of the cycle is far more ancient. The Mythological Cycle concerns the Tuatha Dé Danann, the earliest known native Irish gods disguised as a supernatural race of wizards and magicians, who descended from the sky and inhabited Ireland before the coming of the Celts. They have been referred to as ‘The Lords of Light’ , and when Newgrange is first encountered in literature, it is they who dwell in the mound. The Newgrange of mythology is a magnificent otherworld palace or festive hall, existing in an eternal timeless realm of the supernatural and not as a place of human habitation. It is the domain of gods, a place of perpetual festivities and a wonderful ‘land’ where no one ever dies. Such a location is described as a Brit in the ancient literature, and the Brú na Bóinne, or Newgrange, is the most famous of these magical sites. It contained three fruit-trees which were always in fruit, and an inexhaustible cauldron from which no company went away unsatisfied. ‘Three times fifty sons of Kings’ dwelt there, in this mysterious world of the Celtic imagination. Very little is known about the first occupant of the ‘wonder-hill’ except that his name was Elcmar and that he was married to Boand, the divinized personification of the river Boyne. In mythology the Boyne itself has magical and mystical attributes, and its source is described as being the well of Segais, an Otherworld Well regarded as the origin of all wisdom and occult knowledge. This well is surrounded by hazel trees whose nuts drop into its waters, forming na bolcca immaiss or ‘bubbles of mystic inspiration’ . Either once a year, or once in seven years, these pass into the river Boyne. The river is closely associated with the mound, which is sometimes called Brú mná Elcmair, or ‘the Brit of the woman of Elcmar’, who is known to be Boand or the Boyne. A great deal is known about the next proprietor of the Brú, none other than the all-powerful and omniscient Dagda, the most prominent of the older native Irish gods. His name means ‘the good god’ . He is considered to be a god of wisdom and is also called Ruad Ro-fhessa, ‘The Lord of Great Knowledge’ . Some scholars see in him an atmospheric god, others regard him as a sky-god. In his book, Early Irish History and Mythology
io



The beam of light entering Nezvgrange on zuinter solstice sunrise.
(1946), T . F. O’ Rahilly states that the question of the Dagda’ s identity is fully answered if we say that he was the god of the sun. There is a striking connection here between the mythological sun-god dwelling in a super natural residence and an actual Neolithic archaeological site that was constructed to admit the rays of the rising sun annually. The Dagda gains possession of Brú na Bóinne and achieves carnal union with Boand by the use of a magical trick which utilizes his mastery over time. He sends Elcmar on an errand for one day which really becomes a period of nine months. During this time Óengus is conceived and born. He is called Mac ind ,cÓor ‘the Youthful Son’ , by his mother who says: ‘Y oung is the son who was begotten at break of day and born betwixt it and



evening.’ Óengus is regarded as a personification of the day, and it is curious that his birth takes place during a magical lengthening of the day at Newgrange. The entrance of the sun’s rays into the chamber of Newgrange occurs at winter solstice and therefore marks the beginning of the actual lengthening of the days in the sun’s yearly cycle. The most widely used name for Newgrange in the ancient literature is Brú Mac ind Óc, or the Brú of Óengus. Óengus later approaches the Dagda requesting a mound of his own. When the Dagda says, ‘ I have none for thee’, Óengus replies, ‘Thou let me be granted a day and a night in thy own dwelling.’ When the Dagda informs him, ‘thou hast consumed thy time’, Óengus says, ‘ It is clear that night and day are the whole world, and it is that which has been given to me.’ From then on it is Óengus who has possession of the mound, and this association is retained down through the various cycles of the ancient literature. Some poems invented by Christian scribes were evidently intended to remove from the popular mind the persistent belief that the Tuatha Dé Danann were immortal. The poems describe the death that befell each of the best-known gods, and the mounds are usually presented as their burial places. Thus, in a poem by Flann Mainistrech dated 1056, we find that Óengus met his end by drowning in the Boyne, yet an entry in Tigernach’s Annals from the year 1084 assures us that Óengus is alive and well in his Brú. In ancient Ireland the introduction of Christianity was directly opposed by the worship of Coll (or Goll), the great orb of the heavens. The earliest documentary allusion to the worship of the sun comes from fifth-century Ireland and occurs in St Patrick’ s Confessio-, wherein he warns, ‘The splendour of the material sun, which rises every day at the bidding of God, will pass away, and those who worship it will go into dire punishment.’ It is easy to see from this and the above discrepancies that, even if the rising sun’s triumphant entry into Newgrange was evident in ancient times, it would not have been in the interests of the Christian scribes, who recorded the literature, to make the event known. The two other major mounds in the Boyne Valley, Knowth and Dowth, appear in the ancient literature as Cnogba and Dubad. Here again, we can detect the presence of the sun, but only through a haze of magic and wizardry. References to Knowth and Dowth occur in the Dindshenchas, a collection of lore that attempts to explain the hills and other features of the Irish landscape including the mounds. The collection contains a great deal of artificial learning and pseudo-history as well as fragments of genuine traditional mythology. Knowth is connected with Englec who is the daughter of Elcmar and the lover of Óengus Mac ind Óc and thereby associated with Newgrange. The Dowth legend has the Druid Bresal attempting to build a tower that would reach to heaven. This part is clearly based on a biblical motif, however the incidents which follow seem to relate to the Newgrange legend and reflect native Irish sources. For a single day, Bresal has contracted the men of Erin to work on the building. His sister works a druidic spell so that the sun might not set until the mound is built. Bresal commits incest with her,
12



interrupting the magic and causing the sun to set. ‘Night came upon them then’ , and Bresal’ s sister declares, ‘Dubad [or darkness] shall be the name of that place forever.’ And so it is today, but stranger still, one of the two chambers inside Dowth is illuminated by the setting sun at winter solstice marking the longest night of the year. This association of light and darkness with the actual structure of the mound is still reflected in the place-name. It is clear from the earliest mythology surrounding the mounds that they were never considered to be graves but, on the contrary, were regarded as abodes of living gods conceived and born there. The mounds were places of importance wherein resided the chief and prominent gods of the pantheon. In a later group of tales, known as the Ulster cycle, the Boyne Valley monuments make another appearance, and here again they are not graves and are regarded as places of considerable importance. The Táin Bó Cuailnge, the centrepiece of the Ulster cycle, is the oldest vernacular epic in Western literature. It describes the exploits of the warrior hero Cúchulainn in the kind of culture that existed in Iron Age Ireland. In these tales the Brú on the Boyne again features in a wonderbirth of a hero. The setting is typically imaginative and magical. In the events immediately preceding the birth of Cúchulainn the nobles of Ireland with nine chariots chase a flock of wonderful birds, nine score of them, each couple linked by a silver chain. Toward nightfall three birds separate out from the rest. The men of Ulster press on until they reach the Brú on the Boyne where night overtakes them. These incidents open the tale called ‘How Cúchulainn Was Begotten’ . Later in the Táin, while Cúchulainn is on a kind of tour of the country connected with his initiation as a warrior, his charioteer, I bar, points out all the places of Ulster around him. ‘He pointed out the plains and strongholds and renowned places of the province. “ Well now, Ibar,” said Cúchulainn, “ what plain is that to the south of us which is full of retreats and corners and nooks and glens?” “ That is M ag Breg,” said Ibar. “ Show me the buildings and high places of that plain.” The driver showed him Tem air and Tailtiu, Cleitech and Cnogba and Brug Meic in Óc and the fortress of the sons of Nechta Scéne.’ Some of these places can be identified as megalithic mounds. Temair is Tara, Cnogba, as we have seen, is Knowth, which is here clearly distinguished from Brug Meic in Óc (Newgrange). The term applied to these sites in the text is the déntai ocus dindgnai, which means ‘the buildings and high places’ and does not imply any idea of a burial place. Completely different terms are used for burial places in the Táin. In another tale, Cúchulainn journeys between Tara and the north, passing between Newgrange (described as ‘the Hill of Sid in Broga, in which is Óengus’ ) and Dowth (called ‘ Sid Bresail, the druid’ ). The term Sid has similar connotations as the term Brú, referring to the magical dwelling places of living gods. Oengus reappears in connection with Newgrange in the Fenian cycle, which was the latest to take shape as a separate tradition in the literature. Finn, the warrior hero of these tales, describes the mound as the house of
13



Óengus of the Brú which cannot be burned or destroyed as long as Óengus is alive. This ‘description’ is in a tale called ‘The Fort of the Rowan T ree’ . Another tale in which Newgrange figures is the famous love story of Diarmaid and Grainne known in the tenth century. Upon Diarmaid’ s death, for which Finn is partly responsible, Finn says, ‘ Let us leave this tulach for fear that Óengus and the Tuatha Dé Danann may catch us.’ Óengus then brings Diarmaid to Newgrange in order to ‘put an aerial life into him so that he will talk to me every day’ . However strange and mysterious these later tales may be, it is here at last that we finally have literary evidence of a possible burial site. In the context of a tomb, Newgrange appears among the tales relating to the kings of Tara. Newgrange is referred to as a ‘cemetery of idolators’ and Cormac mac Airt, as a Christian king, refuses to be buried there. When the body is being taken across the Boyne the river swells up three times so that Cormac attains his wish and is buried south of the Boyne. There seems to be a tradition that the kings of Tara were buried at Newgrange, but this concept is absent from the earlier literature. Neither is it consistent in the later literature. In the ‘Colloquy with the Ancients’ from a fifteenthcentury manuscript, one of the Tuatha Dé Danann resident at Newgrange is asked where he comes from. His reply is, ‘Out of yonder Brú chequered with the many lights.’ This is more in keeping with the mythological concept of Newgrange. In ancient Irish literature and place-names there are a number of astronomical references concerning the site of Tara. In view of this, it is interesting that the remains of what was once the Hall of Tara seem to be in alignment with the megalithic mound north-south, marking the position of the midday sun. There is a very curious tale in one of the ancient Irish manuscripts concerning Conn, a High King, and the Rí Ráith (Royal Fortress) at Tara which encompasses the megalithic mound. The manu script is entitled ‘The Magical Stone of T ara’, and it states: ‘one evening Conn of the Hundred Battles repaired at sunrise to the Ri Ráith at Tara, accompanied by his three Druids, Mael, Bloc and Bluicné, and his three poets, Ethain, Corb and Cesare; for he was accustomed every day to repair to this place with the same company, for the purpose of watching the stars, that no hostile aerial beings should descend upon Ireland unknown to him. While standing in the usual place this morning, Conn happened to tread on a stone, and immediately the stone shrieked under his feet so as to be heard all over Tara and throughout all East Meath. Conn then asked the Druids why the stone had shrieked, what its name was, and what it said. The Druids took 53 days to consider, and returned the following answer: Fal [destiny] is the name of the stone; it came from the Island of Fal. . . .’ The story continues to describe the fantastic properties of this stone, which is called the Lia Fal, or ‘ Stone of Destiny’ . What is startling about the story is that the stone remains within the enclosure of the Ri Ráith today, although it has been moved 400 feet from its original site beside the megalithic mound. Apparently Conn is visiting the megalithic mound at sunrise in order to make astronomical observations of some kind, even
14



though his interest is in ‘hostile aerial beings’ . Although the story contains much of the marvellous and miraculous imagery typical of ancient Irish literature, as in all these tales, there is a real element of fact. Continuous sunrise observations at the megalithic mound would reveal that the chamber is brilliantly illuminated at the time of the two important Celtic festivals, Samhain in the early part of November and Imbolc in early February at the beginning of spring. Both of these festivals have in fact been associated with Tara, Samhain being the major one. In ancient Celtic Ireland the year was divided into two periods of six months, a bright half and a dark half known as Samh, summer, and Gamh, winter. This is evident in the Brehon Laws, the ancient codes governing the country. The bright half began in early M ay on the feast of Beltine or ‘the Sun’s Fire’ . Winter commenced early in November on the feast of Samhain, which probably means ‘summer’s end’ . Other sources indicate that each of these periods was further subdivided by the feast of Imbolc or ‘the budding’ early in February, and by Lugnasad or ‘the Feast of Lu g’ , a solar god, early in August. It is remarkable that these feasts correspond closely to the solar alignments of megalithic mounds, where Samhain, the greatest feast of the Celtic calendar and probably a harvest festival, is of particular importance. In another ancient Irish manuscript, the Senchus Mor, we learn that seven divisions of the firmament above the earth were recognized, consisting of the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, M ars, Jupiter and Saturn. About the stars they believed, ‘as a shell is about an egg, the firmament is around the earth’ . They believed that twelve constellations represented the year and that the sun ‘runs through one each month’ . In the ancient Welsh annals, the ‘Triads of the Island of Britain’ maintain that on the megalithic stones of Gwidden-Ganhebon, ‘one could read the arts and sciences of the world’ . They also tell us of ‘the astronomer Gwydon -ap Don’ , who was buried ‘under a Stone of Enigmas’ . This Stone of Enigmas is no doubt an engraved stone. Ancient Irish festivals were known as an Aonach, a cycle of the sun numbering 365 days. Baal or Bel is another name for the sun and forms part of many place-names, including Bel-ain, which means ‘Bel’s ring’ or ‘the sun’ s circuit’ . The festival of Lucaid-Lamh-Fada was known as a festival of love held in honour of the sun and moon. This was equivalent to Lugnasad, which marked the cross-quarter day early in August. The connection between the sun and moon, place-names and megalithic sites was recognized very early. In 1 8 1 1 , the Reverend F. Leman spoke of an inscription upon a stone at T o ry Hill, Kilkenny which was written in Old Irish characters and read Sleigh-Grian or ‘the Hill of the Sun’ . He said: ‘Within view of this hill, towards the west, on the borders of Tipperary, rises the more elevated mountain of Sleigh-Na-Man, which from its name, was probably consecrated to the moon.’ A contemporary, D r Kenealy, stated, ‘The Druidical temple called Ana-Mor was com posed of 48 stones, denoting the numbers of the old constellations, with a kebla of nine stones near the circumference, on the inside, to represent the
15



sun in its progress through the signs.’ Many early antiquaries had in fact recognized connections between the megalithic monuments and as tronomy, but they were never taken seriously. Nor did they themselves follow up the clues by making astronomical observations at the sites. The poem called ‘The Mystery of Amergin’, although its date is unknown, has from ancient times been represented as the first poem made in Ireland. Amergin was a Druid, and his verses are considered incan tations rather than poems. The structuring in the incantation is extremely archaic, and there has been much argument about the translation of many of the lines. The incantation consists of twenty lines, the first fourteen of which are a series of declarations,
I am wind on sea, I am ocean wave,
by the sixth line he declares,
I am a beam of the sun.
By the fifteenth line the incantation changes into a series of questions or riddles, which begin,
Who is he who announces the ages of the moon? Who teaches the place where falls the sunset?
These references to the sun and moon are followed by two lines which refer to the stars. In the incantation the phrase for the stars used is buar Tethrach, which literally means ‘the cattle of Tethrys’ , but is translated by R. A. S. Macalister as ‘the stars rising out of the sea’ . Macalister’s translation of the incantation is generally recognized as the most authori tative. Literally the lines read,
Who calleth cattle from the House of Tethys? On whom do the cattle of Tethys smile?
The end of the incantation follows this line and questions the first line and the incantation itself with,
Enchantments of wind?
The entire set of questions which form the last part of the incantation in one way or another are concerned with the heavens. Although the incantation is referred to as a mystery, the identification with aspects of the sun and moon is explicit in the very earliest written documents. The incantation in its entirety is mysterious and bewildering, but there is running through it a number of interconnected lines expressing ideas that are related to megalithic mounds. There is a wealth of information concerning Celtic sun symbolism in ancient Irish manuscripts, and it is possible that, although these symbols are natural and universal, they could have been derived directly from the Neolithic tradition of symbol usage. In his book, Early Irish History and Mythology, Thomas O’ Rahilly deals with the emblem of the sun as a circle
16



or ring. He explains that the Modern Irish term for dawn, an lae, literally means ‘the ring of light on the sky-line at day-break’, and he traces the symbol back to the most ancient literature. He states that, ‘One of the attributes of the sun-god was the healing of disease, and in this belief we have one of the reasons of the importance attached in ancient times to the wearing of rings or other solar emblems, which were primarily amulets and only secondarily ornaments. Sometimes the ring became a miniature wheel, and thus suggested not only the shape of the sun but also its motion. Hence we find the word roth,“ wheel” , applied to a kind of circular bro The sun itself was the great celestial wheel; compare the sun, like Lucretius’ solis rota. So we find God referred to not only as ard-Ri grene, “ supreme King of the Sun” , but also as ard-Ruiri ind roith, “ supreme King of the wheel” which means just the same thing.’ Although it is possible to recognize a connection between Celtic symbols and decorative motifs, and symbolism developed by the megalith builders, the link is tenuous. The Celts never adopted a systematic use of the symbols and in all probability they were not aware of the depth of their meanings. The megalithic mounds were already very ancient when Celtic civilization emerged in Ireland. Nevertheless the frequent appearance and importance of the mounds in mythology, their continual presence throughout the various cycles of literature and the association of royal sites of the proto-historic and historic periods with the Neolithic mounds is a remarkable legacy, through which we can detect fleeting glimpses of the sun in a mysterious Celtic twilight.
Newgrange before reconstruction.



The caves of the sun
Megalithic mounds in eighteenth-century
antiquarian literature
By the time the entrance to Newgrange was discovered in 1699, the mound had plunged from fame and splendour in the old Gaelic world into almost total obscurity. By 114 2, the fabulous Brú na Bóinne had become part of outlying farmland in the possession of the Cistercian Abbey of Mellifont. These farms were known as ‘granges’ , and by 1378 the mound had been completely stripped of its former identity and was called merely ‘the new grange’ . Complex historical circumstances leading to the Williamite confiscations brought a further change of ownership, and in 1688 Charles Campbell became the landowner of Newgrange as a grantee of estates forfeited. T o Campbell the mound was a convenient source of stones that were ideal for use in roads and fences. During the summer of 1699 his servants were busy casting away stones from the base of the mound when they came across the engraved spirals of the entrance stone. Further digging revealed an opening to a long narrow passage which was still relatively intact and led to the large chamber. The landowner, who was apparently the second person to enter the chamber, notified Dublin of the strange curiosity found on his land. Soon after, Edward Lhuyd, the Welsh

antiquary, naturalist and philologist, came to investigate, and he is thus credited with the ‘discovery’ of Newgrange. Lhuyd’s visit was followed by a succession of visits by well-known antiquarians who tried to explain the origins of the‘barbarous monument’ on the Boyne. Tw o basic ideas predominated. For the most part the very earliest megalithic researchers could not conceive that the monuments were indigenous constructions of the native Irish. They considered all the large engineering projects in Ireland to have been the work of Danes or other colonists. Secondly, the supposed presence of two skeletons in the chamber of Newgrange led Lhuyd to conclude that ‘it must certainly have been the Sepulchre or burying of some person of note who had his wife interred with him’ . Similar finds in other mounds reinforced the tomb theory, although there was no evidence to show that these deposits were contemporary with the original construction. Both these ideas, although modified and elaborated upon considerably, were to form the basis of archaeological thought right up to our own time. One of Lhuyd’ s most interesting observations was made by interview ing a local man named Cormac O’ Neil about the folklore concerning the mounds. Lhuyd states that he was told a ‘vulgar legend about some strange operation that took place in the time of Heathenism’ . The legend was later identified by Roderick O’ Flaherty as being none other than the expulsion of Elcmar from Brú na Bóinne and the wonder tales of Aonghus. This means that, regardless of the tremendous social and political upheavals of the previous centuries, the people had preserved some of the old traditions and enshrined them in local folklore. If local tradition had been taken more
19



seriously the mound could have been linked with the fabulous Brú of ancient mythology. Instead, it was going to take over a hundred years before this was fully realized. It was not only the tomb theory and the idea that the mounds were built by invading colonists that had their origins with the early antiquarians; the foundations for an astronomical explanation of the mounds were also established at this period. Although the astronomical explanation was quickly dismissed and long ridiculed, it has recently been found applicable to other megalithic sites in Europe. However, when Jack Roberts and I first became interested in the astronomical features of the Irish mounds, we found that very little research had been done. We had to start from the beginning, almost as pioneers; and thus we became attracted to the works of the real pioneer of our subject, the originator of the astronomical interpretation of Newgrange, General Charles Vallancey. Vallancey came to Ireland in 1750 as a British army officer of the Engineers in the Tenth Regiment of Foot. He was a professional surveyor, and made notable contributions to the science and art of military mapping. His maps of Ireland are recognized as noteworthy achievements, but Vallancey was energetic in all things. Cartography, engineering and
V a l l a n c e y ’sdrawings and ground plans of Ne legrange are vastly superior to anything else done in the eighteenth century. It is intriguing that the standing stones depicted surrounding the mound can alt be identified except fo r the triangular stone of the entrance. 20

physical geography were some of his many scientific interests. As a linguist his attempts to derive the Irish language from Phoenician and other Oriental sources were a failure, but modern scholars have given him the sympathy due to an amateur of Celtic studies living in a time of general indifference towards the subject. He studied ancient Irish astronomical tracts and was able to comment intelligently in the Irish language on manuscripts dating from the fourteenth century. He sometimes signed his comments with his name in Irish, Cathal Uabhallansi. Vallancey’ s astronomical explanations of the megalithic mounds were very soon forgotten and, if he is mentioned at all by modern archaeologists, he is invariably ridiculed. A favourite target for criticism is his interpre tation of Newgrange and other sites as Antra Mithrae or ‘Caves of the Sun’ . He observed that ‘ Several of these Antra Mithrae exist in Ireland and Britain at this day: They are of wonderful construction.’ He also considered Stonehenge to be a temple of the sun, and a number of Irish standing stones and stone circles were explained as sun stones or stones set up to mark the cycles of the sun, moon and planets. Antra is taken by Vallancey to mean a cave, and he derives Mithrae from an Irish name for the sun or rays of the sun. Regardless of how these interpretations were



arrived at, Vallancey anticipated the modern realization that Newgrange is orientated with reference to the rays of the sun. This is one of the reasons why I consider Vallancey to be the most important of the Irish antiquarians. Many of his insights are now being substantiated by current research. Vallancey came so close to penetrating the facts about the astronomical features of Newgrange that it would be interesting to know his exact sources. By the early 1770s he was spending most of his time in Dublin, devoting himself to the problem of the megalithic mounds and other antiquarian pursuits. He had already begun ‘to publish every thing of this kind he had notic’d in Ireland’ , and his researches came out over the years 1782-1806 in his monumental work, Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicus. In the pages of these volumes he appealed for information from his readers in questionnaires called ‘Queries recommended to the curious’ . A typical enquiry is, ‘Are there any Raths, Irish or Danish or other pieces of antiquity remaining in your parish; what are they, and what traditions are there, or historical accounts of them? add a drawing if you can.’ Vallancey is today criticized for attributing the construction of the mounds to the Druids. Although we now know that Newgrange was built thousands of years before Druids were heard of in Ireland, it is not appreciated that Vallancey’ s ideas were much closer to the truth than those of his fellow antiquaries, who still thought the mounds to be of foreign origin. Vallancey believed that ‘The engravings are certain proof of the purpose for which it [Newgrange] was constructed, and that it was not designed for a granary, or a Danish sepulchre, as has been asserted by a great pretender to a knowledge in Irish antiquities.’ Vallancey and his informants, whoever they were, did not realize that the passage was constructed to admit rays of the sun. Vallancey stated that the Druids ‘directed their worship to Saman [the sun] in caves and darkness. Such I take to be the cave of Newgrange.’ He explained Saman, ‘By Samh, our Druids understood the sun’ , and further elaborated, ‘heat and light is the producer and preserver of life; therefore Sol was the god of nativity’ . Elsewhere he informs us, ‘We also frequently find subterraneous build ings in Ireland, which are evidently of Druidical workmanship, such as that of New Grange near Drogheda, which may probably have been the place of sacrificing to Samman.’ It is unlikely that Vallancey could have created these associations entirely from his own imagination. It seems probable that his researches were tapping some elements of genuine oral tradition. His knowledge of the Irish language would have put him in touch with sources that would have been inaccessible to other anti quarians. He further anticipated later findings about Newgrange by successfully identifying it as Cairn Aongus. He correctly claimed, ‘it was constantly distinguished by the name Oengus. We find it mentioned in the Chronicon Scotorum, with the grove which surrounded it, by the name Fiodh Aongusa, or the grove of Aongus, though several persons have imagined that a chief of the name of Aongus or Oengus was interred here.’ He also correctly associated Ruad-a-Daghdae with an ‘epithet of the sun’ , a
22



In i y90 Jo h n Whittley Boswell wrote a satire on Vallancey's Irish antiquarian researcher. The above print was used to lampoon the difficulties Vallancey supposedly encountered upon entering the passage especially at the point marked E, ‘ This I mention lest I should be thought guilty of disrespect, in putting my most unworthy parts foremost into the venerable remains of antiquity. ’ Boswell has Vallancey describing Newgrange as an inverted Egyptian pyramid (right).
‘poetical name of Aurora, signifying the expander of the light of Dagh or Dagon’ . This of course is none other than the mythological Dagda, lord of Brú na Bóinne. Vallancey was among the very first to point out the importance of the cross-quarter days, which fall between the solstices and equinoxes in the ancient Irish calendar. Here he was very clear about his sources: ‘The names of some of the ancient festivals are handed down to us by the mouths of the common people.’ He also cited manuscripts, ‘Thus Cormac, in his glossary, says the four great fires of the Druids were in the beginning of February, May, August and November.’ According to Vallancey, ‘The fire of the Druids lighted on the Neomenia [new moon] of the four quarter months’ , and ‘high mountains were assigned for their astronomical observations’ . ‘Their festivals were generally governed by the motion of the heavenly bodies, was it not necessary that the people should be warned of their approach?’ In his essay, ‘A Vindication of the Ancient History of Ireland’ , Vallancey set forth a view of prehistory that was revolutionary for its time: ‘Astronomy took its use in the latitude of 490 or 50°; here the arts had their birth, and from thence spread towards the South’ . It is only in the past decade or so that we have begun to realize that megalithic structures demonstrate considerable astronomical skill on the part of their
23



builders during the late Stone Age, and that the monuments in Ireland and northern Europe, some dating from the fourth millennium b c , are the earliest of their kind, predating those of the Mediterranean. Vallancey could not have known that the mounds were constructed in remote ages long before the emergence of Druids. It is quite possible, however, that the Celtic Druids inherited some remnants of a much earlier system of astronomy. Vallancey described Druids as ‘the revolutionprophets or the observers of time’ . In Druidism Revived he claimed that ‘the highest degree of Druidic order studied astronomy and divined by the aspect of the sun, moon and stars’ . These comments correspond very closely with historical accounts of the Druids related by Roman and Greek writers, and they are also supported by references to Druids in ancient Irish literature. Matching his interpretation of the mounds, Vallancey was the very first to advance an astronomical explanation of the rock engravings. Where other antiquarians could see only ‘rude scribblings’ and ‘barbarous carvings’ , Vallancey saw the stars in the stones. These he aptly described as ‘the most ancient inscriptions now remaining in Ireland, if not in these parts of Europe’ . T o him they were ‘ Hibernian Druidic Symbols’ , representing the cycles of the sun, moon and stars, ‘the chief if not the only deities of the heathen Irish’ . By 1804 he had identified symbols of the sun and moon and had already pointed out the numerical significance of some of the engravings and their relationship to astronomy. Had Vallancey been taken more seriously the great error of modern archaeology, in trying to imagine the human form in the engravings, could have been avoided. Instead, after his death in 18 12 , Vallancey’s ideas were quickly abandoned as ‘mystical speculation’ and replaced by a wide range of theories that have proved to be much less convincing in the light of recent research. Referring to the followers of General Vallancey, William Wilde was relieved to be able to report a few years later that ‘that school has now become nearly extinct’ . T o modern archaeologists, the only worthwhile contribution made by Vallancey was the entertainment provided by a crude satire on his work written by John Boswell and entitled The Antiquities of Killmackumpshaugh in the County of Roscommon and Kingdom of Ireland, in which it is clearly proved that Ireland was originally peopled by A E G Y P T I A N S (1790). Ironically, it is probable that impartial posterity will acknowledge that Vallancey’ s explanation of the mounds as ‘Caves of the Sun’ was the most realistic and perceptive interpretation of his time, and that his insights will eventually prove to be of far more significance than all other antiquarian contributions. Developments during the nineteenth century were already setting the stage for the eventual vindication of one of Newgrange’s greatest illustrators and interpreters.
24



The coming of the light
Megalithic mounds in the nineteenth century
During the early part of the nineteenth century at least one researcher continued to take seriously the concepts first advanced by Vallancey, though with certain modifications. M iss L. C. Beaufort referred at this time to the mounds as ‘Cairns of the Sun and Altars of the Sun’ . In ‘An Essay upon the state of Architecture and Antiquities, previous to the landing of the Anglo-Normans in Ireland’ she remarked that ‘ Such artificial high places are generally situated in an eminence, frequently upon the tops of hills and mountains; and these stations were so chosen as to form a chain of connexion with each other in such a manner, that on the festival days, the first of M ay and the first of November most especially, the fires of Bel (the sun), were seen from one to the other over the whole country.’ Regarding stone circles she related that ‘it is thought that they expressed periods of time or astronomical epochs’ . She believed that all megalithic structures were connected with the worship of the sun, arriving at this conclusion ‘from the knowledge gleaned out of pagan authors’ . As with Vallancey, current research lends considerable support to these conclusions, especially in connection with the Loughcrew Mountains, some 33 miles west of the Boyne Valley, where there is a large complex of mounds. Beaufort herself was the first to point out the existence of the mysterious mounds at Loughcrew in an address to the Royal Irish Academy in 1827. ‘In the County of Westmeath in one of the hills of Loughcrew, which are called by the peasants the Witches Hops, is an extensive excavation, consisting of three large chambers with a narrow passage leading to them. In one of these rooms is a flat altar-stone of considerable size; near to this artificial cave stand two lofty pillar stones known among the people by the names of “ the speaking stones” and “ the whisperers” .’ Beaufort is probably referring to two standing stones outside the entrance, as at Knowth. There are other stones a few miles away in Farranaglogh Townland which were known as the ‘ Speaking Stones’ , but these are too far away to be the ones that Beaufort is referring to. There is a holed standing stone in a field on a nearby farm which was removed from the area immediately in front of Cairn T , and this is probably one of the old ‘speaking stones’ . It has been claimed that nothing was known of the character or contents of the Loughcrew cairns until 1858, when W. F. Wakeman measured and made plans of several of those remaining, and wrote a paper on the subject. The Ordnance Survey was working in this part of County Meath in 1836,
25



and on their maps they marked Cairn T as a ‘Fort’ and Cairn V as ‘ Stones’ . Unaccountably they omitted the mounds on the other two summits of the range, and even though they marked Cairn T with a Trigonometrical Station, apparently they were not aware of the vast complex of mounds in which Cairn T formed a central focal point. It was Eugene Alfred Conwell who was the first to publish an account that gave any idea of the full scope of the site. He was a local schoolmaster who, on 9 June 1863, was picnicking with his wife in these hills when ‘to my great astonishment, I found this commanding site studded with the remains of a necropolis of pre-historic age . . . When I first stated that I had discovered a series of hitherto unnoticed and undescribed cairns, established for 2 miles along a range of hills, within 40 miles of the city of Dublin, I was laughed at, naturally enough. . . .’ Even in their present state of preservation, the mounds crowning the Loughcrew Mountains can be seen from points located over wide distances. As one travels by road from Dublin, the hills become clearly distinguishable just before Tara, and the prominent structures of Cairns D, L and T can be identified standing out against the horizon like beacons. Given that the mounds were designed to be clearly visible from so far off, it is extraordinary that no reference to them appears until 1827. Even today the full extent of what exactly is left of this extensive Neolithic landscape is not known, and new, unexpected discoveries are still being made. By 1866 Conwell was able to communicate to the Royal Irish Academy the results of excavations, and a detailed, accurate description of thirteen cairns. A final description, entitled The Discovery of the Tomb of Ollamh Fodhla, was published in 1873. This contains ground-plans and illust rations of engraved stones by Herr Wilhelm Tomsohn. Conwell was partially aware that he had made an enormous discovery. Even though he evolved an elaborate and fanciful theory linking Loughcrew with the ancient Celtic cemetery of Taillten, he did realize that he had found a substantial corpus of prehistoric engravings. He regarded them as mystic symbols, and carefully recorded them with the idea of trying to decipher their meaning. In 1865 he reported to the Academy, ‘In all - so far as the explorations have gone - I have laid bare 1,393 separate devices, which will be found to be many times more than had previously been supposed to exist in Ireland.’ Conwell had unearthed a treasure house of megalithic art, which at that time had no known rivals. Soon after these mounds were discovered, G. V. Du Noyer, an officer in the Irish Geological Survey, produced a remarkable set of drawings recording with considerable accuracy seventy-six of the engraved stones at Loughcrew. In many instances Du Noyer’ s drawings are the only remaining records of stones which are now either missing, or have entirely lost their incised markings through weathering. Du Noyer recorded the designs over a hundred years ago, when they had just been exposed, and as an illustrator of megalithic art he has been proved invariably accurate and highly perceptive. His approach was to record objectively exactly what was on the stones; he refrained from exaggerating or creating forms as he
26



thought they should be or might have been. Some of his drawings are remarkably precise, and his many sketches are still useful as reliable guides. Only after the kerbstones at Knowth were uncovered during the 1940s did it become apparent that the engraved stones in the Boyne Valley exceeded those at Loughcrew in number. It is now known that there are at least 220 engraved stones in the Boyne Valley, which is double the number at Loughcrew. Together, the two districts contain the greatest collection of megalithic art in the world. All told, eleven of the passages leading into the mounds there still function as instruments of the lost art of Neolithic timekeeping, and many more await rediscovery or restoration. With those intact it is possible to view megalithic art in its intended context, and this allows for a new understanding that was never available to the earlier antiquarian investigators. From the very beginning the mounds presented a confusing picture of prehistoric civilization. The engravings at Loughcrew were even more perplexing than those in the Boyne Valley, although sun and star signs were immediately recognized. Large deposits of undated bones, many of which represented the remains of animals, were taken to be indicative of extensive human burials. Excavations conducted later during the nine teenth century continued to unearth burials in most of the mounds. Even though these burials wrere haphazard and random, at no time was it ever questioned that the purpose of the mounds was to fulfil a burial function and that the complex was designed as a giant city of the dead. In 1943, at Cairn H, Joseph Raftery uncovered decorated bone combs of Celtic type and thousands of bone slips, some of which had Iron Age motifs. Included with this assemblage was an iron compass, which was presumably used to execute some of the patterns. On the basis of the stratigraphical position of the bone slips, Raftery was convinced that Cairn H was a tomb erected in the Early Iron Age and used exclusively as a burial

place. Of course it is now realized that the bone slips belong to about the first century AD and that Cairn H is definitely a Neolithic structure, but the Loughcrew monuments in general are still considered to have been built later than those of the Boyne Valley, even though there is no real evidence for this assertion. Since the techniques of rock engraving at Loughcrew are at a much earlier stage of development than those employed in the Boyne Valley, it is quite probable that the Loughcrew monuments will be found to be the older of the two groups. When it is realized that most of the burial remains at Loughcrew are secondary, and have no relation to the original functions of the mounds, a less confusing picture of prehistoric civilization may emerge, and the Neolithic period will be seen in an entirely different light. Identifying the Loughcrew complex in ancient Irish literature is still an unsolved problem. However, in 1845 George Petrie successfully identified the Boyne Valley monuments as being the Brú na Bóinne of folklore and legend, even though the argument he advanced in his book, The Round Towers and Ancient Architecture of Ireland, was not acknowledged by scholars of his time. George Coffey expanded Petrie’s thesis in 1892, and now the identification is generally accepted. Yet by far the most significant discovery relating to megalithic mounds during the nineteenth century was that light entered the passage at Newgrange. It is not known when or by whom this was first noticed, but by 1897 it was a recurrent theme in the mystic poetry of George Russell, who wrote under the name ‘A .E .’ . The phenomenon was so far removed from the preconceptions of archaeol ogists that they refused even to consider investigating it until 1969, seventy-two years after it had first appeared in the visionary language of the key figure in the great Irish literary renaissance known as the Celtic Revival. One may excuse archaeologists for not investigating an event portrayed in a clearly visionary style of literature, but the idea was also advanced by scholars in the early twentieth century and substantiated by numerous eye-witness accounts. In many ways this was one of the greatest blunders of modern I rish archaeology. If archaeologists had been more obj ective, not only could they have made a substantial contribution to knowledge of astronomical achievements in prehistory, but they could have prevented disastrous reconstructions of the mounds, which failed to take possible astronomical functions into account. Sadly, the observations of eye witnesses were still being ignored at the time Jack Roberts and I began our research. We started by studying the astronomical features of the mounds, and soon recognized the need to record as many of the earlier accounts as we possibly could. This line of enquiry had been completely neglected hitherto. We were astounded by our immediate discoveries, but some times felt as if we were violating a kind of taboo by revealing things that were considered secret, hidden and forbidden. Indeed, the story of the light in megalithic mounds is one of the strangest in all the annals of archaeology.
28



Thisphotograph was taken during the 1880s or 1890s and it is the earliest known photograph of Newgrange. The entrance to the passage is shown, a measuring rod over the entrance stone.
As it first appears in print, the account of light at Newgrange takes on a weird and mysterious form, and comes to us in a dramatic treatment of legend entitled ‘A Dream of Angus Oge’ , written by George Russell in 1897. The significant passage is, ‘As he spoke, he paused before a great mound grown over with trees, and around it silver clear in the moonlight were immense stones piled, the remains of an original circle, and there was a dark low narrow entrance leading within - He took Con by the hand and in an instant they were standing in a lofty, cross shaped cave, built roughly of huge stones. “ This was my palace. In days past many a one plucked here the purple flower of magic and the fruit of the tree of life . . .” And even as he spoke, a light began to glow and to pervade the cave, and to obliterate the stone walls and the antique hieroglyphics engraven thereon, and to melt the earthen floor into itself like a fiery sun suddenly uprisen within the world, and there was everywhere a wandering ecstasy of sound; light and sound were one; light had a voice . . . “ I am Aengus, men call me Young. I am the sunlight in the heart, the moonlight in the mind; I am the light at the end of every dream . . . I will make you immortal; for my palace opens into the Gardens of the Sun” .’ In this passage Russell is definitely referring to Newgrange. We know this because in his autobiography of a mystic, The Candle of 1918),
29



he records a similar experience: ‘T o one who lay on the mound which is called the Brú on the Boyne a form like that the bards speak of Angus appeared and it cried: “ Can you not see me? Can you not hear me? I come from the land of Immortal Youth . . . Oh, see our sun is dawning for us, ever dawning, with ever youthful and triumphant voices. Your sun is but a smoky shadow: ours the ruddy and eternal glow . . . M y birds from purple fiery plumage shed the light of lights” .’ As imaginative and visionary as Russell’s prose is, it is extremely unlikely that he would have conceived certain images - the light, the engravings, the glowing floor - without first-hand or second-hand experience of the actual entry of the sun into the chamber. It is known that during the 1890s Russell made frequent excursions from Dublin to the mound. We also know that after 1849 the entrance to Newgrange had been cleared sufficiently to allow light to enter the passage. In 1849, William Wilde wrote in his The Beauties and Antiquities of the Boyne: ‘a few years ago a gentleman, then residing in the neighbourhood, cleared away stones and rubbish which obscured the mouth of the cave, and brought to light a very remarkably carved stone, which now slopes outwardly from the entrance.’ Once the entrance was cleared, the light of the rising sun at winter solstice would have penetrated the passage as far back as stone L 19 , regardless of a certain amount of collapse closer to the opening. The sun’s rays would have illuminated the triple spiral engraved on L 19 , later confused in folk tradition with the triple spiral in the chamber, which was in fact only illuminated again by the sun when the roof-box was opened early in the 1960s. As it is nearly 9 a.m. when rays of the rising sun penetrate the passage at winter solstice (as opposed to 5 a.m. for the summer solstice sunrise), someone, sometime after 1849 must have observed the phenomenon and perhaps realized it had some significance and meaning. T o Russell, who was primarily a poet and a painter, the light had mystical significance. Vallancey is frequently dismissed as having been of the astro-mystic school of megalithic research, but in reality he was not. It was Russell who founded that school. I f only to help define what the truly mystical approach is and clarify terms, it is worth considering Russell’ s work. In ‘The Childhood of Apollo’ he uses the imagery of A Dream of Angus Oge in a different context, substituting the cave of Diotima for Newgrange: ‘ “ Tell me have you ever seen a light from the sun falling on you in your slumber? No, but look now. Look upward.” As she spoke the cavern with its dusky roof seemed to melt away, and beyond the heavens the heaven of heavens lay dark in pure tranquillity, in a quiet which was the very hush of being. In an instant it vanished, and over the zenith broke a wonderful light. “ See now',” cried Diotima, “ the Ancient Beauty” . ‘ So from age to age the Eternal Beauty bows itself down amid sorrows, that the children of men may not forget it, and their anguish may be transformed, smitten through by its fire.’
30



Russell constantly uses the recurring words and images of light, dark, shadow, starry, shining and stone in his prose and poetry. ‘A Vision of Beauty’, ‘Dawn Song’ , ‘Immortality’ , ‘The Memory of Earth’, ‘Morning’ , ‘The Fountain of Shadowy Beauty’, ‘ Winter’, ‘The Message of John’ and ‘ Star Teachers’ are some of the poems in a collection called The Earth Breadth and Other Poems (1897) that utilize these themes. ‘The Cave of Lilith’, ‘The Story of a Star’ and ‘Voices of the Stones’ are other works in which the shadow of Newgrange may be seen. As a Celtic Revivalist, Russell was not so much concerned with the builders of Newgrange as with the ancient Irish vision of the mounds as inhabited by immortal gods of light. T o him megalithic sites were ‘cyclopean crypts and mounds once sanctified by Druid mysteries, and divine visitations and passings from the mortal to the immortal.’ He dramatized the legends concerning Newgrange because he felt, ‘perhaps, the time is not altogether wasted in considering legends like these, for they reveal, though but in phantasy and symbol, a greatness we are heirs to, a destiny which is ours though it be yet far away.’ Russell died on 17 Ju ly 1935, at the age of 68. He never explicitly stated anywhere how he came to learn of the light entering Newgrange. Although clues appear in his autobiography, perhaps one cannot expect detailed observations in what has been called ‘one of the most important records of the mystic life ever written’ . Interestingly enough, the friend who is with him at Newgrange in the autobiography could be W. B. Yeats. Since his death, Russell’s name has remained in comparative obscurity. But Russell himself felt that one day his work would be fully appreciated. Today it is clear that he was the first writer to recognize and respond to the meaning of the light entering Newgrange. The light at Newgrange was not the only one to be ignored. In a more scientific work, The Book of Sundials, published in 1872, M rs Alfred Gatty pointed out similarities between ancient sundials and the Neolithic rock engravings at Loughcrew and Dowth. She observed that a stone on Patrickstown Hill, Loughcrew, shows a rayed circle with a central hole ‘very much like some of those sundials we still find on churches’ . The book comments on the radial designs at Dowth, ‘some of the early dials or circles may have been used as horizontal dials for finding the north only, by means of morning and afternoon observations of the shadow of a vertical gnomon’ . In 1980, Jack Roberts and I were able to discern actual fullyworked-out diurnal sundials at Knowth. By the end of the nineteenth century an architect, George Wilkinson, had already begun to challenge the colonization theory, claiming that the mounds could ‘not be works of temporary invaders or intruders’ ; and the astronomer, Sir Norman Lockyer, pointed out that ‘neither Newgrange and Dowth on the Boyne, nor Gavrinis in Brittany bear any internal proof of being specially prepared as tombs’ . Certainly the isolated views of architects, astronomers, mystics and sundiallers were not going to make the model of prehistory advanced by archaeologists crumble, but already the cracks were beginning to show.

To catch a sunbeam
Neolithic astronomy and twentieth-century
archaeology
At the turn of the century Newgrange was rapidly beginning to regain some of its former prestige. Not only was its appearance gradually improving, but soon the passage had a gate and a caretaker and the beam of light entering the mound was becoming part of local folklore and tradition. The caretaker, M r Robert Hickey, and his wife were apparently partly responsible for establishing the oral tradition. It must be emphasized that although numerous testimonies confirm that the oral tradition existed, there is nothing to indicate that it had its origins in an ancient tradition, and its source appears simply to have been observation of the event by local people. The sun’ s entry must have become increasingly noticeable and dramatic as debris was cleared away from in and around the passage. The Hickeys are known to have attributed great significance to the beam of light and, over the years, by informing visitors and groups of schoolchildren, the story evolved all the characteristics of a legend. By i960 the ‘legend’ of the sun’s rays entering the mound on a certain day of the year had appeared in print, accompanying a colour photograph of Newgrange on a local calendar. At that time the archaeologist Glyn Daniel was residing in the Conyngham Arms Hotel, where the calendar was - and still is - on display. He was working on a book, Newgrange and the Bend of the Boyne (co-written with Sean P. Ó Ríordáin and eventually published in 1964), and in it he recalls the calendar and makes the first written reference by an archaeologist to the legend of the light beam at Newgrange. It is a ‘strange wild-cat account’ , Daniel says, which ‘needs quoting almost in toto as an example of the jumble of nonsense and wishful thinking indulged in by those who prefer the pleasures of the irrational and the joys of unreason to the hard thinking that archaeology demands.’ Any discipline may have difficulty in accepting new ideas, especially if they are presented in the form of folk tradition or dramatized legend. However, as early as 1909, Sir Norman Lockyer, an astronomer and Director of the Solar Physics Observatory, had clearly stated that Newgrange is orientated to the winter solstice in his book, Stonehenge and Other British Slone Monuments Astronomically Considered. Lockyer is very rarely given credit for being the first to draw attention to this fact on a scientific level. At much the same time, as a result of completely independent research, an American anthropologist, W. Y. Evans-Wentz, arrived at very similar conclusions. In 1907 and 1908 Evans-Wentz did preparatory work under the direction of the Oxford Professor of Celtic and during 1909-10 made folklore expeditions into Brittany and Ireland. In a

This photograph was taken in 19 0 8 , when a gate was installed at the entrance of Newgrange.

The dry stone walling to the immediate left of the young girl is part of the original structure, but has been removed in the modern reconstruction.
section of his book, The Fairy-Faith inCeltic Testimony of Archaeology’, Evans-Wentz not only drew attention to the fact that Newgrange was astronomically orientated, but also pointed out that mounds in Brittany, such as Gavrinis, had the same solar orientation. Thus, in the early part of this century, both an astronomer and an anthropologist had recognized an extremely important feature of New grange, and yet archaeologists seem to have been totally unaware of it. As another investigator of megalithic monuments in the 1920s, Admiral Boyle-Somerville, said: ‘ It is senseless to condemn [Astronomical] Orientation as being figmentary, or non-existent, as many do, without taking the trouble to investigate the subject practically by direct observ ation in the field.’ Much of the confusion and mystery surrounding Newgrange at this time was due to the lack of adequate documentation of the solar event itself. None of the contemporary published accounts can have been based on actual observations by the writers. Neither the mystic Russell, the astronomer Lockyer nor the anthropologist Evans-Wentz recorded a direct empirical observation of the light itself. Lockyer and Evans-Wentz referred to astronomical alignments and orientations and only hinted at light beams, while the light that Russell saw was purely visionary. Apparently the only people to have made true observations at Newgrange were the caretakers and a few local residents, and none of them published what they witnessed.

It is still hard to understand how the truth continued to elude archaeologists. I had the honour of meeting Robert Hickey in 1970, and during the time I lived in the Boyne Valley I was able to interview many of his close friends. While it is clear that Hickey knew that the sun’s rays entered the mound at winter solstice, it is not known how a group of amateur archaeologists, in 1935, could have confused this with the summer solstice and mounted an excursion to the mound at precisely the time of year when the sun’s position at dawn is in fact furthest from the entrance to the passage. The search for the sunlight began to resemble the search for the Loch Ness monster. The ill-fated expedition, equipped with tents for a three-night vigil, was doubly unfortunate in not having a single clear morning in which to view the rising sun. As a result of this fiasco the legend continued to remain unconfirmed, while the embittered caretaker continued to entertain visitors with his tales about the sun and the mound. Undoubtedly archaeological attitudes andpreconceptions were partly to blame. R. A. S. Macalister, who excavated at Newgrange (1928) and Knowth (1940) and knew of Hickey’s claims, remarked: ‘I may as well say here quite plainly that I have no faith whatsoever in correlations between the orientation of Rude Stone Monuments of any kind and astronomical phenomena and in reductions drawn therefrom.’ Even when it was finally confirmed that the sun’ s rays did actually enter the mound, acceptance of the fact was reluctant and its full significance ignored. Reluctance to accept or even test astronomical interpretations of the mounds spilled over into a rejection of all interpretations of the rock engravings which would suggest any connection with astronomy. George Coffey had seen the stars in the stones just as Eugene Conwell before him had seen them in cupmarks at Loughcrew, groups of which he thought were representative of constellations. The sun is in a sense the nearest star and early investigators quickly recognized the obvious solar symbols. In his book on Newgrange, Coffey is direct: ‘Evidence of the solar cult is abundant at Loughcrew; rayed suns and wheel-like figures are plentiful. There is no reason to doubt that the cross-in-circle is a sun-symbol, the equilateral cross denoting the main directions in which the sun shines, becoming the symbol of the luminary itself.’ Elsewhere he writes. ‘The rayed cup-and-circle as found at Loughcrew is, no doubt, a solar symbol. The solar disc with rays proceeding downwards is a well known Egyptian sign for solar energy.’ Like other investigators, Coffey did not follow up these initial insights, and was perfectly satisfied that the mounds functioned solely as graves. He therefore failed to connect the symbols with astronomical events at the mounds. He concluded finally that the engravings were decorative. The reason why megalithic art has remained enigmatic for so long is not due to early man’s inability to communicate ideas or to misleading associations surrounding the forms used in that art. The failure to interpret the meaning of the art stems from the failure to recognize the basic elements of the visual vocabulary. The investigators of the last century were able to recognize solar imagery, but could take their initial
34



insights no further. In this century, solar imagery was almost completely ignored, because it could be too closely associated with astronomical alignments, which did not fit in with preconceived notions of prehistoric cultural development. The standard schemes of analysis of the symbols were originally worked out by Macalister (19 2 1) and Breuil (1934), and these were elaborated or repeated by Piggott (1954), Ó Ríordáin and Daniel (1964), Lynch (1967) and Eogan (1968). In these schemes the engravings were initially reduced to being merely decorative or orna mental, and then later there was a futile attempt to derive human faces and figures from them. The solar emblems recognized by Conwell (1864) and Coffey (1892) became eyes of the ‘mother goddess’ . Flowers, axes, ships, male genital organs, feet, serpents and owls all appeared in these schemes, which seemed to include everything under the sun, yet managed to ignore the sun itself. It is unfortunate that the anthropomorphic interpretation gained such widespread acceptance, because there is not a single engraving which shows a convincing rendition of the human form. This misguided approach was first advanced by Abbé Breuil, who visited the mounds in the early 1930s. Breuil made inaccurate drawings, deliberately over stressing the elements which he regarded as anthropomorphic. Outside the field of archaeology other scholars in Ireland wisely maintained that many of the engravings were solar symbols. T . F. O’ Rahilly, who was a Professor in the School of Celtic Studies during the 1940s, recognized a circle with rays leading out from the circumference as a Roth Rámach or a Roth Fáil, i.e. ‘the wheel of light’ . In 1957 the Spanish archaeologist, Albuquerque e Castro, argued that the juxtapo sition of radial lines with a crescent found in an Iberian megalithic structure represented the sun and moon. These interpretations were not accepted as a convincing explanation. M y own approach to the problem
The stone roofing slab of a mound chamber, all that remains of what zuas once a complete structure. Today the slab stands upright in a field adjacent to the Sess Kilgreen mound in Co. Tyrone. When it zuas examined by George Coffey in 1899, he stated that it had ‘some good stars with cup-centres. Some of the stars have lines going from them. . . . ’



has been to establish a link between the light of the actual sun entering the mounds and its corresponding symbols. During excavations carried out at Newgrange between 1962 and 1975, Michael J. O’Kelly discovered intact a curious structure over the entrance to the passage which he named the roof-box. The roof-box is a special aperture carefully constructed to admit light, not only down the passage, but into the very back recesses of the chamber. The top lintel, which was engraved with a rectilinear pattern, had become exposed as early as 1837. When the complete structure was unearthed it aroused a great deal of interest. It was seriously thought to be an offering cell for gifts to the dead or even a special entrance for spirits of the dead. All this of course was strictly in keeping with the tomb theory. O’ Kelly thought that the real reason for the aperture could be connected with the local tradition regarding the sun’s entry into the mound. During the winter solstice of 1969 O’ Kelly entered the chamber before sunrise to become the first archaeologist directly to observe the beam of light. He was familiar enough with the construction of the mound to realize that the straight line leading from the backstone to the centre of the roof-box aligns with the critical spot where the sun appears on the horizon. As a witness to the event itself he could only come to the conclusion that the seventeen-minute display of light he saw in the chamber was intentional and significant. He recorded his observations and presented the facts as best he could. The reaction was amazing: rather than face the implication of the new knowledge, a number of people at once raised objections, none of which would eventually be substantiated. Based on flimsy and superficial data, some held that the probability of chance occurrence was one in ten or fifteen. This is a current fallacy, whose origins stem from a total unfamiliarity with sunbeam dialling and how it operates. Others held that the sun would not have entered the mound at the time of its construction. In fact, the event always has and always will occur, barring major catastrophe. In more desperate attempts to discredit the data, some went so far as to claim that O’ Kelly reconstructed the roofbox himself in order to admit the light. This malicious rumour can easily be disproved by photographic evidence. T o complicate matters further, although Jon Patrick had demonstrated in a survey that Newgrange provided by far the most convincing evidence for the astronomical orientation of some megalithic structures, no one, including O’ Kelly, had recognized the degree of precision involved. Amidst all the quibbling it was forgotten that a local tradition similar to the one surrounding Newgrange also existed in the Loughcrew Moun tains, and that Newgrange itself was only part of a much larger system of solar constructs.

The shadow artists
Basic fundamentals of Neolithic sundialling
I arrived in Ireland in June 1970. M y background is in art: I first studied it in New York City, where I was born, at the Pratt Institute, and later in Japan and Mexico, where I became interested in prehistoric rock engraving. M y initial reaction to the ancient Irish art was one of awe and surprise at the exciting power and total abstraction of the elements. It is odd that this art, which represents the first major western European art tradition since the Ice Age, has managed to remain obscure and relatively unknown. Even histories dealing specifically with Irish art treat of it briefly and superficially. I think this is because of the profound enigma that has always surrounded it. The guide book available in the early 1970s stated that it would be futile for us to attempt to attach a specific meaning to the symbols. M y training in art research did not allow me to accept this. The problem posed by highly abstract visual concepts is that, although narrow in intention, they are broad in extension, that is, they are capable of referring to many things. Only the context can reveal which meaning is intended. It is the context which decides whether a circle with extending radial lines refers to the sun, or whether no semantic function at all is intended, as in a wheel. A highly abstract design that bears little or no obvious resemblance to its referent must rely even more heavily on explanatory context to reveal its meaning. I first began researching the art on a casual basis, but by 1976 I was involved in full-time documentation and analysis. I began with no preconceptions, but my regular visits to Newgrange at the winter solstice and other researches suggested to me by 1979 a possible explanation for both the rock engravings and the orientation of the mounds. M y theory was not observer-imposed. The suggestion of solar and lunar images and the presence of actual sundials in the engravings, coupled with the spectre of the light entering Newgrange and the tremendous weight of tradition meant that all the needles were pointing in one direction. I f the astronomical potential of the passage mounds in general was examined I was almost certain that it would demonstrate a close matching of the mounds to the movements of the sun and moon at this latitude. Just as the art displayed in a church could be expected to be religious, the art displayed in astronomical constructs could be expected to refer to the sun, the moon and the stars. Another artist and amateur astronomer, Jack Roberts, was also con cerned with the implications of New’grange. We had met a few years earlier and he was aware of my work on the rock engravings. When he visited my
37



studio one evening in February 1980 he was impressed by the small models I had constructed of Neolithic sundials. I explained that there are no textbooks on the very earliest forms of sundialling and that I had in effect to become a sundialler myself and learn through observing how the models operated. I also showed him how I was studying the interaction of the sun and earth and light and shadow by sunbeam dialling. I was investigating the behaviour of beams of light projected by the setting sun through the back windows of the studio at 10 ft, 23 ft and 27 ft. These distances are comparable to some of the smaller passages in the mounds and I was beginning to familiarize myself with techniques that were used very early in man’s cultural development. What excited Jack most was when I announced that I felt I was ready to start testing the theories in the field by direct empirical observation inside the mounds. Both the Boyne Valley and Loughcrew complexes are conveniently close to Dublin, and, as we have seen, these two groups of sites contain the bulk of megalithic art in Ireland. I thought these sites should be investigated first because, if the extant passage mounds could be demonstrated to be solar orientated, it would eliminate the possibility of chance occurrence and establish astronomical features as characteristic of the mounds. The research would be systematic, and would naturally extend to the few relatively isolated but similar mounds bearing the imprint of megalithic art. (This category does not include all the 150 passage mounds in Ireland, but enough to be a valid sample.) Before telling the full story of our discoveries, some fundamentals of Neolithic sundialling need to be considered. Figure i is a diagram of the sun’s extreme positions as it rises on the horizon at various times during the year. Below this is a circle representing the year in time and how it is divided by these extreme positions. At summer solstice the sun is at its most northerly position on the horizon as it rises, and it assumes its highest position in the sky, 6o° 18' at noon. This day is called Midsummer’ s Day and is the longest one of the year. At winter solstice the sun is at its most southerly position on the horizon as it rises, and it assumes its lowest position in the sky, only 12 i8 \ at noon. This day is called Midwinter’ s Day and is the shortest one of the year. These positions vary with latitude. Near the equator the solstice rising positions are much closer together. As one travels north or south these positions begin to widen. In the Boyne Valley at 53 4 1' north latitude the variation of these positions is large and to its early inhabitants this was probably one of the most striking variations in the natural world. This annual solar movement along the horizon from one solstice to another and back again describes a year. It is an apparent movement that results from the earth’ s orientation in space and the motion of the earth in its orbit around the sun. The recognition of these movements along the horizon and the careful attention given to them by early man does not imply a recognition of the celestial mechanism which causes them. E. C. Krupp, who has done extensive research on prehistoric astronomies, has pointed out that astronomical events on the horizon are both indicators of
38



the orientation and motion of the earth in space and, in turn, the indicators of seasonal changes. T o ancient peoples it might have seemed that the astronomical indicators were simultaneously the cause and symbol of the world’s great forces. Our research in Ireland would tend to support this view. For our research it is therefore more pertinent to consider the apparent motions of the sun than the astronomical phenomena which cause the apparent motion. As the sun moves from one solstice to another, its declination changes from 23° 27' south to 23° 27' north. This is the result of the angle of tilt of the earth’s axis away from the celestial equator, which is 230 27'. The celestial equator is the great circle in the sky which lies on a plane perpendicular to the earth’ s axis. The declination of the sun is its angular distance away from the celestial equator. Throughout the year the sun’ s apparent motion will be restricted to declinations lying between these two extremes. When the sun is above the celestial equator the days will be longer, and when it is below the celestial equator the days will shorten. When the sun is on the celestial equator its declination will be o° o' and day and night will be equal. This is called the equinox. Besides defining the day and the year, the apparent movements of the sun also define the cardinal directions. At equinox, the sun will rise due east and set due west anywhere in the world. It will rise to its highest point in the sky at midday and define south. On any day of the year a line north and south will bisect the angle of its rising and setting positions.
39



It is the apparent geometric structuring of the heavens which gave rise to the geometric forms in megalithic architecture and art. The principal tool used for recognizing this structuring was undoubtedly the gnomon. In figure i I have positioned three stones which align to a central stone and the sun in a geometrical arrangement. The central stone is a gnomon, which literally means ‘one who knows’ . A gnomon is any vertical object that shows time by casting its shadow. It is an essential element in any sundial and may be used to show either the time of day or the time of year. Figure i indicates how it is used on the plane of the horizon as the position of the sun changes, so that the shadow strikes stones i, 2 and 3 respectively at winter solstice, equinox and summer solstice. It has often been said that there is no human instrument more ancient or more interesting than the sundial; it is a visible map of time. The earliest must have been erected in the Old Stone Age tens of thousands of years ago; but among the oldest now known are those built in Ireland during the Neolithic period. Besides the equinox and solstices there are two other positions of the sun on the horizon which were evidently important to Neolithic diallers. These positions are included in figure 2, and the circle below shows how the year is divided into eight parts when these positions are included. These new positions are called cross-quarter days, and they define half time intervals between the solstices and the equinoxes. Notice that although they divide the year equally in time, their positions on the horizon are much nearer to the solstice positions. The reason for this is that the earth’s orbit around the sun is not a circle but an ellipse. The effect is that the sun’s rising position on the horizon changes rapidly as the year approaches equinox, and slows down nearly to a standstill as the year comes to the solstice. The term ‘solstice’ in fact means ‘sun’ s standstill’ . For a period of eleven days before and after the exact day of the solstice the sun’ s position on the horizon moves extremely slowly. By way of example, prior to the winter solstice in 1980 the declination of the sun changed from 22 60' to 23 26' during this period, whereas prior to equinox the sun’ s declination changed from 408' to o° 1 T in the same period of eleven days. Thus it is much easier to determine the precise date of equinox than the precise date of winter solstice. Cross-quarter days are extremely important because they express a rhythm which is linked to the seasonal cycle and which has an immediate application to the agricultural calendar. Solstices and equinoxes are primarily of astronomical interest only, whereas the cross-quarter days define spring, summer, autumn and winter and serve to announce times for planting and harvesting and moving domestic animals. This involves social organization and, as a rule, the more complex the social organization of a culture, the more complex the calendar will become. The Neolithic mounds are evidence in themselves that Neolithic people were not only farmers, but led a relatively complex way of life which included building permanent monuments. Farm surpluses allowed more time for the creation and exchange of goods and services, as well as for astronomical pursuits and probably ritual gatherings. Some of these activities may have
40



become the province of specialists, thus creating a division of labour and a central authority. The calendar was the device which regulated these activities through the year. With the inclusion of the cross-quarter days in figure 2 the sundial calendar becomes far more useful and effective. Notice that the two crossquarter-day stones operate twice a year, like the stone marking the equinox. Also notice that the dates given for the cross-quarter days are slightly different from the traditional ones. Modern festival days were adopted for convenience to the first day of the month, whereas in prehistoric times these dates could only have been determined by observing the sun and its shadow. Notice, too, that the dates given in the diagrams are the usual calendar dates of the events. In some years these may vary slightly either side of the usual dates. In figure 3 I have substituted the ground plans of passages in megalithic mounds for the gnomons. The passage and chamber of a megalithic mound is a far more complex, precise and specialized instrument than a gnomon is. Instead of simply casting a shadow, the passage narrows a beam of light as it is projected into the chamber. The passage is aligned to particular points on or near the horizon. When the sun occupies these points at special times of year, light passes without interruption along the whole length of the passage to illuminate the backstone of the chamber. This type of sundialling is called sunbeam or light-beam dialling, and it represents a great technological improvement over shadow dialling with a gnomon. It does not require observation of the sun’ s shadow at the moment of sunrise, since it gives a clear definition of both the altitude and direction of the sun after the sun has risen. Not only is it more accurate, but it gives warnings of events and is a permanent construct that needs no re aligning. It is surprising that such Neolithic solar constructs have survived for so long, many of them intact and in working order. They are older than all the other known solar alignments of the Old and New Worlds. In Egypt Sir Norman Lockyer described how light-beam techniques were used at the Great Temple of Amun at Karnak for solstice observation, a description supported in more recent years by another astronomer, Gerald Hawkins. Lockyer pointed out that the technique was used in eastern observatories until the middle of the eighteenth century. Similar devices, less ancient than those of Europe and the Near East, have been demonstrated for the
41



New World too. In a book written in 1945, called Mysteries of Ancient South America, Harold T . Wilkins disclosed information about ancient American sites that was at the time considered fabulous and not taken very seriously. On page 172 he remarks: ‘There are, it may be mentioned here, spots along the canyon of the Rio Colorado, where arrows cut deeply into the face of the sheer walls can be seen in certain lights and incidences of the solar rays.’ Recently in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, such a scheme was discovered: an arrangement of large stones was apparently positioned intentionally so that the rays of the sun would illuminate a set of spirals in ways suggesting special consideration for equinoxes and solstices. On page 168 of his book Wilkins describes something even more interesting: ‘When Cuzco was the capital of old Peru, it contained a Temple of the Sun, famed far and near for its magnificence. . . . In the west wall, the architects had contrived an aperture, in such a way that, when the sunbeams reached it, it caught and focused them inside the temple’ s nave and sanctuary. Stretching inside the temple, like a gold chain, from one sparkling point to another, the rays encircled the walls, illuminating the grim idols, and disclosing certain mystic signs, at other times invisible.’ It transpires that remains in Peru do have alignments and the Inca did possess sundials. In substance it is likely that what Wilkins reports is true. Mayan temples have parallels to the basic strategies alleged to have been employed in Peru. The problem that faced Jack and myself was that we were dealing with dialling methods about which we had no practical knowledge. We had to rely on direct observation in the field, supplemented by experiments with models in the studio. In the beginning our only actual experience was what we had seen at Newgrange. The only real description we had of the method was Lockyer’ s detailed discussion of the apertures and pylons of the Great Temple of Amun at Karnak. We were forced to start from the very beginning and explore the fundamentals until we ourselves became artists of light and shadow. The wooden stakes depicted in figure 4 are aligned to define two dates. On day 1 a shadow is aligned with stakes 1 A and iB . On day 2 the shadow has moved to align with stakes 2A and 2B. Since the B stakes are placed twice as far away from the gnomon as the A stakes, they describe a difference in the angle of the shadow that is twice as great. The difference in the two days is doubly magnified and is made far more apparent by the B stakes. The accuracy of any solar construct increases directly in proportion to its size. Let us suppose that two passages, one twice the size of the other,
42



are aligned to the same date (figure 5). The date is determined by the position of the light beam striking the backstone. The sun’s rays are always parallel. On a particular day near the date of the alignment the light enters both mounds. An observer in the smaller passage must begin to consider the light as it strikes the backstone, whereas the observer in the larger passage knows immediately and at a glance that the intended date has not yet arrived. Considered either architecturally or astronomically, no two mounds are the same, but they do exhibit similar characteristics, besides a preference for particular periods and events in the solar cycle. One of the chief aims of megalithic architecture is to reduce the light in the interior of the chamber. The darker the chamber, the more brilliant and magnificent the narrow shaft of light will appear to be. I f the construct is intact, the beam of light will invariably be projected in the form of a rectangle, always aimed at the backstone with a few interesting exceptions. In figure 6, A represents a section of stones forming a typical passage and B is the backstone. The rectangle on the backstone is a beam of light projected by stones 1 ,2 , 3 and 4. Stone i is called a lintel or a roof-slab, 2 and 3 are passage stones or chamber stones, and stone 4 is called a sill. This basic construct is only a short step away from the concept of a roof-box, which is really a second aperture positioned above the roof-slab. I f stones 1 and 4 are missing the orientation of the alignment can still be determined, but if stones 2 and 3 are missing, as a solar construct the mound is a ruin. The daily movement of the beam of light traces the daily path of the sun, and will always move from left to right. Figure 7 depicts a backstone aligned to sunrise and a backstone aligned to sunset. As the sun rises the projected beam of light moves downwards, and as the sun sets the beam moves upwards. Each day the beam of light changes in exact accord with the daily change in the direction and altitude of the sun. The difference between one day and the next is amplified in proportion to the length of the construct. Besides this, the length of the construct increases the speed of movement of the light beam. I f one of the stones in figure 7 is placed in a construct twice as long, the beam of light will take half as much time to go from position 1 to position 2. But in fact determining a specific date is not arrived at by timing the speed of the light beam, but by noting its vary ing position which is magnified by increasing the length of the construct. It is unnecessary and impractical to design a solar construct so that the sun enters the chamber only on a single day. Not only would such a structure need to be hundreds of yards in length, but it would fail to give adequate warning of the approach of a specific date and would depend for its effectiveness on good weather conditions on that particular day. The
43



investment in extra time and labour would be immense, without any guarantee of success in solar observation. The typical megalithic solar construct is far more efficient, less delicate and equally accurate. Figure 8 shows a beam of light entering a chamber on two successive days prior to the date of the primary alignment. On day i, light is prevented from reaching the backstone. In a very small structure this may only be by a tenth of an inch, but the effect is the same - the two days are clearly visually differentiated to the observer. In all megalithic solar constructs the period during which the beam of light strikes the backstone is limited, and can be defined in terms of individual days. Let us say that this period is nine days and it is known to the observer from previous experience or marked on the stone itself. All the observer needs to do is count off the four days to the specific intended date of the alignment. Dependence on good weather conditions on that specific date is no longer required as the day has already been accurately determined in advance. During the period in which the light beam strikes the backstone, individual days can be defined in terms of the varying positions of the patch of light. On day i in figure 9 the beam of light frames a rock engraving. On the subsequent day it is evident that the beam is no longer in direct alignment with the engraving. Some backstones, however, have no engravings, and a specific day is determined solely on the basis of the position of the beam of light. In figure 10, on day 1 the beam of light is slightly off-centre, but on day 2 the beam is clearly in the central position. There are special requirements for determining the exact date of a solstice. Unless the construct is of an extremely large size the varying positions of the light beam will be almost undetectable during the entire twenty-two day period of the solstice. Let us suppose that in figure 1 1 position 2 represents the sun on the exact day of winter solstice sunrise and position i represents a day prior to the commencement of the solstice. After reaching position 1 the sun will always move to its furthest rising position south on the day of winter solstice and return again to position
44



i after the solstice. The exact date of winter solstice can always be determined by dividing the days the sun takes to return to position i by half. At Newgrange today the sun begins to enter the chamber on the eleventh day before the day of winter solstice. The construct actually gives a precise definition of the solstice period from which a specific date can easily be determined. Even if we assume that some of the stones in the passage have inclined inwards since the construction of the roof-box, the construct is capable of a high degree of precision. A great deal is made by sceptics of the fact that the tilt in the earth’ s axis has changed slightly over the past 5,000 years, which would mean that the rising position of the sun is different from the ancient one. In reality this shift is only one half a degree to the north of the original position, and makes no significant difference to the accuracy of the alignment. At equinox the variation is so minimal that it need not be considered at all. In order to test the theories in the field Jack and I decided in the spring of 1980 that the most promising monuments for research at that time of year were the two most prominent passage mounds in the Loughcrew complex, Cairns L and T . According to the ground plans we were using at the time both mounds seemed to be aligned slightly south of due east. I f they were equinox indicators we assumed that they would be aligned due east. This caused endless speculation. The astronomical significance of the equinox is obvious, but we had no idea why prominent major mounds should indicate a date that would fall prior to the spring equinox and after the autumnal equinox. For all we knew, the mounds could be aligned to a particular rising of the full moon. We decided to start by checking all the possibilities. We would begin our vigil by observing the full moon on the evening of 1 March, and begin to observe sunrises from the following morning. Jack would record the events by photography and I would do the drawing, measuring and timing. We would concentrate on Cairn T first and investigate Cairn L when we had some idea of what Cairn T did. We decided to do Cairn T first partly because it featured an elaborately engraved backstone that had intrigued me for years.

Movements in the mountains
The first foray at Loughcrew
Located about 40 miles from the mouth of the Boyne, the Loughcrew mountains provide a commanding view virtually from coast to coast and into both northern and southern provinces of Ireland. On these heights, entire complexes of permanent public structures were erected, possibly sometime before the major mounds in the Boyne Valley were beginning to be built around 3700 b c . The Loughcrew sites have escaped the attention and well-documented archaeological investigation devoted to their Boyne Valley counterparts. Archaeologists have consistently maintained that they are later than the Boyne sites, even though there are no radiocarbon dates to support this view, and, as we noted earlier, rock-engraving techniques appear to be more primitive - and therefore older - at Loughcrew. Within the Loughcrew complex, Cairn T , at over 900 ft, stands in the central position and takes the most prominent place on the highest summit of a megalithic area that may once have contained as many as fifty to a hundred mounds. The relative size and focal position of the mound indicates that, if it was a solar construct, the day that it defined must have had great significance for the builders. As Roberts and I began to realize this, we became more curious about the possible astronomical alignment. Unfortunately, adverse weather in the spring of 1980 prevented us from making a single observation of a sunrise. We stayed in the mountains the entire weekend of 1 March without getting a glimpse of the sun or moon. After returning to Dublin we tried changing our strategy. We took it in turns to study the weather conditions at 5 a.m. each morning, and, if the sky seemed clear, we would set off for Loughcrew at a moment’ s notice. The journey took about an hour and a half and we were usually positioned inside the chamber long before sunrise. On most occasions, however, clouds built up before dawn, thwarting our plans. During the first part of the month Jack and I spent long hours in the dark recesses of the mound waiting for the light. The mountains were covered with snow and the prevailing winds from the east blew icy gusts down the passage of the mound. Meteorologists know that 5,000 years ago the climate was more favourable, being up to 2 C milder. Prevailing winds, however, remain relatively constant and one thing we learned quickly was that the passage was not orientated to avoid them. As the month wore on, the bad weather and the mystery of the mound became only more intense. The equinox would come on 20 March that year, and we were in danger of passing that date without having made a single observation.
46



On the morning of 17 March Jack telephoned with excellent reports of perfectly clear skies. He sounded excited and said that all the stars were out and he had been watching Mars in conjunction with Regulus in his telescope. We were assured of a brilliant sunrise and, although the regular car was not working, he was certain he could get the Land Rover on the road immediately. We left Dublin late, but for the first time in two weeks we were under a starry sky. By the time we passed Kells a faint glow of light preceding the break of dawn was already beginning to shine in the east, and from the elevated seats of the Land Rover we could peer over the hedges and pick out the ancient high places and monuments of Meath in the distance. We were winding up the mountain road when the disc of the sun broke on the horizon. We felt as if we were ten minutes late for an appointment made over $,000 years ago. From the top of the road there would be a climb on foot to the mound perched on the summit of the mountain. The lock on the modern door leading to the passage had frozen during the night, and as we struggled with it the rising sun was already above the horizon. When we drew back the door a narrow chink of light streamed down the passage and flashed into the end recess of the chamber. On the upper left of the backstone a rectangular patch of light was rapidly beginning to take form (p. 94), brilliantly illuminating the entire chamber in a glowing splendour of shimmering golden orange light. It was dazzling, and when we entered the chamber we stood back and gazed in awe. Naturally, we had expected to see something similar to what we had seen at Newgrange. There, the low angle of the sun rising at winter solstice causes the beam of light to sweep across the chamber. Here, however, the light assumed a clearly defined geometric shape that was projected on to the upright backstone and moved diagonally across it, tracing the path of the sun against a mural of prehistoric art. What impressed us most was the careful and delicate modelling of the light beam by the huge stones forming the passage and chamber, and how the shape of the beam conformed to the patterns engraved on the stone. For the first time we were seeing the signs and symbols in the context in which the artist had meant them to be seen. Suddenly markings that had appeared to be random and haphazard became part of an intricately structured system that derived its meaning from the solar event we were witnessing. Working with model sundials had provided invaluable experience which could be applied to dealing with real dials in the field. Further experience with real solar constructs would naturally develop our skill in predicting and estimating the behaviour of light in relation to daily changes in the sun’s apparent position in the sky. What we had seen on 17 March indicated to us that the sun would not be striking the backstone for more than five or six days before and after the equinox, and on the day of the equinox, 20 March, the beam of light would sink lower on the stone and neatly frame a large engraved radial solar disc. In order to make an accurate determination of this we would need to make one other observation within the next few days.
47



It was clear to us that we were dealing with a solar construct capable of defining an individual day with far greater precision than Newgrange. The wider differences in the sun’s apparent movement at equinox made it considerably easier to define the actual day of equinox at Cairn T than the day of winter solstice at Newgrange. Coupled with the help of the rock engravings, this created a remarkably precise astronomical instrument. What we had seen at Cairn T encouraged us to investigate Cairn L as well. Cairn T is a major mound that dominates a group of smaller satellite mounds clustered around it on the summit of a mountain known as Sliabh na Cailliagh, the Mountain of the Sorceress, or otherwise Carnbane East (sometimes the entire range of mountains is referred to as Sliabh na Caillaigh). Cairn L is also a major mound, dominating a group of satellite mounds on Carnbane West. An unusual feature is a curious white standing stone positioned inside the chamber. We were now certain that this stone could be understood in terms of the behaviour of light inside the chamber. We agreed that Jack would lead a separate group to investigate Cairn L , and that I would form a group to continue monitoring Cairn T . As the equinox approached, weather conditions deteriorated. When the day of equinox came and went without our having been able to make an observation, we grew anxious, knowing that the days during which sunlight would directly strike the backstone were rapidly diminishing. Both teams took up their positions every morning regardless of weather conditions, since even a brief break in the clouds could provide the information we required. On the third day after equinox the weather at last improved. Sunlight appeared along the passage of Cairn T , stopping temporarily at stone 3 before a beam of light dramatically flashed all the way to the backstone and the patch of illumination began to form. As expected, the beam of light was not framing the radial solar disc, but appeared low and off-centre in the same way that it was above and offcentre on 17 March. On 20 March, the day of equinox, the sun would definitely focus on what was apparently an image of itself on the backstone. We were simultaneously being initiated into the wonders of megalithic astronomy and megalithic art. Suddenly Jack appeared at the passage entrance. He said that Cairn L was aligned to a position on the horizon that would not be occupied by the sun until much later in the year. These two major mounds - Cairns L and T - appeared to be orientated in the same direction according to archaeological surveys; however, in terms of real function, the equinox rising sun is focused on Cairn T , but does not approach anywhere near the passage of Cairn L. After that we never relied too much on surveys, and depended more on what we could see during the actual events. We again watched the dagger of sunlight move across the chamber floor at Cairn T . In two days time the light would no longer strike the backstone. Jack and I spent the Sunday afternoon (26 March) and evening in my studio going over the data from the two observations. During these sessions we argue opposing views in order to arrive at agreed conclusions. We had no doubts that the alignment was pre

49



determined and intentional. Neither of us could be sure if the lower angle of the rising sun at the autumnal equinox would create a significantly different display of light, but defining the spring equinox alone rep resented a considerable achievement. We could not determine whether Cairn L indicated a particularly critical time in the solar cycle, but we were almost certain that Knowth, the largest mound in the Boyne Valley complex, was aligned like Cairn T to the equinox. Knowth was in the process of being excavated and so would be difficult to investigate, but what we had seen at Cairn T suggested that major mounds in both complexes showed that the equinox was regarded as a time of primary significance and importance to the megalith builders. We recognized that the equinox has universal significance and it therefore seemed logical for Cairn T to be in a focal position. The equinox alignments complimented the solstice alignment of Newgrange, and those who were prepared to dismiss Newgrange as either an accidental or vague ritualistic and prelogical orientation would now have to try to explain away the impli cations of a precise, accurate, equinoctial alignment still in excellent working order. We decided to bring our findings to the newspapers. The reaction of newspaper editors on Monday morning was generally the same. They were all familiar with Newgrange and they immediately recognized the significance of what we had witnessed. In fact, what really perplexed them was how archaeologists had failed to make these dis coveries themselves. We explained that archaeologists had dismissed the astronomical potential of megalithic mounds for generations, and it was unlikely that a change in attitude would come about overnight. We had no idea whether our story would be printed, so that when we woke up the next morning we were surprised to find that our discoveries had made headline news in the Irish Independent, and many other newspapers carried major articles. The story was also featured on radio and television news. Congratulations poured in all week; we had captured the imagination and support of not only the general public but also some professional astronomers and other specialists. Archaeologists closed ranks and publicly maintained a wall of silence. After our first venture into the field we were prepared to present our evidence, but no archaeologists ap proached us, not even privately. We did not know if they had valid criticisms to make or merely resented our intrusion into what they considered was their private domain. We wondered too if the full implications of our discoveries had been understood. Surely it was obvious that, if two of the major mounds investigated so far were solar constructs, others might be designed on similar principles? Regardless of the lack of response from archaeologists, Jack and I had achieved a major victory in awakening public interest and awareness of our megalithic cultural heritage. Newly introduced methods of farming are rapidly destroying many smaller unprotected sites, and we are deeply concerned about the alarming increase in wanton destruction. By publiciz ing the cultural achievements of the past one is at least going part of the way to protecting the sites.

The second light
Lunar observations during the summer of 1980
One of the more positive results of the publicity was that it put us in touch with professional astronomers and specialists abroad. Several of them wrote to us during the course of the year. Receiving communications from professionals in no way implies that they immediately accepted any of our claims. We were artists who had entered the new and complex field of archaeoastronomy in the process of doing art research. But as artists we were very much encouraged by the fact that our work was taken seriously by scientists. The letters we received were neither for nor against our conclusions, but they were immensely helpful in that they showed us how much interest there was amongst modern astronomers in the astronomy of the Neolithic period. Derek M cN ally, Assistant Director at the University of London Observatory, wrote, ‘M y interest in positional astronomy is kept alive by its possible application in the field of archaeo-astronomy’ . One of the first specialists to contact us was Alexander Marshack of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Not all professional researchers, it seemed, were prepared to dismiss our finds without further enquiry. Professor P. Q. Wayman, of Dunsink Observatory outside Dublin, wrote to us regarding our method of direct observation: ‘This approach has certain strengths and weaknesses. It is the strength of these observations that they carry conviction without the need either to make or to comprehend the detailed survey of the site or to establish the relatively abstract connection with the celestial sphere (which tends to be only properly understood by astronomers, surveyors and navigators, but which, in fact, is really quite straightforward). It is also the strength of this method that it presents a visualizable, impressive picture to a person witnessing it. This approach, however, has the disadvantage (a) that suitable weather conditions may not be adequately frequent; (b) that it is necessary to wait for the particular time of the year before progressing with the unravelling of the data.’ It was these disadvantages, particularly the need to wait for the right time of year, that caused us to refine our method by including lunar observations in our programme. We had considered them before, but had not realized their potential for indicating solar positions at various times of the year. Our main problem after the spring equinox observations at Cairn T was that two key major mounds, Cairn L and Dowth, were obviously aligned to the rising sun sometime in the winter months. A number of important smaller mounds were also obviously winter alignments. Our concern was primarily with the major mounds: we had already begun to
51



suspect that they were aligned to indicate the most critical dates and that the smaller satellite mounds had supplementary functions. The two large complexes of the Boyne Valley and Loughcrew contained only five major mounds. The astronomical significance of two of them, Cairn T and Newgrange, was already known. Knowth was almost certainly aligned to the equinox. It was only Cairn L and Dowth that remained a mystery, and the only way they could be studied through observation during the summer months was by using the silvery light of the moon. The first observations of the behaviour of moonlight inside the chamber of a passage mound were made on the night of i April, just ten days after our equinox findings. We were back at Cairn '1' waiting to observe the rising of the full moon, just as we had attempted on i March to see the sunrise, except that this time we had some idea of what to expect and the weather was now in our favour. In order to illuminate the chamber of a passage mound aligned on or near the horizon the full moon must rise after the sun sets. I f the sun has not yet set the sky will still be very bright and the moonbeam will not project into the chamber. Usually it is on the night after the full moon that these conditions are fulfilled, and so it was on i April. On that night the declination of the moon was 2° 36', which closely corresponded to the sun’s declination (2033') on 14 March. In other words we had an opportunity to get a good idea of what happened in the chamber six days before equinox, and this allowed us to check our estimates. The first thing we noticed was that observing moonbeams is quite diiferent from observing sunbeams. Before the sun rises the sky begins to brighten in the east and diffused light enters the chamber. On the night of i April we sat in total darkness. We were surprised by the sudden appearance of a mysterious thin shaft of silvery white light which penetrated the passage and created a glowing patch of brightness on one of the chamber stones. We watched in amazement as the size of the patch of light diminished rapidly until it disappeared before our eyes. It was like an apparition, and we were grateful that David O’ Hehir was present to photograph it (p. 99), as it was singularly the strangest and yet most beautiful event we had witnessed inside a passage mound. After that I never doubted that, whatever the achievements of the megalith builders in the field of astronomy, the structures they built had a strong element of ritual observation in their function. The entire event took less than twenty minutes, whereas the sunbeam had appeared in the chamber for over one hour. The position of the moon’s beam on chamber stone 6, to the right of the backstone, clearly demonstrated that six days prior to the equinox the sun’s beam would still be far away from the backstone, contradicting our original estimate that it would fall on the stone by that stage. Light would not start directly illuminating the backstone until about four days before the equinox, which implied that as a solar construct the mound was even more sensitive than we had thought. Soon we were prepared to start using lunar observation as a means of estimating what we would expect to occur during the winter months, when
52



most of the mounds go into operation. By this time we had reason to suspect that virtually all the mounds in the Boyne Valley and at Loughcrew were solar constructs. Around the time of summer solstice the full moon would rise approximately in the same position on the horizon as the sun at winter solstice. Thus it would be possible to determine if Cairn L could represent a solstitial alignment. In order to examine all the possible alignments we needed more recruits. We made plans to put four teams in the field. Jack and his group would be at Cairn L , Sheila Lindsay and her group would be at Tara. I would go to Newgrange with David O’ Hehir and another group. Cairn U would be checked by a recent recruit from the United States, David Wollner, who had no previous knowledge of astronomy or archaeology but, like Jack, had tremendous determination and an inquisitive mind. The night of 29 June was overcast except for a narrow area that stretched along the horizon. This break in the clouds directly above the horizon was essentially all that we required. The appearance of moonbeams on the backstone of a passage mound is the result of a complex lunar cycle known as the Saros Cycle. Whereas the sun repeats its cycle exactly every year, the moon’ s more erratic movements are duplicated in a period of 18.6 years. I knew that the moon’ s beams could not directly enter the chamber of Newgrange until June 1983, but I was still interested in seeing a partial entrance of moonlight into the passage and comparing this with data collected by the other teams. David O’Hehir photographed the rising moon as it was seen that night through the roof-box of Newgrange. At all the other sites the teams reported that the moonrise was far to the right of the intended alignment. On the night of 28 Ju ly the same teams were used to monitor the same sites, except that I accompanied Jack to Cairn L. The moonrise on that night was closer, but still out of range of all the passages. It was not until the moon rose on the night of 26 August that moonlight streamed in, flooding the chambers of all three mounds (Cairns L and U and Tara). The position of the moonbeams indicated that the alignments were directed to the position of the rising sun on or near the cross-quarter day in November, and that consequently these structures defined the commence ment of winter and were probably used again on the cross-quarter day in February to mark the beginning of spring. The calendar in operation during the Neolithic period was basically the division of the year by solar observation into eight parts, determined by equinoxes, solstices and the cross-quarter days. Local tradition regarding the function of these mounds, as first reported by Vallancey and Beaufort, was essentially correct. Early in the twentieth century the astronomer, Sir Norman Lockyer, had explained the eight-part calendar fully and noted its use in megalithic orientations. He had also pointed out as far back as 1909 the alignment of Newgrange to the winter solstice. These mounds are not as mysterious as they seem. A fourth passage, the largest of two at Dowth, might also have been on our list of cross-quarter day alignments (to the setting sun in November),
53



had Lockyer been taken more seriously in his day. Instead, twentiethcentury archaeological reconstruction has completely ignored any possible astronomical function, a modern artificial entrance has been built and the original entrance sealed like a tomb. A reconstruction that ignores the possible astronomical importance of a passage mound is no more nor less than an act of vandalism. The series of lunar observations during the summer served a very useful purpose in giving us an insight into the totality of the Neolithic system of time reckoning without having to wait until we could make solar observ ations in the winter (although later we were able to make these winter observations). One of the things that fascinated us about these latest observations was the possible role of the megalithic mound in com municating calendrical information to the population. This idea was also derived from local tradition by Vallancey and Beaufort, and again it was advanced separately by Lockyer. Such a system may have been quite elaborate, and could explain the relationship of the mounds to each other and in relation to the landscape. A beacon lit from the top of Loughcrew could have been seen throughout much of the island. Many of the mounds are intervisible, and Tara is in a central position from which the Boyne Valley complex and the Loughcrew complex can both be viewed. In this context it is interesting that Tara was in fact the location of central rule and authority in Celtic Ireland. The lighting of fires at Tara is well documented in ancient Irish history and lore, as is its connection with the cross-quarter day in November. Another interesting problem posed by our latest observations was determining whether or not the lunar orientations were deliberate in the way that the solar ones seemed to be. One primary reason for believing that they were was admittedly subjective. The sight of the moon’ s beams entering the chamber of a megalithic structure is even today a highly dramatic and impressive spectacle, and it seems difficult to imagine how the builders could have missed the phenomenon themselves. The present caretaker of Newgrange, Michael Smith, told me that for years he had recognized the possibility that moonlight might periodically enter the chamber without having any technical knowledge of astronomy. Provided that the moonbeams are observed over a long period of time, it is also hard not to notice the repetition of patterns over an 1 8.6-year period. Gavrinis, a passage mound in Brittany, appears to be aligned primarily to an extreme rising position of the moon, and its winter solstice solar alignment seems to be an important but secondary consideration. Perhaps the strongest evidence in support of the lunar as well as solar function comes from the rock engravings adorning the mounds. These display an intense concern with the moon and its phases (p. I 3 5 f f . j . When one considers the size and number of astronomically orientated Neolithic mounds, together with the pronounced luni-solar character of many of the rock engravings, it seems to be flying in the face of the evidence to suppose that these early astronomers were not somehow involved in observing the intricate yet predictable movements of the moon.

The realms of light
Solar observations during the summer of
1980 and the autumnal equinox at Knowth
While we were making lunar observations at night we continued to make solar observations in ever increasing numbers during the day. Prior to summer solstice, Garreth Williams, who was a member of the team monitoring Tara, reported a possible solstitial alignment of mounds on Carnbane East, Loughcrew. This was a direct alignment of four mounds to summer solstice sunrise. Jack and I confirmed the alignment on the morning of 2 1 June, and then went over to the Boyne Valley to observe a similar alignment of three mounds that included Knowth and Newgrange and the summer solstice setting sun. Meanwhile, Toby Hall reported a summer solstice solar construct at Sess Kilgreen in Co. Tyrone. After summer solstice Jack and I started making regular solar observ ations at Loughcrew. We waited for the sun to come within range of a series of satellite mounds that seemed to operate in a continuous sequential pattern. This was totally unexpected, as we had been thinking in simple terms of individual mounds indicating single special events. The concept of systematic continuous daily observation of the sun for an extended period of time by satellite mounds had not occurred to us. The fact is that from the cross-quarter day in August until the autumnal equinox, remaining mounds on Loughcrew chart the apparent movement of the sun on the horizon. The interesting point about this series of three satellite mounds and Cairn T is that the sequence follows the apparent movement of the sun in precise order, which indicates that the alignments must be intentional and pre-determined. On the evening of 1 August the rays of the setting sun began to rest on the backstone of Cairn S, a satellite of Cairn T on Carnbane East. Further observations indicated that this Y-shaped construct was aligned to the setting sun on or very near the cross-quarter day on 8 August. In the mornings we were watching sunrises from Cairn F, a satellite of Cairn L on Carnbane West. When the sun was out of alignment with Cairn S in the evenings it came into alignment with Cairn F in the mornings. On the backstone of Cairn F a Neolithic artist had engraved a circle with extending radial lines and a series of crescents. These we now recognized as universal and ancient symbols of the sun and moon. In August mists frequently form on the mountains and although this sometimes causes spectacular rainbows, it means one never quite knows when the skies will be clear. Our pre-dawn excursions were therefore frequent. When September came, the rays of the rising sun left Cairn F and began entering Cairn I, which is aligned to Cairn T on the horizon.
55



This warned of the approach of the autumnal equinox. By 18 September the rising sun’ s rays would shift from the backstone of Cairn I and begin to appear on the backstone of Cairn T four days prior to the equinox. Jack went to West Cork early in September and arranged to be back in time for the autumnal equinox on 22 September. David Wollner had taken up temporary residence in the Boyne Valley, and together we continued the field research, which was now mainly monitoring Cairn I at sunrise and documenting the megalithic art of Loughcrew. David developed a deep interest in megalithic art from working at Loughcrew, and I showed him some of the documentation for the art of Knowth. Compared with Loughcrew, the megalithic art of Knowth is monu mental and spectacular. I explained that it first saw the light of day when Macalister began excavating the kerbstones around this gigantic mound in 1940. Macalister did rough but useful illustrations and then re-buried the stones. Now the stones are being re-excavated, but not fully uncovered. Knowth is strictly in the domain of archaeologists. It is completely sealed off from the enquiring eyes of independent researchers by a high fence topped with barbed wire. Inside, the mound is in the process of being cut apart like a layer cake, while its magnificent art treasures lie covered up under sheets of black plastic. Perhaps the comparative obscurity of megalithic art today is due to the fact that at Knowth some of its greatest examples remain quite literally cloaked in secrecy. David was amazed that I had succeeded in documenting most of the art at Knowth in spite of the veil of secrecy. It had taken me about two years, and I had had to engage in painstaking archaeological espionage. Using Macalister’ s drawings, old photographs, aerial photographs and my own observations of the site at a distance with binoculars I had slowly pieced together the parts of the mosaic. I had also become almost certain that the two passages at Knowth were aligned to both the sunrise and sunset at equinox. These passages are each about twice the size of the one at Newgrange, and would represent the largest and most impressive solar constructs known. As obvious and as blatant as these alignments seemed to be, it was unlikely that archaeologists would consider them anything other than tombs. In desperation I had telephoned an archaeologist requesting that the astronomical possibilities be investigated prior to reconstruction. I was informed that both passages were blocked up and that no observations would be possible. I naively accepted this explanation and, embarrassed by my apparent lack of information, apologized for enquiring. Like most people, David had not been aware of the existence of Knowth and was curious about this unusual situation. He advised that I should keep to my own criteria for research, and at least attempt some preliminary observations this equinox. I explained that I had considered this myself, but felt the idea to be impractical. Even if the barbed wire fence were negotiated, once inside there would be nothing to see, because everything is sealed and meticulously covered over. In any case, the main purpose of our research was simply to determine the context of megalithic art so that
56



we could understand it better. I argued, moreover, that on the evidence of Cairn T Knowth must be an even more advanced solar construct indicating the equinox, an assumption supported by the presence of accurate engraved sundials at the Boyne site, as well as art compositions that were clearly based on astronomical themes. While I agreed that the entrance of the sun’s rays into such an enormous mound would be a spectacular event, I was already quite certain that it would happen. Wollner was persistent and persuasive, however, and when we left our work at Loughcrew on Saturday 13 September, instead of going to the house we made a detour towards Knowth. We parked the car a good distance from the site and made our way silently through the fields until we reached a clump of woods north of the mound. From our vantage point we peered into the compound. As usual it looked like a top security prison. The majestic mound towered above its sixteen satellites, still retaining some of its Neolithic splendour. There was no one around and we were awed by the silence. Then I noticed something I had not seen in years. Much of the western side of the mound, including the entrance to the passage, was completely exposed. I could hardly believe what I was seeing through the binoculars. As the sun was setting a standing stone was beginning to cast its shadow on the entrance stone of the passage (p. 101). We had no idea how archaeologists were going to reconstruct the entrances of the passages at Knowth, but for all we knew they could end up sealed like one of the passages at Dowth. Before us lay what might be our last chance to see the Knowth solar construct in operation. Jack and I had always felt that the responsibility for awakening an entirely new approach to Irish megalithic culture rested firmly on our shoulders. We welcomed archaeological criticism, but we regarded it as completely unfair to prohibit access to critical data while at the same time vehemently maintaining that our approach was ‘speculative’ . We were not vandals or treasure-seekers, we were serious researchers. I f we were forced to gain information by scaling over barriers and obstacles placed in our path by archaeologists, we were bound to do so. With these thoughts firmly planted in my mind, I indicated to David that we were ready to move in. We quickly and silently negotiated the fence and cautiously manoeuvred to the entrance of the passage, noting the position of the shadow on the entrance stone before crawling in. I nside, the narrow passage had partially collapsed, so that in some places the inclining stones left barely enough room for a thin person to squirm through, provided that arms and legs were fully extended and the person did not suffer from claustrophobia. I finally came to a section where there was enough room to look back. I was wondering how David was doing, when momentarily I was blinded by a brilliant flash of light. As I crawled further I noticed that, as long as David was not squeezing through a particularly narrow section of the passage, the light would come through. Deep back in the passage the beam was reduced to a narrow chink of light about 1 in. wide. It did not quite reach the stone basin at the elbow of the passage. The sun was beginning to set and we now had to move very quickly. I left David
57



to monitor the light beam and myself went outside to see what the shadow was doing. The entrance stone at Knowth has a vertical line engraved on it very similar to the one on the entrance stone at Newgrange. As the sun set the shadow of the standing stone inched away from the vertical line. The final shadow position on that day was to the right of the vertical line, but, as equinox approached (it was due in nine days time), the shadow position would gradually draw closer to the vertical line. I had suspected for some time that the standing stone outside the entrance of Newgrange projected a shadow on to the entrance stone at winter solstice and now I was convinced of it. Knowth, like Newgrange, was a complex solar construct that indicated time internally by means of a beam of light and externally by the clever use of shadow. David crawled out of the mound and we looked at each other with the knowing feeling that we had just witnessed a remarkable event. We crouched down behind the entrance stone and waited in silence for the sky to darken. When night descended we crept out to the fields and back to the car. We telephoned Jack in West Cork and told him about what had happened. We also explained that at Loughcrew the beam of light from the rising sun was beginning to move off the backstone of Cairn I and would soon be illuminating the backstone of Cairn T. At the same time we would have to see what happened during the sunrise at Knowth. We thought that either the passages would be sealed on Monday or, if not, the archaeol ogists would have planned to observe the event themselves. We had no camera, we needed more observers and transportation, and the weather outlook was bad. Jack said that it would be difficult for him to come immediately, but he would try. The next morning was Sunday and in the darkness before dawn we again slipped back into Knowth to observe the sunrise from the eastern passage, directly opposite the passage marking the sunset. The sky was cloudy, but in the early morning light it was clear that for the present the view of the horizon from the eastern passage was completely obscured by the current ground level, debris and clumps of trees. We spent the rest of the day at Loughcrew waiting for a break in the weather. Unlike the situation at Cairn T the previous spring, we now had enough experience in dialling to discern an equinoctial alignment on the basis of a single observation. It was still, however, eight days before autumnal equinox, and if possible we wanted to make an observation closer to equinox and photograph it. The break in the weather came on Tuesday morning 16 September, six days before equinox. At Cairn I a narrow strip of the edge of the backstone, 6 in. wide, was illuminated by the sunrise. Wollner in Cairn T observed that the sunbeam was not yet striking the backstone. It was a glorious morning and our thoughts focused on Knowth and the sunset. We needed a photographer. In the afternoon we reviewed our situation over cups of coffee in the Conyngham Arms Hotel in Slane. Ironically, still hanging on the wall was the framed calendar depicting the entrance of Newgrange
58



and under it the words that archaeologists had mocked so confidently fifteen years before, ‘The rays of the rising sun at certain times of year penetrate the opening. . . Next to it were photographs of some rock engravings at Knowth. These were being studied carefully by a young woman with a camera. Paula M iller was an American on holiday in Ireland. She was interested in megalithic art and fascinated by our project. It was now only six days to the autumnal equinox. The three of us waited until after six o’clock, when no one was likely to be around, before approaching Knowth. From the woods we watched closely and listened for a long time before venturing into the compound. The same silence permeated the site and we were surprised that the entrance remained open. Paula was to photograph the beam of light in the passage while I monitored the shadows of the standing stone. David would communicate back and forth between us and maintain a look out for any sudden invasions of our privacy. We were nervous, but the work proceeded systematically and methodically. From 6 .15 p.m. until the sunset at 7.30 p.m. we photographed, sketched and measured the lights and shadows. We then watched the shadow of night descend and, when the first glimmering stars appeared, we made our way across the fields. Behind us loomed the majestic mound. Back at the house we compared the new data with data collected during our previous observation. As equinox approached the shadow moved closer to the vertical line and the beam of light penetrated the chamber. Knowth presents remarkably convincing evidence for a deliberate megal ithic astronomical orientation. Furthermore, it represents the largest solar construct of its type in Europe, and there are no other passages even remotely approaching it in length. No one, not even a group of specialists, has the right to alter this mound in any way other than to restore it to its original form, and certainly no one is justified in hiding or darkening its light.
59



The triumph of the light
Solar observations during the winter of 1980
Jack finally arrived in Dublin on the evening of Saturday 20 September. That afternoon, John Michell, whose work on megalithic science and the origins and use of old stone monuments had deeply impressed Jack and me, had arrived from London. Although many professional researchers had expressed an interest in our project, Michell was the first actually to come and investigate the phenomena by first-hand observation at the sites. That evening an excited Wollner, who had remained in the Boyne Valley, came down to report that in the afternoon workers had sealed the passage at Knowth and covered the stones. It was now clear that the excavators either did not know about the light or, if they did, did not want it to be studied, by themselves or anyone else. We discussed the implications of this new turn of events. After our wellpublicized finds at Cairn T during the spring equinox, many archaeol ogists had tried to discredit our research. They insisted that the mounds were nothing more than mere tombs. However, the combined data from Newgrange, Cairn T and now Knowth clearly demonstrated, it seemed to us, that they were making an enormous assumption and that they were wrong. Traditionalists in Irish archaeology try to explain the passagemound phenomenon as the result of cemetery-building invading colon ists, who arrived from the continent and gradually spread to the west of Ireland after creating a giant necropolis in the Boyne Valley. As late as 1977 Herity and Eogan could state confidently in their book, Ireland in Prehistory, that ‘About 2500 b c , the Passage Grave builders arrived in the Irish Sea from Brittany, and built their first tombs . . .’ We seriously doubted both the tomb theory and the invasion theory, and new voices in Irish archaeology were tending to support us. Presently, there is a revolution in Irish prehistory that has come about so suddenly that the implications of the new findings have yet to be assessed. Mesolithic hunters and gatherers, who represented Ireland’s first settlers, were once thought to be nothing more than hungry strandloopers, unable to penetrate the island interior and able to do little more than scavenge a living along the shoreline about 6000 b c . Recent excavations carried out by Peter Woodman in the north and Michael Ryan in the very centre of the island, however, show that Mesolithic communities with substantial material equipment were flourishing in the interior by 7000 b c , or about 9,000 years ago. Goran Burenhult of Sweden uncovered an even earlier Mesolithic presence, dating back to 7500 b c , at Carrowmore in the far western extreme of the country. These are the earliest known habitation
60



sites in Ireland, and they completely overturn the old notion that man first entered Ireland on the east coast after a short sea crossing from Britain. Also overturned is the idea that the passage tombs originated in the east and spread westwards. The megalithic complex at Carrowmore excavated by the Swedes gave radiocarbon dates in the region of 4200 b c for the earliest structure, a thousand years before the construction of Newgrange. There were no burials at this level. All the evidence pointed towards an indigenous origin for megaliths, with an evolution from simple (Car rowmore) to complex (Boyne Valley). Moreover, the techniques of engraving at Loughcrew suggested to us that the mounds there came somewhere in the middle of this sequence. Then, if the mounds were used primarily as tombs, where were the radiocarbon dates from human bones found in the mounds to prove it? No dates have been forthcoming so far. Some support for our attitude towards the monuments comes in a recent book by Elizabeth Shee-Twohig, The Megalithic Art of Western Europe (1981). ‘Remarkably little study has been done on the burials from megalithic tombs’ , she writes. ‘The size and sophistication of many of the monuments generally exceeded what would be required if they were built merely as burial places. It seems reasonable to conclude that they fulfilled some further role in society.’ In
The illustration depicts in the foreground the remains o f mound 7 at Carrowmore. On the horizon, ‘M a e v e ’s C a irn ’ and some satellites are seen on the top o f the Knocknarea M ou n tain , which overlooks the A tlantic Ocean. The Carrowmore site included between 65 and #5 structures in the mid-nineteenth century. O riginally it is thought to have contained twice that number. It remains one o f the largest concentrations o f megalithic sites in Europe, but now many structures are disappearing because o f extensive quarrying in the area. U ntil recently Carrowmore was considered a late site, representing the fin a l phase of megalithic expansion to the west coast o f Ireland. Completely overturning this model, G oran Burenhult has recently produced two well-related radiocarbon dates placing Carrowmore at the very beginnings of the Irish megalithic tradition, and establishing it as one of the earliest megalithic areas in Europe, ante dated only by a fe w Breton dolmens.



Malta, she explains, ‘excavation has shown that the megalithic temples of the third millennium were not used for burial but for some other purpose’ . Moreover, ‘at Dissignac, Loire-Atlantique, the eastern passage grave is orientated on sunrise at the winter solstice’ . This is not the only description we have come across of an astronomical alignment in a continental passage mound. Even if radiocarbon-dated evidence of primary burials is eventually produced, the mounds cannot be simply regarded as tombs, and any burial function can easily be accommodated as part of a wider range of purposes and meanings. Thwarted in our attempt to observe the autumnal equinox at Knowth, in the early hours of the morning of 22 September our research team (together with John Michell) set out to view it at Cairn T , Loughcrew. During the autumnal equinox the sun rises at a much lower angle than it does at the spring equinox, and as a result the patch of light in Cairn T is longer and thinner. But autumnal equinox is just as dramatic as spring, and the beam of light matches the rock engravings on the backstone equally well. We had in Cairn T without doubt recognized an accurate solar chronometer which measured both spring and autumnal equinoxes precisely and would continue to do so perpetually. John Michell was deeply impressed. Much earlier he had written that ‘Archaeology, which aspires to the status of a science in the modern, materialistic sense of the word, is ill equipped to investigate the stone instruments of the earlier, more comprehensive system, whose secrets cannot be excavated along with the bones and potsherds, but must be sought through the study of the megalithic science, the way which the arts of astronomy, architecture, numerology and every other branch of knowledge were united in one system to serve a common purpose.’ Michell returned to London with additional material for one of his most critical books on archaeology, Megalithomania (1982). We were also saddened to say goodbye to David Wollner, who will be remembered for his exploits at Knowth. During this period it seemed that every time we went into the field we came back with new and exciting findings. On 25 September Jack and I intended to make routine moonrise observations at Loughcrew. We spent the afternoon at the Ballinvally stone circle at the foot of the Loughcrew Mountains. In a heap of stones piled near the circle I noticed a beautifully engraved stone on top of the pile. Further examination revealed a holed standing stone in the same pile. It seemed extraordinary that these stones could have escaped the attention of generations of archaeologists. Later in the year, largely as the result of our discovery, the Ballinvally site was declared an official national monument, but our far more important finds were still being ignored. Megalithic studies have been described as a war of ideas, but it is not understood that there are real casualties and many megalithic structures are being totally destroyed while researchers debate whether or not the light entering Newgrange is intentional and, if so, what effects minor changes in the obliquity of the ecliptic might have on the light beam.

Ballinvally, loose stones, found in September 1981.
Archaeologists do not seem to be aware of the fact that at the beginning of this century, the only real protection the mounds had was the belief in the minds of ordinary people that vandalism would be swiftly revenged by spirits known as fairies. The disappearance of the fairies opened the way to large scale destruction. The results are disastrous. We have already destroyed an estimated 60 per cent of the archaeological monuments in Cork, 44 per cent in Kerry, 40 per cent in Antrim, 3 1 per cent in Tipperary and 29 per cent in Donegal. At this rate there will be very few possible astronomical alignments left to argue a war of ideas. With the coming of the cross-quarter day at the beginning of November, the light of the rising sun began pouring in at Cairn L , Cairn U, and Tara. A satellite mound of Cairn L , designated Cairn H, provided a warning for this important date which marked the commencement of winter, very much in the same way that Cairn I was linked to Cairn T and warned of the approach of equinox. By far the most spectacular of these observations was the illumination of the white standing stone inside Cairn L , just as the disc of the rising sun appeared above Cairn M. Now, all five major mounds in the two complexes had been shown to be astronomically orientated and only the second chamber at Dowth (Dowth 2) remained to be investigated. In addition, every satellite mound we had
63



examined had without exception demonstrated a specific astronomical function. We had also identified a type of smaller supplementary satellite mound aligned due south, which marked the sun’s passing of the meridian at midday. These are extremely obvious astronomical alignments, as is an alignment that is oriented due north, such as the construct at Baltinglass, Co. Wicklow. This type of construct demonstrates a concern with the stars, and was first noticed by Lockyer. Had our findings come as a complete surprise to archaeologists there might have been some excuse for ignoring them, but Lockyer had in fact anticipated most of them and directly addressed archaeologists in his book, Stonehenge and other British Stone Monuments Astronomically Considered (2nd edition 1909), in which he called attention to the astronomical orientation of Newgrange. Referring to megalithic constructs he wrote: ‘We made out that in the case of the temples devoted to sun-worship and to the determination of the length of the year, there was very good reason why all these attempts should be made to cut off the light, by diaphragms and stone ceilings, because, among other things one wanted to find the precise point occupied by the sunbeam in order to determine the exact day of the solstice.’ Lockyer distinguished between star temples and sun temples, and said that these earliest astronomers ‘used starlight at night for some of their observations, very much like they used sunlight during the day’ . He concluded that ‘The ancient priest need not have been a profound astronomer to build the monuments, which were simply calendars. I do not mean to say they were calendars and nothing more, but they were, from an astronomical point of view, simply calendars, enabling people to know and recognize from past experience the different parts of the year by the place of sunrise and sunset; and they were also night-dials, enabling them to differentiate between the early and the late hours of the night.’ Another intriguing and surprising find came towards the end of the year at Dowth. As winter solstice approached we gradually came to accept the possibility that Dowth 2 was aligned to the position of the setting sun at winter solstice. The realization came gradually because we found it difficult to believe that observers who had witnessed the rising sun’s rays enter Newgrange could have failed to notice the rays of the setting sun entering Dowth on the same day. I had lived directly beside Dowth and cannot explain how I failed to recognize this. Perhaps it was because a hedge had blocked the view of both the horizon and Newgrange from inside the chamber. The hedge had been there for some 300 years, and after preliminary observations on 13 and 14 December we requested the Board of Works to remove it and let the light in. This they did. On 20 December, the evening before the winter solstice, we succeeded in taking photographs of the light streaming in at Dowth 2, half an hour before the sun sank below a bank of clouds. This event got widespread newspaper and radio coverage. It surprised archaeologists too, although they surprised us when Professor Herity called the findings ‘of worldshattering significance, if true’ . In fact, the strategy of synchronized alignments employed at Newgrange and Dowth replicates the similar
64



strategy at Knowth, which we had not publicized. These sets of alignments together show that at particularly critical times of the year passages are orientated towards both the sunrise and sunset. One practical reason for this might be that, if weather conditions are unfavourable early in the day, there would still be an opportunity to make observations later on. In any event, the astronomy of Newgrange can no longer be discussed realistically without taking into account that it is part of an intricate system which includes Dowth and Knowth. On the day of the winter solstice the rising sun’ s rays entered Newgrange, but cloudy weather in the afternoon prevented the setting sun from entering Dowth. In the morning out entire team was present at Newgrange for the grand celebration of light and measure which was to be our last observation of the year. An unusually large crowd of over 200 people came from all over the country to attend. Jack was inside photographing while I directed my attention to the shadow of the standing stone outside the entrance. An archaeologist had once confidently assured me that the shadow did not strike the entrance stone on winter solstice, but my drawings and elevations of the construct assured me that it did. The similar construct I had seen at Knowth meant to me that the scheme was pre-determined and intentional. The shadow clearly does strike the entrance stone (p. 10 1) and one should beware of hearsay, especially in matters concerning light and shadow. After a full year of research in the field we had returned again to Newgrange on the shortest day of the year. We had completed a circuit that formed a gigantic calendar in stone. As artists we had explored a path that led us into many dark recesses of megalithic mounds. We found our way was always illuminated by the light of the sun, the moon and the stars. The mounds are not riddles or follies, they are a living testimony to the indomitable spirit of a Stone Age people, who built not only for themselves, but for future generations. I am not ashamed to admit that our explorations were first inspired by intuitive feelings; our research did have a solid scientific basis, involving direct empirical observations, all of which are repeatable. An artist’s mind and eye is trained to search for more than a superficial meaning in the works of other more ancient artists. We should recall that the world did not first hear of the light at Newgrange from an astronomer or an archaeologist, but from the artist and mystic poet, George Russell, who asked, ‘What secret lies behind the lovely light?’ It was Russell’s fellow poet and friend, James Stephens, who once wrote, ‘The crown of life is not lodged in the sun. The wise gods buried it deeply where the thoughtful will not find it, nor the good. But the joyous ones, the adventurous ones, the careless plungers, they will bring it to the wise and astonish them. All things are seen in the light - how shall we value that which is easy to see?’

Newgrange after reconstruction.
The Boyne Valley com plex
‘T h e m ighty barrow s by the banks o f the B oyn e’ have for a long time been considered some o f the m ost im portant prehistoric sites in the world. T h e y represent the pinnacle of the Neolithic achievement and constitute one o f the most impressive displays of Stone Age grandeur known. W hen all sim ilar sites are com pared one m u st con clu d e that it w as in the B o y n e V a lle y that N eolithic culture m ade its most am bitious and com preh ensive statem ents in stone. T h e m ap show s the area in the im m ediate vicinity o f the three m ajor m ounds, K n o w th , D ow th, and Newgrange. Not included are the satellite m ounds o f K n ow th , which are currently being excavated. T h e m ap is based on a su rvey by D r Jo n Patrick, in w hich the m ounds were co ordinated by empirical photogram m etric pro cedures. F rom the data, Patrick concluded that ‘there is evidence that som e lines are deliberately orientated on solar phenom ena’, and he also pointed out lunar alignments. Independently, our own research team had recognized the solar lines by direct observation. W e also noted that the alig n m en t H , G , F , E and N e w g ra n g e is orientated towards sunset on the N ovem ber and February cross-quarter days. T h e cross-quarter day alignm ent is im portant
b ecau se it c o r r e s p o n d s to the solar lig h t-b e a m alignm ent o f the m ain passage at D o w th . T h u s , side by side, there are two types of alignment indicating the same date: a solar construct w ithin a m ound, and an arrangem ent of solarorientated m ounds in the im m ediate vicinity. Patrick’s bearings for the five aligned m ounds are E - F 66 58', E -H 67 17 ', N e w g ran g e-F 67 43', N ew grange-H 67 50', and N ew grangeE 68 27'. Patrick m ade a determ ination o f the probability level at w hich parts o f the proposed design plan could occur by chance and noted ‘a rather large proportion of coincidences for a random distribution of points’. He concluded finally that ‘ It has been show n that the Boyne V alley m onu m ents are pro b ab ly laid out to a design plan.’ T h e m ap of the external design plan of the com plex demonstrates a concern with solstices, equinoxes and cross-quarter days. O ur own investigations took us into the interior of the m ounds, where we found solar constructs with a similar concern but even more obviously inten tional. I have divided our findings into groups which indicate these three fundam ental divi sions o f the year. A ll the m ajor m ou nds, and the vast m ajority o f m ou nds in general, fall into these groups but I also include types of m ounds that align south to the m id d ay sun and north to the stars.

(Above) The sun's rays enter the chamber at Newgrange when the fu ll disc of the sun appears above the horizon at 8.$8 a.m. This photograph was taken on 2 1 December at 8.56 a.m., just moments before the light beam entered the mound. The sun will rise at an angle towards the right which places it in alignment zvith Newgrange. The line of the horizon is formed by a hill knozun as the
Redmountain. (Below) Kerbstone 5 2 echoes pat terns on the entrance stone and has an even more pronounced vertical line. O f ninety-seven kerb stones only three are fu lly engraved, and their astronomical positioning is highly significant. It is difficult to imagine how an astronomical alignment could be more explicitly expressed.



(Above) From inside the passage at Newgrange the rising sun shines through the roof-box. Outside the entrance, standing stone i aligns along its left edge with the vertical line on the entrance stone and the shadow of the winter solstice sun.
( Belozv) An early photograph of the roof-box. The lintel stone first began to be noticed in the last century. Excavators at that time tried and failed to remove it with crozvbars, in order to fin d out what it zvas.
74



A cut-away illustration shows the solar construct at Nezvgrange as revealed by modern excavation. The structure is designed to house a narrow aperture 40 in. wide by 9 in. high. The light beam enters a narrow slit bet ween roof-slabs / and 2. The
lintel and corbel protect the diaphragm and keep it dry. Some of the stones are grooved to drain off water. Engravings on the lintel and the back of the corbel actually appear in the context of a solar construct.



The Newgrange elevation shows the right side of the passage and chamber. A stream of light comes directly through the entrance and extends fa r back into the passage. The purpose of the roof-box is to
allow a narrow beam of light to project into the end recess. A fter reaching the end recess, R 2 1 narrows the beam of light until it is cut offfrom the chamber at 9 .15 a.m.
The back of the corbel supporting the roof-box lintel is engraved with art that could not have been seen once the mound was completed. This 'hidden' art contrasts with the 'display'form exemplified on the entrance stone. Nevertheless, 'hidden' art at Newgrange is invariably positioned with reference to astronomical considerations.
An engraving on the right of the stone suggests the basic structuring of a sundial. Not a dial that zvas ever intended to function, but a dial as symbol of the sun. The image of the sundial is imprinted on a real practical dial - the megalilhic structure itself. Time at Nezvgrange is both measured and symbolized.
76



The early photograph below shows, from right to left, standing stones 2,i , 1 1 and 12 . Stone 1 casts its long shadow on the entrance stone at winter solstice.



An early photograph of the Newgrange chamber and west recess shows a stone basin in thefloor of the chamber where it was placed at the turn of the
century. This was probably its original position. Now it lies in the east recess where it was found when the passage was excavated.
7»



The Newgrange ground plan shows the light beam striking the base of the backstone in the end recess. Jo n Patrick's survey demonstrated that fo r this to happen the sun's declination must lie betzveen 22 $ 8 'and 2 5 5 3 ', it must be in the azimuth range 1 33 4 2 '- i3 8 2 4 and its elevation must lie bet ween 0 3 1 ' and i 40'. The elevation of the horizon is 0 5 / and a straight line from the back of the chamber to the centre of the roof-box aligns with the spot on the horizon zvhere the sun uses at winter solstice. The unambiguous definition of both the altitude and the direction of the sun means that the event zvould have taken place at the time of construction and zuill continue to occur regardless of slight changes in the tilt of the earth's axis. Patrick concluded that the alignment provided convincing evidence of deliberate orientation on astronomical phenomena.
The photograph shows the beam of light at the chamber entrance. A fter sweeping across the cham ber floor fo r 6 minutes, the beam narrows again at 9.04 a.m.y when it strikes the base of R21, on the right of the photograph. B y 9. / 5 the beam is cut off from the chamber, and fo r the next hour it slowly moves down the right side of the passage.
79



The diagram shows the beam of light entering the Newgrange chamber from the aperture in the roofbox. Light entering from the entrance of the passage extends as fa r back as stone L 19 and illuminates the triple spiral on it. An early photograph (left) shows the engravings on L 19 . The photograph on the right shows light streaming down the passage from both entrance and roof-box aperture on the day of winter solstice. Eleven days before the solstice a chink of light bypasses L 18 and flashes into the chamber. A fter twenty-two days the light is again cut off by L 1 8 , which leans slightly forward. This could have occurred during the mound’s construction, in which case the numbers eleven and twenty-two could have significance as day counts fo r determining the solstice. On L 22 there are eleven rows or sets of markings. On L 19 there are eleven rows of zigzags. Prominent engravings inside the chamber also indicate a count of twenty-two. Thus the engrav ings may have a numerical as well as symbolic significance related to the mound’sfunction in the computation of time.






Winter solstice at Dowth
T h e entrance of D owth faces out towards N ew grange and the horizon beyond. D ow th acts as a synchronized counterpart o f New grange. On the day o f w inter solstice the sun projects its rays into N e w g ra n g e at d a w n and into D o w th at sunset. T h e passage and c h a m b e r at D o w th are about h alf the size o f their N ew gran ge counter parts, but the projected light beam is m uch la r g e r , and it r e m a i n s in the c h a m b e r f o r a lo n g e r period o f time, creating an even more dram atic spectacle. Parallels can be drawn between D owth, and L ou gh crew and K now th, where passages are aligned to both the sunrise and sunset o f a particular astronomical event. At Dowth a large
circle hollowed into the entrance stone marks the position o f the setting sun. T h e entrance stones at D o w th and N e w g r a n g e h ave sim ilarities, but the N ew gran ge one is m ore form alized and clearly a later developm ent in both technique and concept. A second, larger passage at D o w th is also aligned to sunset. T h e original entrance to this passage was sealed during reconstruction. It seem s to m ark the cross-quarter days on 8 N ovem ber and 4 February. T h e three gigantic m ounds in the B oyn e V alley, m ade up o f hun dreds o f thousands o f tons o f material, in fact form a unified system that follows the circuit o f the sun from the autum nal equinox to the spring equinox. It seems that after spring equinox interest shifts to lunar observation.
82



The photograph on the left was taken on 20 December 1980 as the sun's beam penetrates the chamber and moves towards the backstone. The photograph below shozvs the light beam about one hour before sunset as it touches the backstone (6). During the week preceding solstice the beam of light is projected against stone 5 at its entry. At solstice the range of the beam is narrowed tofocus on stone 6. The beam of light moves gradually to stone 7 as the sun begins to set. A t solstice the intense light reflected from stone 6 brilliantly illuminates solar emblems engraved on stone 13 in the large side recess of the chamber. Stone 13 is apparently angled to achieve this effect. The circular solar emblems on this stone and the entrance stone are echoed on a larger scale in the circular arrangement of stones forming the chamber.
83



The photographs show two stages of the moving shaft of light as it appears one day before winter solstice in the Dowth chamber. In the photograph above, the clock indicates 3 p.m. as the light begins to ascend stone 6 A tape measure in the photograph records thefluctuating width of the moving beam of light. The photograph below was taken at 3.23
p.m. By this time the entire chamber and side recess is illuminated by reflected light from stone 6 and the effect is dramatic and awe-inspiring. At 3.30 p.m. the light beam begins to strike stone 7 and reflected light is cut offfrom the side recess. At 4.07 p.m. the sun has set.
84



The engravings in the chamber at Dowth arefo r the most part confined to stones 5 , 6 and 13. These are the chief stones that interact with the beam of light projected into the chamber. The symbolism and imagery of the engravings can therefore be said to
relate directly to the event of the solstice itself. That this connection was deliberate on the part of the engravers is suggested by the juxtaposition in other megalithic mounds of similar incised symbols and astronomical phenomena.
85



The photograph shows the remains of Cairn V in the foreground and Cairn T in the background. The drawing (right) illustrates the stone in the immediate foreground on the right in the photo graph. To judge from the remains, it appears that Cairn V once marked the winter solstice sunrise.

O f the ten discernible m ounds still rem aining on Carnbane East, three are functioning and two are intact enough to enable a reconstruction of their basic astronomical orientation.

T h e full impact of the alignm ent can best be appreciated by standing on top of Cairn T at su m m er solstice sunrise. A s the sun rises a shadow bisects the sky em blem on stone 8 of Cairn U (below), which delineates a line bisect ing Cairns U , T , R 2 and apparently Cairn P i. It seem s that the em blem was incised prior to the roofing o f the m o u n d , w h ich is n o w m issin g. T h e passage o f the m ound is aligned to the N o v e m ber cross-quarter day and will be discussed below in that context.

Sum m er solstice, Sess Kilgreen, Co. Tyrone
As the sun illuminates the emblem at Cairn U , Loughcrew, a similar pattern is being illumi nated 50 miles to the north at Sess Kilgreen in Co. Tyrone in a closely related scheme. T he structure is 10 ft 10 in. long and 7 ft 5 in. wide. T he accuracy and precision of these smaller mounds should not be underestimated. Before the large spectacular passage mounds were built, smaller mounds probably provided efficient and accurate sunbeam dialling for hundreds of years. It should be remembered that although these
m ounds are dw arfed by giants like K n ow th and N ew grange, as sundialling instrum ents they are in fact constructed on a m onum ental scale. T h e central engraved im age at Sess K ilg re en is on stone 6.

The equinox
Equinox at Cairn T, Loughcrew
Equinox literally means ‘equal night’ . In terms of hours, equinox is the date when the hours of day and night are equal. T he two extremes of this arc winter solstice, when the night is long est, and summer solstice, when the night is shortest. In terms of the year, the equinox is midway between these points. Astronomy has never been a simple science. Determining the exact day of the winter solstice requires careful measuring of the beam of light in the chamber as the sun changes position very slowly during the solstice. Near equinox the sun’ s position is changing rapidly, and sightlines need not be as narrow as solstitial sight lines. However, if the sightline is not focused on the horizon it must be orientated to measure the sun’ s beams at two different angles relative to the horizon. At equinox the sun is rising due east to the horizon. Cairn T is orientated about 9 degrees south of this and above the horizon, so that the beam does not enter the mound until the
sun rises to the proper altitude. At the spring eq u in ox the angle o f the su n ’ s path is ve ry high in relation to the horizon, whereas at the au tu m nal eq u in o x the angle o f the ecliptic is lower. T h e s e factors directly affect the size o f the sunbeam, and both of these angles must be considered in order to understand how the mound functions. D am age done to the m ound by partial re construction has fortunately had very little effect on the projected beam of light. T h e erection of a m odern door at the entrance does affect the prelim inary stages, but not the culm ination. C hanges that have taken place over thousands of years in the inclination o f the earth’ s equator to the ecliptic plane o f the earth’s orbit are slight, and are negligible during the equinox. What we are w itn essin g at C airn T essentially resem bles the intended projection o f light and its interac tion with symbol. P erh ap s w hat is m ost im p ressive is the p e rm a nence o f the structure. T h e stones upon which the shadow s fall are fixed in position by closely packed small stones, and stand in silent testi m ony to the skills o f their builders over 5,000 years ago.

A bove, the rising sun at equinox as it appears through the portals of Cairn T. Below, the ground plan of Cairn T takes the form of one of the most
ancient and universal sun symbols known, the ‘equinoctial’ or Greek Cross. The light beam at equinox is focused on stone 14.
91



The symbols on stone 14 in Cairn T may now be interpreted as the language of unknown archaic astronomers. The beam of light from the rising sun at equinox moves down the stone, illuminating key
symbols as it progresses. The arrangement of the engravings in relation to the sunbeam reveals that there is quite precise time reckoning and careful determination of the equinoxes.



At spring equinox the patch of light is centred on the large circular radial sun sign on the right of
stone 14. Above, three days after equinox the light beam is 6 in. below the equinox position.

Spring equinox, Cairn T
At dawn on the spring equinox the sun ’s rays begin grazing off the stones in Cairn T in a progression that culminates in the projection of a narrow shaft of light penetrating the length of the passage and focusing at the very end of the chamber. The interior is dramatically transformed as the beam of light moves slowly along the stones until it reaches stone L3. Trom stone L 3 the light suddenly flashes on to stone 1 4 , where it begins to widen and then descend. I he engravings are an integral part of the interplay between light, stones and shadow. 'The stones become giant gnomons. 'The massive rocks are contrasted with the surprising delicacy of the narrozved shaft of light. The diagram illustrates various phases of the light beam in its journey
through the recesses of the chamber. It progresses from left to right and gradually descends, reflecting the movement of the rising sun. It is the beam of light itself whichfinally and conclusively identifies the inscriptions as solar symbols. Moreover, the huge stones of the entrance and passage shape the light beam into a fa irly regular geometric form. The rectangle of light disintegrates in the process of moving away from stone 14 , on the left of the diagram. During this phase, reflected light il luminates the solar system on the lower left of stone 14. A fter disintegration, the rectangular shape reconstructs itself on stone 6 on the right of the diagram. The entire sequence has as its focus the emble matic solar symbol reproduced on the opposite page.

Autumnal equinox, Cairn T
This sequence of photographs was taken on the day of the autumnal equinox, 22 September 1980. It was observed that by 16 September the sun's rays were leaving Cairn I and beginning to enter Cairn T. On the equinox the sun rises at 7.1 / a.m. Light immediately streams into the passage, but does not strike the back stone until 7.46 a.m. It lakes 29 minutesfo r the patch of light to cross the backstone, moving at a rate of 1 minute 12 seconds per inch. It takes i hour 18 minutes from the moment the light strikes the backstone until it disappears on stone 6. The photographs show the culmination of light at
Cairn T as it crosses the sunwheel emblem. The beam of light clearly centres on the sun's disc, repeating the imagery of the spring equinox. 'The width of the beam is the same, but its length (c. iq \in .) is about double what it was in the spring. The focal image in both events remains the samef but the scheme is contrived so that different sets of engravings are utilized to measure the beam of light. In the first photograph the movement of the upper part of the beam is matched to a set of zigzags. In the second photograph it is matched to a set of segmented lines contained in an enclosure. A portion of the beam on the upper right is aligned to a series of horizontal lines on stone /5 .
98



The first lunar observations in a passage mound were made on the night of i A p ril 1980 at Cairn T. A narrow beam of light appeared fo r twenty minutes on stone 6 in the chamber. At that time the moon *sdeclination was very close to the sun’s decli nation six days before equinox, and the moon's beam would closely resemble the position of the sunbeam at that time. The photograph (right) shows the slender beam of light as it appeared in the chamber.
Spring equinox, Cairn T
The beam of sunlight (below) enters itsfin al phase before leaving the chamber on 23 March. The long dagger of light on the left enters the chamber from an opening between stones 1 and 8. In the fin al phase, the rectangular form of the beam stops moving on stone 6 and begins to narrow from left to right until it disappears.



Autumnal equinox, Cairn T
'The photographs show a more complete sequence of the light beam. Stages 5 , 6 and 7 are critical, because this phase, which represents the culmi nation of the shaft of light> is unimpaired by the modern door at the entrance. The illumination of the sunwheel unambiguously littks the art and the astronomy.

T h is has a vertical line which replicates the vertical line on the entrance stone at N ew grange. T h e shadow o f the standing stone seem s clearly to have been intended to align with the vertical line on the kerbstone. Although the standing stone has been re-erected , it has b een put back in its original socket, and observations m ade on 13 and 16 S ep tem b er 1980 seem ed to indicate that the alignm ent was intentionally positioned to m ark the equ in ox. T h is strategy has a clear parallel in the sim ilar arrangem ent em ployed at N e w grange (below).
Equinox at Knowth
K n o w th is the largest passage m ou n d in Ireland. It is a m assive stru ctu re co ve rin g an acre o f land on a hilltop in the B oyn e V alley. In architectural con ception it represen ts the ideas and m o tiv ations of a society which we are only just b eg in n in g to u n derstan d . That society is v e ry far removed from us, and indeed very far rem oved from even the most ancient civilizations that we do know som ething about. In the illustration above, shadow s from two stan d in g stones are cast on to tw o k erb sto n es at K n o w th at the equinox sunset. (K erb sto n es are

During winter solstice sunrise at Nezugrange shadows cast by> standing stones 1 and 12 strike engraved kerbstones 1 and 9 3.



At Knowth a number of calendrical devices are synchronized in a single structure. The standing stones cast shadows, beams of light enter the passages (even though the entrances were damaged during the Iron Age) and smaller sundials are engraved on the kerbstones (numbered here according to the sequence given on the plan above). There are estimated to be 13 4 kerbstones, more than half
engraved with major compositions and others with incidental markings. Many stones on the east side still remain buried, so that after number 8 , the count is speculative. Heavily engraved stones are positioned in an area that extends clockwise from the northeast to the northwest, thus following a circuit that matches the movements of the sun and moon.
102



(Above) A section cut into the Knozvth mound shows how layers of sods and brown clay are interspersed among layers of shale and pebbles. Layers alternate between organic and inorganic
material. Current excavation is removing much of this material, and one wonders to what extent it will be replaced in the restoration.
( Below) Stones West O and East O are the entrance stones to the passages. The vertical lines indicate the positions of the rising and setting sun at equinox, and these are unambiguous astronomical alignments, closely resembling the alignment of the
entrance stone and kerbstone 52 at Newgrange. A set of seven inverted arcs on N W i duplicates the seven arcs engraved on S E i . The positioning of these markings demonstrates that their placement is intentional.
103



The setting sun on 16 September 1980 approaches the standing stone outside the entrance of the western passage of Knowth. On the autumnal equinox, six days later, the sun would align with the standing stone as its beam penetrates deeply into the passage.
104



(Above) View of the western entrancefacing north shows the standing stones and a peculiar arrange ment of spheroid and ellipsoid stones whose purpose is unknown. To the north are two of Knowth's seventeen satellite mounds.
( Below) The standing stones contrast straight and narrow form with circular or ovular form. The
straight standing stone is yft i in. in height and its width varies between / 5 and 18 in. It closely resembles in shape and measure the standing stone inside Cairn L , Tougherewf which is also part of a solar construct. Its rectangular form is echoed in the engravings on the entrance stone and the vertical line. Behind the stones lies the entrance to the passage.






The beam of light entering the western passage at Knowth extends much further than the beam at Newgrange. According to radiocarbon dating Knowth was built about 5 0 0 years before New grange. The eastern passage, which cannot be observed because of obstructions, is about twice the size of the Newgrange passage. In the western passage the light beam extends nearly to the sillstone, beyond which the passage veers to the right. This sillstone is seen on the lower right of the illustration on the facing page. An engraved stone in the illustration combines elements from the western entrance stone (above) and the eastern entrance stone (below).
Because of their length and the time ofyear they indicate, the passages at Knowth are unsurpassed fo r their astronomical potential in accurately defining a particular day. The fu ll extension of the light beam entering Knowth West can be observed from the back recess of the passage. From there the appearance of the light beam would indicate equinox. Some archaeologists believe that this area of the passage once formed part of an earlier and smaller mound, although at present there is little evidence to support the idea. In any case, as it stands today, as a solar construct, the passage represents one of the great wonders of the Neolithic world.



The illustration shows sunrise positions on the horizon as seen front Carnbane West. The rec tangles represent approximate areas fram ed by remaining passages of mounds on Carnbane West. From August to November the sunrise positions move from left to right as light enters Cam s T\ /, T, H and L. In the springy from February to A p ril, the sun *sposition moves from right to left and light
re-enters Cairn L on 4 February and then Cairn H. By spring equinoxy 2 1 M arch, the sun's rays are again entering Cairn T on Carnbane Eastyfo l lowed on Carnbane West by Cairn I (4 A pril) and Cairn F (27 A pril). By 6 M ay, another cross quarter day, rays of the setting sun are entering Cairn S on Carnbane East (not shown), to return again on 8 August, repeating the annual process.

Between equinox and solstice
It is evident that the existing passages o f m ou nds on L o u g h c re w are aligned to positions o f the sun on or near the horizon, although on Carnbane West the passage of Cairn D has not yet been found and only Cairns F , H , I, and L are still functioning to any extent. We have seen that equinoxes and solstices were the prim ary concerns o f the m ound b uild ers. N ext in im portance w ere cross-qu arter days, which fall exactly between the equinoxes and solstices, dividing the year into 8 parts. Som e satellite m ounds were apparently con structed to warn o f the approach of an im portant date. Cairn I warns of the approaching autumnal equinox just as Cairn H warns o f the com ing o f w inter on the cross-qu arter day in N o vem b er. T h e view of Cairn T from Cairn I, illustrated above, is v e ry freq u en tly p h o tog rap h ed . T h e two m ounds are in fact closely related in a time sequence. A t the beginning o f Septem ber, the sun rises directly behind Cairn T and projects a beam o f light directly on to the backstone of Cairn I (right). By 16 Septem ber the light beam is on ly 6 in. aw ay fro m the right edge o f the backstone, and sim ultaneously light begins to enter the cham ber o f C airn T to m ark the equinox. Cairn H duplicates this strategy as the sun’s rays enter the cham ber prior to the cross quarter day in N ovem b er when the sun com es into the range o f Cairn L.



Cairn L, Loughcrew
Cross-quarter Days, 8 November
and 4 February
Som e of the most unusual and dram atic sun beam im agery in a m ound occurs at C airn L. C airn L is u n iqu e am on g the L o u g h c r e w cairns in having an asym m etrical cham ber and a re gularly shaped white standing stone positioned tow ard s the right in the ch am ber. T h e stone is o v er 6 ft high and nearly i $ i n . w ide. It stands w h ere it w as fo u n d w h e n the m o u n d w a s first opened, isolated from the m ain structure o f the cham ber itself. C onceivably the m ound could have been built as an elaborate housing for this special stone. D u N oyer records a single circle en g rav ed on the bottom o f the stone, but this is no longer recognizable and possibly never ex isted. T h e purpose o f the stone has always been an enigm a, but its function could be revealed in the light o f the rising sun. T eam s were positioned inside Cairn U on Carnbane Hast and C airn L on C arnbane W est before dawn broke on the m orning o f 3 N o vem ber 1980. T o w a rd s sunrise the stars began to fade, although the crescent of the waning moon rem ained a brilliant object in the sky. N e ar the m oon, V enus and Saturn were almost in con junction, and Ju p ite r could be seen in the east. T h e sun began to rise behind the knoll w here the remains o f Cairn M lay situated. A s the sun rose, from Cairn L we could see the entire top o f the
knoll start to glow radiantly. T h e passage of C airn M was probably aligned to this sunrise, and m egalithic observers inside the m ound m ay have viewed the sun’s rays for about ten minutes before they appeared in C airn L . A s soon as the first limb of the sun appeared over Cairn M , a flash of light pierced the darkness o f Cairn L and
1 10



illuminated the top o f the standing stone. Instead of the usual slow, progressive entry o f the b eam o f light, it had p en etrated the c h a m b e r instantaneously. T h e lower edge of the light beam was form ed by the shadow o f Cairn M , and stones inside C airn L further m odelled it, so that it illum in ated o n ly the stan d in g stone and no other stones in the cham ber. On the m orning o f 3 N ovem ber the beam of light was not in fact exactly centred on the standing stone, but directed a few inches to the left. T h is meant that an exact alignm ent would occur sometime on or very near 8 Novem ber. Unfortunately bad weather after 3 N ovem ber prevented further observations until 12 N ovem ber. But despite this, enough observations were m ade on 3 N o ve m b er to suggest that the cross quarter day at C airn L (and also C airn U ) was accurately designated. The beam of light entered Cairn L a t 7.40 a.m. on 3 N o v e m b e r. In ten m in u tes it had m o ved dow n 7 in. from the top o f the stone and was grow ing longer. B y 7.56 a.m. the beam was over 30 in. in length and had shifted 9 in. fro m the top o f the stan d in g stone as it m o v e d to w a rd s the right. Before leaving the cham ber, the beam of light - by now rectangular - was projected on to stone 17 and brilliantly illuminated the entire recess. In the diagram above, the back of stone 17 is shown. T h e d raw in g show s a detail o f the face o f stone 20, w h ich is opposite stone 17. T h e im age o f the risin g sun is en g rav ed at the edge o f the stone basin. T h e engraved images are almost a pictorial representation o f the astronom ical event.



Aioonrise, Cairn L
The photograph is of the fu ll moon as seen from stone 1 3 at the very hack of Cairn L on the night of 26 August 1980 at 1 0 . 1 3 P-m. A t this time the moon's rays were simultaneously entering Cairn U on Carnbane East and the megalithic mound at Tara. This moon is known as the ‘harvest moon9, because it is low in the sky during August when the sun is very high, and during the harvesting of crops it provides a convenient light which allows work to continue into the night. When this photograph was taken a beam of moonlight was being projected on to the right side of stone 1 3 , where it illuminated a hollowed circular depression in which zvas engraved a lunar crescent. Prom here the beam of moonlight moved downwards and to the right as it illuminated the lower portion of a standing stone, a stone basin and engravings on the lower edges of stones inside the chamber in a sequential pattern.
The photograph gives a good indication of the aperture as it exists today. Fortunately, when the mound zvas first opened over 100 years ago, Du Noyer zvas on hand and, from his drawing, it is clear that there has been no significant change in the entrance. The roofing of the chamber had collapsed, but the lintel forming the lop of the aperture was still in place. It is possible that the portal as it exists today is, or closely approximates, the original scheme. George Coffey referred directly to the symbols on stone 3 in his book N e w G r a n g e ( 1 9 1 2 ) : they ‘probably represent a symbol of the sinking or rising sun\ The twelve concentric circles could represent the year and there are tzvo subsets of three arcs, likely to be an emblem of the rising sun and the year. Another luni-solar emblem appears on stone 4. In the photograph of the moon as seen from Cairn L , it is this stone which protrudes into the framing portal from the right. The left edge of this stone serves as a gnomon fo r the light beam.

Just as Cairn H warns o f N ovem ber's cross quarter day and the com ing of winter, so Cairn F warns o f M a y ’s cross-quarter day and the com ing of summer. By m id-O ctober the sun's rays enter C airn H at sunrise and strike en grav ings on the ed ge o f stone 4. A s N o v e m b e r approaches the rectangular light beam strikes the backstone. T h e sun then m oves out o f range o f C airn H and directly in line with C airns L and M , w hich m ark its position on the horizon on 8 N ovem ber. Sim ilarly, the rays o f the rising sun enter C airn F late in A p ril before m arking the cross quarter day on 6 M ay, when rays o f the setting sun centre on C airn S. T h e sun's rays return to Cairn S to m ark the cross-qu arter day on 8 August. By 16 August they again enter Cairn F, and continue to do so until the sun’s rising position m oves behind C airn T and the light beam enters Cairn I, warning of autumnal equinox. Cairns I, T , F and S form the longest remaining sequential arrangement of alignments known. One lintel only remains from the original roofing o f both C airns H and F , and at C airn F the entrance is also partially blocked. N e v e r th e less, light is still projected on to the backstone.

Cairns S and U are satellite m ounds positioned in close p ro x im ity to C airn T on C arn b an e East. Cairn S indicates the cross-quarter day on 6 M ay and the cross-quarter day on 8 A ugust, m arking the beginning o f sum m er and autumn. Cairn U is synchronized with C airn L to indicate the cross-quarter days on 8 N ovem ber and 4 F eb ruary, m arking the beginning o f winter and spring.

moon and the stars may well have been under stood in similar terms.’ Another astronomer, Lockyer, believed that the megalith builders incorporated alignments to stars in their archi tecture and ‘used starlight at night in some of their observations, very much like they used sunlight during the day’ . Baltinglass, perched 1,288 ft up in the Wick low Mountains, gives clear evidence of an align ment to the stars. Aligned due north, there is little doubt that it is focused towards our polestar today, and what was the polestar in the Neolithic period (see p. 186). The intention is accentuated by a vertical line engraved on the stone basin in the chamber. A vertical line marks
The passage of mound K , a satellite of Nezvgrangey is 36ft in length and clearly aligned due south. No lintels or roof-slabs remain, but it is apparent from stones in the passage that the ceiling was extremely low. The sun's rays could only reach the backstone of the chamber when the sun reached its lowest point when transiting the meridian. This would be winter solstice when the sun's altitude is only 12 18 ' at the latitude of the Boyne Valley. M any of the stones in the passage and chamber are engraved. Shown here are engravings on a sillstone in the passage and a set of zigzags that cover the surface of a kerbstone. Placed outside the entrance is a conical stone similar to those found at Knowlh.



The relative positions of the polestar and the sun when it crosses the meridian at the Boyne Valley. The meridian is an imaginary line in the heavens which demarcates north and south. The pole is a point around which the stars appear to revolve. Over thousands ofyears the star nearest this point changes, however this point always indicates true north. During the day, south is indicated when the sun crosses the meridian at midday and reaches its highest point in the sky. The sun is highest at summer solstice (60 i8 ') and lowest at winter solstice ( I 2 C1 8 ') . In between these positions is the equinox (36 48').
m any important astronomical alignments. T h e most obvious and explicit alignment due south occurs at m ou n d K , a satellite in close p ro x im ity to N ew grange. A lthough this m ound was re buried after excavation, the intended alignm ent is clear from the d ig records. A fascin atin g aspect o f this solar construct is that the su n ’ s rays would appear to strike the backstone during w inter solstice at m idday. T h e scenario in the B o y n e V a lle y is far m ore c o m p le x than expected : it in v o lv es the s u n ’ s rays e n te rin g N e w g r a n g e at daw n (8. $4 a.m .), m ound Z at 1 0 .1 $ and m ound K at 1 1.20, rem aining there until 12 .26 G r e e n wich M ean T im e (equivalent to noon local apparent time). Im m ediately afterw ards the beam would enter mound L , remaining there until 1.09. Between 1.09 and 2.20, when a thin shaft o f light appears in the ch am ber o f D o w th 2, the sun’s rays m ay have illuminated m ound Z i , adjacent to Z. T h is m ound has been com pletely d e stro y ed , alth o u gh there is som e ev id e n ce o f it in aerial photographs. B y 2.53 the light beam has m oved to the back o f the D ow th chamber. Reflected light illum inates stone 13 in the side ch am b er from 3 .0 4 until 3.3 0 . L ig h t is cut off from D o w th at 4.03, w hen the su n ’ s disc begins to disappear below the horizon. T h e sun sets at 4.07. T h e intention seem s to be continual o b servation of the sun throughout the shortest day o f the year. Satellites aligned due south appear to be a feature of other major complexes. Cairn T on L o u g h crew has one and K n o w th also has at least one.
Above, the megalithic construct at Baltinglass, Co. Wicklow, is aligned north and marked by an engraving on the stone basin. Below, Knockm any, Co. Tyrone, aligns due south.



Cairn W and Knockmany
Cairn W was known as the ‘P ot’ Cairn, since unlike all other m ounds on L o u gh crew , the earth w as dug aw ay below the surface for its con struction. 'This m ay have been to allow the su n ’ s rays to penetrate the cham ber when the sun is at its highest. C airn W lies 128 yds east o f C airn T and is c o n sid era b ly rem o ved from the m ain group o f mounds on Carnbane East. Only fragm ents remain of a small passage m ound that was once about 7 y d s in diam eter. Its stone basin, which was hollowed out to a depth of 3 -4 in., is m issing and engravings on stones 1 and 3, originally recorded by Du N oyer, have

now disappeared. It aligns due south, and m ark ings on stone 3 probably indicated various positions o f the sun at m idday. Stone 6 at K nockm any probably had a similar function. K n o ck m a n y is situated in Co. T y ro n e , on a hill 779 ft above sea level, overlooking the plain o f C lossach . It aligns to the sun at m id d a y and is clearly not focused on or near the horizon. T h e diagram of the elevation shows the height o f the su n at ex tre m e position s as it tran sits the m e ridian. T h ese are draw n from the most probable position o f a lintel at the entrance. A 14-ft ch am ber o f this type could have been used to determ ine dates and seasons by the height o f the sun throughout the year. T h e entrance opens directly towards Loughcrew , 50 miles due south, an extraordinary distance if the alignment is intentional.
Above, an illustration of Knockmany based on early photographs. Below , an elevation of the stones on the right or east side of the chamber, and various positions of the sun at midday. Stone 2 has been re-erected and is here reconstructed according to Coffey.



A north-south alignment is embodied in the archi tecture of Newgrange. The arrangement conforms to a pattern of aligning a standing stone (in this case, no. 2 ) , a kerbstone (no. 4), which has been engraved on its interior surface, attd stone R 2 1 at the immediate entrance to the chamber. These
alignments strongly suggest that stone R 2 1, the standing stones surrounding the mound and certain key kerbstones were erectedfirst as baselines before the mound was built. Thus, the structure of the mound has its foundation in astronomical and cosmological principles.



Part III
MEGALITHIC ART
M e g a lith ic art is not art in the o rd in ary sense o f the word. It displays some of the im provisations o f art, and at times acts as ornam ent or deco r ation, b ut it also e x h ib its the b asic c h a ra c teristics of a form of sym bolic writing. Although each m egalith ic co m p o sitio n is u n iq u e there is a limited, identifiable and relatively consistent range o f sym bols w hich appear in w idely d if ferent places. T h e art as it exists in W e stern E u r o p e can be succinctly defined as engraving or painting ex ecuted on megaliths. In Ireland, where the largest con cen tration is fo u n d , it is alw ay s en graved on a type of megalithic structure known as a passage m ound. T h e art is h arm oniou sly integrated into the architecture o f the m ound, and it is this re la tio n sh ip that id en tifies the art as m o n u m e n ta l and links it d ire c tly w ith a str o n o mical considerations. T h ree main factors are generally recognized in the developm ent o f astronom y as a science. T h e first is observation o f celestial bodies for the pu rpose o f p e rfo rm in g rites and rituals - this is detectable in N eolithic astronom y. T h e second is the correlation o f celestial with terrestrial phenom ena - the presence o f this factor is a possibility, but there is no definite evidence for the developm ent of a predictive ‘science’ of astrology. T h e third factor is calendrical: as tronom y develops as a m ethod to facilitate the m easurem ent o f time - this is the most readily

perceptible factor in N eolithic astronom y, alth ou gh it exists a m o n g other con sideration s. A lthough the beginnings o f truly scientific astronom y can be recognized this does not im ply that N eolithic astronom y was scientific in character. R itu al considerations seem to d o m inate in all the structures, and in general the art represents a sem i-magical projection on as tron om y. It is likely that am o n g the popu lation both the m ounds and the sym bols were regarded as sacred to the sun and moon. Im ages o f both dom inate m egalithic art and this recognition alone, to a large extent, explains m uch o f the art. T h e gaps in our know ledge are still enorm ous, but the process o f decoding and re-reading has begun. Apart from luni-solar sym bolism , light itself seem s to be the c h ie f focal sym b o l. T h e r e is also a deep concern with time. M an y sym bols seem to indicate n u m bers and counting, al though because of the sim plicity o f the num bers involved and the various ways of interpreting th em , it is not a lw a y s e a s y to d e te r m in e p re c is e ly h ow they are used. B ut it is certain that cou n tin g ability and computation were directly connected with timekeeping.
127



Rock engraving techniques
M eg alith ic art in Irelan d exists solely in the m edium o f engraved stone. On the continent som e stones are painted. Prior to engraving, the sym bols were sometimes scratched on the sur face o f the stone with a pebble. A piece o f Hint or quartz was held in one hand and used as a chisel. T h e other hand held a stone hamm er. Incisions were made along the scratched lines in a series of closely set pick m arks, whose size was de termined by the size o f the chisel point and the pressure exerted. T h e point m ust have had to be constantly sharpened. A m ore advanced technique, found in the Boyne Valley and on Loughcrew , was the use of various grades o f point on the same stone. Later the pickin g technique w as used in the B oy n e V a lle y to create an outline and fill in the figure. Pick dressing also developed in the B oyne area. T h e thin outer layer o f a stone was picked away to expose a new surface, rem oving superficial irregularities and im proving the colour. T h e megalith builders carried the art further towards the three-dim ensional, broadening the intaglio effect so that the image stood out in false-relief. T h e y also developed the sm oothing of pick marks by hamm ering. None of these innovations are evident at L o u gh crew . T h e Boyne V alley engravings are also better preserved, because durable stones were used as opposed to the re la tive ly soft local lim esto n e at L o u g h c r e w . T h e v isu al concepts and d r a w in g skills are also far m ore ad van ced, indicating a develo p m en t in both style and technique. T h e en o rm o u s investm ent in time and en ergy suggests the engravings w ere too im portant to the com m unity to have been m ere artists’ doodles.
A bove, consecutive kerbstones at Knowth exhibit a wide variety of techniques. The standard technique of pickmarking is shown opposite, in the photo graph of a detail of SW 2. The form is an equable spiral which decreases in diameter by the same amount each revolution, and the tangents to the spiral make a constant angle to the radius. This was probably achieved by revolving a string around a fixed central post, making the distance between the lines equal to the circumference of the post.
Below, a stone from a Knowth satellite mound displays incised lines which outline the forms and subsequent pickmarking of twelve quadrangles and the beginnings of a thirteenth. The incised lines delineate the structure and form sub-sets of trian gular patterns.

The essential elements of megalithic art
M eg alith ic art is h igh ly abstract and seem s to be intentionally restricted to nine basic geom etric forms, here called prim aries because they com bine to form all other m arks and signs. T h e prim aries are show n in the first row o f the diagram opposite (/ dot or cupm ark, 2 line, 3 circle, 4 quadrangle, 5 arc or crescent, 6 zigzag, 7 wavy line, 8 spiral, and 9 oval or ellipse). Prim aries are clearly distinguishable from each other, they recur frequently and have a wide distribution. T h is classification eliminates ele ments which are clearly com pounds of prim ary elements. It also includes ovals or ellipses, omitted from other classifications. R o w two show s the principal w ays in which the prim aries form sets. In row three, colum n four, two types of triangle are shown. T h ey are n o r c o n s id e r e d p rim a rie s, as it is the q u a d r a n g le , composed of opposed triangles, which generally
appears in the art. In colum n five, opposing v a ria tio n s are term ed arcs (A), cresce n ts (B), and elon gated arcs (C). A ll three typ es can be sh o w n to be clearly distinct in m any instances. T h e C type is alw ays distinct, but rarely form s com pounds and is considered a variation o f the arc rather than a prim ary. A and B types are indis tinguishable in some instances and interchange able in others. N ote that the upright and inverted arcs o f type A are one and the same symbol transformed by positioning. Likewise, the left and right crescents of type B represent different aspects o f the same referent and one transform s into the other. In row three, colum ns six and seven, the sets o f zigzags and w avy lines are not in phase. T h e se are variations of the more com m on form shown in ro w two. In co lu m n seven, A is term ed a loop. It appears freq u en tly and is related to the w avy line w h ich in turn is related to the spiral. Sp irals m a y be rig h t-h a n d e d (a ), le ft-h a n d e d (B) or retrograde (C), as show n in colum n eight. T h e ellipse sh o w n in row one, colu m n nine, is



distinet from the oval in row three, colum n nine, but both are closely related and their num erous variants contain aspects of both so they are classified together. R o w four shows the most com m on sim ple com pounds. T h ese are em blem atic form s or
ligatures formed by two primaries. M ore com plex com pounds form ed by three prim aries are in row five. T h e r e are hundreds o f com pound s, many of which repeat, but these recur most frequently and are established standard sym bols rather than innovations.



T h e re are about 390 stones in Ireland known to be engraved with m egalithic art. T h e y are all found in passage m ounds and, w hen these are accessible or intact, they have all been show n to be astronom ically orientated, which reveals the context that the art appears in. T h e relationship between the art and astronom y is further re inforced by the presence o f engraved sundials, calendars and explicit solar-lunar imagery. A n analysis o f the art show s that circles and arcs or crescents are the dom inant forms. T h is results from the sam e pre-occupation with the
sun and m oon that is evident in the structure o f the m ounds. T h e chart above shows the prim aries and the'approxim ate percentage of stones on which they appear. Circles and arcs have the highest percentages. O f the 390 stones, 203 are illustrated in this book. T h e se are selected to represent the entire corpus. T h e y include all the m ajor com positions, sam ples from each site and for the most part exclude only stones with m inor isolated engravings. O f the 203 stones, at least half in some w ay express a relationship between the circle and the arc or crescent.
Stones on these pages are similar in that they are emblematic representations of the sun and moon and symbols of theyear. The stone basin at Knozvth is a ritual implement found in the context of an equinoctial solar construct. As ideally the equinoxes divide twelve months of the year into two equal parts, six radia Is are divided by a luni-solar emblem. The geometrical arrangement on the Bal
linvally stone is composed of twelve elements. Below, the number twelve is implied on stone SE28. The gapped arc could represent the thirteen possible fu ll moons in a year. The crescent on the left is intentional and creates a polarity zvith the circle. This theme occurs regularly. Macalister recorded a left-handed spiral below the crescent.

The moon in megalithic art
From earth the moon appears to be the largest celestial body in the sky; it attracts attention to itself constantly, changing its shape, size and brightness every day. These regular changes became the basis for the earliest calendar known - the megalithic lunar calendar. Lunar motion was undoubtedly seen to have an effect on the tides, and its phases were noticed to correlate with seasonal activities on earth, both agricul tural and biological. Neolithic inscriptions are rich in lunar notation; it therefore seems likely that the moon’ s phases and positions in the sky were the subject of intense speculation. Thu s to understand megalithic art one must first under stand the moon. As a symbol, it has appeared in all human cultures. After forty years research into comparative religion, Mircea Eliade con cludes that the cycles of the moon - its birth, growth, death and rebirth - reflect in a profound way the cycles of human existence. T h e illuminated side of the moon always points towards the sun and shows the sun’ s position even when it has set. T he lunar calendar requires observation of the first visibility of the new crescent on the western horizon. T he diag rams on the opposite page illustrate approxi mately (and not to scale) various relationships between the sun and moon as seen from the north, looking at Cairn T in the Loughcrew Mountains. In diagram i the sun sets and the crescent moon makes its first appearance. T he sun must be sufficiently below the horizon for the moon to be visible briefly before it sets. On the evening before, the moon was still too close to the sun to be seen. T h e moon is ‘lost’ in the sun for one, two and sometimes three days in each month. It is only when the sun and moon draw sufficiently apart that the first crescent will be seen briefly on the western horizon. This crescent will always face to the right and appear in the west. It is the simplest and most directly observable definition of the beginning of the month. T h e new crescent will appear not more than thirty days or less than twenty-nine days after the appearance of the last new crescent. After the appearance of the first crescent, the moon seems to draw continually further away from the sun, appearing for a longer time in the
sky and with an ever-enlarging crescent which still faces right. After seven days the crescent enlarges to the shape of a half moon. T h is is called the first quarter, and the moon appears at its highest point in the sky (or south) as the sun is setting (diagram 2). After this there are five nights of the so-called gibbous phase, when the moon is almost a complete disc, visible for much longer periods during the night. During all these stages the moon is said to be waxing, and its illuminated side is always on the right until the full moon. T h e moon can be considered ‘full’ for three successive nights, and at this stage it is always rising as the sun sets (diagram 3), reach ing its highest point (or south) at midnight (diagram 4), and setting when the sun rises (diagram 5). On the seventeenth night the moon noticeably begins to decrease in size and its waning period begins. It resumes its gibbous shape, but now the illuminated side is on the left. It rises later each night and its brightness declines. When it becomes a half moon again it is rising at mid night (diagram 6) and reaching its highest point at sunrise (diagram 7). T his is called the third or last quarter, a mirror image of the first quarter. After this the moon rises very late at night and starts approaching the sun’ s rising position. T he last old crescent moon finally rises at dawn just before the sun, and the last glimpse of the waning moon is seen on the eastern horizon. The next phase will be its period of invisibility when it is again ‘lost’ in the sun, before re-emerging in the west. T h e cycles of the sun and moon provided not only an imagery that was easily transformed into meaningful symbol, but also the basis for a rough calendar, time-reckoning and direction finding at night. T h e relationships diagrammed here are all amenable to visual observation without instruments. Serious astronomy can only begin when irregularities in the lunar month are recognized and measured. The basic tools required are fixed and permanent observ ation points, notation and counting ability, a system of measure and a mastery of dialling. All these ingredients were present during the Neolithic period.

The diagram shows consecutive monthly maximum north and south declinations of the moon during a year. The moon's path carries it in an ascending and descending motion, winding above and below the celestial equator through the year, besides meandering above and below the ecliptic every month.
The crescent and wavy line
T h e crescent and w avy line both represent the m oon. In m an y cultures the m oon is sym b olized by a snake or dragon because o f its m otion in the sky, weaving above and below the ecliptic (the sun's path) each month. D urin g the year the m oon m eanders in a w a vy line above and below the celestial equator. T h e crescent is a pictorial sym bol o f the m oon, and is included in the m odern international code of sym bols, a visual language recognizable worldwide. The diagram opposite shows how the lunar cycle divides into recognizable segments. T h e waxing and waning phases divide the cycle sym m etrically in h alf and there is a further division into quarters by the half moons. D u rin g the lunar month o f 29 or 30 days there are 27 visible phases of the moon. Stones N E 6 and S W 17 at K n o w th show w ays in w hich crescents and w avy lines m easure time.
A set o f 6 circles (6 m onths o f the year?) extend across the right half o f N E 6 from above the centre of a spiral with 6 turnings. T h e circle and crescent (far left) also suggest the moon. W avy lines seem to be the prim ary counting units in m egalithic art, and appear at m ost sites. T h e y can enumerate days, months and possibly years, but w h ich is not u su a lly specified. E ach turn of the line represents a unit. On S W 17 , a right crescent (confirm ing the m oon reference) begins the count and transform s into a w a vy line. Starting here the set describes a m onth o f 29 days divided apparently with reference to the full moon. Below the main set, near the fourteenth tu r n in g th ere is a s u b -se t in d ic a tin g 7. T h i s could represent a division similar to our week. O n oth er stones it seem s that the m e g a lith ic artists divided the 27 visible phases into 3 per iods o f 9 days, a m ethod later used by the Celts.



Stones NW 6 and N E6 bothfeature a right-handed spiral and crescents, and are positioned opposite each other on the east and west sides of Knowth. The nucleus of NW6 are the 2 arcsjuxtaposed in the centre of a series of 12 crescents. In ancient and modern astronomy these signs are used to indicate
the point where the moon crosses the ecliptic or the ascending node, A ,and the descending node, \ f . Note the way that the spiral ascends and descends across the horizontal line. Stone SW 9 is a variation of the same theme. There are six circles engraved on the upper surface
13«



and a right-handed and left-handed spiral are juxtaposed. The same elements are on N E6 in a different arrangement. The wavy line indicating 30 on N E y reinforces the lunar symbolism on NE6. Spirals on these stones are opposite and contrast each other. On N E y a left crescent seems to emerge from the circle at the centre of the spiral. This may be a reference to the left crescent of the moon that begins to show after the fu ll moon which occurs directly above in the wavy-line development. On N E6 the right crescent seems to merge into the right-handed spiral.
The symmetrical division of the yea r into two halves of six months is also the theme of SE29. The main element is a luni-solar emblem composed of a circle and 6 crescents. On the right, crescents are transformed into a set of wavy lines forming two counts of 6. Below that there are two rows of 6 chevrons which transform into a set of zigzags which merge and form a total count of 12. This partly encloses a quadrangle which thus becomes charged with meaning and symbolism as the divi sion of the year into light and dark halves and four quarters.
139



The stone found near mound G in the Boyne Valley is nozv re-erected upright near Newgrange. A crescent seems to emerge from the spiral. There are 6 crescents and a wavy line indicating 6. On a corbel stone in the chamber of Carnanmore there is a wavy line of 9 and 3 arcs. The same breakdown of the number 12 occurs on NW 8 at Knowth. The central line indicates 12 and a small crescent refers the count to the moon. A line of 9 is below this and above, 3 turnings enclose a spiral. The entire set totals 24 and probably represents 24 months or 2 years. The damaged part of the stone does not seem to interfere with the engravings. There are other possible interpretations which imply the recog nition of a complex lunar cycle of 9.3 years. We know there is a concern with number and numerical relationships, but although the references are here taken to be the moon, we cannot be sure. The wavy-line development indicating 12 is common, particularly on the continent. Examples are shown here from the Boyne Valley and Iberia. The Iberian stone has 6 arcs and one pair frames crescents. Engravings on two stones at Kiltierney, Co. Fermanagh, echo patterns on the stone from Anglesey, and these suggest a concern with 6 and 12 and the division of the year. This similarity between Britain and Ireland is not surprising when one considers the close proximity of Ireland to A nglesey.
140






'A bove) S W io has a main line indicating 12. The top line of 5 begins from the seventh turning and appears to be intentionally out of phase. On the other hand it may be a continuation of the count to /7. O f the 12 stones of this distinct type at Knozvth, 8 have wavy lines indicating /7. (Below) S E 34 has a luni-solar emblem on the upper left. There is
clearly a preference in these types of emblematic devices fo r positioning the sun on the right and the moon on the left. The main imagery is the 4 arcs above the wavy line of 8 , which establishes a theme based on the division of the number 12. There are subsets of 6 arcs, a pair of 12 zigzags and 4 arcs which continue the count of the wavy line to 12.



A set of 12 triangles at Nezvgrange also explores relationships between 4,8 and the number 12 which are directly applicable to divisions of the year. We have seen in Part I I how the orientation of the passage mounds divides the yea r into 8 parts. This is a natural division based on the sun. The division of the yea r into 12 parts is based on the moon. Symbols strive to combine the diverse elements of nature into unified forms. Approached this way, even a simple set of 6 arcs, like those on N W 23, have purpose and meaning. The recognition of a basic symbolic use of simple numbers leads to the recognition that more complex numbers are likely to be used to deal with more complex lunar cycles. On the stone at Dowth a group of arcs and circles form sets of 6 and 12. To the right of this, 79 marks are fram ed in a cartouche. Significantly in the Metonic cycle - the basis fo r the Greek calendar the phases of the moon recur on the same days of the same months after a lapse of /9 years.



Calendrical engravings
A ny genuine system of time reckoning must ad m it o f n u m erical treatm en t, and it m u st consist of divisions and subdivisions of ap proxim ately equal length. C om positions such as SVCf2 2 d r a w on th e s im p l e s t la w s o f w r it t e n numerals, ordering and grouping. T h e age-old prob lem o f calen d ar m akin g is in harm onizing the solar and lunar cycles. T h e basic form ula for a solar-lunar calendar is 12 lunar months = i solar year. In practice, 12 lunar months are 3$$ days, tailing short of a solar year o f 36$ days by about 10 days. A fter 2\ years this am ounts to nearly a full month. In other w ords, after 30 months, a month must be added to bring the lunar and solar cycles into harm ony. 1 n order to harm onize this with the seasons, two 3 1 month cycles or $ solar years of 62 months need to be used. I f the year is divided into tw o parts, let us say a light half and a dark half determ ined by the equinoxes, each 31-m o n th period will consist o f $ seasons, and the 5-ycar period will contain 10 seasons w h ich will begin and end at
the same equinox from which they start. T h is essentially was the basis of the ancient Celtic calendar, and a sim ilar system is outlined above in a chart o f the w avy line on S W 22 . Each turn o f the w avy line represents one month, or a com plete circuit of the distinct but related pattern of crescent and circle repeat units which are closely matched to the phases o f the moon. T h e count m oves to 3 1 and reverses back to 62, keeping in p a c e writh th e e q u i n o x e s . C r e s c e n t s t r a n s f o r m into circles as they approach the full moon when they become double circles. T h e eighth phase or qu arter m oon is represented differen tly, as is the seventeenth phase. T h e tw enty-seventh or last visible phase begins to disappear into the spiral, which obscures the invisible phases. T h e same im agery is echoed on S W 2 3 , w h ere crescents appear to em erge from a spiral, and w avy lines total 12. A similar device on the lower righthand co rn er o f S W 2 2 is a m b ig u o u s and could have m any applications. T h e Portuguese stone has 30 grouped crescents and a single thirty-first crescent w hich is related to a w a v y line d e v e lo p ment of 12 turnings or months.

N W 4 is a diagrammatic representation of the moon through the use of bijections or one-to-one correspondences with the phases of the moon. A nbbon-iike de velopment of the wavy line extends from the central image. This closely parallels the arrangement of SW 22. The line follows a sequence shaped tofit the lunar month. The wavy line is transformed into crescents and then a fu ll circle orfu ll moon on thefourteenth count. A line divides the rest of the month, towards the end of which the crescents revert to the wavy line at the last quarter, defining a month of 30 days. This is the main set ( A).
Set B is another way of ordering the month. The top line counts from the first phase to the seventeenth phase when the moon begins to wane. The continuity is then picked up below, where the sequence continues the count to the last visible phase indicated by a left crescent determinative. Following this, the fin al three invisible phases are represented.
146



Lunar crescents supply the main imagery on N W 3 and loops parallel those on N W 4. These can be seen on S E 3 1. The illustration is based on Macalister's record of the stone. Zigzags emanating from the spiral develop 12 turnings. Below this a wavy line, which is apparently damaged, seems to have in
dicated 77 and continues in a sequence of 14 to total 3 1. There sometimes appears to be a relationship between numbers expressed on a stone and that stone's numerical position in the mound, but this is in no way consistent.

In the diagram of elements from N W 1 9 , the lunar phases are first countedfrom right to left .beginning until a right crescent . A t the eighth phase or first quarter, a half moon is indicated. Circles match phases of the fu ll moon. When the count is reversed the twentieth phase represents the half moon, making the last quarter. The engraved spiral and its
adjacent small right crescent seem to indicate the way in which the sequence is arranged. The arrangement parallels the use of the spiral on SW 22, where crescents emergefrom and disappear into a spiral to represent the unfolding cycle of the month. The bar belozv the wavy line marks off 12 of the 18 turnings, perhaps indicating a year.
T h e stones on these pages suggest the division o f time into cycles. At the top o f stone 20, Cairn T , elements expressing 4, 8 and 16 im ply the basic divisions o f the year. Further below, on the left, an arrangem ent of 27 arcs form s an em blem which may represent the visible phases of the moon. T h e device on the right has a series o f 18 horizontal lines. W avy line developm ents on N H 23 and N W 1 9 count 18, while N W 7 has 19 turnings on its front surface. A s we have seen, these higher numbers could signify larger more co m p lex cycles. T h e Saros cycle is a sequence o f eclipses which repeat about every 18 years. Another 18.6-year cycle has moonrise extremes m oving from m axim um to m inim um in 9.3 years and back to m axim u m , which the astronom er E. C. K ru p p believes is obvious enough to have been known from prehistoric times. T h e 19-year M e to n ic cycle referred to earlier m ay in its turn be linked with the sym bols on N W 7.






Three large groups of arcs and an ovalform a large set of 12 on NW 20. This is surmounted by arcs and circles to a count of 12. The total count on the entire composition is 28. The composition is related to the moon in both form and number, and these associ ations are reinforced by its positioning in relation to other stones with explicit lunar imagery.

The Loughcrezv stones are important because many of the symbols and arrangements used in Boyne Valley art were anticipated at Loughcrew, and the Loughcrew complex may have provided the model fo r the astronomical orientation of the Boyne Valley mounds. On stone i s at Cairn T a concern with lunar images and number is detectable, even though there are discrepancies on the actual counts involved in drawings of this stone.
Stone 2 at Cairn F clearly exhibits ordering and grouping of crescents, a method of calendrical computation that was fu lly developed at Knowth. The crescents total 6 2, and correspond to the basic calendrical fitting of 62 lunar months into 5 solar years. In size, form and technique these crescents are duplicated by those on the backstone of Cairn F (p. 1 1 S ) , which appear with a solar radial that is periodically illuminated by the sun and the moon.

The number / 7 is frequently given special signific ance in connection with the moon. It may have had significance in a calendar of ritual. Usually it is the seventeenth phase of the moon which appears on the horizon and projects a beam of light into the mounds. In other early cultures the seventeenth of the month had a symbolic significance. According to Plutarch, the Egyptians had a legend that Osiris's life came to an end on the seventeenth, ‘on which day it is quite evident to the eye that the period of thefu ll moon is over \ N W i y is one of the recurring wavy lines indicating /7 . 'The relation ship between the crescent and the wavy line is echoed on NW9, on which natural holes and cupmarks seem to provide a starry background to the lunar imagery. The stonefrom a megalithic site on M alta is about a foot zvide and displays a lunar crescent among more explicit groupings of stars.

N W i is positioned immediately to the left of the entrance stone of the western passage at Knowth which is aligned to the equinox sunset. Lunar imagery predominates, and right crescents on the right seem to be transformed into left crescents on the left. The design is closely related to the entrance stone of the eastern entrance, and similarly suggests compartments or ‘houses’ of the sun or moon reflecting the concept of the mound itself. The symmetrical compositions on N W 12 and South O imply a recognition of the inherent symmetry manifested by the moon and the heavens. This also is reflected in the structure of the mound. Arcs enclosing the crescents on South O may
represent the dome of the heavens, and this element seems to serve as a generic sky symbol applicable to the sun, the moon and the stars. In 18 8 5 , Thomas Wise M . D. called it the ‘horseshoe’ and described it as ‘the figure of the firmament, or Providence hovering over the world; this giving rise to its influence against evil spirits’. The horseshoe is still used as a talismanic charm today and its origins lie in the perennial human desire to connect the stars with fate. Its use in megalithic art implies a semimagical projection on astronomy, and the abun dant solar-lunar devices resemble emblematic charms rather than purely naturalistic re presentations.



The moon must have been immensely important in the daily life of societies without mechanical clocks andfew distractions to divert attention from events in the sky. At Loughcrew crescents and arcs dominate the imagery, and at Knowth similar forms and numbers generated by the moon are pervasive. It is this profusion of lunar imagery in the art that supports the conclusion that the mounds were used fo r both lunar and solar observation. The numerical and geometrical relationships expressed on SW 3 are simple but extremely inter esting. The main image is a concentric development
of 9 elements including an ellipse and the beginnings of a spiral. Beside this there are 9 circles and arcs, 3 pairs of which are positioned in a triangular arrangement surrounding the main set of 3. N W 1 5 has 30 circles and crescents that appear to revolve around two circles. This seems to be highly ab stracted lunar imagery in which there is no ap parent sequence in the transformations, yet the number and forms reflect patterns of the moon. It is essential to realize that in megalithic art the elements in a composition are frequently different aspects of one thing in a process of change.

The sun in megalithic art
Im ages and sym bols o f the sun are essential ch aracteristics o f m egalithic art. P erh ap s the m ost critical ev id en ce in su p p o rt o f th is is su p p lied by the sundial on the flat top o f N E 4 (in scale left, w ith position arrow ed on N E 4 below , and enlarged opposite), w hich d irectly leads to the recognition that radials, as exem plified by the en g ravin g on stone $ at C airn T , are rep re se n tativ e o f the sun. T h e fact that this radial is illu m in a te d by* a c o n tr iv e d b e a m o f lig h t at equinox substantiates such a conclusion.

X i was probably the backstone of the chamber in Cairn X i at Loughcrew. A t present it stands alone in a circle of kerbstones and faces towards the northwest. In this context it would have been illuminated by a beam of light. Like the backstone of Cairn T radials are the central images. On X i explicit sundial imagery is used as an analogue symbolizing the sun. It is not meant to be a practical sundial, but it contains all the elements of a functional sundial using the same system em ployed on N E 4 at Knowth. The 9 large radials of the inner set form 8 segments and the outer set of lines form 16 segments. Although there is no attempt at precision in the geometrical arrange ment, the symbol contains the same idea. The two smaller radial patterns are related to each other.
The opposite page shows various radials from Loughcrew and Dowth. The onesfrom Dowth 2 are incisions on stone 13 in the recess. This stone is positioned so that it is brilliantly illuminated by reflected light at the winter solstice. The designs show how the radial easily develops into triangles and forms the quadrangle, a relationship implying that they represent different aspects of one and the same thing. In fact they do not often appear together, and on sites where radials predominate, such as Cairn T, quadrangles are virtually absent. Viewed from the centre of the stone circle at Athgreany, Co. Wicklow, the stone below is due south and is engraved with what seems to be a dialling device. It is situated in a field called A c h a d h G ré in e ^ fsun-field\



The human mind, unless biased by preconceptions or in other ways pre-conditioned, will have a natural tendency to perceive forms such as those on the Portuguese stone (opposite) as representations o) the sun. The association seems to be confirmed by the fact that the stone forms the entrance to a probable equinoctial solar construct. The sun as a rayed circle appears as a day sign in the earliest writing systems. The counting of days in reference to the moon is a human tendency detectable in all cultures, because lunar cycles provide a convenient measure of solar cycles, being longer than days and shorter than years. One of the large sunwheels on the Iberian stone has 12 radials and the pair total 30. There is a large set of 12 lines, one of which transforms into a crescent. Evidently the artist is using abstract visual lan guage to explore relationships between the sun and the moon.
'The buried surface of stone 8 at Knowth (top) has a beautifully engraved radial on its pointed edge, and an array of symbols that include triangles and quadrangles. Stone i at Cairn T displays a complex develop ment of the basic radial form derived from the patterns and imagery of sundialling.

These stones are from a probable equinoctial solar construct in Portugal. They closely parallel stones at Loughcrew, notably those in Cairn T.

The main sumvheel on stone 14 at Cairn T is the focal point of the beam of light projected into the mound at equinox. This forms the basis fo r a division of the yea r into 8 parts according to the solar cycle of equinoxes and solstices which also divide the yea r into 6 months. These seem to be represented in the 6 radials of the sumvheel below and the 6 lines enclosed by attached crescents. The sunwheels belong to a set of 4 which contain a total of 3 1 radials in theform of elongated crescents, and together they make up the fundamental month count in the luni-solar calendar. The segmented lines could be units of measure ment calibrated to measure daily changes in the height of the beam of light. They correspond to a similar set at the bottom of stone 6A in Cairn 1. A low narrow shaft of light strikes these marks on the days immediately preceding the autumnal equinox.
165



K s i and K 5 2 are the only known major com positions on the kerbstones of Dowth. They face eastwards, approximately opposite the entrances of the passages on the western (far) side of the mound. The vertical line on K 50 may have had a similar function to that on K 5 2 at Newgrange. Sunivheels on K 5 1 recall those at Cairn T and reveal a similar concern with calendrical fittings of luni-solar cycles. With 6 rayed circles there is also a rayed dot which appears to be a sunset. The luni-solar symbol on the left suggests that the stone represents a month count, because 12 radials extend from the circle. The next two discs with 14 and 17 radials give a total count of 3 1 , reinforcing the idea of the month count. The count continues to 99 months, which brings the lunar cycle and the solar cycle into extremely close correlation in a calibration of 8 years (363 days x 8 = 2920 days, 99 months x 2 9 .5 days = 2920.5 days). The 8-year cycle is a very important development in calendar making. Known as the ‘Octaeteris\ it was the earliest cycle developed by the Greeks. It neatly contains 5 Venus years (5 x 584 = 2920) and this gave the cycle symbolic as well as calendrical significance in many ancient astronomical systems. The prominent displays of the number 8 may reflect the special significance given to it as rep resenting divisions of the day and year and a cycle of 8 years into which 99 months and 5 complete revolutions of Venus neatly fit. On K 5 2 the 8 circles and ovals very likely represent the 8 years which are reduced to terms of months on K 5 1 . Radials such as those on the stone at Le Petit Mont could represent luni-solar cycles of 18 or 19 years. In megalithic art significant numbers expressed in appropriate symbols seem to recur in prominent positions in astronomical settings, forming a system which is remarkably consistent and unlikely to occur by chance.
166






Gavrinis in Brittany, like Newg range, is aligned to the rising sun at winter solstice, but the main orientation of the passage isfocused on an extreme rising position of the moon. One of the backstones in the chamber, apparently aligned to the sun, has the vertical line. The lop edge of the sillstone in the passage has two sets of 18 lines arranged in 9 pairs. These form 8 quadrangles. The stone below this is thought to have been the lintel of the entrance at Fourknocks. The lintel of Newgrange has 8 units, each composed of 4 triangles and each probably making a year sign.

In the Irish passage mounds major compositions have been found engraved on two roof-stones. In both cases the stones have been engraved prior to being positioned above the recesses. When the beam of light strikes stone 14 at Cairn T, the roofstone is brilliantly illuminated by reflected light. Sunwheels, notably those with 8 radials, echo the pattern of sunwheels on stone 14. The Newgrange artists may well have seen this stone because they expanded brilliantly on the theme of the sun manifested in its divisions and cycles of time. The quadrangle is here directly linked to the sunwheel, and there are two spirals of 8 turnings. The double wheel suggests the sun and the moon and the concentric development of 5 ovals possibly rep resents Venus.
169



A luminous celestial object is the sole image on representing either the sunymoon or Venus looming above the horizon. These are the only three celestial objects capable of projecting beams of light and casting shadows. Because of its brilliance, Venus frequently became an object of awe in early astronomies. The 5 rings on S W 5 could represent 5 cycles of Venus equated to the 8 solar cycles oryears implied on SW 6. Venus only appears in the east before dawn and in the west near sunset. Its path in the sky bears a close resemblance to the elongated arcs on a stone in satellite K .
170



Compositions that place the sun on the right and the moon on the left are common to many cultures. It is the preferred arrangement in megalithic art. Not able exceptions seem to be confined to compositions on the southwest kerbstones of Knowth. On SW 6 a sunwheel of 8 radials is balanced by lunar crescents forming a typical polarity. The circle, in the form of large hollows, is similarly balanced by crescents at satellite K . These circles, appearing amidst 30 cupmarks, may represent the fu ll moon.
171



Pairs of stones that juxtapose lunar and solar imagery appearfrequently at Knozvth, as shown by S E $ and 6 , and N W i y and 16. Concern with the number 8 is evident as at Newgrange, and it is echoed in the kerbstones, fo r example S E $ and NW1 6. Note that SE6 has three wavy line developments of 9, / 5 and 6 turnings totalling 30. Counting from left to right and then from right to lefty the spiral is positioned at the fourteenth turning and begins the fifteenth turning, matching the fu ll moon phase and echoing its usage on NEy. Emblematic representations of the sun and moon are often enclosed in a cartouche, such as on NW$. The cartouche is a development of the oval. The Knowth artists developed powerful luni-solar imagery by synthesizing basic elements that had already emerged on the stones of Tougherew.
172









Luni-solar images are frequently circles and cres cents merged in a single emblem. The image makers usually, but not always, intended their creations to be seen illuminated by the light of the sun and/or moon. Stone 79 at Cairn L forms the backdrop fo r a stone basin, and is brilliantly illuminated, by reflected light at sunrise on the
Nov ember/February cross-quarter day. The recess at Knowth would also have been seen in the reflected light of the sun, and the imagery forms close parallels with Cairn L. Tara and Cairn L are orientated to the same sunrises and share similar luni-solar images.



The triple form of the luni-solar emblem is a variant of the double image that includes another sky symbol to represent either Venus or the stars or both. Very early observers of the sky usually did not distinguish planetsfrom stars, and Venus as the brightest star easily became representative of all
stars. The sun, the moon and the stars form a trinity in the very early history of manys ritual observation of the sky. On Knowth S W i a large emblem of the celestial triune is enclosed in a car touche. Hovering above, on the top of the stone, are 8 luni-solar emblems.



The distribution of variations of the trinity emblem is widespread. At K illin H ill a triune seems to hover over a line representing a horizon. The moon is a hollowed circle, perhaps representing its recept ive nature in reflecting the sun's light. The dot in the circle is used to represent the sun as at Cairn U ,
and this symbol of the sun persists in modern astronomy. The most comprehensive and developed imagery in megalithic art appears at Newgrange. The same concept is expanded to the power of 3 on kerbstone 32, and expressed geometrically in the form of triangles.

There are three constructs containing megalithic art which are not orientated towards the sun. Baitinglass is aligned due north in the direction of the polestar. The passages of Fourknocks and Seefin are skewed clockwise / 7 degrees east of north, and the quadrangle provides the main imagery in both. The chamber of Seefin is or ientated on the cardinal directions and the only two engraved stones are in the passage. Fourknocks is regarded as unique because its exceptionally large chamber could only have been roofed zvilh wooden beams. In the illustration (before reconstruction) the rising sun at its most northerly position at summer solstice is depicted on the right, fa r out of alignment with the passage. As Lockyer pointed out, the heliacal rising of certain stars was used by early astronomers to determine the occurrence of key calendrical events. In ancient Mesoamerican astronomy similar stra tegies have been delected, the largest group being known as the ‘ 17-degree fam ily of orientations'. At Tourknocks quadrangles that become zigzags could be images of star fields. The constellations are considered to have been the starting point fo r geometricalfigures, giving rise to the idea of a point and triangles and quadrangles. 'The entrance lintel (now placed to the left of the entrance) , theformer lintel of the exterior entrance, and the lintel of the central recess, are aligned to the stars. 'The associ
ation of quadrangular patterns and stars is common to many cultures. The (star blankets' of the Sioux Indians, fo r example, are covered in diamond-shaped patterns which can be compared to megalithic sky imagery.
184

The quadrangle appears very early in prehistoric art and could have originated as a sky symbol when the celestial pole was near the rectangular form ation of stars in the constellation Draco. The pole is always the centre around which the stars appear to revolve, regardless of the slow shift in its position as a result of the wobble in the earth ’s polar axis. It is always north and directly opposed to the sun at its highest point in the sky to the south. Early observers of the sky were aware of this relationship between the sun and the stars, and they knew that the yearly cycle of the stars (366 days) was closely correlated to the yearly cycle of the sun (363 days). This reinforced the concept of a universe that was primarily ordered by the sun. On the stone from satellite Z at the beginning of this section a solar image emanates rays which form into trian gles and quadrangles. 'This composition contains all the primary elements in megalithic art, and its main themes are derived from astronomy.
1 86



Patterns which begin to emerge at Loughcrew are morefu lly worked out in the Boyne Valley. Above, a pattern of 29 units surmounts zigzags which indicate 22 and could represent the days during which light enters the chamber. Another pattern in the chamber is composed of 9 triangles and 8 quadrangles arranged to form a large inner quad
rangle of 12 positive and negative units. It is curious that the chamber and passage of Newgrange is composed of 60 stones and the kerbstones, excluding the entrance stone (which is actually not a kerbstone) total 96. The chamber and passage of Gavrinis is constructed of 30 stones.
187



The primary• apparent motion of the sun is from east to west. The diagram represents the sun's motion in the sky at winter solstice ( i ) , equinox (2) and summer solstice (3). The sun's re appearance on the horizon suggests that its path
forms circles. In order to account fo r movement from a smaller circle to a larger circle a spiral motion is required. Hence, from earliest times the spiral represented the rotation of the sun and expressed its power.
By watching the stars at night it was observed that they loo displayed geometric characteristics that could be expressed in the same visual terms. Because of the earth\s rotation all celestial objects appear to
rise in the east and set in the west. However, if one views the stars in the direction of the polestar they appear to move anti-clockwise, orfrom right to left in an opposite motion to that of the sun.
l88



The spiral
In archaic astronom y the heavens w ere usually view ed as spiralling. A s P tolem y states, ‘ I search w ith m y m ind into the m u ltitu din ou s revo lvin g sp ira ls o f the s ta r s.’ T h e sp ira l a p p ea rs e a rly in an astron o m ical co n text in m e g a lith ic art and gain s p ro m in en ce in the B o yn e V a lle y solar co n stru cts. T h e sun m o ves in a clo ck w ise sp iral
and the stars revolve an ti-clockw ise. T h e m o o n ’ s path is not a tru e circle b u t a sp ira l w h o se su ccessive loops cross the eclip tic in a w e stw ard , an ti-clockw ise m otion opposed to the direction o f the sun and planets. O n S W 18 left-h a n d e d sp ira ls are o rgan ized in a geom etric pattern. R ight-h an ded spirals on S w 7 are balanced by a single anti-clockw ise sp iral to w h ich a circle and crescen t is attached.
189



The sun’s apparent path through the stars brings it : to its furthest points above and below the celestial • . .* equator at the solstices and on the equator at # . • equinox. The changing length and arc of the sun's shadow varies each day, corresponding to its changing position in the sky.
A t summer solstice the shadow is shortest and the arc is concave. At winter solstice the shadows are longest and the arc is convex. In archaic astronomy these were known as ‘the horns of the solstices'. At equinox the shadow is straight.
I f the shadows of the sun are correlated over a period of one year in chronological order following their curvature they form a double spiral. In winter the spiral is counter-clockwise and the coils are wide. The shadows begin to straighten as equinox approaches, and after equinox they begin to wind
into a clockwise spiral and tighten. They contract until the summer solstice and the right-hand spiral begins to expand after the solstice, straighten again at equinox and return to a left-handed spiral again in winter to continue the process perpetually.

The major compositions on the kerbstones of Newgrange are aligned with reference to the solstices. In principle, the rising and setting positions of the sun at the solstices are equidistant from the cardinal directions which form a cross dividing space into four quarters. The sun also generates time and the four quarters of the year. The cross and the circle represent the sun as a circle which generates the
cross of the quarters of time. Newgrange is an elaborate expression of this basic concept. The quadrangle and the spiral are evolved variants of the cross and circle. The circle of the sun develops into the more complex double spiral and the four quarters of the cross develop into the quadrangle. Both are prominently displayed at Newgrange, linked with astronomical alignments.



The double spiral on K 6 j tightens on the right and expands on the left, matching the year shape of the sun’s shadows. Out of the spiral emerges two quadrangles. This is an image of the universe in its totality and a true cosmogram. A further series of 2 j triangles and quadrangles are generated to complete a set of 29 units. A 30th quadrangle is on the right. This is the conventional cyclical format shown on SW 22 at Knowth. Its use seems con sistent and is surely an intentional, pre-determined arrangement. K i , 30 stones to the left of K 6 y , is an even more elaborate variation of the quadrangle and the spiral theme. Anti-clockwise spirals on the left
form a triple spiral, and the vertical line indicating the sun’s position transforms into right-handed spirals creating a cosmic swirl out of which quad rangles are formed. A minimum of intelligent participation is required to see in this ancient fixed horizon marker a celebration of the winter solstice sunrise as a symbol o f creation and the power of light over darkness. The impressive monumental display of imagery on K i is contrasted by the hidden imagery on K 1 3 . The images are occulted and sealed in the mound. It seems that the symbols, as expressions of universal totality, were regarded as having applications on both visible and invisible levels.






On K 6 y at Newgrange a double spiral generates SO units of triangles and quadrangles. The left side of K 52 is a variation using a triple spiral and 24 units in a pattern that includes a zigzag indicating 8. Like the right side (see p. 7 7 7 ), on which a representation of the number 9 clearly shows multiplication of 3, these are number symbols expressing abstract numerical concepts which have cosmological significance. The numbers used in calendrical compositions, in which schematic years or months are represented by units which are tied to the objects numbered, are Injections or one-to-one correspondences that count time.
The stones above show the widespread distri bution of variations on a fundamental theme. The separation of a formless unity into two reciprocal principles which generate a third and form the multiplicity of creation is a universal and archaic cosmological idea. In sky imagery the sun and moon represent the two opposite principles and the stars represent multiplicity. Together they make up time and space and the entire universe. The megalithic artist apparently viewed the multiplicity of the stars and the multiplicity of the ‘world’ below as originating from the same source, and both are seen to conform to basic geometrical structures.

A standing stone near the remains of Cairn N is aligned to the unusually shaped H ill of Fore and the winter solstice sunset indicated by the arrow. The left-handed spiral describes the turning of the yea r and a rayed disc hovering above a horizontal line makes a pictographic representation of the event. Barclodiad y Gawres, a cruciform passage mound believed to be aligned to summer solstice sunset, and the kerbstones of the Knowth satellites,
echo the recurring cosmological themes in unique ways, but within the canons of a traditional system. The anti-clockwise spiral is associated with the sun's winter solstice and also with the moon in lunisolar spiral compositions. The association comes from the anti-clockwise motion that the moon exhibits in its motion and the prominence of thefu ll moon in the winter sky. A t satellite mound 2 , a crescent is attached to the anti-clockwise spiral.

Some of the highly abstracted imagery in megalithic art may be representations of light. Panels offlu c tuating wave patterns occur frequently and often with direct reference to projected light beams. SW 4 is positioned opposite the S E 4 sundial composition. Straight lines could easily represent the straight shadows of equinox and the arcs may refer to the curved shadows of the solstices, so that the com position is simply a very abstract yea r sign. The spiral on the entrance stone of the nearby passage
(see p. 103) has a vertical line and the spiral is executed in straight lines making a fr e t, in contrast to the curved spirals of the Newgrange entrance stone. Patterns on kerbstone 93 are matched to the shadow of standing stone 12 of Newgrange at sunrise, winter solstice (p. 1 0 1 ) . A characteristic of the panels and the art in general are lines which build up wave fields immediately suggesting light and energy.

Although traceable back to Loughcrew the triple spiral is only fu lly developed at Newgrange. Elsewhere in the Boyne Valley, single spirals appear at Dowthydouble spirals at Knowth. It is interesting that this development relates to the sequence of mound construction, Dowth having been followed by Knowth and Newgrange. The right edge of stone 8 at Cairn T models the projected beam of light in the chamber. SW 2 at Knowth is on the path of the shadows of summer solstice cast from the standing stones outside the passage entrance. The symbolic significance of the number 8 is reflected in the number of spirals, and this theme seems to be carried over from S W i . Positioned opposite SW 2 on the other side of the mound, S E 2 (next page) seems to elaborate on the number symbolism in a way that recalls imagery at Cairn H.

The two wavy lines on S E 3 have / 7 and 16 turnings respectively, totalling 33. The top row has a left crescent which determines the beginning of the count. The stone is orientated towards the east, facing the appearance of the last crescent in the eastern sky near dawn. A count of 33 lunations brings the wavy line development back to the starting position and the reappearance of the last crescent. This is an alternative method of reckoning a month by the method of bijection. The imagery and positioning of the stone next to the sundial de monstrates that time is being measured. But pre cisely what is being measured is altogether less certain. I f S E 3 represents a day count a similar set of repeat units with the same count may represent a month count on S E 2. A wavy line of 16 turnings
emergesfrom a quadrangle on S E 2 , paralleling the lower line of S E3 . A series of what seems to be / 7 crescents is connected to the wavy line and the entire series totals 33. The count of / 7 relies on a reconstruction of the damaged part of the stone based on the spacing of the intact units. The count can never be determined with absolute certainty. More than likely it is a calendrical computation based on 33 months and an allusion is made to the 33 day count. The 33-month count could be a more compact representation of its multiple, the 99month count, which is theform ida fo r a convenient calendricalfitting into 8 years (see Dowth K 3 1 , p. 166). Some of the most interesting geometrical numbers and yea r signs are well preserved. Subsets are attached to the main wavy line and sometimes relate closely to the numerical sequence.



Conclusions
T h e art and cosm ology expressed in the Boyne Valley are a refinement o f an already ancient and evolved system that flourished at L o u g h crew and had its focal point in C airn T . Each m ound in each com plex is synchronized to the beacons o f the sun, and each displays num erous vari ations o f the same sky im agery which relates astronomical observations to cosm ic models of rotating spheres and shells and the criss-cross patterns they generate. In the final analysis the light itself em erges as the prim ary sym bol of the mound builders. T h e hum an mind tends to associate rayed circles with the sun, crescents with the moon and stars with points. Although essentially correct, these associations arc not com pletely convincing because they are subjective and observer im posed. T h e beam o f light, how ever, is not
o b se r v e r im p ose d ; it is a real p ro jectio n c o n trived by the builders themselves, directly con firming the link between the light and the images. T h e art at C airn T can be viewed at any time, but it is best experien ced in the light o f the rising su n as it illu m in ates stones L i , L 2 and L 3 b efo re flashing into the back recess. T h e greatest recog nizable achievement of the megalith builders was to create functioning structures that would operate indefinitely, conveying their leading ideas through light and symbol. Intentionally or not, they provided the m ounds with a built-in self-decoding device that places the art in context and reinforces the com m unicative power of sym bols to the extent that they becom e universal and timeless imprints of m ankind’s fascination with the sun, the moon and the stars.

“ In one of the most dramatic archaeological detective stories of our
time, Brennan, in an inspired but careful effort has opened the door
and let in the shaft of light to illuminate the silent enigmatic mounds
of Ireland’ s past. With the door open and the sunlight in, the true
inquiry now begins and the winds of debate rise. The book provides
one exciting and awesomely beautiful drama in the continuing search
for man’s intellectual past.”

“ Tombs of the dead or temples of light? Whether or not Martin
Brennan is right about the burials he is surely correct about the
alignment of the Irish megaliths and their association with the sun.
He argues that these ancient passage-graves, and the art inside them,
were elegant solar symbols and it must be said that his pioneering
research is provocative and persuasive. The combination of fieldwork
and detection in TheStars and the Stones make it an exciting book for
anyone fascinated by the puzzles of prehistory.”
