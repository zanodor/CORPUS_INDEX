Common names
Birds' Path
The name "Birds' Path" is used in several Uralic and Turkic languages
and in the Baltic languages. Northern peoples observed that
migratory birds follow the course of the galaxy[15] while migrating at
the Northern Hemisphere. The name "Birds' Path" (in Finnish,
Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Bashkir and Kazakh) has some
variations in other languages, e.g. "Way of the grey (wild) goose" in
Chuvash, Mari and Tatar and "Way of the Crane" in Erzya and
Moksha.
Milky Way
Many European languages have borrowed, directly or indirectly, the
Greek name for the Milky Way, including English and Latin.
Road to Santiago
The Milky Way was traditionally used as a guide by pilgrims traveling
to the holy site at Compostela, hence the use of "The Road to
Santiago" as a name for the Milky Way.[4] Curiously, La Voje Ladee
"The Milky Way" was also used to refer to the pilgrimage road.[16]
Ganges of the Sky
The Sanskrit name "Ganges of the Sky" (आकाशगंगा Ākāśagaṃgā) is



used in many Indian languages following a Hindu myth.
Silver River
The Chinese name "Silver River" (补မ) is used throughout East Asia,
including Korea and Vietnam. In Japan and Korea, "Silver River" (柞
မ) means galaxies in general.
River of Heaven
The Japanese name for the Milky Way is the "River of Heaven" (天の
川), as well as an alternative name in Chinese (Chinese: ॠမ; pinyin:
Tiān hé).
Straw Way
In a large area from Central Asia to Africa, the name for the Milky
Way is related to the word for straw. It has been suggested that the
term was spread by Arabs who in turn borrowed it from Armenia.[17]
Walsingham Way
In England the Milky Way was called the Walsingham Way in
reference to the shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham which is in
Norfolk, England. It was understood to be either a guide to the
pilgrims who flocked there, or a representation of the pilgrims
themselves.[18]
Winter Street
Scandinavian peoples, such as Swedes, have called the galaxy
Winter Street (Vintergatan) as the galaxy is most clearly visible
during the winter at the northern hemisphere, especially at high
latitudes where the glow of the Sun late at night can obscure it
during the summer.
