[quote]Saussure posited that no word is inherently meaningful. Rather a word is only a
"signifier." i.e., the representation of something, and it must be combined in the brain
with the "signified", or the thing itself, in order to form a meaning-imbued
"sign.“Saussure believed that dismantling signs was a real science, for in doing so we
come to an empirical understanding of how humans synthesize physical stimuli into
words and other abstract concepts.[unquote] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics

How to dismantle or identify Indus Script signifier tabernae montana, jasmine flower
I read this as a ‘sign’ signifier of tabernae montana, jasmine flower; is this an arbitrary ‘dismantling of a sign’?

Rationale for dismantling Indus Script signifier of jasmine flower - Five petals
The dismantling is context specific; the cultural context of Indus Script is a universal attempt to signify wealth resources.
A variant of the signifier on the potsherd –which
signifies five petals --occurs on other objects
with Indus Script inscriptions.
Five petals of tabernae montana divaricata, jasmine flower
Five petals of three hieroglyphs on Harappa potsherd inscription; this is a stylized variant of tabernae montana flower shown on an ivory comb of Tell Abraq

Contextual use as a hair –fragrance is SIGNIFIED by the
use of the signifier on hair-combs of Sarasvati-Sindhu
Civilization
tabernae montana, jasmine flower, hair
fragrance signifier is together with dotted
circle on the Tell Abraq ivory comb.
Why?
Because ‘Dotted circle’ as a
hieroglyph/hypertext signifies pota ‘bead’
rebus: pota ‘metal infusion’
Context is metalwork wealth resource

The glyph is tabernae montana, ‘mountain tulip’. A soft-stone flask, 6 cm. tall, from Bactria (northern Afghanistan) showing a winged female deity (?) flanked by two flowers similar to those shown on the comb from Tell Abraq.(After Pottier, M.H., 1984, Materiel funeraire e la Bactriane meridionale de l'Age du Bronze, Paris, Editions Recherche
sur les Civilisations: plate 20.150) Two flowers are similar to those shown on the comb from Tell Abraq. Ivory comb with Mountain Tulip motif and dotted circles. TA 1649 Tell Abraq. [D.T. Potts, South and Central Asian elements at Tell Abraq (Emirate of Umm al-Qaiwain, United Arab Emirates), c. 2200 BC—AD 400, in Asko Parpola and Petteri Koskikallio, South Asian Archaeology 1993: , pp. 615-666] Tell Abraq comb and axe with epigraph After Fig. 7 Holly Pittman, 1984, Art of the Bronze Age: Southeastern Iran, Western Central Asia, and the Indus Valley, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, pp. 29-30].

Tell Abraq axe with epigraph (‘tulip’ hieroglyph + a person raising his arm above his shoulder and wielding a tool + dotted circles on body) [After Fig. 7 Holly Pittman, 1984, Art of the Bronze Age:
Southeastern Iran, Western Central Asia, and the
Indus Valley, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, pp. 29-30].
Is the ’tulip’ a signifier of tagaraka, tabernae montana
or jasmine flower? Rebus: tagara ‘tin’ (Kannada);
tamara id. (Skt.) Rebus reading is indicated by the fact
that the Tell Abraq axe is perhaps made of copper + tin
metal alloy. eraka ’upraised arm’ rebus: eraka ’metal
infusion’. tabar = a broad axe (Punjabi) Rebus:
tam(b)ra ‘copper’.
Is it a tulip or tabernae montana jasmine flower?
