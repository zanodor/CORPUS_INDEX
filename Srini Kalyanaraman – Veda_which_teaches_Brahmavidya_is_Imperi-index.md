Shankara’s Commentary: Com.—‘He,’ the learned preceptor who knows the Brahman; ‘Upasannaya ' who has approached him. ‘Samyak, i.e., well, according to the sastras; ‘Prasanta chittaya,’ i.e., whose heart is subdued, who is free from such faults as pride, etc. ‘Samanvitaya,’ who has control also over the external senses, i.e., who has turned away from everything in the world. ‘By which knowledge,’ by the para vidya, ‘Aksharam’ that which has been described as imperceivable, etc., and denoted by the word Parasha, because it is all pervading; or, because it is seated in the city of the body. ‘Satyam,’ the same, because it is truth in its nature. ‘Akshara,’ because it knows no decay, because it is scathless, and because it knows no destruction. ‘Veda’ means ‘know.’ The meaning is ‘let him teach that knowledge of the Brahman, as it should be taught. This is the duty of also the preceptor, that he should make the good pupil duly approaching him, cross the sea of ignorance.
Griffith translation RV. 164.9 Upon what syllable of holy praisesong-, as twere their highest heaven, the Gods repose them, Who knows not this, what will he do with praisesong-? But they who know it well sit here assembled.

What is the purpose of Veda, enquiry? Metaphor of Vyoman as temple, enquiry into cosmic phenomena
https://tinyurl.com/s8fw6eeh
-- Metaphor of Vyoman is presented as the temple of the Sun. Rgveda presents the explanation for the cypher, 'code' of this vast void of the cosmos, using the metaphor of saptāsyas 'seven mouths' or 'seven chandas, metres'. Sāyaṇa's explanation of the metaphor: “ ।
The expression is used in RV 3.32.10, RV 10.14.8, RV 4.50.4. Enquiry or Veda into is an enquiry into the cosmos dominated by the effulgent Sun divinity. Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya explains the metaphor of saptāsyas 'seven mouths' or 'seven metres used in the mantra-s': Seven-mouthed: the seven metres are said to be his mouths. saptan āsyas are metaphors of - , - fire. (the seven tongues are , , , , , and ). Seven tongues of fire are seen as seven forms of speech uttered as seven metres or chandas.
As the tongues of fire dance in the yajnakuṇḍa, the sacred fire-altar, the gveda ṣi-s see them as seven forms of speech.
The metaphor is that speech forms are seen as the media for enquiry into the cosmic phenomena which is the form and function of the Veda.
