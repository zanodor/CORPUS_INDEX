Scythian Kurgans and the “Royal Tombs of Ur“
Materials for the identification of the “-3rd” millennium
“Royal Tombs” of Ur (Bible-fundamentalist date) as actually 1st millennium burials of
Scythians rulers (ancient Greek dates) who according to this author are known in the
cuneiform literature as the enigmatic Guti (Qutheans) who – according to ancient Greek
historiography – helped Iranian Medes and Mesopotamian Chaldaeans to destroy the
8th/7th century Empire Assyrians with Ninos as greatest and Sharakos as last ruler who
according to this author - are known in cuneiform as -23rd century (Bible
fundamentalist dates) imperial “Old-Akkadians” with Naramsin as greatest and
Sharkalisharri as last ruler

Herodotos of Halicarnassos [-5th century]: The History, Book 1; 74, 103 ff.
“A horde of the nomad Scythians / sought refuge in the land of the Medes. / Kyaxares /
who at first dealt well with these Scythians, being suppliants for his protection; and
esteeming them very highly he delivered boys to them to learn their speech and the art of
shooting with the bow. / Kyaxares / first banded the men of Asia into separate divisions,
that is to say, he first arrayed apart from one another the spearmen and the archers and the
horsemen. / And having gathered together all his subjects he marched upon Nineveh / And
when he had fought a battle with the Assyrians and had defeated them, while he was
sitting down before Nineveh there came upon him a great army of Scythians, and the
leader of them was Madyas the son of Protohyas, king of the Scythians. These had
invaded Asia / and / had come to the land of Media. / Then the Medes fought with the
Scythians, and having been worsted in the battle they lost their power, and the Scythians
obtained rule over all Asia. Thence they went on to invade Egypt; and when they were in
Syria which is called Palestine, Psammetichos king of Egypt met them; and by gifts and
entreaties he turned them from their purpose, so that they should not advance any further. /
For eight-and-twenty years then the Scythians were rulers of Asia. / Then Kyaxares
with the Medes, having invited the greater number of them to a banquet, made them drunk
and slew them; and thus the Medes recovered their power, and had rule over the same
nations as before; and they also took Nineveh / and made the Assyrians subject to them
excepting only the land of Babylon.”
Where are the remains of those Scythians in Mesopotamia?

The so-called Royal Tombs of Ur
A total of about 1,850 burials were uncovered. Less than one percent, i.e.,
only 16 were described as untypical or "royal tombs" containing many valuable
artifacts, including the Standard of Ur. Most of the “royal tombs” were dated by Leonard
Woolley to about -2600. The finds included the unlooted tomb of a “queen” thought to be
Queen Shubad (Akkadian: Puabi) – the name is known from a cylinder seal found in the
tomb, although there were two other seals lacking names in the same tomb. The name
Shubad (Puabi) is not found in the “Sumerian” kinglist. Therefore, cautious scholars
merely call her “Lady Puabi”.
EARLY DYNASTIC I Ur (-2700 to -2600).
The Sumerian King List names eight antediluvian kings who supposedly reigned for tens
of thousands of years, but it is not known if these names have any historical basis. The
royal tombs of Ur contain the graves of a certain Mes-Kalam-dug as well as some
A-Kalam-dug, among others, that probably date to this period.
1st Dynasty of Ur (-2600 to -2370).
Epigraphic evidence, however, shows that these dynasties (and a dynasty at Mari) were all
contemporary and date to c. 2700–2600 B.C.E. Many rulers known from contemporary
inscriptions are not found in the King Lists.

Ur in the “Sumerian” Kinglist [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr211.htm]
Lines 134-147:
In Urim, Mec-Ane-pada became king; he ruled for 80 years. Mec-ki-aj-Nanna (ms. P2+L2 has instead: Mec-ki-aj-nuna), the son of Mec-Ane-pada, became king; he ruled for 36 (ms. P2+L2 has instead: 30) years. Elulu ruled for (mss. L1+N1, P2+L2, P3+BT14 have:) 25 years. Balulu ruled for (mss. L1+N1, P2+L2, P3+BT14 have:) 36 years. (mss. L1+N1, P2+L2 have:) 4 kings; they ruled for (mss. L1+N1, P2+L2, P3+BT14 have:) 171 years. Then Urim was defeated and the kingship was taken to Awan.
[The first dynasty is believed to have ended by an attack of Sargon of Akkad around 2340 BC. Not much is known about the so-called second dynasty, when the city supposedly was in eclipse. Only burials are attributed to “Ur II.” No “Sumerian” text counts the dynasties. Thus a 2nd dynasty is not really attested for.]
Lines 341-354: [“Ur-III” Dynasty; actually IInd Dynasty]
In Urim, Ur-Namma became king; he ruled for 18 years. Culgi, the son of Ur-Namma, ruled for 46 (mss. Su3+Su4, TL have instead: 48) (ms. P5 has instead: 58) years. Amar-Suena, the son of Culgi,
ruled for 9 (ms. Su3+Su4 has instead: 25) years. Cu-Suen, the son of Amar-Suena, ruled for 9 (ms. P5 has instead: 7) (ms. Su1 has instead: 20 + X) (ms. Su3+Su4 has instead: 16) years. Ibbi-Suen, the son of Cu-Suen, ruled for 24 (mss. P5, Su1 have instead: 25) (ms. Su3+Su4 has instead: 15) (ms. TL has instead: 23 (?)) years. 4 kings; they ruled for 108 years (mss. J, P5, Su1, Su3+Su4 have instead: 5 kings; they ruled for (ms. P5 has:) 117 (ms. Su1 has instead: 120 + X) (ms. Su3+Su4 has instead: 123) years). Then Urim was defeated (ms. P5 has instead: Then the reign of Urim was abolished). (ms. Su3+Su4 adds:) The very foundation of Sumer was torn out (?). The kingship was taken to Isin.



Since there is no 2nd dynasty at Ur, it must have been the city‟s first dynasty that was
brought down by the „Old-Akkadians“ (-24th century; Bible-fundamentalist date.)
Since the ruthless Guti (Qutheans) helped the “Sumerians” to bring down the
Naramsin-“Old-Akkadians” in the -23rd century (Bible-fundamentalist date) like the
Scythians helped the Chaldaeans and the Medes to bring down the Ninos-Assyrians in
the -7th century (date of ancient Greek historiography), Guti/Qutheans=Scythians
must have had bases somewhere in Mesopotamia. After all, “for eight-and-twenty
years then the Scythians were rulers of Asia” (Herodotus).
The author claims, since 1988 (DIE SUMERER GAB ES NICHT), that one of these bases
must have been located at Ur before the emergence of its “IIIrd” dynasty (factually its
IInd dynasty) because one finds kurgan type graves with human sacrifices of vassals
and servants that are widely known from the realms of the Scythians. Therefore, the
“Royal” tombs of Ur should not only contain indigenous Mesopotamean artefacts but
also motifs and items influenced by the culture known from Guti/Quthean=Scythian
sites.
Thesis on “Royal Toms” Ur as a temporary -7th century Scythian base



Who were the people buried in Ur‟s “Royal Tombs”?
The question still begs an answer!
“Who then were the people who received such rites?”
(P.R.S. Moorey, Ur of the Chaldees, Ithaca/NY, 1982, 89 f.)
“Many scholars have wrestled with the questions of who the people were
who were entitled to such extraordinary ritual attention in their death”
(Susan Pollock, Ancient Mesopotamia, Cambridge, 1999, 211.)
“Did the graves really contain remains of Sumerian royalty? /
The mortuary practices in the Royal Tombs are unparalleled
elsewhere in Mesopotamia, and they seem to have been an
aberration unique to Ur within Sumerian culture?”
(Paul G. Bahn, The Archaeology Detectives, Lewes/East Sussex, 2001, 136 f.;
emphasis added.)



Worn teeth of common “Sumerians” (eating grain with stone and sand debris)
versus
much better preserved teeth of people in the “Royal tombs” of Ur (eating meat?)
“I have never seen human teeth worn down to the degree found in the al-„Ubaid people
(in the vicinity of Ur, and older than the “Royal tombs”). In eight of them – four men
and four women – the upper incisors were worn down almost to the level of their
sockets / but caries was almost entirely absent. / Dr. Buxton reports the extreme degree
of wear to be seen in the teeth of the Kishites (“Sumerian” city of Kish) of the latter
part of the third millennium (slightly younger than the “Royal tombs” of Ur). /
In the Ur (“Royal tombs”) group – also much less tooth wear. / The wear, making all
allowances for the age of the individuals, was much less in men and women of Ur”
(Arthur Keith, “Report on the Human Remains”,
in Ur Excavations, vol. I, Oxford, 1927, 217 ff.



Well known Rulers
without traces in Mesopotamia?
“For eight-and-twenty years then the SCYTHIANS were rulers of Asia”
(HERODOTUS).

Unknown (“Alien”) Rulers
Buried in the Royal Tombs of Ur:
“In Sumerian literature there was no hint of human sacrifice
forming part of a royal funeral, and such a practice was alien to
all known Sumerian tradition”
(Leonard WOOLLEY, The Excavations at Ur: A Record of Twelve
Years’ Work, NY, 1963, 78; emphasis added).



A SYNOPSIS OF PARALLES BETWEEN
UR‟S “ROYAL TOMBS” AND SCYTHIAN KURGANS
Many of these parallels were first pointed out by
Charles GINENTHAL (Pillars of the Past, New York, 2003) in his defence of the
author‟s identification of the “Royal tombs” of Ur (Bible-fundamentalist date of
-2600) with tombs of Scythian princes dominating Mesopotamia in the -7th century
(dates of ancient Greek historiography).
See further Charles Ginenthal,
“Arguments of Straw: Dwardu Cardona and Pillars of the Past”, in The Velikovskyan,
Vol. VII, No. 1, 2006; Supplement 2007).



Female Warrriors or Amazones with whetstones
in “Sumerian” Royal tombs as well as Scythian kurgans
“One grave, tomb 1054, left Wooley perplexed. / In the stone chamber itself was a host
of weapons, including a dagger at the side of the principal occupant. But there was one
hitch: Woolley determined that the remains were those of a woman. / Her skeleton was
found wearing a hair ribbon, two golden wreaths, and a gold pin, all typical for high
status women. / A gold head piece and a dagger and whetstone at her waist was typical
for Sumerian men. / Also in the stone chamber were a bronze ax, dagger, and hatchet. /
Other researchers attribute these weapons to the male attendants in the room. But
McCaffrey notes that the attendants lack rings, weapons on their bodies, or any sign of
elite materials, suggesting that they were [sacrificed] servants.
(Andrew Lawler,“Ur‟s Xena: A Warrior Princess of Sumeria”, in Science, 5 August
2005: 868-869.)
“In this (Scythian grave) were two skeletons; the main burial was of a woman, but at
her feet lay the body of a young man of about eighteen years old. It was fairly rich. /
Next to her lay a bronze mirror. / To her left at the head end lay two iron spear points,
and / a smooth square plate that had been used as a whetstone. / Here is the grave of a
woman warrior of some social standing whose young male servant was killed to
accompany her on her death journey”
(Lynn Webster Wilde, On the Trail of the Women Warriors, New York, 2000, 47 f.)



“Royal” tombs consisted of a vaulted or domed stone tomb chamber set at the bottom of
a deep pit, to which a sloped ramp going down some 5 meters provided access. The
principal body lay in the chamber, buried with substantial quantities of goods, sometimes
including a sled or wheeled vehicles pulled by oxen or equids. Personal and household
attendants lay in the tomb chamber with the deceased ruler or princess (lady, queen).
Leonard Woolley at Ur (1922)



The “Sumerians” developed the arch, which enabled them to develop a strong type
of roof. The tomb featured a vaulted chamber set at the bottom of a deep
"death pit";

The Sumerian craftsmanship with wood, stone, ivory, semi-precious stones and, above all,
gold was astonishing. The evidence is before us at the British Museum in London, the
University Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and, nearer its origins, at the Baghdad
Museum in Iraq. Gold cups, helmets, bracelets, garlands and chains of delicate workmanship
are now on display that reveal an exceptional understanding of how to exploit gold's
malleability, ductility and resilience. "Sumerian jewellery fulfilled practically all the
functions which were to occur during the course of history," the jewellery historian Guido
Gregorietti observed. "In fact, there were more different types of jewellery than there are
today."
The treasures reveal how well the Sumerian goldsmiths understood working with gold. They
used different alloys and cast cold either solid or hollow ornaments. Using the lost-wax
technique, they chased veins on leaves or grooves on beads. Jugs or cups could be beaten into
shape from a flat sheet of gold, using sophisticated heat treatment. They beat gold into thin
foil or ribbon. "Sumerian work is flavoured with amazing sophistication ... delicacy of touch,
fluency of line, a general elegance of conception," wrote jewellery expert Graham Hughes.
"All suggest that the goldsmiths' craft emerged almost fully fledged in early Mesopotamia."

“Sumerian” Gold Work
“Sumerian” Ceremonial dagger
“Looking at this remarkable ceremonial dagger it is hard to believe it was made
about 4000 years ago. The blade was made of gold, its shaft of blue lapis lazuli
decorated with gold. The dagger does not look like any of the other Sumerian art;
therefore, it is hard to believe it was made there. It actually looks more like Islamic
art with its fine decorations; in fact an expert once took it to be Arab work of the
thirteenth century CE.” (Woolley, Excavations, 60).

The headdress is much wider than a female skull.
For this oversized jewellery to fit a woman
comfortably her had would have to be twice the
normal width and height of a woman’s head.
To not fall on the woman‟s shoulders it must
“have been supported by padding or (an
enormous) whig” (University of Pennsylvania
Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology,
photo caption.)



“Wealthy Scythian women, it seems, were literally covered in gold from head to toe,
wearing such items as a headdress covered in 243 gold plaques depicting gorgon
heads, rosettes, lotuses and palmettes, a dress decorated with gold plates showing
various fantastical scenes, and shoes also appliqued in gold. A rare depiction of a
Scythian woman, on a golden diadem excavated one hundred years ago, is probably
of the principal Scythian deity, Tabiti (cat. #40). Here she holds a mirror, objects
frequently found in women's burials throughout Central Asia (several bronze
examples are in this exhibit), and is surrounded by men playing instruments and
participating in ritual drinking.”
