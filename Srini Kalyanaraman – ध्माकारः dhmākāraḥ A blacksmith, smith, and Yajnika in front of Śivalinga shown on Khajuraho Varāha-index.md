ध्माकारः dhmākāraḥ A blacksmith, smith, and Yajnika in
front of Śivalinga shown on Khajuraho Varāha
--shown on front heels of Khajuraho Varāha with (dh)makara, 'composite animals' Indus Script cipher and a water-cistern PLUS Śivalinga with a worshipper in front.
Clearly, the Khajuraho Varāha is a temple venerating three avatāra -- Varāha, Narasimha, Śrī K ̥rṣṇa.
At the feet of Khajuraho Varaha, on the front heels are sculptural friezes signifying ध्माकारः dhmākāraḥ A blacksmith and yajnika venerating Śivalinga. A tribute to artificers who created wealth of the nation.
I would deeply appreciate a sharp image of the left front heel showing the yajnika and Śivalinga.
ध्माकारः dhmākāraḥ A blacksmith, smith make their offerings with sculptural friezes below the heels of Khajuraho Varāha. What do the images on the left heels signify? I need help with readigs of the friezes. I also need help with sharp images of all the four heels.
Images of Right heels.
