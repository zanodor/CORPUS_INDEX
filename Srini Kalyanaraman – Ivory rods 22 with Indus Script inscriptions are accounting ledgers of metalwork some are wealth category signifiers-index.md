Thus, the message signified by dotted circles and X hieroglyph refers to dh ̆āvaḍ priest of 'iron-smelters'. The aquatic duck shown atop an ivory rod is: karaṇḍa 'duck' (Sanskrit) karaṛa 'a very large aquatic bird' (Sindhi) Rebus: करडा [karaḍā] Hard from alloy--iron, silver &c. (Marathi) Thus, the metalworker (smelter) works with hard alloys (using carburization process). Three dotted circles: kolom 'three' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge'. Thus working with minerals and hard alloys for smithy, forge. Hieroglyphs: Dotted circles

Dotted circles and three lines on the obverse of many Failaka/Dilmun seals are read rebus as hieroglyphs:
Hieroglyph: ḍāv m. ʻdice-throwʼ rebus: dhāu 'ore'; dãu ʻtyingʼ, ḍāv m. ʻdice-throwʼ read rebus: dhāu 'ore' in the context of glosses: dhā̆ vaḍ m. ʻa caste of iron smelters', dhāvḍī ʻcomposed of or relating to ironʼ. Thus, three dotted circles signify: tridhāu, tri-dhātu 'three ores' (copper, tin, iron).

Ivory sticks as cylinder seals, Mohenjo-daro
I suggest that the 'dotted circle' is of significance as a rebus representation of Meluhha metalwork with mineral ores in case the hypertext is demonstrated to have been used by Meluhha speakers or Meluhha artisans or those in Ancient Near East familiar with the Indus Script hypertext tradition. In Meluhha hypertext tradition smelting of minerals is signified by 'dotted circle' hypertext.
Indus Script inscriptions on ivory artifacts signify metalwork wealth accounting
John Marshall wrote about five ivory rods discovered in Mohenjodaro as seals: "Seals of this group [cylinder seals, although Mackay above is not sure they are true cylinder seals]], if indeed they are seals, are very rarely found at Mohenjo-daro, only five specimen being obtained in all. They are all made of ivory and differ from the cylinder seals of other countries in being very long and thing; nor are they perforated for suspension on a cord. It is possible that these so-called seals are not true seals at all. The incised characters upon them might conceivably be identification marks for a game or something similar. On the other hand, they are certainly suitable for use a seals and in this account they are included in this chapter For the sake of clearness the actual seal is shown side by side with each impression." (John Marshall, ed., 1931, Mohenjo-daro and the Indus civilization: being an official account of archaeological excavations at Mohenjo-Daro carried out by the government of India between the years 1922 and 1927, Vol. 1, London, Arthur Probsthain, p.371)

The 5 ivory rod inscriptions (529 to 533 Marshall) are flipped left horizontally and presnted with rebus readings:
No 529 (Pl. CXIV, HR 5515). Ivory. 2.7 inches long by 0.25 in. in diameter. Double groove at one end for attachment of cord. The other end is decorated with three parallel grooves. Level, 4 feet below surface. Central Courtyard (30), House LIII, Block 7, HR Area.
(529 Marshall Ivory rod inscription) kolom 'three' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge'. khareḍo 'a currycomb' (G.) Rebus: kharādī ' turner' (G.) karṇīka, kanka 'rim of jar' rebus: karṇī 'Supercargo' karṇaka 'scribe, engraver, account' kaṇīka 'helmsman/steersman'; karã 'wristlets, bangles' rebus: khār 'blacksmith' sal 'splinter' rebus: sal 'workshop' khāṇḍā 'notch' rebus: kaṇḍa 'implements' Fish-fin: ayo, aya 'fish' rebus: aya 'iron' ayas 'alloy metal' PLUS khambhaṛā ʻfinʼ rebus: kammaṭa 'mint, coiner, coinage'. Thus, the message is: Blacksmith, Turner, Supercargo (engraver), steersman, implements workshop, mint-master/coiner, (working in) smithy/forge. (529 and 530 ivory rods have identical inscriptions. Both the rods show three linear strokes, at the bottom edge).



13
No 530 (Pl. CXIV, HR 4985). Ivory. 2.05 inches long by 0.25 in. in diameter. Double groove at one end for a cord; the other end is broken. Level 3 feet below surface. Central Courtyard (30), House LIII, Block 7, HR Area.
(530 Marshall Ivory rod inscription) kolom 'three' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge'. khareḍo 'a currycomb' (G.) Rebus: kharādī ' turner' (G.) karṇīka, kanka 'rim of jar' rebus: karṇī 'Supercargo' karṇaka 'scribe, engraver, account' kaṇīka 'helmsman/steersman'; karã 'wristlets, bangles' rebus: khār 'blacksmith' sal 'splinter' rebus: sal 'workshop' khāṇḍā 'notch' rebus: kaṇḍa 'implements' Fish-fin: ayo, aya 'fish' rebus: aya 'iron' ayas 'alloy metal' PLUS khambhaṛā ʻfinʼ rebus: kammaṭa 'mint, coiner,
coinage'. Thus, the message is: Blacksmith, Turner, Supercargo (engraver), steersman, implements workshop, mint-master/coiner, (working in) smithy/forge.
No 531 (Pl. CXIV, DK 2666). Ivory. Now 2.05 inches long by 0.3 in. in diameter. Its polish shows that it has been much used. About one-half of the seal is covered



14
with an inscription, deeply and roughly incised and bordered by two deep cut lines. One end of the seal is shaped into a conical head with a deep groove possibly intended for a cord. The seal is not bored; nor is it perfectly round. Level, 4 feet below surface. Street between Blocks 1 and 2, Section B, DK Area.
(531 Marshall Ivory rod inscription) dula 'two' rebus: dul 'metal casting' khareḍo 'a currycomb' (G.) Rebus: kharādī ' turner' (Gujarati) kamaṭha 'bow and arrow' rebus: kammaṭa 'mint, coiner, coinage' ayo, aya 'fish' rebus: aya 'iron' ayas 'metal' PLUS khambhaṛā 'fish-fin' rebus: kammaṭa 'mint, coiner, coinage'; dãtɔ m. a kind of rake or harrow (Gujarati) rebus: dhatu 'mineral'' khāṇḍā 'notch' rebus: kaṇḍa 'implements' PLUS koḍa 'one' rebus: koḍ 'workshop'. Thus, the message is: Turner of metal castings, mint-master-coiner, metal (alloys), minerals, iron (metal) implements workshop.
No 532 (Pl. CXIV, VS 875). Ivory. Now 2 inches long by 0.3 in. in diameter. One end is broken and a small piece is missing. The seal tapers slightly towards its complete end. Five deeply incised characters occupy a space of about two-thirds of the circumference of the seal. Level, 12 feet below surface. Found in front of Room 70, House XXVII, VS Area.
(532 Marshall Ivory rod inscription) kuṭi 'water carrier' rebus: kuṭhi 'smelter' dula 'two' rebus: dul 'metal casting' PLUS karṇika 'spread legs' rebus: karṇī 'Supercargo' karṇīka 'helmsman' meḍ 'body' rebus: meḍ 'iron' med 'copper' (Slavic)



15
baṭa 'rimless pot' rebus: bhaṭa 'furnace' gaṇḍa 'four' rebus: kaṇḍa 'implements'. Thus the message is: Smelter, metalcaster, Supercargo/Helmsman responsible for/working with iron/copper implements and furnace.
No 533 (Pl. CXIV, VS 958). Ivory. 2.75 inches long by 0.3 in. in diameter. Decorated at 0-.5 in. from each end with a deeply incised cross-hatched border. Towards one end of the intervening space are two deeply incised characters This seal is not perfectly round. Level, 10 feet below surface of the ground. From Room 69, House XXVIII, VS Area.
(533 Marshall Ivory rod inscription) khaṇḍa 'divisions'; rebus: kaṇḍa 'implements' dhāv 'strand' dhāv 'string' rebus: dhāvaḍ 'smelter' dhaṭo 'claws of crab' rebus: dhatu 'minerals'. Thus the message is: Smelter of minerals, (maker of metal) implements.
Fourteen Indus Script inscriptions on ivory objects (including 3 ivory plaques and ivory cube from Mohenjodaro and one ivory rod from Harappa) have been found after the report of Marshall on five ivory rods detailed above.
Thus, there are a total of nineteen inscriptions on ivory objects in Indus Script Corpora.. The details of the additional fourteen inscriptions on ivory objects are deciphered in the following sections (Ivory inscription 6 to Ivory inscription 19).

Ivory rod, ivory plaques with dotted circles. Mohenjo-daro (Musee National De Arts
Asiatiques, Guimet, 1988-1989, , Les cites oubliees de l’Indus Archeologie du Pakistan.]
The fillet worn on the forehead and on the right-shoulder signifies one strand; while the trefoil on the shawl signifies three strands. A hieroglyph for two strands is also signified. Semantics of single strand of rope and three strands of rope are: 1. Sindhi dhāī f. ʻ wisp of fibres added from time to time to a rope that is being twisted ʼ, Lahnda dhāī ̃ id.; 2. tridhāˊtu - ʻ threefold ʼ (RigVeda).
Single strand (one dotted-circle)
Two strands (pair of dotted-circles)
Three strands (three dotted-circles as a trefoil)
There are orthographic variants with one, two or three dotted circles with X hieroglyph as circumscript. Semantic elucidations for a single dotted circle as a cross-section view of a strand (for e.g. of rope or twisted rope with three strands): dhātu, dhāū, dhāv 'red stone mineral' or two minerals: dul PLUS dhātu, dhāū, dhāv 'cast minerals' or tri- dhātu, -dhāū, -dhāv 'three minerals' to create metal alloys'.

So-called 'plant-like' and 'trident-shaped' markings have been found on fragments of pottery dating back 5500 years. According to Dr Richard Meadow of Harvard University, the director of the Harappa Archaeological Research Project, these primitive inscriptions found on pottery may pre-date all other known writing. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/334517.stm http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/scie nce/nature/334517.stm A rebus reading of the hieroglyph is: tagaraka, tabernae montana. Rebus: tagara ‘tin’ (Kannada); tamara id. (Skt.) Allograph: ṭagara ‘ram’. Since tagaraka is used as an aromatic unguent for the hair, fragrance, the glyph gets depicted on a stone flask, an ivory comb and axe of Tell Abraq.

A significant find of Mosonszentjános in Hungary reported in a brilliant, scintillating Archaeological excursus by István Koncz and Zsuzsanna Tóth is that the ivory game pieces signified by dotted circles were found in the graves of guild of mine workers.
A significant find of Dennys Frenez reported in a brilliant, scintillating analytical piece on Gonur Tepe archaeological finds of ivories with dotted circles is that the ivory came from Indian elephants. Both these reports are relatable to the most significant event narrated in Bhāratīya Itihāsa of the game of dice in Mahābhārata which resulted in two acts of adharma: Yudhiṣṭhira offering Draupadi as a wager and Duryodhana attempting to disrobe Draupadi in public. This is followed by the act of dharma by Śri K ̥rṣṇa rescuing Draupadi from the indignity. These powerful narratives, 1. finds of Mosonzzetanos; 2. finds of Gonur Tepe and 3. dice game in Mahābhārata are matched by the fact that the Indus Script rebus words associated with dice are datable from 7th millennium BCE attested in R̥ gveda.
