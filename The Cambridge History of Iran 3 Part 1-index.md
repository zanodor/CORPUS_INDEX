EDITORIAL NOTE
Efforts have been made to achieve a measure of consistency in the transcription ofIranian words andproper names. However, ambiguities in the spelling andpronunciation of Middle-Iranian words make complete consistency neither possible nor desirable. In some cases different spellings represent different readings or opinions (e.g. Kartir/Kerdir/ Kirter); in others variant forms aresufficiently current to warrantnoninterference (e.g. Hormazd/Hormizd); yet in others different spellings are dictated by theperiod or the context (e.g. Ahura Mazda/Ohrmazd/ Hormizd, Artaxser/Ardashir, Stakhr/Istakhr, xwarmahlx"arra\farralj). Therefore a number of alternative spellings have been allowed. In a few cases the difference stems from the useof classical or anglicized forms (e.g. Chorasmia/Khwarazm, Chosroes/Khusrau, Bushahr/Bushire). It is also worth adding a note on the transliteration of Russian (which turns up primarily in the citration of sources). With manuscripts coming in over a number of years, and from scholars in various disciplines, writing their original contributions in several different languages, it seemed neither prudent norpracticable to impose a single system of transliteration.
Each Part of the Volume is preceded bya short editorial note to place the chapters of that Part in perspective. Cross references areused in the footnotes to indicate or coordinate discussions of the same subject in different contexts, or to point out divergent views [normally in square brackets]. The bibliography to each chapter serves both to provide the details of the works referred to in the footnotes and to bring together a comprehensive selection of publications for the benefit of researchers. A general review andsynthesis of the topics treated in thevolume is attempted in the Introduction.
Invitations to contributors began to go outmore than tenyears ago. Whereas some chapters were received as late as 1980 a fewwere written in theearly seventies and themajority in themiddle seventies. Although the authors have been able to check the proofs inthe period 1977-80 and bring the bibliographies generally up to date and even make useof recent publications, the reader should bear in mind that the occasional absence of some recent works in the bibliographies cannot reflect on the diligence of the authors but is attributable to thelong process that

INTRODUCTION
This volume encompasses a time span of about one thousand years, from the emergence of the Seleucid empire in 312 B.C. to thecollapse of the Sasanian empire in A.D. 651. The period saw therise and fall of three mighty dynasties, theSeleucids, theArsacids, and theSasanians, as well as theformation of a number of states andempires to theeast, notably the Greco-Bactrian kingdom and the Kushan empire. In the religious sphere themillennium witnessed theexpansion of gnostic tendencies in western Iran and Mesopotamia, culminating in the appearance and spread of Manichaeism; theconsolidation of Zoroastrianism under the Sasanians asanauthoritarian state Church; and the birth and suppression of the egalitarian movement of the Mazdakites. In more general terms, the era saw the ascendency and demise ofHellenism inIran; the development of a distinct Iranian art-style with wide impact; theevolution ofa national saga; thedevelopment of local systems of writing in the major provinces; and finally, the shaping of an administrative system and court procedures which were to play an important role in the 'Abbasid caliphate andits eastern vassal states.
THE HISTORY OF THE PERIOD
Seleucus, oneof Alexander's generals, seized Babylon in 312 B.C. and forged a large empire which included most of western Asia. The eastern provinces of the empire, however, where the Parthians, Bactrians, Sogdians andChorasmians lived, didnotremain long in thepossession of the Seleucids, slipping away from their hold when the satrapies of Bactria and Parthia aspired to sovereignty. The defection in 246 B.C. of Diodotus, satrap of Bactria, marked thebeginning of a new dynasty, the Greco-Bactrian, which gradually expanded southward, occupying the Kabul valley, the Peshawar region, and Taxila in the Punjab. Eventually this led to the formation of other dynasties with a southward bent - the Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian and Indo-Parthian. They controlled Afghanistan, northwestern India, and sometimes beyond, before the Kushans, leading some powerful Saka tribes, supplanted them in the 1st century A.D.1

INTRODUCTION
In 238 B.C.,1 or possibly ten years earlier, the Parni, a tribe of the Dahae confederacy inTransoxiana, invaded Parthia and established the Arsacid dynasty, which was torule inIran for some 500 years. Having first challenged the Seleucid power in Parthia and Hyrcania, the Arsacids pressed westward eventually capturing Babylon under Mithradates I in 141 B.C. and turning their kingdom into an empire; the Seleucids were forced toretreat to Syria and Asia Minor.
The Seleucid rule over the western Iranian territories, then, lasted some 170 years, andover eastern Iran less than 70.However, the successor Greek dynasties in the east, and the Greek colonies which were settled in Alexandrias, Antiochias and other widely established cities, remained aninstrument ofHellenization long after the Seleucid sovereignty had been eclipsed inIran.
In the end the vigour and vitality ofthe Arsacids declined and their empire deteriorated into a number ofbickering kingdoms, thus exposing the country to humiliating defeats atthe hands of Roman emperors. A new force then gathered and took shape inPersis, giving rise to the Sasanian dynasty, bent on restoring the land toits erstwhile power and prestige. Ardashir I, the founder ofthis dynasty, defeated his Arsacid overlord c. A.D. 224 and united the country under his banner. True to his aspirations, he invaded theRoman eastern provinces in 230 and again in 238, and conquered the fortified cities ofNisibis, Carrhae and Hatra. His able son Shapur I, heading an army whose confidence had been reinforced andmorale strengthened, continued his father's drive east and west. He conquered new territories and overthrew the Romans in cities of Syria and Asia Minor, even taking the emperor Valerian prisoner in 259. Under this monarch the Sasanian empire reached its greatest extent, stretching, according to Shapur's great inscription on the Kacba-yi Zardusht atNaqsh-i Rustam, from Central Asia and Chinese Turkistan tothe Indus valley and from Anatolia and Caucasia to the southern shores of the Persian Gulf.
Some four hundred years after the rise of Ardashir to power, Khusrau II Parvez conquered Jerusalem in thecourse of a striking military operation and had hisgenerals drive almost to thegates of Constantinople. One might have thought then that theempire was experiencing a newsurge of strength; but when this spectacular

INTRODUCTION
achievement was followed by an even more spectacular defeat, followed by aperiod of chaotic rule and internal strife, itbecame evident that the Sasanians were now a spent force, the splendours of Khusrau IFs reign being the swan song of their empire. A plethora of ephemeral claimants to the throne revealed aninner weakness in the body politic of the country, which made it lose itssense of direction and purpose. The dynasty was doomed and fell to theonslaught of a small army of inspired Arabs inconditions reminiscent ofthe fall ofthe Arsacids.A new world order emerged now under the banner ofIslam which subsumed andincorporated several Middle Eastern societies - Syrian, Mesopotamian, Iranian and Central Asian - which had exhausted their energies in the course of their social and political endeavours.
The millennium, of which the bare political outline isdrawn above, is interesting to the historian for several reasons. Not only does it encompass the rise and fall of a number ofsignificant empires and the growth and decline of several religious systems, but italso offers tothe student of history an uncommon interplay of cultural currents - ancient Middle Eastern, Greek, Iranian, Indian, and Central Asian - in an area vast enough to allow apanoramic view of their interactions.
THE SOURCES
The first business of the historian is to ascertain the facts, the raw material for his analysis. He then hopes todiscover generalities which will explain as many ofthe facts as possible, enabling him to arrange these facts inintelligible patterns. Such patterns may then be used for comparison with similar ones of other times and places in order to arrive at a more comprehensive sense of historical experience. Only then may one dare pose such tantalizing questions as: what rules govern cultural relations when societies ofdifferent background and achievement are thrown together? How do societies respond tophysicalor social challenges when they have exhausted their own inner resources? What makes cultures prosper and wilt, religious systems work or fail ? Accordingly, the primary task ofthis volume has been to determine and set down the facts of Iranian history between the fall of two mighty empires, the Achaemenian and the Sasanian, inan intelligible fashion; and here the historian faces his first major problem. Large, and sometimes, crippling gaps in our information make a coherent and wellordered narrative of events extremely difficult. Adequate sourcesfor

INTRODUCTION
some periods or areas are lacking. Such is the case, forinstance, with regard to thereligious organization andcivic administration of the Iranians under the Seleucids, orthe events taking place inEastern Iran, Transoxiana and the adjoining lands during the millennium. The remains of the long centuries of Parthian hegemony, whether epigraphic or archaeological, are dismally few.1 We are somewhat better informed about theSasanian times, particularly the 3rdcentury, for which wepossess a number of rock inscriptions and reliefs, notably those of Shapur I and the high-priest Kartlr (or Kirder). We have also ample written reports from both Iran andByzantium for the later Sasanian period from Khusrau I (531-79) onward. Unfortunately we are practically in the dark as regards the events and currents of the middle period, such as thedevelopments in religious thought and practice, and the westward movement of Central Asian tribes - the Huns,the Hephthalites, and the Turks - which seriously affected the course of Iranian history. We areequally ill informed on social organizations, economic affairs, and the intellectual concerns ofthe period.
One must bear inmind that inIran the imparting ofknowledge and lore was based mostly on oral transmission.2 As aresult, written sources for thehistory of the period aresparse. In fact, nota single book survives from pre-Islamic Iran. This scarcity of written documents is not, however, wholly due tothe paucity of production. Many were lost or destroyed during the course of Iran's turbulent history. The Sasanians, in their calculated attempt to promote their legitimacy, deliberately obliterated many vestiges of Parthian sovereignty.3 One can also imagine how the conquering Arab armies or zealous Persian converts must have treated the Zoroastrian books or all that they considered tobe evidence of "pagan" Iran. But itis mostly the long centuries of internecine wars in Islamic times, resulting in the destruction of cities and monuments, that have deprived us ofall but a fraction ofthe remains ofpre-Islamic Iran. Thus, inthe sites ofsuch ancient cities as Balkh, Marv, Nlshapur, Rhagae, and Ecbatana there is not a single historical monument of the period standing; many cities like Gundishapur, Ctesiphon, Shiz and Bishapur have disappeared entirely.
To this quantitative problem of sources originating in Iran itself, we must add some qualitative ones. The Iranians, unlike the Greeks who possessed a propensity for recording factual data and a searching

INTRODUCTION
curiosity about peoples andplaces, were more interested in either declamatory statements, such as we find inthe texts ofthe inscriptions, or the rhetorical rendering ofevents, embellished like works of literature and entertainment. This was the tradition which was followed in the redaction of the Khwaddy-ndmag, amixture of legendary and authentic history ofthe Iranian nation, compiled inlate Sasanian times; it is well reflected also in Firdausi's Shdh-ndma which is ultimately based onthe Sasanian compilation. Great as theShdh-ndmais as an epic, it leaves many questions ofsubstance and detail unanswered that perhaps more prosaic historians with the training and method ofa Herodotus, Pliny, or Procopius would have clarified.
Iranian historiography, as seen through Arabic and Persian renderings, is often selective, impressionistic, and anecdotal, making useof conventional themes, floating motives, typical scenes, recurrent descriptions and fixed epithets.1 Historical works were often meant to move more than to inform. They belong to a tradition with itsown particular norms and purposes2 andtherefore arenotideal tools to serve analytical history asunderstood in the West.
Another qualitative problem arises from thearistocratic nature of Iranian historiography. In Parthian and Sasanian times the written word was largely the domain of the scribal class and the priests. We know little about the recording ofhistory inParthian times and no historical works are attributed to that epoch. In the Sasanian period the scribes and priests shared the same ideology and were united in support of a regime which found its fullest expression in the authority ofthe King of Kings. Any recording of secular events was generally, it seems either sponsored or controlled bythe courts of kings and nobles. We know of official records of royal deeds and pronouncements kept at the Sasanian court.3 Needless to say, such records tended to enhance the image of the king and to support official policies. Registeringthe royal enthronement speeches, successes in war, the founding of citiesor fire temples, and reports of the kings' official deeds appear to have constituted the bulk ofsuch records. These were accessible tothe highranking scribes atcourt who could make use of them, but again only ina manner which would not be atvariance with the wishes and policiesof the reigning monarch.4 Many blanks in the native historical traditions

INTRODUCTION
would appear to be theresult of the suppression of unsavoury, displeasing or embarrassing records. That is probably why we do not hear much of any schisms in the long history ofMazdayasnian religion. Aboveall that is why the history of the Arsacids isreduced in the Sasanian tradition almost to nothing. The complete disappearance of Kartlr, the formidable architect ofSasanian state religion, from later records may be due to the animosity of Narseh, whose earlier attempts atsuccession Kartir had apparently failed to endorse.
In general, Sasanian historical tradition served the ideals and interests of nobles and priests. As the basis ofIranian polity, their ideals and interests sometimes even overrode the whims or private policies of individual kings. In numerous instances wesee that thekingsare restricted or manipulated by an alliance ofthe nobles orthe mobads or both. The conditions for succession presented by representatives of the two classes to Bahram V is acase in point.1
The state ofwritten records inIran being what it is, archaeological finds, coins, inscriptions, rock reliefs, ostraca, papyri, graffitti and architectural remains from the period assume special importance. But it is to classical writers that we are chiefly indebted for their enlightening reports on the events inIran. Valuable assuch reports are, however, one cannot expect them to be balanced or free of bias, since they derive from countries inimical towards and often atwar with Iran. Classical writers were naturally less well informed about the conditions and events in eastern Iran, but even about western Iran the information they furnish is selective anddeficient in understanding of Iranian culture and society.2 Still more partial are Syrian and Armenian writers whose coreligionists were often persecuted by the Iranians and whose bias is generally caused by the difference of faith. We depend chiefly on coins and archaeological evidence forthe little we know aboutthe history of eastern Iran and Transoxiana.
In order to arrive at afairly coherent history of the period, therefore, we often have toresort toreconstructions, and to make assumptions based on such meagre material as our sources provide. Inview of the conservatism ofIranian institutions, the method ofretrospection and projection often proves helpful in this endeavour. For instance, we feel entitled to deduce from the court etiquette in Islamic times procedures pertaining to the Sasanian era, or to derive information about the rules

INTRODUCTION
of succession among the Arsacids from political and legal information we have about the Sasanians.1 Further, we may project the Achaemenian social estates orthe temple-cult ofimages into Parthian times.
It is only byculling information from widely diverse sources, andby making judicious use of imagination and speculation that the challenge of writing a reasoned history ofthe period can bemet.
THE GREEK PRESENCE IN IRAN
In less than tenyears, Alexander and hisarmy overthrew an imperial system andcrushed aninternational bureaucratic machine whichhad been in operation forover 200 years. The burning down of the royal palaces atPersepolis symbolized the end of an era and the beginning of a newone. Wehave no record of how theIranians felt andwhat consternation they experienced when thetowering structure of the Achaemenian state crumbled, and the people who had been the masters of the world became overnight subjected toforeign rule. One can only guess at thebewilderment and profound distress that therout of the Persian army, thefall of the royal house, andtheemergence of the Greeks asmasters must have caused in theheartland of Iran. A faint echo of thepeople's dismay andthepriests' outrage is found in the Zoroastrian Pahlavi literature, which remembers the "accursed" {gijastag) Alexander as thedestroyer of fire-temples, theburner of the holy scriptures, andthe murderer of the magi; the early Sasanian propaganda portrayed him as the annihilator ofIran's unity and power, the originator of the "petty kings system" (kadag-xwadaytti), and the author ofmany woes for Iran.
The newmasters, although familiar to thePersians through long periods of Greco-Iranian association, war, trade, and travel, were ethnically different, did not speak an Iranian language, practised a different religion, and held a different concept ofgovernment from that of the Iranians. But unlike thebarbarian invaders from the northeast, the Greeks had a brilliant culture, with advanced techniques inmilitary operations, art,andarchitecture, notto mention a system of government, many aspects of which fair-minded Iranians could envy. Their impact was one offar-reaching dimensions; it is seen at work during the Hellenistic period inIran, which extends roughly from the foundation of the Seleucid dynasty almost to theendof the Parthian period

INTRODUCTION
and in some respects a little beyond. This impact, however, produced in Iran a result differing from that in Syria, Asia Minor, and Egypt. Hellenism in these countries had a full flowering andspread a new form ofculture; in Iran it remained only an influence - albeit a strong one. Inother words, Iran did not lose its basic identity and did not abandon its own cultural traits, embodied above all in itsreligion. It soon attempted to pull away from the West, aspiring towards a selfassertion which culminated in the proud Sasanian nationalism andthe exclusiveness ofthe Zoroastrian church.
Alexander founded (or renamed) a number of Alexandrias, andthe Seleucids and theGreco-Bactrian kings proceeded to establish other Greek cities, stretching from northwestern India and the shores of the Oxus to Asia Minor.1 Those cities in which Greek and Macedonian citizens lived were self-governing entities (po/eis) with their own councils and assemblies, military defence and finances, religious andathletic centres. Some Iranian cities and towns were granted a status which approximated that ofa polis, namely politeuma. Once the Achaemenian establishment vanished, the polis became themodel of urban living, attracting theIranian elite. It was from the polis that Greek culture emanated and the Greek language made itsimpact. In the course of a few decades the higher strata of Iranian society adopted much ofGreek customs and procedures. Thus, when the first Parthian king rose to power, his coins were struck after Seleucid models and imprinted with Greek legend, as were those of King Hyknapses of Elymais about 162 B.C. and King Hyspaosines ofCharacene about 125 B.C. In 141 B.C. Mithradates I used the epithet philhellene, "lover of the Greeks", in order to please and attract Greek inhabitants of the newly-conquered territories.2 This epithet continued onParthian coins tothe end of the dynasty. The coins that Mithradates struck in Ecbatana bear the galloping Dioscuri on the reverse. Mithradates' son, Phraates, inimitation of the Seleucid kings who had assumed divine status, styled himself on his coins Theopatoros, "of divine descent".3
As a result ofGreek supremacy, the Greek language was studied by Iranian bureaucrats andthose with political aspirations, andGreek literature was cultivated.4 It has often been repeated that when newsof

INTRODUCTION
the crushing victory of the Parthian army at the battle of Carrhae (53 B.C.) and the ignominious defeat and death ofthe Roman general, Crassus, was brought to Orodes, heand his court were being entertained by the Armenian king with aperformance of Euripides' Bacchae.1 Among the rare written documents from the Parthian period are three parchments relating to the sale of the same vineyard. Of these, two dated 88/87 a n d 22/21 B.C. are inGreek (the third in Parthian), which shows the currency of Greek and its validity in courts. Even in the 3rd century A.D., when Shapur I wanted torecord his victories over the Romans he used in his renowned inscription atthe Ka'ba-yi Zardusht, not only Middle Persian and Parthian, but also Greek ;2 such was the prestige of the language some 400 years after the Seleucids had been driven out ofIran.
The Greek script was not only used for Greek itself, but was adopted in eastern Iran by the Bactrians torender their Iranian language ;3 and later when theKushans conquered Bactria, they adopted both the Bactrian language and the Greek alphabet, as is seen intheir lapidary inscriptions and on their coins.
Indications of Greek influence can be seen in anumber of other fields as well. Drachma (Pers. dir(h)am)and denarius (Pers. dinar)were adopted as the basic denominations ofcurrency. Some designations of weight and measures were borrowed from the Greek, as is seen in Middle Persian ster, and in the division ofthe whole into six equal parts (Pers. dang). The words for silver (sim) and for a good many precious stones (diamond, emerald, pearl, ruby) inPersian are derived from the Greek and this suggests the value placed bythe people not only onGreek jewellery and its craftsmanship, but also on the polis asthe centreof high life and fashion.
The Greek presence was felt even in the religious sphere. Greek temples and statues could be seen inGreek cities from Punjab toAsia Minor, from Jaxartes tothe island of Kharg inthe Persian Gulf. We may recall that the cult of images and icons was promoted by Artaxerxes II (404-359 B.C.) who, according toBerossus, the Babylonian priestly scholar writing inearly 3rd century B.C., was the first tointroduce the image-cult of "Aphrodite Anaitis" in the chief cities ofthe empire.4

INTRODUCTION
Although such innovation may possibly have shocked the puritan Zoroastrian priests, who considered only theimageless cult of fire altars appropriate,1 nonetheless the king's example was followed. This development seems to have been facilitated by the familiarity of the Iranians inmajor centres like Sardis, Susa, and Babylon - all centresof non-Iranian cultures - with the cult of foreign deities, such as Nanai, Ishtar or Cybele, Shamash, and Nabu, whom they could identify with Anahita, Mithra, and Tiri (Tishtriya), respectively.2 One might surmise that Cyrus' veneration of the gods of his conquered lands and his seeking of their blessings was understood byhis own entourage as a diplomatic gesture inthe light ofsuch identifications. The identification offoreign gods with Iranian deities, therefore, did not represent an entirely new process, but under the impact of Hellenism it took ona new dimension, and now the Iranian elite could conceive Zeus as comparable to Ahura Mazda, Apollo or Hermes to Mithra, Hera, Aphrodite or Artemis to Anahita, Hades to Ahriman, and Herakles to Varathraghna (Varhran, Bahram). Thus, on the coins of the Arsacids and thekings of Elymais and Characene, as well as those struck in eastern regions, we frequently find thefigureof Nike, Herakles, Apollo, or Tyche, which to Iranians must have meant the deities Vanand,3 Varathraghna, Mithra and Xvar3nah. Had religious monuments been preserved from theSeleucid period in western and central Iran, we would probably have found examples similar to those of Antiochus I of Commagene, which are dedicated to thecult of Zeus-Oromasdes, Apollo-Mithra-Helios, Herakles-Artagnes (Varhran)-Ares, along with the cult of himself and that ofhis country.4
Perhaps nowhere is the impact of Hellenism more clearly seen than in the field ofart. Achaemenian art was the culmination ofthe art of the ancient Near East. It was deliberately eclectic, borrowing elements from the neighbouring nations, and yet through an imaginative combination and harmonious synthesis it succeeded in creating some of the finest examples of ancient Near Eastern art, both minor and monumental. Ultimately it was inspired bya vision of a unified and harmonious world ruled by the imperial power. Greek art and its underlying concepts were different. "Whereas at Susa and Persepolis",

INTRODUCTION
writes Daniel Schlumberger, "traditions sometimes going back two and a half millennia into the past result inthis ultimate effort towards perfection which freezes them into immutability - at that very time, on the banks of the Aegean sea, there developed an art interested in movement, always in quest of progress, never satisfied with the results achieved and engaged ina constant effort to outdo itself."1 This art, "modern art" tothe Iranians,2 was now tobe seen inGreek temples, theatres, gymnasia, and the complexes of administrative buildings in the polis, as well as inGreek artifacts. Itpresented a different vision, a delight in human forms, in movement and in postures born of balanced tension. Backed by the power and prestige of the conquerors, the new art became fashionable, and threw many ofthe premises and idealsof Achaemenian art into disuse.
Although little Hellenistic arthas survived in Iran itself, the few examples which have been preserved inIran (e.g. at Nisa) and those which have survived outside Iran (at Hatra, Dura, Assur, Palmyra,as well as inAfghanistan and northwestern India) show vast concessions to Greek art. What was made by the Greeks for their own use - the recently discovered and excavated buildings of the Greek city at Ai Khanum in Bactria, for example - is not as interesting for our purposes as the artproduced by or for the Iranians under Greek influence, particularly in the post-Seleucid periods. The complex of buildings found atNisa, the first capital of the Arsacids, isa case in point. Here, although the architecture appears to beessentially native with some Achaemenian elements,3 the terracotta ornaments of the buildings attest to the prevalence of Hellenized art.4 The same is true of the wall paintings and panel stuccos found at the Kuh-i Khwaja in Sistan (pi. 78),5 the great temple of Artemis-Anahita atKangavar (pi. 56), the Kushan monuments atSurkh Kotal north ofthe Hindu Kush, or the Buddhist art of Gandhara, inall of which the Greek and native elements have combined to varying degrees.
However, we would be wrong if we left off the story here, because its conclusion is quite different from what one may have been ledto expect: Hellenism, which had been superimposed onlatent national tendencies, was cast off in a movement initiated by the Parthians and carried out by the Sasanians.

INTRODUCTION
THE RE-ASSERTION OF IRANIAN TRADITIONS
I have lingered on Hellenism in Iran and theinstances of its influence precisely because its effects were largely transient in thelong run,and the spirit and outlook of Greek culture, which nourished Western civilization many centuries later, proved in the end alien to and incompatible with the Iranian way oflife.1 So complete was this reversion that one can easily lose sight ofthe fact that Iran went through a period of Greek andMacedonian ascendency, when the secular elite wentout of their way toadopt Greek customs and culture.
The reaction against Greek culture naturally didnotstart suddenly. We know next to nothing, as far as documentary evidence goes, about how the Iranians organized their life during the Seleucid period. Considering, however, the benign indifference of the Seleucids to either Hellenizing orconverting their Iranian subjects,2 and taking later events into account, weare entitled to assume asa working hypothesis that in the rural districts and townships an indigenous mode of life continued, unaffected bytheGreek presence.
A distinction must bemade between the image ofIran evoked bythe Achaemenian state with its several capitals atPersepolis, Susa, Babylon, and Ecbatana, itssumptuous palaces and its huge army, and that of Iran under Greek domination. Achaemenian Iran was a "super-power", led by the Persians, but maintained and fortified by the financial, military, andtechnical resources of many nations. Seleucid Iran was a more limited entity, shorn of the huge resources that the Achaemenian power and wealth bestowed on it. When the Seleucids moved their capital to Antioch in Syria andconcentrated on their western possessions, it was no doubt partly because of thelimited benefits accruing from theIranian satrapies.
Defeated butnotdespondent, many Iranians must have leda sullen existence under the Seleucids, resenting the loss of wealth and prestige for their people andawaiting a saviour to restore them to their once glorious days. To this period we must assign the expansion ofapocalyptic literature inIran, which looked for theappearance of the Soshyant to punish thewicked andeffect a renovation of the world. The chief surviving work of this genre, theZand i Vahman Yasht, goes back, as its name implies, to anAvestan original3 which predated Parthian rule. Literature ofprotest and apocalyptic prophecies of the same kind were

INTRODUCTION
produced in other parts of the Middle East under Greek domination, and the folk-histories oflocal and national heroes were elaborated and enhanced asa reaction to the alien rule.1 Thus, while the westernized elite fell in with the Greek way of life, a silent but hopeful majority followed its traditional bent. It was this majority, whose cause was championed by some Arsacids and more forcefully bythe Sasanians, which eventually triumphed.
The existence ofsimmering discontent among the Iranians and their resentment against alien domination may be seen in some flickers of evidence from Parthian times. Already in thecoinage of Arsaces I, which otherwise follows the Seleucid model, signs of an ethnic nationalism emerge. On the reverse of his coins, instead of the common Seleucid motif of Apollo seated onthe omphalos and holding a bow, we find an archer in steppe dress seated on a stool and holding a bow. Also on some of his coins part of the Greek legend is replaced by a word in Aramaic script.2 Again theheadgear consists of a satrapal bashlyk, familiar from the coins struck in Achaemenian times. In Persis, where the tradition of the Achaemenians was better remembered and the Macedonian supervision weak, the coins of the local rulers continue many Achaemenian features. These include the use ofAramaic script, a throned king on the reverse (Bagadat's coins), and the king standing before a tower-altar with three fires (Oborzos' coins).3 More revealing, however, isthe evidence ofthe ostraca dating from the ist century B.C. found at Nisa. They contain records of deliveries of wine and other commodities to a royal storehouse, possible as revenue to maintain "name fires" forthe blessing ofthe souls ofearly Arsacid kings.4 The names of persons (e.g. Ohrmazdlk, Artwahistak, Farnbag, Denmazdak) and places, aswell as the unmistakable use ofthe Zoroastrian calendar (Avestan month and day names) attest to the Zoroastrian faith of the people and their Parthian kings; they testify to theinsistence of the Parthians onretaining their traditional religious calendar and alphabet in the place of Seleucid calendar and Greek script. The occurrence of two Iranian terms on the Nisa ostraca, mgws "priest, magus"and 'twrspt "master ofthe fire", confirms this conclusion,5 as does the use of the Zoroastrian calendar on the Parthian document from Avroman.

INTRODUCTION
The Nisa documents lend support to the view that in the countryside and among the conservative landed gentry (the dehgdns), the Zoroastrian piety continued practically undisturbed by the new order. The priestly class, whose outrage at Alexander's conquest we have already mentioned, must have been together with the dehgan class the chief custodiansof Iranian traditions inthe face ofthe Hellenistic wave. A firm indication ofthe tenacity oftraditional habits isafforded by the continuation of the Aramaic script, noted already in the case of the Parthian and the Persid coins, but used also on the coins of Elymais and
Characene.1 The Achaemenians, who employed the cuneiform alphabet for their monumental (mostly lapidary) inscriptions, used the Aramaic script and Aramaic scribes in their chanceries for epistolary communication. The scribes, who took dictation in the language of their employers, transformed it into their own tongue and wrote it down inAramaic. When the letter reached itsdestination, a scribe would read it to his employer, mentally translating it into hisemployer's languageand pronouncing it as such, say in Persian, Median, or Egyptian. Thus Aramaic gained wide usage throughout the empire as an international script, until Alexander's invasion dismantled the Achaemenian bureaucracy. Under the Seleucids Aramaic continued to be used as before for local correspondence and bookkeeping, but because the provinces had been released from the unifying grip of the King of Kings, they eventu
ally developed their own variation of the Aramaic alphabet.2 In the course ofthis development, a number ofAramaic words were frozen into ideograms, and important provinces came to possess a writing system inwhich phonetic and ideographic representations were combined. Such a system developed in Persis, Media, Parthia, Sogdiana,
Chorasmia and possibly elsewhere.3 Only in Bactria, which was governed byGreek rulers, did Aramaic writing give way to Greek. Aramaic script, although an immense improvement upon cuneiform writing, is not entirely suited to the rendering of Iranian, which belongs to the Indo-European linguistic family, whereas the Greek alphabet offers a most advantageous alternative. Yet Iranian provinces adhered tenaciously to their traditional way of writing.
When Mithradates I conquered Babylon he needed the talent ofthe educated people in Greek cities and Greek-oriented communities of the

INTRODUCTION
western provinces toadminister a considerably expanded territory with a sophisticated urban population.1 Inapolitically motivated gesture he befriended the Greek elements and called himself "lover of the Greeks " on his coins. Once the Arsacid hold became secure, however, we notice signs of weakening in this dependence. The Greek legends become perfunctory and less and less legible, noticeably after Mithradates II {c. 123-91 B.C.); Aramaic inscriptions surface from time to time, and some new symbols (such asa star and a crescent moon) appear onthe coins. The Pahlavi books have kept atradition, according towhich the Parthian king Vologeses (possibly Vologeses IV) ordered the collection and preservation of all the Avestan texts and their commentary, the Zand, which had survived Alexander's onslaught.2 Thus beneath the facade of the philhellenism of the Arsacids we get glimpses of an attachment tonative religion and culture. This attachment was presumably particularly strong among the Hyrcanian branch of the Arsacids founded byGotarzes (d. A.D. 51).3 This monarch, who opposed and defeated Mithradates, anArsacid prince supported byRome, appears to have been achampion of Iranian sentiments. His attention to religious worship is mentioned byTacitus {Annals xn. 13); hepublicly reviled Mithradates as a Roman puppet. Gotarzes and several of his descendants figure in a short list that Tabari and some other Muslim historians provide of the Arsacid kings, while ignoring many famous Arsacids mentioned by the Roman historians. The same group (Godarz, Glv, Bizhan) are remembered inthe national epic as stalwart warrior-nobles who defend the integrity ofIranian lands under the legendary Kayanians. This remembrance, and the tales of valour woven around their persons, must surely have been connected with their staunch backing of Iranian causes and traditions against some westernized Arsacids of Media and Mesopotamia. The proverbial antagonism ofthe Razis and the Marvazis4 may well go back to the rivalry and divergence of points of view between themore traditional Godarzis of the East and the westernized Karin princes ofthe West.
To support the foregoing thesis, we have the further evidence ofthe heroic cycles which developed in Parthian times. True, no Parthian

INTRODUCTION
poetry or work of literature survives in its original form from the Arsacid era, but all the evidence shows that what came tobe known as the Iranian national epic, which had its origin in Kayanian heroic poetry, wasenriched, elaborated, andtransmitted in the Parthian period. With the advance ofthe Parthian armies against the Seleucids and the consolidation ofArsacid power, the proud epics of the East spread tothe other regions, and what had been local gradually became national. As the memory ofthe Median and Achaemenian kings faded into oblivion, these epics came to assume thecharacter of national history. Adapted to Sasanian conditions, they were eventually compiled in late Sasanian times andcommitted to writing. The compilation, known as the Khwaday-ndmag^ became the basis ofFirdausi's Shdh-ndma,
with its Zoroastrian elements greatly reduced.1 The legends of this "national history", which arethemostimportant literary heritages ofpre-Islamic Iran, provide uswith anundated but unmistakable record ofIranian sentiment, a true expression of the persevering Iranian spirit and ideology. We maynowconsider the problems of the political ideology, religious direction, and artistic tendencies ofthe period inthe lightof the above premises. Itwill be seen that inall those fields, too, a movement away from Greek influence and toward self-assertion is noticeable.
POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY
The Seleucids, who had won their vast empire byforce ofarms, naturally exploited it; they levied taxes and troops from provincesand allotted land to Greek cities for their maintenance. They counted heavily onthe support oftheir Greek subjects, forwhom they cared most. Their power depended essentially on the good will oftheir sub
jects, and thus "was not institutional but personal".2 With the accession of theArsacids the traditional type of monarchy was renewed -a monarchy which based its legitimacy initially on its blood tie with the
royal Achaemenian house.3 The Arsacid kings, like their Sasanian successors, proclaimed their authority not on the basis of their subjects' good will, but as bestowed by the supreme deity, whom in asense they represented on earth. Thus, their authority wasinstitutional, not

INTRODUCTION
personal. In practice of course both the Seleucids and the Parthians gained their kingdoms by the sword; the ideologies behind their power, however, were different. In Iran as elsewhere in the Middle East, power was conceived asbeing granted from above. God appointed both the prophets and thekings and in both cases thepeople's consent was ideologically irrelevant. Greece in its classical era produced no prophets and no great kings. Inwestern Asia, on the other hand, these were the chief instruments for regularizing social and political life. From various indications, by classical authors in particular, we learn of the great authority of the Parthian King of Kings, and the high esteem in which he was held by his people. Some of the Arsacid kings called themselves "ofdivine descent", a title also used byearly Sasanian kings
(m^dysnbgy.. .MNW ctry MNy?{dyn" Mazda-worshipping lord.. .of the race of gods"), which, if taken literally, is somehow out of place in Iran. Considering the silence ofthe Perso-Arab and classical historians on any claim by Iranian kings to divinity, and judging bythe textof Shapur Ps great inscription atKa'ba-yi Zardusht, one isled tobelieve that the title was rather aconventional one inherited from the Seleucids,
with noreal intent of demanding worship.1 Bagh"god, lord", as its later semantic development into "a man of rank" indicates, may already have lost its exclusively divine value by the end of Achaemenian times.
Even if such titles were no more than conventions, in terms of veneration and obedience the Arsacid and Sasanian kings were placed far above ordinary mortals. In the Iranian patriarchal society the immense authority of the heads of agnatic groups partook of and symbolized the exalted status of the ancestors. The king's authority not only in his own clan, but also among his people, to whom herepresented an important father figure, derived partly from an ingrained attitude which assigned sweeping powers tothe head of the family and
which found expression in Zoroastrian family law.2 Shapur I demonstrates this typical veneration of the patriarchs byinstituting, as he describes itin his great inscription, fires for the benefit of the souls of his father, Ardashir, and his grandfather, Papak, as well as for the souls of their kin and courtiers. We seem tohave another example ofthis filial piety in the temples at Nisa, which apparently were founded by Parthian
kings for the blessing of the souls of past kings.3

INTRODUCTION
It was theinviolate status of the royal person and thepervasive ideology ofhis boundless authority that helped keep the Arsacids, and later, theSasanians onthe throne for solong and through so much turbulence. The Shdh-ndma, although composed during the ascendency of the caliphs, true to its origin, gives a genuine expression to the
exalted conception ofkingship inpre-Islamic Iran.1
Religious nationalism
Although Ardashir and his son Shapur may not have had a compelling religious policy, the rise ofthe Sasanians topower was not without a religious aspect. The latent forces which brought down the Arsacids also paved the way for the growth of an organized Church andthe imposition of a strict religious uniformity. Itwas not the kings, though, who initiated this religious development, but rather the priests with the eventual support of Sasanian rulers.
As the Sasanians strove toward centralization, so also did the Church. In a sense the power of the King of Kings and that of the mobadan mobad are two expressions of the same tendency, two dimensionsof the same phenomenon. Ardashlr's connection with the temple of Anahita in Stakhr ought not to mislead us into believing that in Ardashir wehad a priest-king or that theSasanian state began as a theocracy. The temple connection appears to have been one of sponsorship or of the administration of finances, similar to theoffice ofa mutawalli in Islamic times, rather than an actual priesthood.
The real champion oforganizing the Church into a coherent system with political power and a firm grip over the spiritual and temporal life of the Zoroastrians was the priest Kartir. Presumably following inthe footsteps ofTansar, the chief priest under Ardashir, this extraordinary personality acquired enough power to have four fairly long, rock
carved inscriptions associated with royal monuments.2 Three of them (at
Naqsh-i Rustam, on rock and on Kacba, and atSar Mashhad), repeating
the same text, tell ofhis steady advance from the rank of herpat (Kacba, 1. 3) under Shapur I,tothe highest dignity under Bahram II, including the rank of "the lord (p'txs'y) of the temple of Anahit-Ardashir in Stakhr" (ibid., 1. 8), a title borne until then only by Sasanian kings. He also describes the measures hetook to ensure the purity of the Maz

INTRODUCTION
dayasnian religion and the observance ofits precepts. The second inscription describes a spiritual journey that Kartir makes tothe Beyond, emulating that of Arda Viraz and foreshadowing that of Dante; he encounters his alter ego{den) and ascertains the existenceof heaven and hell toreward righteousness and punish deceit.
As a result ofthe measures that Kartir took toenforce his doctrine, according tohim, the Mazdayasnian religion prospered; Ohrmazd and the ja^ads (gods) were properly served; water, fire, andcattle were satisfied; themagi thrived; fire-temples were established throughout the realm; Ahriman and demons were struck down and their teachings proscribed; the believers of other religions, namely, Jews, Buddhists {smny), Brahmans, Sabians {n'sl'y), Christians, Baptists {mktkj)x and Zandiks were persecuted; and many who had deviated from the straight path were returned tothe faith.
While Kartir's successive ecclesiastical titles indicate the growth of a Church organization, his confident and zealous assertion of orthodoxy demonstrates, even more than Ardashlr's insurgence, amanifestation of genuine Iranian attitudes andsentiments and theculmination of an anti-alien movement which had its beginnings already under the Seleucids.
What kind of religious reform did Kartir introduce and what were the heresies and doctrinal degenerations that he combated with such ardour ? Who were the heterodox who were chastised ? Asatisfactory answer to all these questions isnot available, given the amount ofinformation at hand, but it can be said that Kartir's was aniconoclastic movement, with an exclusive view ofreligious truth, which aimed at restoring the Mazdayasnian religion towhat heconsidered to be its original purity, with emphasis onthe promotion ofthe cults of fire and water and the care of the cattle. Hestrove to focus religious worship around firetemples served bydisciplined magi. Heconsidered alldeviation from the official Church views as hostile and demonic and was suspicious and intolerant ofother religions. The authoritarianism, centralism, and exclusiveness ofthe Sasanian church was a vigorous expression of the same tendencies that made the rise ofthe Sasanians topower possible.

INTRODUCTION
THE ARTS
This return to an Iranian mode of life and thought which wehave explored above in the domains ofpolitical and religious ideology can be seen as well inthe development ofart. We have noted already that examples ofParthian art are to be found mostly onthe fringes of the Iranian plateau, more particularly inIraq and Syria. By looking atthis art, for instance atDura-Europos, we see instantly that itis different in concept and treatment from Greek art. We find no attempt at rendering the human oranimal anatomy ina plastic fashion, but instead a linear configuration of the body with almost nointerest in fleshing it out.
Rostovtzeff in his extensive discussion of Parthian art1 advancedthe view that the reaction against the Greek fashion in art began first in Parthia andspread with the growing power of the Arsacids to the Syro-Mesopotamian regions (Dura, Assur, Hatra, Palmyra),the Anatolian provinces (Commagene, Cappadocia, Pontus), northwestern India and Afghanistan (Gandharan art) and the Greek cities of South Russia; this movement also exerted an influence on the art ofthe Han dynasty in China, and "led at length tothe creation ofa polychrome style which became theornamental style of Central and Western Europe
for many centuries (theGothic or Merovingian style)".2 Further, according to Rostovtzeff the Sarmatians of South Russia, being influenced byParthian art, affected to a certain extent the developmentof
Roman provincial art.3 Ghirshman, echoing the same opinion, writes that "under the Parthians, Iran breaks free from Hellenism and imposes its artistic conceptions ona large area of the eastern world, from the Euphrates to China, from Siberia to India, from the highlands of Mongolia to the Bosphorus ... Furthermore, the widespread diffusion of Iranian costume andIranian personal adornments (Surkh Kotal, Gandhara, Mathura) points tothe existence ofa koine* an artistic lingua
franca^ among the peoples of the East during the Parthian supremacy. "4 Rostovtzeff distinguishes several features which characterize Parthian art as seen on Parthian monuments in Iran and the Syro-Mesopotamian plains. Chief among these is "the frontality" of human and animal figures. Others are linearity of contour; painstaking depiction of details of dress, ornament, furniture and ethnic characteristics (oriental " Verismus"); spirituality, in that the faces and features of gods or holy personages are made toappear celestial and ethereal, even without the

INTRODUCTION
help of a halo or radiant crown; repetition of the same figures with rigid ritual poses and expressions in the depiction of ceremonial and conventional scenes; and finally in the scenes of hunt, combat or chase,
portrayal of figures on horses ata flying gallop.1 Some art historians would not go quite as far as Rostovtzeff in count
ing all the above features asinnovations attributable toParthian art.2 Even if one should notagree entirely with the scope of influence attributed toParthian art, it is evident that during the Parthian epoch there developed an art inIrano-Mesopotamian regions, which, whileit still displayed elements of Greek art, was based on native traditions and followed different principles from Greek art. The native artof these regions did not die with the appearance ofGreek art inWestern Asia, but continued to exist in the hands ofthe local craftsmen and artists, while borrowing some elements, motives, and stylistic features of Greek art. In Iran this was not the imperial art of the Achaemenians, an eclectic art which resulted from international cooperation and symbolized a supernational power, but a more genuine indigenous art, inherited from the past, oriental in concept and execution, and intelligible tothe local population.
When the Parthians reached the western provinces of their empire they found an art which had blended the features oflocal, Greek and Achaemenian art.Later, an art form which was more Iranianand Central Asian in concept and style, with fewer and diminishing Greek influences, developed and spread. This occurred after the Parthians were well established and particularly after their defeat of Crassus at the Battle of Carrhae and their advance towards Syria and Anatolia. The centre of diffusion for this art, which Rostovtzeff calls the renaissance ofIranian
art under the Parthians,3 must have been the Parthian capital in Mesopotamia. As the Greek cities became more and more orientalized and absorbed bytheir geographical environment they, too, gradually adopted the native art style and contributed toit.
With theSasanians themonumental character of their art is best exemplified in the rock reliefs of the early kings. These reliefs, celebrating asthey dothe triumphs of Sasanian monarchs over their enemies and the investiture of kingship in them byIranian gods, reflect the pride and majesty of a new and powerful dynasty.

INTRODUCTION
The relative abundance and exuberance of early Sasanian royal sculptures in theface of thepaucity of the same kind of art from the Parthian period may create the impression ofa "renaissance" of Persian art under the Sasanians. As Rostovtzeff pointed out long ago, this isonly a myth: "the backbone ofit [i.e. Sasanian art] was theParthian artand it was through Parthia that the Sasanians acquired and adopted someof
the leading features of Persian Achaemenian art."1 However, one cannot deny that there is such intensity of purpose and vigour of presentation in the early Sasanian artthat it creates the impression of anentirely new art. The first phase of this art,that of the 3rdcentury, still exhibits some of the Greek elements present in Parthian art,but such elements are progressively eliminated, sothat in the art ofthe 6th and 7th centuries
hardly anyis left.2
Like Parthian art, Sasanian art adheres to theprinciple of frontality (although not so exclusively) and continues with realistic details. In addition to reproducing graphic scenes objectively observed, Sasanian imperial art supports dynastic purposes and intentions. Scenes ofthe king overcoming his enemy in single combat symbolize his power, even though he may never have fought such a battle. The rendering of defeated enemies in smaller scale than the victorious monarch of course signifies their lower and abject status. The scenes ofroyal hunt, banquet, enthronement and the like, whether in rock reliefs, silver vessels, or painting, are all intended to glorify a king or a dignitary, thus conforming to the political ideology of the Sasanian state.
In the field of literary arts, it is noteworthy that although Greek literature was enjoyed by the westernized Parthian nobility and at
court,3 the Greek literary genres which did not have anIranian counterpart, notably drama, never took root in Iran; the Iranians continued with their ownbrand of epic, lyric, and didactic literature. No other fieldbetter demonstrates perhaps that Greek culture remained essentially alien to theIranian spirit.
SOCIAL ORGANIZATION
In the foregoing we have outlined the course of the reaction against Hellenism, which in time ledto theorganization of a national state and the foundation, under the Sasanians, of a national Church. Underlying

INTRODUCTION
both was theideological principle of indisputable authority divinely
granted. This principle was inaccord with and endorsed by a hierarchi
cal society, controlled by the two privileged classes, the priests and the
nobles. From the point ofview ofsocial stratification, the population ofthe country could first be divided between thefree-born and the slaves. Evidence for the existence of slaves in Iran andtheir place in the economy comes from both classical sources and Zoroastrian writings. Many slaves were originally captives of war. They were employed in agriculture, construction, crafts, as pages and domestic servants, and also as soldiers.1 The free, non-slave population could be divided again into two categories: those who enjoyed civic rights as full citizens, and those who, although free, were deprived ofcitizenship but protected under the law as subjects ofthe King ofKings. Included in the latter category were aliens (u%deh\freed slaves, and persons who had been expelled from the community for committing a crime oradopting a non-Zoroastrian faith.
The majority ofIranians, however, were citizens {ward i fahr, ddehig) capable ofexercising full civic rights. They could acquire real property and dispose of it, enter into contractual agreements, have recognized heirs andsuccessors, andtake part in religious worship andsocial affairs.
The family or dudag (lit. "smoke", signifying the family hearth) formed the basic unit ofIranian society; it was patriarchal, patrilineal, polygamous, extended, and as a rule endogamous. The members ofthe family were bound together not only bykinship, but through it they also shared a range ofrights and responsibilities. Most conspicuously, they were linked together bycommon religious worship at the family hearth, the cult ofcommon ancestors, common property, and partnership in economic enterprise. Brothers living together in an extended family had only a theoretical share in thefamily's real property and means of production. Whereas the adult male members of the family could assume full legal authority within the family hierarchy, women and minors remained subordinate as wards.2
A larger community of kinsmen, the agnatic group (xve$dvanddny hamndfdri)^ consisted of a number of families, extended or individual,

INTRODUCTION
which could trace their lineage toa common ancestor within the living memory of the eldest heads of the families. The group was unitedby some common rights and obligations, amounting nearly to clannish solidarity.1 Major families were represented at the court, asa rule,by their incumbent heads. Since some public and court positions, aswell as allotment of lands as fief, had assumed a hereditary character,the position of the individuals in the high-ranking agnatic groups sometimes entailed hereditary office or dignity.
Socialestates
Although class distinction did not develop perhaps into quite as rigid a caste system asin India, nevertheless the barriers between the estates (pelags) were by no means easy tocross, particularly those between the commoners and the privileged classes. In The Letter of Tansarthe founder of the Sasanian dynasty is quoted as having proclaimed that "nothing needs such guarding as degree among men", and is said to have established " a visible andgeneral distinction between men of noble birth and common people with regard to horses andclothes, houses and gardens, women and servants... so no commoner may share the sources of enjoyment of life with the nobles, andallianceand marriage between the two groups is forbidden".2
The Iranians were divided from ancient times - at least from the Achaemenian period - essentially into three classes: priests, warriors or nobles, and husbandmen. In the younger Avesta the three classes are designated asdOravan- ("fire priest"), radaestar-"charioteer, warrior") and vdstryo.fsuyant-("herdsman"). InSasanian times, with the development ofeconomy, increasing specialization, and the burgeoning of the bureaucracy, thethree traditional estates could hardly correspond in their simple form to theactual situation. Asa result thecategory of dabirdn"scribes, bureaucrats", of which the rank and file were drawn presumably from the moydn ("priestly class") and the d^dddn (the nobility), was promoted to therank of a social estate. It apparently included also court physicians, astrologers, poet-musicians, and similar professionals. Bahram V soappreciated the talent of the musicians at court that he issaid tohave elevated them toa higher station, equal to that ofthe nobles.3 Beside the third estate, that ofthe "husbandmen",

was also added the category ofhutuxsdn "those who exert themselves well", which encompassed craftsmen and, apparently, traders.1 It may be surmised that the'ayyars, a type of "vigilante" who engaged in extra-legal activities and were noted at their best fortheir manliness, generosity and skill, and whose pre-Islamic roots cannot be seriously doubted, belonged tothis subdivision.
Public law and administration was the domain ofthe two privileged classes. Following the efforts of Kartir, Adurbad I Mahrspandan, and like-minded magi, the priesthood had managed toorganize itself into a state "church", which controlled education andthe judiciary,and increasingly influenced the affairs ofthe state. The judiciary was drawn from the rank of the mobads, with the mobadan mobad acting as the supreme judicial authority.2
There were different levels of nobility. At the bottom of the scale were the azadan "men of [noble] birth", consisting mostly of landed gentry (dehgans). Further, the term azadan was used to indicate the undifferentiated body of the nobility, as opposed to the " commoners". The vu^urgdn, "the grandees, magnates", consisted of the heads of noble clans, semi-independent rulers of small provinces and highranking state officials.3 Kartir boasts of having been made a member of this group byBahram II.4 Still higher were the vdspuhragdn, persons close tothe royal house and normally related tothe king. The highest rank of the nobility was that of the sahrddrdn, the rulers of major provinces and local dynasts; they included princes ofthe royal house. The early Sasanians made a practice of appointing their sons and brothers and some other princes of blood to the governorship of major provinces both for security reasons and so that the future kings might have the benefit of prior experience.
The great houses hadspecial privileges at court, andsome held heriditary functions (such as crowning the king, serving as his swordbearer, cup-bearer, etc.).5 Their fealty to the King of Kings required not only the payment ofyearly contributions to the treasury, but also the furnishing of troops and readiness to fight by the king's side in times of need. The representatives of these houses atcourt took partin

the king's council.1 The courts of the vassal kings followed the same pattern, with local nobles holding major offices atcourt, as is apparent for example from the listing byShapur I ofthe officials and noblesof the court ofPapak, and from the composition of the courts of Armenia and Abiabene. In Sasanian times, and probably also earlier, the name, position, and privileges of the noble houses were recorded in special registers called gdh-ndmag.2
The best known houses during the Parthian and Sasanian times were those of the Surins and Karins.3 Others mentioned in the sources are the Varazes, the Andigans, the Mihrans, the Spandiyads, the Spahbads, and possibly the Ziks.4 To these was to be added, of course, the reigning house. The system had old roots in Iran and was already in operation in the Achaemenian era.5
Marriage, divorce, and succession
Of the utmost importance to any Iranian family, whatever its social estate, was to ensure its continuation through legitimate male successors. Marriage was therefore considered a religious duty, andthe elders arranged for the wedding oftheir sons almost as soon as they cameof age. There were various kinds of marriage. The most complete form was the pdtaxsdyih kind - the marriage with full rights forthe wife whereby herchildren would be legitimate and recognized heirs and successors to herhusband and would inherit hisname, his position within the agnatic group, hissocial and religious obligations andhis share ofreal property inthe family. Marriage arrangements were made between the head of the bridegroom's family and the guardian of the bride (normally her father). Upon completion of the ceremonies,the bride left herown family and passed under theguardianship of her husband. The kdben (marriage portion) and the dowry that the bride brought with her would always behers, but other property acquired by her during her marriage would belong to her husband, unless he formally renounced it, orif the marriage contract provided otherwise. A man could enter several pataxsayih marriages at the same time.6

INTRODUCTION
Homosexuality wasnot tolerated and sodomy wasconsidered a sin
worthy ofdeath.1
So important was it to theIranians to preserve the name of the family, the cult ofthe ancestors, andthehearth fire, that they went to extraordinary lengths toensure a male successor. The elaborate system of proxy or substitute marriages that they developed forthis purpose was unique initsextent and complexity.2 Endogamy within the agnatic group appears to have been the rule, and marriage with close relatives (xvedodah) < Av. xvaetvadaQa-) wasnot only sanctioned, butencouraged asapious act.3 However, this doesnot mean that exogamous marriages did not occur. Several such instances are recorded for the royal family in Parthian and Sasanian times;for example, the marriage ofthe Parthian Phraates IVwith Musa, an Italian slave girl sent as a gift by Augustus, and that of Khusrau I with a Turkish princess, who gave birth to Hormazd IV. Pataxsayih marriage outside one's social estate, however, wasseverely discouraged, the elitist Iranian society being intent on preserving the"purity" of its blue blood. TheLetter of Tansar cites Ardashir as declaring, " I forbid anymen of birth to seek a wife among common people", although welearn from thechiding comments of the same text on decadent nobility that therule was notstrictly observed: "Degenerate heirs appear, who adopt boorish ways andforsake noble manners and lose their dignity inthesight ofthe people. They busy themselves like tradesmen with theearning ofmoney, andneglect to garner fair fame, they marry among the vulgar andthose whoare not their peers,and from that birth andbegetting men oflow character appear; andthis is what is meant bycdecadence ofrank'.

INTRODUCTION
Pahlavi books, especially the Denkart. Fragmentary and indirect information also comes from the other sources normally used forthe history of the period, but still a great many questions remain unanswered. In the Seleucid period the provinces of the Achaemenian empire lost the focus oftheir unity, and local traditions continued without much connection with one another. This is evidenced by theloss of the common Aramaic script asthe lingua franca ofwritten communication and the development from it oflocal Middle Iranian scripts. Insuch a situation it is almost inconceivable that the Mazdayasnian religion would remain static and pursue the same understanding ofthe faith in realms as far apart as Persis, Sogdiana, and Atropatene, particularly when we recall that the Seleucid and Parthian eras lasted for more than five and ahalf centuries. Local differences and divergent interpretations are to be expected in lands as different in background, contact and tradition, as Chorasmia and Media, one exposed toinfluences from the Central Asian steppes, and the other affected by the legacy of Assyrian, Urartian, Mitannian, and Cimmerian cultures. It is therefore understandable if divergent factions and "schools" ofMazdayasnian faith should
have developed in the Hellenistic period.1
The priests ofPersis, with their belief in the exclusive legitimacyof their thought and practices, used theSasanian military and political power as ameans of imposing their own brand of Mazdaism on the rest of the country, and toroot out orsuppress all dissent as deviation and heresy. Centres such as Shiz and Rhaga in Media, Abarshahr in Parthia, and Balkh in Bactria may have been particular targets of the zealous efforts towards unification. The earliest champion ofthis crusade was, according tothe Pahlavi books, one Tansar (or Tosar) who is said to have been an adviser toArdashir and an advocate ofhis policies. The crusade was pursued with even greater zeal and dedication by Kartlr.
Whatever the relationship between Tansar and Kartlr,2 it is evident that establishing a unified canon and a centralized Church authority was one ofthe processes concomitant with the rise ofthe Sasanians.
The career of Kartlr and the measures he took against those magi who did not follow his concepts have already been noted. The question, however, ofwho these magi were and how their beliefs and practices differed, is noteasy to answer. In fact, thequestion of Zoroastrian

INTRODUCTION
heresies isone of the thorniest problems of the religious history of Iran. From the corpus of Middle Persian Zoroastrian works one gainsthe impression that there had never been any serious schisms or divergent views on the essentials. However, such a solid unity lasting for at least one and a half millennia in a country exposed to so many influences and cultures would be unusual, to say theleast, and, in fact, careful scrutiny ofour sources reveals traces of dissent within Zoroastrianism. Leaving aside cultic differences and regional attachments to different deities, it appears that theological controversies canbe traced toat least two major tendencies, Zurvanite and gnostic.
The details of Zurvanism and the extent ofits influence1 have been subjects of lively discussion and debate. There is no doubt, though, that at certain periods and among some Iranians there existed a belief in a remote supreme being, Zurvan (orZarvan), associated withthe notion of Time and Space, from whom lesser creative principles proceeded. The most convincing argument forthe existence of such a belief is that Mani, who adapted the names ofhis deities to local pantheons and concepts, calls his supreme god "Zurvan" in Middle Persian, Ohrmazd being the name of a deity (the Primordial Man) created byhim. Since Manl's supreme god is rendered in Parthian by literal translation as "Father of Greatness", one mayargue that Zurvanism was associated with the south and west of Iran; and since Mani dedicated his sole book in Middle Persian, the Shdpurgdny to Shapur I, it is deduced that at least the early Sasanians were Zurvanite Zoroastrians.2
Some accounts ofthe Zurvanite mythology are found inthe writings of Armenian authors, Islamic heresiographers, and inthe Syriac "Acts of the Persian Martyrs."3 Traces are left also in some Pahlavi books, more particularly the BundahUn and Zdtsparam^ Because of the fragmentary nature of the reports and the censorship excerised in Zoroastrian works, ourknowledge of Zurvanism is likewise fragmentary and mostly vague, but the evidence shows that a myth must have existed according to which Ohrmazd and Ahriman were brothers whose father, Zurvan, allotted a limited time fortheir struggle leading to the ultimate triumph ofOhrmazd. Nothing could change this preordained course. Hence the fatalistic tinge of Zurvanite ideas.

INTRODUCTION
The widespread belief during the Sasanian period in an aloof and impervious master of destiny associated with Time and Space is attested by the frequent use in early New Persian literature
of such pregnant words as dahry ru%(i)gdr, %amdna,gardish-i ayydm,
all conveying the notion of time, and dsmdn "heaven", and falak, gardun, sipihr% charkh, alldenoting (the wheel of)heaven and, therefore, conveying a spatial notion. In their later development, however, such concepts do notappear to have been entirely "religious", but rather belonged tofolk wisdom derived from earlier religious or philosophical systems of thought which hadbeen popularized andhadentered the common store of current ideas.
Gnosticism, which owed a great debt to Zurvanism and adopted some of its principles, gained considerable popularity during the late Hellenistic period. A syncretistic doctrine ofmultiple origins, it appears to have particular affinity with the dualistic doctrine ofIranian religion. It was influenced, too, by Babylonian and Greek thought. Manichaeism and Mazdakism were both gnostic religions, and although both expediently claimed to represent Zoroastrian religion in itspurity, their outlook was quite distinct from that ofZoroastrianism. With many gnostic sects preaching in Mesopotamia, close to the Parthian capital, and with Manichaeism and Mazdakism winning a considerable following inIran, it is highly improbable that some gnostic tendencies didnot develop within Zoroastrianism itself. The continuation of gnostic ideas among the mystics of the Islamic period and the popularity of the notion that the human soul, entrapped in the body, lives in exile in this world and yearns for release andreturn to its original abode, points to the persistence of a gnostic outlook which originated in pre-Sasanian times.1
Church and state
Of the Church organization in Parthian times weknow very little. Nor do we know much about the Church's relation to the state in that period. Indirect evidence, mostly from Jewish andChristian sources, indicates a tolerant attitude on thepart of the Arsacids towards nonIranian religions, possibly continuing theAchaemenian tradition.
Once the Zoroastrian Church wasorganized under the Sasanians, it developed political power andmade its weight felt in theaffairs of

INTRODUCTION
the empire. The execution of ManI at theinstigation of Kartir in 276 under Bahram II, is a revealing indication of how far the state had rallied to thesupport of the Church bythat time. The regular persecution of the ^andiksy that is, the"revisionists" (including Manichaeans), and the frequent harrassment of the Jews, Buddhists, and Christians attest to thecontinuing efforts of the Church to preserve itshold over the population. United asthe Church and the Sasanian state were in the broad essentials, tension nevertheless surfaced between the two from time to time, thebone of contention being power and its benefits. In the Middle Persian sources, and in Arabo-Persian reports derived from them, the mobads appear ubiquitous at court andalways listened to. Such steady influence andharmony, however, must be taken with a pinch of salt; we must remember that the mobads exerted considerable control over thewritten word, andthe Sasanian part of the Khwadayndmag had a decidedly religious and clerical orientation. Thus, the kings who supported the clergy, fought heresies, or built or enriched fire temples - Shapur II, Bahram V, and Khusrau I,forexample — received lengthy and laudatory treatment. Those whohad resisted the everincreasing power of the Church in theinterest of the court or people were placed in an unfavourable light. Such is the case with Narseh (293-302), whohad been spurned more than once, apparently with Kartlr's aid, in hisattempt to capture thethrone. Hediscontinued the persecutions of the Manichaeans and the Christians. Yazdgird I (399-420), a humane king of independent mind by all accounts,was dubbed "the Sinner", onaccount of his attempt to limit thepower of the Church andthe nobility and his tolerance of minority religions. The most glaring instance of tension between the royal power and the Church occurred under Kavad (488-96, 498-531), when he supported the populist Mazdakite movement against both the nobles and the Church, thereby paving theway for his downfall and exile.
Despite the latent rivalry andtension between theChurch and the state, thetwo had essentially thesame world-view and basic interests. The state usually supported theChurch andoften shared its suspicion of heresies. At the Church's instigation it frequently engaged in the persecution of minority religions (Jews, Christians, Buddhists) and suppression of heretics or zandiks, above all theManicheans and the Mazdakites. The Church, in its turn, supported the structure of the state, the privileges ofthe nobility, the divine right ofthe King of Kings

and belief in total obedience to him. Both classes were united in complete identification with a Zoroastrian Iran and strong nationalistic sentiments. Through a Church-dominated education, the ideals of a Church-oriented monarchy were impressed onthe minds ofthe young.
Religious life and ritual
The passage from childhood to adult life followed a solemn confirmation ceremony at about the ageof 14,during which each adolescent child was invested with thesacred girdle {kustig) andshirt (Pers. sadra, sudra) bythe officiating priest. The girdle and the shirt, which werethe badges ofa veh-den (follower ofthe Good Religion), were to beworn at all times except when bathing.
The adult members ofthe family were to say prayers five times a day, once during each ofthe five watches into which the day and night were divided, corresponding to thelater Muslim practice. Like other Zoroastrian rituals, theprayers were suffused with a'dualism of good and evil, exemplified in praise of Ahura Mazda and hisdivine helpers,and execration of Ahriman and his demons. Apart from routine daily prayers, others were prescribed to dispel evil and secure the blessingof the gods on a variety of occasions: during ablutions, before partaking of meals, upon lighting candles andlamps, at feeding the hearth fire, and so on.At major purification rituals, seasonal festivals(gdhanbdrs), births, weddings, funeral services and commemorations of the souls of the departed (the fravash), the liturgy wasperformed by priests clad in immaculate white garments. It involved therecitation or chanting of often long sections of the Avesta in the original, no longer understood by the laity in Sasanian, or for that matter, in Parthian times.
The all-embracing Mazdayasnian religion determined the beliefs, decided the rights and obligations, and guided the conduct ofa devout individual. An acute awareness of the forces of Evil andthe need to protect oneself against their assaults permeated thelife of a veh-den; trust in thebounty and protective power of Ahura Mazda, theamasa. spsntas, andtheyazads (deities subordinated to Ahura Mazda), on the other hand, strengthened him. He believed in thesanctity of thesun, the moon, andthe sacred elements - fire andwater, in particular; he had confidence in theefficacy of sacrifice, ritual, andprayers; and he was dedicated to the long cherished cult ofthe ancestral spirits. He was

convinced ofthe coming ofthe Saviours, which would lead eventually to victory of the good creation and utter defeat ofthe demons. He considered allother faiths inerror and was persuaded of the wisdom ofthe ancients and the superiority of his religious heritage. Thevisible and symbolic aspects of such beliefs could beseen infrequent ritual prayers; in the dedicated care of the sacred hearth fire, which burned continuously with ritually clean wood; inthecareful avoidance of pollution of the sacred elements; in theexposure of the dead to birds of prey on high ground; inobsessive concern with ritual uncleanliness, particularly that which resulted from coming into contact with dead bodies; in the performance ofextensive purification rites prescribed by thecanonlaw and generally conducted by priests; in the seclusion ofwomen for the period oftheir menses for fear ofcontamination; intheeager killing of noxious insects, considered the creatures of Ahriman; in frequent religious festivals, often ofa merry kind, accompanied with song and music; in visits to fire temples and shrines; andfinallyincelebrations of elaborate funeral festivals and commemoration services for the souls of the dead.
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
As the only major political force east ofthe Tigris inwestern Asia for about 800 years, from the capture ofBabylon in 141 B.C. by Mithradates I to the fall ofthe Sasanians in A.D. 651, Iran acted asastabilizing power for a vast area stretching from Mesopotamia totheOxus, and from the Caucasus tothe Persian Gulf, and sometimes beyond. It also served as a civilizing force for some of theareas which came under its domination or within itssphere of influence.
In its constant attempts to protect itsdomains and ward off encroachments byitsneighbours, the Iranian state came into conflict onthe west and theeast with twopowerful forces ofentirely different natures. On the west Iran faced successively the Seleucid, Roman, and Byzantine empires, all well organized andsophisticated states of considerable, sometimes superior, military strength. Onthe east, Iranian territorial integrity was threatened byrecurrent nomadic invasions.

INTRODUCTION
Antiochus X, and Mithradates of Pontus, allbetween 69and 63 B.C., and his annexation of Syria asa Roman province brought the Roman legions tothe borders ofthe Parthian empire. Now the Parthians faced the challenge ofa great power possessing a mighty army and superior techniques. The Parthians, however, proved a potent, energetic, and untiring defender of their lands, effectively checking the Roman advance. The Romans received a first taste ofthe fierce fighting spirit of the Parthians and the skill and agility of their famous cavalier archers when Crassus invaded Parthia in the wake ofPompey's victories. The Roman army was annihilated by Surenas, theIranian general, in the battle ofCarrhae (5 3 B.C.), and Crassus having been captured and put to death, the Roman military standards, the eagles, and a large number of prisoners were left inParthian hands. With this remarkable victory the Parthians established their fame asworthy antagonists of the Romans in the east; they advanced their frontier further west tothe Euphrates, gaining the respect of the Jewish people in Babylonia and of various city states innorthern Mesopotamia and Syria. Mark Antony's frustration and considerable losses in Armenia less than a generation later were yet another grievous blow toRoman ambitions.
Unlike Rome, the Iranian state under the Parthians was not essentially an aggressive one, and once the Seleucids had been made to retreat to Syria, the Parthians did not seek to expand their territory.1 When Augustus sought to reach an understanding with the Parthians by diplomatic means, Parthia welcomed themove, and peace prevailed for three-quarters of a century. Roman aspirations to extend the boundaries of empire tocontrol Armenia caused hostilities to resume, however, under Nero.
The Romans did manage to inflict several severe defeats on the Parthians, particularly towards the end of the Parthian reign, andthe Parthian western capital, Ctesiphon, was captured and sacked by Trajan in 116, by Verus in 164, and by Septimus Severus in 197. Nevertheless, all such victories proved ephemeral and the Parthians ultimately stood their ground. Even atthe nadir of their fortunes, when they were about to be ousted by theSasanian insurgent, Ardashlr, theArsacids were able to halt Caracalla's inroad into Parthian territory, beat the Roman invaders, and force Caracalla's successor, Macrinus, to buy peace for the sumof two hundred million sesterces.2 The Parthians in fact

effectively blocked Roman eastward progress and frustrated any plans that theRomans may have had to step into Alexander's shoes or to capture the former Seleucid empire. This tenacity also demonstrates a remarkable cohesion and solidarity in Iranian society of the period; and this despite the somewhat lax control exercised by the Parthian King of Kings and the degree ofinternal autonomy enjoyed by local rulers and powerful noble families - a situation which often led to enervating internal disputes and internecine wars.
The downfall ofthe Parthians and the rise ofthe Sasanians, although a remarkable event of far-reaching consequences from the Iranian point of view, appears initially to have made little impression on the Romans, but they soon discovered that they had to contend with more ambitious, more aggressive, and more efficient leaders than the preceding Parthian kings.
One ofthe causes that contributed tothe overthrow ofthe Arsacids was no doubt therepeated, humiliating defeats which they suffered on the western front during the last century oftheir rule. The Sasanian attempt attaking advantage of the wounded feelings of the Iranians can be seen inthe new dynasty's bitter propaganda against the Arsacids; it portrayed the Parthian state as acollection of petty principalities robbed of unity and strength and as a creation of Alexander the Macedonian, who did not want to see Iran rise again. The Sasanians proposed to restore Iran to her erstwhile unity and greatness. Such ambitionsare clearly evident not only from the strenuous campaigns ofArdashir and Shapur I in the west, but more expressly in the quotation of such claims by Roman historians. DioCassius (LXXX. 4) is typical: "[Ardashir] boasted that hewould win back everything that the ancient Persians had once held, asfarasthe Grecian Sea, claiming that allthis was his rightful inheritance from his forefathers." (Cf. also Herodian vi.2.1-2, and Ammianus xvii.5.5-6.) It should be noted, however, that the Sasanians no longer remembered the Achaemenians, whodid not figure in the Zoroastrian tradition of Iranian epic cycles. They considered Dara, who was defeated by Alexander, as the last ofthe Kayanians, andthe Arsacids as successors to Alexander. They associated Iranian past glory with the Kayanians, not the Achaemenians.1
The early Sasanians were successful in consolidating their western frontiers and scoring some remarkable victories against the Romans. Conspicuous among these were the successful campaigns of Shapur I

in Mesopotamia, Syria and Anatolia, and his deportation of the inhabitants ofa number ofcities forresettlement inIran. He has described these triumphs in his inscription on the Ka'ba-yi Zardusht in Persis. Shapur Fscapture and imprisonment ofthe Roman emperor, Valerian, in 260 was a source of satisfaction and pride, which inspired the depiction of an abject Valerian in some of the monumental sculptures Shapur ordered to be hewn.1 But neither these triumphs nor some subsequent reverses substantially changed the situation in border regions, where periodic skirmishes, offensives, and counter-offensives continued. With the conversion of Constantine to Christianity and his proclaiming it the state religion ofthe empire in 334, a new element entered into the political relations between the two countries. Soon the Eastern Roman Empire, established by Constantine's division of the empire and his founding of a newcapital at Byzantium, eclipsed and then replaced the Roman state as far as Iran was concerned. This new empire attempted toprotect the Christians outside its borders. Christianity had a substantial following in Iran, largely in thevassal kingdoms and city states which served as a buffer zone between Iran and Byzantium. Some of the oldest Christian communities were in fact to be found in the region, and the first Council ofthe Church was believed to have been held in 198 inEdessa, the capital ofOsrhoene, in northern Mesopotamia. Some of these city states like Hatra, Edessa, Dura, Carrhae, and Amida had often been a bone of contention between Iran and Rome. As both Iran and Byzantium hardened in their adopted state religions - intransigent religions which admitted no other truth than their own - and as the frontier lines became more rigid by elimination ofa number of buffer zones like Hatra and Dura, the Christians of Iran and her tributaries came under increasing suspicion; nowtheir political loyalty was questioned when conflicts flared up between the two powers. Byzantium's concern with the religious freedom and welfare ofthe Christians inIran was seen by Iran as politically motivated, as was Byzantine persecution ofthe Zoroastrians. This mutual suspicion aggravated theconflict and ledto further persecutions, elimination of which frequently figured inpeace treaties between the two parties.
Armenia and Georgia adopted Christianity as the religion of state in the early 4th century, andthereby caused more discord between the Sasanians and theByzantines. The Armenians and Georgians borethe

brunt of repeated offensives and counter-offensives bythe two superpowers. Under Yazdgird II Iranian suspicion and religious zeal led in 451 tothe battle of Avarair, during which alarge number of Armenians who had resisted forced conversion, perished together with their leader, Vardan Mamikonian, after a valiant fight.1 And yet Christian Armenia sometimes preferred association with Zoroastrian Iran, both because of past traditions and the exacting demands ofByzantium for conformity.2 The relations between Iran and the Roman and Byzantine empires comprised far more than wars and conflicts, even though, as isthe case with news reports today, historians and chroniclers focus primarilyon conflicts. Friendly relations, if cautious and mostly formal, prevailed between them formuch ofthe time, and trade, travel and exchangeof envoys continued in periods of peace. Byzantium and Iran realized their exceptional positions as thetwo major powers in Western Asia and recognized each other's legitimate interests. Their mutual appreciation and the responsibility they felt for maintaining international law and order find expression in Khusrau IFs letter addressed to Emperor Maurice and quoted by Theophylactus Simocatta; in it he portrayed the two empires as the two great powers through which unruly and warlike nations were restrained and thelives of men were ordered.3 They cooperated on matters of mutual interest, such as the joint maintenance of fortifications at the Caucasian Gates (Derbent) to bar nomadic invasions. Cultural and intellectual exchanges were not lacking either (see below, p.lxiv).
Easternfront
Iran's relations with her eastern neighbours are far more difficult to trace or define, because here we lack such written records aswere madeby the Romans, Byzantines, Armenians and Syriac Christians inthe west. The nomadic people who were a continual threat tothe stability ofthe Iranian state, and events which took place on the eastern borders, were as a rule oflittle orno import tothe western writers and engaged their attention only when they affected events in the west. Even the riseof the Kushan empire practically escaped the notice ofRoman historians, who briefly mentioned it only many years later.4 We often hear, however, that theKing of Kings hadto abandon a siege or forego an

INTRODUCTION"
imminent success or agree to disadvantageous peace conditions because of disturbances on the eastern fronts. Thus, Mithradates I was drawn twice to the east in the middle of successful campaigns in the west in 148 and 141 B.C. to deal with nomadic invasions; Phraates II and Artabanus II both lost their lives in wars against the Sakas; Vologeses I abandoned Armenia inA.D. 59 in theface ofa Roman threat, in order to meet themore dangerous menace of the Kushans in theeast. Shapur II had to leave thewestern front to push back invading Huns in theeast. Peroz and Kavad had to contend with the Hephthalites, Khusrau I with the Kidarites and Hormazd IVwith Turkic invaders ontheeastern front. The bitter animosity between Iran andTuran, as depicted in the national epic, although rooted in the Iranian heroic age long before Zoroaster, owes much of its poignancy to the recurrence of such hostilities and the memory ofrepeated onslaughts ofthe eastern nomads in later periods. The anachronistic identification of the Turanians ofold in theShdh-ndma with theTurks, who first came into contact with Iran only in the 6th century, shows howlater events and sentiments have coloured the accounts ofearlier legends and enlivened them with feelings arising from fresh experiences.
The vast steppes of Central Asia have been traditionally a land of shifting nomads and a breeding ground for war-like and marauding tribes. The history of tribal movements in Central Asia, even the identity and ethnic components of the invading hordes, are not however always clear, but a general knowledge of major movements and their consequences maybe gleaned from archaeological evidence and Chinese, classical, and Arabo-Persian sources. In 176or 174B.C. the Hsiung-nu (probably the Huns) attacked the Yiieh-chih (the Tochari of the western sources) who inhabited the province of Kansu, northwest of China, setting in motion the nomad tribes of Central Asia. In about 160B.C. the Yiieh-chih in turn pushed the Saka tribes westward towards Bactria. In about 130 B.C. these invaders struck at the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, overthrowing it in about 120-100 B.C. It appears that these Saka tribes drove onin different directions. One branch descended on Kashghar and Khotan, and others, pushing south and east overran Herat, Drangiana, and Arachosia, reaching northwestern India, and in the process bringing by about 50 B.C. the petty states of theregion under their suzerainty. Parthiaand Hyrcania were also subjected to their onslaught and Phraates IIand Artabanus II perished fighting them. Artabanus' successor, Mithradates

II, was however a monarch of unusual energy and ability. Soon afterwards herecovered Parthia and Hyrcania, driving the Sakas to the east and south into Drangiana, which came to be called Sacastene (Sakastana, Slstan), and making it his own vassal kingdom. There are different interpretations ofthe movements, routes, and the identity and affiliation of the above tribes, particularly with regard to the Yiieh-chih. Atany event, according to Chinese sources, one of the divisions ofthe Yiieh-chih, the Kushans, later invaded Parthia and took possession of the Kabul valley. The date of this invasion is disputed,
but soon thereafter1 a mighty empire rose which controlled alarge tract of land from Oxus to Indus, absorbing the territories of the IndoScythian and Indo-Parthian kingdoms. This wasthe most powerful state formed by thenomadic peoples on theeastern borders of Iran, lasting for some 180 years, until it was subdued byArdashir I in 225. Shapur II (309-79) appears to have taken still more decisive action against theKushan domains, which were partly absorbed into Iranian provinces and partly taken over bythe Huns, a new wave ofinvaders. Of the relations of the Parthians andthe Sasanians with theKushans we know very little.
Shapur II had to take stern measures to secure theeastern frontiers against the Hunnic (Chionite) tribes. He seems tohave used these tribes in his campaigns inthe west, after he had pacified them, since Ammianus Marcellinus (XIX.I.IO) mentions the Chionite king, Grumbates, as Shapur's ally during his siege of Amida. Under Bahrain V (421-39), the threat to eastern frontiers became serious once again, this time presented by the Hephthalites, whose ethnic identity is again not
entirely clear, although their written language wasMiddle Iranian.2 They may possibly have been ofHunnic stock with a Saka ruling class and culture. They sustained severe defeat atthe hand ofthe nonchalantseeming and pleasure-loving Bahram Vand withdrew from the Iranian borders. Bahram's successor, Ardashir II (439-57) was less successful in dealing with nomadic invasions from the north and the menace posed by the Kidarites, connected apparently with the Hephthalites. The unfortunate Peroz (459-84) lost hislife and hisarmy in battle against the Hephthalites, whereupon they overran and plundered eastern Iranian provinces and exacted tribute from Iran fora number ofyears; the situation was finally redressed under the able king, Kavad.

INTRODUCTION
About this time anew ethnic element, the Turks, began togather and gain strength near theIranian borders, leading to theformation of a Turkic kingdom. The Turks brought pressure tobear onthe Hephthalites, making it easier for the energetic Khusrau I to subdue the Hephthalites with their assistance, and toform common borders and an alliance with the Turks. His son Hormazd IV (579-90) had however to contend with a renewed threat of invading Turks on the eastern frontiers. He dispatched his famous general, Bahram Chobin, who scored a resounding victory over them; major waves ofTurkic invasion of Iran were not, however, totake place until Islamic times. It must be borne in mind that the relationship between the settled lands and the steppe ineastern Iran was not always one ofhostility, raids, and counter-raids. Apart from theeconomic exchanges which bound the two together, the Parthians and Sasanians often made use ofthe eastern nomads byrecruiting them in their armies. Aswarlike peoples with a tradition of tribal chivalry, andhaving also an eye for material gain, the eastern nomads often responded readily to calls forassistance from Iranian princes engaged in internal struggles. The Parthian Artabanus III took shelter with tribes east ofthe Caspian before he was restored to kingship; the Sasanian Peroz sought and received help from the Hephthalites against his brother Hormazd before his relations with them soured. Kavad, too, regained his kingdom with theassistance of the Hephthalites; and finally Bahram Chobin chose tofleetothe very Turks he haddefeated, when his rebellion against Khusrau II failed. Such friendly relations sometimes were strengthened bybonds of marriage: Kavad married a daughter of the Hephthalite king (born to hissister who had been acaptive with the Hephthalites), and Khusrau I wedded a Turkish princess who gave birth tohis crown prince, Hormazd.
From this brief sketch it must be evident that despite many successful raids by the nomads andtheir periodic penetration into the eastern provinces, the Parthians and the Sasanians succeeded in erecting an effective barrier against their inroads; for more than seven centuries they afforded precious protection against disruption and chaos for the settled people ofthe Iranian plateau and its neighbouring lowlands. By virtue of their military control and political organization the two successive dynasties were the agents ofprosperity and the guardiansof civilization in the Middle East. On the other hand, one need notdoubt that the nomadic invasions brought some benefit, even though the historians dwelt almost entirely

on their destructive aspects. The invaders, bymingling with the settled people of Iran must have instilled fresh energy in them, and boosted their flagging stamina. Untempered by frequent challenge, Iranian culture would not have resisted forsolong the debilitation and decline which appear tobethe inevitable fate ofall cultures.
Relations with other regions
The range of Iranian international relations includes also China, Armenia and Georgia, andtheArabs. Beyond thenomadic lands, the shifting kingdoms, and kaleidoscopic tribal confederations of Central Asia, lay the highly civilized Chinese state. Like Iran, China was preoccupied with pacifying the nomadic tribes toits north and west and interestedin extending its control beyond itsimmediate borders. Chinese activities and advances in thewest have generally been in direct proportion to the unity achieved inChina and freedom from internal strife. Although the Chinese hadhadindirect material contacts with the
Iranian plateau from about the fourth millennium B.C.,1 the earliest direct contact dates from the 2ndcentury B.C., when the ableHan emperor Wu Ti(140-87 B.C.) sent anenvoy, Ch'ang Ch'ien, to explore the regions tothe farwest and toseek an alliance with those Yueh-chih who had reached Sogdiana and settled between theOxus andSamarkand. Diplomatic and trade relations were established soon after between Parthia and China, and the first caravan from the east issaidto have arrived in Parthia in 106 B.C, obviously after Mithradates II had pacified the Saka invaders. Friendly relations were also established with Sogdiana after two military expeditions by Wu Ti to Ta-yiian (apparently Farghana), in thesecond of which theChinese succeeded in breaking
the resistance of Ta-yiian.2
The Chinese remained active inand often controlled the Tarim basin through the 5 th century A.D. Under the Sui, and later theT'ang, the Chinese pressed westward again, and between 635and 648 they brought Yarkand, Kashghar, Khotan, Kucha, Turfan, and Karashahr under their dominion. In thelight of growing Chinese authority under the
T'ang andChinese control over much of Central Asia,3 we canwell believe that Peroz, son ofthe last Sasanian king, appealed to the Chinese

court for assistance against theconquering Arabs, as recorded in the Chinese sources. The fame ofthe Chinese "Khaghans" inearly Persian literature and frequent references to envoys to and from China and to exquisite Chinese art, in particular to painting, reflect relationsbetween the two countries which reached their climax in the 7th and8th centuries. It must be remembered, however, that "China" in this context isa rather vague term, referring often toChinese Turkistan and the adjoining lands under the Chinese control, rather than to China proper. Iran and the Caucasus were linked from ancient times. Inthe Achaemenian period, Armenia and Georgia came under the suzerainty of the Persian King of Kings, and theArmenian army fought loyally on the side ofDarius IIIwhen Alexander invaded Persia. InSeleucid times the Caucasus was divided into several tributary principalities, which like the rest of Western Asia came under the impact of Hellenism and participated in the expanded east-west trade. The administrative language, however, continued to be Iranian, which, following the model of the Achaemenians, was written ideographically in Aramaic. Mithradates II, inthe course ofhis campaigns against Rome, brought Armenia under hiscontrol. AstheParthians turned their attention to the west, and as the Romans expanded their power inthe east, Armenia and Georgia became victims of the political and military ambitions of the two superpowers. Many Roman generals, Lucullus, Pompey, Crassus, Mark Antony and Trajan among them, campaigned in Armenia, asdid anumber ofthe Parthian, and later, the Sasanian kings. Finally, in A.D. 66, an Arsacid prince, Tiridates, was crowned king of Armenia following anunderstanding with Rome. The event marked a new chapter in Armenian history and its relations with Parthia, for it established atradition ofdesignating one ofthe highest ranking Arsacid princes as theGreat King of Armenia. This tradition gave rise to an Arsacid dynasty in Armenia. Closely allied to the Arsacids ofIran and loyal to theParthian King of Kings, theArmenian Arsacids opposed the Sasanians when they rose against theParthians, andmaintained a rather hostile attitude towards thenew dynasty until their fall in428. In eastern Georgia, too, an Arsacid dynasty, related to the Armenian one, ruled forover a century until it was replaced inthe 4th centuryby the Chosroids ofthe Iranian noble family ofMihran.
The kinship of the Arsacids of Iran, Armenia, and Georgia was symbolic of the similarity ofcustoms, manners, dress, and the way oflife inthese

INTRODUCTION
countries. Strabo (xi.13.9), aware of these similarities, draws attention
to theMedian origin of their affinities. Iranian relations with the Arabs, culminating inthe Islamic conquest of Persia, have a long history, dating back at least to Achaemenian times; Darius I includes a satrapy called Arabaya inthe list ofhis realms. After Alexander the Arabs of northwestern Arabia passed under the sovereignty of the Seleucids. Then, when the Parthians captured Babylon, most ofMesopotamia came under their aegis and a number of Arab frontiers andprincipalities began to be established as part ofa defence line against the Romans, who were moving eastwards and were also using the Arabs asauxiliaries. An Arab principality was established in the 2nd century B.C. in Characene (Charax orMesene, in southeastern Iraq andKhuzistan) by Hyspaosines, who like some of his successors bears anIranian name. This vassal kingdom ofthe Parthians continued as a buffer zone between the Arabs ofthe desert and the settled lands to the north andeast until it was brought under direct Sasanian rule by Ardashir I. With Mesene annexed and Hatra, the prosperous, fortified border city, destroyed byShapur I, the new city ofHlra, west ofthe Euphrates in central Iraq, became the focus ofa vassal Arab dynasty, the Lakhmids. They served as the Sasanian instrument to contain theArab tribes on the fringes of Iranian borders, andalso to counter theGhassanids of Syria, a vassal dynasty of the Romans. During periods of political weakness in Iran, however, marauding Arab tribes, spurred on by the need for better pastures or in search of booty or glory, made inroads into Persia, as when Shapur II was still a minor, and again under Hormazd IV, when thecountry was beset by dangers from all sides. Khusrau II dismissed the Lakhmid ruler in 602 and a Persian mar^ubdn assumed de facto government of Hlra. Khusrau II'selimination of the Lakhmid dynasty has generally been regarded as a political blunder which contributed a fewyears later to thedefeat of a combined force of the Hirans and the Persians in the battle of Dhu Qar, famous in the annals of the Arabs as showing forthe first time a real weakness in the defence of the Iranian borders. A generation later this incident instilled confidence in the Arabs to attack Persia under the banner of Islam. But as long as the Sasanians still possessed some inner strength the Arab raiders were held in check, usually with the assistance of loyal Arab tribes, and often made topay fortheir raids.1

INTRODUCTION
Sasanian control in eastern Arabia extended to 'Uman (Mazun in Iranian,)1 which wasaffiliated with Iran from ancient times and inhabited by Iranian-speaking people. It figures among the Iranian provinces as Mazun in Shapur Fs Great Inscription at the Ka'ba-yi Zardusht2 and served in Sasanian times as an outpost, guarding the strait of Hormuz and the sea trade route from India. The Sasanians tried to extend their sphere of influence in Arabia further west, aiming even at Hijaz for both economic andpolitical reasons. According to Tabari (i., p. 985), in about 531Khusrau I appointed the Lakhmid al-Mundhir III over the regions of Bahrain, 'Uman andYamama, as far west as Ta'if and over therest of Hijaz. " I t seems, indeed, that as part of the struggle with Byzantium, Persia had well before the 6th century attempted to exert some influence even in Mecca andYathrib (the later Medina) via the recognized Hira-Mecca commercial and cultural highway."3 During the reign of Khusrau I, Persian influence extended also to South Arabia and the Yemen, following internal strife and religious dispute inthe old kingdom ofHimyar. Saif b. Dhi Yazan, who headed a nationalist movement against the occupying Ethiopians, made an appeal to Khusrau I, which led eventually to the conquest ofYemenby the Persian general, Vahriz, and the establishment of a vassal kingdom there. A Persian occupation force remained however in the Yemen, exerting a considerable measure of control; with the rise of Islam it apparently went over to thenew religion and aided Muhammad, who came to an agreement with thePersian governor. The descendants of the Persians were recognized for some time in early Islam asa distinct, seemingly aristocratic group, called abna* "sons".4
CULTURAL EXCHANGES
During thecourse of her history, Iran has shown herself to be always ready to learn from other nations with surprising flexibility. The evolution of Iranian culture owes a great deal to Mesopotamian, Levantine, Anatolian, Greek, Arab, and Central Asian peoples. Eclecticism, a major aspect of Iranian civilization, has not however hampered thedevelopment of a distinct culture. Within thecontext of

INTRODUCTION
Middle Eastern civilization Iran emerges with not only anunmistakable but also a notable cultural profile, marked byimaginative innovations and tasteful syntheses. She isdistinguished above all by her characteristic religious thinking, herart forms, andherliterature. Hercontribution and influence can be seen also in the fields of material culture, administration, warfare, etiquette and manners, and court procedures.
The oldest cultural influences on Iran in historical times came from Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Elam, and Syria; butby theParthian period these influences, whether concerned with material culture, time reckoning, or theart of writing, hadbecome so much a part of the Middle Eastern common inheritance that it was neither easy norjudicious to isolate and identify them as foreign. Inthe meantime, Mesopotamia and her sister societies had entered a period of decline and had come under the aegis ofyounger, ascending nations. The major cultural influence during the earlier part of the period under review wasGreek, which spread to all parts of Achaemenian lands by Alexander's conquest. It was further diffused during the Seleucid rule andcontinued to affect some aspects of Iranian life even after the Seleucids hadleft Iran. TheGreek presence in Iran and its impact on Iranian life have already been discussed. It must be remembered however that although the Greek influence was considerable in terms of scope andvariety, in terms of depth anddurability it was less so. TheGreeks of the Hellenistic period, despite their technical, artistic, andscientific superiority, brought no inspiring ideology,and the Zoroastrian religion, which embodied Iranian ideas and ideals, remained the paramount source of national inspiration. In the end Iran proved inhospitable to the Greek way oflife and thinking, and the Iranian spirit prevailed. " The dominant historical fact in Western Asia in ancient times", wrote Cumont, "was the opposition between the Greco-Roman and Persian civilizations."1 Out of the ashes ofthe Achaemenian and Seleucid empires theParthians and their successors, the Sasanians, forged oneof the major civilizations of Western Asia. It owed a good deal to prior and contemporaneous civilizations, but it also influenced the culture ofa number ofnations invarying degrees.
We may consider first some of the areas in which theIranians benefited from thecontributions of the nations other than ancient Middle Eastern and Greek.

INTRODUCTION
External Influences
Influences from India centre primarily on Buddhism. Under Asoka (264-230 B.C.) Buddhism, which made the greatest single Indian contribution tothe cultural and spiritual life ofthe eastern and northeastern Iranians, was planted as far north as the Oxus. Inthe next few centuries the Greeks, the Sakas, and the Parthians were the main actors in theentangled history of these regions; they were all affected by Buddhism, and in turn their influence was brought to bear on the development of northern Buddhist art and thought. Buddhism was reinforced andspread further in eastern Iranian lands through the patronage of the Kushans, whose empire reached the zenith of its
power under Kanishka (A.D. 128-51)-1 The ancient Iranian kingdom of Khotan, which had received Buddhism from India, developed into a centre of Mahayana Buddhist learning and contributed considerably to its propagation. In eastern Iran Buddhism flourished insuch centresas Begram, Kandahar, Bamiyan, Baghlan, Hadda and Balkh, as well as later inparts ofTransoxiana, introducing religious ideas and practices divergent from the Mazdayasnian religion. An artform - Gandharan art - inspired byBuddhism but borrowing iconographic and stylistic features from Iranian andGreek art, developed in Afghanistan and
northwestern India,2 adorning Buddhist temples and monasteries in the region. The influence ofBuddhist thought is seen insome aspects
of Manichaean religion,3 and it is likely that doctrines such as incarnation and transmigration of souls, held in Islamic times byneo-Mazdakite,
some extremist Shi'i sects, and mystics,4 represent an Indian influence dating back toPartho-Sasanian times.
Buddhism came under attack in Iran bythe zealous Sasanians, and
Buddhists were persecuted.5 TheBuddhists however survived in northwestern India and eastern Iran despite the pressures and persecutions they suffered at the hands ofthe conquering Hephthalites in the 5 th century. Their demise in Iran came with the advance of the Islamic armies in the 8thand 9thcenturies. Buddhist temples (vihdra,Pers. bahdr) and statues are remembered inPersian literature asepitomesof charm and beauty, and but "idol" (from Buddha) isanother word for a
beauty or the beloved.6

INTRODUCTION
Iranian interest in Indian thought and sciences in Sasanian times is evident from translations made into Middle Persian ofIndian workson mathematics, astronomy, and medicine, as well as works of imaginative and didactic literature such as the Pancatantra, a collection offables. In The Letter of Tansar the Indians arecharacterized as remarkable for their intellect,1 and the Shdh-ndmareflects cultural exchanges between Iran and India in the story of the mutual challenge presented by the Indian king andKhusrau I through the invention of chess by the Indians and backgammon (nard) bythe Iranians.2 A number of Indian works, including the Kalila wa Dimna (based onthe Pancatantrd)^ were translated in early Islamic times from Middle Persian into Arabic and contributed tothe development ofIslamic adabliterature.
Chinese contributions to Iranian civilization were effected mostly through trade. The main item oftrade from China was of course silk. The Silk Road left China at Tun-huang and, soon after reaching Kashghar, divided into a northerly route which reached Marv after passing through Farghana and Samarkand, and a southerly one which crossed thePamirs, passed through Bactria, and joined thenortherly route at Marv. The road then continued to the Parthian capital, Hecatompylos, and to Ecbatana, leading finally to Seleucia-Ctesiphon on the Tigris; Syria and the Roman East could be reached from there. Some trade was also carried on through Indian ports. Chinese silk appears to have been known in theAchaemenian empire by the5 th century B.C. Beside silk, imports from China included paper and cast iron.3 The secret of sericulture and thetechnique of silk production reached Iran in the 5 th century A.D.,andIranian silk material was exported to China itself about the 7th century.
The impact of Chinese art in Central Asia and Iran follows an ascending curve during theT'ang period, affecting painting and pottery in particular. It culminated in the Islamic period following the Mongol invasion, when Chinese models and motives influenced Persian design, and the Chinese manner of depicting clouds, mountains, trees,and facial features was emulated and absorbed.
From the Romans, who excelled in civil engineering and construction methods, the Iranians learned a good deal about the building of roads and military fortifications, city planning, and mosaic decorations. Not

INTRODUCTION
only were Roman architects sometimes brought to help with building projects in Iran, butmore often Roman captives andthe populations carried off from conquered cities inthe Roman East were put towork in the construction of cities, bridges, palaces, and thelike. Thus wasthe city of Veh-Antiok-Shapur (Gundeshapur) built under Shapur I. This tactic was also used to erect a dam fora water reservoir near Shushtar, still called Band-i Qaisar ("Caesar's dam"), andto build thepalace of Bishapur, under the same king. Romans were employed inthe construction of Eran-Khwarra-Shapur onthe site of Susa under Shapur II, and in the building of Veh-Antiok-Khusrau or Rumagan, a component city of Ctesiphon, under Khusrau I. Thesystem of limes erected by Shapur II against the marauding tribes in Hyrcania is possibly another example of Roman influence.1
A possible case of Roman influence in the field of religion concerns Bundos, who according to Malalas of Antioch was the founder ofa new religious doctrine later adopted by Kavad in the 5 th century, namely Mazdakism.2 Bundos is said to have dwelt for some time in Rome under Diocletian, where syncretistic religions had a vogue. Mazdakite teachings areremarkably close in some respects to thedoctrines of Carpocrates of Alexandria, who also lived under Diocletian, and whose teachings mayhave influenced Mazdakite doctrine.3 We must remember however that the syncretistic religions, such as that of Carpocrates, had themselves been affected to a certain extent by Iranian religious thought (see below).
Cultural exchanges between Iran andByzantium were not hindered by their frequent hostilities. There was mutual borrowing or adaptation of techniques inthe military field and incrafts, and exchanges of fashion in dress and ornaments took place, though to a limited degree. In the intellectual sphere, Byzantium, being the centre for the study of Hellenistic philosophy and having Greek as its vernacular, was a source of knowledge for Iran. Shapur I and Khusrau I are known to have encouraged translations from Greek in science and philosophy, which in this context could only refer to Hellenistic works, not to genuine Byzantine works, for these were thoroughly imbued with a Christian spirit. The similarity in many respects between the administrative patterns and fiscal practices of the twoempires has often led to the

belief that they were copied or adapted one from the other. In particular some historians have held that the reforms of Khusrau I were modelled on the economic and political reforms introduced byDiocletian, or that Khusrau's uniting of military and civilian powers in hischief administrators followed the pattern employed inByzantine provincial government. On the other hand, Diocletian is said tohave borrowed the court ceremonies and royal trappings of the Sasanians. As has been cogently argued inthis volume,1 none of these conclusions rests upon firm grounds, and such similarities and reciprocal influences cannot be reduced to asimple case of borrowing.
It may be noted that Iranian popular romances and folk epics, many of which are rooted in pre-Islamic Iran, reveal considerable appreciation of Roman and Byzantine courts, wealth and manners. In them frequently the emperors of Rum2 appear as worthy and powerful opponents, rumi princesses as love-inspiring beauties, and rumi spies as clever agents, to be outwitted only by their Iranian counterparts.
Iranian influences
The Partho-Sasanian was a distinct civilization backed successively by two mighty dynasties. It exerted considerable cultural influence on the societies with which it came into contact.
As "the highest expression of Persian genius",3 Zoroastrianism constitutes also themost significant Iranian influence. Since in the absence of concrete and compelling evidence itis difficult to trace with precision or certainty the exchange of religious and philosophical ideas, reciprocal influences in these fields between Iran andsome other nations have been the subject ofsome controversy. Of course itis not uncommon for similar circumstances to give rise independently to similar ideas; nevertheless the striking resemblance between some characteristic and persistent Iranian doctrines and those of the JudaeoChristian tradition has persuaded a number ofscholars that the latter owe much to the former.4 Some influences go back to the Achaemenian

INTRODUCTION
period, when the Babylonian Exile was terminated and the Jewish population came under theprotection of the Persian kings. With the advance of the Parthians towards Mesopotamia and Syria, and the establishment of Ctesiphon as their capital, Iranian influence found a new base of support and affected the largely Semitic population of Parthian western marches. The doctrines considered to have been inspired by or borrowed from Iran arediverse andrange from theological, such as the dualism between good and evil orbetween light and darkness, thebelief in angels andarchangels (corresponding to Zoroastrian ja^atas andamzsa.spantas) andin Satan as the epitome of evil and theadversary of God (corresponding to Ahriman), thenotion of paradise and hell, and the doctrine of future life and the continued existence of the soul; to ethical, such as reward andpunishment by divine justice; to eschatological, such as resurrection of the deadand the last judgement. Of particular interest in this respect are Iranian apocalyptic beliefs, prominent in Zoroastrian writings, namely, millennial periods and events, the doctrine ofthe Saviour (Soshyant), and the destruction ofthe wicked and the renovation ofthe world at the endof time.
The influences of Iranian religion appear to have been intensified during the Parthian period, when the relations with the Jews were friendly and Iranian political power in Mesopotamia dominant. To quote Mary Boyce on the subject:
Gradually many of Zoroaster's fundamental doctrines became disseminated throughout the region, from Egypt tothe Black Sea: namely that there is a supreme God who isthe Creator; that an evil power exists which is opposed to him, and not under his control; that he has emanated many lesser divinities to help combat this power; that he has created this world fora purpose, and that inits present state it will have anend; that this end will beheraldedby the coming ofa cosmic Saviour, who will help tobring it about; that meantime heaven and hell exist, with an individual judgment todecide the fate of each soul at death; that at the end oftime there will be a resurrection ofthe dead and a Last Judgement, with annihilation ofthe wicked; and that thereafter the kingdom ofGod will come upon earth, and the righteous will enter into it as into agarden (a Persian word for which is 'paradise'), and be happy there inthe presence ofGod for ever, immortal themselves inbody as well as soul. These doctrines allcame to beadopted byvarious Jewish schools in the post-Exilic period, for the Jews were one ofthe peoples, it seems, most open to Zoroastrian influences - a tiny minority, holding staunchly to their own beliefs, but evidently admiring their Persian benefactors, and finding congenial

elements in their faith. Worship of the one Supreme God, and belief in the coming ofa Messiah orSaviour, together with adherence toa way oflife which combined moral andspiritual aspirations with a strict code of behaviour (including purity laws) were all matters in which Judaism and Zoroastrianism were inharmony; and it was this harmony, it seems, reinforced by the respect of a subject people for agreat protective power, which allowed Zoroastrian doctrines to exert their influence. The extent of this influence is best attested, however, by Jewish writings of the Parthian period, when Christianity and the Gnostic faiths, as well as northern Buddhism, all likewise bore witness to the profound effect which Zoroaster's teachings had
had throughout the lands of the Achaemenian empire. " 1
The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls stimulated renewed discussion of the Iranian influence in post-Exilic rabbinical andapochryphal writings and theemergence of Christian doctrines.2 The similarity between the contents ofManual of Disciplineregarding the two spirits and Zoroastrian doctrines isstriking: The spirit of truth has its abode in the realm of light and has domination over the sons of righteousness; the spirit of error has originated from darkness, has dominion over the sons oferror, and tempts the sons ofrighteousness into transgression; but God has ordained a time for the destruction of error, when he will destroy it for ever and the truth will prevail. The affinity of such doctrines with those of the Zurvanites has not escaped the attention of scholars.3
Zurvanite doctrines are also invoked in discussions of the Iranian share in the development of gnostic religions, which had a considerable vogue in the Middle East during the Hellenistic period and after. The gnostic movement essentially espouses a rather pessimistic view of the world. In its more typical form it postulates a remote and aloof supreme deity who leaves the direction ofthe world tolesser creative principles of dubious benevolence. It envisages the redemption of the soul from the shackles of matter or worldly existence by a divine ordivinely inspired redeemer through illuminating knowledge
(gnosis).
It is true that such views differ in outlook from Gathic Zoroastrianism and the optimistic view ofthe world reflected in known Zoroastrian writings. Therefore a number of scholars have emphasized the nonIranian, particularly Greek, ancestry of gnostic ideas. Onthe other

INTRODUCTION
hand, some historians of religion have drawn attention to the close relationship ofgnostic doctrines with those ofthe Zurvanites, pointing particularly to the Parthian sphere of influence as the cradle of the
gnostic movement.1 Manichaeism, which was conceived ina Semitic environment within the Iranian empire, and Mazdakism, which was proclaimed and propagated in Iran, were both gnostic religions strongly affected by
Zoroastrian doctrines.2 They in turn became vehicles forthe spreadof Iranian concepts outside Iran; Manichaeism, inparticular, travelledfar and wide, from North Africa to China, and was attacked in Christian lands asa Persian heresy. Iran also provided the Roman empire with what Franz Cumont has
called its "most important cult of paganism"3 - that of Mithra. Although Mithraic mysteries as practised in the Roman empirehad little in common with what weknow about Mithra from theAvesta, there is no doubt that at thefoundation of Mithraism laytheIranian
Mithra worship.4 With the identification of the figures other than Mithra in Mithraic representations with Iranian deities or demons,
notably Arimanus (Ahriman),5 the Iranian origin ofRoman Mithraism becomes abundantly evident. The stages ofthe development ofRoman
Mithraism are however not entirely clear.6 Some of the Iranian aristocratic colonies inAsia Minor, notably inCommagene, Cappadocia, and Pontus, continued the practice of their Iranian religion even after Alexander's conquest, but in time adapted it to their hellenized environment. It is generally assumed that it was from these Anatolian monarchies that the cult ofMithra spread to the West, when in the ist century they were absorbed by Rome. E.Renan's statement concerning the importance of Mithraism among Roman pagan religions has often been quoted: "IfChristianity had been checked initsgrowth bysome
deadly disease, the world would have become Mithraic";7 and

INTRODUCTION
Cumont, theforemost historian of Mithraism, wrote, "Never.. .had Europe anarrower escape from becoming Asiatic than when Diocletian officially recognized Mithras as the protector of the reconstructed empire."* Mithraism provided an important vehicle for the penetration of Iranian thought and moral values in the Roman empire.2 "Of all the Oriental cults", wrote Cumont, "none was so severe as Mithraism, none attained anequal moral elevation, none could have so strong a hold on mind and heart. " 3
The connection of Mithraism with Christianity andthe effects of Mithra worship onthe development of Christian doctrines have been the subject of much debate,4 andmany Christian beliefs andrituals including the concept ofa God incarnate asdivine Saviour, have been held tohave derived from the Mithraic religion.5
A more direct and unambiguous Iranian religious influence can be seen in the spread of Iranian religion in the Caucasus and eastern Anatolia. Iranian colonies inAsia Minor and their agency of spreading Iranian doctrines further west have already been mentioned.6 Ancient Armenia, which was generally thought to have been strongly influenced by Mazdaism, is held bysome recent researchers to have been in fact Zoroastrian and tohave adhered tothat religion until the 4th century, when it became Christian.7 The prevalence of Mazdaism also inancient Georgia has been attested by archaeological and linguistic evidence. The community of religious belief and outlook between Iran and Armenia and Georgia is reflected in such common deities as Anahit (Anahita) patron goddess of Armenia, Aramazd (Ahura Mazda), Mithra (later Arm. form: Meher), Vahagan (Varathraghna) in Armenia; and Armazi (Ahura Mazda) inGeorgia. The cult of fire inArmenia and Georgia is amply attested by archeological and literary evidence. Zoroastrian demonology, too, is echoed in Armenian and Georgian names ofIranian origin for malevolent and monstrous creatures (Arm. dev^Av. daeva-"false god, demon"; druf^h,Av. drug- "personification of deceit and thelie, demon"; parik, Av. pairikd- "female demon";

The rigidity of the state Church andtheprevailing restrictionsand censorship in both Byzantium and Sasanian Persia discouraged the free exchange of ideas. In neither empire was apostasy or heresy easily tolerated, particularly when it had political overtones and aroused suspicion of support from the other side. And yet ideas are noteasy to contain, and reciprocal infiltration of religious thought from acrossthe border manifested itself in theadvances (if limited) of Christianity in Iran2 and Manichaean heresies in Byzantium.
Iranian religious influences during the Sasanian period have been detected also among the Arabs. The endeavour of the Sasanians to extend their control asfarasMecca and Medina, aswell asthe survival of the Persian abna* in the Yemen have already been noted. It is natural to assume that Iranian presence and control in much ofArabia exposed some ofthe Arabs tothe religious thinking and practices ofthe Iranians. Some historians of religion have pointed out the similarity between Iranian beliefs andsome Koranic concepts such as theangels, the day of individual and final judgement, the resurrection of the dead, the Bridge, and heaven and hell, and have indicated their borrowing through the Judeo-Christian tradition, with which the prophet of Islam was familiar. Others have seen a trace of Zurvanism inthe notion offatalism expressed inthejdhihyya poetry.3
One particular source of religious conceptual influence from Iran appears to have been the Mazdakite movement, which reached itspeak under Kavad in the early 6th century. According to certain Islamic sources some Arabs in Mecca adopted thedoctrine of Mazdak, and at the rise of Islam there was still a group in Mecca recognized as Mazdakites (Zanadiqa).4 It is also reported that the expedition sent by Khusrau I to aidSaif b. Dhl Yazan included a number of prisoners, to whose fate theking was indifferent. If this be true, theprisoners were probably the Mazdakites persecuted by Khusrau. Although such reports are subject to doubt, some credibility is lent to them bythe appearance among early extreme ShHs (the ghuldt) of non-Islamic, neo-Mazdakite ideas; these range from belief in aninner meaning ofthe scriptures and

INTRODUCTION
a continuity of revelation to the incarnation, occultation, and return of divine leaders.1 It is likely that the ranks of the ghulat were infiltrated by neo-Mazdakites in disguise, orat least by the Arabs and mawdli who had been affected by the Mazdakite doctrine. Be that as itmay, there is little doubt that Mazdakite religious thought, which found a breathing space after the fall of the Sasanians, did not disappear without leaving

traces insectarian Islam. The impact of Iranian religion obviously was not confined to the nations inthe west, but extended tothe east as well. IfBuddhism was an Indian gift, its subsequent development inmany areas, particularly in eastern Iran, bears thestamp of Greco-Iranian influence. It was largely due to the religious temperament and inclinations of the Iranian Buddhists that Buddhism, originally rather abstract and without images, developed in its northern form a rich iconography with representations of Buddha, Bodhisattvas, gods, demons, etc.2 Among the Iranian influences onBuddhism may becounted the concept of Buddha Mitreya, the most famous of the Bodhisattvas, who has messianic features reminiscent of the Zoroastrian Soshyant.3 The Iranian influence on Buddhism is intimately linked withthe effect of Iran on the Gandharan art and on the later stages of Buddhist art. Itis to be noticed first in the Iranian elements and decorative forms in the Gandharan Buddhist iconography, emanating chiefly from Bamiyan in Afghanistan and passing through Central Asia to China, providing amodel iconography for Mahayana Buddhism. "From about the middle of the 4th century, Iranian pictorial methods supplanted Gandharan models as a source of the new images required by the Mahayanist expansion ofthe Buddhist pantheon. "4 Further effects of artistic communication with Iran may be seen inthe wall paintings at the caves of Tun-huang, where "one may speak of a Sino-Iranian school of painting subsisting from the early 5 th until nearly the end of the 6th century".5 Iranian influences are visible also in Bodhisattva images with head ribbons and broad crossing scarfs, often seen in cave temples of Yun-kang from the 5 th century.6 The Iranian impact on Buddhist iconography of China continues to theend of Sasanian times and

through the T'ang period, and is further seen in some Japanese wall paintings and panels, such as the three panels ofthe T'ang period pre
served in the Shosoin.1 Among the Iranian nations, the Sogdians took the lead not onlyin trade with Central Asia and the Far East, but also astransmitters of ideas and the agents of cultural exchange. As Manichaeans they converted the Uigur Turks, among others, to Manichaeism and introduced the religion of Man! all the way through the Tarim Basin toChina. As Christians, their missionaries were active in propagating Nestorian Christianity. They also introduced Zoroastrianism into China.The Chinese court recognized Zoroastrianism in the early 6th century, anda number ofZoroastrian temples were built in western China in the early T'ang period. The Chinese were anxious to propitiate the Central Asian peoples attheir borders, and Zoroastrianism, as one ofthe religions of Central Asian people, was spared persecution, until 845, when it fell victim to xenophobic sentiments in China, and its recognition was withdrawn.
Manichaeism was introduced into China inthe late 7th century and enjoyed official recognition as long as the Uigur Turks, who had been converted to it, were respectably strong. With thedecline of Uigur power in the 9th century, Manichaeism lost official support in China and went underground, to disappear almost entirely by the 14th century. The Manichaeans are thought tohave introduced China to a number of mathematical and astronomical ideas from the Iranian sphere. As for Iranian contributions in other fields, Iranian artistic influences on the art of the Fertile Crescent and on the northern Buddhist art have already been noted. Iranian influences on Rome in material culture, although comparatively somewhat limited, were far from negligible. The Romans came to admire the Parthian method of warfare in the plains and borrowed both the technique of their cavalier archers and
the actual weapons and armour for men and horses.2 They also learned from the Iranians in the fields of agriculture and irrigation; various fruits and plants, including rhubarb, assafoetida, pistachio, peach and apricot (the latter two of Chinese origin), were adopted directly or
indirectly from Iran.3 Iranian influences were often promoted through trade. The Parthians and Sasanians were particularly careful to safe

INTRODUCTION
guard the security of the trade routes, and their military power was put to excellent use to secure the economic benefits resulting from the safety of caravan trade. Iranian artifacts and agricultural products travelled far and wide, as far as Rome in the west and China in the east. Chinese imports from Iran orthrough Iran included woollen material and rugs, precious stones and aromatics. Persian brocades are said to have competed with the native products among the fashionable Chinese at the court.1
The Central Asian satrapies ofSogdiana, Bactria, and Chorasmia,as well as some other eastern satrapies of the Achaemenian empire, passed from tribal into urban societies much later than the Medes and the Persians.2 Intime they evolved into civilizing agents for the waveof fresh tribes - the Sakas, the Hephthalites, and the Turks - who moved westward. The Sogdians in particular, as already mentioned, played an important role in transmitting elements ofIranian culture to various peoples of Central Asia through trade and religious missionaries. Their trading posts and merchant colonies stretched all the way from their native land along the trade routes through Central Asia into China. As businessmen they earned the reputation of being keen and skilful, and they were largely responsible for the fame of Persian wealth and luxury.
A major indicator of Iranian cultural influences is the linguistic borrowings from Iranian. Nowhere is this more evident than in the rich layers of Iranian vocabulary inArmenian and, toa lesser extent, Georgian. These layers, which date largely from the Parthian period, are of considerable assistance fora better understanding of Iranian linguistics and cultural history.
Iranian words borrowed into Aramaic and Syriac likewise mirror the cultural influences exerted onthe speakers ofthose languages by the Iranians during their many centuries of contact.3 Numerous Iranian loanwords in the language of the Mandaeans match the extent of the Iranian influence in the gnostic religion of this baptist sect in southern Iraq and Khuzistan.4 The Arabs, too, borrowed a number of words directly or via Syriac from Middle Persian. They mostly reflect aspects of Iranian life which had impressed the Arabs, although the date of their borrowing cannot be always determined because of the scarcity of written Arabic documents prior toIslam.5 Many Arab poets of fame

frequented the court ofthe Lahkmids seeking patronage; and references to aspects of the Persian imperial court and aristocratic refinements such as royal armour, dress and crown, royal jewels, fine material, and musical instruments are not rare intheir poetry.
In the east the extensive trade and missionary activities of the Sogdians was reflected inthe wide use oftheir language inCentral Asia. Sogdian remained thelingua franca of Central Asia for many centuries, particularly with the Uigur Turks, whose older inscriptions arein Sogdian. TheUigur script, which served as a model for Mongolian, was adapted from the Sogdian alphabet, and words and titles abound in Uigur which reveal Sogdian religious and cultural influence. The word kent " t o w n " (asin Tashkent), from Sogd. kniSh, widely used among the Turks, conveys theIranian origin of urbanism in western Central Asia. Some words for weights and measures, borrowed from the Sogdians by the Turks (e.g. Uig. batman " a unit of weight" and stir "(stamped) coin") betray the Sogdian influence in regulating trade and introducing a money economy among the Turks.1 In more easterly regions strong Chinese influences mingled with the Iranian.
CONCLUSION
The millennium which began with the collapse of the Achaemenian empire and ended with the advent ofIslam is one ofthe most significant in the history of the Iranian-speaking peoples. It is a period during which the Iranians, whohad been defeated by a military conquest, gradually rose toassert their ethnic and cultural identity. They succeeded not only in preserving thetraditions inherited from the Medes andthe Persians, but also in spreading andpropagating their distinct culture among many neighbouring societies. For some eight centuries Iran continued to be oneof the four major civilizing forces active in Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages: Greco-Roman (including Byzantine), Iranian, Indian, and Chinese.
Initially it appeared as if the conquest of Alexander andthe Greek penetration heralded a decisive change of cultural direction; but in retrospect the Greek impact can be seen to have been ultimately transient. True, the Iranian ruling elite were hellenized fora while, and a symbiosis of Greek and Iranian cultures produced hybrid offsprings, noticeably in the fields of religion andart;but Iran retained enough

vitality and vigour in the long run to absorb some of the alien cultural elements and to shed others, surfacing once again with a genuine spirit of its own.
The Parthians and then theSasanians became thetorch-bearersand the representatives of a culture which displayed itself in a distinct religion, a recognizable art, and a characteristic form ofsocial organization andgovernment. Thedualistic aspect of its religion emphasized the reality of evil; its monotheistic tendency, on the other hand,was well in accord with the evolution of its social organization and the supreme authority ofthe King ofKings, who needed decisive authority in order to hold together a society of multiracial, multilingual peoples inhabiting a vast area disjoined by high mountain chains and harsh deserts. Set at the crossroad between the Mediterranean world, China,and India, Iran was an effective intermediary for the communication of goods and ideas. Not only did herculture strongly affect Central Asia, Caucasia, and Mesopotamia, buther impact was felt in countries as far away asChina and Rome. When Iran fell to the Arabs, still her cultural heritage proved of immense value for the enrichment of Islamic civilization.

PART I
POLITICAL HISTORY



The political history of Iran from the death of Alexander in 323 B.C. to the fall of the Sasanian empire in A.D. 651 is covered in six chapters. A chapter apiece is devoted to each of the three major dynasties - the Seleucids, the Arsacids and the Sasanians - which occupied a central position and ruled over Iran and Mesopotamia consecutively for the entire extent of the period under review. The other chapters deal with kingdoms and peripheral states which existed parallel to one or other central dynasty. The fortunes of the Iranian elements in Asia Minor - Pontus, Commagene and Cappadocia in particular - are discussed in Chapter 3. The chapter on the Seleucids does not concern itself with a narrative of events in the Seleucid empire, which does not belong to Iranian history proper. Details of relations and conflicts between the Seleucids and the eastern states will be found in Chapters 2, 5, 8(#), 11 and 12. Complete agreement on the existence of some Parthian kings or their sequence is lacking; therefore discrepancies occasionally occur between different chapters in the numbering of some of the monarchs, especially those named Artabanus and Vologeses. These are pointed out by cross references. Special attention has been paid to the kingdoms which developed to the east and north of central Iran, both to counter a relative neglect of their history in standard works on Iranian history and to present the latest research in a field which has particularly benefited from recent archaeological and epigraphic discoveries. Thus Chapter 5 encompasses an account of several kingdoms or empires, including the Greco-Bactrian, IndoScythian, Kushan and Hephthalite, which developed in eastern Iran and beyond, while Chapter 6 treats of the realms of Transoxiana - more particularly Sogdiana and Chorasmia in the north-east and north. A discussion of the minor houses of Persis, Elymais and Characene, which ruled under the Seleucid and then for a time under the Arsacid suzerainty, has, however, been assigned to the numismatic section, since evidence for their history comes almost entirely from coins. Chapter 7 deals with the Iranian settlements to the east of the Pamirs, particularly in the kingdom of Khotan. The Iranian presence in Armenia, Georgia and Albania, as well as in some border provinces and city-states on the western marches is treated in the third section of this volume, which deals with the interrelations of Iran and her neighbours. Chapters 5, 6, 7 and 30 on Eastern Iran, Transoxiana, Settlements East of the Pamirs and Development of the Arts in Transoxiana respectively, complement each other in many ways, and the reader would benefit by consulting them together.

CHAPTER I
THE SELEUCID PERIOD
INTRODUCTION
Our knowledge of Seleucid Iran is unfortunately meagre. The scanty sources mostly record occurrences such as military campaigns, royal accessions and the like, and hardly give any information on economic or social matters. Even the isolated facts we speak of are almost all Greek; in Seleucid Iran, as we know it, theIranians arenot seen or heard. The reasons forthese deficiencies are historical.
Memory is selective; succeeding generations remember what is relevant to their own life and forget the rest: "Let the dead bury their dead."1 After the Romans had ended Seleucid rule in Syria in 63 B.C., nobody cared any longer for the defunct dynasty. Sycophants and historians alike nowturned to the Caesars. Theonly extant Greek outline of Seleucid history is appended to the narrative of the Roman conquest of Syria in Appian's "History of Rome", compiled in the 2nd century A.D.
As for the Iranians, they lost the memory of their remote past. Whereas after the Arab conquest the Zoroastrian priests and native gentry endeavoured to keep alive the Persian tradition and to preserve religious writings andthe glory of the Sasanians,2 the pre-Sasanian past receded into the realm of fable, andAlexander himself became "the king of Rum", that is, of Byzantium. When Blruni collected (c. A.D. 1000) "The Vestiges of Past Generations" (al-Jlthdr al-hdqiya), he learned of Cyrus only from Jewish (Christian) sources, where the founder of the Persian monarchy was remembered as a friend of the Chosen People.3
Contemporary records ofthe Seleucid period inIran had been written on perishable materials (papyrus, leather, wood) and thus did not survive. Only a few Greek inscriptions on stone, mostly from Susa, have been recovered asyet, and the excavation of Seleucid sites, except in Susa, has hardly begun. Thus, the present account can only mark the limits of our ignorance.

THE SELEUCID PERIOD
POLITICAL HISTORY
After Alexander's death in 323B.C., his generals divided the empire and for more than thirty years fought one another for a larger portion of Alexander's heritage. One of these warlords was Seleucus, who on Alexander's order had married Apame, daughter of the Sogdian satrap Spitamenes, in 324 B.C. TheSeleucid dynasty sprang from this Macedonian-Iranian union. In 312, Seleucus succeeded in establishing his dominion in Babylon. Very shortly, he extended it to Media, Susiana, "and the neighbouring countries".1 His enemy Antigonus ruled over Asia Minor, but was unable to dislodge Seleucus who in 306 or 305 took the royal title for himself. By 303,Seleucus had reconstituted Alexander's empire from the Euphrates to the Indian Ocean, except for thelands along theIndus which he hadto cede to Sandracottas (Chandragupta), the founder of the Maurya dynasty in Northern India. Seleucus' capital was established at Seleucia on the Tigris (in the vicinity of Babylon), founded by him about 305.2 In 301, Seleucus andhis ally Lysimachus of Thracia defeated Antigonus and Seleucus obtained North Syria as hisprize.
At this juncture, Seleucus made a decision which changed the course of Iranian history. The Persian kings from Susa andEcbatana (Hamadan) reigned over the realm which bordered both the Indian Ocean and theMediterranean. In Seleucia, Seleucus was still on thefringe of Iran. But in 300 B.C. he transferred his headquarters to the newly founded Antioch on the lower Orontes, in North Syria. His new capital was eccentric to the land mass over which he ruled - " from India to the Syrian coast".3 Now, over 1,700 miles (asthe crow flies) separated him from hisposts on theJaxartes (Syr Darya). Buthe, and his dynasty, hadno choice.
They knew that they, as Alexander before them, did not win by force of numbers, " b u t by skill and intelligence".4 They would be unable to govern andexploit their immense domain without a steady intake of men andideas from Greece. Thetract on which Seleucus I built his Syrian capital had been neglected by Phoenician mariners since it offered no safe anchorage. Seleucus' Greek engineers created two artificial harbours (Seleucia and Laodicea) to serve the new

POLITICAL HISTORY
capital.1 The life line of the Seleucid power was tied to the short coastal strip between the Gulf ofAlexandretta and Beirut. The choice of Antioch as capital necessarily weakened the royal authority infar-distant Iran, just as the command ofthe Achaemenians was wanting instrength on the Mediterranean coast. Yet it was not the Iranians, but the Macedonian generals inIran who took advantageof their absent master for contriving separatist movements. Thefirst defection occurred on the sensitive north-eastern frontier, between the Caspian Sea and the Hindu Kush. Here, in the Seleucid province of Bactria, in northern Khurasan and the lands north of the Jaxartes (Syr Darya), Macedonian troops and Iranian chieftains were united by the necessity to hang together or behanged separately. The invasion of the hungry nomads who roamed over " a vast plain stretching out interminably"2 in Central Asia would have destroyed the Greek colonies and dispossessed the khans and their tribes. From the Saljuqs (c. A.D. iooo) tothe Qajars (1794-1925), almost all the shahs ofPersia, with perhaps the exception of the Safavids, were intruders from Turkestan ortheir descendants.
About 280 B.C.,the nomads from the north succeeded inpenetrating the Seleucid territory as far as Tirmidh and Herat. They were expelled by Antiochus I, son and successor to Seleucus I, who also restored the ravaged cities. For instance, herebuilt the citadel of Marv and raised a rampart ofbeaten earth and brick (up to 20 metres high and about 270 km. long) which surrounded the Marv oasis.3
But the wars in the west, particularly with Egypt (280-72 and 260-53), fought over the defence orthe expansion ofthe sea-front of the empire, strained the resources of the west and made the court of Antioch demand more and more help from the provinces of the east. In 273, for instance, the satrap ofBactria had to send 20 elephantsfor the war against Egypt and thus weakened the defence of his satrapy against the nomadic hordes. Following the death of Antiochus II in 246, a dynastic war broke out in the west between Laodice, the divorced wife of Antiochus II, and Berenice, hiswidow, who was supported by her brother, Ptolemy III of Egypt. The army inBactria, led by its

THE SELEUCID PERIOD
general Diodotus, forsook the House of Seleucus, which was now divided against itself; they thought that they could dowithout further help from the court at Antioch.1 This reasoning proved right. The Greek kings of Bactria, whose riches amazed contemporary observers, defended their territory against thenomads for about 130 years, and "subdued more peoples than Alexander", particularly inIndia.2 When Andragoras, the Seleucid satrap ofParthia (roughly western Khurasan), also revolted, andhisprovince was overrun by thenomadic tribe of Parni led by Arsaces, the Greek kings of Bactria and the Seleucid court, in unspoken or agreed collaboration, succeeded in blocking the expansion of the Arsacids. For some eighty years theArsacids of Parthia remained local dynasts whowere continually embroiled in wars with their neighbours.3
The court of Antioch repeatedly tried to regain thelost Far East. Again and again new conflicts or dynastic struggles in thewest compelled the Seleucid kings to break off successful oriental campaigns and goback to Syria. Antiochus IIIalone succeeded in re-establishing his authority, albeit nominally, over Bactria andthe Far East (209-5). He won the title ofthe "Great King",4 and the eastern booty allowed him to defeat Egypt and to acquire Palestine and Phoenicia in 200B.C. But soon he became involved in a war with Rome, lost it in 189, and had to surrender western Asia Minor. All that he hadrecovered in the east was soon lost again. Yet, western Iran, from Ecbatana to the Persian Gulf, remained loyal, though in 223, andagain in 162, the Macedonian generals in Media grasped at the royal diadem.New dynastic struggles in Syria, however, delivered Media, some time after 148 B . C ,andBabylonia, in 141 B . C ,to theParthians.5 Nevertheless, Greek cities, aswell asthe Iranians inMedia and Persia, sided with the Seleucids. Demetrius II setoutto Media in answer to anappeal from Greek colonists inhope that if he were successful inthe east hewould be able to drive outhisrival, Tryphon, from Syria. Hefound much support, but was captured by the Parthians in 139.6 His brother Antiochus VII succeeded in recovering Babylonia and Media, but fell

POLITICAL ORGANIZATION
in a skirmish in 129 B.C. Thus Seleucid rule over Iran was ended once
and for all.
Iran was lost totheSeleucids notattheSyr Darya, butin Antioch, by the Court which always took theloyalty of"Oriental Barbary" for granted and wasted theresources of the empire in futile wars and dynastic squabbles.1 Nevertheless, theSeleucid dominion over Iran lasted for 183 years (312-129 B.C.). How could aline of alien condottieri at Antioch, separated bydistance, race, language, religion and mode of life, last solong in the land of the Achaemenians and the Sasanians? To answer this question, we must consider thepolitical organization and theinternal structure of Seleucid Iran.
POLITICAL ORGANIZATION
The Achaemenians proclaimed that they were Persians, and received the realm from the supreme god Ahuramazda. Later the Sasanian clergy taught that thekingdom and the(true) religion were twins.2 The Seleucids were of Macedonian stock, but they neither ruled over Macedonia nor had any authority over Macedonians abroad,3 and they commanded peoples not "by the grace ofGod", but by the right of the spear. They were neither native rulers, nor the instruments ofa "colonial" power, but just lucky condottieri. Their power was not institutional but personal. In the battle against Molon, a rebellious general, thelatter's troops went over toAntiochus IIIas soon as they saw their legitimate sovereign, but the other wing ofMolon, not seeing the king in person, fought stubbornly against the king's regiments. In fact, the Seleucid Ship of State was not anchored in the heavens, but moored tothemutual "good will' {eunoia) between theruler and the ruled.4 Antiochus I recovered thedominion of Seleucus I, his father, "by his valour as well as by thegood will ofhis * friends' and his troops". Inturn, theruler had to "win over" his subjects by his own eunoia. It wasnot a constitutional arrangement, but a political necessity. The diademed condottiere was isolated; hecould not even rely on histribe (asfor instance, the Saljuqs did), since he hadnone. His "friends", that is,hiscourt, from which hehad to choosehis

generals and ministers, were an international lot, mostly men as uprooted as their master and who were attached to him personally by his bounties and their fellow-feeling. An Acarnian, a former "friend" of the king of Macedonia, passed to "themore opulent court of Antiochus [III]", and became his adviser.1
The king's army, his administration, his colonies and the Greek cities in Iran were no less international; Macedonians, Thessalians, other Greeks and various non-native elements were partners in exploiting the Orient and were as isolated inthe immense alien country as theking himself. They all hadto sink or to swim together. This was thereal meaning of the mutual "good will" of which we have just spoken.
The administrative organization ofthe realm was simple inprinciple, but complex in practice. Alexander andthe Seleucids preserved the Persian division of the empire into enormous satrapies. The Iranian satrapies were placed under a viceroy, "one [who is] over theupper satrapies", whoresided in Ecbatana. Thesatrap wasabove all the general commanding the troops in his province. The satrapy was divided into districts, called "places" (topoi). But such a district could be a Greek city, a military ward (phj/ake), ora group ofnative villages.2
A network of Greek military settlements and cities covered Iran from the Syr Darya tothe Persian Gulf, and kept the realm together.3 A colony was generally established onthe royal land, and onaneasily defendable site. For instance, atAi Khanum, on the Amu Darya (Oxus), the colony was protected ontwo sides byrivers, and onthe third side by a hill which became itscitadel.4 Colonists received land lots which were encumbered with the obligation ofmilitary service. A Greek city {polis) wasformally autonomous, though in fact controlled by the royal overseer {epistates); it had its own territory which made it more or less self-sufficient economically. Thus, the classical traditions of the Greek polis continued in the Orient: the landowners lived in the city

POLITICAL ORGANIZATION
and not in the open country, though, of course, they could have luxurious manor houses, furnished with baths, outside the city walls.1 The walls made thecity impregnable, except for a regular army, and the city militia could be relied upon tokeep incheck the unruly natives on herterritory.2 Thus, Media was ringed with Greek settlements as defence against theneighbouring peoples.3 It is noteworthy, though inexplicable, that none ofthe Greek cities inIran received the privilege of (copper) coinage which was conceded bythe kings to several cities in Syria, and also to Nisibis and Edessa in Upper Mesopotamia. The internal organization ofthe Greek city inIran remains obscure. We hear of traditional magistrates {archonts) and such, butwedo not know whether, for instance, there was a native quarter, or whether artisans of the same craft worked onthe same street, as, it seems, was the case in some Greek cities under Parthian rule.4 But how was town life in Iranian Iran?5 Were Iranian towns essentially administrative centres with a citadel forthe governor and his guard ? Can we distinguish between a " t o w n " and a walled "village"?6 What was the function of the latter ? How widespread was thetype of a bighouse inhabited by a large patriarchal family? The Sasanian legal texts still speak of the large agnatic groups with a common ancestral worship

and a certain legal and economic unity.x What happened to the tribal system under the Seleucids? To mention another problem: from Crassus' defeat at Carrhae until Julian the Apostate, at least, Persian arrows checked theadvance of Roman legions. The bowmen were clients of great landlords who, on occasion, became more or less independent rulers.2 What was the situation and the power of these Iranian lords under Seleucid rule ? Did they live intheir castles ordid they go to the towns? We can only hope that new discoveries may illuminate these forgotten pages of the Iranian past.
In the last resort, the power ofthe Seleucids rested on force, that is on the army; the king first and last was avictorious captain. Of fourteen Seleucids who reigned between 312 and 129 B.C. only two died in bed. Two infant kings were murdered. Ten kings died oncampaign. The backbone of the army was thephalanx of heavy infantry recruited among the Macedonian colonists andsupported by heavy cavalry. The Seleucids could throw as many as 72,000 men into battle. Only a small part of them came from Iran: c. 12,000 out of68,000 atRaphiain 217 B.C.The Iranians served aslight infantry, and mostly came from the "wild" tribes, such as theCissii who held travellers to ransom on the way from Susa to Ecbatana.
Why did the Seleucids neglect men from Persia proper (Fars), reputed to bethe best soldiers inIran,3 and the splendid Iranian horse which was the mainstay ofthe Greek kings ofBactria ? An explanation may perhaps be found in the following. Alexander began to drill an army of Iranians - and modern scholars praise him for this expression of universal brotherhood; and because he was king of Macedonia, he would have been able to keep his soldiers incheck. But the Seleucids hadno nation behind them; anIranian army, necessarily recruited and commanded by native chieftains, would have delivered thefate of the dynasty to the caprice and interest of native potentates. History confirmed the judgement ofthe Seleucids. The army ofthe Arsacids, their Parthian successors in Iran, essentially consisted of a retinue of great lords who naturally became royal governors and masters oftheir respective fiefs. To mobilize his host, the Parthian king had to appealto his satraps.

POLITICAL ORGANIZATION
The financial organization ofSeleucid Iran remains almost unknown. We know the titles of some taxofficials, butdo notknow anything about the actual taxation. Seleucid coins show, however, that the monetary system was uniform throughout the Empire. Only the royal coin was legal tender; foreign silver circulated as bullion. The essential unit was the silver piece of four drachms, that is about 17 grams weight. There were several mints inIran, and each ofthem had a considerable autonomy inthe choice oftypes and legends ofcoins. As the Seleucid standard was identical with the Attic standard which was followed in the greater part of the Hellenistic world, the trade from the Indian Ocean tothe Adriatic Sea was based on the same monetary system. Ontheother hand, thePtolemies of Egypt used a different standard (a four drachm piece of c. 14.4 grams), and this meant the economic division ofthe Hellenistic world into two monetary blocks. The unified silver coinage (which had been lacking in the Achaemenid Empire), was a boon to traders. The Seleucids generally encouraged agriculture and commerce, twoabundant sources of revenue. For instance, they, as theAchaemenians before them, granted hereditary
possession ofempty land tothe farmer who planted trees on it.1 They improved roads andharbours; a crossing on theAmu Darya near Tirmidh continued tobeused forcenturies after the end ofthe Greek
domination in Iran.2 By canalizing the river Eulaios (Karun), they established a fluvial route between Susa andthePersian Gulf.The victory ofAntiochus IIIin the Far East (pp. 6, 187-8) re-opened the bazaars of India to Seleucid merchants, and heundertook a military expedition against the Gerrhaens of the Arabian coast in order to divert
the spice trade to Seleucia onthe Tigris and to Susa.3
Coin hoards give some indication of the pattern of commerce.4 It seems that Iran formed a comparatively closed and somewhat

backward economic region. Silver struck in Iran circulated freely within Iran. This istrue even ofthe coins ofthe Greek kings ofBactria. But the Iranian pieces, particularly after Antiochus III,arerarely found in the west, while coins struck in Antioch, andfrom c. 180 B.C. onwards in Seleucia on theTigris, dominated themarket in Susa. It seems that merchandise travelled in stages. Spices of Arabia and India came to Susa, and, on the other hand, western merchandise was carried to Susa or Ecbatana by traders from Antioch or Seleucia on the Tigris. It is noteworthy that silver of Tyre which is abundant in Upper Mesopotamia (Dura-Europos) does not appear in Susa, as if the merchants of Syria divided the Iranian markets between themselves. It is also noteworthy that Seleucid coins apparently did not circulate in Central Asia. On theother hand, theimportance of Indian trade is illustrated by the fact that until c. 280B.C. the mint of Bactria issued coins onthe "Indian" standard, that is tetradrachm of c. 12 gr.
THE GREEK IRAN AND THE IRANIAN IRAN
Greek settlers in Iran wanted to remain Greeks. Alexander's colonists demanded "A Greek education anda Greek wayof life" in Iranand after Alexander's death some of them began to return home, since they
felt deprived of Greek civilization.1 Thus, a school, a sports centre (gymnasiori) and a theatre were built on the Oxus and Greek athletic
games were held onBahrain island in thePersian Gulf.2 The Delphic maxims were inscribed on thewalls of the funerary monuments of the Thessalian founder ofa Greek settlement onthe present Afghan-Soviet
frontier.3 Yet, theGreek settlements and cities were only islands in the Iranian sea,where the Greek language washardly known and Greek mores were alien and probably distasteful. In fact, two worlds, the Greek andIranian, co-existed in Seleucid Iran.
Of course, the Greeks exploited the land; in a small Greek city on the Oxus there were buildings of a size unheard of in Greece, except for temples. For instance a court of about 137metres by 108metres
was framed by 116 columns.4 But for thetax-payer it was unimportant whether his money was spent on a Seleucid or on an Achaemenian colonnade. What counted wasthat the money wasspent in Iran and

not insome distant mother country ofthe conquerors. Inthis way the greater part ofthe exacted sum returned tothe Iranians inthe form of salaries, payments formaterials, etc. On the other hand the kings did not tryto hellenize their Iranian subjects. The Seleucids lacked the Christian zeal of converting the infidels to thesole true faith or to decent plumbing. The Seleucid kings left people as they had been before the Macedonian conquest; busy with wars and other pressing matters, they had no time and no means, even if they had hadthe inclination, tomeddle inthe daily life oftheir subjects in remote Iran. A royal order issued in western Asia Minor took some fifty days to reach the authorities in Media.1 Edmund Burke said that distance must weaken authority; 'the Seleucids learned by experience that this was the "immutable condition" of their extensive and far-flung empire'. The countryside ofSelucid Iran was left tothe Iranians. The village was a fiscal and economic unit, but its life remains virtually unknown. A Greek observer in 210 B.C.notes the importance of underground irrigation canals (qarzdts).2We do not know whether the Seleucids ever thought of spreading the use of this ingenious device, or otherwise tried to improve the agricultural technology as the Lagids did in Egypt.3 The chieftains oftribes and the khans continued to rule over their men and villages and exploited the peasant as they did before and after the Seleucids. The potentates at Stakhr, near Persepolis, could strike their own silver coins with legends inAramaic and the fire altar on the reverse.4 Country people spoke intheir Iranian dialects, or even in Elamite, and the scribes, as under the Achaemenians, recorded transactions inAramaic. As long aspeace reigned, so that the roads were reasonably secure, and the taxes were collected, the Seleucids did not intervene in local matters. The taxcollector was probably the main

link between the Greek and the Iranian Iran. This "salutary neglect", to quote Burke again, eliminated the most serious and the most frequent cause offriction between analien ruler and anindigenous population. Keeping aloof, the Iranians did not need to resent the invaders. They were able to ignore them, and asanancient historian notes, passively
accepted the succession of their Macedonian overlords.1 The Greek and the Iranian Iran also more or less ignored one another in cultural matters. Being polytheists, theGreeks respected thelocal gods; Nanaia continued tobeworshipped in Susa-Seleucia, just as an
Iranian from Bactria coming to Delos made offerings to Apollo.2 It is true that in times of financial stress the Seleucids sometimes plundered Oriental temples, butit was Mithridates I of Parthia who
sacked the main sanctuaries of the Elymais.3 As to private cults, nobody was impeded if he wanted to worship some exotic deity, be it
Sarapis from Alexandria or the Cappadocian goddess Ma.4 The Greeks still clung to their ancestral gods; they worshipped them even in
Persepolis.5 Greek colonists from Magnesia on the Meander in western Asia Minor brought their (originally Thessalian) gods to Antioch on
the Persian Gulf (now Bushire).6 Likewise, Greek colonists gave Greek names to Iranian rivers and mountains. The Oriental settlers generally erected a new structure on theruins of the old building; Greek settlements were built anew. Even on a small island off the Arabian coast (Ikaros, now Failaka), first a military post, then a tiny
Greek colony was planted bythe Seleucids.7
The Iranians did not succumb tothe charm ofGreek gods. Syncretism was no more than verbal. Herakles was popular among the Greeks, and the Iranians began to represent their hero Verethraghna with Herakles' attributes, just as the Buddhists borrowed the type ofApollo
for images ofthe Buddha.8

GREEK IRAN AND IRANIAN IRAN
Similarly, the two law systems remained separate. The Greeks of Susa published their acts of manumission on the walls of the temple of Nanaia, but these documents were written in Greek and accordingto Greek legal ideas. Law went with the language of the deed. Under the Parthian kings in Kurdistan, atransaction between two Iranian parties, written inGreek in44-5 A.D. follows the Greek law. Atransaction of 53-4 A.D.,concerning the same vineyard, butrecorded in Parthian
Aramaic, isformulated according to alaw system which is not Greek.1 We may guess that under the Seleucids, the countryside ofIran continued to live according to its own traditional and customary law, including the administration ofjustice, in civil litigations atleast.
Greek artwas much appreciated bythe Iranian aristocracy, which
even accepted male nudity insculpture,2 but the potters ofHellenistic
Marv did not follow Greek models.3 A vogue ofGreek eroticism led to fabrication of terracotta figurines of naked women, but the mode disappeared inthe Parthian age. On the other hand, the image ofthe Great Mother ofthe gods on a silver plaque from a Greek colony on the Oxus, though "orientalized ", owes nothing to the Iranian tradition. Yet, Greek and native craftsmen often worked together on the same project and often exchanged technological experience and artistic motifs. For instance, antefixes ofOriental style are used on the monu
ment of Kineas, the founder of a Greek city onthe Oxus,4 and the
disposition ofPersian palaces reappears in buildings ofthe same city.5
How, then, may we explain the "hellenization" ofthe East? As a matter of fact, the modern idea of hellenization is anachronistic. Ithas two sources: first, pro-Macedonian propaganda in Greece before Alexander assured the listeners that the "barbarians" would beonly

THE SELEUCID PERIOD
too happy to exchange their Oriental despotism forGreek manage
ment,1 and the experience of modern colonization. But as we have already observed the empire of the Seleucids wasno "colonial" power. In fact, the contrast between the "Greek" man and the "Oriental" man belongs toprofessorial mythology. The Greek influence was only one of several spiritual forces acting simultaneously onthe Iranians. Under the Achaemenians, the Persians were certainly influenced by Greek art, yet the Achaemenian tower temples go back to the Urartian
prototypes.2 We know nothing about theinfluence of Babylonian civilization onthe Iranians in the Greek period. Yet there certainly were cultural contacts; the sacrificial rules of Uruk, once carried to Elam, were discovered under the Seleucids in Susa ornear Susa, and
copied for the temple ofUruk.3
How complex the interplay ofinfluences was can be illustratedby the history ofalphabets. From the Achaemenian period on, Aramaic was the language of Persian scribes. As late asthe 4th centuryA.D.
they remained learned inboth Aramaic and Persian.4 When the Seleucids ruled Iran, the Indian king Asoka published the Buddhist message
both in Greek and Aramaic and engraved iton stones near Qandahar.5 The Aramaic script was borrowed for numerous Iranian dialects from
Persian to Khwarazmian.6 Yet, in Bactria not only the Bactrians themselves but also the later invaders of the country, the Tukharians and the Kushans, used the Greek alphabet for their languages. Again, the legends of Parthian coins until the middle of the 1st century A.D. were only in Greek.
Further, wemust remember the Persian diaspora in Greek Asia Minor and in such half-Greek countries as Cappadocia. Names like Arsaces son of Artemidoros, the liturgy in Persian, and theGreek dedication (in eastern Caria) to the gods "of the Persians and of the Hellenes " suggest both hellenization and the adherence to the faith of

the fathers.1 This Persian diaspora transmitted to theGreeks the Zoroastrian tradition (and the legends about Zoroaster) and the religion of the Magi. We can imagine that the same diaspora also transmitted
Greek manners toIran.2 Unlike Oriental civilizations, Greek civilization was neither sacerdotal nor tribal. The Greeks were no racists, and everybody was free to choose the Greek way of life. When Alexander founded his military colonies onthe Syr Darya, heenrolled Iranians among the settlers. Antiochus I transferred Babylonians to "the royal city" of Seleucia on the Tigris. Some noble families from Stakhr were settled by
Seleucus I in Karka (Upper Mesopotamia).3 Further, the Greek polis invented naturalization. Analien could not be made Persian, but a Persian could become acitizen of a Greek polis. Naturalized, he would have topay homage tothe gods ofthe city, but he was not expected to abandon hisancestral gods. The conversion required was to the Greek language and the Greek way of life. As Plutarch tells us, children of the "barbarians" inGedrosia (Baluchistan) learned toread Homer. (Some verses ofEuripides were engraved inthe Seleucid period on a
rock near Armavir, inArmenia.)4 They and their fathers had also to exercise naked in thegymnasion, an abomination to the Orientals (and to theRomans). A man who went through this initiation rite either was or became alienated tohis native environment. He became Greek not only inhis language but inhis soul.
Thus, Greek society was anopen and changing society. There was no hereditary nobility of big landowners as in Iranian Iran.The Seleucids, didnothave dynasties of viziers, like theBarmakids of Baghdad. This open society was governed bythe spirit of adventure and greed. It believed that allthat is held in honour and admiration
among men is achieved by toil and venture, experience and intelligence.5 This society ofadventure was open tothe Iranians if they were ready to become Greek; they could become citizens of a Greek polis inIran,

THE SELEUCID PERIOD
or even generals in the Seleucid army. Herodotus observes that of all men the Persians were the readiest to adopt foreign customs.1 In this manner, without planning it, the Greeks decapitated the native nationalism. It is not the rajahs, but the young dreamers of dreams whooverthrow theempires "with prophesying to the old of the newworld's worth". These ambitious dreamers found this new world in the Greek city, in Seleucid service, or in Greek literature. Alexander's Romance wasa more potent factor of hellenization. than Homer.
Thus, the real hellenization of Iran began only after the endof the Seleucids; when the Iranian rulers, beginning with Mithridates I of Parthia, the" Philhellene", as he called himself, needed bright men of Greek education to manage theSeleucid inheritance. The Iranian elite, men who could enjoy the presentation of Euripides' Bacchae atthe Parthian court, were no longer swallowed by the Greek polis, but remained Iranian, and trusted Ahuramazda again, and not Apollo. The Iranians became really hellenized when they believed that Greek wisdom was originally their own, borrowed by theGreeks from their ancestors after Alexander's conquest of Persia.2 Historical myth is sometimes more philosophical than historical facts.3

CHAPTER 2
THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF IRAN
UNDER THE ARSACIDS
THE NATURE OF THE SOURCES
The history of the Parthian kingdom presents a special problem, since the sources on which it must be based are both fragmentary and extraneous. In thepresent state of knowledge, information originating from authentic Parthian sources is scanty in the extreme. Almost all the particulars available are derived from histories written in either Greek or Latin. Both the Seleucid kings of Syria, and the Roman republic andempire, thepatrons of the majority of writers concerned with this subject, were frequently at war with Parthia, so that thetone of the writings is naturally often tinged with hostility. Yet more serious for our understanding than direct hostility (which could easily be discounted) is their lack of inner understanding of Parthia and its society. Such matters as the dominant Parthian ideals andaspirations, or theethnic andlinguistic make-up of the kingdom, would not have been apparent to uninformed observers under the stress of military operations. Moreover, the literary fashion ofthe classical world frowned on detailed descriptions of far-away peoples and places, as is clear
from the scornful comment of Lucian1 on the author of a Parthian history "who gives, according to his own idea, the clearest, most convincing description ofevery town, mountain, plain orriver... Why, Vologesus's breeches or hisbridle, God bless me, they take up several thousand lines apiece." Some at least of these supposedly unnecessary details would have the greatest interest for the present-day historian. Yet it is only occasionally that the prevailing narrowness of outlook of the classical historians is offset bydetails supplied byauthors resident in theGreek cities within theParthian state, andthus possessing closer acquaintance with the Arsacids andtheir society. Fragments from the lost Parthica of Apollodorus of Artemita, a Greek city of eastern Iraq,
are often quoted in the Geography of Strabo.2 Tarn believed that the detailed account of Parthian history contained in books XLI and XLII

IRAN UNDER THE ARSACIDS
of the lost Historiae Philippicae of Pompeius Trogusx derived from a second Greek author, distinct from Apollodorus. Much of their content survives, though greatly abbreviated, in the Epitome of Justin, a work therefore indispensable for historians of Parthia, even though the failings of the epitomator are frequently blamed. The account of the overthrow of the Roman general Crassus at the battle of Carrhae narrated in Plutarch's Life ofCrassus is thought to be derived from a Greek resident ofMesopotamia. Again, Isidore ofCharax (the Hellenistic city at the head ofthe Persian Gulf) wrote the short but valuable itinerary Parthian Stations* thought to be an extract from a longer work, theDescription of Parthia mentioned by Athenaeus.3 Isidore is dated to about the beginning of the Christian Era. Interesting details of the experiences of a visitor to Parthia some forty years later are found in Philostratus' Life of Apollonius ofTyana. Otherwise the chief sources for the historian of Parthia are theoccasional notices given by such western historians as Polybius, Dio Cassius and Tacitus.
These classical literary sources can besupplemented to some extent by epigraphic and documentary evidence. Certain inscriptions inGreek from Bisitiin in Iran,4 and from Susa, refer tothe affairs ofthe Parthian kingdom. There are also a number oflapidary inscriptions in Parthian6 and Aramaic. A further source of authentically Parthian information which is likely to increase as archaeological research advances is supplied by the finds ofostraca with Parthian inscriptions. The largest volumes sofarhave been excavated at Nisa in Soviet Turkmenistan,6 and are concerned chiefly with arrangements forthe delivery of consignments ofwine. They contain information onland tenure, qualities of wine, official titles, and occasionally the names and regnal dates of rulers. Minor finds, of different content (some probably ration-lists or nominal rolls) have come from Dura-Europos in Syria, from Nippur in Iraq, and inIran from Shahr-i Qumis near Damghan.7 Such ostraca are probably common objects on Parthian sites, and future finds should

NATURE OF THE SOURCES
give valuable information onParthian chronology and dynastic Parthian titles. Parthian official titles indeed present considerable interest:
nwhdr "commander" (orthelike),1 a term of which theassociation with this Parthian frontier is confirmed by the district name Beth
Nuhadra in northern Iraq;2psgryb* "successor" known from inscrip
tions at Hatra andat Urfa (Edessa);3 and perhaps even the Syriac term bwdr(bdr), thought to reflect a Parthian word bgdr"custodianof
the deity".4 There exists another source ofinformation especially typical ofthe Arsacid Parthians, but not always easy to interpret in strict historical terms. This is theoral poetry of the Parthian minstrels, who were
known inParthian by the term gosdn.hSome oftheir poems dealt with historical or epic themes, andhave been preserved through incorporation in surviving poems inmodern Persian. Among such survivals are the narratives ofRustam and ofGodarz - relating infact toevents of Parthian times - preserved in the section of the Shdh-ndma dealing with the reign ofKai Kaviis, and thus out oftheir true chronological context. Another Parthian survival is represented by the romantic
poem Visu Rdmin, which, as Minorsky has shown,6 contains many details which suggest an Arsacid background, but can hardly be referred to any precise historical context.
The scattered nature of the sources for Arsacid history, and in particular the relevance ofmany brief mentions inthe longer works of classical authors devoted primarily to other themes, makes a guide to the relevant literature essential for the modern student. Gutschmid's
basic work7 remains useful, but contains several misleading theoriesand should not be accepted uncritically. That ofDebevoise isstill probably the most complete and upto date forthis purpose, though its rather prosaic style makes continuous reading laborious. Itis used extensively in the pages that follow. Theauthor's coverage of the periodical literature is especially thorough. Rawlinson's older account, though

naturally dated, is still of considerable service. The most recent fulllength discussion of Parthian history is that of Neusner, whose emphasis is onthe Jewish texts and Jewish connections, and inevitably in other respects finds the classical sources much asthey had appeared to earlier writers.
THE GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING
The ancient satrapy which once occupied the north-east angle of present-day Iran, and overlapped the boundary of Asiatic Soviet territory, had been known under the name of Parthava since the days
of Darius' Bisitun inscription (521 B.C.), and indeed long before.1 Yet its borders, which nodoubt grew and shrank with the vicissitudes of history, arenone tooeasy to define in detail. Under Darius, Parthia and Hyrcania formed in some sense a unit, aswe may infer from their juxtaposition in the text of the inscription: Pardava: uta\ Varkdna: hamifiyd: abava: hacdma "Parthia and Hyrcania became rebellious towards me." Both were then the concern ofVistaspa, satrap ofParthia and father of the king. The two towns of Vispauzati and Patigrabana lay within the boundaries ofParthia, but their sites are unknown today. For theamalgamation of Hyrcania andParthia there areindications also inlate Seleucid times. The ancient western boundary of Hyrcania, the modern Gurgan province, lay, if we may depend on evidence of the Sasanian period, at the south-east corner ofthe Caspian Sea, more precisely along theSasanian wall of which the traces can still beseen running from between the villages of Sarkalata and Karkanda towards
the sea a few kilometres east of Bandar Gaz.2 Between Hyrcania and Parthia proper theline must have run through the hills lying east of the present town of Gunbad-i Qabus, butis not easily fixed at any point upon the ground.
Southwards from its junction with Hyrcania the investigation of the boundary of Parthia raises different problems. In the inscription of the Sasanian Shapur I, drafted towards A.D. 260, adistinction is made between the provinces of Parthia andAbarshahr. Thelatter is the earlier name ofthe city which has come tobeknown asNishapur, but which some authorities have sought to derive from thename of the Aparni, a tribe soon to assume a prominent place in ourstory. Itis

There is,however, no hint of its existence as a separate administrative unit under the Achaemenians, and Herzfeld invoked a passage of the Arab geographer Yaqut as evidence that under theArsacids theprovince of Parthia extended as far south in Khurasan as Gunabad and Birjand.1 This hypothesis was to some extent supported by thediscovery of inscriptions in Parthian at Kal-i Jangal near Birjand.2 To thewestward, the natural boundary of the province was formed by the historically famous pass of the Caspian Gates, securely fixed by modern research in thedefile of Sar-i Darra, 87 kilometres east of Tehran on theoldKhurasan road.3 Thus in the south-westerly direction Parthia surrounded Hyrcania onthe southern side. On theeastern flank, thedividing line from Aria, the province of Herat, will have runon or near thelower course of the Harlrud, and close to the present frontier of Afghanistan. By the combination of several texts, Herzfeld was able to infer that the city of Tus wasthe capital of the Achaemenian province of Parthava. Presumably it was therefore the residence of Vistaspa, the father of Darius, who was satrap of that province according to theBlsitun inscription.
North of the Kopet Dagh range, beyond the present-day frontier of Iran with the U.S.S.R. but again within the ancient Parthia, ran a narrow strip ofcultivable land watered by streams from the mountains. This is the area served today bythe line of the Trans-Caspian railway. By the end of the 3rd century B.C., if not indeed earlier, considerable towns were beginning to form in this region. The two ancient settlements ofNisa ("Old" and " N e w " Nisa) lay a few miles to the westof the present city of Ashkabad ('Ishqabad) in Soviet Turkmenistan. Further to the east was the ancient site ofAbivard, at Kuhna Ablvard, 8.5 kilometres west of the railway station of Kahkala (Kakhka) on the Trans-Caspian railway. Also in this same ancient district of Apavarcticene, it may be inferred, lay the stronghold ofDara, built by Tiridates I of Parthia (see below, p. 769). Northward from themountain fringe stretched an arid steppe, thehome of the nomadic peoples who were to play the dominant part in the subsequent history of the Parthian kingdom. The first explicit mentions of this nomad confederacy, the Daha (Latin "Dahae"), come in the list of nations of the famous

THE GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING
"Daeva" Inscription ofXerxes atPersepolis, and inYasht 13.1 They are followed in the list by a "Scythian" group, the Saka Haumavarga, whose habitat was around the delta of the Jaxartes, modern Syr Darya; and who arethus appropriately listed as neighbours of the Daha. Amongst the various tribal groups included inthe confederacy ofthe Dahae, the most prominent were the Parni, also called the Aparni, from among whom the dynasty of the Arsacids drew their origin. Lesser tribes, of whom mention is made, were the Xanthii and the Pissuri. So far as the linguistic affinities of these peoples are concerned, it is plausible to assume that the north-west Iranian dialect that is known ina later period as"Parthian" should be the original dialect of the Iranian cultivators ofthe province ofParthia. To the incoming Parni may rather be ascribed aform of speech showing a stronger east Iranian element, resulting from their proximity on the steppe to the east Iranian Sakas. Instances of east Iranian loan-words surviving in
Parthian have been discussed by Henning.2 They recall the phraseof
Justin,3 no doubt slightly exaggerated: "Their speech was midway between Scythian and Median, and contained features of both."
The tribal group of the Dahae bequeathed their name to the province on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea, which throughout the Islamic Middle Ages retained the designation of Dihistan, even though its original occupants had disappeared. Itwas the regular medieval custom in Iranian-speaking lands for the provincial name tobe applied tothe headquarters city (e.g. Gurgan, Kirman). Inthe case ofDihistan, this name has become attached inlater usage tono less than three ofthe towns: to one onthe Caspian coast; to the old provincial centreof Akhur in Soviet Turkmenistan, twenty-three farsakhs (some seventy miles) north of Jurjan, modern Gunbad-i Qabus; and to a place called by the Arab geographers Ribat, later Mashhad-i Misriyan, the well-known
Islamic fortified site in the same territory.4 However, there are no reports of archaeological finds relating to the Parthian period from any of these places, and the urban centre of the ancient Dahae(if indeed they possessed one) is quite unknown.

IRAN UNDER THE ARSACIDS
THE BEGINNING OF ARSACID RULE
The first fixed point in Parthian history is provided by the startingpoint ofthe Arsacid era, the vernal equinox of247 B.C. The significance for the Parthians ofthis moment intime has been variously explained:
by Gardner1 it was seen as the date ofa Parthian revolt against Seleucid suzerainty; byTarn, asthe coronation year of Tiridates I, the second
Parthian king.2 Another evident possibility is that it could represent the actual enthronement year of Arsaces I, thefounder andeponym of the dynasty. However, this less sophisticated theory has until recently proved difficult to reconcile with theliterary accounts relating to the foundation of the Arsacid kingdom. The plausibility of yet a fourth explanation forthe origin ofthe era in 247 B.C. should also not belost to view. Since the year 246 B.C. was the last ofthe reign ofAntiochus II over the Seleucid empire, and allowance has moreover to bemadefor the autonomous reign of the satrap Andragoras in Parthia, it may be that 247 B.C. was reckoned the last year oflegitimate Seleucid authority in theprovince, andthat Arsaces subsequently backdated his regnal years to this moment and ignored the unconstitutional episode of Andragoras.
The literary sources forthe rise ofthe Arsacid dynasty have recently
been re-examined in a series of articles by Wolski.3 Whilst the view had previously prevailed that thetribe of the Parni rose against the Seleucid authority in about 250B.C., or at any rate shortly before 247 B.C, this scholar embarked upon a detailed source-criticism of the ancient texts which refer to the event, and has concluded that the
version provided by Justin and Strabo4is a distinct tradition, and superior to that represented by thefragments of Arrian's Parthica in Photius and Syncellus, andthe statements of Eusebius. In Wolski's view, therefore, theauthentic version is that the Seleucid satrapy of Bactria established its autonomy of the Seleucid kingdom in about 239 B.C.under its governor Diodotus; andthat Arsaces established his independent rule in Parthia in the following year, 238 B.C. Shortly afterwards must have taken place theinconclusive eastern campaign of the Seleucid ruler Seleucus II Callinicus. After a number of skir

mishes with theParthians, he was obliged byfurther disturbances in Asia Minor toreturn toAntioch, and leave the newly founded Parthian kingdom to its own devices. In Wolski's opinion, indeed, "The socalled Arsacid era and the numismatic evidence are ofno importance" for the question of chronology.1 Such an attitude may be thought extreme; yet ifWolski's interpretation of the literary sources can indeed be reconciled with a satisfactory explanation of the inauguration of the Arsacid era, as onthe lines suggested above, it would be possible to arrive at anacceptable sequence ofevents.
Accordingly, wemight conclude that theepoch of 247 B.C. marks rather the commencement of the bid by Andragoras for power in Parthia than that of Arsaces and his Parni. The historicity of Andragoras is confirmed bythe discovery of his gold and silver coins in the Oxus Treasure2 and more recently, by a Greek inscription published by Robert.8 The latter, indeed, refers to Andragoras as a satrap already under Antiochus I, and suggests that he may have held his office for nearly twenty years before he was overcome by the Parni. This circumstance makes it less likely that the satrap's rule could have been prolonged to solate a date as 238 B.C.
According to what may have been regarded as the traditional account, the revolt of the Parni against Andragoras was ledby two brothers, Arsaces the founder, and Tiridates; the latter is the Tiridates I of the Arsacid dynastic table. After the death of Arsaces, atadate not precisely known, Tiridates succeeded to the throne. He reigned until about 211 B.C., shortly before the eastern campaign of Antiochus III the Great. His successor, who apparently occupied the throne duringthe hostilities against Antiochus, was Artabanus I. The peace terms eventually agreed by the Parthians with Antiochus involved their formal acceptance of a feudatory status; buttherapid withdrawal of the Seleucid forces when Antiochus returned to the west, and in 189 B.C. sustained defeat at the hands of the Romans in the battle of Magnesia, meant that in fact the young kingdom was subjected to little interference. In about 191 B.C. Artabanus was in turn succeeded by his son Priapatius.

IRAN UNDER THE ARSACIDS
decades ofthe Arsacid kingdom has given rise toa number of sceptical hypotheses. One of these regarded the first Arsaces as a legendary figure, and tended toascribe toTiridates I the chief role in the establishment ofthe kingdom. Another interpretation, which was developed by Wolski, involved the assumption that Tiridates was legendary, and that in fact the first Arsaces reigned for more than thirty years. Moreover, Wolski rejects the historicity of an "Artabanus I " at this period, and interprets to theletter the statement of Justin (XLI 5. 6) that the son and successor of Arsaces was known by the same name.1 The majority of recent commentators accept Wolski's view, and commence the Arsacid dynastic list with Arsaces I andII. Yetplausible though this reasoning seems, the scanty evidence seems hardly sufficient to establish conclusively either of the two hypotheses or wholly to eliminate the possibility that certain elements of truth could be present in both themain historical traditions. Accordingly, theaccompanying dynastic tables include both theolder chronology, and that based on the views of Wolski, and subsequently elaborated by LeRider. Moreover, the ostraca discovered in recent years at Nisa have tended to weigh against the more recent theories. Whilst the ostraca contain only fragmentary data of interest from the viewpoint of political history, such indications as they do provide harmonize satisfactorily with the "traditional" narrative. The text which has been most widely discussed for its historical implications in this connection is Ostracon No. 1760.2 I t will be helpful toquote here the reading ofthis document which was proposed byDyakonov and Livshits:

the work of the historian or numismatist.3 None the less the Arsacid

THE BEGINNING OF ARSACID RULE
date, anno 157, included in the text fixes it to the year 91 B.C., and thus suggests that the ruler under whom it was written would have been either Mithradates II (c. 123-88/7 B.C.) or Gotarzes I(91-81/80 B.C.) whose reigns overlapped atthis time during several years. Mithradates II was indeed, andGotarzes I may well have been, grandsons of Priapatius, and the latter in turn a nephew's son of the first Arsaces. The historicity ofthe first Arsaces, and the general correctness of the succession, as transmitted by the classical historians, isthus confirmed. The genealogical table compiled by Frye is based on these assumptions,1 but those offered byChaumont and Bickerman depend onsomewhat varied interpretations, and must be subject to reservations. There seems at any rate sufficient justification for accepting the traditional version of events: that Arsaces, chief of the Parni, and perhaps originally a local ruler in Bactria, crushed Andragoras, veteran satrap of Parthia and Hyrcania in about 238 B.C. andmastered those provinces. He repelled the punitive expedition of Seleucus II, and was succeeded by his able brother Tiridates. The latter inturn was succeeded by his son Artabanus I, who opposed the invasion ofAntiochus IIIin 209 B.C. Artabanus again was succeeded by hisson Priapatius, who reigned for fifteen years to 176 B.C., and bequeathed the throne to his eldest son, Phraates I. Under the reign of the latter, the expansion of the Parthian kingdom began once more.
The incursion ofAntiochus III had interrupted the Arsacid control of that part ofthe province ofParthia which lies south ofthe Alburz Range around Damghan and Shahrud. Phraates I not only reasserted Parthian jurisdiction upto the Caspian Gates, but even beyond; for he was able to establish a garrison ofMardians, tribesmen of Mazandaran, at the strongpoint of Charax immediately onthe western side of the Gates.2 Thus he prepared the way for theParthian advance into the province ofMedia, still at this period a strongly held outpost of the Seleucid empire with its headquarters at Ecbatana, the modern Hamadan. However, the conquest ofMedia for the Parthian kingdom was toremain a task for his son and successor, the mighty Mithradates I, whose accession to the throne is reckoned to have taken place in about 171 B.C, and who istobe considered the real author of Parthian expansion tothe rank ofa world-empire.

THE EXPANSION OF ARSACID POWER
Meanwhile, in 175 B.C., a grandiose personality, the Seleucid Antiochus IV Epiphanes, hadseized theSyrian throne at Antioch to avenge theassassination of his brother Seleucus IVPhilopator. Sensitive to the threat which the Parthians represented to his eastern
provinces, hedevised (ifthe thesis of Tarn beaccepted)1 an elaborate scheme to restore the situation. In Bactria, he raised the formidable figure of Eucratides toexpel the princes ofthe Euthydemid house who were no more than rebels in his eyes. As governor of Media he installed hispowerful minister Timarchus, whose later alliance with
Eucratides is evidenced by theparallelism of their coins.2 It wasnot until nearly eight years later, when the position ofEucratides was well established, that Antiochus himself moved totake charge of operations in theSeleucid east. Hewas successful in reducing King Artaxias of Armenia to vassalage, and theattribution of the name Epiphania to
Ecbatana hasbeen linked with his activity.3 None the less, the imprecision of the ancient sources makes it difficult to construct an intelligible narrative of his subsequent movements in Iran. Heis said to have coveted the treasures of a temple of Artemis (Nanaia) in
Elymais;4 to have tried to getpossession of them by thedevice of a ritual marriage to thegoddess, an expedient that hadbeen employed elsewhere; to have been repelled by theindignant citizens; to have
been driven out of Persepolis bya rising of the inhabitants ;5 to have returned to Ecbatana, andto have been gravely injured in a fall from
his chariot. Finally heis said to have died at Tabae,6 which must be

6 According to 2 Maccabees ix. 2, thecity in which Antiochus hadsought to despoil the temple wasPersepolis.

THE EXPANSION OF ARSACID POWER
corrected to Gabae, the old name of Jay, now a suburb of Isfahan. His death took place between 20 November and 18 December 164 B.C., and whatever the exact sequence of events during his last months, he was never in a position to embark on military operations against the steadily growing power of Parthia.
Meanwhile Mithradates I, the real founder of Parthia as a major power, hadascended theParthian throne, andwas awaiting the time when his plans for the expansion of his kingdom could be put into effect. To theeast he hadto face thepowerful Graeco-Bactrian ruler Eucratides. Notonly didMithradates secure hisown frontier, but he succeeded in annexing the Bactrian eparchies of Tapuria and Traxiana. To the south-west, in Media, was theally of Eucratides, Timarchus. Though the latter was soon overthrown by the new Seleucid claimant, Demetrius I Soter, it is likely to have been more than a decade before the situation was ripe forthe definitive Parthian advance. Numismatic studies have shown that after the fall of Timarchus, coins were struck at Ecbatana notonly for Demetrius I (161-150 B.C.), butalso during the opening years of Alexander Balas (150-145 B.C.).1 The advance of Mithradates against Ecbatana hasbeen placed in 148or 147 B.C., a conclusion which finds confirmation in theGreek inscription associated with the figure ofHeracles uncovered a few years ago atBisitun :2
In the year 164 and the month Panemos Hyakinthos, son of Pantaukhos [erected this statue of]
Heracles Triumphant for the safety of Kleomenes, Viceroy of the Upper Satrapies. Here the year 164 of the Seleucid era corresponds to 149/8 B.C. (312—164+1 = 149), andthe month Panemos is the seventh of the Macedonian calendar (of which the year began in October), so that Panemos in general terms would have fallen in June 148 B.C.At this moment it appears that a Seleucid viceroy still held office in Media, but his safety was giving rise to anxiety so acute as to prompt the erection ofsuch a dedication. The occupation ofMedia by Mithradates I may have taken place at any time after this moment, butthe indications are that the interval was not more than a year, and may well have been a matter of weeks.

IRAN UNDER THE ARSACIDS
Meanwhile, the involved struggles for the Seleucid succession at Antioch were sapping the control of the dynasty over its outlying provinces, and preparing theway for a further advance of Mithradates. For an understanding of the circumstances of Parthian expansion at this moment, it is necessary to give a summary of events in the Seleucid kingdom. After the death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, his cunning minister Lysias made the accession of his son, thechild-king Antiochus V Eupator, thepretext for an exercise of his own authority. The elder cousin Demetrius, then a hostage at Rome, effected hisescape to Syria, was acclaimed as king, put both child and minister to death, and crushed Timarchus asalready described. But twelve years later Alexander Balas, claimed as the second sonof Epiphanes, wasset up against him as a pretender, and supported by Ptolemy Philometor of Egypt. In 150B.C. Demetrius methis fate in battle against the newclaimant. Yet the reign of Balas was to last only five years. Then the eldest surviving sonof Demetrius Soter, a youth in histeens, and also named Demetrius (II), raised a force of Cretan mercenaries and landed in Syria. Balas made themistake of quarrelling with hisEgyptian patron, who switched his support to Demetrius, and in the ensuing battle Balas was routed, and a few days later hunted down. Ptolemy, who took part personally in thebattle on theside of Demetrius, was fatally wounded, so that Demetrius II remained in complete control ofthe Seleucid kingdom. He was able to secure recognition of his rule at Seleucia-on-the-Tigris, where four coin issues have been attributed to him.1Susa, however, had passed in 147 B.C.into the power of Kamniskires, the king of Elymais, and wasnever again recovered by the Seleucid authorities.2
As early as the late summer of 145 B.C. the military commander Tryphon set up an infant son of Balas, Antiochus VI, as king in opposition to Demetrius, and even gained possession of Antioch. Demetrius meanwhile held the greater part of the Syrian coast. Then in the east during 141 B.C. Mithradates invaded Babylonia and occupied Seleucia. Tetradrachms areattributed to him in the series of this mint for theyear 141/40 B.C, andthere aredated issues for theyears 140/39 and 139/8.3 Mithradates then withdrew to his residence in Hyrcania, but his forces pressed on southwards to defeat the army of Elymais at Apamea near the modern Qut al-'Amara. Soon afterwards the Parthians were able to occupy Susa, where coins were again struck for Mithradates. Meanwhile, appeals forhelp from the Greeks of Babylonia

reached Demetrius in Syria, and "in the hundred threescore and twelfth year"1 (312—172+i = 141/0 B.C.), that is to say, during the spring of 140 B.C., he gathered a force and moved into Babylonia and perhaps Media. Apparently Demetrius II hoped not only to recover these provinces from thegenerals of Mithradates, butalso to raise in the east loyal reinforcements with which hecould return to overcome the usurpur Tryphon. None the less, his audacity and some early successes were in vain. In the following year (139 B.C.), defeated and taken prisoner byone of the Parthian generals, hewas paraded through the cities which theParthians had won. Finally, Demetrius was sent to Mithradates in Hyrcania. The Arsacid notonly treated him kindly, but while holding himas a prisoner, even gave him his daughter Rhodogune asa wife.
After the capture of Demetrius II, resistance to the generals of Mithradates was at anend in Babylonia. The Persians, the Elymaeans and, it is said, the Bactrians had made common cause with Demetrius, and it was against the Elymaeans that the Parthian troops were now unleashed. Their temples, both of "Athena" andvof "Artemis", the latter known as theAzara, were pillaged, it is said, of ten thousand talents of treasure; and their capital city, Seleucia-on-the-Hedyphon, was taken.2 This was themoment, in theclosing months of Mithradates' reign, when the Parthian empire attained for the time its maximum extent. According to the account given bythe late author Orosius,8 " H e defeated thegovernor of Demetrius and invaded the city of Babylon, and allthe boundaries of its province. Furthermore he subjugated allthe provinces which liebetween the Hydaspes and the Indus." Some commentators have sought to identify the Hydaspes here with theriver of that name, now theJhelum, situated in the Punjab. Yet itis hardly possible that the power of Mithradates extended so far into the kingdom ofthe Graeco-Bactrian kings. More probable is theview which links thename Hydaspes here with the "Median Hydaspes" ofVirgil.4 Here the name seems but analternative forthe Choaspes, the modern Karkha, which indeed rises in the mountains of Media. And the territory won byMithradates thus extended from the Karkha along the shores ofthe Persian Gulf to themouth of the Indus in Sind.5

IRAN UNDER THE ARSACIDS
THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE PARTHIAN KINGDOM
The reign of Mithradates I came to an end in 138/7 B.C., the first precisely established regnal date of Parthian history. His rule had been both long andprosperous, lasting as it didfor more than forty-three years. During hislast months, however, a new threat was growing to the rising power of Parthia, and this was to become the chief preoccupation of his immediate successors. Disturbances along the area of the Chinese frontier had set onfoot alarge-scale westward migration in Central Asia. Thepowerful tribal confederation of the Yueh-chi, apparently identical with that known to the classical writers as the Tochari, hadbeen attacked by their Altaic neighbours the Hsiung-nu (ancestors, it seems, of the later Huns), and driven pell-mell from their grazing-grounds in Kansu province. The Yueh-chi emigrated westwards, probably by wayof Turfan and Qarashahr, andalong the Hi River. In the course of their march they collided from time to time with another formidable horde, the Wu-sun, who may have been identical with the Issedones mentioned by Herodotus and other classical writers. Finally, passing Lake Issik Kol, theYueh-chih emerged from the mountains once more onto the steppe, defeating and driving before them the Saka tribes whohad pastured there since the days ofthe Achaemenian empire. These Saka peoples seem to have been of eastern Iranian speech, andmay well have included ancestors of the Afghans, the present-day speakers of Pashto.
Thus it came about that the displaced Sacae, ofwhom the group most prominently mentioned was that of the Sacaraucae (Saka rawaka), began to impinge on the Parthian boundaries early in the reign of Phraates II (139/8-r. 128 B.C.). They may indeed have already appeared in the last days of Mithradates I. Yet before matters reached a crisison the eastern frontier of Parthia, Phraates was faced with a fresh onslaught from another direction. In Syria, the usurper Tryphon continued to rule over the greater part of the country, with his main strength in Apamea and in Antioch. Cleopatra, daughter of Ptolemy Philometor of Egypt, whohadbeen married to Demetrius II who was now captive, held out in Seleucia-inPieria on the Syrian coast. Despairing of making headway alone against the usurper, she called in her brother-in-law Antiochus, the younger son of Demetrius Soter whohad been brought up at Side, and offered him her hand. Thus Antiochus was acclaimed king, becom

CONSOLIDATION OF THE PARTHIANS
ing known to historians as Antiochus VIISidetes. Commanding as a legitimate claimant the loyalty of the Macedonian population, he soon overcame Tryphon, andonce more succeeded in unifying the Syrian kingdom. Then in 130 B.C. he mustered a powerful army, whichone account claims consisted of eighty thousand foot,1 and for which other sources allege the incredible total of three hundred thousand, and set out to expel the Parthians from Babylonia. At first his boldness was rewarded. Antiochus defeated the Parthians in three battles. In one, on the River Lycus (Greater Zab)he overcame the Parthian general Indates. Enius, the Parthian governor of Babylonia, was massacred in a rising of the citizens. At Susa, a little-known usurper named Tigraios had been issuing copper coins from 137 B.C. to 133/2 B.C., when a sporadic issue in the name ofAntiochus is recorded for themint. Antiochus advanced into Media, where, as winter drew on, hesent his army into winter quarters. Already men began to speak of him as the Great King.
In the circumstances that prevailed, the large numbers of the Seleucid force no doubt proved something of an embarrassment. It was necessary to disperse them among the several cities, and even then the feeding ofthem became a burden forthe inhabitants. Nevertheless, the situation of Phraates II andtheParthians looked dangerous,and emissaries came to Antiochus to discuss terms for a settlement.The attitude taken by theyoung king was uncompromising. Peace would not be made unless the captive king Demetrius wasset free, unless the Parthians relinquished all territory outside the province of Parthia, and once more paid tribute to the Seleucids asinformer times. Understandably, Phraates broke offthe negotiations. But hereleased Demetrius, and sent him home to Syria, inthe hope ofcreating a diversion in Antiochus's rear.
As the spring of 129 B.C. came in, the cities ofMedia became restive under theburden of supplying the Seleucid garrisons, and moreover they were oppressed by the general Athenaeus. The agents of Phraates found it an easy task to stir up the citizens toattack the Seleucid troops, disorganized nowby the inactivity of the winter. When Antiochus hastened out with his household troops to support the nearest detachments, hewas surprised bythe appearance of the main Parthian force. He sustained the attack against the advice ofhis officers, found himself left alone when his men were putto flight, andso lost hislife.The

great Seleucid army was thus completely routed, and captured or slain almost toa man. The number ofkilled was put atthe prodigious figure of three hundred thousand, but as the aftermath shows many were taken prisoner. Amongst them was the young Seleucus, son of Antiochus Sidetes, later brought up as a prince at theParthian court;and the daughter of Demetrius, who found a place in the royal harem.As for the body of Antiochus, it was treated with all possible honour, and returned to Syria forburial in a silver coffin.
After his victory over the Seleucid, Phraates had determined to advance onSyria. But the Saka invasion onhis eastern frontier obliged him toabandon this plan. Already during the war with Antiochus VII, Saka mercenaries were being enlisted for the Parthian armies. For them, the sudden end of the campaign came as a surprise. Finding that they had arrived too late to take part in the fighting, the nomads were reluctant toaccept dismissal without wages, and demanded either that their expenses should be paid, or that they should be employed against another enemy. When both were refused, the Sakas fell to ravaging Parthian territory, andsome aresaid to have penetrated as far west as Mesopotamia. Themain body of their tribesmen were pressing on behind, and already, so it seems, had swept away the Greek settlements inBactria. Now the chief preoccupation of Phraates was to repel theadvancing Sakas. Just as he had tried to divert their ferocity against the Seleucid forces, so now he pressed the prisoners from the army of Antiochus into service to oppose the new invaders. He may have counted onthe fact that they would befacing unknown foes in a strange land, andwould have to fight for their lives.But when the armies met, and the Greeks saw that the Parthians were hard pressed, they deserted to theenemy. Thus theParthians were overwhelmed, and in the slaughter which followed (128 B.C.), Phraates himself was killed.1
The succeeding Arsacid ruler, Artabanus II (c. 128 B.c-124/3)had again to contend with the nomad threat to Parthia. Yet problems arise from the statement of Justin that it was the Tochari against whom he waged war.2 Since previously Phraates II had been engaged with the Sacaraucae, andit was known that the Tochari hadbeen advancing behind the latter, and were thought atthis moment tohave been settled north of the Oxus, there is difficulty in the narrative which brings them into contact with Artabanus II ofParthia. Tarn indeed dismissed

as impossible the statement that the Tochari were involved with Parthia at this moment.1 Yet where thesources areso fragmentary as for these incidents, and the detailed succession of events so little known, it is best to retain theevidence of the texts so far as possible. In any event, Artabanus is reported to have died in battle - against the Tochari - after receiving a wound inthe arm, perhaps from a poisoned arrow. It is to hisultimate successor, Mithradates II (124/3-87 B.C.), later surnamed the Great, that credit must be given not only for securing the eastern boundaries of Parthia against thenomad threat, andeven indeed enlarging them, but also for stabilizing the Arsacid administration in Babylonia, an area soon to become the very heart of the kingdom.
It was probably owing to the vulnerability of the old Parthian homeland around Nisa and Ablvard to nomad raids by the fiercer tribes from beyond the Oxus that the headquarters ofParthian government gradually shifted westwards during thelate 2nd andthe whole of the 1st centuries B.C. Whether the official name of Mihrdadkert given to the city of Nisa originated with Mithradates I himself, or derived from some earlier, perhaps even Achaemenian, governor of that name, is perhaps still an open question, owing to thefact that a monogram which can beread as" Mithradatkert" appears on Parthian coins before the accession ofMithradates.2 That ruler, according to the historical accounts, had frequently resided inthe province of Hyrcania. The site of Hecatompylos in Comisene, south of the Alburz range, is called by several classical writers a Parthian capital,3 and has been located by recent research at Shahr-i Qumis, near Qusha, and32 km to the west of Damghan.4 Further excavation at this site should establish with more precision thedate, probably towards the middle of the 2nd century B.C., when this nowadays rather desolate site became a royal headquarters and winter residence. No doubt it wasbuta temporary stage in thesteady progress of the Arsacid kings towards their ultimate capital at Ctesiphon inBabylonia. Yet owing to political vicissitudes of the 1st century B.C., during which Seleucia and Ctesiphon were frequently in the hands of pretenders to the throne, the move may not have become final until the reign ofGotarzes I (91-^. 80 B.C.).

Indeed, occasional royal visits to Hecatompylos may even have continued until the accession of Orodes II in 58/7 B.C., and his subsequent capture of Seleucia from his brother Mithradates III directed the main aspirations of Parthia towards the west, asweshall see. For a summer residence the higher altitude of Hamadan (Ecbatana) was preferred from at least thetime of Mithradates II (c. 124 B.C.).1
After the victory of Phraates II over Antiochus VII the Parthian governorship of Babylonia, with its great capital of Seleucia-on-theTigris, hadbeen entrusted to Himerus, whose stern reprisals against the Macedonian element for their recent defection were the cause of bitter complaints. Meanwhile, at the mouth of the Tigris, a new state, that of Characene, was forming under therule of the local governor Hyspaosines, whowas not himself a subject of the Parthian king. Near the present site of Qurna at the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates,2 Alexander the Great had founded a vast city. After damage by floods, it had been restored under the name of Antiochia either by Antiochus III, or perhaps byAntiochus IV. With the lapse of Seleucid government, its satrap Hyspaosines found himself an independent ruler, and powerfully refortified the town, so that it acquired the name of Spasinou Charax, "the fort of Hyspaosines". When attacked by the Parthian governor Himerus,8 Hyspaosines at first got the upper hand, andis attested by cuneiform tablets to have gained possession of Babylon in 127 B.C. and also, it seems briefly, of Seleucia. The issue of coins by Hyspaosines at his capital commenced in 124/3 B.C.,but there is noevidence forhis having used the mint at Seleucia.4 Neither is hecredited with mint-activity at Susa, where copper coins attestthe constant adherence of the city to its Arsacid overlords. In 122/1B.C. the newly enthroned Mithradates II arrived in Babylonia to settle accounts with Hyspaosines, whose copper coins he soon overstruck with the Parthian types in Spasinou Charax itself.5 Thus it appears that he completely overthrew the Characenian, yet nevertheless Hyspaosines returned to his throne, andthe state which he founded continued to exist under Parthian suzerainty until the coming of the Sasanians in A.D. 224. Mithradates moreover waged war successfully

against Artavasdes I, king ofArmenia; and the young Armenian prince Tigranes, taken to Parthia as a hostage on this occasion, was later, of course, to become the most powerful ruler ofhis line. It was no doubt also under Mithradates II that Parthian rule was re-established over the invading Saka tribes in the new territories which they had overrun in what is today Sistan (originally Sakastan). Gradually the whole Helmand-Qandahar region, and even thePunjab as far to theeast as Taxila, came under the sway of the Indo-Parthian dynasty, who ruled during the ist century A.D. asallies and equals of the Arsacids in Iran. Though Herzfeld's elaborate reconstruction of the rise to power in this area of the Parthian house of Suren1 is likely to correspond in very general terms with thetrue situation, it cannot beinsisted upon for points of detail. In particular, hisidentification of the Vonones of the Indo-Scythian coinage, placed nowby current research before 57 B.C.,2 with Vonones of Parthia (A.D. 8/9-11/12) involves a manifest anachronism.
Perhaps the most significant changes in our understanding of Parthian history as a result of recent investigation relate to thecareer of the personality now known as Gotarzes I. Two poorly preserved rock-sculptures atBisitun, at the foot ofthe rock upon which is carved the inscription of Darius, refer to this personage. That on the left, mutilated by a 19th-century Qajar inscription, canbe reconstructed with thehelp of an early drawing by Grelot.3 It shows four notables standing before a king. The accompanying Greek inscription names the latter as "the Great King Mithradates", that is to say Mithradates II. The four notables are Gotarzes, satrap ofsatraps, one name illegible, Mithradates entitled in Greek pepisteumenos "Privy Councillor", and Kophasates - anearly form of the name Kohzadh. In this sculpture it is clear that Gotarzes was one of the highest royal officers during this reign. The sculpture onthe right shows a scene of equestrian combat, and above the figure of the protagonist is the name Gotarses Geopothros "Gotarzes son ofGev". Herzfeld, who had no knowledge ofan earlier king named Gotarzes, ascribed the second relief to the ruler of that name (mentioned by Tacitus), who occupied the Parthian throne between A.D. 40and 51.
1 Herzfeld, "Sakastan", AMI iv (1931), 101.
2 Since Jenkins, "Indo-Scythic mints", Journ. Num. Soc. India xvn (1955), 2, places this Vonones well before Azes I inthe coin-series, and the Vikrama era of 57 B.C. apparently originated with the commencement of Azes' second reign.

IRAN UNDER THE ARSACIDS
Babylonian tablets which were subsequently brought to notice by Debevoise1 show that from asearly as91 B.C. a second Arsacid ruler, named Gotarzes, was actually in control of Babylonia. At thesame time, the evidence of Josephus shows2 that the Seleucid king Demetrius III Eucaerus, after a civil war with his brother Philip Epiphanes, was taken prisoner by a Parthian force that intervened on the brother's side, and sent toMithradates II. Since the latest coins ofDemetriusIII are dated 88/7 B.C., it therefore appears that Mithradates continued to rule over certain parts of Iran, including apparently Mediaand Mesopotamia, while Gotarzes occupied Babylonia. Subsequently there isevidence that Gotarzes continued torule until 81/80 B.C., when the name of a new ruler, Orodes I, begins to appear on thetablets. It is suggested that Orodes I reigned for a short time as rival to Gotarzes, who thereafter disappears from the record, so that Orodes is likely tohave continued as sole ruler until about 76 B.C., when there is evidence that thenext Arsacid, theelderly Sinatruces, must have been onthe throne.
The attempt hasrecently been made to combine the findings of Debevoise on theArsacid succession during this complicated period with the evidence of the coins.3 Later issues of Mithradates II show the royal portrait with long beard and jewelled tiara. The legends on the reverse read BAIIAEQI BAIIAEQN MErAAOY APIAKOY ET7IOANOYI "[Coin] of Arsaces, Great King of Kings, [divinely] Manifest", or on the final issue BAIIAEQI BAIIAEQN APIAKOY EYEPrETOY AIKAIOY KAI OIAEAAHNOI "[Coin] of Arsaces, King of Kings, the Benefactor, the Just and Philhellenic". These coinsare followed by an issue of a new ruler, whose energetic portrait is crowned with aplain diadem and whose inscription reads BAIIAEQI MEFAAOY APIAKOY GEOnATOPOI EYEPrETOY EniOANOYI OIAEAAHNOI "Arsaces, Great King, son of a deified father, Benefactor, [divinely] Manifest and Philhellenic".
As in thecase of the great majority of Arsacid coin-legendsand inscriptions, as we have already noted, the king is designated merely by the throne-name Arsaces, and the personal name does not appear, so that difficulties arise over hisidentification. Wroth, editor of the British Museum catalogue,4 attributed these diademed issues to a problematical "Artabanus II", in this following aspeculative suggestion

of von Gutschmid.1 Some of these coins with the diadem bear in addition to the usual legends the names ofIranian provinces, such as Traxiane, Margiane, Areia and also Katastrateian. The last term echoes a phrase in a Seleucid inscription of Anatolia,2 TO KOLTCL arpareLav ya£o<f)v\dKLov "the expeditionary treasury", and seems to refer to an itinerant mint and treasury organized to accompany theroyal army on its campaigns. Recently a further legend of the same type, EN PAfAIC "in Ray" has been reported.8As early as 1930 Tarn rejected the attribution ofthese so-called "campaign coins" tothe hypothetical Artabanus II,4 and ascribed them instead, with considerable insight, to an unknown "joint-king" andgeneral of Mithradates whom he regarded as having been entrusted with campaigns against the Sacae in eastern Iran. The weakness ofTarn's attribution lay inthe fact that besides the campaign issues, coins of identical types without the special legends occur in the general Parthian series, and similar tetradrachms are reasonably plentiful. Since numismatists ingeneral accept that (with isolated exceptions) tetradrachms of the Parthian kings were minted only at Seleucia-on-the-Tigris, it follows from this that the mysterious "king of the campaign coins" not merely was a general entrusted with eastern campaigns, but ruled for a time over the entire kingdom, and even had control of Babylonia.
Sellwood therefore has combined the discovery of Debevoise, that a king named Gotarzes ruled theParthian empire between 91 B.C. and 81/80 B.C. with theevidence of the "campaign coins", and so attributes these, and the similar issues with diademed portrait, to Gotarzes. Notonly will thelatter then have established himself in Babylonia in competition with Mithradates II, butthecoins would then also show that he conducted an ambitious campaign into the east of Iran, and reached not only Ray, but even distant Marv and Herat, besides the little-known Traxiane. Thehypothesis of Sellwood is certainly anattractive one, and suggests that the historical role of the first Gotarzes may have been more considerable than was previously realized.5 Plainly anearlier stage of this ruler's career was as Satrapof Satraps onthe left-hand rock-relief at BIsitun. The possibility maybe

considered that the right-hand relief at that site refers also tohim, and not to the later Gotarzes II,asHerzfeld supposed. Atthis point it is true that a problem arises, forthe protagonist ofthe right-hand relief is labelled in Greek Geopothros "Son of Gev", whereas on the coins attributed by Sellwood to Gotarzes I the king is entitled GEOnATOPOI "Son of a deified father", which implies that his father was a ruling Arsacid king. There could have been, however, no Arsacid king called Gev. On the other hand, that section of the Shdh-ndma which coversthe reign of the legendary Kai Kavus narrates substantial episodes con
cerning a certain Godarz1 who has a famous son bythe name of Gev, and whose saga no doubt represents an episode from the Parthian
period.2 Previously it was usual to identify the Godarz of the Shdhndma with theParthian Gotarzes II (A.D. 43/4-50/1). However, the enlarged role which Sellwood's identifications suggest for the first Gotarzes might justify the transfer of thewhole saga to the latter. It must be observed that Le Rider expressed reservations on Sellwood's
transfer ofthe "campaign coins" toGotarzes I.3 The following group, which portrays a ruler with a short beard and jewelled tiara, and of which the legend contains the Greek word AYTOKPATOPOI, Le Rider prefers toattribute to alater ruler, Sinatruces (77 to71 or 70 B.C.), rather than Orodes I (c. 80B.C.) with Sellwood. His reason is that it seems at Susa to contain eight or nine annual issues, while Orodes I would not have reigned solong. On this hypothesis, Le Rider cannot name "the king of the campaign coins", whom heis content to call Arsaces 'Theopator Euergetes. His objections to Sellwood's reconstruction still do notseem, in the present fragmentary state of the evidence, to bewholly decisive.
Whether ornot Orodes I is tobecredited with coins, and whatever the duration of his reign, Orodes I is briefly attested at Babylon by cuneiform tablets. After this reign, dynastic struggles in the Parthian empire were resolved by the return of the eighty-year-old prince
Sinatruces4 from exile among theSacaraucae on theeastern frontier. Despite his age, Sinatruces reigned for afurther seven years. But when, in 72/1 B.C. Mithradates ofPontus requested his help inhis war against the Romans, theaged king was in no position to assist. Hedied in

71 or 70B.C. and was succeeded byhis son Phraates III. To Sinatruces, Sellwood attributes the drachmae with the legend BAIIAECOI MErAAOY APZAKOY GEOTTATOPOI NIKATOPOZ. The portrait wears a long beard, anda tiara decorated with a straight bull's horn, anda line of stags' heads along its ridge. No monogram appears upon this issue, and since it includes no tetradrachms, theimplication seems to be, on this hypothesis, that Sinatruces may nothave controlled, or resided in, Seleucia.1
There is literary evidence that the succeeding ruler, Phraates III, used the title QEOZ " the God ", as ofcourse had several Hellenistic kings before him.2 The numismatic authorities are therefore unanimous inascribing toPhraates the tetradrachms upon which the king wears the tiara decorated with a curved bull's horn, and which bear theGreek legend BAZIAE03Z MErAAOY APZAKOY 0EOY EYEPrETOY ETTIOANOYZ QIAEAAHNOZ-together with corresponding drachms which omit the word 0EOY, anda further series with the same legends upon which the king wears the diadem alone. However, the series mentioned in the previous paragraph, upon which the keytitles are GEOTTATOPOZ NIKATOPOZ, andwhich as we have seen are ascribed by Sellwood to Sinatruces, were regarded byNewell,3 and following him Le Rider, as the first of the issues of Phraates III. The correlation of the Parthian coinage after Mithradates II with the succession of historical rulers thus constitutes a problem of some complexity, to be examined in more detail in chapter 8(a).
It was, however, during the reign of Phraates III (c. 70-58/7 B.C.) that the expanding Roman power in Anatolia first impinged upon Parthia, and Parthian history comes clearly into the purview ofthe Roman historians. The Roman general Lucullus had defeated Mithradates of Pontus and occupied his kingdom, driving Mithradates to take refuge with his son-in-law, Tigranes the Great of Armenia. Lucullus therefore advanced across the highlands of Anatolia, crossing both the Euphrates and the Tigris, and laid siege to Tigranes' new capital, Tigranocerta, in 69 B.C.4 There is a conflict among the Greek and Roman historians as to thelocation of Tigranocerta, traditionally represented as the point of contact between the Armenian kingdom,

and the later Parthian frontier-station at Nisibis. On the one hand, Plutarch and also Pliny1 appear to describe Tigranocerta as situated north of the Tigris and east of Diyarbakr, a location which seems also to besupported bythe Peutinger Table. On the evidence ofthose writers substantial authorities place the city at the medieval site of Miyafarqin, the modern Silvan. Onthe other hand, in the context of the later wars of Corbulo, Tacitus (whoexplicitly links the city with the River Nicephorius) gives the distance from Tigranocerta to Nisibis asexactly thirty-seven miles,2 which suggests a site in the vicinity of Mardin, and an identification of the Nicephorius with the Zergan, a tributary of the Khabur (and ultimately the Euphrates) which passes nearby.3 If the latter location should prove correct, andthesite so near to the Parthian border, a close interest of the Parthian government in events at Tigranocerta is easy to understand.
During the march of Lucullus to Tigranocerta, his opponents Mithradates and Tigranes had written toPhraates IIIseeking assistance. After hisvictory, Lucullus hadentered into correspondence with the Parthian king to dissuade him from intervening. The Parthian replied amicably to both parties, but remained neutral. Lucullus evencontemplated himself launching an expedition against Parthia, but the disaffection of his troops, exhausted after their long campaigns, led him to abandon the scheme. When in 66 B.C. Pompey wassent to supersede Lucullus in command of the Roman armies, he reversed a number of his predecessor's decisions, butsecured anagreement with Phraates to maintain Parthian neutrality as before. Soon afterwards Tigranes the Younger rebelled against his father, and sought refuge with Phraates, whom he persuaded to invade the territory still held by hisfather around his capital of Artaxata, themodern Artashat on the Araxes River near Erevan, a place of course far to the north of the Roman military operations in Lesser Armenia. Phraates laid siege to Artaxata, but when he left the younger Tigranes toconduct operations, the father made a sortie and defeated his son, who fled to Pompey,

and offered his services as a guide for the Roman army thatwas already advancing on Artaxata. However, when Pompey arrived,the elder Tigranes submitted and was restored tohis throne, while the son, who refused toacquiesce ina partition ofthe Armenian kingdom, was put in chains for eventual exhibition at theRoman's triumph. After thus settling matters, Pompey advanced into theCaucasus in pursuit of Mithradates of Pontus. None the less, Phraates sent to demand the return of his young protege, who was hisson-in-law; and proposed that the Euphrates be fixed as the boundary between Parthia and Rome. When Pompey retorted that the young Tigranes was closer kin to his father than to hisfather-in-law (and so would remain), andthat the boundary would be fixed where justice directed, Phraates established his base at Arbela and, taking advantage of Pompey's absence in the north, overran the district ofGordyene on the Tigris below Diyarbakr. He was ultimately dislodged by thelegate Afranius, butwhether by
force or negotiation is left uncertain.1
After this settlement, Pompey returned across Asia Minor to Syria. But apart from a frontier dispute between Phraates and Tigranesthe Great, in which theadjudication of the Romans was requested, the situation in Armenia remained quiet. It is necessary, however, to consider at this point a further numismatic problem which hasa bearing on historical events during the reign ofPhraates III. There are two groups of coins belonging to this general period which are often
attributed to an "Unknown King".2 The first of these groups, consisting of drachms, is unusual because it portrays on the obverse a diademed royal bust shown full face, and thecritical words of the legend are once more GEOnATOPOZ EYEPrETOY, as in thecaseof the presumed Gotarzes. The second ofthe groups shows the diademed head in profile, and the keywords of the legend are now OIAOrTATOPOI EYEPPETOY. It is tempting, in view of the similarities, to
ascribe these groups toGotarzes, and this case has indeed been argued.3 It seems, however, tobe invalidated by the fact that while the drachmae ascribed to Gotarzes bear no monograms, those under discussion here bear monograms similar to others which occur regularly on the Parthian
1 Asnoted byDebevoise, p. 75, it is asserted byDio Cassius xxxvu, 5, that Afranius reoccupied thedistrict without fighting; on theother hand, Plutarch, Pompey 36, claims that Afranius drove out the Parthian king, and pursued him to Arbela.

drachma coinage from Phraates III onwards. From this fact it can reasonably be deduced that theruler of the frontal portrait is in any case noearlier than animmediate predecessor ofPhraates III,and that
he could belater.1 Sellwood, however, has recently deduced from the development of the monograms on these andsubsequent issues that the ruler of these coins should have been a contemporary of Phraates
III.2 Consequently he is led to reassert Wroth's attribution to an "Unknown King" active before 58B.C., and suggests that this could only beanobscure personage, Darius of Media, mentioned by Appian in connection with the campaign of Pompey against Mithradates of
Pontus.3 On this hypothesis it hastherefore tobeaccepted that Darius of Media attained sufficient importance toissue a copious coinage,and apparently to contest the throne with so well-established a ruler as Phraates III.An alternative view, argued byLeRider onthe evidence
of bronze issues from Susa4 would ascribe to Orodes II, oneof the successors of Phraates III, the issues with Philopator; and, while reserving judgment about theissue with frontal portrait andthelegend Theopator, inclines to see this also as an issue either of Orodes II or of his brother and rival MithradatesIII.

THE CAMPAIGN OF CARRHAE
Whether or not, therefore, the existence of an "Unknown King'*, perhaps identical with Darius of Media, be admitted as the contemporary andrival of Phraates III,it is to theendof the latter's reign that we have nowto turn. According to the explicit statement of the
Greek historian Dio Cassius,5 "Phraates wasassassinated byhis sons; Orodes succeeded tothekingdom andexpelled Mithradates hisbrother from the province of Media which he governed. Thelatter fled to Gabinius, and tried to persuade him to assist in effecting his return." The date ofthis episode isplaced intheyear 58/7 B.C. If the expulsion of Mithradates followed quickly on thedeath of the oldking as this passage suggests, it is hardly possible that Mithradates III could have been responsible for the copious coinage with the facing bust, and
1 Le Rider, Suse, p. 393.He may press the evidence too far, on p. 402, by asserting that themonograms necessitate the placing of these coins after those of Phraates III,since, as Sellwood has shown, they could equally well be contemporary.

bearing the monograms which are currently attributed to the Median mints of Ecbatana (Hamadan) andRhagae (Ray).1 To this extent, Sellwood's hypothesis of an earlier pretender active in the same general area seems to find justification, and may even give rise to a suspicion that it was onthis pretender rather than onhis own sons, whose coins of the drachma denomination bear thedutiful epithets Eupator ("Son of a noble father") andPhilopator ("Lover of his father") respectively, that thedeath of Phraates should be blamed. Be that as it may, Gabinius, Roman proconsul of Syria since the beginning ofthe year 57 B.C., at first gave his assistance to the exiled Mithradates, and led a force across the Euphrates inhis support. However, another request for help from the exiled Egyptian king Ptolemy XI Auletes diverted theattention of the Roman general, and Mithradates was left toessay the reconquest ofthe kingdom with whatever forces hecould collect. Nothing daunted, in 55 B.C. the exiled prince did succeed ingaining control ofBabylonia, and occupying and fortifying the city ofSeleucia. He was able to strike a coinage ofthe tetradrachm denomination (peculiar as we have seen to the mint of Seleucia) and, exceptionally, inscribed with hispersonal name.2 But the city was besieged and ultimately taken, towards theend of the year 54B.C., by Surenas, the general of Orodes II,and the coins of Mithradates were overstruck before he had managed toput them into circulation. When the rebel prince surrendered to his brother, hewas executed upon the spot.3
It isinthe light ofthis dynastic struggle, uncertain though someof its details may be, that what is without doubt themost celebrated episode ofParthian history, the destruction ofthe Roman army under Crassus atthe battle ofCarrhae in 53 B.C., has therefore tobe viewed. The interval between the capture ofSeleucia by Surenas and the battle itself is now estimated atlittle more than amatter of weeks.4 Plutarch's account of the motives of Crassus' expedition, coloured as itwas bound to be by theadvantages of hindsight, acquires a more intelligible context when its synchronism with events in Parthia is clearly seen. Crassus had left Rome to assume his command in Syria in November 55 B.C., and atthat time the attempt of Mithradates III upon Babylonia was meeting with some success. The projected Roman expedition was

not to beanunsupported incursion into unknown and hostile territory or, asParthians and later even Romans were torepresent it,asa wanton aggression against an inoffensive ally. It would rather have been seen by Crassus and his party asa judicious move in support of a legitimate candidate for the throne; its aim,to relieve the gallant Mithradates, besieged in Seleucia, and to assist a Roman sympathizer on tothe Parthian throne. Thus at this stage the Roman enterprise wasby no means so rash as later developments were to make it appear. The historical narratives understandably putCrassus in theleast favourable light. Hispreoccupation with financial considerations, acquisitiveness and ambition were no doubt notorious, andof course he was lacking in first-class military experience, particularly of the novel cavalry weapons of the Parthians, and the conditions of steppe warfare. On the other hand, as a prince of Roman industry and finance, he was by no means devoid of ruthlessness and astuteness. His previous career showed his capacity for handling a dangerous enterprise. As long as Mithradates continued to hold outat Seleucia, there might have been no question of a pitched battle. The Roman expedition might have required nothing more than a show of force.
In such circumstances, Plutarch is likely to have been right to blame Crassus for his dilatoriness in spending thelate summer of 54B.C. in occupying and garrisoning the cities of Mesopotamia, and thereafter returning to spend the winter in Syria. Thehistorian stresses that he ought to have gone forward, and strengthened himself with the accession of Babylon and Seleucia, "cities constantly at enmity with the Parthians " - an observation that manifestly implies that Mithradates
was still keeping up the fight.1 Again, when theemissaries of Orodes reproached him for his aggression, theretort of Crassus that he would give hisreply in Seleucia could well have reflected hisexpectation that he would find a favourable situation there. The sources quote the reply of the eldest Parthian ambassador, whoheld out his palm and said, "Hair will grow here before you seeSeleucia." In contrast with thedoomed and pitiful figure of Crassus, thesketch which survives of the Parthian general Surenas is a vivid andspirited one. The name under which he appears in the classical sources was apparently no more than his hereditary title, that of suren, which continues to appear in the record of Iranian history far into Sasanian

times. By one of those tantalizing gaps in the historical record, his personal name is still unknown to us.In all likelihood it is preserved amongst the throng of epic heroes whose deeds are recalled in the Kayanian section of the Shah-ndma. Forthough, in thenational epic, the record of the Arsacids was suppressed at their true chronological point, the instance of Gotarzes has shown that some at least ofits spectacular episodes were transferred to the legendary period of Kai Kavus, and incorporated there. Thefeat of arms performed by Surenas wascertainly the most celebrated of the whole Arsacid era, and could not easily have vanished entirely. Thus in some ways the position of Surenas in the historical tradition is curiously parallel to that of Rustam in the epic. The latter was always represented as the mightiest of Iranian paladins, andthe atmosphere of the episodes in which he features is strongly reminiscent of the Arsacid period. Yet despite thepredominance of Rustam in the epic tradition, it has never been possible to find him a convincingly historical niche. Herzfeld, it is true, has developed the very valid theme ofRustam's eastern Iranian and Saka associations, and drawn a comparison with Gondophares, the later Indo-Parthian conqueror ofTaxila.1 Yet the very fragmentary record does not suggest that the careers ofRustam and of Gondophares were closely parallel, even though both were possibly members of the house of Suren.
Despite possible discrepancies between what is known of their careers, it is likely that the Surenas of Carrhae provides a closer historical analogy with the legend of Rustam. Thepossibility ofan identification can only be tested when progress of archaeological research onArsacid sites provides direct evidence from Iranian sources on this greatest ofArsacid triumphs, sofarknown only from the Greek and Roman tradition; and eventually reveals the personal name of Plutarch's Surenas. Asto hisprowess, thenarrative speaks for itself:2
For Surenas wasno ordinary person; but in fortune, family and honour the first after the king; and inpoint ofcourage and capacity, aswell assize and beauty, superior to theParthians of his time. If he went only on an excursion into the country, hehad a thousand camels to carry his baggage, and two hundred carriages for his concubines. He was attended by athousand heavy-armed horse, andmany more of the light-armed rode before him. Indeed his vassals and slaves made up a body of cavalry little less than

ten thousand. He had the hereditary privilege in hisfamily of puttingthe diadem upon theking's head, when he was crowned. When Orodes was driven from the throne, he restored him; andit was he who conquered for himthe great city of Seleucia, being the first to scale the wall,and beating offthe enemy with his own hand. Though hewas notthen thirty years old, his discernment was strong, and bis counsel esteemed the best.
Such then were the protagonists inthe decisive battle that was about to develop. With regard to the strength of the two armies, that of the Romans was greatly superior in sheer numbers, but ill adapted to the open terrain. According tothe most reliable account, that of Plutarch,1 Crassus commanded aforce ofseven legions, of which the total effective strength was estimated by Tarn at twenty-eight thousand heavy infantrymen.2 Other commentators have given somewhat higher estimates. Inaddition, the Roman force included four thousand cavalry, a quarter of whom were Gaulish troops lent by Julius Caesar; and a similar number of light-armed infantry. Atthe minimum estimate,the army of Crassus would thus have numbered thirty-six thousand men.3 The Parthian force by which they were opposed consisted, as the account shows, of a thousand fully armoured lancers, thecataphracti, who formed the bodyguard ofthe Suren. Nine thousand horse-archers formed the main body, andthebaggage-train of a thousand camels was available to bring upextra stocks of arrows. The entire force was mounted, and highly mobile under desert conditions. At a superficial reckoning, theRoman force may have seemed sufficient for the task in hand. The event showed, however, that in two critical respectsthe Romans hadunderestimated the Parthian horse-archers. Thepower of their arrows to penetrate the legionary armour had not been appreciated, perhaps because the Roman commanders were unaware that thecompound bow which theParthians employed4 was a more powerful weapon than the lighter bows found at that time in Europe. Again, the Romans hadanticipated that the Parthian cavalry would quickly exhaust their stock ofarrows; but the camel train ofthe Suren made it possible for him to bring up stocks of arrows as the quivers of his men were emptied. But for these two miscalculations, the Roman legionary square might have been expected to hold its own against the Parthian cavalry. Yet theheat, and vast distances of the Mesopo

THE CAMPAIGN OF CARRHAE
tamian plain (for the battle took place in June) would have put even the stoutest infantry at a disadvantage. Moreover, the Roman means of retaliation against their adversaries were ineffective, since the range of the Roman javelin was obviously limited, and the Gaulish cavalry relied onfora counter-attack were provided only with short javelins, and were lacking indefensive armour.
Before hismarch began, Crassus had been advised by Artavasdes, king ofArmenia, a Roman ally, to lead his forces through the mountains ofthat country, for the sake ofshelter from the Parthian cavalry. However, he declined this advice, being anxious to incorporate the substantial Roman garrison posted during the previous season in the towns of Mesopotamia. And again, after crossing theEuphrates at Zeugma, he rejected theplan of his legate Cassius, that he should follow the course of the river to Babylonia. Instead Crassus followed the guidance of an Arab chief, whose name is given by Plutarch improbably asAriamnes, but whom other sources name asAcbar or Abgar, and whom commentators have identified as theking of the city of Edessa. This guide, suspected bythe historians of collusion withthe Suren, led the Romans away from the river into the desert, tothe direct proximity ofthe main Parthian force, and, when the battle was imminent, made a pretext to ride away.
At first the Romans prepared to advance to the encounter in extended line. Then Crassus formed the legions into a square, and so advanced to ford theRiver Balissus (Balikh). Contrary to theopinion of his officers, hedecided not to camp bythe water, but hurried the troops across, andbefore long came in sight of the advance-guard of the Parthians. The strength of their main body was at first concealed. Then thethunder of drums burst on theears of the Romans.The mailed cavalry ofthe Suren's bodyguard uncovered their armour, and the sun glittered ontheir helmets of "Margian" steel-an expression which no doubt testifies that the cataphracts were Saka tribesmen recruited on theeastern frontier of the Parthian kingdom. The first attack was a charge bythe lancers ofthe bodyguard, led inperson by the towering figure of the Suren. Then, seeing thesteadiness of the Roman legionaries, whose main advantage lay in hand-to-hand fighting, the cataphracts drew back, and thehorse-archers began their work. What followed was more like a massacre than a battle. Asoften, the Romans had tried to remedy their weakness in cavalry byusing light infantry mixed with their Gaulish horsemen. But such makeshift
53



IRAN UNDER THE ARSACIDS
tactics were oflittle avail against the finest cavalry in Asia. The legionaries were soon hard pressed andall but surrounded, so that Crassus was reduced to ordering his son, Publius, who commanded one of the wings, to attempt a charge with his force, and so perhaps create a diversion.
The force which theyoung Crassus ledinto theattack consisted of thirteen hundred horse, five hundred archers, and eight cohorts of the infantry, the latter totalling some four thousand men. At first the Parthians retired in front of them; but when they were separated from the main force they were quickly surrounded, offering an allbuthelpless mark tothe rain ofarrows. The threat ofa charge by the cataphracts forced the Romans into close order, and thereby reduced their chances of escape. Though the Gauls caught hold of the Parthian lances to pull down the riders, and ran under the horses of their enemies to stab them in the belly, these were nomore than tactics of desperation. Soon the young Crassus was disabled, andtheremnant of his force retired to a mound to make their last stand. The young commander ordered his armour-bearer to end his life, and only five hundred of his soldiers survived to betaken prisoner.
This agonizing diversion hadtemporarily relieved pressure on the main Roman force. Butthe magnitude of their disaster became clear when theParthians rode back with thehead of Publius Crassus on a spear. Thereafter the main body had to defend themselves asbest they could for therest of the day under theconstant hail of missiles. Only when it grew too dark to shoot did the Parthians draw off, leavingthe Romans to pass a melancholy night, encumbered as they were with wounded, and anticipating their final destruction on the following morning. Bythis time theelder Crassus was prostrated with despair. But Octavius and Cassius, his lieutenants, resolved that their only hope was to escape under cover of darkness, andseek shelter behind the walls of the city of Carrhae. Thus they slipped away silently from their camp in the darkness; butthose of the wounded who could be moved obstructed their march, and the majority, who had to be abandoned, raised the alarm with their cries. Understandably, retreating in the dark, the Roman column fell into disorder. But a party of cavalry reached the city at midnight, and warned Coponius, commander of the garrison there, merely that Crassus hadfought a great battle with the Parthians, before turning west to make their escape across the Euphrates. Another detachment of two thousand under the Roman

THE CAMPAIGN OF CARRHAE
officer Varguntius lost their way in the dark, and were found bythe Parthians in the morning established ona hill. Ofthese, only twenty made their escape. But at Carrhae, Coponius suspected a mishap, and called his men toarms. Then he marched out, and conducted Crassus and the main body into the city. There were no supplies in Carrhae for standing a long siege, nor hope of relief from theoutside, since Crassus had concentrated for his army allthe forces in the Roman East. The Roman commander therefore determined tobreak out on the second night, and make his way to safety in theshelter of the Armenian hills. Once again,his guide, Andromachus, was a Parthian sympathizer, who indeed was later rewarded after the expulsion of the Romans with the governorship of the city. It issaid that he misled the Roman column inthe dark,so that by dawn the main body was over a mile from the shelter of the hills. The quaestor Cassius, with five hundred horsemen, suspecting a subterfuge, turned back to Carrhae and later escaped bya different route to Syria. Octavius, another of the Roman officers, had reliable guides and gained the shelter ofthe mountains. Atdaybreak, Crassus and his force had occupied aspur connected by alow ridge to the main mountain range. When they came under attack, Octavius and his men moved down from the heights to their support. Atthis moment the Suren rode forward to offer aparley over terms of peace. Itis not clear whether Crassus accepted voluntarily, or under pressure from his men. But he and Octavius, with a small group, went down to meetthe Parthians, who mounted Crassus upon a horse, to take him away for the signing of the treaty. Octavius, suspecting foul play, seizedthe bridle ofthe horse, and, when a scuffle broke out, drew his sword.In the melee that followed, all the Romans in the party were slain; and their leaderless troops either surrendered or scattered, though very few were successful inmaking good their escape. Of the entire force, twenty thousand are said tohave been killed; ten thousand were captured, and deported to distant Margiana. Thus ended the disastrous Roman campaign ofCarrhae.
The upshot ofthe debacle was towin unquestioned recognition for Parthia as a world power equal, if not superior, to Rome. The Euphrates was firmly established asthe boundary between the two. Atthe same time, while the army of the Suren had been sent forward to oppose the Romans inMesopotamia, the main Parthian force, including the bulk of their infantry, had been led bythe king Orodes into Armenia, to
55



IRAN UNDER THE ARSACIDS
lever the Armenian king Artavasdes away from the Roman alliance. In this enterprise, Orodes was successful. He was able to bring the Armenian monarch to terms, and analliance was sealed bythe arrangement ofa marriage between his son Pacorus and the sister ofthat king. Thus was confirmed the long and close connection between the Arsacid dynasty and thekingdom of Armenia, which remained thelast stronghold of the Arsacids even after therise of the Sasanians in Iran. While the two courts, all connoisseurs of Greek literature, were diverting themselves bywatching a performance of the Bacchae of Euripides,the commander Silaces brought in the news of the victory, and laid the head of Crassus at Orodes' feet. Thegruesome trophy wastaken up by theproducer of the play, who took it on to thestage and exhibited it to the company in place of the head of Pentheus, which is carried by theheroine in thetragedy. The Roman east was nowdevoid of troops, andtheway open for Parthian raiding parties to penetrate into Syria. At the same time, Parthian influence began to grow among theJews of Judaea, who had long maintained links with their co-religionists in Babylonia under Parthian rule; and who now saw in the rising power of Parthia a possible counterpoise to Roman domination. An anti-Roman party took shape under Aristobulus, but their attempt to revolt was soon suppressed by the Roman governor Cassius, who marched hastily down from Syria. In the following year, 51 B.C., a more substantial Parthian force under the young prince Pacorus, supported bythe veteran general Osaces, made their way across the Euphrates, and began to raid thesuburbs and villas of Antioch. They were caught by Cassius in an ambush near Antigonea, in which Osaces wasmortally wounded. After this the Parthians withdrew into northern Syria,and attempted no invasion of Roman territory in the following summer. In theRoman civil warwhich followed between Pompey andCaesar, the Parthians made nomove, butmaintained relations with the former. After his defeat and death, a force under Pacorus came to the aid of the Pompeian general Q. Caecilius Bassus, who wasbesieged at Apamea in theOrontes valley by theCaesarian forces. They were successful in raising thesiege, butdidnot remain.
Caesar made elaborate plans after hissupremacy was established for a campaign against Parthia. Troops were drafted to the East, and the route chosen for theexpedition was byway of Lesser Armenia. However, Caesar's assassination in44 B.C. averted the war, and the outbreak

THE CAMPAIGN OF CARRHAE
of the Roman civil war found Parthian cavalry on the side of the republicans in their defeat at the battle of Philippi (42 B.C.).
Quintus Labienus, an officer of Brutus and Cassius, had been sent to Parthia forreinforcements, to aid the republican cause. When after the defeat helearned that republican supporters had been condemned under the proscriptions, he joined the Parthians; andin 40 B.C. a Parthian army, under thecommand of the Parthian prince Pacorus and ofLabienus, invaded Syria. Apamea was quickly taken, and there the invading force divided. Labienus turned north to penetrate far into Asia Minor. Atthe same time Pacorus, who had already gained a high reputation in the Near East both forhis military talent and for justice and moderation, turned south along thecoast through Syria, while hisgeneral Barzapharnes ledanother force further inland.All the cities of the coast, as far to thesouthward as Ptolemais (Acre), admitted the Parthians, with the single exception of Tyre. In Judaea the leader of the pro-Parthian party was Antigonus, nephew of the High Priest Hyrcanus. The latter was inturn under the control oftwo Roman supporters, the Idumaeans Phasael and Herod. Antigonus sent a large subsidy to the Parthian prince, in return for military help to gain control ofthe province. The combined Jewish and Parthian force defeated their opponents and advanced on Jerusalem. When Hyrcanus and Phasael were persuaded to go down and negotiate with Barzapharnes they were taken into custody. Herod, hearing of their arrest, fled to his impregnable stronghold ofMasada near the Dead Sea. Thus Antigonus was installed as king of Judaea, while thetwo prisoners were carried away to Parthia. For a moment, the whole ofthe Roman East seemed to be either inParthian hands, oron the point ofcapture. Yet though connections between the Jews ofJudaea and the Parthian empire, more especially through the Jews of Babylonia, were long to remain an important political factor, the conclusion of the second Roman civil war was soon tobring about a revival ofRoman strength in Asia.
Antony, at that time the most powerful of the Roman generals, had already sent Publius Ventidius into Anatolia to oppose Labienus. Soon Labienus was driven back into Syria, and though his Parthian allies came to hissupport, they were caught at a disadvantage in the hill country byVentidius and heavily defeated. When Labienus tried to escape his men were ambushed andhimself taken prisoner soon afterwards and put todeath. At the Amanus Gates between Cilicia and

Syria, theParthian officer Pharnapates, after a fierce fight, was defeated and slain with most of his men. Late in 39B.C., the Parthian crown prince Pacorus withdrew from Syria, and Ventidius was occupied in trying toreduce thecities that still remained pro-Parthian, but though he approached Jerusalem, didnotattack it.
In thefollowing spring, 38B.C., Pacorus reassembled hisforces and once more invaded Syria. The legions ofVentidius were still in winter quarters in Cappadocia, but the Roman general circulated misleading rumours about his plans, and thus delayed the Parthian advance. Finally the two armies met near Gindarus, tothenorth-east of Antioch. The Roman camp was situated on high ground, buttheParthians, believing the Roman forces to beweak, attempted to rush the camp. They were repelled with heavy losses, and though the Greek and Roman historians differ as to the exact course of the battle, Pacorus withhis bodyguard was trapped and killed, andthe remaining Parthians were dispersed, and driven back across the Euphrates. Pacorus hadbeen a prince of outstanding merit andreputation. As successor-designate to the Parthian throne, he hadeven been permitted tomake sparse issues of coins bearing hisyouthful portrait.1 Hisdeath was notonly a bitter blow to his father Orodes; by throwing open once more the question of the Parthian succession, it introduced a new source of dissension into the affairs ofthe kingdom. Orodes selected next ashis heir Phraates (IV), whoassumed effective power in 39/8B.C. Soon afterwards, the aged king died, according to the historian DioCassius2 ofgrief at his favourite son's death, or of old age. Plutarch3 prefers a lurid tale ascribing to Phraates IVthe murder ofhis father. Thenewking was, at anyrate, obliged to secure his succession—by putting to death his brothers anddriving into exile numbers of their supporters and other opponents of his rule. One of these, Monaeses, who hadgained a military reputation during therecent war, took refuge with Antony in Syria, and encouraged him to undertake a campaign against Parthia. Meanwhile, Antony had reconquered Jerusalem, and executed the Parthian nominee Antigonus, sothat Herod now ascended the throne of Judaea.

The force with which theRoman triumvir planned theinvasion of Parthia is variously estimated at between sixteen and thirteen legions, or more than double the ill-fated force of Crassus. Ifthe larger figure be

accepted, the total numbers would have amounted to sixty thousand Roman legionaries, with tenthousand Iberian andCeltic cavalry,and thirty thousand Asiatic allies, an enormous force for this period.The Roman army marched uptheEuphrates to Carana, plausibly identified with Karln-katak, the modern Erzerum. Here Artavasdes, king of Armenia, joined the Romans with a force of six thousand armoured cavalry, andseven thousand foot. The most substantial description of the campaign is that in Plutarch's Life of Antony, but theaccount of
Dio Cassius1 adds some colourful details, and several points in the
brief versions of Velleius Paterculus2 and Florus,8 deriving probably from thelost book cxxx of Livy, provide critical control of the narrative. Theprincipal source for all these versions wasprobably the account of Quintus Dellius, a Roman officer whotook part inthe expedition, andwhose descriptions of the terrain arealso mentioned
by Strabo.4
Antony, "leaving Armenia onhisleft" (that is to say, passing south of the region of its capital Artaxata, which laynorth of the Araxes), struck into Atropatene. His route wasin all probability that of the plain which leads from Khuy to Marand. Since the siege-train, containing the eighty-foot ramon which he depended to reduce the walled cities, could not keep pace, he left it to follow under the escort of Oppius Statianus with two legions. The main body pressed on rapidly
towards the capital city of Atropatene, named Phraata or Praaspa,5 where thewives andchildren of Artavasdes, thelocal king, resided, and which was strongly fortified and garrisoned. Shortly we shall return to thegeographical problems of the campaign, and the identification of its principal city.
Meanwhile, the main Parthian force appeared under the personal command of the king Phraates, and descending onthe slowly moving siege-train, wiped out its escort and destroyed the engines. By the time Antony had come to the rescue with reinforcements, only the shocking sight of tenthousand corpses remained. This initial reverse gravely prejudiced the Roman plan. On the onehand their ally, the Armenian Artavasdes, withdrew in alarm from thecampaign with his indispensable cavalry. On the other, the Romans were deprived of machinery to assail the walls of Phraata, since timber to replace the lost equipment was lacking in the area. Their only hope ofcarryingthe city lay inthe tedious expedient ofthrowing up mounds ofearth against

the walls. Torestore thespirit of the legionaries, Antony led outthe main force often infantry legions to offer battle to the Parthians. Bya skilful manoeuvre, the Roman commander marched his infantry back across the Parthian front, where the horse-archers were drawn up in a crescent. The Parthians were impressed by thediscipline andsilence of the Roman troops asthey passed at regular intervals, but imagined that their intention was toretire rather than toattack. Then the Gallic cavalry came onat full speed, and assoon asthe attention of the Parthians had been diverted intheir direction, the legionaries also charged, and engaged atclose quarters. The Parthian cavalry were put toflight. The legionaries maintained the pursuit fora distance of five miles, and the Gallic cavalry kept it upfornearly fifteen. Yet, when the Romans came tocount the Parthian losses, they found that no more than eighty Parthians had been slain and thirty captured, damage that was trivial by comparison with their own losses inthe previous encounter. When,
on the following day, they marched back to their position at Phraata,1 the horse-archers regrouped to harry them, and it waswith great difficulty that theretreat was finally accomplished.
As the siege dragged on,both sides became increasingly uneasy. Antony wasapprehensive because of the shortage of supplies,and found that it wasimpossible to send out foraging parties without incurring heavy losses. The Parthian king, Phraates, was anxious lest with theonset of the Azarbaijan winter, thefeudal levies that made up the bulk of his force would return to warmer levels, and he would be left with inadequate strength to sustain thecampaign. The Parthian troopers were instructed to parley with the Roman outposts, and inspire in them hopes of concluding a truce. Finally, Antony sent an official delegation to negotiate with the king. TheArsacid rejected their now conventional request for the return of the standardsand prisoners captured at Carrhae, but letthem understand that a Roman withdrawal would not beopposed. The emissaries were none the less dismayed at the king's haughty manner, and heis vividly described as receiving them seated on a golden throne, and twanging impatiently at
his bowstring,2 exactly asthe Parthian king is depicted onthe Arsacid coinage. Nevertheless, as a result of this interview, Antony decided that the safest course would beto withdraw.
At this point in thestory, an eminent modern commentator gives
prominence to therole of the Parthian general Monaeses.3 We have

MARK ANTONY IN AZARBAljAN
seen that he fled, early in the reign of Phraates IV, to take refuge in Roman Syria, where Antony allotted to his upkeep the revenue of several towns. Shortly before thedeparture of the Roman army for Armenia, Phraates "sent to Monaeses a right hand"1 in token of amnesty. The picturesque and traditional Iranian ceremony re-enacts one that had taken place several centuries earlier, when the Achaemenian king Artaxerxes II issued a guarantee ofimmunity to his general Datames.2 Monaeses then returned, with theapproval of Antony, to the Parthian court. Yet while the Roman general is represented at that time as supposing that Monaeses would not only lay before the king his earlier request forthe return of the standards, but would actually assist in misleading him over theRoman plans, some commentators maintain that Monaeses had all along been acting in the Parthian interest, and reported toPhraates all the details ofthe Roman military preparations. The several narratives make it clear that Phraateswas present in person during the subsequent campaign in Atropatene, which we have just described. Although he did not go into battle personally, it is difficult to doubt that heexercised the supreme command. What is known of his stern disposition surely suggests that his was the plan to wipe out the Roman force as that of Crassus had been destroyed at Carrhae. Monaeses, it is true, must also have held a command, but it is difficult to believe that hisattitude to his former benefactor Antony was equally ruthless. Though there is no need to doubt that the sympathies of the former exile were with his own countrymen, hewas rather the victim of circumstances than a conspirator on either side, andwould probably have been content with the mere withdrawal ofthe Romans. Plutarch thus reports that it was his emissary Mithradates who warned the Romans of an impending ambush, and ona second occasion helped them to find a way of escape.
The figure who played at this point a prominent part in the story of the Roman escape was theguide described in Plutarch's text as a Mardian (Latin "Mardus"). TheMardians were in fact an Iranian mountain tribe occupying anarea ofthe Alburz Range,3 and it is hard to understand how the Roman general could have entrusted the safety of his army to a Parthian subject, or what such a tribesman would

have gained byassisting the enemy. The two Latin authors whose version of the events apparently derives from the lost book cxxx of Livy, and so may stand nearer to theoriginal source than does the account of Plutarch, maintain that the providential well-wisher was a survivor from the defeat of Crassus, who came at night andin Parthian dress to theRoman lines, andby greeting theguards in Latin,1 won their confidence. According to this account, thepurpose of the guidewas to escape himself, and return to his Italian home. This form of the story certainly seems more plausible, and gives special point to the guide's constant warnings to the Roman general that if he exposedhis legions to the cavalry on level ground he would share the fate of Crassus - a direct reminiscence of the man's own experience. Editors have suggested that the true reading ofthe word inthe text of Plutarch should be "Marsus", and the mana member of the central Italian tribe which would naturally have been represented in the army of Crassus. Thus the words which occur in the famous ode of Horace - 2
Consenuit socerorum in armis sub rege Medo Marsus et Apulus would show that this prisoner hadtaken a Median wife, and would constitute an allusion tothis very man. Since Horace would have known the Latin narrative of the expedition by Dellius, this seems a very convincing explanation. It has, however, also been suggested that the true reading should be "Margus", a reference to thefact that Roman prisoners hadbeen settled in the eastern province of Margiana.
Whatever his origin, this providentially acquired guide certainly played a great part in securing theescape of the Roman force. For he urged Antony to return by a different andmountainous route, along which theParthian cavalry would be at a disadvantage. On the fifth day of the exhausting march, a Roman officer, Flavius Gallus, rashly led out a large detachment oflight-armed troops to attack the Parthian cavalry. He became separated from the main body and was quickly surrounded. In theensuing action to effect hisrescue, no fewer than three thousand Roman soldiers were killed and five thousand wounded, while Flavius himself died of his wounds. After this reverse, the hardpressed Romans observed greater caution, and continued their march in the regular formation of a square, andwith slingers and javelin-men

guarding the flanks and rear. On one occasion when nearly overwhelmed by assaults of the horse-archers, theRomans were reduced to adopting their celebrated "tortoise" formation, in which the front ranks knelt, and those behind protected them byholding their shields above their heads. The Parthians, thinking that they had become exhausted, came to close quarters, but the Romans leapt up and counter-attacked, inflicting some casualties and putting the rest to flight. Thus the agonizing retreat continued towards the Armenian border. The Romans had to endure one terrible night without water, when discipline began to fail, and even the tableware of the general's kitchen was plundered. After crossing a river ofbrackish and undrinkable water, the march was kept up until daybreak, and soon afterwards a river offresh water was reached, after which the Parthians abandoned their pursuit.
One of the most interesting questions raised by this narrativehas been the explanation ofits geography. As we have seen, all commentators arefairly well agreed that theRoman army entered Atropatene (Azarbaijan) by way of the plain of Marand, andpassed round the eastern shore of the Urmlya Lake. In a famous article written many years ago,1 the celebrated scholar and soldier Sir Henry Rawlinson argued that the city besieged bythe Romans lay at the archaeological site of Takht-i Sulaiman, which has in recent years become the siteof an important series ofexcavations conducted bythe German Archaeological Mission in Iran.2 Another view of the problem was, however, presented bythe late Professor Minorsky,3 who maintained that there was no room within the relatively restricted circuit of the walls at Takht-i Sulaiman for such a considerable town as the Phraata of Plutarch,4 and moreover that it would scarcely have been feasible for Antony's predominantly infantry force to push forward so deep into enemy territory as to reach the Takht.5 A further argument in favour of Minorsky's view, though not available to him at the time thathis article was written, is that the subsequent campaigns of excavation at

Takht-i Sulaiman have still not given clear confirmation of the existence there of any significant Parthian remains, and tend to support Minorsky's opinion that the fire-temple was established no earlier than thereign of the Sasanian Khusrau Anushirvan (A.D. 531-79). Accordingly, Minorsky places the city besieged by Antony inthe vicinity ofmodern Maragha, and finds confirmation ofthis theory inthe statement of the Arab historian al-Baladhuri that the pre-Muslim name ofMaragha was
Afrah-rodh,1 a name which hecompares with the Phraata of Plutarch, and which suggests that the latter reading is superior to the name Praaspa given by Dio Cassius. Minorsky is inagreement with Rawlinson that in its retreat theRoman army must have moved eastwards out ofMaragha, and around the eastern side ofMount Sahand towards the plain ofTabriz. The brackish river, onthis hypothesis, is the river of Tabriz, called AjiChai in itsupper reaches, and in the neighbourhood of the city marked on maps as Talkharud, the"Bitter River". In Rawlinson's own words it is "the salt stream of the Aji, theonly
river of this nature, I believe, in the whole of Azerbijan".2 From this crossing Rawlinson believed that the Romans continued to march along the plain of Tabriz north-westwards towards Marand, and that the fresh river at which their sufferings ceased wasthe "Saliya or Savala Chay", corrected by Minorsky to Savalan Chai, some fifteen miles across the plain. Yet since according tothe narrative ofPlutarch, the route between the two rivers was rocky and precipitous, andthe whole purpose ofthe Roman general was to avoid the plain, one may suggest that the route could rather have been over the Gaija Bel pass between Tabriz andAhar, andthat the Romans could have finally escaped pursuit oncrossing the Ahar Chai. From this point, their sixday march to theAraxes would have presented little difficulty. Thus the expedition made its way back into Armenia, having lost, according to Plutarch, twenty thousand infantry and four thousand cavalry, besides afurther eight thousand men inthe long winter march through Armenia back to their quarters in Syria.
Despite the Parthian king's triumphant expulsion of the Roman invaders from histerritory, hisharsh disposition quickly gave rise to dissension among his own subjects. A dispute with thevery ally in whose defence heled the Parthian armies into Atropatene, Artavasdes of Media, made the latter soapprehensive forhis safety that he even
sent emissaries to Antony to ask for analliance.3 The proconsul was

delighted at the opportunity so afforded to pay offhis grudge against the Armenian Artavasdes, to whose irresolution if not positive defection many were content to ascribe the Roman disaster in Atropatene. Thus strengthened, Antony once more mobilized an army, and in 34 B.C. again marched into Armenia, ostensibly to arrange a marriage with the daughter of Artavasdes forAlexander, hisson by Cleopatra. When the hapless Armenian visited theRoman camp hewas arrested and put in irons, perhaps onsuspicion of contacts with Octavian.His son Artaxes was driven out ofthe country, totake refuge with Phraates, while Antony left a garrison in Armenia, and carried Artavasdes back with him to Egypt, where hewas put to death. In 33 B.C. Antony was again inArmenia, contracting an alliance with the Median king against both Octavian and the Parthians. Soon afterwards Artaxes and the Parthians returned, but eventually other preoccupations obliged Antony to withdraw, and the whole region passed under Parthian control.
The death of Antony in Egypt after his defeat at Actium in 31 B.C. left Octavian, soon to beknown as the emperor Augustus, undisputed master of the Roman world. Hewas in a strong position to achieve an amicable relationship with Phraates, since Antony hadbeen their common enemy. To this factor may be added the new ruler's diplomatic skill, and the fortunate accident which gave him a bargaining counter. The Parthian king returned victorious tohis capital, but by his haughtiness aroused the anger of the populace, and was driven into exileby a sudden rising. He visited more than one of the neighbouring states, but it was finally from certain Scythians that heobtained the reinforcements to reclaim his throne. During his enforced absence, a certain Tiridates, perhaps the general mentioned ina Greek poem from Susa,1 seized power during 30/29 B.C. When the Scythians approached, Tiridates fled with his supporters to Augustus, taking with him as hostage theyoungest of Phraates' sons, who had somehow been kidnapped from his guards.2
Justin's version3 narrates the abduction of the boy as anepisode of Tiridates' first exile, but his statement that the refugee and his hostage came to Augustus in Spain connects the event with the second expulsion of Tiridates.

prince, but the reference might also allude to the subsequent exileof Phraataces (below, p. 68).
Envoys from Phraates soon arrived todemand thereturn of his son, and the surrender ofthe rebel. Augustus then diplomatically accepted the first demand, butrefused either to return Tiridates, oron the other hand to support his pretensions to the Parthian throne. However, it seems that Tiridates soon found his wayacross the Parthian frontier for another attempt, andhe struck tetradrachms again in Seleucia, bearing theexceptional epithet Philorhomaios "Friend ofthe Romans" in May 26 B.C. It is apparently to the period of this episode that we should refer the cryptic notice in Isidore of Charax1 concerning a treasury of Phraates onanisland in the Euphrates below Dura, and of the Arsacid having puttodeath hisconcubines (not explicitly at the same spot, as some commentators assume), seemingly to avoid their capture bythe pretender. Coins show none the less that Phraateswas back in power during August 26 B.C.,but Tiridates made a final appearance in March 25 B.C.before he finally disappears from the historical record.2
THE "ROMAN PEACE" AND ITS CONSEQUENCES
Meanwhile, for Roman popular opinion, memory of the defeats under Antony and Crassus wasthe ruling obsession, and indeed was long to remain so, an attitude which prompted repeated Roman attempts to invade Parthia on later occasions. Augustus was fully aware of the political prestige to begained from a favourable settlement, buthisgrowing concentration oftroops inSyria may have been intended chiefly for propaganda effect. Finally, however, in 20 B.C. after prolonged negotiations the desired.result wasachieved, an outstanding success for Augustus' characteristic policy of conciliation, and Phraates formally returned the lost Roman standards and the surviving Roman prisoners. The event was immediately commemorated onRoman coinage from Syria to Spain.3 From theviewpoint of Augustus this settlement, achieved wholly without bloodshed or indeed military operations, and almost without expense, gave enormous propaganda benefit, and could be represented as a redressing of the military balance so disastrously upset bythe previous costly failures. From that ofPhraates andtheParthians, theconcessions made were a

mere formality, a trifling return for the restoration of the kidnapped prince, and an inexpensive insurance premium against the possible damage of another Roman invasion. Thus both sides were easily able to escape from theshackles of their own military propaganda, andlay the foundations of a comparatively stable peace, the Pax Romana. The outcome was at once a tribute to thepatience andjudicious foresight
characteristic of Augustus as a policy-maker,1 to the favourable historical circumstances already noticed which for once made possible a degree of personal confidence between themonarchs of antagonistic powers, and indeed to the firm, and at times ruthless, determination of Phraates IVto uphold the integrity of his kingdom even in the face of the wealthiest and most effectively organized of the ancient world's military powers.
If indeed Phraates IVis rightly to beidentified with theArsaces of the second Avroman parchment, and its date 291to be referred to the Seleucid era, in 21/20 B.C., notwithstanding the harem tragedy recorded by Isidore, four ofthe Arsacid's queens were living, Olenieire,
Cleopatra, Baseirta and Bistheibanaps.2 This fact did not deter Augustus from pursuing his Parthian policy bythe gentler method of bestowing upon Phraates anItalian slave-girl ofunusual accomplishments, known
as Thea Musa.3 Whether the gesture wasexplicitly by wayof compensation for theArsacid's previous losses is a matter for conjecture, but Musa quickly became the favourite of the fierce old king, and before long gave birth to a sonknown as Phraataces (the diminutive form of the king's own name), or by other authorities designated as Phraates (V). The infant prince was soon regarded as a candidate for the succession, andMusa, who now as acknowledged queen achieved a position of great influence at thecourt, persuaded theking to send his older children to Rome, andthus leave theway clear for herson. As Phraates may well have perceived, thearrangement was advantageous also from another viewpoint. For if Phraataces with thehelp of his mother was to inherit thethrone, hishalf-brothers would be safer if they resided outside his jurisdiction. Having therefore called to a conference Marcus Titius, the Roman governor of Syria, the king handed over to him hisfour sons, Seraspadanes, Rhodaspes, Phraates

and Vonones, together with the wives ofthe two last, and their four
sons.1 Allthese princes were maintained by Augustus at Rome in princely style, and in due course Vonones was to make a bid forthe
succession. They are mentioned in several Latin inscriptions,2 and their presence isreported with pride by Augustus inthe ResGestae? In 2 B.C., when the aged Phraates IVwas nodoubt already ailing, Musa isreported tohave had him taken off by poison, thus smoothing the succession of her son Phraataces. Subsequently Josephus reports that the mother became the consort ofthe son, anevent which some authorities regard thecoin of A.D. 2 (bearing thetwo portraits) as confirming. It isnot clear whether this alliance, if such it was, should be regarded asanearly instance ofZoroastrian kin-marriage; but the assumption is contradicted bythe fact that the historian ascribed the subsequent Parthian rebellion against thenew king partly to their
detestation of such incest.4 The new king was driven from the throne in A.D. 4, and himself fled to Roman Syria, where he didnot long survive.
This upheaval constituted the prelude to a long period of dynastic conflict in the Parthian kingdom. A prince called Orodes (III) was called to the throne; but his violent disposition, no exception in these troubled times, ledto hisbeing cutdown by thenobles at a banquet, or, in another version, on a hunting party. Envoys were then sent to Rome toask forthe release ofone ofthe hostages to occupy the throne, andVonones wasselected. However, the patronizing Roman propaganda onthe theme Rex Parthis datus "a king assigned
to the Parthians "5 seems to have aroused the anger ofthe Parthians, who once more rebelled, and set upagainst Vonones a certain Artabanus, who hadformerly been king of Atropatene, andwho now advanced towards Ctesiphon, the capital. Vonones opposed him near the entrance to the Zagros passes, and at their first encounter won a victory, which gave rise to the famous, butpremature, coin-issue inscribed BAIIAEYI ONQNHI NIKHIAI APTABANON "King
Vonones victorious over Artabanus".6 However, in thesecondencounter Artabanus (III) gained theupper hand, and while hisrival

took shelter inSeleucia, advanced to be proclaimed as king at Ctesiphon in A.D. 12. Vonones then escaped to Armenia, where he manoeuvred to secure the throne, but inA.D. 15/16 the Romans decided that he was an unsafe nominee, both owing to the hostility of Artabanus, and because of his own irresolution; so theunhappy prince was obliged to take sanctuary with Creticus Silanus, governor of Syria, by whom he was granted shelter and royal honours.
In A.D. 14theRoman emperor Augustus died, and was succeeded by his adopted son, Tiberius, who sent the young Germanicus to settle affairs in Armenia and on the Parthian frontier. To reduce the possibility of provocation to Artabanus, Vonones was removed to Pompeiopolis (Soli) in Cilicia. Heescaped bybribing hisguard, and tried to flee to Georgia, but was arrested on the river Pyramus (Ceyhan), and run through by his guilty custodian, who hoped thus toefface the evidence of his own complicity.
The death of Vonones was followed by that of Germanicus,and during theperiod A.D. 19-32 tranquillity prevailed on the Euphrates frontier. Artabanus remained firmly in control of the Parthian kingdom, and hisfamous rescript in Greek to themunicipality of Susa, dated Arsacid Era 268/December A.D. 21, wasto remain the last known inscription ofits type.1 To the same period belongs the narrative given by Josephus2 of a signal disaster that befell theJewish population in Babylonia. It provides an instructive commentary on the extent of local autonomy that prevailed in theParthian kingdom at this time. The city of Nearda, because of its secure position in a bend of the Euphrates, was selected by the community of the Exile as the repository of their traditional offerings oftwo drachmae a head forthe Temple at Jerusalem. It happened that two Jewish youths ofthat town, Asinaeus and Anilaeus, apprenticed to a weaver, being maltreated by their master took weapons and fled to theswamps at the"Parting of the Rivers".
At this point some words of commentary areneeded on thegeographical situation. TheGreek words just quoted suggest a Greek translation of the Aramaic term Pallugtha "the Canal Regulator", a term which has given its name to themodern township of Falluja in western Iraq, where the Euphrates divided at certain periods of antiquity; and also to thecanal system known to classical authors as

Pallacottas, which here diverged westwards from theoriginal rivercourse, and ofwhich the bed is today followed by the main streamof the Euphrates. The town mentioned byJosephus as Nearda appears in the Babylonian Talmud as Neharde'a, repeatedly named as one of the main centres of the Jewish exile. The site has not been positively located on the ground, but there arefairly close indications of its general position. Ptolemy places Naarda immediately upstream of Sippar.1 Inthe Babylonian Talmud it appears asone ofthe last settlements ofBabylonia on the road to Syria, and was enclosed not only by the Euphrates butalso by a reach of the celebrated Royal Canal.2 That channel, in Aramaic Nehar Malka, carried water eastwards from the Euphrates to irrigate areas round Seleucia and discharge into the Tigris. A problem is that owing to realignments of the canals,the divergence of the Royal Canal varied at different periods. According to Isidore of Charax, the Royal Canal diverged at a point below Besechana, butthedistance given in histext is evidently excessive, and is usually corrected by hiscommentators to 12 schoenae or parasangs.3 The location ofBesechana itself is anyway fixed, since the town is identical with that known later to theSasanians as Peroz-Shapur,4 and to the Arabs asal-Anbar, ofwhich the extensive ruins have been reported a mile orso north ofFalluja. The geographer ofthe 'Abbasid period, IbnSerapion, places thedivergence of the Royal Canal ata point somewhat less than eight parasangs, ortwenty-four miles, downstream of Peroz-Shapur,5 and this indication would give a suitable position forNeharde'a. Onthe other hand, two writers of the intervening period, Pliny and Ammianus Marcellinus, regarded the channel which diverged from the Euphrates above Peroz-Shapur - that known in Islamic times as the Nahr 'Isa, or atthe present day as the Saqlawiya Canal - as the authentic start of the Royal Canal. On their interpretation Neharde'a would have to be sought at, or near, the site of al-Anbar; and this was the theory adopted by the medieval traveller Benjamin of Tudela, who refers to"El-anbar, which isPumbeditha in Nehardea".6

THE "ROMAN PEACE"
We are not concerned here with this localization of Pumbeditha, another important Jewish settlement during the Parthian period.1 It seems clear, however, that Neharde'a lay either close to Falluja, or some twenty-four miles downstream, andthat theswamps to which Josephus refers lay yet further to the south, along the line of the Pallacottas channel, which is now the course ofthe main stream of the Euphrates.2
We return now to thetwo apprentices of Neharde'a, who quickly gathered a following of youths as impoverished as themselves,and began to earn a substantial living through brigandage. The satrap of Babylonia led against them a force of cavalry, intending to surprise them onthe Sabbath. The outlaws, however, were forewarned bythe neighing of the horses, and putting aside their religious scruples, defended themselves resolutely, and defeated the Parthians with great slaughter. At this point the king Artabanus intervened personally, and summoned thebrothers to court under safe conduct. When first Anilaeus, and then Asinaeus, had been prevailed on to attend, he conferred onthem the governorship of their territory - though much to the chagrin ofhis Parthian commander-in-chief Abdagases. That the king had political reasons for this unexpected decision is evident enough. Inthe province ofBabylonia at this time not only were many Parthian nobles disaffected, but at the same time the "Syrians" and the Hellenists were at loggerheads, and moreover the city of Seleucia was on the brink ofopen rebellion against the Parthian government, which in fact broke out some years later in A.D. 35-6 asweshall see. At the same time, the pretender Tiridates, with Roman support, was planning an attempt upon theParthian throne. In such a dangerous situation, it is easy to see that the king would have welcomed the establishment of a new military force, committed to neither of the leading factions, and attached, if only byhis toleration, directly to the ruler himself.
For fifteen years, as Josephus relates, thebrothers governed their province successfully and firmly. Only when Anilaeus wastempted by guilty passion did their position decline. A certain Parthian general in the area had a wife of surpassing beauty, whose fame spread farand

wide. The former apprentice was determined to winherfor himself, and this he could only achieve by making a sudden attack upon the husband, killing him in battle, and carrying offhis widow. Hequickly made her his wife, butthe lady took advantage of this enhanced status to resume her ancestral worship of images, some of which she had contrived tobring away with her into her captivity. Such unorthodoxy aroused bitter complaints from the followers of the brothers, who protested to Asinaeus about this marriage to a gentile, so violently indeed that oneof the party who spoke too freely waseven put to death. Asinaeus in fact took no action against his brother, but the wife ofAnilaeus, perceiving the danger that was tobeanticipated from the discontent of their followers, putpoison in thefood of Asinaeus, so leaving herhusband as thesole leader of the band.
Anilaeus next began to ravage theproperty of a leading Parthian, by name Mithradates, a member of the high nobility, and a son-in-law of Artabanus theking. The aggrieved nobleman naturally sallied out with his cavalry to chastise the raiders, but Anilaeus surprised them in a night attack on the Parthian camp, and not only dispersed the Parthians but captured Mithradates himself. For fear ofreprisals against the Jewish community at Babylon, Anilaeus finally decided that Mithradates should be released. However, enraged by his humiliation, Mithradates returned to the attack with greatly enlarged forces, and on the second occasion heavily defeated the Jewish forces, whose losses were estimated by Josephus at tens of thousands. Though Anilaeus andhisbodyguard made good their escape to the marshes, and built up their force by recruiting runaways and outlaws, the new recruits could not compare in efficiency with those whohad fallen, and he was eventually surprised bythe Babylonians and putto death.
The anecdote of the two brothers had a direct bearing on thesubsequent revolt of Seleucia against the Parthian rulers. Fornow that military support wasremoved, the Babylonians began to harass the Jewish settlements in theEuphrates region. The inhabitants, lacking means of defence, decamped to thecity of Seleucia andsettled there. However, that city itself in A.D. 35-6 broke into open rebellion against the Parthian empire; andwithin three years a state of social tension became obvious even within the walls. Initially hostility had prevailed between the Greek community and the local Aramaeans. The Jews at first allied themselves with the latter party, which thus became the stronger; but later the Greeks contrived to reach an understanding



THE "ROMAN PEACE"
with the Aramaeans, and the two factions combined to make a surprise attack on the Jews. No fewer than fifty thousand of the latter are reported to have been massacred, andthe survivors expelled from the city. Some fled to the adjoining royal residence of Ctesiphon, while others from the surrounding districts made good their escape to the cities of Neharde'a andNisibis.1 Despite its wealth of colourful detail there are several obscurities in the narrative; it is not clear what became of the Jewish refugees who retired to Ctesiphon, and why the fugitives who returned to Neharde'a felt themselves secure there, while previously they hadpreferred to evacuate that site to settle at Seleucia.
Having thus traced thefortunes of the populous Jewish community in the growing disorder that prevailed at this time in Parthian Babylonia, we must return to consider thehistory of the kings. In A.D. 3 5 the Roman emperor Tiberius, egged on by secret emissaries ofthe Parthian nobility, in particular a certain Sinnaces, undermined the Parthian position in Armenia by effecting a reconciliation between Pharasmanes, king of Iberia, andhisbrother Mithradates. The former was then induced to place his brother on the Armenian throne. The Arsacid incumbent, known only asArsaces, was assassinated, and when Artabanus sent his son Orodes to restore thesituation hewas defeated by the numerous Iberian infantry force, supported bySarmatian cavalry from beyond theCaucasus.
Artabanus brought up his entire army to repair the setback, but Vitellius, Roman governor of Syria, massed his troops against the frontier of Mesopotamia, thus creating a diversion. At the same time, the Romans played on the disloyalty of certain prominent Parthian nobles. Sinnaces, a leading malcontent, urged others to revolt, and soon even the determined Artabanus found he had no recourse but to withdraw to "Scythia", east of the Caspian Sea, and to retire to the life of a private citizen, until a change in his fortunes might enable him to return with thehelp of his Hyrcanian and Carmanian allies.2
When the throne was thus standing vacant, Vitellius seized the chance toferry across the Euphrates the exiled Parthian prince Tiridates.

and whose behaviour suggests he may have been identical with the resentful general of the episode of Anilaeus (above, p. 72). Yet the Parthian spirit would not long endure a Roman protectorate, and though Seleucia received the pretender, two important satraps, Phraates and Hiero, refused to attend the coronation; instead, they sent to Artabanus in Hyrcania. Still in thetattered costume of a hunter,and holding his bow, the veteran king put himself at the head of the antiRoman party, andsoon found himself in the vicinity of Seleucia at the head of a large army. Tiridates, dismayed, took thefatal decision to retire west ofthe Tigris into Mesopotamia. His retreat assumed the appearance of a rout, and hesoon fled back across the Euphrates into Syria.
Tiberius now instructed his governor to come to terms with Artabanus. The two met, each accompanied by a bodyguard, on the bridge of the Euphrates, and were entertained to a banquet by Herod
the tetrarch.1 Dio Cassius, however, places this episode after the death
of Tiberius and under Caligula,2 a dating which the silence of Tacitus may be held to confirm. Theterms of the treaty are not known in detail, butanessential Roman demand was that a son of the Parthian king should besent to Rome asa surety forthe maintenance ofpeace,
and thehostage in this case was theprince Darius.3 When thetreaty was agreed, Vitellius returned to Antioch, and Artabanus to Babylon.
There is perhaps noneed to follow Debevoise4here in assuming that Josephus' use here of the word "Babylon" is actually a reference to Seleucia, capital city ofBabylonia. For this metropolis was still inopen revolt, and some of its factions secretly in touch with Rome, soas to make even the established Parthian royal residence at Ctesiphon an inconvenient centre for the ruler when the routes to the threatened Euphrates frontier, and the Tigris bridges, might soeasily beblocked by ahostile force. Insuch circumstances, it is not difficult toaccept that Artabanus hadtemporarily established his court at Babylon, just as did his successor Vardanes afew years later, according tothe testimony
of the biographer Philostratus.5
The Roman emperor Tiberius died in A.D. 37, butthe plots hehad set afoot against Artabanus III were by no means disarmed after his death. Learning that an assassination attempt was once more being

THE "ROMAN PEACE"
planned, the Parthian king took refuge inthe semi-independent frontier kingdom ofAdiabene, then under the rule ofa certain Izates, a member of the local dynasty who, not long before, during a visit to the commercial seaport ofSpasinou Charax^had become a convert to Judaism. In the cordial reception given by the local princeling tothe exiled king, we see once more evidence forthe close relations existing at this time between the Jewish community and the Arsacid rulers intheir hour of crisis. Izates received his former overlord with honour, and undertook to effect his restoration to his kingdom. He wrote to the Parthian leaders urging them to restore the king, and even persuaded the Arsacid prince Cinnamus,2 who had been nominated to the throne, to write offering to abdicate in favour of Artabanus; and ultimately himself once more to place the diadem on the head of the aged king. Izates was rewarded for his fidelity with such traditional honours as the right towear his tiara upright after the fashion ofthe kings, andto sleep ona bed of gold;3he was further endowed with the territory of Nisibis.
In A.D. 38,the long reign of Artabanus came to an end, and he bequeathed the kingdom tohis son Vardanes.4 Another son, Gotarzes, is reported at first tohave seized the throne,5 but when he put to death the third brother, Artabanus, with his wife and child, there was a general outcry, which resulted inan invitation being sent to Vardanes. The latter, possibly to some extent forewarned, surprised the usurper by covering thedistance of three hundred miles in only two days, a feat which is notto be dismissed as impossible,6 andwas acclaimed by the governors of the adjoining provinces. Only the Seleucians rejected thesuccession of Vardanes, who promptly laid siege to the city; but Gotarzes returned to the attack with reinforcements from the Hyrcanians and Dahae, and forced Vardanes to withdraw, on the evidence ofTacitus,7 to " the plains of Bactria ". This detail is surprising, since it is difficult to see bywhat route Vardanes could have reached Bactria, if Hyrcania and the land ofthe Dahae were under the control of his rival.

IRAN UNDER THE ARSACIDS
Upheavals followed in Armenia, for Claudius had released the Iberian Mithradates, for some time held in detention at Rome, and he now began to reoccupy thecountry with Roman assistance. At thesame time, a battle was pending between Vardanes and Gotarzes. However, when thelatter revealed to the former a plot of thepopular party against both the rival Arsacids, the two contenders came to anagreement, under which Vardanes was toretain the throne, and Gotarzes to retire to Hyrcania. Vardanes was next able to secure thecapitulation of Seleucia, the city having been in revolt forseven years.
An interesting sidelight isprovided on the reign ofVardanes by the journey across Babylonia at this time of the itinerant Greek philosopher,
Apollonius of Tyana.1 Confidence in the reliability of this account is strengthened bythe fact that its later description ofthe Indo-Parthian
city of Taxila was substantially confirmed byexcavation.2 The taleof the journey across Babylonia conveys a certain tone of credulity,but is avowedly based on thediary of the philosopher's companion, the simpleton Damis. Its details are, however, convincing enough. Vardanes hadbeen reigning for twoyears andtwomonths when the travellers found him residing at Babylon, and theepisodes of palace life, and a lavish horse-sacrifice, sound wholly in character.
At this time Vardanes undertook a tour ofhis provinces,3 and tried to persuade his vassal Izates of Adiabene totake military action against
the Roman interests in Armenia.4 This Izates was unwilling to do, since five ofhis sons were then inRoman territory, whereat Vardanes even threatened war with Adiabene. Gotarzes meanwhile rose once more in revolt against hisbrother, who advanced and defeated him
on the river Erindes,6 a stream on the boundary of Media and Hyrcania. Vardanes pressed on to conquer all the provinces as far as the boundary of Aria, and erected a monument to commemorate his triumphs; but was finally murdered during a hunting expedition, his death taking place towards the end ofA.D. 45. Gotarzes (II) was now the strongest candidate for the throne, but before long, complaints of his ruthlessness were once more circulating, and a faction of the Parthian nobles sent secret appeals to the Roman emperor to provide another king.
The latest pretender was Meherdates, grandson of Phraates IV,the

THE "ROMAN PEACE"
story ofwhose bid forthe Parthian throne forms a picturesque episode
in thenarrative of Tacitus.1 The account opens with a glimpse of the senatorial debate, in which the historian summarizes the persuasive speech of the Parthian nobles. There follows the sententious reply of Claudius, who likened himself to Augustus, clumsily exhorting Meherdates to treat his future subjects with respect, andto the Parthians lauding this "pupil ofthe City", urging them toremain constant to the newruler, andavoid fickle changes of their kings. Rome, he concluded, had grown so great that she only wished neighbouring powers to beat peace.
Finally in A.D. 49, the governor of Syria, Gaius Cassius, escorted Meherdates to the Euphrates. He crossed at Zeugma (Birecik), to be welcomed on the eastern bank by Abgar, ruler of Edessa. Messages
were received from his supporter Carenes,2 the Parthian governor of Mesopotamia, urging himto hasten forwards. Yetthe inexperienced prince dawdled at Edessa, and then from thedirect route turned aside into Armenia, which wasalready suffering in the grip of winter. By the time hismen had reached theTigris they were in poor shape,but they joined forces with Carenes and made the crossing. Izates of Adiabene also attached himself to theinvading army, butsecretlyhis sympathies were with Gotarzes; so the combined force pressed on
past the ruins of Nineveh andthecitadel of Arbela.3
Meanwhile, in anticipation of the conflict, Gotarzes was occupied in religious observances near themountain of Sanbulos. Tacitus gives an eerie account of the cult of a hunter-god whom he identifies with Hercules, at whose temple horses saddled forhunting were kept ready at nightfall. They were taken outinto thedarkness with full quivers, to return later breathless and with thequivers empty. Later the priests were informed ina vision ofthe way by which the god had passed, and went out to collect the animals that had been brought down. The legend has often been linked with the cult ofthe Assyrian deity Nergal, god of hunting as of war andvictory, whose worship was no doubt identified by Iranians with their cult of Mithra. The scene ofthe
hunting-fresco at Dura-Europos4 corresponds with that which Tacitus

envisaged. The name ofHercules has been found ina Greek inscription
at Karafto1 in Iranian Kurdistan, and suggests it wasthe site ofa similar cult; since evidence for topography in the brief Latin account is scanty, it may nothave been theidentical spot at which Gotarzes offered his vows. The latter's objective was to defend theline of a river named as the Corma, perhaps the present-day Lesser Zab. Gotarzes employed delaying-tactics, and induced first Izates, and later Abgar, to desert the invading force. Soon Meherdates was forced by his deteriorating situation to risk a battle; andGotarzes was encouraged by his enemy's reduced numbers to accept it. Theissue of the sanguinary encounter hung in thebalance, until Carenes, pressing a pursuit too far, was surrounded and overthrown. Meherdates abandoned the
struggle, entrusting his safety to his father's vassal Parrax,2 bywhom, however, he was betrayed, andhanded over to thevictor. Gotarzes contemptuously spared the pretender's life, cutting off his ears to disqualify him from the throne, and publicly reviling him asa Roman puppet.
A word must besaid at this point about the attribution by Herzfeld
of a rock-sculpture at Bisitun to thesecond Gotarzes.3 This sculpture adjoins another which bears the name of Mithradates II(pp. 41ff.,above), and of which the accompanying inscription mentions a Gotarzes described as"Satrap of satraps". Presumably hewas the same personage wholater ascended the throne as Gotarzes I. No evidence is provided by Herzfeld to substantiate his case that the neighbouring sculpture represents a different Gotarzes. Moreover, the inscription over therelief with which weare now concerned mentions "Gotarges Geopothros" "Gotarzes theson of Gev". Gotarzes II was actuallythe son ofthe Arsacid Artabanus III, and could hardly have been described as "the son ofGev", which seems tobe an argument against Herzfeld's interpretation. Moreover thesculpture is too similar to the other in treatment andstyle, having apparently similar Greek inscriptions, to be dated as much as a hundred andfifty years later. Now that the importance ofthe historical role ofGotarzes I can be better appreciated than in Herzfeld's time, theascription of rock-sculptures to hislater namesake can hardly be supported.

CONTINUATION OF CONFLICT WITH ROME
OVER ARMENIA
In A.D. 51, apparently the year after his victory, Gotarzes II died, either of disease,1 or as the result of a conspiracy.2 He was succeeded by Vonones, then reigning inMedia, ofwhom history records " nothing either good or bad", andwhodisappeared within a few months. The son3 of the last then acceded to the throne, under the designation of Vologeses I. The son of a Greek inmate of the harem, his rise tothe throne was assisted by his two brothers. The elder, Pacorus, heinstalled as sub-king in Atropatene; for the younger, Tiridates, he sought to obtain the throne of Armenia, which wasat this time under the control of Rhadamistus, son of the Iberian king Pharasmenes. Rhadamistus hadinvaded the country and captured the stronghold of Gorneae, putting to death there theRoman nominee JVTithradates (who was in fact his uncle) together with thewife andchildren of the latter. Gorneae is thenow well-known archaeological site of Garni, in Soviet Armenia, situated twenty-seven kilometres east of Erevan, in the confluence of two rivers.4 The monuments include the city-wall, a remarkable temple anda palace,5 together with a Greek inscription of the already mentioned Tiridates, who eventually became king of Armenia, and indeed one of its most famous and successful rulers on the Arsacid side.
The uncontrolled aggression of Rhadamistus, in which Pollio, the Roman commander of Mithradates' garrison had actually connived,6 reflected most unfavourably on the Roman authorities and policy. The moment wasripe for Vologeses of Parthia to invade the country on behalf of Tiridates, andhis cavalry promptly drove out the Iberian forces of Rhadamistus. Thecapitals of Artaxata andTigranocerta were quickly seized, but the onset of a bitter winter, lack of supplies, and the outbreak of an epidemic forced the Parthians to withdraw in their turn. Rhadamistus returned, treating his subjects even more harshly than he had previously; and before long they were in open rebellion and

laid siege to his palace. Soon his only recourse was to escape, with his wife, both onhorseback. The queen, Zenobia byname, happened to bepregnant, and was not long able to withstand the rigours of the flight. Unable to continue, shebegged her husband to endher life rather than abandon her tothe rebels; and when no entreaties prevailed on her to gofurther, Rhadamistus in desperation stabbed her withhis Median dagger, flung herbody into theAraxes, and made hisescape to his father's palace at Mtskheta. Zenobia, however, was neither dead nor fatally injured. The current washed her upin a placid backwater, where shepherds found her breathing, and manifestly alive. They bound up her wound, applied such simple remedies as they possessed, andeventually, guessing herroyal origin, sent herto the Parthian contender Tiridates, whoshortly afterwards re-established his power in thecountry. Hereceived theunfortunate queen kindly, and provided forher in a manner appropriate to her rank. It isafeature ofthe surviving historical tradition on Parthia, derived as it is chiefly from Roman sources, that it forms an interminable catalogue of military expeditions, and shows little interest in Parthian manners or aspirations. The few Parthians mentioned in the narrative are depicted as shadowy figures, andenlightening insights are rare, though not wholly lacking. Latin authors tended toshare the obsession of the Roman public, itself no doubt often stimulated by official propaganda, with revenge for the ancient disasters of Crassus and Antony. A succession of ruthless, stubborn, butno doubt efficiently conducted Roman invasions dominate the last century and a half ofthe story, andit is chiefly from their rather inconclusive itineraries that some details can be gained of Parthian culture and topography. Armenia, a country nowincreasingly permeated by Parthian influences, and traditionally ruled by princes ofArsacid descent, remained throughout the bone of contention. Direct Roman administration was only sporadically attempted, and never lasted long. For the rest, the influence of Rome was chiefly applied to intrigues designed to undermine Parthian authority, and to the setting up of nominees tocounterbalance the Arsa
cid contenders.1 Marching and counter-marching designed to support these policies inevitably inflicted great devastation on Armenian cultural life andits main urban centres, with theultimate result that the Parthian element in thecountry continued to grow. At thesame

time, Roman policies designed to wear down the Parthian kingdom, combined with dynastic feuds, and the terrible smallpox epidemic of A.D. 165, eventually so weakened theArsacid state that it succumbed, not indeed to the Romans, but to the far more highly organized and centralized Sasanian kingdom. Thus Rome was in the end provided with a far more powerful antagonist, while thelast pockets of specifically Arsacid tradition survived for several generations notin Iran but in Armenia. In A.D. 54 Nero succeeded Claudius as emperor at Rome. News of the Parthian reoccupation of Armenia caused dismay, andthe eastern legions were ordered into a state of readiness. For the moment, however, the rebellion against the Parthian king Vologeses I of ason, Vardanes, caused the Parthians to withdraw again from Armenia, and led toa lull in developments. A seasoned general, Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, was transferred from Germany to take command of the Roman forces ontheArmenian frontier. Both Corbulo and theRoman legate of Syria sent messages to Vologeses urging him to keep the peace, and asking for the provision of the usual hostages. These Vologeses provided without reluctance, perhaps, as Tacitus suggests, as a means of removing suspected rebels from the country. For the moment, a political vacuum prevailed in Armenia. Vologeses would not allow his brother to give up the kingdom, and Corbulo felt it his duty to restore theRoman empire to theboundaries won by Lucullus and by Pompey. The allegiance of the Armenians was divided. Invitations were sent to both armies, Roman and Parthian, but the rule of Parthia was on the whole preferred, on account of the similarity of customs, andmore lenient domination.
Corbulo wasa stern olddisciplinarian of the traditional school.His rigorous training hada salutary effect on theeastern legions enervated by decades of peacetime conditions. He caused them to spend the winter in tents on the Anatolian plateau, thus seasoning the troops, though many lost limbs byfrost-bite. Deserters were at once punished with death, a practice found inthe aggregate toreduce losses. Tiridates, supported by his brother Vologeses, nowsent flying columns to raid Roman supporters in Armenia far and wide. Corbulo retaliated with similar tactics against the Parthian adherents, and encouraged such Roman allies as King Antiochus of Commagene, Pharasmenes of Iberia, andtheMoschi tribesmen to raid outlying regions of Armenia. Tiridates proposed negotiations, but Corbulo knew that because ofa
81



IRAN UNDER THE ARSACIDS
revolt inHyrcania Vologeses had been obliged towithdraw his forces and leave Tiridates unsupported. Mention must here bemade of the broader political implications of references to Hyrcania which appear in the narrative of Tacitus. In Central Asia by this time, A.D. 59, the empire of the Kushans was rising to a position of great strength. Within a year or two they were to invade thePunjab andoccupy
Taxila.1 To the west there islittle doubt that Kushan control extended at least asfarasMarv. It is surprising that inthe historical literature of the earlier Roman empire, thekingdom of the Kushans is never specifically named. Occasional references in Latin texts to the "Bac
trians" may at times relate to the movements of the Kushans,2 but only in the vaguest terms. The only extant writer of the classical world
to make specific mention ofthe Kushans was Bardesanes of Edessa,3 the genuineness ofwhose information on eastern topics isattested by his giving the first description ofthe people ofGllan, on the Caspian coast; amongst whom, asany recent traveller knows, the bulk of the agricultural work is undertaken by the women. Modern historical knowledge of the strength of the Kushan empire, and its close proximity to Hyrcania, shows how powerful would have been the threat to which Vologeses reacted, and which resulted in the way being opened for Corbulo's invasion ofArmenia.
The Roman force is thought to have advanced eastwards from the vicinity ofpresent-day Erzuium. A suggested conference, which was to beheld inthe presence ofboth armies, proved abortive; but Tiridates was not able tointerfere with Roman supplies being brought up from the Black Sea coast. The outlying Armenian castles were attacked and stormed, themost important of these being thestronghold of Volandum. Noquarter was given to thesurvivors of the garrison, and the civilian inhabitants were deported and sold asslaves. Thence the large Roman force marched down the valley ofthe Araxes, its left flank resting onthe foothills, and drove offthe unsupported cavalry force of Tiridates. The capital city ofArtaxata had to open its gates, but though the lives of the citizens were therefore spared, the walls were levelled and the entire city burnt tothe ground. From Artaxata,

Corbulo marched back, apparently round the eastern shore of Lake Van, to deal with Tigranocerta. The citizens of Armenia's southern capital reckoned discretion the better part of valour, and opened their gates toreceive the Roman army, who spent the winter ofA.D. 59 in the city. The success ofCorbulo's campaign had been greatly assisted by the fact that the Parthians were occupied intheir Hyrcanian war. Hyrcanian ambassadors had reached Corbulo, apparently at Artaxata, to point out the services they were rendering the Roman cause. He had sent them on toRome toconclude an alliance with the emperor; but when they returned, hedid not allow them to travel eastwards across the Euphrates, for fear oftheir being intercepted byParthian patrols; instead he sent them with an escort tothe shores ofthe Red Sea, " t oreach their home by avoiding Parthian territory".1 Interpretations ofthis striking phrase have been various, but there is little doubt that the opinion of Rawlinson is the most satisfactory:2 the envoys would have returned bysea via India, since only thus could they have avoided Parthian controls. That it was possible to reach Hyrcania by so huge a detour resulted from the expansion ofthe Kushan empire at this time. The Hyrcanians in question will either have been Kushan allies, or the term used by Tacitus in fact referred to a Kushan force that was operating on the soil of Hyrcania.
After the removal of Corbulo toTigranocerta, Tiridates returned to northern Armenia from Atropatene. In the spring, probably of A.D. 60, the Roman force marched out once more to drive himback. Intransigent districts were ravaged with fire and sword, and Nero resolved to place Tigranes, a Cappadocian prince, upon the throne. He was installed at Tigranocerta with a strong Roman escort: one thousand legionaries, three allied regiments and two squadrons of cavalry. Soon the new ruler had gained so much confidence that he began to raid the boundaries of Adiabene. Monobazus, sub-king of that region at the time, appealedto Vologeses, and once more the Parthian royal army, under the command of a certain Monaeses, swept into Armenia and besieged Tigranocerta. The city, however, was strongly held, and Corbulo had sent in two legions to strengthen the defenders. After several unsuccessful attempts at escalade, inwhich the contingents from Adiabene sustained heavy losses, the Parthian force began to lose heart. Corbulo now sent to the

king an officer with amessage of protest, threatening to invade Parthian territory ifthe siege was not raised. Even more decisive, at this moment, was the descent of a large swarm of locusts. By devouring all the pasture required by the Parthian cavalry, they put Monaeses in a danger from which he wasonly extricated when Vologeses, thirty (Roman) miles away atNisibis, expressed awish tosend an embassyto the Roman emperor, and ordered his forces towithdraw. Though this may have been partly a diplomatic manoeuvre, it seems true that a genuine wish for settlement of the Armenian deadlock was gaining ground on both sides. To Corbulo came orders towithdraw his troops from Armenia to Syria; then, when the Parthian ambassadors returned unsuccessful, a new Roman general, Caesinius Paetus, arrived to take over the Armenian command. He was to place Armenia under direct Roman rule. Asa general, however, he was in no way theequal of Corbulo, and it was notlong before he found himself in difficulties. His troops were concentrated at Rhandeia, in the valley ofthe Murad
Su1 eastwards ofthe present Elazig. His wife and son, with a detached cohort, were left for safety nearby atArsamosata. His attempt toblock the Taurus passes against Vologeses was a failure, andhis advance guard having been scattered, the remainder of his men were besieged in their legionary camp. Soon the Romans were in difficult straits. An appeal forhelp was sent to Corbulo in Syria, but while he was still three marches away, Paetus came to terms with Vologeses, agreeing to evacuate Armenia and abandon his camp, oncondition that hewas allowed toretreat unhindered toCappadocia. The Romans even undertook to construct a bridge across theRiver Arsanias (Murad Su)for the benefit of the advancing Parthians, before their departure. Their retreat by forced marches to the Euphrates, where they met the relieving army of Corbulo, is depicted as a humiliating rout. It had also been agreed that Vologeses should again be permitted to send emissaries to Nero, who arrived at the same time as evasive dispatches from Paetus. Theambassadors lauded the moderation of Vologeses,and proposed that Tiridates should come to Rome to receive from Nero's hands the diadem ofArmenia, a duty from which he was only deterred by hisreligious obligations as a Magian priest. The delegation were dismissed with gifts, but without a decision, and Nero determined to renew the war under Corbulo's command. Four legions were concen

trated at Melitene (Malatiya) with all their auxiliaries, and Corbulo pressed eastwards, reopening theroute used by Lucullus. He drove out of their strongholds the Armenian barons or megistanae known as hostile to theRomans. The Parthians were none the less disinclined to push matters to extremes, and sent letters requesting negotiations. To these Corbulo replied in conciliatory terms, and eventually there was an impressive meeting of the two armies, hostages were exchanged, and Corbulo held a meeting with Tiridates. The latter stressed that he had suffered no defeat, yetthat hewas ready to goto Rome and receive the diadem of Armenia from the hands of Nero. Tiridates observed with interest the routines andceremonies of the Roman army; and after a visit to his brothers Vologeses and Pacorus at Ecbatana, and after assurances that he would be received in Roman territory with the honours accorded to a consul, retaining his sword and being received in state bythe provincial governors, he was ready to set out onthe elaborate overland journey to Rome that his priestly scruples were said to demand.1 He paid homage to Nero at Naples, and re-enacted the ceremony publicly at Rome. There he was declared king ofArmenia, and invested with the diadem, before departing, this time partly bysea to Dyrrachium, to return to Artaxata. Thus after a ding-dong battle for control ofthe region, Armenia was finally settled as a juridical condominium, with an Arsacid ruler who received his investiture from the Roman emperor. None the less, inpractical terms, the Parthian influence in the region was now overwhelming. Thus with Tiridates I the Arsacids were established inArmenia, and the Roman military demonstrations availed only to hasten the outcome that they were designed to avert.
The claim by Latin writers that Tiridates possessed the status of a Magian priest draws attention also toreligious developments in Parthia under Vologeses I. According to aninterpretation of passages in the Vendiddd and the Denkart^ Vologeses may have been the ruler responsible foran early collection of scriptural texts which later developed into the Avesta.2 The consensus of specialist opinion is, however, inclined to reject the view that a written', rather than an orally transmitted text ofthe Avesta existed inArsacid times,3 so that it is in the latter context that this tradition has to be seen. The name of Vologeses,

a figure of major distinction amongst theArsacid rulers, is also perpetuated byhis part in the foundation of the city in Babylonia which was variously known as Vologesias, Vologesocerta or Valashabad. It has been shown by Maricq that all three names apply to the same city, situated on the Royal Canal some five kilometres south-west of Seleucia.1 The newfoundation mayhave served two purposes for Arsacid policy atthis time. On the one hand, it provided a replacement for the alien city of Seleucia, of which since its rebellion the Parthian kings hadsought steadily to diminish theinfluence in the kingdom. Secondly, it may have provided a remedy forthe silting ofthe original harbour at Seleucia, which bythis date may well have become increasingly inconvenient, andripe for replacement by thenew entrepot at the entrance to animproved Royal Canal. In harmony with the trends here noted inthe home policy ofVologeses I, ofreducing the influence of the Hellenistic element, and increasing that ofthe Magians and their literature, we find also that on the Arsacid drachma coinage of the Iranian plateau, the Greek inscriptions were allowed to become virtually indecipherable, andnew inscriptions in Parthian script, on the obverse of the coin, andat first abbreviated, were provided to indicate theidentity of the ruler who issued them.
It was part of the achievement of Vologeses that the stable peace between the two empires after A.D. 64 resulted in a dearth of information on Parthia from western sources. Apart from routine diplomatic exchanges, only an invasion ofParthian territory by the Alans of south Russia, themselves an Iranian people, inA.D. 72 or soon after, attracted the attention of the historians.2
TRAJAN'S PARTHIAN WARANDITS AFTERMATH
Vologeses I remained upon the Parthian throne until A.D. 79, the year of his last known dated tetradrachm. Yetalready in A.D. 78, a rival, Pacorus II, was issuing dated coins from the mint of Seleucia,and must have been contending with him for possession of the mint-city. In A.D. 80-1 another pretender, Artabanus IV, briefly issued coins at that mint, but byA.D. 83Pacorus was again the only ruler attested. Such indications of internal conflict in theArsacid kingdom suggest conditions which could once more have tempted the Roman emperors

TRAJAN'S PARTHIAN WAR
to launch a campaign against their traditional adversary. Vespasian (A.D. 70-9), asRoman commander in Judaea before his accession, had maintained amicable, or at least neutral, relations with Vologeses I.1 Domitian (A.D. 81-96) apparently dreamed ofa great expedition in the East, but itwas the soldier emperor Trajan (A.D. 98-117) who developed a practical plan, and put it into effect. InParthia, the coinage of Pacorus came to an endin A.D. 96/7. A second Vologeses appears on the coinage in A.D. 105/6, and was soon contesting thethrone with one Osroes, thebrother or brother-in-law of Pacorus. As usual the immediate cause of friction with Rome arose from the situation in Armenia. Osroes deposed acertain Tiridates from the Armenian throne, and putin hisplace a certain Axidares, thesonof Pacorus II. The decision was taken without consultation with Rome, andmay thus have provided the casus belli. After the conclusion of the Dacian war, on 27 October 113, Trajan set sail for the east. An embassy from Osroes met the emperor at Athens, expressing their master's desire forpeace, and informing himthat Axidares hadnow been deposed from the Armenian throne, and requesting his replacement by his brother Parthamasiris. However, Trajan rejected therequest, and indeed the presents brought by the embassy.
At this point a word must be said about the sources available for the expedition of Trajan. Unlike the previous Roman campaigns, it lacks a continuous and accurate narrative. A major historian, Arrian, accompanied theforce, anddescribed its operations in his Parthicay but thework didnotsurvive intact. It is known from fragments in the Bibliotheca of Photius, citations in thedictionaries of Suidas and Stephanus Byzantinus, and from book LXVIII of Dio Cassius. The latter in turn is preserved intwo Byzantine collections ofexcerpts, and inthe epitome of Xiphilinus of which portions are transmitted by Zonaras. Because ofthis fragmentary transmission, it is not always easy to place isolated episodes, or fix the sequence of events.2 Independent of the Arrian tradition isthe account ofMalalas, a version thought topossess authority of its own based on local records from Antioch, but of rather uneven reliability and quality. Tothese two narratives, neither wholly satisfactory, some fixed points areadded by theevidence of Latin inscriptions; and Roman coins provide a few additional hints.

IRAN UNDER THE ARSACIDS
Trajan devoted theyear A.D. 114 to a campaign in Armenia. He established his advanced base atMelitene (Malatiya), where letters were received from Parthamasiris. Later hepushed forward to Arsamosata, and eventually to Satala. AtElegia, not fartothe west ofErzerum,an interview was granted to Parthamasiris. The latter, following the precedent of Tiridates, removed his diadem and placed it before Trajan, expecting to have itreplaced on his head; but the emperor made no such move. After the Arsacid had complained of his treatment he was permitted to withdraw, but his Roman cavalry escort brought him toa halt, and apparently on Trajan's order, killed him on the spot. The Roman army then proceeded with the detailed "pacification" of Armenia, even attacking the Mardi, who were said to live on the eastern side of Lake Van. Thus Armenia was once more made into a Roman province, and a procuratorial governor appointed. For his part in this campaign the emperor received the title "Optimus Princeps".
In the following season (A.D. 115) Trajan turned south to deal with northern Mesopotamia. Here the plan was to reduce Nisibis - hitherto the stronghold ofthe Parthian frontier zone - and the border kingdom of Edessa. Anew, and shortened, Roman border was tobe established further to thesouth on the line of the Chaboras river and theJabal Sinjar. A milestone of Trajan bearing the title Parthicus, granted as a consequence ofthis campaign, was reported from the village ofKarshi
on the route from Nisibis to Singara.1 -The Parthian coinage issued at Seleucia during this period suggests by its alternations that a dynastic struggle was in progress between Osroes (Khusrau), currently in control of Babylonia, and Vologeses II in Iran. Such a division in the control of the Parthian kingdom was becoming increasingly usual as the 2nd century advanced, and contributed to the weakening of Parthian defence against external invaders. Moreover, it has been further suggested that Pacorus IIwas still alive and pursuing his claims at the same time, a view which the attribution to him of copper coins of Seleucia dated A.D. 114/5 seems to confirm. Throughout thecampaign of Trajan in Upper Mesopotamia, there is no report of intervention by Osroes or his army, except for his brief demonstration against Manisares, adissident Parthian vassal in Gordyene. Mebarsapes, ruler ofAdiabene, between the Greater and Lesser Zab rivers, was the main leader of what resistance could be offered. Hewas aided from time to time by other local chiefs, of whom themost celebrated was the phylarch Sporaces, whose fort at Halibiya on the Euphrates is

TRAJAN'S PARTHIAN WAR
mentioned by Shapur the Great in his R^J* Gestae.1 Trajan overcame all opposition and retired to spend the winter of A.D. II5/6 at Antioch, where he narrowly escaped injury in the severe earthquake which took place in December of that year. It is necessary at this point in the narrative to consider a question of terminology in the accounts of the following season's campaign. The Iranian rulers applied to the province known in the west as Babylonia (of which the capital at this time was of course no longer Babylon but
at the city-complex of Seleucia-Ctesiphon) the name of Asuristan.2 The term had been transferred from the more northerly region of historical Assyria probably as long ago as the reign of the Achaemenian
king Xerxes.3 In conformity with the current Parthian usage, some western historians used the term "Assyria" as a caique on Asuristan,
with reference to Babylonia.4 Northern Mesopotamia, lately conquered by Trajan, was known to the Iranians as Arabistan, and this was also sometimes rendered by western historians as Arabia - a term more familiar in the west as applying to other regions of Arab population. Moreover, the lands east of the Tigris, situated between the Greater and Lesser Zab rivers, were in this period correctly known to the western historians as Adiabene (Aramaic Htadayab; Parthian Norsirakan), but occasionally designated as Assyria in accordance with the obsolete terminology. Difficulties of interpretation arising from such ambiguities have to be watched in reading classical accounts of the expeditions of Trajan and of later Roman generals.
Early in A.D. 116 Trajan marched out of the greatly damaged city of Antioch, and, according to a widely current interpretation of the fragmentary sources, struck across eastwards to the Tigris and forced a crossing on to its eastern bank. This version may arise from the misunderstanding of the term "Assyria", for it was none the less certain that the main Roman thrust in the campaign that followed was along the line of the Euphrates. The triumphal arch found by the excavators of Dura Europos suggests that the emperor in person had passed that way. It was the first occasion on which this caravan city had passed from Parthian into Roman hands. The references to Phalga and Naarda (Neharde'a) in the gazetteer of Stephanus Byzantinus are ascribed to the Varthica of Arrian, so these places must have figured as stages in the same march. Modern commentators have been concerned

to discuss whether the Roman plan was to advance along the Tigris, along the Euphrates, orby a two-pronged offensive along both routes at once. It is notclear, if the emperor himself first accompaniedthe army of the Tigris, how he made hisway back to theEuphrates in time to accompany the main force. The objective was Ctesiphon, which lies, of course, east of the Tigris, and could therefore conveniently have been approached by either route. There is nospecific mention in the sources of the Royal Canal (Nehar Malka), butpresumably that alignment was followed, since at a certain point it became possible for the boats tobe hauled on carts from the "Euphrates" tothe Tigris. No reference is made atthis stage to Seieucia, but the city was evidently defended bythe Parthians, a fact which may account forthe difficulty experienced by the Romans in taking their boats all the way by water down tothe Tigris.
Whatever the precise plan of campaign, Ctesiphon was capturedby Trajan without resistance. The Parthian king Osroes had made good his escape, and the Romans were not only successful in capturing his golden throne, but his daughter too was found amongst the prisoners. It was after this unprecedented success that Trajan received confirmation of the grant to him by the Senate of the title Parthicus. The Roman army then set sail upon the Tigris with a fleet of fifty ships, and sailed down the river to thekingdom of Mesene (Maisan), also known as Characene. The ruler at this time was Attambelos V, who madehis submission to Trajan and paid tribute. The Roman frontier had thus been boldly extended from theEuphrates up to theTigris. For an incredible moment a Roman emperor stood on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and dreamed, like Alexander, ofnew worlds to conquer. As a traveller will, hewatched the ships setting sail for India, and the late writer Jordanes even claims that a statue of the emperor was erected onthe shore.1 The greatest of Roman emperors could hardly have been unaware that beyond the Iranian plateau the Kushan empire was rising to itszenith in Bactria and India, and that itsports could be reached by sea. Yet he must already have guessed that his own days were numbered, and the very speed of his conquests made them insecure. Bythetime he had reached Babylon on hisreturn up the Euphrates, word arrived that the newly won territories were ingeneral revolt and massacring his garrisons. A special effort had tobe made to regain control long enough to effect the retreat ofthe Roman armies.

TRAJAN'S PARTHIAN WAR
The general Lucius Quietus captured Nisibis and sacked Edessa.
Erucius Clarus and Julius Alexander now for the first time took, and
burnt, Seleucia-on-the-Tigris. The Parthian forces on the middle
Euphrates were commanded by a brother of Osroes named Meherdotes.
He fell from his horse and was killed, to be succeeded in the command
by his son Sanatruces, who also achieved some successes. Osroes sent
a large Parthian army to the aid of Sanatruces under the command of
his son Parthamaspates, but discord arose between the two leaders.
Parthamaspates was persuaded at a secret meeting with Trajan to
attack his cousin, whom he defeated, captured and killed. After this
diplomatic success, Trajan assembled the remaining Parthians at
Ctesiphon, and invested Parthamaspates with the diadem. This is the
event celebrated by the famous Roman coins with the inscription
REX PARTHIS DATUS.
In A.D. 117 Trajan at last retreated from Babylonia, following the
third of the possible routes northwards, the central route of the Wadi
Thartar, which passes the caravan city of Hatra. The fortified, circular
city in the heart of the desert had been a pivot of Parthian military
resistance. Its mixed populations, Iranian, Arab and Aramaean, were
united in devotion to the Arsacid cause. Trajan laid siege to the forti
fications, but the barrenness of the surrounding country, the terrible
heat and the maddening swarms of flies all added to the hardships of
the Roman soldiers. Even when a breach had been made in the walls,
several determined attacks failed, and the Roman army was forced to
withdraw to their own frontier. By the autumn of A.D. 117 the Romans
had not only withdrawn completely from Babylonia, they had even
evacuated their troops once more from Dura-Europos. Meanwhile, the
health of the emperor Trajan was failing. He had set out on his return
to Italy, but died in August at Selinus in Cilicia. His successor, Hadrian,
wisely decided to revert to the traditional frontier on the Euphrates.
The successful defence of Hatra against the Romans inaugurated a
period of great prosperity for that city. Excavations conducted over a
number of years by the Iraq government have revealed a remarkable
wealth of temples, sculptures and inscriptions within the walls.1 Some
of the leading personages bear Iranian, Aramaic or even Arab names.
That the Parthian influence is strong is made clear by the splendid
Parthian costumes of many of the statues, consisting of the typical
shirt (qamis) and trousers represented as made from richly ornamented

materials. The dates of several of the finest sculptures are grouped between Seleucid 444/132 andSeleucid 449/137, andsome make mention of a king named Sanatruk (Sinatruces), whom Debevoise sought to link, but inconclusively, with the Parthian general wholed resistance to the Romans. However, the king ofHatra is more likely to have been a namesake than a descendant of Trajan's Parthian opponent.
THE LAST CENTURY OF ARSACID RULE
The closing decades of the Parthian empire show a marked diminution in thevolume of historical source-material, andconsequent reduction of detailed information. The nearest approach to a continuous account is provided byreferences in the later books of Dio Cassius. Thereare also occasional brief statements in the Augustan History, Naturally such evidence is largely confined to notices of the Roman campaigns, and of Parthian diplomatic exchanges with Rome. The continuing evidence ofthe Arsacid coinage, and especially its dated issues from the mint of Seleucia, provides a chronological thread, though one by no means free of interruption. The research and discoveries of recent years have added oneor twopieces of valuable information, shortly to be examined, butthey have also cast grave doubt on an authority of some extent which had previously been accorded general credence. This is the so-called Chronicle of Arbela, attributed to a certain Msiha Zkha,1 which until the last few years wasutilized asreliable by leading historians. The hesitations felt as to its worth by Syriac scholars have lately gained emphasis as a result of two critical studies.2 Their conclusion seems tobethat the work in question is a fabrication, compiled indeed bya scholar well informed on theclassical and Syriac authors, but that the text is wholly devoid of independent ancient authority. To these criticisms a further point might be added: that where the Chronicle offers information additional to that of the ancient sources, none of these details has found confirmation in the more recently discovered Res Gestae Divi Saporis. Thus it is probably right to delete information derived from this Chronicle from therepertoire of presentday historians of Parthia.
The Parthians did not long endure the turncoat Parthamaspates.

He escaped to Roman territory, and was there entrusted with the government of Osroene, the province of Edessa. Once again, the evidence of coins suggests that the Parthian kingdom was divided. Vologeses III was contending against Osroes, and though Hadrian eventually returned to the latter his daughter, in the same year, 128/9, the coinage of Osroes ceased. The next contender with whom Vologeses was faced wasMithradates IV in Iran. Thename of the latter is known from the long Parthian legend on the reverse of his coinage. In May A.D. 148 Vologeses III was succeeded by Vologeses IV, whose long reign continued until March A.D. 192.Throughout the reign ofAntoninus Pius at Rome, peace prevailed on the Euphrates frontier. Only with the accession of Marcus Aurelius in A.D. 161 did the threat of hostilities return. According tothe western sources, Vologeses launched the first offensive soon after the newruler's accession. A Roman army was destroyed at Elegia in Armenia under Severianus, and Parthian forces poured across the Euphrates into Syria, after retaking Edessa. The Romans reacted by concentrating eight legions in Syria under Lucius Verus, the colleague of the emperor. Twoexpeditionary forces were mustered; the first, under Statius Priscus, swept into Armenia in A.D. 163 and apparently placed one Sohaemus on the throne. In the following year, thesecond force, under Avidius Cassius, invaded Mesopotamia. Dura-Europos was recaptured, and henceforth remained in Roman hands. An armistice followed, and the Romans marched on to Seleucia, where they were received peacefully. Before long, however, a dispute arose, and in December A.D. 165 the legions stormed and burnt thecity. Ctesiphon was also captured, andthepalace of Vologeses destroyed.
The inactivity of the Parthians appears to have been partly dueto a terrible epidemic of smallpox. The disease, at this time apparently unknown in the west, had been raging for more than a decade inthe
Kushan territories of India.1 As a result of the great stimulus that the peace and prosperity of the Antonines had given to world trade, the scourge had spread along the trade routes to southern Arabia, to China, and of course also to Babylonia. During the sack of Seleucia, one of the Roman soldiers contracted theinfection. Soon the epidemic was raging amongst the susceptible western soldiery, and the whole invading army was forced to retreat in confusion. The survivors carried the virus with them into the Roman empire, and so began the

"Great Pestilence" that was studied by the physician Galen of Pergamum. Over a quarter of the urban population in some parts of the Roman empire perished, andthere is much justification for the historians who believe that this disaster was thegreatest single cause of the decline of Roman civilization. Later Roman campaigns against Edessa and Nisibis were accompanied by the added terror of the epidemic. However, as a consequence of the expeditions of A.D.165 and 166, the Roman frontier was fixed onthe line of the Jabal Sinjar, of the Chaboras (Khabur), and of Dura-Europos.
In September A.D. 191 Vologeses IV was replaced by arival, currently numbered Vologeses V. Inthe Roman empire a contest forthe throne was wonby Septimius Severus, whofollowed his success with a campaign in northern Mesopotamia. Though diverted in A.D. 196 by the rebellion in Gaul of Clodius Albinus, hereturned in A.D. 197, and performed the nowtraditional march down the Euphrates to Seleucia and Babylon. Ctesiphon, which was defended, was once more captured and sacked. In December A.D. 198 he assumed the title Parthicus Maximus; then heretreated, like Trajan, byway of Hatra, which was once more beseiged without avail.
In A.D. 207/8 Vologeses V was succeeded byhis son, Vologeses VI. It should be noted that the numbering of rulers with this name is increased by one since LeRider's discovery of a new Vologeses II. Direct sources arelacking for thehistory of Parthia during the immediately following years. With theaccession of Caracalla as Roman emperor in A.D. 211, plans for a further Roman invasion of Parthia were put inhand. The rulers of Osroene and ofArmenia were arrested, and their kingdoms once more annexed as Roman provinces. Not long afterwards a further division took place ofthe Parthian kingdom. The brother of Vologeses VI established himself as an independent ruler, andhe is thus designated Artabanus V / Islamic sources know him as Ardavan. Heappears to have been a stronger character than Vologeses VI, and from his seat in Media gained control both of Mesopotamia andin duecourse of Susa. However, the tetradrachm once ascribed to himby Longperier is nowshown to have been a
specimen ofVologeses VI,2 and no evidence remains that Artabanus V ever gained control of Seleucia. Fortheaccession date of Artabanus
1 Certain recent writers, including Sellwood (below, p.280), have eliminated the first Artabanus, so that the last Arsacid ruler becomes Artabanus IV. Forthe present context, however, itseems clearer to retain the traditional numbering ofthe last ruler as Artabanus V. 2 B. Simonetta, "A note on Vologeses V, Artabanus V and Artavasdes", NC 1956, p.80.
94



LAST CENTURY OF ARSACID RULE
precise evidence exists, because of this ruler's historical connection with thereligious leader Mani, who was born on theeighth dayof his fifth regnal year. A quotation given by the great Muslim scientist and astronomer al-Blruni,1 runs as follows: "Man! states in theShdpiirakdn that he was born in theyear 5 27 of the astronomers of Babylon, when four years hadelapsed of the reign of Ardavan."
The date given here is to be converted according to the Babylonian form of the Seleucid era, so that thebirth of Mani must have occurred in A.D. 216(527 — 311 = 216). The first year of Ardavan was accordingly the Seleucid year 523, and its Julian equivalent A.D. 212/3 (523 — 311 = 212). A limestone stele discovered at Susa bears a Parthian inscription attesting the rule there of Artabanus V only three years later, in the Arsacid year 462, equivalent to A.D. 215 (462 — 247 = 215).2 The stone commemorates a certain Khwasak, satrap of Susa, and that the king in question is indeed Artabanus V is made certain by the fact that he is depicted wearing a forked beard, which appears also on some of the drachmae issued by this king.3
Caracalla, who claimed tohave inspired the rivalry between Vologeses VI and Artabanus V, now began to concentrate Roman forces in Syria. He demanded the return of a runaway philosopher, Antiochus, and of Tiridates, perhaps an Armenian prince, on threat of war. Artabanus, however, avoided a crisis by returning the refugees. In A.D. 216 Caracalla, then resident at Antioch, sent a request to marry the daughter of Artabanus V. He may have planned to secure a claim to theParthian succession, andto find a pretext for invasion if his suit were refused. Again Artabanus eventually agreed, and the emperor made a state visit to theParthian court. Finally, according to therather unreliable historical tradition, the Romans during the celebrations attacked the unsuspecting Parthians, and slaughtered many, though Artabanus made good his escape. Then the Roman army ravaged a large part of Media, captured thecity of Arbela, and, soit is said, broke open the Parthian royal tombs and scattered the bones. While Artabanus retreated into the mountains to gather fresh forces, Caracalla was murdered on the road from Edessa to Carrhae. When Macrinus succeeded inA.D. 217 the Parthians invaded Mesopotamia, and defeated the Romans near Nisibis.
In the end,it wasnot to the Romans, for all their onslaughts, but

to the new Iranian dynasty of the Sasanians that theArsacid empire was tosuccumb. Ardashlr I, the dynamic heir tothe kingdom ofPersis, had subdued the neighbouring principalities, and aspired to overthrow his Arsacid overlord. According to thebrief account of Dio Cassius, Artaxerxes (Ardashlr) fought altogether three battles against the Parthian, in all of which he was victorious. Neither theplace nor the date of the final encounter, thecelebrated battle of Hormizdagan, are yet precisely established, but the recent suggestion of Professor Widengren, that the battle took place north-west of Isfahan, on the route toHamadan,1 brings an interesting new point into the discussion. On this hypothesis, theencounter will have been close to thesite of the Hellenistic battle between Eumenes and Antigonus in 317 B.C. Tabari relates that in the final cavalry charge, Ardashlr slew Ardavan, his sonShapur slew theParthian vizier, and thePersian page another Parthian opponent; and most authorities agree that the rock-sculptures of the Tang-Ab gorge near Firuzabad in Fars depict this scene. Meanwhile at the mint of Seleucia Vologeses VIcontinued toissue his dated tetradrachm coinage until A.D. 222/3, thus reigning simultaneously with Artabanus.2 There exist, however, at least twospecimens ofa tetradrachm issue apparently in all respects identical with those of Vologeses, butbearing theSeleucid date 539/A.D. 228/9. This date is usually placed after the final triumph of Ardashlr, and it is difficult at first sight to explain how a coinage of Vologeses VI could have been issued at Seleucia at such a late date. Earlier writers, following a suggestion of Longperier, believed that the effigy onthis coin showed a royal portrait with a forked beard, and must thus depict Artavasdes (Ardavazd), a son of Artabanus V.In his recent article, Simonetta has shown that the suggestion of a forked beard onthe tetradrachm is no more than an illusion. In any event, coins with this feature areto be ascribed rather to Artabanus V than to Artavasdes.3
The only possible explanation of the latest Parthian tetradrachm seems thus to be that some sort of short-lived counter-revolution in favour ofthe Arsacids, and against the Sasanian conquerors, took place at Seleucia inA.D. 228/9. Whether Vologeses VI was still actually alive, or whether his coin-type was used posthumously, is at present uncertain. It isperhaps more than a coincidence that this remarkable episode

LAST CENTURY OF ARSACID RULE
in Parthian history took place in exactly the same year as that of another decisive event in the career of the prophet Mani. For according to al-Blruni, Mani received his first religious revelation, in his thirteenth year, and in the year 539 "of the astronomers of Babylon", which is the same as 539 of the Seleucid era. Mani claimed to be a descendant of a Parthian princely family; and his syncretic religious doctrine, containing elements of Mandaean belief, Iranian cosmogony, and even echoes of Christianity, may be regarded as a typical reflection of the mixed religious doctrines of the late Arsacid period, which the Zoroastrian orthodoxy of the Sasanians was soon to sweep away. The new creed can in some senses be visualized as a monument to the memory of the vanished dynasty, and it appears that several of the Sasanian kings regarded Mani as a source of danger to their line. It maythus be admissible to speculate that a connection existed between the abortive Arsacid restoration at Seleucia in A.D. 228/9 an<^t n e revelation which descended upon the youthful Mani at that time. The young prophet may well have been impressed at this desperate attempt to restore the ancient dynasty, and have then resolved to found a worldwide movement which would reassert Arsacid values in the spiritual sphere. Many years were to pass before the new creed was expounded in developed form, but Manichaeism canbe seen as one of the last manifestations of Arsacid thought, its tinge of profound pessimism related to that dynasty's loss of power. At the same time, the Manichaean scriptures have preserved to modern times, amongst their rich and varied linguistic heritage, evidence for the vocabulary and pronunciation ofthe Parthian language. These features are masked in the official Arsacid script by its complex ideographic writing system. In Babylonia, therefore, Manichaeism appears as the last heir of the Parthian tradition, though Armenia too preserved its legacy of Arsacid influence.

CHAPTER 3
IRANIANS IN ASIA MINOR
A fragment by an Athenian tragedian of the late 5 th or early 4th centuries speaks of maidens from Lydia and Bactria together, worshipping the Tmolian goddess Artemis to the sound of a flute, welcoming the deity like a guest with a Persian melody.1 The Tmolian goddess is most likely Anaitis, often referred to as the Persian Artemis, since Hypaipa, one of the centres of worship of Anaitis in Lydia, lay on the slopes of Mount Tmolus.2 Bactria, at the other end of the dominions of the Achaemenians on the Oxus, was also an important centre of the worship of Anaitis. Poets in Athens and presumably individuals in Lydia imagined Lydian maidens worshipping the same goddess as maidens at the end of the inhabited world. Thinking this way meant fitting local customs and even local thoughts into a wider whole which may have been perceived as in some sense living organization was not merely a matter of roads and fast postal service. The deities of the Persians ranged throughout the dominions of the Achaemenians. Darius in the Bisitun inscription refers often to his rule's relation to Ahuramazda. This sense of belonging to a whole, which stretched to theends of the inhabited world, also finds expression in the custom of Persians of sacrificing for the king and for all Persians but not for themselves (Herodotus 1. 131).
The appearance of the Persian goddess Anahita in Asia Minor represents part of a change taking place throughout the dominions of the Achaemenians, not the introduction of something traditionally Iranian into new territories. The worship of Anahita appeared everywhere within the empire at about the same time, probably on the initiative of the Achaemenians in the late 5 th and early 4th centuries. Berossus says Artaxerxes II (404-358 B.C.) had cult statues of Anahita put up in Sardis, Babylon, Damascus, Susa, Ecbatana, Persepolis, and Bactria a statement confirmed for most of these cities by independent evidence. The Anahita cult probably represents a fundamental change in Iranian religion. For Anahita is the first and only Iranian goddess depicted for

purposes of cult. Ahuramazda is depicted earlier in the 5 th century reliefs, but this is forthe purposes ofnarrative, not worship. Anahita worship is often found in association with temples. Berossus himself does not say specifically that the images ofthe goddess were exhibited in temples, butlater sources speak of Anahita in a temple. The fire ritual too appears in its distinctive form at about the same time and often enough in connection with Anahita to argue a relationship. Earlier reliefs show the Great King praying to Ahuramazda before a flaming altar. Later, the Great King appears oncoins without Ahuramazda, dressed in the costume of a fire priest and praying directly to a fire.1 Herodotus (1. 131-2) appears to confirm the date of these changes as being late in the 5 th or in the 4th century, forhesays the Persians had neither temples nor cult images ofthe gods. Further, he mentions neither Anahita nor the distinctive fire worship, although he does say the Persians regard natural phenomena like wind, fire, water,the sun, the earth asholy.
Artaxerxes IPs decision to give one of the Iranian gods tangible form may have been a response to the Greeks, who commonly represented their gods incult images; as Herodotus (1. 135) remarks, the Persians did not fear to learn from others. The aim may also have been simply to direct theattention of Iranians andnon-Iranians throughout the Achaemenian dominions to the Persian gods. Butin a sense this strengthening andunfolding of Iranianism, almost of Iranian consciousness - for that is what Persian gods mean - brought with it, at least in western Asia Minor, a strengthening of Hellenism as well as Iranianism, since thevisual language in which the goddess Anahita was portrayed was Greek. Thus she is often difficult to distinguish from Artemis and has to be qualified as the Persian Artemis. It was almost as ifthe Greeks had made atleast one of the gods of the Persians visible. There is an epitaph from north-east Caria which invokesthe gods ofthe Greeks and the Persians, Qeol 'EAArjvtov KOI Ylepaa>v.2
In fact, this istrue ina more general sense. One cannot speak about the Iranians inAsia Minor without speaking about the Greeks, that is without understanding what Greeks and Persians had incommon,for they were enemies who respected each other. Respecting your enemies means experiencing what you have in common with them as well as your differences. We think of hubris as a typically Greek conception,but

Aeschylus and Herodotus assumed the Persians knew hubris, and they could thus treat Persian outrages, such as Xerxes' treatment of the dead body ofLeonidas (Herodotus vn. 238), asoutrages, and not as actions inherently Persian. Aeschylus set Persae at Ecbatana, and saw and had
his audience see theGreek victory through the eyes of the Persians.1 The Greeks also sensed that monarchy (not necessarily the monarchy of the Achaemenians) was as much rooted inthe nature of things as was the polis, "the self-governing community of free, landowning citizens equal before the law".
As a result of this experience of what they did and did not have in common, much ofwhat we know about Persia and almost everything we know about Iranians inAsia Minor comes from Greek sources. For in animportant sense, and with the exception of the Great King,the Persians did not speak: they rode, they shot, and they did not tell lies, which meant that they kept their promises of obedience to their superiors. TheGreeks were fascinated and astonished by the outlandish grandeur of the Persians, with its successes and failures,but they also sensed in it a pathetic quality and sawits extraordinary tendency toentangle all but the best ofthe Persians inillusion and selfdestruction. They learned this from Herodotus in the gathering storm of the Peloponnesian war. It helped to open their eyes to their own extravagance, which, though different, was as self-destructive as that
of the Persians. Lydia with its fertile plains in the Hermus Valley and the important city ofSardis, atwhich the Royal Road ended, was an important centre of Persian influence in Asia Minor. In addition to the sanctuary in Hypaipa, there were sanctuaries of Anaitis in Hierakome (renamed Hierocaesareia inthe 1st century A.D.) and Philadelphia. The Hyrcanian plain, which according to Strabo (XIII. 4. 13) took its name from Persian settlers brought from Hyrcania, and the plain of Cyrus, both near Sardis, betoken Persian settlements in the area, anarea later to be settled by Macedonian soldiers. Pontus andLydia appear to be the chief centres for the worship of the Persian gods in Asia Minor. As late as the 2nd century A.D., Pausanias (5. 27. 5-7) could report witnessing something resembling the Persian fire ceremony at Hierocaesareia and Hypaipa.

Ergeli, the site of Dascylion, the satrap's palace, has recently been identified.1 In his description of the site in antiquity, Xenophon (Hellenica iv. i. 15-16) wondered at thenumber of villages around it. He also mentions a hunting park (TrapdSeicros) and remarks on the abundance of wildlife outside as well as within. Apparently these parks, which left their mark on thememories of the natives, turned a traditional part of the Iranian wayof life into a convention, just as the 19th-century parks of Frederick Law Olmsted in theUnited States carefully re-evoked thewilderness. The Iranian aristocracy apparently preferred hunting and riding inspecial preserves rather than inthe open country. For them hunting and riding were no longer an economic necessity but a way ofdefining themselves. In some sense, they sawthe basis of their nobility andauthority in swiftness of movement - skill in horsemanship and archery like that oftheir ancestors - and in loyalty to their superiors. With nocity (in the Greek sense) nearby, this palace and hunting park surrounded by villages must have looked to the Iranians like Persia in miniature - a copy on a small scale of a world made up notof cities but of palaces andvillages andoccasional citylike agglomerations.
Several important reliefs ofthe 4th and 5 th century have been found in the neighbourhood of Dascylion. One of them, a tombstone, appears to offer a view into the hunting park described by Xenophon: a Persian nobleman riding at full gallop is about to spear a boar.2 He wears the long, close-fitting pants and the long-sleeved tunic and tiara (hat) which identify the Persian nobleman in Greek art before Alexander. Themost important of these reliefs shows the Magi or UvpatOoi, the fire-kindlers, at the fire ritual, perhaps about to sacrifice.3 Four hundred years older than Strabo's (xv. 3.15) description of the fire ritual, the relief appears to have been made toillustrate it. It shows two figures with their mouths andjaws covered by the tiara, which

Strabo describes aslong enough to reach down tothe jaws and cover the lips. It is difficult to tell whether they areholding clubs, which Strabo says they use forsacrifice in Cappadocia, or sacred bundles of twigs (barsman). Thereliefs on three additional grave steles found recently at Dascylion also betray a Persian ambience: eight-spoked wheels with nails on the edges as at Persepolis; long chitons instead of the short chitons of Greek servants; dressed cup-bearers instead of the naked Greek cup-bearers; more servants; a woman wearing the headdress reserved for Persian royalty. Also and more importantly, for it shows thecontrast between a monarchical and aristocratic world, funeral banquets onthese stones centre onone individual, not on the groups ofdiners asin contemporary Greek work. Another reflection ofPersia inminiature appears on a relief from the tomb of an Iranian prince or governor of the most important city in Lycia, Xanthus. The Harpy Tomb (now atthe British Museum) shows a Greek-Lycian version of audiences depicted at Persepolis. Instead of a miniaturized official before the Great King asat Persepolis, aboy offers acock and arhyton of wine to the enthroned governor.1 Common to Greeks, Lycians, and Persians, this ritual gesture of offering had a different significance for each. All saw the same thing and understood it differently - but not differently enough to beunaware that there were other ways of understanding what they saw. For a Greek thescene might depict the worship of a hero; fora Persian, anaudience before the Persian governor of Xanthus, faintly reminiscent ofthe audiences before theGreat King in Persepolis. These portrayals of Persia on a small scale reflect in their physical dispositions thespiritual ideal of maintaining promises of obedience to superiors; everyone expected from those below him what he granted those above him. Greek craftsmen appear to have done all this work forPersian patrons - with the exception of objects found in graves andseal rings (impressions of many of which were found at Dascylion), which are of Persian manufacture.
Wall paintings intwo tombs recently discovered (1969) on the edges of Lycia inthe Plain ofElmali, the first of about 525 B.C.,the second of the early 5 th century, tell something more about Greek eyes witnessing a Lycian world coming to know the presence of Persia. Thefirst

betrays nota hint of Persia; thesecond, roughly a generation later, shows a reclining mandrawn with wondrous clarity and daring, probably not an important Persian official, but nevertheless with something distinctly Persian about him. His servants approach him carrying vessels of the same sort and in the same way asthe tributaries onthe stairways at the Apadana at Persepolis, buttheir hands unmistakably betray Greek eyes. Elsewhere in thefrieze theindividual wears the tiara, long purple pants and a long-sleeved tunic which, whatever else it is, is not Greek. There isa battle scene full ofmovement and clarity in which Greeks are losing toPersians, or to Lycians who affect Persian styles. Greek artists could paint their own defeat as ifit were the defeat
of others. In Lydia, where Sardis was thesite of the most important Persian satrapy, there are fewer visual traces ofthe Persians than inthe region about Lake Manyas and inLycia. Only items connected with dress and court life remain: jewelry, gold, silver, glass vessels, rich cloths. There is also a pediment inGreek style, ofthe middle ofthe 5 th century B.C., showing the funeral banquet of a Persian. (Mesopotamian but probably not Persian, the motif of the funeral banquet seems to have won currency among Persians and people associated with Persian administration in Asia Minor, for it appears on one of the recently found reliefs at Dascylion.) Concentrating onorganization, roads and horse relays, and living apart from thenatives, thePersians appear to have been content toletothers depict them.1
For the Persians in Asia Minor, as perhaps everywhere, the fall of Achaemenians meant crisis. Even in areas such as Caria, farfrom the beaten tracks of armies andmerchants andenjoying relative independence from Persia, the Iranian aristocracy had to come to terms with the new circumstances. In thelittle polis of Amyzon high upin the mountains of north-west Caria, a decree from the time of Philip Arrhidaeus, half-brother andsuccessor of Alexander, adopts a man called Bagadates and his son, Arieramnes, ascitizens and on the advice of the oracle at Delphi, appoints Bagadates priest of the local indigenous

goddess who is called Artemis. The priesthood was apparently hereditary, for about a hundred and twenty years later a decree (of the timeof Antiochus III) mentions anArieramnes aspriest of the local Artemis. These are Iranian names. In this instance, anIranian aristocratic family won citizenship ina Greek polis and at the same time gained an official position as priests of a sanctuary.l In Apamea on theMeander a man called Maiphernes appears as an official of the mint sometime in the next centuries.2 Here, too, a descendant of the Iranian aristocracy had continued to play an official role. However in some cities in northeastern Caria Iranian names scattered among the local population appear to indicate that thedescendants of Persian settlers hadin the generations become integrated with the local population.3
In the perspective of the Trojan War and earlier which Asia Minor suggested to him, Strabo minimized the differences between the Achaemenian and Macedonian conquests ofAsia Minor; but they were in important ways different. The dominion ofthe Achaemenians lasted two hundred and fifty-years; Alexander's lasted much less than his short life anddid not extend beyond it. In the Blsitun inscription, Darius hadspoken loftily of his ability to overcome usurpers in the strength of Ahuramazda. Alexander's conquest provoked instability, even a revolutionary atmosphere8 robbers sacked thetomb of Cyrus at Persepolis when Alexander was absent in India; thesuspicion and insecurity was such that men wondered whether the satraps had violated the tomb (Strabo xv. 3.7). After thedeath of Alexander, theMacedonians turned upon themselves. From the outermost parts of Iran, Greek commanders came to the battle grounds in Asia Minor. In contrast to Alexander, who had not been able to ensure hissuccession, the Persians had lived under a hereditary monarchy and esteemed legitimacy of descent - a fact which Strabo thought worthy of mention (xv. 3. 17). One of the most important consequences of this confusion wasthe emergence (about 305 B.C.) of two independent monarchies, one in Cappadocia and the other inPontus, which claimed and were believed by their subjects to be descended from theAchaemenians. The mere existence of these monarchies testifies to thedepth of the Iranization which had occurred under the Achaemenians. Instead of adapting

themselves to changed circumstances, like the Iranians in Caria and probably throughout western Asia Minor, the Iranian aristocracy east of the Halys River in Pontus and Cappadocia chose independence in defiance of the Macedonians. TheCappadocians hadresisted from the beginning. After the defeat ofthe Persian satraps onthe River Granicus, the Cappadocians fought at Arbela in 331. Unlike Sinope and Amisos on the coast of Pontus, they did not come to terms with Alexander after this battle but rose up in his rear. Until the fall of the Persian monarchy, the Iranian presence had probably been asintense in Asia Minor west of the Halys asit had been in Pontus and Cappadocia. With the victory of Alexander and the emergence of the Hellenistic kings, it begins slowly to fade in the west. Writing in the time of Augustus, Strabo only knew of traces ofthe Persians in western Asia Minor, buthe considered Cappadocia almost a living part of Persia (xv. 3. 15). Iranization in Pontus and Cappadocia meant the preservation of great temple estates which had in many instances existed before the arrival of the Medes in the early 6thcentury. Comana inPontus had,for instance, been a holy region in the time of the Hittites. Thepast, not only the Iranian past but the past of the first millennium before the coming of the Medes in the early 6th century and even of the late 2nd millennium, rose before one's eyes inthese lands. Strabo's descriptions of the temple estates arefull of wonder andastonishment. Even though they must have been part of his boyhood knowledge - for he was from Amasia in Pontus - he did not take them for granted and found himself (xi. 14.16) turning to Herodotus' description of temple prostitution to understand the customs at the temples of Pontus, Cappadocia, and Armenia. He speaks of Cappadocia as having many temples of the Persian gods and many fire priests. But it is important to remember that there were other religious centres in Cappadocia and Pontus, many of them of greater antiquity than those of Anaitis. In these regions where there were fewcities (except those cutofffrom the interior on the coasts of Pontus) these sanctuaries served as centres; pilgrims came to them from everywhere throughout Cappadocia and Pontus and from Armenia - betraying the deeper unity of regions recently divided politically.
In regard to those temples which owned large estates - Strabo (XII. 2. 3) speaks of more than sixthousand temple servants at Comana in Cappadocia - it is often difficult to distinguish the Iranian element

from the indigenous. Even in the instance of temple prostitution, usually associated with either indigenous orSemitic influence, Wikander points out that it is not byany means clear that Iranian ritual excludes it.1
In each of the Comanas, Strabo refers to thechief priest as " second after theking" (Strabo xn. 2.3; 3.32; Caesar, De hello Alexandrino 66), adding in the case of Comana in Cappadocia that heusually came from the royal family. Found most frequently in Latin andGreek authors, these words, in appearance a mere phrase, actually are a translation of an Iranian title in use among the Sasanians, the Parthians, and the Achaemenians. Under theAchaemenians, they designated theheir of the king, later probably simply those who were second in authority to the king. All this would appear to argue Iranian influence onthe shrine of the national goddess of Cappadocia, Ma.2 In the second millennium in a region later called Pontus, however, a Hittite king used the title when he consecrated his son Priest of Tesup.8
Unlike many of the other holy centres in these regions whichhad been sacred forcenturies, Zela appears tohave been consecrated forthe first time as a sanctuary of the Persian gods, especially Anaitis, by Artaxerxes II. By Strabo's time, it had long been atemple with authority over much land and many holy servants (UpoSovXot). With rites of surpassing holiness, it exercised spiritual authority throughout Pontus; men came from everywhere to make oaths on matters of crucial importance inthe sanctuary ofthe Persian gods at Zela (Strabo xn. 3.37). That the Persian gods guaranteed men's words says something for the moral authority of the Achaemenians and their gods in Pontusand Cappadocia. Thepriests of these sanctuaries acted with great independence. In the time of the independent kings of Cappadocia the Priest ofComana also bore the title ofgeneral (oTparrjyos) and governor of the King.4
Besides thesanctuaries at Zela and in Armenia in Acilisene (modern Ekeleac), Anaitis probably held other sanctuaries with land and temple servants in Cappadocia andPontus. A recently published inscription points to theexistence of such a sanctuary in thearea of Cappadocia south-east of the Salt Lake, forty or fifty kilometres north of Aksaray

(ancient Archelais). Flavia Prima dedicates tothe most powerful goddess, Anaitis Barzochora, three individuals and their heirs as temple servants for life. One of the newly dedicated servants bears an indigenous name.1 The hereditary status of much temple service helps to explain its persistence. The authority that these shrines exerted was spiritual rather than legal; for violations they threatened death or disease to the desecrator orhis livestock. The status of the temple servants differed importantly from that ofGreek slaves. Antiochus ofCommagene forbade any priest or magistrate or dynast (meaning probably the Iranian aristocracy) from enslaving or maltreating or exacting liturgies from the
temple servants and their heirs.2 When Pompey (Strabo xn. 3. 34) appointed apriest-governor of the sanctuary at Comana in Pontus with authority over other adjoining lands, heexpressly forbade the sale of the temple servants. Inaddition to such guarantees against abuse from magistrates of cities, priests, and barons, the temple servants could, unlike slaves in Greece, hold land either by renting sacred land or through sharecropping agreements. Since their status was beyond the law, it depended tosome extent on the spiritual authority of the shrine and itsspiritual sanctions. Such arrangements were meant to lastfor ever; that is why thestatus of temple servants at Commagene was conceived as exceptional. The primary unit throughout the Achaemenian dominions was the village. Posidonius observed (Strabo xi. 9. 1) that there were two thousand villages in Rhagae in Media. Classical authors spoke of ten thousand cities inBactria, but Soviet excavations show these cities to
be armed villages.3 These villages were gathered into groups for taxation purposes. Such village organization was.also characteristic of Asia Minor, especially of Pontus and Cappadocia in the Achaemenian period, and persisted in the Hellenistic period. A large part of Asia Minor remained without cities inthe Hellenistic period. InPontus there were few cities except onthe coast. In Cappadocia there were three cities: Tyana, Mazaca, and Hanisa.

they stayed in fortified places. Appian (De bello Mithridatico 65) reports that Murena destroyed four hundred villages in one raid. The fertile
plain outside Amasia was called the plain of a thousand villages.1 Many of these villages had their ownsanctuaries. As Libanius put it (Pro templis9), "Destroy thesanctuary of a village and it grows blind and
lives no more."2 In the time ofthe Achaemenians, two things ofimportance happened in Pontus: an Iranian aristocracy and the Persian gods entered the land, and theGreek cities were founded along thecoast. In theHellenistic centuries, both the process ofIranization and Hellenization continued in different ways in both Cappadocia and Pontus. In Cappadocia, Hellenization started slowly in the 3rdcentury andquickened in the 2nd. InCappadocia the first coinage under Ariarathes, who ruled while Alexander was still alive, was inAramaic, the imperial language of the Achaemenians. But already in the long reign of Ariaramnes (about 280-230 B.C.) the first coinage appears with Greek inscriptions, showing
the monarch in Persian dress.3 Different from what hadoccurred in the 5 th and4th centuries in western Asia Minor, where Persian and Greek elements almost fused, as in the Tomb of the Harpy at Xanthus, this juxtaposition of Greece and Persia is characteristic of the whole of life in the independent monarchies. The organization of the state and its titles in Cappadocia
and Pontus were modelled after those of the Hellenistic monarchies.4 The Greek ofthe chancelleries was asgood asthat anywhere else; but the kings and the aristocracy probably still thought inPersian orin the local languages. Mithridates Eupator, who hadbeen brought up in Greek, sought to learn all thelanguages spoken in his kingdom, in
itself enough to doaway with the notion that hewas a Greek king.5
Under theSeleucids theGreek elite and the Iranian aristocracy and the local notables lived side by side in two different worlds thathad
little to do with each other.6 But in Cappadocia, in Pontus, inCom

magene, and in Parthia, whose kings attended performances of the Bacchae, one has the sense that the men who inherited the responsibilities of leadership lived in both the Greek and the Iranian world, just as they spoke and thought in both languages - unlike the Greeks, who did not learn foreign languages. These rulers needed Greek and Hellenism in order to be independent kings rather than chiefs, and to enter the world of international politics. They needed Persian and the local languages in order to remember who they were, that is to survive. They went from one world to the other but did not entertain illusions they could do without either or that the two worlds could meet and amalgamate. In some sense, thereal drama of the Hellenistic world occurred among those rulers who had resisted Macedonian dominion. As with so many other things, it took the Roman Republic tobring this drama to ripeness; it was from these kings, not from the Hellenistic kings, that there came thelast men who dared stand up to the Roman Republic before she destroyed herself, Mithridates Eupator of Pontus and Orodes ofParthia. Neither Cappadocia nor Pontus were lands which attracted Greek and Macedonian settlers. Greeks were city men; they did not move into the country. As a result, Hellenization in lands like Pontus and Cappadocia meant the natives Hellenized themselves. There is an inscription perhaps from the 2nd century B.C. from Hanisa near Mazaca in Cappadocia. This isclearly aGreek polis with a constitution, a council and anassembly, and the rule of law. The inscription, in fact, deals with a legal question: the city's claim toinherit from a man who dies without heirs. This city is nota new foundation butrather an old agglomeration existing from well into the 2nd millennium, that transformed itself into a polis. The names of some of the city magistrates are indigenous; the name of the royal overlord is Iranian. It was the natives
who had turned themselves into Greeks.1 Perhaps this transformation occurred during the regin of Ariarathes V Phihellene, who had studied in Athens with Attalus IIIand who celebrated Greek games in Cappadocia with athletes and Dionysiac artists invited from Athens.He may have refounded both Mazaca, which Strabo (xn. 2.9) says had a constitution designed by Charondas, and Tyana, naming them both Eusebeia.

Antiochus I, king of fertile Commagene (about 69-34 B.C.) spoke of combining the Persian, Macedonian gods, and the local gods, andthe
Persian andGreek andlocal traditions.1 At thesame time he called himself friendly to the Romans; instead of alternating between the Greek and the Iranian world, hetried to treat them asif they couldbe translated into each other. Inthis sanctuary, built tohold his "blessed" body after ithad sent forth his god-favoured spirit into the surrounding skies of Ahuramazda, Antiochus displayed his paternal Iranian ancestors descended from the Achaemenians and his maternal ancestorswho came down from Alexander. Byhispiety anddevotion he sought to turn his inherited kingdom into the abode of all the gods and he worshipped their statues in thetime-honoured fashion of the Greeks and the Persians, aswell aswith the sacrifices and festivals which were the custom ofall men from time immemorial. Hespoke in Greek,but he and his ancestors wore Iranian dress, and he specified that the priests of his sanctuary should dress in thePersian fashion. He worshipped Ahuramazda but called him also Zeus and Mithra, whom he identified with Apollo, theancestral godof the Seleucids. Under the shadow of Rome (Vespasian was to turn Commagene into a Roman province in 72 A.D.), Antiochus sought to create a sanctuary of the gods ofthe Persians inthe manner ofthe Achaemenians three hundred years earlier, andat the same time to acknowledge the gods of the Greeks and the Hellenistic kings. In short, hemeant'to beallthings to all men - and allgods. And it was more than anybody could do. Itis his lack of sense of proportion that is most striking - and most revealing, especially when it most looks like boldness: "Antiochus was in the grip of a vision whose devastating power and unity canbe sensed in everything he touched. Sculpture, architecture, the use of natural features, the ordering of the cult speak with the same voice as the inscriptions, of a man possessed by the dissonant tongues of Persia and Greece, and dedicated to the service of five outlandish demons - Zeus-Oromasdes, Apollo-Mithra-Helios-Hermes, Artagnes
Heracles-Ares, his beloved Commagene, and himself."2

The decisive event in thehistory of eastern Asia Minor is Pompey's defeat in 62 B.C. of Mithridates Eupator, King of Pontus, and his allies, which included the kings of Cappadocia and Commagene. For forty years Mithridates hadcarried on much more than a local war. He had co-ordinated his fighting with various crises in Italy and therest of the Roman world. Because heunderstood his struggle inworld-wide terms (that is, in terms of the Mediterranean), Mithridates foresaw his defeat would mean the spread of Roman power from the Ocean to Pontus. But this did not occur immediately after 62 B.C. : it took something like a century for theeffects of the Roman victory in 62B.C. to show themselves to be irreversible.
After the defeat of Mithridates noking held sway over the lands and peoples which Mithridates hadled. Rome annexed part of Pontus; in other parts it recognized the rule of dynasts and independent cities. Some years after Pompey's settlement a monarchy arose in eastern Pontus which survived until A.D. 64.In contrast to Pontus the kings in Cappadocia and Commagene survived; after 62 B.C. as clients but not satellites of Rome they depended to some extent on Rome's endorsement. On suspicion or pretext - the reasons are not entirely clear - that the king of Cappadocia was conspiring with the king of Parthia, Tiberius annexed Cappadocia in A.D. 14. In A.D. 64 Rome annexed eastern Pontus. Forthe first time sheruled thewhole southern shore of the Black Sea up to the Caucasus. Intent on asserting his own authority and theauthority of Rome both at home and abroad after the victory in the civil war which had made him emperor, Vespasian allowed hiscommander in Syria to attack andannex Commageneand Armenia Minor in A.D. 72.Hisintent appears to have been tofixthe Roman frontier onthe Euphrates. The dynasties which claimed descent from theAchaemenians were no more.
Rome's direct assertion of her rule over eastern Asia Minor brought the West closer to these lands. Impressed bythedifficulty of supplying troops during the Armenian War of 5 8-64, Vespasian and his successors had roads built in Pontus and Cappadocia so that the troops on the Euphrates could be easily supplied. Without rulers claiming descent from the Achaemenians Cappadocia, Pontus and Commagene still experienced something like cultural unity with deeply Iranized Armenia and with Parthia. But without political expression this culture probably
grew to misunderstand itself.1

CHAPTER 4
THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF
IRAN UNDER THE SASANIANS
THE RISE OF THE SASANIANS
The rise of the Sasanian dynasty can be understood as the successful struggle of a minor ruler of Persis (today Fars province) not only against his Parthian overlord, but also against a multitude of neighbouring rulers. Unfortunately, our knowledge of the pre-Sasanian history of Persis is almost a total blank save for what is known from coins struck by local dynasts. At least one local kingdom had existed in the heart of Persis since the breakup of Seleucid power in Iran, if not earlier, from shortly after the death of Alexander theGreat. ^ The ruins of Persepolis and Pasargadae alone would have been a standing reminder of the past glory of the area, even if knowledge of a great empire for the most part had been forgotten.2 The names (such as Darius and Artaxerxes) on the coins of the local rulers whoheld sway here before the rise of the Sasanians testify to a certain continuity of Achaemenian traditions, if not to an actual descent in a side line from the royal Achaemenian family itself. The history of the immediate predecessors of Ardashlr is thus virtually unknown and the few items of information about them are conflicting.
Most scholars have assumed, following the Arabic history by Tabari, that Sasan was thegrandfather andPapak thefather of Ardashlr, founder of the Sasanian dynasty. The trilingual inscription (Greek, Parthian and Middle Persian) of Shapur I, on the Ka'ba-yi Zardusht at Naqsh-i Rustam, however, does not saythat Sasan was the father of Papak.3 In an ascending order of importance, Sasan is merely designated as a lord, while Papak is a king. Ardashlr, his son, is called

2 E. Yarshater argues for thetotal loss of the memory of the Achaemcnians assuch in the course of the Parthian period; see "Were the Sasanians heirs to the Achaemenids?" in La Persiaml Medioevo (Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Rome, 1971), pp. 517-31.
3 There is still no complete and adequate edition and translation of the three texts(the Middle Persian original, and the Parthian and Greek versions). A. Maricq, "Res gestae divi Saporis", Syria, xxxv (1958), 295-360, edited and translated the Greek text with excellent notes on the other versions and on the inscription as a whole.



RISE OF THE SASANIANS
king of kings ofIran, while Shapur, son of Ardashir, is called kingof kings of Iran and non-Iran. There is another version of the lineageof Ardashir found inastory in the Middle Persian book, the Kdr-ndmag or "Book of Deeds of Ardashir son of Papak". The same version is also given byFirdausi inhis epic the Shdh-ndma and appears tobethe basis of a scurrilous Greek adaptation of thetale recorded by Agathias, a sixth-century Byzantine author. This story tells how Sasan was married to the daughter of a local prince Papak after the latter learned that Sasan had royal Achaemenian blood in him. From this union Ardashir was born. Then Sasan vanishes from the story and Papak is considered the father of Ardashir. This corresponds to theinscription and other later Arabic and NewPersian sources. The problem is, who was Sasan ?
One should note that Shapur's inscription does not give us the answer and forlack ofanother course, one may choose between the versionof the epic, and the statement ofTabari that Sasan was the father ofPapak. Tabarl's account, however, is suspect, since he reports a lengthy genealogy of Ardashir tracing itback to mythical, heroic kings of ancient Iran. It is more likely that Sasan was a remote ancestor of Ardashir whose name wasgiven to the dynasty as Achaemenes wasfor the Achaemenids. Most plausible, however, is the epic version which may have the following interpretation: Sasan was the natural father of Ardashir, but he died shortly after the birth of his son whereupon, according to current Zoroastrian practice, Papak adopted Ardashir as his own son; orthe adoption may have occurred after a certain Shapur, Papak's son, was killed.
In anycase, King Papak probably united much of Fars under his
sway during the hectic time of the Parthian sovereign Vologeses IV1 (192-207) when Septimius Severus invaded Mesopotamia and wrought havoc there. About the year 205 (or possibly 208 according to another reckoning), if we may accept this date from an inscription of Shapur on a pillar from hiscapital at Bishapur, which gives thedate 5 8 with no indication ofany era, something happened which started a Sasanian
chronology.2 Because wehave no sources, one canonly guess at the event in Fars which led to this dating. Perhaps Papak overthrew a ruler of Stakhr at that time, or he may have decided to proclaim his

(1936), 123-9.



IRAN UNDER THE SASANIANS
independence of the Parthians at that date. Since the same inscription also mentions two other ways ofdating, the fortieth year ofthe fire of Ardashir and thetwenty-fourth year of the fire of Shapur, theconjecture that the year 58 had something to dowith Papak, rather than with Ardashlr's rise to the governorship of a city, or the like, is eminently plausible.1 This political interpretation is also more likely than anyother, such as a religious act connected with the shrine dedicated toAnahita at Stakhr, with which the early Sasanians seem to have been closely connected.2 The custom of establishing a fire temple, at least kindling a new fire at the accession of a new ruler, may have existed in Parthian times. The fire of the Sasanian monarch was extinguished atthe end ofhis reign, a symbolic as well as religious act. In any event, a Sasanian system of dating from the year ofPapak did not spread; rather the old method of dating bythe regnal years of a king, or the Seleucid calendar, beginning with the year 312 B.C., became usual.
The events preceding Ardashlr's victory over Ardavan, the last of the Parthians, in c. 224, may be reconstructed from brief notices in later Islamic sources. There is a possibility that the Parthian king Vologeses IVdefeated Papak, after the latter's revolt, and forced him to return to Parthian allegiance, at least fora time.3 It is unlikely that Papak extended his rule much beyond central Fars, andmost conquests even there may have been the work of Ardashir. The date of Papak's death is unknown, but before that he was succeeded by his eldest son Shapur, who probably was killed accidentally after a very short rule. Ardashir, whose relationship to Papak we have already mentioned, became king, probably about 216, and began toexpand his realm into Kirman inthe east and Elymais to the west. The overthrow ofthe Parthians seems to have been the result of a coalition headed byArdashir, since the Syriac Chronicle ofArbela says that the rulers of Adiabene and Kirkuk joined Ardashir in a crusade against the Parthians which was successful.4 The date of the battleof Hormizdagan, in which Ardavan was killed, cannot be determined satisfactorily because ofthe uncertainty ofthe entire chronology of the early Sasanians. There arenow at least two schemes of chronology for theearly

Sasanians, both of which are plausible. It is impossible to discuss here the vast literature relating to such questions as the difference between accession to the throne and coronation, the Babylonian practice of counting the accession year from new year's day, thedeath of Mani, andthelike. Fortunately, thetwo positions have been well summarized by their two major proponents, S. H. Taqizadeh and W. B. Henning.1 In short, they arethe following.

Ardashir's first regnal year began Accession to the throne Shapur's first year began Shapur's crowning His death Death of Man! Death of Bahrain I

28 April 224 23 Sept. 239 12 April 240 May 270

A difference ofthree years exists throughout. The discovery ofa Greek codex onthe life of Man! seems to resolve this discrepancy, but problems still remain. The relevant passage in the codex reads as follows:
When I became twenty-four years old, inthe year inwhich the Persian king Dari-Ardashir conquered the city of Hatra, and in which King Shapur, his son, put on the greatest diadem [wascrowned] in the month of Pharmuthi, on theday of the moon, mymost blessed Lord took compassion onme,
summoned me to his grace [etc.]2
The Egyptian month and year can be calculated to show that the crowning of Shapur as co-ruler with hisfather must have taken place on 12 April 240 (first of the Babylonian month Nisan 551).The co-regency of Shapur and Ardashir seems to have lasted until early in 242. Thus we have a problem that Shapur may have had two "crownings", oneas co-regent in 240and another as sole ruler in 243, although it ismore likely that there was only one crowning in 240. After Ardashir overthrew Ardavan, his task of conquest was not ended. Thegreat Parthian feudal families, if one may use the word "feudal" in its widest connotation, either submitted to Ardashir

willingly or unwillingly, or they were in turn defeated. The family of the Karen, with their centre probably atNihavand, issaid tohave been almost exterminated save one member who fled to Armenia and founded the Kamsarakan noble family, according to an Armenian source.1 Khosrov, the Arsacid king of Armenia, certainly led an opposition to Ardashir, and Armenian tradition has it that his relative the Kushan king Vehsadjan (Vasudeva ?) supported him, whereasthe Suren and other noble Iranian families submitted toArdashir. Members of the Karen family, however, appear high on the list of notables at the court ofArdashir, as recorded inthe great inscription of ShapurI,2 which contradicts the notice inthe Armenian source above. Therefore, we may assume that gradually most of the great lords, includingthe Karen, joined Ardashir. In some areas, Ardashir installed sub-kings from his own family as rulers. Thus one son, also called Ardashir, was made king of Kirman.3 Other sons were probably installed elsewhere, and Persian governors or other officials were sent to the principalities which had submitted. Governors and kings, who were members of the Sasanian family, were shifted from one area to another according to policy or need. Although there is no evidence that Ardashir hadanydetailed and clear knowledge of the Achaemenians, thefact that he and his son Shapur carved rock-reliefs near their Achaemenian counterparts at Naqsh-i Rustam indicates a policy of cultural as well as political aggrandizement in imitation of the past. Several Roman historians assert that Ardashir consciously planned to re-establish theAchaemenian empire, and there is no reason to doubt theintention of the founder of the dynasty to create a vast empire.4 Ctesiphon, on theplains of Mesopotamia, was themain, administrative capital of the Sasanian empire, while in the summer the court moved tothe cooler highlands of the Iranian plateau. Ctesiphon wasin reality a group of towns, and they were called collectively Mahoze in Syriac or al-Mada'in in Arabic, both meaning "the cities". One of the towns was called Veh Ardashir, probably built by the first Sasanian ruler. Another was called Veh Antiok Khusrau (orRumagan), built by Khusrau I andsettled with war prisoners from Antioch, just as

Shapur I hadbuilt Gundeshapiir (see below). Thedistrict in which Ctesiphon was located was called Khusrau Shad Kavad, atleast during part of the sixth century. Khusrau II held court much of the time at Dastagird to the east of Ctesiphon. The region of Ctesiphon was a natural site for a capital since the Tigris andEuphrates approached each other there, and canals connected the two. Trade routes from the four points of the compass converged here andwealth from trade accumulated in the area of ancient Babylon and modern Baghdad. Furthermore, much of the agricultural wealth of the Sasanian empire was concentrated in Mesopotamia. Ctesiphon was exposed to attack and conquest byenemies coming down the rivers from the north-west, so from time to time certain Sasanian kings sought to establish their courts at cities more removed from danger of capture. Shapur I built Bishapur in Fars province and probably died there. Gundeshapur or Susa may have seen the court established in them for a time, butneither city could compete with Ctesiphon for economic as well as strategic reasons. Likewise Hamadan, an ancient city, was probably the summer capital sometimes, and Stakhr at others. Again both cities were toocold in winter to serve as capitals, as were most towns onthe plateau. Most of the Sasanian kings were crowned in Ctesiphon, although other ceremonies also may have occurred in Stakhr, thehome town of the dynasty in Fars province, or in Shlz, the site of the fire temple of Adhur Gushnasp inwestern Jibal. In Stakhr the site aswell as the role in history of the temple of Anahita, called the fire of AnahitArdashir and Anahit the Lady (fn'hyt'rthstr W'nhytZY MLKT) in the MP inscription of Kartir at KZ, Naqsh-i Rustam (line 8), is uncertain. Perhaps it was a royal shrine of the Sasanians, which played no important role in history after the formation ofthe empire. The extent of Ardashir's conquests cannot be determined with precision. Most of the Parthian domains, including vassal states, as we have noted, submitted to the Sasanians. According to Tabarl, in the east the kings ofthe Kushans and ofTuran submitted to Ardashir, while in the west the island and opposite coast of Bahrain were conquered.* Itis unlikely that Gilan and the Caspian Sea coast submitted to Ardashir since the name "Gilan King" appears first in the reignof Shapur, who installed his son, thelater king of kings Bahram I,as

ruler there. The Marv oasis was sufficiently important for Ardashlr to install a king with his ownname. It is unknown whether the latter was a sonor brother of the king of kings, buthe should have been a member of the royal family.1 We can only speculate that Marv was the outpost of the empire in the north-east since neither Sogdiana nor Khwarazm arementioned in anysource as ruled by Ardashlr.
THE EARLY RULERS.' THE CONFLICT WITH ROME
The main adversary of the Persians, however, was the Roman empire, and the ambitions of the first Sasanian ruler were soon countered by Rome. Ardashlr besieged Nisibis (at present Nusaybin in Turkey onthe Iraq frontier) in 230,and hisforces raided Syria and elsewhere in the Roman east. TheRomans tried to make peace with the Sasanian ruler but failed. Alexander Severus, after more fruitless negotiations with Ardashlr, set out against himin 232. Onecolumn of his army marched into Armenia to aid the Armenians, whiletwo other columns operated to thesouth. Wedo not know thecourse of events, but thenorthern column seems tohave been successful, whereas the others failed, mostly onaccount of physical hardships. In any case, Ardashlr was repulsed and Alexander Severus celebrated a triumph in Rome.2
The murder ofAlexander Severus in 235 andthe subsequent troubles in the Roman empire mayhave induced Ardashlr to attack again. The dates are uncertain, buttowards theend of his reign, probably in 238, hetook both Carrhae and Nisibis. We may surmise that notlong thereafter Ardashlr allowed his son Shapur to rule jointly with him, as coins with busts of both men suggest. Since thedates of the end of Ardashlr's reign and the accession and coronation of Shapur are disputed, we have almost five years in which certain events may be placed. One of the most important was the capture of Hatra, the trading andcaravan city inthedesert between theTigris and Euphrates. Hatra had withstood sieges of Trajan, Septimius Severus and Ardashlr. The attack of the last hadchanged theanimosity of Hatra against the Romans into analliance. Hatra mayhave been integrated into a defence system of Roman limes initiated in northern Mesopotamia by Caracalla and continued by Alexander Severus.3 At all events, Ardashlr cap

THE CONFLICT WITH ROME
tured thecity, and this may have been one event which provoked a Roman counter-thrust. Because of internal difficulties including the rapid change of emperors, the Romans could not move against the Persians forseveral years, and it was notuntil 243 that Gordian advanced against Shapur. In the meantime, Shapur had been busy, according tothe Chronicle of Arbela, in subduing the Khwarazmians and the people ofGllan on the Caspian
Sea coast.1 Whatever thechronology of events in the first years of Shapur, inhis first clash with Rome the Persians were on the defensive. Carrhae andNisibis were retaken by the Romans andthe Persians were defeated at a battle near Resaina. Some time after the battlethe praetorian prefect Timesitheus, who was the power behind the young emperor Gordian, died, presumably of illness, andwas replaced by Philip, who wasan Arab. In 244the twoarmies metin battle at Massice, or Anbar, notfar from Ctesiphon, andShapur won. After the battle, he gave anew name to the town, Peroz-Shapur or "victorious is Shapur". Theemperor Gordian either died in the battle or was murdered by his own men, and Philip became emperor.
Philip paid a ransom of 500,000 gold dinars to Shapur, according to Shapur's great inscription. He also probably agreed not to aid the Armenians against Shapur, forthe Arsacid king of Armenia was still a bitter enemy of the Sasanians. Unfortunately, information about events inArmenia islacking and we must rely on probable inferences. The Arsacid king of Armenia, according to the Armenian sources of Agathangelos and Moses ofKhorene, was called Khosrov and hewas assassinated atthe instigation ofthe Sasanian king. No dates are given, but it probably happened under Shapur rather than Ardashir, presumably about A.D. 252. The son of the Armenian king Tiridates fled to Roman territory and this is probably the reason for Shapur's decision to reopen hostilities against Rome.
In his inscription Shapur says (Parthian line 4, Greek line 10), "Caesar again lied and didwrong to Armenia, andweattacked the Roman empire". Thedate of this campaign is disputed, for both 253 and256 have partisans. A solution to theproblem may be that two campaigns have been combined into one, a preliminary raiding in 253 and a more successful expedition in 256. Inthe latter year a Roman army ofsixty thousand was destroyed atBarbalissus and Syria was laid waste. Dura Europus andthecity of Antioch were among the many

towns captured and the Christian bishop ofAntioch, Demetrianus, was one of the captives settled at a new town in Khuzistan calledVeh Antiok Shapur ("Better than Antioch [has]Shapur [built this]"), which became corrupted later into Gundeshapur. It seems that Shapur was besieging Carrhae andEdessa when the new emperor Valerian marched against him. The date ofthe battle near Edessa, when Valerian was captured by Shapur, is also disputed - either the end of 258, or 259, or some even suggest 260. The triumph of Shapur was commemorated byrock-carvings showing him onhorseback and his Roman opponent kneeling before him atNaqsh-i Rustam and at BIshapur. Shapur's forces again ravaged Syria and also invaded Cappadocia. Inthe great inscription ofShapur I the various cities taken are listed, but they were not held formore than a short period. It was less the Romans and more Odenath, the ruler ofPalmyra, who attacked detachments of the Persians causing them to retreat totheir homeland. The history ofthe next few years isclouded, for the extent ofPalmyrene successes against Shapur isunknown. We may assume that Shapur was content to rest onhis laurels and to supervise the building ofdams in Khuzistan andthe embellishment of his capital of Bishapur by his prisoners from the Roman empire.
Probably a short time after the victory over Valerian, Shapur made some changes in his empire. In Armenia after the murder of King Khosrov and the flight of Tiridates, a certain Artavazd seems to have ruled until about 262 when Shapur appointed hisown son HormizdArdashlr as great king of Armenia. Another son, also called Shapur, was king of Mesene, and he had probably succeeded his uncle Mihrshah, lord ofMesene, known from Manichaean texts.1 Athird son Varahran, or later Bahram, was king in Gilan, and a fourth son Narseh wasthe king ofthe Sakas, ruling over large territories ineastern Iran, including Sind. Several brothers of Shapur seem to have continued in the posts assigned to them by Ardashlr; oneArdashir was king of Adiabene, and another, with the same name, was king of Kirman. Amazasp, king of Georgia, was anIranian, possibly related to the Sasanian family. Many other princes and lords appear inthe notitia dignitatum^ atthe end of the great inscription of Shapur I. If we examine the extent of the empire as vaunted byShapur in his inscription, it becomes clear that much of Transcaucasia wasruled by local kings subject to him, for only in

Georgia and Armenia are names of Iranians given. In theeastthe empire extended over the "land of the Kushans up to Pashkibur (Peshawar?), andto Kashghar, Sogdiana andTashkent" (Parthian line 2,Greek line 4). Inother words, the empire included the domain of the Kushans, at least as far as the lowlands of the north-west frontier of Pakistan. Italso extended to Sogdiana and Central Asia, but did not include them. For itis likely that what Shapur meant in his inscription was that the Kushan kingdom had submitted to him, and the boundaries of that kingdom extended to Peshawar, Sogdiana, Kashghar (or possibly Kish) andTashkent. No Sasanian prince is designated as Kushanshah by Shapur, so we may infer that theruler whohad submitted retained his title, but under Sasanian suzerainty.
At the time ofthe capture ofValerian, Shapur must have been advanced inage, which may explain his apparent lack ofreaction tothe expansion of Palmyra. The king of kings must have been busy with internal matters, for weknow he took an interest in Man! and in matters ofculture and thought. He built a new city inFars province, Bishapur, where presumably artisans from the Roman empire worked, as evidenced by mosaics found there. The religious developments
during Shapur's reign are discussed elsewhere.1 The date of the death of Shapur and the accession of his son Hormizd I is subject to the same controversy as the dates of accession of Ardashlr and Shapur. Whether the date is 270 or 273, Hormizd, or HormizdArdashir as heis known from inscriptions, ruled only a little more than ayear before he died. Nothing is known of his short reign except a notice in the Arabic history of al-Tha'alibi that he waged war against the Sogdians, not improbable inview ofhis reputation for valour in
war.2 With the accession ofVarahran I, or, to use the later form of the name, Bahram, we may sense achange in the dynasty. Bahram was not the son of Hormizd, as some later Arabic and Persian writers supposed; rather hewas another son of Shapur, and hewas called the kingof Gilan, in the great inscription ofShapur I. In this inscription, Bahram was not honoured by a fire inhis name, aswere both Hormizd and Narseh. This may indicate that Bahram's mother was a lesser queen or possibly even a concubine. Narseh, king ofthe Sakas and of the east, most probably objected to the accession of Bahram II, son of BahramI,

but he certainly blamed the father, since inone instance hesubstituted his own name forthat ofBahram I on a rock-inscription of Bishapur.1 We may believe that the problem of succession to the throne had not been settled ina manner agreeable toall princes, and Narseh may have thought he should have succeeded his brothers, but we have no evidence that he revolted. When Bahram I arranged for his son Bahram II to succeed him, Narseh was surely unhappy but bidedhis time. Bahram I ruled only three years and during hisreign, Aurelian brought anend to Palmyra and re-established Roman rule inthe east. Under Bahram I the priest Kartlr, or Kerdir, continued his career of consolidating the state church, and incidentally of self-aggrandizement. He was probably the main influence inthe imprisonment and deathof Man! which took place under Bahram I.
The religious history ofthe reigns ofHormizd and the two Bahrams is dominated by the figure of Kartlr, who may have been the real power behind the throne of Bahram II. One might speculate thatthe priest used hisinfluence in securing thesuccession to thethrone for Bahram II, rather than forNarseh. The latter seems to have followed a liberal policy towards religious minorities in the empire, much like his father, Shapur, whereas theBahrams were more amenable to the wishes of the conservative Zoroastrian priesthood. Apart from his religious impact, Kartir's influence on political affairs should not be underestimated. Bahram II at the outset of his reign had to face a Roman invasion under the emperor Carus in 283. The Romans captured Ctesiphon and would have extended their conquests if the emperor had notdied in December of the same year. Peace was made, and this permitted the Romans to regain the province of Mesopotamia, which seems to have been under Persian domination since Shapur's conquests. The reason for the acceptance byBahram II of such onerous terms was possibly a revolt of Hormizd, brother of Bahram, in theeastern provinces.2 The rebel was reportedly supported by the Sakas, Kushans, and people of Gilan. We do notknow what position Hormizd held; perhaps he was a king in Khurasan, or even in Sakastan, and he may have proclaimed himself great king of the Kushans. Bahram was able to put down the revolt, and we might surmise that heinstalled his son, also

called Bahram, asthe king ofthe Sakas inplace ofthe rebel. Bahram II had several rock-reliefs cut atBlshapur and atNaqsh-i Rustam, possibly in honour of his victory over his rebel brother, or other conquests. He also had reliefs carved atGuyum and Barm-i Dilak, north and south of present Shiraz. About 288 thenew Roman emperor Diocletian placed Tiridates, an Arsacid prince who had fled to Roman domains, on thethrone of at least part ofArmenia, and Bahram by his inaction acquiesced. Probably Sasanian control had become weakened over some sections of Armenia, though Narseh, son of Shapur I may have been appointed by Bahram to rule over the country. When Bahram II died in 293, hisson Bahram III ruled for only a few months until he wasdeposed by his uncle Narseh.1 Wehave a bilingual inscription, or probably two bilingual inscriptions, of Narseh at Paikuli in modern Iraq near the Persian frontier. Unfortunately, many of the stones of the monument are missing, but some sense may bemade of what remains in spite of great lacunae. Narseh was in Armenia at the time of the death of Bahram II,either as its king, or possibly as head of a Sasanian army intent oh defeating and deposing a competitor, Tiridates. In his inscription, however, Narseh calls himself " king of kings ". Although the title inthe inscription - "king of the Armenians" - may refer to Narseh before he took the throne, it more plausibly should refer to Tiridates afterwards in the inscription. In any case, according to the inscription, a noble called Vahunam took the diadem and either for a time usurped the throne or more likely prepared theway for Bahram III,the king of the Sakas. Some of the nobility were killed and others objected to the high-handed policies of the new regime. Many nobles joined in a conspiracy to overthrow Bahram and sought the candidacy tothe throne of Narseh. He came from Armenia, probably having made peace with, andpossibly even with the support of, Tiridates. Narseh was counselled byhis new supporters to come to the border of Babylonia (Asuristan), where thesite of Paikuli was located. A caravan of notables came to him to pledge allegiance. Kartir thefamous mobad, having seen the writing onthe wall, may have been among the number who came. The fate of Vahunam andBahram III is not known, for
1 Coins of Bahram II, but with the legend " Hormizd King of Kings ", may reflectthe independence of Hormizd, brother of Bahram II, in the east, or less likely they may date from the very end of Bahram IFs rule, indicating a short reign of Hormizd after the death of BahramII.

IRAN UNDER THE SASANIANS
the first or upper inscription of Paikuli has too many lacunae at the end to reconstruct it, and they vanish from history. The second or lower inscription at Paikuli is mainly a list of rulers and lords who supported Narseh or were subject to the Sasanian monarch after his accession. Among them we find the king of the Kushans; the king of the Khwarazmians is also mentioned, indicating Sasanian suzerainty in that part of Central Asia. A certain 'Amr, king of the Lakhmids (Parthian Ihmysn), and another 'Amr, king of the Apgarids (Parthian 'pgrn'n),testify to the submission of Arab tribes to Sasanian overlordship. The latter name is enigmatic, for the last king of Edessa, or Osroene, supposedly died in Rome. Are we to suppose a continuation of a tribe called the Apgarids, somehow related to the kings of Edessa, which lay within the borders of the Roman empire? Are we to interpret the list of rulers as those who supported Narseh or those who came or sent representatives to thecoronation of Narseh, rather than direct tributaries of the Sasanian state ? Other potentates in the list include the king of Paradene and the king of Makran, both in present Baluchistan.
When we analyse this list we are struck by the multitude of lords and kings mostly from theborders of the Sasanian state. First, not one of the rulers canbe identified as a Sas-jnian prince; second, none of the important areas such as Kirman, Marv, Gilan or Meshan, where kings once ruled, according tothegreat inscription of Shapur I, is mentioned; and third, none of the great feudal families, such astheKaren or Suren, is noted. We may tentatively conclude that Narseh was supported by a host of minor rulers, while his opponent Bahram III held the allegiance of the central part of the empire. Wemayfurther suspect a consequent weakening of the position of the great nobility after the accession of Narseh. Unfortunately, our sources are silent about internal affairs during the reign of Narseh, andall is conjecture.
Narseh, once on thethrone, determined to regain territory lost to the Romans byBahram II,which mainly meant Armenia andMesopotamia. Again events in Armenia remain unclear, butTiridates was driven from his throne byNarseh in 296. About thebeginning of 297 a Roman army under Galerius, the Caesar of Diocletian in the latter's reform ofthe Roman empire, was defeated and Narseh recovered Mesopotamia. In the following year, however, Narseh lost his harem in a rout of the Sasanian army by the same Galerius in Armenia. Diocletian made peace at the request of Narseh whereby the Romans not only regained
130



THE CONFLICT WITH ROME
suzerainty over northern Mesopotamia and Armenia but obtained additional land joined to their domains in this area. Furthermore, trade between thetwo empires was to be channelled through Nisibis as the sole place of exchange, at the request of the Romans. After this defeat the Persians and theRomans remained at peace forforty years. As mentioned, internal affairs during the reigns of Narseh and his son Hormizd II areunknown, butfrom brief notices wemay infer a change from the time of the Bahrams. The religious policy of persecution of the Manichaeans, for one thing, changed to toleration under Narseh.1 This change may have been induced by Narseh's desire to secure the support of Manichaeans in the Roman empire, for in 297 in Alexandria Diocletian issued anedict against the propaganda of the Manichaeans. Wedo not know about other religious minorities, but since there areno indications of Christian martyrdoms or anti-Jewish acts from this period, we mayassume that the policy of toleration which held sway under Shapur I was resumed under Narseh. Towards the end of Narseh's reign the king of Armenia was converted to Christianity, which changed the destiny of that country, soon to become a religious ally of the Roman empire after Constantine washimself converted in 312. That Narseh was not such an ardent supporter of orthodox Zoroastrianism is indicated by a notice in al-Tha'alibl that he did not visit the fire temples.2 Other information about the reign of Narseh is lacking. Hormizd II ruled for seven years (302-9), a hard and strong man who none the less was just and well liked according to various Arabic sources. Otherwise nothing is known of his reign. A short excursus on theurban andagricultural policy of the early Sasanian rulers may help to elucidate internal affairs. Thetown-building activities of the early Sasanians arewell known. Anancient practice of moving populations from one part ofthe empire toanother was followed by Shapur I when he settled Roman prisoners in thenew towns of Gundeshapur and Bishapur. Other new foundations or at least renamings of older settlements are amply attested. Less well known, butmore significant, is theenormous expansion of cultivated land in Khuzistan, theDiyala river basin and elsewhere.3 The area of cultivated land apparently was

larger in Sasanian times than at anyperiod before or since. Archaeological evidence would indicate anenormous effort onthepart of the Sasanian government toextend and maintain a costly irrigation system, in many areas of the empire. This extension of agriculture is more impressive than the founding ofcities, forthe latter were usually small, though with strong surrounding walls, tojudge from the few archaeological surveys which have been made. With the increase of agricultural land, a meritorious actin theZoroastrian religion, the Sasanian kings also laid the basis for an increase in population. Theincrease of population over the earlier periods is difficult to assess but the archaeological evidence forexpansion is a good indication. The new Sasanian towns were laid outin a regular order, and most Sasanian settlements over both earlier and later areas of cultivated land were centres oflarger agricultural districts. The pattern oftowns inthe later eastern Islamic caliphate took itsform in the Sasanian period.
THE REIGN OF SHAPUR II!
THE CULMINATION OF SASANIAN POWER
Likewise, it would seem that many later institutions were organized, if not founded, inthe early Sasanian period. Itistrue that many scholars have discounted the later Sasanian practice ofattributing allchanges in the state or society, especially in the time of Khusrau I, to mere revivals of conditions obtaining under thefounder Ardashlr. None the less, under theearly Sasanians much of the groundwork for the future wasestablished. For example, the authority over political and economic affairs ofthe heads ofvarious religious minorities, famous as the millet system ofthe much later Ottoman empire, seems to have been organized bytheearly Sasanians, aswell as thetax system applied to minorities.1 Both theorganization of the state church and the fixing of the political andtaxstructure ofthe Sasanian state were theresults of great endeavours under theearly Sasanian rulers.
The events following thedeath ofHormizd II areobscure, but one of the sons of Hormizd, probably called Adhurnarseh, came to the throne. The nobility, however, took matters into their ownhands, deposed the king and seized some of his brothers, althoughone, Hormizd, escaped and fled totheRomans. The crown was then given to aninfant Shapur II. The fact that another sonof Hormizd II,also

THE REIGN OF SHAPUR II
called Shapur, the king ofthe Sakas, isattested intwo inscriptions from Persepolis, as well as the mention of an Ardashlr, king of Adiabene and brother of Shapur, inthe Syriac acts of Christian martyrs, suggests that there may have been two factions in thefamily of Hormizd II, and the nobles supported the one which brought topower Shapur II.1 Shapur II was to rule from 309 to 379, the longest time-period of any Sasanian king, and under his reign Iran developed greatly and expanded.
Although the nobility from time to time during the Sasanian empire showed its power, on thewhole theimportance of the ruler and the centralization of authority continued. The ultimate dependence of the bureaucracy, of the legal system, and indeed of all institutions of the state on the person of the ruler is revealed in the acts ofthe Christian martyrs, as well as inlater Arabic and Persian texts. The reign of Shapur II can be considered theculmination of the process of centralization under theearly Sasanian kings. At first, as a child, he was under the sway of the nobility, but soon Shapur was able to bring power into hisown hands with the acquiescence of the same nobility. For the supreme rights of the ruler were recognized as having precedence over all.It is interesting to compare the same tendencies in the late Roman empire, for in Byzantium thebureaucracy and centralization, as well as autocracy, could be compared easily with the Sasanian empire. We do not know whether the administrative reforms of Diocletian and Constantine had anyechoes in Iran, but most likely their spirit didhave some repercussions even though they cannot be pin-pointed.
The mechanism of succession to thethrone, and the part played by the nobility andpriesthood, may be examined briefly. Down to the end of the dynasty a member of the family of Sasan was the ruler, and theallegiance of the nobles and priests could rareJy be won by a rebel who was nota Sasanian prince. The case of Bahram Chobln (see below) was unique, andhe ultimately failed to secure thesupport of the nobility against Khusrau II. Although a strong ruler in reality would designate his own successor, and secure the support ofthe priesthood and nobility for the succession before his own death, none the less, the support of these two classes was always necessary for accession,for the crown prince had to satisfy them by his qualities of mind and

body that he was fit to rule. Almost invariably a prior demonstration of ability to rule a province wasa prerequisite for mounting the throne ofthe king ofkings. Bahram Gor had not governed a province, but byhis personal qualities hewas able to convince the aristocracy that hewas that son ofYazdgard I fit to rule. The belief that the farr or "mystical majesty" of kingship had descended ona prince would cause nobles to rally to one member of the royal family rather than another. The signs and symbols ofthe farr were many and varied, and politics undoubtedly also played an important role insecuring support for the succession.
The priesthood had to be assured that a prospective ruler would follow the Mazdayasnian faith, asthe Zoroastrian religion was called. This meant not only adherence tothe ritual and the ethics ofthe state religion, butalso to the norms ofsociety inthe class structure. In the many books ofadvice {andar^)^ and onrules ofconduct, from Islamic times inArabic and Persian, one finds the remark that inthe Sasanian era religion and state were twin sisters, and the duty ofthe ruler was to support the religion. The future rulers ofthe Sasanian empire were, of course, instructed in the worship of Ahura Mazda, and taught the requirements ofreligion, aswell asthe arts ofriding, archery and the like. Inthe years of the earlier Sasanian state the ruler appointed priests and bestowed titles onthem, but later, perhaps already by the timeof Shapiir II, the chief priest, the mobaddn-mobad, created onthe analogy of the title king of kings, took over such ecclesiastical tasks as religious appointments. The mobadan mobad also performed the act of coronation, placing a crown onthe head ofthe new ruler. Firdausl describes this frequently inthe Shah-nama.
The time andday of coronation were determined by astrologers, astronomers and soothsayers, allofwhom were important personages at any court of antiquity. The day of coronation might bepostponed a long time in waiting foran auspicious day. In any case, it did not coincide with the day ofaccession to the throne; this has caused great uncertainty in thedating of the reigns of some Sasanian rulers. The celebrations at the time of coronation included much feasting and entertainment, and the ruler presented money or precious objects tothe nobles and to the army.
Each Sasanian monarch had a distinctive crown, oreven more than
one (fig. i).1 The crown and the mace (Persian guri£) were two ofthe symbols of royalty. There is notspace here to gointo thedetails of

the coronation ceremony. Suffice it to say that traditions of kingship in the Sasanian state were both varied and ancient.
The ruler was regarded as chosen by God with a divine right torule, but this did not make him an unapproachable divine figure. Many stories are told byFirdausi about the sense of justice of the Sasanian kings. Access tothe throne by the poorest subject was an old tradition in Iran, and on festival days such as Noruz and Mihragan, theking listened tocomplaints inopen audience. The ruler was regarded as the protector and impartial judge of all of his subjects, andtheancient traditions of law in Iran can becompared with the role of law in the Roman empire. The ruler with all his power had tosubmit tothe laws as everyone else. Since the privileges of the nobility and clergy were established and accepted by all, the ruler had both to respect them and to defend them. Thus the very structure of society in Sasanian times imposed limits on the monarch's power and duties tohis subjects. The power of the rulers was great in the third century, but in the fourth, until Shapur II reached manhood, the nobility and priesthood held sway. Khusrau I, inthe aftermath ofthe Mazdakite troubles (see below), reorganized the nobility. In the 7th century the prestige and powers of the ruler had sunk so low that themonarchs were mere puppets in thehands of the nobility. Undoubtedly this contributed much tothe decline and fall ofthe dynasty, but this isa later story, and we must return to ShapurII. Among the events of Shapiir's reign were his early expeditions against theArabs of the desert, where he is supposed to have filled their wells with sand to bring them to submit.1 Shapur penetrated far into Arabia; how faris unknown. An indication oflocal recalcitrance to imperial rule was therevolt of the city of Susa later in hisreign. Shapur not only suppressed the revolt but he caused elephants to trample the remains ofthe city.2 Then he rebuilt the city with the aid of Roman prisoners, asShapur I did at Gundeshapur, and he renamed the city of Susa Iran Khwarrah Shapur ("Iran's glory [built by] Shapur"). This title was confused with a similar title given tothe town of Karkha de Ledan (the Aramaic name of the city) north of Susa, until Karkha was later renamed Iran asan kar(t) Kavad.3 Other cities were founded or refounded by Shapur II,among them Nishapur in

Khurasan. So Shapur II was a worthy successor of his namesake in his building as well as hismartial activities. It was inevitable that thenew Sasanian ruler would seek to regain territory lost to the Romans by his predecessors. Armenia wasalso involved, but, as usual, wehave no accurate details of events. In any case, it was Shapur who broke the long peace between the two empires, and the main field ofbattle was Mesopotamia. It seems that the nephew of Constantine, a certain Hannibalianus, had had some success in Armenia when Constantine died in 337. The system of fortresses andlimes erected primarily by Diocletian in the Roman province of Mesopotamia and in the Syrian desert proved to be a strong bulwark against the Persians. The Roman defences were rendered even stronger bythe roads, wells and caravansarais erected behind the forts, castles and walls, enabling soldiers, especially horsemen, to move with speed to an area of invasion. This is notthe place to discuss themilitary reforms of Diocletian and Constantine, except tosay that for the defence ofthe frontiers they provided various trained troops, which Shapur on his expeditions metto his discomfiture. Several sieges of the Roman fortress city of Nisibis ended in failure for Shapur. A number of minor battles were won or lost but nodecision was reached, and Shapur had to end operations on his western front to meet an invasion of new nomads in the east. These were the Chionites, who, to judge from their name, represented the first appearance of Hunnic peoples in the Middle East. They were probably Altaic-speaking (proto-Turkic-speaking ?) nomads mixed with Iranians, remnants ofthe Sarmatians and others, who adopted the local Kushan-Bactrian language after they settled inthe northern part of the Kushan domain in theeast. Shapur was successful in containing the Chionites, who even concluded an alliance andgave himaid inhis wars against the Romans.
After successes in theeast Shapur turned again to theRomans,his principal enemies. Fortunately we have an eyewitness account of some of the martial activities between the two empires in the history of Ammianus Marcellinus. In thef?ce of Shapur's advance a scorchedearth policy wasfollowed by the Romans, but Shapur wasable to defeat them and lay siege to the Roman fortress of Amida, present-day Diyarbakr, which he took in 359 after much difficulty. Other towns were captured and their populations taken to Khuzistan and elsewhere in theSasanian empire. The Romans took up this challenge whenthe emperor Julian ledanimpressive force against Shapur in 363. A large
137

detachment was sent to join the Armenians east of Carrhae, so both would march parallel to Julian who,with the main body of troops, descended the Euphrates river to Ctesiphon. In a combat Julian the Apostate wasmortally wounded, andafter his death thenewemperor, Jovian, found his army in a disadvantageous position. Peace wasmade by which Shapur obtained most of the former Roman possessions east of the Tigris aswell asthecities of Nisibis, Singara andothers. Armenia was also abandoned bytheRomans andwas soon conquered by Shapur who treacherously seized and blinded the king of Armenia. Pap, the son andsuccessor of the blind king, incurred theenmity of the Romans and a few years after the death of his father, Pap was killed by them. Afterwards, Shapur sought to come to an agreement over Armenia with the emperor Valens, but this was not possible until the invasion of the Goths in theBalkans near Constantinople distracted theRomans. Then theSasanians took thelion's share of Armenia, while theRomans had to be content with a small area mainly around Mount Ararat. Armenia, however, continued to remain a bone of contention between the two empires.
Under Shapur II a number of innovations appeared in the Sasanian empire. Unfortunately in the sources the two Shapurs are frequently confused, and activities of Shapu.s II are frequently attributed to Shapur I, more than vice versa. The earlier Sasanian rulers mayhave begun to erect fortifications against the Romans in Mesopotamia, and against nomadic enemies north of the Caucasus, but Shapur II extended the system of defence, probably in imitation of Diocletian's activities in building the limes of the Syrian andMesopotamian frontiers ofthe Roman empire. Islamic writers attribute to Shapur II the line of forts, walls andprobably moats or ditches situated in Iraq on theedge of the desert and called khandaqSabur. Just as the Romans settled limtanei on their frontiers, so Shapur settled Arabs in Iraq as a permanent defence force against other Arabs of the desert, especially those allied with Rome. We have no information about Shapur's efforts to repel invaders from theCaucasus region, butwemay assume that the famous wall of Darband, if not begun by Shapur, at least wasthe result of his efforts at fortification in the north. The system of Roman limes must have impressed the Sasanians for it stopped Shapur's strenuous efforts to repeat what his great-grandfather Shapur I had done. Andthiswas in spite of the fact that the army of Shapur II probably was better organized and more disciplined than under previous monarchs.
138



THE REIGN OF SHAPUR II
In addition to the limes and system of forts built by the Sasanians, mainly to halt raids by the desert Arabs, either brigands or allies ofthe Romans, there were a number of buffer states at the beginning of Sasanian rule. These became absorbed into the central state in the course of time, such that by the 7th century even the buffer state of the Arab Lakhmids of Hira was gone. The end of the buffer states may have weakened the Sasanian state at the time of the Arab conquests, for the imperial forces had to bear the brunt of the first attacks. In the 3rd century such client states as Adiabene, Arabistan (in the north-east Syrian desert), and of course the Lakhmids, played an important role in Sasanian-Roman relations, perhaps comparable to Palmyra on the Roman side. Just as in the Roman empire, the client states were taken over by the central government, andin their place the fortified cities of the frontier and the limes were organized into a defence system. In the long series of wars between the Sasanians on one side, and the Romans followed by the Byzantines on the other, the frontier remained more or less constant in upper Mesopotamia. It is true that sometimes Nisibis, Singara, Dara and other cities of upper Mesopotamia changed hands, but the stability of the frontier over centuries is remarkable. Although the possession of frontier cities gave oneempire a trade advantage over the other, one has the impression that the blood spilled in the warfare between the two states brought as little real gain to one side or the other as the few metres of land gained at terrible cost in the trench warfare of the First World War.
Shapur II was noted for his religious persecution, mostly of the Christians butalso of Jews andManichaeans. Christianity hadexpanded into Iraq already under theArsacids, butthelarge numbers of prisoners brought from Antioch and elsewhere by Shapur I, and settled by him in areas such as Khuzistan, had increased the numbers and activities of Christians in the Sasanian empire. Bishoprics existed not only at Ctesiphon but at Gundeshapur, Bishapur and elsewhere. While the Christians in northern Mesopotamia and especially in Adiabene, which had had a Jewish ruling family in Parthian times, were early converted by missionaries from western centres of Christianity, those of Khuzistan and Fars provinces were mostly descended from war prisoners settled by royal decree. Shapur II needed money for his army to attack the Romans, so among his taxes those on Christians were doubled to provide extra revenues. The Christians naturally objected and the
139



IRAN UNDER THE SASANIANS
persecutions began. They lasted from 339 until the death of Shapur II in 379, andthefact that theRomans, chief enemies of Shapur, were Christians did not help the Christians in the Sasanian empire. The three centres of Christianity in the Sasanian empire, Ctesiphon, Adiabene andKhuzistan, suffered the most andfortunately we have the Syriac acts ofmartyrs from these areas, which interalia give interesting information about Sasanian titles and offices. Under Shapur II theprocess of the establishment of church-state relationships seems to have reached its culmination. The Zoroastrian church was now fully identified with the monarchy and yet the church had itsseparate place in society with a hierarchy ofits own. Just as in the case ofthe Safavid state somuch later, the initial supreme position of the ruler as head of both church andstate in the Sasanian empire had become modified by a strong andwell-organized clergy on the one hand, and a class-conscious nobility on the other. The "great mobad" is mentioned many times in the acts of the martyrs from Shapur's time, and other religious offices are also mentioned, indicating that bythis time thereligious organization which lasted until theend of the empire had been formed. It was during thereign of Shapur II that the mobad Adhurbad son of Mahraspand is supposed to have submitted to theordeal of having molten metal poured on his chest and to have emerged without harm; thus hevindicated the efficacy of following thegood religion of Zoroastrianism in opposition to other
religions.1 It would seem that orthodoxy was given a great boost by Adhurbad, forwe have some of his writings in Pahlavi still preserved and the Zoroastrian tradition considers him most highly. Heresies, among them time-speculation or Zurvanism, were combatted by the
orthodox clergy with theapproval of Shapur.2 Arabic sources as well as Agathias (iv. 26) saythat Ardashir II, successor to Shapur II,was hisbrother, but this seems most unlikely, for he would have been very elderly. Some scholars have speculated that Shapur II is confused for Shapur IIIin the sources, which is also improbable. Another Shapur, a sonof Hormizd II like Shapur II, as mentioned above, is attested by his Middle Persian inscription at Persepolis. This wasShapur the king of the Sakas, of Sind, Sistan
and Turan, up to theedge of the sea.3 It is possible that Ardashir II

THE REIGN OF SHAPUR II
was the son,or less likely the brother, of this Shapur rather than of Shapur II. Thepractice of calling various children by the same name, or with slight variants, exists in other parts of the world, but here it can be very confusing to the historian. If Ardashir II wasnot the son of Shapur II, as washis successor Shapur III, then we may postulate several factions among the nobility and clergy in the empire at this time, since one would expect a father-to-son succession if all were tranquil. Moreover any speculation that the relief attributed to Ardashir II in Taq-i Bustan represents a northern Iranian predominance (either political or religious) as opposed to Fars, where the earlier kings have their rock-carvings, is vain. Also any supposition that this implies a religious division between north and south is unwarranted. Whatever the relationship of Ardashir II with Shapur II, his reign was short, and he was deposed after less than four years' rule by the nobility because of his tyranny towards them, according to Islamic sources.
Ardashir II was succeeded by Shapur III, a son of Shapur II, aswe know from a Middle Persian inscription of the former at Taq-i Bustan. Shapur III ruled from 383 to 388 and was praised in theIslamic sources as being mild andwell disposed towards thenobility. None theless he was either murdered or his tent fell on himkillinghim.
During the reign of Shapur III Armenia again became a bone of contention between the Roman and Sasanian empires. Since the time of the successes of Shapur II Armenia, Georgia and Albania had remained " vassal states" of the Sasanian empire. The defence ofthe passes over the Caucasus against nomad invaders was imperative for the Sasanians, which is one reason whythey were so sensitive about their northern frontiers. From time to time they shared expenses of the defence of Darband andthe north with theRomans, whoalso did not desire invasions of their Anatolian provinces. Wehave mentioned that a small part of Armenia remained outside Sasanian influence, and the emperor Theodosius evidently sought to increase the domain of the Roman protege in Armenia by sending an army to his eastern frontier in the year 383 or 384.Hostilities, however, did not occur. Rather embassies passed between thetwogreat empires, andan agreement was reached to readjust the boundaries of the two Armenias. Artashes, the ruler of the Roman part, waskilled in a conflict, and the Romans appointed a newruler with a newtitle comes Armeniae, which confirmed thevirtual annexation of this part of Armenia to the Roman

empire.1 The largest part of Armenia remained under an Armenian king ofthe Arsacid dynasty, but as a vassal ofthe Sasanians until 428 when Bahram V, at the request ofsome Armenian nobles, dethroned Artaxias son of Vramshapuh, and installed a Persian mar^bdn. There is aninteresting notice in the Armenian history of Faustos of Byzantium relating to this time regarding Persian wars withthe
Kushans to the east.2 He says that the king of Persia (Shapur III or Bahram IV) fought against the great king ofthe Kushans, an Arsacid who resided inBalkh, but the latter won. This would indicate that the successors ofShapur IIhad to fight ineastern Iran against aruler who called himself the great king of the Kushans, and was moreover related to the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia. That the word Kushan is being used in a general sense is revealed by other Armenian authors who
later identify the Kushans as Huns or Hephthalites.3 The relationship between the Arsacid kings of Armenia andthe Kushan rulers is mentioned by other Armenian authors but not in non-Armenian sources. Intermarriage between the royal houses, however, is not to be excluded.
The Sasanian empire not only had hostile relations with the Romans to the west and the Kushans and others inthe east, but the Caucasus in the north and the province ofGurgan to the east of the Caspian Sea were also sources of disturbance. The Romans andPersians could agree on the need tocontain the nomadic tribes north ofthe Caucasus but sometimes the defences of Darband were unable to hold the onslaught. About the year 395 bands ofHuns came into Armenia and spread as far as Syria and Cappadocia plundering and killing. Both Syriac and Greek sources tell ofthis invasion which was not opposed since the Roman military forces were concentrated in the western part of the empire at thedeath of Theodosius that same year. For several years the Huns were active in the Middle East but we hear nothing of attacks on the Sasanian empire. The Huns invaded the Roman empire because ofits weakness, and possibly with the connivance ofthe Sasanians, but more likely they defeated the Persians and devastated the north-western part ofthe Sasanian empire during their invasion. Information on external relations is lacking forthe reignof

Bahram IV, probably the son of Shapur III. Bahram held the title "King of Kirman" before he ascended the throne, and although Hamza al-Isfahani reports that he wasvulgar and neglectful, heis generally praised in Arabic sources. He was murdered, however, with an arrow and his son Yazdgard became the ruler in 399.
FROM YAZDGARD I TO KHUSRAU I; TROUBLE ON THE
FRONTIERS; AGGRAVATION OF THE ARMENIAN PROBLEM
Yazdgard, according to the Persian tradition, reported by later writers such as al-Jahiz, was a sinner who "changed thetraditions of the Sasanian dynasty, agitated the earth, oppressed the people and was tyrannical andcorrupt".1 This badreputation has been attributed to the king's reputed persecution of the Zoroastrian priests and his proChristian sentiment. Thelatter probably has been exaggerated, for many of the acts ofChristian martyrs from the reign ofYazdgard do not support the view that he was unduly friendly tothe Christians. Perhaps his reported friendship for Marutha the bishop of Maiferqat, who was sent by theByzantine emperor Arcadius on several embassies to Iran, changed the policy of the Sasanian ruler. Yazdgard seems to have been ready to launch anattack onthe Byzantine empire, but the embassies served thegood purpose of maintaining peace, which was sealed byanagreement inthe year 409. There are a number of sources about the life of Marutha, and several say hewon the good graces of the Persian king by his ability as a doctor.2 In any case, one may conclude that the lot ofthe Christians inthe Sasanian empire improved as a result of Marutha's influence.
It was during the reign of Yazdgard that the Christians of the Sasanian empire held a council in the city of Seleucia in the year 410. The council was convened under thepatronage of Yazdgard, to use modern terms, andwas composed of bishops andother ecclesiastics of the empire. They officially accepted theprovisions of the Council of Nicaea. The Council of Nicaea in 325 wasthe first ecumenical council after the Roman emperor Constantine had accepted Christianity. At this council the heresy of Arianism was condemned. Arius, an ecclesiastic of Alexandria, had refused to recognize the divinity of Christ and his equality with God the Father. The Nicene Creed which

became a statement ofChristian belief declared that the Son is of "One Substance" with the Father. Inthe Sasanian empire, the Christians had not formally subscribed to the decisions of the Council of Nicaea, and there had been nounanimity ofopinion on the rules ofthe church and its organization in Iran. The Council of Seleucia changed this, for it stopped dissensions andquarrels, and created an organized hierarchy and rules forChristians inthe Sasanian empire. A certain Isaac, bishop of Seleucia, became head of the church inthe Sasanian empire, although he did not live long afterwards; other steps were also taken to organize the church. Towards the end ofthe reign ofYazdgard some Christians went too far in destroying fire temples and attacking Zoroastrian priests, whereupon they were put to death.1 None the less in comparison with previous rulers, Yazdgard was tolerant towards minority religions. Yazdgard is said to have married a certain Soshandukht, daughter of the reshgalutha or patriarch of the Jews in the Sasanian empire,and this improved their position inthe land.
An innovation in the relations between the Byzantine and Sasanian empires occurred during the reign ofYazdgard, which was the request of Arcadius that the Persian ruler act as a guardian for his youngson Theodosius II. This testament has been considered merely an unimportant though polite gesture, but perhaps atthe time it meant more in the eyes ofthe two monarchs and their subjects. Yazdgard took his charge seriously and at the death of Arcadius sent a eunuch called Antiochus to Byzantium to advise and care forthe young emperor, which hedid. The sons of Yazdgard, however, didnotfare so well after his death. During hislifetime one son, Shapur, was sent as king of Armenia to replace theArsacid king of Armenia, Vramshapuh, who died in 414. Another son, Bahram, was sent toal-Mundhir, the king ofthe Lakhmid Arabs at Hira, to be brought up, while theexistence of another son, Narseh, is implied in thesources. At thedeath of Yazdgard his son Shapur came from Armenia and ascended thethrone. Heruled for a very short time, waskilled, anda Sasanian prince from a side line, called Khusrau, was made ruler bythe nobles. Bahram, however,did not accept Khusrau andmoved against Ctesiphon with an army primarily ofArabs. Khusrau apparently abdicated and Bahram V became ruler in420.
Bahram issurnamed Gor "the wild ass" inIslamic sources, reputedly because of his skill in hunting theonagers, and many stories aretold
1 O. Braun, Ausgewdhlte Akten persischerMdrtyrer (Munich, 1915), pp. 139-41.
144



YAZDGIRD I TO KHUSRAU I
about him. Inthe early years of his reign Bahram is said tohave devoted so much time to hunting, drinking and women that the affairs of state suffered. He loved polo and music and,according to Firdausl, he brought bands oflulls, the ancestors ofthe gypsies, from India to Iran to entertain the people. It ispossible that the soubriquet "wild ass" is a folk etymology for an older east-Iranian word for king or leader, since Bahram was victorious in his campaigns in theeast andleft a
legacy at least in thecoinage of Bukhara.1 The dirhams(drachms) of Bahram served as the prototype of the later coinage of the oasis of Bukhara, and the portrait ofBahram, albeit indebased form, continued to appear on thelocal coins well into the 'Abbasid period. This fact is enough to indicate the importance of Bahrain's wars in eastern Iran and Central Asia although thedetails, as so frequently, escape us. In any case, thewars in theeast occurred towards theendof Bahrain's reign, forat the beginning hehad difficulties inthe west.
Shortly after his accession in 421 the persecution of Christians in the Sasanian empire was resumed, probably at the instigation of Zoroastrian priests. Many Christians fled to the Byzantine empire and Bahram sought their extradition, but Theodosius II refused. War broke out and the Byzantines were successful in a series of skirmishes. Bahram sought peace, and hostilities between the two empires ceased in 422. Christians were free to worship inthe domains of Bahram, and the Byzantines agreed to contribute money towards the defence of the pass at Darband in the Caucasus. Since no city had fallen to thearmy of either opponent there was no change of territory. Shortly after the end of the war theChristians of the Sasanian empire in a synod proclaimed theautonomy and separation of the Persian church from the "western" fathers of the church, which thus took place before the Nestorian heresy.
Bahram also tried to settle the continuing discontent in Armeniaby appointing anArsacid, Artashes son ofVramshapuh, king ofArmenia. After sixor seven years theArmenian nobles tired of their ruler and requested Bahram to remove Artashes. This Bahram did, replacing him with a Persian governor iu 428. The Armenian nobles called nakharars on the whole were satisfied with the change since it gave them more power in their own domains, buttheArmenian clergy, led by the patriarch or catholicos Sahak, opposed the appointment of a Persian governor or marzban. Sahak was arrested bythe Persians and

kept in custody for afew years, then released to resume his ecclesiastical duties. The situation inArmenia was by no means resolved, however, and later revolts brought great distress tothe country. Bahram was succeeded byhis son Yazdgard II in439, who at once opened war against the Byzantines. Theodosius II,however, didnot want trouble in theeast, so he sent the commander of his eastern armies, Anatolius, to the camp of Yazdgard and peace was made preserving the status quo, with anadditional proviso that neither side should erect any new forts in the frontier areas. Peace having been made in the west, Yazdgard then had to turn to hisnorth-eastern frontier where certain tribes, defeated by Bahram, had again challenged Sasanian supremacy. The identity ofthese people is unknown, forthe Armenian sources which tell about them simply call them, anachron
istically, Kushans, or Huns who were called Kushans.1 The use of the term "Kushan" for subsequent kingdoms inthe east was analogous to the Greek usage of "Scythian" for all nomads in south Russia and Central Asia, or the later Byzantine designation ofall eastern nomads as "Huns". It isprobable, however, that Yazdgard fought against the Hephthalites, for oneArmenian author suggests this when he says the Sasanian king in the twelfth year ofhis reign invaded the landof
Itatakan where the king of the Kushans lived.2 The Hephthalites are mentioned in Chinese sources as originally having lived in Central Asia. In the fifth century they moved into Bactria and apparently joined some local mountaineers to rule theland. They adopted the local written language, Bactrian(or sometimes called Kushan-Bactrian), written in modified Greek letters. Yazdgard is reported by the Armenian sources to have established his residence for anumber ofyears at Nlshapur in Khurasan soasto bebetter able to prosecute the war against hiseastern enemies. Sasanian forces seem to have been victorious in the east, for Yazdgard turned his attention to Armenia where grave disorders had broken out. Fortunately we have detailed accounts in Armenian sources of the attempt of Yazdgard to convert Armenia to the Zoroastrian faith. According to them, the prime mover behind this attempt was MihrNarseh, thefamous prime minister of Yazdgard I, Bahram Gor and Yazdgard II; hewrote a letter to the Armenians calling upon them to

YAZDGIRD I TO KHUSRAU I
convert. Mihr-Narseh not only failed but roused many people against his policy, and in 450 an assembly of Armenian priests and princes called by thepatriarch Joseph launched a revolt. Some of the Armenian nobles had accepted Zoroastrianism and sided with the Persians, so the result was more a civil war than merely a Persian-Armenian struggle. Requests for aid from the Byzantines were in vain. In a memorable battle in 451 the Christian Armenians led by a noble, Vardan, ofthe house of Mamikonian, were annihilated and after the battle many Armenian priests and nobles were led into captivity in Iran. Several ecclesiastics were martyred in captivity and the land of Armenia was ruled by Persian marzbans. The battle of Avarair became a landmark in the history of Armenia, remembered with emotion by Armenians to this day.
Christians other than Armenians in the empire also suffered from persecutions andimpositions, although there wasno overall attack on them as in the time of Shapiir II. Several of the Syriac acts of martyrs incidentally mention the persecution of Jews by Yazdgard. The last years of the king were devoted to more struggles with nomads tothe east of the Caspian Sea and with the Hephthalites. Yazdgard died in 457 without having pacified the eastern frontier and leaving two sons to contest the throne.
Although the sources disagree as to who was the elder brother, it was probably Hormizd, who,in any event, became the ruler. Peroz, his brother, secured theaidof the Hephthalites, however, and marched against the king. In battle Peroz was victorious and became ruler. During the war between the two brothers the Transcaucasian area of Albania proclaimed its independence from Iran, so one of the first acts of Peroz wasto reconquer the rebel territory. He also freed some Armenian nobles who had been imprisoned byhis father, and it seemed that theharsh measures of previous reigns might nowcome to an end.
A long famine caused by a severe drought caused new problems for the Sasanian state, and renewed enmity with the Hephthalites proved disastrous for Peroz. The Byzantine empire was occupied with the Huns in Europe, while the Persians had to meet corresponding migrations of peoples from Central Asia. Peroz was defeated and captured by the Hephthalites about the year 469. There is confusion in thesources between the names "Hephthalite" and"Kidarite" Huns. Whether they are identical is difficult to decide, but since both designations appear in the time of Peroz one could assume they were

contemporary rather than one or the other being anachronistic. The
word "Chionite" is also used as a synonym for " H u n " in Syriac
chronicles, further confusing our view ofthe situation inthe east. The
Sasanian monarch had to agree to an onerous peace. His son Kavad
was left as a hostage until thePersians paid a large sum of money.1
Sasanian Iran in effect hadto paytribute to the Hephthalites for a
number ofyears. Peroz turned from his defeat in the east to Armenia where a revolt had broken outled byVahan Mamikonian, a nephew of Vardan. In neighbouring Georgia, too, conflict between Christians and the partisans of the Persians at first brought victory to theChristian nobles. Later the proclaimed king of the Christian Armenians, Sahak Bagratuni, was killed in abattle with the Persians after the Georgian king Vakhtang had betrayed his Armenian allies by making peace with theenemy. Vahan, however, was able to rally theArmenians after most of the Sasanian forces were withdrawn from the country in482 to aid Peroz in a campaign tothe east of the Caspian Sea. Two years later a Sasanian army was annihilated by the Hephthalites and Peroz was killed. The bureaucratic organization of the Sasanian empire was fully developed bythe 5th century; we have mentioned the important role in government of the prime minister Mihr-Narseh, theprototype of the later Islamic grand vizier. The three great offices of the state may have corresponded, at least in theory, to thethree classes of priests, warriors and scribes. The mobadan mobad was the head of the Zoroastrian church; theha^arbad or chiliarch was thetitle given to Mihr-Narseh by Armenian sources, which office was also known as that of the vu^urgframaddr (the great commander); thirdly the darandarybad seems to have been the chief ofthe bureaucracy orthe chief councillor of the court.2 From the vast number of seals preserved as well as notices in varied sources, we may assume that there was a hierarchy of andarzbads, in districts andprovinces. The andarzbad was probably a judicial as well as an administrative officer, a testament to thecontinuing importance of law in Iran. The administration of the Sasanian empire is discussed in another chapter, butsuffice itto say that the proliferation of titles in Sasanian Iran indicates the complexity ofthe bureaucracy.
The development ofChristianity inthe Sasanian empire also belongs

to another chapter, butit was at the end of Peroz's reign that Nestorianism became the dominant form of Christianity in the empire. This in effect created a "Persian" church, as opposed to the "Byzantine" church, andit was proclaimed in a synod held at thecapital city in the spring of 484. Thesignificance of this wasa greater possibility for the spread of Christianity in Iran, not as the faith of the Byzantine enemy but asa "national" religion. The anti-monastic policy of the Nestorians for a time caused disorders in the Persian church which, however, little concerned the Sasanian state.
Internal disorders in Zoroastrianism, however, were of concern to the state, but it may be doubted whether there were any serious challenges to the harmony between the religion and the state before the Mazdakite movement which will be mentioned below. The supposed adherence to Zurvanism by Mihr-Narseh and Yazdgard II mayhave provoked opposition from some priests who were more strictly dualist, but we cannot perceive any influence on the political history of Sasanian Iran. The fact that there was a later Mazdakite crisis, however, points to an earlier background of unrest anduncertainty, not only in the Zoroastrian religion but also in the social fabric of the empire.
The brother of Peroz, called Balash or Valgash, was elected king by the nobles, who always showed their influence in the face of weak rulers, or of such a disaster as befell Peroz. Peace wasmade with the Hephthalites and a heavy tribute waspaid by the Persians. Peacewas also made with the Armenian rebels led by Vahan. It wasagreed that existing fite temples in Armenia should be destroyed and no more erected and the Armenians were free to practise Christianity without fear of forcible conversion to Zoroastrianism. Furthermore, Armenia was to be administered directly by the Sasanian king and not through a deputy. TheArmenians supported Balash against a pretender to the throne, either thebrother or a sonof Peroz called Zarer. With thisaid the rebel wasdefeated and later captured and killed, so the Armenian nobles stood high in the esteem of Balash. At the endof the reign of Peroz, or at the beginning of the reign of Balash, Nestorianism was established as thesoleallowed sect of Christians in the Sasanian empire. Balash, in spite of his good intentions, seems to have fallen victim to a conspiracy of nobles whoin 488 deposed him in favour of Kavad, son of Peroz.
Kavad had lived with the Hephthalites asa prisoner or hostage, and it is highly probable that they actively assisted him to obtain the throne.

IRAN UNDER THE SASANIANS
Early inhis reign the prime minister Zarmihr, orSokhra as he isalso called, who probably wasinstrumental in deposing Balash,was murdered atthe instigation ofKavad. This event caused resentment among some of the great nobles and Kavad's position was consequently weakened. According to a Syriac chronicler, certain Arab tribes, the Armenians and others caused trouble for Kavad during
his first reign.1 But the greatest problem for the empire was the sect of the Mazdakites, about whom much has been written. In his doctrines, Mazdak seems tohave followed a form ofManichaeism though he adhered to Zoroastrian rituals. We know very little about the life of Mazdak, but hemay have been a Zoroastrian priest, possibly with Manichaean sympathies. Asan avowed Manichaean orarch-heretic he hardly could have obtained the influence he did. His admonitions against violence and harm to others were coupled with a call to a sharing ofpossessions, a primitive communism. We do not know how far Mazdak went, for his detractors even accused him of advocating the sharing of wives, which is unlikely. Just how or why the king adhered to, orfavoured, Mazdakism is unknown, but most scholars have speculated that he was seeking tocounter the power of the aristocracy. There seems little doubt that a desire to ameliorate the condition of the common people also played arole in the sympathies of Kavad forMazdakite ideas. In any case the disorders consequenton Kavad's penchant for Mazdakism evoked a conspiracy ofthe nobility. We have mentioned rebellions among the Armenians and Arabs, and the refusal of the Byzantine emperor to send money for the defence of Darband; these things exacerbated the situation. Kavad was deposed and put in prison, and his brother Zamasp became ruler in 496.
Many stories are told about Kavad's escape from prison and flight to the court ofthe Hephthalite king, from where, after a few years, he returned toIran with a Hephthalite army and Zamasp surrendered the throne to Kavad without a fight. This probably took place atthe end of498 orthe beginning of499, and it is probable that Zamasp was not killed as was usual insuch cases. Kavad eliminated the chief nobles who had actively conspired against him, butin general he consolidated his position byclemency. The refusal of the Byzantine emperor to send money to Kavad, again ostensibly as a contribution to the defence ofDarband, led to hostilities. Kavad needed money to pay his Hephthalite allies, and he opened hostilities inAugust 502

in the north-west part of his empire. Theodosiopolis, present Erzerum, was captured by the Persians, and then Kavad moved to the south and laid siege to Amida. After a spirited defence it fell in January 503. The Byzantines reacted by sending several armies to the east and the war moved back and forth with no major victory for either side. In 503 Kavad had to break off operations to meet an invasion ofhis territory in Transcaucasia. In 504 the Byzantines had the advantage although they could notretake Amida. In 506 peace was made whereby Kavad received some money from Byzantium as a compensation for the Byzantine fortification of the town of Dara contrary to a longestablished agreement between the two empires, but Kavad gave up Amida and other conquests. Thetreaty was to last seven yearsbut in fact was extended.
Internal affairs occupied Kavad till the end of his reign although the accession of a newemperor in Byzantium, Justin, at first caused a strain in relations between the two states. The Mazdakites continued to flourish but their excesses were held in check by the orthodox priesthood and the nobility, which in reality mayhave strengthened the hand of Kavad against all opposition. The question of succession worried Kavad for he wished to name his successor himself andnot leave the matter to election by the nobility. He had three sons, the youngest of whom, Khusrau, he favoured as his successor. In order to ensure his succession to the throne, Kavad proposed to Justin that he adopt Khusrau as his son and accept the responsibility to support Khusrau as ruler of Iran. Butthe Byzantine emperor did not want to accept the adoption asKavad had proposed it,andas a result relations between thetwoempires cooled.
The end of Kavad's reign internally saw the execution of Mazdak and many of his followers, while externally war with Byzantium was renewed. The crown prince Khusrau reportedly was the instigator of the massacre of the Mazdakites, and several stories are told about this. After the death of Mazdak the heretics, for so they were considered by orthodox Zoroastrian priests, were persecuted and the movement went underground. Their name, however, appears time and again in the sources as thecommon designation for social revolutionaries. The impact of the Mazdakites must have been great, for their name was notforgotten and they left a legacy for thefuture, even into Islamic times.
At this time a tribal kingdom was founded in Arabia by thetribe of



IRAN UNDER THE SASANIANS
Kinda, and itsleader Harith b. 'Amr was able to defeat Mundhir III, king ofthe Lakhmids, and seize his capital Hira. The Kind! occupation of Hira probably lasted only a few years, perhaps 525-8, but the Kindl Arabs had taken over parts of Iraq as early as 506.1 Events in Georgia also occupied the Persians during the second reign of Kavad. Gurgenes, the king ofGeorgia, had to fight against his nobility, which sought to limit, if not abolish altogether, the power of their king. The Persians were happy to take advantage of this discord andsupported the nobles with anarmy in 523. The king fled to neighbouring Lazica onthe shores of the Black Sea, north-west of Georgia, andthe Persians occupied the cities of Georgia. A marzban ruled thecountry and Sasanian garrisons were established in the chief city, Mtskheta (near modern Tiflis), and other cities. Persian success in Transcaucasia was matched by thedefeat of a Byzantine army in Mesopotamia, in which Belisarius thefamous general held a command. In 527 Justin turned over the reins of government to hisnephew Justinian, but the war continued in Lazica and onthe Mesopotamian frontier, though in a desultory fashion. Belisarius was placed in command of a Byzantine army in the east and instructed to erect forts on the frontier. Hewas defeated by a Persian force but Justinian instead of removing him from command made Belisarius general ofthe east. He met the Persians again outside thewalls of Dara anddefeated them. In the Caucasus region too the Sasanians suffered several reverses.
Kavad then heavily supported his Arab ally Mundhir of the Lakhmids in a great raid into Syria, flanking the Roman fortifications and Belisarius, with the intention ofcapturing and plundering Antioch. Belisarius, however, was not surprised andmoved to meet the new threat. In a battle at Callinicum in 531Belisarius wasdefeated and retreated but the Sasanian forces had lost so heavily that they too withdrew. Kavad only prepared another army under new commanders and sent it into Roman Mesopotamia, with more hope of success, since Belisarius hadbeen recalled by Justinian and sent against the Vandals in North Africa. Nothing wasaccomplished, however, for the death of the aged Kavad brought anend to hostilities. The new ruler Khusrau wasto become the most illustrious of the Sasanian rulers, comparable to Shah 'Abbas in Safavid times.

KHUSRAU I AND HIS REFORMS; REVITALIZATION
OF THE EMPIRE
The reign ofKhusrau I, orKhusrau Anushirvan (" ofimmortal soul"), began with a revolt of his brothers and some discontented nobles, but the new ruler was able tosuppress itand unite the nobility and religious leaders behind him. He had torepair the damage tosociety wrought by the Mazdakite movement, so he made peace with the Byzantines in 5 32, on condition ofthe Persians evacuating several fortresses inLazica and the Byzantines paying Khusrau to maintain the Caucasian defences. Reforms oftaxation and internal administration occupied the new ruler for a number of years.
The Mazdakite disorders haddisrupted not only thecollection of taxes butalso thetitles to land. The need for reform, however, was of long standing and the social upheaval brought on by the Mazdakites only enhanced an already archaic system. Kavad had initiated the reform by surveying andmeasuring theland, butthis hadnotbeen finished at the time ofhis death. The cadastre was finished by Khusrau, but more than land was measured; date palms andolive trees were counted and assessed for tax purposes. Finally individuals were counted for the head tax. The old system of assessing taxes onthe produce of the land was not only archaic but unjust, forassessment was made on the harvest, butbefore it was gathered. This meant that farmers had to wait until tax collectors arrived to assess theharvest, whichwas sometimes spoiled because ofthe delay. InKavad's time the assessment seems to have been made after theharvest had been collected, which was an improvement. The new system of Khusrau did away with the yearly assessment and instead established a fixed tax, the average of several years' harvest. This represented a tremendous advance, since plans could bemade henceforth onthe basis of the known taxes. The head tax did not apply to the upper classes - clergy, knights and scribes but rather to men of the common people between twenty andfifty years old. After the reform taxes were collected in money rather than in kind, and payments were made three times a year.
The importance of the new tax system cannot be underestimated since it served asthe model forthe later caliphate. The resemblanceof the taxreform of Khusrau to theRoman indictio with the iugatio and capitatio, as established by the tax reforms of Diocletian, has been noted by several scholars.1 The result of Khusrau's taxreformswas

that theruler had a fixed amount entering hiscoffers every year. The lowlands of Iraq, as hadbeen the case under the Achaemenids, paid the lion's share of the land tax in the Sasanian empire, evidence of the continuing importance of the Tigris-Euphrates area. Just as significant as the tax reforms were the army reforms of Khusrau. Previously the nobility, from the great to the small, had been obliged to equip themselves and their followers and serve without pay in thearmy. Khusrau gave thepoor nobles, better called knights, equipment and a salary for service in the army. Thus theruler secured direct support of the military class, and the great nobles who had maintained private armies saw their power drastically reduced. In essence a newsocial order was created, a newnobility of the robe beside the landed nobility. This wasthe period of the flowering of the dehkdn class, theknight who owned a village. The dehkans became the backbone of Iranian society, as the Arabs discovered after their conquests. Khusrau also settled families onthe frontiers with theduty to come to arms andprotect thefrontier in time of danger. Whether this policy provided the model on which the later Byzantine theme system was based is uncertain, but this is not impossible.
Further, the king divided the empire into four parts and puta spdhbady or general, over each part. The generals ofthe east, Khurasan, and of the west, Iraq, were especiany important since they respectively had to defend the frontiers against the nomads of the east and the Romans in the west. TheArabs later discovered that the interior of Iran was relatively empty of troops, forthe soldiers were concentrated on the frontiers. Once the frontier armies were defeated the way to the interior was opened. Nodoubt other reforms in themilitary organization of the empire were undertaken by Khusrau, on which we have no information. The endresult, however, wasa more efficient army, which shortly was to beputto use against theByzantines.
Fortunately, wehave in Procopius a detailed source for thewars of Khusrau against the Byzantines, as was Ammianus Marcellinus for the wars of Shapur II. The causes of the resumption of hostilities between the two empires after an interval of peace were manifold. Certainly the instigation of ambassadors of the Ostrogoths in Italy, threatened byJustinian, and of others, played animportant role in the decision of Khusrau to open hostilities. He mayhave feared future aggression from the Byzantines after they had re-established the Roman empire in the west. As usual theArmenians andthe Lakhmid Arabs
154



REVITALIZATION OF THE EMPIRE
had grievances against Byzantine subjects, so a casusbelli was easily at hand. At first Justinian sought to dissuade Khusrau from war but in this he failed. Khusrau invaded Byzantine territory in 540primarily in search of plunder. He headed for Syria, flanking at the south the Byzantine defences in upper Mesopotamia. In a short time the Persian army stood before thewalls of Antioch. Thesiege of the city lasted only a few days, for, because of an earthquake a few years before, it was ill prepared to withstand an enemy. The city was plundered andburned, which at once ledJustinian to seek peace. With hismain forces in the west, the Byzantine emperor had to buy peace from the Persian adversary. A truce was declared at Antioch, but Khusrau returned to his land slowly, waiting for theagreement of Justinian to pay him five thousand pounds of gold asa war indemnity and five hundred pounds annually, ostensibly as a contribution to thedefence of the Caucasian frontier. As Khusrau retreated, however, he extorted large sums of money from Byzantine cities such as Edessa andDara as a condition of leaving them in peace. At thelatter place, he laid siege to thecity until the inhabitants paid hima large sumto leave them further unmolested. As a result of these actions, Justinian denounced the truce and prepared to send Belisarius, his victorious general in the west, against thePersians. Khusrau, on returning to Iraq, built a newcity near his capital, a model of Antioch, which he called Veh Antiok Khusrau, ("Better than Antioch [has] Khusrau [built this]"), wherein hesettled captives brought from Antioch. This town, forming part of the complex of the capital, was called Rumagan "town of the Greeks" by the local inhabitants, and al-Rumiyya in Arabic. Khusrau the following year opened hostilities in Lazica on the Black Seacoast of Transcaucasia. The Persians captured Petra, a Byzantine fortress on the coast, and established a protectorate over thecountry, which formerly hadbeen nominally under Byzantine rule. In the south Belisarius had a few local successes but he did not have sufficient troops or equipment to take Nisibis or other large, fortified cities. The following year pestilence hindered the activities of both sides. Then Belisarius wasrecalled by Justinian andsent to Italy. A Roman army suffered defeat in Armenia in 543. Heartened by the prospects of victory, Khusrau in 544laid siege to Edessa, hoping to incorporate all of the Byzantine transEuphrates domain into his own empire. The defence of Edessa is

described in detail by Procopius, andtheendwas theretreat of Khusrau to his homeland after a remarkable defence of their city by the people of Edessa. A five years' truce was arranged between Justinian and Khusrau with the latter receiving two thousand pounds of gold.
The truce wasbroken in its fourth year bytheByzantine alliance with Lazica to expel the Persians. A Byzantine-Lazic force besieged Petra, but the city wasrelieved by a Sasanian army. Later two Persian armies were routed and finally after a memorable siege the strong fortress of Petra was retaken by the Byzantines in 551,and again a five-year truce wasconcluded between the twoempires. Lazica wasnot included in the truce and hostilities continued there. Finally, the Persians had the worst of the conflict and negotiations were opened with Byzantium in 5 5 6 for a permanent settlement. After much discussion and passage of time, finally in 561 a fifty years' peace treaty was signed in which the Sasanians evacuated Lazica and in return received an annual payment of gold. A description of the sealing of the documents, as well asthe terms of the treaty, is given by Menander Protektor, a Byzantine historian (in fragment 11 M), and it provides an insight into the diplomatic protocol of the time. Khusrau needed peace on his western frontiers so he could deal with the Hephthalites in the east. About 5 57 he allied with the Tuijks, who had appeared in Transoxiana, under a ruler called Silziboulos in Greek sources, and together they destroyed the Hephthalites and partitioned their territory. It would seem that Khusrau obtained their lands south of the Oxus river, while the Turks ruled over lands to the north. Just how far the Sasanians extended their domains to the east is unknown; it is possible that they penetrated north of the river and then withdrew later when hostilities between Turks and Persians had broken out about 569-70. Whether Khusrau pushed his frontiers into India is also unknown but not likely. It would appear that Kabul and areas to the east were not under Sasanian rule, although short periods of control cannot be excluded. There does not seem to have been a central power holding the Hephthalite princes together in the east.
Another venture of Khusrau at the end of his reign brought Persian arms for the first time to southern Arabia. It is impossible here to discuss the background of the history of southern Arabia and its relations with Ethiopia. The Byzantines, and before them the Roman empire, had an obvious economic interest in Ethiopia and southern
156



REVITALIZATION OF THE EMPIRE
Arabia, controlling as they didthelower Red Sea and trade with India. The spread of Christianity in both lands had established bonds with the eastern Roman empire, so when thetwogreat rulers Justinianand Khusrau measured their strength it was almost inevitable that Arabia would be drawn into the conflict. The Ethiopians, whohad adopted Monophysite Christianity as the state religion, in A 522sent an army across the Red Sea to help their co-religionists whowere being persecuted by the Himyarites, thedominant power in southern Arabia at that time. A long struggle ensued in which the Ethiopians and the Christians of southern Arabia naturally were supported by Byzantium, at least morally, but without menor supplies. A certain Yusuf Dhu Nuwas, reportedly a follower of Judaism, made himself the leader of the non-Christian Arab majority in southern Arabia anddrove out the Ethiopians. Yusuf realized he would need aid against the Ethiopians and their Arab Christian allies, so he turned to Sasanian Iran and the vassal state of the Lakhmids of Hira. Byzantine diplomacy, however, prevented anyaid from going to Yusuf from Iran. Byzantium, on the other hand, then sent ships andsupplies to aid the Ethiopians. In 525 the Negus (thetitle of the ruler of Ethiopia) himself led troops into southern Arabia in a second invasion. The Ethiopians were victorious and Yusuf was killed in battle. A newArab king of the Himyarites was installed under Ethiopian overlordship. In 5 31 Justinian sent an emissary to southern Arabia to the king of the Himyarites and to the Ethiopians. Procopius (1. 20) tells us that the envoy proposed to the Ethiopians that they take over the trade directly with India, especially of silk, which wasso important in the Byzantine empire. TheEthiopians could force thePersians out of this profitable trade. To the Arabs Justinian's envoy proposed that they ally with some nomadic tribes of central Arabia to invade the Sasanian domains. Both hopes of the Byzantines were unfulfilled, but the expedition against Iran was not then necessary, since Justinian and the new Sasanian ruler Khusrau hadconcluded peace. This was also theperiod of the fall of the Kinda confederacy in northern Arabia and the growth of Lakhmid power. Some time between 532 and 5 35 an Ethiopian general Abraha seized power from the Himyarite king and established an independent state in southern Arabia which he gradually enlarged. Abraha declared his independence from Ethiopia, defeated all opponents and received embassies from Byzantium. Abraha, a Christian, was thus pro-Byzantine
157

while some of his enemies appealed to Khusrau for aidagainst him. Nothing resulted from thedifferent power alliances in Arabia and in 569 or 570 Abraha died. This was "the year ofthe elephant", the year of the birth of the prophet Muhammad.
In 572 Ma'dikarib, one of the sons of Abraha, fled from his halfbrother, who hadbecome theruler in southern Arabia, to Khusrau and finally Khusrau moved to support theanti-Byzantine party. The allegiance or sentiments of some of the Monophysite Christians in Arabia changed from a pro-Byzantine position to opposition, since Justin II, who succeeded hisuncle in 565, after five or sixyears of following the policy ofreconciliation ofhis predecessor invain, turned to a fierce persecution of the Monophysites in theempire. Khusrau sent an army with a small fleet under a commander called Vahriz, together with Saif, son of Abu Murra, to the area near present Aden. The Persians and their allies were victorious, San'a', the capital of southern Arabia, was occupied, andSaif became thenew king. This happened between the years 575 and 577. Southern Arabia thus became and remained a dependency of the Sasanian empire. But the influence of the Himyarite kingdom of southern Arabia on the rest of the peninsula already had declined, preparing the way for the rise ofIslam. The Sasanians, however, were interested in controlling thetrade of Byzantium to India and the Far East, which they were now able to do thanks totheir position in southern Arabia. About 598 anew and larger expedition was sent under command of another Vahriz, since the ruler of the Himyarite kingdom wished to renounce Persian authority. The Persians were successful in battle; theking was killed and southern Arabia became a Sasanian province headed byVahriz.1
To return to Khusrau, the accession of Justin II boded illforcontinuing peace between the two empires, forthe latter resolved toend Justinian's payments tocertain Arab chiefs, who had agreed to refrain from pillaging Byzantine territory in return for subsidies. Justin also sought toobtain possession of Svanetia in the Caucasus, claiming itwas part of Lazica, due to Byzantium by the fifty years' peace treaty, although this matter had not been settled in the treaty. In negotiations inConstantinople the emperor showed such intractability indealing with the Arabs that theArab chiefs decided to commence raids on Byzantine territory. War between the twoempires did not materialize at this time in spite of the embassy from the western Turks in western

REVITALIZATION OF THE EMPIRE
Turkestan, who came to the Byzantine capital in 568 seeking an alliance between the Turks and Byzantines against their common enemies the Persians and the Avars in the Balkans. Nothing came of this embassy.
Armenia had remained quiet foralong period, but aPersian governor of the family of Suren, who had been appointed byKhusrau about 5 64, tried to spread Zoroastrianism in Armenia. He built a fire temple at Dvin, an important town near present Erevan, andhe put to death a member of the influential Mamikonian family. The result wasan Armenian uprising, and Suren and his guard were massacred in 571. The Armenian rebellion fitted in well with the plans of Justin II. He withheld theyearly payment to Persia for the defence of the Caucasus and he welcomed the Armenian rebels as subjects of the empire. An army was sent into Sasanian territory and the city of Nisibis was besieged in 572.The Byzantines were not able to take the city, but retreated in disorder because of thejealousy of the commanders. The Persians, on the other hand, followed the fleeing Byzantine army and invested thecity of Dara in which they had taken refuge. The Persians, after a siege of about five months, received the surrender of the city. Afterwards Persian forces ravaged Syria, andJustin sued for peace.
Justin II had been suffering from a mental illness and became incapable of ruling, so Tiberius, a high Byzantine officer, was named co-ruler in 5 74. A truce for one year was made with Khusrau, whereby Byzantium paid a large sum of money, but Armenia was excluded from the truce. No real conclusion of peace was reached, however, and in 575 Khusrau invaded Armenia. At first success crowned the Persian arms, and it seemed as though theeastern part of the Byzantine empire would be incorporated into the domains of the enemy. The fortunes of war changed, however, and a strong Byzantine army defeated Khusrau and then occupied Sasanian territory, plundering many localities. Consequently the local population, primarily Armenian, suffered from the Byzantines more than they had from the Persians. The Sasanians, losing heart, were now willing to negotiate a peace in 576. A great victory over the Byzantine army in Armenia, however, interrupted negotiations. In essence, the Persians refused to return Dara to Byzantium and insisted that certain Armenian refugees be turned over to them, to neither of which points theByzantine envoys would agree.
In the warfare of 578, a newByzantine commander, Maurikios or

Maurice, was able to capture several Persian forts and many captives. On theother hand theArmenians hadended their rebellion and a general amnesty from Khusrau brought the land back under Sasanian control. Before peace could be negotiated between the two empires Khusrau died in 579, after a long reign offorty-eight years. The empire which Khusrau ruled was in its glory, but already showing signs of decay in aspirit of pessimism and decadence prevalent among many ofits citizens. The rigid class structure, disturbed by the Mazdakites, had been re-established under Khusrau with strong religious sanctions. Although the power of the great families had been curbed, the boundaries between classes resembled the caste systemof India. The lower classes were not flourishing. Khusrau, however, became the prototype ofthe wise, just ruler for later times, so much so that his personal name formany Arabic authors became the common title for the pre-Islamic Sasanian kings. Thus Kisrd, an Arabic deformation of his name, followed the path of Kaiser and Tsar in the European lands, as descendants of Caesar. Even today in Persia the ignorant peasant will ascribe any very old ruin to Kisra Anushlrvan. He built caravanserais, bridges, roads and towns, such that under his reign the empire was linked together as never before. To Khusrau is attributed a long wall and series of forts in the plain ofGurgan, built as a defence against the Turks. He is also supposed to have rebuilt the wall and defences of Darband. It would seem that the walls and fortifications in Gurgan, Mazandaran (from the sea to the mountains near Sari), Darband and Iraq, fitted well with Khusrau's division of the military command in theempire among four army commanders of the four frontiers.
The basis of the wealth of the empire was land and agricultural produce, and the vast majority ofthe population were peasants, whose numbers if anything increased under Khusrau. We have noted that archaeological surveys in Khuzistan, andof the Diyala river basin north-east of present Baghdad, have revealed a great expansion of irrigation andof the amount of land under cultivation during the
Sasanian period,1 indicating the strong interest of the government in agricultural matters. One large irrigation enterprise in Iraq wasthe great Nahrawan canal system which supplied water toa large expanse of fields inIraq. It seems clear, after investigations inIraq, that there was also an unprecedented investment ofstate funds inextending the area of cultivation. Khusrau I developed complex plans for the digging

REVITALIZATION OF THE EMPIRE
of tunnels andcanals all over theempire, such that never before or since has there been so much land brought under cultivation in this part of the world; the agriculture was extensive rather than intensive. The Zoroastrian religion, of course, regarded thepromotion of the cultivation of the soil as a meritorious act, if not a strict duty of the ruler.
Khusrau was a tolerant monarch in regard to religions, forwe hear of no systematic persecutions during hisreign, although some of his underlings attimes showed a too-zealous attitude inregard to minority faiths. In contrast, Justinian was particularly severe on hereticsand pagans. In 529 he closed theacademy at Athens, which hadbeen a centre ofancient Greek philosophy and culture, and some philosophers took refuge at the court ofKhusrau. Although he welcomed them and treated them well, they became homesick, and Khusrau secured a pardon and permission from Justinian forthem to return toAthens in one of the peace treaties between the two empires. The Persian monarch maintained at his court Greek physicians and various thinkers, and a medical school following Greek theories, or a primitive university, was established atGundeshapur which lasted into Islamic times. Translations were made into Middle Persian not only from Greek, but also from Sanskrit. One of the most famous native scholars at his court was thephysician Burzoe, to whom areattributed many translations into Pahlavl from Sanskrit, including the collection offables known in Islamic times as Kallla wa Dimna from the Arabic of Ibn Muqaffa', from theoriginals in the Sanskrit book, thePanchatantra.It is quite possible, as suggested byChristensen, that the name Burzoe is simply a short form ofBuzurjmihr, a sage who lived inthe time of Khusrau.1
Khusrau is surnamed "the just" in later Islamic works, andthere are a great number of stories extant in Arabic andPersian sources attesting to his popularity, or at least to the great impact hemade in Persia. Especially abundant are the collections of andart^ or "advice", better described as " mirrors for princes ", which have survived, relating to Khusrau.2 Infact there are somany practices and sayings attributed to Khusrau that it is highly probable ourmonarch hasbecome the receptacle of all novelty and change in Sasanian history, making a determination of which stories arereal and which fanciful extremely difficult. Many Pahlavl books supposedly were written in the time ofKhusrau

I, although it must beremembered that just asin the case ofthe two Shapurs, sothe two Khusraus are frequently confused. Some scholars have claimed that theAvestan alphabet was created under the reign of Khusrau I, butmore likely it was earlier, possibly in the time of Shapur II. We have seen how Khusrau I destroyed theMazdakites. He also enforced a dualist Zoroastrian orthodoxy onhis people, even
forbidding religious controversies according to Mas'udl.1 It is safe to assume that the Zoroastrian orthodoxy which weknow from the Pahlavl books of the ninth century and later became fixed duringthe reign of Khusrau. One might continue to enumerate the achievements of the reignof Khusrau, such as the silver plates and engraved gems in various museum collections, all testimony to the wealth of his reign. The famous building Taq-i Kisra in Ctesiphon, part ofwhich still stands, impresses everyone with the immense size of the central arch or aivdn. The structure may date from the beginning ofthe Sasanian empire and it may have been extended orembellished under Khusrau I. Such matters are the subject for special investigation and can bementioned here only as evidence of the pomp and glory of the reign of Khusrau "of immortal soul".
The son ofKhusrau succeeded him without trouble. Hormizd IV was the sonof a Turkish princess who hadbeen given in marriage to cement good relations between the two states. Some Islamic sources follow one tradition and praise Hormizd asbeing more just than his father, especially with the common folk. Others condemn him as tyrannical and cruel. The Christians ofthe Sasanian empire considered him friendly and praised his reign. At news of the accession of Hormizd, Tiberius attempted tobring the conflict between the two empires to a close more orless on terms ofthe status quo ante helium. Hormizd, however, refused to surrender Dara, even in exchange forseveral forts in Armenia conquered by the Byzantines. The Persians also wanted a large annual subsidy, but no agreement wasreached and the war continued. Maurice proved a capable general and ravaged the northwestern provinces of the Sasanian empire at theendof 579, but in 580 his plans tomarch tothe enemy's capital Ctesiphon failed. In 5 81a large Persian army was defeated by Maurice near the city of Constantina in Mesopotamia. The sickness andsubsequent death of Tiberius in

582 caused Maurice to leave the east for Constantinople, andhis successor in the field was wholly incompetent. Hewas defeated in two battles with the Sasanians, and Maurice, the newByzantine emperor, replaced him with his brother-in-law Philippicus. It would be too tedious to follow the attacks and counter-attacks of the Persian and Byzantine armies in theMesopotamian theatre of war until 589. Suffice it to say that both sides suffered from the constant warfare with no decisive advantage to either. The war remained asa festering wound for both empires.
It wasunlucky for Hormizd that other foes of his took advantage of the exhausting wars with Byzantium. Some Arab tribes raided lower Iraq, but the greatest danger came from the east. The Turks, either at theinstigation of the Byzantines, or desirous of plunder, invaded the north-eastern provinces of the Sasanian empire. The sources regarding the battles of the Persians against the Turks and their Hephthalite subjects areconfused, primarily because of the legends andtales which developed about the leader of the Sasanian army, Bahram Chobin. There exist in later Arabic and Persian versions many stories about Bahram, some of them identical to the stories concerning Bahram Gor, a confusion common in Sasanian history when two kings or heroes have the same name. It seems that Bahram Chobin, a member of the Mihran family from Ray and related to the Arsacids, was the commander of the troops of the east, and he decisively defeated the invaders. According to Islamic sources, Bahram conquered Balkhand crossed the Oxus, where he defeated the enemy army and killed the enemy king in 588 or 589. It is doubtful if the king was theruler of the western Turks; more likely he was a chief of the Hephthalites, vassals of the Turks, or perhaps only a representative of the great ruler of the Turks. In any case, after his victories in the east Bahram wassent to the Caucasus to repel an invasion of nomads, quite possibly the Khazars. Here too he seems to have been successful although details are lacking.
Bahram then was made commander of the Persian forces against the Byzantines and he opened hostilities in Georgia. Again Bahram was victorious, but subsequently a Byzantine army defeated him onthe banks of the Araxes river. This was a signal for Hormizd, who had become jealous of his popular general, to remove Bahram from office. Bahram reacted by staging a rebellion, the details of which are given by theByzantine historian Theophylactus Simocatta. Persian troops in

Iraq sent against therebels made common cause with Bahram's army in Armenia, and the combined forces marched onthe capital Ctesiphon. Hormizd tried invain to organize effective resistance against the rebels. The Sasanian aristocracy, however, did not support the son of Khusrau. The religious leaders, too,were not pleased by his tolerance of the Christians andother religious minorities, so themonarch found himself surrounded by enemies. Hormizd had imprisoned many nobles, and now a palace revolt freed them, while the rebels inCtesiphon seized Hormizd and imprisoned him. The leaders of the overthrow in Ctesiphon were two brothers-in-law of the ruler called Bindoe and Bistam. Hormizd was blinded andhis sonKhusrau Abarvez or Parvez,"the victorious", was raised to thethrone. This was in February 590, and some time later Hormizd was putto death.
At first the new king tried to conciliate Bahram Chobln, whowas near the capital with his army when the events mentioned above occurred. An exchange of messages produced no settlement, so Khusrau prepared to fight Bahram. Theking marched forth to battle near Hulwan, but the twoarmies did not engage in a major battle. Khusrau saw that he could nothope to defeat Bahram, so he fled to Ctesiphon and then towards the Byzantine frontier. Bindoe, who accompanied his nephew on his flight, was able tothrow off the pursuers sent byBahram, butsubsequently hewas taken prisoner while his king escaped to thewest. Khusrau was received bythe Byzantine governor of Circesium in March 5 90 andthePersian monarch sent a letter and then a mission to Maurice requesting his aid against Bahram. At the same time Bahram sent emissaries to Constantinople to counter the proposals ofKhusrau. According to Byzantine writers, Bahram offered to give the Byzantines Nisibis andall the Mesopotamian territory to the Tigris, whereas Khusrau offered Dara, Martyropolis (Maiferqat) and part of Armenia, and promised that he would never again ask for a yearly subsidy. Furthermore, hestressed his royal right to the throne emphasizing the principle of legitimacy. After some debate at Constantinople, the Byzantine emperor agreed toaid Khusrau, so he released Persian prisoners the Byzantines held, sending them to serve under Khusrau, while a Byzantine army was prepared to assist Khusrau to regain his throne.
Bahram Chobln haddifficulty in asserting his claims in theempire, since hedid not belong to the family of Sasan, butrather, it seems, was descended from the Arsacid royal house, long extinct. Bahram realized
164



REVITALIZATION OF THE EMPIRE
that hewould have to stop theattempt of Khusrau to regain his throne on the frontier, so he sent a general called Zadespras to hold the key city ofNisibis. But the city ofNisibis had already gone over to Khusrau and thearmy sent by Bahram was defeated andthecommander killed. The chronology of events is somewhat uncertain, but it seems that Khusrau hadto wait sixor seven months for theByzantines to decide what they would do. During this time he sent his uncle Bistam into Armenia to organize resistance to Bahram. Bindoe, the other uncle, escaped from Bahrain's prison and made his way north to join the growing opposition. In thespring of 591 Khusrau began his march to regain his throne, supported by a Byzantine army under a general called Narses.
The city of Dara, in Persian hands since 573, was surrendered to the Byzantines, one of the payments of Khusrau for Byzantine support. Another Byzantine army marched from Armenia, andthe plan was to catch Bahram between the southern and northern armies. Bahrain's forces were defeated in Mesopotamia, and by a flanking movement one of Khusrau's lieutenants seized Ctesiphon. Bahram was a brilliant general, however, and even with inferior numbers hewas able to inflict large casualties on hisenemies. None theless hewas obliged to retreat to Azerbaijan andin a decisive battle Khusrau, with hisByzantineand Armenian allies, was able to defeat Bahram completely. Bahram fled to the Turks, where he remained for a year until he was assassinated, probably at theinstigation of Khusrau.
The life of Bahram Chobin was told in a Pahlavi romance which passed into Persian and Arabic versions. Firdausl gives the essentials of the story of the rise and fall of Bahram in his Shdh-ndma, and the hero is revealed asthe heroic prototype ofa Persian chevalier or knight. His exploits, greatly embroidered of course, remained in the memories of Persians for centuries. Although he was in the end unsuccessful, his human qualities gave him a greater place in the hearts of his countrymen than the king of kings, as witnessed by the stories.
Khusrau II rewarded those whohad supported him and executed his opponents. Oneof the former, whoreceived many honours and a governorship, was the Armenian Smbat, head ofthe house of Bagratuni. With regard to his uncles whohad supported him, Khusrau was ina dilemma, since they had overthrown his father. He finally seized Bindoe and drowned him, whereas Bistam escaped and raised the standard of revolt in the Alburz mountains. On the plateau Bistam
165



IRAN UNDER THE SASANIANS
was able to maintain himself for almost a decade, for thebattles with troops sent against him by Khusrau were indecisive. Bistam was able to prolong his resistance ingreat part because ofthe support given him by former partisans of Bahram Chobln. So in effect Bistam was a successor of Bahram. He established his capital at Ray and minted coins, thus showing his claim to rule instead of Khusrau. Finally Bistam was murdered by one of his eastern allies, a Hephthalite or Turkish chief. By601 Iran was once more united under Khusrau,but it had been weakened greatly bythe internal strife.
The territory promised by Khusrau to Maurice was ceded to Byzantium by a treaty inthe autumn of 591, and peace reigned between the twoempires. TheGhassanid Arabs, clients of the Byzantines in Syria, however, raided Persian territory which caused Maurice to send as his envoy George, the praetorian prefect or commander ofthe eastern forces of Byzantium, to Khusrau to assure him that theArabs had acted on their own.Peace was reaffirmed and declarations of continued friendship were so strong that some Armenian writers believed that Khusrau hadbeen converted to Christianity. He had a Christian wife called Shirin, and legend also assigned tohim as another wife Maria the daughter of Maurice, which wasmost unlikely. Here again the legend of Khusrau and Shirin in Persian poetry hadmany ramifications. Although the king was himself not a Christian, he did show considerable sympathy to Christians, andhe even gave money or presents to Christian shrines. In the writings of Christian authors Khusrau II hasreceived a good name.
Until the overthrow of the emperor Maurice by Phocas in Constantinople, we hear little about Byzantine-Persian relations in this reign, or about the internal affairs ofthe Sasanian empire. We may presume that Khusrau wasoccupied with the revolt of his uncle andin consolidating his position. He obviously had to reward the Byzantine soldiers who hadhelped him to thethrone, andsome Persians felt he was toofriendly to their traditional enemies. Likewise the supporters of Bahram Chobln were notallexecuted or even removed from office, and many Persians opposed toKhusrau still held positions ofauthority. Among those who incurred the enmity of the king of kings was Nu'man III, the Nestorian king of the Lakhmid Arabs with their capital at Hira. Some sources saythat theArab king hadnot helped Khusrau when thelatter had fled to Byzantine territory and requested Nu'man to come with him,but this is unlikely. There were many
166



REVITALIZATION OF THE EMPIRE
reasons, however, for the enmity of the two monarchs, and it seems in the early years of Khusrau's reign hostilities broke out between the Arabs and Persians. Nu'man wascaptured by a ruse about 602 and later he died in prison. Khusrau resolved to end the dynasty of the Lakhmids, soin their place a chief of the Tayy tribe was made head of the Arabs under Persian control, but with a Persian governor at his side. The newsituation disturbed the status quo and bedouin Arab tribes felt free to raid thesettled areas of Iraq. A large tribe, theBakr, allied with other Arabs, metthe Persians and their Arab allies in the famous battle of Dhu Qar. The Persians were decisively defeated, which showed theArabs their strength when united. It also revealed the weakness of the Sasanian defence system ontheedge of the desert once theLakhmids were gone. Theoldsystem hadnot only held the Arabs at bay, but the Lakhmids had also maintained a far-flung hegemony over warring tribes which could have caused much trouble for the Sasanians. Theway for the expansion of Islam wasindicated by this battle which took place about 604, although theexact year is unknown.
Events in Byzantium overshadowed even theinternal affairs of the Sasanian empire. In 602the Byzantine army in the Balkans revolted and, ledbyanofficer Phocas, marched onthecapital. Maurice, finding no support among the populace, fled. He was captured and executed together with his five sons. There are many reasons for the fall of Maurice, butone ofimportance which concerns uswas his persecution of the Monophysites andothers in theByzantine empire who had not conformed to theCouncil of Chalcedon. Revolts broke outin various parts of the empire at theaccession of Phocas. A rumour spread that Theodosius, theeldest sonof Maurice, hadescaped themassacreand fled to Persia. In thespring of 603 when a Byzantine envoy arrived at the Sasanian court announcing the accession of Phocas, hewas thrown into prison. Khusrau had anexcellent pretext to declare war onByzantium to avenge themurder of his oldbenefactor Maurice.
The city of Edessa refused to recognize thenew emperor, so Phocas sent an army to besiege the rebels. In 604Khusrau marched against the forces of Phocas. The Persians defeated the Byzantine army besieging Edessa, which then opened its gates to Khusrau. It seems that in Edessa Khusrau found a pretender to thethrone of Byzantium who was proclaimed as Theodosius sonof Maurice, thetrue emperor, by Khusrau. After a siege of about nine months thetown of Dara fell
167



IRAN UNDER THE SASANIANS
to Persian hands andanother Byzantine army was defeated. Khusrau then resolved to take advantage of the disorder in the Byzantine empire and expand theSasanian domains.
One army moved into that small part ofArmenia still under Byzantine rule and met with complete success. A marzban was sent by Khusrau to Dvin, the chief town of Byzantine Armenia, and theSasanian army continued its campaigns into Cappadocia. Tothesouth Sasanian arms were equally successful, for in 606the border towns of Amida and Resaina were taken and the Euphrates crossed. Cities of Syria were captured. In Constantinople several plots to overthrow Phocas were discovered and the instigators were executed. Theinternal quarrels and fighting of political factions, especially the "blues" and the "greens", in the large cities of the Byzantine empire, deepened the chaotic conditions, making it easier forthe Persians in their conquests. Meanwhile a new group of rebels against Phocas seized North Africa and after a short struggle established their control over Egypt in 609. In 610 the rebels reached the capital and Phocas was deposed and executed. Heraclius, thechief of the rebels who had come from North Africa, was crowned emperor, butsoon hewould have to face a great Persian threat even to the capital.
In 610 Persian forces had again crossed theEuphrates and captured Circesium andother cities. Heraclius sent an embassy to Khusrau to make peace butKhusrau had resolved to continue hisconquests. The Sasanian army from Armenia had occupied Caesarea Mazaca, thechief city of Cappadocia, but in 611 a new Byzantine army sent by Heraclius drove their enemies out of the city. Heraclius took command of the Byzantine armies himself but theSasanians proved toostrong. In 613 Heraclius sent an old Byzantine general, Philippicus, into Armenia while he moved to the south. In this area, however, Sasanian arms were triumphant near Antioch. Shortly afterwards they captured Damascus, and to the north they defeated the Byzantines near the Cilician Gates, capturing Tarsus. Philippicus was forced to retreat from Armenia, so on all sides the Persians were victorious.
The following year a Sasanian general Shahrbaraz took Jerusalem after a short siege. The true cross was taken to Ctesiphon aspart of the booty. In 615 the northern Persian army under the command of a general called Shahin marched through Anatolia to Chalcedon, opposite the capital. Attempts to make peace failed and thePersians continued their conquests of various towns in Anatolia. Meanwhile bands of
168



REVITALIZATION OF THE EMPIRE
Slavs and the Avars devastated the Balkan provinces and Greece. It seemed asthough Heraclius was faced with animpossible task to regain the lost Byzantine possessions. In 617 the Avar king reached Constantinople, so the capital was caught between the Avars on the European coast and the Persians on the Asiatic coast.
In the spring of 619 Persian troops entered Egypt and besieged Alexandria, which soon fell. Thepatriarch andthegovernor of Egypt fled to Cyprus and the entire country was occupied. Thus the main source of grain for the capital wascut off. Heraclius resolved to leave Constantinople forNorth Africa where supplies and men might provide a better base for the reconquest of the empire, but the people ofthe capital persuaded himto remain. Thesituation remained critical.
Khusrau had in effect re-established the Achaemenian empire, but he had not annihilated his enemy. Heraclius instituted a number of radical reforms, including dividing the empire into large military zones, the theme system, each under a military chief. This meant that native military units would become the chief support of the state rather than mercenaries, although many Slavs, for example, were settled in Anatolia to work as farmer-soldiers. The church contributed gold and silver, and Heraclius opened a crusade or holy war against the enemy. The Byzantines controlled the seas, not only because of their vastly superior naval power, butbecause of the excellent training of their crews, the useof Greek fire andgeneral technical superiority. This enabled Heraclius in April 622to sail into theBlack Seawith an army and to launch an expedition into Armenia, thus outflanking the Persians. The Persians followed Heraclius but in a battle they were decisively defeated. Consequently Asia Minor was cleared of Sasanian troops.
The Avars were constrained to peace by the payment of tribute on the part of Heraclius. Attempts to make peace with Khusrau failed, and in a bold stroke Heraclius again invaded Armenia in the spring of 623. Shahrbaraz and Shahin were both sent by Khusrau against Heraclius, but the latter was able to penetrate Azarbaljan where he captured and plundered the Sasanian sanctuary and fire temple at Ganzak. Then he retired northward to winter quarters. The following year Heraclius defeated several Persian detachments but no decisive victory was secured. The Byzantine emperor, however, did re-establish his authority in Anatolia. Khusrau was persuaded that only a bold stroke against Constantinople would end the war,so he entered into
169



IRAN UNDER THE SASANIANS
negotiations with theAvars tomake a joint attack on thecapital. Both Shahrbaraz andShahin were toco-operate with theKhan ofthe Avars and his allies of Slavs, Bulgars and others. Able useof Byzantine sea power rendered theco-operation ofthe Persians andAvars ineffectual, and, in short, both enemies of Byzantium were defeated.
Meanwhile Heraclius hadnotreturned tothecapital, butinsteadhe built up hisarmy intheCaucasus region andmade an alliance with the Khazars. In the autumn of 627 the allies advanced southward against the Persians, spreading destruction in Azarbaijan. Notmeetingany strong opposition, Heraclius resolved to cross themountains to the plains of Mesopotamia. The Khazars withdrew but Heraclius pushed on until he camped near the ancient ruins of Nineveh, where in December he defeated a Persian army which had followed him. Khusrau at once ordered the recall of the Persian army, commanded by Shahrbaraz, from Chalcedon. But Heraclius moved on Dastagird, where Khusrau hada palace, and waswaiting for him. Khusrau, however, lost heart and fled to Ctesiphon, while Heraclius occupied and plundered Dastagird where he found enormous treasures. Then Heraclius withdrew andretraced hissteps, going into winter quarters.
DECLINE OF THE EMPIRE
Meanwhile Khusrau was looking for scapegoats for his defeat,and among others he decided to execute Shahrbaraz. Before he could carry out this plan a revolt broke out,and Khusrau was imprisoned and murdered at theend of February 628. Shiroe, sonof Khusrau, ascended thethrone as Kavad II. Hehadjoined the rebels and agreed to theexecution of his father. The new ruler at once sought peace with Heraclius and agreed to recall Sasanian troops from Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor and western Mesopotamia, andto observe the pre-war boundaries. Allprisoners were to be returned, and the true cross and other relics restored. Both sides rejoiced inthe termination of hostilities which had bled both empires for so many years.
Shahrbaraz, however, was dissatisfied, andsince he was the commander ofa large army hewas dangerous. But after a reign of less than a year Kavad II died, probably of theplague, andwassucceeded by his son Ardashir III, still an infant. Shahrbaraz decided to seizethe throne himself, soinJune 629, presumably with thesupport of Heraclius, he marched on Ctesiphon, defeated the forces of Ardashir and
170



DECLINE OF THE EMPIRE
killed him andhis chief followers. Shahrbaraz ascended the throne, but his rule lasted less than two months before hetoo was murdered. Another pretender in the eastern part of the empire, a nephew of Khusrau, was also murdered before he could come to Ctesiphon as Khusrau III. Since no sons of Khusrau II were left alive, thenobles raised his daughter Boran to thethrone, thefirst woman to occupy this position, but shedied after a rule of little more than a year. A succession of rulers followed one another, each ruling only a few months, and we know little more than their names, Azarmedukht, sister of Boran, Peroz II, Hormizd V andKhusrau IV.Finally the nobles raised Yazdgard III, son ofa certain Shahryar and grandson of Khusrau II, almost thelast living member of the house of Sasan, to the throne in 632. Yazdgard had been living almost in hiding in Stakhr and it was there, in a fire temple called after the name of the first king ofthe dynasty, that the last king of kings was crowned.
Before outlining thelife of Yazdgard, a fewwords arenecessary about the long reign of Khusrau II, the last great monarch of the dynasty. Regardless of the conflicting accounts of his character, the splendour ofhis reign is recognized by the Arabic and Persian sources. He is supposed to have amassed agreat fortune, including a magnificent throne, and his court became legendary for its luxury. The rock-carving of Khusrau II at Taq-i Bustan near Kirmanshah isanunusual example of a sumptuous hunting party depicted in great detail. Khusrau was a great builder and his palaces in Dastagird, east of Ctesiphon, and in Qasr-i Shirin, supposedly named after his queen, were famous in Islamic sources. Likewise the king's love of poetry and music is attested by themusicians at his court such as thefamous Barbad. That the court of Khusrau had some of the same refined degeneracy of the courts of the old Roman emperors is attested bythe Pahlavl text of " King Khusrau and his page", where knowledge of rare foods and perfumes, skill ingames and musical instruments, and the like, are mentioned as
part ofthe education ofa page.1
We have mentioned thetolerance of Khusrau in theearly part of his reign towards the Christians, andduring hisreign the Christian religion spread widely throughout the Sasanian empire. The disputes between Nestorians and Monophysites broke into open conflict several times during his reign. Whereas Nestorianism had been dominant,the king favoured the Monophysites, partly because ofhis friendship with
1 J. Unvala, King Husrav and His Boy(Paris, 1923), pp. 1-29.



IRAN UNDER THE SASANIANS
Gabriel, a doctor at court, andalso because Khusrau's queen Shirin became a Monophysite. At the end of his reign, however, Khusrau sanctioned thepersecution of Christians. Although the Zoroastrian church seems to have been in a state of decadence and decay, Khusrau II built fire temples and probably encouraged thework of further codification of the Avesta. The fixed ritual of Zoroastrianism, however, seems to have discouraged philosophic thought, for there is no evidence of Zoroastrian intellectual activities atthe end ofthe empire. The plundering ofthe great sanctuary of the Gushnasp fire temple at Shiz by Heraclius must have dismayed and shaken the Zoroastrian clergy. All inall, the reign of Khusrau was noted for itsdevotion to luxury more than its devotion to thought. The pretensions ofusurpers to the throne have been mentioned, and most of them were generals. Weknow that at the time of the Arab conquests the marzbans in Khurasan were practically independent of the court at Ctesiphon, and one may ascribe this weakness of the state to theresults of the reform of Khusrau I, when hedivided theempire into four parts, each guarded by a spahbad. The names of the various local rulers, especially in theeast and in theCaspian provinces, at the time of the Arab conquests, indicate the degree to which the Sasanian empire had become a feudal state of landed nobility. This nobility was basically unwilling to rally to thesupport of the central authority and unwilling to unite in the face of an enemy.
Under Yazdgard III, his chief minister and commander ofthe central army was called Rustam. The latter tried to rally the Sasanian forces in the face of a united Arab threat, butin 636 thePersians were defeated and Rustam was killed at the battle of Qadisiyya, near Hira. The following year Ctesiphon was occupied by the victorious army of Islam. Yazdgard fled to the plateau, hoping to rally the Persians to oppose thenew menace. The treasures of Ctesiphon were sent to the caliph 'Umar who reputedly displayed the crown of Khusrau in the Ka'ba of Mecca. The Arabs invaded theplateau andin 642won the battle of Nihavand, which putan endto theimperial Sasanian army. Yazdgard, fleeing, sought aid on all sides. Hehadrequested Chinese aid in 638 but noone came to help the dying cause. Finally hecame to Marv, but themarzban of Marv, Mahoe, wished to be rid of an unwelcome guest and resolved to seize Yazdgard. The latter fled andhid in a mill where hewas murdered. This happened in 651 and marksthe
end of the Sasanian empire.1

EPILOGUE
The fall ofthe Sasanian empire has been discussed byhistorians many times,1 and the exhaustion of the two empires, the Byzantine andthe Persian, after years of strife, frequently has received prime attention as the main reason forthe victory ofthe Arabs. An overall survey of the long relations between thetwo great empires would strengthen this view.
The Sasanians inherited from the Parthians a legacy of overtwo centuries of conflict with thewestern power. With a Sasanian belief in the destiny of Iran to rule over the territories once held by the Achaemenians, it wasinevitable that wars between the two great powers would continue. The Sasanians might have to fight on their eastern andnorthern frontiers, just as the Romans hadto hold the limes against the Germans and as the Byzantines sought to regain territories in Italy, Spain and elsewhere lost to Germanic kingdoms. But the main opponent, and the only worthy opponent, ofeach empire was the other. Only between rulers of equal standing could proper treaties be made and affairs satisfactorily regulated. This does not mean that Persians and Romans never broke agreements orengaged indeceit towards theother party, butthePersians andtheRomans regarded each other as different from the rest ofthe world, which was somehow barbarian. For thePersians, the Roman Caesars were theonly fitting and equal counterparts of the rulers of Iran. Likewise "the king of kings" wasregarded with considerable aweby the Romans. This attitude continued to the time of the Arab conquests.
The Sasanian claim torule territories extending tothe Mediterranean and Aegean seas was an overall impetus to conflict, although usually the Armenian question, conflicts of interest in Georgia and Transcaucasia, or Arab incursions in Mesopotamia would provide acasus belli. The Romans, andthen theByzantines, who were regarded as Romans by the Persians, were more on the defensive, more seeking to maintain the status quo than their opponents, although they too were not above offensive acts to extend their frontiers. By the middle ofthe 6th century, however, thesystem of defences on both sides ofthe Mesopotamian frontier had produced what amounted to a stalemate. Both Byzantine and Sasanian diplomacy sought to extend the area of conflict, as well as alliances, far beyond thefrontiers of both states. I believe that relations of both sides with theTurks in Central Asia

and with theEthiopians andthepeople of southern Arabia were part of the enlargement of spheres of activity of both empires on a world stage, in onesense a forerunner of the extent of the Arab conquests. Just as in the time of the Achaemenians, at the endof the Sasanian empire ideas of the oecumene or world-state were in theair. Some have argued that the spread of Christianity across Iran into Central Asia andto China was part of this sentiment for ecumenism and even for a universal empire, but Christians were sharply divided at thebeginning of the 7th century. TheNestorian Christians of the Sasanian empire, who hadbroken with other Christians at thesynod of Beth Lapat (Gundeshapur) in483 and atlater councils, were quarrelling with the Monophysites, just asthe Monophysites in the Byzantine empire were quarrelling with the Orthodox leaders in Constantinople. Christianity had made many conversions in the Sasanian empire at the expense of Zoroastrianism, butit was far from becoming thereligion of the majority as some scholars have surmised. It is true that Zoroastrianism hadbecome stultified with toomuch concern for rites and rituals, andthelack of anecumenical drive such as Christianity maintained, but itwas the state church of the Sasanian empire. Unfortunately, its fate wasclosely bound up with the state, which accounts for its decline or stagnation after theArab conquests. The Sasanians did overextend themselves in thebrief fulfilment of their ambitions to reconstitute the Achaemenian empire in the last years of Khusrau II, but just as the extended diplomatic activities weakened them, sodid their military feats. The Persian forces were too few effectively to hold andrule Egypt, Palestine andAnatolia. Their victory proved hollow, and the subsequent events brought the prestige of the court to thelowest level in thehistory of the Sasanian empire. The ruler, and his court, provided the sole centre of allegianceand support for the nobility andthepeople. That allegiance and support were almost gone before thebattle of Qadisiyya.
The story of the Arab conquest of Iran to thedeath of Yazdgard is clear in ournow ample sources. Each province andeven city had to fend for itself. Unity, a common allegiance anda common causedid not exist, and the inspired Muslim armies conquered the provinces one after the other. It was not a quick and easy conquest, for there was much fighting before theArabs could claim theland as theirs. Once the imperial Sasanian army was crushed onthe plains of Mesopotamia, however, there were no regular, trained troops tooppose the conquerors

EPILOGUE
until they reached the frontiers of the Sasanian empire in the east, with the military centre of Marv, and in the north at Darband and the frontier of the Caucasus. By that time (Arabs were not settled in Marv until after 665, and they hardly reached Darband before 655) there was no incentive for the frontier troops to fight the conquerors of their homeland. The terms of peace made by the Arab armies with various cities and districts, frequently making smaller demands than the previous taxes paid to the central government of the Sasanians, induced many Persians to submit. It is clear that few subjects of the Sasanian state were concerned about the fate of the court or of the central government; local interests predominated, and the Arabs did not even have to pursue a policy of divideet impera^ for the divisions already existed. As long as the Arabs left alone local affairs, the change in masters above them had little interest for the local people. They had no incentive to fight for a court which took little notice of them. New masters who exacted fewer taxes than the old were to be welcomed rather than fought. Such was the psychology of many Persians. When the Arabs reached the Sasanian frontier in Central Asia, they found the people no more united among themselves than the Persians, but the Sogdians and Khwarazmians had had long experience in fighting the Sasanians or Turks, and playing off one against the other. They were more proud of their local independence than the people of the Sasanian empire. It was only natural that the descendants of Yazdgard, and those who hoped for a restoration of the Sasanian empire, would turn to the east for possible assistance. Even China itself loomed as a possible haven and support for Sasanian pretenders.
The Sasanians throughout their history had not maintained regular relations with China, for trade had been carried on by middlemen, principally the Sogdians, from their most important centre at Samarkand. Furthermore, during the entire Sasanian period China was neither unified nor did it advance any claims to that territory held in Central Asia under the powerful Later Han dynasty (A.D. 25-220). Warring dynasties kept the Chinese preoccupied with internal affairs until the establishment of a unified government under the Sui dynasty (589-618). But it was only under the T'ang dynasty (618-906) that China once again felt strong enough to extend its influence into Central Asia. The expansion of T'ang China, and the great interest in the west by the Chinese, corresponded with the decline and fall of the Sasanian empire. There had been, of course, some contacts between



IRAN UNDER THE SASANIANS
Iran and China before theT'ang dynasty. Manichaean and Christian missionaries had brought their doctrines to theFarEast, andsome traders and soldiers of fortune had made their way from Iran to the distant "Middle Kingdom". But most contacts were through Sogdians and Turks, forTurkic dynasties ruled over parts of China during the period ofthe "Warring States".
As mentioned above, according to Chinese sources Yazdgard III sent an embassy toChina in638 seeking aid invain against the Arabs.1 One of the sons of Yazdgard, called Peroz, took the title of "king of kings" and sought toenlist the support of the Sogdians and Hephthalite princes inTukharistan (now called Badakhshan in Afghanistan) against the Arabs. Chinese sources say that Peroz sent anembassy to the T'ang court for help, but the Chinese emperor considered the distance too great to offer any effective aid, and the envoy returned to Peroz without troops or money.2 The sources report that Peroz was supported, however, by the troops ofTukharistan. Peroz again turned to China for aid about the year 662, but all he received was recognition as a ruler and a promise toinvestigate the possibility ofaid, which did not materialize. Shortly afterwards Peroz was defeated by theArabs and finally came himself to the Chinese court where in677 he requested permission to build a temple in the Chinese capital of Ch'ang-an, presumably a Zoroastrian temple.3 The date of his death is uncertain, but heleft a son who tried to recoup his fortunes in Tukharistan and Sogdiana against theArabs but failed. The Chinese court continued to recognize the existence of a ruler of Persia until the middle of the 8th century, but it was only a fiction.4 None theless, the continuing fiction indicates that hopes for a restoration ofSasanian power, atleast in Central Asia or eastern Iran, hadnot faded among the refugee nobility. Many Sasanian nobles must have fled toCentral Asia and even to China from Iran, and they surely contributed to the spread of the Persian language in such cities asBukhara and Samarkand in placeof Sogdian. A Middle Persian-Chinese bilingual inscription ona gravestone hasbeen found near thetown of Sian in Shensi province of western China. It records the death of a princess of the Suren family from the year 872 or 874, evidence of the late persistence of Sasanian families inexile.5

EPILOGUE
Other members of the Sasanian royal family at different times sought to raise the flag of revolt against the Arab masters of Iran, but all failed. These revolts are part of Islamic history, but again they testify to a certain persistence of allegiance among the' Persian nobility to the Sasanian dynasty, when its restoration was beyond hope. The traditions of Sasanian Iran were to continue into Islamic Iran, however, where many institutions and cultural legacies were to assert themselves in the new synthesis of an ecumenical culture of Islam under the 'Abbasids. It is ironic that the Persian aristocracy was not prepared to rally to and to defend Yazdgard in his time of need but later maintained and fostered Sasanian culture and traditions even against the Arabs and Islam. In a sense, Sasanian Iran experienced a rebirth under the 'Abbasids, for it was the Sasanians who provided the patterns and background for the splendour of the imperial court of Baghdad.

CHAPTER 5
THE HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
Even during theheyday of the Achaemenian empire an active partwas played in its history by the peoples of eastern Iranian stock and language. As early as the battle of Marathon (490 B.C.)the Sakas Iranian nomads of Central Asia - had fought side by side with the elite troops of the Persian centre. On board thePersian fleet at Salamis in 480 B.C.the marines, a corps no doubt specially selected for their reliability, included Sakas as well as Medes and Persians. In addition the land army which Xerxes led to Greece in the same year contained many eastern Iranian contingents. The "Amyrgian" Sakas of Herodotus (who arecalled the Saka Haumavarga in the Old Persian inscriptions, and who,in the hieroglyphic inscriptions of Darius I from the Suez Canal are defined as the "Sakas of the plains", as opposed to the
"Sakas of the marshes")1 were then brigaded with the Bactrians under the command of Hystaspes, a son of Darius. Also present were the people of Aria (Herat), ledby Sisamnes; Parthians andChorasmians led by Artabazus; Sogdians under Azanes, andSarangians (Drangians), from the country of the lower Helmand, under Pherendates. The Chorasniian, Dargman b. Harshin, named in an Aramaic papyrus of 464 B.C.from Elephantine in Egypt, and engaged in litigation over
land with one of the Jewish inhabitants,2 could thus have been a pensioned survivor from Xerxes' Grand Army. In this way,the principal eastern Iranian nations, both nomadic and sedentary, make their first appearance in the pages of history. At this early date they were naturally somewhat overshadowed bytheir rulers, theMedesand Persians, whose closer acquaintance with the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia had given them a lead in the techniques of centralized government, and so enabled them to dominate their eastern neighbours. Ultimately, however, the sedentary eastern Iranians, such as the Chorasmians andSogdians, were able to achieve virtual or complete independence. The nomadic Sakas in their turn were even able toset up an extensive empire, including a large part of northern India, during the 1st century B.C.

HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
It was during the campaigns of Alexander the Great, after the Macedonians had overrun the western provinces ofthe Persian empire, that the eastern Iranian element became especially prominent inthe Persian camp. For the Persians at the battle of Gaugamela (331 B.C.) an important part was played by theBactrian and Saka cavalry, whilst contingents from Parthia, Sogdia and Arachosia are also mentioned. The leader ofthe Sakas at this battle bore thename of Mauakes, which in its later form Maues was to become famous once again in the history of the Indo-Scythian empire (see below, p. 194). Themajority of these eastern Iranian troops had been mustered by Bessus, who after the Persian defeat quickly emerged as the most powerful of the Persian leaders under Darius III. Thus after the assassination of the king, it was Bessus who assumed the royal prerogatives, and retired to his satrapy of Bactria to carry on thestruggle against Alexander in eastern Iran.
Alexander's pursuit of Bessus thus brought about a Macedonian invasion of the eastern provinces, where a Macedonian influence was established more lasting than that which had been introduced into western Iran. From Artacoana, probably at the site of the modern city of Herat, a wide southward sweep led the conqueror across Drangiana andArachosia to thevalley of the Kabul river, and the foot of the Hindu Kush. To secure hiscommunications in these provinces, many fortified cities were founded by Alexander; Artacoana was replaced by Alexandria-amongst-the-Arians; in Drangiana, Alexandria-Prophthasia provided a garrison centre; Alexandria-amongst-theArachosians was sited, astherecently discovered inscriptions of Asoka seem to imply, at the Old City of Qandahar; and Alexandria-of-theCaucasus stood probably on the Salang river at Jabal Suraj, notfar from Charikar. It was from this last foundation that Alexander led his army northwards across therange, thespeed of his movements baffling all attempts at resistance. Theunhappy Bessus retreated to the north bank of the Oxus, but when Alexander threw his troops across the broad river on improvised rafts of hide, the satrap's followers turned against their leader, placing himunder arrest, and handing him over to Alexander for execution.
After the capture of Bessus, Alexander advanced to Maracanda (Samarkand), and thence to the river Jaxartes (SyrDarya). Yet local resistance was by no means at an end. The immediate occasion of the rising which followed was Alexander's order to the local chiefs to
182



HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
assemble for a conference at Bactra, an instruction which was thought to mask some sinister purpose. The communities along the Jaxartes rose and put to death their Macedonian garrisons. Altogether seven walled towns shut their gates on Alexander. These were rapidly reduced by his energetic siege operations, the most considerable of the cities being Cyropolis, a settlement of which the name survives in the present-day Kurkath. The Macedonians in revenge put to death all the male inhabitants of these towns, and enslaved the women and children.
Meanwhile Alexander's forces were being threatened on two other fronts. On the north bank of the Jaxartes a force of Saka horsemen had assembled, and were preparing to attack the Macedonians. At the same time news was received that the garrison which had been left behind at Maracanda was being besieged by the local chief Spitamenes. With covering fire from his siege-catapults, Alexander was able to send his forces across the Jaxartes and disperse the Sakas. But reinforcements sent to relieve the garrison at Maracanda were caught at a disadvantage during an incautious pursuit of the enemy, and were defeated with heavy losses. It was only when Alexander brought up his main army by forced marches from the Jaxartes that the situation was restored. Soon afterwards, Alexander went into winter quarters at Bactra. But towards mid-winter he moved out with five columns and crossed the Oxus to suppress unrest in Sogdiana. Spitamenes consequently transferred his activities to the south bank of the river, and even attempted a raid against Bactra itself. However, he was ultimately defeated in a number of engagements with detachments of the Macedonian cavalry, and eventually returned to Sogdiana. There his Saka auxiliaries turned against him, cutting off his head and sending it to Alexander. Or, if the version of Quintus Curtius (vm. iii. 13) canbe believed, the murder of Spitamenes was the act of his estranged wife.
The turning point in Macedonian relations with the people of Sogdiana was Alexander's marriage to the Iranian heiress Roxana, daughter of the influential chief Oxyartes, a prominent leader of the local resistance to the conqueror. When a mountain stronghold of Oxyartes was captured by the Macedonians, Roxana fell into Alexander's hands. Subsequently he was able to win over Oxyartes, whoin turn effected Alexander's reconciliation with Chorienes, another chief who was still resisting. Thus the bitter hostility which the people of Bactria and Sogdiana had initially displayed towards the Macedonians

HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
was replaced by a mutual understanding, andAlexander was able to enlist theSogdian, Bactrian andSaka cavalry who served him well in India at the battle of the Hydaspes. There is also evidence that Alexander settled in the garrison cities of eastern Iran large numbers of homeless Greek mercenary soldiers. Some of these were no doubt Greek mercenaries who had been in the service of Darius III, though the majority were detachments from Alexander's own forces. The settlements provided thenucleus for the substantial Greek colonization of Bactria andSogdiana which was to become animportant factor inthe history ofthe 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C. Yet these involuntary settlers did not always perform with docility the role for which they had been chosen. In 326 B.C. when Alexander was recovering from wounds sustained during fighting against the Malli in India, a rumour of his death reached the settlers in Bactria and Sogdiana. Weary of their long exile in a distant land, about three thousand men banded themselves together to march back to Greece, but the sources arein conflict as to their fate. Diodorus (xvn. 99. 5) reports that they were massacred byMacedonian troops, but according to Quintus Curtius (ix. 7) they reached their homes. A more serious mutiny of the settlers took place after Alexander's death at Babylon in 323 B.C.According to Diodorus (XVIII. 7. 2) no less than twenty-three thousand men mutinied andset out on their homeward march. They were intercepted andmassacred by Macedonian forces sent out from Babylon by Perdiccas under thecommand of Pithon. Tarn, however, believed that this figure for the number of mutineers was greatly exaggerated.1
After Alexander's death the satrapies of his empire were divided between his officers. Sibyrtius received Arachosia, and Oxyartes, the father of Roxana, was confirmed as satrap of the Paropamisadae along the Kabul river. To Stasanor was allotted Aria andDrangiana, whilst Philip retained the satrapy of Bactria and Sogdiana. During the War of the Successors all these governors supported Eumenes against Antigonus; butafter his final victory near Isfahan Antigonus returned to thewest, leaving them undisturbed in possession oftheir satrapies. In 312 B.C.Seleucus returned to Babylon andfounded the Seleucid empire. He atonce embarked on the reconquest ofthe eastern provinces from their independent satraps. However, hewas less successful when he attempted to invade the Maurya empire of India under its new

HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
ruler Chandragupta. Ultimately Seleucus was obliged to cede tothe Mauryas his easternmost provinces, that is to say at least the Paropamisadae and Arachosia. Though Tarn argued to the contrary,x the recent discovery of inscriptions has made it clear that Maurya control of these two provinces was effective. In addition to the fragmentary Aramaic inscription of Asoka from Laghman now in the Kabul Museum,2 recent years have brought to light two inscriptions of Asoka in the OldCity of Qandahar. Oneof these is a bilingual in Greek and Aramaic describing the benefits conferred on his subjects by Asoka's conversion to Buddhism; thesecond, in Greek only, contains a portion of Asoka's thirteenth pillar edict, and calls for harmony between the Buddhist sects. A third inscription in Aramaic, later reported from Qandahar, contains fragmentary Buddhist texts.3 The presence of these inscriptions confirms that in the time of Asoka (thegrandson of Chandragupta) theMauryas hadeffective control of the Paropamisadae and Arachosia. However, confirmation is lacking for Strabo's inherently less probable statement that a large part of Aria was also ceded by Seleucus to Chandragupta.4
Though obliged to cede his most easterly provinces to the Maurya, Seleucus none the less consolidated his grip on Bactria, Margiana and Sogdiana. Aninvasion of Saka nomads from the north was eventually beaten off, though it appears that they first succeeded in destroying the city of Marv. In 293 B.C.the king's son Antiochus, whose mother, Apame, was the daughter of the Bactrian Spitamenes, and who was thus himself half-Iranian, wasposted to Bactra as joint king to direct the defence of the eastern frontier. In honour of the young prince Marv was refounded under thename of Antiochia-in-Margiana, whilst the Seleucid mint of Bactra issued coins with the joint names of Seleucus and Antiochus. However, when Antiochus succeeded tothe sole rule in 280 B . C , his attention was diverted to the problems of Asia Minor, and the Seleucid hold on eastern Iran began to weaken.
It wasbefore the death of Antiochus I in 261 B.C., as a newlydiscovered inscription of Gurgaan now shows,5 that a certain Andragoras was appointed as Seleucid satrap of Parthia andHyrcania. During the succeeding reign, that of Antiochus II (261-246 B.C.), Andragoras

began to assert a claim to autonomy bythe issue ofcoins ingold and silver. These were, however, inscribed only with the satrap's personal name, and without the royal title. However, within a few years Andragoras had been crushed by a new power, that of Arsaces, founder of the Parthian empire, whooverran the province at the head of his nomadic followers, theParni. Though Wolski has advocated a lower chronology, it seems best to regard thestarting point of the Arsacid era in 247 B.C. as marking the overthrow of Andragoras, and the moment of Arsaces' succession as ruler of Parthia. At about thesame date, andfurther to theeast in Bactria, another Seleucid satrap was working his way toindependent sovereignty. This was the celebrated Diodotus, the founder of the Bactrian kingdom. His rise is marked bythe appearance, oncoins still carrying the name of Antiochus II, ofanew portrait. It isaccompanied by the new ruler's punning device, thefigure of Zeus hurling thethunderbolt. Onlater issues the name ofDiodotus appears with the royal title. According to a statement of Justin (XLI. 4. 9) Diodotus (whom he calls Theodotus) was succeeded by a son of the same name. However, numismatic authorities disagree as to whether the portraits of two Diodoti can reliably bedistinguished onthe coins.
The defection from the Seleucid empire of the satrapies of Bactria and Parthia must have become permanent as a result of difficulties from which the empire suffered after the death of Antiochus II in 246 B.C. According to the remarkable inscription seen at Adulis on
the Red Sea bythe Christian monk Cosmas Indicopleustes1 in the 5 th century A.D., the king of Egypt, Ptolemy III Euergetes, invaded Seleucid territory, crossed the river Euphrates and subjected tohimself Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Susiana, Persis, Media andthe rest of the empire, as far as the borders of Bactriana. Thus Parthia andBactria were for a time left in isolation, and their links with the Seleucid government were never re-established. It was not until the reign ofAntiochus IIIthe Great in 208 B.C. that an attempt was made to reconquer Parthia and Bactria forthe Seleucid empire. Antiochus marched eastwards from Ecbatana, and invaded the province ofHyrcania, which was then part of the Parthian empire. There he captured a palace at Tambrax andstormed the entrenched city of Syrinx, before passing eastwards to cross the river Arius (Hari Rud) and toinvade Bactria. The Bactrians were atthis time under the rule of Euthydemus, a Greek of Magnesia, who directed a stout

HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
resistance. After the Bactrian cavalry had failed to defend the crossing of the Arius, Euthydemus retreated to stand a siege at hiscapital of Bactra, where hewas protected byhigh mud-brick ramparts and extensive marshes. Antiochus besieged the city for two years, but in vain. Then, intimidated by his opponent's threat to admit the dangerous Saka nomads of the northern steppe, Antiochus granted terms. Euthydemus - who claimed he was no rebel, but the slayer of the children of rebels (i.e. of Diodotus) - was allowed to retain his kingdom. However, he surrendered his elephants to Antiochus, and concluded a treaty of alliance with him. At the same time the kingly bearing ofEuthydemus' son Demetrius so impressed the Seleucid that he offered the young prince a daughter in marriage - a contract that seems notto have been fulfilled. Antiochus then marched on to the district of the Paropamisadae, in the upper valley of the Kabul river. There he made terms with the Indian prince Sophagasenus, and returned at last to hiscapital by thelong road through Carmania and Persis. Meanwhile Euthydemus was left alone at Bactra as theruler of the Greeks ofeastern Iran.
Only scattered fragments survive of the works of the ancient historians who told the story of the Bactrian kingdom - in particular Apollodorus of Artemita, and Trogus. These have been pieced together with theevidence of the varied andbeautiful coinage rediscovered over the last hundred and fifty years, with the progress of archaeological exploration in thePunjab and in Afghanistan. The famous work of Tarn, The Greeksin Bactriaand India, provides a stimulating reconstruction of the history of the Bactrian Greeks. Yet sceptical readers have been inclined to suspect an element of exaggeration in the ancient sources, when they speak, for example (Strabo xv. 686), of the "thousand cities" ofBactria,1 or the Indian conquests ofDemetrius, Apollodotus and Menander. Apart from their coins archaeological reconnaissancein northern Afghanistan had until recent years revealed solittle trace of the Bactrian Greek settlements that Foucher wrote with some justification of "le mirage bactrien".2 It was only in 1964 that the site of a great fortified city was discovered by theDelegation Archeologique Frangaise enAfghanistan in Badakhshan, at the junction ofthe rivers Kokcha and Oxus.3 The modern name ofthe site is AiKhanum, and

HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
the peninsula between the two rivers is cut off to the south-east by a system ofpowerful ramparts. Two citadels were discovered, with an upper and lower city, and in the latter pottery of the Hellenistic period was found lying on the surface. This pottery included stamped amphora handles bearing the Greek inscription of an agoranomos. Thus no doubt remains that for thefirst time a definite settlement of the Bactrian Greeks has been located. It may indeed be true that the principal cities of the Bactrian kingdom were situated along the banks of the Oxus river. It supports this view that the famous treasure of GraecoBactrian coins at the Kabul Museum, known asthe Qunduz Hoard, was found atthe mound ofKhisht Tepe, situated onthe banks ofthe
Oxus tothe north-west of Qunduz.1 After the death ofthe emperor Asoka towards 236 B.C. the Maurya empire in India began to disintegrate; we have seen that duringthe campaign ofAntiochus III its northernmost provinces were under the rule of Sophagasenus. The latter also soon disappeared, and in about 190 B.C. the power vacuum in northern India invited aninvasion on the part ofthe Bactrian Greeks. The evidence of their coins suggests that of the Indo-Greek kings descended from Euthydemus, Demetrius I, Apollodotus I and Antimachus I Theus were all prominent inthese expeditions, though their relative chronology has not been finally established. It is clear that the Greeks quickly crossed tothe southof the Hindu Kush range, and established themselves at Kapisa in the upper Kabul valley, the modern Begram; at Pushkalavati (Charsada) near Peshawar; a£Gardiz; and at Taxila in the Punjab. However, a new danger was soon to threaten these Euthydemid princes from the rear. For the formidable Eucratides, perhaps, as Tarn suggested, an emissary of the Seleucid Antiochus IV Epiphanes sent to effect the reconquest of Bactria, hadrisen against Demetrius I north of the Hindu Kush. When the latter returned from India to oppose him, it was only tomeet defeat and death. The subsequent kings who attempted to uphold the Euthydemid cause in Bactria, Euthydemus II, Agathocles andPantaleon, were evidently short lived. Soon the house ofEucratides, which besidesits founder included Eucratides II Soter, Plato and Heliocles, had established undisputed control of this territory. Their success was, however, less overwhelming when they advanced to conquer the Indian territories of the Euthydemids, forthere it seems that a new personality,
1 Curiel and Fussman,~LeTresor monetaire deQundus^ pp. 9, 83—7
189



HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
the celebrated Menander, had arisen to oppose them. It is noteasy to define the connection of Menander with the house of Euthydemus. Tarn suggested that he might have been a general of Demetrius I who married a sister of Agathocles, buttheevidence is tenuous.Yet whatever his origins Menander established himself firmly at Pushkalavati, perhaps after a brief incursion there by Eucratides, andsoon established a powerful kingdom. Since thecoins of Menander are by far the commonest of all the Indo-Greek issues coming to light at Charsada, his reign must have been long. Moreover, his fame amongst the Buddhists of India was so great that hewas made the interlocutor in theBuddhist text Milindapanha ("The Questions of Menander"), a religio-philosophical dialogue in almost the Platonic manner.1
Almost theonly evidence for thelater history of the Indo-Bactrian kings isthe arrangement oftheir coins, a task with which the evolution of the coin legends and the sequence of the monograms afford some help. None theless, substantial uncertainties remain, andthough the list of rulers andtheir approximate sequence canbe determined, the evidence is hardly sufficient to provide the basis for a continuous narrative.
There aregrounds for the belief that the Indian era of c. 155 B.C. (found, for example, in theTaxila copper-plate of Patika,2 and called by Tarn the "Old Saka" era) was in fact an Indo-Bactrian eraestablished by Menander, and commencing from theyear of his accession. If this deduction is correct, the date provides a fixed point inthe history of the later Indo-Bactrian rulers. To the following decade, that running from 145to 135 B.C., must be attributed the career of Antialcidas, theIndo-Bactrian king who is mentioned in the Brahmi inscription of the Besnagar pillar (cf. Narain, The Indo-Greeks,pi. vi). Though theinscription connects theking's ambassador with thecity of Taxila, themonograms of the coins of Antialcidas suggests that he was also in control of Gardiz and Pushkalavati. His authority may in fact have extended over alltheprincipal Indo-Bactrian centres.
In the last generation of Indo-Bactrian rulers, c. 135-125 B.C., the dominant figure is that of Strato I. Hisreign appears to have commenced at Pushkalavati, but to have been interrupted bythe incursions

of several rivals, inparticular bythat ofHeliocles. It could be presumed that the Heliocles known from the Indo-Bactrian coin series is the same personage as figures in thelist of the kings of Bactria, though Whitehead believed that the Indo-Bactrian portrait was of a second
ruler of the same name.1 In any event Strato I later reappears in the coin series of Pushkalavati, andto this second phase of his coinage belong theunusual issues which show the young king's bust jugate with that of a queen who is named as Agathocleia. Shewas believed
by Rapson2 and Tarn to bethe mother of Strato, though it is hard to be sure that she may not actually have been his wife. This issue is immediately followed by another with jugate portraits, that in the joint names of Hermaios andCalliope. Subsequently, however, there are further issues of Strato from thesame mint; butthefourth phase of his coinage, that bearing the titles BASIAEQS SQTHPOS EIIIOANOYS 2TPATON02, is found only in the series attributable to
Taxila and Gardiz.3 Ittherefore appears that Strato transferred his centre of operations to these places from Pushkalavati. At the two former mints, Taxila and Gardiz, the successor of Strato was evidently Archebios; and it waslong ago suggested byTarn, with much plausibility, that Archebios wasinthis area theimmediate predecessor of the first Indo-Scythian ruler, Maues. The table given as Appendix i thus shows theprobable succession ofIndo-Greek andIndo-Scythian rulers in the Indo-Iranian area from the second centuryB.C.
THE NOMAD INVASIONS
The complex anddisturbed succession ofthe later Indo-Bactrian rulers was to a large extent theconsequence of a far-reaching event which took place in approximately 130B.C. This wasthenomad invasion of the Bactrian kingdom. The movement of peoples which swept away the Greek rulers on theBactrian plain had its origins in disturbances far away onthe Central Asian frontiers of China. The story has often
been told of how the Hsiung-nu4 (a tribe from which subsequently originated the Huns of European history) rose to become a great

HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
power and athreat to the rulers of north China. Their kingdom reached its zenith under the great Maotun (c. 209-174 B.C.) who defeated the neighbouring tribes andestablished himself as the overlord of the steppes. To the south-west ofthe Hsiung-nu inKansu province, there pastured another tribal confederacy of rather mixed composition known as the Yueh-chih. These too were defeated byMaotun, whilst further to the north he impinged upon their neighbours the Wu-sun,and drove them also towards the west. After the death of Maotun his son, Giyu, also known as Lao-shang, again attacked the Yueh-chih, routing them, andkilling their king in battle. The survivors of the Yueh-chih, being pastoral nomads like the Hsiung-nu, were finally driven to trek away towards the west, passing, it seems, down the valley ofthe Hi river and along the southern shore ofLake Issyk Kul. From this region they expelled a group of Saka tribes, designated in the Chinese chronicle (theCh'ien Han Shu)1 by the term Sai-wang (meaning "Saka king"), and drove them away tothe south-westwards. On their march, however, the Yueh-chih had collided with the Wu-sun, who now returned toattack them inthe rear, and drive them headlong into Farghana onthe heels ofthe Sakas. Thus soon after 160 B.C. two powerful hordes, the Sakas andthe Yueh-chih, were poised on the Graeco-Bactrian frontier ofthe river Jaxartes.
At this point western sources take up the story of the nomad conquest of Bactria. Scholars generally agree that theYueh-chih of the Chinese sources arein fact identical with thetribe named as the Tochari in the western texts. Subsequent happenings are described in a well-known passage of the Geography of Strabo (xi. 511): "The nomads who became the most famous were those who took away Bactriana from theGreeks - the Asii or Asiani, theTochari, andthe Sacaraucae, who setoutfrom the far bank of the Jaxartes adjoining the Sacae and Sogdiani, which the Sacae had occupied."
The doings ofthe Asiani are also mentioned intwo ofthe Prologues of Pompeius Trogus. Prologue XLI contains the statement " T h e Scythian tribes ofthe Saraucae [read: Sacaraucae] and the Asiani seized Bactra and Sogdiana." This passage corresponds closely with the account given by Strabo, whilst Prologue XLII, referring tolater events, includes thesentence "The Asiani became kings of the Tochari, and
1 Cf.A.Wylie, "Notes onthe Western Regions", Journal ofthe AnthropologicalInstitute xi (1882), 84; K.Jettmar, Die friihen steppen Volker, Baden-Baden, 1964. "Saka" represents the Iranian and Greek forms of the name, written in Latin as "Saca", and in strict transliteration ofthe Indian sources as "Saka".

THE NOMAD INVASIONS
the Saraucae [read:Sacaraucae] were destroyed." It will be seen that although the names may not beetymologically identical, the historical role played bythe Asiani is precisely that ofthe people who later came to be known as the Kushans, founders of the Kushan empire. Itis, moreover, evident that these displaced nomad groups quickly overran the Graeco-Bactrian kingdom lying to the north of the Hindu Kush range. Tarn's deduction seems to be correct that the invasion took place at a date between 141 B.C. and129 B.C, when a wave of nomad invaders is reported byJustin (XLII, 1-2) to have burst into Parthia.
Direct evidence is lacking for the subsequent movements of the nomad tribes. It is likely, however, that the Sakas travelled to the south by way of Herat, passing through Drangiana and the region of the Helmand bend, which subsequently became known as Sakastan, from which derives the region's modern name of Sistan. Later, following in thetracks of Alexander, they would have passed northeastwards through Arachosia, before turning east towards the Indian plain through the various passes inthe Sulaiman range and the Northwest Frontier. Meanwhile the Tochari bequeathed their name to Tukharistan, the region of Qunduz and Baghlan in modern Afghanistan, which commands the northern approaches to the passes of the Hindu Kush. They toowill ultimately have made their way to Gandhara by the more direct, but arduous, route of the mountain passes. However, the march of the Tochari lasted nearly a hundred years longer than that of the Sacaraucae, whowere thus left in almost undisputed control of the Punjab throughout the 1st century B.C.
The theory that theSacaraucae turned westward after their sack of Bactra is confirmed bythe sensational finds of gold treasure excavated in the summer of 1979 by the Soviet archaeologist V.I. Sarianidi at Tilla Tepe, near Shibarghan in Afghanistan. These rich burials around the remains of a prehistoric temple were shown by numismatic and other evidence tobemuch later, 1st century B.C. to 1st century A.D., and were characterized bytheir massive offerings ofgold. The brief reports so far available1 suggest that the objects belonged to two distinct styles. The first, represented by at least one golden libation-bowl (phiale) of strictly Classical form, is presumably to be interpreted as a relic of the Hellenistic civilization of Bactria. Yet the bulk of the finds reflect a specific "Animal style", already known from a bracelet of the Oxus Treasure,2 and apair of gold armlets in Peshawar and at Cologne.3

HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
These southerly finds are manifestly related to the goldwork ofthe Siberian collection of Peter the Great, nowat Leningrad. Yet similar contorted forms, and polychrome inlays in turquoise and garnet, are typical of the gold pieces from Shibarghan. There, however, one remarkable piece, a gold clasp based on a rendering of the Greek god Dionysus in his leopard-chariot, though similarly decorated, was obviously inspired by a Hellenistic prototype. In all probability the Shibarghan burials reflect a westward movement of the Sacaraucae from thepillage of Bactra, loaded notonly with anysurviving Hellenistic treasure, but also with surplus gold that hadbeen melted down, and reworked according to their taste. Evidence notonly for theroute of the Sacaraucae, and for the fantastic opulence of the spoils of Bactra, the excavations also cast light on the origins and inspiration ofthe various schools of Scythian art. A sensitive analysis is likely to show that just as many objects from Siberia illustrate Achaemenian themes remodelled to the taste of thetribal craftsman, so the finds of Shibarghan illustrate a comparable metamorphosis of Hellenistic subjects. For the immediate narrative, however, the impression which results from these new finds is of the astonishing affluence of the Saka chiefs, who, after the capture of Bactra, led their peoples to the conquest of Southern Asia.
Yet if the Sakas travelled, as seems most likely, by the Arachosian route, it is surprising that the first Saka ruler to issue coins was Maues in the heart ofthe Indo-Bactrian kingdom at Taxila. This circumstance
led Narain1 to resort to a theory that Maues andhisSakas hadreached Taxila by travelling southwards from Kashghar over the "Hanging Pass " into Indus Kohistan. It is indeed scarcely credible that a cavalry force should have travelled bysuch precipitous routes; but the problem remains, andits solution could well be that Maues wasa commander of Saka mercenaries in the service of the Greek kings, who gained control of the kingdom from within at a moment when an external Saka onslaught waspending. It is notable that according to Jenkins'
analysis2 the subsequent Saka rulers, such as Vonones, Spalirises and Azes I, issued coins first in Arachosia, as might have been expected in the case ofinvaders coming from the west. Yet aneven more important point which emerges from Jenkins' study is that the immediate successors of Maues at Taxila were not Sakas but Greeks. It was only after the intervening reigns of ApoUodotus II and Hippostratus that Saka rule was once more restored by Azes I.

THE NOMAD INVASIONS
The earliest date for Maues, ifthe reading can be trusted, isprovided by the Maira well inscription of 98 B.C., the latest bythe copper-plate of Patika from Taxila, which is dated to 78 B.C. It appears that Maues died far to the south-east of his capital, at Mathura. For the Lion Capital from that site seems tohave been his monument, with its long inscription containing the names ofmany Saka chiefs, and referring to "solemnities over the illustrious king Muki andhis horse" {Muki -\sri\raya saspa [d\bhusavit[a\). It issaid to have been erected "inhonour of the whole ofSakastan" {sarvasa Sak{r)astanasa puyae). A. H. Dani has indeed recently shown that the writing of certain portions of the inscription displays the letter forms characteristic ofthe Kushan period, and nearly two centuries later than the date of the personages whoare named.1 Yet this circumstance need not cause usto doubt the authenticity oftheir information. It islikely enough that the Buddhist monks whose establishment was founded to keep alive thememory of the king possessed a copy oftheir foundation deed on perishable material. When it began to show signs of wear, they would naturally have transcribed it upon the monument itself. The reference to the role of the horse in connection with the Saka funeral rites is a vivid and appropriate detail. Comparison may be sought with the numerous cases of horse-sacrifice in Scythian burials in south Russia; or again, with the funeral ofRustam in theShdh-ndma.2
It may be surmised that thelast expedition of Maues to Mathura, and the concentration there of the principal Saka chiefs (whose names are listed in the inscription) took place during a campaign to reduce the last Indo-Greek garrisons in the area. Rajula, who is prominently mentioned, subsequently became satrap of Mathura, and issued coins which form thedirect sequel to issues of the Greek kings Strato II and Apollophanes in that area. Meanwhile the death of Maues seems to have robbed the Sakas ofa unified leadership. The prince {yuvarajd) Kharahostes was supposed by Konow to have been theheir to the imperial title.3 Ifhe isrightly identified with the personage of the same name who issued coins, hewas not, indeed, the son ofMaues but of a certain Arta, otherwise unknown, whom Konow conjectures to have been the brother ofthe Saka emperor. Since the coins, inbronze only, carry thetitle merely of "Satrap", it seems that Kharahostes never

effectively succeeded to the empire. The type of his coins is "king mountedwith lance", which suggests that he later held office as a contemporary, no doubt a subordinate, of Azes I.
A notable coin discovery now shows that theimmediate successor of Maues at Taxila was a woman, perhaps his queen, whose name appears in Greek as BA2IAISSHS 0EOTPOnOT MAXHNH2, a spelling which may represent the Iranian name Mahln.1 A newname has thus been added to the list of queens who played a part in history. Naturally thelack of a male heir at this critical time will have placed the Saka confederation in jeopardy. This was the moment when, as the coin analysis shows, the Indo-Greek king Apollodotus II regained control of Taxila, andpresumably expelled the Sakas from the city. Apollodotus II was followed in turn by another Greek king, Hippostratus, the volume of whose coins suggests a reign of some duration. It was at this point that Azes I, ruler, as we have seen, in Arachosia, appears on the Punjab scene as champion of the Saka cause. There followed a ding-dong struggle between the Greeks and Sakas for control of Taxila. Azes I was once more expelled byHippostratus,but finally reasserted himself to establish the definitive supremacy of the Sakas.
A fixed date is provided for the final restoration of Azes I in the Punjab bythe fact that hewas apparently responsible forthe inauguration of the so-called Vikrama era,which commenced in 57 B.C., and which is still in use in India today. In two early inscriptions, the Kalawan copper-plate of the year 134, andthe Taxila silver scroll of the year 136,2 datings in theVikrama era aredesignated by the term ajasa (or ayasa),which isbest interpreted "ofAzes". It may beassumed that theeracommenced with the date of Azes' accession, andthat it more probably relates to his restoration than to his earlier, interrupted, reign. There is consequently justification for reckoning Azes' restoration as having occurred in 57 B.C. This hypothesis, that the Indian Vikrama eraof 57 B.C. originates with theaccession to the paramount power of Azes I, is nowexplicitly confirmed by a newly-discovered Kharosthl inscription.3
The successors of Azes I were Azilises andAzes II. There are no

known events or fixed dates for these reigns, butit is clear that the reign of Azes II extended into the beginning of the ist centuryA.D. Meanwhiie, a Parthian feudal family, soon tobeknown as the dynasty of the Indo-Parthians, was pursuing the migrating Sakas upthe valley of the Helmand, and down into the Punjab. Stage bystage the IndoScythian empire of the Sakas was conquered bythe advancing IndoParthians, upon the coins of whom appear such names as Gondophares, Orthagnes, Abdagases, Pacores andSasan, besides a certain Arsaces Theos whose connections are uncertain. Various problems arise concerning the exact sequence of the Indo-Parthian rulers, but the date ofGondophares is firmly established by the Takht-i Bahl inscription of the year 103,1 which is also dated to the twenty-sixth year of Gondophares' reign. The first date must be reckoned according to the "era of Azes" (57 B.C.)and therefore corresponds to A.D. 46, whilst the accession year of Gondophares was consequently A.D. 20. These are dates which appear the more convincing because they agree with the only other information preserved about the emperor Gondophares, which is hisconnection with the tale of the voyage of the Christian apostle Thomas to India. The tradition records that Thomas set out for India immediately after the Crucifixion, i.e. in April A.D. 30.2 The appearance of Gondophares in the Acts of the Apostle Thomas is therefore chronologically acceptable, and serves to confirm the dating proposed for the inscription.
Meanwhile the Tochari and their associates the Asiani were pressing south from Tukharistan through the passes of the Hindu Kush into the Kabul valley, and bythe beginning of the ist century A.D. were breaking out onto the Punjab plain. This wasthe time when the Asiani, i.e. the Kushans, established themselves as the "rulers of the Tochari". These events aresummed up in a well-known passage of the Chinese Hou-Han shu, which has been quoted by Konow:
Formerly the Yiie-chi were conquered bythe Hiung-nu; they transferred themselves to the Ta-hia [i.e. Bactria] and divided that kingdom between five hi-hou[minor chiefs], viz., those of Hiu-mi, Shuang-mi, Kuei-shang, Hi-tun and Tu-mi. More than a hundred years after this the hi-hou ofthe Kuei-shang, called K'iu-tsiu-k'io, attacked theother four hi-hou;he styled himself king;the name of his kingdom was Kuei-shang.

territory of Kao-fu; moreover he triumphed over Pu-ta andKi-pinand entirely possessed those kingdoms. K'iu-tsiu-k'io died more than eighty
years old.HissonYen-kao-chen became king inhis stead.1
This passage is interpreted as describing the establishment of the Kushan empire under Kujula Kadphises, and theeventual succession to thethrone ofhis sonVima Kadphises. TheTakht-i Bahi inscription is often thought to contain a mention of the Kushan prince Kujula Kadphises, whose rule over theYueh-chih horde will thus have begun early in the Christian era,and necessarily before A.D.46.
THE KUSHAN EMPIRE
The Kushan empire founded by Kujula Kadphises was soon to expand onboth sides ofthe Hindu Kush, andtobecome formore than a century the most influential civilizing force in Asia. To the south the Kushans thrust forward to dominate the north Indian plain, establishing their centres at Peshawar andat Mathura (Muttra),and even penetrating for a time into thebasin ofthe Ganges. Tothe north, still conscious of their nomad origins, theKushans sought to restore contact with theChinese borderlands in which their wanderingshad begun. No doubt their great resources inanimal transport asa nomadic people gave them themeans to settheChinese trade flowing, and to form a bridge between the civilizations of India and China. At the same time thefact that inBactria they were thesuccessors ofa Hellenistic civilization gave them special points of contact with the Mediterranean world. The staple item in thewestbound trade was of course silk, which could nowavoid Parthian territory and bediverted southwards to theIndus delta, to finish itsjourney to the Roman empireby sea. In return, besides gold coin, Rome sent manufactured goods of many kinds - woollen tapestries, engraved gems andcameos, figurines and metalware; but perhaps most important of all, the magnificent glassware of Alexandria, since China in the 1stcentury A.D. had not developed the manufacture of glass. At the same time the Indian territories of the Kushans exported both towards China andto Italy their exquisite ivories. For all this trade the French excavations at Begram in Afghanistan have proved the most revealing source of information, butminor finds areknown from many sites.

the variety of the tribes which accompanied them naturally raise many difficult problems ofrace and language. So faras the ruling group were concerned, their drooping moustaches and bulbous features, as frequently depicted in thesculpture of Gandhara, or on thecoins, have caused many commentators to doubt, perhaps with insufficient reason, that they could have been Indo-Europeans. Kennedy argued eloquently that they represented a Turkish, or at anyrate non-Iranian physical type.1 The medieval Arab writer al-Birunt regarded them asTibetans ;2 whilst their contemporary, the Syrian Bardesanes inhis Book of the Laws of the Countries? reports the existence of matriarchal tendencies in their society. At the same time their dress and equipment - the buckled cloak, long shirt, and the baggy trousers of the horseman, depicted in many works of Gandhara sculpture, and especially on thestatue of the emperor Kanishka from Mathura (pi. 79) - were nodifferent from that of the other Iranians ofthe steppe. Like the Sakas they wore scale-armour, and their weapons included a straight sword over three feet long. It is notknown whether the Kushans possessed a special language, distinct from that of their associated tribes. However, it is now clear that the official language of the Kushan empire, an Iranian dialect written in Greek script, is in fact Bactrian - that is, thelocal eastern Iranian dialect of the province in which the Kushans had settled after crossing the Oxus. This language isnow known from the inscriptions ofa large part of the Kushan coinage, andespecially from the twenty-five-line lapidary "Inscription of Nokonzoko" discovered by the Delegation Archeologique Franchise en Afghanistan at Surkh Kotal, and interpreted by thelate Professor W. B. Henning.4 It seems likely that this adaptation of the Greek script forthe writing of the Bactrian language had already been carried out by the Greeks inBactria before the coming of the Kushans, since thedevices employed for the rendering of the specifically Iranian sounds are entirely of the type that would occur to the Greek mind; e.g., the rendering ofthe aspirate byupsilon (since in Greek initial upsilon invariably carries the rough breathing), and of the /sibilant by san. It isalso curious that the "Inscription of Nokonzoko" contains one word incommon with the Khotanese texts ofCentral Asia. This is the Bactrian xsono, Khotanese ksuna - " regnal y e a r " - b u t it remains to be determined in what dialect this word originated.

HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
The next group in the tribal hierarchy after the Kushans were the Tocharians, but of their language notrace survives in Bactria. Some scholars are inclined to attribute to the Tocharians the twoIndoEuropean centum dialects found in manuscript fragments from Kucha and Qarashahr. However, though there is a possibility that one or both of these dialects may have been connected with that of the migrating Tocharians, it seems clearer until positive proof comes to hand to designate them Agnaean and Kuchaean, rather than to forejudge the question by terming them "Tocharian Aand B". A rather similar problem arises in connection with the dialect of the Sakas in India. Words and names attributable tothem are found on the Indian coins and inscriptions, and have been variously connected. Thusthe name ofthe Saka satrap Castana has been compared with the modern Pashto word tsaxtan "master", suggesting a connection between Pashto and the Indo-Scythian dialect. Ontheother hand such IndoScythian words as horamurta "supervisor ofdonations " and bakanapati
"priest" have been compared with Khotanese.1 Yet since Pashto and Khotanese are not closely related, the linguistic situation in the Kushan empire must have been more complex than at first appears.
Over the chronology of the Kushan empire much controversy prevails, but adefinitive solution may now be within reach. The relative chronology ofthe rulers can be deduced from their coins, and is fairly well agreed. Starting in the first decades of the Christian era, there ruled Kujula Kadphises, then a "nameless king", designated on coins merely by histitle, Soter Megas "The Great Saviour", andVima Kadphises. The next series of coins provides the names of three further rulers, Kanishka (Kaniska) I, Huvishka (Huviska) and Vasudeva. However, the absolute chronology ofthese reigns, and our knowledge of several minor members of the dynasty who didnotstrike coins, has to be deduced byassembling the evidence of a large number of dated inscriptions, some in Kharosthi andothers in Brahmi script, from various sites in the subcontinent. To these must now beadded the two dated Bactrian inscriptions from Surkh Kotal in Afghanistan. Complications arise inthe study ofthe inscriptions from the fact that several different eras areused for dating. To devise a chronological scheme, the eras have first tobe identified. Infact, the best hypothesis

THE KUSHAN EMPIRE
assumes the existence offour quite different eras, all probably originat
ing from the accession years of dynastic founders, on the following
lines: (a) An Indo-Bactrian era ofc. 155 B.C. (often called the Old Saka era). (b) The era ofAzes commencing in 57 B.C. (c) TheSaka era,used originally bythewestern satraps of Ujjain, commencing in A.D.78. (d) The eraof Kanishka, c.A.D. 128. The epigraphical evidence onwhich this scheme is based is given in Appendix iv. It is necessary to take note at this point of the newly discovered Kushan trilingual inscriptions near theplain of Dasht-i Navur to the south-west of Kabul. Once described byPaul Bernard asthe " Rosetta Stone" ofKushan archaeology, they prove to have been sadly defaced, and to raise now quite as many problems as they solve. Besides the versions in Greek-letter Bactrian, and in Kharosthi, the third text is in an unknown script showing affinities with Kharosthi, but ofwhich the language is quite unknown; amongst other possibilities, it could of course be that of the Kushan dynasty themselves (see above, p. 199). Though the content of the inscriptions is problematical, the date at least seems to be perfectly clear, being the month Gorpiaios of the year 279.x The present writer had argued elsewhere2 the case for attributing this date to Tarn's " O l d Saka*' era (better perhaps IndoBactrian era) of 155 B.C, which provides the solution 279 —155= A.D. 124. The ruler named at Dasht-i Navor is apparently Vima Kadphises, and this once more isinagreement with the present writer's prediction that theaccession of Kanishka (I) should be placed either in A.D. 128 or A.D. 125. Unfortunately the editor of the inscription felt unable to accept sosimple a conclusion, being determined to uphold the chronology which places the accession of Kanishka in A.D. 78. If Tarn's "Old Saka" eraof 155 B.C. is accepted forthe calculation of the new date, the inscription of Dasht-i Navor itself proves (as was evident from material previously known) that so early a date for Kanishka would be impossible. Professor Fussman sought an escape from this dilemma by attempting to refer the new inscription, together with all the inscriptions previously known which are ascribed to the " O l d Saka" era,instead to the Arsacid era of 247 B.C. It is by no means

the first time this solution hasbeen proposed for theinscriptions of Gandhara, andearlier refutations of the resulting chronology are of course still valid. First, onthis calculation the solution ofthe Dasht-i Navor date would be 279 — 247 = A.D. 32. This solution places Vima Kadphises earlier indeed than thelatest firm date for Gondophares, that of the Takht-i Bahl inscription, 103 — 57 = A.D. 46. The date of Gondophares isthe sheet-anchor forany reliable theory ofearly Indian chronology. Any serious student of the numismatic sequence would find it hard to believe that the fine gold coinage of Vima coexisted with the billon of Gondophares, or that the two rulers were contemporaries and neighbours.
There is, however, an even stronger objection to the "Arsacid"
theory. Professor Fussman scouts as baseless Tarn's argumentation1 that animportant era began in 155 B.C. or thereabouts. Yet that argument was necessary toaccount for the date 78 inthe celebrated copper
plate of Patika.2 This document mentions the Saka emperor Moga, who is certainly identical with the ruler Maues known from coins, and with a deceased ruler named as Muki, again found in association
with Patika onthe Mathura lion-capital.3 It is evident from the numis
matic sequence4 that Maues must have lived one ortwo decades earlier than Azes I, thefounder of the "Vikrama" eraof 57 B.C. The coins also show that Maues must have come to power later than the IndoGreek kings such as Archebius, who were ruling c. 110-100 B.C. These requirements are satisfactorily met by Tarn's solution. The Patika copper-plate is then dated 155— 78 + 1 = 78 B.C.; and the Maira inscription of year 58, which possibly also mentions Maues, would fall in
155 — 58+ 1 = 98B.C.6 These are perfectly plausible dates in the reign of Maues, and provide their ownjustification for Tarn's point of departure.
On the other hand, if one seeks to apply the Arsacid era to the Patika copper-plate, the resulting figures bear no relation to probability. Thus 247 — 78 + 1 = 170B . C , which would make of Maues a contemporary of Eucratides, and run counter to all the logic of the numismatic sequence. Professor Fussman does not explain inhis article, how, onhis hypothesis, hewould account forthe copper-plate of Patika. The only escape from the dilemma would beto assumethe existence of some further era, specifically to accommodate the copper

plate. After this the question arises ofhow the remaining inscriptions are to be distributed between this hypothetical era, and that of the Arsacids. It is evident, therefore, that the "Arsacid theory" leads to various anomalies, and finally to a labyrinth of special pleading. The present writer must be forgiven ifhe prefers toregard the evidence of Dasht-i Navor as providing long-awaited confirmation of his earlier reasoning, and ofthe traditional chronological framework maintained by Sir John Marshall and others before him, who placed the accession date ofKanishka inthe range A.D. 125-8. The list of inscriptions makes clear the evidence for the dating of the principal Kushan kings, andshows that in addition to the rulers known from coins, there were two more ephemeral Kushan kings, Vasishka and a possible Kanishka II,whose reigns are known only from the inscriptions. The demise ofthe last major Kushan emperor, Vasudeva, appears to have taken place around A.D. 225. This is an impressive coincidence of dates, when it is borne in mind thatthe overthrow of the Kushan empire hasoften been attributed to the Sasanian dynasty of Iran, whose founder, Ardashir I,defeated and slew the last Parthian king, Ardavan V, and was acknowledged as emperor of
Iran in A.D. 224. According to the Arab historian Tabari,1 Ardashir shortly afterwards undertook a campaign against the empire of the Kushans, and won a notable victory, asa result ofwhich the Kushan king sent messengers to offer submission. During the subsequent reign, that of the Sasanian Shapur I (A.D. 240-72), the son of Ardashir I, it is evident from the inscription on the monument called the Ka'ba-yi Zardusht at Naqsh-i Rustam, near Persepolis, that the Sasanians directly ruled allthe territories of the Kushan empire as fareast as,
if not including, the city ofPeshawar.2 This was the former capital of Kanishka I, and it is therefore clear that the advent ofthe Sasanians put an end to the days of Kushan grandeur. However, itis not improbable that one ortwo lesser Kushan kings, whose existence is vaguely hinted at by theevidence, may have continued to rule over those fragments of the Kushan empire which lay to the east of the river Indus. In particular, it appears that there arecoins which can be attributed to a third Kanishka, who was apparently a successor of Vasudeva. Thus it is not improbable that some of the inscriptions which give the name ofKanishka, and bear dates between 1 and 22, mayin

fact be due to this third Kanishka, anddated by his regnal years. However, only a close study ofthe palaeography and sculptural style of monuments bearing the name ofKanishka islikely toreveal which, if any, ofthese is attributable tothis later Kanishka III. Kanishka I is in any event by far the best known and most celebrated member ofthe Kushan dynasty. Despite the absence ofany narrative history of his reign, which is known principally from coins and inscriptions, certain facts emerge from thelegends which surround his name. It is unlikely that asBuddhist sources allege Kanishka was himself a convert to Buddhism, forhis foundation of a dynastic fire temple at Surkh Kotal in Afghanistan suggests that the state religion
of the Kushans was a form ofMazdaism.1 Yet the appearance of the figure of Buddha on one of Kanishka's coins confirms that this emperor was atany rate sympathetic tothe Buddhists, as the Buddhist tradition maintains. There is evidently truth in the story that the emperor founded the famous Kanishka monastery and stiipa at Peshawar, for the remains of the stiipa have been excavated and the relic casket found
in its bears aKharosthi inscription recording itas the gift of Kanishka.2 Also linked with the memory of Kanishka was theThird Buddhist Council, convened in Kashmir, or according to another version at Jalandhara, toprepare commentaries onthe canonical Buddhist texts. The literary and intellectual activity of Kanishka's reign is prominent in theBuddhist traditions of China andTibet, andmust notpass unnoticed. Most of its outstanding personalities areassociated with
the Third Buddhist Council,3 or with its leading participants. Outstanding was its convener Parsva, and its president Vasumitra, who together supervised the compilation ofthe important commentaryon the canonical texts, the Mahdvibhdsa. The preparation ofsuch commentaries, rather than mere selection of the canon, is quoted as a major aim of the Council. At thesame time, a passage of its text weighs against this synchronism ofthe Mahdvibhdsa with Kanishka, by refer
ring tothe past a miracle ofthat reign.4
More celebrated for hiscreative achievement than those religious •organizers (with whom he isclosely linked) was the poet and dramatist

THE KUSHAN EMPIRE
Asvaghosa,1 best known as the author ofthe life ofthe Buddha called the Buddhacarita. Also regarded as authentic is his classical drama Sariputraprakarana^ known from Central Asian fragments,2 and the poetical work Saundaranandakdvya* wherein is described the conversion of the Buddha's half-brother Nanda, and of which the colophon contains apparently reliable biographical details of the author. Other works attributed to Asvaghosa are, however, of disputed authorship. The Sutrdlamkdra, which contains references to the Kushan emperor, and was believed byLevi to bethe work ofthe Buddhist patriarch,4 is nowadays considered by some to be more properly entitled the Kalpandmanditikd, and to have infact been compiled by the somewhat later author Kumaralata.5 A number ofother Buddhist writings, such as the Gurupancdsika ("Fifty verses on the rules for serving one's teacher"),6 the Gandistotra (onthe music produced from a type of xylophone),7 the VajrasucJ (" the Diamond Needle", a criticism of the caste system), the Mahdyana-sraddhotpadasdstra (onthe Awakening of Faith inthe Mahayana doctrine),8 and others known chiefly from their Chinese versions, are usually attributed to later namesakes, and thought to allude todoctrinal differences ofthe late medieval period, although traditionally ascribed tothe Kanishkan patriarch. Different authorities acknowledge the existence of three, or even six, authors named Asvaghosa in various periods, and at least two rulers known from coins and inscriptions seem tohave borne this name. For the historical personage with whom weare concerned, themost reliable tradition is that hewas born at Saketa, son of Suvarnaksi.
Even though it can be contended that the Buddhist teacher was not identical with the poet and dramatist,9 it seems over-sceptical to doubt

his conversion toBuddhism by Parsva, orby the disciple of the latter,
Punyayasas (Purnasa).1 An important Khotanese text represents Asvaghosa as thespiritual adviser of Kanishka in Buddhist matters,
and as having played apart in the popularization of the Buddha image.2
Since it may now betaken as demonstrated3 that the appearance of the Gandhara school of Buddhist sculpture (and approximately simultaneous developments at Mathura) in themain belong to the opening years ofKanishka's reign, the relation ofAsvaghosa and his circle to this movement needs to beanalysed. It could be conceived that thestereotyped iconography found at northern Buddhist sites many miles apart could have been inspired by illustrated copies of such
texts as the Buddhacarita. The recent discussion by Dagens,4 concerned only with limited material from Hadda, in fact concedes that certain sculptures correspond tothe narrative ofthe Buddhacarita, though the lualita-vistara appears tohave been the more influential source.
Although the Tibetan History of Buddhism byTaranatha appears to identify with Asvaghosa the scholar Matrceta, the evidence now seems stronger that thelatter author belonged to a later generation.The fact that heis known forhis epistle to a ruler named Kanishka,the
Mahdrdjakanikalekhd,h wherein he excuses his inability to travel to court onaccount ofhis advanced age, had been thought to link him with thegeneration of Asvaghosa. Against this, however, must be reckoned thewell-supported tradition that Matrceta was converted to Buddhism from the cult ofSiva at Nalanda by Aryadeva, the disciple
of Nagarjuna (the personality next to be discussed).6 Nagarjuna was himself a younger contemporary of Kanishka's generation, so that this chain ofevidence suggests a significant lapse oftime. At the same time, there is separate epigraphic andnumismatic evidence for the existence oftwo rulers bearing the name ofKanishka, and some commentators have even concluded that there were altogether three Kushan rulers of that name. The Kanishka mentioned in the Ara inscription dated in the year 41 is traditionally referred to the era of

the first Kanishka, though account must now be taken of MacDowalPs interesting suggestion that this date should be referred to an era of A.D. 78 coinciding with the Saka era of western India.1 Ifhis hypothesis is well founded, the Ara inscription will no longer be evidence for the existence ofa second Kanishka. Thus the Kanishka known from later Kushan ("Murunda") coins will beKanishka II, reigning c. A.D. 225. On the traditional interpretations, the last-named ruler would be Kanishka III. In either event, it would be reasonable to place the floruit of Nagarjuna c. A.D. 155 and ofAryadeva c. A.D. 185, and thus connect the epistle ofMatrceta with this last Kanishka in the advanced years ofthe sage c. A.D. 225.
The list of the thirteen known literary works of Matrceta isgiven by Shackleton Bailey.2 Apart from his famous epistle, he was best known for his Buddhist hymns, inparticular the Satapancdsatka (" The Hymn of 150 Verses "), and the Varndrhavarnastotra^hoth of which have been edited. The consensus of recent opinion is thus fairly clear that Matrceta was a personage quite distinct from Asvaghosa, and significantly later in date,4 and moreover that his celebrated epistle is no evidence for placing him in the circle ofKanishka I c. A.D. 128-51. Traditionally reckoned, however, the court physician of that emperor was Caraka, known especially for his redaction of the herbal pharmacopoeia of Agnivesa current under the title ofCaraka Samhitd, published in India in several editions. Also most important for his historical synchronism in this literary circle was Sangharaksa, likewise reckoned one of the first Kanishka's spiritual guides inBuddhism, who was also the author of a Buddhacaritaapparently distinct from that of Asvaghosa, and especially of the Yogdcdrabhumuh The chronological importance of the latter work is that it is known to have been translated into Chinese before A.D. 148,6 so that while it supports earlier dates for the accession of Kanishka I, such as A.D. 128 orA.D. 78, it necessarily excludes some of the later dates which have been propounded.

HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
Already noticed as a younger contemporary of the personages discussed above was Nagarjuna, traditionally the founder of the Madhyamika school of Mahayana Buddhism.1 It is likely to be the case that the distinction between the two main branches of Buddhist belief may have been less sharp in the 2nd century A.D. than it later became, and that the life ofNagarjuna may in later sources have been subject to some reinterpretation in the light of later controversies. In any event his chief work seems to have been the transmission of developed Buddhist doctrines to the Satavahana kingdom of the Deccan. It is plausibly argued that he could have been the contemporary ofthe ruler Vasistiputra Sri Pulumavi (c. A.D. 130-58); and that hetook part in works of restoration of the monuments at Amaravati (the ancient Dhanyakataka) which bear the inscriptions of that prince.2 Certainly the Buddha image which appears inthe late phase ofthe sculptures of Amaravati is often strongly reminiscent ofGandhara work, and could owe something tocontacts with the Kushan centres. Yet in discussing such panels inthe British Museum, Barrett was hesitant in attributing their inspiration toNagarjuna.3 The sage isremembered for his epistle to an unnamed Satavahana ruler (presumably Pulumavi) the Suhrllekha, preserved in Chinese versions and in Tibetan.4 Its title, "Epistle to a Friend", may be evidence ofhis personal relationship with the ruler. In addition heleft philosophical works: the Mahdprajndpdramitdsdstra ("The Treatise of the Great Virtue of Wisdom"), recently translated
from the Chinese;5 the Mahaydnavimsikdf and the VigrahavydvartanL1 There seems noreason to abandon the tradition which represents him as ending his days at the great archaeological site of Nagarjunakonda which inherited his name.8
Another episode of the reign of Kanishka was the emperor's campaign

LATE ANTIQUITY
in eastern Turkestan, mentioned bythe Chinese traveller Hsiian-Tsang in his account of the "monastery of the hostages " founded by Kanishka at Kapisa. Surely to beconnected with this Kushan penetration into the Tarim basin are the famous frescoes in pure Gandhara style discovered by Sir Aurel Stein at Miran. The close resemblance between thefrieze of putti in thefrescoes andthat appearing on theKanishka casket from Peshawar supports thededuction that both works belong to thelifetime ofKanishka. The Miran site will therefore beevidence of Kushan activity in theTarim basin. It may be concluded that the far-reaching political sovereignty of Kanishka helped to secure a right-of-way for Buddhist travellers along theroute to China. Notonly didthey introduce their characteristic Gandhara art at Miran, they also brought with them their Kharosthi script, which occurs in the Tarim basin in thedocuments from Niya, near Khotan, and in others from Endere and Lou-Lan. It was also used forwriting works ofBuddhist scripture, of which an example survives in the Gdndhdrl Dharmapada^ edited by Professor J. Brough.
LATE ANTIQUITY IN EASTERN IRAN
After the fall of the Kushan dynasty in A.D. 225, the provinces of Gandhara, Bactria and Sogdiana passed under the rule of Sasanian governors who bore the title of Kushanshah "King ofthe Kushans". This Persian administration continued until about A.D. 360. The Kushanshahs areknown chiefly from their coinage, which resembles that of the Sasanian empire of Iran in distinguishing the individual rulers each byhis characteristic crown. Unlike the Sasanian coinage in Iran, however, thecoinage of the Kushanshahs comprised little silver (only two isolated silver issues, of Peroz I Kushanshah, and Hormizd I Kushanshah, areknown) and was practically limited to issues in gold and bronze. The sequence ofthe Kushanshahs whose coins are known is given in the following list [cf.pp. 334, 339]: Ardashir I Kushanshah Ardashir II Kushanshah Peroz I Kushanshah Hormizd I Kushanshah (c. A.D. 277-86; rebel against Bahram II of Iran) Peroz II Kushanshah

HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
Hormizd II Kushanshah (? subsequently Hormizd II of Iran,
A.D. 302-9)
Varahran I Kushanshah Varahran II Kushanshah (reigning A.D. 360). References tothe Kushanshahs inthe historical sources are rare, but the ScriptoresHistoriae Augustae (Carus 8) mention that during the advance of the Roman emperor Carus against thePersian capital of Ctesiphon in A.D. 283, the Persians were "occupied with domestic sedition", and therefore offered no opposition to the advancing Romans. Moreover, a Roman panegyric of the reign of Maximian (A.D. 285-305) describes how the Persian king, presumably Bahram II (A.D. 276-93) was attacked by hisbrother "Ormies", a name which could well designate the Kushanshah Hormizd I. The issue by Hormizd I Kushanshah at Marv of Sasanian-type gold coins with the title Kushanshahanshah "Kushan king ofkings" was thus inall probability an act of open rebellion. It is none the less clear that Bahram II of Iran was successful in defeating the rebellion ofthe Kushanshah. This is evidenced not only by his continued reign until A.D. 293, a full ten years after the earliest mention ofthe insurrection; but also by apassing notice of the historian
Agathias1 whostates that Bahram reduced the people of Segistan (Sistan) to subjection, andtherefore conferred on his infant son the title of Sakanshah. Though the rebellion of the Kushanshah is not specifically mentioned in this connection, it is natural to suppose that the reduction ofthe people of Segistan was accompanied bythe overthrow of their neighbour theKushanshah, with whom, according to the panegyric already quoted, they were in fact acting in concert. The last possible reference ina western historian tothe affairs of the Kushan governorate occurs in thedescription byAmmianus Marcellinus (xix. i. 1-2) of the siege bytheSasanian emperor Shapur II of the Roman city of Amida. According to Ammianus, the Persian king hpd his army onhorseback, "wearing inthe place ofa diadem a golden replica of a ram's head setwith gems". It has already been observed that each ofthe Sasanian kings was distinguished, oncoins and in art, by a characteristic crown, which he no doubt also wore in real life. The headdress of Shapur II was a mural crown, and not oneof the type described by Ammianus. It istrue, however, that the characteristic headdress ofVarahran II Kushanshah, quite probably a contemporary of Shapur II, was inthe form ofa ram's head. It seems likely, therefore,

LATE ANTIQUITY
that the Persian prince seen byAmmianus was not in fact Shapur,but the Kushanshah Varahran II,who is thus shown to have been active in A.D. 360. It is now time to turn to a new factor which began about A.D.350 to impinge upon the history of the eastern Iranian lands. Thiswas the coming of the Huns or Hsiung-nu (whose earlier history has
already been noticed)1 to the west from the borders of China. In A.D. 311 the southern section ofthe Hsiung-nu had captured and burnt the capital ofthe Chinese Tsin dynasty at Lo-yang, the terminus ofthe Silk Route famous tothe Romans asSera Metropolis. The disturbances which took place further to thewest along the Silk Route as a consequence ofthis event are reflected in the Sogdian "Ancient Letters", found by Sir Aurel Stein inthe Chinese Wall tothe west ofTun-huang,
and now in the British Museum.2 In China the Hsiung-nu set upa dynasty which survived until A.D. 350. Meanwhile the northern section of the same people hadbeen driven westwards from thevicinity of Lake Baikal by their rivals the Sien-pi. The Hsiung-nu apparently passed to thenorth of the Tien-shan range, where their movements were unknown to thehistorians of either half of the civilized world. It was only in A.D. 350 that their impact fell onthe course of western history. In that year Shapur II of Iran was besieging the Roman fortress of Nisibis in Mesopotamia when news reached him that the eastern frontiers of Iran were being attacked by nomadic invaders. He immediately abandoned the siege, and set out for the threatened spot. The historian Zonaras (11. 15)calls theinvaders "Massagetae", andAmmianus Marcellinus (xiv. iii. 1)does not name them atthis point inhis narrative; but subsequently (xvi. ix. 4) it emerges that they were, in fact, the Chionites, a name formed from the Middle Persian word xiyon "Hun", perhaps with the addition of a Greek tribal suffix. It is clear, therefore, that the invaders were a section ofthe Huns, who had lately arrived in Transoxiana in thecourse of their journey from the east. The struggle with these opponents kept the Sasanian king occupied until A.D. 358, when he was able tocontract atreaty of peace with them, under which they were to join himas allies in a further campaign against Rome.
So it was that at the siege ofAmida in A.D. 360 the Chionites under their king Grumbates were ranged amongst the allies of the Persians. A vivid detail which occurs in thenarrative of Ammianus is that of

HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
the cremation of Grumbates' son, who was killed in the fighting with the Romans. Since the Zoroastrian Persians of Shapur's army would have regarded cremation as anathema, it seems clear that this ritual was characteristic ofthe Chionites. Confirmation of Ammianus* statement comes in archaeological reports of cremation deposits found
amongst the European Huns,1 who will naturally have had affinities with theChionites. At the same time there is evidence that some of the later Hunnish tribes in eastern Iran practised instead therite of inhumation (see below). Whereas the earlier Sasanian Kushanshahs had minted at Balkh (written Bax/o on thecoins), as well as at an unnamed mint that was probably inthe Kabul valley, it appears that Varahran II Kushanshah, the contemporary of the Chionites, issued few coins at Balkh.The conclusion is that the Chionites, pressing down from thenorth,had already overrun Bactria. Shortly after A.D. 360, when the reign of Varahran II Kushanshah came to anend, thenext ruler to issue coins of Kushano-Sasanian fabric was theenigmatic figure of Kidara. This personage was no doubt aHun, tojudge by the phrase "Kidarite Huns " used bythehistorian Priscus in a later context. Probably Kidara was a successor of Grumbates as ruler over the Chionites, who becauseof his leadership would have come to beknown byhis name. According to the Chinese sources followed by McGovern, a new wave ofHunnish invaders known asthe Hephthalites fell upon Bactria towards the end of the 4th century, and drove the Kidarites into Gandhara. However, according to the thesis of Ghirshman, Chionites, Kidarites and Hephthalites were merely different names used at various periods for the same tribal group. The Chionites may indeed have been substantially identical with the later Kidarites, but there issupport for the view that the Hephthalites were distinct in the passage ofProcopius (Wars, 1. 3) which describes the customs ofthe Hephthalites. Procopius claims that though Huns byname and race, theHephthalites didnotlive as nomads; that they were of fair complexion andregular features;and that they practised inhumation oftheir dead, upto twenty ofhis boon companions being buried with each of their chiefs. In respect of their funeral rites, therefore, thecustoms of the Hephthalites contrast with those ofthe Chionites, and suggest that these two groups were wholly distinct.

LATE ANTIQUITY
As to the language of the eastern Huns, just as in the case ofthe European Huns, no specimen survives, and scholars have disagreed in their theories as to the linguistic and racial background of this
people. Ghirshman andEnoki,1 onthebasis of certain coin legends in cursive Greek script, maintained the hypothesis that the language of the Hephthalites wasan Iranian dialect. However, this view seems to have been overtaken by the discovery of the inscriptions of Surkh Kotal (see above, p. 199), which show that the Iranian language in question was in fact the local dialect of Bactria, and notthe languageof the Huns themselves. The view of Minorsky, that thelanguage of the
Hephthalites was a Turkish dialect, therefore holds the field at present.2 The case in its favour is much strengthened by the suggestion of
Bosworth,3 that the personage called in Islamic texts "Subkarl" (a prominent Khaljl Mamluk of the Saffarid Ya'qub), in fact bore the Turkish name of Sebiik-eri "beloved man", formed similarly to that of the later Ghaznavid prince Sebiiktigin "beloved prince". The name "Subkari" also appears on coins of Fars, where he gained control during fighting following the decline of the Saffarids, on dir
hams of the Hijri years 296-8.4 Theonly specimen so far reproduced
is, however, one of the 'Uman mint in a Baghdad collection,5 where the editor is, possibly mistaken in reading thepoorly preserved date as A.H. 308(rather than 298), since it is known from the Tdrikh-i Sistdn passage that this dangerous freelance was imprisoned by the caliph al-Muqtadir in Jumada II 299/23 March-21 April 912, andis unlikely to have been restored to liberty. Whether any linguistic difference existed between the Chionites, Kidarites and Hephthalites is quite uncertain, but Bailey has shown that their Persian and Indian neighbours distinguished between
different groups as theRed Huns andWhite Huns respectively.6

HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
During the 5 th century A.D. theHephthalites became an important power inthe territories ofeastern Iran. It was tothem that the Sasanian prince Peroz applied for assistance torecover the throne of Iran from his brother Hormizd III in A.D. 457. With the help of his Hephthalite auxiliaries he was successful, but later he went towar with his erstwhile allies, and was captured and defeated by their king, called Akhshunwar by Tabari, orKhushnavaz by Firdausl. On this occasion Peroz obtained his release by leaving his son Kavad as a hostage; but later, after ransoming Kavad he returned to theattack, andcharged his cavalry into a hidden ditch, to perish with allhismen. During the 5th and early 6thcenturies A.D. Indian sources record a series of incursions into the Punjab andwestern India by a people known as the Hunas. These were evidently a branch of the eastern Huns, though the nature of their connection with the Hephthalites of Bactria is not entirely clear. Their coin legends often give the rulersof these Indian Huns thetitle "king of Zabul", Zabul being apparently the name of a tribal grouping which was preserved in thetoponymy of the Muslim period by thename of the district of Zabulistan, near Ghazna. In A.D. 458 the Gupta emperor ofIndia, Skandagupta, had to resist aninvasion of India bytheHuns. However, after hisdeaththe Gupta empire disintegrated, and inA.D. 510 the Huna chief Toramana established his rule over much ofwestern India. His son and successor was the notorious Mihirakula, who ruled most ofthe Punjab in about A.D. 525, and when later repulsed from the Indian plains, continued to maintain himself in Kashmir. Mihirakula was succeeded by other Huna kings, among whom were Khingila Narendraditya and Lakhana Udayaditya, besides a certain Purvaditya whose personal name is unknown. These reigns fell inthe second half of the 6thcentury A.D.,
but though a recently discovered inscription now at Kabul1 confirms that Khingila reigned for at least eight years, their exact dates are not recorded. The capitals of these later Zabulite kings arelikely to have been in the territory of modern Afghanistan, perhaps either at Kabul, Ghazna or Gardiz.
Meanwhile the Sasanian emperor Khusrau I Anushirvan (A.D. 5 31-79) had resolved to end themenace to Iran of the Hephthalites and their incursions. He built lines of fortification on the Gurgan plain; one was the wall known today as Sadd-i Iskandar "Alexander's barrier",on the steppe north of Bandar-i Shah andGunbad-i Qabus; the second

LATE ANTIQUITY
runs from the mountains to the sea near Bandar-i Gaz, and coversthe eastward approach to Mazandaran. At thesame time a branch of the Turkish nation had arrived onthe Jaxartes steppes from their original home inMongolia. Khusrau made an alliance with the Turkish Khan called in thewestern sources Sinjibu or Silzibul - to crush theHephthalites. Soon after A.D. 557a fierce battle was fought between the confederates and the Hephthalites, the latter being totally defeated and dispersed. Thelands of the Hephthalites were partitioned along the line ofthe Oxus, those to the north passing to the Turks, while those to the south ofthe river were retained bythe Sasanians. The political situation in theeast of what is today Afghanistan at this time is rather more obscure. Coins are known ofa prince, perhaps a Hephthalite, whose name is written in Pahlavi script as npky MLK\ Some specimens appear to bear themint-name Andarab, andothers, without name ofmint, may have been issued atKabul. The occurrence of such coins inahoard which includes many ofthe Sasanian Khusrau I
Aniishirvan suggests that npky MLK9 may have been the contemporary
of this king.1 If so, a few semi-independent chiefs ofHephthalite origin may have continued to rule in theKabul area, perhaps with thetitle of Kabul-shah, during theclosing years of the Sasanian dynasty. In the region of Badghis, tothe north-east ofHerat, groups ofHephthalite survivors retained their ethnic identity until the Arab invasions of the 7th century A.D., when they are described asoffering a stubborn resistance under the leadership of a certain Tarkhan Nezak. It was recently
suggested by Harmatta2 that the correct reading of the Pahlavi coin legend mentioned above should indeed be nycky MLK\ "the regular Middle Persian orthography of the name Nezak", and thus identical with that ofthe opponent celebrated inthe Arab annals. The reading is certainly feasible, andmust be considered seriously; though whether the numerous coins are indeed aslate in date asthe actual opponent of the Arabs, or whether, as theauthor tends to imply, and the scanty numismatic evidence seems to suggest, the name would have been a hereditary title held bya succession ofprinces of whom the historical Tarkhan Nezak was perhaps the last, is a problem still deserving investigation.

Frye, " Napki Malka and the KushanoSasanians", in Kouymjian (ed.), Near Eastern Numismatics, pp. 116-18, wholists the historical appearances of the Nezak princes between A.D. 651 and137/754.
215



HISTORY OF EASTERN IRAN
At any rate, apart from the career of Tarkhan Nezak, the powerful and numerous nation ofthe Hephthalites disappears from history after its overthrow by Khusrau Anushirvan. Those not exterminated in battle must have been largely assimilated to the surrounding east Iranian peoples. If it is thus to some extent true that the Ghilzai tribe
of modern Afghanistan are (as has often been supposed)1 the descendants ofthe Hephthalites, they are at any rate wholly Pashto-speaking at the present day, andmarked by no real ethnic or linguistic, but rather by tribal and dialectal differences, from the neighbouring nomadic tribesmen of Afghanistan. If, on the evidence detailed above (p. 213) it is conceded that a Turkish-speaking group of Hephthalite origin played a prominent role amongst thenomad tribal confederacies of Arachosia duringthe early Islamic period, a neat explanation appears toaccount forthe fact that Turkish-speakers are not to befound inthe area today. It maybe supposed that during the Mongol invasion, thenomad groups under the command ofthe Khwarazmian prince Jalal al-Din were split by the force of the onslaught. One section of the Khalaj, apparently containing the Turkish-speaking fraction, were detached from theKhwarazmian
force,2 and in the ensuing confusion could have been swept upin the mass of Turkish tribes in the invader's train. These would have been the Khalaj who later appeared atMarv after the destruction ofthe city, and assisted the Mongols in exterminating the few survivors of the
earlier massacre.3 Thereafter asit seems from the narrative of Juvaini, they made offtowards the west, and can only have been the founders of the Khalji settlements still existing around Sava and Tafrish in
present-day Iran.4
At the same time, inthe historical narratives ofthe Delhi Sultanate, "Khaljls" are constantly mentioned as soldiers and mercenaries, besides being the founders ofseveral dynasties. Clear evidence oftheir Pashto speech comes relatively late, but with regard to the Sultan Jalal al-Din Firuz, founder of the Khalji dynasty (689/1290 to695/1296), a good case hasbeen made for his non-Turkish andAfghan back
ground.5 The role of Pashto under the subsequent Delhi rulers has

LATE ANTIQUITY
been insufficiently investigated, but the unpublished Chishtiya-i bihishtiya1 has several references to the Jalwani and Dotanl Afghans in the aftermath of Timur's invasion, andtheir "Afghan" speech. It is difficult to doubt that in the Indo-Muslim Sultanates the designation " Khaljl" applied inthe main, or even exclusively, to Pashto-speaking tribesmen of the Ghilzai, associated Lodi, and even entirely separate clans; while in Iran the term applies to anearly stratum ofthe Turkish population. Such appears to be the solution of the notorious and long-debated "Khaljl question"; but only linguistic studies demonstrating the existence of loan-words in either direction between these twocommunities could prove the soundness of this historical interpretation. Doerfer was not concerned to discuss a presumed historical connection of the Iranian Khalaj with Afghanistan, while from the eastern angle the study of Ghilzai Pashto hastended to languish in neglect, and the possible existence inthat dialect ofKhaljl Turkish loan-words remains untested. Nor does there seem to beresearch inprogress into the traditions of residual communities of Afghan origin in Rohilkand which might throw light onthese questions. One can only endorse the summing-up by Doerfer: "The Iranian Khalaj with whom we are
concerned prove, according to Minorsky 435,2 to have first been mentioned inaTimurid source inA.H. 806 ( = A.D. 1403); they would appear, however, already tohave established themselves intheir present area of settlement at an earlier date, namely in Mongolian, perhaps even in Saljuq times. It would, to besure, beinteresting to look more closely at thehistory of theIranian Khalaj; however, that is not our
problem."3
Addendum-. A lecture by J. E.van Lohuizen (now in press), propounds a persuasive solution tothe residual uncertainties ofKushan chronology. The existence ofa Kanishka II and III had long been probable, but their absolute datings debatable. Using recent evidence of coins with the name Vasishka (BAZHE>KO) inthe style ofthe 3rd century A.D. (R. Gobi, "Vasiska II,einbisher unbekannter Konig der spateren Kusan", AO AW en (1965), no. 16, pp. 293-4; idem, "Vasiska, Vaskusana und Xodesah: weitere neufunde kusanischer Konigsnamen", AOAW cxvi (1979), no. 4,p. 120), van Lohuizen identifies the Kanishka of the Ara inscription asKanishka III, reigning late inthe 3rd century A.D. His dating (year 41 =£z A.D. 269) would be in theeraof the second Kanishka, commencing almost exactly 100 years after the first. All texts mentioning Huv'shka will beof the second Christian, or first Kushan century, and all mentioning Vasishka ofthe third Christian, orsecond Kushan century. Separation ofthe dated inscriptions ofKanishka I and II, with concurrent numerical dates, can depend only on sculptural style, Sanskritized language, orthe use ofdevolved letterforms, andrequires much further work. The chronology of theforegoing chapter remains nevertheless largely valid for the trans-Indus region where Kanishka I was the most prominent Kushan ruler.

CHAPTER 6
THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF
TRANSOXIANA
Transoxiana was the largest country outside the limits of Iran proper that was from early times inhabited byIranian peoples - either as settled agriculturists (the Sogdians and the Chorasmians) or as nomads (the Sakas). Owing to its geographical situation it came only in particular periods into the field of vision of those peoples who have left us historical chronicles andother forms of written sources. In reconstructing the political history of Transoxiana between the 3rd century B.C. and the 7th century A.D. it is necessary to take into account not only the fragmentary character of the information at our disposal, but also the point of view from which Transoxiana is being mentioned or described. From the last quarter of the 4th century B.C. down to the middle of the 2nd century B.C. we see the land beyond the Oxus mainly through theeyes of Greek andLatin writers (Strabo, Arrian, Diodorus, Quintus Curtius Rufus, Pompeius Trogus in Justin's epitome, Ptolemy, Pliny and others), as the far north-eastern edge of the civilized world.
From the latter part of the 2nd century B.C. to the beginning ofthe 3rd century A.D. we are submitted to the ideas and impressions ofthe court historiographers of the Celestial Empire, the writers of the Shih-chi, Han shu and HouHan-shu, whose "Sinocentrism" was not at all confined merely to their geographical view from the east.
Starting in the 3rdcentury A.D., wemust either consider Transoxiana from the standpoint of the Sasanian kings (Shapiir Fs inscription on the Ka'aba-yi Zardusht, and other Sasanian inscriptions) who carried out expeditions beyond the Oxus and obviously did not try to play down their successes, or follow the official historiography of the late Sasanian period, as reflected in Islamic sources, such as Tabari.
The events of the 4th to 6th centuries that were connected with Transoxiana are illuminated by the sources - Greek and Latin, Persian and Arabic, Syriac, Armenian and Chinese - from different angles, but the selective character of the information given in each source, together with the tendentiousness of its point of view, makes it very difficult to
232



TRANSOXIANA
reconstruct the total picture. Only for the 7th and 8th centuries does the detailed information provided by thevarious'sources lend itself to coordination, andfor thefirst quarter of the 8thcentury already a few authentic diplomatic documents are known to us. The archaeological data assembled in recent decades furnish very valuable material for study of the material and spiritual culture of Transoxiana, butfor thereconstruction of its political history theycan be used only to a very limited extent. For this reason, the basic source, around which all the other data must beassembled and systematized, has to bethe numismatic material - both thecoins of Transoxiana itself and also information from finds of foreign (imported) coins beyond the Oxus. The issuing in Transoxiana of a special currency of the country's own began with the striking of the so-called "barbarous imitations". We know oflocal silver imitations ofearly Seleucid coins ofthe patterns of Alexander's time (pi. 19 (1, 2))and imitations of the coins of Antiochus I (pi. 19 (4-11); on the reverse side, a horse's head), and also numerous imitations of Greco-Bactrian coins - tetradrachms of Euthydemus (pi. 20 (1-4)), tetradrachms of Eucratides (pi. 23 (1)), obols of Eucratides (pi. 21 (12)), tetradrachms of Heliocles (copper-pi. 22 (5-8)). In order to be able to use these imitations as an historical source, it is necessary to understand the specific circumstances in which they were struck and circulated.
In the 1st centuries B.C. and A.D. many countries and peoples situated on the periphery of the Hellenistic and Roman civilization passed through the stage of striking "barbarous imitations". Perhaps the closest analogy as regards both the external phenomena and the essential processes underlying them is provided by a comparison between the "barbarous imitations" of Transoxiana andthose of the western European tribes andpeoples. In both cases there occurred a penetration of foreign coins into regions which were still without their own currency and ignorant of the circulation of money - and with these coins there arrived the idea itself ofusing forcommercial dealings metal tokens of a certain shape and appearance. Subsequently the foreign coins were "reproduced" by local craftsmen - usually at a lower artistic and technical level. From one "generation" ofimitations toanother, mistakes and deviations from the prototype accumulated, representations "disintegrated" andlost their original meaning, and the inscriptions either became quite illegible or simply disappeared.
233



TRANSOXIANA
The usual metrological methods of investigation cannot be applied to these "barbarous imitations": their weight fluctuated a great deal, most often with a tendency to reduction (orelse a concealed reduction was effected by using inferior metal in the minting). All these signs testify toanimportant difference ofprinciple between the coins of the economically developed civilizations and the "barbarous imitations " : therate of exchange of the former was based on their value, that is,it depended, in the first place, on thevalue of the gold or silver expended in making thecoin, whereas that of the latter was conventional, anddetermined not only by their scarcity but also by the authority of the ruling power (whether manifested in tradition, or in a treaty) that was operative over a defined territory. This isthe essence ofthe distinction tobemade between "civilized" and "peripheral" coins, from which follow three propositions that enable us to use "barbarous imitations" for reconstructing political history: (1) The striking of "barbarous imitations" always occurs outside the political frontiers of a society with a developed monetary circulation; (2) The "habitats" that we define for the different groups of "barbarous imitations" must, generally speaking, outline the frontiers within which influence was wielded by the authority (the ruling power) which determined the conventional rate ofexchange ofthese imitations - that is, political frontiers; (3) "Barbarous imitations" (as is shown by many examples from the western European and other peripheries of the Hellenistic and Roman world) correspond to a particular stage notonly of economic butalso of social development. A society of this kind is usually without a king, having only chiefs, tribal leaders and councils ofelders in various forms; there is a nobility, but noclear-cut stratification into classes has yet occurred; as a rule, town life hasnotdeveloped in such a society, and there is nowritten language. The period of "barbarous imitations" was succeeded by a period of independent local strikings in Transoxiana, as though the country had outgrown the stage ofimitation. In some cases the former patterns remained unaltered, butadded to them was a tamgha (ownership mark) or a local legend (e.g. the early Sogdian coins onthe pattern of Euthydemus' tetradrachms - pi. 20 (5-12)), while in others the newissues only showed continuity inrelation tothe local "barbarous imitations",
234



TRANSOXIANA
while already substantially differing from them. Thus, the coins of Hyrcodes (pi. 19(13-25)) andtheearly Sogdian coins with a representation ofan archer (pi. 21 (1-11)) continue the local imitations ofthe drachms of Antiochus I; the early Chorasmian coins (pi. 23 (1-7)) originate from imitations ofthe tetradrachms of Eucratides; the coins of Sapadbizes (pi. 21 (13)) are derived from the imitations of the obols of Eucratides; and soon. Some ofthese issues occurred before the 6th and 7th centuries, and observation of their weight (and quality of silver) shows that their rate ofexchange was apparently still conventional. Many changes in the minting of coins in Transoxiana were closely bound upwith the country's external political contacts. Beginning in the 4th to 6th centuries, when fora variety of reasons a large number of Sasanian coins found their way across the Oxus, the locally minted coins (the "Bukharkhudat" coins and the series preceding them) showed a strong influence from both Sasanian minting practice and Sasanian coin-iconography. From the second half of the 7thcentury, after the establishment ofclose diplomatic relations with T'ang China, there began in Transoxiana (in Sughd, northern Tukharistan and a number ofother regions) the issue ofcast copper coins onthe Chinese pattern, and from the second half of the 8th century the influence of the caliphate was predominant inthe minting practice of Transoxiana.
In reconstructing the political history ofTransoxiana inthe 3rd to 1st centuries B.C. it is very important to consider the location of the northern frontier of the Greek possessions inAsia, which we can define only hypothetically. When, after their victorious march across Asia, Alexander's army encountered stubborn resistance in Transoxiana andbecame bogged down there forover two years, the Greeks could regard only Bactria as conquered, and felt their position onthe farside ofthe Oxus to be precarious. Clitus, to whom Alexander had just transferred, from the Persian Artabazus, theadministration of Bactria andSogdiana, said to Alexander at thebanquet at Maracanda, "You assign to me the province of Sogdiana, so often rebellious, and notonly untamedbut not even capable ofbeing subdued. I am sent to wild beasts, to which
nature has given incorrigible recklessness".1 The settlements of

Greek soldier-colonists (/caroi/a'cu), by means of which Alexander wished to keep these regions in submission, were well populated and constituted a force to bereckoned with. Their size can bejudged by
the information wehave1 regarding therevolt of the Greek settlers in Bactria and Sogdiana in 323 B.C. in favour ofreturning home after Alexander's death; the army ofthe rebels numbered twenty thousand foot and three thousand horse, although apparently not all the colonists took part inthe revolt. Alexander also tried tostrengthen his position inBactria by winning over the local nobles tohis side: he himself married Roxana, daughter of Oxyartes, one ofthe leaders ofthe Bactrians, and his comrades-inarms married other representatives ofthe local nobility (in particular, Seleucus married Apame, daughter of Spitamenes). The position of Greek authority beyond the Oxus must have been especially shaky asa result of the defeat of the revolt of323 B.C, after the severe suppression of which hardly any ofthe participants returned to Transcxiana. Although in area Sogdiana (if we take into account the whole territory between the Oxus and the Jaxartes) was by far the largest ofthe Greek territorial-administrative units in Asia, it was often mentioned, even in Alexander's lifetime, along with Bactria, as an appendage to the latter. After Alexander's death, Perdiccas in 323 B.C.appointed Philip, son
of Balakros, to be satrap of Bactria and Sogdiana,2 and in 321 Antipater
gave Bactria and Sogdiana (again joined together) to Stasanor.3 Itis hard to believe that atthis time, either, actual Greek authority extended over the whole territory of Sogdiana. More probably what was meant was some part of this territory directly adjacent to Bactria. In so far as the Oxus, with the river Vakhsh as its source served as the boundary, between Bactria and Sogdiana, it is most likely that the Greeks at that time wielded power in Transoxiana only over part of the right-bank valley ofthe Oxus, extending no further north than the Hisar range.
This situation hardly altered under the first Seleucids. In311-302 B.C. Seleucus I fought against the Median satrap Nicanor and consolidated his authority in the eastern part of the state. The conquest of Bactria
by Seleucus, on hisway to India,4 is usually dated 306 B.C., but we have no information about any of his campaigns in Transoxiana, although the Sogdians are mentioned (along with the Parthians,
Hyrcanians and Bactrians) among the peoples subject to him.5 What

is implied here, most probably, isthose Sogdians who lived just across the Oxus, along theright bank ofthe river. There isnoreliable testimony totheextent ofthe Seleucids' powerin Transoxiana forthelater period, either, when Seleucus' sonand future successor Antiochus I (who was Bactrian onhismother's side) became his deputy and co-ruler in theeastern satrapies (he wasco-ruler from 293 to 280 B.C.). We have information about the destruction by
"barbarians" of Alexandria in Margiana1 and of the building by Antiochus Soter ofa new city, Antiochia Margiana, theoasis which was
encircled by a wall 1,500 stadia in length.2 But the hypothetical "building", byanalogy with these events, oftwo Antiochias inTransoxiana ("Antiochia Tarmata" in place of Alexandria-on-the-Oxus, with its site at Tirmidh, and "Antiochia in Scythia" on the site of Alexandria Eschata), is based on a very late andinsufficiently reliable source.
The only definite evidence for penetration by the Seleucids into Transoxiana in the; 3rd century B.C. is the expedition carried out in the eighties by the Milesian Demodamas, son of Aristides, a Seleucid general, about the aims and results of which we have no detailed information. It is difficult to suppose that the Seleucids regarded themselves asmasters ofthe regions through which passed this expedition, thevery mention of which hascome down to us precisely because of its exceptional character, and which required forits
realization, according toJ. Wolski,3 theuse of troops from the central and western provinces of the Seleucid state. All we know is that Demodamas crossed theJaxartes anderected there analtar in honour
of Apollo.4
When he became sole king, Antiochus I (280-61 B.C.) was fully occupied with affairs on the western frontiers of the Seleucid state, and under Antiochus II (261-46 B.C.)the eastern satrapies fell away (Diodotus in Bactria, Andragoras in Parthia and Hyrcania) and all connection waslost between the Seleucids and Transoxiana. At this time there was still nominting oflocal coins in Transoxiana, or any regular circulation of foreign coins: we know of only two indubitable finds of Seleucid coins (atAfrasiyab, a site in Old Samarkand), andin the museums of Tashkent and Samarkand there are a

few specimens ofunknown origin. True, the first coins that Sogdiana knew were Seleucid ones: they it was that served as prototypes for the very earliest local imitations (from the end of the 3rd to the ist century B.C.). If, however, we are talking of political frontiers, then the very existence of such imitations must testify not to theinclusion of Sogdiana in the Seleucid state, but rather to the fact that the main areas inhabited by the Sogdians (in thebasin of the river Zarafshan) lay outside the limits of Seleucid authority. Undoubtedly the power ofthe Greeks inAsia did not extend as far as Chorasmia, the historical fate of which did not always coincide with that of the other peoples of Transoxiana; in particular, the Chorasmians did not take part in the struggle against Alexander's army, either as part ofDarius' host orafter his defeat, when operations moved beyond the Oxus. When the king of the Chorasmians, Pharasmanes (as Arrian calls him; toQuintus Curtius Rufus he isPhrataphernes), visited Alexander
in Bactria, he wasaccompanied by 1,500 horsemen.1 Pharasmanes offered Alexander his aid (" to be his guide and toget everything ready that the army would need"), if Alexander wanted tomarch against the "Colchians andAmazons" who were theChorasmians' neighbours. Alexander thanked Pharasmanes, and "made a treaty of friendship with him, but said that it was inopportune forhim to goto Pontus", and "asked Phrasmanes topostpone his aid" until such time as, having conquered India, andbecome master of all Asia, Alexander should "return to Hellas and from there proceed with all hisland and sea forces through the Hellespont and the Propontis, and fall upon Pontus".
This passage is sometimes seen as evidence ofChorasmian hegemony at that time over the north Caspian steppes and ofactual neighbourly relations between the Chorasmians and the peoples living besidethe Black Sea, even to the extent of an analogy being drawn with the khanate of the Golden Horde. It is more probable, however, that Alexander's refusal was the result ofvery vague geographical ideason the part ofthe "conqueror ofthe world", confusing (as, indeed, often happened) the Black Sea with the Aral Sea, or with the Caspian, and misunderstanding where it was that Pharasmanes was urging him to march. Alexander himself looked upon this fleeting encounter as signifying

the conquest of Chorasmia;1 but, according to one version,2 it was to Chorasmia that Spitamenes fled after hisfinal defeat, and theGreek forces did not decide topursue him thither. There is no evidence for any penetration by the Greeks into Chorasmia in subsequent years (and still less of the extension to that country of the political power of the Greek rulers in Asia). We have reliable evidence forthe rule of Alexander's successors in Asia over Bactria, Parthia and Hyrcania only. These regions were closely connected with Central Asia in their historical destiny and in their spiritual and material culture, but they lay outside Transoxiana. The most important regions of Transoxiana - the greater part of Sughd and Khwarazm remained atthat time beyond the limits ofthe political authority ofthe Seleucids. The northern frontier ofthe Greek possessions could not be pushed deep into Transoxiana during the following period, either, from the middle ofthe 3rd century to the last quarter ofthe 2nd century B.C., when the Greek rulers ofBactria were atthe height oftheir power. It would be hard tosuppose that the political history ofTransoxiana was not closely bound upwith that of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. But there are nogrounds foreven assuming that beyond the Oxus there existed a "Greco-Sogdian kingdom" comparable to Greco-Bactria, or anyother sort of independent Greek realm. Thestatement that Euthydemus and his supporters "first and foremost wonover to
rebellion Bactria and all the adjoining territory"3 cannot be interpreted as meaning that Euthydemus, before becoming king of Greco-Bactria, was at some period ruler of Sogdiana (Margiana, Areia). The mention of the Sogdians among the peoples with whom the Bactrians fought
wars inthe time ofEucratides4 is also not evidence that Sogdiana was subject tothe Greco-Bactrian king.
All this obliges usto consider more cautiously, too, Strabo's state
ment5 that the Bactrians "also ruled over Sogdiana, lying above Bactria towards the east, between the river Oxus, which separates the land of the Bactrians from Sogdiana, andthe river Jaxartes".The second part of this passage, inwhich the situation ofSogdiana inrelation to Bactria andits natural frontiers is described, is merely a geographical definition of what ismeant by Sogdiana, obviously going back tothe time ofAlexander and the accounts ofhis campaigns.

statement that theBactrians "also ruled over Sogdiana", to judge by the context, canrefer only to the "best days" of Greco-Bactria, that is, can have inmind only atemporary subjection ofsome lands inhabited by Sogdians. In that case - as also for theperiod between the end of the 4thcentury and themiddle of the 3rdB.C. - we may infer that the authority ofthe Greco-Bactrian kings extended notover allSughdbut only over some of the Sogdian territories on the farther side of the Oxus, directly adjoining the northern boundaries of Bactria. Reference is sometimes made, as though to a decisive argument, to the finds of Greco-Bactrian coins that have been made beyond the Oxus. It is true that finds of coins of many Greco-Bactrian kings have been made onthe right bank ofthe Oxus - coins ofDiodotus (copper), Euthydemus (silver and copper), Demetrius (silver and copper), Antimachus (silver), Agathocles (nickel and copper), Eucratides (silver) and Heliocles (silver). However, even the Tirmidh area, where the largest proportion of these finds of coins beyond the Oxus has been made, falls far short of the regions lying to the south of that river as regards the number of finds. In allthe other places in Transoxiana only isolated finds have occurred. The farther north one goes, the more rarely areGreco-Bactrian coins met with. In districts directly abutting on the right bank of the Oxus (the valleys of the Kafirnihan and the Surkhan Darya, andthe Hisar valley), there have been isolated finds of silver coins of Euthydemus, Demetrius andEucratides; somewhat more frequently, copper coins of Euthydemus have been found here (with thehead of Zeus and a prancing horse). North of the line of the Hisar ridge, inthe basin ofthe river Zarafshan, finds of Greco-Bactrian coins are extremely rare; a tetradrachm of Antimachus bearing Euthydemus' name wasfound in 1927 in the course of land-shifting work that happened to be going on at Panjikent; two obols of Eucratides were found in 1911 inSamarkand; five obols ofAntimachus were found before 1917 near Shahr-i Sabz (Kish). Since the 1930s, when extensive archaeological investigations began in the Zarafshan valley, right down to chepresent time, nota single Greco-Bactrian coin hasbeen found during these digs, although hundreds of burial mounds of the 1st centuries B.C. and A.D. have been opened, and dozens ofsites, forts and settlements of different periods investigated.
As forthe other parts of Transoxiana, only in Chorasmia have there been finds of two Greco-Bactrian coins (a tetradrachm of Eucratides and a drachm of Euthydemus); none have turned upin Chach (Shash) or Ushrusana or Farghana.

We may thus presume, on the basis of the coins found, that only Tirmidh andthe surrounding district was within the Greco-Bactrian dominions. The remaining valleys of southern Tajikistan and southern Uzbekistan, where at that time they did not strike their owncoins, must beseen asa sort of monetary vacuum into which Greco-Bactrian money flowed as foreign currency; it was precisely in this region that between theendof the 2nd andthe ist century B.C. theissue of local imitations of Greco-Bactrian coins began. As regards theremaining areas of Transoxiana, they arefully comparable, in respect of the number of Greco-Bactrian coins found there, with areas very remote from Bactria which were never subordinate to that state, such as southern Turkmenistan (a tetradrachm of Euthydemus on theNisa site; a tetradrachm of Eucratides at the settlement of Garry-Kariz), Transcaucasia (Greco-Bactrian coins in a hoard from Kobala) and even the Ukraine (one find ofa tetradrachm of Heliocles); any conclusion concerning political frontiers would in these cases be quite futile. What was there, in those days, beyond theOxus ? For the end of the 3rd century B.C. (about 206) we have unambiguous indications about this in theclassical sources. Euthydemus, besieged by a Seleucid army in Zariaspa (Bactria), asked that Antiochus III be told that "the situation of both sides is becoming unsafe". "Along thefrontier", he went on,"stands an immense horde of nomads, threatening us both; should thebarbarians cross thefrontier the country will certainly be
conquered bythem".1 The nomad horde remained behind thenatural frontier, the river Oxus, and this time, apparently, did not cross it. In the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C. a large part of Transoxiana was evidently in the hands of nomadic tribes, but as to who these tribes were, and whythey approached the borders of Bactria, the classical sources tell us almost nothing.

We must nowlook at Transoxiana from the standpoint of the east. Thanks to theChinese chronicles {Shih-chi, Han shu) weknow of conflicts at the end ofthe 3rd century and the beginning ofthe 2nd century B.C. between two large groups of nomadic tribes, theHsiung-nuand the Yueh-chih. These conflicts occurred fartothe east of Transoxiana, and as a result of them, theYue-chi tribes (who areusually identified

with the Tochari andAsiani of the classical writers) were forced into Transoxiana, crowding southward in their turn the tribes of Saka origin. Very probably the nomad hordes of whose presence on the Bactrian border Euthydemus spoke were Sakas. Thedisplacement of Sakas across the Oxus and towards the south and south-west, under the pressure of the Yueh-chih tribes, took place much later, around the middle of the 2ndcentury B.C.; already in the 1st century B.C. they appear in the political arena far to the south of Transoxiana as the "numismatic" dynasty which has left to us the so-called Indo-Saka coins.1 The first detailed description ofthe "western borderland" inChinese sources is based on the report of Chang-Ch'ien who wassent by the Chinese Imperial court to the Great Yueh-chih forthe purpose of concluding an alliance with them against the Hsiung-nu. Chang-Ch'ien, writing about the situation after 128B.C., names five large countries in the "western borderland", only one ofwhich, Ta-yuan, is inhabited by settled cultivators, the others - Wu-sun, K'ang-kiu, Yen-tsai and Great Yueh-chih - are all thehomes of nomads. Ta-yuan, with upto seventy towns, large and small, and a fewhundred thousand inhabitants, was the most populous country inthe " western borderland ". The generally accepted identification ofTa-yuan with Farghana hasquite recently been questioned by E. Pulleyblank. The identification of Ta-yuan with Sughd, which heproposes instead, is in anycase no more incompatible with the totality of other data. Ta-yuan isnot named among the countries subject to the Great Yueh-chih. There is nomention ofthe latter, either, in somewhat later information about Ta-yuan - in connection with the unsuccessful expedition ofa Chinese force ("6,000 horsemen from the dependent countries and a few tens of thousands ofyoung ne'er-do-wells from China") in 104B.C. against Ta-yuan in order to obtain some of the famous argamak horses of that locality, or in connection with the more successful repeatexpedition of 102-1 B . C , for the equipment of which "the whole Empire wasbrought into action". Themenof Ta-yuan were saved from complete defeat by referring to the "allied armies that were expected from K'ang-Kiu", the country lying to the north-west of Ta-yuan. If Ta-yuan really was Sughd then we possess some notion of the latter's internal political set-up. Allaffairs in this country were decided by "elders", but there wasalso a "ruler". Before 102 B.C.

the ruler of Ta-yuan was one Mugua (Mu-Kua); after the conclusion of peace, the Chinese "made ruler ofTa-yuan" a local grandee named Motsai (Mei-ts'ai); in ioc B.C., "with general consent (of the eldersof Ta-yuan) they killed him and called to the throne Shanfynya (Ch'an
fong), younger brother of Mugua".1 K'ang-kiu was a country ofnomads, most probably located (regardless of whether Ta-yuan be identified with Farghana or with Sughd) on the middle reaches of the Jaxartes. Chang-Ch'ien tells us that K'ang-kiu "recognises the suzerainty of the Yueh-chih in the south, and
in the east that of the Hsiung-nu".2 In the Han shu,where later information is also given (the account goes down to25 A.D.), it is merely said that "K'ang-kiu is dependent onthe Hsiung-nu to theeastward". The nomad realm of Yen-tsai ("nearly 2,000 //'from K'ang-kiu, to the north-west") lay "beside a great lake the shores of which are not high", and can besituated either onthe lower reaches ofthe Jaxartes (i.e. beside the Aral Sea) orelse beside the Caspian Sea, this being less likely. Chang-Ch'ien's statements about the Great Yueh-chih can be coordinated with those ofclassical writers concerning Transoxiana. He found them to the north of the river Guishui (i.e. theOxus); they had"an
army of 100,000 to 200,000 combatants",3 but, "dwelling in a free land, rarely subjected to enemy attacks, they are disposed to live
peacefully".4 That the Great Yueh-chih live north of the Oxus is also stated inthe Hanshu. According to Chang-Ch'ien," the Great Yueh-chih, moving westward
from Ta-yuan, struck at Ta-hia and conquered this country".5 Ta-hia had apopulation ofover a million; there "they have no supreme head, but nearly every town appoints itsown ruler". The Great Yueh-chih regarded Ta-hia (Bactria) as a country subject to them, but this dependence was, judging by the description given, only nominal. While recognizing the supremacy of the Great Yueh-chih, who remained in Transoxiana, Bactria still retained its independence (Chang-Ch'ien went there as to another country), and normal life went on without any obvious effects of"nomad invasions": there were cities and settlements of permanent inhabitants, surrounded by walls; in thecapital there was a market with a great variety of goods; trade flourished, including international trade (merchants from Bactria travelled on

business to India). This situation probably continued into the ist century B.C., if we accept theaccount given in theHan shu. Chang-Ch'ien's preponderant interest in the nomad countries, especially the larger ones, is easily understood: he had been sent to find allies for China against the Hsiung-nu. He speaks of a settled agricultural population only in connection with Ta-yuan; butthis does not mean that there were no permanent settlements in other parts of Transoxiana. Archaeological data can supplement the picture drawn by Chang-Ch'ien.
In the second half of the ist millennium B.C., small irrigated oases (along irrigation canals ten to fifteen kilometres in length), with a population engaged in agriculture, formed sporadic islets in uncultivated territory. During Alexander's entire journey from the Oxus to Maracanda he came upon not a single settlement. In Sogdiana, asin Bactria, only irrigated oases were fertile, "but a large part of this territory consists of uninhabited desert; owing to its aridity these cheerless regions are without inhabitants and produce nothing".1 Large settlements provided with walls (thesite at Afrasiyab = Maracanda, andtheKyuzeli-gyr site in Chorasmia), apparently lacked continuous built-up areas and were (like the "cliffs" mentioned in connection with Alexander's campaigns) places of refuge for the whole population of an oasis (comparable to the refugia of the European "barbarians") rather than towns. Only about the beginning ofthe Christian eraand in the first centuries of it do archaeological data give evidence ofthe appearance oftrunk-canals of great length for irrigation purposes, andtherise of urban life in the full sense of the word.
Transoxiana's acquaintance with money began in the 3rd century B.C., when Seleucid coins found their waythere, as foreign currency. At the endof the 3rdor at the beginning of the 2ndcentury B.C.the first locally produced "barbarous imitations" were issued in Sughd. At present we can speak with assurance of only two "lines" of local imitations of Seleucid coins.
For one of these (pi. 19 (1, 2)) the prototype was provided by Seleucid drachms of the Alexander type (with, on the obverse side, the head of Herakles = Alexander, facing right, and on the reverse side a seated figure of Zeus, bearing aneagle, facing left). This group of imitations is known to us only from a very small number of specimens, and cannot be assigned a location with any precision.
1 Quintus Curtius Rufus, vn,n. 27.

TRANSOXIANA
The other group (pi. 19(4-11)) was issued in thevalley of the river Zarafshan (on the middle reaches) and took as its prototype the drachms of Antiochus I (obverse, a king's head facing right; reverse, a horse's head facing right). Thenumerous series of coins that make up this group illustrate various stages of departure from the original prototype, which testifies to the long period during which they were being struck. If we take as the date of their first issue the end of the 3rd century B.C., then the making of these imitations went on for not less than twocenturies: to the final series of imitations of drachms of Antiochus I are directly related the earliest coins of Hyrcodes (pi. 19 (13) - a "hybrid" specimen), and also theearly series of Sogdian coins with a representation of an archer (pi. 19(12) andpi. 21(1-11)).
Apparently, the link between these imitations and the name of Antiochus wasretained in oral tradition (most probably through the names used for the coins), since on oneof the very last series (pi. 19 (11)) there is an attempt to render in Aramaic characters the name of Antiochus (?ntwh\ andthe earliest coins showing an archer (the initial pattern forthese was obviously not made by a local craftsman - pi. 21 (2)) "trace themselves back" to Antiochus' strikings by virtue of the Greek legend on the reverse side (BAIIAEQZ ANTIOXOY).
At roughly this time there began in the western part of the valley of the river Zarafshan (the Bukhara oasis) theissuing of imitations of the tetradrachms of the Greco-Bactrian king Euthydemus - at first (2nd century and part of 1st century B.C.)only with the distorted Greek legend (pi. 20 (1-4)). To the north of Sughd - in Chorasmia or along the middle reaches of the Jaxartes - must have been thelocation of an imitation of a tetradrachm of another Greco-Bactrian king, Eucratides, which canbe approximately dated as 2nd-ist centuries B.C.: theearliest Chorasmian coins go back to this.
Imitations ofthe obols of Eucratides (with the king wearing a helmet on theobverse side), belonging to thetime between thelast decades of the 2nd century B.C. and theend of the 1stcentury A.D. (pi. 21 (12)), are located very narrowly in southern Tajikistan (the burial-ground of Tup-khon, near Hisar, the Tuikhar burial-ground in the Bishkent valley, both of these points being in thebasin of the river Kafirnihan). In the same territory (but, apparently, from the middle ofthe 1 st century B.C.) andin districts of southern Uzbekistan there circulated (and were probably issued) copper imitations of tetradrachms and drachms of



TRANSOXIANA
Heliocles (pi. 22), finds of which have also been made to the south of the Oxus; the issuing ofthese imitations in copper preceded their being struck from silver (end of the 2nd, middle of the 1stcentury B.C.), but it is difficult to establish where this took place, since the only documented find that hasbeen made of them is the Qunduz hoard, at the Khisht-tepe site in northern Afghanistan. Determination of the initial habitat of the imitations of Heliocles' coins is also made difficult by the fact that they continued in circulation right down to the Kushan period, and inclusive, judging bythe archaeological stratigraphy of the finds made of them, andthe other coins found along with them. It is most probable that their initial habitat covered only the districts of southern Uzbekistan (from there have come the majority of the specimens belonging to theearliest series of these imitations) andonly later (with the cessation of the issuing of imitations of obols of Eucratides) didit extend to include also parts of southern Tajikistan.
Thus, both the written sources andthe numismatic data show that Transoxiana in the 2ndand 1st centuries B.C. lacked internal political unity. Even Sughd (the basin of the river Zarafshan) was divided between at least two realms, this corresponding more or less tothe later partition of the Zarafshan valley into "Bukharan Sughd" and "Samarkandian Sughd"; accordingly we have imitations of tetradrachms of Euthydemus and imitations of drachms of Antiochus I, with a horse's head onthe reverse side. Imitations of the tetradrachms of Eucratides can beassigned to K'ang-Kiu or to Chorasmia, although this location is still hypothetical. Theimitations of coins of Heliocles are defined with confidence asYueh-chih strikings, but it is still unclear whether they were struck for thewhole Yueh-chih domain or for only one of the five Yueh-chih realms {hsi-hou) of which welearn from the Han shu (Hsiu-mi, with the city of Hsiu-mi; Shuang-mi with the city of Shuang-mi; Kwei-shwang, with the city of Hu-tsao; Hsi-tun, with the city of Po-mo; Kao-fu with the city of Kao-fu - Han shu 96A, 14b). The latter is more probable, since the area of circulation of the imitations of the coins of Heliocles is much smaller than the territory occupied bytheGreat Yueh-chih, to judge bythedescriptions given in the Chinese sources. If this is so,the"displacement" of the imitations of the obols of Eucratides from thevalley of the Kafirnihan andtheir replacement byimitations of the coins of Heliocles might be connected with the struggle of the Kwei-shwang (Kushan) tribe of the Yue-chi for supremacy over the other four tribes within thetribal union, and

TRANSOXIANA
the imitations of the coins of Heliocles could beseen asbeing struck by the Yiieh-chih tribe of Kwei-shwang, whereas the imitations ofthe obols ofEucratides were minted by the tribe (or realm) of Shuang-mi, lying to the east of Kwei-shwang.

The Great Yiieh-chih were undoubtedly the dominant political power in a considerable area of Transoxiana in the 2nd and 1stcenturies B.C. Connected with them also was a political event of crucial significance for the whole ofthe Middle East - the rise ofthe Kushan kingdomas a result ofthe elevation of the Yue-chi tribe ofKwei-shwang and their subjection of the other four tribes. Although the problem of the precise chronology of the Kushans remains unsettled, wedo possess a few reliable dates closely related to political history for the first centuries A.D. Of particular importance forthe history of Transoxiana is thedate of the migration of the Great Yiieh-chih southward, across the Oxus. The information given in the Han sbu, mentioned above, enables us to estimate that neither the crossing over bythe Great Yiieh-chih tothe left bank of the Oxus northecreation of the Kushan kingdom can have occurred before 25 A.D.,though we do not know how much later it was that they occurred. The chronological limit after which the continued existence of the Kushan kingdom is outof the question is defined by two events ofthe seventies and eighties ofthe 4th century: in the western part of the Kushan kingdom Sasanian governors (belonging to theroyal dynasty) were at that time minting coins on which they described themselves as Kushan-shah, andthe southern and eastern parts ofthe Kushan kingdom were then being conquered by Chandragupta II, who brought them within the bounds of the Gupta state. From inscriptions we know that the reigns of all the Kushan kings lasted alltogether about two centuries. Regardless of howthe "burning question" ofthe date ofKanishka may besolved, it is clear that somewhere between 25 A.D. and theseventies or eighties of the 4th century there took place the two-hundred-year history of the
Kushan kingdom.1
In the 1st - or, if we accept the later variants ofKanishka's date, the 2nd - century A.D. Kujula Kadphises (Kieu-tsieu-kio), having united the Great Yiieh-chih under his authority, established far to the south of

the Oxus the territorial nucleus of the Kushan kingdom. But his link with Transoxiana was apparently broken at this time. The abundant copper coinage of Kujula Kadphises, represented by numerous finds made within his dominions (in Taxila alone more than two thousand coins of his were found), is completely absent north of the Oxus; only a few specimens from Tirmidh are known. Later, judging by finds of coins of Vima Kadphises or Kanishka I, there took place a partial reconquista bytheKushans in Transoxiana. However, the Kushan dominions extended no farther than the Hisar range. In the basins of the Vakhsh, the Surkhan Darya and the Kafirnihan, and in the Hisar valley, finds of coins of Vima Kadphises, Kanishka I, Huvishka (encountered most rarely of all), Vasudeva and Kanishka III are numbered in hundreds. They are also known on the right bank of the middle reaches ofthe Oxus (as farastheTurkmenistan S.S.R., inclusive). This same period sawthe extensive opening up by irrigation ofthe valleys of southern Tajikistan, and apparently of southern Uzbekistan as well, to settlement by a permanent population engaged in agriculture: large trunk canals, up to a hundred kilometres in length, were dug, and theinhabitants ofthe smaller valleys and thefoothills migrated to these newly irrigated lands. Wehave information from inscriptions (and, in particular, from the great Surkh Kotal inscription of Nokonzok) of the irrigation works carried out by the Kushan administration in other regions of this extensive state. For Transoxiana we have, apart from the purely archaeological data and finds of coins, only one piece of indirect evidence that such works for the establishment of large trunk canals were carried out there as well by the Kushan administration. In the Vakhsh valley (to the north-east of the Urta-boz heights) there hascome down to ourown daytheplace-name Karalang (attached to a large natural boundary and an old offshoot, neglected since the 12thcentury, of the trunk-canal), which is probably derived from the Bactrian KapaX-payyo "head of the frontier region" (which is also the title given to Nokonzok inthe great Surkh Kotal inscription).
The question ofthe administrative structure ofthe Kushan dominions in Transoxiana (as generally of the administrative structure of the Kushan kingdom) remains as yet unanswered. It would seem that not only the peripheral but also the central parts of the Kushan kingdom were divided among rulers with the rank of satrap, or sovereigns subordinate to the Kushan "king of kings". It is not impossible that some of these rulers mayhave obtained the right to strike silver coins,
248



TRANSOXIANA
the striking of gold coins being reserved to the "king of kings". This possibility is suggested, in particular, by the existence of silver coins of Zeionises (Jihunik), a contemporary and satrap of Vima Kadphises. If we accept the hypothesis of such an administrative structure, then one of the Kushan governors in Transoxiana may have been Sanab (pi. 21 (14-16)): his name on coins is usually read as "Heraeus" or "Miaios", but if we take account only of the early, undistorted spellings of the Greek legend, it is more likely that this word is not the ruler's name but the Aramaic ideogram MR'Y "sovereign" in Greek characters). The palace at Khalchayan (near the town of Denau, in the valley of the river Surkhan Darya), which was excavated by G. A. Pugachenkova, could, if we were to assume it to be somewhat younger, be seen as the remains of the residence of one of the Kushan governors in Transoxiana. Apparently there had already taken definitive form and become profoundly marked, so early as the Kushan period, the historicocultural demarcation between the areas of southern Tajikistan and southern Uzbekistan (the future north Tukharistan) and the other parts of Transoxiana. In any case, only the southernmost districts of Transoxiana were under the rule of the Kushan kings. North of the Hisar range, finds of Kushan coins are encountered extremely rarely (a few specimens from the basin of the river Zarafshan), and neither Sughd nor Chach nor the other principal regions of Transoxiana show traces of any extension of Kushan political power to include them. Also to be decided negatively is the question of the inclusion of Chorasmia in the Kushan kingdom, although this suggestion wasput forward after the finds of Kushan coins in the lower reaches of the Oxus; over a hundred specimens were found, from the reigns of Kanishka, Huvishka and Vasudeva, coins of the last-mentioned being markedly predominant. These finds cannot, however, be used to define political frontiers, since many of the Kushan coins from Chorasmia are marked with an S, a graphic countermark which is well known, though in the form of a tamgha, on Chorasmian coins (on silver ones of the 3rd and 4th centuries, and on copper ones struck not earlier than the 4th century). Through this mark the Kushan coins are transformed from the "foreign" into the local category.
249

IV
Still more definite evidence of the political independence of most parts of Transoxiana in the Kushan period is provided by the independent local strikings found there. In most cases they go back, without perceptible breaks, to those "barbarous imitations" which earlier (in the 2nd and ist centuries B.C.)were issued and circulated in the same regions. Apart from coins we have practically no sources from which to reconstruct the internal political life of Transoxiana. Between the 2ndand 5 th centuries the relative importance of the settled population in the economic life of Transoxiana increases markedly, and the nomads lose their former role as the dominant political force. Along with this the previous large territorial unions break up andtheterritorial-political division of the country becomes more fragmented. It would seem that, in order to understand the processes taking place in that period inthe society of Transoxiana,one needs to remember the great trunk-canals that were laid out in approximately this period, andthepopulating of thenewly irrigated lands by migrants from thesmall oases ofthe foothill zone. People living along the great trunk-canal not only jointly used its water andkept it clean and in repair; from the social standpoint they formed a close and stable community, whose economic cohesion was eventually given political form. This process found its fullest expression in the7th and early 8thcenturies, when theentire territory of Transoxiana, occupied by settled agricultural inhabitants, was divided into small oasis-states. In the Kushan period, too, thepolitical map of Transoxiana that can be compiled from numismatic data shews a rather fragmented realm.
We cantherefore saywith confidence that in the 3rd-5th centuries, Chorasmia was divided into "left-bank" and "right-bank" realms. In the same period the basin of the Zarafshan wasdivided not only into "Bukharan Sughd" and " Samarkandian Sughd" but also into several different realms, each of which struck its own coins. The numismatic habitats cannot always be correlated with the information given in the Chinese dynastic chronicles {Bei-shi, Sui-shu)y but in general the contours arebecoming more andmore definite as coin material is being accumulated. In Samarkandian Sughd in the ist or 2ndcentury A.D. there began the issuing of coins that showed, onthe reverse side, a standing archer (pi. 21 (1-11)). The time during which they were struck can be divided
250



TRANSOXIANA
into four periods. The first of these (pi. 21 (1-5)) is the time ofthe coins of Ashtam (early Sogdian legend ysfm on the obverse side), the primary pattern for which was made by an obviously non-local craftsman and included on the reverse side the Greek legend BA2IAEQI ANTIOXOY. Later, with the making of new dies by local engravers, the Greek legend quickly became (as with the "barbarous imitations ") distorted andornamental. Directly parallel to the "barbarous imitations", too, wasthe reduction of the coins with the archer from theAttic standard of about 4 grammes to 1-1.5 grammes, as early asthe first ofthe periods, and later in the third period - rapidly and regardless of any metrological norms - there was a further fall in weight to 0.2-0.3 grammes. Any further reduction ofthese "drachms" was simply impossible, and during the fourth period their weight remained roughly the same; but there wasa worsening of the silver content.
Thus, the archer coins (like many other Transoxianan coins of this period) show signs characteristic of "barbarous imitations" and of coins with a conventional (non-value) rate of exchange. The archer coins of the second period (the Sogdian legend onthe obverse, fiycartypi. 21 (6); hprwnh- pi. 21 (7-9)) retain the former compositional scheme, butthe representations themselves have departed considerably from the initial pattern. During the third period (on the obverse, kySr pi. 21 (10)) the stylizing of the representations is even more marked, leading to almost complete disintegration in the coins of the fourth period (plate III, 13-16): in the specimens that have come down tous there are only illegible vestiges ofwhat was apparently a cursive legend.
It is roughly possible to date the archer coins by periods. Coins of the second period (closed writing of the letter vdv> notyetshown in the Sogdian "Ancient Letters") must be dated not earlier than the 4th century; those of the third period (appearance of ligatures in the writing) can be assigned to the 5thcentury; and those of the fourth period aredated, from archaeological stratigraphy (the Penjikent site), as belonging to thelate 5 th or early 6th century.
Since thearcher coins bear no titles (if we do notinclude the Greek legend, rapidly subjected to ornamentation), and one and the same legend remains on coins struck over a period of a hundred yearsand more, it is clear that these coins did not bear the personal, nominal mark of the rulers of Samarkandian Sughd between the 1st and 2nd centuries andthe 6th century andthe first half of the 7th.
251



TRANSOXIANA
The so-called coins of Hyrcodes (pi. 19 (13-25)) are in many ways parallel with thearcher coins. Their location in thesouth-western part of Sughd is beyond doubt (the main area of the finds is the southwestern part of the Bukhara oasis andthe district of Amul), but this needs to be narrowed down more precisely. It is necessary todistinguish between two branches ofthe coins bearing the name of Hyrcodes (the Greek legend YPKGdAOY on the obverse side), the difference lying in what appears on the reverse side (a standing divinity with a flame rising from his shoulder and the legend APAH0POY MA KAPOY; a protome of a prancing horse and the legend YPKOOAOY. These coins altered approximately in thesame way as thearcher coins (beginning of distortion of the legend, pi. 19 (14, 20); thesigns making up the illegible legend are merely reminiscent of letters of the Greek alphabet-pi. 19 (15, 21).But attempts to replace the Greek legend which hadlost its meaning by a new, Sogdian legend (pi. 19 (22)... MR'Y'... ?;pi. 19 (16-18) - ynt9nyyw\n, asW. B.Henning read it) were accompanied by substantial changes in theiconography of the obverse side and were apparently connected with theappearance in themint of new die-engravers. Thewhole subsequent minting (pi. 19(23-25)) is anepigraphic and constitutes a consecutive series in which the "disintegration" of the representations is fully completed. Parallel with these changes in the representations and the legend goes a gradual reduction in weight and, in the final phase, a sharp deterioration in the silver content.
Like the archer coins, the coins of Hyrcodes are essentially an anonymous minting that shows neither theruler's name norhistitles. In Sughd (in thesouthern or south-western part) yetanother group of early Sogdian coins was issued (pi. 19 (3)), derived from imitations of early Seleucid drachms of the Alexander type (through the reverse side, where Zeus bearing an eagle is depicted in a very stylized way). Unlike thearcher coins andthecoins of Hyrcodes, on these coins the Sogdian legend (obverse 'ywSw yn\ reverse AfR'Y) includes the title "ruler", rendered by means of an Aramaic ideogram. These coins, less than a score of which are known, can be dated only broadly - some time between the 2nd and4thcenturies.
In the Bukhara area coins were still being struck in this period on the pattern of the tetradrachms of Euthydemus. In the 1stcentury B.C. or the 1st century A.D.,however, along with the spoiled Greek legend there appears first the tamgha H (pi. 20 (5)), and then also an early
252



TRANSOXIANA
Sogdian legend, i.e., a change takes place from a purely imitative striking to a Sogdian striking in accordance with the type of the tetradrachm of Euthydemus.
Only the earliest legend on these coins (myrhat - pi. 20 (6)) is unaccompanied by a title. On the unique coin in the British Museum, Henning proposed to read k$ct MLK\ butit is notimpossible that the second word is MR\Y). The title MR'Y is found, in any case, onall the other coins of this group (it can be read with certainty also where Henning sawMLK' twhr) in combination with yet another word, the reading of which remains unclear (it is hardly likely to be a personal name: more probably a place-name or another title). In theprocess of reproducing one and the same legend over about four centuries this legend underwent stylization (butwith a stable and quite intelligible way of writing). In other words, for theSogdian legend on these coins there was developed a special kind of ductuswhich is notfound on any other written memorials. This accounts for the special difficulty experienced in reading it.
In the minting of Sogdian coins of the type of the tetradrachms of Euthydemus we can distinguish two main periods (with a more detailed chronological subdivision within each of these). The first period must be dated from the 1st century B.C. to the 1st century A.D.(a ruler wearing a diadem - pi. 20 (5-9)) and the second (a ruler wearing a "tiara" - pi. 20(10-12)) from the 2ndto the4th century.
Despite theinstability in the weight of the Sogdian coins of the type of the tetradrachms of Euthydemus, complete reduction did not take place. But their rate of exchange was conventional: the concealed reduction (worsening of the silver content) shows this to have beenso. In thesecond half of the 4thcentury (orat theendof it) theissue of Sogdian coins of the type of the tetradrachms of Euthydemus suddenly stops, andthey arereplaced by coins with a quite different appearance (pi. 24(5, 6)): small silver coins with a head-and-shoulders representation of a ruler in a diadem on theobverse (on thewhole, iconographically in the Transoxianan tradition), and on the reverse an altar with a blazing fire and a circular legend in Sogdian, in which only the title AfR'y can beread. In this same period, copper coins with the same type of obverse were being struck (pi. 24 (7, 8)) but which had onthe reverse a man's face on a sacrificial altar. Both of these series areancestors of a newand lengthy "numismatic dynasty" of Bukharan copper coins (pi. 24(9-15)), the issue of which went on until the 7th century. The

TRANSOXIANA
5 th and 6thcenturies also sawthe appearance of other series of coins in theBukhara oasis (often anepigraphic) which it is at present difficult to correlate with specific states and sovereigns.
Bukharan silver strikings of the type of the drachms of Bahrain V (the legend is read byV.A. Livshits aspwx*r xwb k'w) seem to show a transition to circulation on a value basis, and, as regards internal politics, to the formation of a hierarchical structure of rulers of different ranks in theBukhara oasis. Similar processes took place in the 5 th and 6th centuries in other parts of Transoxiana as well. The development and spread of new social forms were accompanied by the appearance of new centres for the minting of coins, newseries of coins, anda generally much more intricate situation as regards the circulation of money in Transoxiana in this period. Precise location hasbeen suggested by S. K. Kabanov for groups of copper coins with a representation on the reverse side of a king cleaving a lion with hissword (pi. 24(18); Livshits reads the Sogdian legend as kysykw k!w " King of Kish" ?). Allthe finds of these coins are connected with the Kashka Darya oasis. A fewlarge numismatic groups, however, have as yet not been given a well-founded geographical attribution (pi. 24(16, 17, 19)).
The first steps in independent striking of coins in Chorasmia were taken in the 1stcentury B.C. and the 1st century A.D. Here wecantrace how gradually a transition occurred from purely imitative issues to independent ones. First (pi. 23 (1)), on the imitations of tetradrachms of the Greco-Bactrian king Eucratides (a king wearing a helmet/charging Dioscuri) there appeared only the tamgha A , which has been given thename "Chorasmian" (although a very close variant is found on Sogdian coins of the type of the tetradrachms of Euthydemus pi. 20 (5)): with afew modifications, this isafeature ofall the subsequent Chorasmian strikings.
Later, theiconography is changed, first on the obverse andlater on the reverse (pi. 23 (2, 3)): instead of the two charging Dioscuri, a horseman is shown, facing right. The horseman, like the tamgha, is characteristic of the majority of the Chorasmian silver coins, andsome of the copper ones, down to the middle of the 8th century.
Then there appear on thereverse side (at first along with thevestiges of the distorted Greek legend) Chorasmian legends (ina local variation of the Aramaic script), containing as a rule the name and title of a king {wrtrmws MLK'-pl. 23 (3); w%myr MLK'-pL 23 (4);s'nfiry
254



TRANSOXIANA
M L K ' - p i . 23 (6) etc.). Early Chorasmian silver strikings are known from a very small number of specimens, buta copper coin was issued at the same time, the reverse side ofwhich was often completely occupied by the tamgha (copper coins of King Vazamar-pl. 23 (5)). Later, during the 5 th andpart of the 6th centuries, silver was not minted in Chorasmia, while copper coins continued to be issued.
When the issuing of silver coins wasresumed, in the 7th century, the appearance of the coins wasdifferent: on the thin, flat disc, representations were executed in very low relief, and the style of the representations was changed. In that period, apparently, in Chorasmia as in Bukhara, a transition took place from a conventional to a valuebased circulation of silver coins.
Simultaneously with the resumption of silver minting, the titles given inthe legend were altered - the dual title MR'Y A1LK'" sovereign (and) king" is shown, plus thename of the ruler (MR'Y MLK' sr'm pi. 24 (11); MR'Y MLK' k'nyk - pi. 24 (12); MR'Y MLK' w^k'ncwr (I)pl. 24 (13); MR'Y MLK' xwsrw - pi. 24 (14); MR'Y MLK'sj'wrsprn and also a name in the Sogdian legend on the obverse side - pi. 24(4)).
Comparison of the numismatic data with the information given by BirunI (and, inparticular, with his list oftwenty-two kings who reigned over Chorasmia between 304 and994 A.D.) results in coincidence only in a fewnames for the 8thcentury (Shavashfar, Azkajuvar) and in two cases for earlier kings (^rQmwxin BirunI, wrtrmws on coins; s'ws and sy'wrsprri). Just as unreliable, as Livshits has recently shown, are Birunl's statements about "the eraof Afrlgh": comparison of Chorasmian inscriptions dated in accordance with the local era (documents from Toprak-kala with the dates 188,204,207and 231; inscriptions on silver vessels with dates 570, 700,703 ?, 714; inscriptions on ossuaries from Tok-kala with dates between 658 and 738) with objects and strata dated independently of the inscriptions show that the era used in these inscriptions can begin not later than the first decades of the 2nd century A.D., butcertainly notin 304 A.D. The "era of Afrigh" of which BirunI wrote, if it existed at all, was not the official era used throughout Chorasmia.
The dual title "sovereign (and) king" on Chorasmian silver coins of the 7thand8 th centuries presupposes thepresence in Chorasmia of several sovereigns (MR'Y = xwtw), each possessing a certain degree of independence but subordinate to a king (Khwaraymshdh with the title MLK') who was himself one of these sovereigns. The existence of
255



TRANSOXIANA
such "ducal" sovereigns in Chorasmia is attested by their coins. B. I. Vainberg considers that the "sovereign (and) king" Khusrau (down to 712) ruled only over the Kerder oasis, although, judging by the title on the coins, he regarded himself as being king of all Chorasmia. A similar internal political structure is particularly clearly traceable for Samarkandian Sughd in the second half of the 7th century and the first half of the 8th, that is, forthe period when the cast copper coins of the Chinese pattern were issued here (usually with on one sidethe tamgha and on the other a Sogdian legend with the name and title of the ruler), to which O. I. Smirnova hasdevoted almost forty years' study.
The supreme ruler of Samarkandian Sughd bore the title " k i n g " (MLK* on coins and in documents, the ideogram for Sogdian ysyS = ikhshid): c. 642 - Shishplr {syspyr MLKy), c. 650-5 - Varkhuman {firywntn MLK9), 696-8 - Tukaspadak {twk?spyhyk MLK\ c. 700-9 - Tarkhun (trynrn MLK'), 712-38 - Ghurak (V/ryfe MLK9). This list could beextended (or, more precisely, supplemented) with a few more names which areknown to us either solely from coins or else solely from written sources.
Although the royal title could pass from father to son (in particular, one of the points in thetreaty of 712 between Ghurak and the Arabs guarantees recognition bythe latter of Ghurak's son as hissuccessor), in theChinese sources wemuch more often find statements that such and such an ikhshid was "installed by thepeople", "chosen by the nobles", etc.
The other title found in different forms in the sources is that of "sovereign" (on coins, as a rule, MR'Y;in documents it is met with, spelt outin Sogdian, as ywfw or y^j3). One of the khvatdvs was also supreme king - his full title was "king of Sughd, sovereign of Samarkand" (sywdfnk MLK' smyrkndc MR'Y). From coins we know best the "dynasty" of sovereigns of Penjikent. Judging bythedocuments from the Mount Mugh archive, the sovereign ofPenjikent (Panch) was Dlvashtich, but we have no knowledge of Penjikent coins with his name orofhis coins for all Sughd; for atleast two years, and apparently at the same time asGhurak, Dlvashtich called himself " king of Sughd, sovereign of Samarkand".
The general picture of the internal political life of Samarkandian Sughd, of Chorasmia and of other parts of Transoxiana is somewhat complicated bythe disturbing circumstance of the struggle against the Arabs between theend of the 7th century and the first quarter of the

8th, butit would seem that ourattention should at present be concentrated on thefundamental phenomena and processes, since in any case we areunable with ourpresent sources to reconstruct in detail the concrete changes in the internal political history of Transoxiana between the 3rd and 7th centuries.
About the 3rdand4thcenturies thepolitical map of Transoxiana becomes more fragmented than in the age of the "barbarous imitations". Northern Tukharistan (the basin of the right bank of the Oxus) is finally separated from theother parts of Transoxiana, first under the rule ofthe Kushan kings and then under the Sasanian governors in the districts conquered from the Kushan kingdom. The habitat of KushanoSasanian coins in Transoxiana is now defined fairly sharply: theyare known along the whole of the right bank of the Oxus asfaras Chahar Ju, areencountered in theBukhara oasis (Paikand) and are especially numerous in thevalleys of the Surkhan Darya, Kafirnihan, Qizil Su and Vakhsh, andin theHisar valley. Further north anddeeper into Transoxiana, however, absolutely no Kushano-Sasanian coins are found.
Bukharan Sughd was, down to thesecond half of the 4th century, almost entirely under therule of sovereigns who issued coins of the type of the tetradrachms of Euthydemus. But the southern and southwestern parts of Transoxiana didnotbelong to them: the "dynasty of Hyrcodes" (orrather thetwo "dynasties", butit is notclear how they were divided territorially), struck their own money, and other independent Sogdian realms existed (to one of them belong the coins with a seated figure of Zeus onthe reverse). Down to the 6th century, or the first half of the 7th, thesingle line of tradition is not broken in Samarkandian Sughd, which seems to have been formed early on into a politically united whole.
Chorasmia in the first centuries of the Christian era seems more "advanced" socially and politically. Its ruler assumed the title of " k i n g " before any of the other dynasties of Transoxiana. Almost nothing is known of the internal political life of the northern borderlands ofTransoxiana down to the 6th and 7th centuries; there a settled agricultural population seems to have begun somewhat later to set about constructing large trunk-canals. The closer vicinity ofthe nomad political groupings provides only a partial explanation of the social and political backwardness of Chach, Farghana and other areas lying to the north of the rest of Transoxiana. The rulers of small oases, separated from each other economically
257



TRANSOXIANA
and politically, were unable to offer serious resistance if Transoxiana were invaded. Themention of "Kish, Sughd, and the mountains of Chach" as forming one of the boundaries up to which Iranshahr extended, in Shapur I's inscription on the Ka'ba-yi Zardusht (262) may be evidence ofa campaign by Shapur I across the Oxus. Possessing as we donomore detailed sources for,or material traces of, Shapur I's visit to Transoxiana, the itinerary of his army can be reconstructed only in a purely speculative way - from Marv over the river-crossing at Amul (Chahar Ju)to Paikand, a distance of twelve farsakhs (thirtysix miles) across a sand desert, and then another five farsakhs to Bukhara; if "the mountains of Chach", i.e. the mountains onthe border of Chach, means theNura-tau ridge, then Shapur I may have got asfarasthe middle reaches of the river Zarafshan (Samarkand and its environs), andKish would then have lain on hisway back to the Oxus and Balkh.
However, none of the realms of Transoxiana was included in Shapur I's dastkart "Res Gestae". There is no mention, either, of the Iranian sovereigns ruling over these realms through vassals belonging to local dynasties, and the coins minted here bythe local rulers provide no foundation for such a supposition. Influence of Sasanian coin iconography on thecoins of the Bukhara oasis is noticeable from the last decades of the 4thcentury onward, when the reverse side of the local coins begin to show a representation of an altar (onthe copper coins a man's face appears on the altar), borrowed either from the Kushano-Sasanian coins orfrom those ofShapur II(pi. 31 (1-5)). Later, the drachms of Bahram V (or imitations of these in the Hephthalite period) served as prototype for the so-called "Bukharkhudat" coins; this line wascontinued, in the form of the "gitrifi" dirhams, in the mintings of Transoxiana right down to the n t h century.
The influence of Sasanian Iran was also noticeable in Chorasmia. In the reign of King Vazamar it wasshown in the iconography of the obverse of the silver coins (the shape of the crown andother details) and also in the composition of the design of the copper coins. It is not impossible that it was under Sasanian influence that the royal titles assumed theform they didin Chorasmia. The complicated relations (very confusedly depicted in the sources) between Sasanian Iran andits eastern neighbours in the 5 th and 6th centuries donotseem to have had any direct effect onthe countries of Transoxiana: the struggle was fought out further south, in Tukharistan
258



TRANSOXIANA
(Taliqan, Balkh). There is no reflection of these relations in the coins
of Transoxiana in this period - nor do they reflect the conquest of
Sughd by theHephthalites (509). Only in the7thcentury, it seems, was theinternal political structure of the countries of Transoxiana finally constituted - a system of petty independent sovereigns recognizing the paramountcy of a king who also has his own territory and is, essentially, a" sovereign ofsovereigns ". In this period we canagain observe comparatively large countries on the political map of the region - Bukharan Sughd, Samarkandian Sughd, Chorasmia, northern Tukharistan, Chach, Farghana - the political cohesion of these countries being apparently ofvarying extent. It may be that this process was somewhat accelerated by Transoxiana's external political conflicts in the 7th century, first with China (in the western regions there was even carried outin 650-5 a reorganization of the Chinese administrative divisions, and the wang of Kang, Fu-hu-man (i.e. the ikhshld Varkhuman) was "appointed" governor-general of Sughd), and then with the Arabs, whose first contacts with Transoxiana took the form of raids. Even after the victorious raid by Qutaiba b. Muslim in 712,when he carried "fire and sword" throughout the region, Transoxiana could not be regarded as having been finally conquered. In 718-19, three rulers from Transoxiana - the ikhshld of Sughd, Ghurak, the king of Bukhara, Tughshada, and the sovereign of Kumedh, Narayana - sent messages to the T'ang emperor Hsiian Tsung asking for help against the Arabs: help that was not forthcoming. In order to subject Transoxiana completely, theArabs had to resort to diplomacy andmake useof the divisions andmutual hostility between thelocal sovereigns.
To appreciate thesituation in Transoxiana, we may refer to the fate of a noble magnate of Sughd, Dlvashtlch, sovereign ofPanjikent, who, for aperiod ofnot less than two years (parallel, apparently, with Ghurak) called himself "king of Sughd, sovereign of Samarkand". Thanks to Divashtich's archives, from his fortress onMount Mugh we now know how complex and ambiguous his position was. Onthe one hand hewas in correspondence with al-Jarrah, governor of Khurasan, calling himself the latter's client (mau/d), and with cAbd al-Rahman b. Subh, from whom he received instructions. He looked after the sons of the ikhshld Tarkhun, who hadbeen removed bythe Sogdians for submissiveness to the Arabs, and most probably received his title of "king of Sughd, sovereign of Samarkand" from the hands of the Arabs.
259



TRANSOXIANA
On the other hand, however, hesent a confidential agent to the khvatdv of Chach, the khaqan of the Turks and the king of Farghana, and carried onsome sort ofnegotiations with them behind the backs of the Arabs. In 722 he first took refuge from the Arabs inPenjikent, and then fled to the mountains, to a remote fortress. The troop that pursued him was led by al-Musayyib b. Bishr al-Riyahi, but along with himwere also the Transoxianan sovereigns - the Khwarazmshah Shaukar, son of Khamik, andGhuram, sovereign of Akharun andShuman (in the Hisar valley). On the orders of Sa'id al-Harashi, governor of Khurasan, Divashtlch was later crucified on a nd'us (tumulus).1
The sovereigns of Transoxiana still retained some independence (including theright to issue their own currency) down to the middle of the 8thcentury, andthe final conquest of the region by theArabs took place only in the last quarter of that century.

CHAPTER 7
THE IRANIAN SETTLEMENTS
TO THE EAST OF THE PAMIRS
Although it was in 1922 that Rostovtzeff said, "Weknow but little of
the history and archaeology of Central Asia and of the Iranian world",1 these words remain valid today. Nomadic tribes speaking languages of Iranian origin must have been wandering about Central Asia from a very early period, probably from the first half of the second millennium B.C., but wedo not know when they first began to settle in permanent villages. Isolated families may well have settled among foreigners from the earliest times. In the case of one Iranian settlement in Central Asia that attained great fame in the first millennium A.D., we have several versions of the circumstances attending its foundation. Butdespite theprominence of the Iranian inhabitants of Khotan in this period, we have no information concerning their arrival. According to theChinese andTibetan accounts, which there is no reason to distrust, at anyrate with regard to the broad outline of their accounts, the foundation of Khotan was effected by a compromise between exiled groups of Indians on the one hand and of Chinese on the other. All four of the accounts we have connect the Indian colonizing party with the sonand ministers of the emperor Asoka. This would place the foundation of Khotan firmly in the 3rd century B.C. The four accounts we have are found in two Chinese sources andin two Tibetan sources. Theearliest is theaccount given by the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Hsiian-tsang in his Hsi-yu-chi, dated to the 7th century A.D. With this the account in the Tibetan text known as the Gosrngavydkarana maybe contemporary. Later are the accounts in the "Life of Hsiian-tsang" by his pupils Hui-li and Yen-ts'ung and in the Tibetan "Prophecy of the Li Country". Thus, even the earliest ofthem can only reflect the tradition current in Khotan in the 7th century concerning events a thousand years earlier. When Hsiian-tsang wasin Khotan, the city was subservient to Chinese rule as it hadlately been to that of the western Turks. Indian influence was everywhere present, and he duly recorded the use in Khotan of an Indian type of script and thelarge number of monasteries and adherents of the Mahayana.

EAST OF THE PAMIRS
Nevertheless, there aresome indications of the early coexistence of Indians and Chinese in Khotan. From Yotqan, the ancient site of Khotan, we have a collection of coins from the first centuries A.D. bearing Chinese legends on the obverse and Indian Prakrit ones in the KharosthI script on the reverse. Prakrit wasindeed the administrative language ofthe nearby kingdom of Shan-shan in the 3rd century A.D., as weknow from thediscovery of KharosthI documents, mainly at Niya. One of these documents, no. 661, from Endere, has been frequently discussed because of its special linguistic and historical importance. It is dated in the regnal year "ofthe great king of Khotan, king of kings". Theking is named Vij'ida-simha, which corresponds with theroyal name Bijfaya Sihha in the Tibetan "Prophecy of the Li Country", written more than half a millennium later. More striking still is the fact that he bears the title hinajha "generalissimo", which T. Burrow was the first to explain correctly as the Iranian equivalent of the well-known Sanskrit senapati. We now have in fact in a Khotanese text the very word hlnaysay corresponding to Tibetan sde-dpon,which elsewhere translates Sanskrit senapati. Other traces of the influence of Khotanese have also been found on this document. The fact that the king's name is Sanskrit may indicate merely the preservation of a tradition handed down from an earlier period when theIndian colony provided the city's ruler. Hsiian-tsang states explicitly the contemporary belief that theroyal power hadbeen transmitted without interruption from thefoundation of Khotan. Buttheuseof a Khotanese word for the king's title andalso of the term ksuna "regnal period" ( = Khotanese ksund) implies an established connection between the Iranian inhabitants andthe royal power. Similarly, the use of Khotanese for royal rescripts in the 10thcentury makes it likely that the ruler of Khotan was a speaker of Iranian.
The name of Khotan is attested in a number of spellings, of which the oldest form is hvatana,in texts of approximately the7thto the 10th century A.D. written in an Iranian language itself called hvatana by the writers. The same name isattested also intwo closely related Iranian dialects, Sogdian and Tumshuq. The name need not be Iranian in origin, butit has theappearance of anIranian word with the common adjectival suffix -ana. Attempts have accordingly been made to explain it as Iranian, and this is of some importance historically. My own preference is for an explanation connecting it semantically with the name Saka, for the Iranian inhabitants of Khotan spoke a language
265



EAST OF THE PAMIRS
closely related to that used by the Sakas in the north-west of India
from the first century B.C. onwards.1 Another early name for Khotan is Gostana, transcribed by Hsiiantsang as Ch'ii-sa-tan-na, and attested in a Khotanese document inthe spellings Gaustama and Gamsta. A bilingual text gives Gaustana-desa as the Sanskrit equivalent of Hvanya ksira "land of Khotan". The origin of the name Gostana is unknown, but local legends show that go- was thought popularly to mean "cow" andstana- "breast". This implies a purely Sanskrit origin of the name. The connection with stana- "breast" has long been noted in the story of King Asoka's abandoned sonbeing kept alive by a breast that rose from the earth, whence his later name Sa-nu "Earth-breast" in Tibetan. Theconnection with go- "cow" canbe seen in the story of the two traders from Sa-nu's entourage pursuing a pregnant cow. This allusion was missed by early scholars because of the false reconstruction from Hsuantsang's Ch'ii-sa-tan-na of Kustana instead of Gostana.
Most of our knowledge of the political history of Khotan derives from Chinese sources. The relevant passages have been translated by A. Remusat, whocompiled the first western history of Khotan. Our sources begin when relations with China inthe first century B.C. become noticeable. In the Early HanAnnals Khotan is a relatively small state, but its progress to a position of power is described in the Later Han Annals. About the middle of the ist century A.D. king Yii-lin was attacked byand submitted to Hsien, king of So-chii (Yarkand). During the period A.D. 58-75, a general of Khotan called Hsiu-mo-pa revolted against Yarkand and made himself king of Khotan. After his death, the son of his elder brother, Kuang-te, having assumed power, destroyed Yarkand and made the kingdom powerful. Thirteen states as far as Shu-lo (Kashgar) came under the control of Khotan. There were then two great kingdoms east of the Pamirs: Khotan and Shan-shan.
During the last quarter of the ist century A.D., Chinese powerwas supreme throughout the Tarim basin thanks to the great Chinese general Pan Ch'ao, but during the 2nd century their power steadily declined. After a period of intermittent Chinese influence, Khotan could be described as "a pleasant and prosperous kingdom, with a numerous and flourishing population" by the Chinese pilgrim Fa-hsien, who

arrived in Khotan about A.D.400 on his wayto India in search of Buddhist scriptures. He went on to say: "The inhabitants all profess our Law, and join inits religious music fortheir enjoyment. The monks amount to several myriads, most of whom are students of the Mahayana."1
Despite its submission from time to time to various peoples, to the T'u-yii-hun inA.D. 445, to the Juan-juan c. A.D. 470, tothe Hephthalites c. A.D. 502-56 and to the western Turks c. A.D. 565-63 I , Khotan in the middle of the 7th century was evidently in much the same condition as it was when Fa-hsien was there, if we compare the account of Hsiian-tsang, who spent seven months or soinKhotan onhis way back to China. Khotan was a cultural and religious centre of considerable importance. Butbarbarian invasions caused distress. At a later date, an unknown Khotanese poet laments them thus: "There are Mamkuyas, Red Khocas and Hunas, Cimggas, Supiyas, who have harmed our Khotanese land."2 Here we have a reference to the Tibetans, the Huns, the Chinese and the Sum-pa. The Mamkuyas are not certainly identified.
It is as a consequence of the reassertion of Chinese power in the Tarim basin under the T'ang dynasty that we possess a considerable quantity of precise information concerning Khotan in the T'ang Annals. Here, for example, we are told that the family name of the ruling dynasty was Yu-ch'ih, a transcription of Khotanese Visa', represented also in Tibetan Biza andother spellings.
From the Chinese Annals we learn of the succession of kings of Khotan from A.D. 674 as follows:
1 Fu-she Hsiung A.D.674 2 Ching 691 3 Yii-ch'ih T'iao 725 4 [Yii-ch'ih] Fu-shih Chan 728 5 Fu-she Ta 736 6 Yii-ch'ih Kuei 740
7 Sheng 742-55 8 Shih-huYao 756-86
Several unsuccessful attempts have been made to explain these names as transcriptions or translations of the royal names given in the Tibetan "Prophecy of the Li Country". From about A.D. 759 onwards the Tibetans gradually overran Ho-hsi

and Lung-yu and cut off all communication between China and the protectorates of An-hsi (modern Turkestan; capital at ancient Kuca) and Pei-t'ing (protectorate whose seat was at Bisbali'q). In A.D. 848the Chinese imperial commissioner Chang I-ch'ao at Tun-huang revolted against the Tibetans and took I-chou (= Hami o t Qomul) and Hsichou. About A.D. 865P'u-ku Tsiin, qayan of the Uighurs (Hui-hu), in alliance nominally with the Chinese, drove outthe Tibetans andtook control of the whole north of what is modern Sin-kiang.
The 10th-century geography Hudud al-dlam tells us that "The king of Khotan lives in great state and calls himself 'Lord of the Turks and Tibetans'. He lives on the boundary of China and Tibet.'1 No such title has been found in the Khotanese documents, but it is probable that Khotan remained independent from the end of the 9th century until its conquest in A.D. 1005 bythe Muslim ruler Yusuf Qadir Khan. The presence of Turks within the kingdom of Khotan is reflected in the large number of Turkish titles and names found in Khotanese documents.
The long period of separation of Khotan from China caused by the Tibetan power meant that noembassies were sent to China, and hence there is less information from Chinese sources. The first embassy after this period was the one sent in A.D. 938 bythe Khotan ruler Li Shengt'ien, who hasbeen identified with Visa' Sambhava of the Khotanese documents. A sequence of kings from the Khotanese documents has been proposed as follows:2
A.D. 912-66 Visa' Sambhava 967-77? Visa' Sura 978-82? Visa'Dharma This sequence is not, however, reflected in theTibetan "Prophecy of the Li Country". There thelast rulers mentioned in the chronological part of the work are:
1 Bij'aya Sangrama 2 Bijaya Bikrama 3 Bijaya Dharma 4 Bij'aya Sambhaba 5 Bijaya Bohan Chen-po If Bij'aya Sangrama is in fact to be identified with Sheng (A.D. 742-5 5)
as has been recently suggested, this would place the composition of

EAST OF THE PAMIRS
the "Prophecy of the Li Country" before A.D. 912. This would agree with the date mentioned above (A.D. 865)for the end of Tibetan supremacy in Central Asia. If the dates proposed for theKhotan kings of the 10th centuryare correct, asthey appear tobe, the last years of Khotanese independence before theMuslim conquest will have been a great period of literary activity. From the reign of Visa' Sura we have theJatakastava, the Manjusrinairdtmyavatarasutraandsome Vajrayana verses.
Several other royal names previously known only from the Tibetan "Prophecy of the Li Country" are nowfound in Khotanese texts. Tibetan Bijaya Klrti appears as Vi£a' Kirtta, Visa' Kirtta; Bijaya Bikrama as Visya Vikrram; Bijaya Bohan Chen-po as Vasa' Vaham; Bijaya Sangrama as Sri-Vijitta Sagrama, SriVljatta Sagrauma. The local literature ofKhotan iswholly Buddhist but isnot confined to translations of Buddhist texts. A great variety of literature is avail
able, including documents of historical importance.1 The Khotanese manuscripts have for themost part come from theTun-huang library (see below), but finds have been made at a number of sites, mainly the meagre remains of former shrines and monasteries, within about a hundred miles to thenorth andto theeast of Khotan andat the old site of Khotan itself known as Yotqan. The location of such sites as Balawaste, Dandan-oilik, Domoko (Dumaqu), Khadalik, Kuduk Kol, Mazar Tagn, Mazar Toghrak and Sampula can be seen onmap 5, based
on the drawing ofM. A.Stein, who explored and excavated them.2 The influence of Khotan was no doubt strongly felt throughout this area at least until -A.D. IOOO.
North of the Yarkand river andsouth-west of Aqsu lie twosmall villages known as Maral-basi, formerly Barcuq, and Tumsuq. Their history is wholly unknown to literary sources. The name Tumsuq itself cannot be older than the 10thcentury when the Qarakhanids imposed Islam on thearea, as theword is Turkish, meaning "beak". But in Pelliot's estimation it was oneof the oldest Buddhist sites in Chinese Turkestan, its monastery dating from the end ofthe 4th century A.D. or the beginning of the 5 th. In the court of the building complex at the Toquz-saray site was found a manuscript containing the formulas for theceremony of ordination of monks. It is written in an Iranian language that is soclosely connected with Khotanese that the two must be regarded as different dialects of a single Saka language. Thus itis

clear that speakers of an Iranian language settled in Tumsuq, possibly as early asthe 4th century A.D. Six documents found in Maral-basi, one in Tumsuq and one in Murtuq arealso written in thesame language. They have been transcribed and translated by S. Konow. Murtuq is east even of Kuca and Qarashahr, andthe script certainly betrays the influence of Kucean. But it is convenient to label thelanguage Tumsuq since most of the documents come from that area, and all may ultimately have come from there. There are inaddition three large folios and one small one written in Tumsuq, which have notyetbeen translated. Two of these textsare documents concerned with buying and selling articles connected with wearing apparel. One is evidently part ofa religious text, probably the Aranemijdtakaknown to usin Tokharian. Even more widely scattered throughout Central Asia than the Sakas were theIranian-speaking people known as Sogdian. The oldest form of the name in thelanguage itself is attested in theSogdian "Ancient Letters" as swyhyk* Among other forms, we have Sog-dag ina Tibetan manuscript from Tun-huang, and the well-known forms SoySoi in Herodotus, Suguda in OldPersian and SuySa in Avestan. Although spoken over a wide area, thelanguage shows remarkable uniformity in the written material extant despite its use for both secular and religious purposes (Buddhist, Christian and Manichaean) andits
transmission in different scripts (Sogdian, Manichaean, Syriac).1 In a valley near Samarkand alanguage known as Yaghnobl, which continues a dialect of Sogdian different from any known to usin earlier sources, is still spoken at the present day.
The homeland of the Sogdians was, of course, the region of Samarkand, known to us nowin Sogdian itself in the adjective sm'rknhc "pertaining to Samarkand", found in documents from the Sogdian homeland. Most of our material comes, however, from further east, but theSogdians outside their homeland remained in contact with it, as the survival ofsome oftheir correspondence, the "Ancient Letters",
shows.2 Four of these letters were written in Tun-huang, Sogdian Arw'n, Ptolemy's Qpodva. As these letters canbe dated to the year A.D. 313, we know that there were Sogdians in Tun-huang, apparently in large numbers, before building began in A.D. 366 at the famous site of Ch'ien-fo-tung, the"Caves of the Thousand Buddhas", nine miles

south-west of the city. It wasamong the hundreds of cave-temples here that Aurel Stein in 1907 found a medieval library ofCentral Asian manuscripts. This library included among other things the largest proportion of extant Khotanese literature anda considerable amount of Sogdian, in particular the majority of the Buddhist Sogdian manuscripts. We know from the colophon ofone ofthese that it was written in Tun-huang. Tun-huang and Shou-ch'ang were sub-prefectures of Sha-chou. Although the name ofTun-huang has not sofarbeen traced in Khotanese documents, Sha-chou, spelled Sacu, is frequent. The roll known as "the Stael-Holstein Miscellany" was written in Sha-chou. We have a document written by envoys reporting to the court of Khotan on the situation in Sha-chou in the ioth century and one issued from the court of Khotan to thetteyi-hvdm (Khotanese title = Chinese ta-wang) in Sha-chou. The latter document provides the first reference in Khotanese sources to the final struggle of Khotan with Kashgar. It tells of an attack on Kashgar andthecapture of an elephant, among other things, from the Arab ruler. This must bethe elephant referred to in the Chinese account of a Buddhist priest who brought a letter in A.D. 971 from the king ofKhotan offering to send intribute a dancing elephant which hehad captured in a war against Kashgar.
A recent study ofthe colony ofAn-ch'eng, some five hundred metres east of Tun-huang town, showed that its three villages contained about 1,400 people, ofwhom a considerable number, to judge bytheir names, were likely to be Sogdian. After Tun-huang, themost famous place in Central Asia associated with Iranian-speakers isthe Turfan region. The name Turfan is known in Khotanese as Tturpamna and in Chinese as T'u-lu-fan. For the
history ofthe region, we have a sketch byS. Levi1 and the summaryof "an unpublished memoir" by Pelliot "on the history of the Turfan
region".2 Turfan has been made famous in modern times by the discovery made there bytheGerman Turfan expeditions (1902-14) of large numbers of manuscripts written in Iranian and other languages.
Most of the sites near Turfan yielded texts in Manichaean Middle Persian and Parthian as well as Sogdian. The site richest in texts was Qoco, modern Qara-qojo, a few miles east of Turfan. This was the principal city ofthe Turfan region down tothe end ofthe 14th century. The name of the city in Chinese sources is usually Kao-ch'ang or

Ho-chou. Itbegan as aChinese military colony in the ist century B.C.and was frequently theadministrative centre of the region. In accordance with its origin it is called in Sogdian in the Mahrndmag cyn'tickrihyy, literally "the Chinese town". In about A.D. 790 it was conquered by the Tibetans, andafter the fall of the Uighur empire in the Orkhon basin in A.D. 840-3, the Uighurs (Toquz Oghuz) made Qoco their southern capital. It has long been known from Arabic sources that these Toquz Oghuz were Manichaeans, and this is strikingly confirmed by the abundant writings in Manichaean script found there. A Chinese traveller of the 10th century A.D. reported Buddhist temples of T'ang date aswell astemples belonging tothe Manichaeans and others, either Zoroastrians or Nestorians. From a Christian monastery near the hamlet of Bulayi'q (probably Khotanese Phalayaka), north of Turfan, come a considerable number of Christian Sogdian texts, written in theSyriac script. Yarqoto, a short distance west of Turfan, became the centre of administration of Hsi-chou "the Western District" after the T'ang conquest of Qoco in A.D. 640. Hsi-chou is known to Khotanese texts as Secu, Sicu. Among thetexts found at Yarqoto areSogdian transla
tions of parts of the Suvarnaprabhdsottamasutra and the Mahdparinirvdnasiitra.
Middle Persian or Parthian and Sogdian manuscripts have also been found in three small places all near Qoco, namely Murtuq, Sangim and Toyuq. Toyuq was recognized in Khotanese Ttiyaki andin Chinese Ting-ku. In a large ruined monastery in picturesque Toyuq, von LeCoq found a half-destroyed library containing "the remainsof Manichaean, Christian and Buddhist MSS., together with Chinese scrolls, Hephthalite fragments, and fragments in Kokturkish runes. Ten Iranian fragments in Manichaean script survive from Tuyoq,
together with oneNew Persian fragment in Syriac script."1
The T'ang Annals describe the Sogdians as follows: "They are accustomed to write in horizontal lines. They excel in commerceand love profit; as soon as a man is twenty years old, he goes offintothe neighbouring kingdoms; they have gone wherever it is possible to make a profit. Thetwelfth month is for them the beginning of the year. They follow the Buddhist religion; they offer sacrifice to the god
of heaven."2 This is a succinct description of their essential charac

teristics. They established colonies in many places in Central Asia and went far into China, engaging especially in the*silk trade. As for their calendar, it is well known that a number of works in the Chinese Tripitaka contain transcriptions of the Sogdian names of the planets. To their devotion to Buddhism and Zoroastrianism could be added that to Manichaeism. The Manichaean script, a variant of the Palmyrene, became a symbol of adherence to Manichaeism and was used by scribes writing in Parthian, Middle Persian, Sogdian, Bactrian, Uighur and Kucean. Chinese sources provide evidence of Sogdian colonies in I-chou (Hami or Qomul) and in the region south of Lob Nor. We are told that there were "merchant Hu" (Sogdians) in I-chou during the Sui dynasty (A.D. 589-618). In A.D. 630, the chief of Hami, Shih Wan-nien (Shih is a Sogdian surname associated with Tashkent), submitted to the Chinese with seven cities, probably those south of Lob Nor. It is known that four of these were constructed in the period A.D. 627-49 by Sogdians under a great notable of Samarkand called K'ang Yen-tien.
One of the Sogdian "Ancient Letters", the second, dated to A.D. 313, tells of the destruction in A.D. 311 by the Hsiung-nu of the Chinese capital Lo-yang, Sogdian Sry. Incidentally it mentions the presence of Indians and Sogdians there. When the Uighurs sacked Lo-yang in A.D. 762, they remained there for several months during which their chief was converted to Manichaeism, which had been introduced at the Chinese court by a man from Persia in A.D. 694. When he departed in A.D. 763 he took with him four Manichaean monks to Ordu Baliq, the Uighur capital from A.D. 744-840. These events were commemorated in a trilingual inscription - Chinese, Turkish and Sogdian - set up by the Uighur qayan Ai tangrida qut bulmis alp Bilga (A.D. 808-21) at the site of Karabalgasun on the left bank of the Orkhon river.
A detailed account of the fortunes of the Sogdians in the Ordos region has been reconstructed from Chinese sources by E. G. Pulleyblank. Sogdians lived in considerable numbers at the court of the qayan of the northern Turks in present-day Mongolia. The people resented the favour shown to the Sogdians by Hsieh-li, the last qayan of the first empire, who was captured by the Chinese in A.D. 630. The Chinese settled the captured Turks, including Sogdians, in "protected" prefectures. In A.D. 679 there were established Six Hu Prefectures in the southern part of the Ordos region. Five of the leaders of the Hu of the Six Prefectures who revolted from the Chinese in A.D. 721 had

Sogdian names. K'ang Tai-pin was executed in A.D. 721, andwhen his son was defeated in the following year, many of the Sogdians were moved into prefectures in several provinces. There were, however, many Sogdians in the armies of An Lu-shan, who headed the great rebellion in the middle of the 8th century which nearly overthrew the T'ang dynasty. An Lu-shan's father was a Sogdian and his mother a Turk. Hisname is probably a transcription of Sogdian rwxsn- "shining, bright". TheSogdian colonists finally left theOrdos region in A.D.786 when they were moved to theregion of Shuo Chou andYiin Chou. We know of the presence of Sogdians in the4thcentury A.D. at three of the cities ontheroute from Sha-chou to Ch'ang-an and in Ch'ang-an itself from the Sogdian "Ancient Letters". Leaving Sha-chou one comes first to Su-chou, found in Khotanese as Sauha-cu, earlier known as Chiu-ch'uan, in which Henning saw Sogdian cyrhsn>"n. Thesecond Sogdian "Ancient Letter" is dated in the thirteenth year of the ruler of cyrhsw"n. Thenext place, Kan-chou, is not found in Sogdian but is mentioned frequently as Kamacu in 10th-century Khotanese documents. Then we have Liang-chou, earlier Ku-tsang, Sogdian kc'n. Sogdian "Ancient Letter" v, dated to A.D. 313, was written in kc'n, which is also mentioned in"Letter11.Inthe 4th century Ku-tsang was an important town andthe residence of the governor of the province of Liang. Chinese sources tell us that merchants of Su-t'e (Sogdiana) used togo in great numbers to the province of Liang, but that on the capture of Ku-tsang (A.D. 439) they were alltaken prisoner. One other identifiable place on this route is mentioned in the second Sogdian "Ancient Letter", namely kmzyn, identified as Chin-ch'eng. It is probable that Sogdians resided there, but no further evidence is available.
R. Gauthiot was the first to recognize a Sogdian reference to Ch'ang-an, the T'ang capital, modern Hsi-an. According toits colophon, one of the Buddhist texts found in Tun-huang was actually written "in thecity of Xumdan". Ch'ang-an was known also to theKhotanese
as Humadam. Henning found two references to Ch'ang-an as yxwmfn in the second Sogdian "Ancient Letter". The Iranians brought not only Manichaeism to China but also Nestorian Christianity. In A.D. 1625 there came to light the famous Nestorian monument ofHsi-an, written in Chinese and Syriac and dated in the year A.D. 781. It tells the early history of Christianity in China from the time of its introduction by a Persian monk named A-lo-pen> who came to Ch'ang-an in A.D. 635. Below the Chinese inscription is
274



EAST OF THE PAMIRS
a list ot priests and monks including at least twowith Iranian names. A certain Gabriel is described in Syriac as "priest andarchdeaconand head of the church of Xumdan (kmcPri) and Sarag (fry)". Saray, it will be recalled, is found in the Sogdian "Ancient Letters" as the name of Lo-yang. The furthest east to which Iranians penetrated of which we have record is Chen-chiang, about 140miles from the mouth of the river Yang-tzu. Marco Polo's notice of Christian churches at Chen-chiang has been confirmed by a fairly detailed account in a Chinese work of the 14th century. A certain Mar-Sargis, whose family came from Samarqand, founded six churches in Chen-chiang and one in Hangchou in the second half of the 13th century A.D. The remarkable diffusion of Iranians throughout Central Asia and into China wasclearly dueto twocauses: their love of trade andtheir desire to propagate their ownreligion.






PART II
NUMISMATICS



Much of Iranian history in the Parthian and Sasanian periods, particularly for eastern kingdoms and marginal dynasties, is based on numismatic evidence; separate treatment of this evidence has therefore been deemed helpful. The coins of eastern Iranian kingdoms and the kingdoms of Transoxiana, however, have already been examined in the chapters on their political history, since numismatic material forms the chief basis for those accounts. Chapters 8a on Parthian coins and 8b on the minor states in southern Iran present an essentially sequential treatment of the subject, while Chapter 9 discusses Sasanian coins chiefly in terms of their types, aspects and significance. Editor.



CHAPTER 8 (a)
PARTHIAN COINS
At the time ofthe Parthian uprising in 238 B.C.,1 the currency circulating in northern Iran wassimilar to that of the rest of the Seleucid empire. However, the mints of Bactra andHecatompylos were already tending to cater for a preference for the drachm in their area, whereas at Ecbatana this denomination wasscarcely issued between the reigns of
Antiochus I and III, the emphasis being on the tetradrachm instead.2 The weight standard employed derived from the Attic system so that in the 3rd century B.C.the drachm weighed about 4 grammes. The regular obverse for this Seleucid coinage was the royal head, bound with the diadem and facing right, while a common reverse motif depicted Apollo seated left on the omphalos andholding a bow. The majority of the earliest Parthian issues nowextant come from a
hoard unearthed in theAtrak valley west of Bujnurd.3 It containedone tetradrachm andabout 1500 drachms, thelatest non-Parthian specimen being struck for Diodotus of Bactria; accordingly, a possible occasion for the deposition was theeastern expedition of Antiochus III who set out from Ecbatana in 209 B.C. The most worn, and hence the first Parthian group shows on theobverse a beardless head facing rightand wearing a diadem-bound bashlyk',the reverse portrays an archer in steppe dress, seated left on a stool and holding a bow(pi. 1 (1)). It is no surprise to find that they follow Hellenistic prototypes relatively closely in fabric and design, but there are some unusual features.
In particular, the reverse inscription - APSAKOY AYTOKPATOPOS, "[thecoin] of Arsaces, autocrat", is unprecedented at this time although thetitle does appear later notonly on Parthian issues butalso in Syria and amongst the Greeks of north-west India. In Seleucid
protocol, it implied "elected general",4 an apt enough description of the position of Arsaces I, to whom we mayattribute the group. The bashlyk, too, while typically nomadic, wasalso a satrapal head-dress in

the Achaemenian period; its diadem binding was retained byall subsequent Parthian princes fortheir numismatic portraits. The archer of the reverse remained thesubstantive type forallParthian drachms down to theendof the dynasty, and is often supposed to represent Arsaces I as well, although parallels with thetypes of Achaemenian satrapal coinages have been pertinently drawn.1 In weight these early issues set a pattern forthe future, for, in common with later drachms, few of them fall outside the limits 3.5to 4.2 grammes. Their fabric is peculiar to the plateau of Iran, the obverse being slightly convex and the reverse more markedly concave. Although these coins arehandstruck, thecraftsmen tried to keep theaxes of the two dies parallel. Such a practice may have been borrowed from the Bactra mint where reversed alignment (i.e. at 1800) was almost obligatory.2 The artistic milieu in which the engravers worked was, asa whole, less obviously Iranian than it had been under the Achaemenians.
The subsequent drachms ofArsaces I, again from the hoard, demonstrate his attempts to individualize the coinage ofhis nascent state.To start with, the obverse head isturned left (pi. 1 (2)) and then the archer is seated right. Atthe same time, part of the Greek legend is replaced by anAramaic word which may bekrny (see App. 2,p. 317) - this is perhaps cognate with the family name Karen but in Achaemenian usage it was theequivalent of arparrjyos3 and therefore close to our assumed meaning for "autocrat". A monogram is inserted underthe stool. In Seleucid mints such symbols were associated with specific controllers, being transferred with them from one location to another. However, this particular monogram (see App. 2,p. 316) appears later in the series and may be related to Mithradadkart, the citadel of Nisa,4 perhaps named after some Mithradates of the Achaemenian family.
The long reign postulated here for the first king ofthe dynasty leaves no room forTiridates, a brother mentioned bysome classical authors; accordingly it is assumed that Arsaces I was succeeded about 211 B.C. or a little earlier by his son ofthe same name,5 whose drachms were the latest inthe Bujnurd hoard. These have anobverse similar tothat used by his father - beardless head in bashlyk facing left - but onthe reverse the inscription is reduced to the simple APSAKOT, whilethe

monogram is abandoned for the symbols " A " or an eagle (pi. i (3)); these may signify different mints. A worn bronze coin of Arsaces II is known, having a bow-case on the reverse; its original weight must have been about 5 grammes, sothat it circulated as two chalkoi, where eight chalkoi equalled oneobol, a sixth of a drachm. (This sixfold division has persisted tothe present day with the dang.) After Antiochus had brought Parthia within the Seleucid orbit once more, it is probable that the coinage just discussed was deliberately suppressed, thus accounting for its extreme rarity until the discovery inthe Atrak valley. As a result ofthe downfall ofAntiochus at Magnesia, c. 190 B.C., the Greek bonds on Parthia were again loosened and an independent currency became feasible. Mithradates I, whoascended the throne c. 171 B.C., was largely responsible for the political expansion ofParthia and so most recent studies are in agreement that the coins now to be described were struck bythis prince.1 Tobegin with they have onthe obverse the beardless head inbashlyk copied from previous issues, but this is then replaced bya similarly attired bust - busts had been introduced on Bactrian silver from about 190B.C.; for the reverse, the archer is seated onthe Apollonian omphalos, not a stool. The inscription augments from the plain APSAKOT, through APSAKOT BASIAEtiS (pi.1 (4)) to BASIAE&S MErAAOT APSAKOT " o f the great king Arsaces" (pi. 1(5)), in response nodoubt to territorial acquisitions and increased imperial pretensions. TheGreek writers commented with some dismay on the continued useof the dynastic name rather than a more personal one. Indeed this custom was perpetuated until theadvent of the Sasanians andhasbeen oneof the biggest impediments to an elucidation of the Parthian series. The beardless head, a Hellenistic convention deriving inIran from Alexander the Great, was hereafter generally avoided onParthian coins, nor does the bashlyk reappear. Tojudge from reverse die similarities,the immediately succeeding coinage ofMithradates was struck at the same mint, perhaps Hecatompylos, ashis first issues. The obverse bust now has a long beard and is diademed only (pi. 1(6)); the denominations include drachms and obols in silver aswell asbronzes.
Ecbatana only fell to theArsacid in thereign of Alexander Bala, c. 148 B.C.,2 but having once captured this important mint, Mithradates

forthwith availed himself of its facilities. Copious issues of bronze coins were struck. These have a right-facing obverse bust and suchuncompromisingly Greek reverses as the galloping Dioscuri as well as indigenous ones like an elephant (pi. i (8)). Denominations range from octochalkoi to thesingle unit. A few drachms (pi. i (7)) and obols (pi. 1 (9)) resembling the bronze inhaving irregular die axes were also coined.1 Finally, c. 140 B.C., Parthian forces occupied Mesopotamia with its celebrated city of Seleucia onthe Tigris. Here again, Mithradates' issues stem directly from those of the monarchs just ejected, having a right-facing obverse portrait. On their reverse the drachms carry Zeus enthroned and the tetradrachms Herakles standing (pi. 1 (11, 10)). The latter, the first Arsacid coins of this denomination, should weigh upwards of16 grammes, but are often very much less in practice. They have the expanded legend BASIAEOS MErAAOT AP2AK0Y OIAEAAHNOS, " O f the great king Arsaces, philhellene", the last epithet being a somewhat transparent attempt to placate theGreek commercial element in the newly conquered lands. Many specimens bear the dates FOP and AOP - 173 and 174 in the Seleucid reckoning (commencing in October 312 B.C.) and so corresponding to 140/139 and 139/138 B.C. Itdoes not seem that, in general, the Arsacids used the Nisan New Year inconjunction with Seleucid era dating.2 Apart from a fewpossible exceptions, Parthian tetradrachms were issued from Seleucia only, while drachms hardly circulated there atall, being struck almost entirely atmints inIran proper.3
As a corollary to theestablishment of Arsacid control of Mesopotamia, the smaller states ofCharacene, Elymais and Persis were also forced to acknowledge Parthian suzerainty. Theearliest coins of Phraates II, the young son of Mithradates, seem to come from the mint of Susa in Elymais; thetetradrachms in particular (with a reverse design of Apollo onomphalos) follow closely the style of the issues of Kamnaskires, the local dynast.4 The bulk of Phraates' output consists ofdrachms, obols and bronzes from Iran. The obverse portrait is only lightly bearded andthe "archer" reverse carries theinscription BASIAEQS MEFAAOT APSAKOY 0EOIIATOPO2, "Of the great king Arsaces, of divine descent", thelast title referring toa deification of Mithradates. An innovation is the presence on the

drachms ofmint names such as NI (Nisa) (pi. i (13)), TAM (Tambrax), APEIA or STAS(?) among others. No doubt in line with Seleucid custom, the chief mint of Ecbatana dispensed with these insignia; one drachm, perhaps struck in this city, substitutes OIA0IIAT0P02, "loving his father", for GEOIIATOPOS (pi. 1 (12)). Towards 130 B.C. Antiochus VIIled an invasion of Mesopotamia, but thiswas eventually defeated and anissue of characteristically Greek style from Seleucia (pi. 1(14)) saluted Phraates' victory. These coins used to be attributed toa favourite ofPhraates, Himerus, who seized power after his protector's death, but this identification has now been abandoned
on numismatic grounds.1 During the next decade, a westward-thrusting nomad influxwas deflected by the Parthian armies down through Slstan and thence into the Indus valley. Unhappily, in the fighting two monarchs were lost, Phraates II in 128 B.C.andArtabanus I, hisuncle, four years later. Taking advantage ofthis Arsacid preoccupation with the eastern fron
tier, Hyspaosines, prince of Characene, over-ran Mesopotamia2 and, in something of a quandary as to whom they should recognize,the Seleucia mint authorities temporized by striking tetradrachms (pi. 1 (15)) with theeffigy of the long-dead Mithradates I. (Such a subtle response to anuncertain situation had been employed at Antioch not
many years earlier.)3 At the same time Artabanus' substantive issueof drachms andbronze was coming from theIranian mints, probably Ecbatana (pi. 2 (2)), Rhagae and Margiane. The obverse bust is distinctive for its hairstyle of concentric waves, while the legend BASIAEQS MErAAOT APSAKOT OIAAAEAOOT, "Ofthe great king Arsaces, loving his brother", alludes to Mithradates I, the king's elder brother, although a few examples (pi. 2 (1)) use the reverse dies of Phraates' drachms. Parthian jurisdiction having been re-established in Seleucia, wegeta series of tetradrachms (pi. 2 (3)) some of which bear the date HIIP (equivalent to 125/4 B.C). These are commonly regarded as amongst the most superior examples of Parthian numismatic art. One drachm has the letters EKP in the reverse exergue - they have been plausibly interpreted as the date 125 of the Arsacid era
and thus corresponding to 124 B.C.4

work ofMithradates II, son ofArtabanus, and some ofthe new king's earliest coins (pi. 2 (5)) were in fact frequently overstruck on bronze
issues of the invader.1 The youngest portrait of Mithradates is found on a series of tetradrachms (pi. 2(4)) - the last to have a right-facing bust-with the inscription BASIAEQS MErAAOY AP2AK0T EIIKDAN0Y2, "Ofthe great king Arsaces, (god) manifest", peculiar to the reign, but here setin four vertical lines, as onthe coins of his predecessors. With the first major group of Mithradates II (including tetradrachms, pi. 2 (6), drachms, pi. 2 (7, 8), triobols and bronze) the portrait is always turned left, while the royal name and titles are arranged in a square. Many of the drachms carry monograms atvarious points in the field (cf. pi. 2 (7)), butit is not normally possible to associate these with specific mints. The epithet SiiTHPOS "deliverer", appears on a few drachms (pi. 2(9)) and isappropriate to Mithradates'

liquidation of the nomad menace. The same denomination continues with a series on which the archer's omphalos seat gives way toa throne and heholds both a bow and anarrow. Cuneiform tablets *tell us that about 109 B.C. Mithradates assumed thetitle "king of kings", an enhanced dignity reflected in the new inscription BASIAEQS BASIAEiiN MErAAOT APZAKOY EIIKDAN0Y2, " O fthe great king of kings, Arsaces, (god) manifest" (pi. 2 (10)). Later thenow aged monarch is depicted wearing a pearl-embroidered tiara of a style widely imitated by later princes, not only inParthia but elsewhere (pi. 2(12)). Previous to this the bronze issues from Susa had had their own distinctive types (pi. 2(11)), but now they become assimilated to those of the northern mints, especially Ecbatana. However, Susa still retained thesystem of altering the reverse designs annually, an administrative convenience that helps ustocalculate within limits the lengths oftenure ofpower of successive monarchs at Susa.2 The Susa coins imply that Mithradates had been supplanted thereby some other king perhaps as early as 94B.C., although he is last mentioned by classical authors inthe context ofevents in 88 B.C. Certainly, civil conflict may have caused the legend ofMithradates' latest drachms (pi. 3 (1)) to be altered to BASIAEHS BASIAEQN APSAKOY AIKAIOY EYEPrETOY KAI OIAEAAHN, " O fthe king of kings, Arsaces, the just, the beneficent and philhellene", manifestly aimed at ranging the Greeks ofParthia amongst his supporters and used onone of the Avroman parchments, also dated 88 B.C.3
For the next thirty years or so, the attributions in the Arsacid series become unusually contentious, andit will be seen from the chronological table (pp. 98-9) that only partial agreement between successive investigators has ever been achieved. Accordingly, those proposed here can beregarded as nomore than provisional.
The original interpretation of a sequence of cuneiform tablets 4 has recently been modified5 so that it appears that in Babylonia in 90 B . C , a ruler called Gotarzes (I)was expelled byanother named Orodes (I); the latter was in turn forced to give way to some further prince in 80 B.C. Arecent study ofthe die-engraver sequence has now led me to a different order forthe issues ofthis Parthian "dark age" from that put forward by Wroth, an order which I hadpreviously accepted.6 This

new arrangement has theadditional advantage of conforming rather
better toavailable suitably detailed hoard evidence,1 and yet it can still be reconciled with the annual design change postulated by Le Rider for the Susa bronzes. Coming immediately after the issues ofMithradates II is a groupof
drachms and bronze which I allocate2 to Gotarzes I (pi. 3(2)). They show a monarch wearing a new tiara ornamented onthe crest with a row ofrecumbent stags orsome other cervines, with orwithout horns perhaps according to the season rather than the engraver's whim; on its side ahorn replaces the star of Mithradates' tiara. The reverse legend runs BASIAEtiS MErAAOT APSAKOY 0EOIIATOPOS (or 0EOIIATPOY inerror) NIKAT0P02, "Ofthe great king, Arsaces, of divine descent, victorious''. In the Near East at this juncture,the claim tobe "king ofkings " was ceded by the Arsacids toTigranes the Great of Armenia - hence therestricted titulature of Gotarzes' coins.
We next come to Orodes I, whose portrait is adorned with a tiara similar to that of Mithradates II, while theinscription on hisissues reads BASIAEQS MErAAOT APSAKOT ATTOKPATOPOS OIAOnATOPOS EniOANOTS OIAEAAHNOE, "Of the great king, Arsaces, autocrat, loving his father, (god) manifest, philhellene". The fourth word may refer to Orodes' position as leader ofthe military forces which overcame Gotarzes' usurpation, butthe fifth can hardly imply anyaffection for Mithradates who wasstill alive in 88 B.C., although incontrol merely ofKurdistan. Towards the end ofhis reign Orodes recommenced the issue of tetradrachms (pi. 3(3)) and triobols in addition to the usual drachms (pi. 3(4)) and bronze - a few of the drachms (pi. 3(5)) have a fleur de lys onthe side ofthe tiara. Atabout this time, petty rulers such as Otanes began countermarking Parthian issues circulating in eastern Iran with their own small punches (pi. 3 (6)). The throne now passed to a prince of whose personal name we are ignorant. Both large (pi. 3(8)) and small silver (pi. 3(9)) were struck throughout his reign. Onthe obverse we see a diademed bust with a new type of hair style which conceals the ears; the legend is BASIAEtiS MErAAOT AP2AK0T ©E0IIAT0P02 ETEPrETOT EIII<DAN0T2 OlAEAAHNOE, "Of the great king, Arsaces, of divine

descent, the beneficent, (god) manifest, philhellene" - the lasttwo words are omitted onthe drachms but a few rare specimens of this denomination carry mint names demonstrating that the issuer's sway extended from Rhagae, through Nisa and Areia (pi. 3(10)) to Margiane; the enigmatic addition KATA STPATEIA(pl. 3 (11)) seems to signify the peripatetic mint attached to the court.1 A tablet2 with a slightly anomalous reading, of75 B.C., may indicate a brief interruption ofthe reign of the first unknown king bythat ofa further one who struck tetradrachms (pi. 3 (7)) resembling the later coins of Mithradates IIbut having an inscription BA2IAEHS MErAAOT APSAKOY EIIIOANOYS OIAEAAHNOS EYEPrETOY, " O f the great king, Arsaces, (god) manifest, philhellene, the beneficent". Itwill be remembered that Mithradates adopted the wider pretension to be"king of kings", not just "great king" well before his assumption ofthe tiara; any error in this respect would surely have been fatal lese majeste for the mint controller.
The nomads beyond the border ofKhurasan yet again played a role in Arsacid history, the next monarch, Sinatruces, having been assisted to the throne by their efforts. Already an octogenarian at his installation, he appears tohave reigned for about seven years until c, 70 B.C. Admittedly, themodified interpretation of the Susa issues adopted here only permits him a rule of two or three years in that city and, indeed, his reign perhaps overlaps that of the Unknown King mentioned above, but the current fragmented state ofthe Arsacid empire, already obvious before thedeath of Mithradates II, is sufficient explanation for this discrepancy. Sinatruces' tetradrachms (pi. 4 (1)), which have only recently been discovered,3 and drachms (pi. 3(12)), depict him in a tiara decorated on the side with a fleur delys, and having a row of pellets onstalks around the crest; with the smaller silver we also find behind the royal bust an "anchor", often thought to pertain to the Seleucids but also among the insignia of a deity atSusa.4 The legend runs BASIAEQS MErAAOY APSAKOY EYEPrETOY EIIKDANOYS OIAEAAHNOS, " O f the great king Arsaces, the beneficent, (god) manifest, philhellene". Many of the drachms have been struck from dies on which the distinctive "anchor", crest pellets

and even the fleur de lys were erased. Such an official action may be the result ofpolitical uncertainty and has repeated parallels inthe Parthian series.1 The mints' dilemma isaccounted forwhen we consider the succeeding coinage (pi. 4 (4)). This is novel in that onthe reverse is normally placed one ofa series ofmonograms which persisted down to the end of the Arsacid epoch while theobverse depicts a bare-headed, shortbearded monarch. Now Sinatruces was eventually followed by his son who employed thesame titulature on his coins which are discussed below and so the prince here in question must be some usurper,
possibly Darius ofMedia Atropatene, a client ofTigranes.2 Obviously, Sinatruces' dies could not bemodified to the new designs and sothey were altered to resemble those of some earlier unexceptionable monarch such as Orodes I (cf. pi. 3 (5)). Let us now turn tothe monograms (see App. 2, p. 316). Their introduction seems tohave been inspired by the complete mint names met with on thecoins of the unknown prince contemporary with Sinatruces. The most common ofthem is £ , with
a later form A ; NewelPs ascription3 to the chief Median city of Ecbatana (or Agmatana), the modern Hamadan, is surely correct. When we see that it can beresolved into A + F o r A + F +Twe havea clue to the interpretation of some ofthe others. Thus rf breaks down to P+ F, probably Rhagae as shown by engraver links with the named
drachms of a few years previously. Similarly I believe that 'T1, which contains M+0 +T, represents Mithradadkart, the citadel of Nisa; indeed there are many engraver links with drachms carrying the monogram (or rather letters) NI, which must beNisa itself. Drachms with the monogram Efare extensively die-linked with others bearing £ or rf or ^ . Since it can be resolved into 2 4-T +Pfor the substantive part of KATA STPATEIA, our earlier theory that wehave herethe travelling mint attached to the court is confirmed; such an institution would clearly uselocal facilities where available. Most of the other symbols or letters can, in the same way, beassociated with towns of importance in the Parthian empire.

OIAEAAHNOS " O fthe great king, Arsaces, loving his father, the beneficent, (god)manifest, philhellene". A few associated tetradrachms portray the prince ina tiara with a horn onthe side (pi. 4(3)). A rare issue of drachms (pi. 4 (2)) and bronze is probably also to be attributed to thesame ruler; thefacing head on them is a delightful example of the frontality socharacteristic of Parthian art; their legend alters (DIAOIIATOPOE to 0EOIIATOPOS, "of divine descent".1
At length, Phraates III,son of Sinatruces, gained control of the minting areas of the empire. The initial tenuousness of his hold is no doubt the explanation of Pompey's contemptuous refusal to accede to the Arsacid's claim to be recognized once more as "king of kings". Phraates' coins have the same titles as those of his father but they are differently disposed about the seated archer andon the obverse his effigy is bare-headed; they comprise tetradrachms, drachms (pi. 4 (5)), diobols and bronze. At this time thecoinage from Susa ceases for a decade or so. For his final issue (pi. 4 (7)), Phraates assumed the tiara originally worn by Gotarzes I, with the row of stags around the crest; on the tetradrachms hemade anexplicit claim to divinity byinserting ©EOT (the god) in the legend (pi. 4 (6)).
The parricides Mithradates III andOrodes II, having disposed of their father, Phraates, c. 57 B.C., soon clashed over the succession. Initially Mithradates seems to have been paramount and so we shall deal with his issues asa whole. Their portrait iswithout head-gear and a distinctive feature isthe segmented necklet worn inplace ofthe usual spiral torque. On the reverse we read BASIAEfiS MErAAOY AP2AK0Y AIKAIOT EIIKDANOYE 0EOT EYIIAT0P02 KAI OIAEAAHNOS "Of the great king, Arsaces, the just, (god) manifest, well-born of the god, andphilhellene" (pi. 4 (8)), which waslater expanded to begin BASIAEQS BASIAEfiN, perhaps as counterpropaganda to thesame title of "king of kings" found on Orodes' coins. All Mithradates' known tetradrachms, which were inscribed with the personal name MI0PAAATOY, have been overstruck by Orodes with his own dies.2 On the drachms, irregular inscriptions starting with BASIAEONTOS (implying perhaps the status of subking) emphasize official perplexity andin one case themint went to the extreme of circumspection with the poorly engraved YIOY OPAATOY, "son of Phraates" (pi. 4 (9)).3

Orodes II commenced his coinage with drachms (pi. 4 (10)) and bronze featuring Nike crowning the obverse bust, doubtless a reference to the initial defeat and subsequent death of Mithradates. The inscription, BAZIAEnS BASIAEQN APSAKOY OIA0IIAT0P02 AIKAIOY EIIKDANOYS OIAEAAHNO2 "Of the king of kings, loving his father, the just, (god) manifest, philhellene", with its professed regard for his father, is even more hypocritical than the one used by his brother. Such scant heed for veracity was common enough in the power politics ofthe Hellenistic age but itis sad to find nomadic virtues abandoned forGreek vices. On later issues (pi. 4 (11)) Nike is
omitted or erased from the die.1 Surprisingly there is no overt reference in Parthian numismatics to the overwhelming victory of Carrhae, but some rare tetradrachms (pi. 5(1)), ascribed to this period on stylistic grounds and reading BA2IAEQS BASIAEQN AP2AK0Y KAI KTISTOY "Ofthe king of kings andfounder, Arsaces", have an appropriate titulature - Orodes wastruly the refounder of Arsacid fortunes after years of Armenian domination. More compelling evidence for the altered circumstances of commerce in Parthia is the commonness, even today, of the drachms of Orodes; they exist in thousands andmust have been struck in millions (pi. 4 (12), pi. 5 (2, 3, 5)). The royal features became increasingly gross as thereign proceeded, showing some attempt still at a true portrait, while, at the very end, adegree of idealization is apparent. Later coins of all denominations, tetradrachms (pi. 5 (4)), drachms, triobols, diobols, obols and bronze, introduce a wart onthe king's brow, anattribute which came to have the significance ofa guarantee ofArsacid blood for succeeding
monarchs.2 Religious motives have been adduced to explain the presence on the drachms ofa star and crescent, but although they may have meant that Orodes was brother of the sun and moon it is more likely that the addition of such symbols was encouraged asa bureaucratic convenience.

drachms never deteriorating quite so far as the drachms. Under Orodes the drachms from further east suffered a continual metal debasement.1 Obols from the rf mint have anabbreviated inscription incorporating the personal name YPtiAOT (pi. 5(6)), showing that the then current Greek equivalent of the Iranian was "Hyrodes". On the drachms and fractions, thestandard "archer" reverse is retained butwith the tetradrachms we meet designs such as the king enthroned, Tyche standing or kneeling before him; abbreviations of the month dates occasionally appear in the field. Finally, for thebronze it is possible that the reverse type was changed annually; inaddition to the Seleucid inheritance of horses and bow-cases, we meet more exotic types, such as a fortress.
Orodes' eldest son, Pacorus I, was appointed to lead aninvasion of Syria and Asia Minor, although true command rested with the renegade Labienus. Perhaps because ofthe influence ofhis nominal subordinate, Pacorus is depicted in the Roman fashion, short-haired and beardless, on his rare drachms (pi. 5 (7))andbronze. In celebration of initial success, Pacorus caused a Nike tobe placed behind his head. However, he shortly perished ina Roman ambush, throwing open the questionof the succession.
This uncertainty was fatal to Orodes. The next son, Phraates IV, safeguarded his own position by stifling the old king and then slaughtering his brothers and their families. Such domestic commotion does not seem tohave affected the economic situation inParthia, since the mints poured outtheir products at thesame level as under Orodes in Iran and in even greater volume in Mesopotamia. While all Phraates' coinage depicts him with a wart on hisbrow, there arenatural differences between the denominations. The tetradrachms (pi. 6(1)) have a variety of reverse designs similar to those of Orodes and since they mostly bear month and year dates we learn that some types were being struck simultaneously for more than adecade. The drachm effigy, easily distinguished by theappearance at the same time of the wart and a segmented necklet, usually has an eagle behind it and this is later supplemented bya star and crescent (pi. 5(8, 9, 10, 11), pi. 6(2)). For the contemporary Susa issues thesilver content almost vanishes. The flans of Phraates' bronze coins become so small as tobe barely adequate to receive the impression of the dies and after this reign few of them carry any inscription at all.

The Romans, intent on recovering the prestige lost at Carrhae, renewed hostilities against Phraates, but Antony and his legions nearly came to the same end as Crassus. A more serious threat was provided by Roman support fora pretender, Tiridates, who struck a few tetradrachms (pi. 5 (12)) at Seleucia in 26 B.C.; on the reverse we read BA2IAEQE BASIAEtiN APSAKOY ETEPrETOY AYTOKPATOP OIA0P0MAI0 EniOANOYS OIAEAAHNOZ "Of the king of kings, Arsaces, the beneficent, autocrat, Romanophile, (god) manifest, philhellene", anadvertisement forhis collaborators. In spite of general unpopularity, Phraates survived these attacks, overstriking captured tetradrachms ofboth Antony and Tiridates with his own dies (pi. 6 (i)).1 The dates on Tiridates' coins permit inferences to be drawn about calendrical usages in Parthia. The sequence of the MacedonianSeleucid .months runs Dios (roughly equivalent to October), Apellaios, Audynaios, Peritios, Dystros, Xandikos, Artemisios, Daisios, Panemos, Loos, Gorpiaios, Hyperberetaios and, when necessary, an intercalary Embolimos. The three months of Tiridates' tetradrachms are Xandikos, Artemisios and Daisios, a compact continuous group. It has been suggested that the Arsacids commenced their year with Artemisios (corresponding to the Babylonian month Nisan). We see that this would entail a nine-months gapbetween Daisios andXandikos, inherently less probable. Similar sequences supporting a Dios start to the year occur elsewhere in the Parthian tetradrachm series.
Augustus realized the futility of force and more diplomatically recovered the lost legionary "eagles" by anexchange ofgifts. Phraates received a slave-girl, Musa, with whose charms hebecame sobesotted that he effectively disinherited his older offspring and settled the succession on herson, Phraataces. Such unwonted generosity gained its due reward when Phraates was despatched bythis pair about 2B.C. The classical world was farmore shocked bythe subsequent marriage between Phraataces and Musa. Thecoins of the new king can be separated from those of his father by thepresence of a flying Nike crowning the obverse bust, which also lacks the forehead wart and,on the drachms, byhis wearing the usual spiral torque. For the Ecbatana silver (pi. 6 (3)) and also for some of the tetradrachms wesee a Nike both before and behind the royal effigy. After Phraataces' union with

Musa, the queen's portrait forms the reverse type and the normal drachm inscription is 0EAC OYPANIAC MOTCHC BACIAICCHC "[the coin] of the goddess Urania Musa, Queen" (pi. 6(4, 5)).
Indifferent as it mayhave been to matrimonial eccentricity,1 the Parthian nobility was always watchful of its feudal interests and apparently believing that these were nowbeing infringed, deposed Phraataces and Musa. Intheir stead was elected Orodes III, who struck a few tetradrachms ofthe standard type (pi. 6(6)), dated A.D. 6.It was, of course, axiomatic that a candidate put forward by one faction would be unacceptable to others; stigmatized with the almost hackneyed charge of "cruelty", Orodes was assassinated. The Romans were then requested tonominate as king one ofthe sons ofPhraates IV, who had been living exiled in Italy. Eventually Vonones I arrived. His upbringing is revealed by thedrachm portraits (pi. 6 (8)), which have a short Roman hair style. Vonones further flouted Parthian numismatic tradition by putting his name - BACIAETC ONQNHC - on the obverse, while the reverse, instead of carrying the time-hallowed archer, depicts Nike surrounded by the inscription BACIAEYC ONHNHC NEIKHCAC APTABANON, "king Vonones, conqueror of Artabanos". Similar types were employed for the tetradrachms (pi. 6 (7), often overstruck onspecimens of earlier reigns. The Artabanus whose defeat is commemorated by these unconventional designs was an Arsacid through his mother and ruled in Media Atropatene. The western habits acquired by Vonones soon disgusted his supporters and Artabanus' second revolt swept Vonones from Parthia.
The successful rebel dissociated himself from occidental aberrations by adopting the nomadic long hair style forhis portrait onall denominations (pi. 6 (9)). Apparently aggrieved bythe attitude of the Greeks of his empire, Artabanus also pointedly omitted any reference to his friendship for them on his later tetradrachms which read BASIAEtiS BA2IAEQN ETEPrETOY AP2AK0Y, " O f the king of kings, Arsaces, the beneficent". The corresponding reverse design depicts the enthroned king with a suppliant kneeling before him, a motif repeated on the base metal "drachms" from Susa (pi. 6(12)). Towards the end of his reign, the tetradrachms (pi. 6 (10)) give us a frontal view of Arabanus, possibly recalling his Atropatenean origin. Numerous

insurrections disrupted Artabanus' rule inMesopotamia and inthe face of these he would withdraw to theParthian heartland. Here affairs were more stable and commerce prospered, a deduction drawn from the vast drachm issues (pi. 6 (n)) ofArtabanus' final years. This group has thesame square bearded profile bust as thecoinage from Susa,
dated A.D. 28,1 while the associated bron2es exist inalmost bewildering variety - examples of reverse designs include a bust of the queen, an amphora and a pomegranate - and a resumption of annual types may
be possible (pi. 7(i)).2 In spite ofthe Arsacid domination ofMesopotamia since the days of Mithradates I, Seleucia had been permitted theprivilege of its own bronze coinage. These issues, struck fortwo centuries, usually carry a representation of the Tyche of the city (pi. 7 (2)) and range in weight
from 20grammes3 to less than one gramme. With the anti-Hellenic attitude ofArtabanus IIand his successors, it isno surprise that henceforth (except during periods ofovert rebellion) the royal bust is always the main feature on Seleucia bronze, Tyche being relegated to a subordinate place. Most are dated andoneseries hasbeen used to
postulate a Nisan start for the Arsacid year;4 the numismatic reasoning is impeccable butextrapolation to the whole of the Parthian coinage seems unwarranted, the tetradrachms indicating the contrary.
Seleucia was inrevolt before the death ofArtabanus, c. A.D. 38, and the coins of his son, Vardanes I,only begin in A.D. 42. The tetradrachms are ofstandard designs, the obverse portrait carrying a forehead wart. On the drachms (pi. 7 (3)), this disfigurement is represented by three thin lines. Itis probable that atthis time Arsacid control over both Susa and Khurasan was slackened, since the last Parthian drachms attributable to these areas are those ofVardanes. Further, from about 80 B.C. minor kings in eastern Iran had countermarked Parthian drachms for circulation in their own territory; to increment the supply, imitations of official Arsacid coins were fabricated especially for countermarking; again, the drachms of Vardanes are the last to be so copied
(pi- ? (4)). From the start of his reign, Vardanes was opposed bybisbrother Gotarzes II and their tetradrachms overlap indate. On this denomination Gotarzes isdepicted with a lock ofhair on his forehead (pi. 7 (5)), while his drachms (pi. 7(6)) much resemble those of his father, Arta

(Note the confusion in theuseof the nominative andgenitive cases), (pi. 7 (7)). The murder of Vardanes in A.D. 45 didnot free Gotarzes from competition and in Iran hemay soon afterwards have been superseded by Vonones II, another monarch from Atropatene, whose full face portrait ondrachms (pi. 7(8)) and bronze wears a tiara like that ofDarius (pi. 4(3)). Vonones probably never really controlled Mesopotamia, since the issues ofGotarzes from Seleucia end inA.D.51 and are followed after only a few month's gap by the tetradrachms of Vologases I, thought tobeanother son ofArtabanusII.
In typical Arsacid fashion, Vologases faced filial revolt, his son Vardanes II issuing both drachms (pi. 7 (10)) and tetradrachms (pi. 7 (9)) between A.D. 5 6 and 5 8. Inthe end Vologases I regained power and his later coinage (pi. 7 (11)) hasdates running from A.D. 60 to 78. During this period the drachms provide evidence ofthe abandonment of Greek asthe official language of the plateau. Their inscription has become so formalized as to be barely recognizable, and hence, when Vologases required to differentiate his issues from those ofa rival,he placed theParthian letters wl(see Appendix 2) on the obverse (pi. 7 (12)), occasionally substituting the Arsacid family symbol 9 (pi. 7 (13)).
In Iran proper this rival was Pacorus II, the identity ofwhose beardless portrait (pi. 8 (3)) is assured because some drachms carry pkin Parthian. However, at Seleucia the mint next struck bronze and tetradrachms (pi. 8 (1)) for Vologases II. Onthe silver wemeet two changes. Firstly thepersonal name OAArACOY replaces EYEPrE
TOY on thereverse. Secondly, a sequence letter (from A to E)2 is placed onthe obverse. On alldenominations Vologases wears a tiara ornamented with "hooks" and the drachms have the additional Parthian wl (pi. 8(2)). Dated tetradrachms show a continuous conflict for twoyears between Pacorus andVologases, concluded with the disappearance of Vologases. Into the latter's shoes stepped Artabanus III, for whom we know tetradrachms carrying his personal name (pi. 8 (4)). Theresemblance of this denomination to the issues of Artabanus II has enabled usalso to attribute to Artabanus IIIa series

of drachms (pi. 8(5)) distinguished from those ofhis namesake by the
idiosyncrasies ofthe later die engraver.l Artabanus III held out for less than a year, A.D. 80, in Mesopotamia, after which Pacorus II recommenced minting tetradrachms (pi. 8(6)) that present us with one ofthe few examples ofirony in numismatics. Tyche offering a diadem to theenthroned monarch is the standard reverse type of later Arsacid tetradrachms, but Artabanus III had introduced a variation by showing her holding an untied diadem (cf. pi. 8 (4)). As just mentioned, Artabanus IIprovided the prototypes for the coinage ofArtabanus III and somay have been related tohim. Now the latest ofthe tetradrachms ofArtabanus II(cf. pi. 6(10)) have the king on horseback, not enthroned. Inmocking commentary, therefore, Pacorus is depicted on horseback, receiving a normal diadem from Tyche and an untied diadem from a male figure, presumably the defeated Artabanus. Both thetetradrachms and theparallel drachms (pi. 8 (7)) depict the issuer with a close-cropped beard. For his final coinage, running up to A.D.96, Pacorus adopted thetiara worn by Vologases II (pi. 8(8)), even recutting some ofhis rival's dies forhis
own use.2 For the next twenty-five years no tetradrachms were struck at Seleucia and the evident slackening oftrade there may coincide with a clash of arms over the succession. However, some bronze from Seleucia, beginning in A.D. 105/6, and a plentiful supply of drachms
from the plateau are tobeattributed to a new prince, Vologases III.3 The bare-headed bust of the drachms (pi. 8 (9)) was replaced atSeleucia in A.D. I I O / I I I byone wearing a tiara and this bust is used onVologases Ill's tetradrachms which run from A.D. 122 to 146 (pi. 9(1)). His main rival was Osroes I whose portrait is distinctive forthe bunched hair-style later characteristic ofthe Sasanians (pi. 8(10)). For upwards of two decades, A.D. 109 to 129, these monarchs, turn and turn about, ruled in Seleucia, from whose mint their dated coins emanated,but Osroes has no tetradrachms and so, finally, he may have been subject to Vologases.
From the western viewpoint, such political ferment merely formed a convenient background to Trajan's expedition. One result of this was the investiture inMesopotamia ofa satellite king, Parthamaspates, son of Osroes I. Only drachms (pi. 8(11)) and bronze have been allocated
to this young prince,4 and they must come from Iran, but it ispossible

that he maintained himself there until translated to another throne by Hadrian. The drachms (pi. 8 (12)) of a further interloper, Mithradates IV, indicate clearly how far theplateau had now (c. A.D. 140) drifted from Greek cultural hegemony, since on the reverse we read mtrdt MLKy "king Mithradates" in Parthian (see App. 2). Minor diadem differences separate theobverse portrait of both this and anotherunnamed usurper (pi. 9 (2)) from that of Vologases III.1 In both major parts of the empire, the next reign was that of Vologases IV, whose dated tetradrachms (pi. 9(3)) span without a break the years A.D. 147 to 191. During this time thespelling of the personal name changed from OAArACOT to OAOrACOT andthe flan size became increasingly too small totake the full die impression so that the exergual month date is often missing. Parthian script continued to be used on the drachms (pi. 9 (4))which read wlgsy MLK\ For both denominations the obverse bust wears a tiara with a neckflap. It is often supposed that the sack of Seleucia and Ctesiphon by the Romans under the nominal leadership of Verus must have wrought havoc with the economic life ofParthia but there isno numismatic evidence to support this view. Coins from allparts of the reign are equally common. However, towards its end, c. 190 B.C., Vologases appears to have been supplanted inIran by Osroes II; the latter is known only from his drachms which areof a hard linear style andon which the Parthian script has been tentatively interpreted as hwsrw MLK7 (pi. 9 (j)).2 These exist in much greater numbers than do thedrachms (pi. 9 (8)) of the next king, Vologases V,whose Seleucia issues (pi. 9(7)) include a few tetradrachms also with the facing bust (pi. 9 (6)); they date from A.D. 191 to207/8. Arsacid support for the unsuccessful Pescennius Niger drew the destructive wrath of Severus and his legions upon Mesopotamia. Whatever the immediate effect, the coinage ofVologases VI, the next prince, is profuse enough to indicate thriving trade. The tetradrachms (pi. 9 (9)) begin in A.D. 207/8 andendwith an isolated issue in A.D. 227/8. The drachms are now very far from Greek prototypes, and often foreshadow theartistry so evident on early Sasanian issues. Thebent neckflap seen on oneor two drachms (pi. 9 (10)) testifies to the pliable and non-protective nature of the tiara, often described asa helmet. The contemptible Caracalla attempted to embroil Vologases VI with

his brother Artabanus IV1 and it may be as a result that Artabanus struck a group of drachms (pi. 9 (11)) and bronze contemporary with the issues of Vologases, an obvious enough declaration of independence. The obverse bust has aforked beard2 and behind the head on the drachms is V (Ar), while the reverse reads 9rtbnwMLK\(The former attribution to a putative Artavasdes is no longer tenable.)3 A "mule", obverse Vologases, reverse Artabanus, establishes the synchronism of the issues. Some rare coins of Artabanus (pi. 9 (12)) have a new tiara decorated on the side with a star and were perhaps struck inanswer to the challenge of Ardashir, the first Sasanian prince, whose tiara is similarly ornamented. In fact, while Artabanus perished in battle, Vologases may have escaped temporarily from captivity4 toberesponsible forthe tetradrachm ofA.D. 227/8, the last Parthian coin.

CHAPTER
MINOR STATES IN SOUTHERN IRAN
The student of Iranian history may well question the necessity for this detailed treatment of the numismatics of the smaller states existing in the shadow of the Arsacid empire. For Parthia itself, although we have numerous enough references in the Greek and Roman authors, yet the coins are of great help in establishing the broad outline of political events. When we turn to the minor dynasties of Persis, Elymais and Characene, other sources fail us almost completely and we have to rely on the relevant coinage not only for the very names of the kings, but even for epigraphical data and evidence of artistic trends. Indeed, attempts to reconcile the unquestionable facts presented by the coins with the fragmentary and often dubious testimony from elsewhere usually raise more problems than they solve.
PERSIS
Of the three kingdoms mentioned above, Persis, the modern province of Fars, was the least accessible geographically to invasion from either Mesopotamia or northern Iran. It had once been the cradle of the Achaemenian race and the imperial traditions were never forgotten even after the shock of Alexander's occupation. A few tetradrachms and drachms were struck at Persepolis by Seleucus I, but Hellenistic supremacy, which can never have extended far beyond the main lines of communication, soon lapsed in the area. The advantages of a standard currency as opposed to bullion were obvious enough, though, and so local rulers continued to maintain a mint when the Greeks were gone.
The date of this departure is quite uncertain. It may well have been in the reign of Antiochus I (280-261 B.C.), since even the early Seleucids were chiefly concerned with protecting the trade route to Bactria and further Asia, a route running through Media. Equally imprecise is the period of issue and, indeed, the identity of the first coinage of Persis. The tetradrachms, drachms (pi. 10 (1)) and fractions attributed to Bagadat are generally regarded as initiating the series. Being significantly different in types and fabric from the rest of the early Persid

coinage, they either precede or succeed it and on stylistic grounds they seem closest to those struck by the Seleucid kings. Their date we shall consider later. The obverse head, with its short beard, faces right and wears the satrapal bash/yk, familiar from Achaemenian issues and bound with the diadem; the chin-strap is taken up over the forehead. On the reverse the king is enthroned left, holding a long sceptre and a flower; this scene is almost identical with the famous representation of Darius at Persepolis, and if, as seems probable, the coinage was struck here, the engraver would have had his model readily to hand. In any case, such an overt reference to the former dynasty proclaims Bagadat's independence from the usurping foreigners. Returning to the reverse design, we find a tasselled "standard" planted before the king, while around is
the Aramaic inscription bgdtprtrk9 zy 9/hyn (see App. 2, p. 317). The vowels in the royal name being, of course, omitted in this script, they have to be inferred from contemporary Creek transliterations or similar

sources, and "Bagadat" is only a probable expansion. Prataraka, a title associated with some official position, is known from the Elephantine parchments, but has not been fully explained.1 Zy alahia "of the gods" has a later parallel in the protocol of the Sasanian dynasty.2
The metrology of the coinage derived, as did that of the Parthians, from the Attic system employed by the Seleucids and was based on the silver drachm of about four grammes. The inaccuracy inherent in handstriking techniques makes it difficult to be sure of the intended value of some of the smaller fractions, but they certainly included the obol and the triobol (or hemidrachm). The introduction of unwonted decimal divisions such as the fifth of a drachm, proposed by some scholars,3 seems hardly warranted. Neither now nor later do we find gold or copper issues in the Persid series. If gold were required at all, the coins remaining in circulation from the Achaemenid or Seleucid epochs probably sufficed. The absence of base metal denominations emphasizes the restriction of the use of currency to the upper classes; such trade as there was amongst the mass of the population was no doubt carried on by barter, while silver only passed through its hands in the way of taxes. A similar situation is found in medieval Europe, whose feudal system Iran anticipated in so many other respects.
We next come to a prince whose issues read whwbr^ prtrk? zy ylhyy " Oborzos, prataraka, of the gods ", the Greek form of his name being Oborzos, as we learn from an undatable reference.4 They comprise the same range of denominations - tetradrachms (pi. 10 (2)) to obols - as those of Bagadat, but their fabric is markedly different, being excessively concave on the reverse and correspondingly convex on the obverse. The reason for such an unusual shape is not clear. On some Byzantine coins it seems to have been adopted to permit easy distinction between issues of varying weights, but here it may be connected with the source of the blanks. Many of the tetradrachms (pi. 10 (4)) of this and subsequent reigns are overstruck on the posthumously minted silver of Alexander the Great, traces of the undertypes remaining; the force required to distort the blanks would ensure more effective effacement of the original designs. The obverse carries the royal head wearing the bashlyk still, but now the chin-strap partly covers the mouth and is

perhaps intended in this position to prevent the king's breath from
defiling the flame honouring Ahura Mazda.1 Arepresentation of Oborzos in hiscapacity as chief priest is engraved on thereverse dies.He stands, hand raised in adoration, before a temple surmounted by three fires (for the priests, the soldiers and the peasants?). The "standard" is set up onthe other side of the temple. The same scene also occurson some ofthe coins ofBagadat, and there isyet another link betweenhis issues andthose of Oborzos; this is theuse of a further unexplained word, bgkrt (?), and//v/(?) respectively, in thereverse legend; these
may bethe names of their fathers.2
Striking coins of the same fabric and designs and probably succeeding Oborzos were hrthctr (Artaxerxes I) and wtprdt (Autophradates I) (pi. 10 (3-6)). On some ofthese, a winged figure ofAhura Mazda floats above thetemple; again, hiseffigy stems directly from thePersepolis reliefs. At the same time, Greek influence is attested bythe Nike who stands behind the priest-king, holding a wreath over his head. A small hoard containing single tetradrachms of Seleucus Iand Bagadat, with eight ofAutophradates I, is our sole external indication
of the date of all the coins so far discussed.3 On grounds of style, design and fabric we may postulate issue during the3rd century B.C.; and further, since Antiochus IIIwas apparently as successful in Persis as hehad been in Parthia, we may assume that this first Persid coinage also ceased about 205 B.C. Itscommencement (with Bagadat?) is more difficult to establish, but the four reigns involved perhaps extended over
several decades sothat 250 B.C. is possible but bynomeans proven.4
The coins so far described correspond with the slow rebirth of Iranian independence from the regime imposed by the Diadochi, Seleucus I andAntiochus I in particular. In language andscript, the local population and their scribes ostentatiously preserved anislandof Achaemenian-based culture ina shallow sea ofimperfectly appreciated Hellenism. Continuity with thepast was confirmed by thechoice of such evocative royal names as Artaxerxes. Stakhr, the chief city of Persis and sited only a few kilometres from the recently ravaged palaces of Persepolis, was,as we have said, likely to be the mint responsible for thestriking of these issues andremained so whatever

the vicissitudes to which the ruling dynasty was subjected. The great blocks of squared masonry, quarried from nearby outcrops in the Zagros and so characteristic of the architecture of Cyrus and his successors, continued to be employed in Persid buildings; these are familiar from their numismatic representations and from traces we can still observe on the ground. Their stern grandeur contrasts strongly with the impermanent mud-brick structures typical of Mesopotamia under Seleucid and, later on, Parthian influence. Indeed, reaction to external pressure sometimes took more violent forms. The prince of the "Oborzos" coins may also have been the instigator of a massacre of the local Macedonian garrison, although, such was the fratricidal bent of the occupying forces, he perhaps only assisted one faction against another. Contemporary glimpses of political affairs in Persis are otherwise completely lacking.
There is now a gap in the issues of Persis corresponding to that in the Arsacid series anterior to Mithradates I, and doubtless the Seleucid princes supplied the currency for the whole area once more. The Roman victory at Magnesia spelt freedom for Iran, and autonomous minting was perhaps resumed soon after 190 B.C. The next group from Persis represents a break with the previous classes in respect both of style and fabric. No longer scyphate, the coins are now relatively dumpy and flat on both sides. The obverse bust wears a completely new style of bashlyk, resembling the Macedonian kausia, but with a flap at the back and an eagle on top. On early examples (pi. 10 (8)) the style is charmingly naturalistic and the relief is high. The reverse is similar to that used for the coins of Autophradates I, a battlemented temple, with Ahura Mazda above, the king at the left and a standard serving as a perch for a bird at the right. The denominations range from the tetradrachm (for the last time) (pi. 10(7)) to the obol and almost all are anepigraphic. One drachm (pi. 10 (9)), however, carries the
Aramaic sykndt, a name not known hitherto, but acceptably Iranian.1 As the issue progressed the delicacy of style decreased while an additional crescent was affixed to the bashlyk flap.
The next reign belongs to Darius I. His coinage of drachms (pi. 10 (10)) and fractions, continues the general pattern just described, but with a few. modifications of the bashlyk decorations. On the reverse

word. The assumption of kingship seems to coincide with theinitial use of the equivalent BASIAEQS on the coins of theArsacid Mithradates I, the first occasion for which anyParthian influence on the affairs of Persis can be postulated. Such influence becomes more obvious with the portraits ofthe
succeeding prince, Autophradates II {wtprdt MLKy), who is depicted with the same bare head (pi. 10 (ii)) that we see onthe later issuesof Mithradates I, although a crescent is precariously and incongruously attached above the diadem. This crescent, borrowed from the kausiaof Darius I, came to be thesymbol of the monarchs of Persis and often reappeared. By now the Arsacids had overrun Mesopotamia and were about to occupy Persis as well. Local coinage apparently ceased in approximately 140 B.C., and the later very common drachms of Mithradates II must have formed thecurrency of the area until this king found himself in difficulties towards theendof his reign. About this time thegrandiose Arsacid title " king of kings" was relinquished to Tigranes of Armenia, and theresumption of striking by therulers of Persis, c. 90 B.C., maybe just one manifestation of more complete freedom. Nevertheless, Parthian numismatic conventions werenow paramount.
On his coins, thenext prince, Darius II,faces left and wears a tiara reminiscent ofthat introduced by Mithradates II,decorated onthe side with a crescent; on more carefully engraved dies his flowing hair is seen to be covered at theneck by delicately fashioned metal plates, a foretaste of the superior craftsmanship in the armourer's trade that would supply the Sasanian cavalry's elegant protection (pi. 10(12)). For the reverse type, the king stands, sword in hand, before a firealtar; around him is ranged the square, Parthian-style, inscription d'ryw MLK' BRH wtprdt; thethird word, meaning "his son", heralds the definitive adoption of heterographic Aramaic writing, and it may well be that Darius was thesonof that Autophradates of the period before Mithradates II.
It will be recalled that, after thelatter's death, there is, on Arsacid issues, a new hair fashion which conceals theear; such an innovation we find duplicated onthose ofOxathres, Darius' son, where the legend
runs whwhstr MLKy BRH d'ryw MLKy (pi. 11 (1)). One or two of these drachms have a monogram behind the obverse head, a practice fol
lowed much more regularly by his brother Artaxerxes II (^rthstr MLK9 BRH d'ryw MLK')(pi. 11 (2)).This monarch wears a battlemented

crown, derived perhaps from the form of the altar or temple employed earlier and certainly a seminal contribution to the iconography of the Sasanian dynasty. Many of the drachms of Artaxerxes have been struck on thin flans made by beating out flat existing coins. Overstriking is, of course, prevalent in the Parthian series and its occurrence in Persis may portend a further diminution of Arsacid control, even though the king in question was a contemporary of those powerful princes Orodes II and Phraates IV. Again, however, the fabric points towards the one so typical of the thin Sasanian issues.
With the coins of the following king, Namupat, the inscription nmwp9t MLK9 BRH 9rth "Namupat, the king, son of Artaxerxes" takes up a circular outline more conformable to the shape of the flans, although in other respects they derive obviously enough from preceding issues. Some fractions of the drachm carry an unusual reverse design which has been interpreted as a conventional representation of the diadem (pi. 11 (3)). Here we have yet another demonstration, if such were needed, of the esteem accorded to this symbol of royalty in Iran.
From Namupat to the advent of Ardashir I it is increasingly difficulr to draw analogies between the issues of Persis and those of other states where some chronological framework can be established. Accordingly, we can only deduce the sequence of monarchs from stylistic - and therefore to some extent, subjective - considerations, but we are helped by evidence of kinship recorded in the coin legends. The immediate successors of Namupat include Pacorus (pkwr MLK9 BRH whwh) (pi. 11 (4)) and Kapat {kp9t MLK9 BRH nmwpt) (pi. n (5)); probably these are the sons of the two kings, Namupat and Oxathres, reigning earlier. The name Kapat is no doubt merely another form of Kavad, who appears in the Sasanian king-list. We then come to yet further departures in types, where the reverse depicts a smaller royal head, assumed to be that of the father of the issuer, himself portrayed in grander fashion on the other side. Thus Artaxerxes III (^rthstr MLK9) (pi. 11 (6)) is coupled with Mithra {mtry MLK9) who is diademed and, additionally, radiate (implying posthumous deification?). Equally Manuchihr {mnctry MLK9) has a forebear sharing his name (pi. 11 (7)); a second Manuchihr seems indicated by a change of portrait (pi. 11 (8)). The next prince, Artaxerxes IV (V/Af/ MLK9), is son of a Manuchihr and he has an elaborate coiffure, prefiguring the creations of the Sasanian hairdressers (pi. 11 (9)); in fact, the following issues were struck for Ardashir, first prince of the dynasty of Sasan.

After the period of Parthian expansion, the kingdom of Persis had become submerged in a loosely organized system often owing merely nominal allegiance to the Arsacids. The internal struggles for power which sooften laid the Parthian empire open to invasion bytheRomans had little direct effect on Persis itself; this lack of contact with the Mediterranean world has unfortunately curtailed our knowledge of most aspects of Persid history. Later writers continually emphasize the antipathy of the Sasanians to anything deriving from the Parthians. Such anattitude is understandable in Ardashir, buteven hehad to build his nascent state on Arsacid foundations with thehelp of other leading Iranian families, themselves sympathetic to and often promoted by the Arsacids. However, we find no alteration with ensuing generations, so it may be that the Parthians exercised a harsher and more arbitrary control over their sub-kings than we realize; maladroit in permitting the success of Ardashir it must have been. Familiar as he thus was with the inefficiency of the Parthian administration in its latter days, Ardashir greatly extended the scope of centralized authority, andin this he maywell have drawn on the experience of his predecessors in Persis itself.
ELYMAIS
The ancient state of Elam had always maintained diplomatic and cultural relations with the successive dynasties ruling in Mesopotamia. Then, as now, the road through Ahvaz traversed Elymais and constituted one of the main arteries of trade, linking the head of the Persian Gulf with the plateau of Iran. Originally only mountain brigands, the people of Elymais had, long before Alexander's incursion, descended to the plain of the Ab-i-Diz, where they effectively practised the agriculture learnt from their western neighbours; at the same time, worship of their goddess Nanaia prompted them to the construction andupkeep of increasingly imposing temple complexes, especially at Susa, which although it often pretended to autonomy, falls within the geographical confines of Elymais,
Apart from unexceptionable initiatives such as the installation of a mint at Susa, the earlier Seleucid monarchs were careful of offending local susceptibilities. This sensitivity waslacking in their descendants. Antiochus III,for long thegreatest prince of the Hellenistic world,had lost most of his power to the Romans after the battle of Magnesia,

c. 190 B.C. ; whilst trying to restore his finances by plundering the shrine of Nanaia, he perished at the hands of the Elymaeans two years later. His death and the subsequent internecine struggles of the Greeks, severely curtailed Seleucid influence in the whole area east of Mesopotamia and relaxed the pressure on the local Elymaean kinglets, giving one of them, Hyknapses, an opportunity to assert himself about 162 B.C, when he issued a bronze coinage. This is entirely Hellenistic in style with a beardless head radiate on the obverse and Apollo set in a Greek legend BASIAEiiS TKNATOY "of the king Hyknapses" on the reverse.1 Evidently this rebellion was short-lived, and only after that ineffectual usurper, Alexander Balas, was forced to withdraw from the province, c. 147 B.C., do we find another separatist gesture. This was much more positive, since its author, Kamnaskires I, struck not only bronze, but also silver tetradrachms (pi. 11 (10, 11)), although these again follow Seleucid prototypes.2
Once more Elymaean aspirations were crushed, this time by the Parthian hegemony, established initially under Mithradates I, c. 140 B.C. The Arsacid monarchs, in their turn, found continuous occupation by no means easy, and another local ruler, Tigraios, was able to strike a base-metal coinage for about six years from 138 B.C.3It was at this juncture that the Seleucid Demetrius II enlisted Elymaean assistance in his fruitless efforts to counter Arsacid expansionism. Thereafter, the Parthians continued with an almost unbroken series of bronze or silver issues from the Susa mint down to about A.D. 45. It seems that at some periods, as ingeniously deduced by Le Rider, the reverse designs were altered annually, a bureaucratic convenience that enables chronological limits to be suggested for some reigns.4
By now Susa itself had become so imbued with Greek ideas that it was scarcely suitable as a residence for Elymaean kings. In the aftermath of the reign of Mithradates II, when Parthia was eclipsed by Armenia, autonomous issues of Elymais were struck elsewhere, probably at Seleucia on the Hedyphon. Still clearly influenced by earlier designs, such as those of Demetrius and Laodice, these coins carry on the obverse the jugate busts of Kamnaskires II and his consort, Anzaze, while behind their heads is an anchor-like symbol (pi. 11 (12)). The latter resembles one of the dynastic insignia of the Seleucids, but is also

associated with a deity from Susa.1 On the reverse ofthis series, which includes silver denominations running from the tetradrachm to the obol, we meet Zeus Nikephoros, with an inscription BA2IAEQS KAMNASKIPOT KAI BASIAISSHS ANZAZHS "of the king Kamnaskires andthe queen Anzaze" andas subsidiary features, the Seleucid date AAS (82-81 B.C.) with the magistrate's (?) name MAKEAON. In line with Parthian precedents, the contemporary rulers of Elymais appear all to have adopted the throne-name Kamnaskires. Thenext monarch has a more conventional coinage with a single obverse bust and on the reverse the legend BASIAEQS KAMNA2KIP0Y TOY E r BAEIAEflS KAMNASKIPOY "of the king Kamnaskires and the king Kamnaskires"; the precise implication of the fourth word has not been elucidated. A drachm (pi. 12(1))of this general type, dated 65-64 B.C., has a horse protome replacing the"anchor" on the
obverse.2 Here, thesymbolism of the Elymaean issues seems to have inspired the Arsacid mints to adopt similar practices, especially during the reigns of Orodes II and PhraatesIV. Under the same two monarchs, theParthian mint at Susa instituted a wholesale debasement ofthe silver drachm strikings; this affected the Kamnaskirid series which, from the tetradrachms downwards, dwindled into a mere token bronze coinage (pi. 12 (3)). Lack of die-cutting skill no doubt contributed to the displacement of the relatively complex figure of Zeus on thereverse by a simple head of a deity (or former ruler?). The inscription, too, became utterly meaningless, andeventually, at thestart of the 1st century A.D., the complete reversewas reduced to a field of randomly disseminated dashes. Such a paucity of Greek at themint striking these issues confirms the view that it must have been somewhere other than Susa, for here at this time quite respectable Greek poetry was being composed and edicts in thesame
language were being cut correctly enough in stone.3 Although several princes must have been responsible for the coins just discussed, the slow descent into incoherence is sounbroken that attempts to provide attributions can only be nugatory. The last Parthian coins from Susa are assigned to Vardanes I, c. A.D. 45, a date giving us a convenient terminus post quern for a new
Elymaean series.4 Judging bythe names used, the line of Kamnaskires

was now superseded by a junior branch of the Arsacids. The two denominations struck correspond in weight to tetradrachms (14 grammes) and drachms (3.5 grammes) but they continued to be of base metal. While the larger of these carry only an Aramaic legend, some of the drachms bear an inscription in poorly engraved and often retrograde Greek. Le Rider has made the illuminating suggestion that the former were struck at Seleucia on the Hedyphon and were intended to circulate in Elymais proper, whereas the latter perhaps emanated from Susa itself.1
The obverses naturally continue to depict the royal bust, sometimes turned to the left and on others, facing. A tiara of the form introduced by Mithradates II is often worn and its decorations include either a crescent or an "anchor" - this same symbol is frequently placed in the field, too. The hair and beard styles adopted are unusual, not to say exotic. Reverses vary considerably; many retain the irregular set of dashes, but others have more significant designs such as a head of Artemis, together with appropriate inscriptions, for example IIPAATHC BACIAEYC "of the king Phraates" or khnhkyr ivnvd MLKy BRYnrn>d " Kamnaskires-Orodes the king, son of Orodes" in a heterographic derivative of Aramaic (see App. 2, p. 317). The accepted sequence of these princes is Orodes I (pi. 12 (4)), Kamnaskires-Orodes II (pi. 12 (9-11)), Phraates (pi. 12 (5-8)) and Chosroes. The latter is often assumed to be that Osroes who was the Arsacid opponent of Trajan, and certainly the portraits on the two series of coins are sufficiently close to argue in favour of the theory. By accepting it we bring the coinage of Elymais up to c. A.D. 120.
The succeeding issues consist of "drachms" only, their weight occasionally dropping below two grammes. Stylistically they resemble the ones we have just considered, and although many are anepigraphic (pi. 12 (13, 14)) others bear the obverse legend wrwd MLK\ One type also carries wlp'n accompanying a beardless reverse head; Ulpan or Ulfan is not a recognizably Iranian name, but it may be that of the queen of this particular Orodes (pi. 12 (12)). The very last Elymaean group (pi. 12 (15)) has an obverse head to the right and was possibly struck under the impending shadow of the Sasanian revolt. Again, the nature of the numismatic evidence, all that we possess, precludes our drawing up a meaningful king-list.
During the later stages of the period under discussion, a gradual
1 Ibid. p. 426.

MINOR SOUTHERN STATES
change occurred in the reverses of the Elymaean coinage. Under the example of Seleucid issues these had included effigies of Greek deities such as Apollo, Zeus andArtemis. However, such designs were either dropped altogether or metamorphosed by insensible steps into characteristically Iranian ones, Nanaia especially. We may suspect that this process mirrors a general and natural reversion to other aspects of national culture andreligion, upon which Hellenism was no more than an ephemeral patination. Asfor thelimits of political control, Susa was recognized as of continuing importance, and Arsacid authority was intermittently re-established. Thus we have from the French excavations there, a rock-relief implying Parthian suzerainty even under the last Artabanus. On the other hand, Ahvaz was captured by Ardashir from an " Orodes ", presumably a local dynast andtheultimate scion of Elymaean separatism.
CHARACENE
With his keen eye for strategic and economic essentials, Alexander chose for one of his cities a site near theconfluence of the Tigris and the Eulaos at the head of the Persian Gulf. Death brought the collapse of many of his schemes andit wasleft to a later Seleucid to refound this Alexandria as an Antioch. It must certainly have formed a link inthe commercial chain established under Greek sponsorship as a result of the great anabasis of Antiochus III,whoreturned from theborders of India by way of Arachosia, Drangiane andPersis to Babylonia in about 205 B.C. We happen to know that one of the earlier governors or satraps of the district was called Numenius, recognizably of Mediterranean origin. Later on, in the second half of the next century, when power was passing from Seleucid to Parthian hands, the satrap was Hyspaosines, whomust be an Iranian. At the same time, his territory changed its title from Mesene to Characene (or Charax, the original native designation) while his chief town became known as Spasinu, a name clearly cognate with his own, and here a mint was established.
Naturally enough, the earliest Characenian pieces stem directly in fabric anddesign from theHellenistic money circulating in thelocality. Hyspaosines, who invaded Babylonia when theParthian empire was in difficulties about 126 B.C., struck these silver tetradrachms; they weigh about fifteen grammes andon the obverse have a beardless head while the reverse motif is a typically Greek Herakles (pi. 13(1)). Their legend is BASIAEQS TSnAOSINOT "of the king Hyspaosines", with
310



CHARACENE
dates HIIP, 9 P or A 9 P (125-121 B.C., on the assumption, surely correct, that these refer to the Seleucid era). A few small bronze coins carry a bearded head of Hyspaosines, sometimes with his father Sagdodonakos ;x others are only known from examples overstruck by Mithradates II, after he had expelled the intruder.2 The suppression of Hyspaosines' revolt would normally have led to the eclipse of the local dynasty. However, it has been suggested by Le Rider that the astute Arsacid, aware of the importance of Spasinu for the entrepot trade, allowed Hyspaosines to remain so that he could police the adjacent seas, notorious until only recently for piratical activity.
In 110-109 B-c*> w e ^ before the end of the reign of Mithradates II, appeared the next Characenian prince, Apodakos. He again struck tetradrachms (pi. 13 (2)) and bronze, the silver having the by now normal design of a seated Herakles on the reverse. A departure occurs with the silver (pi. 13 (3)) of Tiraios, dated between 95 and 88 B.C.; here the hero is replaced by Tyche. A monarch with markedly Semitic features enters the series at this point. However, both name and titulature - BASIAEQS TIPAIOY SiiTHPOS KAI EYEPrETOY "of the king Tiraios the deliverer and the beneficent" - link him firmly enough with preceding rulers. A recent hoard has given us an almost complete run of his tetradrachms from 78 to 47 B.C. (pi. 13 (4)).3 Mention of both a Tiraios and an Artabazos occurs in a passage of pseudo-Lucian in connection with longevity.4 However, our only coin of Artabazos is a unique tetradrachm dated ASS (48-47 B.C.) which depicts a man nowhere near octogenarian status (pi. 13 (5)). The portrait is of startlingly high quality - startling, that is, in comparison with others of this period when the native die-cutters were struggling to emancipate themselves from the overwhelming pressure of the moribund artistic traditions of Greece. We hardly meet with such refined technique again until the numismatic renaissance under the early Sasanians. Certainly it is far superior to any piece emanating from the Parthian mints of Orodes II, presumed suzerain of Artabazos. The plethora of epithets - BA2IAED2 APTABAZO OEOnATOPOS AYT0KPAT0P02 2 Q T H P 0 S OIA0IIAT0P02 KAI OIAEAAHNOS "of the king Artabazes, of divine descent, ruler in his own right, the deliverer, who loves his father and the Greeks " - and their square arrangement testify nevertheless to Arsacid exemplars.

Objections tothe coin's inclusion inthe Characenian series are refuted
by itsuse of a monogram which reappears two years later.1 Here we see it once more, this time on atetradrachm of Attambelos I. Stylistically his issues (pi. 13 (6)) return to those ofTiraios and employ the same epithets, too. They include a few bronze coins, and their dates run from 46 to 27 B.C. There now ensues a succession of monarchs named Theonesios (0IONHCIOY or GEONHCOY) or Attambelos (ATTAMBHAOY) upto about A.D. 113. The sole portrait variations are inthe length ofbeard, while many coins bear counter-marks onthe obverse (pi. 14 (1, 2)). Because of many gaps in the dates known, it is unrealistic to assign regnal numbers. Only one prince ofanother name occurs - Abinerglos or Adinerglos (ABINH . . .)- reigning during the second decade of the Christian eraandprobably to be identified
with the Abbinerigos mentioned byJosephus.2 Metallurgically speaking, Characenian tetradrachms of this period show a continuing debasement until all the silver disappears. An analysis of a coin of Attambelos II(?), 16 B.C. to A.D.9, gives an alloy of approximately
one-third silver and two-thirds copper.3 An intriguing departure is the
use of lead to supplement bronze for theminor currency.4 With this, in general, striking is even less efficient than for the larger denomination, but onsome specimens ATTAM or 0IEN can bemade out.
The anarchy in Syria and Parthia after about 80 B.C. permitted Tiraios and subsequent merchant princes of Characene to reinforce their grip onthe traffic in exotic goods from India, soeagerly sought by the Clodias and asbitterly condemned bythe Catos of the expiring Roman republic. Now that there was no political need, as therehad been in Achaemenian times, forsuch commerce to pass through Susa, direct caravan contacts were set up between Spasinu and Petra or Palmyra; the Nabatean Arabs cannot have been unwilling to share in the profits, while theempire of Odenathus andZenobia was inspired by this example from an earlier age. Greeks also continued toplay their part. Much of our knowledge ofthe history and geography associated with the Middle East of the period can betraced to two writers born in Spasinu, Dionysius and Isidore. The first survives only in fragments quoted bycompilators and encyclopaedists such asPliny, but from the second wehave "Parthian Posting Stations", describing theroute to Central Asia through northern Iran. Works of this nature were fre

quently commissioned by men like Caius and Germanicus, generals sent from Rome ostensibly with a view to revenging Crassus, but probably having the more practical aim of reducing the middleman's role in trading. Any enemy of the Parthians was automatically the friend of Characene, and Roman embassies seem to have been favourably received in Spasinu. Whatever dreams the current Attambelos may have cherished about freedom from his Arsacid overlords, when the reality arrived, it was no more acceptable. Trajan's invasion of Mesopotamia took him as far as Characene, where he imposed the usual concomitant of friendship with Romans a demand for tribute. This ephemeral occupation, which lasted scarcely more than the winter of A.D. I 15-16, was punctuated by uprisings further north; even so, historians of the Roman empire, more partisan than plausible, persist in representing Characene as a substantive province of the empire at its greatest extent. Subsequently Arsacid influence was reasserted, and the next coins from the area demonstrate this clearly. Dated YNA (A.D. 142-3), they are "tetradrachms" (pi. 14 (3)) having an obverse bust with a Parthian-style tiara, decorated on the side with crescents; on the reverse we read MEPEAATHC BACIAEYC YIOC OOBA BACIAEQS "king Mihrdat, son of king Phoba". Earlier theories that this group stands outside the normal series are not now accepted.1 Greek script, in a somewhat fragmentary state, appears for the last time on a few coins of the usual Characenian designs which have been attributed to an Orabzes.
After this the issues of the princes of Characene are anonymous or named in heterographic Aramaic script, those without legend having the standard types (pi. 14 (6)). Others, readingybyng'j MLR* "Abinerglos (?) the king" have a royal bust on both sides (pi. 14 (4)). The interpretation of the legend is due to de Morgan, who compares the name to Abinerglos, that of a previous monarch.2 The other side has some inscription, too, but its form is very variable and no convincing reading has yet been made. The same may be said of the final Characenian "tetradrachms" (pi. 14 (5)), which depict a diademed head on the obverse and on the reverse a head in a tiara. To de Morgan we owe the decipherment of one part as m*g zy *styby\ MLR' "Maga, son of king Attambelos (?)".3 It is probable that this group was struck about

A.D. 200 andthat therise of the dynasty of Sasan effectively suppressed all such local currencies.
The principal towns of Characene, Spasinu and the more recently prominent Forat, lying on the road westwards, were renamed bythe nationalistically conscious Ardashlr, but no doubt their raison d'etre, commerce, kept them flourishing. Certainly, a Palmyrene inscription implies that as late as A.D. 190the camels were still trudging over the desert from southern Mesopotamia. Today, however, Spasinu lies deserted on its alluvial sand.1 Only the coins attest its former importance.

CHAPTER 9
SASANIAN COINS
I. INTRODUCTION
The Achaemenian, Arsacid andSasanian dynasties which together ruled Iran for more than a millennium, all struck coins, but the issues ofthe last of these have come to be of the greatest importance; indeed, this coinage is aninvaluable source ofinformation about thehistory, culture and economic life of the Sasanian state. Virtually allthat we know about Sasanian numismatics is based on the coins themselves; they evidently neither continue precisely the Arsacid tradition, nor break with it completely.
The Sasanians adopted the denominations andweight standard used by their predecessors, and like the Arsacids they kept the obverse for the ruler's effigy and the reverse for the imperial insignia. In this, the influence of earlier coinage in the dynasty's home province of Persis is as much in evidence as that of their traditional adversary in the west, the Romans. Thechanges as compared with earlier practice are seen in the iconography of each side of the coin, and in their various combinations, in the development of fresh elements and their progressive canonization (or rigid acceptance as an unvarying feature), in the script and the epigraphic element, and lastly in technique and style. Broad political considerations, events in theforeign political scene, changes in the methods by which armies were paid, andmatters of taxation policy brought about changes in organization and production. The propagandist element which played such a large part in the contemporary Roman state, and which is discernible (albeit to a much lesser extent) in earlier Arsacid coinage, is almost completely absent. Events such as the capture of the Roman Emperor Valerian I in A.D. 260 or the conclusion of peace with Philip II, the Arab, - also claimed as a Persian victory - following the violent death of the Emperor Gordian III in A.D. 244,were indeed represented in no less than five rock reliefs by
Shapur I,1butmade nottheslightest impact on thecoinage. Coinageis, for the Sasanians, primarily an economic tool. If there is any political thinking in evidence, it is seen only in theblunt (but byno means total)

INTRODUCTION
rejection of the now defunct dynasty, in calculated gestures of defiance to Rome, and in the shrewd way the Sasanians dealt with the mintings of the Kushan western empire, which they conquered and held for the best part ofa generation in the middle of the 4th century (pi. 31 (1-5)). Of course the initial artistic impulse was not sustained forany lengthof time, and quite frequently we find a crude sketchiness of design taking its place. In the5thcentury, any remaining flexibility disappears; with the reign of Kavad I, theaesthetic torpidity which characterizes late Sasanian coinage sets in. Butthenumismatic history of the Sasanians viewed as a whole is that of a thoroughly distinctive type within the monetary world of Antiquity andof the Orient. It accomplishes the transition from ancient times tothe Middle Ages without abreak. None of the stages of its development, which canbe established in detail, represents a turning-point of the same importance as for examplethe monetary reform of the Byzantine emperor Anastasius I in 498. The coinage enjoyed anextraordinary continuity and stability over a period of four hundred years andmore, andthis ensured forit anenormous influence both onthecontemporary world and onposterity. But there is no simple explanation for thequalities referred to here, which may perhaps be compared, if only remotely, with those of the coinage of Venice in the medieval and early modern periods of European history. Thus Irano-Hunnish and, later, western Turkish peoples and dynasties minted allsorts of imitations of the Sasanian drachm in regions where its influence survived (pi. 32 (1-8)). Although the Arab conquest of Iran was sustained and inspired by the new religion of Islam, the Sasanian coin design, with the bust ofthe king onthe obverse and - far more remarkably - the fire-altar ofthe Zoroastrians onthe reverse, was preserved inIran upto the reform of79 A.H. (A.D. 698), i.e. foranother half-century; and in Tabaristan until 178 A.H. (A.D.794), a further century (pi. 31 (6-9)). With thestriking of the first true thin-flan coins in history, the influence of the Sasanians on coinage and currency technology extends through the Arabs to Byzantium; and-via the technologically derivative denars, deniers and pennies minted in medieval Europe - farinto the modern period. Vast quantities ofactual Sasanian drachms, alongside Arabo-Sasanian dirhams, constituted the usual currency of the Arab conquerors. They even continued in circulation for a fair period of time in their trimmed-down form corresponding to the reduced weight ofthe dirham introduced bythe reform of 79 A.H. Widely disseminated along with purely Arab currency, they

turn up, mainly as clipped specimens, as far afield as the dirham finds in northern Europe. Sasanian coins aresignificant in themselves, in the first place, as evidence ofSasanian craftsmanship (see Section 6), and in this sphere they exercised an influence into which, asyet, little research has been undertaken (cf. for example the evidence only recently adduced of multiple borders containing astral symbols on the decoration ofsome mirrors dating from the T'ang period in China).1 In the second place, they represent, with their portrayal of a total to date of 30 attested rulers with their personal crowns, the first and only really reliable guideline we possess tothe whole range ofSasanian art and its chronological problems. The investigation of Sasanian coins goes back asfaras the early 19th century, and in its second half Mordtmann made an especially significant contribution. Only after the middle of this century, however, did the structural analyses presented bythe author,2 reveal the regular pattern of minting and point to new lines of research in which there remain many open questions, especially those concerning the history of the mints and denominations, monetary dealings, iconographic problems, etc. The application of Sasanian numismatic sources to the history, economic patterns and cultural life of Iran is thus only at an early stage.
2. THE COIN-PORTRAIT
The alteration in Sasanian numismatic portraiture stems from Iranian national tradition;3 such changes reflect a rejection of the Arsacid dynasty and all it stood for (but see below for comments on a conscious reaction against this attitude), a deliberate challenge to the old enemy, Rome, and a focussing of attention upon the national religious ideas embodied in Zoroastrianism. On the obverse the king's portrait is made to face right, in contrast to the practice under the Arsacids. Frontal portrayals arerare; they arefound only on commemorative issues. The custom of inscribing coins with the king's name and titles close tothe edge was adopted from Rome (see Section 4). Inan experimental phase which started under Ardashir I, and did not end until the

THE COIN-PORTRAIT
period of his immediate successors, the ruler at first adopted the crown of the Parthian king Mithridates II (who - as the real founder of the second great Iranian empire - had clearly been excepted from the verdict on his dynasty), and modified this crown ina number ofways. Yet even inthis there appears the native tradition ofPersis, where the monarchs ofthe second dynasty had worn similar crowns. The mural crown ofAhura Mazda, which hewears asin the investiture relief at Naqsh-i Rustam, and the tall cap with the eagle of Anahit, decorated with ribbons, in the lateral field, introduce the typically Sasanian custom of adopting thesymbols of the gods for theroyal crowns: merlons representing Ahura Mazda, Anahit; loops with branches or the conventional representation of these - lamellae\ representing Anahit; wings, standing for Verethragna, Anahit; an eagle's head, for Anahit; rays, forMithra. Yazdgard I also added the moon, and Khusrau II a star, as emblems. Asthe kings in many cases had several investiture deities and the stock of emblems was soon exhausted, there emergedin the Sasanian crown a combination of the emblems of different gods, which was individually made up for each ruler. As the coins make plain, the convention of individual crowns was so strict that a king whose reign was interrupted by an untoward event, such as captivity or usurpation, was forced to assume a new crown, because thecrown symbolized the xivarrah or divine aura of the ruler. The new crown was based on the old one and represented it inan enhanced form. The emblems were mounted ona golden (?) circlet, and later even on a " Spangenhelm", an arched portion rising above thehead. The increasing complexity ofthe elements finally made the crowns soheavy that, forthe purposes of royal grand audiences, they were hung by a chain exactly above the monarch's head; Khusrau II's crown issaidto have weighed ultimately 91 kgs!1 The Sasanian crowns, incidentally, had a distinct formative influence on those of western Europe. The king's hair under the Arsacids was divided into two balls of carefully trimmed curls, one above the crown and one on the back ofthe head, and under the Sasanians the upper one(probably a wig) became virtually part of the crown, since it and thetopof the head were covered by a gaily coloured silk crepe. Under Ardashir I, Shapur I and Bahram I this was also drawn through and under the circlet and diadem. The colours varied according to the king, and in the case of emblems of identical design provided an additional individual feature of the crown.

SASANIAN COINS
We have partial information about the colours from Hamza al-Isfahani.1 If two colours are noted, the first reference is tothe globe, the second to the crown ofthe head, that is tosay the crown-cap which developed as an independent item atthe same time as the wig. The globe changed its form with time, becoming smaller, and under Khusrau II and some of his successors, was replaced bya star. The cap, too, finally became through its shape (tall or flat) a distinguishing feature ofthe crown,as the other points of difference disappeared. For several kings we know of special crowns and their presence has caused some confusion for art historians. But they are always based on parts ofthe regular crownsof the respective rulers, and (as has recently been shown) may be described
as reduced regular crowns.2 The purpose of these and the reason for their introduction arenot entirely obvious, butit is clear that they appear onspecial issues connected with the commemoration of events now forgotten. The pairs ofribbons have a special role onthe crowns (and elsewhere); the crowns always have two ofthese, one pair representing the free ends ofthe diadem behind the knot at the back ofthe head andtherefore hanging loose from the circlet. Later, they are tucked away behind the balls ofhair onthe nape ofthe neck, and it is through this that theerroneous impression arises that they aresuspended from the neck chain. From the third crown ofPeroz on, these ribbons are symmetrically divided tothe right and left ofthe bust, and pointed upwards. A second pair of ribbons, which are somewhat smaller, serve toseparate globe and cap, and no longer appear inthose cases where a pair ofwings isset on the arched portion above the cap. In afew cases (occasionally under Bahram IV, Yazdgard I and especially under Kavad I) this pair of ribbons is also pointed symmetrically upwards. As depicted onthe coins, the Sasanian crowns obey the lawof frontal representation and must beinterpreted accordingly. Sincethe busts aregiven in profile, emblems which cannot be recognized or
definitely identified must be turned at 900 to theobserver. The rare portraits en facecorroborate this. Among the thirty rulers so far verified in coin portraits, there is only one queen who reigns alone, namely Boran. Like the consort ofBahram II on his family portraits, she wears plaits, richly worked with jewels, which hang down beneath the crown. The queen of Bahram II andthe crown princes depicted with this monarch, aswell as Shapur I in his position as crown prince on rare

THE COIN-PORTRAIT
issues from the reign of Ardashir I are shown wearing either tall domed crowns (the Median form) orcaps with animal heads (eagle, wild boar, horse) which indicate allusions to investiture deities (Anahlt and Verethragna). Even effigies of Shapur I show him wearing an eagle cap as a special crown, and inthe case ofHormizd II, the eagle head is part of the combination of emblems in the normal crown. All the kings wear rich vestments which are essentially the same, with broad chest bands, anecklet and jewel, with small crescent moons on the shoulders. Balash is the only Sasanian to have a flame onthe left shoulder;the meaning of this is notclear. Flames on theshoulder were hitherto common only among the Kushan kings. The reverse of the coins always bears the fire-altar with flames. There are three principal varieties: (a) the altar alone; (b) the altar with the two flanking figures; (c) asthe last type with an additional bust in the flames. Ardashir I introduced the first type. It consists of a column, sometimes fluted, with several stepped plinths; the principal plinth of the altar is supported by four lion paws, of which two arevisible, resting on mushroom-like objects. They have recently been connected with the representation of the Achaemenian throne at Persepolis.1 As early as the reign ofShapur I this form of altar gave way tothe second form, and thereafter it appears only on special issues. The second type is by far the most common and dominant. The significance ofthe two attendant figures has not yet been thoroughly clarified. In particular, it is not known whether the symmetrical arrangement has any other import than pure decoration. The figures initially carry long rods, and later have clearly identifiable barsman bundles in their hands; they begin by facing away from the altar, but later turn towards it. Beginning with the fifth year of Khusrau I, they stand frontally, resting first on long sticks and later onshort ones or on swords. From the time of Bahram II onwards, atleast one ofthe attendant figures represents the ruler himself (judging from the crown), and the double representation of the king also begins under his reign. The bust in the flames, long held tobe that ofAhura Mazda, merely represents an amplification of the second type and occurs only between the reigns ofHormizd II and Balash; even so, its presence is not continuous and is usually in addition to the other types. But it always seems to stand forthe king himself, as may beseen in the case of Bahram V and Balash (where it is set

somewhat lower in front of the altar plinth), andcould refer to the introduction of royal fires. The altar columns of types (b) and (c) catty ribbons after Narseh. Special reverse designs allude to investitures, with representations either ofthe investiture deity (Hormizd I: Mithra, Anahit; Bahram II: Anahit) orofthe ruler alone (Kavad I, Khusrau I). Further special issues under Khusrau II show the goddess Anahit (bust) in a nimbus of flames, or theking standing. The reasons for these are not yet known indetail, but fall within the period ofthe great conflicts with Byzantium under the Emperor Heraclius. In one single case (Zamasp) aninvestiture (conducted by Ahura Mazda) isshown on the obverse. Anobol (£ drachm) of Shapur III has thediadem alone as its complete reverse design. It also occurs sometimes as a supplementary sign (inone instance even in thereign of Shapur II) on the altar pillar.
A peculiarity ofSasanian coins isthe presence ofa number of dotted border rings. It appears first under Shapur II, but irregularly, and does not become a feature ofboth sides until Khusrau II; then, the reverse generally has one more ring than the obverse. Certain later kings return to the simple ring. Undoubtedly, this phenomenon must derive from certain cosmological concepts, though we are not at present in a position to interpret them. There isa definite, though again unclarified, connection between such concepts and theuse of astral symbols (a crescent moon, orlater a crescent moon and star) todivide the outer field ofthe obverse into four segments, perhaps corresponding to the cardinal points and indicating the claim ofthe cosmic kingship toworld domination ; this practice starts inthe reign ofKavad I and, from Khusrau II onwards, extends to the reverses also.
A division into three occurs once under Shapur II. On the obverses, where only three actual symbols or combinations ever appear, the appropriate crown emblems make the number up tofour. Concerning the system of coupling obverse and reverse, see section 5 below and pi. 31 (6-9).
3. DENOMINATIONS AND WEIGHT STANDARDS
As regards weight-standard and choice ofdenominations, the Sasanians at first kept strictly to existing traditions. The silver drachm of Attic weight, which even in Parthian times was everywhere the commonest currency, became the chief denomination of the Sasanian state. Throughout the dynasty's four centuries, both the weight ofthe drachm, almost

SCRIPT AND EPIGRAPHY
exactly 4 grammes, andthefineness ofits metal were well maintained (but for two exceptions, seesection 5, Monetary circulation). Halfdrachms occur only initially, asaninnovation, butarelater givenup. Obols and half-obols are special strikings, primarily in connection with investitures, where they function ascoins for gifts and forthrowing to the crowds. The tetradrachms ofbillon (apoor silver alloy) which were taken over from the Arsacids and still minted inconsiderable numbers by Ardashir I, cease under Bahram II (the last known striking). After initial attempts to establish a large standard copper coin (unit) with minor denominations (perhaps conceived asa substitute for thebillon tetradrachms), copper more or less completely loses its place as the official metal ofcoinage. Small copper coins, like small silver ones,are henceforth used forceremonial purposes (see above). As was thecase later under Islam, urban requirements of small change were almost completely satisfied by the copper currency of the Parthian period which was still incirculation, consisting ofArsacid and even Hellenistic coins. Resuming the Achaemenian tradition, the Sasanians revived gold strikings, which theArsacids had notused, (though less outof regard for the gold reserves ofthe Roman emperors than because they sawno necessity for it). Under theSasanians, however, gold wasusedpredominantly for prestige anddisplay issues and,significantly, it was linked in many instances to special types. Roman prototypes are followed: the dinar (from denariusaureus) corresponds to theRoman aureus, and thenew-weight dinar to theRoman solidus (from thetime of Constantine theGreat), asa result ofwhich olddinars continued to be struck at \\ times theweight of the new dinars. Thirds of dinars, and some fractional denominations which remain obscure, are met with after Yazdgard I, and in addition there is a sixth of a dinar under Kavad I. Thecircumstances surrounding gold strikings, which some rulers do notmake at all, have notbeen sufficiently researched for definite assertions to be made. Thedinars of Bahram VIpresent an unusual case because of their marked dependence on Byzantine influence. After Khusrau II, gold ceases tobestruck.
4. SCRIPT AND EPIGRAPHY
The formulation of Sasanian coin inscriptions is determined by the political and religious motives ofthe dynasty; their form, however, is largely determined bythechoice of portrait andtheamount of space remaining, and isofcourse also dependent onthe size ofthe individual
329



SASANIAN COINS
denominations. Thecoin inscriptions arein Sasanian Pahlavi (Middle Persian) and,in isolated instances, ideograms are used. The Pahlavi alphabet is at first that of the inscriptions; from about the time of Khusrau I onwards thelater form, which is closer to Book Pahlavi, is found. Theobverse always bears thename andtitle of the king, while later the reverse introduces as standard features both the place of minting and theregnal year, after thereigns of Bahrain IVand Zamasp respectively. The development of both sides proceeds in relatively clearly defined stages in canonical formulae. Special issues for particular occasions, either in regular denominations or special ones, display special legends. The legend-type remains the same down to and including Bahram V, but is often andvariously abbreviated. In full, it reads: mydysn bgy... (name). . .MUCn MLK> >jPn MNW ctry MNyzd'n, "T h e worshipper
of Mazdah, the divine.. .(name)..., King of Kings of Iran, who is descended from thegods." From Hormizd I until Shapur III inclusive, W 'nyVn ("and non-Iran") is occasionally inserted. Yazdgard I has the special title Fmstly ("Delight of the Empire"). The legend, which usually begins at n o'clock and runs anticlockwise, is sometimes continued by the engraver in a second line on theleft-hand side ifhe cannot fit it into one circle. More frequently, however, the legend is abbreviated (in most cases irregularly); as theengraver of the inscription has only the space left over by the portrait-engraver in which to work, words normally occupying the space underneath the bust are omitted, as are,occasionally, those elsewhere. Thus it is necessary to know the canonical form in order to decipher the legends correctly. Writing errors and slavish copying byilliterate engravers, the doubling of certain letters in addition to their occasional ambiguity, and the omission of parts of words add to the problems of decipherment in detail, and have given rise to many misreadings. Yazdgard II and Peroz bear the short form m^dysn bgykdy... (name)..., " The worshipper of Mazdah, the divine king.. .(name)", and when this is used the remainder of the earlier title is dropped. Balash has thespecial formula hwkl wld\s\ "the good king Balash". A complete innovation appears with Kavad I, who hasonly thename, andadds yp%wn ("increase") in his 12th year. This formula is retained until theend of the dynasty and only Khusrau II adds the ideogram GDH = xwarrah "splendour". The usurper Bistam has a special form: pylwc tvysfhm " Peroz (victor) Bistam". After the n t h year of the reign of Khusrau II, and only in

his reign, the word '^/("praise") is found in thesecond quadrant of the border of the obverse, butnot in every year, and notfrom every mint. The meaning of this inscription is not yet clear.
The reverses initially bear theadditional inscription NWR' ZY... (name) "Fire of.. .(name)" on each side of the altar. The ideogram NWRy isreplaced from Shapur III on by theMiddle Persian equivalent *twl "fire". From the time of Bahram V,only the king's name is left, and from Zamasp onwards this too is dropped, because from now on the year ofthe reign is given in itsplace, aswas thecase for a short while under Peroz. After Bahram IV some indication of the mint is usually given, but itsposition is not yet fixed, being divided amongst the free spaces on thereverse, including thealtar columns; itis frequently given in its full form. From Bahram Vonwards, it assumes its canonical place in the right-hand field.
Among special legends, the following are worthy of note: on a dinar of Kavad I from the year of the death of Peroz (the 25th), yVny *p%w(t?) "The youth hasgrown [tostrength]"; on a dinar ofKhusrau I from the year of the death of Kavad I (the44th), gyhynpFkynt " Who bestows splendour on theearth". In addition, two different varieties of special legend occur under Khusrau II: ona dinar ofyear 21and on drachms ofthe years 26, 27, 36 and 37,[yl'n yp%wt ynyt "Iran has grown to strength" (with a portrait ofAnahit in a nimbus of flames); and on two dinars of the years 33and34, yylyn ypybymklfl "Who makes Iran free of fear". While the special legends of Kavad I and Khusrau I are typical accession strikings, those of Khusrau II already reflect the critical situation of the conflict with Byzantium and the incipient collapse of the empire, which was sealed bythe Arab conquest.
5. MINTS, MINT ORGANIZATION; MONETARY CIRCULATION
In the absence of other accounts, our theories are only to be deduced from the material that has been preserved. Strict central control is discernible from theoutset. A substantial part of the organization is certainly taken over from that of the Arsacids, from the Sasanian homeland, Pars, and also from Roman models. The number of mints varies. At thebeginning, there are probably no more than three,but in the 4th century, with the eastern campaigns of Shapur II, war-mints also appear, one of which was definitely situated in modern Afghanistan. With isolated precedents under Bahram I andShapur II,to which in



SASANIAN COINS
the course of further research other examples are sure to be added, there begins with Bahram V the obligatory designation of the mints, chiefly in the form of signs (abbreviations), rarely in full.
We now know about one hundred mint signs ofthis sort.1 As several of them give different abbreviations or names for one and thesame mint, and many establishments were only short-lived, probably being set upmerely forreasons of war, the total number of active mints at any period is considerably lower than this. At thetime of the mass striking of drachms under the later Sasanians, probably nomore than 20 mints were in operation at once. As yet it has not been possible to identify the places of minting in detail in every instance onthe basis of these signs. A number ofthem have however been identified. It has been possible to trace some of them in reference to the large citiesof the empire (i.e. provincial anddistrict capitals) for which there was evidence ofearlier issues, or onthe basis of names which appeared in full, or again by using the clues afforded by certain late Sasanian official seals which have the same sign in their centres, but bear the full name inscribed around theborder.2 Further help is offered on thegeneral state ofmonetary circulation by hoard analysis; tojudge from these, it is the products of the nearest mint which are most frequently represented. Butwepossess all toofew finds which were buried in the Sasanian period. Sasanian drachms from hoards buried in the Arab period, and mixed with dirhams, cannot asa rule beused, since such coins had travelled too far from their places of origin. And unfortunately only a very few finds reach researchers in anintact condition.
The pattern ofmintings isnow fairly clear. It shows that there was a centrally administered policy of constant change in combinations of obverses and reverses in chronological sequence. In accordance with this policy the coin-portrait and the legends were made more detailed or less so, as the case might be, but with a distinct tendency towards canonical formulations.3 The almost mathematical pattern found inthe variation of coin-portraits, where such variation is independent of the individual crowns on the obverses, together with the increasing

MINTS AND CIRCULATION
incidence of canonization, provides a means of tracing the production that took place, as indeed it does everywhere. Although wehave no knowledge ofthe procedures ina Sasanian mint, they cannot have been much different from those obtaining in mints in other countries of antiquity. In a passage which hasonly recently come to light in the Kephalaia ofMani, the prophet and founder ofManichaeism, the writer very graphically compares thecoining of the Word with theminting of a coin in itsfamiliar sequence of processes from the preparation of
the metal to theimpression andissue of the completed coins.1 As a favourite of Shapur I, Mani was probably able to observe work in progress in thecourt mint. We have no knowledge of how theindividual mints obtained their metal or of mining matters in Sasanian times, because modern conditions obviously would not be relevant, and the statements of the Arab geographers have not yet been evaluated. Besides this, a not inconsiderable proportion ofthe coinage metal was doubtless obtained by melting down earlier native or foreign currency, from booty and various other sources. This would no doubt also partially account forthe relative rarity ofearly Sasanian coins. On the other hand, all minting is based on theobservation of monetary circulation and the necessities ofthe state. Hence we are not entitled to assume regular and constant output in thecase of any one mint. The many variations in mint signs alone indicate a wide fluctuation inproduction, for which wars are chiefly to blame. Under Shapur II, all payments to the troops were evidently put on a coinage basis, which presupposes anenormous increase inproduction. The alteration of the coinage as regards typology and character under Kavad I and Khusrau I wasundoubtedly geared to the preparation and implementation ofthe taxation reform introduced by Khusrau I, inwhich all taxes were computed in terms of drachms. This was a measure which inevitably influenced the later Arab tax system. The fractional denominations in silver andcopper were used for small transactions in the marketplace, and represented the typical alms gift, as istobe seen from the examples ofdang and pashi^. We have virtually noidea of Sasanian monetary circulation, due tothe lack ofan adequate number ofrelevant finds. With the conquest of Iran, huge quantities of Sasanian drachms everywhere came into the Arabs' hands, and the financial economy of Iran functioned atleast partially on these for afull hundred years more.

SASANIAN COINS
In late Umayyad and early 'Abbasid times, finds of dirhams contain considerable numbers of Sasanian coins, whose unvarying quality renders Gresham's well-known law,whereby bad money drives the good from the market, inapplicable to Iran forsome centuries; and this must be regarded in itself as a significant phenomenon in thefieldof numismatic history. Only a very few cases areknown of coins of poor quality alloy; for example Shapur I restruck as drachms a quantity of Roman antoniniani (ordouble denarii), which were obviously plunder and were badly debased (about 50% silver); these, however, quickly disappear from the market. Other debased issues, which are principally known from the later reign of Hormizd IV, are probably not the work of coin-forgers, but are rather connected with the king's Turkish campaigns, since similar products are to be found in somewhat later mintings in the territory of the Iranian Huns, and ofpeoples related to them. The Hephthalite campaigns of Peroz, which ceased temporarily with his capture, and were finally ended with his death, formed part of the 5th-century crisis that brought Iran tothe brink of financial disaster because of the enormous sums demanded in tribute. First, theloss of large amounts of drachms forpayment of the Central Asian auxiliaries by Shapur II, and then this tribute of Peroz and his successors had long-lasting effects on the financial economy of these peoples. As the supply of replacement coinage ran out,they proceeded to theirown mintings andimitated the currency to which they had grown accustomed, as regards both denominations andtypology.
After their seizure of power, the Sasanians had suppressed all mintings from semi-independent regions of the empire which had survived under theArsacids. Butwhen, with thetemporary conquest of the Kushan western empire under Shapur II and his immediate successors, including Bahram IV, they entered a foreign currency area, they had to come to terms with it. Their handling of the problem had some quite ingenious features, combining a takeover of denominations and typology, efforts to settle their own currency in those areas,and the regular useof mixed typology (pi. 31(1-5)). Although their rule there did not last long, the short period of occupation (about one generation) sufficed to protect the stock of "mixed" types they created against imitation by political successors. In passing, it should be mentioned that counter-marks aresometimes found on Sasanian coins from the 5 th century onwards. These are marks relating to the validity of such coins ascurrency, i.e. itsextension orrestriction, and with only

COIN TECHNOLOGY AND ART
very minor exceptions, they date from thepost-Sasanian period. Since such marks were impressed on thecoins by various political parties, they reflect power struggles which took place after the Arab conquest or attempts tocome toterms with it, especially ineast Iranian territory.
6. COIN TECHNOLOGY AND ART
The problems of Sasanian numismatic art areclosely connected with those of technology. The increase in thediameter of the diefor the production of broader but thinner coins resulted in a substantially higher load on thedie, because thethin sheet silver from which the blanks or planchets had been cutnolonger provided a cushioning effect as had previously been thecase. The consequences were considerably more rapid wear, flaws andoutbreaks, andlack ofsharpness. Especially under Kavad I and Khusrau I, but also previously under Peroz, enormous quantities of crudely-made anddamaged dies were in use, being worked to death andrarely cut.Punches orhubs were probably used from thebeginning for theessentials of the design, so that the engraver hadonly toinsert details. Ata later stage, andpresumablyas a result of thoroughgoing centralization which included the manufacture of dies, it would appear that more refined methods of quantity production were introduced. The extraordinary uniformity and similarity of the dies from widely separated mints canhardly be explained otherwise. Inthelater period, itispossible that, atleast atcertain stages, partly finished dies were sent to theindividual mints, sothat the local engravers merely hadtoincise theyear ofthe reign andthesign of the mint. They would then undertake repairs andparticularly there-cutting of relief and contour, which would, forexample, explain the continual increase in size ofthe heads in the reign ofKhusrau II. Ofcourse, the same thing could happen as a result of the continual spread of the head punches used to make theobverse dies. Re-cutting, whichhad hitherto merely been allowed to pass, now came to be an officiallyprescribed makeshift technique, asforexample in the aforementioned mint atKabul, which was unable togetanymore replacement diesand was only capable of producing new ones singly, andvery crudely at
that. Among the numerous Sasanian mints, the BBA (BB9 = dar "door, court") mint, that is to saythe court mint, always hasa special style, particularly under Khusrau II. Most of the unsigned special strikings of the late period were in fact probably made there.

SASANIAN COINS
The high incidence ofclumsily made coins under certain rulers from the 4th century on hasgiven rise to adverse criticisms of the artistic value of Sasanian coins in general. This is very unfair, because fora true judgement, asinother fields, the best average productions mustbe considered alongside the peaks of achievement. Sasanian numismatic art is plainly all of a piece with other artistic productions under the dynasty; andhence, like these, it is notfree of a certain naive monumentality, which sometimes slips into sheer clumsiness, butwhich in the finest work is bynomeans devoid ofelegance. The strikings of the first Sasanians are of scarcely lower quality than the contemporary Roman ones and are, like these, inthe best Hellenistic tradition. What is especially noticeable is thesudden raising of the artistic standard under the first Sasanians, who went back to theHellenistic tradition of art in Mesopotamia andmay well also have employed captured artists from the Roman east. From about thetime of Bahram V thecoin portraits are in much shallower relief, just as theRoman ones are. A newand sometimes quite barbaric or at any rate formalized style, which is not occasionally without expressive quality, gains ascendancy, and the value ofthe pictures asportraits virtually disappears. Inthe twentiesof the reign of Khusrau II, the second, albeit formalistic, renaissance of artistic styles begins, which has noneed tofear comparison betweenits highest achievements and either the other achievements oflate Sasanian art orthe coins ofthe neighbouring Byzantine state. It lays the foundation for thedevelopment of later, non-pictorial, numismatic art under Islam.

PART III
IRANIAN HISTORICAL TRADITION



The Sasanians were in possession of an historical tradition which had its roots in remote antiquity and had taken shape chiefly through oral transmission. It contained stories of mythical kings and sagas of legendary princes and noble warriors, as well as factual history. This tradition, which found its fullest expression in the Khwaday-ndmag of Sasanian times, was based on an outlook born of Iranian religious, social and political developments, and employed norms and premises different from those underlying modern historical research. The Iranian outlook and its religious foundations are presented in Chapter \oa\ Chapter \ob examines the mythical, legendary and factual history of Iran, as it developed in the native historical tradition, in three parts: the first part discusses the characteristic features of this tradition; the second, the origin and development of Iranian myths and legends; and the third, the treatment of factual history in traditional historiography. Editor.



CHAPTER io(a)
IRANIAN COMMON BELIEFS AND WORLD-VIEW
To befully comprehensible, Iranian myths and legends and the subsequent development of the Iranian historical tradition must be studied in thecontext ofthe Iranian world-view. TheAvestan material, although presented in a Zoroastrian redaction, preserves many of the Iranian beliefs which were inherited from remote antiquity andpersisted in Iran throughout the Sasanian period. Pahlavi books, too, despite their late composition, have kept for us an essentially pre-Zoroastrian set of
beliefs concerning cosmology andthenature of corporeal creation.1 On thebasis ofthe Avesta, the Rig-Veda, andthe conservative Pahlavi literature, it is possible to arrive at anapproximation of the development of the Iranian world-view from pagan times to theadvent of Islam.
DIVINE BEINGS AND THEIR ALLIES
The Indo-Iranian people believed ina number ofgods, mostly symbolizing forces oraspects ofnature, who wielded great power over natural
events, as well as over man's destiny.2 A discussion of the Iranian
pantheon orIranian demonology is outside the scope of this chapter.3 The following remarks are meant to provide only the necessary background incosmology against which themythical andlegendary history of Iran developed. Already in pagan times, social development and ethical considerations had given rise tothe concept ofdeities whopersonified orrepresented abstract ideas or moral values. Mitra (Av. Mithra), one of the great Indo-Iranian gods, was a protector of pacts and promises, and Varuna, another powerful god, had in his charge rta(Old Pers. arta, Av. asa)y theuniversal order based on truth. Gods were worshipped through ritual sacrifice and prayer in order to ensure their favour and gain their protection. Different orders ofdeities were worshipped. The most important distinction was between the asuras (Av. ahura) and the

IRANIAN COMMON BELIEFS
devas(Av. daeva.Old Pers. daivd). The asuras, who included Mitra and Varuna, were beneficent, mighty gods inpossession ofa magical power called maydy which they brought to bear on theadministration of the world.1 The devas appear to have been somewhat amoral beings,endowed with great physical strength; their chief representative was a mighty war god, Varathraghna inIran and Indra in India.2 In addition, theIndo-Iranian pantheon included nature deities who symbolized the sun, the moon, and other luminaries, water, fire, wind, and the sky. Particularly prominent among these deities inIran was the goddess ofthe waters, Aradvl Sura, originally perhaps a river divinity, who is celebrated in the Aban Yasht of the Avesta and to whom many Iranian heroes offered sacrifice. Cult gods, concerned with ritual worship, were another order of divine beings venerated by theIndo-Iranians. Chief among these was Soma (Av. Haoma). Herepresented a plant of the same name, whose exhilarating juice, obtained through pounding and pressing the stalks, was widely used inthe worship and was offered tothe gods in sacrificial rituals. Asthe divine priest of sacrifice, Soma came to symbolize some aspects of the sacrifice itself. In the Zoroastrianism of the Yashts,3 the Iranian pantheon is dominated byAhura Mazda, the supreme god and creator of the world and of all the other gods. Individual deities, however, retain their characters and powers. They canaid those who worship them or frustrate and punish those who reject them.

Like theIndian pitaras, thefravasis were the souls of the departed, and their cult may have had its origin inaform ofancestor worship.4 Bailey has suggested an etymology which would indicate that they were originally thedeparted spirits of heroes andthat later the concept was enlarged to include all mortals - dead, born, and unborn.5 The fravasis were conceived as invisible, powerful beings who could assist their kinsmen andward off harm from them if properly commemorated with offerings and prayers.

The xvarBnah. Variously translated as Divine Fortune, Grace, or Glory, the xvaranah (Mid. Pers. farrah, Pers. farr) was conceived as a blessing bestowed from above, usually byAsi, the goddess of wealth and recompense.2 Originally, it appears tohave meant the good things given tomortals by the gods, but the concept was also hypostasized as a deity. As a divine gift, it accompanied men and women favoured by the gods, and it afforded them power and prosperity. The Zamyad Yasht, although dedicated to the Earth, in fact celebrates thexvaranah as possessed by gods, prophets, andgreat heroes of Iranian mythand legend. The xvaranah is oneof the most enduring concepts of Iranian tradition and figures prominently in the national history. No king could rule successfully without it. It was only by virtue ofthe xvaranah that the mighty achieved fame and glory. Its presence brought success and symbolized legitimacy. Itsabsence changed men's fortunes, indicating divine disfavour and often auguring imminent fall or defeat. The xvaranah was frequently conceived asanimage, such asa ray of light or a bird. As the Fortune ofthe Iranian kings, it was called the Royal Glory (Kavaemxvannah) and became identified with the Glory of Iran {Airyamm xvartnah). Itwas also sought by hostile forces and the enemies of the Aryan people as a guarantee ofsuccess. When Yima succumbed to the Lie, the xvaranah departed from him inthe shape ofa bird and passed into the possession ofMithra. A2i Dahaka attempted to capture it, but it was saved byFire and escaped into the mythical Vourukasa Sea, whereupon it fell under the protection of the god Ap^m Napat. Afrasiyab plunged into the water three times, striving tocapture it, but each time he failed.3
The xvaranah must have had a special place in the accounts of the kings in the Khwaday-ndmag asanexpression of divine will or favour. This isoften reflected inIslamic sources, particularly inthe Shdh-ndmay where many rises and falls of kings are explained in terms of the presence or absence of the xvaranah. Yima is defeated by Dahak when the xvaranah departs from him. Tus and Gustahm, sons ofking Naudhar, are barred from kingship on the ground that they lacked the xvaranah.

The Holy Immortals. Asa result of the Zoroastrian reform another group of divine beings, the chief Amasa Spantas (the "Bounteous, or Holy,2 Immortals"), rose to prominence. Six in number, and representing the aspects of Ahura Mazda, they personify primarily the ethical concepts ofZoroastrianism: Vohu Manah "Good Mind", Asa Vahista "Highest Truth", Xsathra Vairya "Desirable Dominion", Spanta Armaiti "Bounteous Devotion", Haurvatat "Health", and Amaratat "Life". The sixHoly Immortals, together with Ahura Mazda, who headed them and also represented them intheir totality, were incharge of the seven " creations " of the Old Iranian world picture. Thus they were intimately involved in physical phenomena, in the course of human life, and in religious observances. A variety offabulous creatures who are either helpful orharmful to man are known inthe Iranian myths.3 They are also met inthe Avesta, the Pahlavl books, and the folk epics of Persian literature. Important among them, and conspicuous in the Shdh-ndma and in Persian literature, is the Saena bird(Av. Saena maragha. Mid. Pers. Sen-murv, Pers. Semurgh, Simurgh) mentioned in the Avesta4 and elaborated in the Pahlavl books.5 Its resting place, according to Yasht 12.17, is on the fabulous tree which is inthe middle ofthe Vourukasa Sea and which bears the seeds ofall plants and healing herbs. Itis by the beating of the Semurgh's wings that the seeds ofthis tree are scattered, tobe carried by wind and rain over all the earth. Inthe Shdh-ndma^ the Semurgh isdepicted as a huge eagle with magical powers, which has its nest on top ofa high mountain. It rears Zal and helps Rustam defeat Isfandiyar. Itis not certain, however, whether this isthe same bird as the one described inthe Avesta. Since the legends ofZal and Rustam are probably ofSaka origin,6 and in any event from a different region than the birthplace of the Avesta, itis likely either that two different miraculous birds have coalesced inname or that different myths were attached to the bird in different regions. Another legendary bird is Karshiptar, which, according to the Vendiddd 2.24, spread the good religion inYima's underground fortress.

FALSE GODS
FALSE GODS, DEMONS, AND MALICIOUS SPIRITS
The Indo-Iranians believed not only in beneficent gods and spirits but in a number of hostile supernatural beings and malignant spirits.To avert thethreats to human life posed by theinimical hosts, acts of propitiation, ritual incantations, banning formulas, and appeals to the benevolent deities were practised. The ways ofreligious thinking inIndia and Iran, however, did not keep to the same path for long. In Iran, religious deliberation, prompted presumably bysocial, political, and economic circumstances, led to a distinct schism inthe Indo-Aryan pantheon. Whereas deva continued as the designation of gods among the Indo-Aryans, in Iran the daevas were branded as gods who opposed the well-being of man and were thus unworthy of worship. Zoroaster conceived them to be the principal agents of evil and, as adverse gods, thetargets of his denunciation. Subsequently they sank tothe rank ofmere demons. It is not possible to determine with certainty the phases ofthis development intermsof time, or to say how much of it was due to Zoroaster's reform. From the Gathas it appears that in his day some Iranian tribes worshippedthe daevas or practised their propitiation. T.Burrow has put forth a strong argument infavour ofassuming these tohave been chiefly the "ProtoIndoaryans ", ofwhom some had already migrated toIndia, but others still occupied parts ofeastern Iran and against them Zoroaster and his
supporters waged war1 - a view essentially expressed by L. Gray in
1927.2
In Zoroastrian teachings the demons and other malicious creatures all followers of Drug, "Falsehood" - became ever more sharply contrasted with divine beings and acted desperately against themen who hadchosen Asa, "Truth ". Angra Mainyu (Ahriman), the un
created opponent ofAhura Mazda, was the creator ofall the demons.3 The particular targets ofdivine wrath inthe Avesta, the demons were slain by the thousands at the hands ofvarious deities, the fravasis, and Iranian heroes. Through sacrifice, prayer, and magical incantation, the believers sought to neutralize or destroy them. The Zoroastrian confession of faith, theFravardne (Yasna 12), abounds in abjuration of

demons.1 The opening words of this confession as it stands now - " I curse the demons" - although a later addition,2 testifies only to the growing abhorrence ofthe demons by the Zoroastrians. Of the host of demons only Aesma, the demon ofWrath, ismentioned in the Gathas.3 Drug, "the Lie, Deceit" as the counterpart of Asa, and as a generic term, is apersonification of an ethical concept referring to the multitude of demonic creatures who lurk everywhere, bent on turning man away from the right path and determined tocorrupt the world. Anumber of individual demons who, likeya^atas, "divine beings" (lit. "worthy of worship"; Mid. Pers. ya%ad; Pers. i%ad\ have special functions are named in theYashts. In the Videvddd, "the Law against Demons", which is particularly concerned with the pollution inflicted by Nasu, the Demon of Death, several other demons are mentioned. Three fallen Indo-Iranian deities, Indra, Narjhaithya (Ved. Nasatya), and Sauvra (Ind. Sarva), are listed among the demons.4 Ina compensating effort Ahriman created demonic counterparts to each of Ohrmazd's creations and an arch-fiend against each Amasa Spsnta.5 In the Pahlavl books, inparticular the Bundahishn, many more demons are named.
The demons were visualized indifferent shapes: some, like Nasu,as insects, others, like Apaosa, the Demon ofDrought, inanimal shapes, and still others asserpentine monsters and asdragons ofvarious descriptions. But most were thought, in later traditions, tohave deformed and monstrous human shapes.
Sasanian historiography reflects belief in demons, and accordingly they have a conspicuous place in the Shdh-ndma.The primaeval kings are constantly atwar with the demons, whom they hold tobe the foremost enemies of men, and their greatness consists partly in breaking and subduing these foes. Karasaspa is the conqueror and slayer of many a monster,6 as are Rustam, Isfandiyar, and other heroes. Even Ardashir is credited with the destruction of the dragon Kaftvad7(Haftanbukht in the Kdrndmag i A.rdashir)* Demons can change shape and make useof magical power. It is a fiend who, in theform of a skilful musician, persuades Kavus toundertake the disastrous Mazandaran expedition,9 while another fiend, inthe shape of an attractive young man, urges him to make the flight into the skies.10The Shdh-ndma also has a fiend, inthe

guise of a brilliant cook, who causes the notorious snakes to grow on Dahak's shoulders.1 The most conspicuous demon in the Shdh-nama, however, is theWhite Demon (Dev-i Saf Id), who is defeated andkilled by Rustam inanextraordinary feat ofcourage and strength.2 As Noldeke has pointed out, thelegend may have preserved vestigial memories ofa war between eastern Iranians anda tribe, in theCaspian region or elsewhere, who worshipped daeva-gods, possibly of light3-hence the epithet "white". Thelegend of Rustam's slaying of the Demon Akvan, cast in the frame of a popular tale by Firdausi, maybe another such vestige.
Apart from daevas, there were other spirits who inhabited the world and threatened man with harm. Chief among these were the ydtus, originally demons, who, when later the daevas were degraded to demons, came to be designated sorcerers. Theantiquity of this notion is suggested by theoccurrence of these spirits in Indian literature also.4 Pairikds are female beings of malicious nature, once associated inthe Avesta with shooting stars,5 and later considered for all practical purposes to be sorceresses. In the Yashts they are often mentioned with the yatus and are assailed by gods and heroes.6 As they often posed as beautiful women in popular stories, they came to be regarded in Sasanian Persia, but more particularly in post-Sasanian literature (Pers. part), as the epitome of charm and beauty.7
THE WORLD AND ITS CREATION
In pagan antiquity various myths about the creation of the world and
the nature of the universe evidently existed, as their traces can be found
in both the Vedas and the Avesta, as well as in the Pahlavl books. It
appears that even before Zoroaster a good deal of systematization had
taken place, and a coherent world picture had already evolved.8 It is

obvious that an attempt was made to trace thediverse speciesand phenomena to a single origin in order to make intelligible the chaotic world of change and variation. Zoroaster, being essentially a moral thinker, probably did not initiate any radical formulation of thought about the nature of the universe and its origin. Itis clear, however, that his ethical dualism, his investing ofAhura Mazda with greater power than before, and hisparticular vision of the role played by theEvil Spirit gave the older beliefs a new perspective and made the creation myths the instrument ofa freshly conceived ethical order. The Pahlavl books, in particular the Bundahishn, which is mainly concerned with creation and the nature ofthe visible world, have preserved awealth of pertinent tradition and beliefs which must have been inherited chiefly from pre-Zoroastrian times.
According to the Bundahishn,1 the universe was created in seven stages, in the following order: the sky, water, earth, plants, animals, man, and fire - an order which is confirmed by the Avesta.2 A more sophisticated scheme, however, according towhich Ahura Mazda brought forth fire out ofthe Endless Light, ether (pad)out of fire, water out ofether, and all matter from water, except the seed ofman and animals, which was made from the essence of fire, appears in another passage of the Bundahishn? But this version ofcreation no doubt reflects a later view, developed bysubsequent priestly speculations. It strikes one as more philosophical than mythical, seeking asit does a single origin forthe diversity ofnature and possibly incorporating some foreign influences.
The sky4 was conceived as a round, hard vault, made of bright precious stone (i.e. rock crystal, sometimes referred to as "shining metal"),5 which encircled the earth. Water filled the lower part of the sphere of the sky and passed beneath the earth.6 The view that the earth was created in three stages7 apparently served to account forits hard core, itssoft crust of soil, and the layer in between. Mountains grew from the earth like trees with "roots"8 underground. The greatest of these mountains was thehigh Hara (Av. Hara.barazaiti, Mid. Pers. Harburz, Pers. Alburz) which encompassed the earth and kept growing, according to the Bundahishn (ix. 1-2), for 800 years, until it passedthe regions of the stars, themoon, and the sun and reached the highest

heaven. Other mountains grew from it, numbering in all 2,244.2 Like the Indians, the Iranians believed in seven climes (Av. karsvar, Pers. kishvar), which came into being when the rain first fell and broke the earth into seven pieces. In the centre was Xvaniratha (Mid. Pers. Khwanirah),2 the fairest clime of all and equal in size to all the other karsvars put together. In Xvaniratha lay Airyanam Vaejah (Mid. Pers. Eran Vej), the land of the Iranians. In the Videvddd 1.2, this country is described as the first and the best of dwelling-places and lands. A legendary region at the centre of the world, it was seen by the Iranians as the seat of all major phenomena and world events. The river Veh Daiti flowed through it, and both the primordial Bull and Gayomard3 were created in it. In the first chapter of the Videvddd,where it heads the list of countries created by Ahura Mazda, Airyanam Vaejah is described as having a winter of ten months' and a summer of two months' duration. In the middle of Xvaniratha stood a lofty mountain which had grown up from Hara and was called the Peak (Av. Taera; Mid. Pers. Terag) of high Hara, sometimes itself referred to simply as Hara. It was believed that the stars, the moon and the sun, which were imagined to be below the vault of the sky, had their orbit around the Peak of Hara.4 According to the Mithra Yasht 51-2, Ahura Mazda, together with the Amasa Spantas, made a dwelling for Mithra on high Hara, "where comes neither night or darkness, no cold or hot wind, no deadly illness, no defilement made by the daevas, and the clouds cannot reach u p " . From high Hara, Mithra watches over the whole world. There are 180 windows on the eastern side of the Peak and 180 on the western side. Each day at dawn the sun enters one of the windows on the east and circles back through a western window. Later Hara was identified with the mountain now called Alburz, and its major peak, Demavand, is the scene of a number of mythical and legendary events in the national tradition. It was here that Fredon chained and imprisoned Dahak, and it was in the Alburz mountains that Rustam discovered Kai Kavad. Precisely which mountain Hara was originally meant to indicate is hard to say. Such an identification would depend on the antiquity of the myth and the region that the Iranians occupied when the myth developed.
Hara is also the source of the waters.5 The mythical sea Vourukasa

[Mid. Pers. Varkash or Frakh(w)kard] which skirts thefoot of Hara, occupies one-third of the earth.1 Water flows down into thesea from the Peak ofHara inthe river Aradvi Sura, which isaslarge asall other rivers puttogether.2 Two rivers, theVaghvi Daitya "Good Daitya" (Mid. Pers. Veh Daiti orVeh Rod) and the Ranha (Mid. Pers. Arang), flow out ofVourukasa, one tothe east and the other tothe west, forming the eastern and western boundaries of Xvaniratha.3
The identification ofthe rivers, lakes, mountains, and place names in Iranian myths andlegends hasbeen the subject of considerablediscussion among scholars. For instance, the river Rarjha has been identified variously as the Indus,4 Jaxartes,5 Tigris,6 theVolga,7 the Zarafshan River in Sogdiana,8 and even the Nile.9 In thePahlavl books oneencounters contradictory statements, which indicate shifting identifications by the Iranians themselves.10 Eran Vej seems to have been identified atabout the time ofZoroaster with Chorasmia,nand Hara has long been identified with the present Alburz chain. But one must bear in mind, as Boyce points out12 that itwould be of little profit to speculate about the original mountain, river, orland which may lie behind these names since one cannot becertain of the location of the Iranian tribes when thenames came into use. Furthermore, like most migrants,the early Iranians seem to have applied oldnames to new places.
What appears to be a more primitive myth than the myth of the creation ofplants asthe fourth creation, concerns a tree, referred to in the Rashn Yasht 17 as theTree of All Remedies or the Saena tree,13 which wassaid to grow in the middle of the Vourukasa Sea. It is described in the Videvddd 5.19 as the well-watered tree upon which grow plants of every kind, by hundreds, by thousands, by hundreds of thousands.
The fifth creation, animal life, hadits origin in theBull Uniquely Created (Av. Gdv aevo.ddta\ Mid. Pers. Gdv 1evddd),which was brought forth in Eran Vej, in the middle of the earth, onthe bank of the river Veh Daiti. He is described as "white bright as the moon, with the

height of three measured reeds "-1 His death, probably through sacrifice by the gods, resulted in the emergence of new life.2 A portion of the Bull's seed was taken to the moon to be purified. From it came into being all the species of beneficent animals. The other part of his seed fell on the earth and gave rise to many kinds of useful plants.
The sixth creation was Gayo.maratan (Mid. Pers. Gayomard,and in the Shah-nama Kayomarth) "Mortal Life", who is said to be as "bright as the sun" and to measure the same in height and width.3 He was stationed on the left bank of the river Veh Daiti, opposite the Bull. In the Zoroastrian version of the myth, both the Bull and Gayomard perish as a result of Ahriman's onslaught upon the world of Ohrmazd. Gayomard's seed, which was purified by the sun's light, was partly entrusted to Narisah (Av. Nairyo.sarjha, Pers. Narse), a god of prayer associated with Fire and Mithra, and partly received by Spandarmad (Av. Spanta.Armaiti), the Earth. From the part that was entrusted to the earth sprang, after forty years, a rhubarb plant that developed into Mashya and Mashyana, the first human couple.
The position of fire in the scheme of creation is manifestly ambiguous. While fire is sometimes referred to as the seventh creation,4 on occasion it is not counted with the others at all. It was believed that fire derived its brightness from the Endless Light, the abode of Ohrmazd,5 and that it pervaded all other beings. The seed of both man and animals was said to derive from it. "The fully evolved doctrine may well have been", writes Mary Boyce, "that this element first passed into the being of the six creations proper when these became animated, forming, as it were, their life force."6
The cosmic conflict. With the spread of Zoroaster's teachings, the inherited world picture of the Iranians assumed a new colouring. In priestly schools the diverse elements of myth and reality were brought together and combined into a scheme characterized by an ethical thrust. The essence of the scheme was the fierce opposition between good and evil. The universe was now pictured as a battlefield of the two primeval forces, with man as an active and important factor in the outcome. Creation assumed a moral purpose and the course of history - past, present, and future - was visualized with clarity as part of an orderly programme, the direction and main features of which had been determined at the outset. In broad outline, world history was in fact no more

than a realization of the vision of Ohrmazd when his omniscience permitted him to perceive, at the beginning, the events of the future until thetime of Ahriman's annihilation. Future history was viewed with as much certainty as the past.
The most detailed account of world events according to the above scheme, with a basis inIranian cosmology, isfound inthe Bundahishn } According tothis work, Ohrmazd, inhis all-knowing wisdom, realized the existence of Ahriman and foresaw his attack, as well as the period of intermingling (gome^ishn) which would follow. He also realized that in the end victory would behis. To prepare forthe defence ofhis realm and for final victory, first he created the cosmos: the six Holy Immortals, the other yazads, the elements and astral bodies, all in a spiritual state (pad menogih). For 3,000 years the world remained inthis state, without movement, thought, or tangible substance. The time was fixed at noon, and peace and serenity prevailed. Ahriman, rising from hisabyss of total darkness, caught sight of the Light and the luminous nature of Ohrmazd's world. True to hisdestructive nature, heinvaded it. But faced with the valour and fortitude ofOhrmazd, he rushed back tohis abyss and fashioned (karwzd, "miscreated") many demons (dlvs) and death-dealers, then rose for battle. Ohrmazd, knowing theoutcome, offered him peace, with a promise of immortality and freedom from hunger and thirst, ifhe would withdraw and offer praise to Ohrmazd's creatures. When Ahriman refused, Ohrmazd realized that if he did not fix a limit for the duration of the battle, he would place himself at a disadvantage. Therefore, he suggested 9,000 years as thelength of the contest. Ahriman, with his lack of foresight, agreed to this covenant, and Ohrmazd revealed to him the outcome of their battle and recited the potent Ahunavairyo prayer. Ahriman, struck bythe power of the prayer, was stunned, and fell back once more into the depths of darkness, lying ina stupor for3,000 years. During these 3,000 years Ohrmazd created the visible world (getig) as a defence against the forthcoming attack of Ahriman. Within one year of 360 days, he created in succession thesky, water, theearth, plants (urvar), beneficial animals (gospand), man, and fire.2 Then he created the fixed and the moving stars, the moon, and the sun, arranging and organizing them inranks and positions for battle with the Adversary.3 Further, he assigned each creature its role during that battle and placed each class of creature in the charge of one of the six Holy

CREATION
Immortals: Ohrmazd himself took charge of man, Vahman of animals, Ardvahist (Av. Asavahista) of fire, Shahrevar of metal, Spandarmad of the earth, Hordad of water, and Amurdad of plants.1
While Ahriman was lying in stupor, several of his demons tried to cheer him up and urge him to action. But only Jeh, the arch-whore, succeeded at the end of 3,000 years in rousing him out of his fright by promising to defile all manner of creatures.2 At noon, on the first day of the first month (day Ohrmazd of the month Farvardin), Ahriman invaded the world of Ohrmazd, inflicting damage and wreaking havoc in every direction. He pierced and darkened the sky, spoiled the taste of water, let loose noxious creatures over the earth, withered plants, attacked both the primeval Bull and Gayomard with greed, want, pain, hunger, disease, vice and neglect, and mingled smoke with fire. Then Gav and Gayomard, both afflicted, passed away, the latter after lingering for thirty years. The battle raged ferociously, with the yazads, the constellations, stars, the moon, and the sun trying to ward off the demons. After ninety days, the demons were reduced and thrown back into hell,3 but not before they had disfigured and corrupted the universe, bringing the world to its present "mixed state".^
The third phase of world history consists of the next 3,000 years, a period of admixture, divided into three millennia. The first millennium sees the rise of Pishdadian world kings and their continual battle against the divs. The second millennium is entirely taken up by the tyrannical rule of the monstrous Dahak. The third is devoted largely to the reign of the Kayanians and the Irano-Turanian wars; the advent of Zoroaster heralds its close; and it ends with the conversion of Gushtasp (see below for the events of this period).
Eschatology. The final phase of the world's history, also a period of admixture, is likewise divided into three millennia, at the end of each of which a future son of Zoroaster will appear as a Messiah to help the cause of the good religion and to ensure the defeat of its enemies. They are to be born of the seed of the prophet, which is preserved in Lake Frazdan, in Sistan, and watched over by a large number of the fravasis of righteous men. At the appointed time destined maidens will bathe in the lake, receive the seed, and give birth to the successive Saviours. The last one, the Sosyant (Saviour) par excellence, appears at the end of the

third millennium to bring about the dissolution of the admixture and
the renovation ofall existence. In theGathas the older form of the word, saosyant, "benefactor, helper", isused mostly as a general term which seems torefer to those men in the future who would help bring about the Renovation (fraso. kdrdta,Mid. Pets.frashagird). Inthe Yashts, the doctrine of the Saviour is more explicit: Astvat.arata, the victorious Sosyant, will come accompanied byhis helpers and by the xvarsnah, topurify the world and to bring immortality. He emerges from Lake Kyanslh (Av. Kasaoya, identified with Lake Hamiin inSlstan), brandishing the weapons which Thraetaona used to slay A2i Dahaka, which Fragrasyan wielded to smite Zainigav, which Kavi Haosravah carried against Franrasyan, and which Kavi Vistaspa held toavenge Asa. He will conquer and drive out the Drug (the Lie) from the world of Asa (Truth).1 But the Avesta does not know more than this about the Sosyant. Later, it seems, the millennial view ofhistory inconjunction with knowledge ofthe three sons born naturally tothe prophet, who are mentioned in the Avesta, gave riseto the concept of triplicate Sosyants, each ofwhich would appear at the end ofone ofthe last three millennia.
The coming of the Sosyant and the events ofthe final phase of the world are already sketched inthe Zamyad Yasht (vv. 89-96). They are elaborated in the Pahlavl books ofthe 9th century,2 which display many differences in detail but agree inthe main. The fullest version is found in the Zand 1Vahman Yasht, which isbased on the now lost Vahman Yasht. TheMuslim conquest no doubt prompted a flowering of apocalyptic literature, but what one finds inthe Pahlavl books appears essentially to represent Sasanian beliefs. It maybe presumed that towards the end of Sasanian times the following, broadly outlined views prevailed inrelation tofuture world events.
At the close ofthe 10th millennium, Pishotan, a son of king Gushtasp, will appear and assume the leadership of the faithful. Withthe help of 150 righteous men and a number ofyazads, hewill defeat the forces of Ahriman and cleanse the world. He thus prepares the way for the birth ofHoshedar (Av. Uxsyat.arata), the first ofthe three Saviour sons of the prophet. Hoshedar will gather a mighty army and ina terrible battle crush thewicked andrestore thereligion. The n t h millennium belongs to Hoshedar, asthe 10th belongs to Zoroaster.

CREATION
The 12th millennium belongs to Hoshedarmah (Av. Uxsyat.namah), the second Saviour. It is during this millennium that the demon Malkush (Av. Mahrkusa) appears and causes the terrible snow-storm which destroys all creatures. The people and the animals who had taken refuge in Jamshed's fortress (Var) are released and populate the world again. Owing to the spread of wickedness and evil heresies, however, Ahriman gains power and rouses Dahak, who had been chained by Fredon in Mount Demavand, to ravage the world. With the help of the yazads, Ohrmazd in turn rouses the hero Karshasp from his trance. In the ensuing battle, Karshasp slays Dahak with his famous mace. Also called to take part in the final battle are the Zoroastrian Immortals, men and women, including Kai Khusrau, Tus, and Gev.
Now the time has come for the appearance of the last and greatest of the Saviours, the Sosyant, to oversee the final victory. In the course of fifty-seven years he will resurrect the dead, beginning with Gayomard. All men will assemble, and every person will view his own good or evil deeds. The righteous will be sent back to the highest heaven (garodmari) and the wicked will be cast into hell (dut(akhtv)> each for the duration of three days. Then the divine Airyaman and Fire will melt all the metal in the hills and mountains and will cause all souls, both righteous and wicked, to go through an ordeal by fire and molten metal for their purification. The sins of the damned will be burnt away by the ordeal, and the wicked will be purged. The Sosyant and his helpers will then prepare the beverage of immortality (anos); each soul will drink of it and thereby become immortal. Then the Sosyant will recompense each one according to his or her deeds. Ohrmazd will seize the Evil Spirit and the six Holy Immortals their demonic counterparts. Ahriman and the arch-demon Az, defeated and undone by the Gathic prayer, will retreat to their dark abyss through the breach in the sky made by Ahriman when he first entered the world, and the forces of evil will be assigned to eternal gloom. A renewed existence begins a life of bliss for all the good creation.
Thus the history of the world, past and to come, is conceived and presented as a long, arduous struggle against evil. The Iranian national heroes from Gayomard onwards are all champions of this battle. Even Zoroaster's redemptive function is conceived with his fravasi at the beginning, when Ahura Mazda makes his plans for creation. Even as human life had begun with Gayomard, the Renovation will begin with his resurrection, thus completing the cycle of history. The major figures

of the epic tradition, divinities andmortals alike, will join in the final battle against evil, helping to bring to a conclusion the divine drama in which they were the chief actors.1 The forceful and all-pervasive dualism of the Iranian religion provided a clear ideological context for the comprehension and interpretation of social and political events, as well as a framework for moral judgment. National disasters were understood to have been inflicted by Ahriman andhis agents, aided by people's failure to pursue asa as admonished by Ahura Mazda; heretics, trespassers of social canons, rebels and wrong-doers were regarded as having erred in their moral choice andbeen ensnared by demons. Pollution, disease anddeath were accepted as evils attendant on the "mixed" state of the world. All good things were bestowed by Ahura Mazda, the Amasa Spantas and the Yazatas - on those who had earned them. The future was bright with theprospect of the Sosyant and thehope of ultimate salvation. A belief in Fate and the inexorable decrees of Time, which appears to have developed in the Sasanian period andcolours some of the gnomic literature in Middle Persian, must have remained marginal tothe dualistic picture ofthe world which gave man freedom of choice.

By national history is meant in this chapter the history of Iran as conceived by tlje Iranians themselves and embedded in Iranian historical tradition. Since the material for this history is partly mythical and legendary, the chapter will inevitably touch also on Iranian myths and legends.
In exploring Iranian historiography in pre-Islamic times we encounter considerable difficulty: no historical books have survived from Seleucid, Parthian or Sasanian Iran. Our exploration must therefore be based on inferential evidence On theother hand, there is no doubt that comprehensive written histories didexist, at least in Sasanian times. The latest version of a fairly official historical book, the Khwaddy-ndmag (Book of Lords), which treated of Iranian history from its beginnings to theendof Khusrau II'sreign (A.D. 628), seems to have been compiled under Yazdgird III (631-651), the last Sasanian monarch.1
1
THE SOURCES
The Khwaddy-ndmag^ together with other works pertaining to Persian history and legend, was translated early into Arabic, notably by Ibn al-Muqaffa' (d. 757). These works, with their Arabic renderings, served
1 Noldeke, Dasiranisches Nationalepos, §13.
359



IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
as abasis for new recensions ofthe national history in Persian. All direct Arabic translations or Persian redactions of theKhwaddy-ndmag have been lost, but works based onthem byIslamic historians and Persian poets, chiefly from the 9th to the n t hcentury, survive. These are our main sources for a reconstruction of the later versions of the Iranian national history prior toIslam. The Avesta, theAchaemenian inscriptions and tablets, Middle Iranian inscriptions, ostraca, papyri, graffiti and coins all reflect elements of national history. The Zoroastrian Middle Persian (Pahlavi) literature, although surviving forthe most part in redactions ofthe 9th and 10th centuries, includes a good deal of historical, legendary and mythical material originating in more remote times.
The most important of the Islamic sources relevant to thestudy of the national history arethe"Annals" of Tabarl (d. 932) and the Shdhndma ("Book of Kings") of Firdausi (d. c. 1029). Of the early Arabic works, Tabari's " Annals " (Ta'nkh al-rusulwa'l-muluk)contain the fullest account of Iranian pre-Islamic history. Heemployed oral and written sources which reflect somewhat different traditions, and true to the method of early Islamic historians, he set them down unreconciled. Noldeke hasshown1 that among Tabari's sources was a work based on anArabic translation ofthe Khwaddy-ndmag^ one utilized also bythe anonymous author of the manuscript commonly called Springer 30. Bar ami's "History", completed in 962, is an abridged translation of Tabari into Persian which combines the different traditions of the Arabic original into amore homogeneous account. Itis not of particular historical interest except ina few instances such asthe stories ofGayomard and ofBahram Chobin, where Bal'aml has drawn on other sources to amplify Tabari's account.
Firdausl's Shdh-ndma (completed c. 1010) is based primarily on a Persian prose work which was compiled by order ofAbu Mansur 'Abd al-Razzaq Tusi,2 a noble who was a contemporary ofthe poet. Derived ultimately from Sasanian sources, the prose work incorporated not only the Khwaddy-ndmag (apparently forthe most part through Arabic translations orcompilations),3 but also a number ofhistorical fictions, many popular tales and legends, and a good deal ofSasanian writing intended only for edification or entertainment. Fortunately, Firdausi was not interested in abridging or curtailing his material. With his poet's taste

THE SOURCES
for a good story, he took full advantage ofhis sources and createdan epic poem ofgreat length and scope. As a historian, however, Firdausl lacks the relative precision ofTabari. He often confuses the scenesof events and is particularly laxconcerning names and numbers. As a poet, he wasinterested in literary effect rather than accuracy. And yet, owing to its sheer bulk and richness ofdetail, the Shdh-ndma remains the most important single source for the history of pre-Islamic Persia ina broad perspective.
The earliest Islamic historian togive a surviving account of Iranian history is Ya'qubi (2nd half of the 9th century). A sober historian of concise diction, in hiswork he almost wholly ignores pre-Sasanian history, which he deems rather implausible.1 He does, however, provide a systematic account of the Sasanian dynasty. His accurate report on Manl and Manichaeism,2 as well as his notice on themannersand customs of Zoroastrian Iran3 attest tohis careful selection of sources.
Ibn Qutaiba (d. 889),inhis manual al-Ma'drif, and Sa'id ibn Batriq (Eutychius), thePatriarch of Alexandria (d. 940), in his "Annals " follow a tradition somewhat different from that of Ya'qubi. These two authors, although independent of each other, agree not only in the content of their reports, but often also in turns of phrases and renderings of proper names. Noldeke concluded that they had used thesame source, and strongly suspected that this was Ibn al-Muqaffa°s translation ofthe Khwaddy-ndmag* This view is reinforced bythe fact that in his 'Uyun al-akhbdr (" Choice Reports"), which contains a number of references to Sasanian customs and institutions, Ibn Qutaiba shows himself familiar with the works of Ibn al-Muqaffa* and quotes in several instances from them.5
Still another version of Sasanian history is provided by Dinawari (d. 895)in his Akhbdr al-tiwdl Unlike Tabari, hehas blended all his sources into a single, unified account and does not allow the different elements to be seen separately. Theequation of early Iranian kings with Biblical figures - a common aberration ofMuslim historiographers -is presented by him as established fact. With his taste for the dramatic, he draws also onfictional sources, notably forthe stories of Alexander, Bahram Chobin and Shiroe.

important information on Iranian history in numerous passages of his
Muruj al-dhahab and Kitdb al-tanbih wcfl-ishrdf. His often accurate
knowledge of Zoroastrian lore and legend is impressive, and his references to some lost Middle Persian works arevaluable.1
The brief but important "Annals" {Sim mulilk al-ard wa'l-anbiya") of Hamza Isfahan!, written in 961,attest to the author's original research. His particular interest in Persian history and chronology leads him to express some valuable critical views on his sources, and to attempt, although notentirely successfully, to reconstruct Persian chronology. Hs also includes a description of the postures, the crowns, and the colours of the garb of the Sasanian kings as they appeared in thenow lost "Book ofthe Portraits of Sasanian Kings " (Kitdb suwarmuluk bam
Sdsdn).2
Maqdisi's "Book of the Beginnings and History" {Kitdb al-bady wayl-ta7nkh)> composed in 996, is a thematic andalmost encylopaedic work which includes some interesting observations on thebeliefs and customs ofpre-Islamic Persia. The author also devotes a chapter in the third volume to Persian history from Gayomard to Yazdgird III, treating the earliest kings and the later Sasanian monarchs more fully than other Iranian kings. Like Mas'udl, he occasionally reveals a separate tradition.
"The Chronology of Ancient Nations" {al-Athdral-bdqiya), written by Biruni in 1000, contains several lists ofIranian kings and their regnal years; it is particularly informative on time-reckoning, calendarsand festivals, as well as on the myths andbeliefs of different faiths. The author's searching mind andhis attempt to draw on native sources impart particular value to this work.
Tha'alibi's "Prime Reports on Persian Kings" {Ghurarakbbdr muluk al-Furs)y written c, 1019, gives a systematic account of Persian history and legend from the beginnings to the end ofthe Sasanian empire. It is based ona historical work which the author does not name but which must have been either the source used by Firdausl orone closely related to it. Although much shorter than the Shdh-ndma^ and differing from it in some minor details, Tha'alibi's history agrees with Firdausl's not only in its account of events but even in many rhetorical modes of expression.3 Like theShdh-ndma, it also incorporates a good many of the sayings, admonitions and discourses of the Sasanian kings.

THE SOURCES
Nihayat al-irab,by an anonymous author probably of the 11 th century, resembles the work of Dinawarl in its approach; generally, however, it gives a fuller account of events, particularly of the stories of Alexander and Bahram Chobln.
Among the early Persian histories, the Zain al-akhbdr by Gardizi (d. c. 1052) gives a straightforward but somewhat popular account of Iranian history without reference to sources. The interest of this chronicle lies mainly in a number of popular tales which it incorporates. Mujmal al-tawdrikh wayl-qisasy written in 1126, is based primarily on Hamza's "Annals", but also draws upon Tabari and Firdausi, among others. Although it hardly ranks as an original work, it is important for its quotations from sources now lost, and for recording a number of popular legends and stories.
Various local histories and geographies provide supplementary information. Among these the more pertinent are the following: Ibn alBalkhi's Fdrs-ndmay written in m i about the province of Fars, is prefaced by an account of traditional Persian history mainly based on Hamza and Tabari, but including also information not found in other sources; Tdrikh-i Sistdn ("History of Sistan"), an anonymous work of the n t h century with later additions, provides some popular tales about the ancient Sistanian heroes and the wonders of the province of Sistan; Tdrikh-i Bukhara,an abridged version in Persian by Muhammad b. Zufir of an original Arabic work by Muhammad Narshakhi written in 943, contains some interesting observations on the cult of Siyavush in Transoxiana; and Ibn Isfandiyar's Tdrikh-i Tabaristdn, written in 1216, preserves in Persian translation a valuable Middle Persian political tract, "The Letter of Tansar". The original letter, a product of the Sasanian period, is particularly instructive on social and political institutions of late Sasanian times and the way they were justified and defended.1 Later Arabic and Persian histories add little to our information on pre-Islamic Iran.2
Apart from historical writings, there existed in Sasanian times a number of works dealing with institutions, protocol, rules of proper conduct, the arts and entertainment. The general classification applied to such works was Ayin-ndwag3("Book of Rules [of Propriety]"). From an early date A'in-ndmag(s) were translated into Arabic, by Ibn al-Muqaffa', among others, and were adopted into Arabic and Persian

adab literature.1 Since much of the content of A'm-ndmags was related to the social and political organization and the religious and ethical ideals of Sasanian society, the inclusion ofthis material inIslamic writings is an important aid to clarification of some aspects of Iranian national history. Outstanding inthis genre are "The Book ofthe Crown" (Kitdb al-tdj), attributed toal-Jahiz; "Keys tothe Sciences" {Mafdtfh al-ulum) by Khwarazml; anda number of "mirrors for princes" in Persian, notably the Qdbus-ndma byKai Kavus b. Iskandar and Siyar al-Muliik (Siydsat-ndma) byNizam al-Mulk, both of the n t hcentury.
Of the Middle Persian Zoroastrian works (books in Pahlavi) the following are pertinent and ofparticular interest: the Denkard, a Zoroastrian encyclopaedic work composed in the 9th century, gives a summary of the lost books (nasks) of the Avesta as compiled in Sasanian times. It supplies important information derived from priestly literature concerning national history andlegends. (See pp. nyiff.) Books III and VII-IX are ofespecial interest in this respect. The Bundahishn, also called Zand-dgdhih,another c>th-century composition, is an important Zoroastrian work on thecreation, nature and whereabouts of earthly creatures and onthe Kayanian kings. A treasure-house of Zoroastrian lore, it preserves many ancient myths andlegends; several chapters toward the end ofthe book (i.e. chapters xxxii on the mansions erected by the Kayanian kings, xxxiii onthe calamities which befell the lands of Eranshahr, and xxxv onthe lineage of the Kayanian kings) have a direct bearing on the national history.2 The Vi^tdagthd 1Zddsparam covers in part the same ground as the Bundahishn and, like it, is based on theAvesta and its Pahlavi translation and commentary, the Zand, The account in the Vi^idagihd I Zddsparam of the creation, the legends of Zoroaster and some future saviours and heroes, and the restoration of the world at the endof time helps to elucidate certain religious aspects of the national history. The Zand i Vahman Yasht is a pieceof prophetic literature based on the lost Vahman Yasht and Sudgar Nask of the Avesta. It gives a continuous account ofthe Ages ofthe World, leading to the coming of the Saviour and the final triumph of good.3
Of a different nature is Ayddgdr 1 Zarerdn> anepic piece of literature in verse, which portrays the holy wars resulting from King Gushtasp's conversion tothe religion ofZoroaster. The work isimportant because

it provides a Middle Persian version of an episode recounted also by Firdausi and Tha'alibi, and because it throws light on the form and rhetorical conventions of Sasanian epics. Kdrndmag I Ardashir i Pdpagdn, & short book, is apparently an abridged version of a fuller popular account of the miraculous life of the founder of the Sasanian dynasty, of the birth and discovery of his son and successor Shapur I, and the latter's son Hurmazd. Probably composed towards the end of Sasanian times, it is a clear instance of the divergence of the popular from the more serious accounts of national heroes.1
As we have seen, for the latest redaction of the national historical tradition our main sources are the Islamic works based on the Khivaddyndmags and other late Sasanian writings. For the earliest version of Iranian mythical and legendary history, however, we must turn primarily to the Avesta, the holy scriptures of the Zoroastrians. The most significant section of the Avesta in this respect is the Yashts, a collection of hymns addressed to various Iranian deities. Although the composition of the Yashts in their extant form is later than Zoroaster, their content predates him, for they contain myths which the eastern Iranians had inherited from pagan times, as well as legends which reflect preZoroastrian heroic ages. The striking fact is that the general frame of the national historical tradition and the sequence of personages in it are already adumbrated in the Yashts. (See below, pp. 413 ff. for details.) Of the other sections of the Avesta, the first chapter of the Vendiddd ( Videvddd), which enumerates the Iranian lands created by Ahura Mazda and contaminated by Ahriman, and the second, which relates the myth of Yima and his subterranean fortress, are of particular interest for our purposes.
For probing into remoter times, when the Indo-Iranians had not yet come to a parting of ways, the hymns of the Rig- Veda^the most ancient literature of the Aryan Indians, generally held to have been composed in the second half of the 2nd millennium B.C., are of great importance. Many deities, mythical figures and possibly also some legendary ones are shared by the Avestan and Vedic people. A Vedic counterpart attests to the antiquity of an Avestan figure.
Some cuneiform documents of the 2nd millennium B.C. found in Egypt, Anatolia and Syria, also throw light on the early waves of migrant Indo-Iranians in the Near East and some of their deities and concepts (see below, p. 411).

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
Finally the study ofthe development ofthe national tradition greatly
benefits from foreign sources, among which Greek, Armenian and
Syriac are ofparticular importance.1
FEATURES OF THE NATIONAL HISTORY
The Iranian national history, asit isassumed to have been recorded in the Khwaday-ndwags, beginning with the beginnings, traced the history of the Iranian people from the first king, Gayomard, almost tothe end of the Sasanian period. It distinguished four periods marked by four dynasties: (i) thePishdadis (Pishdadians), theearly kings who ruled over the world and contributed to the progress of civilization bytheir teachings and institutions; (2) the Kayanis (Kayanians), who werethe kings of Iran proper andwho were in continual conflict with their neighbours, the Turanians; (3) the Ashkanis (Ashkanians, i.e. Arsacids), who headed a feudal system and allegedly presided over the dark ages of Iranian history; and (4) the Sasanis (Sasanians), who were presented as having restored unity and integrity toIran and as having established vigorous political, social and religious institutions.
Some of thefeatures of the national history as it evolved in late Sasanian times may be observed here. The first is that no distinction was made between thefactual, thelegendary, andthemythical. All three are blended in aunified whole, presented as acontinuous narrative of events. Thus, the account of the Pishdadians, mythical figures chiefly, was given in the same vein asthat ofthe Sasanians. The second is that the history of the Medes and theAchaemenians hadno place in the record. In fact, its authors displayed no appreciable knowledge of events in western and southern Iran before Alexander; it was an eastern tradition which formed thebasis of the early portion of this history. The third is its strong religious bias. Although its early part dated from pre-Zoroastrian times, and much ofit had its roots inIndoIranian consciousness, eventually it assumed a pronounced Zoroastrian colouring. For this quality the firm alliance between church and state in Sasanian times was largely responsible. The fourth is that it possessed no erato serve the chronology; it was thesuccession of kings which provided thechronological frame for events. There were some sixty kings and queens whoconstituted the hub of the narrative. The

HISTORICAL OUTLOOK
exploits ofvassal kings and heroes were subsumed under the reignsof their sovereigns, anarrangement which reflected the great power and prominence of the king ofkings inSasanian Iran. But since the national history combined and absorbed different strains of oral tradition and local legend which didnotalways fit into its general frame, oddities occurred, such as the continuance ofthe life ofthe warrior Zal through the reigns of some nine kings.
From a different viewpoint, the course ofthe national history may be divided into three parts, (i) The eraof the world-kings, from Gayomard to Fredon. As chiefly mythical figures ofconsiderable antiquity, these kings rule over man and beast alike. Their chief adversariesare the demons (devs),embodiments of evil and hindrances tomaterial wellbeing. (2) The heroic period, which begins with the uprising of Fredon (Faredon) against the tyrant Dahak and continues through the Kayanian dynasty. The overriding motif of history in this period is the long and bitter feud between theIranians and theTuranians. The underlying theme isthe defence ofthe Iranian kingdom (Eranshahr) inthe faceof Ahrimanic designs. All the calamities which befall Eranshahr, the chief of which are the invasions ofDahak, Afrasiyab and Arjasp, are seenas engineered .by the Evil Spirit and as part ofhis cosmic plan toharm the world ofAhura Mazda.1 This period is marked by the exploits of great warriors, chiefly from the houses of Karen, Sam, Naudhar and the Turanian house ofPashang. (3) The historical era, from Alexander onward. Like the first period, this lacks the unifying motif of the heroic period, butthe institution of kingship and its vicissitudes afford ita measure of cohesion, and a number of legends lend it attraction.
THE IRANIAN HISTORICAL OUTLOOK
In order to understand the form and character ofthe national history, we must first examine its premises. Applying the principles of Western historical criticism, which are the product of a different environment and different intellectual concerns, will beoflittle help inachievingan appreciation of the true purport ofIranian historiography. The Zoroastrian religion provides thebasic moral and intellectual foundations for a concept of history. This concept assigns to man a place in the universe and renders his past, present and future part of an all-embracing cosmic plan; it makes his actions significant and therefore worth

recording, and remembering; and it is not basically different from that of Judaism, Christianity and Islam insofar as itgives man an honourable place in thecommunity of creatures, andthrough hisrelations with God, helps him overcome his isolation and insignificance.1 But it goes beyond this by making him a relatively free andactive agent in the scheme ofthe universe. Man is created by Ahura Mazda fora purpose, and is united with the rest of the good world in acommon battle against the forces of evil.
The life ofthe world is limited; man operates within a defined span of time. This begins in the past with the onslaught ofAhriman onthe creation ofAhura Mazda, and continues for6,000 years, until the tan i pasin (lit. the Final Body), when the annihilation ofevil and the restoration of good is signalled by the coming of the Saviour.2 Men are susceptible to the corrupting temptations of Ahriman and his host of demons, but they are guided in the course of their lives by Ahura Mazda, the Holy Immortals (Amasa Spantas) and other divine beings, allsubordinate to Ahura Mazda. The community of men is led by kings, whose legitimacy depends on divine grace. This grace is symbolized by xvawnah (M.P. farrah, Pers. farr\ the kingly Fortune, which accompanies good rulers and assures their success.3 Kings are the guardiansof society and the authors ofits laws and institutions. History consists of the account of their deeds. A record of their actions, words and institutions would provide a history ofpolitical and social events, aswellas a history of ethical and intellectual postures. Asconceived in priestly circles, history does notconcern itself with the past alone; it also encompasses thefuture. The history of men is not separated from the history of the universe; rather, it isa part ofit and must beviewed in the context ofthe whole scheme ofcreation and of the development of cosmic events leading to the utter defeat of Ahriman. In this context, men are not the only agents of history; divine beings, the immortal souls ofthe dead (thefravalis), and the luminaries (sun, moon, stars) also affect the manner in which history unfolds.
The fact that the broad outlines of cosmic history were thought to have been determined at the very beginning of the world4 may have contributed to a relative absence of critical curiosity inIranian historiography. History was not conceived as a "discipline" tosatisfy a thirst for fact, nor were itsmethods attuned to such a purpose. History had

HISTORICAL OUTLOOK
primarily an edifying aim; in the hierarchiacal, conventional and conservative world of the Sasanian establishment, the purpose of history was to maintain and promote thenational and moral ideals of the state. Its authors were members of the scribal class, who, closely allied to the clergy and the nobles, served their interests and reflected their ideas. History was to teach therulers and ruling classes thevirtues of abiding by the dictates of"the good religion", ofrendering justice tothe people and of making theland prosper. To thepeople it taught thevirtues of unswerving loyalty to the kings and of observing "lawand order". Innovations were to be mistrusted, unless they were beneficial ones instituted bya good king. History was, then, aneducational instrument of social stability and cohesion. It was intended tostrengthen a common heritage and topromote a common ideal. It was toteach its readers love of their homeland and pride in their ancestry. It held theexalted life of the heroes ofthe Iranian past before their eyes asmodels tobeemulated. It incorporated inits pages the wisdom ofthe sages, andargued against the ideas andpractices which were thought to be harmful (such as the teachings ofManl and Mazdak, viewed asheresies bythe Zoroastrians). Thus the historiographer, far from being an impartial investigator of facts, was an upholder andpromoter of the social, political andmoral values cherished by the Sasanian elite.
To achieve its social role, history hadto be readable andpersuasive. In its earlier stages, when it was transmitted by oral tradition, it assumed rhetorical features which were preserved even when history was committed to writing. The irrelevance ofdistinction between fact, myth and legend has already been noted (p. 366); each could equally well serve the same cultural purpose. Very often literary devices, such as metaphor and hyperbole, were employed to reinforce the impact of narration. Much of Iranian history, based on heroic poetry, preserved its epic quality. It was depicted with broad brush strokes and bold colours, and details notsignificant to the main purpose ofthe story or detrimental to its emotive force were ignored. Popular tales had little difficulty in entering the domain of history andobtaining the right of citizenship. The authors of the historical works which served as the sources of Tha'alibi and Firdausi had, in all probability, followed the Sasanian tradition in bringing together a narration of the Persian past in which the theme was historical butthe method largely literary. In the handsof Firdausi, who understood the character and direction ofPersian historical writing, Iranian history developed into a literary masterpiece. In

A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE NATIONAL HISTORY
It will be useful at this point to give a brief summary of the national history as conceived in late Sasanian times andreconstructed, withdue reservations, from post-Sasanian sources. In view of the frequent ambiguity and variation of the Middle Persian forms of proper names, their Persian form asregistered inthe Shdh-ndma - with the majhulvowels e and o duly registered - will be generally adopted, except when the Shdh-ndma form is anArabic one, or when a different form has appeared advisable on other grounds: thus Gayomard, Dahak andKavad rather than Kayomarth, Dahhak and Qubadh.1 It should benoted that there is considerable variation to be found in the regnal years andthe genealogies of the kings of the first two dynasties. Not all such variations, however, can be attributed to the Islamic period. Many of them obviously originated in Sasanian Persia as a result of varying oral traditions, and some are due to interpretive differences, such astaking a king's life-span for theyears of his rule.
The national history begins with the reign of Gayomard, the first world-king, who reigns over men and beasts for 30years, according to most accounts. He resides first in the mountains andwears a leopard skin. Firdausl relates only this version, but some other sources have also preserved anaccount ofGayomard according tothe religious tradition. This account, of which we find the fullest version in the Bundahishn,2 describes Gayomard not as the first king, but as the prototype of man, brought forth by Ahura Mazda at the sixth stage of creation. He suffers injuries in the course of Ahriman's onslaught and dies 30 years later. From his seed, after its purification by the sun,grows a rhubarb plant, out of which develop Mashya andMashyana, the first mortal man andwoman, corresponding to Adam and Eve.3

BRIEF SUMMARY
other sources,1 is slain by demons andis duly avenged by Hoshang.2 Hoshang, reckoned as Siyamak's son by Firdausi and as his grandsonby most other sources,3 bears the title of Pishdad. With himbegins the Pishdadian dynasty. Possessing thefarrah, he is a powerful king, who subdues Ahriman andhis demons andreigns over theworld for forty years. He succeeds in extracting metal from rock, devises a means of drawing water from rivers in order to cultivate theland and is thefirst to tame animals and build houses. Healso incidentally discovers fire by hitting a stone against a rock while attempting to kill a serpent, and he institutes thefestival of Sada in commemoration of this discovery.4
Hoshang is followed by Tahmdrath, a sonof Hoshang according to Firdausi, a sonof Vlvanghan anda descendant of Hoshang according to other sources.5 Tahmorath subjugates all the demons andrides far and wide on the back of Ahriman, whom he has transformed into a horse. Hereigns for 30years (or40according to some accounts). Like Hoshang, heimproves thematerial culture of the world. Heis thefirst to spin wool for clothing, to use dogs to protect flocks, to employ falcon andhound for hunting, to tame fowls and to exploit beasts of burden. Hecaptures hosts of demons, who, to seek hisfavour, release to him the secret of writing. It is during his reign that the Buddha Buddsaf) appears.
Tahmorath is succeeded by his brother Jamshed, one of the most colourful figures of Iranian myth. Herules with great glory over men and demons for over 600 years and further promotes thematerial wellbeing of the human race by teaching people how to fashion metal weapons, to spin andweave silk, cotton and flax, to mine gold and silver, to produce perfumes andspices, andto erect houses and bathhouses with stones hewn from quarries. Hedivides the people into four classes according to their profession: clergy, warriors, scribes and artisans, traders and farmers. In his realm of seven climes happiness reigns and, bythegrace of the farrah, evil, oldage, sickness, envy and extremes of weather are banished. Atthe height of his power he orders the demons to build a carriage in which he rises into the skies. He commemorates the event by instituting Nau Ruz, the New Year festival,

at the vernal equinox. His power and success, however, fill him with pride. Seduced byAhriman, heproclaims himself divine, whereupon the farrah departs from him, leaving him vulnerable to the attack of a monstrous tyrant, Dahak, who seizes thefugitive Jamshed andhas him sawn inhalf. A sorcerer and an agent of Ahriman, Dahak was descended from
Siyamak on his father's side, buthis mother haddemonic lineage.1
He captured the throne ofJamshed, married his two sisters (and wives),2 and continued hisoppressive rule for a thousand years. He had many people slain in order to feed their brains to two serpents which had
grown on his shoulders. Eventually, his tyranny enraged Kava,3 asmith who had lost all but one ofhis sons toDahak's serpents. Kava leads a popular rebellion which precipitates the despot's fall. The smith's leather apron, which heuses asa banner, is later adorned, bejewelled and chosen as the Iranian national flag and a symbol of Iranian suzerainty.
Fredon, a descendant of Jamshed raised in secret forfear of Dahak and graced with the farrah, isnow sought out and proclaimed king. He invades Dahak's palace, frees thetwo beauties of whom Dahak had deprived Jamshed, defeats the tyrant with hisbull-headed mace and,
following the advice ofSurosh, the messenger of God,4 chains himon Mount Demavand. Thus, the kingship is restored to its rightful claimant and peace and prosperity reigns once more over the world. In order to forestall possible future clashes, Fredon divides his world-empire during his own life-time among his three sons. He gives the western lands to Salm, his eldest son, the north and the east, namely Turan and China, to Tur, butthe central clime (Khwanlrah), which includes Eranshahr, hegives tohis youngest and favourite son, Eraj. This apportionment rouses the jealousy and rancour ofthe elder brothers, who conspire to murder Eraj. The slaying ofthe noble Eraj at the hand ofTur grieves Fredon deeply and lays the foundation for a bitter, bloody and protracted feud between theroyal houses of Iran and Turan. With Fredon's division of his kingdom, the era of worldkings comes to anend.

BRIEF SUMMARY
dant ofEraj's daughter, whom Fredon had reared, eventually ascends the throne. Helped byhis general Karen, a son of Kava the smith, Manuchihr tracks down and kills both Tur and Salm in battle, thus avenging Eraj's blood and freeing the Iranians from shame.
The feud intensifies, however, with the advent of Afrasiyab, who invades Eranshahr during the reign of Manuchihr,1 defeats the Iranian army and forces it to retreat. Peace is achieved when the two sides agree to have an arrow shot from the Caspian province ofTabaristan and to consider the point of its landing as the border between Iran and Turan. Arish, the best bowman of Iran, shoots the arrow; helped by divine guidance, it flies for awhole dayand atsunset lands by the River Oxus. This boundary Afrasiyab reluctantly accepts asthe common frontier.2 In the reign of Naudhar, the sonand successor of Manuchihr, Afrasiyab undertakes a fierce campaign against Iran. Merciless battles ensue and a number of leading warriors from both sides arekilled. Karen, the general ofthe Iranian army, and Zal, the vassal king ofSistan, Vesa, a brother of Afrasiyab and the general of the Turanian arny, and Barman, a Turanian hero, all distinguish themselves. In the end, however, Afrasiyab triumphs. He defeats, captures and slays Naudhar, lays the country waste, and occupies the Iranian throne. Inafitofrage he also kills his own brother Aghrerath, a noble warrior who shows sympathy for the Iranian cause. The country does not recover until much later, when Zab,a prince ofroyal blood, isproclaimed king. Zab is assisted in his successful campaign against Afrasiyab by the formidable warrior Karshasp, who is variously named a predecessor, helper, co-ruler, or successor of Zab.
Under Manuchihr the exploits ofthe heroic vassal kings of Sistan, headed by Sam and followed inturn by his son Zal and his grandson, the redoubtable Rustam, begin to unfold. ToSam, the chief warrior (jihan-pahlavany 2£Manuchihr's court, a white-haired son,Zal, is born. Disappointed and shamed by his appearance, Samabandons him in the wilderness. Slmurgh, the miraculous bird, takes Zal to its nest on a mountain peak and rears him with its own young. When Zal is grown, the bird returns him to his father, who,torn by remorse and prompted by a prophetic dream, isnow searchingforhim.

The son grows into a matchless warrior and a staunch supporter of the throne. Afascinating and adventurous romance leads tohis marriage with Rodaba, the daughter ofMihrab, king of Kabul and a descendant of Dahak. The fruit of this marriage is Rustam, whose feats of valour eventually make himthe predominant figure of the Persian national epic. Repeatedly he strikes terror into the heart ofthe Turanian armies and on more than one occasion he defeats Afrasiyab and his foremost warriors. Twice he restores King Kavus to his throne andsaves the country from imminent disaster. His matchless steed, Rakhsh, isas distinguished among its kind as Rustam is among men. Rustam's fabulous life-span stretches almost to the end of the Kayanian dynasty. The best-known episodes of his career arehisexploits at the" Seven Stations" {Haft Khwdn) during hisjourney to Mazandaran in order to rescue King Kavus, an undertaking which culminates in his slaying the fearsome White Dev; hisdefeat and dispatch of the heroic young Prince Isfandiyar, with help from the bird Simurgh; and his inadvertent slaying in single combat of his own extraordinary son, Suhrab, whom he fails to recognize. The last two episodes are the substance of two of the most moving tragedies recounted by Firdausi.
After aninterregnum following the reign of Zab, the nobles offer their allegiance toKai Kavad, aprince ofroyal blood, who wages w^ar against Afrasiyab anddoes much to rebuild Eranshahr. With KaiKavad, a new dynasty, theKayanian, is established, all of whose members are graced with the farrah, and whose names are preceded bythe title Kai " k i n g " (hence Kayan, "kings").
Kai Kavad's two immediate successors, Kai Kavus and Kai Khusrau areof particular renown. The reign of Kavus, an ambitious, petulant andunpredictable ruler with a mean streak in his nature, is marked by many wars andadventures. He makes an ill-advised foray into the territory of Mazandaran, where, according to Firdausi, he is defeated andmade captive.1 He is eventually set free only by the arduous efforts of Rustam. Onanother occasion he makes an ill-fated attack on Hamavaran (i.e. Himyar in Yemen), only to be defeated and rescued again byRustam. The demons grow active under him and plot the murder of his wise andpious vizier, Oshnar. While Kavus is a prisoner in Hamavaran, Afrasiyab usurps his throne.2 But Kavus's arrogance isnot diminished by defeat ordisaster. He makes the demons

BRIEF SUMMARY
build him a fortified city with marvellous edifices.1 Drunk with power and aided by the demons, he seeks to rise into the sky(according to Firdausi2 and Tha'alibl,3 in a carriage flown by four eagles), but is overthrown andbrought back to earth andto hissenses.
Of chief importance in Kavus's reign, however, aretheevents which lead to a feud between Iran and Turan even more ferocious than before. Sudaba, a daughter of an alien king4 and a wife of Kavus, is infatuated with Siyavush, thefavourite sonof the king. Rebuffed by the virtuous prince, she accuses him before his father of having made amorous advances toward her. The prince is called upon to prove his innocence by an ordeal by fire. Hepasses through this unharmed. Then he volunteers to lead an expedition against Turan in order to avoid thewiles of his detractor. Afrasiyab, however, cautioned by a bad dream, agrees to Siyavush's conditions for peace and war becomes unnecessary. But Kavus is outraged at thenews and orders Siyavush to forgo peace, to send the hostages to the Iranian court, and to fight Afrasiyab to the end. Holding a breach of his agreement to be impossible, Siyavush sends his army back to Iran, while he himself, persuaded by Plran, a noble general and cousin of Afrasiyab, takes refuge with theTuranian king, who treats him regally and gives him his daughter, Vasfafrld,5 in marriage. He enjoys the king's favour for a while, and builds the marvellous castle Kang Dez, averitable paradise on earth. Some Turanian princes envy the brilliance ofSiyavush and plot against him; a suspicious Afrasiyab eventually orders himto be slain. News of the death causes unprecedented rage at the Iranian court, and Kavus suffers harsh criticism from the nobles for his rash treatment of his crown prince. According to Firdausi, Rustam slays Sudaba in retaliation and vows vengeance forthe prince's blood. AnIranian punitive expedition drives Afrasiyab from his country for a time.
The pleadings of Plran save the pregnant wife of Siyavush, andPiran brings up her son, Kai Khusrau. The news of Kai Khusrau's birth revives hope for vengeance among theIranians, andKavus dispatches Gev, the able son of Godarz and one ofthe king's outstanding generals, to find the prince and bring him to Iran. After a hazardous journey,Kai Khusrau is successfully led to theIranian court; he proves his worth,

and frustratets theclaims to kingship of two princely generals, Tus and Gustahm; his accession as king is announced in Kavus's lifetime. Helped by a host ofdistinguished warriors, among whom are Rustam, Godarz and thelatter's many sons, headed by thevaliant Gev,Kai Khusrau invades Turan. After some initial reverses, inwhich the house of Godarz suffers heavy losses, andthen a long series of wars,the Iranian army defeats Afrasiyab utterly and forces him to flee. Gev, however, succeeds in finding and capturing him, and Kai Khusrau puts him to death, thus closing a fateful chapter ofIrano-Turanian feuds. Kai Khusrau, famed forhis wisdom and valour, comes toa strange end. After Afrasiyab's death he turns away from the affairs of the world and gives himself up tomeditation and prayer. He indicates Luhrasp, a distant relative, as his successor before he disappears mysteriously. Luhrasp fulfills Kai Khusrau's expectations in protecting theIranian boundaries and ruling wisely until, advanced in age, he retires from the throne, leaving it tohis ambitious son, Gushtasp. It isduring the reign of Gushtasp that Zoroaster proclaims his religion. Gushtasp embraces the new faith and joins the prophet inproselytizing. Outraged at what
he considers a betrayal of the oldfaith, Arjasp, theking of Turan,1 invades Iran and inflicts heavy losses onthe house of Gushtasp. The king's devoted and valorous brother Zarer perishes at the hand of Bidarafsh, Arjasp's brother, during a terrible battle. Zarer's blood is
avenged by his young son,Bastur.2 With the help of Isfandiyar, Gushtasp's eldest son and crown prince, Bastur defeats the Turanian army, killing Bidarafsh and many others ofroyal blood.
Later, Gushtasp becomes suspicious of Isfandiyar's ambitionsand has him imprisoned, but anew and devastating onslaught by Arjasp,in the course of which Luhrasp is putto death, forces theking to free Isfandiyar and seek his help against the Turanians. He promises Isfandiyar the throne, should hebevictorious. Isfandiyar duly defeats the Turanian army, frees his two captive sisters, retrieves the national standard, and slays Arjasp along with many of his kin. Itis inthe course of this merciless retaliation that Isfandiyar performs hisfamous feats of strength andcourage called, like those of Rustam, "The Seven Stations". Gushtasp, however, demurs at bestowing the kingdom on his victorious son, making the further condition that Isfandiyar

BRIEF SUMMARY
journey to Sistan and bring Rustam back in fetters to the court. (Gushtasp claims that Rustam has failed topay his respects tothe crown for some time.) This task places the young warrior inadifficult position. He is suspicious of his father's motives and has little liking for the command that pits him against the invincible warrior, but his pride and ambition persuade him to take upthe challenge. Rustam refuses gently but firmly Isfandiyar's demand that hereturn to court asa prisoner and repeatedly attempts to induce theprince to follow a friendlier course; to noavail, however, forthe proud prince insists oneither submission or battle. A series of single combats follow, inwhich Isfandiyar proves a formidable andat times superior match for theoldwarrior. At last Rustam, aided by the bird Simurgh, succeeds in inflicting a mortal arrow-wound on theyoung hero.
Shortly afterward, Rustam is killed through the stratagems ofan envious and embittered brother, leaving his provinces a prey for Bahman, theson of Isfandiyar, who has succeeded Gushtasp and seeks revenge for theslaying of his father. Bahman overruns and plunders Rustam's province, Zabul, and kills Rustam's brother and son. Accord
ing to another tradition1 he also kills Zaland Rustam. Bahman is succeeded by his daughter Humay, whom he hadtaken as his wife, and whobears hima son,Dara(b). Bahman's other son Sasan, disenchanted with his father's preference for his sister, leaves the court and embarks ona life ofwandering. Eventually Dara ascends the throne and issucceeded inturn by his son Dara the Younger, who is defeated byAlexander the Great and killed inbattle. According to genuine Iranian tradition, Alexander destroyed the integrity of the Iranian empire by undermining the authority of its kings and dividing the land among feudatory lords. Further, he ruined fire temples, killed Zoroastrian priests and destroyed their manuscripts, transferring Persian science andphilosophy to Rum (Greece). On the other hand, the legendary life of Alexander, written by the pseudoCallisthenes sometime before the 4th century, was translated into Middle Persian during the 6th century, and its content, with some modifications, was later adopted into thebody of Iranian historical tradition. In the Iranian form of the romance, Alexander becomes a sonof Dara I and a half brother of his adversary, DaraII.
According to this version, betrayed andmortally wounded by two of his own officers, Dara asks Alexander toavenge his blood and marry

his daughter, Raushanak. Alexander obliges, and then sets out to conquer other lands. He undertakes many adventures, including the search for the fountain ofeternal life inthe kingdom ofdarkness. Concerned about the future ofhis realm and the possible uprising ofthe Iranians, he divides Eranshahr among kinglets (muliik al-tawa>ify "tribal kings"), thus sowing the seed ofdisunity and barring the rise topower of any single dominant ruler.
Iranian historiography knows little about the Seleucids. Tabarl has a mere fleeting reference to Seleucus and Antiochus, cited from Hisham Kalbi.1 The Arsacids, with their loosely knit and decentralized form of government, were considered heirs to Alexander. For some 266 years this allegedly alien feudatory system prevailed and provincial kings ruled over the country. Among these kings, however, a branch called the Ashkanls (Arsacids), which ruled over western and central Iran and succeeded in controlling Babylonia, was held in great respect by the other kings, according toIslamic sources. Their primacy among local princes was recognized without their being in aposition to appoint or dismiss regional rulers. Alist ofsome eleven Arsacid kings is given by most Islamic historians with brief and generally empty accountsof their reigns (see below). Ardavan isgiven as the last as well as the most important Arsacid king. It is against this Ardavan that Ardashir Papagan, avassal king in Fars and the founder ofthe Sasanian dynasty, rose in rebellion.
Ardashir was from the house ofSasan, son ofBahman and therefore a descendant of the Kayanians. He made it his goal to unite the country and restore its Kayanian unity and greatness. His ancestor, Sasan, had chosen a pastoral life. According to Tabarl,2 Sasan the Younger, Ardashir's grandfather and an able warrior, was in charge of a fire temple inStakhr, dedicated tothe goddess Anahlt. This Sasan married the beautiful daughter ofthe Bazrangi king ofFars and she gave birth to Papag. As ayoung man, Papag had a vision of his destiny, and worked his way up tosecure the Bazrangi crown for himself. His son Ardashir took up arms against Ardavan inpursuit of a still more ambitious goal. Ardashir finally defeated and killed Ardavan, placing his foot on the great king's head as a symbol of his utter victory. Then he assumed the title of "King of kings ' (Shdhdnshdh)> and embarked ona systematic overthrow of the Arsacid princes.3 A series of further conquests secured many other provinces and led to the formation of a large empire extend

ing from the limits of Greater Khurasan to Syria. He received the allegiance of the kings of Kushan and other outlying territories. Towards the end ofhis life hecrowned his son Shapur, and retired from the throne to a life of meditation and prayer.
A paragon of valour and wisdom, Ardashir organized the country and its administration on a sound basis, regularized the affairs of the four estates, and revived inIran the study ofphilosophy and the sciences which Alexander had suppressed. He also built a great many cities (mostly in Khiizistan and Mesopotamia) and founded and endowed many fire temples. He was aided by an able vizier, Abarsam, anda sagacious counsellor, Tansar (orTosar). Ardashir issued many epistles containing his social andpolitical views, andleft a famous testament on good government and personal conduct for hisson Shapur.1
The accounts of other Sasanian kings follow in broad outlines the course of events as it is known from other sources, but there areconsiderable differences of emphasis, andtherefore the total picture has a different colouring and orientation. Inhis account ofthe Sasanian kings, the Iranian historiographer directs his attention to several themes: the king's lineage; his upbringing; his major military undertakings; his endeavours for the prosperity of the realm (cultivation of the land, building of cities, canals, dams, bridges and fire temples); his piety, justice and personal conduct; his administrative measures; his pleasures; his counsels and words of wisdom; and his regnal years. Ofcourse, not all these points arecovered for each king. In fact, in thecase of minor kings information is meagre and there is a rather disproportionate concentration onthe major kings, or those who had captured through their deeds theimagination of the people. Typically, Firdausi provides very little factual data on thesixkings between Shapur I andShapur II, and it is mostly their discourses and admonitions which he cites. The Sasanian kings who are treated at greater length are Ardashir, Shapur I and Shapur II, Yazdgird I, Bahram V, Peroz, Kavad, Khusrau I, Hurmazd IV, Khusrau II, Shiroy, andYazdgird III. In theaccount of their lives we find fact and fancy mingled, a good many legends and stories being attached to their biographies. Some ofthese may benoted here briefly.
Upon Ardavan's demand, theyoung Ardashir is sent to hiscourt to be educated and brought up with Ardavan's children. But through

Ardashir and the maiden plot their escape and set out at night. Ardavan rides in pursuit of them, but loses hope when hehears that the farrah in the form of a ram has joined Ardashir.1 (The story isa recasting ofan ancient legend also attached to Cyrus.2)
Ardashir kills Ardavan andvows not to leave a single soul from Ardavan's house alive. When Ardashir discovers that a girl whomhe has inadvertently married, is Ardavan's daughter3 (or his cousin4 or the daughter of Farrukhan, another Arsacid prince)5 who had been brought upin obscurity, heis outraged and orders his vizier Abarsam to execute her. Learning that the girl is pregnant, Abarsam hidesher in the basement of his house, andthereafter rears her child, a son, Shapur. Years later, Ardashir, who remains childless, confides his contrition to his vizier, who thereupon reveals to the king that hehas no cause forregret. But before Abarsam brings Shapur to the king,he asks him toopen abox which he had left with the king when the princess was placed in his charge. In the box is Abarsam's severed manhood as proof of his honour.6 According to theKdrndmag version,7 however, Ardavan's daughter tries topoison Ardashir, but she is discovered and is entrusted to thehigh priest to receive herpunishment. The high priest hides her and brings up Shapur.8
During Shapur I's military expedition to the east, the ruler of Hatra makes incursions into Mesopotamia, inflicting ruin onthe land. Upon his return, Shapur lays seige to Hatra, but the fortress proves impregnable. At length, the ruler's daughter, who has fallen in love with Shapur, extracts apromise of marriage from him and betrays the citadel; Shapur then conquers the city and lays itwaste. At the nuptials he learns of the great care and kindness that his bride's father had lavished upon her, whereupon Shapur orders thegirl to beputto death for her ingratitude. (See below, p.401.)

BRIEF SUMMARY
forewarned byastrologers that a descendant of Mihrak is to inherithis throne, Ardashir seeks to uproot Mihrak's house. Mihrak's daughter, however, has taken refuge with shepherds. Ardashlr's son Shapur meets her one day after a hunting expedition, when thirst drives him to her village. Headmires herbeauty and takes herfor hiswife, overcoming her frightened reluctance to marry him bypromising that hewill keep her lineage secret. Butat a children's polo game their son, Hurmazd, attracts Ardashlr's attention by demonstrating unwonted boldness when he rushes towards the king to retrieve a ball. Ardashir is also struckby the resemblance of Hurmazd to himself. Shapur is forced to revealthe truth, andArdashir is relieved by the turn the astrologer's prophecy has taken.
Shapur II showed clear signs ofwisdom even as a child. For instance, he solved the problem ofcrowding and confusion onone ofthe bridges near the palace byordering the construction of another bridge, so that one might serve thepeople coming from one direction, andtheother the people going in the opposite direction. Yazdgird the Sinner was suspicious, oppressive and particularly hard on the nobles, who were united in their hatred of him. They prayed to God forrelief. One day when the king was inGurgan, anexcellent, rare horse appeared near theroyal tent. No onesucceeded in breaking it, yet the horse submitted readily tothe king. As the king was caressingit,
the horse kicked him fatally,1 thus putting an end to his tyranny. People believed that the horse was in fact anangel of God. After Yazdgird's death, the nobles barred his children from the throne and proclaimed as their king Khusrau, adescendant of Ardashir I. At that time Yazdgird's son, Bahram Gor, was staying with Mundhir, the vassal king ofHira. AtBahram Gor's birth his father was informed by court astrologers that while the child would indeed ascend the throne, he would be brought up in a foreign land. Yazdgird hadsent him to Hira, where he received a thorough education in the arts of riding, warfare andhunting, as well as in philosophy andthe literary arts. He performed many feats of strength and dexterity as a young prince. Inone instance, he shot a lion and awild ass with the same arrow
killing both at a single stroke.2 In another instance, dared bya female

companion, heproposed to " s e w " together the ear and foot of a deer with anarrow. First heshot anarrow which barely touched thedeer's ear. When the deer then scratched its ear, he letflyanother arrow, which "sewed" its foot and ear together.1 When he heard of the rally to Khusrau, hemarched with Mundhir tothe capital, claiming his father's crown. The nobles were duly impressed with his handsome looks,his eloquence andhispromise to avoid theways of his father. Butwhat eventually decided the outcome wasBahrain's physical prowess. He proposed that the crown beplaced between two hungry lions and that whoever wasable to carry it off should be declared king. Khusrau deferred to him, and Bahram, after killing the lions, took possession of the crown.2
Bahram was given to the pleasures of the hunt, ofmerrymaking and of love. The Khaqan of the Turks3 took advantage of this levity; he invaded theeastern provinces andthreatened to overrun thecountry. The nobles, in despair lest Bahram fail them, began to make advances to the Khaqan inself-protection. But they had underestimated Bahrain's ability andresolve. Ostensibly going on a hunting expedition, along with the traditional hounds and falcons4, hesetout toward Azerbaijan with a select corps of fighters, paid homage to the sacred fire Azargushnasp, marched toward Armenia, and then turned toward Khurasan via the Caspian provinces with utmost speed. Descending upon the Khaqan in a surprise attack, he killed him, took hiswife and family prisoner and captured much booty, astounding even his own peopleby his skill and courage.
Among the stories told ofsubsequent Sasanian kings are those of the ingenious tricks played by theHephthalites on Peroz, leading to his defeat anddeath; thestory of Kavad's marriage, in thecourse of his flight to theeast, to the daughter of a noble farmer {dehgdri) only to find later, to hispleasant surprise, that she (the mother of Khusrau I) was a descendant ofFredon; several anecdotes about the administration of justice by Khusrau I, his fairness and his severity; a number ofstories about Khusrau's wise counsellor Buzurgmihr: how he solved the riddle of chess (agame devised by an Indian king and presented tothe Iranian court), how hedevised the game ofbackgammon {nard)asa counter to the Indian challenge and how he solved riddles presented by the

CHRONOLOGY
Byzantine emperor; aseries of yarns told of Bahram Chobin, the general who rebelled against his king, Hurmazd IV, and incidents concerning Gurdoya, Bahram's sister; stories about the fabulous wealth of Khusrau II, the splendour ofhis court, his treasures, his famous horse Shabdez, his musicians, and hislove for Shlrln, which has been thesubject of numerous romances in Persian literature; and finally the somewhat fictionalized account ofKhusrau IFs trial, imprisonment and execution by order ofhis son, Shiroy. All these stories are brought together in the Shdh-ndma. Although probably some of them did not figure in the Khwaddy-ndmag, they can give anidea of the kinds of stories that were woven around the kings' lives, and also of the element of entertainment in the national history.1
CHRONOLOGY OF THE NATIONAL HISTORY
There is a great deal of variation in Islamic sources as to the regnal years of the Iranian kings from Gayomard to Kai Kavad - a fact that drew comments from the astronomer Abu Ma'shar of Balkh(d. A.D. 886) and rightly baffled the historian Hamza of Isfahan. According to Hamza,2 Abu Ma'shar attributed the confusion to several uncertain periods of interregnum in Iranian history. Henotes, forinstance,the gap of more than 170 years between Gayomard and Hoshang, the unspecified number of years following Afrasiyab's withdrawal from Iran subsequent tohis reign of 12 years there, and again the years between Zab and Kai Kavad. The basic chronological scheme, which must have prevailed also inthe Khwaddy-ndmag, can, however, be easily established. By all accounts thethird millennium of the "mixed state" after the attack of Ahriman began with Fredon and ended with the conversion of Gushtasp inthe thirtieth year ofhis reign. The second millennium was taken up entirely by Dahak's rule, which, according to all sources, lasted 1,000 years. The first millennium then comprised the reign ofthe earlier kings from Gayomard toand including Jamshed. It appears that originally Jamshed, who, asthe first man, must have headed the listof kings, also reigned for 1,000 years. This situation isalready indicated in Yasht 17.30 and confirmed by the Vendiddd 2.20, which gives Jamshed three times 300 years before he began building the Var. The missing 100 years may have been the time needed tobuild the Var, or possibly his 100 years in exile. But in thescheme which was worked out by

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
Zoroastrian priests, the first millennium began with Ahriman's attack under the zodiacal sign ofLibra and was divided as follows. Gayomard was given 30 years, i.e., the same number ofyears that hewas allowed to live on after he had been wounded by Ahriman. For 40 years his seed remained hidden in the earth, before the rhubarb plant grew and produced the first couple. After 50 years without marital union the couple began to have offspring - thus far a total of 120 years. Hoshang ruled for 40 years and Tahmorath for 30, the same number which had already been mentioned inYasht 19.29 asthe number ofyears that Tahmorath rode on Ahriman. Jamshed was given 616 or616| years1 before Dahak overwhelmed him, andanother 100 years as a fugitive from Dahak. These periods total 906 or 906J years, andtherefore an interregmun of 94 or93\ years was assigned tothe gap between the birth ofthe first offspring ofthe first couple and Hoshang tomake atotal of 1,000 years and the first millennium of the mixed state.2 This is the scheme given in the Bundahishn xxxvi, and theone that emerges from the preferred accounts of Blruni, 103, and Hamza,64.
The First Millennium of the "Mixed State"
Years
Gayomard 30 His seed hidden in the earth 40 The first couple without progeny 50 Progeny of the first couple toHoshang 94/93 i Hoshang 40 Tahmorath 30
Jamshed 6 I 6 / 6 I 6 £
Jamshed inexile 100 Total 1000
With the weakening of Zoroastrian traditions and its millennial reckonings in Islamic times, the chronology of the early kings became the subject of considerable confusion, so that often thesame author, confronted with varying versions, gave different accounts ofthe regnal years of the same ruler. Part of the confusion nodoubt is due to variations which must go back to pre-Islamic times. It would hardly be plausible to think that Sasanian sources presented a uniform chronological table. Besides, the oral transmission ofhistory with its multiple origins continued through Sasanian and, indeed, post-Sasanian times and made for variants of different kinds. It would be reasonable to

CHRONOLOGY
believe, however, that the semi-official version of Iranian history, the Khwaday-ndmag^ which bore the imprint of Khusrau Fs reforms, had broadly adopted the chronology given above. Hoshang's regnal years may have already been given in the Sasanian Avesta or its commentaries, but no definite proof exists to this effect. The regnal years of Jamshed look arbitrary and difficult to explain, but if we start from the assumption that his years were determined by subtracting a number of life-spans and reigning years from i ,000, an easy explanation ensues. It must be assumed, as noted above, that the 94/93 \ interposed years covered the generations between Mashya and Hoshang, namely Fravak and Siyamak. It would have been unnatural to assign specific years to the first couple and to Hoshang, but not to the generations between them. We must assume that these details simply have not survived in our sources. Christensen's view that the 93£ years were agreed upon by first deciding on 616 years for Jamshed's reign1 (for which no internal explanation can be given) cannot be maintained.
The entire second millennium is taken up by the reign of Dahak. The third millennium of the "mixed state" begins under the zodiacal sign of Sagittarius with the rule of Fredon. The regnal years in this millennium, following the listing of the Bundahishn xxxvi. 7 (which is reflected also in the Islamic sources), are as follows:
The Third Millennium of the "Mixed State "
Years Fredon 500 Manuchihr (including the 12 years of Afrasiyab's rule in Iran) 120 Zab 5 Kai Kavad 15 Kavus 150 Kai Khusrau 60 Kai Luhrasp 120 Kai Gushtasp, until his conversion 30 Total 1000
The above divisions of the millennial scheme must be the result of priestly schematizing, as can be seen from the fact that Gushtasp's conversion marks the beginning of a millennium, and that the Kayanians, despite their prominence, do not have a millennium to themselves. Rather, they are uncomfortably put together with Fredon and his Pishdadian successors.
The next three millennia of the "mixed state", which take us to the end of the world, each begins with a holy figure: Zoroaster, Hoshedar,

and Hoshedarmah, thelast twobeing Zoroaster's future sons.1 The world will end when the Sosyant, the third son ofthe prophet, appears towards the end ofthe 6th and last millennium (i.e. the12th if we take into account the millennia ofthe spiritual (menog) state and the creation of the tangible world(getzg)). The 4thmillennium was conceived as encompassing thehistory of the world from Gushtasp's conversion tothe coming ofHoshedar, the first Saviour. It begins under therule of Capricorn and is divided as follows:
The Fourth Millennium of the " Mixed State "
Years Gushtasp, after conversion 90 Bahman, son ofIsfandiyar 112 Humay Chihrazad 30 Dara I 12 Dara II 14 Alexander 14 The Arsacids 266 Total 538
The year 538 is the year of Ardashir's accession according to Zoroastrian tradition. The striking feature of this chronology is that 266 years, instead of some 500years, are assigned to the Arsacids.The Bundahishn (xxxvi. 8) has284 years for theArsacid rule, but the span given in allthe sources which reflect the Khwaday-ndmag more reliably is 266. Mas'udi, who was well aware of the discrepancy between the traditional and the actual length ofArsacid rule, gives the time between the death of Alexander and Ardashir Papagan as 517 years,2 and attributes the shortening ofthe Arsacids' reign toa deliberate manipulation by the Sasanians out ofantagonism towards their predecessors. In fact, the figure seems to have been arrived at innocently in Sasanian times through faulty reckoning.
To understand this process, it must first be recognized that under the Parthians the people inBabylonia continued the use ofthe Seleucid era, which began in 312 B.C.This erawas still being used in chronology when Ardashir seized the Parthian kingdom in the year 538of the Seleucid era. The Iranians, however, had forgotten theorigin of this era and considered it indigenous. When the Sasanian dynasty was established and Zoroastrianism became the official religion ofthe state, the millennial scheme was grafted upon the Seleucid era. It came to be

CHRONOLOGY
believed that the era had in fact begun not with the Seleucids but with the coming of Zoroaster at the beginning of the 9th millennium. Thus the first year of Ardashir's reign coincided with the year 3538 of the Zoroastrian world year. Now, the Zoroastrians were in possession of a tradition which placed the date of Zoroaster, or more precisely, Gushtasp's conversion, 258 years before Alexander.1 By adding the 14 years of Alexander's reign and subtracting the resulting 272 years from the year of Ardashir's accession to the throne, they arrived at 266 years, which they thought encompassed the reign of the Arsacids:2
Ardashlr's accession, dated from the assumed coming of Zoroaster, 538 Subtracted are: the years from Zoroaster to Alexander, according to Zoroastrian tradition 258 and the years of Alexander's reign 14
-272
The years between Alexander and Ardashir, i.e., the Arsacid reign 266
The Sasanians had no recollection of the Seleucids. For them the period of the "petty kings" (Mu/uk al-tawdyif), which betokened the Parthian era, began immediately after Alexander. The chronological scheme which was thus established limited the rest of history before the coming of the first Saviour to 462 years, i.e. 1000 minus 5 38. As time went by, the coming of the Sosyant seemed even closer. It can be imagined how the hope of the Zoroastrian community of believers must have been pinned on the event when the country was overrun by the conquering Muslim armies at about the end of the millennium. And yet, as the expected coming of the Saviour continued to elude them, attempts were made at different times to give ever later dates for the anticipated event. A clear instance of such a postponement is seen in the Zandi Vahman Yasht, ix. 1, where the birth of Hoshedar is predicted for the year 1800 (after Zoroaster), a delay of 800 years.

Ardashir did engage in a deliberate falsification of chronology in order to dispel a belief among the people that the end of Zoroaster's millennium was at hand. His argument is based mainly on the assumption that Mani must have considered himself also iisedar, a Zoroastrian Saviour whose appearance at the end of the millennium had been prophesied; therefore he places Zoroaster's date at 754 B.C.; see his "The Date of Zoroaster", ArOr XXVII (1959), pp. 5 56-64, and Beitrdge %ur Geschichte desMa^dakismus (Dissertationes Orientales 37, Prague, 1977), pp. 131—5.For a review of the dates recently proposed for Zoroaster, see E.

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
MYTHS AND LEGENDS
OF WESTERN AND SOUTHERN IRAN
As already noted, the Iranian account ofthe past is devoid ofthe historical tradition of western and southern Iran. Accordingly, thehistory of the Median and Achaemenian empires does not figure init. After treating of the Pishdadian and Kayanian dynasties, the report passes, with only a brief mention of the Arsacids, to Sasanian history. Further, the national tradition does notperceptibly include myths and legends pertaining to western andsouthern Iran, except as they relate to theSasanian period.
There is little doubt, however, that the Iranians of the west and south must have had their own tradition ofmyths and legends. If these had come down to us,wewould, no doubt, notice many similarities between them and those of the east - similarities closer than those seen between the Vedic and Avestan traditions. The Elamite treasury tablets found at Persepolis record a number of personal names such as Yama (Yima, Jam), Yamakka (*Yamaka), Yamakshedda (Av. Yima.xsaeta, Pers. Jamshed), Zamashba (Jamasp) and Narishanka (Nairyo.sarjha), all mythological or legendary names known from the eastern Iranian tradition.1 Also Ctesias (Pers. 10) gives thename of the usurper of the throne after Cambyses as Esphendadates (Isfandiyar).
The occurrence ofsuch names may indicate anearly spread of eastern legends to the south and west, but it is more likely that they attest to a pan-Iranian fund of myths andlegends which was inherited from the times when the Iranians still lived on the steppes, but which was modified in local traditions.
The existence of such a tradition in thewest is in fact confirmed by the accounts of the classical writers, whose contact was mainly with western and southern Iran. One such legend is that ofthe birth and upbringing of Cyrus and his victory over his grandfather, Astyages. Ctesias, the physician of Ardashir II,has recorded oneversion of this legend (Pers. z) and Herodotus another (i. 107-30), the latter with some attempt at rationalization. Ctesias' story, as Gutschmidt has observed,2 has aMedian ring to it, whereas Herodotus's represents aPersian rendering. A parallel caneasily be drawn between thelegend of Cyrusand

that of Kai Khusrau. In both cases analien king (Astyages-Afrasiyab) orders anIranian prince (Cyrus-Kai Khusrau) and the son of his own daughter (Mandada-Farangis) to be slain; but theinfant is saved, is brought upin secret and later overcomes his grandfather.1 Gutschmid had early directed attention to the fact that the story related by Ctesias regarding the birth and youth ofCyrus istransferred inits basic features to Ardashlr Papagan.2 In thestories of Dara3 andShapur i4 we have additional examples of this legend.
Some other legends ofwestern Iran may be seen inthe story ofhow a groom ofDarius I got his master's horse to neigh at the right time and so won the throne forhim (Herodotus in. S4S); the rearing of Achaemenes by an eagle (Aelian, De naturaanimalium xn. 21), which brings to mind the rearing ofZal by the Simurgh; and the love-story of Zariadres and Odatis (see below, pp. 467-8).
Whether the western Iranians ever created anepic literature comparable to that ofthe eastern Iranians is open to doubt. And yet the information obtained from classical sources, meagre asit is, clearly indicates the existence ofa body ofmyths and legends which isdistinct from that of the east. The question arises astothe circumstance oftheir omission from the national tradition. Aneven more remarkable omission is the almost complete disappearance from memory of the Medes and the Achaemenians.5 That the history of two periods ofoutstanding political and military achievement should have been submerged is puzzling enough; that they should be lost from a tradition collected and recorded bytheSasanians, themselves originating from thehomeland of the Achaemenians, is extraordinary anddemands explanation. No deliberate omission of this kind could be attributed to the Sasanian period, since notonly were theSasanians themselves from the south, but also, in challenging theauthority of the Arsacids, they ostensibly intended to restore to the country the kind of national government which hadprevailed before Alexander.6 It therefore stands to reason that they would nothave neglected to incorporate thehistory of the Achaemenians with their own if they had had a clear memory of it.7
This historical amnesia could have developed only in Parthian times. Achaemenian court records were dispersed and finally disappeared after

Alexander. Cuneiform and Elamite alphabets fell into disuse and records in those scripts became unintelligible. During thelong expanse of Parthian rule, while the Iranian legendary history, asdeveloped in the east, was being cultivated byParthian princes and their vassal courts, the historical events of the west and south gradually faded from memory. Thus eventually the eastern epic traditon became that of the nation, providing a historical structure with which all Iranians could identify. Mary Boyce hasargued that thelegends of the Kayanians were virtually confined tothe east during the whole extent ofParthian rule and beyond, until the Sasanians decided to record the material aspart of the "national" history.1 This view, in the opinion of the present writer, gives rise toseveral problems which can easily be avoided ifwe assume that eastern legends spread to the south and west during Parthian times and absorbed orreplaced local legends. Otherwise, it is difficult to understand why the Sasanians should abandon their ownoral tradition for that of the Parthians. Also their reasons for suddenly deciding tocollect and record the legends ofthe eastern provinces and those ofthe Arsacids, their erstwhile enemies, tothe exclusion oftheir own is hard to fathom. A desire to win thesupport of the eastern provinces when attacks from the north-east may have shaken the allegiance of these provinces ishardly convincing, given the little bearing that "written" literature could have had on theattitude of the population. In fact the linguistic evidence from Armenian sources indicates that the Kayanian legends were introduced into Armenia inParthian times. The Armenian forms Shavarsh (Siyavush;2 cf. Khwarazmian Savus or Savus in BirunI, Athdr, 35,18)andSpandarat (Isfandiyar),two heroes of the national saga,3 show Parthian features. If the Kayanian saga could be introduced into Armenia inParthian times, there islittle reason todoubt its introduction into Media orPersia during the same period.4 Three factors appear tohave helped tospread these legends beyond their homeland. First, the Parthian hegemony and its attendant political and cultural influence for nearly half a millennium. Second, the intrinsic

attraction of the legends and their literary and recreational qualities. Third, the implicit religious sanction that these essentially secular legends had received through reference to them in theYashts. The Sasanian Avesta, tojudge bythe Denkard summary, incorporated many of the Kayanian legends; this circumstance alone must have facilitated the spread ofthe eastern saga through oral transmission, in nearly the same way that instruction in the Qur'an promoted the stories of the prophets (qisas al-anbiyd').
If the Sasanian scribes were infact recording eastern legends which had been confined to their homeland we would not have found somany traces of western and southern adjustments in them. Caecasta would not have been identified, for instance, with a lake inAzarbaijan, while Fars andStakhr would have had no place inPishdadian and Kayanian legends. * Such adjustments can point only to the circulation of these legends in the south andwest for a long period before they were recorded. That some names from the eastern epic cycles became popular among the Sasanians from the second half of the 5 th century can hardly be taken as proof of a contemporary recording of these cycles; it indicates, rather, arevival ofpatriotic spirit onaccount ofrenewed raids by nomadic* tribes on the eastern frontiers. Such names (Kapat = Kavad, Manuchihr) had been borne much earlier bythe kings ofPersis, as evidenced bytheir coins.2 As it was, when Ardashir rebelled against his Parthian overlord, the long duration of the Arsacid reignhad already given Iran something approaching anational saga and a national history, casting into oblivion the memory of the Medes and the Persians andovershadowing or absorbing local legends. It was this eastern tradition turned "national" which wascommitted to writing in Sasanian times.
WRITTEN FORMS OF THE NATIONAL HISTORY
The existence in Sasanian times ofbooks devoted tothe factual as well as thelegendary history ofpast kings is supported to some degreeby internal evidence. Forinstance, in the Shdh-ndma, when Hormazd IV is dethroned andimprisoned, he asks for a knowledgeable reciter of history tocome forward with "abook " tokeep him diverted by relating stories of the ancient kings.3 Mas'udI reports4 that hehadseen in the

possession ofa noble Persian family ofIstakhr a huge illustrated manuscript describing many sciences of the Iranians, their history, their monuments and their policies, as well as portraits of twenty-seven Sasanian rulers - twenty-five male andtwofemale - which hadbeen copied from works inthe treasury ofthe Persian kings inA.H. 113. This information issupported by Hamza's systematic account1 ofthe official portrait of each Sasanian ruler, accounts which must ultimately be based on official records. Thedescription that Mas'udi gives of Ardashir Papagan's portrait - the king with redshirt, sky-blue trousers, green crown set ingold, standing with a lance inhis hand - corresponds to a similar description by Hamza andtends to support the authenticity of the two accounts. Hamza's descriptions areconfirmed in turn by archaeological evidence: aportrait ofKhusrau I found on a rock-crystal bowl accords with Hamza's description ofhis portrait.2 We may safely assume, then, that in the Sasanian court a record was kept of the chief events under each ruler, together with hisportrait. The existence of such records finds further support inAgathias (27.2; 30.4), who makes oblique reference toofficial annals and royal divans by quoting reports that he had received from a knowledgeable Syrian friend, Sergius. How far back such records started, and whether they had a precedent in the Parthian court in Ctesiphon, is hard to determine. Butit is almost certain that such records eventually included also an account of the legendary history of the nation, probably with portraits of all the Pishdadian and Kayanian kings, who were as real tothe people as were the Sasanian kings. Such traditional portraits were current until recently inIran.
The compilation of history and the publication of political tracts could further political aims, and the Sasanians were adept practitioners of these arts, as shown by the"Letter of Tansar" and by the way in which the Mazdakites were presented by the Sasanian official tradition. (Nizam al-Mulk echoes the Sasanian practice inIslamic times.) Khusrau I, in particular, made use of such works to expound his ideas and policies. But we need not assume that the compilation of historical works was undertaken first under Khusrau I. Shapur I recorded his victories,his pious deeds and the names ofthe dignitaries ofhis own and his father's court ina great inscription on the Ka'ba-yi Zardusht. He even recorded an archery feat at Naqsh-i Rajab. We know also that he encouraged

translations from Greek andSanskrit. It ismost unlikely that he would not have sponsored works of history as well. Sasanian propaganda against the Parthians must have provided a strong motive for the sponsorship of political tracts and the writing of " n e w " histories.
Along with thesemi-official renderings ofthe national history, there existed in Sasanian times a number of other works which hadsome bearing on the record of the past. Onewasthe Gdh-ndmag, which according to Mas'udi's Tanbih1 treated of official ranks in the Sasanian empire; another wastheA'm-ndmag, "Book of Rules [of Propriety]", which portrayed thenational customs andmanners, andthe proper conduct expected of kings, nobles andthe other classes of society.To judge from their reflection in thePerso-Arabic sources, these books, too, must have been rhetorical in tone, seeking to extol and establish the virtues associated with Iranian tradition. We must assume that there were other works dealing with administrative matters, aswell as books on individual kings or national heroes.2 Known examples are the Kdrndmag of Ardashir Papagan and the historical romance featuring Bahram Chobin, upon which several historians inaddition toFirdausl have drawn. Some of these works must have been incorporated either in their entirety or in an abridged version in thelater recensions of the Khwaddy-ndmag. We find, for instance, that a complete version of the Ayddgdr-i Zarerdn is reproduced byFirdausl and an abridged form by Tabarl and Tha'alibl.
THE CHARACTER AND THE ASPECTS OF
THE NATIONAL HISTORY
As already observed, the historical tradition which developed in Sasanian times was concerned less with determining thefacts of history than with providing an insight into the past and a vision of the future. It served to illustrate, promote and bolster religious and national ideals as conceived bythe leaders of the Sasanian state. It wasalso meant to educate and entertain. Thus it combined four chief aspects: religious, socio-political, didactic and recreational.
(i) Thereligious aspect. InIran religion has always played a central role in the national life. Far from confining itself merely to individual relations between man and some supernatural power, ithas encompassed the whole spectrum of social and political life andhas formulated legal

and political norms of conduct. In Sasanian Persia, with thefirm union of church and state, the national history necessarily acquired a religious colouring and a good deal of non-heroic and mantic material was added to it. The Kayanian epic cycle originated, wemay recall, as a literature of adventure, war and heroism. Heroic literature, however, is often followed by a literature which tends tobe preoccupied with the spiritual aspects of life and to respond to the intellectual and contemplative concerns of society. Composed in general by seers, prophets and saints, such literature reflects the views, sentiments and interests of a class different from the warriors and purports, not to entertain, but to inspire, inform andeducate. Theearliest example of mantic literature in Iran is theGathas of Zoroaster. As the Zoroastrian religion spread and its priesthood strengthened its hold, not only did religious literature flourish, but its spirit and outlook affected some of the earlier heroic literature also. The Sasanian literary heritage indicates that in Sasanian Iran both the heroic and the religious traditions flourished side by side: onein the domain of the minstrels andstory tellers,and the other in that of the priesthood. Whereas theepic literature catered to the taste of the nobles (d^dddn), the Avestan commentaries and the genre which is illustrated in the Pahlavi books of the 9th century reflected the religious concerns. TheKhwaddy-ndmag, however, was a work of mixed content, despite its unmistakable core of a heroic nature. It wascommitted to writing during a period when the Zoroastrian religion was ascendant and in a formal alliance with the Sasanian court. Further, its compilation was the work of the scribal class (dabzrdn), which, although serving primarily the king, the nobility and their courts, shared the priestly outlook by virtue of its training. Thus the Khwaddy-ndmag assumed a strong religious aspect - much stronger, we may suppose, than in its Perso-Arab renderings. Yet the Khwaddy-ndmag remained predominantly an epic history, much more so than the Mahdbhdrdta, the heroic nucleus of which is almost overshadowed by later accretions and elaborations of a non-heroic and religious nature.
The religious outlook and the priestly orientation of the Khwaddyndmag were revealed in a number of ways. At the court the mobads, the astrologers (akhtar-shumdrdri), thewise men {bakhraddn) and the men of learning (ddndgdn) were always at hand andwere regularly consulted on matters of consequence, andthey were shown in the Khwaddy-ndmag

to be invariably right. A dualistic concept ofthe universe and its resultant ethical values pervaded the work. Historical events were understood chiefly in terms of the duality of good and evil, and Ahriman and his demons were ever present to inflict damage and distress on human existence and to corrupt men's minds. Yielding to their temptation entailed divine punishment, as evidenced by the fate of Jamshed, Kavus, and Yazdgird I. Views andreligious innovations to which the Zoroastrian church did not agree, such asManichaean and Mazdakite teachings, were branded asheresy and were harshly condemned. Apart from echoing the religious concepts and values of Sasanian Persia, the Khwaddy-ndmag included many admonitions and didactic pronouncements, as well as other non-heroic material, such as throne addresses and an account of the progress of civilization under theearly kings. Throne addresses, which in the Shdh-ndma almost always open with praise of God and thanks forhis blessings, and vow to follow the path of religion andjustice, bear a particularly moral andreligious stamp. Christensen, acutely aware of the two strains in the historical tradition, made a case for distinction between a "religious" and what hecalls a "national" tradition in Sasaman times.1 The religious tradition emphasized, according to him,the millennial scheme, the cosmic view of world history, theprophetic events of the future and the eschatological roles ofthe immortal kings and heroes, aswell as the intervention of the deities, demons, Amashaspands and the fravasis. It was particularly concerned with the life of the prophet and hishouse, the Gushtaspian cycle and theheroes of the religious wars, as well as with the early upholders of the faith and its first instructors (Av. paoiryoJkaesas).Kings and heroes who were believed tohave supported the religion andto have respected theviews of the mobads received detailed and favourable treatment. These included Bahman, the defender of the faith; the Arsacid Vologeses (Balash), who ordered the collection of religious writings; Ardashlr Papagan, who united thecountry and brought thechurch and state together; Shapur II,who upheld orthodoxy; Bahram V (Gor), who gave free rein to the priests; Khusrau I, who crushed theMazdakite heresy; andYazdgird III, thelast of the Zoroastrian kings.2 Also mentioned were Tansar (or Tosar), the minister of Ardashlr I; Adurbad Mahrspandan, the high priest under ShapurI I ; and Mihr Narse, thegrand vizier of Yazdgird I and Bahram V. Alexander remained a despicable figure and anenemy ofthe Iranian people;

Rustam, the slayer ofIsfandiyar, received little attention, while Bahman satisfied religious zeal bydestroying thehouse of Zal.
This tradition isbest seen inthe summaries, given inBooks VII-IX of the Denkard, of the lost Sasanian nasks of the Avesta andtheir commentary. It is further reflected in a number of Pahlavi books, more particularly the Bundahishn, chapters i-vii, xxix, xxxi-xxxvi. On the other hand, says Christensen, in the "national" tradition, which reflected the taste of the court and the nobles, apocalyptic features, cosmic projections and eschatological accounts received less attention, the hagiography was omitted, and attention was focused primarily on the heroic exploits ofkings and warriors. The defence ofthe fatherland and the protection of its boundaries and itsinstitutions - a prime concern of the nationalist Sasanians - became themotivating force of the national history. Turanian warriors, rather than kavis and karpans, sorcerers andsorceresses, represented themenacing foes of the land. Dahak and Afrasiyab were regarded as the"national" enemies of Iran in ages past, invading thecountry from foreign lands. Turan, seen as the antithesis ofIran, began tobe the focus ofall the bitterness and fury which long centuries ofwar with the nomads ofthe north-east had bred in Iranian hearts.
Christensen's distinction between a "religious" anda "national" tradition can hardly be denied, but his emphasis on the national tradition as a product of Sasanian times cannot be maintained. Hisexplanation does notshow sufficient appreciation of the oral tradition andof the nature of the heroic literature which already had had two brilliant phases - Kayanian and Parthian - before theSasanian period. The fact is that while the Zoroastrian priesthood had kept producing works of a religious nature ever since the Gathas were composed, making use of the legendary history forits own purposes, the epic tradition continued to flourish in the works of the minstrels andstory tellers.1 When in Sasanian times the different strands of oral literature were combined and written down, heroic stories, although they were cast in a frame compatible with the Sasanian stand and the religious outlook, remained basically a literature of entertainment attuned to secular interests, bolstering national pride andpatriotism. Thedifference between the two kinds of literature will become evident if we compare for instance the account of Kai Khusrau in theDenkard2 and theShdh-ndma,z\\. is

to be noted that inIslamic times, too, although education was controlled by theclergy, thecourt and the people maintained and applied a nonclerical taste to the literature of entertainment.
(2) The socio-politicalaspect.The implicit court sanction oftheKhwaddyndmag and similar works made them instruments of the political ideology of a well-ordered, autocratic monarchy. Absolute obedience tothe king was impressed upon thereader at every turn. It is preached in royal testaments and in the words ofsages and the mobads; it is also exemplified in the deeds ofIranian warriors and heroes. A dramatic exampleof such undisputed obedience is offered by Isfandiyar when he sets out to fight Rustam, even though hesuspects that his royal father means to send him to hisdeath. Hormazd I is said to have cutoffhis hand and sent it to his father, Shapur I, in order to assure him ofhis unswerving loyalty.1
The national history also served to promote a strict observance of distinction between the social classes. As is argued at length in the "Letter of Tansar", this discrimination wasconsidered a necessary condition for a stable and orderly society, since nothing could undermine the social order more than class confusion and elimination ofclass differentiation.2 To lend the distinction greater antiquity and therefore credence, the division ofpeople into four estates is attributed by some sources toJamshed3and by some toArdashlr.4 A tradition preserved in the Bundahishn attributes them implicitly to Zoroaster, whose three sons were each set atthe head ofa social class.5 The well-known story of the shoemaker in theShdh-ndma* illustrates this point. He is prepared to provide Khusrau I with four million drachmas so that the king can equip his army in a desperate war against the Byzantines. All the shoemaker asks is that his son beallowed to enter the ranks of the bureaucrats (dablrdn). Theking, however, forgoes the money rather than allow such a corruption of the ranks. The theory was that men of low birth, even if they acquired the necessary skills, were notfitto handle the responsibilities ofmen ofnoble birth, and so it was incumbent upon kings topreserve the purity ofthe higher classes. Thus, itwas invariably understood that the people must be kept totheir own stations and might

not aspire to cross thelines of social class.1 At least this claim is what the nobility andthe clergy maintained, although the speedy spread of the Mazdakite movement and the actions of some of the kings, like Yazdgird theSinner, Kavad and Hormazd IV, who were bent on curbing the power of the nobles, reveal that the views of the Sasanian establishment did notalways give an accurate picture of the country's social andmoral aspirations.
Many of the political views of the Sasanian establishment were presented through the"wisdom" literature. The chief ideas underlying the pronouncements on the conduct of government are: the necessity for subjects to show unfailing obedience to their sovereign, and for the sovereign to administer justice to hissubjects, to maintain thereligion, to ward offpossible abuses by theruling classes, to attend to thecultivation and prosperity ofthe land, and to relieve the needy from distress. The political theory behind such precepts is well defined and is referred to frequently. The words ofa mobad toBahram I, quoted by Mas'udi,2 provide a good example: " . . . thekingdom will notprosper except by observance of the law, obedience to God Almighty and action in conformity with Hisprescriptions andprohibitions; and the lawwill not have vigour except through theking; and the king will not prosper except through men, andmen will not prosper except by wealth, and there is no road to wealth except by the cultivation of the land, and there is no way to prosperity of the land except through the administration of justice; andjustice is the criterion that Godhas established among people and placed in thecharge of kings". Similar reasoning is attributed to Khusrau I: "TheKingdom depends on the army, the army on finance, the finance on taxes, taxes on land cultivation, and land cultivation on justice . . .".3
(3) The didactic aspect.Didacticism canbe seen in twodifferent forms in the national history. One is a general tendency to conclude that good will be rewarded and evil punished. Although the facts as presented may notalways support such a conclusion, theintent, which conforms to the Zoroastrian outlook, is unmistakable. The falls of Jamshed and Kavus are attributed to their pride. Dahak, notwithstanding his onethousand-year rule, is eventually smitten andchained. Neither Tur nor Afrasiyab escapes punishment for hismurderous crimes. Fortune departs when its possessor ceases to be virtuous, and the fravasis of the just help only the righteous. The same principle generally holds for Sasanian times. Ardavan pays for the sins of Alexander. Those who invade

Eranshahr at a time of her distress areeventually brought low, as is amply demonstrated byevents in the reign of Shapur II. Heresy does not succeed, as the cases of Man! andMazdak prove - nor doesencroachment onroyal privileges, asis shown bythe episode of Bahram Chobln. Arrogance and oppression are chastized by divine providence. Yazdgird the Sinner is kicked to death by a horse believed to be a divine agent in disguise, and Shiroy does not profit by patricide, but is
poisoned or, according to another account, dies of plague.1 The other form of didacticism in the national history is theexplicit giving of advice and admonition which embody ethical principles. Numerous precepts concerning the best way ofleading awise and fruitful life are worked into the texts. As the moral and spiritual leader of the people, the king isresponsible not only forruling the country, but also for regulating its ethical and social life. Therefore, almost all prominent Persian kings are credited with pronouncements onthe duties of kings and their subjects, the proper conduct ofgovernment, and appropriate personal behaviour. Accordingly, thenational history includes a fair share oiandar^ or"wisdom" literature. This isfound for the most part in the addresses of kings from the throne, their testaments to their successors, their epistles, and their sayings, and also in the advice provided bykings' advisors and ministers (notably Buzurgmihr, the vizier and counsellor ofKhusrau I), the sages atthe court, and the wise "men
of yore" (ptshmigdn). Maxims of observation or general truths2 ("The
world isa halting place and we are passing guests",3 "Killing prevents
killing"),4 maxims ofadvisability ("Do not hoard grain, sothat famine
will notovertake you"),5 and maxims of morality ("Do not wishfor others what you would notwish for yourself"; "Who is worthy of
praise ? He whose hopes and fears are centred inGod")6 abound. Many of these categories merge ofcourse and often a moral dictum is presented as also prudent and rewarding (" Shelter the wanderer so that you may
find a home in the hereafter")7 or asa general truth ("No prosperity
accompanies aking's injustices ").8As arule, there is atendency to make advice appear profitable, hence the impression ofa pragmatic approach.
Ethical and admonitory pronouncements generally appear, not inthe

form of connected and coherent discourse, but in the shape of short, pithy and epigrammatic words of wisdom. Frequently they takethe form ofquestion and answer orriddle and solution. They do not reveal any full-fledged systematic philosophical approach or theory, but generally they combine the dictates ofreligion and the requirementsof common sense. The guiding principle of a "wise" life appears to be
"moderation" (pad/nan).1 The dictates of experience and the wordsof the "ancients" carry great weight. Asceticism is notadvocated,but the transience of life, theimportance of leaving a good name, the wisdom ofdetachment from worldly pleasures and the avoidance ofall forms of excess arestressed. A mystical outlook does notbelong to Sasanian wisdom literature and isalien to Zoroastrian tenets.
(4) The recreational aspect. Entertainment asanaspect of the national history is reflected partly in thestyle in which theSasanian historiographers composed their text and partly in its content. History was written not as a "critical" exposition, but as anengaging narrativeof events adorned with elements of wonder, fantasy and wit. Hyperbole and metaphor were essential toits style. When an episode lent itself to epic treatment, history rose to thelevel of saga. The Yashts of the Avesta hadalready displayed marked literary qualities, the Parthian bards had composed many poetic or dramatic pieces, and the authors of the Sasanian histories could draw upon both sources. The Islamic renderings of a number of events, such as Fredon's victory over Dahak, the tragedy of Eraj, the vengeance of Manuchihr, the ordeal of Siyavush, the expeditions ofGodarz and Gev against Afrasiyab, the wars ofKai Khusrau, and the Gushtaspian cycle, aswell asmany episodes ofRustam's career, echo the poetical quality of the original epics, and their rendering by Firdausi raises them tothe highest level oftheir genre.
As forthe content, apart from the tales of adventure expected in a work of epic character, elements of popular tales andlegends were introduced tofurther engage the interest ofthe reader. For instance, all the major Islamic sources include inthe account of Shapur II a report in the nature of a popular tale according towhich the Iranian king goes alone ona spying mission to the Roman camp where he is discovered and caught by the enemy and bound in a straitjacket ofdrying animal
hide, but finally sets himself free and leads his army to victory.2 The

many amorous adventures ofBahram V, the tales ofhis hunting skills,
and his exploits inIndia1 belong to this category. So does the storyof the man from the Hephthalite camp who had his limbs cut off in order to gain credence in the eyes of King Peroz, saying he had been mutilated by the Hephthalite king. (See pp. 379ff. for other examples.) Of course itis not always feasible todraw aline between epic legends and popular tales, since much depends on diction andstyle. Certain tales, like some floating legends, areattached to several figures. The story of the girl who betrayed herfather during a siege (see above,
p. 380) is told in connection notonly with Shapur I2, butalso with
Ardashir3 andShapur II.4 The motif of a king or a famous warrior going incognito to the stronghold of the enemy to gather intelligence
or to carry outa stratagem is attributed to Qarin (Karen),5 Rustam,6
Isfandiyar,7 and Ardashir,8 as well as to Shapur II.9 The exchange of riddles between royal courts, with theusual provision that whoever
fails to solve the riddle should become a tributary of the other,10is another floating motif in popular tales, as is thesending of symbolic
objects to convey a message of contempt, humiliation or the reverse.11 Anecdotes could serve as a veiled expression of satire. Such is, for instance, the story Mas'udi tells of Bahram II and the mobad who wanted to warn him of the consequences of his confiscation of land and property. One day atthe hunt the king and the mobad overhear the conversation of two owls. At the king's request the mobad interprets their dialogue: the female says that she will marry hercompanion if he will give her twenty villages ruined under the reigning king; the male responds that if the present king's rule continues he, the owl, can well afford to give
her a thousand such villages.12 Sasanian authors wrote in an age of faith. They were nothindered by thelimitations of "reason" andthe requirements of plausibility. The miraculous and the fantastic were to them common occurrences. Therefore, tales of demons, fabulous animals andbirds, supernatural events, anachronistic stories and elements ofpopular superstition could easily gain a place inthe pages oftheir histories.

NATIONAL HISTORY AS A MIRROR OF
SASANIAN CONDITIONS
In the national history, vestiges of archaic times survive in the descriptions of warfare. Single combats, use of such weapons as themace and lasso, exchanges ofboasts and elaborate conceits before and during battle are traces of a very primitive period of warfare. The notion that the heads of clans or agnatic groups {hamndfdri)} such as Sam, Godarz, and Tus, arethestrongest of their clan members, is again reminiscent of archaic periods. Thefeudal features which prevail in the national history reflect mainly the circumstances of the Parthian and earlier periods. But it is theSasanian outlook and way of life which are most pervasive in the national history. Even the Pishdadian and Kayanian periods are treated in a Sasanian way. In fact, the mythical and legendary kings are cast in the mould of Sasanian monarchs. Practically all begin their reign with an address from thethrone, as was thecustom in Sasanian times. The addresses by Tahmorath2 and Jamshed3 are typically Sasanian. Equally Sasanian are the congratulatory responses and laudatory remarks bythe mobads and the nobles.4 In many instances anachronisms and implausible attributions result. The appearance of southern and western localities, like Susa, Babylon, Stakhr, Isfahan and Azarbaijan in earlier history,5 is a Sasanian imprint. Afrasiyab, for instance, defeats Naudhar's generals in Fars, where they are said to have taken refuge.6 Kai Kavad, after defeating Afrasiyab, sets out for Stakhr, " which was then the capital".7 Fasa, inFars, was built by Gushtasp8 orby Bahman.9 Kai Kavus and Kai Khusrau, seeking God's blessing in order to overcome Afrasiyab, visit theFire of Gushnasf in Azarbaijan, and set out for Fars, their "residence" after their victory over Afrasiyab.10Ibn alBalkhi's Fdrs-ndmafrequently projects Fars, the seat of the chief mobad in Sasanian times,11 into earlier periods. Stakhr, built by Gayomard, is the place where the people offer allegiance to Hoshang. Jamshed chose Stakhr as his capital, and Gushtasp imprisoned Isfandiyar there.12

HISTORY AS A MIRROR
Even Lake Caecasta, the scene of Afrasiyab's final refuge and death was transferred to Azarbaijan.
Sasanian institutions arereflected everywhere. The Pishdadian kings are advised by themobads. When KaiKhusrau decides to retire from the throne, he leaves part of his treasures to be spent on "Building fortifications, inns, fire temples, places ofworship, repairing the bridges of wood and bridges of stone, barring the [enemy] observation posts and opening frontier passages . . . " 1 Many Sasanian institutions are attributed to earlier kings. According to theShdh-ndma* it is Jamshed, for instance, who divides thepeople into thefour classes prevailing in Sasanian times. Ibn al-Balkhl attributes the initiation of the chief Sasanian administrative measures, tax regulations and court protocol to Gushtasp.3 Sasanian customs aremirrored in thereforms credited to Kai Kavad,4 and in thegifts of Kavus to Rustam.5 These gifts include a silver throne with golden pedestals, a diadem anda gold-embroidered hat (kuldh). They arereminiscent of Khusrau IFsgift of a silver throne to oneof his vassal kings, mentioned by Hamza.6 Theappearance of Rum (the Byzantine Empire) in thecourse of Kayanian history, in such incidents as Kavus' dispatching anenvoy to the Kaisar,7 and theyoung Gushtasp's journey to Rum and marriage to a Byzantine princess8, is an anachronism resulting from the transfer of Sasanian conditions to ancient times.
Some of the episodes in thewars between Iran andTuran appear to be modelled on thebattles which took place on theeastern frontiers of Iran during andafter thereign of Peroz. Typical of these engagements are theraids of the "Chionite" Arjasp on Bactria in thetime of Gushtasp; these are described as having been followed by the sacking of cities, the destruction of fire temples, the killing of the mobads, and the enslavement of the people.9
Nowhere areSasanian institutions better rendered than in thedepiction of the king andhis court.
Imageof kingship. In thenational history theking takes hisposition at the pinnacle of political power and is presented as thefocus of history. A number of doctrines bolster hisposition. Chief among them are the doctrines of legitimacy androyal prerogative.

In order to be legitimate, the king must be of royal blood. In the chain of dynasties, the legitimacy of each king isassured by his blood relationship to aprevious king. When there is agap, such relations are invented. Thus, Hoshang is made adescendant ofGayomard, Fredon adescendant of Jamshed, Manuchihr a descendant of Eraj, Zaba descendant of Naudhar,1 Kai Kavad a descendant ofManuchihr2 orFredon,3 Luhrasp a descendant of Kai Kavad,4 Dara a son of Bahman, the Arsacids descendants ofDara, Isfandiyar orKai Kavad5 and Ardashir Papagan a descendant of Kayanian Dara. During his flight to the east, Kavad marries agirl of seemingly undistinguished lineage, who later gives birth to a son, Khusrau I. Oninquiry, she is found to be a descendant of Fredon.6 Nowhere is the importance of royal blood brought to light more clearly than in the episode ofthe rebellion of Bahram Chobin against the Sasanian royal house. Although he isofnoble birth, his eventual failure is generally explained by thelegitimacy of Khusrau II. This doctrine is put in the mouth of Bahram's own sister and wife, Gurdoya,7 who warns him ofthe fate ofthose who make attempts at kingship without being ofroyal blood. A similar indictment ofrebellion against kingsof the blood is voiced by theelder sonof Shahrburaz, a general who seized thekingdom of Ardashir, sonof Shiroy (even though ShahrburaVs younger sontakes theopposite view andrefuses to consider the Sasanians inviolate).8
This doctrine is accompanied bythat of the sanctity of royal blood. It is his belief in this sanctity that prevents Burzmihr, whose father Sukhra had been killed byKavad, from killing the former king when he was deposed and placed in Burzmihr's hands.9 Hamza relates10 that down tohis day inMarv and its vicinity people called the descendants of Mahoe, thegovernor of Marv who betrayed andcaused the death of the last Sasanian monarch, "king-killers" (khudd[h\-kushdn)}1 Of course there were many cases ofinternecine dispute among princes of the Sasanian house, andwars of succession were both fierce and frequent. Claims to the throne were not confined to princes of the Sasanian house, as is amply shown by theactions of Bahram Chobin

and, more graphically, by his arguments as reflected in the romance which fictionalized his story. But these exceptions were either passed over in silence or played down in xhzKhwaddy-ndmag, apart from showing the sinister aspect of a king like Shiroy, who was not favoured by chroniclers sympathetic to Khusrau II. To expatiate on such matters would have bred strife and would not have tallied with the general purpose of a national history. Popular discontent, minority grievances, and rebellious sentiments found scant expression in the national history. The Sasanian Establishment considered the airing of such matters detrimental to the cause of a stable society.
The standard image of a king in the national history presents him as superior among men in physical strength, good looks, wisdom and eloquence - almost the same qualities which distinguish a king in the Homeric conception. Kings are also law-givers and great organizers. This is particularly true of the "great kings" such as the founders of dynasties. All the early kings up to Zab, who are treated as culture heroes, as well as Kai Kavad and Kai Khusrau share these qualities. Among the Sasanians, Ardashir, Shapur II, and Khusrau I in particular develop such an image. All the great kings are credited not only with military ability and political acumen, but also with superior wisdom. They are not only heroes on the battlefield, but also agents of prosperity, builders of cities, initiators of useful institutions, and needless to say, staunch supporters of the Zoroastrian religion. The early kings are presented as promoters of civilization and authors of progress from a primitive mode of life, when people lived in the mountains and wore animal skins, to a more advanced culture. Most of these monarchs are also credited with precepts and wise counsels.
Of course, this standard image does not mean that we meet with only stereotyped kings in the national history. Although in Iranian histories characterization was broad, with little attention paid to psychological delineation, yet discordant royal images emerge. Opposed to the image of the great kings of benevolent nature is the image of powerful "wicked" kings, exemplified in the tyrants Dahak and Afrasiyab, and originally also Alexander, all treated as kings of "foreign blood". A third type presents a mixed image. Jamshed constitutes the prototype; he has no match among kings in glory and power, and yet in the end Fortune fails him. Kai Kavus is the best-drawn character of this type, combining great power, a spirit of adventure, and indomitable courage with strains of cruelty, foolhardiness and unbridled ambition. Gushtasp,

too, falls into this category, as dosome of the Sasanian kings. One is Kavad, whose military skill and valuable internal reforms are balanced by his ignominious flight into the land ofthe Hephthalites, his seeking help from former enemies toretrieve his throne, and most importantly, by his succumbing to Mazdakite seduction. Another is Khusrau II, whose military triumphs, dazzling pomp and circumstance, spectacular wealth and splendid court are marred byhis suspected acquiescence in the assassination ofhis father, his flight toByzantium, the defeat ofhis army inthe final stages ofthe Perso-Byzantine wars, his harsh treatment of some ofhis generals, the hardening ofhis character towards the end of his life, and his inglorious end.
Of the lesser kings, Yazdgird the Sinner is painted black, presumably on account ofhis resistance topriestly and aristocratic interests, and his sympathy for religious minorities (though this latter quality is passed over in silence in the national history). Shlroy is presented asa sickly tyrant who puts a large number of Sasanian princes to death, including the father of the last Sasanian king. Heis said also to have shown an acrimonious attitude towards his officials.
Although the importance of personal accomplishment (hunar) is often emphasized in thecourse of heroic conceits, it is evident that Iranian society placed great value upon family and descent (gohar).Inthe course of the long verbal battle between Khusrau II andhis rebel general, Bahram,1 Khusrau repeatedly taunts Bahram with hislow birth,and asserts the legitimacy ofhis own claim tothe throne onthe basis ofhis royal lineage. Bahram counters by casting aspersions on the king's birth,2 andby referring to theforefather of the Sasanians as a mere shepherd,3 claiming for himself descent from thelegendary warriors Arish and Milad.4 Shirin, the beloved mistress and,later, wife of Khusrau II,is rejected by theking's counsellors on the grounds that she would weaken the king's descendants by her plebeian blood.6 Khusrau I'schief argument against the Mazdakites isthat their doctrine would obliterate the distinction between men ofhigh birth and people of humble station.
The king's major occupations are pictured as administering justice, taking counsel with dignitaries atcourt (notably the chief mobad, highranking nobles, andwise counsellors), deciding matters of peace and war, appointing chief officers ofstate, and taking appropriate measures

for enhancing the prosperity of the land, as well as cultivating the princely pursuits of hunting, banqueting and merry-making. His education is oriented accordingly. He is tutored at court and in the field to attain physical and intellectual accomplishments.
Though much emphasis is placed on physical skills (handling weapons, riding, playing polo, and hunting), moral discipline, cultural attainments and proper etiquette are not ignored, as can be seen in a passage in the Shdh-ndma concerning the education of Siyavush by Rustam.1 In another passage,2 Zal, whose education as a vassal prince is pictured no differently from that of a crown-prince, is tested at the court by Manuchihr and his nobles. They measure his intelligence by asking him to answer riddles and then give him an opportunity to demonstrate in a tournament his skills in bowmanship. Hamza3 refers to the practice whereby Sasanian kings during their own life-times appointed their crownprinces to be kings of major provinces, so that they might gain experience. In a long discourse, excerpted by Tha'alibi, Ardashir, after appointing his son, Shapiir I, governor of Khurasan, instructs him in statecraft and the art of good government. We find a summary of the king's duties in Tha'alibi,4 where what was undertaken by the nobles on behalf of Shapur II, when he was still a minor, is described.
As one of his first official duties, the newly-crowned king would address a gathering of nobles and court notables. After praising God and thanking Him for bestowing kingship upon him, he would outline his programme, assuring the people of his concern for justice and good government, and indicating his expectation of them as subjects. The assembly of notables would respond to the throne-address, exalting the king and his intentions, and assuring him of loyal service and the obedience of the people. The ceremony was one of impressive pomp and formality. Similarly the king sent messages to inform the provincial governors and high officials of his accession, his call for justice and his expectation of unswerving obedience to the throne. The king's epistle to this effect received a written response.5
In the national history, very often the king begins his reign by opening his treasure and making generous gifts of gold, silver, jewels, robes and fabrics, mounts and armour to the nobles and to his army. Sometimes he even remits taxes for the people for one or more years. Although this may not have been done in practice, the image was kept alive. Great victories also are occasions for generosity and gift-giving, as well as

cancellation ofarrears intaxes.1 When hardship and famine broke out, again the king might reduce orabolish taxes temporarily. For instance,
Peroz cancelled the land and poll taxes following aprotracted drought.2 A royal custom often mentioned is the special audience given at the court onthe occasion ofnational festivals and major events, such as a military triumph or the birth of a prince. Such audiences were portrayed as both a sign of the king's hospitality and a means of making him accessible to the people. The custom continued into Islamic times and Nizam al-Mulk's description ofsuch audiences and his prescriptionsof
correct procedure forthem3 also have a bearing on Sasanian practice. On festive occasions, the king not only bestowed gifts, but also received
them with proper ceremony.4 Strict protocol was observed at court in seating people before the king according to rank and in the reception of
foreign dignitaries.5 The splendour of the later Sasanian court at itszenith capturedthe imagination of the authors of the national history. This splendour, which was expressed in terms of abundant wealth, lavish treasures, ornate palaces, large stables, numerous concubines, slaves and servants, extravagant banquets, drinking bouts andhunting parties, was projected into the courts of the early kings aswell. The most spectacular account, however, is that given of the fabled treasures and the pomp
and circumstance of the court of Khusrau II.6 Tha'alibi dedicates a
whole chapter to it,7 and Firdausl describes it with noticeable relish.8 Khusrau II, inhis apologia to counter the accusations levelled against him byhis nobles and byhis son, Shlroy, defends the wealth andthe luxury of the court byarguing that they are factors in strengthening the kingdom and enhancing its image.
The nationalistic spirit of Sasanian tradition.An element which pervades Persian historical tradition isa strong sense ofnationalism. Alreadyin the Avesta, the description of Airyanam Vaejah, the original land of the Aryans, reveals theexuberant pride that the Avestan people took in
their country.9They believed in a "national" farrah (Airyamm Xvaranah, "The Glory of the Aryans"), which was created byAhura Mazda so

that theAryans might conquer the countries beyond Aryan lands and
bring prosperity to the mountains and valleys.1 The distinction between
Iranians and non-Iranians is made sharper by contrast with the Tur
anians. In the Farvardin Yasht, 143-4, five nations are mentioned: Aiyria "Aryans or Iranians," Tuirya "Turanians", Sairima, "the race of Sarm", Sainu and Dahi. Theidentities of the last two are uncertain.2 The first three are said in Sasanian tradition to be the descendants of Eraj, Tur and Sarm (Salm), thethree sons ofFredon. Ofthe five peoples only Tuirya, theTuranians, beside theAiriya, take anactive part in the national epic. They assume therole of the ever-present national enemy of the Iranians. Thenames of the Turanian heroes leave no doubt that the Turanians also were an Aryan people. In post-Avestan traditions they were thought to inhabit the region north of the Oxus, the river separating them from the Iranians. Their presence, and their incessant wars with the Iranians, help to define the latter as a distinct nation, proud of their land andready to spill their blood in its defence.
The continuation of nomadic invasions on thenorth-eastern borders in historical times kept the memory of the Turanians alive. After the 6th century, when theTurks, who hadbeen pushed westward by other tribes, became neighbours of Iran andinvaded Iranian lands, they were identified with the Turanians. Hence the confusion ofthe two in Islamic sources, including the Shdh-ndma, and the frequent reference to Afrasiyab as "king of the Turks". Concern for the safety of the Iranian borders andthecontinuance of the kingdom finds eloquent expression in thenational history andis a unifying element of its epic cycles.
Iranian nationalism exhibits itself also in relations with neighbours other than theTuranians - with Romans andByzantines, in particular. The Sasanians maintained that they were heirs to a great empire, that of the Kayanians, which Alexander had dismembered and plundered, and which theArsacids hadmismanaged (see above p. 378). Theearly kings of the dynasty were bent on restoring this empire to its former integrity and greatness. Ardashir justified his invasions of the western provinces on this basis3 and Shapur II in his high-handed letter to the emperor Constantinus, as quoted by Ammianus Marcellinus (xvn. 5. 5-6), exhibits a corresponding spirit. In thenational history the Roman

and Byzantine emperors are often pictured astributaries ofthe Iranian kings. The cause of many wars is given asthe failure of neighbouring countries topay their tribute. The share which the Byzantine emperors paid toward the upkeep ofgarrisons and fortifications against nomadic inroads on the Caucasian borders isgenerally termed tribute.1 The wars on the western frontiers are usually described ascrowned with success. Victories are depicted at length with great pride; the setbacks are glossed over forthe most part.
A revealing instance of Iranian nationalism isfound inthe "Letter of Tansar", where thesuperiority of the country andits institutions is expressed in glowing terms.2 In the Shdh-ndma,the victories of Shapur II, Narse, Bahram V and Khusrau I over their western rivals are represented in almost thesame vein as theglorious triumphs of the Iranians over the Turanians. Accounts of legendary expeditions to India, China and other distant places by kings ofrenown such as Shapur II, Bahram V and Khusrau I,3 and of their fabulous achievements,are further instances ofproud fantasies, asare the exaggerated descriptions of actual battles, with their numerous elephants and dazzling displaysof weaponry. Bahram V, said to have spoken eleven languages,4 wasthe hero who, in disguise, performed fantastic feats in India.5
In the same way that noble lineage is considered elevating, "foreign" affiliations are seen as defects. The opponents of Bahram V's succession object that he hasbeen brought up among theArabs anddoes not possess Iranian culture.6 Hormazd IV is disparaged by hiscritics on account ofhis Turkish mother.7 According toMas'udi, who obviously quotes from aself-satisfied source, Persian kings would marry into other royal families, but would not give their daughters inmarriage to them, "since they considered themselves noble, and had long stories about this".8 Khusrau II taunts Bahram Chobin with being of the same city (Rayy) whose contingent joined theGreek Alexander and caused the collapse of the Kayanian kingdom.9 "The Letter of Tansar", in a passage obviously designed to flatter nationalistic feelings,10asserts that Ardashir is now determined to focus hisentire attention on fighting the Rumis, the people ofAlexander, in order to avenge Dara.

ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT
records a tradition evidently inspired by nationalism when he relates1
that among thebooty which Bahram Chobin seized from the Turkish
Khaqan were thetreasures that Afrasiyab had taken from Siyavush and
those which Arjasp had captured from Luhrasp. Oneof the disgraces
Arjasp inflicted on Iran was hiscapture of the Iranian national banner,
which Isfandiyar succeeded in retrieving.2
Such evidence, though much of it is characteristic of epic in general,
brings out a significant psychological fact: the Iranians had sustained
for long centuries a deep sense of national identity. They felt that they
were distinct as a people, andhadan inalienable common heritageand
a long-standing tradition in their saga which setthem apart from other
peoples. Thelands conquered by the Iranians never became "Iran";
they always remained "non-Iran". In fact, theSasanians after Shapur I
took the title "king of Iran and non-Iran" (Eran ud aneran), thus
indicating thedistinction of Iran as a nation. The wish to impress this
distinction onothers and to inculcate inIranians a belief in the meritsof
purely Iranian virtues contributed to the outlook and tenor of the
national history and its rhetoric. In a battle between Bahram Chobin
and Khusrau II, in which the latter is aided by the Byzantine army, a
mighty Byzantine warrior, who is said to have belittled Bahram, is later
cut in half by a single stroke of Bahram's sword. Khusrau exclaims in
admiration and laughs, despite the fact that the loss is his. This behaviour
infuriates the brother of the Byzantine king, whois standing beside
Khusrau. ButKhusrau explains that " the warrior hadthought little of
my former general; this is the kind of general who hasdared to usurp
my kingdom".3
Now wemay turn to an examination of the origin and development
of the various components of the native historical tradition in Iran.

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
Egypt, on a document from Bogazkoy in Anatolia, andalso among Kassite documents.1 Most important isa Bogazkoy document in which the names of four major Indo-Aryan gods, Mitra, Varuna, Indra and Nasatya, occur. They are invoked as witnesses toa treaty made between the Hittite king Suppililiuma and a Mitanni prince, Mattiuaz(z)a. Documents which belong to the archives of Amenhotep IV (Akhenaten) from El-Amarna, andwhich include his own andhis father's correspondence with heads of Syrian and Palestinian city-states and Mitanni kings, preserve a number of the names ofthese rulers, such as Artatama, Artamania and Artassumara, the first element of which appears to be the Indo-Iranian fta. Among the Kassite names, that of Surilias, thesungod, which is almost certain to reflect Ved. Surya is particularly striking.
Such records, however, suggest little more than thepenetration of early waves ofIndo-Aryan people during the2nd millenuium B.C. into the ancient Near East, people who were absorbed later by the local population. Aside from Near Eastern archaeological evidence, the earliest references we possess to the figures ofnational history are found in the Rig Veda andtheAvesta. The Avesta, thesacred scriptures of the Zoroastrians, isofvarious dates. The oldest part of it in terms of composition is theGathas, thehymns of the prophet himself. These are generally believed tohave been composed in the 6th century B.C.,2 although many scholars have attributed them to an earlier period. T.Burrow has recently argued in favour of dating them back tono later than 1100 B.C.,3 and M. Boyce has now proposed 1700-1500 B.C. for Zoroaster.4 A series of Avestan hymns called the Yashts, although later incomposition than the Gathas, preserve much older, pre-Zoroastrian myths and legends. Typical of the material in theYashts is a hero sacrificing to a divine being and seeking his aid inachieving a specified goal orsurmounting a particular difficulty. From these scattered allusions it is clear that the gist of the mythical and legendary history ofIran was already in existence in pre-Avestan times.5 Although the Avestan references are brief,

ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT
it is easily seen that achain ofevents, which corresponds inarrangement and broad outline with the legendary history of Iran to the end of the Kayanian era, as known from Sasanian times, was familiar to the Avestan people. In the Aban Yasht, addressed to the goddess of water, Aradvi Sura Anahita (Mid. Pers. Anahid, Pers. Nahid), a series ofkings and notables is mentioned who have sacrificed to thegoddess. Hoshang's sacrifice to her is typical:
To her did Hoshang the Pishdadian offer up a sacrifice on the top of the Hara mountain, with a hundred male stallions, a thousand bulls, and tenthousand sheep. He asked of her a boon saying: Grant methis, O good, most powerful Aradvi Sura Anahita, that I may strike down two-thirds
of the giant demons and of the lustful evildoers.1
Those who sacrifice tothe goddess include Haosyanha (Hoshang), Yima (Jam[shed]), Azi Dahaka (Azdahak, Dahak), Thraetaona (Fredon), Karesaspa (Karshasp >Garshasp), Franrasyan (Afrasiyab), Kava Usa (Kavus), Haosravah (Khusrau), Tusa (Tus), the sons ofVaesaka (Vesa, Afrasiyab's uncle), Jamaspa (Jamasp), Asavazdah (Ashavazd, son of Purdhaxsti), Asavazdah andThrita, sons of Sayuzdri (all three champions ofthe Zoroastrian faith), Vistauru (Gustahm ?), Yoista (Yosht > Josht, one of the champions of the Zoroastrian faith), theHvovas(to which Jamaspa belonged) and the Naotaras (the house of Naudhar, to which Tus and Gushtasp belonged), Zarathustra (Zoroaster), Kavi Vistaspa (Vishtasp > Gushtasp), Zairivairi (Zarer), Arajataspa (Arjasp) and Vandaramaini (*Vandariman or Andarlman, Arjasp's brother). These figures maybe divided into the pre-Zoroastrian and the Zoroastrian, as indeed in the Yasht itself they are separated by an interlude (vv. 85-97) which treats of the descent of the goddess from heaven and the instructions she gave to Zoroaster concerning sacrifice offered to her.
From thefact that theworshippers of Aradvi Sura include Dahak, Afrasiyab, thesons of Vesa, Arjasp and Andarlman, allvillains of the national history, it isobvious that the adversaries of Iranian heroes were not excluded from appealing toIranian deities. Indeed, being close rivals of the same origin and background, they had recourse to the same means for success. This is further confirmed by the Zamyad Yasht (Yasht 19), which Darmesteter described asa "short history ofIranian monarchy,

an abridged Shdh-ndma",1 This Yasht isinpart devoted tothe praiseof the deities, rulers and heroes whopossessed the Divine Fortune (Xvardnah) and an account of their feats: the xvaranah joined Haosyarjha, who ruled over men and demons in theseven climes; Taxma Urupa (Tahmorath), who did likewise and transformed Ahriman into a horse, riding onitsback to both ends of the earth; and Yima of good herds, who subdued allthe demons and whose realm, before hesubmitted to the Lie, was free from heat and cold, oldage, death and envy. In his kingdom, men and animals, waters and plants, food and drink existed forever. The xvaranah was acquired also byThraetaona, who seized it when it left Yima forthe second time. (Ithad been caught by the yazad Mithra when it left Yima the first time.) It was seized by Karasaspa, the strongest and most valiant among men, who succeeded in performing extraordinary feats; and by all the Kayanian princes from Kavi Kavata to Kavi Haosravah. The xvaranah was possessed also by the prophet Zarathustra, byhis helper Vistaspa, who fought forrighteousness, and finally by the Saosyant (Soshyant), the triumphant redeemer and renovator of the world at the end of time.
The Farvardln Yasht (Yasht 13), devoted to thecelebration of the fravasis, the immortal spirits of the dead, enumerates in along register the heroes of the faith from the beginning ofthe world tothe end oftime. The list includes the name of deities, mythical and legendary figures of the national history, thehelpers of Zoroaster in thewars against the infidel, and alarge number of names which are not met in other sources. The first part of the Yasht is dedicated tothe glorification ofthe fravasis in general. The second part contains the names ofthose whose fravasis are specifically invoked. Inthis part, which may be divided into several sections, are mentioned a number of divine beings, Gayo.maratan (Gayomard) and Zoroaster (vv. 85-95), the disciples andhelpers of Zoroaster and theheroes of the Gushtaspian cycles (vv. 96-110),the Soshyant (v. 129), and the pre-Zoroastrian heroes (vv. 130-38). It also mentions thenames of the Zoroastrian righteous women (vv. 130-8) and other righteous persons whose identities arelost to us, butwho obviously have to dowith the history of the early Zoroastrian church
(vv. 118-28).
Of the fravasis of pre-Zoroastrian heroes, those ofYima, the house of Thraetaona, Uzava (Zab), Aghraeratha (Aghrerath), Manuscithra,the Kayanian princes (exactly as recorded in Yasht 19), Karasaspa,

ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT
HaoSyagha, and Fradhaxsti (one ofthe Immortals) are invoked. Of the fravasis of the helpers of Zoroaster, those of several members of his family and a great number of his early disciples are commemorated. There is mention also of a large number of heroes who obviously belong to the Gushtaspian saga, but of whom only a few are known from Islamic sources. This roster attests to an originally far more extensive epic cycle of the holy Zoroastrian wars than is revealed by extant Middle Persian and Islamic writings. Among the heroes who are known inthese writings are Vistaspa, Zairivairi, Vistauru ofthe house of Nautara, Frasamvarata (Farshidvard, son ofGushtasp in Firdausi), Fraso.karata (Frashokard, a son ofGushtasp inthe Ayddgdr I Zarerdri), Spanto.data (Isfandiyar), Bastavairi (Bastur) and Kavarasman (Karazm). Scattered references to figures of the national history are found also in Yashts 9,15 and 17, as well as in the Aogemadaecd, 2. later text in Avestan. There was more information onthese figures in the Sasanian Avesta than we possess now. The Chihrddd Nask, asection of the Avesta which is now lost but is summarized in the Denkard(vin. 12), contained a more systematic account of the national heroes than other Avestan books. Its summary lists the names ofall the Pishdadian and Kayanian kings in the same order inwhich they appear inIslamic sources. The Ddmddd Nask, another lost book ofthe Avesta, dealt with the creation ofthe spiritual and the corporeal world, the attack ofthe Evil Spirit and the pollutions and plagues with which it infested our world, and the disposition of mankind and its resources against the Adversary, much as the Bundahishn does; for the Ddmddd Nask is evidently the chief source ofthe Bundahishn,1 The summary ofthe lost Sudgar Nask in the Denkard iv furnishes a good deal of information about the heroes of the national history, Zoroaster, theSoshyant and the Renovation of the world. Not only are the major figures ofthe mythical and legendary history found inthe Avesta, but even some ofthe minor figures and episodes are recorded. For instance, reference is made inthe Avesta to the two wives of Dahak: Saghavak and Aranavak (Shahrnaz and Arnavaz in Firdausi), whom Fredon sought topossess through sacrifice to several deities.2 Or again, Dahak's minister Kandrau ispresented inthe Avesta as a giant monster, Gandarava, who is killed by Karasaspa.3 Thus the

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
Sasanian tradition ofIranian ancient history shows itself to bea direct development of the traditions recorded bythe Avestan people.
Before turning to the general features of this development, we may examine the chief individual figures, following the sequence in which they appeared in the Khwaday-ndmag.
GAYOMARD AND THE BEGINNING OF THE HUMAN RACE
Gayomard (Av. Gayo.maratan "dying life"; Pers. Kayumarth) appears in the Avesta several times, though little information about him is given. From Yasht 13.145 andYasna 26.10, inwhich thefravasis of the just "from Gayo.maratan totheSaosyant" arecelebrated, we infer that the notion of Gayomard as the first man isat least as oldas the Avesta. This is reinforced by another passage, Yasht 13.87, which says that Gayomard wasthe first togive ear tothe teaching ofthe good religion and from himAhura Mazda formed therace ofthe Aryan nation. From the DenkardVm. 12.1-4,welearn that the Chihrddd Nask of the Sasanian Avesta began with anaccount ofGayomard andthe first human couple, and thesummary ofyet another lost nask, the Vashtmdnsar Nask, in the Denkard ix. 32.9-10, contains allusions to the much fuller account which is preserved in the Bundahishn. According to the Pahlavi books which reflect later Avestan passages,1 Gayomard received fatal wounds when the Evil Spirit attacked him. Ohrmazd then created Sleep in the form of a fifteen-year-old youth in order to relieve Gayomard's pain. Ohrmazd also granted him thirty years to live (the same number of years which appear in post-Sasanian sources as hisregnal years). But Gayomard decreed before hisdeath that from hisseed men should come forth andcarry out Ohrmazd's design. From Gayomard's seed, according to the Bundahishn xiv, sprang arhubarb plant, which grew slowly into the first human couple, Mashya andMashyana.2 At first the couple acknowledged their creation by Ohrmazd, but Ahriman corrupted their minds and they offered allegiance tohim. They turned from eating grass to drinking milk andthen toeating meat. This way oflife strengthened the demons. For fifty years the demons made the couple lose their desire for intercourse and they remained childless. Then thoughts of progeny excited desire in them and they conceived a pair of children, which they later devoured. Eventually, they conceived sixsets oftwins,

GAYOMARD
each with one male and one female. In one set of twins were Siyamak and Vasak. From them were born Fravak and Fravaken. They, in turn, had fifteen sets of twins, and each set became the parents of a race. A number of other myths attached to the figure of Gayomard can be gathered from the Pahlavl books. While some may be late or derivative, others appear to be pre-Zoroastrian. According to the Pahlavi Rivayat 16 B.i,1 the creation of Gayomard is one of the occasions on which Ohrmazd offers a sacrifice (mya^d). The Dddastdn I DenJg lxiv. 3 recounts a myth obviously based on priestly speculations: Ohrmazd fashions from the Infinite Light the body of a priest {asrokkarp) whose name is to be that of Ohrmazd. Inside this body he creates a tangible (getig) being called man. For 3,000 years the man does not move or speak or eat. He is the first to receive the good religion, and men inherit wisdom from him.2 He is the first of the three "just men" {mardi ahrdvf - the other two are Zoroaster and the Soshyant - and his status as a "just m a n " is described as "above the stars, the Moon, the Sun and the Fire of Ohrmazd".4 At the resurrection the bones of Gayomard will rise first, then those of Mashya and Mashyana, and then those of other men.5 Half the light which accompanies the sun will be given to Gayomard and the other half to the rest of mankind (Bundahishn xxxiv. 8). According to the Denkardm. 80. 3-4, Gayomard was born of the union between Ohrmazd and his daughter Spandarmad (the Earth). This union is the origin of khwedodah (Av. xvaetvadatha), the marriage with close relatives. (In another passage,6 however, Vahman is said to be the issue of this marriage.) The Bundahishn (i a. 13) describes Gayomard as "bright as the sun", and the same in height and width - four reeds of measured length. He was stationed on the left bank of the river Daiti at the middle of the earth, facing the primordial Bull (Gap i evddd)on the right bank. The Menog1Khrad tells us,7 as does Biruni,8 that Gayomard killed a son of Ahriman, Arzur.9 Ahriman, according to Biruni, complains to

Ohrmazd, protesting a breach of compact. Ohrmazd, as a result, punishes Gayomard bydeath, which in the more orthodox accounts is dealt him by Ahriman.
These scattered pieces ofinformation have given rise to considerable speculation among Iranists asto the original nature and role of Gayomard. He has been seen as one of the primordial giants of IndoEuropean myth, from whose limbs the world was made;1 hehas been practically identified with Mithra;2 made a brother ofMithra and a son of Ahura Mazda;3 identified with the Soshyant;4 andregarded asa microcosm representing the macrocosm.5
His name suggests that from early Zoroastrian times Gayomard was the personification of an abstract notion, as were many other notions, notably asa(jta) and the Amssa Sp^ntas, also thus personified. But even so, the myth obviously contains many aspects of more ancient beliefs concerning aprototype ofman atthe beginning ofcreation. A comparison with the Vedic Martanda "Mortal Seed",6 who, like Gayomard, is as wide as he is tall, andfrom whose "seed" all human life was to spring, leaves little doubt about the Indo-Iranian basis of Gayomard's myth.7 It isprobable that inthe more ancient myth ofpagan times, it is the first man himself who is sacrificed by the gods inorder to reinforce life and generate new births. The notion is obliquely expressed in the myth ofthe primordial Bull, whose death brings animals and plants into being,8 and can perhaps be seen also inthe Mithraic sacrifice ofthe bull. In theorthodox Zoroastrian version of the myth, however, we find Ahriman to bethe author ofthe Bull's death.9
It is clear that in the early Zoroastrian account, Gayomard, likethe Indie Martanda, shared some mythical features with thegods. He is placed on alevel with the prophet Zoroaster and the saviour Soshyant as a member of a trinity of"just men", and has a link with the sun, since his seed is said to have been purified byit,and since, like it, heshone. Further, he is to play an eschatological role by rising first amongthe

GAYOMARD
dead, a feature reminiscent of the Vedic Yama (Av. Yima). The eclipse of Yima as the original first man seems to have led to the transference of many of his features to Gayomard. Later, Gayomard became the subject of priestly speculation. Shahristani mentions a Zoroastrian sect which even took Gayomard's name.1 When the national history was systematized, Gayomard acquired an added dimension: he became the first world-king. Popular imagination added details, particularly, it seems, concerning his struggle with Ahriman. Bal'ami2 devotes an unusually long passage to Gayomard's revenge on Ahriman for having killed his son.3
The accounts of Islamic writers throw some light on how the myths of Gayomard and the first couple were presented in Sasanian historical tradition. Our most revealing source is Hamza;4 he tells us that he came across material which was included in the Khwaday-ndmag^ but which had been omitted by Ibn al-Muqaffa' and Muhammad ibn al-Jahm, and he then delivers an account which conforms to that of Pahlavi sources, notably the Bundahishn (i a and xiv). Although Hamza says in a later passage that he has taken his information from some commentary on the Avesta, this statement does not change the validity of his account as a rendering of the Sasanian form of the myth. In its basic form, this account is echoed also in Baraml5and Blruni.6In another short account by Hamza7 taken from the Mobad Bahram ibn Mardanshah, who according to Hamza had compared twenty manuscripts of the Khwaddyndmag, we find the legend somewhat subdued. Here Gayomard is the first man and rules for 30 years; Mashya and Mashyana are his progeny, who, though sterile for seventy years, eventually produce eighteen children in the course of fifty years. The role of Gayomard in the struggle between Ohrmazd and Ahriman, and mention of the Bull and the rhubarb plant, are omitted. It is obvious that in Bahram's version all

8 I find little justification for interpreting as "Gayomard" a grotesque anthropomorphic figure (Phyllis Ackerman, SPA., p. 799) which occurs on Sasanian seals and which is often surrounded by some animal figures, such as a dog, a cock, a scorpion, snakes, etc; cf. Bivar, WesternAsiatic Seals, p. 26; C. Brunner, in R. N. Frye (ed.), Catalog of Sasanian Stamp Seals in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, pp. 68flf. The figures most probably have an astrological basis, but the passages in the Bundahishn and Zdtsparam relating to the contaminated world to which Gayomard awakens after he recovers from the initial shock of his injuries can hardly explain the various details of such seals. Ackerman's interpretation remains highly
speculative. 4 P. 64. 6 P. 113. 6 P. 103. 7 P. 24.

aspects ofthe legend which could have offended Muslim sensibilities are eliminated. But such omissions and modifications must be traced to Ibn alMuqaffa' and other early translators, who had left out what could not beeasily understood bytheir readers. Other accounts byIslamic writers often combine elements of the original myth with later additions or distortions through Biblical orIslamic influences.
The standard form ofthe later versions deriving from the translations of the Khwaddj-ndmag is the one which we find inFirdausi. Callling Gayomard the first king may bedueto assignment to himofa position of supremacy in the more ancient accounts. Already in the Aogemadaecd, 85 -7, heis called king ofthe world, with the appellation Gar-shdh " king of the mountains", later often mistaken (even in Denkard 11. 35.2)for Gil-shdh "king of clay", possibly under the influence of the Biblical myths of creation1 and a misreading ofPahlavl r for /, both of which have thesame shape incursive writing.

Hoshang's title was later interpreted as to mean the one who first gave law or rendered justice (dad).3 From his Avestan title, paradhdta, we maysurmise that hewas once considered in some local myths tobe the first man andthat later themyth was absorbed by the Avestan tradition. Some references tohim in later sources as the parent of the Iranian race strengthen this impression (see below). It is to be noted that he does not have a counterpart in Indian mythology and therefore must be regarded as an Iranian figure.

particularly the demons, sorcerers and evil creatures of those regions that he subdues and rules. This association may reflect a memory of some hard-won conquests there byvictorious Iranian invaders. The gap between Gayomard and Hoshang was filled with a seriesof generations which begot the human races. When Gayomard came to be accounted thefirst king, theperiod between him and Hoshang was given asaninterregnum. Firdausi ignores the interregnum and makes Hoshang a grandson of Gayomard and his cherished adviser (dastur), who avenges the death ofhis father Siyamak atthe hand of Ahriman by killing Ahriman's son in battle. This story seems to be a reversal or modification of the Arzur myth referred to earlier.1 The majority of other sources, including the Bundahishn?Tabari3 and Mas'udi,4 place three generations between Gayomard and Hoshang, namely Mashya, Siyamak and Fravak. The name ofthe female member of each pair, that is the wife/sister, appears to have been originally a feminine form of the name ofthe male counterpart, and although the forms recorded in Middle Persian and Perso-Arab sources are often corrupt, this pattern can be seen in thename of Mashyana and its variants,5 and in other forms, such as Siyami6 and Fravaken.7 The ancient Yima-Yimi (Ved. Yama-Yami) isthe oldest instance ofsuch pairs.
The fact that some Islamic works reflecting the late Sasanian writings mention Hoshang, rather than Gayomard, asthe first king revealsthe ambiguity ofthe Sasanian views regarding the first king.8 On the other hand, according toFirdausi and a number of other sources9 Hoshang is Gayomard's successor on the throne. The difference probably originates in thediscrepancy between regional traditions.10 Pahlavi andIslamic sources do not add much towhat one gains from the surviving Avesta itself and from the Denkard summaries ofits missing portions, but they expatiate on the excellence ofHoshang, his wisdom and justice, and his civilizing endeavours. Whereas the civilizing activities of Hoshang were emphasized in the Khwaday-ndmag, it is his battle against the devs and his appeals for divine assistance which are stressed in the Yashts. Hoshang's discovery offire, cited by Firdausi, isobviously a rather late and popular account, which could not have originated in priestly circles, and since it isnot compatible with Avestan cosmology, it must refer to the discovery ofthe way of"making'* a fire.

Tahmorath. Like Hoshang, Tahmorath is not known in Indian mythology, but his appearance in the Yashts1 assures the antiquity of his myth. According toa tradition quoted by Blrunl2it was Gayomard, not Tahmorath, who rode onAhriman - an instance of floating motifs in Iranian myths and legends.3 The demons' revelation of the art of writing to Tahmorath, a story mentioned in both Pahlavi and Islamic sources,4 probably preserved the memory ofthe acquisition of writing by Iranian tribes from the former inhabitants of Iran.
In some Islamic sources,6 Tahmorath has been called the first king, possibly owing to a divergent view in original Sasanian writings. The fact that on occasion an entire millennium has been given as hislifespan6 also seems to indicate a position of high importance in some of the early accounts of him. This is further confirmed bythe appearance of his name in the Mandean Book of Kings, Sidra Rabbd, immediately after Gayomard, with a reign of 600 years.7
Christensen has advanced atheory8 according to which both Hoshang and Tahmorath have been adopted into Iranian legends from the Scythians. This theory is chiefly based on thename Arpoxais, which occurs in Herodotus iv. 5,asthat ofa son of the first man. Christensen derives the first part ofthe name from *3r3pa, which he sees inAvestan Urupa. Whatever thecase may be, theplacing of Hoshang andTahmorath between Gayomard and Yima, the original first man, demands an explanation. Probably here we are dealing with the first kings orfirst men who belonged tothe myth cycles ofdifferent Iranian tribes, myths which were assimilated by the Avestan people inpre-Zoroastrian times.
Jamshed. Jamshed (Av. Yima.xsaeta), whohas been the subject of extensive research and speculation among scholars, is common to both Indian and Iranian mythology. He is the only one of the Iranian " kings " who is mentioned in the Gathas (see below.) It is notpossible, of course, to determine just when in history the various transformations inthe myth ofJamshed took place. In Sasanian times he emerges ai a wise and powerful "king'' who succeeded his brother Tahmorath tothe throne. As anideal king and law-giver, he is credited with many wise acts and institutions. He is said to have brought

people back to moderation (padmdn).1 The farrah enables him to ward
off death from his subjects, who live lives oftotal bliss. But then he is
carried away byhis successes and claims divine power. Subsequently,
the farrah departs from him. In the Gathas, inaunique passage,2 he iscounted among sinners and is said (according to some translations) tobe the first to have given men pieces of meat to eat. Much has been made of this passage in a reconstruction of pre-Zoroastrian ^mz-worship, the blood-sacrifice among pagan Iranians, and the nature ofthe prophet's reform. But the passage is far from clear and is variously rendered by different scholars.3 It can hardly be inferred from it, therefore, that Yima's sinwasthe institution of blood-sacrifice, aswas held previously, since there is no evidence that the prophet prohibited this custom. Animal sacrifice has always featured among Zoroastrian rites.4 In the post-Gathic Avesta, however, Yima isrestored tothe position of pre-eminence which hemust have enjoyed inpagan times. Yasna 9. 3-5 tells usthat as a reward for being the first topress the sacred plant haoma,Vivarjhvant was given Yima asa son. Inthe Yashts we readof Jamshed's sacrificing thestereotyped number of animals - a hundred stallions, a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep - to various deities including Arsdvi Sura, Drvaspa, Vayu andXvaranah. He asks for sovereignty over men inall the world and the power tosubdue demons and tobring well-being and immortality tomen and animals, and these petitions are granted.5His regular epithets are two: one isxsaeta (Mid. Pers. -shed) "prince, king" which may derive from an earlier meaning, "brilliant, glowing"6(cf. Av. hvarz.xsaeta, Mid. Pers. xwarsed "glowing sun, the sun"); the other is hvathva (Mid. Pers. translation hii-ramafe) "possessor ofgood herds".
In thesecond chapter of the Videvddd, cosmological andeschatological roles are assigned to Yima. He is the first to receive the guardianship ofthe world from Ahura Mazda. He reigns over aworld free from death, pain andcorruption. Three times, magically, he enlarges the extent ofthe earth in order to accommodate the increasing number of men, animals and other creatures. He rules for 1,000 years before Ahura

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
Mazda warns him in an assembly of the gods andbest of men that winters with destructive snowstorms and frost will descend upon the visible world. He isinstructed by Ahura Mazda tobuild a subterranean fortress (the Var), and to bring into itpairs of the finest men and women, animals and the seeds of all the best plants and fruits, sothat when all the other creatures of the earth aredestroyed by thesnowstorm, the inhabitants ofthe Var may survive.1 The summaries of the lost nasksof the Avesta given in the Denkard VIII and ix do notadd any new information ofsubstance to what can be gleaned from the extant Avesta. There can belittle doubt that Yima was originally conceived as the first man among theIndo-Iranians. Traces of this concept survive in Yasht 13. 130, where Yima is mentioned at the head of a list of kings and heroes whose fravasis are venerated; confirmation exists in Vedic mythology, which identifies Yama as the first man.2 Among both peoples, as is to be expected, the first man is made immortal3 and elevated almost to the rank ofthe gods.4 In Iran, asthe first man Yima also becomes the first ruler, reigning over a paradise free from need, death and disease. InIndia, as the man who dies first and therefore goes first to the realm of the departed, Yama becomes king of the dead and receiver ofdeparted souls.5 In India, Yama also has a sinister aspect and is practically identified with the dread figure ofdeath itself. His messengers carry off the doomed tohis kingdom beneath the earth, the entrance to which isguarded by his two vigilant dogs. InIran, also, it seems that Yima's abode was originally imagined to bea subterranean one.6 His Var was tobebuilt underground, and possibly it istoYima that Herodotus VII. 114 refers when he mentions an underworld god propitiated by the Persians. In the Avesta Yima is the first to press haoma for sacrifice, whereas inthe Vedas heis the one who procures fire formen.
As is sometimes the case with primitive gods, primitive heroes tend to fade intime, orbe transformed inpopular beliefs, surrendering their places to other figures more recently adopted. In India, Yama's attributes as the first man, and therefore the father of humanity, are transferred toManu.7 InIran, the Zoroastrian reform obviously changed the

pagan notion of Yima. It presumably assigned theunderworld to be his kingdom. Eventually, when the older beliefs were adopted into the Zoroastrianism of the Yashts, Yima emerged as the ruler of a golden age. The features of Yima as thefirst man were transferred partly to Gayomard, including his affinity with the sun,1 and partly to Mashya and Mashyana, who may be viewed as a reinterpretation of the original couple, Yima and Yiml. Some of Yima's aspects asthe agent of death seem tohave been taken over by Vayu, and by Asto-vidhatu, demon of death.2 Yima isthen assigned the role ofthe first king, a function transferred later to Hoshang and eventually to Gayomard. Yima presiding over the golden age of man loses none of his splendour, remaining a colourful and potent figure in both priestly writings and popular imagination.
There is yet another aspect to the power and piety of Yima in Iranian tradition, namely his fall from grace. In the Avesta this is expressed bythe departure ofthe xvaranah from him asa result ofhis submission to the Lie.3 The xvaranah departs from him three times in the form ofa visible bird and is seized in turn by Mithra, Fredon and Karshasp (apparently those who helped defeat Dahak), whereasAzi Dahaka fails inhis attempt toseize it. The sin attributed toJamshed in the Pahlavl books isnot made entirely clear in the Avesta, which merely notes his temptation by the devs and his submission tothe Lie. Pahlavl books andIslamic sources elaborate on his sins of lying, pride, ingratitude towards God and his claim of divinity.
Beyond being a common motif in many myths concerned with a golden age followed by adecline, the myth of Yima's fall may have been influenced primarily by Zoroaster's apparent disapproval of him and also bySemitic myths ofthe fall ofman. The myth ofhis riding in the sky drawn by demons, which is found also among theepisodes of Kavus's reign, may have been evolved toexpress both his might and a prelude to hisfall. It also offers an explanation forthe advent of Azi Dahaka, whose reign begins immediately after that ofJamshed, ushering in the second millennium ofworld history.
Jamshed's identification with King Solomon in popular belief is of course a product of Islamic times. As a figure who has captured the imagination of the people, he hasattracted to himself a number of legendary and folkloristic motifs, such as possession of a magiccup

Dahdk (Av. A%i dahdka, Perso-Arab. Dahhak). Dahak appears in the Avesta as a"three-headed, three-mouthed and six-eyed" monster; he is chief among the demons whom Ahriman created for the destruction of the world.1 Probably Dahak's myth incorporates the notion of a natural phenomenon, destructive drought. InYasht 5.29-31 he issaid to have sacrificed unsuccessfully to Aradvi Sura in order to obtain the power to destroy the race of men in the seven climes (lit. to make them amasya "without men"). Equally unsuccessful was hisattempt to seizethe divine xvaranah on behalf of Aggra Mainyu (Ahriman) in a contest between thelatter andSpsnta Mainyu "the Bounteous Spirit".2His sacrifice to Arodvl Sura takes place in Bawri, which in the Pahlavi literature is generally rendered asBabylon, but which, in view of the antiquity of the myth, must originally have been associated with an eastern Iranian location.3 Atrace ofhis eastern origin may be seen in a tradition preserved in the Shdh-ndma,according towhich the houseof Mihrab inKabul descended from Dahak. His association with Babylon can have taken place only when the eastern Iranian people came into contact with Mesopotamia.
In later times Arabia, associated with marauding bands and noted for its arid wastes, took the place ofBabylon and Dahak was called TazI, "Arab". Although the transfer is likely to have taken place after the Muslim invasion as an expression of anti-Arab feeling, an earlier replacement, prompted bythe Arab raids in Sasanian times, notably during thereigns of Shapur II (4th century) and Hormazd IV (6th century) cannot be ruled out. In the evolution of Iranian myths, Dahak takes his place among the figures of national history as a tyrant who overthrows Jamshed and rules theworld as an agent of Evil for a thousand years. Inthe religious tradition ofthe Pahlavi books, Dahak is an arch-demon and a sorcerer, who defeats theglorious Jamshed and continues tobring destruction tothe world until he is smitten by Fredon, who restores order and justice. Imprisoned inMount Demavand, thetyrant will finally be destroyed in thelast millennium by Karshasp.4 Inthe Khwaddy-ndmag, where \ie was personified as a tyrant

and king, he was also provided with a genealogy and made a descendant of Taz, son of Fravak, son of Siyamak.1 The Bundahishn makes his mother a descendant of Ahriman, eight generations removed. A relic of his serpentine form is found in thetwo snakes which grow on his shoulders. According to Firdausl, his destructive acts against mankind were mainly theresult of the snakes' need to feed on human brains. The Shah-namcfs detailed account ofDahak seems to incorporate also a good many popular stories, some of which, such as thestory of his parricide, must beof late origin.
Fredon (Av. Thraetaona; Pers. Firedun). Fredon belongs to IndoIranian myth and isrelated tothe Vedic figure Trita. His father Athwya (Ved. Aptya, Mid. Pers. Asbian, Pers. Abtin) was, according to Yasht 9. 6-8, thesecond to press the haoma plant and in reward was given Thraetaona as a son. The Vedas also know a Trita Aptya who, like Fredon, slays a demon Visvarupa, which resembles A2i Dahaka in that it also is serpent-bodied, three-headed and six-eyed.2 The chief achievement of Fredon is the overwhelming of Dahak. Fredon sacrifices to a number of deities and asks for victory over Dahak. The following passage3 addressed to the yazad of reward, Asi, is typical:
To her did Thraetaona, the heir to the valiant house ofAthwya, offer up a sacrifice in the four-cornered Varana. Hebegged of her a boon, saying: "Grant methis favour, O great andgood Asi, that I may overcome A%i Dahaka, the three-mouthed, the three-headed, the six-eyed, with athousand ruses, that most powerful, fiendish demon, wicked, who deceives the world,the strongest demon that Arjgra Mainyu created against the visible world, todestroy the world oftruth; and that I may carry away his two beloved Sarjhavak and Aranavak, who are the fairest of
body for fecundity, and the most wonderful forthe household.4
Here we may take note ofthe motif in Iranian myths and legends of the killing ofa dragon or serpent bya hero. The theme is common to most mythologies. Zeus and Typhon, Marduk and Tiamat, Gilgamesh and Khumbaba, Apollo and Python, Herakles and the Hydra, Thor and Jormungand aresome of the better known examples. In Vedic India the theme is represented by Indras' killing ofthe serpent (Ved. ahi9 Av.

aft) Vrtra and Trita's slaying ofVisvarupa. InIran the primal instances are afforded byThraetaona and A2i Dahaka, and Karasaspa and A2i Sruvara. Other examples are seen in the "Seven Stations" of both Rustam and Isfandiyar, in Ardashlr's slaying of Haftanbukht and in popular legends attributed tomany Iranian heroes. Infolktales, hidden treasures are often guarded by serpents or dragons, symbolizing impediments and hostile forces.
The myth of the serpent Vrtra hasproduced a good deal of dis
cussion among Indo-Iranianists.1 InVedic mythology the warrior god Indra slays Vrtra and releases the waters which it had withheld. InIran the war god Varathraghna, the first part of whose name, vdrdthray corresponds toVrtra, appears tobeinmany respects a counterpart of Indra. Benveniste, however, argued that Vrtra/Varathra was a neuter
noun meaning "resistance, blockage, hostility"2 and that the notionof a serpent was a later derivation from another epithet ofIndra, vrtrahan,
"resistance breaker, victorious,"3and that the serpent Vrtra was alien to Iran. Further he concluded that Vsrathraghna was the original IndoIranian wargod, andIndra a later legendary figure who inherited
Varathraghna's features.4 This argument, however, has not found
universal acceptance,5 but attempts to prove that Varathraghna in Iran originally shared with Indra the myth ofkilling aserpent have not been
entirely successful either.6
The division of the world by Fredon among histhree sons, Salm
(or Sarm),7 Tur (or Tuch8 from *Turac) and Eraj, the founders of the nations of the Khwanlrah, is not referred to directly in the extant Avesta, but the Denkardmentions it inits summary ofthe lost Cbihrddd Nask, Although theidentification of the race of Salm (Av. Sairima) with the people of Rum is a late development, perhaps dating to mid-Parthian times, thestory itself must be considerably older. The race of Salm must have referred originally to a hostile neighbouring tribe ofthe Iranians inthe east, who were possibly absorbed by either

the Turanians orIranians,1 and, inany event, did not find a prominent place inthe Iranian saga. Later its place was given to the western people of Rum in the same way that the Turanians were later identified with the Turks.
In Islamic and Middle Persian sources Fredon is made a descendant of Jamshed generally by ten generations, the names of which are suffixed by the wotdgdv "cow".2 A trace ofthis, which appears tohave totemic origins, is seen inFirdausi's Birmaya, the cow which nourishes Fredon while he is brought up in secret for fear of Dahak.3 In thePahlavl literature, Fredon is pictured asa righteous king who is destined to defeat Dahak and to restore the legitimacy of kingship. The story of Kava theSmith and hisrevolt against Dahak, which was obviously created toaccount for the name ofthe national banner, drafsb ikdviydn, must have attached itself to the legend ofFredon in Sasanian times.
Karsbdsp (Av. Karasaspa). The third figure to press haoma, according to the Avesta,4was Thrita ofthe house of Sama. Comparable toAesculapius inclassical mythology, Thrita ispictured as the first to introduce medicine, to cure illness and to heal wounds received in battle. As a reward Ahura Mazda gives him two sons, one Karasaspa (Karshasp), a mighty warrior, and the other Urvaxsaya, a healer, a holy man and a law-giver. Urvaxsaya is killed byone Hitaspa and is duly avenged by Karasaspa.5 The latter grows to be a Herculean figure and themost celebrated warrior ofAvestan legends. It isonly inthe later traditions, and more particularly after Firdausi, that Rustam rises to dominate the Iranian epic. Karasaspa isalso one ofthe Immortals ofthe Zoroastrian faith and plays a significant role in the final millennium asa helper of the Sosyant. Whereas in other cases the information that the Avesta provides is fragmentary at best, in the case of K^r^saspa the Avesta gives us all thebasic information that wehave in thePahlavl books.6 His chief exploits are: the slaying of the golden-heeled monster Gandarswa, after having sacrificed to Aradvl Sura onthe shores oflake Pisinarjh;7 the slaying ofthe venomous dragon Sruvara8(lit. "horned"); the slaying of the nine sons of Pathanya, the sons of Nivika, the sons of

Dastayani, Histaspa of the golden crown, Varasava of thehouse of Dana, Pitaona, the mighty Arazo.svamasa, and the horny-handed Snavidhaka;1 and the taming of the vehement and destructive wind.2 Later Zoroastrian sources count among the victims of the hero a rainwithholding bird Kamak, and a wolf Kapud, which the Menog I Khrad3 calls also Pehan ( < Pathanya?). There canbe little doubt that each episode was amplified with details in the oral tradition. Some Avestan passages,4 aswell as some of the later renderings, show epic qualities. Karasaspa's main epithets inAvestan are naire.manah "of manly mind", gadhavara"mace carrying" and gaesua "curly haired".5 In later tradition naire.manah has been personified in the form of Neram and Nareman, anancestor of Rustam.
The Videvddd ix. i seems to associate Karasaspa with the Vaekarata region, generally assumed to refer to Gandhara, and the Bundahishn xxix. 8, I I , relates that helies in the plain of Peshyansi in Kabulistan, overcome by Sleep, until the advent of the Soshyant, when hewillbe awakened. According to the nth-century anonymous "History of Sistan", the kingdom of Sistan was founded byKarshasp.6
The Zoroastrian tradition about Karshasp, however, is somewhat ambiguous, since he is also indirectly associated with unholy deeds. The summary of the Chihrddd Nask,7 whose 15 th chapter dealt with Karshasp, refers to hisdisgrace: Ahura Mazda shows Zoroaster in a vision the pitiable state into which the soul ofKarshasp had fallen onaccount of the disrespect he hadshown to Fire. The prophet intercedes on his behalf and ensures that Fire will exempt Karshasp from consignment to hell. Another episode which sheds an unfavourable light on Karshasp's career is related inthe Videvddd ix. 1; it mentions Karshasp's attraction to a female demon (pairikd), Xnathaiti, whom Ahriman created in Vaekarata. In addition, in theBundahishn xxix. 8, it is said that Sam (i.e. Karshasp, see below) wasimmortal, but when he scorned the revelation ofthe Mazdayasnian religion, a Turk (i.e. a Turanian), Nain by name, slew him with an arrow while he was asleep. Further, his genealogy as given inthe Bundahishn under the name ofSam,8 as wellas one ofthe two genealogies given by Tabari,9 traces his ancestry to Tur and therefore makes him a blood-relation ofthe Turanians. The second genealogy given by Tabari, on the other hand, makes Karshasp descend

from Manuchihr. In another passage of the Denkard which is repeated in a rivayat, Karshasp is counted together with Jamshed andFredon and Kai Arish among those who received the good religion, but did not accept it, because the demon (drug) ofdisobedience residing inthem was too strong.1 Inthe Yashts, atany event, Karshasp assumes all his might and brilliance andtakes hisplace among the Zoroastrian Immortals. Thus, when the farrah departed from Yima for the third time, Karshasp is said to have received it (Yasht 19. 38). Karshasp's body, guardedby 99,999 fravasis of righteous men (Yasht 13. 61), is eventually resuscitated during the last millennium as a major helper ofthe Sosyant andas the destroyer of Dahak, whom he slays with hismace2 after a fierce contest.
A possible explanation for this peculiar ambivalence towards Karshasp may be that Zoroaster in his high-minded concentration on Ahura Mazda frowned upon this pagan hero, asalso upon many pagan deities who were vividly pictured inpopular lore. But the legends concerning Karshasp - the product of a heroic age - continued nevertheless in popularity, and bythe time the Yashts were redacted it was seenfitto restore him, like Yima, tohis original status ina Zoroastrian guise. His later association with the house ofZal may then have strengthened the baleful aspect ofhis legends inreligious circles. On the other hand, it is also possible that such legends, like many myths, did not always depict their heroes or gods asbeyond reproach, but included failures of deed and judgement that a balanced picture of human predicaments would warrant, andthat such myths andlegends continued to preserve the conflicting qualities of the god or hero, even though this figure received the sanction of a subsequent religious tradition. The application of the structural theory of myth, as developed byClaude LeviStrauss andhis followers,3 to the interpretation of such myths and legends, might provide anexplanation forthe frequent ups and downs, paradoxes and contradictions that we find inthe careers ofsome Iranian heroes such as Jamshed, Karshasp and Siyavush. Thus Karshaspa's sleep may possibly be considered a mitigation of his damnation, or Siyavush's self-imposed exile, a mediation at onelevel between

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
the polar extremes of his father's wrath and his step-mother's embrace. When the ancient epics were being arranged as historical accounts, the status of Karshasp andhis chronology remained somewhat uncertain. He isgenerally placed atthe end ofthe Pishdadian dynasty and associated with Zab. The Bundahishn does not call hima king, but simply mentions hisname after Kai Khusrau.1 The Denkard2 and the Mendgi Khradzlist him among the kings, but, oddly enough, place him between Kai Kavad andKavus. The Islamic historians make hima co-ruler with Zab, or hisminister and helper, or his successor,4 or a king under him.5 Tabarl notes the variation in the tradition, but concludes that he did not have kingship.6 This instability mayindicate that the cycle ofhis legends originally belonged to a separate oral tradition and wasnever fully reconciled with thesequence of events inthe central national epic.
The Karshasp of the Islamic sources haslittle resemblance to the Avestan Karasaspa. Almost none ofhis ancient legends are mentioned.7 His life-story according to much later versions is the. subject of the Garshdsp-ndma versified by Asadi inthe n t h century. Here he ismade a descendant, through several generations, of Jamshed and the daughter of the king of Zabul, whom Jamshed marries in exile.8 His many exploits take him toIndia, several wondrous and bizarre islands,Rum, North Africa, Turan and China. He fights a number ofwars onbehalf of Dahak, defeats the Faghfur ofChina, offers allegiance toFredon and sends his sonNareman to the royal court with the message of his Successes in China, and dies after making Nareman his successor. The book contains a large number of stories of a popular character which appear to belate concoctions.
In Islamic sources Rustam ismade a descendant ofKarshasp through generations which differ in number in thevarious accounts. Biruni,who records anearlier version of this development, makes Karshasp(Sam) the father of Dastan (Zal); but, in the Shdh-ndma^ hiseponym Sam is made into a separate hero, who appears under Fredon and Manuchihr as a son of Neram and as thefather of Zal. Thus Karasaspa, his clan name (Sama) and his epithet (naire.manah) are made into three different

figures: Karshasp, Sam(or Sahm) and Neram (or Nareman),1 all firmly
based in Sistan.2 The connection between Karshasp and Rustam isproblematic. Both are Herculean figures related to Sistan. Since thesimilarities of their exploits aremore apparent than real (see below, p. 453), they must belong to separate cycles of heroic stories. It is probable that the two cycles belonged to two different peoples whosettled in Sistan,3 Karshasp pertaining to the more ancient settlers of Drangiana,4 and Rustam to the later Saka tribes. If this should bethe case, then making Karshasp an ancestor ofRustam ata later date would be readily understandable. The gradual fading away ofthe legends ofKarshasp before the fresher legends ofthe conquering Sakas would be understandable, too.
Manuchihr is mentioned in the Avesta only once (Yasht 13. 131). His name(Av. Manusciflra, Mid. Pers. Manu(s)cihr) means "from the race of Manu", andrefers to theancient mythical figure, Manu, son of Vivasvant, who was regarded inIndia as the first man and father of the human race.5 Hehas no place in Iranian tradition, where hisrole is played by Yima, and later Gayomard. Itappears, though, that we havea derivative of his name inManush (Yasht 19. 1),the name of a mountain which is identified in theBundahishn (ix. 3. 13)as belonging to the Alburz chain and asthe birthplace ofManuchihr. As a proper name, Manush also occurs in a number ofinstances in Pahlavi books, notably in the genealogies of Maniichihr6 and Luhrasp.7 In theAvesta, Manuchihr is called Airyava, "helper of the Aryans" (Av. Airya).8 Airya is also the base for the name ofIran ( < Airyanam) aswell as Eraj ( < Erec < Airya + — e of the oblique case + — r). It isevidently on this ground that the Avesta traces Manuchihr's descent from Eraj. Sources differ in characterizing the generations which intervene between Manuchihr and Eraj. They range from placing 13 generations between them,9 to making Manuchihr animmediate son of Eraj.10But it is clear that his lineage from Eraj was through Eraj's daughter. A

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
tradition quoted by Tabari i. 431 relates that Fredon married Eraj's daughter as well as a succession of her female descendants, until Manuchihr was born. This must have its explanation in the ancient Iranian custom ofagnatic marriage, the purpose ofwhich was to secure male successors to a deceased person without a male heir.
Although generally counted asa member ofthe Pishdadian dynasty, Manuchihr infact begins a new era of the national history. The world is no longer ruled by asingle king. Aferocious feud has started between Iranians and Turanians, and Manuchihr must contend with a powerful rival. That his reign was considered a turning point can beseen from the division by some sources of the ancient Iranian kings into three groups instead oftwo,1 namely, the Pishdadis, who ended with Fredon; the Ailanis (Airanis) who began with Manuchihr, andthe Kayanis. As in thecase of Gayomard, Hoshang, Jamshed, andFredon, there appears tobea certain "primacy" about Manuchihr. He displays some features ofaprimeval man which have become blurred inthe context of the national history.2 According to a tradition recorded by Mas'udi,3 "he [Manuchihr] is like a tree [with its] branches for Iranian genealogy"; and "he has seven children, towhom are traced the majority of Iranian tribes and their kings intheir genealogies". Inhis genealogyas given in the Bundahishn, we find that his ancestors consist of brothersister pairs, a feature found also in the case of Hoshang. In later traditions Manuchihr is credited with great wisdom and glory. These traits are tobe expected ina primeval man orking. Inthis light, the comparable position ofManu inIndian mythology takes on new relevance. We may speculate that Manu, who must have been known to the Iranians also in remote antiquity, gradually conceded his place in some Iranian region to his "son", whose legends then spread to other regions.
Manuchihr's chief achievement is avenging Eraj, but asthe national historical tradition took shape, he was also made a contemporary of Afrasiyab, who after attacking and defeating Iran rules the countryfor twelve years before aprecarious peace is made between the two nations.
Successors ofManuchihr. Manuchihr's defeat at the hand of Afrasiyab furnishes yet another instance ofa great king who suffers collapse after reaching thepinnacle of power and fame. There is considerable confusion in our sources asto the identity ofManuchihr's successor, with

THE PISHDADIAN DYNASTY
indications ofsome hesitant patchwork on the part ofSasanian historiographers. Firdausi1 gives Manuchihr's son Naudhar as hissuccessor and depicts him as an oppressive and greedy monarch who neglects the advice of his father and causes great discontent among the nobles and priesthood. Asemblance of peace between Afrasiyab and Manuchihr is maintained for a while, but Naudhar's accession affords Afrasiyab an opportune moment to strike and avenge the blood of Tur by killing the new king. Mujmal al-Tawdrikh assigns seven months ofkingship to Naudhar and mentions five years and twenty years as other reports.2 Naudhar isnot mentioned directly inthe Avesta, but Naotairya occurs several times asaneponymous adjective.3 As the father ofTus, oneof the Zoroastrian Immortals, and asthe ancestor ofthe Kayanian kings, Naudhar must have occupied a venerable position in early Iranian legends. But his inclusion among the kings must have been a very late tradition, notuniversally followed, as indeed neither Tabarl, Hamza, Mas'udI, Biruni, nor the Pahlavl sources know him as a king. His kingship must have been invented in the sources of Firdausi to provide a framework for theinitial wars of Afrasiyab against Iran and for the exploits ofKaren and Zal against some ofAfrasiyaVs warriors.
The successor of Manuchihr, according to most sources,4 was Zab (Av. Uzava, Mid. Pers. Auzav, in Arabic sources, Zaww), son of Tahmasp (Av. Tumaspa), who is mentioned in theAvesta only once (Yasht 13. 131), after Thraetaona and before Manuschithra. The Denkard VIII. 13. 11, onthe other hand, inits summary ofthe Chihrddd Nask9 mentions Zab asa son of Tahmasp and a king of Iran between Afrasiyab and Kai Kavad. Elsewhere (vn. 1.31) the Denkard mentions Zab as a descendant of Manuchihr. Therefore we must conclude that this tradition, which isalso followed inthe Bundahishnb and by Hamza,6 is not recent but dates atleast from the early Parthian period. There is, however, considerable disagreement and confusion among the sources on Zab's descent, the number ofhis regnal years, and the nature ofhis association with Karshasp. Tabarl quotes several traditions about Zab's lineage: in one he is a grandson of Manuchihr7 and in another he is separated from Naudhar by ten generations.8 A story mentioned by Tabarl about the flight of Zab's father to Turan and his marriage to a descendant ofSalm must have been modelled on the legend ofSiyavush.

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
Despite the relative antiquity of his account and his reported defeat of Afrasiyab, Zab remains a rather colourless and unexciting figure. He serves mainly to fill a gap between Manuchihr and Kai Kavad. Since Zab is mentioned in Yasht 13 before Manuchihr, it is to be concluded that inearly Zoroastrian times his place, like that ofKarshasp, had not yet been fixed in the hierarchy of national heroes, and only later, possibly in Parthian times, was he placed at the tail-end ofthe Pishdadian kings.
THE KAYANIAN ERA
With the Kayanians, we enter the second major era ofnational history. Whereas earlier kings are often of a mythical nature, and only artificially related by the medieval genealogies, the Kayanian kings from Kai Kavad to Kai Khusrau form a coherent group which exhibits dynastic features. Although their legends abound in mythical details and fantastic episodes, it is generally held that there must be a basis in the ancient history of the Avestan people for the extant account of them. Therefore it is thought that with theKayanians wepass from chiefly mythical to legendary history. Christensen has argued vigorously for the historicity of the Kayanians in his standard monograph on the subject1 and his views have found wide acceptance. The name of the dynasty, Kayan ( < Kavyan), is theplural of kai (Av. kavi), the title ofthe princes ofthis House. InMiddle Persian and Persian, kai has come to mean "king", with the adjective kaydnt assuming the meaning of "royal" or "regal", but the uses of kavi in the Avesta present some problems. In the Vedas, kavi meant a seer, a sage, acomposer of hymns, who could produce kdvya,mantic utterances, particularly when stimulated by drinking soma2 In the Gathas, the kavis appear tobethe leaders ofthe community3 of daeva-worshippers who refused to accept the teaching of Zoroaster. The prophet talksof them and of the karpans and usigs, members of the priestly class, as his enemies and detractors. But King Vishtaspa, the prophet's supporter, is also called a kavi inthe Gathas. In Middle Iranian Manichaean writings, kav is used in thesense of "giant".4 As used in theGathas the term, which implies some form of military leadership, may point to the rise of a class of warrior princes from a class which combined spiritual and temporal powers as a result of the spread of heroic

THE KAYANIAN ERA
conditions among the Avestan tribes. Gershevitch, however, has sought to solve the contradiction in the Avestan usage of kavi by removing the meaning of "prince, ruler" and postulating that the Iranian kavis were, like their Indian counterparts, composers of hymns to various gods. One kavi family, that of the Kayanians, rose to temporal power and "used the professional description kavi as its personal dynastic surname".1 Zarathustra, in addressing his protector as kavi Vistaspa, would not have associated the king's dynastic name with the class name of the priestly hymn-writers, for the dynastic name, according to Gershevitch, affected the later semantic developments of kavi, and its original meaning eventually fell into disuse. This attractive theory, however, requires a reinterpretation of the Gathic passages where kavi has been thought to occur with the implication of rulership.2
Although in post-Avestan tradition the Kayanians number fourteen, it is clear from the Avesta that the first eight form a distinct group and belong to a pre-Avestan tradition. These eight, according to the Zamyad Yasht, 70-2, were all in possession of the royal farrah and were all heroic, righteous and fearless. They also figure among the heroes whose fravashis are commemorated in the Farvardin Yasht, 132. They are enumerated in the Zamyad Yasht, 71, as follows: Kavi Kavata, Kavi Aipi.vanhu, Kavi Usadhan (Usan in Yashts 5.45 and 14.39), Kavi Arsan, Kavi Pisinagh, Kavi Byarsan, Kavi Syavarsan and Kavi Haosravah. Only Kavi Kavata (Kai Kavad), Kavi Usan (Kavus), and Kavi Haosravah (Kai Khusrau) are recognized in post-Avestan tradition as kings. Others appear mostly in genealogies and have left but a dim memory of themselves.
The second phase of the Kayanian rule consists of the reign of Luhrasp and Gushtasp and includes the holy wars of the Zoroastrians and the exploits of Isfandiyar. This phase must be considered an independent cycle. It pictures a different environment and different personae. Luhrasp and Gushtasp, their chief antagonist, Arjasp, and Gushtasp's trusted adviser and vizier, Jamasp, all have names ending with Av. aspa "horse", which must refer to a chief element in the culture and the animal husbandry of their respective tribes. The tenuous connection between Luhrasp and the last of the original Kayanian line Kai Khusrau has all the marks of artificiality and indicates a gap, the length of which

is hard todetermine. It isnot improbable that the house of Gushtasp's claim of descent from early Kayanians is similar to the claim of the Parthians and Sasanians, much later, tolate Kayanian descent.
The third phase ofthe Kayanian rule from Bahman toDara is again marked by new and distinctive features which setit apart from the second phase and bring it into historical times. Although the reality of Vishtaspa's existence and the chief events of his career cannot be seriously doubted, historical facts about the other Kayanians, from Kai Kavad to Kai Khusrau, are more elusive. The identification ofthe Kayanian and Achaemenian kings, however, which was advocated by some scholars, notably J. Hertel^has no basis in reality,2as was soundly demonstrated by Christensen.3
The geographical milieu of the Kayanians. Avestan references tothe
Kayanian kings leave no doubt that it is to eastern Iran, namely the region comprising Chorasmia, Sogdiana, Margiana, Bactria, Herat and the basin of the river Helmand that we should look forthe cradleof the Iranian historical tradition. Western and southern Iran areconspicuously absent from this tradition. No mention of Media or Persia occurs in the Avesta. The only exception is Rhages (Rayy), which as the most north-easterly large city ofMedia appears intwo late Avestan passages.4 On the other hand, the Avesta isfamiliar with many eastern Iranian place names. The first chapter ofthe Vendiddd, which treatsof the eighteen perfect lands created byAhura Mazda and the plagues which Ahriman inflicted upon each, has the following seven lands at the head of the list: Airyana Vaeja (thought to be Chorasmia), Sughdh (Sogdiana), Mouru (Margiana), BaxdhI (Balkh, Bactria), Nisaya (Nisa), Haroyu (Herat), Vaekarata (Gandhara).5 Broadly, these are held to be the lands ofthe Avestan people. Since they form anextensive area, it would bemore appropriate to say that these are the lands which the Avestan people knew orwere associated with intimately. The existence ofan eastern Iranian empire, parallel with orprior to that of the Medians, finds reflections in Greek sources, as W. B. Henning pointed out inhis lucid exposition ofthe geographical location of the Avestan people.6 According to thestory of the River Akes, which

THE KAYANIAN ERA
Herodotus quotes (in. 117), presumably from Hecataios, the Chorasmians were in ancient days masters of the valley of the Akes (today's Harl Rud and its continuation, Tejen)xand they exercised some measure of suzerainty over the Hyrcanians, the Parthians, the Sarangians of Sistan, and theThamanaeans2of Arachosia. " Both Marv and Herat were then occupied by the Khwarezmians whom Hecataios, in one of the few fragments of his work that has come down to us, places to the east of the Parthians".3 When the Chorasmian state4 was overthrown by Cyrus, the southern provinces were absorbed into the Persian empire, and the Chorasmians withdrew to the more northerly regions around the lower course of the Oxus, where they have been known to live ever since. Henning adduces some further support for the probable identification of the original home of the Avestan people, Airyana Vaeja, with Chorasmia by drawing attention to some similarities between the language of the Gathas and Khwarazmian.5 Naturally there arises the question that if indeed Cyrus ended the Chorasmian confederation how could one explain the fact that he does not appear in the Avesta as a villain or otherwise, and that all we hear about is the feud with the Turanians ? The present writer is of the opinion that this question has not found a truly satisfactory answer and is inclined to believe that the Zoroastrian tradition had evolved and taken shape prior to the rise of Cyrus, so that the advent of the Achaemenians was neither reflected in it nor did it affect that tradition. Addressing himself to the same question, Christensen, however, argues6 that actually the Chorasmian state toward the close of the 7th century B.C. had been weakened by internal dissent and parochial conflicts; that the early followers of the prophet were far more deeply involved in the dispute with their immediate neighbours than with a foreign power from the south; and that Cyrus's lenient religious policy, far from hurting the Zoroastrian believers, facilitated their proselytizing; therefore there was no cause to bear any grudge against him. It is argued, moreover, that once the Avestan people became the subjects of the Achaemenian empire, it was hardly expedient or in the interest of the missionary activities of the Zoroastrians to treat the Achaemenians with disrespect. I find the argument hardly convincing. If we accept Chorasmia as the homeland of the Avestan people, we

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
must still bear in mind that the majority of the geographical names in the more ancient parts of the Avesta, such as the River Vanhu Daiti, Lake Caecasta, Mount Hara, Lake Frazdanu, defy identification, and although a number ofthem areequated inlater Pahlavl literature with certain eastern and north-eastern locations, the accuracy ofsuch equations remains in doubt. Thus, although we may befairly certain of the geographical milieu ofthe Kayanian cycle ina general way, identifying the exact location or date of the people whose energy and talent gave birth to theearliest manifestations of the Iranian culture is more difficult to determine. The springtime of this culture, shrouded in remote antiquity andreflected only in theearliest myths andlegends of the Iranian people, may have passed in a relatively small region, whose toponymy survived as a tradition andwas later applied toother regions which the Iranians occupied in their migrations. In the same waythat the Sasanians tended to read western and southern localities into the eastern epic cycles, the traditional identification of some of the vague Avestan geographical references with known eastern nomenclature may owe something toParthian influence. The occurrence inthe recently found Elamite Persepolis tablets of some mythical and legendary names, which hadpreviously been known only from theeastern epic tradition, raises the possibility that in theearly centuries of the second millennium B.C., a pan-Iranian fund of myths and legends took shape before the eastern andwestern Iranians separated (see p. 388 above.)
THE HOUSE OF AFRASIYAB
In the national history the legends of the early Kayanians are inextricably interwoven with those ofthe house ofAfrasiyab, the Turanian hero whose feud with Iran dominates the Kayanian epic cycle. Afrasiyab (Av. Frarjrasyan; Mid.Pers. Frasyav, Frasyak, etc.;Tabari: Firasyat; Dinawari: Farasiyab) is one of the most prominent figures ofthe national epic. In Pahlavl andIslamic sources Afrasiyab's descent is traced to Tur: the Shdh-natna (248), giving the shortest genealogy, makes himthe great-grandson of Tur; theBundahishn(xxxv. 17) has six generations and Mas'udi {Muriij 11. 117) has seven generations between thetwo. Allagree on hisfather's name, Pashang. Although Afrasiyab isgenerally depicted asan arch-enemy of Iran andanagent of Ahriman, heis not seen asa monster incarnate, asis Dahak. In Yasht 19.93 heis even said to have possessed the royal farrah when hekilled the wicked Zainigav, a follower of the Lie. This foe, the Bundahishn (xxxiii. 9) tells us,hadseized theIranian throne andtheIranians sought

THE HOUSE OF AFRASIYAB
Afrasiyab's help against him. The Aogemadaeca (60-1) describes the iron-walled underground palace which Afrasiyab had built as one thousand times the height of a man and lighted bystars, sunand moon, all fashioned by the king himself. He is said to have enjoyed the best oflife inthis palace, which is called Hankana inthe Avesta (Pers. Hang).1 In post-Avestan times Afrasiyab takes hisplace in thehistorical tradition as the arch-enemy of Iran and of Iranian kings. He makes his appearance in the reign of Manuchihr, whom he defeats, and continues as a powerful enemy ofIranshahr during the reign of the next four kings. He seems to live forever. In fact, he represents almost the totality of Turanian opposition to Iran and the calamities which befallthe country during its long feud with Turan. Although anew phase of this struggle opens with Gushtasp and his Turanian adversary, Arjasp,its events belong toa new era, that of the Zoroastrian epic cycles. When Rustam was introduced into the national tradition, he became the main defender of Iran against the forays of the Turanian enemy. His victories against Afrasiyab, however, are generally inconclusive; and it remains for Gev and Kai Khusrau, as recorded inthe Shdh-ndma, to bring Afrasiyab to his end. In the Zamyad Yasht (56-64) we read that his attempt to capture the royal farrah ofthe Aryan race failed; and the Aban Yasht (41-3) informs us that his sacrifice toAradvi Sura for the same purpose was unsuccessful. On the contrary, Kai Khusrau's wish to slay Afrasiyab and avenge the murder of his father was granted.2 Kai Khusrau is helped to achieve this end by the yazad Haoma, who chains Afrasiyab and drags him to the shores of Lake Caecasta so that Kai Khusrau can take his life (Yasht 9. 17-18). In Yasna 11.7 we read that Haoma fettered Afrasiyab, who had taken refuge behind his iron walls. In the Shdhndma^3we find the yazad Haoma transformed into a holy man, Horn, who at the end assists Kai Khusrau tocapture the fugitive Afrasiyab from the waters ofKhanjast (a corruption of Caecasta). In the postAvestan traditions many of the originally north-eastern localities are transferred to the north-west; Afrasiyab takes shelter ina mountaincave near alake in Azarbaijan, apparently Lake Urmiya (Caecasta).4

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
In the Avesta, the gravest sin ofAfrasiyab isparticipation inthe slaying of Siyavush,1 which receives ample elaboration inlater literature. A wicked king, Afrasiyab is depicted as an agent of desolation and ruin. During his reign, therivers dryup andthetrees wither anda great many people perish. In the Bundahishn (xxxiii. 6) weread that he withheld rain from Iran; in contrast, according to theDenkard* Zab, after defeating Afrasiyab, restored prosperity toIran byincreasing the many streams andcultivated lands of Iran. In view of Afrasiyab's frequent association with drought and destruction, it may bespeculated that his legends absorbed some features of an adverse deity associated withthe inhibiting of rain. In this respect it is significant that according toa tradition preserved in Tabari,3 theFestival of the Waters, namely the day Aban of the month Aban, which constituted the third most important Iranian festival, commemorated the victory of Zab over Afrasiyab. A further confirmation of Afrasiyab's association with drought may be seen inhis slaying ofSiyavush, who shows aspects of a vegetation god (see below, p. 450-1).
Just as theIranian kings aresurrounded by able warriors, sotoo is Afrasiyab. A large number of Turanian heroes are mentioned in the Shdh-ndma^ mostly ascounterparts toIranian warriors in single combat, but also asgenerals of the Turanian army. Chief among these are close relatives of Afrasiyab. One, Aghrerath, achieves renown through his pro-Iranian sympathies. Theother, Garsevaz, becomes notorious for plotting the murder of Siyavush. Aghrerath actually figures among the righteous dead of the Zoroastrians, forhis fravasi is commemorated in the Farvardln Yasht (131), where he is placed between Zab and Manuchihr. His death by the order of Afrasiyab is avenged by Kai Khusrau.4 InPahlavl literature he isgiven as abrother ofAfrasiyab.5 He is an Immortal andis called Gopat-shah according to the Bundahishn (xxix. 6);6 but according to another passage (xxxv. 23-5)he was granted a sonwith this title. TheDddastdn 1Denig (xc. 5) does not identify Gopat-shah with Aghrerath but mentions the former among the Immortals as theruler of the land of "Gopat", which is described as co-terminous with Eran Vej. On the other hand, the Bundahishn (xxix. 6) places him in the land of Sakistan and the Menng1 Khrad7places himin Eran Vej. Gopat-shah probably referred originally to the ruler of Gava

(Sogdiana), but was later understood to bea minotaur1 (go, gav ''bull, cattle"), possibly under the influence ofBabylonian legends2 orsculptures representing fantastic figures.3 K. V.Trever saw a rendering of Gopat-shah in themotif of the human-headed bull found on some Sasanian seals.4
Garsevaz is mentioned in the Avesta (Yasht 19.77) as a foe of Iran who was killed by Kai Khusrau inrevenge for the murder of Siyavush. Although the Avesta does not refer to Garsevaz asa brother of Afrasiyab, the Bundahtshn (xxxv. 17) presents him as such and as a son of Pashang. Heis among thechief villians of the national history,and Firdausi (Shdh-ndmd, 13 94ft".) recounts at length both his intrigues against Siyavush and Kai Khusrau's pitiless revenge onhim.
The most distinguished warriors of Afrasiyab's clan, however, are Vesa, Afrasiyab's uncle, and Vesa's sons. InYasht 5.57-9 it issaid that the sons of Vesa sacrificed to Aradvi Sura and asked forvictory over Tus and forpower to destroy the Iranians. But it was Tus's desire to overwhelm the sons of Vesa and to devastate the Turanian lands, a desire granted by theyazads (Yasht 5.54-5). In the Shdh-ndmait is the house ofGodarz inparticular which is pitted against the houseof Vesa. Of Vesa's sons, Firdausi mentions Homan, who was killed by Be2an; Pilsam,5 killed by Rustam; and Plran, slain by Godarz. Of these, Piran is by far themost prominent. A valiant warrior and a skilful general, heshows noble traits also. It is Plran who helps Siyavush to take refuge with Afrasiyab, andit is he who saves thelife of Kai Khusrau and his mother after Siyavush's murder. Since Plran is caught between loyalty tohis king and sympathy for Siyavush and his son, his end isnot without tragic overtones. The mood iseloquently createdin Kai Khusrau's tearful oration over Piran's corpse after his death in battle.6 Firdausl's somewhat ambivalent treatment of him is already adumbrated in passages in the Yashts (see above) which refer to "the valiant sons ofthe house of Vesa".

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
THE FIRST KAYANIAN PERIOD
Kai Kavdd. According to allthesources, Kai Kavad is the founder of the Kayanian dynasty. The divergences among his genealogies1 in Pahlavi and Islamic sources, which range from making him a son of Zab tomaking him acommoner, are typical of founders of dynasties and only show that his connection with the earlier kings is forced. The Bundahishn (xxxv. 28)tells us that he was abandoned in a basketand found byZab, who adopted him ashis own son. This familiar incident implies theassumption of a noble lineage, which in Islamic sources is explicitly traced in various ways through Zab to Naudhar and Manuchihr. According to the Shdh-ndma, Kai Kavad was sought and found in the Alburz mountains, after it wasdecided that Tus and Gustahm, the surviving sons ofNaudhar, were not graced with the royal farrah and, thus, were not fit to rule. Tabari2 places Kai Kavad's residence atthe Irano-Turanian border, near the River Balkh.
The Avesta does not specify the family relationships among the early Kayanians, but inthe Pahlavi sources Kai Kavad isfollowed by his son Kai Apiveh, who fathers KaiArish, KaiByarsh (Kai Armin in the Shdh-ndma), Kai Pisinang or Kai Pisin (Kai Pashin in the Shdh-ndma\ cf. Afshm, the title of the kings of Ushrusana) andKaiUs (Kavus).3 Except for the last, all these are figures of little significance, as witnessed by the frequent corruption of their names in Islamic sources. The Shdh-ndmaeven omits Kai Apiveh and attributes his four sons directly to Kai Kavad.4 Whatever information the Parthian andearly Sasanian traditions may have retained about these figures is now lost.
Kavus. The figure of Kavus, on the other hand, is prominent, colourful andcomplex. Hisname is recorded in theAvesta in two forms: Usadhan and Usan.6 The account of his career is laden with mythical or fantastic incidents. Hisapparent counterpart in Indie mythology, Kavya Usanas, is a Vedic figure associated with Indra and twice called kavi (sage). It is said in the Rig-Veda6 that Usanas fashioned for Indra the thunderbolt that slew the serpent Vrtra, gave Agni (Fire) to Manu and established Agni as Manu's sacrificer.7 None of these features,

however, is met inthe Iranian tradition, although Kavus's ascent into the sky and his subsequent fall are echoed in asimilar myth attributed to Usanas' step-son.x The basis for the association of the two is chiefly confined to similarity in name; if we are ledto dissociate them, itis particularly because the Kayanians are by common consent products of Iranian development in the post-Indo-Iranian period, even though it happens that among the Kayanians only the two who seem to have a Vedic counterpart, namely Kavus andKaiKhusrau, receive in the Avesta a treatment similar tothat accorded tothe mythical Pishdadian figures. Kavi Usan possesses superhuman power (Yasht 14.39). ^ e sacrifices to Arodvl Sura, asking for victory over men and demons and for power to become thegreatest ruler of countries (Yasht 5.45-6). From the summary of the Sudgar Nask given in the Denkard (ix. 22.4-12) it is evident that the chief features ofKavus's legends asknown from later sources hadalready been recorded in the more recent parts of the Avesta. Inthe summary inthe Denkard are mentioned: his sovereignty over the seven climes; his domination ofthe demons; and his building of seven palaces - one of gold, two of silver, two of steel and two of crystal (abgenagin) - on top of the Alburz mountain, wherein all who entered were rejuvenated.2 Also included are his subduing of the demons of Mazandaran; his deception by the Demon Wrath; his ambitious challenge tothe yazads by his abortive attempt toascend the skies3 with the help ofdemons; his disgrace and fall; the withdrawal of the farrah from him; and his becoming mortal. His career as related in the Sudgar Nask is particularly reminiscent of that of Yima. According to the Bundahishn (xxxii. 11) aspring in Kavus' dwelling imparted eternal life, and the Denkard {ibid.) says that entering one ofhis palaces turned old men into 15-year-old youths. Of the two disastrous expeditions which areattributed to Kavus' reign in the Shdh-ndma^ the one to Mazandaran apparently reflectsthe memory of an unsuccessful campaign by the Iranians ina neighbouring country. The one to Hamavaran4must echo a similar memory; in late Sasanian times the location was taken for Himyar (Yemen), which was counted among the regions of Nemroz, tothe south. Whether the story

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
is a duplication ofthe Mazandaran campaign,1 the original form ofthe Mazandaran expedition,2 or whether it mirrors a lost campaign in another region, it serves, like the first, to underscore the rashness of Kavus and the fact that his actions were not always favoured or directed by God. This conclusion fits well with some ungodly aspects of his character, which led tothe removal ofthe farrah from him. The original location ofthe land that the Iranians called Mazandaran as well as the meaning of the name is somewhat problematic. It was applied originally to a hostile land ofdifferent cultic beliefs known to the Iranians in their legendary period. Its use as an appellation for Tabaristan is fairly late3 and probably dates from late Sasanian times.4 Early Islamic geographers donot mention it. That the name Mazandaran, which literally appears to mean "the gate or the valley of the giants, "i5 was somewhat ambiguous in terms of its location, is indicated by the fact that it was vaguely applied also to some western regions, including Syria and Yemen.6
D. Monchi-zadeh has argued7 that the Mazandaran which figures in the national epic refers in fact to an eastern region in the vicinity of India or within its borders. As his chief argument he points out that the name of the demons that Rustam defeats during his rescue mission to Mazandaran, namely Arzhang, Div-i Safld, Sanja, Pulad-i Ghandl (which the author amends to Nola and Ghandl) and Bid, are practically all taken from the names of Pandava kings of India or their dignitaries as mentioned intheMahdbhdrata.
If indeed the expeditions ofKavus to Mazandaran and Hamavaran belong to hisold legends, it only stands to reason that the scene of events should be sought in the east and that the identifications with Tabaristan and Himyar beconsidered late. And if they developed out of Rustam's legends, again the Saka origin of Rustam's saga favours the seeking ofboth Mazandaran and Hamavaran inthe regions of Afghanistan and north-west Pakistan, where theSaka tribes made repeated inroads. The assignment of an eastern region - probably in Afghan or North-West Frontier regions - to the original Mazainya country is

strengthened by W. B. Henning's proposal1 to identify Varana (which occurs in the list of countries in Vendldad and is often associated with Mazandaran) with Indian Varnu (Buner, north of Peshawar?). This view also fits well with T.Burrow's opinion that there were clashes and battles, both physical andreligious, between Iranians andthe future Indo-Aryans while some of the latter were still in Iran.2 One might assume that later, when Mazandaran was identified with Tabaristan, a number of events related to Dahak, Fredon, Manuchihr, Rustamand others were transferred to thelatter region. The story of Kai Kavus falling in love with Sudaba (Su'da in most Arabic sources), the daughter ofthe king ofYemen, has all the features of a folk romance and represents another case of transferring the scene of events from the east to the west.
Hildegard Lewy has argued3 that it isthe legends ofNabu-na'id, who was defeated by Cyrus, which arethebasis of the cycle of legends of Kavus. Nabu-na'id, according to Lewy, was particularly interested in the cult of the moon, thesun and other stellar deities. Under the influence ofthe Arameans, he chose as his chief deity Sin, the moon-god.He incurred the antagonism of the Babylonian priesthood, was considered insane by some of his opponents, worked outhisown apotheosis and secured forhimself a throne in the vault of the heavens, following the ancient Aramean custom of deifying their kings. Thus, alienating the opposing religious faction, he appeared to challenge the gods. The legends developing from his career were subsequently transferred to Cyrus' sonCambyses, whose name was pronounced by theArameans as Kabus or Qabus, and whose harsh treatment of the Babylonians exonerated the memory of Nabu-na'id. Later, when Balash I, the Parthian king, ordered thecollection of various religious andhistoric traditions, the legends of Nabu-na'id were transferred to eastern Iran. Through thesimilarity and coalescence of the name Kayus (Kavi Usa) in east-Iranian pseudo-historic lore, thelegends found a place in the Iranian tradition. These events may explain, according to Lewy, the fact that Kavus is equated in Islamic sources with Namrud and Bukhtanassar and is said to have ruled over Babylon. The transfer of his seat to Balkh would then bea late Iranizing measure.
Lewy's identification ofthe Kavus legend with the presumed legends

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
of Nabu-na'id through Cambyses is highly speculative. It ignores the context of east-Iranian tradition; moreover, it places unwarranted reliance on late and confused identifications, such as are found so frequently in Islamic sources whose authors tried, rather clumsily, to reconcile Iranian and Biblical traditions by an almost mechanical and hence unconvincing equation ofunrelated figures. Even if some aspect of the Kavus legends, such as his flight into the skies and his fall, should show Mesopotamian influences, there isno reason todoubt the authenticity of the basic legend of Kavus, which fits well into the context of the Iranian tradition.
Among the figures closely associated with the reign ofKavus in the religious tradition isOshnar (Av. Aosnara), whose fravasi is commemorated inthe Farvardin Yasht, 132, and ismentioned again in the Afrln i Zardusht, 2, as the epitome of wisdom.1 In the Pahlavi literature he is associated with Kavus. According to the Denkard v n (Intr. 36-7), Oshnar had a share ofthe farrah which left Yima,2 was anadvisor and chief vizier (framadhdr) toKavus, and administered the seven climes on his behalf. Even in hismother's womb Oshnar displayed miraculous power and struck Ahriman atbirth. He prevailed over the non-Aryans in discussion and imparted wise counsel toAryan countries. According to the Bundahishn^hc was killed bythe machinations of demons. There can be no doubt as to the priestly background ofthis early Zoroastrian figure; this should explain his practical disappearance from Islamic sources. Firdausl does not know of him.
Stydvush. In the Avesta, Siyavush (Av. Syavarsan; Mid. Pers. Syavakhs) ismentioned among the righteous heroes whose fravasis are celebrated.4 Histreacherous murder by Afrasiyab and the Turanian Garsevaz, andthesubsequent avenging of his blood by his son Kai Khusrau are also mentioned.6 But there is little doubt that the legends of his ordeal by fire at the court of his father, his flight to Turan, his building of the marvellous castle of Kang-dez, his marriage to Afrasiyab's daughter and the birth of his son must also have had their origin among the Avestan people and appear to have fed popular fancy from ancient times. Siyavush's renown among theIranian peoples of Central Asia can beinferred from Biruni's statement6 that the people of Chorasmia began their era with thebuilding of the city of Khwarazm 980 years before Alexander, and then made Siyavush's entrance into it the

beginning oftheir era, 92 years after the building ofKhwarazm. The
people of Sogdiana attributed the building of Bukhara, the Sogdian
capital, to Siyavush and believed that he was buried there. According to
Narshakhl in his "History of Bukhara",1 a 10th-century work,the
Zoroastrians (mughari) ofthe city used tovenerate his grave and every
year on New Year's day, before the sunrise, each believer would bring
a cock there and would kill it in memory of Siyavush. From the scattered accounts ofSiyavush it isapparent that he must have been the focus ofa mourning cult dating from pre-Zoroastrian times. Although the non-Zoroastrian context of references to him in Islamic sources, notably Firdausi, Dlnawari, and Tabari, has robbed his legend of its religious and cultic aspects, enough traces have been left to show its once ritualistic and religious import. Narshakhl, our chief source in this respect, relates (ibid., 24) that the people of Bukhara have wonderful songs (suruds) concerning the slaying ofSiyavush, and that the minstrels call these songs "the vengeance of Siyavush" (kin-i Siyavush).His subsequent comment (ibid., 33) leaves no doubt that these songs were infact mourning songs (nauha)which the minstrels called "the weeping ofthe ^r-*gi" (girlstan-i mughari).
Tha'alibl2and Firdausi3record atradition according to which cosmic disturbances took place when Siyavush was killed. Such legends could point only to belief in the sanctity of the slain hero. This inference finds support in Ibnal-Balkhi, who recounts4 that when the news of Siyavush's death reached Iran, his father Kai Kavus lamented deeply, saying, "It was not Afrasiyab who killed him; itwas I who killed the holy [rauhdm] Siyavush." It is to benoted that Siyavush's son, Kai Khusrau, too, has a certain holiness about him (seebelow), and IbnalBalkhi tells us5that according tothe Persians he was a prophet.
The fact that Siyavush was the centre ofa mourning cult inTransoxiana can be clearly seen from Kashghari's account: "Every year the Zoroastrians go tothe Di2 Ro'In, near Bukhara, where Siyavush was killed. They weep and offer a sacrifice there and pour the blood of the sacrificial animal on his grave; and this is their custom. "6 The existence in Sogdiana of mourning rites forthe dead, involving weeping and lamenting and self-mortification, has been asserted also byBiruni.7 Further evidence for Siyavush's connection with mourning rites canbe

found in other sources. For instance, Tha'alibI, 213, tells usofa sevendays' formal mourning by Rustam and other warriors when the newsof Siyavush's death reached the Iranian court, andTabari (1. 604) relates that according to Persian authorities the first manto wear black in mourning was Shadus, son of Godarz, who did sowhen Siyavush was killed byFirasiyat (Afrasiyab).1
What can bededuced from literary sources about the mourning rites concerning Siyavush seems to have found unexpected confirmation in archaeological excavations in Transoxiana. Diggings in the ruins of Panjikent, a Sogdian city sixty-eight kilometres east of Samarkand, have brought to light a series of extensive wall paintings, the focal theme of which is themourning of men and gods for a young prince (p. 1146, fig. 3).There can be little doubt that themourned figure is Siyavush.2 Similar scenes appear on a chest from Tok-Kala inthe extreme north ofthe Amu Darya delta,3 and ona vase found in Marv.4
From a number of references to themanner in which Siyavush was slain, it appears that, as would befit a martyred saint, he waskilled cruelly and in a way that could not but arouse deep anguish and overwhelming pity. After hewas wounded, his hands were tied and he was humiliated and driven tothe place where he had once excelled in physical prowess. Then hewas thrown down "like a lamb" and his throat was slit with a sword. Apparently also hewas mutilated and his handsome and radiant face was cutupand destroyed.5
Annual mourning rites for Siyavush seem to have been closely connected with those for thedead, whose fravasis were celebrated in the day(s) immediately preceding the New Year festival. It was believed in Sasanian times that onNew Year's day Siyavush was avenged by Kai Khusrau.6 The association of the New Year festival with both the cult of Siyavush and therenewal of plant life may be seen as a clue to the connection of Siyavush with themyths of the life cycle of vegetation. The cult of Siyavush seems to have assimilated thewidespread myths

of the sacrifice of a vegetation deity whose career symbolized the cycle of plant life and whosuffered death in order to strengthen life and promote rebirth. A trace of the ancient myths may beseen in the story that from Siyavush's blood there immediately grew an herb called "the Blood of Siyavush" (khun-i Stydvushdn)} even though Afrasiyab had ordered hisvictim's blood to be shed over a barren rock.2 It also appears that the mourning cult ofSiyavush, a legacy of Iranian pagan times, paved the way and provided themould for thedevelopment of the Shi'ite mourning rites in Iran which eventually led to the emergence of the ta\iya? Curiously, Firdausl's account of Siyavush's murder bears striking similarity to the passion of Imam Husain as depicted in Persian passion plays.4 In both cases, an innocent holy person ofexalted lineage, who has stood up for truth and righteousness, is killed bya treacherous and ruthless enemy. The passion of Siyavush bears too close a resemblance tothat ofImam Husain inritual, imagery and emotive underpinnings to be ignored in an explanation of the Islamic genre.
Kai Khusrau. Of all the Kayanian heroes, Kai Khusrau is the most highly praised inthe Avesta. Whereas the fravasis ofthe seven Kayanian princes who preceded him are invoked together inthe Farvardin Yasht (133-5), his fravasi is celebrated separately with a string of epithets indicative ofhis exalted image. He ispictured as possessing the strength of a well-formed body, the Ahura-given triumph, victorious superiority and just and inviolable command. He is warlike; he triumphs over enemies with a single stroke. In possession of the farrah, he enjoys a splendid reign. Long life, good fortune and all-healing power are his. He has foreknowledge of the future. Hisdescendants aregood, cleareyed, virtuous, eloquent, brilliant and wise. He delivers the unfortunate from distress. He is invoked to ward offthe evil deeds of sorcerers and sorceresses, kavis9 karpans and tyrants. He has inalienable right to paradise.
Kai Khusrau has a Vedic namesake, Susravas, "offair fame", with whose aid Indra crushes twenty enemy-chiefs and their 60,099 warriors by means of his fatal chariot wheels.5 The supposition of an IndoIranian origin for KaiKhusrau, however, remains a matter of con

jecture, since as inthe case ofKavus there islittle more than a sharing
of the name tounite the two.
In Yashts 15.30-3 and 19.73-7 reference is made to Kai Khusrau's chief triumph and one of the turning points of the national epic, namely, his slaying of Afrasiyab and Garsevaz in the vast White Forest after a long and arduous struggle. In a number of other Yashts the sceneof these events has been transferred tothe banks of Lake Caecasta. In the Pahlavl literature the legends of Kai Khusrau are elaborated and embroidered with various details of a religious nature. He is saidto have practised the Mazdayasnian religion1 and tohave destroyed, as a Mazdean iconoclast, an image-shrine2 on the bank of Lake Chechast. He is credited with the founding ofthe famous Zoroastrian fire-temple at Ches (Shlz): heestablished the Fire ofGushnasp which settled onhis horse's mane to light his path when hewas fighting the darkness on Mount Asnavand.3 He also appears as one of the Immortals (apparently already implied inYasht 23.7) with a future role toplay atthe timeof the Renovation: he will help the Sosyant in his resurrection of the dead and will join him in the final battle.4 The Islamic sources concentrate in particular on Kai Khusrau's release from Turan and his subsequent campaigns against Afrasiyab. Under his command a large number of Iranian heroes actively take the field against Afrasiyab andhis warriors, especially those from the house ofVesa. Whereas the Khwaddy-ndmag and its like drew their material about Kai Khusrau chiefly from the heroic tradition, priestly literature used mostly non-heroic material which emphasized his religious and eschatological aspects. The account of his disappearance into the snow, together with anumber of his chief warriors,5 may be an outcome of his attribute of immortality. Kai Khusrau's disappearance marks the end of an era and the close of the most brilliant heroic cycle ofthe epic tradition. Conspicuous among the Iranian warriors who fight under Kai Khusrau are Tus, ofthe house of Naudhar; Godarz, Gev and Be2an of the house ofKashvad; and ofcourse Rustam. Firdausi devotes a considerable part ofthe Shdh-ndma to the account oftheir exploits.

these paladins.
NOBLE WARRIORS UNDER THE KAYANIANS
The house ofRustam. Of all thenoble warriors, Rustam stands outas by far the greatest in the pages of the Shdh-ndma. His parents were Zal (also called Dastan), the vassal king of Sistan, and Rodaba (Rodhavadh in Tha'alibI, 73ff.), a daughter of Mihrab, thevassal king of Kabul and a descendant of Dahak. Exaggerated features usually encountered in the life-story of legendary heroes arealso met in hiscase. Hisnatural birth is impeded by his unusual size, and a "Caesarian" delivery is carried out following theinstructions of Simurgh, the miraculous bird whose magical feather heals his mother's wound. Rustam is suckled by ten nurses and, when weaned, eats food sufficient in amount for five men.1 Even as a child he confronts and kills his father's furious white elephant which had run loose. He captures the formidable Sipand Fortress and avenges the blood of his great-grandfather Nareman, while still a youth. He grows sostrong that his feet sink into the ground as he walks, andhe hasto implore God to diminish hisstrength. Soon his fame spreads, and when after Naudhar's death the question of choosing a newruler arises, he is sent by Zalto bring Kai Kavad from the Alburz mountain to be king. Before he sets out,he is given his grandfather Sam's mace, which had once belonged to Karshasp,2 and he tames an extraordinary stallion, Rakhsh, for his mount. Soon there begins the first of a long series of battles against Afrasiyab, which continue through theadventurous reigns of Kavus and Kai Khusrau. Awesome and invincible, Rustam becomes a legend in his owntime, and it is inlegendary terms that he isaddressed by Tahmina, the daughter of the king of Samangan, who enters his bed-chamber one night to express her love and admiration for him. Twice he comes close to experiencing a challenger equal or superior to himself: once when he is fighting against his own son Suhrab, whom he does not recognize, and again when heis almost overwhelmed bythe young prince Isfandiyar. Yet he emerges victorious from both battles, the first time bya combination of shrewdness andstrength, andthesecond by help from

Simurgh and skill in archery. Chivalrous and noble asheis, he is not
entirely above employing ruse or expedience. His career is studded with
a large number ofsingle combats against warriors, demons and whole
armies. His lifetime stretches from the reign of Manuchihr to that of Bahman. He receives a special charter from Kai Khusrau atthe end ofhis reign, but together with Godarz and Zal follows the king's advice and returns from the hopeless road that Kai Khusrau is following and therefore does notdisappear with theother warriors into thesnow.1 Zal and Rustam are the only warriors ofthe early Kayanian period who appear also under Gushtasp andhis successor. This fact is one indication, among others, that thelegends of these heroes originally formed a separate cycle, independent of the Kayanian, and that this cycle only later became intertwined with the Kayanian, resulting occasionally in some awkward juxtapositions. Rustam and Zal, however, are not mentioned inthe Avesta, and the origin of their legends has been one of the thorny problems of the national epic. Despite theprominence given to Rustam in theepic tradition, traces ofan initial hostility tohim among the priesthood can be deduced from thechallenge offered him byIsfandiyar, thegreat Zoroastrian champion, and from the revenge taken on him by Bahman, another protector ofthe faith, who wages war against Rustam's family and ravages his land. A tradition among some Islamic historians explicitly gives the cause of Isfandiyar's challenge as Rustam's disrespect for the good religion.2 To have him descended from Dahak on his mother's side is another sign of priestly antagonism. Neither he nor any ofthe members ofhis house figure inGushtasp's holy wars. This point further indicates the existence of a cycle of legends which developed outside Avestan circles and only later combined with Avestan epics. The absence of Rustam from the Avesta and acertain similarity between his legends and those ofKarshasp led Marquart to suggest that Rustam (Old Ir. *Raudhastakhma; Mid. Pers. Rodstakhm; cf. the name ofhis mother Rodaba)3 might have been another name of Karssaspa.4 Not only are their legends similar inmany respects, but both seem to have incurred thedispleasure of the priestly class through some religious offence.5 Marquart concluded that the legends of Rustam were a

reshaping of those of Karasaspa, with influences from thelife-story of Gondophares (Gundofarr < *Vinda-farna), a Saka king of Parthian lineage and a contemporary of Godarz II, who ruled in eastern Iran and northwestern India in the ist century A.D. Noldeke, however, maintained that there was nolink between thetwo,andthat thelegends of Zal and Rustam belonged originally tothe early Iranians of Drangiana (Zarang) andArachosia (Zabul).1 Marquart's view hasbeen followed in various ways bya number of scholars.2 Herzfeld among them developed Marquart's theory in greater detail andconnected the Saka king Gundofarr, and therefore Rustam, with theremains of the Kuh-i Khwaja in Sistan, which hehad excavated.3 He maintained that the time-span between the istcentury B.C. and the ist century A.D.,the middle part of which was occupied by Gundofarr, wasthe time when the Iranian saga took shape, and thus the Saka king along with many Parthian monarchs, such asMilad (Mithradates) andGodarz (Gotarzes), took their places in the epic cycles inthe guise ofIranian paladins.4 Christensen expressed serious doubt about theidentification of Rustam with either Karshasp or Gundofarr, pointing out that the similarity between Rustam and Karshasp was rather superficial and that our meagre knowledge ofwhat transpired ineastern Iran under the Saka kings did not justify identifying Rustam with Gundofarr.5 Hewas inclined to agree with Noldeke in regarding thecycle as belonging, not to the Avestan people, but tothe early Iranian inhabitants of Sistan.6 The difficulty about this theory is that itfails to explain the absence of Rustam from theAvesta. Iflegends concerning himbelonged to the ancient generations ofIranians in Arachosia, the stories would have been known to the authors ofthe younger Avesta, since Sistan was familiar tothem and the region figures prominently inthe Avesta. It might be argued that the Zoroastrian priests must have frowned upon the pagan legends ofthelands that their newfaith hadconquered; but surely they could have shown Rustam inanunfavourable light, like many other figures ofwhom they disapproved. This difficulty, however, could be obviated ifwe assume that Rustam was indeed, as his frequent

title Sagzi1 (the Saka) indicates, a Saka hero, whose legends were brought to Slstan by theinvading Saka tribes andwhich spread to the rest of Iran in Parthian times and eventually were combined with the Kayanian cycle as part ofthe national epic tradition.2 The origin of the Rustam legends istobesought, not inthe historical events of the time of Gundofarr, but inthe remoter past of the Saka people. Any similarity between Karshasp and Rustam can beexplained more plausibly bythe features common to heroic legends than by assuming substitution. It is to be noted, however, that the spread of Rustam's legends reflects marked linguistic influence from Persia. His name, Rotastakhm, is Middle Persian (no occurrence of the name has been found in Khotanese Saka, whose literature is chiefly Buddhist and has links rather with India than ancient Iran); even the form used in the Sogdian fragment on Rustam, namely rivstmy, appears to be a borrowing from Persian.3 If Rasdamaand Kasdakmain the Elamite tablets from Persepolis should prove torepresent the name ofthe Sistanian hero - a possibility raised by Gershevitch, who suggests their derivation from *rastutaxma-f then Noldeke's view will have found unexpected support.5
As a name, Rustam appears already in the Drakht i asiirig* which is based ona Parthian original.7 The first datable occurrence of Rustam's name is the Armenian Arostom inthe 5 th century A.D.8 The legendsof Rustam enjoyed great popularity during the 7th century, tojudge by the number of people who bore his name.9 But it is unlikely that the Khwaddy-ndmag would have given us as full an account of Rustam's legends as theone we find in FirdausI, whose prose source no doubt drew onSistanian legends, and whose poetic imagination was attracted to them. (One of the four scholars who helped the author ofthe prose Shah-nama was Yazdandad of Slstan.10) The account ofRustam in early Arabic sources is more succinct,11 and even Tha'alibI, whose version is fairly exhaustive and conforms to Firdausi's in outline, makes no mention of the episodes relating to Suhrab, Manila and Be2an, or

Rustam's " Seven Stations ". On the other hand, in the story ofSimurgh, Tha'alibi, 367-8, has details which are lacking in theShdh-ndnm. The stories of Rustam's birth and youth must be later elaborations, since original poems orstories ofcelebration and adventure generally do not concern themselves with such details.1 The 8th-century Sogdian fragment concerning Rustam found inthe Turfan excavations attests tothe wide popularity of Rustam's legends in Transoxiana. It describes a battle between Rustam and the demons, inwhich the latter, deceived by a stratagem devised by the warrior, suffer losses. The name of Rakhsh, Rustam's celebrated steed, isalso mentioned in the fragment.2 A further indication of the popularity of the legends of Rustam in Central Asia may be seen in the7th-century wall-paintings of Panjikent, some of which (Room 41, Sector VI) have been identified as illustrations of Rustam's exploits in his Seven Stations (pis 145-8).3
The Houseof Godar^.Next to the house ofRustam, the house of Gddarz is the most prominent among the warrior nobles in the national epic. In theShdh-ndmaGodarz's ancestry is traced to Kava the Smith. His father Kashvad (Jashvad in Tabari 1. 608, 617, and therefore probably to beread Gashvad),4 who is made a son ofKava, appears first during the reign of Fredon, and continues to be a warrior even under Kai Kavus. Tabari,5 however, makes Kashvad a descendant of Naudhar through twelve generations. Kashvad is the general who leads the Iranian army back to Amul after Naudhar's defeat and capture by Afrasiyab.6 Kashvad is said to have two brothers. One is Karen,the general of Fredon's army, who notonly takes part in Manuchihr's campaigns against Salm and Tur, but leads Naudhar's army in his battle against Afrasiyab. The other is Qubad (Kavad), who commands the right wing of Naudhar's army in this battle and is killed by the Turanian warrior Barman.
Godarz, a veteran ofmany wars, isdepicted inthe epic tradition asa staunch warrior and a wise and respected statesman. Heappears first under Kai Kavus, who gives him Isfahan asa domain, and heremains active to the end of Kai Khusrau's reign.

orders a major confrontation with Afrasiyab. Godarz leads the fateful expedition, during which many Turanian and Iranian warriors come to grief. A series of single combats called the battle of "Eleven Aspects" (Yd^dah Rukti), in which theIranian warriors distinguish themselves, culminates in a combat between Godarz andPiran - a combat which ends the life of the formidable Turanian general and prepares the way for the final defeat of Afrasiyab.
Among Godarz's 78 warrior sons (70 ofwhom fall inthe wars against Afrasiyab) Gev stands out prominently; he isone ofthe foremost heroes of the national epic. He isthe warrior who, following aprophetic dream of Godarz, is sent byKavus to Turan to find Kai Khusrau and bring him to Iran. Gev is equally prominent in thesubsequent wars against Afrasiyab which lead to the latter's destruction. Gev's son BeSan, also an outstanding warrior, is the hero of a wellknown romance in the Shdh-ndma. He is led astray into Turanian lands, where Afrasiyab's daughter ManeSa falls in love with him, but he is captured byherfather and imprisoned in a pit. Eventually heis freed and brought back to Iran byhis maternal grandfather Rustam through Maneza's unfailing love and loyalty.1 The author of theFdrs-ndma2 attributes to Gev a son, Bukht Narse, thegeneral of thearmy under Luhrasp.
The Avesta makes no mention ofthe house ofGodarz, but the names of Godarz and Be2an (Vijan) coincide with the names of two Parthian kings in Islamic sources.3 Godarz of course appears also oncoins, and the inscription of Godarz I in Bisitun includes a significant reference to thename of Gev,4 although notas Godarz's son, butas his father, Gotarzes Geopothros.5
Some of the powerful noble houses of Iran, most of which, by all accounts, flourished under both Parthian and Sasanian rule, seem to have influenced the development ofIranian epic tradition to the extent of having their ancestors appear as heroes of legendary times. The incorporation of such legends must have happened, at least in rudi

mentary form, during the Parthian period. Among the Parthian princes who are present inthe national epic inthe guise ofwarrior-heroes are Farhad (Phraates) and Milad (a name which, asMarquart ingeniously
discovered,1 is aform of Mihrdad =Mithradates). Three other warriors'
names, Bahram, BeSan and Shapur (seen also as an eponym in Sabirghan2
and Shavuran3), also belong tothis category. Although these namesdo not appear in Western sources forParthian kings, they are present as
those ofArsacid rulers inthe lists recorded by Islamic historians,4 and presumably they belonged tomembers ofsome eastern branches ofthe dynasty. The legends ofthe house ofGodarz must have been included inthe national saga earlier than those ofthe Sistanian heroes, asChristensen
argued.5 Despite the preeminence of Rustam during Kavus's reign, it is Godarz and his sons who are most effective inbringing Afrasiyab to his final defeat and destruction. It isGev who, asnoted above, is sent to bring Kai Khusrau from Turan toIran; inthe fateful battle against Afrasiyab, it is Godarz to whom Kai Khusrau entrusts theKaviyan banner, borne until then only by princes of the royal house; and it is Gev who eventually delivers Afrasiyab into the hands ofKai Khusrau. It may be objected that the occurrence ofParthian royal names inthe legends could bedue to the adoption of such names bythe Parthian kings from epic tradition. Noldeke answered this objection long ago.
If that were the case, he pointed out,6 then the Parthian kings would no doubt have chosen only the names ofkings, instead ofchoosing those of their vassals. The legends of such heroes, then, presumably originated in the stories composed and sung by the minstrels of the Parthian princes, who through their patronage aided their wide circulation. In the course of time, as some ofthe legends were forgotten and others were blurred through a weakening oforal transmission, the Kayanian and Parthian cycles were mingled in thenarration of theeast-Iranian bardsand
minstrels7 and eventually became part ofthe national history.
Godarz then is probably Godarz I (c. 91-81 B.C.), even though it is Godares II (A.D. 43-51 ?), a champion of north-eastern Iranian lands,
who had particular links with Hyrcania,8 to which hewithdrew more than once, according toclassical sources.

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
We cannot attach too much importance to the genealogy ofGddarz as it appears in the national epic, since such genealogies tend to become confused, as time passes, with attention focusing on the dramatic elements of the stories. Thus, for example, Sasan instead of Papak is made the father of Ardashir in theKdrndmag and theShdh-ndmay and in Daniel (5. 31; 6.1-29; 9.1; 11.1) Cyrus ismade a successor of Darius "the Mede", son ofXerxes (Ahashwerosh).1 Another example of such confusion is provided bythe replacement of Zariadres byGushtasp in their famous love story (see below, p. 468). It is probable that Gev originally appeared inthe epic as Godarz's father. His leadership rather than Godarz's inbringing back Kai Khusrau from Turan may be a trace of his seniority. He lives ontothe end ofKai Khusrau's time and with Rustam, Tus and Godarz isamong the few who receive a charter (^ahd) of special privileges from Kai Khusrau upon his retirement from the throne.2 It is also to be noted that only Gev, from his house, figures among theZoroastrian Immortals.3 It is possible, on theother hand, that Gev, sonof Godarz, was named after hisgrandfather and their legends became mixed.4
The House of Naudhar. Of this princely house which is prominent in the Avesta and counts Vishtaspa and his wife Hutaosa among its members (Yasht 5.98), only one figure stands out in the national epic, namely Tus. He is mentioned inthe Avesta several times and therefore his legends are ofconsiderable antiquity. Inthe Aban Yasht, 5 3 and 5 5, he offers worship toAradvi Sura and asks for victory over his enemies, the descendants of Vaesaka (Vesa, father of Piran andthe uncle of Afrasiyab). In the priestly Pahlavi literature he is oneof the thirty Immortals who help the Sosyant at theendof time to renovate the world.5 In theShdh-ndma, although he is depicted as a prince and a warrior ofthe highest rank, traces ofa less sympathetic treatment than that accorded to the houses of Rustam and Godarz are evident.
Upon the death oftheir father Naudhar, Tus and his brother Gustahm (Av. Vistaura ?) are considered by the other nobles tolack the farrah and therefore to benot wholly suitable forthe throne. Thus Zab is chosen king instead. Under Kavus, Tus is involved in a number of dramatic

events. When Kai Khusrau is brought from Turan, Tus briefly challenges his right to thethrone andfalls out with Godarz and Gev. He acquiesces in Kai Khusrau's accession only after he himself fails where Kai Khusrau succeeds, namely in the capture of the Bahman Fortress, a test of worthiness which Kavus hadsetfor theclaimants to the throne.1
After hisaccession, Kai Khusrau prepares a great expedition against Turan, with Tus asitsleader. Haughty and over-confident, Tus ignores Kai Khusrau's specific instructions to avoid Furud, the king's halfbrother, on theway andin the resulting combat Furud is killed. This deeply grieves KaiKhusrau. Later, when thenews reaches himthat a surprise attack by Piran has inflicted heavy losses on theIranian army, he gives vent to his anger in a scathing message and deposes Tus, installing Fariburz, his own uncle, as the leader of the expedition. At times Tus is shown toexhibit some ofthe arrogance and thoughtlessness of Kavus. Hisrelations with thehouses of Godarz andRustam, which are joined by marriage andarevery well disposed toward each other, are sometimes less than cordial.2 Noldeke pointed out3 that the dispute between TusandGodarz may reflect a rivalry between two powerful Parthian noble houses. It is notinconceivable that at some point Tiis's legends were "edited" by bards whowere sympathetic to his rivals. Yet heremains a respected figure in thenational epic and is among the noble warriors who receive a special charter from KaiKhusrau when he prepares to relinquish his kingship. He is among thewarriorswho disappear in thesnow as they follow Kai Khusrau into the wilderness.
ASPECTS OF THE KAYANIAN EPIC CYCLE
The Kayanian epic cycle embodies the literature of the most notable heroic age in the Iranian tradition. This literature must have originated in poetry celebrating theexploits andadventures of Kayanian princes and sung by theminstrels attached to their courts. Although we have no historical or corroborative evidence for the events of the period and cannot be sure of the date or exact homeland of the Kayanians, there is noreason to doubt the authenticity of the core of their deeds as related inthe Avesta, and much later, inthe Shdh-ndma. The comparative study of heroic literature4 affords us an insight into themillieu, nature and transmission of their legends.

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
The Kayanian epic cycle, asdepicted inthe Yashts, portrays a society in which a class ofprinces and their warrior-nobles are dominant, and kingship is firmly established and institutionalized. The tribal ties and loyalties areweakened enough to allow allegiance to kings, who rise above parochial bonds andwho represent Eran as a community of peoples sharing a common ideology and threatened by a common danger, namely periodic attacks from the north. Moreover, the deities worshipped by the society have long ceased tobe tribal orlocal, but are highly anthropomorphic gods, universally recognized.1 Worship of the souls of the dead has also ceased to be merely a family or clan cult; instead, thefravasis have come to represent a universalized body of powerful spirits who can beappealed to byall. We do notknow what physical or economic challenges or human circumstances gave rise to the Kayanian heroic age. H. M. Chadwick has advanced thetheory that heroic periods aregenerally periods of national movement and unrest touched offamong barbaric and " adolescent" peoples by contact with more civilized nations, and often preceded by themercenary service of theprimitive under the more advanced.2 Such conditions do not seem tobe implausible inthe case of the ancestors of the Avestan nation. We may speculate that theforefathers of the Avestan people received an early stimulus when they came into contact with theprior inhabitants of north-eastern Iran, whose higher culture is reflected in the archaeological finds of the region. Before thepenetration and eventual conquest of the area by the invaders, we may assume, there was a turbulent period dominated by warrior princes and nobles, whose predatory and defensive measures, and whose interaction with neighbouring tribes, aremirrored in the Kayanian cycle. It iswholly possible, ofcourse, that the original heroic poems which celebrated the deeds ofthe Kayanians represented a more primitive stage of social and political development than the one depicted in theYashts andthat they belonged to a more tribal than national community; even so there is no doubt that the Kayanian saga is expressive of a heroic period which must have led to a more cohesive and united community with national aspirations.
Already in the Avesta, poetic exaggeration endows the Kayanian princes with greater wealth andpower than they arelikely to have enjoyed. The later versions of their stories, exemplified by the

KAYANIAN EPIC CYCLE
Shdh-ndma, enhance this trend and give them allthe pomp and circumstance that the splendour of the Sasanian court could evoke in the minds of their authors. We may safely surmise that humbler conditions actually prevailed1 and that cattle-raids, plunder and pillage were themain economic causes of strife.2 The blood-feuds only aggravated a tense situation. This view receives support from Zoroaster's own words,for in his Gathas hebitterly complains of the inroads of the bloodthirsty wicked men who give nopeace to herdsmen and their cattle and keep the good man in peril.3
In the Kayanian epic cycle the features common to heroic literature in general may be observed. The heroes are distinguished primarilyby their prowess at arms and their physical strength. Their main concernis fame and glory, which are acquired chiefly on the battlefield through courage and skill. In the Khwaddy-ndmag, which in this respect tends to reflect archaic conditions, most of the heroic exploits of the Kayanian period are performed bywarrior nobles, and more often than not the king is depicted as thecommander-in-chief and an able general who inspires andleads his army. In the Yashts, however, the Kayanians appear in a more primitive state of society than in the Khwaddy-ndmag and are personally active against their enemies, exhibiting more warlike qualities than later kings. This isalso true ofsome ofthe earlier kings, notably Fredon and Manuchihr, who overcome their adversaries personally.
The Kayanian epic cycle, having arisen originally among warrior princes for purposes of celebration and entertainment, exhibits the expected aristocratic traits. The stories aregenerally of war and adventure. The scenes of the stories are mostly battlefields, royal courts, banquet halls, hunting grounds, roads, rivers, mountains and forests. The prevalent form of warfare is single combat, in which theheroes prove their worth. The combat is generally preceded by boasting on the part of each warrior. Pride in one's ancestry, past achievementsand superiority over one's opponents, together with denigration and ridicule of one's adversary, are the common subjects of such conceits.
The weapons used vary from theprimitive mace (gur^) andlance (nai^a), tothe lasso (kamand), bow and arrow (tir ukamdri), sword (tigby shamshir)) dagger {khanjar\ javelin (khisht) and dart {gubiri). Defensive

weapons consist of the shield (sipar), coat of mail (%irih) andhorse armour (bargustuvdri)^ but obviously some ofthese weapons, particularly those ofmetal, reflect advances achieved inlater periods. Generally the warriors fight, orbegin to fight, onhorseback, unless the terrain or situation requires combat onfoot. Before an army sets out forbattle, asa rule the king opens up his treasures and distributes weapons andammunition. He often tries to arouse his men before battle. Appeal is made to their pride, their sense of glory andtheir manliness. The need of the country and the danger ofdefeat tothe land and thecrown arebrought home to thesoldiers in stirring words. Challenges to combat, offered or received, and the ensuing battles are described atlength. Battles engaging the whole body of an army usually take place generally in desperation or following inconclusive single combats, orinpunitive forays, orelse as a response toa general attack. Banquet scenes in celebration of victory abound. Drinking boutsare still more common and require little excuse. Victory is often followed by distribution of booty, with the king or general rewarding his warriors.
Unlike the Indian and Teutonic heroic literatures, which often accord
a more prominent place to women than to men,1 theKayanian epic cycle seems to show less concern for women than even the Iliad. In the Shdh-ndma^ several women areconspicuous in thecourse of the Kayanian history: the wicked Suddbay KaiKavus's spouse, whose accusation of the innocent prince Siyavush eventually leads to his tragic death; Farangis, the unfortunate wife of Siyavush and daughter of Afrasiyab, who barely escapes death byorder ofher father and has to bring up her son Kai Khusrau inconcealment; Rodaba, the beloved of Zal and the heroine ofthe most moving love story inthe Shdh-ndmay who gives birth to Rustam; Sindukht, the resourceful mother of Rodaba; the valiant Gurdafrld, the daughter of the Iranian general Ga^daham, who skilfully if briefly battles with the young Suhrab, and outwits the admiring warrior by her crafty escape; ManeSa, adaughter of Afrasiyab, and a paragon oflove and loyalty; and finally Humay, the successor of Bahman. Three of these women, however, belong, not to the Kayanian, but tothe Rustam cycle; and Mane2a may have, like her lover Be2an,a Parthian provenance (see below p. 459). The Avesta mentions practically none ofthese women. On the other hand it istobe noted that Aradvi Sura, thefemale yazad of the waters hasa prominent place in the

Yashts, andAsithe yazad of reward, blessing andfortune, who is depicted inoneYasht (13. 107) asa noble, invincible maiden, isone of
the major Iranian deities venerated also inthe Gathas.1 In theFarvardin Yasht thefravasis ofa number ofwomen areinvoked alongside those of men (see p. 414above). The intervention of supernatural powers is common in thecycle, as it isintheheroic stories ofother nations. The heroes sacrifice to the deities and thefravasis andaskforpower and victory. The farrah is an ever-present agent of divine aid and grace. Dragons andmonstersare recurrent adversaries. Dreams aregenerally taken as forecasts of future events and their interpretation is diligently sought. The involvement of the deities and other supernatural powers, although itself of a mythical nature, need notaffect ourview that such stories generally have a basis in reality. Such interventions arecommon to other heroic
literatures2 and derive partly from the beliefs of the period and partly from theimagination of the narrators of the stories.
THE SECOND KAYANIAN PERIOD
This phase begins with Luhrasp; with new characters anda newset of circumstances, it has a complexion wholly different from that of the previous phase, even though the Khwaday-ndmag made Luhrasp a direct successor of Kai Khusrau.
Luhrasp (Av. Aurvat.aspa). The gap between KaiKhusrau's era and that ofthe later Kayanian kings isclearly indicated bythegenealogy of Luhrasp. Luhrasp's name does not appear in the Gathas, but he is mentioned inthe Aban Yasht, 105, asthe father ofVistaspa. Aurvat.aspa ("having swift horses ") also occurs inthe Avesta asanepithet ofHvar, the sun yazad, and ofApam Napjit, the yazad ofthe waters and an ahura. The name appears on Kushan coins, in theform of Arooaspo, as a
designation ofthe sun-god.3 All this has ledanumber ofscholars to see
a sun deity at Luhrasp's origin.4The fact that heis mentioned neither in theFarvardin Yasht norintheZamyad Yasht, where thepossessors of the farrah areenumerated, may mean that he was not originally favoured by the composers of the Yashts. Thereference in Islamic

sources to his retiring to Nau Bihar (aBuddhist temple) in Balkh may indicate his resistance tothe Zoroastrian faith. Itmay even be suspected that his retirement from the throne was forced. Itmay also be speculated that later, however, the sanctity ofhis son restored him tothe favour of the Zoroastrian priesthood as a righteous oratleast an innocuous king. The Pahlavi and Islamic sources give Luhrasp's genealogy somewhat varying forms, butno doubt the version in the Bundahishn,1 to which those given by Tabarl i. 645, 813, and Hamza, 36, basically conform, is that which must have appeared inthe Khwaday-ndmag. According tothis lineage Luhrasp is a distant cousin ofKai Khusrau, namely son of Kai Ojl (or Ozl or Ogi), son of Kai Manush, son of Kai Pisin, son of Kai Aplveh, sonof Kai Kavad.2 In later sources we find him a just and righteous king closely associated with Balkh. He is said to have founded this city, and Biruni mentions Balkhl ("of Balkh") as his title.3 According to Islamic sources he sends his general Bukhtnassar (Nebukadnesser) to Jerusalem, which hedestroys and where hemakes prisoners of the Jews.4 The fact that Nebukadnesser is given a Persian name, Bukhtarshah, in a number of sources,5 suggests that this attribution may derive from Sasanian times through anacquaintance with Babylonian and Jewish traditions rather than from the Islamic period.
Gushtdsp (Av. Vistaspa; Mid. Pers. Vishtasp) is mentioned four times in the Gathas by the prophet, who calls himhis follower andally (Yasna 46.14). He is also mentioned frequently in theYashts. From Yasht 5.98 it can be inferred that, like hiswife Hutaosa, he is of the house of Naotara (Pers. Naudhar). Although Yasht 13.102 seems to imply otherwise, his being a Naotarian isconfirmed by the summaryof the Varshtmdnsar Nask inthe Denkard ix. 33.5. He sacrifices tothe river yazad Aravdi Sura in front of Lake Frazdanu (Yasht 5.108-9), asking for victory over his enemies Tathryavant, Pasana and Arajat.aspa (Arjasp). He asks a similar favour from Drvaspa, the yazad who protects cattle (Yasht 9.29-31). InYasht 13.99-100, he iscalled the valiant promoter of truth through the power ofhis mighty mace, and the arm, support and saviour ofthe religion. He possesses the farrah and defeats his enemies, liberating the Ahuric religion (Yasht 19.84-7). Two late texts, namely

the Afrin i Zardusht and the Vishtasp Yasht (Yashts 23 and 24), record Zoroaster's blessings on the king and the prophet's advice and admonitions to him. The tenth nask of the Avesta, which, according to the Denkard vin. 10,wascalled the Vishtasp Sdst ("Instructions to Vishtasp"), is, however, lost. The Farvardin Yasht, 96-129, has preserved the names of the members of the family of the prophet and of Vistaspa.
The Pahlavi literature adds many details about the conversion of Vishtasp and hisreligious wars. The Holy Immortals and theFire of Ohrmazd urge himto accept andpromote thefaith;1 he founds the two well-known fires ofFarnbagh and Burzen Mihr. During the battle with his arch-foe Arjasp, the king ofthe Chionites (Mid. Pers. Hyon), the Komis mountain breaks up in order to help save the Iranian army (Denkard ix. 35-6). His two sons, Spandyad and Pishotan, embark on holy wars in the west and east.
The Khwaddy-ndmag) however, presented Gushtasp ina different light. There he appeared as an ambitious prince who fell in love withand married Katayun,2 daughter of the emperor of Rum. Eventually, his father having retired, Gushtasp succeeds to the throne. After Gushtasp has ruled for 30 years, Zoroaster, a native ofAzarbaijan, appears at his court and converts him tohis religion. The king's conversion leads to a series ofwars with Arjasp, in which the Iranian and Turanian heroes Isfandiyar and Bastur in particular - excel and which end with the victory of Gushtasp's army. Gushtasp's selfishness and his unsavoury character nowreveal themselves: first he imprisons his valiant son Isfandiyar onunfounded charges and then in niggardly fashion denies him thecrown which he hadpromised himfor defeating Arjasp; he asks him instead tobring Rustam infetters tothe court, callously sending his son into the jaws of death.
Of relevance to the study of Gushtasp's origin andcharacter is a story quoted byAthenaeus3 from Chares of Mytilene, who was in the service of Alexander the Great. Briefly stated, the story relates that Hystaspes ruled in Media andthelands below it, while his younger brother Zariadres reigned in thelands above theCaspian gates up to the Tanais. Beyond theTanais, Omartes is king. His daughter Odatis is said to be themost beautiful maiden in Asia. Zariadres andOdatis

fall in love with eath other through visionary dreams, but Omartes refuses to give his daughter in marriage to a stranger. Ata wedding banquet which Omartes holds for his daughter, he asks Odatis to offer a cup of wine to the man of her choice. Zariadres, forewarned, has crossed the Tanais inhaste and arrives inScythian attire just intime to receive the cup and carry off the princess. The two brothers in the story are said to be offspring of Aphrodite and Adonis; this descenthas prompted speculation among scholars concerning the Iranian equivalents ofthese Greek deities, and also the interpretation ofthe storyon a mythological plane.1 Mary Boyce has drawn attention tothe possible cultic aspects of the story, since, according to Chares, scenes from it adorned the walls oftemples, palaces and even private residences.
It is generally assumed that the Greek story inspired the accountof the romance between Gushtasp and Katayun related by Firdausi2and Tha'alibi.3In this version, the young Gushtasp leaves his father's court for Rum, where incognito he attends a feast given bythe emperor to permit his daughter tochoose her future husband. She catches sight of Gushtasp, whom she has seen inher dreams, and places her diadem on his head, thus indicating her choice. Christensen,4 following Marquart,5 saw inthe story ofZariadres a reflection ofeastern legends inthe west, but Mary Boyce argues6 that it would be more reasonable to take the legend asa western one, which later was appended in a modified and rather crude form to the life story of the young Gushtasp. Accordingto her, in the eastern version Gushtasp replaces Zariadres, whose name coalesces in a later period with Zarer, Gushtasp's younger brother.
It is hardly possible to suppose that the Hystaspes and Zariadresof Chares and the Gushtasp and Zarer ofeastern legends are identical by mere coincidence. The solution which suggests itself is that the legend had itsorigin in the earlier, pre-Zoroastrian Iranian myths sharedby eastern and western Iranians alike. This would require usto postulate that inGushtasp ofthe national history we are faced with two distinct persons merged into one, namely a mythological figure, son of Aurvat. aspa (Luhrasp), and aKayanian prince, the protector of Zoroaster. What strengthens this theory is that, as we noted earlier (above, p. 467), there are in the account of Gushtasp clear indications of two different charac

ters, one, a saintly king and the other, a rather self-seeking ruler. It is hard to believe that atradition which developed among the Zoroastrians could portray the first protector ofthe faith as a character with so many unsavoury traits asthe Gushtasp of the secular legends. The problem can easily be resolved ifwe see in Gushtasp aunion of two persons, one belonging to a pre-Zoroastrian fund of mythical figures, where moral concerns did not play a significant role, and the other belonging to the religious history ofeastern Iran. Although the two eventually merged, probably through asimilarity ofnames, when the national legends were systematized and put in order, thedifferences in character and deeds were toa large extent preserved through oral tradition.
Isfandiydr. Of Gushtasp's sons, two areparticularly prominent.One is Pishotan (Av. Paso.tanu), who is called deathless (amahrka) in the Vishtasp Yasht, 4,and who is one ofthe Zoroastrian Immortals living in Kang-Dez and a future helper ofthe Sosyant. The other is Isfandiyar (Av. Spsnto.data),1 who is mentioned inthe Farvardin Yasht, 103, and Vishtasp Yasht, 25. He ispraised inthe Pahlavi books as the champion and a staunch defender of the good religion,2 but he looms much larger in the national epic onaccount of his exploits, in particular his famous contest with Rustam, and his tragic death. The lengthy treatment of him byFirdausl and Tha'alibi must ultimately bebased on a Middle Persian epic. The intermediate source may be either the Bunkisb, said byMas'udl3 to contain legends about him, or the Saklsardn (" the Chiefs of the Sakas " ?), which, according to Mas'udi'4 related, among others, the exploits ofRustam and Isfandiyar; oreven the Kitdb Rustam wa Isfandiydr^ translated byJabala ibn Salim and mentioned byIbn alNadim (305) among works of biography and fiction. Some legends about Isfandiyar, notably his capture ofRo'ln Dez ("Brazen Fortress") and a number of his exploits at the "Seven Stations" (Haft Khwdn)^ may possibly have served as models for similar exploits attributed to Rustam.5 Both are in fact based on stereotyped elements and show a typical pattern used in such heroic stories (e.g. the slaying ofa dragon and the killing of a sorceress disguised asanenchantress; "seven" as the number of adventures involved, etc.). M. Bahar has drawn an

interesting parallel between theepic ofRustam andIsfandiyar and that of Achilles andHector, comparing Gushtasp with Agamemnonand suggesting that the Iranian legend was an adaptation of the Homeric model during theperiod of cultural interaction among theGreeks and eastern Iranians after Alexander's conquest.1 Although the fact that Rustam, unlike Hector, is not killed (even though almost defeated) by his antagonist remains a weakness in this comparison, Greek influence in some aspects of the legend cannot perhaps beentirely ruled out.
An intriguing report by Ctesias (Pers., 2. 10) calls the usurper who seized the throne after Cambyses' death Sphendadates (Isfandiyar). This Median name, which corresponds to theAvestan form, raises the question whether the legends of Isfandiyar did not owesomething to myths orevents ofwestern Iran. Marquart suggested an ancient cult of Spanto.data in theWest,2 partly onthebasis ofthe identification ofthe Khazar godT'angri Khan with a figure which according to a late source "the Persians call Aspandiat".3But the evidence is too meagre to beconclusive.4
Legends about Isfandiyar must have gained in popularity and attracted extraneous material in thecompositions ofParthian bards.The Arsacids traced their descent tohim, asdidthe Sasanians. Tabari5 calls him al-Fahlaviy"the Parthian".
THE THIRD KAYANIAN PERIOD
In theIslamic sources theaccount of this phase presents a confused mixture of elements from eastern andwestern sources. Memories of the events which took place under the Achaemenians arereflected in these accounts, mostly filtered through Greek, Babylonian andJudaic materials andoften in distorted form.6 The redaction ofthis sectionof the national history is comparatively late, some ofit even post-Sasanian. Bahman, although not mentioned in the Avesta, is a popular figure in the Pahlavi literature. In a passage in theZand I Vahman Yasht1 Ohrmazd shows Zoroaster a vision ofthe favoured future kings in the form of a tree. Gushtasp and Bahman arelikened to gold and silver

branches, respectively, whereas the other kings, namely the Parthian Balash, Ardashlr Papagan, Bahram Gor,and Khusrau I, are represented by inferior metals. The Denkardvm. 7.5 refers to"Bahman the Just" and "themost efficient figure in theMazdayasnian community ". Gardizi calls him the best of all Persian kings.1 Most probably he represents a local ruler of the Zoroastrian community after Gushtasp. Later, however, it appears that elements from the surviving memory ofAchaemenian kings, Cyrus in particular, were attached to legends about Bahman. He issaid tohave built a number ofcities inBabylonia and Mesan,2 having freed the Jews from captivity in Babylon, having restored the Temple in Jerusalem,3 and having adopted Judaism fora while.4 According to Hamza, 38, the Israelites identified Bahman with Cyrus in their histories. Bahman's identification with Artaxerxes I Longimanus (464-424 B.C.) is based, as Noldeke points out,5 on a pseudo-scholarly confusion by Syriac writers using Greek sources. Biruni actually records6 the Greek form of the title "Longimanus" (mqrwsr, Gk. ^uxKpoxcip). Bahman's daughter Humay (Mid. Pers. Humag)7 is generally identified, atleast inname, with Humaya,8 a daughter of Vistaspa, whose fravasi iscelebrated inYasht 13.139, while Yasht 9.29 implies that she was taken prisoner, together with her sister, by Arjasp. The Shdh-ndma elaborates upon theepisode9 andrecounts their deliverance by Isfandiyar when he captures Ro'In Dez.Thus FirdausI knows two Humays, one is Gushtasp's daughter, whose hand Gushtasp promises at onepoint to anyone who will volunteer to avenge Zarer's blood,10 andwho later becomes a prisoner of the Turanians; the other is Bahman's daughter and wife, who has the title ofChihr-azad ("of noble birth") inIslamic sources and about whom the Avesta furnishes no information. The storyof Humay's abandoning her infant son Dara in the water, ofhis being brought up by alaundress, and of his then finding his way to the court and finally making his claim tothe throne isa variation on a familiar legend found repeatedly within and outside Iran. The account of her reign inIslamic sources shows the same admixture ofreports that we

find in the case ofBahman. Humay is said tohave fought many battles against Greece (Rum) and to have hadGreek prisoners build lofty monuments in Stakhr, resembling those of Rum.1 Hamza2 identifies the monuments with ha^dr sutun ("a thousand columns", i.e. the Persepolis complex).3 Gardizi (15) says that she transferred the capital from Balkh to Ctesiphon. Her next-of-kin marriage (khwedodah) to
Bahman,4 however, reflects an attested old custom. Hamza5 calls Humay Shamiran (Semiramis ?) also, and Wilhelm Eilers has included Humay among a series oflegendary women whose life stories echo inpart the
legend of Semiramis.6 With the two Daras we come closer tohistorical figures. Dara I (the Great) shows some aspects of Darius Fs rule. Gardizi (16) records a number of administrative reforms by Dara which arereminiscent of those ofDarius. His main role in the Iranian tradition, however, is to sire Dara IIand Alexander, and thus provide alink between the Iranian royal house and Alexander: Dara marries the daughter of the king of Rum, but finding her to have bad breath, sends her back toRum, where she gives birth to Alexander. Thegroundwork for this legendand the legends of Alexander as they appear in Iranian tradition was provided bythe adaptations of the romance by the pseudo-Callisthenes, a fictional account of Alexander which wastranslated into Middle Persian towards the end of the Sasanian period.7 Itis unlikely, however, that much of this fiction would have found itsway into theKhwadayndmag itself, since Zoroastrian antagonism towards Alexander was strong.8 In secular literature, however, considerable elements of his legends must have become popular already in pre-Islamic times. A Syriac translation made from the Middle Persian adaptation of the pseudo-Callisthenes exists. This translation waslater rendered into Arabic and then into Persian. No doubt it contributed toan increasein Alexander's popularity as a national hero, particularly since a modification in theoriginal story now characterized Alexander as a son of Dara I and a half-brother ofDaraII.
Islamic sources give a fairly full account ofAlexander legends based on the pseudo-Callisthenes,9 a fact which indicates that the two aspects of Alexander's story were current side byside in Sasanian times. This

should notsurprise us. A parallel may be seen in thedichotomy of
feeling inIran today over the Arab conquest, and also inthe fact that
many Persians have named their sons after Chingiz and Hulagu,the
Mongol conquerors of Iran. The later Kayanian kings are all heroes ofpopular legends and folk romances inwhich Iranian, Greek and Islamic elements are discernible. Among these are two lengthy folk epics of love and war, the Ddrdbndma and the Flru^shdh-ndma,1based onoral traditions. Humay, Dara, Alexander, Dara's sons Firuzshah and Dara's daughter Roshanak are among their chief personae.

HISTORICAL PERIODS IN THE NATIONAL TRADITION
THE ARSACIDS
Arsacid history wasalmost passed over altogether in the Khwaddy-ndmag. Consequently, the account ofthese kings isvery brief in all the Islamic sources. Firdausi2 states that he has heard only their names, and winds up their entire history in 20 lines. Their period was regarded as one of disunity and chaos, when anumber of petty kings ruled and the fortunes of the Iranians were atlow ebb. Hamza3 practically declares it the dark age of Iranian history, when " n o one cared to acquire knowledge or wisdom", until Ardashir arose. The "Letter of Tansar" goes much further and ina spiteful indictment ofthe Arsacids calls their period a time when the world was full of fiends and beasts in human shape, with no culture or education, and when nothing butcorruption and ruin emerged. The cities turned into deserts and cultivation into waste.4 This disparagement is set in contrast to aglowing picture of Ardashir's well-organized and cohesive empire. There is no doubt that Parthian history was neglected and distorted as a consequence ofSasanian antagonism. This antagonism isclear not only from the derogatory tone of the accounts derived from Sasanian royal circles about the nature of Arsacid rule,5 but also from the account given of the extermination of the Arsacids at thehand of the early Sasanians. According to a tradition cited by Tabarl (1. 823), when Ardashir and Shapur I became king, they eradicated the Arsacids in

fulfilment ofa vow by their ancestor Sasan, sonof Dara, to the effect that if he should become king hewould not leave asingle Arsacid alive. Sasanian propaganda described the Arsacid rule as the product of Alexander's insidious design anda disaster to Iranian sovereignty. It presented the Sasanians, in particular Ardashlr, on theother hand, as champions of national unity and restorers of past glories. Of course, Ardashir did not in actual fact break with the Parthian norms so abruptly. The great inscription of Shapur I at Ka'ba-yi Zardusht does not confirm anall-out effort byeither Ardashir or Shapur to centralize political andmilitary power. On the contrary, the dignitaries of the great houses whowere prominent during Parthian times joined the Sasanian court, andthetitles of the provincial kings were preserved, although now borne mostly by Sasanian princes.
The exaggerated contrast noted above must belong largely to the time of Khusrau I andhis father Kavad, andechoes their attempt at effecting a more tightly organized governmental structure, with the king of kings grasping the reins ofpower firmly, while the authorityof the nobility was curtailed. Toimpart authority to his policies, Khusrau attributed them, as the "Letter of Tansar" shows, to Ardashir and transferred opposite practices tothe Arsacids. This view ofthe Arsacids must have been emphasized even further after Khusrau II asa defensive measure against theprevailing political chaos andrepeated challenges to thecentral authority of the Sasanian state. It is also probable that Bahram Chobin, by reviving through his rebellion the spectre of Arsacid legitimacy, contributed toamore negative view ofthe Arsacids. In Firdausi's account1 ofhis challenge Bahram argues fervently for the right to the throne ofthe Arsacids, towhom hetraces his own descent, pointing tothe questionable lineage and the decadence ofthe Sasanians. Even though the story of Bahram as it appears in the Shdh-ndma is fictionalized, such arguments cannot but reflect the actual position that Bahram hadtaken. The authors of the latest version of the TZJowadayndmag under Yazdgird IIIhad therefore more than one reason to slight the history of the Arsacids andvilify their policies, particularly since Yazdgird was a grandson of Khusrau II,who had been challenged by Bahram.
The view that the account of the Arsacids in official Sasanian circles took a particularly negative turn after Hurmazd IV, although more favourable accounts of them existed earlier, gains credence with the

THE ARSACIDS
testimony of vestiges of Arsacid history as understood in Parthian times. One such testimony is their genealogy, which is variously traced to Dara,1 Isfandiyar,2 Kai Kavad,3 Ash son of Siyavush,4 and Arish the Bowman (of the time of Manuchihr).5 Such a line of descent can hardly be attributed to the Sasanian genealogists, who were less than anxious to prove Arsacid legitimacy. It must, therefore, derive from the Parthian period. Other evidence is the commonly benign treatment of individual Arsacid kings in Islamic sources. Tha'alibI depicts them generally as just and valiant. Interestingly, he says of Afqur Shah (Pakores)6 that he recovered the Kaviyan banner and took good care of it. Seeking to avenge Dara's blood, he fought against Rum, killed many Rumis and levelled many of their fortresses. He returned to Iran what Alexander had taken away in medicine, astronomy and philosophy. The Bundahishn(xxxv. 8) calls the Arsacids the practitioners of righteous rule (aso-xwatdylh). The tradition preserved in the Denkard (iv. 24) regarding the collection of Avestan texts during the Parthian period under Vologeses (Balash) is another indication that the Parthians were viewed favourably. Contrary to what we find in the "Letter of Tansar", the author of the Nihdyat al-irab relates a tradition according to which the Arsacids {Muliik al-tan>d*if) "were eager after wisdom and culture, and . . . in their time were written the books of Kalila wa Dimna, Sindbdd^ Lubrdsf. . ."7 In the "History of Q u m " we find the building of a fairly large number of villages and townships attributed to Arsacid princes, among them Milad b. Jurjin, Kai b. Milad, Bahram b. Judarz (Godarz) and Jurjin b. Milad.8 Tha'alibI (45 8fF.) relates a number of anecdotes and entertaining stories about the Arsacid kings that he says he found in his sources. They must generally derive from oral traditions of Parthian times. Again, contrary to reports of the rooting out of the Arsacid family, we find a number of Arsacid nobles in positions of prominence in Sasanian times. One is the powerful chief minister [bu^urg farmadhdr) under Yazdgird I and Bahram V, Mihr Narse, whose descent is traced by Tabari to Kai Ashak.9 Another is Bahram Chobln, as already noted.10

IRANIAN NATIONAL HISTORY
The lists of Arsacid kings inIslamic sources are confused and curtailed. The longest, given by Hamza1 on theauthority of Bahram b. Mardanshah, a Mobad ofFars, contains fifteen names; the shortest, by Firdausi,2 consists of nine. Although these lists in Islamic sources include the names of some known Arsacid kings, such as Ashk, Balash, Godarz and Ardavan, they do not conform to the list of the main Arsacid branch asknown from coins and classical sources. Most probably in the Islamic sources the names ofthe dynasts from different Arsacid branches have been mingled, many others having fallen into oblivion. The regnal years areeven less trustworthy, ranging between a total of 499 years3 and 244.4
Although the historical tradition has kept very little of Arsacid factual history, thedeeds of a number of Arsacid princes are mirrored, as was noted above (pp. 458f), in the heroic stories of the national epic. Were we better informed about events in eastern Iran inParthian times, we should probably have found a good many of them echoed by the adventures of Iranian kings andnobles as told by Firdausi.
Next to the Kayanian, the Parthian period must be counted as the most important heroic age, prompting much heroic literature. Opportune princely patronage fostered this literature, but its survival for long centuries andthrough Sasanian times must be attributed in large measure to its vigour andliterary quality.
THE SASANIANS
The accounts of the early Sasanians in Islamic and Pahlavl sourcesare less detailed and factual than is to be expected of a dynasty which kept records at court and had a well-developed scribal and administrative system. In theextant accounts of the kings theentertaining, rhetorical and moralizing elements outnumber those of historical fact and objective detail. Stories andlegends are told at every turn. Onenotable exception is the objective account of Ardashlr, the founder of the dynasty, particularly that of his early career, as given by Tabarl (1.
8i4ff.). Tabarfs account is probably nottaken from the Khwaddy-ndmag, because his version does not occur with such detail in other early Islamic sources, nor is it entirely complimentary. Read carefully, it depicts Papag as anambitious ingrate, and Ardashlr as a usurper in his own house. It stands in sharp contrast to theromanticized andhighly

THE SASANIANS
favourable account of the Kdrndmag. Tabari's account is most probably based on an independent history of Ardashlr which found its way into Islamic tradition. The history of the relations between Iran and Rome and their wars during the reigns of the early Sasanian kings is often cursory, rhetorical and laden with fiction and whimsical tales. The Armenian question never finds an adequate statement, the treatment of the problem of minorities is haphazard, and the wars of succession before Shapur II, notably between Bahram III and Narse, are practically ignored.
With Yazdgird I, the information given about each king becomes generally more factual, and yet the facts are somewhat selective. A balanced account of events with the necessary dates and details, or a clear analysis of policy, motives and personalities, is missing. Instead, we are treated to a selective picture of significant occurrences. Details of foreign policy and incidents which are devoid of narrative interest or entertainment potential were apparently omitted from the Khwaddyndmag. So were details of administration and military logistics. Pageantry, on the other hand, provides a major topic. The coronation of kings, their throne-addresses, scenes of banqueting, merrymaking and the hunt, the reception or dispatch of envoys, military reviews, arrays of arms and equipment, and gifts received or bestowed are described vividly. (See above pp. 4026° for a reflection of Sasanian conditions in the national history.)
The Sasanian historical tradition continued in both oral and written form after the invasion of the Arab armies and afforded the people a measure of pride and solace when their fortunes were overcast. In the 9th and 10th centuries, under the aegis of the Saffarids and the Samanids, Persian versions of the national history, in both prose and verse, emerged. By giving it a magnificent and enduring expression, Firdausi provided his compatriots with a superb instrument of national identity, as well as a source of inspiration for the troubled centuries to come.

PART IV
IRAN AND HER NEIGHBOURS



As a power which dominated many lands, influenced many cultures, and was receptive in turn to their impact, the place of Iran in world history and her contribution to world culture can be understood only in the light of her exchanges with the societies and the friendly or rival powers which surrounded her. Achaemenian Iran owed much in cultural terms to the Mesopotamian, Elamite, Anatolian and Egyptian civilizations, among others, and their heritage continued in an Iranianized form in the Parthian and Sasanian periods. In the wake of Alexander's conquest a strong wave of Hellenism swept over the Iranian territories. Later, however, the Iranian native culture and nationalism asserted themselves and under the aegis of the Arsacid and Sasanian dynasties Iran brought to bear a strong cultural impact on many of her neighbours, but more particularly on the peoples who lived partially or totally under her suzerainty. At the same time it drew strength from the energies and contributions of these peoples, and benefltted by contact with adjoining societies. Loanwords often provide the most readily noticeable expression of cultural exchanges and borrowings. The nature and effects of Hellenism in Iran are explored in Chapters i, 2, 3, 5, %a,19, 22 and 28, and in the Introduction. Relations with India are discussed in Chapters 5, 7, 22 and 26. The interactions with China, Mesopotamia, the Caucasus, Rome, Byzantium, the Arabs and the Turks are treated in this section. Although the political contacts have been indicated, it is the cultural exchanges which are emphasized. Editor.



CHAPTER II
IRAN AND MESOPOTAMIA
In 539 B#c* Cyrus peacefully took possession of Babylon, and the kingdom of Iranian peoples, taken over by the Achaemenian dynasty from the Medes, expanded to become the first real world-empire of ancient history. It is true that the overthrow of Croesus andhis Lydian kingdom, sealed by the conquest of Sardis in 546 B.C.,had already made the region of Asia Minor subject to the Persians; but it was the thrust down into the southerly regions of the Tigris and Euphrates which gave Cyrus and the Iranian state supranational significance through control of most of the known world. This region wasthe ancient centre of cuneiform culture which since the third millennium had permeated the whole of the Near East from eastern Anatolia and the Syrian-Palestinian coast to the high valleys of the Zagros mountains and the low-lying plains of Susa. It was here that people from the eastern mountains - Hurrians and Kassites - had already married into the Mesopotamian city and temple culture, setting upon it the stamp of their national idiosyncrasies. This area had from time to time been the arena of political confrontations, in which now Babylonians, nowAssyrians hadfought for hegemony over the neighbouring peoples. Now Cyrus was pressing into Babylon, as all after him would do whose ambition was to be sole rulers over the east, such as Alexander and the Seleucids, whose historical importance ebbed out only with their loss of Babylon and Assyria to the Arsacids. For the Sasanians, too, the lowlands of Iraq constituted the heart of their dominions, andwhen this heart finally fell a prey to the onslaught of Muslim armies, their rule over the east likewise was broken.
Thus Iraq, in spite of seeming to lie so far west of the region of Iranian settlement, belongs rather to Iran itself than to "Aniran", as Sasanian documents describe non-Iranian areas of the empire. The name al-'Iraq, for all its Arabic appearance, is derived from Middle Persian erdgh"lowlands". From the time of the Medes the political centre of gravity of Iran had lain in the west; it was here that all important cultural development had taken place, whereas in the east the art of writing wasunknown, with the seeming outstanding exception of the Avesta; but even this exception occurred only after Maz

daism had reached thecivilized west, where its canonical compositions
were noted down much later. Of the four residences of the Achaemenians named byHerodotus Ecbatana, Pasargadae or Persepolis, Susa and Babylon - the last was maintained as their most important capital, the fixed winter quarters, the central office ofbureaucracy, exchanged only in the heat of summer for some cool spot in the highlands. Under the Seleucids and the Parthians the site of the Mesopotamian capital moved a little tothe north on theTigris - to Seleucia andCtesiphon. It is indeed symbolic that these new foundations were built from the bricks of ancient Babylon, just as later Baghdad, a little further upstream, was built out of the ruins of the Sasanian double city of al-Mada'in.
When Alexander the Great at last halted his victorious march, which led himas far as the Indus, the eastern frontier of the Achaemenian kingdom, andset hisface once again towards thewest, he saw as the final goal of his desires therebuilding of Babylon, whose monuments and mighty temples (fi-sagila) he wanted to bring to life again; west and east were to merge into a vast empire, andBabylon would be the capital of the world. The "wedding of the ten thousand" wasa symbolic act directed towards this end. Alexander's early death (323 B.C.)brought all these designs to nothing. When Seleucus I Nicator (321-281) sethimself up as ruler of the east, first to fall within his dominion were thesatrapies of Babylon and, in 317.B.C., the Susan satrapies of Elam and Khuzistan as well. After thereconquest of Iran, in 306 B.C. he proclaimed himself fiaaiAevs, and after his victory at Ipsos in Phrygia (301 B.C.) he added theprovinces of Syria, Armenia and Mesopotamia, as well as parts of Cappadocia andCilicia. Next to Alexander, Seleucus was the most important founder of cities; we know of no less than nine places that bear his name, the most distinguished of which is Seleucia on theright bank of the Tigris, north of Babylon and south of Baghdad. This new Babylonian capital quickly developed to become the most important trading emporium ofthe Hellenized Achaemenian empire. Although frequently destroyed in later times, especially under theParthians as a result of wars with the Romans, it yet maintained its importance until supplanted under the 'Abbasids (from A.D. 750) by Baghdad.
Babylon continued to be thecentre of this Asiatic empire under the Macedonian successors of Seleucus, themost important among whom

were Antiochus I Soter (281-63), w h o kept theempire going after his father's murder, andAntiochus III (The Great) Kallinikos (222-187). Not until the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes (176-63), were the Seleucids to forfeit the main territory of Babylon. Antiochus died after a forlorn battle against the Parthians in the Persian Tabai. The residue of the Seleucid empire, limited to Syria, was made a Roman province by Pompey.
It was theParthian Mithradates I (174-36), thesixth to bear thename Arsaces, who finally succeeded in incorporating east and north-west Iran into hisempire, andwith consolidated strength pressed intothe land of the tworivers. From 144 B.C. Babylon became Parthian. In the beginning theArsacids ruled over the eastern Caspian region with Hyrcania at its centre and having Nisa and Hecatompylos as capitals. Soon, however, Ctesiphon on theTigris opposite the Greek Seleucia became thecapital of this new Iranian state. By the middle of the 2ndcentury B.C. thecentre of gravity of the Parthian empire had shifted to Mesopotamia, and, apart from occasional encroachment on one side orthe other, the Euphrates formed Iran's true western frontier, until the end ofthe Sasanian period inthe 7th century. Just as the traditional residences of the Achaemenians in the highlands (Pasargadae, Persepolis andthe Median Ecbatana) were soon ousted by Susaand Babylon, sonow the lowland Ctesiphon was totake over as metropolis from Hecatompylos andNisa in theoldParthian country.
It is true that Ctesiphon was repeatedly conquered by theRomans; these, however, were merely brief episodes with no enduring consequences : they were Roman reprisals for Parthian predatory excursions. And while the Romans fought with the Parthians for centuries over Armenia, or were forced constantly to defend their frontier alongthe Syrian desert, in the endIraq remained under Parthian rule. It must have been specially galling for the Romans to realize that itwas impossible forthem toprotect their guard-posts by a territory reaching further into Mesopotamia. This fact they learned in 53B.C. at Carrhae when, led by Crassus, the eagles of the legions - accustomed to victory - were captured by Orodes I. Carrhae is theancient Harran of upper Mesopotamia, a city celebrated as a shrine of moon-worship. The legionary eagles were finally returned by Phraates IV(37-2 B.C.) as the price of release from the intrigues of Roman-sponsored rivals to the throne.

Meanwhile a development ofdecisive political importance had been going on. Under theAssyrians theArabs hadalready been making their influence felt. This development of Arab influence was in fact the start ofthat great migration oftribes, which continued the preceding Aramaean infiltration, and reached its climax in the expansion of Islam. From thesouth, desert people pressed into civilized Palestine and Syria and also along the banks of the Euphrates and theTigris. Whereas theancient caravan city of Palmyra (Tadmor of the Bible) had been a bulwark forthe Romans against invading Arab tribes and, even more, against pillaging Parthians, a similar fortress was built up in northern Iraq from theArsacid side. This was the city of Hatra (al-Hadr) to thewest of ancient Assur, a fortified commercial centre like the later Hira. The ruins ofthe desert city ofHatra are impressive. They display walls fortified by towers, and a great square inthe centre where once stood thepalace and thetemple. There was no fire-cult there, as was originally believed. The temple was dedicated to local gods, especially to the sun-god Samas. But the masks which decorate the exterior walls ofthe temple are inanunmistakably Iranian idiom.1 The emperor Trajan, who marched triumphantly into Babylonia and reached the Persian Gulf, tried on his return totake Hatra, but in vain. Similarly Septimius Severus, who at first was victorious against Vologeses IV,was unable to capture Hatra (A.D. 197), although the Romans had already made Mesopotamia into a province with capitals at Edessa and Nisibis.
Just as atan earlier date (530 B.C.) Cyrus the Achaemenian had defeated his Median overlord Astyages and finally taken possession of his capital of Ecbatana (Hamadan), so from Persis, the province of Fars, came the Sasanian Ardashir and sethimself upon the throne of Artabanus (Ardavan V), thelast of the Arsacids. The latter was defeated and killed in the plain of Hormizdagan in Khuzistan. By A.D. 226 Ctesiphon, the capital, was in Ardashlr's power.
Thus dominion over Iran again fell toa Persian from the south-west, while the Medes and Arsacids joined in the government from the north-west. Even the novelish story of the usurpation of power by Ardashir and the overthrow ofArdavan resembles inessential features the romantic tale ofCyrus and the dethronement of Astyages (5 50 B.C.).

In Persis we are onthe ground ofancient Elam, more precisely on the mountains of Anshan itself and so nearer to thefertile andcivilized region ofSumer and Babylon. With the capture ofCtesiphon (A.D. 226), Ardashlr I (224-40) gained possession of Babylonia and along with it the claim toworld-historic importance. Ardashlr celebrated his victory over Ardavan in several rock-reliefs,1 in which Iranian religion, too, found fresh expression. No less lustrous a kingly personality do we see in Shapur I (241-71), of whom we possess not only many rock-reliefs, but the longest extant Sasanian inscription which, as foundation charter of several imperial fire temples, provides both an account ofhis campaigns inthe west and also of the high officials whoadministered the empire - a kind of notitia dignitatum. Themilitary section reaches its high point in the report of the battles at Edessa in upper Mesopotamia, in which the Roman emperor Valerian was taken prisoner (A.D. 260), an incident repeatedly recorded on Shapur's rock-reliefs.
Shapur II (310-79) built a moat in Iraq as protection against raids by desert Arabs; healso rebuilt the armoury at Anbar in central Iraq (near Hira), naming it Peroz-Shapur. At first Shapur II suffered defeats at Ctesiphon andelsewhere at the hands of the emperor Julian the Apostate, but inthe end he was able toforce the famished Roman army to retreat. The emperor Julian died of a wound received in battle, in Iraq in A.D. 363, and hissuccessor Jovian was compelled to agree to the evacuation ofimportant Roman strongholds inMesopotamia such as Nisibis and Singara, and Rome had now togive upall ambitions in the direction ofArmenia aswell.
During thereign of Shapur II, a strong supporter of the Mazdayasnian religion, Christians were persecuted as enemies of the state. Since the time of Shapur III(383-8) there came to bea catholicos of Seleucia, but not until the reign ofYazdgard I (399-422) was Christian public worship permitted (A.D. 409).
Bahram V (420-39), nicknamed Gor,2 overcame incipient rebellion with the aid ofArabian mounted tribes. He had been educated in Hira in Babylonia byArabs, and there are even Arabic poems attributed to him. In his day Persian Christians began tobreak their links with their Syrian brethren in thewest, and, protected by thePersian crown, to

form their own Iranian church. This separation was a political move of the Sasanians, designed to break the traditional tie between the Christian subjects of the Persian empire andByzantium in the west.
Under Khusrau I (531-79) the Sasanian empire reached its final zenith. In the warwith the eastern Roman empire Antioch was conquered (A.D. 540) andits inhabitants were settled in a southern Babylonian city, which was named Veh-Antiyuk. Some ofthe Neo-Platonists, driven from Athens by Justinian after the closure of the Academy, seem tohave carried ontheir work fora brief spell inthe newly founded university of Gundeshapur in Khuzistan. Khusrau II Parviz (590-628) succeeded in conquering almost the whole eastern Roman empire including Egypt. But ashewas drawn up before Byzantium, the military genius, later to become the emperor Heraclius (610-41), attacked himin the rear, which extended far into Armenia and Mesopotamia. After the battle of Nineveh Khusrau II marched back to his residence of Dastagird, north-east of Ba'quba; there he was murdered byhis sonSheroy, who hadthesupport of the generals. Theshort-lived Sheroy succeeded in making a peace of convenience with Heraclius, according to which the old frontiers of the two exhausted empires were re-established.
In 632, amid a general state ofanarchy, the last ofthe Sasanian kings, Yazdgard III, mounted thethrone. In thesame year Muhammad died, and theArab commander-in-chief Khalid b. al-Walid with his bedouin warriors had already occupied the marshes of south Babylonia. The Persians were defeated in three battles: first at Qadisiyya near Kufa in A.D. 637, then in the same year near Jalula (modern Jalaula near Khanaqln on the Iraq-Persian border) and finally in A.D. 642 at Nihavand (inMedia, south of Hamadan), so that theMuslims notonly kept firm hold on theland of the two rivers, butwere able to prepare for a further advance into the Iranian highlands. The conquest of Ctesiphon and Babylonia made the Arabs themasters of the Near East.
During the thousand years that had passed since the end of the Achaemenian empire, the face of civilized Mesopotamia had undergone considerable change. Compared with the ancient oriental period, the great prosperity, still extravagantly acclaimed by Herodotus, had undoubtedly declined. Babylonia was still a land of agriculture and of commerce; but famous cities such as Babylon or the Assyrian residences had visibly decayed; destroyed by wars, the temples, once

the centre and the adornment ofa city, were nolonger, orvery seldom being rebuilt. Rivers had changed course andmoved away from the townships andthe canals hadbecome silted up. This hadled to the founding of new townships, which grew up often from military encampments. These flourished rapidly behind the stout walls which protected the inhabitants from increasing nomadic activity. In place of the Amorite and Aramaean attacks of old, they now faced an Arab threat from the desert. Let us give a brief sketch of a few of these new foundations. There is,for example, Charax Spasinou on the Shatt al-'Arab, once thought tohave been close toKhurramshahr; most probably, however,
it was situated further north.1 Charax was thecapital of the region of Mesene and was known as Karaka da-Mesan. The sonorous Greek equivalent was "the Palisaded Encampment of Spasines", and the surrounding district was called the Characene. It was here, inthe ancient "land of the sea", that the local prince Hyspaosines, son of Sagdodonacus, andundoubtedly an Iranian, setuphischief residence in 129 B.C. The place had previously been named Antiocheia by Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-64). Originally it had been called Alexandria, after a garrison placed by Alexander the Great at the mouth of the Pasitigris (the modern Karun). Hyspaosines' successors likewiseall bore Persian names such as Tiraios and Artabazos, and a certain
Obadas Frataphernes is mentioned as late as A.D. 166.2
The history of al-Hira is substantially more modern. It lay in the south near Kufa between theNahr Hindlya andtheNahr Najaf.The place was settled bytribes from 'Uman and southern Arabia and formed the front line of Persian defence against thebedouin. This explains its originally Aramaic name Herta da-Taiyaye meaning "the tent encamp
ment of T a i " - a tribal name denoting Arabs in general.3 Itwas composed of forts, including gardens and fields, encircled by walls and towers. InA.D. 195 the kingdom ofHira was founded by Nu'man I, the "leader ofthe Persians", and it endured until almost the close ofthe Sasanian era, when Khusrau II (590-627) overthrew the Lakhmid dynasty and placed a Persian governor over the city of Hira. Hira was governed byAzadbeh in A.D. 633, in which year it was conquered by Khalid b. al-Walid. It wasfrom Hira as a base that AbuBakr and

'Umar successfully attacked Mesopotamia, as a prelude to the overthrow of the Sasanian empire. The inhabitants of the city were cosmopolitan in outlook and composed of diverse elements: heathen Arab, deriving from the very earliest days of the city's existence; Sasanian Persian, by virtue of its feudal relationship to the sovereign lords of Ctesiphon; and Byzantine Christian, byvirtue ofits beingthe see of a bishop and the springboard of the Nestorian missions to Arabia. A tomb inscription in al-Namara indicates that Imra' al-Qais, a Lakhmid prince, became a Christian; and Dair Hind near Hira was,
as thename indicates, a monastery, endowed bya Lakhmid princess.1 According to thedocuments, Mundhir III (503-54), being a heathen Arab, sacrificed the son ofhis adversary to Aphrodite, i.e. to al-'Uzza, the Arabian Venus. The city survived assault and conquest by the Kinda, and Mundhir III even killed the bedouin prince Harith b. *Amr. In the 6th century Hira was twice conquered andlaid waste by the factious Ghassanids, who fought onthe side of the Romans; but each time it recovered. Not until Khusrau II had besieged the city and deposed and executed Nu'man IIIdid the city's glory come to anend. Today the ruins of the palace of Khawarnaq (a Persian name) still
bear witness to that glory.2 Very quickly Hira was overshadowed and finally completely eclipsed bytheMuslim cities of Kufa and Basra.
The capital ofBabylon and hence the metropolis ofthe whole empire was no longer sited, as Babylon hadbeen, on the Euphrates; it had moved north to theleft bank of the Tigris, opposite the Hellenistic
Seleucia, and it now bore the Graecized form Ctesiphon3 ofthe Iranian
"Tespon".4 The precise meaning of the name-shared by a fortress near Marv - isunknown. Later Ctesiphon was toberenamed with one of the many Veh compounds: Veh-Kavat meaning "good Kavat/
Qubad".5 The Arabs called the Sasanian capital al-Mada'in, the

The name must have denoted the merging together of a group of several townships, a genuine multiple synoikismos,as the Greeks call it. About thirty-two kilometres south of Baghdad stand the imposing ruins of the great palace of the rulers, the date of the building of which is still undecided. This is known astheTaq-i-Kisra, a long fa5ade adorned with half-pillars, interrupted in the centre by an enormous east-facing doorway-arch, the aivdn, 37 metres high and 27 metres broad, thelargest intact brick arch in existence (pi. 83). In this throneroom all the governors of the empire assembled before the sovereign. There were twoadjoining barrel-vaults; the one on the right (north) was brought down by the flooding of the Tigris in 1909.

Ctesiphon's fortunes as a city had been most varied. Twice it had been taken by theemperor Trajan; it hadeven been burned to the ground inthe reign ofVologeses III; it had been conquered inA.D. 162 by the legate Verus, and pillaged in A.D. 197 bySeptimius Severus; it was plundered bythe Byzantine emperor Heraclius inA.D. 628; finally it was pillaged afresh by an Arab onslaught under thecaliph 'Umar, to disappear for ever from history (A.D. 637). Not a vestige remains of another building, the"white palace", about onekilometre north of the Taq. It was thedesire of the caliph Mansur (745-75) t n a t a ^ traces of Ctesiphon be totally obliterated when he selected the more northerly Baghdad forhis residence. According to tradition, however, his Persian counsellor, the Barmakid Khalid, prevented his desire from being carried out.
The name Baghdad is Iranian; originally it isa man's name, Bagadata (Armenian Bagarat), which means "given by God" or "created by God"; andlater it is transferred to theplace, signifying "township of B". Theexistence of some such name is in fact documented in cuneiform records, and it is attached to uruBitn Ba-ga--da-a-ti, an Achaemenian town in the time of Artaxerxes I (465-25 B.C.). But this town waslocated near ancient Nippur - modern Tell Niffar/Nuffar north-east of Diwaniya. And theplace called Bdgdd{f)in the Talmud must likewise be sought elsewhere.1 Probably there were other properties or estates in Iraq belonging to the same or another Iranian noble bearing this common name, and near thelater Baghdad. Such estates, as mentioned in Xenophon's Anabasis, are called dasdkir in Arabic - the plural of daskara - which is ultimately a borrowing from Old Persian dasta-karta "hand-made". Forthis reason Dastgird isa common place-name all over Iran. There was a famous Dastajird north-east of Ba'quba in Iraq; to distinguish it from others, it was called Dastajird al-Malik, "the Dastgird of the king", because it was here that Khusrau IIhad taken up residence. After repeated destructions it still remained animportant city in Islamic times.2
For our final example wetake Hatra in thenorth. The impressive ruins of this city lie north-west ofancient Assur and west of the river Tharthar (174 kilometres from Mosul along thepresent motorway).3 In a sense Hatra, as a fortified base for Arab warring tribes, wasthe counterpart ofHira inthe south. But whereas the latter word originally

denoted a temporary encampment of nomads, al-Hadr by contrast denotes a township that was meant to be permanent (Arabic hadar "settled population", haddra"sedentariness"). At the time when Hatra appeared in history, it faced Roman garrisons in Commagene and Osroene as well as in Palmyra. Thesix-kilometre wall, forming an almost complete circle, and having a ditch (Persian khandaq) outside, is fortified with towers, and encloses a huge square with palace and temple buildings. Theimposing masses of square hewn stone are adorned with cornices and medallion-like reliefs of the city gods
(pl. 3 3 («M0).
Twice Hatra was besieged, but in vain. The first unsuccessful siege was mounted by the emperor Trajan on his return from Ctesiphon (A.D. II6), thesecond by Septimius Severus, whose army eventually began to mutiny in theface of the brave defenders of the city, and forced their commander to retreat (A.D. 198).x Shapur I (241-72) was the first to succeed in conquering the city, after it had traitorously joined the Romans (A.D. 250). On this occasion Hatra was so thoroughly razed that Arab geographers of the Middle Ages were nolonger sure of its location. Of the rulers of Hatra whose names we know, King Barsemius deserves mention.2 With histroop of cavalry he fell upon Septimius Severus' legions and set- their siege-engines alight with naphtha. Another prince ofHatra was Sanatruq,3 after whom the city was called Hatr(a) d9-Sanatru(q).4 His name in Arabic became Satiriin, and he is supposed tobe identical with Daizan, the last ruler of the city. Alegend persists concerning his daughter Nadira. It is said that when Shapur I was besieging the city she fell in love with him and secretly gave him entry into the city. And so, inthe popular imagination oflater generations, Hatra was the proud city that fell, a sacrifice on the altar oflove.

often proved capable of adapting itself to newthings (the Kassite period is a typical example), theempire of the Achaemenians marked an important turning-point, evidenced not so much in architecture and fine art as in correspondence and in speech (see below). The real break with ancient oriental tradition, here as elsewhere, was not effectively made, however, until the conquest of Alexander, which inaugurated Hellenism. This is proved byGreek transcriptions on clay
tablets (e.g. ytoifxap So/* 8o/x = gisimmar dumu = "palm shoot")1 and a considerable amount of epigraphic material, including the enigmatic Greek inscription in the temple of a god named Gareus,
from theParthian city of Uruk anddated A.D. n o . 2 Babylon had its
Greek theatre, excavated in 1904.3 From the early Seleucid period the figure of a Babylonian priest of Bel symbolically stands out. It was Berossos, whotried to animate the Greeks with an interest in the ancient history and religion of the land of the two rivers, of which he was still a representative. His work entitled BafivXajviaKd or XaA8ai'*a is preserved only in a fewquotations. It was dedicated to Antiochus Soter andwas probably a response to a western demand. Butin the land of the tworivers there wasnever anyreal amalgamation with
Greek elements.4
Parthian art or, more precisely, Mesopotamian art of the Arsacid period worked with borrowed elements of Greek fashion, but these quickly lost their essential character. The Parthian strata can be detected
at many excavation sites, especially atAssur,5at Babylon6 and at Uruk.7 Like the Seleucids the Arsacids were zealous founders or rebuilders of cities. Thus, near later Kufa, the map shows us a Vologesia, called
after the common Parthian personal name Vologeses.8

As faraway asIndia and Central Asia Greek influence is discernible, especially in pictorial art, andis widely recognizable in the flowing style of clothing. The Berlin Museum possesses two equestrian figures in painted clay, wearing Parthian clothes with their characteristic
trousers (pi. 34),1 such as westill find portrayed in similar equestrian pieces on Sasanian reliefs, andalso on silver dishes even in theearly Islamic period. Vessels discovered in Iraq, as well as the sarcophagi, dating from the Parthian period onwards, arecharacterized bya dark green glaze, shading into blue. Nude female dancers with veils reflect the hedonistic commonplace philosophy of Hellenism, even on the "slipper sarco
phagi" (socalled by theexcavators) of the Parthian period.2 Special mention is deserved by the stucco decoration of palace walls, with their typical patterns andmedallions, yielded up especially from the
soil of late Sasanian Ctesiphon (pi. 3 5 (#)-(£)).3 This is undoubtedly an imitation of what was originally wood-carving which, in treeless Iraq, had tomake do with plaster and clay. Sasanian, too, are the copper pots, with their crooked, projecting beaks, such as are still used in Arab countries today, especially in Iraq.
Now we may consider the relationship of Iran to Babylon in the linguistic and literary sector. To begin with it was the land of the tworivers that took the lead. It is true that at the time when Sumerian script was invented, corresponding attempts were notlacking in thehighlands,
at Kashan and Kirman, in Susa and elsewhere.4 Even in the period of cuneiform script the Elamite stroke-script was still prominent, but this, too, wassoon superseded by the Sumerian-Akkadian syllabaryand ideographic system, which took over inthe highlands ofIran aseverywhere else. Finally, however, Iran evolved its own cuneiform script, the old Persian script ofthe Achaemenian period, the origins of which are still not certain; but vestiges of ideograms, fragments ofold syllabic writing, and a certain absence of system allow usto conjecture that this script, before it fell into the mould of alphabetical characters,

had its antecedents - unknown to us- in regions where the Mesopo
tamian cuneiform script held sway, such as Urartu beyond Media,but
probably notin Elam. None theless in those days thecuneiform tradition was alreadybeing challenged, and in theend it was overthrown bythe acceptance of Aramaic script, first inIraq and later in Iran. Typical of the Aramaicizing of the land of the two rivers in this time is anAramaic incantation from thelater period of Uruk, written in cuneiform script.1 The court and thepriesthood were still using this ancient, indigenous script for official purposes. In this practice the Assyrian kings were followed by first the Chaldaean andthen the Persian emperors.2 Alongside the official stone inscriptions of the Achaemenians, in thethree traditional languages (Babylonian, Elamite, OldPersian), parchment andpapyrus records andtheuse of soot-ink also took their place, for the domestic use of the Achaemenian administration. It waswith these materials, and in theAramaic tongue, that thesovereign corresponded with his satraps, and these, in turn, with other officials. From this "imperial Aramaic", as Markwart has called it, there evolved theParthian script, which was first used for official documents in Parthian times, and Pahlavl script, theearliest form of which is found in therock inscriptions of the Sasanian kings.3 The art of writing and theAramaic script were transmitted beyond Iran to India (Old Indian lipi- "writing" corresponds to Old Persian dipt- and Old Indian pustd- " b o o k " to New Persian piist "skin"). The Phoenician alphabet must also have passed through Iran to theIndians, who developed their own Brahml and Kharosthi scripts from it, eventually using these to write down their sacred scriptures. The Avesta, too, was ultimately put into writing; when, where, and how this was done is disputed. The Avesta alphabet, which makes useof vowel letters, undoubtedly on a Greek model, is

based on thePahlavi-Aramaic alphabet.1 The civilizing influence of Babylonia wasthus of the greatest importance for the religion of Iran.
In language also thetwo worlds mutually penetrated one another, and it is especially in language that the Iranian-Semitic cultural encounter-to usean aptphrase of G. Widengren2-is most clearly manifest. Sumerian-Akkadian loan-words had, atan early date, reached the highlands from Iraq-words such as the Sumerian dub (Akk. tuppum) "clay tablet" becoming OP dipt "(piece of) writing", and Akkadian maskum "skin bag" becoming OP maskd (fern.). Even in the later Avesta Iraqi-Aramaic loan-words are not unknown; inthe Vendidad, for example, we find tanura (neut.) "oven" (Akk. tinurum, Arabic tannur) and tutuk (fern.) "clay" (Akk. tittum\titum^ Arabic fin). In the Achaemenian period the reverse process is to be observed. Iranian technical terms - the names for trades and officials, for example infiltrated the plains3-ddtabara "judge" (NP dd(d)var), gan^abara "master of the treasury" (N¥ganjur),pi8fa-bara "distributor of rations", hamdra-kara "paymaster, finance .minister",4 xsaOra-pdna "satrap"
(Armenian sahap), apaddna "palace" (NP aivdn)^ u^-bdra "(royal) demesne"-and others still unexplained. The plant-name aspasti "lucerne" (NP aspist) is recorded in cuneiform script in Iraq even before the days of the Achaemenians.5
Although itwas not until the Arab invasion that the Persian language became saturated with foreign loan-words, in modern Persian there is still a small Semitic stratum that came into the language before the Arab period, e.g.
rimd "unicorn, wild bull" (Sem. ri'm-), saidd "mad with love", "demon" (Akk. sedum), ja/dd "mid-winter, nativity (of Christ)" (Sem. w Id), ddhu/, ddkhu "scarecrow" (Aram. dahaluld),
afydnjfuydn "alas!" < bdgdn (late Babylonian ba-ga-ni(-')).6

These are allevidence of the spread ofAramaic education and the use of Aramaic as a lingua franca at that time. Such words, notto be confused with the Pahlavi ideograms (theso-called hu^ydrish)^ had thus found their way into Iranian from Aramaic without any intermediary. A whole book would be required in order to list from theArabic dictionaries allthose words, the Middle Iranian form ofwhich proves the existence of a post-Achaemenian butpre-Islamic borrowing from
Iranian languages; the following Arabic roots are examples.1 dbr II "toplan, organize": diplr — "scribe" dw n II "tolist, register": dlvdn = "collection of writings" djn "toprofess one's faith": den — "religion" 8 br "to write, read over": cf.dbr db r " t odocument, collect": cf. dbr f ts II " t otest, investigate": pitaxl "the name of an official" x % n " t ostore, preserve": ya^n "treasure" (Median form) k n% "tohoard, bury": ganj "treasure" m hr I/II "toseal": muhr "seal" n m q n "towrite elegantly, adorn": ndmak "letter, book" rs mI/II "towrite down": cf. r ? m r % m" t o bundle": ra%m "order" r % q "to nourish, bestow": rovtfy "daily bread" s rj II " t osaddle": sary "saddle" ndq "to practise witchcraft":vyindiy w q II "toadorn": vgfidy (Median form) w r II "tolie, falsify": %ur "lie, violence" Words like liwdn < al-iwdn < aiwdn assumed the Arabic article al- > /

I16 byTrajan), asthe bridge in the Parthian era between Semitic Mesopotamia and Iran proper, and here he has chiefly in mind exchanges of literature and "Weltanschauung". TheAdiabene is the country between upper and lower Zab, that isthe land ofthe Kurds; and the Kurdish vocabulary doesin fact contain numerous expressions which were borrowed directly from the old Semitic Iraq before the Arab period, and which are
foreign to allother Iranian dialects.3

In literature, too,the land of the two rivers stands in the closest relationship with its neighbours. Ancient material, often as early as Sumerian, found its waywestwards (e.g. thestory of the Flood in the Old Testament), and also northwards, where it appears among the Hurrians andtheHittites (Gilgamesh). There is anAramaic version of the Ahiqar tale, andit turns up again in Egypt, in the Elephantine papyri of the Jewish military colony of the Achaemenian empire.As Haiqar, thewise vizier lives onin Arabian folk-tales (The Thousand and One Nights).
The land of the tworivers layopen to allsides, andhasalways been a melting-pot of races and cultures. Through it eastern writings, too, streamed into the west. The Sasanian empire was the mediator of Indian culture, from which came not only the game of chess (the game of nard,backgammon, is considered anIranian counter-invention),but also thegreat collection of fables known as thePanchatantra, Persian Kalila va Dimna. Other tales existed already intheenriched Iranian form as " T h e Thousand Tales" (ha^ar afsdnak). This was augmented by further material from the Semitic world of Iraq, and in the Islamic Middle Ages grew into thecollection known as The Thousand and One Nights.1 The strength of the Iranian-Iraqi element inthis is obvious on almost every page, especially in theproper names used; even the name of the heroine, Sheherezade, is Persian: Chihrd^dd. Sindbad, thesailor, also hasa Persian name.
There is yetanother subject we must addto those which so often feature in Persian romance andpoetry, andin theminiature painting that accompanies them; that is falconry, which was so popular in medieval Europe as well. There is evidence of this sport already in ancient Mesopotamia,2 whither it may well have come from the eastern mountain civilizations. Atallevents, among Aramaeans, Arabs and Armenians, the words for falcon and falconer as well as other expressions related to falconry are borrowings from Iran (Aram. bd%d\i and bdtfqd; Armen. ba^ai/ba^e; Arab. bd%).3

brought fresh motifs from the middle Zagros to Babylonia leading to the emergence of the kudurru documents. Their gods, like those of the Elamites before them, became identified with the SumerianAkkadian pantheon. The tree oflife and fecundating genii1 are characteristic of Assyrian reliefs, as they are of the Liiristan bronzes.2 In the Achaemenian period there came fresh fusions. That god of enigmatic origin, Tir(seen in Tiridates, etc.) of the Iranians, corresponds to the old god Nebo (Nabium), theglittering planet Mercury.3 In the Aramaean syncretism of Hatra, Dura-Europos, andPalmyra the ancient oriental gods seem to beclothed inIranian ideas and interspersed with like figures from the Greek pantheon; nor isthe ancient Arabic element missing. From a very early date, perhaps even from pre-Achaemenian times, special importance attached to the Jewish-Iranian relationship. A recollection of this relationship is probably preserved in thebook of Tobit, who used to travel about between Nineveh and Rhages (Ray). Certainly after theconquest of the northern kingdom of Samaria by Sargon (722 B.C.), many Jews settled in Assyria, as we know from cuneiform legal documents.4 The connection was even closer in the Achaemenian era;5 it is possible, indeed, that Jews of the Exile made their contribution to theunarmed invasion of Cyrus (539 B.C.).6 The Esther story of the Old Testament seems to refer notto Xerxes,but to Artaxerxes I Longimanus (465-25), oneof whose wives bore the Babylonian name Kosmartydene (i.e. dQus-mdrta-iddind).In any event, "Esther" is a form of the Iranian word stdra "star" (NP sitdra) and in the sense of star-flower (as the Jewish form Hddassahinstructs us) is the myrtle blossom, still so cherished by Zoroastrians. Through the concept ofa "God ofheaven", wise Jews like Ezra sought to interest the Mazda-worshipping Iranians in thetribal God of the Jews;and with thecollaboration of Nehemiah, cup-bearer to theking of kings,

the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem, destroyed under Nebuchadnezzar, was accomplished.1 Babylon became the centre of Jewry. It was here that both the Mishna andthe Talmud were composed, and the so-called Babylonian vocalization dominated their manuscripts. The vocabulary andproper names in theTalmud unite the AramaicAkkadian world with the Persian-Iranian world through hundreds of borrowings.2
The liberal-minded ruler Yazdgard I went so far as to marry Shushandukht (Susannah), a daughter of the Jewish exiliarch (res galutd) in Babylon, who thus became numbered among thedignitaries of the empire.3 In those days the seat ofthe exiliarch was at Mahoze, that is to say Mada'in-Ctesiphon; but later al-Hilla on the Euphrates, six kilometres from the ruins of Babylon, became the central town of the Jews in Iraq. Like Judaism, the Christian religion was a considerable force in the Sasanian empire, and, once again, itsinfluence was concentrated in Iraq. By the 3rd century this region, with the inclusion of northern Mesopotamia and the region around Susa, had been divided into a series of dioceses, with episcopal sees at Sinjar, Arbela, Kirkuk, Hulwan and others, and inBabylonia proper, inMesene and Khuzistan.4 Under the Sasanian dynasty the Mazdayasnian faith constituted the state religion, and so conflicts were bound to arise; these reached a climax in the persecution of Christians by Shapur II (310-79). When in A.D. 379 Theodosius I became emperor and Christianity became virtually the official religion of the western Roman empire and the emperor theprotector of all Christians, the Christians of the Sasanian empire fell under suspicion, not unfounded, ofconspiring with enemies of the state in the west. Hence it became the aim of the sovereigns either to convert or reclaim Christians to Mazdaism or, failing this, to separate them from their fellow Christians in theRoman empire. This was achieved, however, only when, in thecourse of the Christological controversy, the supporters of Nestorius (d. c. A.D. 451) separated from the later Jacobites of Edessa and spread their owndogma amongst the Christians ofthe Persian empire. They carried on afar-flung mission,

based in Iraq; they penetrated Central Asia and reached as faras India and China (there is a Nestorian-Syrian inscription from Singafu dated A.D. 781), and it was the Nestorians who transmitted the heritage of later antiquity to theMuslims. Although strife repeatedly flared up with thezealous clergy of the Sasanian state church, theChristians of Mesopotamia andArmenia enjoyed a respected position. Khusrau II (590-627) even married theByzantine emperor's daughter Maria;but his other wife, thefamed Shirin, also a Christian, lives on to this day in the most elevated tradition ofpoetry and miniature painting aswell as in the touching tale of simple people, as the gracious ideal of
womanhood.1 The drama of the foundation of a new world-religion, which shook both the Christian west and Zoroastrian Iran, was also enacted in Mesopotamia; this religion was Manichaeism. Mani, a Parthian on his mother's side, was born at Ctesiphon in the last decade of the Arsacid era (A.D. 216). His dualistic doctrine, insome respects a final outcome of Zoroastrianism, quickly spread from Babylonia to the west, to be accepted bytheyouthful St Augustine, later a Father of the Christian church, andalso far into theeast, where as late as the 8thcentury it became accepted as the state religion by the Turkish Uighurs in Chinese Turkestan. In his Iranian homeland, however, Man! had little success. At first he was regarded with sympathy and interest by Shapur I (242-73) to whom he dedicated his book, Shdpurakdn,but soon he incurred the hatred of the mobads, and inA.D. 276 died a martyr under Bahram I. Theplace of his death was the prison of Belabad (i.e. Bet-Lapat), renamed Gundeshapur, at Shushtar in the province of Susa.
A genuine product of Iraqi-Iranian syncretism is to befound in the Mandaeans of southern Babylonia, sometimes called Sabians or Nazoraeans, of whom a remnant canbe found today, many of them silversmiths, along the Shatt al-'Arab andaround Hawlza (Huwaiza) in Khuzistan. These are a gnostic baptist sect having rituals and scriptures of their own. Learned discussion still goes onabout their origin and antecedents. Linguistically they continue, in some measure, the now extinct Aramaic of Mesopotamia, with its Sumerian-Akkadian substratum; but their language is also strongly imbued with Iranian elements. The Mandaeans have recently become the object of important research, which is trying to understand the chief elements of their

worship andpractice, which sooner or later will be threatened with extinction. Likewise unexplained are the origins of Yazldis in Iraqi Kurdistan and theregion of Sinjar, north-east and west of Mosul. Astheir common name "devil-worshippers'* indicates, they offer to Satan, as Peacock-angel (Malak Ta'us), divine worship, in which is possibly to
be seen anaspect of the ancient Iranian cult of Ahriman.1 The sacrifice of white bullocks inhonour ofthe rising and setting sun is reminiscent,
too, of the Achaemenian era.2 Ancient oriental heathen elements seem to have been overlaid with Jewish-Christian-Muslim elements, and even their secret transmission in a Kurdish idiom presents inexplicable contradictions. AsKurds they belong with their Yazidi dialect to the Iranian nation, but like many other Kurds they are Iraqi citizens. They
must have a long history, but their origins remain unknown.3
In conclusion, we must not forget that to a large extent the intellectual foundations of the secular world found their ultimate synthesis in the Iraq of the Persian empire. This synthesis enabled them to penetrate the culture ofneighbouring countries inallsubsequent ages. It was the assimilation of ancient oriental culture into the Achaemenian empire and its Iranian successor states that first gave "Babylonism" thevast world-historical perspective that is still evident on all sides. There is, forexample, the system ofmeasurement and its standardization; thedivision of the circle into 360 degrees; thedivision of a day into twelve hours; and astronomy and the calendar ingeneral. It is not for nothing that astrologers were called "Chaldaeans", for their true home was in Aramaean southern Babylon, in Uruk which, especially in the Seleucid-Parthian period, wasthecentre of ancient astronomy and interpretation ofthe stars. The latest-dated cuneiform texts include clay tablets from this place containing astronomical observations; these texts come from the 1st century A.D. The Greeks made use ofthe results anddeveloped thebasic principles further. The Persians avidly assimilated these doctrines and incorporated them in their religious system, to be finally recorded in the Pahlavl books known asthe Denkart and the Bundahisbn* Then the function of the Chaldaeans was taken over by the Magi.

peans do notnow denote theoldpriesthood of the Medes,1 but the wise men and interpreters of stars who came from the east and who figure in theNativity Gospel.2 Soit is notsurprising that thename of the great preacher ofsalvation to the Iranian nation, Zarathustra, came,in Greek ears, to have the ring of astrology about it, although it had nothing at allto do with stars; theGreek is Zajpodarprjs, which has smuggled in the word aarr\p\aoTpov " a star". Along with the astronomical cosmology of the land of the two rivers, the Persians took over also the Babylonian calendar, according to which theyear began on the first night of spring (20 March). Its most beautiful festival, Nauruz "New Day" or Navasard "New Year", was the old Babylonian new year festival onthe first of Nisan, when the god Marduk decided afresh the fate ofmankind. On Iranian soil, the Nauruz festival has continued unbroken to the present dayas the great national festival;3 and even the cheerful observance of Sizdah-bi-dar, when all the inhabitants take to the open air on the thirteenth of Farvardin in order to escape badluck, hasan ancient oriental origin. All large cities inBabylon and Assur, asthe ritual texts declare, and as archaeological discoveries confirm, owned a special new year festival house (bit akiti) outside thegates, to which, in the reawakening of springtime, everyone went, some by boat along the canals, in solemn procession led bythe priests and bearing the statues of their gods.4 The music which accompanied this event may well have been related to later music. Atall events Islamic musical terminology was based in part upon Sasanian practice, with which the Arabs came into the closest contact in Iraq. The terms forthe highest and the lowest note on stringed instruments, t(Jr and bamy are Persian, asalso are the names of the keys:ya(k)-kdh, du-kdhy si-kdh^jahdr-kdh, and inaddition, Bu^urk, Kurddn, Mdhurdn, Nawd, Rat, Zankula, etc. Some musical instruments, too, in the Islamic world, bear Iranian names: nai"flute",!^urndy

Pictorial art, carving and miniature painting have left usmany scenes featuring musicians holding banquets. Even therefined cuisine of the courtly civilization of the Sasanian empire wasadopted by the Arabs in Iraq. In theprocess charming misunderstandings were perpetrated by thesimple sons of the desert, and these were recorded, not without malicious undertones, by thePersian chroniclers. Thus theIslamic art of cooking took over along with the dishes and dainties their names as well: names likepdliidak inthe fotmfd/udhaj, a vermicelli-like strained starch pudding which under thename pdluda is still a favourite. Many of the names for fruits and vegetables, too, are Persian: bedinjdn "aubergine", tiqqi "mulberry" < tutkt, as in Kurdish.
We canaddto this several names of kitchen utensils:
Arab, tdwa "fat bowl" < Pers. tdvajtdba "frying pan", sini "porcelain", ibriq "water-jug", farfuri '' porcelain''; and in modern Iraq:
cefcir "big spoon" (NP kafgir "froth-skimmer"),
'krafes "celery" (NP kalafs, karafs), mds "vetch", tun{e)g"small clay water-bottle" (Mod. Pers. tung). Many names of measures found their way into the Aramaic of Achaemenian Iraq, andthese are preserved in modern Arabic. There are, for example: Arab, irdabbjardabb " a large measure of capacity" (almost 200 lit.), Aram, arddbd, Akk. ardabu} Old Iran. *drta-pa- " meal
chest" (jierpov MTJSLKOVOITOV > dprdfir), almost 60 lit.), Arab, qafi^ " a

On the other hand Mod. Pers. sir (nowabout 75 gm) can be traced back through an Aramaic intermediary form s{f)tr (Akkadian is-ta-tir-ru) to the Greek ararrjp (variable, about 10gm, like a shekel).
The fondness of the Persians for thefraction one-sixth may also be Mesopotamian in origin. This designation is based upon the word dangthe precise meaning of which is "part" (ddn(a)k)* butbywhich is meant in fact one-sixth. And so onesays, andwrites, too, in legal and

commercial documents, sas dang xdna "6/6 house", i.e. a complete
house, andsi dang%amin "3/6 ground" i.e. half of a plot of land. We encounter this reckoning in sixths as early as the cuneiform texts of Mesopotamia, where there are special symbols and words for it: the symbol < denotes the word sus i.e. Akkadian sussum < sudsum the "sixth"; a third « (i.e 2/6) is the dual of this (sussdn); two-thirds (4/6) is registered by "two parts" (sini'pu, sin?pat), and five-sixths is called a "large part" (parab < paras rob). We must note here, that the Sumerian words for 1/6, 2/6( = 1/3),4/6( = 2/3) and 5/6are borrowed from Akkadian, so that the method of reckoning in sixths maybe not Sumerian, but Semitic in origin.

POLITICAL CONTACTS
The geographical, historical and cultural links between Iran and the Caucasian area extend into remote antiquity. TheCaucasus rangehas been from time immemorial the barrier separating theEurasian steppe lands from more advanced civilizations centred on Mesopotamia and Anatolia. The Armenian plateau, with its mighty volcanic peaks, later imposed a formidable barrier to the westward drive of the Iranian people, once they were firmly established in their historical habitat. There is little doubt that some of the ancestors of the Iranians, like the Hittites and other Indo-European warrior aristocracies, entered Armenia from the north along the Caspian littoral, which wastobe for centuries theclassic invasion route for northern nomads attracted by thewealth and economic opportunities of the ancient Near East. During the Early Bronze Age, extending through the 3rd millennium B.C., north-western Iran formed a single cultural zone with Armenia
and southern Georgia,1 which all entered into the orbit of what is generally known as the Kuro-Araxes culture. This inturn links upwith the Khirbet-Kerak pottery culture of Palestine andSyria. The connections between the Armenian and Iranian Middle and Late Bronze Ages
are well known,2 while the Luristan bronzes are sometimes now attributed to Cimmerians who hadentered Iran byway of the Caucasus (pi. 36(*)).
During recent decades, archaeologists have devoted increasing interest to the civilization of Urartu, the mighty rival of Assyria. The kingdom of Urartu flourished in a vast region centred onLake Van in Armenia, and incorporated at one time the advanced culture ofthe

Mannians, around Lake Urmiya. Theinfluence of Urartian art and architecture onthat ofthe Medes and Persians has long been suspected. The latest in a series of scholars whohave studied this question is David Stronach, who has published a suggestive study linking the lofty Urartian tower temples with Persian Achaemenian structures known from examples at Pasargadae and Naqsh-i Rustam.1 The Urartians, incidentally, live on in the pages of Greek authors under the name " Alarodians " ; both these ethnic terms correspond to the name Ararat, traditionally given to Armenia's highest mountain, which the Armenians themselves know as Masis.
During the heyday of the Achaemenian dynasty, the Armenians and the ancestors ofthe Georgians came under the aegis ofthe Great Kings of Iran.2 Herodotus informs us of the tribute which thevarious tribes paid totheir Persian overlord, while Xenophon's Anabasis provides the classic account ofthe life ofthe Armenians and south-western Georgian tribes whom heencountered onhis toilsome march from Mesopotamia to Trebizond.
The transition from tribal-patriarchal organization to independent monarchies in both Armenia and Georgia is traditionally linked with the campaigns ofAlexander the Great, and the eventual replacement of the Achaemenian empire bythe much weaker Seleucid state.
In Armenia, the initiative inbuilding upa unified state was takenby the dynasty of the Orontids, whowere descended from the satrap Orontes who is mentioned by Xenophon.3 This Orontes was married about 401 B.C. to the Princess Rhodogune, daughter of the Persian Great King Artaxerxes II.During the fraternal strife between Artaxerxes II and his brother Cyrus the Younger, inwhich Xenophon andhis Ten Thousand played a role, Orontes took the side ofhis father-in-law Artaxerxes, thus contributing to his victory.
Artaxerxes II turned out tobe afeeble ruler, under whom the Persian empire fell into decay. Profiting by this, Orontes set himself upin Armenia as a virtually independent dynast, and became extremely wealthy, having a personal fortune of three thousand talents of silver.

In later years, Orontes turned against his father-in-law and overlord,
Artaxerxes, andled the revolt of the satraps which broke out in 366 B.C.
Eventually Orontes submitted and was pardoned; he obtained the
satrapy of Mysia and died in 344 B.C. The name Orontes is itself of Iranian origin, deriving from Avestan aurand ("mighty, hero"), and being related closely to Pahlavl arvandy with the same meaning. The local, Armenian forms of the name are Erwand, Arawan, and also Hrant. The Orontid dynasty spans thegap between the old Urartian kings (the First Monarchy in Armenia), and the Third Armenian Monarchy of the Artaxiads, in Classical times. Until recently, little was known about the offspring and successors of Orontes I, but their existence as a regular dynasty over three centuries is attested by the inscriptions on the funeral monument of King Antiochus I of Commagene (69-34 B.C.) at Nimriid Dagh in eastern Turkey (pis. 37, 38). Antiochus washimself a scion of the Orontid line, and evidently proud of his Armenian royal ancestors, many of whom he enumerates, making it possible to compile a provisional list of this most interesting dynasty:1

Under thelast Persian king of the Achaemenian dynasty, Armenia enjoyed peace and prosperity. The rulers ofIran now interfered littlein Armenian internal affairs, andtrade andagriculture flourished. This state ofthings was abruptly shattered by the invasion ofAlexander the Great ofMacedon. The battle ofArbela (Gaugamela) oni October 3 31 resulted in decisive victory forthe Macedonians and Greeks overthe last of the Achaemenians, Darius III Codomannus. Loyal tothe last, the Armenians furnished 40,000 infantry and 7,000 horsemen to the Persian Great King, under the personal command of their ownsovereign, King Orontes II. The Armenian cavalry made up the right flank of the Persian line ofbattle at Arbela. During this catastrophic defeat, Orontes II apparently lost hislife. At anyrate, Alexander the Great celebrated his victory by sending Mithranes, a son of Orontes II,tobesatrap ofArmenia in his father's stead. It isinteresting tonote that this Mithranes was a former Iranian governor ofSardis in western Asia Minor, who had defected tothe side of the Macedonians, andthus found himself ranged at the battle of Arbela onthe opposite side to his own father. Alexander theGreat died at thezenith of his power, at theage of thirty-three; but his cultural and imperial heritage lived on(pi. $6(b)). Far tothe east, inBactria, Parthia, and atmany sites inmodern Afghanistan, India andPakistan, Greek or rather Hellenistic cities grew up almost overnight. Stagnant, sleepy backwaters were revitalized,and decayed trade routes brought swiftly back into operation. Greek taste in building, sculpture and the arts, and knowledge of Greek literature and philosophy spread to out of the way corners of Anatolia and Central Asia. Greek science and technology produced rapid improvements in living standards, hygiene and sanitation, and in domestic amenities, at least forthe select few. Greek ingenuity in engineering and construc
tion left itsmark over many regions of the old Persian empire.1
Armenia, which layclose to Alexander's expansion route towards India, could notescape theimpact of the new Greco-Oriental world civilization which he helped to create. At thesame time, in this new world of Hellenism, the vestiges of the earlier world of "Iranianism" were noteffaced, nor were the elements of local advanced cultureinherited from Urartu. Armenia now found herself in close touch with a number of Hellenistic countries, and thus open to new economic and social influences. The exclusively agricultural economy and rural exis

tence of Achaemenian Armenia, where the use of coined moneywas scarcely known, were suddenly altered. The important overland route of transit trade, connecting China, India and Central Asia with the Mediterranean world, passed through Armenia, while there wasa parallel northern route through Caucasian Albania (Azarbaijan), Iberia and Colchis debouching on theBlackSea. Great cities arose along these routes, which became homes of foreign merchants andcentres of diffusion for Greek culture. The growth of a money economy and of urban life generally made for the decay of Armenia's traditional tribal-patriarchal society, andfor the emergence of new patterns of urban stratification, including thegrowth of a town bourgeoisie and artisan class, and the commercial exploitation ofslaves, though this latter institution never reached the massive proportions which it did in Greece and Rome. From the 3rd century B.C., Armenian royal authority grew more absolute, andtheadministrative machinery more complex, especially in regard to theroyal court andthe taxation and fiscal systems. Theclan chiefs and rustic headmen began to turn into a more sophisticated courtier and squire class, enjoying greater luxury andease, andaccustomed to a higher standard of living.
To appreciate Armenia's international position within the Hellenistic world, wemust take stock briefly of the general situation in the Near East and Asia Minor. After Alexander's sudden death in 323 B.C.,his generals quarrelled over the partition ofhis dominions. Ptolemy created a Greek kingdom in Egypt; Seleucus didthesame in Syria and Mesopotamia, with his capital first at Seleucia, replacing ancient Babylon, and then at Antioch ontheOrontes. Antipater conserved theold kingdom of Macedon, with its European dependencies asfaras the Black Sea and also theAdriatic, with sovereignty over thecity states in Greece.The attempts of Lysimachus to create a kingdom of the Bosphorus, with a capital on the Gallipoli peninsula, united his rivals against him, and failed at hisdeath in 281 B.C.
Hardly hadAlexander's successors established an uneasy balance of power in the Near East and Aegean region, when new disturbances burst upon the civilized world from outside. Celtic tribes from the middle Danube shattered Macedon, devastated Thrace and Phrygia, and established themselves on the Asia Minor plateau to the west of Armenia, under the name ofGalatians. Here they remained until Roman and Christian times, being the recipients of one of St Paul's epistles. Soon afterwards the Iranian-speaking people of Parthia overran the

Persian plateau and deprived the Seleucids of their possessions east of the Euphrates. The Parthians effectively separated the Seleucids of Syria, as well as the Armenians, from those eastern provinces of Alexander's realm which developed into the Greek kingdom of Bactria and also took in large regions of the Indus valley. These eastern losses led the Greco-Syrian kings of the Seleucid dynasty to seek compensation at theexpense of Egypt to the south, and of Armenia and other independent states of Asia Minor to the north.
During the Seleucid period, Armenia became divided into several virtually independent kingdoms and principalities. The classification adopted at this epoch persisted, with certain changes, well into the Byzantine era.1 The most important region, of course, was Greater Armenia, situated east ofthe upper Euphrates, and including vast areas all round Lake Van, along the Araxes valley, and northwards to take in Lake Sevan, the Karabagh, and even the southern marches of Georgia. Lesser Armenia, on the other hand, was a smaller and less fertile kingdom, to thewest of the upper Euphrates; it included the present-day districts of Sivas and Erzinjan, andbordered on ancient Cappadocia. To the south-west lay the two little kingdoms of Sophene and Commagene, separated from one another bythe middle Euphrates, and having the fertile and desirable Melitene (Malatya) plain running between them. Sophene andCommagene often featured as buffer states between Parthia andArmenia on theone hand, andSyria andRome on the other. Their royal houses had strong dynastic links with the Armenian Orontid house. Through their proximity to such great cities as Antioch and Palmyra, the kingdoms of Sophene and Commagene early became great centres of Hellenistic and then of Roman art and civilization, which they in turn helped to transmit eastwards into Greater Armenia and Transcaucasia.
The Seleucid kings never succeeded in asserting direct rule over Armenia proper. They collected tribute from local Armenian princes, whom they used to confirm in office by granting them the title of "strategos", corresponding to theoldPersian viceregal title of satrap. This situation changed somewhat under the Seleucid King Antiochus III, known as the Great (223-187 B.C.), an ambitious monarch who cherished dreams of restoring the empire of Alexander theGreat.The Armenian King Xerxes rashly declined to pay tribute to Antiochus, who besieged him in hiscapital of Arsamosata and forced him to sub

mit. Xerxes then received the sister of Antiochus in marriage. This lady, Antiochis by name, soon had the unfortunate Xerxes, her spouse, murdered, and united the Armenian kingdom ofSophene tothe dominions of Antiochus III, her brother. The ill-fated King Xerxes has left some small coins bearing his portrait. We see onthem a dignified, bearded, somewhat donnish-looking figure, wearing a pointed hat or tiara of unusual shape, with a peak in front and a streamer or tassels floating down the back. He has athoughtful expression on his face, as ifwondering how to cope with the political and marital troubles which eventually proved too much forhim. Antiochus III appointed a scion ofthe Armenian Orontids, Zariadris (Zareh) to bestrategos of Sophene in 200 B.C. Atthis time, in Greater Armenia, thepower of the main Orontid dynasty was drawing toa close. The last ruler ofthis line was Orontes IV (212-200 B.C.). Bothhe and hisbrother Mithras, High Priest of the Temple of the Sun and Moon at the city ofArmavir, are mentioned in Greek inscriptions discovered there in 1927. One inscription contains an address of High Priest Mithras to his brother King Orontes; another evidently alludes
to theking's tragic death.1 This event was theresult of the uprising headed bya local dynast called Artaxias, and evidently instigated from Syria by King Antiochus III. Following this coup, Antiochus appointed Artaxias tobe the strategos ofGreater Armenia inplace ofthe dead Orontes.
Artaxias was the founder of the Third and greatest Armenian monarchy, counting theUrartian kingdom founded by Arame as the first, as does Moses of Khorene, and the Orontids as the second. The name Artaxias is the equivalent of the Persian Artaxerxes,and the Armenian Artashes. The table opposite showing the basic sequence of the Artaxiad line is based on the researches of the French numismatist
Henri Seyrig.2 For a decade after being installed byAntiochus III, from 200 to 190 B.C., Artaxias and his junior partner, Zariadris of Sophene, bided their time. Ultimately, Antiochus overreached himself by challenging the mighty Roman Republic to atrial of strength. No sooner had Antiochus sustained at Magnesia his great defeat at the hands of the Romans (190 B.C.) than Artaxias and Zariadris seceded from the Seleucid state.

In the Peace of Apamea (188 B.C.), which sealed the Roman victory, the Senate in Rome granted them the status of independent rulers. This was Armenia's first juridical contact with the Roman Senate, which was glad to acquire two grateful allies in that strategic part of the world pending completion of the usual preliminaries to swallow them up and annex their lands to the Roman Republic itself.
Under this new-found Roman patronage, the two Armenian kingdoms of Greater Armenia and Sophene pursued a lively expansionist policy. From the Medes and Persians, Artaxias took Media Atropatena, the modern Azarbaljan, extending virtually to the banks of the Caspian Sea. From the Georgians he seized a broad slice of territory to the north-west of Lake Sevan. From the Chalybes, Mossynoeci andTaokhoi, the Armenians took much of the upland plateau round Erzerum, and some of the wild mountain country of the Pontic Alps. Theprovince of Taron, round about the town of Mush, was cleared of remaining Seleucid garrisons.

One important result of this territorial growth was thecultural and linguistic consolidation of the Armenian people. Except forthe Georgian marches, andfor a few remote tribal districts, such as Sassoun, Armenian became the dominant spoken language ofthe peasant masses, the hunters andtribesmen, andthe townspeople, except for those of Jewish and Greek birth. The Greek geographer Strabo (58 B.C.-A.D. 25) lays special stress on this result of the conquests of Artaxias and Zariadris: "Thanks to their work of unification", he says, "all the inhabitants ofthese various districts to-day speak the same language."1 It must be remembered, however, that prior to the invention of the Armenian national alphabet after A.D. 400,all works of literature, religious texts, and government decrees, were written down and transmitted in Iranian written in Aramaic characters, or else in Greek.The Armenian royal family and aristocracy were bilingual, speaking Greek or Iranian aswell asArmenian - rather like the Russian Court prior to the 1917Revolution, where English and French were spoken in preference to Russian.
Like the Orontid monarchy in Armenia, the kingdom of Iberia or eastern Georgia has its origins in the era of Alexander the Great. Although Alexander never invaded Georgia or the Caucasus, heis credited throughout the region with all manner ofbuildings and mighty feats. According to theGeorgian Annals Kartlis tskhovreba ("The Life of Georgia"), Alexander entrusted theadministration of Georgia toa relative of his by thename of Azon (very likely a confusion with the name Jason, ofArgonaut fame), who proved such a tyrant as to alienate not only theGeorgians, buteven theGreeks whom he had brought with him.
The oppressed Georgians then revolted under the lead of Parnavaz, a descendant of Kartlos, eponymous ancestor of the Kartvelian or Georgian nation, after whom Sakartvelo, land of the Georgians, is named. This Parnavaz wasa nephew of Samara, patriarch or tribal leader of the Iberians of Mtskheta; with the help of King Kuji of Colchis, Parnavaz drove out Azon and his Greek mercenaries, and was recognized by theKings of Syria andArmenia as legitimate ruler of Iberia.
Parnavaz reorganized the army of the Kartlosids and appointed seven or eight eristavh or "heads of the people", to one of whom he accorded the Iranian title of spaspet or commander-in-chief. These

officers were each assigned oneprovince of Georgia to govern, the spaspet being responsible for thecentral area of Inner Kartli, around Mtskheta and Uplistsikhe. It seems that this office ofspaspet was in fact occupied by the member ofthe Iberian royal family next inseniority to the king: Strabo states that inthe royal hierarchy ofIberia "the second in line administers justice and commands the army".1 It isalso possible to equate these high dignitaries with the viceroys of Iberia, whose hereditary necropolis was uncovered in Mtskheta-Armazi, together with engraved gems bearing portraits of two of them, Zevakh and Asparukh.2 The difficulty is that these viceroys of Mtskheta bore the Iranian title oi pitiakhsh or vitaxa, roughly approximating to that of satrap, and suggesting that they were officials appointed by the Persians to supervise the Iberian kings.3 No doubt the Persian Great Kings appointed such officials whenever they were strong enough to impose their will onthe Georgians, but at other times, we must conclude that the vitaxae were in fact deputy monarchs, with the duties of a High Constable. This latter interpretation is supported by the bilingual epitaph ofa Georgian princess named Serapita, inscribed in Greek and an unusual form of Aramaic which has been called theArmazi script. Deciphered andpublished by Professor Giorgi Tsereteli, theepitaph runs:
I amSerapita, daughter of Zevakh theyounger, pitiakhsh of Farsmanthe king, andwife of Iodmangan thevictorious, winner of many conquests, master ofthe court ofKsefarnug, the great king ofthe Iberians, and sonof Agrippa, master of the court of King Farsman. Woe, woe, for the sakeof her who was not offull age, whose years were not completed, and sogood and beautiful that noone was like her inexcellence; and she died atthe age
of twenty-one.4
This inscription makes it abundantly clear that, during the 2nd century A.D. at least, the vitaxa ofIberia was noforeign official, but a high dignitary of the royal court, allied bymarriage with the highest aristocrats in the Georgian land. The political history ofIran during the Parthian and Sasanian periods is scarcely intelligible without reference to Armenia and Georgia.

Eupator of Pontus (113-63 B.C.), wasto a great extent a Caucasian dynast, being ruler of Colchis or Western Georgia, and the land of the Laz, around Trebizond. Hisson-in-law, King Tigranes theGreat of Armenia (95-5 5 B.C.) spent some years asa hostage atthe court of King Mithradates II of Parthia. When at the summit of his power, Tigranes had four vassal kings, including theruler of Atropatene (Azarbaljan) attending him like slaves wherever he went.1
At one time, thedomains of Tigranes theGreat stretched from the shores of the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean, from Mesopotamia upto the Pontic Alps. The vast empire, formed ofa varied mixture ofdiverse tribes, with their own dialects and cultures, could hardly be turned overnight into a cohesive and durable political structure. Inner disunity aided the designs of the Romans, who launched a series of onslaughts on theArmenian dynast, beginning with theinvasion by Lucullus in 69-68 B . C , and culminating in the campaigns of Pompey in Armenia, Iberia andColchis in 66-65 B-c-The downfall of Tigranes the Great was precipitated bythe flight of his son, Tigranes the Younger, to the court ofthe Parthian king Phraates III, who supplied him with an army with which to invade Armenia, and join forces with the victorious Romans.
This debacle was typical of the situation of Armenia, and to a lesser extent, Georgia, inthe succeeding centuries, when Transcaucasia was a bone of contention between the twowarring empires of Rome and Iran. Rome's interests were best served when Armenia was courted and reinforced as abuffer state. Spasmodic Roman attempts to annex and assimilate Armenia and Georgia led in the long run to disastrous confrontations with the mobile and warlike Parthians and Sasanians, whom the Romans were seldom able to beat in open combat.
There is no space here to chronicle the vicissitudes of the wars between Rome and Parthia, and later between Byzantium and Sasanian Iran, over Armenia's largely defenceless territory. Lucullus and Pompey, Crassus and Mark Anthony, Corbulo and Trajan, are but a few of the Roman leaders who campaigned inthis region with varying degrees of success or disastrous failure. One unforgettable moment in these bloodthirsty, and inthe long run, fruitless wars occurred after the battle of Carrhae in 53 B.C, inwhich Crassus and his legions were completely wiped out. The Armenian king Artavazd had urged Crassus to attack Parthia by way ofthe Armenian highlands, but Crassus had ignored his advice. Artavazd, thus rebuffed, allied himself with theParthian king

Orodes II,and was entertaining him at theArmenian capital, Artaxata, when a messenger arrived carrying the head of the unhappy Roman general. Artavazd, though in close personal and political touch withthe Parthians, was so well versed in Greek literature that he composed plays inGreek, which were acted atthe Armenian court. When the head of Crassus wasbrought in, a performance of theBacchae by Euripides was taking place, in honour of the king of Parthia. The head of Crassus was thrown down into the midst of the assembled company, and the leading actor picked it up anddanced round in a bacchanalian frenzy, crying:
"We've hunted down a mighty chase today, And from the mountain bring the noble prey!"*
Such were the hybrid manners and culture of an Armenia divided between thesophisticated Western influences of Greek andRome,and the virile eastern world of Parthia. A new chapter opened in Armenian history when the Parthian Arsacid prince Tiridates was crowned king ofArmenia bythe Emperor Nero in A.D. 66.From then on, the destinies of Armenia were closely linked with those of the Parthian royal house of the Arsacids. Indeed, during the ist and 2ndcenturies A.D., theArmenian throne was regularly reserved for the Parthian Great King's nearest kin, who was known as "Great King of Armenia" - rather as the heir apparent to the British throne is called thePrince of Wales. This custom, political conditions allowing, continued into early Sasanian times: thus prior to 293, the future Great King Narseh wasviceroy of Armenia with the title of Va^urg Armendn Shah ("Great King of Armenia").2

When the Parthians were overthrown bythe Sasanians in A.D. 226, the old Armenian royal house became redoubtable foes of the new Great Kings of Iran. The Armenian Arsacids remained, as they claimed, the champions ofIranian legitimacy. This helps toexplain the singular bitterness ofthe relations between Arsacid Armenia and Sasanian Iran, extending right up to and even after theabolition of the Armenian Arsacid dynasty in 428. We are further confronted with thesingular spectacle of a Parthian king, Tiridates III, whose forbear, Tiridates I, was a Magian who was forbidden to defile the sea by sailing toRomein a boat, being the first ruler of a substantial kingdom to embrace Christianity as thestate religion (traditionally, in A.D. 301). We even have a dynasty ofPatriarchs ofthe Armenian Church, descending from the Parthian nobleman who became StGregory the Illuminator, being proudly remembered by the Armenian Church to this dayby the surname Partev, the Parthian.1
To be fair to the Sasanians, itmust be borne in mind that weakness of Iranian control over Armenia directly contributed to the ignominious defeats which the declining Parthian realm had suffered atthe handsof Rome at the end ofthe 2nd century. The Romans had exploited their dominance in Syria and Armenia to stage a series of aggressive raids against the nerve centres of Parthian royal power. To seal off this

Roman military corridor was one of the prime and fully justified aims of Great King Ardashlr Papakan, who spent the year 230 ina whole series of campaigns against Roman Mesopotamia, Cappadocia, Mediaand Armenia. The Armenians, however, putup a spirited resistance, and succeeded in beating offthe Persian offensive. The resurgence of Iranian power gathered momentum under Ardashir's son Shapur I (241-72). In 244, the Roman army of Emperor Gordian III was decisively beaten at Meshik, near Ctesiphon, where Gordian lost his life. The new emperor, Philip the Arab, was forced to cede suzerain rights over Armenia to thePersian Great King. Eight years later, in 252, Shapur invaded Armenia, forcing King Tiridates II of the Arsacid line to flee to theRoman Empire, while his sons went
over to the Persians.1 Shapur's culminating triumph, inthe defeat and capture of the Emperor Valerian in 260, was full of import for the future destinies ofArmenia and also of the Georgian lands. Many controversial points remain to be cleared up in thepolitical history ofArmenia during the 3rd and early 4th centuries. For this important period, the Armenian national sources are inextricably mingled with semi-legendary elements, while Roman authors tend to be extremely laconic in regard to Armenian affairs. All the more interest attaches to the well-known inscriptions ofShapur I and his high priest, the Magus Kartir, onthe Ka'ba-yi Zardusht at Naqsh-i Rustam. From Kartir's inscription, we learn ofthe efforts ofthe Zoroastrian hierarchy to stamp out idolatry and other heresies throughout the Persian empire,
and to impose orthodox beliefs and the pure Avestan ritual.2 With its sophisticated syncretistic religious traditions, Armenia must have been a prime target for thezeal of Kartir and hisacolytes. This religious offensive was itself made possible bythe military successes of Shapur, commemorated in his own inscription on the Ka'ba-yi Zardusht, where he asserts his suzerainty over Armenia. The inscription of Kartir alludes to an Iranian invasion of Caucasian Iberia and Albania some time after 260. The inscription of Shapur numbers Iberia and Albania among his vassal states, andreveals theexistence of a puppet ruler,
Hamazasp, installed byhim in Iberia.3
Likewise of prime importance forthe history of Armenia is theinscription ofPaikuli. Published byHerzfeld in 1924, this document has

been alltoo seldom utilized in Armenian historical scholarship.1 The value ofthe Paikuli inscription for Armenian history lies inthe reliable chronological framework which it affords forevents leading upto the accession ofNarses asGreat King ofIran (293), asalso initsmention of a certain "Tirdat the King" among the monarchs who offered Narses, theformer Viceroy of Armenia, their congratulations on his
triumph.2 Whether this Tirdat is tobe identified with the first Christian king ofArmenia, orwhether he isan earlier king with the same name,
remains a moot point.3

The situation in Georgia at this period was somewhat different from that prevailing in Armenia. The Romans, andlater, theByzantines, exploited their naval supremacy inthe Black Sea to maintain garrisons and trading points atstrategic localities inAbkhazia, Colchis and Lazistan. The local western Georgian population was ruled by petty princes and clan leaders, until the emergence of a strong dynasty in Lazica in the 6th century. In eastern Georgia (Iberia), our knowledge of the dynastic history of the powerful kings of Mtskheta-Armazi is incomplete, in spite of the noteworthy researches of Professor Cyril Tou
manoff.4 It seems that at some time in the eighties of the 2nd century A.D., the last Iberian king ofthe Third Parnabazid dynasty, Amazaspes or Hamazasp II,was replaced by his sister's son, Rev, son ofthe king of Armenia. There then existed forover a century anArsacid or Parthian dynasty in eastern Georgia, allied by blood to the Armenian Arsacids. These Iberian Arsacids became extinct in the4th century, when theIberian throne passed to King Mirian III, subsequently St Mirian, the first Christian king of Iberia. The dynasty which he founded is called that of the Chosroids: they were a branch of the Iranian Mihranids, one of the Seven Great Houses of the Sasanian Empire.
The adoption ofChristianity by the Armenians and Georgians wasto some extent a political move, designed toplace the country within the orbit of Greco-Syrian civilization, and to resist cultural and religious assimilation by the Persians.

is a sad chronicle ofdeportations, forced conversions and cruel martyrdoms. In 365 Shapur II systematically sacked and destroyed every major town in Armenia, deporting the inhabitants, who included alarge number of Jews. Byhisedict of 449, Yazdgard II sought to impose Zoroastrianism upon Armenia and Georgia. This provoked vigorous resistance. At the battle of Avarair on 2 June 451, sixty-six thousand Armenians under thenational hero, Prince Vardan Mamikonian, encountered an army of two hundred and twenty thousand Persians. Vardan and many thousands of his followers perished on thebattlefield, and the death ofthese martyrs iscommemorated tothis day inthe
Armenian calendar on Shrove Thursday.1 Resistance to the Persians continued in Georgia under the semi-legendary King Vakhtang Gorgaslan (c. 446-510), whose name means "thewolf-lion". After Vakhtang Gorgaslan's death, Georgia too was reduced to becoming a province of the Persian state. The extinction of royal power in Iberia left a vacuum in thelocal power structure of the Georgian lands. This gap was filled now by a resurgent monarchy in western Georgia, where royal power had been in abeyance since the days ofMithradates Eupator ofPontus, the foe of Pompey and the Romans. The new kingdom included that of ancient Colchis, land of the Golden Fleece, and much of Pontus itself; it was called Lazica, being under the leadership ofthe Laz tribes ofthe Black Sea coast. In 523 King Tsate of Lazica was baptized andinstalled a Byzantine garrison inthe mighty fortress ofPetra (Tsikhis-dziri) overlooking the Black Sea north ofBatumi; the site has been excavatedby the Batumi Research Institute, under its director, Asian Inaishvili.
Throughout the reign ofJustinian (527-65) and that of his adversary, Khusrau I Anushirvan (531-79), the Persians and the Byzantines fought for control ofLazica, aswell as ofupland Svaneti. The Lazic kings did their best to play offthe Persians and Byzantines against one another. They had little reason to prefer the Christian Greeks to thePersians, since agents of Justinian even assassinated the Lazic king Gubaz II in 553. These wars arechronicled in detail by Procopius andhis continuator Agathias of Myrina, who provide valuable data on Persian operations in the Caucasus, as well as almost verbatim reports of
speeches and dialogues, which bring the period vividly to life.2

Byzantine expansion was resumed by the Emperor Maurice (582602). Maurice is supposed to have been a simple Armenian peasant, who made his way toConstantinople on foot, and there worked his way up to the supreme dignity. A stone obelisk marking his home is shown to visitors in the Armenian village of Oshakan, close to thememorial chapel of St Mesrop Mashtotz, who invented theArmenian alphabet. However, the treatment meted out by Maurice to the Armenians generally was notvery liberal. In 591, he signed a peace treaty with Persia, which advanced the Byzantine frontier roughly to the line between lakes Vanand Sevan, with Dvin (pi. 4i(£)) in the reduced Iranian part.1 Finding theArmenians troublesome in their homeland, Maurice conceived a plan to co-operate with theGreat King of Iran in removing all the main Armenian nobles andtheir followers from their homes.
According tothe Armenian chronicler Sebeos, Maurice wrote to the Persian Great King.
The Armenians are a knavish and indocile nation. They are situated between us and are a source oftrouble. I am going to gather mine and send them to

Thrace; you send yours to theEast. If they diethere, it will be so many enemies that will die. If, on the contrary, they kill, itwill be so many enemies that they will kill. Asfor us, we shall live in peace. But if they remain in
their country, there will never beany quiet forus.1
The tworulers apparently agreed to carry out this plan, but the Persians failed tocollaborate fully. When the Byzantines began to carry out the deportation order, many Armenians fled to Persia, which they now found less tyrannical than Christian Byzantium.
The successes ofthe Emperor Maurice emboldened the Georgians to reassert their independence under Byzantine protection. TheIberian princes Guaram and Stephen I and II took the unusual step of issuing coins modelled onthe silver drachms of Hormizd IVofIran (579-90), but embodying various independent elements in the design, beginning
with the addition ofthe initials ofthe respective Georgian princes, and
o
culminating in the substitution of the Christian Cross for the sacred flame normally portrayed on the Zoroastrian fire-altar on the coin's reverse.2 This was, ofcourse, a political act ofthe first magnitude, and points to the efforts of Duke Stephen I of Iberia between 5 90 and 607 to re-establish the political autonomy ofeastern Georgia, and strengthen the Christian faith. This Duke Stephen I, who received the Byzantine title ofPatrikios (Patrician) isportrayed on one ofthe sculptures on the eastern facade ofthe church ofJvari ("the Cross") ona high hill overlooking the Kura valley near Mtskheta (pi. 40). Itwas inDuke Stephen's time also that theGeorgian Church finally broke with the Gregorian Church ofArmenia, and was reunited with that oforthodox Byzantium. The reign of Khusrau II Parvez (590-628) was marked by violent fluctuations in the balance ofpower inthe Near East. The assassination of Emperor Maurice in 602 enabled the Persians to ravage Syria, capture Antioch and Damascus, and in614, toraid Jerusalem and carry off the relic of the Holy Cross. The Emperor Heraclius (610-41) staged a counter-attack andinvaded Armenia, Georgia andAzarbaijan. With the aidof a Khazar khan named Jibghu, Heraclius captured Tiflis. A contingent of Armenian troops led by Mjej Gnuni wasalso largely instrumental inthe success of these campaigns, which culminated in628 in the overthrow and murder of Khusrau himself. The triumph of Heraclius and hisArmenian and Khazar auxiliaries proved irrelevant to the long-term evolution of Christian Caucasia. Under the Prophet Muhammad, the Arabs were already on the move to

world dominance. Weakened by twocenturies of religious schism, Byzantium was in nostate to resist their advance, while the Sasanian empire was also in a decayed and precarious state. The caliphate of 'Umar (634-44) saw Islam's transformation from a religious sect to an imperial power, and the subjugation ofboth Iran and Armenia to the heirs of Muhammad. At thedecisive battle on theRiver Yarmuk, a tributary of the Jordan, in August 636, the Byzantine commander-inchief was an Armenian named Vahan or Baanes. Shortly before the battle, Vahan was actually proclaimed emperor by his troops.The catastrophic defeat of his forces put an end to Vahan's imperial dreams, and he later retired to Sinai and became a monk. Within a decade, the Arabs had overthrown the Sasanians and subjugated Armenia andGeorgia also. Arab amirs satin Dvinand Tiflis, and a new era had opened forthe Caucasian peoples.
SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS CONTACTS
So far,wehave concentrated on providing a concise, perhaps oversimplified historical outline, without which it would be difficult to grasp the pattern ofpolitical and dynastic cross-currents between Iran and the Armenian and Georgian peoples. However, this isonly part of the story. Even more interesting, and certainly more durable, were the social, cultural and religious influences which connected the Iranian nation with its smaller north-western neighbours during the millennium under review. Indeed, there is good reason to assert that the Armenians, equally with the Parsees, rank as the true spiritual heirs ofParthian and Sasanian civilization. But forthe records ofthe Armenian chroniclers of the 6th and subsequent centuries, such as Faustus of Buzanda and Sebeos, weshould be hard putto it to reconstruct thechronological outline of events in Iran and neighbouring lands of the Near
East.1 There are many references among the writers of antiquity to similarities of dress and manners between the Armenians and the Medes, Persians and Parthians. That excellent authority Strabo, while adhering to his unlikely story that the ancestor ofthe Armenians was a certain Thessalian called Armenus, who accompanied Jason and the Argonauts to Colchis, also lays stress on the points of outward resemblance
1 Similarly, it would be hard to overestimate thevalue of the Paikuli inscription of Great King Narses for the chronology of late 3rd-century Armenia. In addition to Herzfeld's original publication, see Henning, "A. Farewell to the Khagan", pp. 517-22, and ToumanofT, "The Third-Century Armenian Arsacids", pp. 261-75.



CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS CONTACTS
between the Armenians and the Medes. Speaking ofthe Medes, Strabo
remarks:
As forcustoms, most oftheirs and ofthose ofthe Armenians are the same, because their countries aresimilar. The Medes, however, aresaid to have been theoriginators of customs for theArmenians, andalso, still earlier, for the Persians, who were their masters and their successors inthe supreme authority over Asia. For example, their "Persian" stola(robe), asit is now called, and their zeal forarchery and horsemanship, and the court they pay to their kings, and their ornaments, and the divine reverence paid by subjects to kings, came to the Persians from the Medes. And that this istrue isparticularly clear from their dress; for tiara, citaris (head-dress),pilus(skull-cap), tunics with sleeves reaching to the hands, and trousers, are indeed suitable things to wear in cold and northerly regions, such asthe Medes wear,but
by nomeans in southerly regions.1
The similarity of costume remarked on by Strabo is confirmed by evidence ofancient Armenian and Parthian sculpture, and especiallyby coins, showing Armenian rulers wearing the famous Armenian pointed tiara, which is also paralleled in Median models (cf. pis. 37(tf), 39(^))Reference to the divine reverence paid to kings is interesting, since both Tigranes theGreat of Armenia andhissonArtavazd laid claim to the title "theos", which is occasionally inscribed on their silver coinage.
Strabo also remarks on parallels between the wayof life of the Armenians and Medes, and that ofthe Iberians ofthe less mountainous regions of Eastern Georgia:
Now the plain of the Iberians is inhabited by people who are rather inclined to farming and to peace, andthey dress after both theArmenian and the Median fashion; but the major, or warlike, portion occupy the mountainous territory, living like theScythians andSarmatians, of whom they are both neighbours and kinsmen; however, they engage also in
farming.2
Nowhere is this Iranian influence seen more clearly than inthe many linguistic borrowings from Median, OldPersian and Parthian, which exist inthe Armenian language, and toa much less extent, in Georgian, even today. Many numerals andnames of basic necessities of life in Armenian are Middle Iranian, showing conclusively that the linguistic influences were not confined toa narrow aristocratic section ofsociety.3

IRAN, ARMENIA AND GEORGIA
Armenian personal names are very largely Iranian inorigin, and predominantly Parthian. This will have become clear from the many names of kings and prominent personages cited earlier in this chapter. Frequently the names are compounds ofnames ofIranian gods - the most common being of course Mithradates and Tiridates. (Tirwas the Armenian counterpart of Mercury and Hermes.) The Armenian mother goddess, Anahit, also revered inParthia, lives ontoday inthe popular Armenian Christian name Anahit. Common Armenian names of Parthian origin include Tigran, Vahram, Suren, Babken, Khoren and Arshak. TheSupreme Catholicos of All theArmenians since 1955, Vazken I, bears a name which goes back to Parthian times. It is also interesting to note that in 8th- and 9th-century Constantinople, when groups ofambitious Armenians were inthe habit ofseizing the throne for shorter or longer periods, they nearly always bore ancient Armenian names of the Parthian era: a Bardanes or Vardan was actually Emperor from 711 to713, while other leading Byzantine generals and politicians included a Tiridates, several more Vardans, three individuals named Artavasdos, and even one Ardashir.1
With regard toproper names, the situation inGeorgia ismore complicated, partly as a result ofthe Greek and Roman settlements around the Black Sea coastline. As a result, Georgian personal names both in ancient and in modern times are a fascinating amalgam of local,indigenous ones, mingled with Classical, Biblical, Byzantine, Persian, and more recently, Russian, French andeven English ones. During the period under review, a number ofParthian and Sasanian names feature in the annals of Georgia, such asVaraz-Bakur, Parnavaz, Mihran and Farsman (Farasmanes), also Mihrandukht and Bakurdukht. Alongside these weencounter other Iranian names like Artag, Ksefarnug and Asparukh, which have more incommon with the Iranian steppe world of the Scythians and Alans, which extended down into North Caucasia. Asparukh was one of the prominent viceroys (pitiakhsh) of Iberia about A.D. 200: itis interesting to find this name cropping up later as that of a famous Sublime Khan of the Bulgars, who migrated from the North Caucasus inthe 7th century and invaded the Balkans inthe reign of the Emperor Constantine IV (A.D. 680-81).2
Unlike theArmenians, the Georgians later became very fond of Iranian romance andepic literature; translations of Firdausl's Shdh

ndma and of Gurgani's Vis and Rdmin make their appearance in later medieval times, while the Georgians were close neighbours of Nizami Ganjavi (1140-1209). As a result, another wave of linguistic borrowings, including proper names, occurs during the Georgian Golden Age associated with the reign of Queen Tamar (1184-1213). The glories of the Sasanian era, and of Persian romantic literature, are conjured up in such popular Georgian names as Rostom, Kaikhosro and Vakhtang, also Leila and Nestan-Darejan.
The political systems of Armenia and Georgia had much in common with the great monarchies of Iran. Considering that the Arsacids of
527



IRAN, ARMENIA AND GEORGIA
Armenia were Parthian princes, and the Mihranids, Chosroids and Guaramids of Iberia all closely connected with oneor other of the Seven Great Houses ofIran, this was only tobe expected. The connection with Parthia does much toexplain the early transition in Armenia from a partly tribal andpatriarchal, partly slave-owning socialand economic system, to one of full-fledged feudal relations. If the system of Tigranes the Great was one of Oriental despotism onthe Seleucid model, the Arsacids arealready recognizable as forerunners of feudal monarchs of medieval times. The same can be said of the Mihranid (Chosroid) kings of Iberia, about whose political and social arrange
ments, a number ofearly hagiographical works give useful data.1 Virtually alltheattributes of medieval European feudalism can be found in Parthia, Armenia and Iberia. Allodium and fiefs, investiture and homage, immunity and vassalage, allthese familiar concepts have their Parthian and Caucasian counterparts. Feudalism in its most flourishing age was, of course, anything butsystematic, andit is an institution very difficult to define. However, certain fundamental principles have been distinguished by medieval historians, andthese apply quite well to both Parthia and to Armenia and Georgia. These include: the relation ofvassal and lord; the principle that every holder of land isa tenant and not an owner, until the highest rank isreached sometimes the concept even rules in that rank also; that the tenureby which athing or estate of value is held is one of honourable service, not primarily economic, but moral and political incharacter; the principle of mutual obligations of loyalty, protection and service binding together all the ranks ofthis society from the highest to the lowest; and the principle of contract between lord and tenant, as determining all rights, controlling their modification, and forming thefoundation of law.
Naturally, there are other, conflicting trends at work even in the most typical feudal societies. The king would tend to group around himself apersonal corps ofretainers, bodyguards and officials, with the aid ofwhom he would try tocontrol, and even remove, unsatisfactory vassals. Then again, holders of great feudal estates and offices invariably aimed to hand down their possessions and dignities to their offspring, sothat a network ofdynastic aristocracy would grow up.In Armenia and Iran, great noble houses would tend to monopolize offices of state, sothat the Bagratids, forinstance, were the hereditary coronants ofthe Arsacid kings.

Feudalism would often come toan end, permanently or temporarily, when kings such as Henry VII, Louis XI, orIvan the Terrible, builtup a burgher and bureaucratic class, and a royal standing army, and were in a position to impose their dictates ona cowed aristocracy. A comparable situation seems to have existed in Iran at some phases of the Sasanian monarchy, whenever theGreat Kings felt strong enough to override the local princes andvassal tribal leaders. In Armeniaand Georgia, theopposite trend predominated. First in Armenia, in A.D. 428, and later in Iberia, around A.D. 530, thefeudal princes took the initiative in petitioning the Great King ofIran to abolish the monarchy, in the mistaken hope that this would leave the local aristocracy free to manage their own affairs undisturbed. Ineffect, aswe know, the abolition of these monarchies simply led to the appointment of Iranian man^pdnsor governors-general, sothat the latter state was worse than the first. We owe toProfessor Cyril Toumanoffa singularly full description of the various grades of Armenian and Georgian feudal aristocracyprinces, dukes, margraves, knights, gentry, and so forth - also of the high offices of state which were usually assigned exclusively to members
of the great houses.1 Soviet historians, notably Professor S. T. Eremian, have been active in analysing the social status and economic condition of the Armenian peasantry (shinakank)> and of the trading, artisan and working class generally (ramkk). For what it is worth, Moses of Khorene gives asketch of the Armenian state, as organized on Parthian lines bythe first Arsacid ruler Tiridates I, shortly after A.D. 60. Posts about the royal person, and the important positions of master of the royal hunts, chamberlain, head ofsacrifices, grand falconer, guardian of the summer residences, and so forth, were distributed among the members ofthe great families. Fiefs were granted to Tiridates' vassals, and four territorial Wardens of the Marches were appointed, oneto the region at each cardinal point ofthe compass. (These Wardens bore the title of bdeashkh) and arenodoubt successors of the four client kings who attended onTigranes the Great.) The army was divided intothe standing frontier garrisons, andthefeudal levies summoned only in time ofwar. Local justices were appointed fortown and country, and
times forroyal audiences, and also public entertainments, were fixed.2
The Sasanians destroyed most of the official records of the Parthians; the Arabs destroyed most ofthe archives ofthe Sasanian kings. In view of the close connection between Armenia and Iran, and the

early date - 5 th century A.D. onwards - ofthe beginnings of Armenian historiography, theaccounts of the classical Armenian historians of political events and social relations in Iran generally, and in Armenia specifically, acquire enhanced value and interest. Inhis monograph on Iranian feudalism, Professor Widengren had the happy idea of grouping together a selection of extracts from the classical Armenian historians bearing on feudal relationships, alongside passages from Iranian sources such asthe Kdrndmak 1 Artakhsher 1 Pdpakdn.l Without going into technicalities, it may be worth citing verbatim a few key passages from the early Armenian historians relating to feudal relations in Armenia, which also have bearing on political and social relationships in contemporary Iran. Widengren also makes the interesting point that the Iranian word pasdmk, which stems from Sasanian times, and signifies an armed guard orretainer, also occurs inGeorgian, inthe form pasanikiy ormore commonly, pasenaki.2
Among the many texts illustrating feudal relations and institutionsin ancient Armenia and Parthia, the following present special interest: 1. King Pap (369-74) suspects the sparapetor generalissimo Mushegh Mamikonian of disloyalty: "Then placing his hand in that of King Pap, Mushegh swore fealty to him, saying: 'I shall live and die foryou, as my ancestors have done foryour ancestors, asmy father has donefor your father King Arshak, thus will I do for you also, only do not lend ear to my slanderers.'"3
2. King Tiridates orders Mamgon, ancestor of the Mamikonian Princes, to exterminate therebellious family of Selkuni: "Mamgon hastened to inform theking of the success of his mission. Tiridates, filled with joy, immediately wrote forhim a royal charter [hrovartak, from Parthian fravartak], granting him suzerainty over all thelands which he hadpromised him; and the king appointed him prince [nakbarar] in place of the rebel, calling the fief after his name: Mamgonian."4
3. King Arshak II (3 51-67) tries to weaken the feudal nobility: "And he slew many nakharars.From several he removed their hereditary fiefs, and he confiscated several princely domains for thecrown. But the

[ostan]."1
4. While the Armenian kings could sometimes confiscate the domains and fiefs of the leading princes, they were often powerless to deprive them of hereditary feudal offices. The following incident relates to thereign of King Varazdat (374-80) when Manuel Mamikonian comes back from long captivity in Iran: "But when Manuel had returned to the glory ofhis princely estate, without any prior authorization from King Varazdat, he took over the position of sparapet or generalissimo, because this was something which had come down to him from his ancestors in direct succession. However, King Varazdat
had granted the title tohis own foster-father Bat as a mark of favour."2 As we have seen, the history ofArmenia and ancient Georgia is one of ceaseless tensions between the monarchy andthefeudal nobility, though the sentiment ofaristocratic pride was often combined with one of touching loyalty to the king. The prowess ofthe princes and ofthe nobles was inherent in a knightly society, spending much of its time heavily armoured upon horseback, in warfare or in hunting. The Iberian crown of Eastern Georgia appears to have been stronger than the Armenian in relation to thedynastic aristocracy. In Georgia,the feudal office of duke {eristavi^ or "head of the people") was not extended to allof the princes, only a few more powerful ones becoming dukes of the provinces of Iberia. However, neither the Iberian nor the Armenian monarchy could survive the dual strain of feudal disobedience, and Sasanian imperial centralism, so that monarchy was eventually
abolished inboth countries, fora period ofclose onfour centuries.3
Finally, it is necessary to stress themany close links between Iran, Armenia and Georgia in religion, architecture and the arts, which continued even after thetwo latter countries had officially adopted Christianity. These links were closest under the Parthians, when Armenia was ruled bythe Parthian Arsacids, the first monarch ofthis line being himself a Magian. However, community of cult and religious beliefs between Iran and Armenia were in evidence as long ago as Urartian times, then during theAchaemenian monarchy, and again much later

under the Sasanians, though here this community was more the result of alien imposition from outside than ofspontaneous sharing of common traditions and experience.
In Georgia, however, contacts were particularly strong duringthe Sasanian period. Beautiful silver dishes and other splendid examples of Sasanian metal ware, with cult representations and Pahlavl inscriptions, have been recovered from ducal and viceregal burials and other excavation sites in a number of places inGeorgia. Both in Armenia and in Georgia, Sasanian influence is evident in many details of church and secular architecture (pis 40(^7), 41(a)). In fact, there have even been quite convincing attempts to link the design of the characteristic Armenian and Georgian cruciform domed church with the Zoroastrian fire temple. Besides the cruciform pattern, circular domed churches are also found. Certainly thelion and wild beast motifs so common in friezes and capital decorations of early Georgian and Armenian churches and palaces owe much to Sasanian models.1
Georgia and Armenia bytheir geographical situation were particularly well suited to be a bridge between thereligious world of the Gathas and the Avesta, and that ofthe Greek and Asianic pantheons. In Iran generally, the arrival of Hellenism in the wake of Alexander the Great sparked off an immense new religious movement - the syncretism of Greek and Oriental deities. Henceforth, Semitic (including Babylonian), Iranian and Greek deities began to be considered interchangeable. Thus Ahuramazda became the Iranian equivalent of Bel, Mithra of Shamash, and Anahita of Ishtar or Nanai. Apollo in the Susan hymn is addressed as Mara, a Syrian title denoting "Lord". Heracles was usually the Hellenic aspect of the Semitic Nergal or the Iranian Verethraghna, and Athena ofthe Arab goddess Allat.2
This eclectic, syncretizing tendency isvery apparent when we come to study the religious cults of ancient Iberia and Colchis.3 As direct descendants of ancient peoples of Anatolia, some of the tribes who helped to form the nucleus of the Iberian nation inherited cults and

beliefs closely akin to those of the Hittites, Phrygians, perhaps eventhe Sumerians, Assyrians and Babylonians. Testifying to this is theTrialeti goblet (dating from about 1500 B.C.), with itsscenes from a fertility rite connected with the Tree of Life and the potion of immortality. The colonization of the Black Seacoast by Milesian settlers from the 7th century B.C. onwards ledto thespread of Hellenistic cults which were to become popular in Parthia at a later period. A temple of Apollo existed at Phasis (Poti) at the mouth of the Rioni as early as the 5 th century B.C., as witness the discovery in north Caucasia in 1901 ofa silver drinking bowl of that period with theinscription: " I belong to Apollo the Supreme of Phasis". Later a huge statue of the goddess Rhea also stood in a conspicuous site on the Phasis estuary. Strabo speaks of a temple of the sun-goddess Leucothea and an oracle of Phrixus in the land of the Moskhoi - the Georgian province of Samtskhe; this temple was formerly rich but was later desecrated and
robbed of its treasures.1 Tree worship is attested in Georgia through the cult of the wood goddess Dali, corresponding to Artemis; a moon

cult lives on in Georgia to this day,having become merged with that of Saint George, also known as Tetri Giorgio or "White George".1 The prevalence of Mazdaism in Georgia is confirmed bythearchaeological evidence, which includes bowls showing thesacrificial figure of a horse standing before the ritual fire-altar. According to the "Life of Saint Nino", who converted eastern Georgia about A.D. 330, the Georgian national gods were named Armazi (to be identified with Ahuramazda of the Zoroastrian pantheon), Zaden, Gatsi and Gaim. When Saint Nino offered up prayers to God, the Almighty sent down hail "inlumps as bigas two fists" on to theabode of the heathen idols and smashed them into little pieces. Simple folk whom Saint Nino encountered at the town of Urbnisi worshipped the sacred fire of the Zoroastrians, andalso images of stone and wood.2
The pantheon of ancient Armenia was likewise an international, syncretic one. The complex edifice of Armenian paganism began to take shape during the ascendancy of the Orontids and the early Artaxiads. In addition to the famous temple of the Sun and Moon at Armavir, the Armenians maintained a whole group of sanctuaries in the holy forest at Ashtishat (Acesilene), in theprovince of Taron, not far from Mush. Here stood a mighty golden statue of Anahita, patron and protectress of Armenia, and famed all over the Iranian world as goddess of waters and fertility. A bronze head of Aphrodite/Anahit from Satala is in the British Museum (pi. 39^)). Anahit's father was Aramazd, themighty Ahuramazda of the Iranians, theOlympian Zeus of the Greek pantheon. Mithra, godof covenants andof light, was also widely popular; a high priest of that name officiated at the temple of Armavir around 200B.C. In theform "Meherr", Mithra features later in the Armenian national epic " David of Sassoun " asthe Great Meherr, Lion of Sassoun, who planted a splendid garden in Dzovasar and filled it with every kind of animal andfowl which Godhad created.3
The popular goddess Astghik, whose statue was often found alongside that of Anahit, corresponded on the one hand to the Assyrian Ishtar, on theother to theRoman goddess Venus. Astghik's lover was the Iranian deity Verethragna, god of war and victory, known in Armenian as Vahagn. Venerated in the guise of Heracles the dragon slayer, Vahagn was theson of Aramazd (Ahuramazda), as well as being identified with Ares, the Greek godof battle.

The most striking example of the syncretism of gods in ancient Parthia actually occurs in a former Armenian satellite kingdom, namely Commagene, the modern Malatya district. Here a scion of the Armenian Orontid house, King Antiochus I (69-34 B.C.)built himself a funeral hill at Nimrud Dagh (pis 37, 38).The sanctuary is grandiose, being surrounded on three sides by terraces and dominated by an artificial mound nearly five hundred feet high. On the east and west terraces stood a rowof five colossal seated figures, many times life-size, which represented four deities and King Antiochus himself. The chief statue represents the compound deity Zeus-Oromasdes, or Ahuramazda. A second depicts Apollo-Mithra-Helios-Hermes. Anda third presents to us Verethragna-Heracles-Ares. Into the terrace walls were sunk some ninety stone reliefs, depicting in most cases a pair of figures, one of whom is usually Antiochus. Weseetheking's paternal ancestors, traced back to the Achaemenian monarch Darius, son of Hystaspes, while Greek inscriptions record the dead ruler's connections with the Armenian dynasty of the Orontids.
Armenian andGeorgian demonology hasmany Iranian counterparts. Thus, thedaeva or demon spirit of the Avesta wasfeared in Armenia as in Georgia. The Armenian word is dev,Georgian devi. These devspreferred stony places and ruins; they appeared as serpents and other

monstrous forms, some physical and others incorporeal. The like their Avestan counterpart, were lying, perjuring, harmful spirits, believed to beoffemale sex. Theyatus or sorcerers ofthe Avesta also have their Armenian equivalents, who were even able to slay men. There existed destructive female demons called parik, whose husbands were known as kaj. The kajh also feature prominently in medieval Georgian demonology.* Manichaeism, oneof the most original of Iranian religious movements, hadmany adepts in Armenia andGeorgia. Armenia wasthe stronghold ofthe Paulicians, a later sect ofManichees, who then gave
rise to the insurgent sect ofthe Thondrakites.2 One ofthe vehicles for Manichaean teachings in Georgia and Armenia wasthe legend of Barlaam and Josaphat, which began asanedifying Buddhist tract, but acquired many Manichaean features. As Professor Henning discovered, a metrical version ofthe legend of Barlaam and Josaphat was contained in the oldest poetic manuscript written in Classical Persian so far known to us.3 In other cultural spheres also, there was much mutual enrichment arising from contacts between Iran and theCaucasian nations during the Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian eras. One has only to think of the perpetuation of the ancient Iranian gosdnor minstrel in the Armenian gusans (Georgian, mgosani)y whohave continued to delight popular audiences right up tomodern times, composing both music and poetic text as they went along. As early as the 5 th century, the Armenian Catholicos StJohn (Hovhannes) Mandakuni composed a treatise, "On the Theatre andthe Gusans", a copy of which may be seen in the Matenadaran or National Manuscript Library in Erevan. Politicalrelations between Iran and her Caucasian neighbours may not always have been cordial, but there isno doubt of the depth and extent ofreciprocal influences in many spheres of art, literature and religion, aswell as in social and political organization.

CHAPTER 13
IRAN AND CHINA
In Chinese myth the Tibetan massif and particularly the Kunlun range is taken to be the western limit of the world. Thepre-Han lore of the far west is embodied in the story of the miraculous journey of King Mu, of the 10th century B.C., during which he glimpses vast mountains and mysterious kingdoms. Later the Taoists entertained the idea of a western paradise of the immortals, presided over by Hsi-wang-mu, the Queen Mother of the West, andthis superstition paved theway for the success of the doctrine of Amitabha Buddha and his western paradise
after Buddhism hadbeen implanted in China.1
The Chinese hadno sure knowledge of what laybeyond thewestern mountains before Chang Ch'ien's exploration in the 2nd century B.C., but archaeological evidence points to material contacts with western Asia at a much earlier time. For example, from their close similarity a common origin seems probable for the pottery kiln of the Yang-shao neolithic culture of central China and the kiln used at Tepe Sialk in central Iran during the later 4th millennium B.C. The Yang-shao painted pottery itself constitutes the easternmost region reached bya tradition of ceramic ornament which spread from the Iranian plateau. In thecase of China this diffusion was notaccompanied by the transfer of any cultural system. A comparable slender affinity is seen in the three-lobed and tripod pottery vessels which occur in northern Iran and along the middle course of the Yellow river, the // and ting of the Chinese. In the bronze age onenotes an initial divergence of east and west, followed by a peculiar combination of western andeastern traits of material culture. In the earlier part of this period, that of the Shang dynasty in China, the coincidence of a socketed axe and a design of spearhead in China, Siberia and the Ural region, shows that an

established channel of east-west communications through Asia led far tothe north before it turned westwards. The difference in methods and forms which appear between the Shang culture and the Turkmen culture sited along the northern slopes of the Kopet Dagh, underline this divorce between bronze-using cultures in China and in western Asia.1
From the 9th or8th century B.C., however, a cultural link leads more directly towards the Iranian world; it is indicated by ornament caston daggers and harness-mounts innorth China under the early Chou kings (notably birds' heads and the motif of the animal-in-a-ring). One sees beginning the tenuous buteffective cultural continuum through Central Asia between Iran and China which largely determined the character of the east-west exchanges thereafter. From about 600 B.C. the pooling of ideas derived from civilization in east and west culminated in the creation of regional cultures marked by the so-called Scythic traits. These are a sword (the akinakes), arrowheads, knives, and a common repertoire ofanimal motifs inart, ofwhich the deer emblem is the most prominent. Such items demonstrate thefar travel and extraordinary uniformity of some basic elements of material and immaterial culture. Through theScythic zone ideas could evidently move independently of tribal migration. On ,the whole the archaeological records tell against attempts to identify groups of artefacts strictly with ethnic groups, andonemust conclude that ideas could move through the Scythic zone independently of large-scale tribal migration.2
Nomadism based on heavy cattle and the concomitant horse-breeding became the rule of life in the steppes. Cultural uniformity followed upon economic uniformity. Bythemiddle of the first millennium B.C.the combination ofnomadic pastoralism and Scythic culture reigned from south Russia and the north-eastern provinces of Iranian settlement to northern China. Its eastern boundary was abrupt, running north of the Yellow river on the line ofcontact with the settled Chinese population, and along the north-south ranges ofthe T'ai-hang and Hsing-an mountains, beyond which steppe conditions cease. Thecauses of wideranging nomadism in Central Asia have long been debated, and are certainly complex. A deterioration ofclimate must have contributed to it, at a time difficult to determine. Soviet scholars however favour

cultural advance as a decisive factor, arguing that the explosive growth of herds was not stimulated solely by change in the environment. This theory finds support in archaeological evidence-, including that in
stanced above.1 Although itwas open to cultural penetration from earlier times, there is no certain indication ofregular distant trade passing through Central Asia before the late Seleucid period. Under the Achaemenians the east-west trade may have taken a more northerly route, as the finds made atPazyryk inthe Altai suggest. Here influence from metropolitan Iran isseen inanimal designs and inthe horsemen and ornament ofthe famous knotted carpet, while the embroidery onsilk found inthe fifth kurgan and the fragment ofa bronze mirror from the sixth are noless sure signs ofa luxury trade conducted with China around the turn of the 4thand 3rdcenturies B.C. During thetroubled centuries which preceded the unification of China in 232 B.C. the military and political involvement of the northern Chinese principalities with mobile barbarian neighbours had cultural consequences which are reflected inthe general trend and insome particular motifs oflate Chou art. Inthe 9th and 8thcenturies B.C. China had itself contributed something to the art of Central Asia. Thereafter anill-defined relation of Chinese art to nomad artpersists. The Huai style which dominated in metropolitan China from the 5th to the3rd century B.C. shared with the animalart of the steppes a habit of adding fantastic elaboration to the shapesof real and mythical animals, all shown in flat design. This affinity proclaims China co-heir with Iran of inner Asian tradition rather than recipient of direct Iranian influence. In the 5 th and 4th centuriesB.C. Chinese ideas aredetected in nomad art andequipment, while, as a reflex ofsuch cultural export, China itself assimilated some elements of
Scythic art.2 In this complex exchange theOrdos region, lying within the great northward loop of the Yellow river, is a special case. Here anenclave of pure steppe art and culture was introduced by Hsiung-nu tribesmen, who were settled there from the 3rd century B.C., orearlier, until their defeat by Shih Huang Ti of Ch'in in 214 B.C.

moved their headquarters across Mongolia to Noin-ula on the Tola river, where their chieftains' tombs arefound to contain objectsimported from China aswell as others decorated in the nomad style.1
In the reign of the Han emperor Wu Ti (140-87 B.C.) the exploration and eventual armed intervention which this monarch undertook in Central Asia marked the beginning ofa new epoch inChina's relations with her western neighbours. The adventures of Chang Ch'ien, Wu Ti's envoy to the farwest, and the report he made onhis return have often been retailed, since they are a primary source foranimportant passage of Iranian history. Chang Ch'ien left China commissioned to seek an alliance with the Yiieh-chih against the Hsiung-nu. In 176 or 174 B.C. the latter had driven theYiieh-chih far west from their home in the north-west Chinese province ofKansu. In 160 B.C. the TaYiieh-chih,or Great Yiieh-chih, presumed to be a major fraction ofthe expelled tribe, are recorded attacking theSai-wang near lake Issyk Kul. In 128 B.C. they were found byChang Ch'ien settled between the river Oxus and Samarqand, that is, in Sogdiana, being apparently incontrol of Bactria (the Ta-hsia of the Chinese) beyond theriver, though not occupying its territory. Wu Ti's earlier policy towards neighbouring minor states with a settled habit oflife and ruled by an established line ofkings, was to demand their submission and then to allow the ruler to remain as a client of the Chinese court. This was the method headopted with the kingdom of Tien on his south-west border (modern Yunnan) in109 B.C. and it was probably what he had inmind for some stable minor statein central Asia, always hoping to exploit thedivisive tendencies of the Hsiung-nu nomadic confederacy. This consideration, as well as the possibility of gaining by Yiieh-chih hostility towards the Hsiung-nu (which inthe event proved avain hope) must have been included inthe envoy's briefing. Hence Chang Ch'ien paid unusual attention in his report to the towns, the agriculture and other characteristics of settled life to be observed among the two peoples he encountered who answered therequirements of Wu Ti'spolicy, the Ta-yiian and the Ta-hsia.2

There is no dispute on the identity of Ta-hsia as Bactria, which he reached just after the deposition of its last Greek king Heliocles,and whose capital Bactra (Balkh) he knew as Alexandria (Lan-shih). Ta-yiian, being the later name of Farghana, is by most scholars taken to be the same country when Chang Ch'ien speaks of it. Its economy and urban populousness yield nothing to Bactria in theaccount given in Ssu-ma Ch'ien's 123rd chapter as it now stands, but some ofthe distances anddirections which appear in thetext aredifficult to reconcile with a location inmodern Farghana. Onthis question one schoolof critics assumes that Chang Ch'ien was mistaken ina detail of geography, part of which is put right in theversion of his report included in the Han History, and that Farghana is still his Ta-yiian. Another school argues for a more easterly position of Ta-yiian, in theregion of Kucha in east Turkestan, or even on the windy Pamir. The Kucha theory makes the justifiable assumption that Ta-yiian wasfor Chang Ch'ien the name of a people, a nomadic tribe originally domiciled well to the east, but which, before the historian's recital of Chang Ch'ien's mission (i.e. in the interval between Chang's return home in 126B.C. and the composition of Ssu-ma Ch'ien's chapter) had moved farther west to occupy Farghana and Sogdiana, the Yiieh-chih having now advanced southwards into Bactria. The source of subsequent information which, on the latter theory, the historian incorporated in the narrative,may have been the four subordinate envoys whom Chang Ch'ien despatched to thewest in 115 B.C, at thetime of his mission to theWu-sun in the Hi valley. According to theHan History these failed to return to China
before Chang Ch'ien's death there a year later.1
Apart from the problem of Ta-yiian, the inclusion of information available only after Chang Ch'ien's death must besupposed to account for facts pertaining to Parthia which appear in the report, since these imply Parthian dominion on thelower Oxus and asfar as theAral sea, a situation not reached until some years after 128 B.C.

editing necessitated by thelater additions may be thecause of a curious feature of the narrative: Chang Ch'ien's apparent failure to record that the Sacaraucae and Massagetae were invading Parthia at the very time of his visit to Bactria. But if he was required particularly to report on established kingdoms as potential buttresses to Chinese policy, the envoy mayhave dismissed this incursion by Saka, whom he knew to comprise several peoples, as just another case of short-lived turbulence occasioned by an ephemeral alliance of nomads, which wasnothing to his purpose. He does not mention the quondam Greek kings either. Parthia was at this time known to the Chinese as An-hsi after its capital Antioch-Marv. For some decades after the fall of the Parthian dynasty the same name was in use for their successors, but thereafter Po-ssu, a rendering of Parthian, was used to designate the Sasanian kings and empire.
Within a generation of Chang Ch'ien's journey Parthia and China were in diplomatic relations and a regular trade between them had begun, the first caravan from the east being said to have arrived in 106 B.C., calling at Bactria on the way. If the Wu-sun of the Hi valley were notwilling in 115B.C. to make thealliance against the Hsiung-nu which the Chinese sought they had at least offered safe passage to Chinese merchants. But the Ta-yiian were less well disposed. Shortly after Chang Ch'ien's second mission the Chinese sent several embassies to Ta-yiian, which nowmay be firmly equated with Sogdiana, requesting tribute of its celebrated horses; these were refused. When a final mission stole some horses and set off for home with them it was overtaken by the troops of the Ta-yiian prince MuKuaandits members all cut down. In 104 B.C. the emperor Wu-ti despatched his general Li Kuang-li at the head of an army said to be 30,000 strong, which survived therigours of the march through Central Asia only to be defeated by Ta-yiian not far from the place where the envoys had been murdered. In 101 B.C. an army twice as large was brought again by Li Kuang-li from China andthis time succeeded in destroying the Ta-yiian force outside Erh-shih, thecapital of their prince Mu-kua. TheChinese then laid siege and eventually the Ta-yiian leaders murdered Mu-kua and parleyed with General Li,agreeing to supply food to his exhausted troops and to hand over horses (some thirty of the special and three thousand of the common breed) on condition that he took his army back to China without attempting to enter the city. The rulers of Ta-yiian thereafter maintained friendly relations with China andex

changed regular embassies with her. In their turn Wu-ti's successors until A.D. 73 abandoned attempts at further alliance and dominion in the far west. When in 51B.C. the Hsiung-nu divided into twohostile camps, the southern Hsiung-nu submitting to China, the immediate incentive for Chinese intervention in Central Asia was temporarily
removed.1 A Chinese presence in theeast of the Iranian sphere was felt again a century later, in A.D. 73, when the cavalry general Pan Ch'ao was despatched to counter thepressure of the Hsiung-nu ontheprincipalities both ofthe southern and the northern routes. Kashghar, which had been taken by Kucha with the support ofthe Hsiung-nu, was recovered, and access to the Terek pass leading into Farghana was assured for Chinese trade. Pan Ch'ao's arrival at Khotan had coincided with that of Hsiung-nu envoys, but these were worsted, theKhotan ruler deposed and theindependent expansionist operations of Khotan brought to an end. It wasat this city that Pan Ch'ao, on his wayeastwards in obedience to an order recalling him on theground of expense, decided to disregard the imperial will and to return to consolidate further the Chinese hold on theroutes leading westwards through themountains. In A.D. 78 he occupied Aksu and Uch-Turfan and so controlled the Bedel pass. After crushing rebellions at Kashghar and Yarkand he moved farther north to secure the Hi valley by a treaty with the Wu-sun. The policy which hehad urged on theemperor andnow implemented was that ofemploying the forces of subjected princes against those who still held out. When Karashahr was taken from the Hsiung-nu in A.D. 94 the Chinese aim of confining their great enemy to Outer Mongolia seemed near to being accomplished. It is appropriate thatwe should find Pan Ch'ao shortly afterwards sending his lieutenant Kan Ying to make contact with Ta-ch'in, the Roman east, through which the last stage of the westward trade-route was known to lie. Entering Parthia, KanYing found its king ruling from Hecatompylos, and he noted the country's large population and army. Theinhabitants may have deliberately led him astray regarding his route, for instead of directly crossing theRoman frontier on the Euphrates he went to the shore of the Persian gulf, as if to take ship around Arabia. Buta terrifying account of the sea voyage to the west so discouraged him that he abandoned his mission altogether. Thus the only official

Mongolian zone from Manchuria to Balkash, but from this wide base their razzias southwards appear tohave been ofless lasting effect than those oftheir predecessors. In224 we find the rulers ofLobnor, Kucha and Khotan affirming their allegiance to theWei state of the now divided China. During the period of ascendancy of the Hsien-pi, and of their successors the Juan-juan, the cities along the trade-routesare rarely named inthe Chinese histories. We may surmise that they were not subjected to any lasting external domination, for during the 4th century Chinese influence ceased beyond the borders of Kansu. Cultural contacts to be mentioned later suggest that at this time the journey for merchants and pilgrims between China andthe Iranian sphere was still feasible, though the hazards ofthe way made caravans and travellers fewer than inthe heyday ofHan power. In the middle ofthe 5 th century China began toreach out again,as the north-China state ofNorthern Wei, founded by the T'o-pa Turks, began to assume the traditional posture of a stable China. In 448 the Juan-juan were destroyed, Lobnor brought toheel, and Karashahr and Kucha made tributary to the Northern Wei court. But the Northern Wei government was preoccupied with internal diplomacy and war, and its limited intervention in the west illustrates the axiom that Chinese expansion inCentral Asia isindirect proportion tothe extent of political unity achieved athome. One consequence of the unification under the Sui, and impressively confirmed shortly afterwards under the T'ang, was a rapid expansion of Chinese power through the Tarim basin to the farthest outposts where ithad made itself felt in Han times. Between 635 and 648 Yarkand, Khotan, Kucha, Kashghar, Karashahr and Turfan were brought under Chinese suzerainty, and the stage was set fora revival of east-west commercial and cultural exchange to a degree surpassing all that had occurred before. In thelate 650sthe king ofNing Yuan (Farghana) sent an envoy tothe Chinese court, and the emperor confirmed theking's authority bya brevet, after which Ning Yuan ambassadors came regularly to Ch'ang-an bringing gifts. Bukhara sent ambassadors in618 and 626 and continued with gifts later in thecentury. In theearly 8th century there arerecords of tribute
coming from Samarqand and Maimargh.1

The context of this better realized pax sinica in Central Asia makes intelligible thestory of an appeal addressed to theChinese court by the last Sasanian ruler or his son. The record is entirely Chinese and differs in the two sources, the Tyang history and the New T'ang history. The latter speaks of an embassy sent to Ch'ang-an in 638 asking for help against the Arabs, which the emperor T'ai Tsung refused. After a second vain appeal in 661 Firuz (Peroz), thesonof Yazdgard III, came to Ch'ang-an himself in 670-3. According to theTyanghistorya Chinese force was sent by Kao Tsung with the object of restoring Firuz to his father's throne, but returned having got no farther than Kucha. The account adds that Firuz took refuge in Tukharistan with an army of Persians, andthat in 708 he again sought refuge in the Chinese capital and was made a military officer of the left.1 According to theNew T'ang history the latter part of this story belongs to another Persian refugee, while Firuz remained in Ch'ang-an from thetime of his first arrival in 670-3, andafter a few years' residence wasallowed to build a Persian temple there. Firuz was appointed governor of Iran by the Chinese emperor, and this hollow title was bestowed again on Firuz' son in 707, andon other members of the Persian royal house in 722 and728, all of these residing in Ch'ang-an andapparently keeping up a pretence of royal diplomacy with the imperial court.2

Whatever else may be shown to have passed east and west through Central Asia between the 4th century B.C. and the 7th century A.D. there is no question but that Chinese silk was the most important article of trade, andtheSilk Road is justly named.3 The route left China at Tun-huang, having come along theKansu corridor under theshelter

of the wall which Wu-ti built toprotect it in 113-112 B.C. The northern branch left the wall at the Jade Gate (Yii-men-kuan), passed near Turfan and Karashahr and then followed the foothills ofthe T'ien-shan westwards. The southern road started from the Sun Gate (Yang-kuan) and pursued its way generally south-east along the edge of the Tibetan plateau, passing Miran, Niya, Khotan and Yarkand. Theroads rejoined at Kashghar and soon after divided again, one branch goingby the Terek pass and through Farghana to Samarkand, Antioch (Marv), and the other, still aiming at Marv, making a detour to Balkh after crossing the Pamirs by the Tuan-Murun pass a little tothe south. Itwas the latter branch that passed near a stone tower on the Bactrian frontier which is mentioned by Ptolemy. After Marv theroad ledto the Parthian capital at Hecatompylos, then to Ecbatana (Hamadan) and came finally to the Tigris at Seleucia-Ctesiphon, whence Syria could be reached by a number of routes. ThePamir section was under the control of the Kushans and their Hunnish successors until A.D. 5 60,and the trade always passed without hindrance. The section under Parthian and then Sasanian control was also secure, andthechief threat from political unrest lay east of the Pamirs and west of the Tigris.1
There can belittle doubt that some of the trade went from ports on the Indian ocean (the Barygaza and Barbaricum of"The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea",2 where transhipment is recorded) in order to avoid the troubles of the Roman East. There is question also of a possible route reaching Persia from thenorth. The indications of the Pazyryk finds were mentioned earlier. We infer from Aristotle's description of the silkworm that some knowledge of sericulture had reached the west from China by the 4th century B.C. It is arguable that the material itself had come a century earlier to theAchaemenian empire, which might explain the Pazyryk silk plausibly as derived from a passing Sino-Iranian trade. Butanother possible northerly route follows the valley of theHi,where good relations between the Wu-sun and the Chinese at anearly date would belikely to attract trade to the north of Kashghar.3 In the7thcentury there is epigraphical proof for the con

The Chinese conciliatory policy towards the Turks of Central Asia was largely dictated bytheinterest of trade: cf.

SILK TRADE
signment of a hundred pieces of silk from Kucha to the town of Kung-yiieh near I-ning on theHi.1 On theother hand speculation that a Sino-Iranian trade route went far into Outer Mongolia, on the evidence of Hellenistic traits in art, would appear to be unfounded, since there was easy access to Outer Mongolia along the Etzin-gol from the vicinity of Tun-huang. The finds of supposed Bactrian andSyrian cloth of c. ioo B.C. at Urga in Mongolia can hardly imply a Sino-Iranian trade passing so far to the north. Nor, in view of the doubts attaching to the Seres when these are first mentioned by Greek andLatin authors, can much reliance be placed on the theory that a journey to their country undertaken by Euthydemus of Bactria at the end of the3rd century B.C. led him into inner Asia along the ancient route by which Siberian gold wasanciently exported.2
The secret of silk is said to have been closely guarded by theChinese. The exact date of its communication to Iran is notcertain, butit cannot have been long after A.D. 419, if we may believe the story of a Chinese princess whosmuggled the silkworm into Khotan in that year. Bombyx moriwas known in theRoman empire in 5 5 2, andin 5 62 silk production was made a state monopoly by Justinian. Apart from knowledge of the insect the transference of the techniques of sericulture and weaving must have required the migration of some artisans. In thelatter respect the Iranians were perhaps better placed than their neighbours farther west. The event which solved the mystery of silk for Europeans is attributed to "Indian monks" whobrought the bombyx from Serindia (a term which mayonly vaguely indicate a region of the Tarim); or to a Persian who brought the insect in a hollow cane from the country of the Seres, which in this instance means the Chinese.3 In Western Asia as in theRoman West silk production began as soon as the techniques were acquired. Thetomb of an official at Astana in theTarim, dated to 632, contained silk believed to be of Sogdian origin.4 The influence of Persian design is manifest in silk damasks preserved in Japan in the Shosoin. Whether of Iranian or Chinese manufacture these testify to an important export of silk stuffs from the west in the 8 th century. Already at an earlier time Persian silks may have begun to compete with the native product among the fashionables of the Chinese court.

IRAN AND CHINA
The "Liang history" refers to Persian brocades {chin),and the "gold thread weave" of the "Sui history" may mean a Sasanian brocade. Some other terms fortextiles which occur in Sui texts have been interpreted asphonetic renderings of Persian words (pi. 48).
If we put aside the rare and exotic items included inthe Sino-Iranian trade (inthis case it is difficult to distinguish between gifts and commercial goods) and consider those ofgreater economic importance, the question arises how the accounts were balanced. We donot hear, as is reported byPliny of the Indian trade, that payment was made in gold, and the few hoards ofSasanian silver coin found inChina, dating tothe 5 th, and late 6th orearly 7th, centuries, do not necessarily prove a large transfer of specie. But payment in silver would have suited Chinese fiscal policy well, and the bulk ofthe coil would have been recast as the current ingots.1 Some silk damasks eventually went east from western Asia, butit is likely that woollen cloth andglass wares, both from Asian and Roman factories, were the more normal staples ofthe return trade from the early years ofthe exchange, although Chinese literature seldom mentions them. Purple-dyed woollen cloth, probably a product of the Roman industry, wasfound at Lou-Ian and dated to about 100 B.C., while woollen rugs {tya teng) mentioned in Han as originating in India, and in the 3rd century as coming from the Roman East,are under the Sui attributed toPersia.2 Inthe Sasanian period glass-makers in Babylon could add their products to those of the longer-established factories ofSyria and Egypt. But atthe Chinese end direct evidence for importation is scanty. While theglass of the Han and later centuries sometimes assumes exotic shapes in small solid articles (all that could be made of it apparently) the majority of such pieces are plainly Chinese. TheChinese seem however to have prized glass above its normal value, and it is sometimes listed among the precious materials offered as tribute from the west. Among beads (which include the inlaid eye-beads well known also in the Near East and in Europe) some are advanced asevidence ofimportation, while others, containing barium,

The treasure of gold andsilver vessels found at Ho-chia, Sian, in 1970 contained a coin of Khusrau II, suggesting that such issues remained current in China until the middle of the 8th century.

The latter work illustrates many fragments of woollen textiles such as were imported by the Chinese through or from Central Asia.

TRADE
are thought to be local Chinese products. An Alexandrian glass vase of the 2nd century B.C. was found in Honan. It is likely that the export of glass to the Far East increased greatly from the late 4th century onwards, and among the greenish-blue bottles found in Chinese tombs of the late 5 th century some are of recognizable Persian or Syrian origin. A bowl preserved in the Shosoin in Japan has round cut facets which ally it closely to pieces found in the Gilan region of north Iran, and these are likely to be of Sasanian manufacture. The Japanese example will have come with the trade of the Silk Road.1
Among articles which caught the Chinese imagination but are less likely to have counted seriously in the trade, are precious stones, crystal, turquoise, amber, agate, artificial gems of an unidentified kind, carpets, aromatics, ostrich eggs, coral, byssus, storax, mats, lions, Sogdian mail-armour (perhaps not before the T'ang, though an influence of Iranian armour in the east can be argued for the Han period), and not least the dwarfs, jugglers, acrobats, musicians and dancers who delighted the Chinese court. As recorded in the Chinese histories the majority of embassies between east and west were before 284 and after 643, but in the interim the trade was not so greatly affected. In 45 5 an embassy from Persia brought rugs, jewels and aromatic substances. Pliny states that Seric iron was better than that made in Parthia, a remark recalling Chang Ch'ien's curious report that from Ta-yiian west to An-hsi: "there is no silk or lacquer and the casting of iron utensils is not known. When some deserters from the company of a Chinese envoy took refuge there they taught the casting of other weapons." Here particular significance attaches to the production of cast iron, which was not known at this time in the west, nor indeed learned from the lessons of the Chinese deserters. It appears from its reputation with the Romans that cast iron joined the flow of exports from China in the 1st century B.C., though it is not clear where its superiority lay for the objects that occidentals usually made of this metal at that time. The iron was known to come to the west through Bactria and Parthia, which tends to disprove the theory that Seric iron had its origin in southern India.2

2 (a) Pliny (xxxiv. 41. 145) says that the Seres took the palm for the excellence of the iron sent with their "garments and furs". It is not quite certain that he refers to the Chinese - his contemporary Lucan thought that the Seres inhabited the source of the Nile.

The reported sea trade ofSyria with Parthia and India isthought to have handled Chinese goods, and especially silk, although the histories make no explicit reference to voyages to thefar west from Chinese ports. An early close-linked, ifnot direct, seaborne trade with the west is indicated bythe find ofa gold medallion with the head and superscription of Antoninus Pius in excavations at Oc Eoin the Mekong delta, accompanied by other objects eloquent ofthe Indian part in the
trade.1 Ships with Persian-speaking crews sailed the southern seas, docking probably atan unknown port insouth Vietnam, as well as at a port near Hanoi. In T'ang times these ships made the whole way to Canton. The land routes between western Asia and China seem to have been travelled mainly by Sogdian merchants, usually in groups {tut shang), and Sogdian was the lingua franca. The Wei History, speaking of the Samarkand state, remarks that "all the barbarians* trade is concentrated here". When embassies from this region went toHan China in the ist century B.C. they nodoubt were accompanied by Sogdian merchants, andthe "tribute from K'ang" recorded by the Chinese need have been no more than thevisits of Sogdian merchants with their usual goods. The Sogdians came frequently to Ku-tsang in Kansu, the capital of the small Liang state of the 4th century, and some of them were captured by northern Wei when it annexed Liang in 439. The king of Sogdiana (Su-te) sent an embassy to KaoTsung of Wei (452-65) asking to beallowed to ransom the merchants, and this was
Parthia through Marv (Orosius vi.13, and Plutarch, Lives, "Crassus" xxiv). The widespread theory that Seric iron came from theCheras of southern India . . . cannot stand against this fact. Pliny xxxix. 15 says that Seric iron was better than that produced in
Parthia/' Cf. W. H. Schoff, "The eastern iron trade of the Roman Empire", JAOS xxxv (1915), p. 230.

The importation ofplants, aromatics and other precious materials, almost wholly from the west toChina, isdealt with in particular detail. A weakness of the evidence lies in theusual impossibility of distinguishing between Persia proper and Iranianized Central Asia as the place oforigin, and in the conflation of literary and strictly botanical indications. It is clear that in post-Han times the Chinese were too ready to attribute the introduction ofexotica to Chang Ch'ien himself. Some important items, grouped in three periods of introduction to China, areas follows: 1.Han period: alfalfa, vine. u .Between Han and T'ang: balsam poplar, coriander, cucumber, jasmine, onion spec, pomegranate, saffron, myrrh, spikenard, storax. in.

granted. In the Sui and Tang periods and possibly earlier the Sogdians had established settlements along both the north and the south trade routes through the Tarim, and intermarried with the local inhabitants. Sogdians were present among the Iranians who resided at Ch'ang-an under the Tang (pi. 45). It is possible that An Lu-shan, the leader of the rebellion that all but overthrew the Tang in A.D. 756, was the son of a Samarqandl father and a Turkic mother. He was born in eastern Mongolia and is described as a merchants' middleman by profession. Anecdotes were rife on the Sogdians' sharpness: that at birth honey was put in their mouths and gum on their hands, that they learned the trade from the age of five, that on reaching their twelfth year they were sent to do business in a neighbouring state. Probably by the 7th century Persians had joined with Arabs to create the foreign emporium on the Grand Canal at Yangchou mentioned by the New Tang History. The same source records a disturbance there in 760 in which a thousand of
the merchants were killed.1
From the T'ang period onwards and probably earlier the term hu, originally denoting foreigners from Central Asia in general, appears to be more particularly used for Persians. Some Persian families residing at the Chinese capital had adopted the surname Li. Their riches were proverbial, so that the idea of a "poor Persian" could be listed as a paradox. What we learn of them from the T'ang History, and the New T'ang History, refers for the most part to Persians settled in China after the fall of the Sasanian empire, but what is said then of their activities is no doubt equally true of Persians resident earlier in Chinese cities. Concern with precious stones and rare materials gave some of them an alchemical reputation, and in later literature they might appear with Taoists in quest of the elixir of life. A "Pharmacopoeia of the Western Barbarians" (Hu pen ts'ao) published in the 8th century describes the Persians' drugs. As late as the 10th century Li Hsien, the descendant of a Persian family which had settled in China under the Sui, composed a "Pharmacopoeia of foreign drugs" (Haiyao pen ts'ao) and was known as a Taoist adept with special skill in arsenical medi

IRAN AND CHINA
In the wake of the Iranians came something of their religions. After the banishment of Nestorius from Constantinople in 435 some of his disciples found their way to Persia. When Nestorian Christianitywas introduced into China at the beginning of the T'ang dynasty its Syrian missionary O LoPen may be supposed to have approached thecourt, conscious that a religion which had a following among the Uighur Turks of Central Asia must belistened to, and taking advantage of the atmosphere created bya rich Persian community resident at the capital. According to thestele erected in 781 Nestorian churches (ssu) were in every prefecture bythe middle of the8th century. While other foreign religions introduced into China under theT'ang lack this established evidence for their progress, it is likely that Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism attracted greater interest in intellectual andofficial circles; both were recognized by the Chinese government and must have seemed particularly deserving of political support as religions of Central Asians, whom theChinese were ever at pains to conciliate. Zoroastrianism, well established on the frontier as near as Turfan, first appears in China early in the 6th century, when it is spared from a general persecution offoreign religions. If the term "the Heaven-God of the Hu" is correctly interpreted to mean theAhura Mazda of the Zoroastrians it would appear that the rulers ofthe northern Chou state in themid 6thcentury admitted theIranian religion to their territory. In the early T'ang period there were five shrines (miao) of the HeavenGod in Ch'ang-an, three in Loyang, and others in the western provinces, and now it is clearer that Zoroastrianism is meant. The Chinese themselves were not allowed to participate in any of the foreign ceremonies. Theshrines are said to have contained no image and to have consisted ofa small room facing west inwhich Heaven and Earth, Sun andMoon, Water andFire were worshipped. Having escaped a persecution by Buddhists in 732the Zoroastrians succumbed to the xenophobic movement of 845, when their magians were dismissed.
Manichaeism is first mentioned in China in 694when its dualistic principle was explained to the court. It is likely that Manichaean missionaries were responsible for conveying some astronomical and mathematical ideas to China from the Iranian sphere. Anembassy sent in 719 included a mu-she^ interpreted to mean a magus and astronomer. Toleration for Manichaeism was prudent so long as theUighurs were powerful in Central Asia, but with their decline the religion lost its official support and bythemid 9th century it had to go underground. It continued as a secret society for some time andreferences to it are

found for thenext five hundred years. Although its theology based upon the opposition of light and darkness might bethought akin to Chinese dualism, it infact had nothing incommon with the systemof jin zn&yang. A moralized cosmology of the kind preached byManichaeans canhave found little sympathy in China, if indeed it was
intelligible there at all.1 In artChina experienced the influence of Iran from the 4th century onwards as a more or less direct transmission from the east Sasanian provinces. In the earlier phase the chief vehicle wasthe Buddhist iconography and its accompanying decorative styles, which had passed through Central Asia to China with increasing effect from the timeof the first missionaries in the 2nd or 3rd century B.C. For the Buddhist art ofCentral Asia a great formative centre inthe west was Bamiyan,in Afghanistan, which lay near to though not within the sphere of
Sasanian official art.2 Here the Graeco-Indian style of Gandharan Buddhism first assimilated some Iranian decorative forms, and then, from about themiddle of the 4thcentury, Iranian pictorial methods supplanted Gandharan models asa source ofthe new images required by the Mahayanist expansion of theBuddhist pantheon. China was affected partly as sharing in theIranian transformation of art which took place rapidly in the oasis cities both of thenorthern and the southern route from about A.D. 400, and partly through direct communication from the west.
The expansion of northern Wei power into Central Asia alongthe northern route ensured the artistic communication eastwards. A general Iranian influence is seen inthe splendid wall paintings ofCave 257 at Tun-huang, which depict the various incidents of the Deer Jataka. The useof a uniform ground of dark red, the conventional flower sprays evenly spaced on this ground, the fluttering ribbons, crowns and long narrow-sleeved garments inthis and other early caves all betoken Persian influence. The habitual Chinese preoccupation with spatial recession is abandoned for clear spacing on afeatureless ground. Even some details ofpainted architecture inrtate the Persian model, it

being evident that the structure ofChinese trabeate buildings was little understood bythe artists. In architecture the Chinese could copy little from foreign methods, but itis possible that the ceiling raised into alantern roof by acorbelling of beams, a design ofthe greatest convenience intemples, was inspired
from Iran, for it was known also atBamiyan inAfghanistan.1 At Tunhuang one may speak of a Sino-Iranian school of painting subsisting from the early 5 th until nearly the end of the 6th century, whenthe style becomes wholly Chinese. AtTurfan the mixture of Chinese and Iranian elements lasted until the 10th century, butat Kucha, in contrast to this, art becomes thoroughly sinicized soon after the opening of the 8th century. A more particular Iranian influence inChinese Buddhist art, created in a wholly sinicized context, is seen in thedesign of a Bodhisattva image seated with legs crossed at theankles, with head ribbons and
often swathed inbroad crossing scarves.2 This figure isfrequent inthe second half ofthe 5 th century inthe cave temples cut ina cliff at Yunkang inShansi, under the patronage of the northern Wei kings. In cave XVII one such image is a principal, while another, carved in a small niche, isdated to489 by an inscription which also identifies the subject as Maitreya, the Bodhisattva of the present kalpa (cosmic period) due to attain to Buddhahood in the next. The Bodhisattva is represented seated inhis paradise, Sukhavati, located inthe Tushita Heaven, where he awaits the arrival ofthe faithful. Although the cross-ankled posture is known in Gandharan sculpture, it is more probably ofIranian than Indian origin. It occurs atBamiyan and atKizil inTurkestan. InChina the pose is modified inthe 7th century to the so-called European posture, with both legs pendent. At Bamiyan and in the neighbouring valley ofKakrak, the Bodhisattva might be depicted wearing a crown decorated with three crescents each embracing a circular jewel. This arrangement repeats the crescent andball ornament placed on the crown ofa Sasanian king, the jewel being acceptable toBuddhists as a symbol of the Law, ifan explanation was required. In general the shape of the headdress given to the later Bodhisattvas appears to be of Iranian inspiration, as no doubt is also the broad-shouldered and rather straight-lined profile of the whole figure asit was conceived at Yiin
kang (pis 42-4).3

The chief Iranian influence on the iconography ofCentral Asian and Chinese Buddhism was however of a more general and theological kind. There can be little doubt that the character of the Buddha Amitabha (Mi-t'o-fo) aspropagated toeast Asia owes much to Iranian concepts ofcosmology and divinity: ". . . aslord of 'boundless light' he suggests Ahura Mazda. As lord of 'boundless life' he bears the same title asAmeretat, one ofthe six Mazdean Amesha Spentas, who surround the deity and are insome sense his emanation or attributes." Amitabha's Western Paradise, with its jewelled throne, like Maitreya's Sukhavati, has itsgerm inIranian beliefs, itsrepresentation a glorified version ofan Iranian royal audience (for such a thing China itself pro
vided noearthly model).1 The full impact of this iconography in China follows the end of Sasanian rule, falling inthe T'ang dynasty and particularly the first half of the 8th century. Itwould ensue that the finest Buddhist wall paintings to have survived until recent time, those of the Horyuji temple in Japan, incorporate much in design and style that is Iranian, although comparison is oftenest made with the Ajanta murals. Broad analogies apart, the evidence fordetailed items borrowed from Iranian lore are rare. One may cite three painted panels preserved in the Shosoin, certainly T'ang work, showing each an animal beneath the Haoma tree of
ancient Iranian tradition.2 Inthe branches are hidden figures standing for the ten avatars ofVerethraghna, a personification of the tree. It is likely that more was known in China of Iranian story than appears from extant artand writing. A work published in 860 tells how a city was sited andbuilt by oneWu-se-to-hsi, who is plausibly explained as
Vistaspa, the legendary founder of Bactria.3
The art-historical and archaeological evidence forSino-Iranian relations, solargely drawn onabove, is onmany points suggestive rather than conclusive. It calls forcritical treatment if significant connection with the metropolitan Sasanian kingdom istobe established. Itis often the eastern marches of the kingdom that arein question. Contacts

would expect the general terminus for the Chinese trade to liein this frontier province, whether delivered there by Chinese or Sogdian merchants. Consignments for destinations farther west would be redespatched from Sogdiana, andhere also consignments constituting the return trade would bemade up (pis 46-7).
Since the oasis cities lining both the northern and the southern route through theTarim were so strongly Iranianized, the art-historian has difficulty in separating what belongs properly to theSasanian sphere from what more truly represents the local growth of Central Asian culture, in which Iranian elements were combined with others of Turkic and local origin. By disregarding this distinction it is possible to multiply instances of Chinese contact with western tradition into which an Iranian ingredient enters more or less, but the historical moment may belost. It would bewrong also, forexample, to assume from the isolated record of a painter at the Ch'in court in the late 3rd century B.C., hailing from a mysterious but possibly Central Asian state of Chien-chiian, that Sasanian influence lay behind the increasing realism ofChinese painting inthe Han period. Similarly, the celebrated artist Wei-Ch'ih I-seng, who at theT'ang capital in the 8th century astonished all by the illusion of solidity he achieved from hisworks, need not be cited infavour ofSasanian style. I-seng came from Khotan, and seems tostem from a school more influenced by India than Iran.
To illustrate the most significant Sino-Iranian contacts the narrative has been taken necessarily beyond theend of Sasanian rule, into the middle decades of the T'ang dynasty. The latest points that call for notice are to beseen asanaftermath of Sasanian culture, or asthe last echoes ofSasanian politics. But the art-historical evidence forthcoming in China, currently multiplied and rendered more precise by archaeological discovery, carries a greater implication. The work in silver and gold, and the textiles, which show the Chinese craftsman at his most receptive to Iranian influence in decorative design, fall rather strictly into the first half of the 8th century, persisting to a time more than a century after theArab conquest of the Near East. Either this delay marks anIndian summer of the pre-Islamic tradition of Iran lingering in Central Asia, orone concludes that Sasanian art continued to flourish in itshome long after the departure of Sasanian kings. The latter may be thought more probable.

CHAPTER 14
CULTURAL RELATIONS
BETWEEN PARTHIA AND ROME1
The Parthians and the Romans were enemies engaged in ruthless and almost perpetual warfare, a life and death struggle which left few opportunities for peaceful contacts. It is not surprising therefore that the most obvious contacts belong to the sphere of military technology and strategy. In the 3rd century, just when the Arsacid empire gave way to the Sasanians, the historian Herodian summarized in a few words the respective achievements of the two mighty powers, the Romans and the Persians. The emperor Caracalla (188-217), so Herodian tells us, sent a letter to ask for the hand of a daughter of King Artabanus V of Parthia. The marriage union, Caracalla wrote to Artabanus, would bring together thetwogreatest powers in theworld. The proposalwas gladly accepted andCaracalla hurried to Parthia where he was received with all due honours. But during the preparations for the wedding feast he managed to kill the unsuspecting and drunken Parthians. The point of this tall story is to reveal to theworld that what Caracalla proclaimed to be a great military victory wassimple trickery.
This childish story would not be worth quoting were it not for a passage in the alleged letter of Caracalla with the marriage proposal, which obviously reflects current Roman thinking. Herodian says: "His wish was to marry a princess, the daughter of a great king. He pointed out that the Roman and the Parthian empires were thelargest in the world; if they were united by marriage, one empire without a rival would result when they were no longer divided by a river. The rest of the barbarian nations nownot subject to their authority could easily be reduced, as they were governed by tribes and confederacies. Furthermore, the Roman infantry were invincible in close-quarter combat with spears, andtheParthians hada large force ofhighly skilled horse-archers. The two forces, he said, complemented each other; by waging wartogether, they could easily unite theentire inhabited world

PARTHIA AND ROME
under a single crown. Since the Parthians produced spices and excellent textiles and the Romans metals and manufactured articles, theseproducts would no longer be scarce and smuggled by merchants; rather, when there was one world under one supreme authority, both peoples
would enjoy these goods andshare them in common."1 The Parthian empire which the Romans regarded as the second world
power was an oriental monarchy.2 It is important to stress its oriental character in contrast to thehellenized Parthia of the 2ndand 1st centuries B.C. The ostentatious philhellenism of the earlier period had disappeared. Greek remained for long thelanguage of the inscriptions on the Parthian coins, but in the 2ndcentury A.D., the language was no longer understood andthe coin legends gradually became a meaningless jumble of letters. This empire flourished by its trade, being theintermediary between China and South Asia on theonehand, andthewestern world on the other. The letter concocted byHerodian names the two chief articlesof
trade, spices and textiles. Not allthespices sold to the west belonged to this carrying trade; as we shall see, a condiment like asafoetida was a native Iranian product. Thesame distinction applies to textiles: a considerable proportion of the trade consisted of Chinese silks, which reached thewest viaParthia, butat thesame time there was a constant demand for the native Persian stuffs, which had been famous inthe west for many centuries. Two commodities which enjoyed a reputation in Rome were "Parthian steel" (or "Parthian iron") and "Parthian leather". Pliny
mentions "Parthian iron" as the second best in the world:3 itwas apparently not Iranian in origin, but an article of trade which came originally from India. Fine leather wasimported from the Orient in imperial times, and known as "Parthian"; the later emperors wore knee-length "Parthian boots" of red leather.
1 Herodian iv. 10 (here quoted from the translation by E. C. Echols). The historical nucleus of the story is told byDio LXXVIII. I. It issatisfying that the references to Caracalla's "Utopia of a Romano-Iranian Empire" in the first edition of the Oxford Classical Dictionary (1949, p. 125) have been excised from thesecond (1970, p. 153). 2 Roman knowledge of the Parthians andtheir customs is reflected on thefew remains surviving in thecity of a 2nd-century A.D. triumphal arch commemorating a Roman victory over thebarbarians. See F. Cumont, "L'adoration desmages et Tart triomphal de Rome",

Adoration of the Magi in Christian art. 3 Pliny xxxiv.145.

MILITARY STRATEGY
MILITARY TECHNOLOGY AND STRATEGY
Herodian stresses that the Romans were invincible on foot and the Parthians on horseback. What impressed and frightened the Romans was the mobility of their Parthian enemies, especially of the dreaded mounted archers who were able to shoot while riding at full speed. The "Parthian shot" was, and still is, proverbial: the enemy who pretends to flee, and suddenly turns round and aims his deadly arrows at his pursuer. It was as often quoted in literature as depicted in art. After the disastrous defeat at Carrhae (Harran) in 5 3 B.C., the Romans realized the necessity to learn from the enemy and to copy his righting methods. They did it in their usual way, not by reforming the army, but simply by incorporating into it as auxiliaries native troops with their native weapons. Already during the last decades of the Roman republic mounted
Parthian archers fought under Gaius Crassus.1 While this was more or less an isolated case, during the empire the alaePartharum formed an
integral part of the army.2 In one instance we hear even of an ala Parthorum et Arabum. This was in the 1st century of our era. A tombstone with the figure of an officer belonging to it, found at Mainz in Germany, shows that they were not yet protected by heavy mail. Authors of late antiquity have left us vivid descriptions of the horror felt by the Romans when they saw for the first time the Parthian archers
completely encased in armour.3 Flexible mail covered every limb, their faces were hidden behind masks, and even the horses were protected by
mail.4 A dazzling sight when seen glittering in the sunlight, these armies appeared to be invulnerable. As soon as the Romans had recovered from the first shock, they did what independently, but more or less at the same time, the Chinese, and later the Arabs, did: they adopted the Persian system of armour for man and horse. We learn from Roman writers that these horsemen were called clibanarii? The words clibanarii
1 Appian, Civil Wars, iv. 59, 63,
2 These consisted of native Parthians who had either sided with the Romans or been conscripted. On the other hand, the Legio Parthica was so named because it fought in Parthia.
8 Heliodorus, Aethiopica ix. I4ff.; Ammianus Marcellinus xxiv. 6. 8.
4 The latter was not a new invention, as armour for horses had been in use in Persia since Achaemenian times, originally for the horses which drew the war chariots.
8 The Historia Augusta contends that clibanarii was their Persian name (Aelius Lampridius, SeverusAlexander; LVI. 5, in Scriptores Historiae Augustae 11; but cf. Ammianus Marcellinus (xvi. 10. 8) where Persaewas inserted into the text by a 16th-century editor); this has caused much speculation about a possible Iranian term underlying the Latin; see E. Herzfeld,

PARTHIA AND ROME
and the more common cataphractarii were used as synonyms, both for the Persian and theRoman armoured cavalry units, which in appearance anticipated the medieval knights. A third name, and one in which their eastern origin is particularly manifest, was Parthusagittarii, a
detachment of whom was stationed in Egypt in the 4th century.1 Gradually theParthian tactics became thestandard method of warfare in the Roman empire. When in the 6th century A.D. Procopius of Caesarea compared the fighting methods ofthe Homeric age with those of his own time, hestressed the contrast between the archaic warriors on foot and the modern "expert horsemen, who are able without difficulty to direct their bows to either side while riding at full speed, and
to shoot anopponent whether in pursuit or in flight".2 More to thesphere of what would now be termed "psychological warfare" belong the Persian "scythed chariots", fast-moving chariots with rotating scythes designed to mow down the ranks of the enemy. Their frightening effect must always have been greater than their efficiency, and it was apparently the terror they inspired which kept them in use from Achaemenian to Parthian times. Hellenistic rulers like Antiochus Eupator (c. 173-162 B.C.) made use ofthem, as we learn from
the Bible,3 but not so the Romans. When inthe 4th century ofour eraa Latin writer tried toreform the Roman army and much else besides, he
recommended strongly the introduction of this oldPersian device.4 To inspire terror in the ranks ofthe enemy was the original purpose of the Parthian dragon ensigns which were made ofsome light material
so that they would move in the breeze like enormous serpents.5 They were soon taken over by theRoman legions where special draconarii were in charge of them. Theattention paid to these "dragons" by modern historians of aeronautics is not based onany facts; they were neither Chinese gliding kites nor were they filled with hot airand thus the forerunners of modern balloons. What the Romans admired in their enemies, and tried to learn from them, was themobility of their strategy, thesurprise movements of a

fast cavalry. FortheParthians it was exactly theopposite. They were deficient where the Romans excelled, inthe technique of static warfare and especially the art offortification. Like the Romans they were quick
to learn from their enemies.1
TECHNOLOGY
The Romans were outstanding inmany aspects ofcivil engineering and particularly in building technology. In the early 3rd century Shapur I called in Roman masons toerect the large dam atShushtar which served as a reservoir of water for irrigation. The ancient Persian tradition of large-scale hydraulic engineering was thus combined with theunique
Roman experience in masonry.2 The dam is still called Band-i Qaisar. While the Romans were unsurpassed as faras building methods were concerned, they were the pupils ofthe Persians inthe fields ofirrigation and agriculture. Here three particularly far-reaching inventions - the water-wheel, thewater-mill and thewindmill - were probably or certainly made inIran. The na'uraor"Persian wheel" is a wheel (or, in a variant, an endless chain) with pots or buckets attached to it. The rotation of the wheel brings thewater collected at thebottom to the top. It became known in the western world aswell asin China about the beginning of our era and the Iranian countries seem to have been the centre of diffusion. Laufer advanced arguments in favour of Sogdiana as its original home, while Needham thought that it was invented in India. It is worth mentioning that theManichaeans conceived the journey ofthe soul towards the sun asmodelled onthe rotation ofthe na'ura. The water-mill, a na'ura with paddles and operated by a current of water, may also beofIranian origin. There can be nodoubt that the windmill is a Persian invention, but it reached the western world only in the late Middle Ages.
Road-building was, of course, a great Roman achievement, and it is not surprising that the late Latin word strata for apaved road (our word "street") is found as a loan word in Middle Persian, as well as ina
number of other eastern languages.3

PARTHIA AND ROME
In antiquity the post, i.e. the state organization for transmitting orders from andnews to thecourt, was more or less a military institution and based on statute-labour. That the Roman cursus publicus followed thepattern of the Persian state post hasas often been stated as denied. That thePersians were thefirst to create such an institution is undeniable; it was, however, already taken over in hellenistic Egypt. The Islamic world followed not the Sasanian, but the RomanoByzantine organization, even taking over its Latin name {bartd from veredus "courier's horse").
CULTIVATED PLANTS
The Greco-Roman picture of the Persians as a nation of fierce and indomitable warriors contrasts strangely with another stereotype, the
Persians as past masters of the art of refined living, of luxuriose vivere,1 and especially as unsurpassed gourmets. The refinements of Persian cooking were already mentioned by Xenophon, whomust have had
first-hand experience,2 and we know from a Pahlavi text, "King Khusrau andthePage", that the study of gastronomy formed part of the general education of a Persian boy. TheRoman cookery book of Apicius has preserved for ustherecipe for cooking " kid orlamb in the Parthian manner"; ground pepper, rue,onion, stoned damsons and a small quantity ofasafoetida were some of the ingredients. Another dish in Apicius is "chicken in the Parthian manner" which received its
undoubtedly strong flavour from asafoetida.3
Asafoetida, which obviously played such a part in Persian cooking, is a resin which wasmuch appreciated as a condiment in spite of the unpleasant smell which earned it its various uncomplimentary names
(Devil's Dung, etc.).4 The Romans received it from Persia and called it
laser Parthicum, or laser Cyrenaicum vel Parthicum. Thelatter name refers to the fact that the once famous silphicum^ the main product of Cyrenaica, had become excessively rare in Roman times, but the Parthian product was regarded asanadequate substitute. Asafoetida is still listed in thepharmacopoeia, butits medical useis a later development.

CULTIVATED PLANTS
Rhubarb, onthe other hand, which is now considered a table delicacy, was inantiquity and the Middle Ages esteemed exclusively for its medical properties. It became known tothe Greco-Roman world inthe ist and 2nd centuries of our era. It came notdirectly from Iran,but from "beyond theBosporus", a part of the world where Iranian influence was particularly strong.1 Its Greek andRoman names (rheon, rha, etc.) reflect itsindigenous designation (Mid. Pers. revds).
Asafoetida and rhubarb were not the only cultivated plants which the Romans brought from Persia tothe western world. We learn from Pliny that the best kind ofwalnut was called by the Greeks "Persicum"; the Romans spread itscultivation allover Europe.2
The Persian pistachio became known to the Greeks in hellenistic times, butit was first planted in Italy in the ist century of ourera. Although the tree and its fruit are still called by its Persian name (modern pista)y it seems that the tree was introduced into Italy not
directly from Persia, but via the Near East.3
Two other introductions of lasting effect were the peach and the apricot. Both were of Chinese origin and both remained unknown to the Greeks. The Romans learned about them from the Persians and introduced them from Persia and Persian Armenia. We are especially well informed about the introduction tothe west of the peach (Amygdalus persica). Pliny says, "As the name of the peaches (Persica) shows, they areforeign to Asia [Minor] andto Greece, and have been introduced from Persia." The tree was then a newcomer to Italy; noother fruit was sold at such a high price. Soon various species were grown andexperiments were made with grafting. TheGreeks called the tree Me/ea persike, but already in the 2nd century A.D. Galen remarked that the name had been shortened to Persike. The same happened in Latin. Its modern name in most European languages still recalls itsPersian origin.4
Less circumstantial are the reports about the introduction of the apricot (Prunusarmeniaca)y which is believed tohave come via Armenia.5 Galen states that the apricot was notknown to previous generations; in his time the tree aswell as the fruit was called rrpeKOKKcov, which is

the Latin wordpraecocium "early ripe". The cultivation of the tree and
its distinctive Latin name were taken over from theByzantines by the
Arabs (barquq),1and later from the Arabs bywestern Europe where its
modern names (apricot, abricot, etc.) clearly reflect its chequered his
tory by combining its original Latin designation with the Arabic
definite article. On theother hand, thehazelnut came to Persia from thewestand still preserves its foreign namzyfunduq (from TTOVTLKOV). AS thePersians would nothave used a Greek adjective to refer to thePontic regions, which belonged to their empire, thehazelnut and its name must have been brought to them byAramaean or Arabic intermediaries.2
RELIGION
The Persian influence onRoman religion would beenormous, werewe allowed to call Mithraism a Persian religion. It has very often been claimed to be one, as it centres on thecult of an ancient Iranian god. But if ever a Persian had been initiated into the mysteries of Mithraism, it is doubtful if he would have recognized anything familiar to him apart from the name of the godandoneor twowords of its terminology. Mithraism is a western mystery cult which sprang into existence in the last century B.C. and flourished during the first centuries of the Roman empire. Itsadherents were almost exclusively small groups in the Roman army. Renan's famous and too-often quoted dictum "If the world had not become Christian, it would have become Mithraic", implying that at some stage in its history Mithraism was a serious rival to Christianity, is an exaggeration.
The size of the sanctuaries shows that thelocal communities must have been comparatively small. Were it a truly eastern religion, one would expect a particularly strong Iranian element in the sanctuaries of Mithras the nearer we move eastward towards the Persian frontier. Nothing of that kind is noticeable. In the Mithraeum at Dura-Europos some local features are obvious; one of the inscriptions is in Palmyrene and the local Parthian style manifests itself in a fresco painting with Mithras asa hunter, aswell asin the cult reliefs; butthe latter copythe fixed western prototypes, andin all essentials this sanctuary conforms

RELIGION
to those which we find everywhere that Roman soldiers had been
stationed.x The Greek and Roman image of Persian religion and sacred wisdom was largely determined by an enormous body of occult literature written in Greek, in which Babylonian magic and astrology appeared in Persian garb. Already in the time of Pliny a considerable number of books were in existence, the alleged author of which was Zarathustra. Later centuries have added to this ever growing corpus of books on witchcraft, divination, astrology and magical plants and stones. Nothing remains in it of the true Zarathustra, who has become the embodiment of Ahrimanian practices, of the powers of evil. No wonder that the Persian priest, the magus^ gave his name to magic. The interest of the classical world in the religion of Persia was immense; even today the scattered references in Greek and Latin authors and the fragments from lost works constitute a considerable body. But it seems that nobody in antiquity ever tried to separate the true from the fabulous, the orthodox from the heretical, or even Persian religion from Babylonian occultism, it would have been easy enough to
collect correct information, but hardly anybody made the attempt,2 and thus the information provided by Greek and Roman writers gives a picture of utter confusion.
On the other hand, the pseudo-Persian astrological literature of the Parthian period prepared the way for the influx of Greek astrology in the Sasanian period, and its incorporation into the Zoroastrian
scriptures.3

CHAPTER 15
BYZANTIUM AND THE SASANIANS
The nearly four centuries of Sasanian rule which separate the accession of Ardashir I, in the twenties of the 3rd century A.D., from the fall of Yazdgard III,in themiddle of the seventh, have long been viewed as a period of bitter enmity between the Iranian and Roman empires. The rise of the Persian Sasanian dynasty has traditionally been interpreted as the victorious reaction of Oriental resentment against the compromises of the over-hellenized Parthian Arsacids. This interpretation reflects the traditional claim of the Sasanians themselves, that they were the descendants of the ancient kings of Iran, and the notions of the contemporary Romans, who likewise saw the new dynasty as the heir of the Achaemenians, the traditional enemies of the Classical world and
hence of themselves.1 Despite these overt proclamations of hostility, the twoempires survived side by side as acknowledged equals, and the ambiguity of this situation hasbeen reflected in modern scholarship as well. In recent times, a number of scholars, while recognizing the endemic antagonism of the tworivals, have gone on to argue for striking similarities and consequently for reciprocal influence in the court ceremonials, art,military, legal, fiscal, andadministrative institutions of Byzantium and Iran. Some have even gone sofarasto consider seriously the claim occasionally made by mediaeval sources that certain ofthe iater Sasanian rulers: Yazdgard I, Khusrau I Aniishirvan, andespecially Khusrau II Parvez had secretly been converted to Christianity, andto see an irresistible trend toward monotheism in Iran due to Christian
influence but ultimately destined to serve the cause of Islam.2
In view of the ambivalent quality of the evidence andof the fact that almost allthepoints of resemblance andmutual influence arestill being seriously challenged, where they have not been rejected outright; finally, because influence has too often been postulated on the basis of

CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION
logical similarities rather than ondemonstrable historical contact; many aspects of Byzantine-Sasanian relations must perforce remain open at the present time. The entire question should bereviewed cautiously so as to take stock of ourknowledge before proceeding anyfurther into hypothesis, no matter how tempting. It seems wisest, therefore, to advance step by step clearing the ground as we go. First, to trace the possible channels of transmission for techniques and ideas from one realm to theother. Then, to examine theevidence that the traditional enemies were acquainted with each other's customs and institutions and that they acknowledged their mutual existence. Only at that point should we be able to raise the question of the demonstrability and degree of reciprocal influence. Least often considered, theexistence of contacts and means of transmission isthe aspect ofthe problem most easily documented. There can be little doubt that enmity did not isolate thetwoempires from each other. The frontier was gradually rigidified over thecenturies through the elimination of the hybrid semi-autonomous Syro-Mesopotamian border states, such asPalmyra, Hatra, and Edessa bythe end ofthe3rd century, through the partition ofthe buffer kingdom ofArmenia in387, and the final absorption of the autonomous satrapies along the Euphrates-Arsanias, as a result of Justinian's restructuring of the
administration of his Armenian territories in 536.1 Similar results were obtained through theemperor's reconstruction of the elaborate system of border fortifications andthe Persian counter-measures recorded in Procopius' contemporary treatise ontheimperial "Buildings". Nevertheless, this gradual tightening never achieved anything approaching a hermetic separation. Warfare inthe period with which we are concerned was nota matter of static operations butof fluid raid andcounter raid which carried the Persian armies toAntioch, Jerusalem, and the suburbs of Constantinople, and Byzantine retaliations to the vicinity ofthe Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. Hence, both armies had ample opportunity to familiarize themselves with enemy territory. As a consequence of the fortunes of war, the intermediary border zone, including the frontier cities ofDara, Amida, and Nisibis, aswell asa considerable portion of bisected Armenia, found itself alternately under Persian and Byzantine domination. A common language - Armenian in the north, Syriac in thesouth - and identical customs prevailed on either side of the frontier, linking together related populations split asunder by

political accidents. The Syriac-speaking bishops of imperial Mesopotamia orOsrohene understood their Persian counterparts in Nisibis or Seleucia-Ctesiphon farbetter than their Greek colleagues inwhose
councils they could participate only through interpreters.1 Sofluid were parts ofthe border until the implementation ofJustinian's extensive programme that Procopius could still recall a time when "the inhabitants of this region, whether subjects of the Romans or of the Persians, [had] no fear of each other . . . they even intermarry and hold a common market fortheir produce and together share the laboursof
farming".2 Subsequent agreements steadily restrained additions to
existing fortifications.3
Beyond the immediate frontier zone, superficial knowledge was supplemented byexchanges of population. Prisoners were ransomed during periodic truces and peace negotiations. Vast numbers ofSyrians were uprooted by Shapur I, Shapur II, and Khusrau I to be forcibly resettled in thenew cities of Gundeshapur or Veh-Ardashir which required a skilled population, while silk workers ruined bythe state monopoly in the days of Justinian are said to have migrated voluntarily to Persia insearch ofemployment, and other artisans were sent by the
Byzantine emperor himself to work on the palace of Ctesiphon.4 Greek mason's marks on the monuments of Shapur I's residence at Bishapur attest the presence ofsuch workmen, and the descendantsof deported artisans and traders were occasionally to reach positions of
considerable importance insubsequent centuries.5 Persian mercenaries were tobe found inthe imperial armies, and the presence ofMazdeans on Byzantine territory is revealed by theclauses guaranteeing their
religious freedom incorporated in peace treaties.6 As for Christian refugees, persecution drove them from both sides ofthe frontier atthe mercy of recrudescences of Zoroastrian intolerance or of enforced Constantinopolitan official orthodoxy directed against dissident hereti
cal groups.7
The status of foreigners was notrestricted to thelower strata of society but reached all the way tocourt circles where they might affect

foreign healers preserved in theDenkart.1 The presence of Christian wives in theharem of the king of kings and theasylum granted by Khusrau I tothe pagan philosophers driven from Athens by Justinian's closing of the Platonic Academy in 5 29 are balanced bythe welcome extended at theimperial court to Sasanian pretenders or to thedistinguished ecclesiastical scholar, Paul the Persian, who expoundedhis doctrinal views in the presence ofthe emperor Justin I and instructed high Byzantine officials before his return to his native land, presumably
to assume the function ofmetropolitan ofNisibis.2
Additional means of communication were provided byperiodically re-confirmed trade agreements. These affected most particularly the all important trade in Chinese raw silk, required forthe Byzantine luxury industries supplying the court, over which the Sasanians kept absolute monopoly, despite various imperial diplomatic attempts to by-pass their control, until thesilk cocoons were finally smuggled into Syria
and acclimatized there after 5 5 z.3 To besure, these contacts were normally reduced to a fewfrontier cities in which thecustoms bureaus were located and duty collected: Callinicum on the Roman side, Nisibis in Mesopotamia and Artaxata ofArmenia for the Persian territory, and
merchants were forbidden to circulate elsewhere forsecurity reasons.4 Even so, some relations with the natives must have been established, since inthe 6th century Byzantine agents acted in conjunction with Persian traders. Ata more official level, the peace treaty of 561 stipulated for joint commissions supervising cases ofcontraband or international
litigations.5

re-settlement policies. Mesopotamian bishops were regularly used as plenipotentiaries byboth sides and seized the occasion of ransoming their coreligionists and of maintaining their contacts with communities lying over the border.1 Christian clerics from Persia such as the future patriarch ofSeleucia-Ctesiphon, Mar 'Aba, the creator of the Armenian alphabet, Mesrop Mastocc, orthe Armenian savant, Ananias Sirakacci, travelled to Constantinople to learn Greek and perfect their education.2 Meanwhile, theOrthodox, Nestorians, andMonophysites travelled back and forth proselytizing and ordaining bishops forforeign sees.3 We have already noted that persecuted minorities systematically sought haven in enemy territory. The most significant such move from an intellectual point of view resulted from the closing, ordered on doctrinal grounds by the emperor Zeno in 489, ofthe great theological "School of the Persians" located at Edessa. Theimperial decree directed against the spread of Nestorian beliefs unacceptable to the Byzantine court shifted the intellectual and spiritual centre of Nestorian Christianity toPersian Nisibis, where the exiled scholars settled to re-create their famous seat of learning, to translate Greek religious and philosophical texts, and to found local schools throughout thearea. Of similar importance was the great medical school founded by Nestorian refugees atGundeshapur, which was tooutlive the Sasanian state.4 The ties linking the Christian communities together were so close that they repeatedly ledthe Persian authorities to regard them, probably with good reason, as potentially disloyal nests of spies and imperial informers. All the repeated attempts ofthe official Nestorian Churchof Persia to dissociate itself from Byzantium and stress its disagreements with Constantinopolitan doctrine, all the protestations by Persian church councils of their loyalty to the king of kings failed to break altogether the accepted equation ofChristian with Byzantine supporter and to disabuse the Sasanian authorities. Persecution normally followed the resumption ofhostilities between the two empires.5

At thehighest official level, reciprocal contacts were maintained by means of an elaborate diplomatic protocol. Embassies moved constantly back andforth not only to discuss truces andnegotiate peace treaties, butalso to bring formal notification of new accessions even in time of war. These ambassadors were normally received with elaborate courtesy, so that a failure to observe the normal ceremonial was regarded as a deliberate act of defiance.1 The negotiations often took place on theborder, but a clause of the peace treaty of 5 61 stipulated that envoys should be sped on their way by means of the public post system maintained by both realms, and distinguished personages suchas Khusrau Fsrepresentative, Yazd-Gushnasp, orthe Byzantine master of offices, Peter the Patrician, were singled out for special favour at the court of the sovereigns to whom they were accredited.2 Cooperative action was taken by bi-partisan trade and judicial commissions, and provisions were made for the joint defence of the Caucasian passes against the incursions of northern nomads threatening both realms. Bilingual corps of interpreters verified the accuracy of the texts of treaties consigned to both powers. The glimpse we aregiven into the make-up of the frontier commissions indicates that they provided a common ground where local dignitaries including the Persian governor, the Byzantine commander in chief of the district, and local bishops might meet to settle points of disagreement, necessarily becoming acquainted in the process.3 Theclosest and best example of bilateral cooperation is afforded by the sojourn of Khusrau II on Byzantine territory, when thefugitive prince metwith an honourable reception and support, exchanged reciprocal courtesies with the emperor Maurice, and was ultimately setback onhis throne through joint military operations. In sign of gratitude for thehelp he had received, theyoung Persian king wasto dedicate gifts bearing Greek inscriptions at the imperial shrine of Saint Sergius of Resapha through theintermediary of the bishop ofAntioch, who accepted these offerings with the permission of Constantinople.4

the Byzantino-Sasanian epoch merely as oneof hostile isolationand continuous wars. N o doubt, theinstances of direct contact which we have enumerated were largely limited to the frontier zone or to official exchanges and to the Christian communities. Travel within the two empires was severely restricted and supervised even in the case of ambassadors orofKhusrau II himself, whose attendance atall times by an imperial bodyguard andprevention from a visit to Constantinople is suggestive of honourable protective custody.1 Diplomatic exchanges had to be filtered through thedistorting medium of translation. And yet, for all the antagonism and suspicion present, channels of transmission were available most of the time, thefrontier was in no sense hermetic, and an official modusvivendi had been elaborated betweenthe two great rivals.
As a result of the interpenetration of the Iranian and Byzantine worlds, evidence of their familiarity with each other's beliefs and institutions canbe traced back to an early period. Even where the trustworthiness of a particular author has occasionally been impugned,the general tone ofthe contemporary accounts isprimarily historical rather than mythological, whatever maybe the fantasies of later writers. Immediately after the accession ofArdashir I, his Roman opponents do not seem to have grasped the full significance of the Sasanian coup d'etat, but this ignorance did not last. By the fourth century the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus was usually accurately acquainted with the names ofPersian rulers, generals, and provincial governors,as well aswith the administrative divisions ofthe Sasanian empire. In one case atleast, his information must bebased ondirect experience oreyewitness accounts since his description of the decoration of Persian palaces with hunting scenes is fully borne out by archaeological evidence.2 Thehistorians of the period of Justinian were equally well informed concerning the realm of Khusrau I, despite occasional errors. In particular Agathias hadapparently been able to make use of the material kept in the Persian royal archives through the good offices of the interpreter ofthe king ofkings who transmitted the information to him. Eastern magi onimperial monuments wear correct Iranian dress.3

Our knowledge ofthe hereditary offices ofthe Sasanian state rest ultimately as much on thetestimony of the seventh century Byzantine historian Theophylakt Simokattes, who apparently likewise had a Persian informant, as on the fragmentary Persian data.1 Practical details seem to have received asmuch attention asmore exalted subjects. In the 4th century the Byzantine itinerary map known as the Tabula Peutingeriana recorded the main routes ofthe Sasanian empire together with the relays tobe found on them and the distances indicated inPersian parasangs rather than Roman miles. Three centuries later, the Pers-Armenian scholar Anania Sirakacci, who was familiar with the geographic andmathematical works of the Hellenistic Alexandrian schools through his studies in Constantinople, gave conversion tables for Byzantine and Sasanian weights and measures.2
Ecclesiastical information was understandably extensive. By 410, at the time of its official recognition, the Christian Church of Persia was accurately informed concerning Orthodox canon lawandthe early ecclesiastical councils held on imperial territory. Through the medium of the School ofNisibis, the extensive writings ofthe great theologian Theodore of Mopsuestia, first accepted asorthodox by the Councilof Chalcedon, but subsequently condemned by the Justinianic Councilof the "Three Chapters" and consequently considered the fountainhead of Nestorian theology, aswell asother Greek dogmatic and scientific works, were steadily translated into Syriac and made available to the Sasanian world.3 The lives ofthe Persian martyrs were familiar to their coreligionists in Byzantine lands who enshrined their deeds in biographies and hymns inwhich inaccuracies seem tobe the result ofconformity to hagiographic epic and miraculous conventions rather than to misinformation, since they show considerable acquaintance with the realities of Sasanian society.4
Our knowledge of the precise level of Persian information onByzantium is unfortunately limited by the extreme scarcity of true Sasanian sources andby the romantic semi-legendary character of the later accounts embodied in the Shdh-ndma and the historical romances. Even so, the accuracy ofthe great trilingual victory inscription of Shapur I

on theso-called Ka'ba-yi Zardusht, oneof whose versions was still written inGreek, with its correct identification ofthe Roman emperors Gordian, Philip theArab, andValerian in a period of the mid-third century, when the information of Latin historians on Sasanian affairs was still very hazy, and the exact portrayal of Roman figures on Shapur Fsvictory reliefs, allsuggest that the quality of Persian infor
mation probably ceded nothing to that of the Romans.1 Shapur's inscription may still curtly refer on occasion to thedefeated Roman emperor as "Caesar" without further identification, buta familiarity, reaching considerably beyond generalities, with the intricate formulae of imperial chancery protocol is evidenced in the obvious echo of official Byzantine titulature which heads Khusrau IFsletter to the emperor
Maurice.2 The court of the king of kings even seems to have been acquainted with thecoronation ritual of Constantinople, if we are to believe the contemporary account that this was the ceremonial used for the young pretender whom Khusrau II sponsored as thesonof the
murdered emperor Maurice.3 As in the case of co-operative action, Persian inquiries into foreign techniques and beliefs received sanction from onhigh. Shapur I sought Byzantine artisans forhis monuments and cities and ordered asearch for Greek scientific works, which he had
incorporated into the canonical scriptures.4 Khusrau I studied the works ofGreek philosophers and encouraged translations and digests, as did the Constantinopolitan court inthe case ofcommentaries onthe
Christian scriptures produced bythe Persian School ofNisibis.5
Byzantium and Iran did not stop atthe mere accumulation of information on their respective societies. They saw themselves not as fortuitous neighbours but as the only twogreat powers in an otherwise uncivilized world, as the normal complements in a well ordered and equilibrated universe. In doing this, they perforce acknowledged each other as equal. This concept was formally expressed in Khusrau IFs famous letter tothe emperor Maurice: "Two eyes has divine regulation granted to the world from the beginning in order toilluminate it: the mighty empire ofthe Romans and the realm of the Persians governed by thewisest rulers. In these two great powers restless andwarlike

nations are reduced tonaught and the lives of men are ever ordered and
ruled."1 The same sentiments were to be repeated to theemperor in person bythe Persian ambassadors: "Itis impossible fora single empire to take upon itself the innumerable concerns forthe order of the world and tosucceed in ruling all the peoples upon whom the sun looks down with the single oar of its wisdom..."; they were still remembered in the late Iranian tradition reflected in the Shdh-ndma? This equality was scrupulously underlined by the diplomatic protocol whereby the twosovereigns ceremoniously addressed each other as
"my brother'*.3 When speaking of the Persian ruler, Byzantine historians respectfully used thefull imperial title of basileus, which was gradually acquiring a supernatural aura at Constantinople in the 7th century, rather than any of the lesser formulae reserved for barbarian kings. Even inthe distant west, Latin authors referred to the Kingof Kings as "imperatorPersarum", and not bythe more common titleof rex* Ina moment ofcrisis, Khusrau II stretched courtesy sofaras to style himself in his letter Maurice's "son and suppliant". If we credit the late testimony of the patriarch Michael the Syrian, writing in the twelfth century on the basis ofearlier sources, Khusrau II even put the Persian court into official mourning upon receiving the news of Maurice's assassination, and subsequently arrogated tohimself the role of the murdered emperor's avenger together with the protection of his
purported son, the false Theodosius.5
The semi-legendary traditions which gradually clustered around the figures of the great imperial rivals likewise preserved a sense of their close ties based on ultimately similar superhuman backgrounds and mutual concern. The possibility of adoption from one imperial houseto the other is repeatedly raised bythesources. The emperor Arcadius, fearing forthe safety ofhis infant son, Theodosius II,is said to have entrusted him onhis death in 408 to the guardianship of Yazdgard I, who accepted this responsibility and watched from afar over the welfare of the little emperor through the intermediary of trusted agents, until his own death in 421. On the contrary, we are told that the request of king Kavadh I that Justin I reciprocate one century later by adopting the king's favourite son, the future Khusrau I, was turned aside by the

imperial authorities.1 Two generations later, aswe have already seen, Khusrau IIreferred to himself officially as Maurice's "son", a relation
ship apparently accepted by the Byzantine emperor.2 Equally interesting is thestory of Khusrau II'spurported marriage to a daughter of Maurice named Maria, a tale which was to have a great vogue in Oriental literature based onIranian traditions and which we find expanded into an extended romantic episode inthe Shah-nama? The accuracy of these tales isnot their most important aspect for us here. At best, the entrusting of Theodosius IIto the care of Yazdgard I was a diplomatic courtesy which could not be juridically binding since the boy had already been crowned inhis father's lifetime and conse
quently, as areigning emperor, could have no legal tutor set over him.4 Moreover, the arguments against the adoption of young Khusrau I, which Procopius puts into the mouth ofJustin Fs advisers, reject the possibility ofa true adoption inthe case ofa foreigner. Still more improbable, and now generally discredited, is the fictitious tale of the marriage ofMaria "Caesar's daughter" to the King ofKings, which Byzantine historians significantly ignore altogether despite its later popularity in the East. Khusrau II may well have had a Greek girl named Maria among the Christian women ofhis harem, since she is known to contemporary Syrian sources, but Byzantine protocol expressly opposed the marriage of imperial princesses outside the realm. We know of no such case up to the 7th century, and the elaborate later explanations that the princesses granted to foreigners were not truly
legitimate indicate that this principle was generally obeyed.5 The real significance ofthese dubious tales inthe context ofthis investigation lies in their underlying assumption, evidently fully shared by both societies, that the rulers of Iran and Byzantium were of similar rank and nature and consequently might fittingly become related by adoption or marriage. In view of the supernatural aura which surrounded both these monarchs, the possibility ofsuch unions gave tacit religious,as well as intellectual and political, sanction tothe belief in their essential equality.

II
From the material which we have examined so far, it seems reasonably warranted to accept the existence of constant contacts as well as of reciprocal awareness and recognition between the Byzantine and Iranian worlds. The propitious climate forthe interpenetration ofthe two great contemporary societies was seemingly present. Under these circumstances, we should reasonably expect to find considerable proof of clear cases ofinfluence from one civilization tothe other. And yet, uncontrovertible evidence of such influence unexpectedly remains rather disappointing to date. The tendency of more recent scholarship in many areas has been to query relationships postulated or accepted by earlier generations rather than to intensify them. This may benomore than a passing phase resulting from an acknowledgement of the still highly unsatisfactory level of our information, but the time does not yet seem to have come for a definitive demonstration of direct and fundamental influence from either side. Superficial borrowings can beattested on a number ofoccasions, still unconnected parallels have often been noted, and several tempting hypotheses presented, but these are scarcely sufficient to support a thesis of massive or significant impact.
At a purely technical level interchanges can often be observed, particularly inthe military sphere where the almost continuous state ofwar constantly tested defences and forced the adoption ofsimilar tacticsfor survival. It seems likely that the late Roman armies, traditionally based on theinfantry legions, acquired for obvious reasons corps of heavily armoured cavalry, the cataphracti or clibanariiy whocorresponded to similar formations in the Sasanian forces, though even here the probability of a gradual modification within the Roman system as the result of centuries of wars against the Parthians, rather than a direct borrowing in the 3rd century, has recently been suggested. It may also be advisable to remember that the armament ofthe two armies was not identical: the all-important bow, the characteristic weapon of Persia from antiquity, came into increasingly greater use in the imperial armies, butthe Sasanian weapon was considerably lighter andconsequently less penetrating than theone used by Byzantine archers, who may therefore have developed their particular technique inwars against other peoples.1 In theopposite direction, poliorcetic devices, such as

TECHNICAL EXCHANGES
rams, balistae,and movable towers, aswell asvarious systems of fortifications, were apparently borrowed by the Persians from the Romans, so that the defence methods of the Sasanians were greatly superior to those ofthe Arsacids. Khusrau I built anelaborate system of fortifications running parallel to Justinian's reconstruction of the imperial limes, andthe armies of the tworivals were probably quite evenly matched, thus causing the essential stability of the frontier until the 7th century, despite occasional successful raids deep into the interior.1 When, however, weturn away from purely practical aspects of weaponry to less tangible effects, the evidence becomes even less conclusive. At the beginning ofthe present century, Inostrantsev argued persuasively that the theories of Sasanian tacticians, which we find preserved in later works, had been inspired by Byzantine strategical treatises, thus showing a definite literary as well as concrete filiation between the two. This theory has been widely accepted since.2 Nevertheless, many of the postulated similarities between Iranian tactics and those recommended by such Greek works as the Strategikon attributed to the emperor Maurice, need notalways derive from a deliberate literary imitation. The drawing up of battle lines with soldiers facing away from the sun, or theprecaution of laying in ample supplies in times of siegecan surely be attributed as much tocommon sense asto foreign influence.3 On a similar technical level, thesojourn of Roman prisonersand artisans in Iran and their occasional return home hassupported the tracing of their influence in various forms of minor arts. There seems to be little reason to doubt that Romans worked on the famous "Caesar's" dam at Shushtar oronthe monuments ofBishapur, whose mosaics show unmistakable western affinities both in style and in the technique itself, which is characteristically classical and foreign to the Iranian tradition. Evidence oftheir work has likewise been observed on most of the other monuments of Shapur I's favourite residence. The materials and workmen sent by Justinian I to work on the palace of Khusrau I atCtesiphon have also left marks of their passage.4Dionysiac motifs appeared inIranian silver and the outstanding quality of Roman glassworks directly orindirectly stimulated Sasanian competition. The highly developed silk working techniques forwhich Syria was famous

were apparently imported into Iran, turning thecountry from its position of middleman for the raw material into a potential rival for the imperial industries.1 Reciprocally, Sasanian influence has long been acknowledged in a number of decorative motifs in Byzantine architecture, in Antiochene mosaics, and particularly in the splendid figured silks covered with real and fabulous animals which were to carry the fame of imperial workshops all theway to western Europe.2
At a higher, more purely artistic level however, the opinion of scholars becomes sharply divided. The powerful impact of Greek art on Sasanian Persia and vice versa: theParthian origin of hieratic frontality in late Roman and Byzantine portraits, the indebtedness of Sasanian bas-reliefs to Roman models, even the controversial hypothesis of the presence ofa Persian domed prototype lying inthe background of much of Byzantine architecture, among others, have found ardent champions to this day. Without attempting to raise here themultiple thorny problems of Irano-Byzantine art, which will find a fuller treatment elsewhere in this work,3 or of the tantalizing "Oriental" elements which abound in Western Romanesque architecture, which also liebeyondthe scope of this chapter, it may be worth mentioning that a note of caution has been sounded by scholars working on either side ofthe frontier. Differences in building techniques and architectural principles, the absence of traceable links between eastern and western monuments of a similar type, the possibility of internal evolution on the basis of native traditions rather than foreign contact, the need to evaluate recent archaeological discoveries, while in no wayinvalidating the thesis of artistic interrelations, all suggest nevertheless the need for another serious re-examination of the evidence andconsequently of the nature and degree of reciprocal influence.4
In intellectual matters, Persia proved far more curious andreceptive than Byzantium, so that thevisible current is unmistakably one-sided. The imagination of Iran was struck by the figures and events ofthe land of "Rum", which play so large a part in theepic tradition of the Shdh-ndma,andin theromantic literature,5 butthesame cannot be said

of Constantinople. Except its unavoidable inclusion into historical and geographical accounts orpatriotic poems, for a concern with the lives of Persian martyrs, and for its possible role inthe transmission of the didactic Buddhist tale of"Barlaam and Joasaph" by way of Christian Syria orthe Caucasus, Persia remains strangely absent from Byzantine literature.1 The same lopsided pattern is observable in more scholarly works. Greek scientific and philosophical treatises of the Hellenistic and Neo-Platonic schools, the works ofPlato, Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Porphyry were translated in Iran under the auspices of Shapur I and Khusrau I, or at theChristian schools of Nisibis and Gundeshapur whence they were eventually transmitted to Islam and then passed back to the west.2 Despite Agathias' sneers atKhusrau's classical scholarship and intellectual pretensions, Greek philosophy was unquestionably appreciated and tosome degree assimilated by the Persians, who introduced it even into their sacred scriptures. Traces of Aristotelian concepts ofcosmology and ofhis doctrines ofmatter, form, and the mean are evidently present inparts ofthe Zoroastrian tradition even where they are not always suited totheir new surroundings. The inclusion of foreign scientific material is explicitly acknowledged by the Denkart? The influence of Neo-Platonic thought has also been claimed for the religio-socialist Mazdakite movement which convulsed Iran in the days of Kavad I.These ideas would presumably have been brought inmuch earlier by a certain Bundos who had lived in Rome at thetime of Diocletian before coming to Iran. In this case, the unbridged gap of two centuries between Bundos' journey and Mazdak's proselytizing, and the far clearer relationship between Mazdakism and Manichaean ideas current inIran since the third century had led to the challenge of this thesis, though not of the presence of Neo-Platonic works among the Greek books found in the Sasanian realm.4 But noequivalent interest in Zoroastrian thought can beobserved in Byzantium whose intellectual tradition, be it artistic or scientific, remained rigidly Hellenic and Christian. Atthe same time, if we look more closely at the sourcesof

Greek influence on Persian intellectual andspiritual life, it becomes immediately evident that this influence can properly be called Byzantine only in sofarasit was presumably transmitted to Persia inthe daysof the Sasanians, if we accept the late testimony of the Denkart. In content, the Greek works studied in Iran from the 3rd to the 7th century were exclusively Hellenistic. In this sense they were cutofffrom the contemporary deeply Christian Byzantine civilization both onchronological and religious grounds. The reading of these works in the schools ofConstantinople and Ctesiphon may indicate parallel development but not necessarily intellectual communications, since they remained to a considerable degree extraneous to both traditions and derived from a distant past.
When we shift to a consideration of the Christian communities through which theinfluence of orthodox Constantinople should properly have been exerted, thesituation alters in form butnotreally in essence. Wehave already said that constant connections were maintained among the Christian groups living oneither side ofthe frontier and that theological works were actively translated into Syriac. Such activities do notin themselves, however, automatically imply the extensive rapports with either capital which would have made of these communities a significant link between the two civilizations. The official church of Persia from its recognition in 410 to the end of the Sasanian dynasty wasNestorian in confession, though its doctrinal rivals, theMonophysites, had established themselves in Armenia and made serious inroads elsewhere bythe 7th century. But in the eyesof Constantinople, the Nestorians in431 and the Monophysites in451 had been condemned as heretics by oecumenical councils. As such, they were both cutofffrom orthodox church circles, subject to legal sanctions andsevere persecution, andin many cases, such as that of the School of the Persians, they preferred the jurisdiction of the King of Kings tothat ofthe emperor. They might maintain their relations with their coreligionists in Armenia, Antioch, or Alexandria, butnot with imperial Constantinople whose language was not theirs traditionally or liturgically, andwhere even the head of the Persian church on an official mission might find himself in serious difficulties if he did not compromise with hisconscience and accept compulsory communion with the orthodox patriarch.1
On the other side of the frontier, thestatus of Christians remained

RELIGIOUS RELATIONS
precarious despite their avowals ofloyalty, effusive praise ofthe king, and periodic proclamations of toleration. Toomuch should not be made ofthe wishful thinking of distant authors who attributed Christian beliefs to some of the Persian rulers. Zoroastrianism was and remained thestate religion of Iran under the Sasanians, and apostasy from Mazdaism was forbidden andseverely punished. Some of the repressive measures directed against theChristians were undoubtedly precipitated bytheir intrigues with Byzantium or by internal dissentions, butthe King of Kings did notand could notnormally favour Christianity inany serious sense. As the guardian ofthe state religion, he would have undercut his authority and endangered his positionby such a policy. Hormizd IV, wishing to repress the too-powerful Magians, may have answered them that his throne has need ofits back as well as its front feet; Procopius could praise from afar thehighmindedness of Yazdgard I acentury earlier; Maurice's emissary, bishop Domitian of Melitene, might flatter himself that he would convert young Khusrau II; the steady chronological synchronization between Christian persecution and the renewals of the Byzantine war makeall too patent the purely political aspects ofroyal tolerance inIran. Christians for the King of Kings were either useful or potentially disloyal subjects, their beliefs were of no real interest to him, and the conversion of Persians, as against Syrians and other minority groups, remained rare
and severely repressed.1
With the dissociation of the Persian church from Constantinople following their doctrinal split, the period of mass persecutions which had marked the reigns ofShapiir IIand Yazdgard IIinthe 4th and 5 th centuries came to an end. The status of Christians improved perceptibly. But even in thecase of Maurice's "adopted son" Khusrau II, there isno reason for believing in a crypto-conversion, which belongs to a romantic Christian mythology andis explicitly rejected by the Iranian tradition in the Shah-nama* Neither the patriarch of Constantinople, John theFaster, norpope Gregory the Great took the intentions ofthe young king during his sojourn on Byzantine territory seriously. His famous gifts to Saint Sergius ofResapha, made ata time when Khusrau's reconquest of his throne depended on Maurice's favour, suggest little more than opportunism or a superstitious desireto

placate all powers, supernatural as well as worldly, which is amply illustrated by the king's simultaneous building of churches and fire temples.1 After Maurice's death in 602 and the exploitation of his friendship to the murdered emperor toresume the Byzantine war, Khusrau returned to the normal pattern ofalternate toleration and repression. The personal favour ofthe king was extended tocertain individuals, Christians were found in high places and even in theroyal household, but the romantic aura surrounding the figure ofKhusrau's Christian favourite Shlrin and the tales of her power in the state have occasionally overshadowed the martyrdom of important Christian officials and bishops in the same period. The most that imperial negotiations could obtainat the height of Byzantine-Sasanian co-operation in 591 was an edict of toleration on thebasis of the status quo forbidding all proselytizing. Neither theenforced vacancy of the patriarchal throne of SeleuciaCtesiphon between 609 and 628, nor the sack ofJerusalem in614 with its removal to Persia of the relic of the True Cross, nor the fear expressed by theSyrian clergy that Khusrau II intended to extirpate their church, nor finally their relief at his death, argue forthe favourable dispositions of the King of Kings.2
In no real sense, therefore, can we postulate agradual christianization of the Sasanian empire which might betaken as anindication of the influence of its Greek neighbour. O n the contrary, the Syrianand Armenian Christians never appreciably infiltrated into the Iranian core of the empire, and, simultaneously, they fared best within it when their beliefs hadmade them personaenon gratae at Constantinople. Consequently, throughout theSasanian period Armeno-Syrian Christianity maintained a sort ofextraterritoriality in both realms. Their communities clung together and shared information, but these interchanges did not extend far outside their boundaries or have serious effect on the ruling establishments. Those communities may perhaps betaken as a remnant of the hybrid third world which had disappeared politically with the clarification of the Irano-Byzantine frontier and the elimination ofthe local dynasties, but as such they lay outside the mainstream of both civilizations. The same may incidentally besaid of the Manichaeans who, despite their syncretism of Christian and Iranian beliefs, were equally abhorrent to Byzantium, whose militant orthodoxy was

Some of the most elaborate theses of interaction between Byzantium and Iran have been concerned with thegovernmental institutions of both empires: theindebtedness of Iranian legal thinking andof the great taxreform of Khusrau I in the6thcentury to late Roman and Byzantine models, and reciprocally, the imitation of Sasanian court ceremonial by Diocletian and his successors, orthe effect ofthe military and administrative re-structuring which accompanied Khusrau I's fiscal policy on the developing pattern of Byzantine provincial administration in which military and civilian powers were reunited inthe units known as themes. But even in this area, where considerable work has already been done, the evidence remains inconclusive or tends toward a decrease rather than a stress onthe importance offoreign factors.
The similarities recently postulated between thesummary codifications inbooks eight and nine ofthe Denkart orthe collection ofjuridical decisions composing the Mdttgdn i ha^dr ddtastdn (" The Book of a Thousand Judgements") and Roman legislation rest on unsatisfactory Persian texts presenting such exceptional problems of translation and interpretation, and such serious divergences inform and spirit from the Roman legal tradition, that they cannot at present provide sufficient bases for conclusions.2 The thesis presented by Pigulevskaia and Altheim that the fiscal-poll and land tax-reform ofKhusrau I described by Tabari was based onthe system introduced into the Roman empire by Diocletian rests oninsufficient evidence.3 Ashas been observed by Pigulevskaia herself, theparticular parallel to theIranian tax system cannot be found in anyRoman imperial legislation, with the sole

exception of a single title inthe so-called "Roman-Syrian Law-code", whose origin and date areopen to considerable controversy, and of which no Pahlavi translation is known tohave existed. The cited fiscal terminology, presumably showing aGreek derivation, in the Babylonian Talmudis not entirely conclusive, while the pattern ofthe tax payments in three instalments found inByzantium as well as Iran istoo common
to beprobative.1 Still more seriously, economic historians of the late Roman empire have expressed increasing doubts as to our knowledge of the Diocletianic tax system, and voiced the opinion that the patternof taxation was not uniformly applied throughout his empire but varied
from province toprovince.2 Furthermore, the particular system characteristic ofSyria inthe Diocletianic pattern isthe very one found bothin
the "Roman-Syrian Law-code" and in the new Sasanian institution.3 Hence, there seem to be reasonable grounds for thinking that Khusrau's tax structure was simply a continuation oflocal Syrian traditions, not only adopted by the Sasanians, butsurviving and flourishing under Islam, rather than the importation and copy of a general late Roman model which we cannot asyet identify with precision.
In the case of the court ceremonial, the extensive demonstration given byAlfoldi hasshown that theinnovations attributed to Diocletian have a long train ofprecedents inthe Roman imperial tradition. Consequently, while early 4thcentury imperial protocol unquestionably contained numerous oriental elements, ashad been the case inthe Hellenistic monarchies, these cannot be reduced toa simple borrowing
of Sasanian ritual inthis period.4 Finally, the parallel drawn by Stein between the system of military administration attributed to Khusrau I, whereby the supreme high command ofthe Iranian army was divided between four commanders, or spdhbads, and soldiers were granted land along the borders in return for military service, while at the same time the authority of the prime minister, thevu^urg framaddr, gradually declined; and the Byzantine theme system ofthe 7th century inwhich the formerly divided civilian

and military administration of the province was replaced by military districts, whose commanders simultaneously holding civilian powers replaced the paramount authority ofthe praetorian prefect, and whose armies were composed of local recruits granted small landholdings against service inthe army; has been decisively rejected by the majority
of Byzantine scholars.1 Without attempting to raise here the vexata quaestio ofthe origin ofthe imperial theme system, which has provoked so much controversy inrecent years, it will be possible tonote that the painstaking demonstrations already given that the thematic pattern was not a sudden innovation bythe emperor Heraclius or his successors, before orafter the great Persian campaign of 622-9, but a long drawn out evolution reaching back to late Roman times, militates against the
possibility of deliberate imitation. 2Nor isthe parallel between the two administrative systems as close as would appear at first glance. The equation between the loss ofprestige ofthe Sasanian vuzurg framadar and thegradual elimination of the Roman praetorian prefect can be made only if we abstract the fact that Iran boasted a single prime minister while Diocletian had established four prefects forthe empire. Similarly, the presence inByzantium ofinitially four (or perhaps three) themes before the system was spread to the entire imperial territory is not identical with Khusrau Fs division of his whole realm into four quarters each under the command of a spahbad. Lastly, Lemerle and Karayannopoulos' reminder that we have as yet no evidence whatsoever for the existence of soldier-farmers in Byzantium before the 10th century challenges theallimportant association between the administrative pattern of the themes emerging in the7thcentury andlocal
recruiting.3 Thus, none of the explanations recently presented for the development of themes on Byzantine territory can any longer be brought into agreement with Stein's postulated Iranian model. Innone of the administrative institutions of the two states can we, therefore, observe at present a clear cut case ofimitation orborrowing. Nor can the recent Marxist interpretation of a similar stage of feudal development simultaneously reached by the twosocieties andproviding a basis fortheir equation be reconciled with the centralized bureaucratic

structure characteristic of the Byzantine empire until long after the
7th century.1
In retrospect, thechallenge of so many supposed points of coincidence has left usa degree oftraceable influence between the two world powers of the early Middle Ages which is farless extensive than could be expected from the clear evidence of their mutual contact and recognition. Technical borrowing was undoubtedly carried on among craftsmen and military tacticians. Reciprocal artistic reactions seem manifest even where their precise course needs further clarification, though the fundamental traditions often remained divergent beneath the surface. Intellectual relations, particularly in the more strictly scientific andscholarly areas, undoubtedly took place, but they were altogether one-sided andcuriously anachronistic in content. The evidence for parallel administrative institutions is inconclusive at best. Relatively little Christian penetration into thetruly Iranian world, as distinct from theSyro-Armenian border society, can be shown. All in all, thedegree of reciprocity is low and its quality often superficial.
We canonly speculate on thereasons for this rather disappointing showing. Many ofthe more obvious parallels inbeliefs and institutions between the two states: the theory ofthe absolute centralized monarchy with supernatural overtones, the concept of religion in terms of an official state church, the increasing militarization of the state, are all explicable in terms of co-existence in a single world, sharing the ideas, problems andgeneral climate of the times; andin many ways both states were heirs to a common Hellenistic past in which classicaland eastern elements had already been blended. The similarity inresponse to identical stimuli need not imply an essential similarity. Under the superficial likeness lay fundamental differences which never altered and cannot be disregarded: irreconcilable religious antagonism in a profoundly religious world; the opposition between the Iranian traditional allegiance toaconcept ofhereditary legitimacy based on aclan structure of society and the continuing Byzantine adherence, dejure if not always defacto>, to theRoman constitutional principle that theimperial office was anelective magistracy as well asa divinely ordained function; the ultimate reliance ofthe Iranian state, despite the centralizing reforms of the Sasanians, on a hereditary aristocracy andpriesthood distributed among rigidly defined castes, asagainst the relative mobility of Byzantine society culminating throughout this period in an aristocracy of office rather than birth.

EQUAL BUT DIFFERENT
The acceptance byboth sides ofthe general premise that Byzantium and Iran were destined to share.the rule of the world made of them rivals as much as partners. Behind thebland courtesy of diplomatic cliches rana deep vein of enmity, and, what was perhaps still more damaging, mutual contempt. To the Zoroastrians Byzantium remained the heir ofAlexander the Great, "the emperor ofRum" ofthe Iranian tradition, thesacrilegious burner of the sacred text of the Avesta preserved at Stakhr. Perpetuating the Sasanian tradition, Tabari makesof
Ardashir I the avenger ofDarius III.1 For all of his fostering ofwestern ways, Shapur I gloatingly spread therecord of his humiliation of the Romans on every one ofhis monuments. Firdausi's version ofKhusrau IPs final victory over Bahram Chubin shows the king rejecting the aid of the boastful Romans torely exclusively onthe valour ofhis Iranian
nobles.2 No less on the Greek side, the comments of Procopius on Persian native arrogance, the belittling of Khusrau I's learning by Agathias, Theophylakt Simokattes' characterization of Khusrau II as a "barbarian" and his accusation ofperfidy against the Persian king at the siege ofMartyropolis, echoed by John ofNikiu's allegation that the King ofKings had treacherously plotted topoison his Roman allies, all
bode equally ill for thereaching of a common understanding.3 Both world cultures, proud of their great historical past, firmly wrapped in the assurance of their own superiority, could notwillingly acceptthe lessons of the enemy, nor would such lessons suit their characteristic societies. Persia evinced a certain interest in theancient learning of Greece, which she helped preserve and transmit to the Islamic world, but a contemptuous disregard for foreign achievements remained to the end the hall-mark and the Achilles' heel of Byzantium.
Chronologically, the parallel political courses ofthe two empires led to divergence rather than coalescence. For allofthe open belligerence of his policy, a taste forHellenic ideas and styles had still marked court circles inthe days ofShapur I, with his use ofthe Greek language inhis great inscription, hisincorporation of Greek learning into thescriptures, hispatronage of Manichaean syncretism, and hisuse of Greek artists forhis residence at Bishapur and elsewhere. But this taste fades rapidly into nothingness, despite a possible fleeting revival due to Khusrau I's interest in classical philosophy and Justinian's loan of

Particularly remarkable is the seeming absence of any such revival in the early days ofKhusrau II, inthe period ofclosest political co-operation between Iran andByzantium. Noputative rapprochement dueto a sharing of a feudal social pattern or to monotheistic tendencies inZoroastrianism can be demonstrated inthe late Sasanian period. If the suggested increase in toleration of the Iranian state toward Christianity after the 5 th century perhaps lessened the gap between the two religious antagonists, the growing religious orientation of the Byzantine court, which from the late 6th century turned political wars into crusades and retaliated forthe sack ofJerusalem by the destruction ofthe royal fire temple at Ganzak in Azarbaijan, served to push them once more
asunder.1 A useful index of the depth of irreconcilability between the two adjacent worlds may perhaps be provided by theincapacity of Armenia, torn between itsimperial religious and intellectual tradition and itsIranian social structure, to come to rest in either sphere or to achieve political stability between them. The Athenian philosophers fleeing the empire of Justinian received both asylum and welcome atthe court ofCtesiphon, but afew years later, unable toadapt themselvesor accept analien world, they were themselves tobeg the King of Kings
to allow them to return home.2

CHAPTER l6
IRAN AND THE ARABS
BEFORE ISLAM
The links of the Arabs with thePersians goback well into Achaemenian times. According to Herodotus, iii. 5, Cambyses marched on Egypt via northern Arabia andthe Hijaz after making a pact with andreceiving a safe conduct from the king of the Arabs, probably to be identified with the ruler of Lihyan, predecessor of the Nabataeans in the region; and according to vii. 86-7, theArabs furnished camel-mounted cavalrymen, who fought with bows, to Xerxes. TheArabs of north-western Arabia and the western fringes of the Syrian Desert passed under the suzerainty of Alexander theGreat, according to Polybius andPliny, andthen under that ofthe Seleucids; thus thetradition was established, to endure down to the Muslim conquest of Syria in the 7th century A.D., ofthe Arabs acting as frontier auxiliaries for the Romans and then the Byzantines.
On the eastern fringes of the Syrian Desert, Arabs from the interior of thepeninsula pressed into the fertile lands of Mesopotamia from an early date. TheAssyrians hadhada conscious policy of controlling the Arab tribes of northern Arabia, thereby curbing raids on caravan traffic across thepeninsula, and they had made their authority felt as far west as Taima', occupied by Nabuna'id from 552 to 545 B.C. After the Persian capture of Babylon in 5 39 B.C, Cyrus theGreat created a shortlived satrapy of 'Arabaya in northern Arabia, and Darius, seeking to encourage trade through thePersian Gulf, sent outtheGreek Scylax of Caryanda on a voyage of exploration right round the coasts of the Arabian peninsula. In the Seleucid period, Mesopotamia served as a base for the Seleucid kings' attempts to extend their political and commercial power into the Persian Gulf region and along the eastern coastlands ofArabia. From hisbase of Seleucia ontheTigris, Antiochus III the Great (223-187) in 205-204 B.C. sailed along the southern shore of the gulf as far as Chattenia and the district of the port of Gerrha, which was probably situated somewhere in the neighbourhood of

modern Dhahran and Qatlf, roughly opposite Bahrain Island, and which was anentrepot for the Indian trade and for the aromatics and spices ofSouth Arabia; a later king, Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-164) is said to have undertaken a similar expedition.1 Lower Iraq has throughout history been a point of entry for the Bedouins into the hadar or settled lands of Mesopotamia. As the Seleucid empire decayed, anArab principality was established there in the later 2nd century B.C. (after 129 B.C.), based ona settlement on the banks of the lower Tigris, Charax of Hyspaosines or simply Charax (< Aramaic karkhd "fortified settlement, town"). Its founder Hyspaosines son of Sagodonacus bears a wholly Iranian name (interpreted by Justi as "free of dust or stain", i.e. noble-minded, and by Bartholomae as "he who kicks upthe dust",2 yet more probably, as suggested by SirHarold Bailey, *hu-spas%ina- "keeping good watch", cf. Greek euskopos),buthe is described as king of the Arabs in that region, sc. of northeastern Arabia; the cultural language inCharax must, however, have been Aramaic, thelingua franca of the Fertile Crescent. Charax now became thefocal point of the Arab principality of Characene or Mesene (post-biblical Hebrew Meshan, Syriac Maishan, MPMeshun, passing into Arabic of the Islamic period as Maisan, occasionally Maishan), which embraced what was, inearly Islamic times, the region between Basra andWash. Mesene flourished from its position commanding the trade routes to the head of the Persian Gulf, and enjoyed independence for three centuries, until in c. 224 A.D. the Sasanian Ardashir I (c. 226-41) killed the last ruler of Charax. Ardashir then made Mesene into a dependent province ofhis empire, appointing over it a local ruler who bore the title of Meshun-Shah.3 In Sasanian times, there was a separate Nestorian Christian metropolitan district of Mesene, comprising four bishoprics.4
The Parthians and then the Sasanians made Ctesiphon, on the eastern bank of the Tigris in central Mesopotamia, their capital and the centre from which Iranian power radiated over Aramaic, and then increasingly Arab, Iraq. Arab infiltration into this part of Iraq centred on Hatra,

Arabic al-Hadr, a settlement founded in northern Iraq, to the southwest of Mosul, by themiddle of the ist century B.C. ; Arabic names in the Aramaic inscriptions from this region show clearly the ethnic origins of most of the early rulers. Hatra appears as only one of a ring of Arab principalities founded around this time along the desert fringes of the Fertile Crescent, stretching through northern Mesopotamiaand Commagene to Edessa (where reigned the house ofAbgar from the ist century B.C. onwards), Hamat, Emesa and Palmyra. The more westerly

ones endured until the extension ofdirect Roman rule into these parts; the more easterly ones came within the Parthian cultural and political sphere of influence; certain of the early rulers even of Edessa bore Iranian names.1 Hatra's first rulers were simply called "lords" (mdryd), but in the ist century A.D. one lord with a Parthian name, v/g'I (Vologases), styled himself Malkd dhi 'Arabh "king ofthe Arabs".At least three other rulers bore thetypical Arsacid name Sanatruk,and Sanatruk II,apparently after successfully warding offa Roman attack led by Trajan in 117 A.D., added tohis titles the epithet oi^akkayd "the conquering".2
As the ally of the Arsacids, Hatra fought offRoman attacks ledby Septimius Severus, even after Trajan and he had captured the Parthian capital of Ctesiphon. It flourished both as a caravan city and as the possessor of a religious shrine dedicated to the cult of the Sun God. Hatra's fortunes declined with those of its patrons the Arsacids; after the defeat ofArtabanus V in 224 A.D. byArdashir I, Hatra was garrisoned fora while against the Sasanians bythe Romans, until Shapur I (241-72, the Sabur al-Junud of the Arabic sources) succeeded in occupying the city and plundering it,ensuring that it never rose again to any position of significance. The Arabic historians weave aromantic legend around these events, that thecity was finally betrayed to Shapur by al-Nadira, daughter of its king al-Daizan b. Mu'awiya (who borethe title al-Satirun < Sanatruk ?), who had fallen inlove with the Sasanian besieger.3
In place ofHatra - which became famous inArabic lore as an objectlesson in thetransience of earthly prosperity - there arose in central Iraq the city of Hira, apparently a creation of the Tanukh tribe of Arabs, who formed an important population element there. Very soon it became the capital ofthe Arab Lakhmid dynasty, allies ofthe Sasanians and guardians ofthe desert fringes against nomadic pressure from the interior of Arabia and against the Byzantines and their Ghassanid allies of Syria. The fortunes of the Lakhmids and Sasanians were so intertwined that within just over thirty years ofthe ending of Lakhmid independence in 602, Sasanian dominion over Iraq crumbled totally under Arabs from Najd, impelled by the new faith of Islam.

HIRA
II
Hira (Syriac bertha "fortified encampment", cf. Arabic hair "enclosure", found as a component in the names of two celebrated Umayyad palace complexes in Syria, Qasr al-Hair al-Sharql and alGharbl) lay near the edge of the desert and the sown, afarsakb from the later Islamic armed camp of Kufa and to the south-east of Karbala'. As well as lying in a fertile agricultural area, it was famed for the salubriousness of its climate; an Arabic proverb stated that "A day and night at Hira are better than a whole year's medicine." According to the antiquarian Hisham b. Muhammad, called Ibn al-Kalbi (d. 819 or 821), to whom we owe important information on the chronology of the Lakhmid kings,1 Hira was founded during the reign of Ardashir I after that monarch's conquest of Iraq from the Parthians. This is, however, improbable, and it was under Arab dominance, above all under the Lakhmid chiefs, that Hira rose to fame, benefiting by its position as a commercial centre on the east-west caravan route between Syria in the west and Iraq and Persia in the east, and achieving a lasting cultural significance in Near Eastern history as the meeting-place of three cultures, those of Sasanian Iran, of Byzantine and Nestorian Christianity, and of indigenous Arabian paganism. The Lakhmids are usually known in the Arabic sources as the Manddhira and Na'dmina, al-Mundhir and al-Nu'man being the two most characteristic titles borne by the dynasty's members; they are one of the three lines of pre-Islamic Arab rulers (together with the Ghassanids and the chiefs of Kinda) who are dignified by the title of muluk "kings".2
The first known ruler of Hira in its pre-Lakhmid phase was Jadhlma al-Abrash ("the Leper"), the subject of many anecdotes in Arabic literature.3 He is described in a Nabataean inscription from the Hauran in Syria as "king of the Tanukh", a tribe who, as we have noted, lived in central Iraq but who had also, according to certain Arabic sources, in part migrated westwards to Syria away from the authority of Ardashir; Jadhlma's power clearly stretched over the bedouins of the whole Syrian Desert. Among the first of the Lakhmids proper was

unfortunately, much remains still obscure here. A useful table of the Lakhmid rulers and their regnal dates, with the reigns of the Sasanians given for comparison, is given in S. Smith, "Events in Arabia", p. 430.

Mar' al-Qais or Imru' al-Qais al-Bad', who enjoyed a long reign in the last quarter of the 3rd century andthe first oneof the 4th century, dying in 328 according tothe proto-Arabic al-Namara inscription from southern Syria, which gives him the extravagant title of"king ofall the Arabs". He was thecontemporary of several of the Sasanians, from Bahram I to Shapur II, and acted asgovernor forthem over the north Arab tribes ofRabi'a and Mudar, with authority extending asfaras the Hijaz; in his later years, however, he seems to have transferred his allegiance to the east Romans. The dynasty reached especial heights of splendour under al-Nu'man I al-A'war ("the One-eyed") (405-33), the contemporary of the emperor Bahram Gor (420-38); it was he who reputedly built for his Sasanian suzerain the palace of Khawarnaq (MP "affording good protection, having a fine roof"?)1 near Hira, and the palace of Sadir, both of them accounted by the pre-Islamic Arabs asamongst the wonders of the world.2 Bahram Gor had grown up at the court ofal-Mundhir I inthe healthy atmosphere ofHira, and he gained his throne in Ctesiphon with the help of the Lakhmid ruler against the Persian nobles who had killed his brother Shapur.3
The population of Hira comprised its townspeople, the *Ibdd "devotees", who were Nestorian Christians using Syriac as their liturgical and cultural language, though Arabic was probably thelanguage of daily intercourse. These 'Ibad were famed for their literacy, and the traditions which speak of Meccan traders visiting Hira and taking back with them the newly evolved Arabic alphabet are probably correct, in that a knowledge of writing amongst thenorthern Arabs does seem to have spread from the north-east ofthe peninsula. One of the fewArabic poets of the pre-Islamic era who seem to have been unambiguously Christian, asopposed to several poets who knew about and mentioned the external manifestations of Christianity, was 'Adi b. Zaid al-'Ibadi, who, as his name implies, stemmed from the 'Ibad.4 The Lakhmid kings themselves remained strongly pagan till a very late

date - it was the last ruler, al-Nu'man III b. al-Mundhir IV (580-602) who became the first and last Christian Lakhmid ruler-and their position as rulers over the Arabs depended not only on their links with Persia as Sasanian vassals, but also on those with the bedouins of the Iraq fringes, and especially with the Taniikh, who were originally nomads but who gradually became partly sedentarized and must have
permeated the 'Ibad as an element of the town population.1 Beyond this middle Euphrates-Tigris region, the coercive authority of the Lakhmids rested to a considerable extent on the amount of political and military support which they derived from the Sasanians in nearby Ctesiphon. The emperors granted to the Lakhmids estates as fiefsin the Sawad of Iraq, with the right to collect taxation and use it to defray their expenses as frontier wardens; however, the Arabic author Abu'1-Baqa' points out that these fiefs were not extensive and that those granted to al-Nu'man I amounted in value to a hundred thousand
dirhams only, a comparatively modest sum for such a fertile region.2 Since the Lakhmids of Hlra were a family, and not a tribal group (the tribe of Lakhm, which the genealogists usually attributed to Yemen or the south Arabs, had dispersed itself across the Syrian Desert, much of it establishing itself in Syria, and after the coming of Islam, it virtually
disappeared as an independent group),3 they had to rely on foreign troops or mercenaries for their striking force. Various groups among the fighting men at the Lakhmids' disposal are mentioned in the Arabic sources, and their origins and nature have been discussed at length, firstly by Rothstein and more recently by Kister. These groups included the Rahd'in or "hostages", drawn from other Arab tribes, and the Sana*? "creatures" or "troops taken into personal service", made up of outlaws and outcasts of various tribes; but of particular interest in considering the Lakhmids' position vis-a-vis the Sasanians are the Wad&*¥ "troops left behind as a garrison, etc". Abu'1-Baqa' again says that these were a Persian unit sent by the emperors to the Lakhmids as reinforcements; they numbered one thousand cavalrymen and had a year's tour of duty in Hlra before returning to Persia and being replaced by a fresh contingent. These soldiers - who must have been professionals, of the familiar mailed and heavily armed cavalryman type

- were, so the Arabic author says, the real mainstay ofLakhmid power, both against theHira townspeople andagainst thebedouins of the hinterland. Other Arabic sources, such as Tabari, mention two other groups, forming an elite force called theDausar and theShahba', as
being Persian troops sent to Hira inthe time ofal-Nu'man I.1 Through the agency ofthe Lakhmids, the Sasanians not only aimed at protecting the desert fringes and thereby ensuring the safe passage of caravans through eastern Arabia to the Hijaz and Yemen, but also at extending their political influence westwards across the peninsula. Thus Tabari mentions that Khusrau I Anushirvan appointed al-Mundhir III b. Ma' al-Sama' (b.al-Nu'man III?) (c. 505-54) over theregions of Bahrain, 'Uman and Yamama asfarwest as Ta'if, and over the restof
the Hijaz, inorshortly after 531.2 It seems, indeed, that aspart of the struggle with Byzantium, Persia had well before the 6th century attempted toexert some influence even inMecca and Yathrib (the later Medina) via the recognized Hlra-Mecca commercial and cultural highway, thereby countering the influence of the Ghassanids in the Hijaz. The Arabic sources here areonly fragmentary and allusive, butmay well contain a kernel of truth. Certain of them state that when the Sasanian emperor Kavad (488-531) adopted the doctrines of Mazdak, he commanded his vassal al-Mundhir III to do likewise. When the latter refused, the emperor approached al-Harith b. 'Amr, chief of the tribe of Kinda, who agreed to impose the new faith onthe Arabs of Najd and the Hijaz. Hence some Arabs inMecca, says the 13th century author Ibn Sa'id, followed the tenets ofMazdak {fat(andaqa)y and at the time ofMuhammad's rise two generations or so later, there was still a group in Mecca recognized aserstwhile Mazdakites(xanddiqa)*
There is rather more information concerning Persian influence in Yathrib. Many traditions onpre-Islamic Medina lead us to conclude that the Jewish tribes settled there, still a significant element atthe time of the hijra> formerly exercised dominion in theoasis over theArab groups ofthe Banu Qaila, sc. the Aus and Khazraj, who had migrated thither from South Arabia. Now the 9th-century Muslim geographer Ibn Khurdadhbih records a tradition that the warden ofthe desert borders (mar^ubdn al-bddiya) had an official inMedina who collected taxes there.

HIRA
Whether this marvytban was the Persian warden in eastern Arabia, sc. in Bahrain or Hajar, or the official of the Persians' vassals, the Lakhmids,
is unspecified;1 but in any event, it looks as if a certain degree of Persian control was exercised over Medina through the agency of the Jewish tribes of al-Nadir and Quraiza. When after the middle of the 6th century the Arab tribes in Medina gained the upper hand over the Jews there, control and the collection of taxes there were apparently exercised by the Lakhmid al-Nu'man III b. al-Mundhir III, who
appointed cAmr b. Itnaba al-Khazraji as his representative in the oasis
("king of al-Madina", in Ibn Sa'id's words).2
This link between Hlra and Medina was one aspect of Lakhmid policy in regard to the Arabian tribes; agreements were made with powerful bedouin and other chiefs to supply troops for the Lakhmid army and to keep the caravan routes from Iraq across Arabia policed. The Lakhmids also derived part of their revenues from taxes{itdwd) levied on these friendly tribes, and the Arabic sources note a punitive raid undertaken by al-Nu'man III against the Banu Tamim, who had refused to pay taxes. Tamim, of the north-Arab group of Mudar, were indeed strenuous opponents of the Lakhmid attempts to impose their control on Najd; it was perhaps not entirely coincidental that at the time of the Muslim conquest of Iraq, Tamim were in the van of the attacks on the Persians. On the other hand, cooperative chiefs were granted lands in Iraq by the Lakhmids or the Sasanians. Thus the chief of the Banu Shaiban, Qais b. Mas'ud, was granted the district of Ubulla in Lower Iraq by Khusrau II Parvlz in return for a guarantee that the tribesmen of Bakr b. Wa'il (of which Shaiban was an important con
stituent) would not raid Persian territory in the Sawad of Iraq.3 The Lakhmids were further adept at taking advantage of tribal feuds and vendettas within Arabia, playing off one group against its rivals.
Lakhmid designs in the peninsula were, however, frustrated in the early decades of the 6th century by the rise of the powerful central and northern Arabian confederation of tribes led by Kinda, whose chiefs, through their brief period of dominance, attained the epithet "kings" in Arabian history, leaving no lasting political memorial, but bequeathing to their descendants a pride in aristocratic Kindl lineage which endured all through the early Islamic period. Al-Harith b. 'Amr

al-Kindi, the Arethas of the Byzantine historians, succeeded in uniting the tribes of Najd, and c. 500 allied with the Byzantines against the Lakhmids and their Persian suzerains. In 503 al-Harith attacked Hira for the first time, doubtless encouraged by the Greeks and taking advantageof Sasanian internal weakness after thedefeat by theHephthalites in 489 and the succession to the throne of Kavad only with Hephthalite assistance. In ensuing years, al-Harith extended hisauthority over the Arabs of the Iraq borders. Kavad was unable adequately to support al-Mundhir III; in 525 the Kinda chief captured Hira itself, temporarily driving outtheLakhmid. According to thesouth Arabian tradition, al-Harith then came toan agreement with Kavad by which the Euphrates or the canal of al-Sara near the Tigris, not farfrom Ctesiphon, was fixed as the northern boundary of the Kinda confederacy; at this time, too, it ispossible that al-Harith may have exercised suzerainty along the Gulf coast asfar as 'Uman, possibly as a vassal of Kavad.
The Kindi interregnum in Hira lasted three years only. Its termination was linked with the end of Kavad's reign and the anti-Mazdakite reaction in the Sasanian empire under the newemperor Khusrau I Anushirvan (end of 528 or beginning of 529). Anushirvan restored alMundhir to Hira c. 527 or 528, and weinfer from Greek sources that al-Harith hadto flee across the Syrian Desert to Byzantine territory, where he was appointed phylarch but soon afterwards died; al-Mundhir celebrated the regaining ofhis throne bya massacre ofleading Kindls. Al-Harith's son Hujr was subsequently killed in a rising of the subject tribe of Asad against Kindi domination, andal-Mundhir encouraged dissension within the ruling family of Kinda. Thus thegreat rivals of the Lakhmids forcontrol ofnorthern and central Arabia were virtually wiped out; only towards the time of al-Mundhir's death (554) did a member of the oldruling family, Qais b. Salama, chief of Kindaand Ma'add and governor for theByzantines on thePalestine and Jordan fringes, manage to inflict a defeat on the Lakhmids.1
These events in north-eastern Arabia had their effect onpolitical and religious happenings insouth-eastern Arabia and South Arabia, spheres where theSasanians were also in the6thcentury endeavouring to extend their influence.

Shammar Yuhar'ish was one of the most powerful of the kings of Saba'-Himyar, and flourished toward theendof the 3rdcentury; this information must relate to diplomatic exchanges, andperhaps military clashes, with the Sasanians in Iraq or their allies.1 Atthis early date also, the emperors had been concerned about thesouthern shores of the Persian Gulf, the furthering of Persian commerce there andthepreventing of traders from the Indian Ocean landing goods oncoasts not controlled bythe Persians and thus evading thepayment of customs dues. Shapur II (309 or 310-79) carried on a vigorous policy against both theArabs of the Syrian Desert, whom the Romans hadincited against him, and against those ofBahrain and eastern Arabia. Arabs from Bahrain had crossed the Gulf and raided into the Persian heartland ofFars. Shapur in turn led troops across the Gulf and advanced from Bahrain into Yamama. He defeated theArabs there; he established frontier defences in Lower Iraq against the nomads, including a trench and rampart (the khandaq Sdbur ofthe Arabic sources); and headopted the classic Persian tactic of carrying off tribesmen from Taghlib, Bakr b. Wa'il and Hanzala for resettlement in Kirman and Ahvaz. A recently described Sasanian settlement onanisland off the tip ofthe Musandam peninsula in northern 'Uman, commanding thesealane through the Straits ofHurmuz, may date from Shapur's time. Thus an important degree of direct Persian control was established ineastern Arabia, andwith the stationing of Persian soldiers and officials there, Zoroastrianism came to be implanted. The pre-Islamic Arabian poets occasionally refer to Zoroastrian practices, andit must have been either in central Iraq orherein eastern Arabia where they came into contact with thefaith (see below, p. 609). Shapur's draconian measures against theArabs earned him the sobriquet in Arabic lore of Dhu'l-aktaf ("he who pierces, dislocates shoulders"), from his maltreatment ofcaptives.2
'Uman belongs geographically to the Zagros mountain chains of southern Iran rather than totheplains ofeastern Arabia, andfor much of its history it has been linked politically and culturally with Iran. In

Sasanian times it was a Persian outpost, a link in the chain of positions from which the emperors were trying tocontrol the Indian Ocean trade and tosecure a foothold inthe agriculturally rich regions of Hadramaut and Yemen, the famed Arabia Felix or Arabia Odorifera. The Persians knew 'Uman as Mazun, and under this latter name it seems already to have been regarded as part of Shapur Fs empire, on the evidence ofthe Naqsh-i Rustam inscription.1 There were Persian garrisons in places like Suhar and Rustaq, Suhar being the great commercial entrepot for the Persians in 'Uman and Rustaq their administrative centre. Aswell as trade, thePersians developed agriculture andirrigation in 'Uman, and both the construction of cemented water channels from the inland mountains to the coastal settlements and the extensive digging of qandts conveying water from the mountain slopes date from the Sasanian period. Actual ethnic Persian settlement was considerable, and this not only on the coastal plain but also inthe agricultural lands ofthe Jabal Akhdar. Relations between these Persians and the Azdi Arabs of the interior were regulated in Khusrau Aniishirvan's time bya treaty, recognizing the rule over the Arabs of the tributary Al Julanda; eventually, these Arab groups acquired a status as frontier auxiliaries somewhat akin to that of the Persians' other tributaries in Iraq and Bahrain.2

The 6th century was a propitious time for Persian intervention in South Arabia. Political fragmentation, always a feature of the Yemen, with its petty princes, the aqydl and adhwd\ increased with thedecline of the old kingdom of Himyar, and possibly with economic decay affecting South Arabian agriculture, a process symbolized in Arabian lore bythe story of the breaking of the dam of Ma'rib and the alleged migration to northern Arabia of Arabs from thesouth. Confessional discords appeared asthe old South Arabian polytheism fell into decay. Monophysite Christianity was implanted at Najran in the interior of Yemen, where there was a flourishing community with a fine cathedral and its own bishop, and there were possibly older Christian elements in the coastlands, traditionally explained as having been evangelized by missionaries en route for India.

munities was Ethiopia, also Monophysite, and the rulers of Axum had ancient links with South Arabia and claimed in their titulature control over Himyar, Dhu Raidan, Saba', etc. Judaism also had a following in the Yemen, and sectarian strife now broke out between the two monotheistic faiths. The Jewish communities acquired a leader inone Yusuf, called in the Arabic sources Dhu Nuwas "the man with the forelock", who became a convert to the faith, perhaps with the main aim of counteracting the growing Christian and Ethiopian influence in his homeland. He had overcome rivals and secured the throne of Himyar, apparently before 518, and towards 523 heunleashed a persecution of Christians insuch places asMokha, Zofar and Najran; the sufferings of the Christian community in Najran were later held upby Muhammad in the Qur'an as an example of steadfastness, the fortitude of the Ashdb al-ukhdud "martyrs of the trench".1
News of these persecutions reached as far as Byzantium; atthe request of Justinian, theNegus of Ethiopia landed in Yemen with a mighty army andoccupied it in 525. It seems that Dhu Nuwaswas encouraged in his anti-Christian policy byal-Mundhir IIIin Hira, who was himself a pagan, but whose Christian subjects, the 'Ibad, were Nestorians and therefore hostile toMonophysitism anyway. When Dhu Nuwas hadsecured hisbloody victories over thelocal Christians, he had written to al-Mundhir urging him to deal likewise with the Christians in his own kingdom. In the event, al-Mundhir was unable toprovide Dhu Nuwas with any material help against the Ethiopians, for it was at this point that he was expelled from his capital byal-Harith b. ' Amr of Kinda (see above); DhuNuwas waskilled in battle, and a retaliatory persecution of the Jews begun.2
South Arabia now became anEthiopian protectorate fornearly fifty years under oneAbraha andhis sonMasruq. Abraha wasa former slave, who achieved virtually independent political authority; hislong inscription, commemorating his restoration of the dam of Ma'rib records thereception of envoys (? before 539) from, inter a/ios, "the king of Fars" and the Lakhmid al-Mundhir.3 According to Procopius, Justinian tried to incite Abraha to march northwards andattack the Lakhmids and Persians in Iraq, but Abraha wasreluctant to move.

Eventually, he did lead a punitive expedition in 547 (year 662 of the Sabaean era) against the Arabs of Ma'add and 'Amir b. Sa'sa'a in central Arabia, defeating the Ma'add at Haliban, onthe caravan route from Najran toNajd, whilst another section ofthe South Arabian army defeated the 'Amir at Turaba in the Hijaz; the raid towards South Arabia which had provoked Abraha's counter-attack was probably incited by the Lakhmids, who after the overthrow ofKinda had regained control of Ma'add and other tribes of Najd. The Muraighan inscription, which records these events, states that 'Amr b. al-Mundhir III (or perhaps 'Amr b.cAmr b. al-Mundhir III), governor over Ma'add on al-Mundhir's behalf, hadto pledge his own life as guarantee of his tribesmen's peaceable conduct.1
The event bywhich Abraha is best known in later Islamic lore, the attack onthe Ka'ba at Mecca, may well beidentical, it has been suggested by J. Ryckmans and A. F.L.Beeston, with Abraha's move northwards to meet the Lakhmids' allies at Haliban and the operations in the Hijaz at Turaba. The Arabic sources traditionally date the 'Amat al-Fil "the Year of the Elephant" (sc. the year when the elephants of the South Arabian forces appeared before a surprised Meccan populace, but were providentially destroyed by divine intervention; cf. Qur'an cv) as coinciding with Muhammad's birth in Mecca, again traditionally fixed (though probably too early) in 570. The "Year ofthe Elephant" must incontrovertibly have fallen much earlier than 570, by which date the Persians were establishing themselves inYemen, and it may well relate to the events of 547, when the Lakhmids, faced at this same time with an attack from the Ghassanids under al-Harith b. Jabala - al-Mundhir III was tofall inbattle in 5 54 fighting against the Ghassanids - found it advisable to come to terms.2
The unpopularity of Ethiopian troops garrisoned in South Arabia eventually provoked towards c. 5 70 aYemeni nationalist reaction against Masruq b. Abraha. The leader of this movement was Saif b. Dhi Yazan, whose father Abu Murra hadlost his wife to Abraha; in medieval Islamic times there grew up a popular epic romance based onhis exploits, transposed into the Islamic period but with the Ethiopian occupiers ofSouth Arabia and the pagan Zanj orblacks asthe villains.

The latter was at first reluctant to intervene ina comparatively distant region, but in the end agreedto dispatch bysea a force of eight hundred cavalrymen, men originally destined for execution but now given achance to redeem themselvesin battle. Under their leader Vahriz, this Persian force killed Masruq and fought its way to San'a', where Saif b. Dhl Yazan, who had accompanied the invaders, was installed asking of Himyar and tributaryof the Sasanians. When the protecting Persian garrison was withdrawn, a rising took place, Saif b. Dhl Yazan was killed and the Ethiopians reappeared. Hence Vahriz returned, finally banishing Ethiopian influence decisively from Yemen and setting up Ma'di Karib b. Saif b. Dhl Yazan asvassal ruler in San'a\ A Persian occupation force remained in the Yemen till after the hijra, when Muhammad came to an agreement with Badham, the Persian governor ofthat time, and then after Badham's death, with his son. Cut off from all hope ofaid from Persia after the cataclysm of Heraclius' victories in Iraq, the colony of Persian officials and soldiers inthe Yemen seems tohave gone over to the new faith of Islam and to have helped the Muslim commanders suppress the revolt of the local prophet al-Aswad; these Persians hadprobably already been partially assimilated totheir Arab environment, but their descendants, the so-called Abna* or"Sons", remained a distinct group
for some time inearly Islam.1
Meanwhile, the Lakhmids, and consequently the Sasanians, had lost much oftheir influence innorthern Arabia after the Lakhmid defeat in 554 at Qinnasrin near Aleppo atthe hands ofal-Harith b. Jabala ("the Day of Hallma"). Within Medina, theJews were losing their dominance, and thus Lakhmid influence in theHijaz declined. Ghassanid pressure continued inthe latter half ofthe century; in 570 al-Mundhir b. al-Harith defeated a Lakhmid force under 'Amr b. al-Mundhir Ill's brother Qabus (the degree of Persian cultural influence among the Lakhmids being shown by the appearance ofthis typically Persian epic name, arabized from Kavus), and in 5 80 the Ghassanid ruler surprised and sacked Hlra itself. Al-Nu'man IIIb. al-Mundhir IV(c. 580-602) came to the throne shortly afterwards, and was the first Lakhmid to adopt Christianity. He was deposed by Khusrau Parviz in 602. Arabic tradition connects this event with a specific cause, stemming from

al-Nucman's execution c. 600 of 'Adi b. Zaid, who had been educated at Ctesiphon and had acted atKhusrau's court as a secretary translating documents received from Hlra inArabic. More probably, the emperor had come to resent Lakhmid independence and hadnow decided to take the defence ofthe desert borders into his own hands. The Persians placed in Hlra as al-Nu'man's successor Iyas b. Qabisa al-Taghlibi (602-11), who came from a local Christian family, but by his side there
reigned the Persian marzban Nakhvirgan.1 The Persians were notdestined to exercise for long this degree of closer control over the former Lakhmid territories. Arab lore and legend make much of"The Day of Dhu Qar", which fell atsome point between 604 and611, andwhich was provoked either by Arab discontent at al-Nu'man's deposition or, more probably, by a feeling among thebedouins of north-eastern Arabia that the frontier of the sown lands was now more open and vulnerable. Whether Dhu Qar - a watering-place near thelater settlement of Kufa - was merely a skirmish ora full-scale battle isunclear, but bedouins ofBakr b. Wa'il and Shaiban, using coats of mail and weapons brought outfrom Hlraby al-Nu'man, defeated a combined force of other Arabs from Taghlib, Iyad, etc. and regular Persian cavalry under their commander Hamarz, pursuing the latter back into the Sawad. The importance of the clash was as much symbolic and psychological as anything else; Arab lore vaunts it as showing tothe Arabs that the Persians were not invincible: in the words ofa tradition attributed tothe Prophet, "It is the first time that the Arabs have got the upper hand of the Persians, andit is
through me that God has helped them."2
A probable legacy of Dhu Qar was the fact that it was the Bakr b. Wa'il under al-Muthanna b. Haritha al-Shaibani who, aware ofPersian weakness, in633 invited the Muslim leader Khalid b. al-Walid toattack Iraq and Hlra, a campaign which led to the surrender of Hlra andits rapid decline in theearly Islamic period under competition from the newly founded misr orarmed camp ofKufa and later from the cityof
Baghdad.3 The Persian position ineastern Arabia along the Gulf shore also became untenable at this time. In 629-30 al-'Ala' b. 'Abd-Allah al-Hadraml appeared in Bahrain, and thePersian marzuban of Hajar,

Sebukht, andsome of his retinue, came over to Islam. Others, however, remained faithful to Zoroastrianism, as did some of the Persians in 'Uman; these Majus became liable to thejkga or poll-tax like the Jews and Christians, the concept of who constituted "the People of the Book" being thereby de facto extended.1

The cultural and intellectual influence exercised by Sasanian Persia over Arabia is not easy to quantify, but was clearly of significance, especially upon those Arabs of the north-eastern andnorthern parts of the peninsula in contact with Persian Iraq or with Persian colonies in eastern Arabia. Some of the Bakrl tribe of 'Ijl settled in Bahrain among Persian agriculturist immigrants from Istakhr in Fars and became assimilated to them; later, christianized 'Ijlis fought on the Persian side at the battle of Ullais in 634.2 This is not the place to discuss the religious heritage ofIran asit affected the birth and subsequent development of the Arabian faith of Islam, although thequestion, has attracted the attention of several scholars.3 It has, however, been noted that the frequently found concept of fatalism in pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, the ideas of thevicissitudes of fate, suruf al-%amdn, andthe ravages of time or dahr, correspond to Iranian Zurvanite ideas of time anddestiny; but these mayall stem from a fatalistic strain in Near Eastern religion in general.4
We are on firmer ground in discussing Persian influences on Arabic culture andliterature, mediated, in particular, viatheLakhmids. Many of the greatest poets of the Jahiliyya came to Hlra seeking thehelpand patronage of the rulers there, such as 'Abid b.al-Abras, al-Mutalammis, Tarafa, 'Amr b. Kulthum, al-Nabigha al-Dhubyani, Maimun b. QaisalA'sha, Labid andHassan b. Thabit; andit was in turn al-Mundhir IIPs intervention which brought to an endtheprotracted and demoralizing War of Basus between Bakr andTaghlib c. 525^ A c)th-century Arabic

IRAN AND THE ARABS
literary critic adverts to al-A'sha's fondness for using Persian words, saying "al-A'sha used to visit the court of the kings of Persia, and because ofthat, Persian words abound inhis poetry"; verses which this same critic quotes here illustrate the poet's use of Persian words to designate musical instruments, including the sanj(NP chang) "lute",the nay "flute" andthebarbat "harp".1
This particular poet's adoption of Persian terms for musical instruments illustrates an obvious point: Persian words tended to be borrowed by the Arabs for objects andconcepts which their owndesert 'arabiyya, despite its famed richness, lacked, viz. for cultural and, toa lesser extent, religious andethical terms. Many pre-Islamic poets refer to the external features of Persian life and manners with which they obviously had direct contact, such as the insignia and practices of monarchical power; theweapons andmailed coats of Persian soldiers; the distinctive clothing and headgear of the Persians; and the sacred fires, the priests' chanting and other ceremonies connected with Zoroastrianism.2
Hence it is not surprising that it was from the Persians that the Arabs obtained words like tdj "crown" (MPfag), already in the alNamara inscription of Mar' al-Qais and in several pre-Islamic and mukhadram poets,3 and dir* "chain mail" ( < *dirih < OP drdda-;cf. also Avestan %ra~8a-, MP%reh, NP %}rift). In the Qur'an we find some Persian words denoting theological or moral figures and concepts, such as 'ifrit "demon" (early MP afritan, later MP afridan " t ocreate", hence "creature"), and jundh "crime" ( < late MP and NPgundh < earlier MP ivindh"crime, sin"). Butespecially noteworthy areterms relating to Paradise and the delights there for the elect: firdaus "Paradise" itself ( < Avestan pairidae^a, passing into Greek and most Middle Eastern languages, and probably via the Christians ofIraq into Arabic); istabraq "silk brocade" (MP stabrag < stabr "thick, strong"), worn by the dwellers in Paradise; namdriq "cushions" (Parthian namr, MP and NP narm "soft"), onwhich the saved will loll; and rauda "well-watered meadow or garden", as in Paradise (perhaps < MProd "river", and hence from theIraqi milieu). Clearly, when Muhammad wished to impress his followers by describing the joys in store for the righteous and perhaps to counter theinfluence of his rival in Mecca, al-Nadr b.

al-Harith, who told stories ofthe Persian heroes Rustam and Isfandiyar and distracted the Prophet's audience - he not infrequently had recourse to Persian terms, for thesplendours andluxury of Persian court life were proverbial in early Arabia.1
It is,of course, the task of the philologist to endeavour to discover whether these andother Persian loan-words came into early Arabic directly from Middle Persian via the courts of Iraq or the Persian colonies ineastern Arabia, orthrough the intermediacy ofother Semitic languages which hadborrowed Iranian words, such as Aramaicand later, Syriac. Some forms clearly came into Arabic via Syriac. A parallel form to dir( "chain mail" is %ard (in theQur'an XXXIV.IO-II as sard), describing the mailed coats which David is commanded tomake, which must have come via Syriac %ardd; sirbdl, in the Qur'an in two places meaning "garment", but inpre-Islamic poetry more specifically "shirt, coat of mail", later Arabic plural form sardwll "breeches, trousers", is from MP (and NP)shalvdr via Syriac sharbdld\ and al-Majus"the Magians, Zoroastrians" is from OPmagusvia Syriac magoshd (theMP form is unattested, but was presumably *moy). Occasionally, the absence ofa Persian loan-word from other Semitic languages points to direct borrowing, as with,jundh, which is notfound in Syriac and was probably borrowed from spoken Persian; and some Arabic forms preserve theMiddle Persian ending -ag > NP-a, such as istabraq and khandaq "trench" (used to designate the defensive ditch dug by Muhammad to protect Medina against the Meccan besiegers, allegedly on theadvice of a Persian convert, Salman al-Farisi), < MP *kandagy
NP kanda "dug, excavated".2 Borrowings from Persian inevitably increased in the post-Islamic period, when Persians became integrated into the political and social fabric ofIslam. Inparticular, the conceptof adab, polite education and culture, owed much to Persian cultural and erhical models; butall these linguistic and cultural trends were really the continuation andacceleration of processes whose beginnings can be discerned in the pre-Islamic period.
Outside thelinguistic and literary field, it is more difficult to assess Persian cultural influence on the early Arabs, owing to the paucity of surviving buildings and artifacts in theArab lands and the problems

of accurately dating theobjects which have survived. Inthe sphere of architecture, Persian influence onthe buildings of the Lakhmids, such as the palace of Khawarnaq, must have been decisive, and Persian models must have dominated the architecture of early Islamic Iraq. There would have been several splendid Persian buildings still standing in Iraq after the Islamic conquest forthe Arabs toadmire - the ruinsof Parthian Hatra, theTaq-Iwan of Shapiir II at Karkh, theTaq-i Kisra at Ctesiphon, etc. - and Persian architects and craftsmen were doubtless utilized. Astructure like Ukhaidir, now inthe desert thirty miles southwest of Karbala', cannot have been architecturally and stylistically a creation de novo; Creswell was probably right in dating it to theearly 'Abbasid period, after 775, though Dieulafoy had suggested that it was built fora Persian governor inHira in the opening decades ofthe 7th
century.1 Persian artistic influences also penetrated across the Syrian desert to the structures of the Umayyad caliphs onthe fringes of modern Syria and Jordan, where there wasa symbiosis with the local hellenistic and Byzantine artistic and architectural traditions. Thus at Mshatta (probably dating from 743-4), the mythical animals in the vine tendrils of the stucco decoration, and the tulip motif there, seem tobe Sasanianin inspiration, whilst the celebrated mural of the "Enemies of Islam" at the bath ofQusair 'Arnra (probably dating from c. 712-15) was viewed by Herzfeld ascharacteristically Persian inits arrangement ofthe kings
of the world doing homage tothe caliph-emperor.2 Above all, Richard Ettinghausen has recently shown that the Throne Hall inthe palaceof Khirbat al-Mafjar (dating from the caliph Hisham's reign, 724-43) was created with many of the trappings and decorative motifs of such Sasanian palaces asthat of Ctesiphon, even though the basic structure
was of local, Byzantine inspiration.3

CHAPTER 17
IRANO-TURKISH RELATIONS IN THE
LATE SASANIAN PERIOD
Firdausi's Shah-nama, completed at the beginning of the n t h century A.D. and incorporating epic material from earlier times, describes the battles between two equally courageous peoples, the Iranians and the Turanians. Theword Turan is unrelated to the word Turk but since, from the 6th century on, the Turks, whohad migrated from Central Asia, came to play a decisive role in thehistory of the Iranian peoples, by association it came to be applied - mistakenly - to these new arrivals.
At Panjikant in Sogdiana (in present-day Tajikistan, 60km east of Samarkand), there is a wall painting dating probably from the8th century A.D.,1 which depicts ascene ofmourning forsome young prince; near thecatafalque aremale mourners with brown hair andlight skins, while a little further off, in the foreground, are others of a different ethnic type, having black hair, a darker skin and prominent hooked noses. The twogroups possibly represent Sogdians andTurks, but we cannot sayfor sure which is which (fig. 3, p.1146).
Another wall painting of the same period,2 from Afrasiyab (thenorthern part of the town of Samarkand) in Sogdiana, shows the dignified figure of an envoy mounted on a camel; the envoy's features - large, round eyes and a prominent nose - are those usually attributed to foreigners3 andin particular to the Sogdians by theUigurs from Qo£o (Turfan in the Tarim basin) (pis 142-3).
These examples may serve to illustrate theinter-relation of the older Iranian peoples with thenewly-arrived Turks in Central Asia and Iran in the early Middle Ages. It may here be relevant to mention some of those peoples who, though remote from the centre of Iranian civilization in Sasanian times, spoke languages which can be classified as Middle Iranian. In theregion of the upper Oxus a kingdom hadbeen founded by the so-called Hephthalites. In 565 A.D. they were defeated byjoint forces of

IRANO-TURKISH RELATIONS
Sasanians and Turks, but as late asthe 8th century, Chinese sources are still found referring to a "king of the Hephthalites", although since their defeat the Hephthalites appear tohave been subjected toa Turkish overlord. According to Chinese sources, they shared thesame way of life as the Turks, both being nomads, but thenature of the cultural exchanges between the two peoples has yet to beestablished. For their coinage, the Hephthalites developed a special kind of writing, derived from theKushan script, and samples of it found in Turfan show that their written language was Middle Iranian.1 It must beassumed, then, that thespoken language of at least part of the Hephthalites was also Middle Iranian.
More important for the study of Turkish culture are the Sakas (Scythians) whose language was also Middle Iranian. These Scythians, who were known to the OldPersians and Greeks from as early as 600 B.C., held sway from the Pontic Steppes to the river Jaxartes until around thestart of the 5 th century A.D. In the2nd century A.D., they became overlords ofnorth-west India, and the Chinese refer tothem by the character stk (Sai in southern Farghana).2 Onthe whole, however, they had little intercourse with Turkish peoples, apart from skirmishes with those nomads. One branch of the Sakas who founded a kingdom in Khotan (in the Tarim basin) were zealous Buddhists who may have been converts from Zoroastrianism (but notfrom Zurvanism or Manichaeism). In the early period, the technical terms of Buddhism in the Saka language had reflected a late Indian spirit with influences from Prakrit, but from the time of the well-known Chinese pilgrim and Buddhist translator of the 7th century, Hsiian-tsang, these were mostly derived from the Sanskrit of the Sarvastivadins. Documents in Saka language, written onleather, wood or paper, and dating from the 7th to the 10th centuries, have been found in Khotan and in Tumshuq (T'ien-shan nan-lu, "Silk road south of the T'ien-shan"); these documents arewritten in theIndian Brahmi script and show a number of linguistic variants between thetwodistricts.3 Manuscripts found in Murtuq (intheoasis of Turfan) have twelve additional characters to denote Iranian sounds foreign to Sanskrit phonetics.4 These " n e w " characters arealso found in some Turkish manuscripts in theBrahmi

script1 which may have been written by Sakas orTokharians after they had fallen under the dominance ofthe Turkish language. Another people ofthe same language group ofgreat importance for the culture ofthe Turks are the Sogdians. Their homeland, Sogdiana, with its capital Marakanda, later to be known as Samarqand,had suffered under the occupation of Alexander the Great and many had
fled to seek a new home further east.2 Samarqand's importance on the Silk Road from Ch'ang-an to Byzantium must have stimulated an interest intrade with the east, and Sogdians founded numerous settlements along this caravan route without, however, establishing a kingdom of their own. Among theextant Sogdian manuscripts are the "Ancient letters" on paper dating from the beginning ofthe 4thcentury A.D., found near Tun-huang innorth west China andaddressed to their commercial centre in Samarqand. According to one of them, there were atthat time about ahundred Sogdian princes from Samarqandin Tun-huang. Other manuscripts inSogdian have been found elsewhere, particularly inTurfan, most ofwhich date to the 9th or 10th century, but with afew from the 8thand 1 ith. From Mount Mugh in present day Tajikistan come some commercial letters written on leather by aSogdian dewdsttc ("small king"), dating to the time of the Arab conquestin the beginning ofthe 8th century; one ofthem is written in "Runic" script (see below p. 622) butit has not, to date, been convincingly interpreted.
Extant Sogdian Buddhist texts are mostly translations from Chinese and are comparatively late in date. But the Sogdians themselves must have been Buddhists from much earlier times, for from the 2nd century A.D. colophons of Chinese Buddhist texts refer to translators into Chinese from An (Bukhara) and K'ang-kii (Samarkand and itsneigh
bourhood).3 Further proof of this is supplied by archaeology, although, as yet, only fragments ofstatues have been found. Sogdian Buddhism, however, showed the influence of the former religion of the country, Zoroastrianism, which appears to have staged a revival in Sasanian times. In630,Hsiian-tsang came across only ruins of Buddhist temples, while former Buddhist monasteries had been given over to the Zoro
astrians.4 Buddhism was not the only religion found among the Sogdians in

addition to Zoroastrianism. The syncretistic religion founded in the 3rd century A.D. by Man! wasat first favoured by the Sasanian king Shapur I (241-72) but later banned, and Man! himself was killed. Many of his followers fled, either west to Egypt, or east to Mongolia, the Tarim basin andas far as the Chinese capital Ch'ang-an, where they were allowed to establish a cultural centre. Many fine Manichaean texts in Sogdian have been found in Turfan and Tun-huang. Nestorian Christianity also existed in Sogdiana, theTarim basin and China, andmany Sogdian andsome Turkish manuscripts with Christian content have been discovered in Turfan andin particular in the village of Bulayiq. The Christian-Chinese stele of Si-an-fu of 781 A.D. is well-known. Other cultural influences reached the Turks from non-Iranian peoples. For instance, there hadbeen Chinese settlers in theTarim basin since the military activities of the Han Dynasty in the 2nd century B.C.; there were the Tokharians of Kuca, who spoke a west Indo-European language; andthe Tibetans in the southern part of the Tarim basin. Further east, the Tabghach, a people of an Altaic language, ruled over the northern part of China in the 5th-6th century A.D., but by the time of the earliest Turks their kingdom of "Northern Wei"was in a state of decline. All these peoples were now eclipsed bythe Sasanians, the fame of whose civilization spread throughout Central Asia. In theChinese dynastic histories theterm " T u r k " is mentioned for the first time in a reference under the year 552 A.D. to a people who, at least in theeastern half of their empire, called themselves Kok-Tiirk. Up to that date they had been under the rule of the Juan-juan, a people of uncertain race and language, butwho, like them, were nomadsand horse breeders. In 552,however, the Turks rebelled against their overlords and their ruler adopted thetital of Qaghan, that is, virtually ruler over the peoples ofthe steppes, a title which had been well-known in Central Asia since the 3rd century. The Turkish empire ofthe steppes quickly spread to thesouth as far as theborders of China, to thewest as farasthe Aral Sea and to the south west asfarasBactria, controlling even the kingdoms of the Tarim basin. Except for a break of three generations, their empire lasted until the middle of the 8th century when it was overthrown bythe Uigurs who dominated thesteppes for approximately a hundred years. In 840,they were defeated bythe Kirghiz Turks and the survivors fled south, south west and west. The bulk of the refugees came to Turfan where they founded a king

dom which lasted, partly under Mongol supremacy, up till modern
times.1
The Kok-Tiirks worshipped theGod of Heaven, anEarth Goddess and thespirits of their ancestors. Attheend of the 6thcentury,Buddhists from north China sent the Qaghan a Buddhist canonical text entitled Nirvana-sutra2 in an attempt to convert his people. The Chinese sources which mention this fact do not state into which language the text was translated from the original Sanskrit, but it was probably Sogdian, which waswidely used at that time. In 568, the Western Turkish Qaghan Istami sent an envoy to the Byzantine Emperor Justinian II ona trade mission, choosing, nota Turk, but the Sogdian Maniak who took with hima letter in "Scythian characters" which theEmperor made hisinterpreter translate for him. Again, in 841 it was a Christian Sogdian from Samarkand, by the name of Nesfarn, whom the Uigur Qaghan chose to send to theking of Tibet and who left an inscription in Sogdian added to a Nestorian cross in Ladakh in thecourse of his journey. Asfortheoldest known inscription of the Old Turks, that ofBugut inMongolia, it,too, is written in Sogdian (seebelow p. 621).3 In fact, in the 6thcentury the Turkish language wasnotsufficiently developed to be able to express the involved concepts of Buddhism. Thus it is more than likely that the Nirvdna-siitrasent tothe Qaghan ofthe steppes had been translated,not into Turkish, butinto Sogdian which would have been familiar to the Turks of the upper classes.
This 6thcentury mission must have been successful, although there is no reference to this in Chinese or other sources: thebasic technical terms andproper names of Old Turkish (Uigur) Buddhism show the influence of Sogdian teachers in that they arepredominately derived, not from Sanskrit, thesacred language of Buddhism, butfrom Middle Iranian and, in particular, Sogdian. Some words even betray the Zoroastrian past of the Sogdians.4

From this large number of Middle Iranian elements in fundamental
Uigur Buddhism it is clear that it was neither the Indians nor the
Chinese but the Sogdians who first brought about the conversion of
the Turks to their religion. (These missionary activities were later
carried on by the Tokharians, for most Sanskrit technical terms of
Buddhism in Uigur have been modified in some way by Tokharian.
This second wave of missionary activity must have taken place under
Tokharian and Chinese influence when, after the fall of the empire of
the steppes, the Uigurs came to Qoco which was mostly Buddhist.)
Every religion undergoes some change in form and practice when it
spreads beyond the boundaries of its original birthplace. Thus, the first

TURKS AND SOGDIANS
Buddhists in north central India hadnotattempted to represent the Buddha nor to develop a definite iconography of the saints. This was achieved under the influence of the Graeco-Indian and Middle Iranian spirit ofGandhara, Bactria and Sogdiana, when artists began to develop a standardized representation of the Buddhas, the Bodhisattvas, gods, demons etc. It found its way to theTarim basin andeven as far as China andJapan; for example sacred heroes such as theFour Lords of the Heavenly Quadrants, Vajrapani, theBuddha's bodyguard and the gods Indra and Brahma are depicted clad in armour derived either from the Parthians orthe Sasanians; and the magnificent diadems ofthe gods and the Bodhisattvas have their prototype in Sasanian Iran.
As wasthe case with the Chinese, the popular Buddhism of the Uigurs was influenced bythe ideas and images ofIranian religion; for instance, the fundamental doctrine of Buddhism is the law of retribution in some future existence forall good and evil deeds, called karma, a doctrine that was perhaps softened, possibly by filial piety, under the influence of Zoroastrianism. According to non-canonical Buddhist texts, every dead person has seven days, twice seven, three times seven up to seven times seven days, a hundred days, three hundred days and then three years to submit to the judgment of the Ten Kings of Purgatory. Two young men or one man and one woman bring scrolls recording the good and evil deeds he has done inhis lifetime, whilehe sees in a mirror all his sins. In a vision he is shown thesix rebirths (Skr. gati) possible according to his past behaviour: as god, man, animal, hungry ghost (Skr. pretd), demon (Skr. asura) or inhabitant of hell (Skr. ndraka). Inan illustrated Uigur scroll,1 the " animal" existence is symbolized by a goat and a wolf whom the Buddhist teachers thus debased torepresent one of the lower forms ofexistence, the wolf being as much thesacred animal of the pre-Buddhist Turks as thegoat had been ofthe Zoroastrian Iranians. Many ofthe symbols and pictures are known from older Iranian prototypes.2 According to Buddhist teaching, redemption followed ifthe dead person's family recited and copied holy texts on his behalf. Aholy guide, called " Storehouse ofthe earth" (Skr. ksitigarbha) would then appear to the terrified soul andlead him to Amitabha, the Buddha of Eternal Light, in his Western Paradise. The idea of "Light" and "West" also suggest some Iranian origin.3
Manichaeism came tothe Uigurs through the Sogdians of Ch'ang-an.

IRANO-TURKISH RELATIONS
In 762, the Uigur emperor of the steppes came to Ch'ang-an with a strong army to support the Chinese emperor inhis struggle against the insurgent An Lu-shan, andafter defeating him, theQaghan together with some ofhis people remained in the neighbourhood ofthe capital, where he wasin contact with Chinese civilization. Here he became acquainted with andimpressed by Manichaeism as practised by the Sogdians and heasked forManichaean missionaries to be sent to him when he returned home. An account of the ensuing scene has been preserved both by a contemporary Uigur report1 and by a Sogdian miniature:2 four Sogdian missionaries arrived at the Qaghan's court and for a whole night he discoursed with them; finally, at dawn, the emperor put ona golden diadem (didim < Sog. hihim- < Gk.), dressed himself in thepurple cloak (a/ ton^ the paludamentum of the Byzantine emperor), and seated himself on the golden throne {altunluyorgiri), another Sasanian importation, for theSasanians used to sit at ease on chairs with their feet crossed and pointing downwards. Hethen proclaimed Manichaeism in place of Buddhism as thenew religion of the empire. The Sogdian origins for Uigur Manichaeism are also seen in the Middle Iranian derivations ofthe titles ofthe hierarchy and ofa number of technical terms found inUigur Manichaean texts, as, for instance, the following:
amvardih "assembly, collection" < Parth. ' anoiagan "immortals" < MP from Turfan ' arqon"the First" < Sog. < Gk. drypn

TURKS AND SOGDIANS
Manv Turkish Manichaean texts aretranslations from the Middle
Iranian, such as the Xwastwdmfty1 & prayer ofconfession with dogmatic introduction, andsome hymns. Other hymns, of high literary value, are of Turkish origin. Buddhist terms arefrequently used in Turkish Manichaean texts, although their meaning has changed; inthis respect, they resemble the Manichaean Sogdian texts which hadbeen grafted on to Buddhist stock. The Turks also hadrecourse, though to a limited extent, to Middle Iranian for their liturgy, as is proved by some texts in Kok
Turk "Runic" writing.2 Nestorian Christianity must have been preached to theTurks not only by Syriac monks but also by Sogdian missionaries, for many Christian texts both in Syriac and in Sogdian have been found in the village ofBulayiq (in the oasis ofTurfan), together with a few Turkish
fragments.3 The Uigar version of the visit of the Magi to the infant Jesus gives evidence of this missionary activity among fire worshippers, in other words among the Iranian people. There isalso evidence inHsiian-tsang's report ofa fire cult amongst the Turks of the western Qaghanate of the steppe in the 7th century, while, inthe inscription tothe memory ofprince Kiiltegin ofA.D. 733, which mentions odtdngri," the God of Time", there is even asuggestion
of Iranian Zurvanism.4 There are many more borrowings from Middle Iranian in Turkish culture to be mentioned. Although theTurks learned writing soon after the foundation oftheir empire, their oldest inscription, as we have seen (see above p.617), was in Sogdian, the lingua franca ofthe time, and in the Sogdian script, asis shown in the inscription near Bugut. Only with the beginnings ofnationalism atthe start ofthe 8th century did theKok-Turk, and later theUigur Qaghans in the9thcentury, write their inscriptions in their ownlanguage alongside a version
in Chinese or Chinese and Sogdian.5 The script used for these

IRANOTURKISH RELATIONS
inscriptions, the so-called Kok-Tiirk "Runic" writing, was a livelyadaptation, perhaps by a Sogdian, of cursive Aramaic, and indeed the Sogdian, "Uigur" and Manichaean scripts can all be attributed to the epigraphical inventiveness of the Sogdians. (For manuscripts in Brahml script, see above p. 614). Most Uigur manuscripts are written in "late Sogdian" or "Uigur" script; Old Turkish books were first written in the shape of codices like many Sogdian texts, but this format was later supplanted by the Indian palm-leaf books or the Chinese scroll.
Although they referred to it as bir (< Ch. pi < piet), the writing implement used by the Uigurs was not the brush of the Chinese but the reed pen, qalam ( < Sog. < Gk. /caAa/xo?); the word for paper, which is a Chinese invention dating from the beginning of the 2nd century A.D., is kdgdd\kagda in Uigur, being derived from Sogdian kydyh. The Sogdians were obviously the writing masters of the Turks. Miniature paintings have so far been found only in Turfan, the early centre of Middle Iranian, Chinese and Turkish culture. The oldest of these, which were probably painted in the 7th and 8th centuries, come from Middle Iranian books. Only the later ones, possibly of the n t h century, are taken from Uigur works, but scholars have not yet determined a definite Middle Iranian origin for them or reached any firm conclusions about their circulation amongst the Turks.
When they adopted the imperial title of Qaghan, the Kok-Tiirk chose the law of the steppe, but some of their titles prove their respect for Middle Iranian culture, as, for example:
OT fad < Sog. or Bactr. *Jfa8 ~
OTjabyu < Kusanyavuga-^ horn yam- "to OT iadapit < OP *satapati
OT zJfbara, to be compared with Isparaka, the name of a vassal Saka in north
west India at the beginning of our era.1
A most important title was bag (< Sog. by "god, lord"), as was t(e)ginwhich is derived from the Kushan domain.
Apart from these titles of the Kok-Tiirk period and the technical terms in Buddhism and Manichaeism which we have mentioned, there are further loan words taken from everyday life which testify to the Turks' familiarity with the Sogdian language; among these are the Uigur words :
1 P. Aalto, "Iranian contacts of the Turks in Pre-lslamic Times", in L. Ligeti (ed.), Studia Turcica (Budapest, 1971), pp. 29-37 (Bibliotheca orientalis hungarica 17); J. p! Asmussen, "Die Iranier in Zentralasien", AO xxvn (1963), pp. 119-27.

The Uigur emperor, as we have seen (see above p. 620), took over from the Sogdians such symbols of authority as the diadem, the purple cloak and the royal throne. Other symbols of Middle Iranian origin include the jewel of a prince, C2\ledy(a)/w(,a)s, < Pers. < Gk. aXdfias; the short veil of the Sasanian kings was used by the Tabghach nobility, who are depicted bearing gifts in the 5 th century Buddhist cave temples in Yiin-kang in north east China;1 it is also found worn by the Ten Buddhist Kings of Purgatory and even by higher Uigur nobles. The lion, ars/an,was both the emblem and title of every Uigur king, and as the animal was not found in Central Asia but in Iran, this indicates a Uigur borrowing from the Sasanian royalty. Similarly, the crescent in the Sasanian crown came to be given to Buddhist deities and Bodhisattvas in both Central Asia and China.
In the middle of the 9th century, the Uigur Qaghan of the steppe, with the intention of introducing the nomad Turks gradually to the sedentary life, gave orders for a number of Chinese as well as of Sogdians to build him a "rich town".2 To a Central Asian people the concept of " t o w n " was specifically Iranian, being represented by kent ( < Sog. knSh), although it is also covered by a genuine Turkish word baliq. The Mir kar (Khotanese Saka kara, "fort, town") is to be found in the name Kashghar. Even the Uigur word for "mortuary building" (suburyan < Sog. %mryyri) is of Sogdian origin. The Sogdians, as the most important traders along the caravan route, acted as the middlemen providing the Uigurs with luxury goods, the names of which are frequently derived, at least indirectly, from Sogdian, such as
bor"raisin wine" < MP bwr — Gk. botros bdkini"wine from millet" < Sog. byny

Trade along the Silk Road was of benefit to all the countries of Central Asia through which it passed because of transit taxes, to cope with which nomadic methods of barter were obviously inadequate. Consequently, Sogdian, as well as Chinese merchants, were responsible for the introduction of certain weights and measures as: Uig. batman "a weight" < Mir ptm'n;znd stir"(stamped) coin" < Sog.styr < Gk.
This short chapter has dealt only with the linguistic and cultural influences onOld Turkish from Middle Iranian. For the reverse process the reader is referred to G. Doerfer's Mongolische und tiirkische 'Elemente im Neupersischen. There are a surprising number of Turkish borrowings found in New Persian, and some even in Middle Iranian. Still, it was Iranian peoples whose cultural influence was most widely felt in Central Asia at the beginning of the Middle Ages; the Turks were asyet comparative newcomers whose role it was to preserve and develop these cultural elements for a later time.

CHAPTER 4
This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of sources on Sassanian Iran, for
which consult *Christensen, Ulran, pp. 50-83.1 Rather, it is first an overall guide to bibliographies on specific subjects, and second a chronological survey of the most important sources for the political history of Sassanian Iran.
All Sassanian inscriptions will be contained in the Corpus Inscriptionum Iranicarum published in London and now in progress. A preliminary glossary
has been prepared by P. Gignoux, Glossaire des inscriptions pehlevies et parties, London, 1972 (Cllr Supplementary Series 1). The two basic works on the great inscription of Shapur are M. Sprengling, Third Century Iran, Sapor and Kartir (Chicago, 1953) and*Maricq, "Res Gestae". For other inscriptions the main publication is E. Herzfeld, Paiku/i (Berlin, 1924).
Sassanian numismatics are conveniently summarized by R. Gobi, Sassanian Numismatics (Brunswick, 1971) where an extensive bibliography on the subject may be found. Seals and clay sealings may be found in the relevant volumes of the Cllr. Bibliographical references to the inscriptions on them, and on all Iranian inscriptions from the Sassanian period, may be found in *Henning, " Mitteliranisch ".
Zoroastrian Pahlavi literature is surveyed by J. Tavadia, Die mittelpersische Sprache und Literatur der Zarathustrier (Leipzig, 1956) p. 141. In this book the bibliographies of editions, and studies on each of them, will aid the reader.
Arabic and Persian sources on the Sassanians are discussed by Christensen, op. cit, pp. 59-74, and a full bibliography is in B. Spuler, Iran infruhislamischer Zeit (Wiesbaden, 1952) pp. 535-64. Nothing has replaced the remarks of Christensen op. cit. on Greek and Latin sources (pp. 73-7), Armenian sources (pp. 77-9) and Syriac sources (pp. 80-3). The overall history of the succession of Sassanian rulers is covered by Tabari (see especially *N6ldeke, Tabari) and by *Firdausi. Although other works, such as the Arabic text of al-Tha'alibi, edited and translated into French by H. Zotenberg, Histoire des rois des Perses (Paris, 1900), contain information not found in Tabari or Firdausi, those two are the most important general histories upon which many others are based. Firdausi, of course, contains many fanciful stories, but cannot be ignored if used with caution. For the beginning of the Sassanian dynasty, we have a plethora of material. The most important Classical source is Agathias, edited in a recent publication by R. Keydell (Berlin, 1967). All sources are surveyed in G. Walser and T. Pekary, Die Krise des romischen Keiches (Berlin, 1962). A summary of events, with selected translations from various sources is given in J. Gage, La montee des Sassanides (Paris, 1964).
After the death of Shapur I, there follows a dearth of information until

the time of Shapur II. For his reign we have the long account of his wars with the Romans by Ammianus Marcellinus, edited and trans, into English by J. C. Rolfe (LCL, London, 1935). In the 4th century, for the first time, we have the Syriac acts of the Persian martyrs which, in addition to religious matters, contain items of information significant for political history. G. Wiesner has studied these accounts in his
Zur Mdrtyreruberlieferung aus der Christenverfolgung Schapurs II, A A WG LXVII (1967). The Syriac chronicles, while occasionally having items of interest to Iran, are generally disappointing as sources for the political history of Iran under the Sassanians. In the reign of Yazdagird I and throughout the 5 th century the Armenian sources begin to throw light on Sassanian history, and they give us information in addition to the standard texts of Tabari and Firdausi. For the early part of the century the chronicles of Lazar of P'arp and of Elise, although concerned with the history of Armenia, are also of value for Iranian history. Translated into French under the auspices of V. Langlois, Collection des
historiens anciens et modernes de VArmenie 11 (Paris, 1869), pp. 183-368, both translations need to be controlled by the newer and best editions of each: Lazar, Patmufiun Hayoc, ed. Ter-Mkrtzean (Tiflis, 1904), and Elise, Vasn Vardanac ew Hayoc Paterae/Kin, ed. E. Ter-Minasean (Erevan, 1957). Priscus, ed. L. Dindorff, Historici Graeci Minores 1 (Leipzig, 1870), pp. 275-352, or ed. C. Miiller, Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum iv (Paris, 1868) pp. 29-110, has interesting information about the reign of Peroz. For the end of the 5 th century and the beginning of the 6th, especially the reigns of Kavad and the beginning of Khusrau I we have detailed account of the wars between Persians and Byzantines in Procopius; History of the Wars, ed. and tr. H. B. Dewing (LCL, London, 1961). Agathias, mentioned above, is also an important source for the reign of Khusrau I. The Mazdakite movement has evoked two books, one by A. Christensen,
Le regne du roi Kawddh I et le communisme Mazdakite (Copenhagen, 1925) and O. Klima, Ma^dak (Prague, 1957). The Syriac chronicle of Joshua the Stylite, ed. and tr. W.Wright (Cambridge, 1882) is especially useful for Kavad's reign, although many Byzantine authors writing in Greek are just as im
portant for the events of the 6th and 7th centuries.x The Corpus Scriptorum Historicorum Byzantinorum, published in the first half of the 19th century at Bonn^ contains the texts of relevant authors. For the last century of Sassanian rule we have a number of valuable chronicles such as the so-called Syriac "Anonymous of Guidi", first edited by I. Guidi in the CSCO series 3, vol. iv, and translated by T. Noldeke in SWAW CXXVIII (1893), no. ix.Fora detailed bibliography of this period see P. Goubert, Byname avant VIslam 1 (Paris, 1951), pp. 3325. For the 7th century the massive number of Arabic sources completely changes our view of the history of Iran, bringing it from the shadows into the full light of detailed chronicles.
