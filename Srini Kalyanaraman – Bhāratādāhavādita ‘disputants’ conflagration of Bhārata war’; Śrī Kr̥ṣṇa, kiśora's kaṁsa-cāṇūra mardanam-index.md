Bhāratādāhavādita ‘disputants’ conflagration of Bhārata war’; Śrī K ̥rṣṇa, kiśora's kaṁsa-cāṇūra mardanam
This is an addendum to:
Divine avatāra revealed, 11year youth, Śrī K ̥rṣṇa (DOB 27 July 3112 BCE) ends misrule of kaṃsa cāṇūra 17 Feb. 3102, Kaliyuga starts https://tinyurl.com/bdy6fbbw
The Calukya Pulakesi II Aihole inscription has perhaps the earliest reference to Kali Yuga date. See transcribed text and translation of the inscription at Annex: Chalukya Pulakesi’s Aihole Inscription.
I agree with ML Raja on his reading of Aihole Inscription, Kali 3735 & 634 CE (1385 years
before present). The meaning of the expression is: ‘After Mahabharata war, when in Kali
Yuga 3735 years and in Saka Era 556 years were elapsed, the stone temple was constructed
and the inscription was inscribed’. Saka Era 556 is 634 (556+78) of Common Er as the Saka
Era begins in 78 CE. Therefore, Common Era 634 is 3735 of Kali Yuga. Then it meant that Kali yuga began in 3101 BCE (3735-634). Chaluky Pulakesi II ruled from 610 to 642 CE. He was contemporary of Mahendravarman I (600 to 630 CE) of Pallava Dynasty of
Kanchipuram and Harshavardhana Silditya (606 to 647 CE) of Sthanesvara and Vardhana
(Pushyabhuti) Dynasty...The inscription mentions the victory of Pulakesi II over Harsha and
also mentions the poets Kalidasa and Bharavi. The inscriber was a poet by name Ravikirti. Saka 556 is 634 CE (556+78). Then Kali yuga 3735 is also 634 CE. Thus, it shows that the Kali yuga began in 3101 BCE (3738-3101 = 634 CE) and it is within the regnl period of
Chalukya Pulakesi II (610-642 CE).” (M.L. Raja, 2020, Kali yuga—inscriptional evidence, a description of 436 inscriptions in Kali yuga date; a source book to rewrite Indian history, Delhi, Bluerose Publishers, pp. 4-5).
Discussing the expression Bhāratādāhavādita,Jayasree Saranathan notes: “This is a clear indication of the abdication of the throne by Yudhishthira that took place at the beginning of Kali Yuga.” http://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2021/04/abdication-of-throne-bypandavas-marked.html
I submit that this is a generalisation; the expression Bhārata ādāha vādita used by Ravikirti cannot be stretched to be a reference to Yudhishthira.

त्रिंशुत्स त्रसहेस्रषु भारता दाह वात्दतः सप्ताब्द शतयेुक्तषु शतेेश्वब्दषु पञ्चसु पञ्चाशुत्स कलौ काले षट्सु पिंचशतसु च समासु समतीतासु शकानामत्प भूभुजािं
The reading is: 3735 (30+3000+700+5) years have already elapsed since Bharata war and 556 (50+6+500) years since Saka era is running (on the date of engraving of the inscription.
In a remarkable blogpost, I find the rationale for the expression: शतेेश्वब्दषु This blogpost
notes: “...we see 2 words, ‘asva + abdha’. Aswa means ‘horse’, Abda means Sea....Panchasu
Panchashatasu means 55 years. So, if we all all, it means, 700 years back has passed since 55 years of horses coming from sea. This indicates 55 years of horse import happened from Sakas before 700 years (Maybe sea trade stopped with Sakas due to a war, so the year since this crucial horse import (via sea) stopped 700 years back, which was counted due to strategic importance is also mentioned). We need to consider this (breaking of Maryan rules on sea trade) as in the same inscription the following lines appear, (v.20) In the Konkanas the
impetuous waves of the forces directed by Him speedily swept away the rising wavelets of
pools – the Mauryas (and pallavas too). So the sea ports that could bring ‘Arabian horses’
were taken after long time (since Mauryan times). After breaking Konkan, Pulakesi attacks
other kingdoms by sea, as seen by the lines followed...(v.21) When radiant like the destroyer
of Pura, He besieged Puri, the Fortune of the western sea, with hundreds of ships in appearance like arrays of rutting elephants, the sky, dark – blue as a young lotus and covered with tiers of massive clouds, resembled the sea, and the sea was like the sky. Also the famous



3
Ajantha painting of Pulakesi 2’s court scene shows envoys from Persia (the dressing is very
clear). Also note the horses were standing with Persian people at the door. Does this represent
restart of horse trade with Arabia? Horse trade was a major political statement of
strengthening military in India...If there was a blockade due to Ashoka to trade horse down
south without notice (or subsequent blockade by coastal kingdoms like Konkan), Karnataka
military power was stunted. Pulakesi-2 breaking such a blockade marks a major event. That is
why this painting is done in Ajantha. How can such a ‘major event’ will be missing in an inscription like that of ‘Ravikeerthi’, that lists all the achievements of Pulekesi-2?...c) Kalaukale Shatasu Panchashatsucha = Kalaukale means ‘now/this year running’ (6 and 500)
is 506 years passed.” https://www.myindiamyglory.com/2018/10/27/what-aihole-inscriptionof-meguti-temple-tell-about-mahabharata-war-date/
The transcribed inscription reads: भारता दाह वात्दतः This should by grammatical declension be treated as a samāsa (compound expression) composed of words, Bhārata ādāha
vāditah । The meaning is: ‘disputants’ conflagration of Bhārata war.’
vādita mfn. (fr. Caus. of √vad) made to speak or to be uttered &c. (Monier-Williams)
वादित vādita p. p. 1 Caused to be uttered, made to speak. वादिन् vādin a. [वद्
त्ित्न ] 1 Speaking, talking, discoursing. -2 Asserting. -3 Disputing. -4 Designating, designated as; यर यर वनोेद्दशे सत्त्ाः पुरुषवात्दनः । वृक्ाः पुरुष - नामानेस्त सवे स्त्रीजनाभवन् ॥ Rām.7.87.13. 5 Talking pleasantly; Rām.2.36.3 (com. वात्दन्यः परत्चत्ता - कषषकवचनचतुराः ). -m. 1 A speaker.
2 A disputant, an antagonist; तस्याङ्गीकरिेन वात्दन इव स्यात् स्वात्मनो त्नग्रहः Mu.5.10; R.12.92. (Apte)
I submit that the conflagration has its first manifestation in the elimination of the evil rule
of kaṁsa-cāṇūra by the young 11 year old, kiśora, in the prime of youth, divine avatāra of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa. I submit that this emphatic manifestation of the Supreme Divine in avatāra of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa is the principal reason why Siddhantic astronomers selected this date 3101-2 BCE as
the start date of Kali Yuga. Skymap affirmed the selection.

[quote]ŚB 10.45.3
नास्मत्तो युवयोस्तात त्नत्योत्कण्ठितयोरत्प । बाल्यपौगण्डकै शोरा : पुराभ्यामभवन्‍्ककवत्चत् ॥ ३ ॥
nāsmatto yuvayos tāta nityotkaṇṭhitayor api bālya-paugaṇḍa-kaiśorāḥ putrābhyām abhavan kvacit
Synonyms
na — not; asmattaḥ — because of Us; yuvayoḥ — for you two; tāta — O dear father; nitya always; utkaṇṭhitayoḥ — who have been in anxiety; api — indeed; bālya — (the pleasures of) the toddler age; paugaṇḍa — boyhood; kaiśoraḥ — and youth; putrābhyām — because of your two sons; abhavan — there were; kvacit — at all.
Translation
[Lord Kṛṣṇa said:] Dear Father, because of Us, your two sons, you and mother Devakī
always remained in anxiety and could never enjoy Our childhood, boyhood or youth.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī discusses this verse as follows: “One may object that at this point Lord Kṛṣṇa had not actually passed the kaiśora stage [age ten to fifteen], since the women of Mathurā had stated, kva cāti-sukumārāṅgau kiśorau nāpta-yauvanau: ‘Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma have very tender limbs, being still at the kiśora stage, not having reached adolescence.’
(Bhāg. 10.44.8) The definition of the different stages of growing up is given as follows:
kaumāraṁ pañcamābdāntaṁ paugaṇḍaṁ daśamāvadhi kaiśoram ā-pañcadaśād yauvanaṁ tu tataḥ param
‘The kaumāra stage lasts until the age of five, paugaṇḍa up to age ten and kaiśora to age
fifteen. From then on, one is known as yauvana.’ According to this statement,
the kaiśora period ends at the age of fifteen. Kṛṣṇa was only eleven years old when He killed Kaṁsa, according to Uddhava’s words: ekādaśa-samās tatra gūḍhārciḥ sa-balo ’vasat. ‘Like a covered flame, Lord Kṛṣṇa remained there incognito with Balarāma for eleven years.’ (Bhāg. 3.2.26) And since Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma never took brahminical initiation in Vrajabhūmi, it was at the time [of Their going to Mathurā] that Their kaiśora stage began rather than
ended.[unquote]

Annex: Chalukya Pulakesi’s Aihole Inscription
This inscription, lauding the achievements of Pulakesi II or Satyasraya, one of the greatest of the Badami Chalukyas was composed by the court poet of the king, Ravikirti as a Sanskrit Poem and is installed in Meguti Temple at Aihole in 634 AD, when Pulakesi was at the peak of his career. One important thing to note is that this may be the last inscription in India which dated Mahabharata. Another quote, for which this inscription is famous for the quote
Harsha’s harsha(joy) melted away by fear
The translation first and the original below
(Verse.) Victorious is the holy Jinendra – he who is exempt from old age, death and birth – in the sea of whose knowledge the whole world is comprised like an island.
(V. 2.) And next, long victorious is the immeasurable, wide ocean of the Chalky family, which is the birth – place of jewels of men that are ornaments of the diadem of the earth.
(V. 3.) And victorious for very long is Satyashraya, who in bestowing gifts and honours on the brave and on the learned, both together on either, observes not the rule of correspondency of number.
(V. 4.) When many members of that race, bent on conquest, applied to whom the title of Favourite of the Earth had at last become appropriate, had passed away,
(V. 5.) There was, of the Chalky lineage, the king named Jayasimha – vallabha, who in battle – where horses, foot soldiers and elephants, bewildered, fell down under the strokes of many hundreds of weapons, and where thousands of frightful headless trunks and of flashes of rays of swords were leaping to and fro – by his bravery made Fortune his own, even though she is suspected of fickleness.
(V. 6.) His son was be who was named Ranaranga, of divine dignity, the one master of the world, whose superhuman nature, (even) when he was asleep, people knew from the pre eminence of his form.
(V. 7.) His son was Pulakeshin, who, though endowed with the moon’s Beauty, and though
the favourite of Fortune, became the bridegroom of Vatapipuri.



6
(V. 8.) Whose path in the pursuit of the three objects of life the kings on earth even now are unable to follow; and bathed by whom with the water of the purificatory rite, when he performed the horse – sacrifice, the earth beamed with brightness.
(V. 9.) His son was Kirtivarman, the night of doom to the Nalas, Mauryas and Kadambas,
whose mind, although his thoughts kept aloof from others’ wives, was attracted by the
Fortune of his adversary.
(V. 10.) Who, having secured the fortune of victory by his valour in war, being a scent elephant of a king, of great strength, at once completely broke down the multitude of the broad kadamba trees – the Kadambas.
(V. 11.) When his desire was bent on the dominion of the lord of the gods, his younger brother Mangalesha became king, who by the sheets of dust of his army of horse, encamped on the shores of the eastern and western seas stretched an awning over the quarters.
(V. 12.) Who in that house which was the battle – field took in marriage the damsel, the Fortune of the Kalachchuris, having scattered the gathering gloom – the array of elephants, with hundreds of bright – rayed lamps, (viz.) the swords.
(V. 13) And again, when he was desirous of taking the island of Revati, his great army with
many bright banners, which had ascended the ramparts, as it was reflected in the water of the
sea appeared like Varuna’s forces, quickly come there at once at his word.
(V. 14.) When his elder brother’s son, named Pulakeshin, of a dignity like Nahusha’s, was
coveted by Fortune, and finding his uncle to be jealous of him thereat, had formed the resolution to wander abroad as an exile,
(V. 15.) That Mangalesha, whose great strength became on all sides reduced by the application of the powers of good counsel and energy gathered by Him, abandoned, together with the effort to secure the kingdom for his own son, both that no mean kingdom of his and his life.
(V. 16.) Then, on the subversion of that rule encompassed by the darkness of enemies, the whole world grew light again, invaded as it were by the lustrous rays of His irresistible splendour. Or when was it that the sky ceased to be black like a swarm of bees with thundering clouds, in which flashes of lightning were dancing like banners, and the edges of which were crushed in the rushing wind?
(V. 17.) When, having found the opportunity, he who was named Appayika, and Govinda approached with their troops of elephants to conquer the country north of the Bhaimarathi, the one in battle through his armies came to know the taste of fear, while the other at once received the reward of the services rendered by him.
(V. 18.) When He was besieging Vanavasi, which for a girdle has the rows of hamsa birds that sport on the high waves of the Varada as their play – place, and which by its wealth



7
rivalled the city of the gods, that fortress on land, having the surface of the earth all around covered with the great sea of his army, to the looker – on seemed at once converted into a fortress in the water.
(V. 19.) Although in former days they had acquired happiness by renouncing the seven sins, the Ganga and Alupa lords, being subdued by his dignity, were always intoxicated by drinking the nectar of close attendance upon him.
(V. 20.) In the Konkanas the impetuous waves of the forces directed by Him speedily swept away the rising wavelets of pools – the Mauryas.
(V. 21.) When, radiant like the destroyer of Pura, He besieged Puri, the Fortune of the western sea, with hundreds of ships in appearance like arrays of rutting elephants, the sky, dark – blue as a young lotus and covered with tiers of massive clouds, resembled the sea, and the sea was like the sky.
(V. 22.) Subdued by His splendour, the Latas, Malavas and Gurjaras became as it were teachers of how feudatories, subdued by force, ought to behave.
(V. 23.) Harsha, whose lotus – feet were arrayed with the rays of the jewels of the diadems of hosts of feudatories prosperous with unmeasured might, through Him had his mirth melted away by fear, having become loathsome with his rows of lordly elephants fallen in battle.
(V. 24.) While He was ruling the earth with his broad armies, the neighbourhood of the Vindhya, by no means destitute of the lustre of the many sandbanks of the Reva, shone even more brightly by his great personal splendour, having to be avoided by his elephants because, as it seemed, they by their bulk rivalled the mountains.
(V. 25.) Almost equal to Indra, He by means of all the three powers, gathered by him according to rule, and by his noble birth and other excellent qualities, acquired the sovereignty over the three Maharashtrakas with their nine and ninety thousand villages.
(V. 26.) Through the excellencies of their householders prominent in the pursuit of the three objects of life, and having broken the pride of other rulers of the earth, the Kalingas with the Kosalas by His army were made to evince signs of fear.
(V. 27.) Hard pressed by Him, Pishtapura became a fortress not difficult of access; wonderful, the ways of the Kali age to Him were quite inaccessible!
(V. 28.) Ravaged by Him, the water of Kunala – coloured with the blood of men killed with many weapons, and the land within it overspread with arrays of accoutred elephants – was like the cloud – covered sky in which the red evening – twilight has risen.
(V. 29.) With his six fold forces, the hereditary troops and the rest, who raised spotless chowries, hundreds of flags, umbrellas, and darkness, and who churned the enemy elated with the sentiments of heroism and energy, He caused the splendour of the lord of the



8
Pallavas, who had opposed the rise of his power, to be obscured by the dust of his army, and to vanish behind the walls of Kanchipura.
(V. 30.) When straightway He strove to conquer the Cholas, the Kaveri, who has the darting carps for her tremulous eyes, had her current obstructed by the causeway formed by his elephants whose rutting – juice was dripping down, and avoided the contact with the ocean.
(V. 31.) There He caused great prosperity to the Cholas, Keralas and Pandyas, he being the hot – rayed son to the hoar – frost – the army of the Pallavas.
(V. 32.) While He, Satyashraya, endowed with the powers of energy, mastery and good counsel, – having conquered all the quarters, having dismissed the kings full of honours, having done homage to gods and Brahmans, having entered the city of Vatapi – is ruling, like one city, this earth which has the dark – blue waters of the surging sea for its moat;
(V. 33.) (Now) when thirty and three thousand and five years besides, joined with seven hundred years, have passed since the Bharata war;
(V. 34.) And when fifty and six and five hundred years of the Saka kings also have gone by in the Kali age;
(V. 35.) This stone mansion of Jinendra, a mansion of every kind of greatness, has been caused to be built by the wise Ravikirti, who has obtained the highest favour of that Satyashraya whose rule is bounded by the three oceans.
(V. 36.) Of this eulogy and of this dwelling of the Jina revered in the three worlds, the wise Ravikirti himself is the author and also the founder.
(V. 37.) May that Ravikirti be victorious, who full of discernment has used the abode of the Jina, firmly built of stone, for a new treatment of his theme, and who thus by his poetic skill has attained to the fame of Kalidasa and of Bharavi!Inscription of the Chalukya king Pulikeshin II found in a Jain temple at Aihole; Verse 33 and 34 of this inscription gives the date of the Jain temple built by Ravikirti.
