TO THE READER . . .
No one in the world can put together the complete and true story of the development of the greatest invention of them all - the alphabet. This book explores some aspects of how it may have happened - a story of great fascination. In this book the reader may also see that many words contain interesting and tantalizing clues about the dim past. This work is an invitation to the armchair adventurer who wishes to examine possibilities for the origin of the alphabet within a biblical framework for ancient history.

Chapter 1: A MOST CURIOUS WORD
There is no country in the world that is more closely associated with iron than Brazil. Brazil contains some of the richest and most extensive iron deposits in the world. The strange and uncanny relationship between iron and the word Brazil has been remarked upon by scholars for generations. The possibility that the word Brazil is older than Sumer and that the ancients knew about this Island of Iron illustrates the archaeological finds that can be spaded up in words.
The connection between iron and the word Brazil is not proved, but it remains an intriguing possibility. The word for iron in most Semitic languages is BRZL (barzil or barzel), but it is not a Semitic word. A puzzling fact to the Sumeriologist is that the word for iron in that language is PARZILLU or BARZILLU. Long ago this word was carried into Atlantic regions. In the midland counties of England, brazil means iron pyrites, and the English idiom, "hard as brazil," means very literally "hard as iron." It is curious that Old Irish lore spoke of Hy Brazil (various spellings), an otherworld overseas to the west. The word is not Irish but rather is linked with the Phoenicians.
In ancient times as well as in modern, regions noted for their metal deposits were named for the metal found there. Thus Nubia is the Egyptian word for gold; Hatus, the Hittite capital, meant Silver City; Cyprus is the ancient word for copper, and Brazil, as we have shown, was the Land of Iron.
There are three relationships of possible significance. First, the association between Brazil and iron may go all the way back to Genesis 4:22: "Zillah (wife of Lamech) bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron." In many societies the child is son of the mother, not the father. Thus Tubal-cain was also known as Barzillah. The word for iron in both Hebrew and Sumerian could be a link back to the son of Zillah. The following observation fits the above. In 1882 a scholar mused that Barzil, which means iron in Hebrew, comes from Bar, the word for son, while the second syllable means to pour out, and also contributes to a word indicative of violent heat.
Second, scholars have noted the very ancient links between words derived from Tubal-cain and the smith or ironworker. In antiquity a tribe associated with metal working was known as the Tibareni (a modified form of the word Tubal). In a village in the Middle East it was noted that iron sparks were called "tubal." The Roman god of the Tiber (which may also mean Tubal-cain) was Vulcan whose forge is the volcano. Vulcan is associated with fire and metal working. Curiously, Vulcan was said to be a cripple thrown out of heaven by his father Jupiter as punishment for taking his mother's side in a quarrel - a strange link to Genesis because there is reason to believe that Tubal-cain is the young man on whom his father, Lamech, revenged himself, as told in Genesis 4:23 "Adah and Zlllah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, hearken to what I say: I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me" (Victoria Institute, 16:164; Gordon, 1971, p. 119-126; Custance, 1967, p. 6-7).
Third, there is the interesting fact that the last part of the name,Tubal-cain, is the Hebrew word for smith. Another way of spelling Cain is Ken. Ken is a form of the Hebrew word for a copper spear, and the Kenites were a tribe of wandering smiths who made Implements of metal (Horizon, 2:2, November 1959, p. 9).
Thus we have three linguistic paths leading back to Tubal-cain, the first metalsmith, and the country of Brazil, one of the world's oldest place names, may have been well known to very ancient navigators.
The line of Cain and Tubal-cain ended at the Flood, but we can infer that Noah and his sons collected the technology of the Pre-Flood world, including metallurgy, and then taught it to their descendants in the Post-Flood age.
The example above illustrates the kind of attempts linguists make in searching out the past. In the following analysis we shall look at a number of specific words to show how we can discover in them support for at least some of our basic theses about the ancient world.

Chapter 2: THE NAMES USED IN THE PRE-FLOOD WORLD
It is important to know whether there is any necessity to accept the widespread belief that the world before and after the Flood was the same except for a minor local flood. If the destruction was total and universal, the stage was set for an entirely different kind of Post-Flood world. An example is given below to show the way in which the ancients regarded that important question. Several old words are examined to show something of the geographic spread of a culture and the unexpected arrival of a people to an unlikely site in the Jordan valley. Another term which suddenly appears hints at catastrophic events. We see again how ancient place names may help to locate ancient sites. Other words help us gain insights into the culture of ancient peoples, and we show how attempts are made by means of word studies to link biblical events to literary sources outside the Bible. All of these endeavors are of fundamental importance in attempting to explore the ancient past.
It is commonly assumed that the Post-Flood world was roughly the same as the Pre-Flood earth, and that the Flood - if it occurred at all - was a trivial event. Santesson, as well as many others, make statements like the following: "The biblical boundaries of the Garden of Eden are geographically impossible, as anyone can see by consulting an atlas and tracing them" (Santesson, 1970, p. 109).
The geography of the Pre-Flood world is too scantily described in Genesis for any attempt to reconstruct it to our satisfaction. Genesis 2 and 4 list all the geographical proper names we have: four rivers, five physical regions, and one city. British archaeologist Woolley thought he had solved the matter when he reported the discovery of an eight-foot layer of clay in Mesopotamia at Ur. Thus he reported that he had found Noah's Flood. His conjecture, since widely adopted, was that the clay bed was evidence of a local flood, and that ancient flood myths were based on this event.
If this is so, then we must take seriously such place names as Tigris, Euphrates, and Assyria as the same identities both before and after the Flood. Many scholars do indeed take this position. Since the Gihon river is identified with Cush or Ethiopia, the net result is somehow to have the Nile, the Tigris, the Euphrates, and possibly the Ganges all be part of one river system: the river that went out of Eden and parted into four heads, or rivers. All would agree that a nimble mind is required to draw such a conclusion.
Returning for a moment to the "clay" bed, there are two items of interest. First, artifacts were found below and above the layer, supporting the notion of a pre- and post-flood era of minor importance. George Mendenhall of the University of Michigan reports, however, that analysis of the famous layer showed that it was a wind-borne accumulation, and therefore could have had nothing to do with a flood. Further, the layer is not present even a short distance away. Thus Woolley's electrifying news release apparently amounts to nothing at all.
If the Flood was the devastating catastrophe described in Genesis, we can examine the place names of the Pre-Flood world in an entirely different context. We can then picture one land mass with an encircling sea, and low mountains, for the mighty mountain chains we know today sprang up during and after the Flood as the earth strived for equilibrium under the devastation which had come on the earth. After all, in Genesis 1:9 we read: "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto ONE place, and let THE dry land appear."
Another important element must be noted. The earth experienced a stupendous transformation as a result of the Fall. Lamech, the father of Noah, spoke of the awful drudgery and toil of life on a cursed earth - a different kind of earth than the one we know today. In Genesis 5:29 we read: This same (Noah) shall comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, which comes because of the ground which Jehovah has cursed." One of the purposes of the Flood was to bring a measure of relief from the bitter effects of the curse upon the earth. The Pre-Flood earth was truly a land of violence, of monsters and carnivores, of wretched and cursed ground (Whitcomb. 1965, 459-461). Similarly, Delitzsch states that the continents of the globe have undergone great changes since the creation. Changes in the geology of the



Spading Up Ancient Words
https://www.creationism.org/books/vonfange/vonFangeSpadingChap02.htm[2020. 11. 09. 15:25:38]
earth must not all be attributed to the Flood. Many catastrophes may have occurred before and many after, like the catastrophe in which the Dead Sea originated, without being directly recorded in history (Victoria Institute, 25:110).
The original good world followed by the terribly cursed earth may have been swallowed up forever by tectonic plate movements, or buried under miles of sediments. Under this assumption, the Pre-Flood place names have no relationship at all with the same or similar Post-Flood place names. There are a great many examples of names in the Old Testament reappearing after long lapses of time which have no relationship to one another whatsoever.
There is certainly no conclusive evidence that names such as Hiddekel and Euphrates identify the same geographic locations before and after the Flood. New rivers could well have been named in a new world from names carried in the memory of the people (Whitcomb, 1965, p. 83).
Before we examine in some detail the geographical proper names of the Pre-Flood era, we will take brief note of several other words. The word in Hebrew for earth in Genesis 1, Eretz, is plainly the original of the German word for earth, Erde, and our own English word, earth. The account of man being formed from the dust of the earth is revealed in the Aryan languages for man, Homo, for the Latin uses the same root as humus, or the ground. It is remarkable that the most ancient name of Babylon was Tin-tir-ki, which means "the place of the tree of life" (Victoria Institute, 3:252-253; 15:175).
Far from living at first in a primitive stage, the earliest men, according to Genesis 4-5, were sophisticated and skilled in many of the basic elements of civilization. We have names, ages, towns, agriculture, mining and metallurgy, and music. These imply the ability to write, count, build, farm, smelt, and compose by the immediate descendants of Adam (Whitcomb, 1965, p. 40-41).
Just as the New World is littered with Old World geographic names, brought over by settlers, it would not be at all surprising if place names from the Pre-Flood world were applied to entirely new places. If this is true, by far the most interesting of them all, as we shall see below, is the first city in the world, Enoch.
We shall now examine the Pre-Flood place names in the order in which they appear in Genesis.
EDEN, Gen. 2:8. Eden must not be confused with the Eden of Assyria in II Kings 19:12, nor the Eden mentioned in Amos 1:5. The word Eden means delight, and referred to a particular district, more precisely, a place hedged about. The Septuagint uses the word Paradise which again means a hedging round. Some authorities think the word Eden need not be thought of as a proper name. It could be a common noun meaning a plain or steppe, hence a flat area in which the garden was planted. The garden of Eden then means simply the "garden of delight." The scholarly and unscholarly energy consumed in attempting to tie Eden to present-day surface features of the earth is really enormous and really futile. Of course the Middle East receives the most attention, but no region in the world is safe from this kind of conjecture. It seems more reasonable to think of Eden buried miles below the earth or the sea almost anywhere in the world.
PISON or PISHON, Gen. 2:11. Pison is the first of the four rivers associated with the garden of Eden. Various meanings have been ascribed to the root of this word: current, to increase, multitude, to overflow, or that which makes the flax to grow. One or the other of these physical characteristics was used in naming the stream to distinguish it from its three companion rivers. A long succession of speculations has been offered to attempt to relate the Pison to existing streams, but none are convincing.
HAVILAH, Gen. 2:11. Havilah means circle or district, land, or sandy land. The river Pison circled this land. There is no agreement among authorities on its location. Havilah was noted in the Pre-Flood world for its gold, bdellium, and the onyx stone. We are not certain of the meaning of the latter two terms, and many possibilities have been offered. The name Havilah reappears in southern Arabia after the Flood, but there is no reason to associate it with the Pre-Flood land. Two descendants of Noah were named Havilah, and geographical regions were named after one or both of them.
GIHON, Gen. 2:13. Gihon means a bursting forth, stream, or that which arises from the east. By implication it was a swiftly-flowing, impetuous stream. The name reappears long after the Flood for a fountain near Jerusalem where



Spading Up Ancient Words
https://www.creationism.org/books/vonfange/vonFangeSpadingChap02.htm[2020. 11. 09. 15:25:38]
Solomon was taken to be anointed king (I Kings 1:33). Efforts to identify the river Gihon with existing streams have been futile, despite the fact that it circled the land of "Ethiopia," discussed below.
CUSH, Gen. 2:13. The meaning of Cush is uncertain. It may mean black. The word is often identified with Ethiopia and in some translations such as the King James it is given that way. There were, however, one or more regions in Asia called Cush. Ancient tablets mention Cush in Cappadocia in Asia Minor. The Taurus range of mountains includes the land of Kusu or Kush (Victoria Institute, 17:242). The eldest son of Ham was named Cush, and in Psalm 7 another man has this name. There is no need, then, to relate the Pre-Flood region of Cush with the Cush after the Flood. The river Gihon which circled the land of Cush does not refer to any present geographical location.
HIDDEKEL, Gen. 2:14. This name offers an illuminating lesson in ancient spelling among the ancient Middle East nations. The prefix Hid-, often dropped, means activity, rapidity, vehemence. Hence the word means the rapid Tigris. The consonants D-K-L in Hiddekel are the same as the T-G-R of Tigris. Among the various nations this river was the Digla, Diglat, Teger, Tegera, Dekel, Diglath, Diglit. The name now in use among the inhabitants of Mesopotamia is Dijleh. It is easy to see that all these variants come from the same root consonants.
Since the root of the word, Dekel, by itself also means velocity, the prefix with the same meaning adds emphasis in the same way as we would use "very." Hiddekel means to be sharp, hence to flow swiftly, arrow. The name was applied to the stream which fit the description before the Flood. After the Flood the name was applied to the stream we know today, but there is no geographical relationship between the two. In Genesis this stream is described as flowing eastward to Assyria.
ASSYRIA, Gen. 2:14. It is tempting to identify the Tigris flowing eastward to Assyria as the same place names we now know in Mesopotamia. Most commentators do just that. This conclusion, however, simply does not follow. Long after the Flood event we find that Asshur, the second son of Shem, is the source of the name of both the land and the people of Assyria. If this is not sufficient, one can hardly argue that the river Tigris flows eastward to Assyria. The general flow of the river is from north to south. The root meaning of the word is obscure, but it may be associated with the boxwood, and hence refers to a region noted for a certain kind of vegetation associated with a stream. Analogies would be Pine River or Willow Creek today.
EUPHRATES, Gen. 2:14. In Post-Flood times, the Euyphrates was generally known as "the river," "the river of Asia," or "the great river," in sharp contrast to the many short-lived and less important streams known to the ancients. Euphrates is the Greek form of the Hebrew Phrath or Perath. We note again the durability of the basic consonant structure. The PH-R-T in Euphrates is also P-R-T or P-R-TH, also F-R-T as in Ufrutu or Frat. Among the meanings ascribed to the root are sweet waters, long river, fruitful, good to cross over, dispersion, flower, or the good and abounding river. By implication, it was the mightiest of the four. It follows reasonably that the largest, longest, and most important river in Western Asia after the Flood would be named Euphrates. No geographical connection with "the river" before the Flood need be inferred.
Gordon suggests that the word "para," meaning "river," as in the word Euphrates, was carried around the world in very ancient times. He notes, for example, the large number of "para" words in South America associated with rivers: Para, Paraiba, Parana, Paranaiba, Paranapanema, Paragua, Paraguai, and others. Additional "para" words are used in the same way in India, USSR, and other countries (Gordon, 1971, p. 129-131, 203).
NOD, Gen. 4:16. If we could do the impossible and locate Eden, the land of Nod lies to the east of it. The word Nod appears only once in the Old Testament, and there is no reason to consider it a proper noun. It simply means a land of flight, wandering, and banishment, a land of exile, in contrast to Eden, the garden of delight.
ENOCH, Gen. 4:17. Enoch means initiation or consecration, and we can assume that Cain considered the birth of his son as a pledge of the renovation of his life. The city of Enoch, named after his son, is under consideration here as the first city in the world, and the name Enoch, as we shall see, became the word in Post-Flood times to designate a city.
We can assume that other cities were built as time went on. It is interesting to note that in the Sumerian library of 60,000 tablets found at Nippur in the Mesopotamian valley, the oldest Flood account identifies five Pre-Flood cities: Eridu, Badftibira, Larak, Sitpar, and Shuruppak. Noah (Ziusudra) lived in the latter one (von Daniken, 1969, p. 62).



Spading Up Ancient Words
https://www.creationism.org/books/vonfange/vonFangeSpadingChap02.htm[2020. 11. 09. 15:25:38]
Albright illustrates the phonetic changes which took place in very ancient names like Uruk (the biblical Erech). Without detailing such changes, we observe various transformations of the same word: Unu(g), uru became the ordinary word for city; Ur is URI; UNU(G)ki or URU; UNUki (Albright, 1966, p. 30).
Custance takes this matter a very interesting step farther. The idea of "city" is non-Indo-European. Neither they nor the Semites had a word for city, so the word was borrowed, e.g., as in the word borough. The older form is burg derived from Berg as reflected in the Greek Purgos. The root Perg can be traced to the more ancient form of Uruk, and its alternative form Unuk. Curiously this is the only ancient city name which does not have a determinitive sign preceding the name, that is, a sign to indicate that a city is meant and not some other meaning of the same word. Everybody knew the name of the first city which was carried into Post-Flood times, i.e., Enoch. It is not a little startling then to realize that the city of Pittsburgh commemorates not only William Pitt, but also Enoch, the first city ever erected. Pittburgh can be thought of as Pitts-Enoch (Custance, 1960, p. 25-26).
Only 27 persons are named in the Pre-Flood world, even though reasonable estimates of the total population of the world just before the Flood run into many millions.
Not including Adam and Eve, and Abel, whose life was taken by Cain, twelve persons are identified in the line of Cain, and twelve in the line of Seth. It is interesting to observe that each line concludes before the Flood with the names of three important sons. The line of Cain ends with Jabal, Jubal, and Tubal-cain, to whom are attributed essential elements of our culture typified by tents and cattle, music, and metallurgy. The line of Seth ends with Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the ancestors of all the Post-Flood peoples of the earth. We again observe a genealogy ending with three sons in Genesis 11:26, "And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
The symmetrical form of the genealogies of Seth and Shem in Genesis 5 and 11 has caught many a curious eye. Each outlines precisely ten generations. The word "begat" may properly be used in an ancestral sense. This fact allows for the existence of undetermined but relatively modest gaps in the patriarchal genealogies. This conclusion is supported by the omission of Cainan in the Hebrew text, Genesis 5, but his inclusion in the Septuagint version, as noted in Luke 3:36. Additional evidence supporting the possibility of gaps in the chronology is the organization of the genealogy in Matthew 1 into three groups of 14 names each, but with known omissions. Many authorities agree that the purpose of the genealogies was not a strict chronology, but rather that the lists were grouped symmetrically as an aid to memory (Whitcomb, 1965, p. 475-483).
The line of Adam and Cain comprises eight generations, while that of Adam and Seth is ten generations. Shem, Ham, and Japheth, though they are named before the Flood, are not included in the ten generations. They serve as the bridge between the Pre-Flood and Post-Flood world.
How was symmetry achieved for the two Pre-Flood genealogies, when one consisted of eight generations and the other of ten? We have already noted that each list, not including Adam, consisted of twelve names. Each genealogy ends with the names of three sons, but the three sons of Noah are not included in the Pre-Flood generations. The line of Cain includes the names of the two wives of Lamech, Adah and Zillah. The twelfth name in the line of Cain is the sister, Naamah, of Tubal-cain. No women are identified in the generations from Seth to Noah.
It is a curious fact, as noted in the Cambridge Commentary (1973), that Sumerian tradition preserved two lists of "kings" who reigned before the Flood, one of them with eight names as does this family tree of Cain, and the other ten names, as does the family tree of Adam to Noah (Davidson, 1973, p. 54-55). While it is popular in scholarly circles to hold that the Sumerian myth is the original from which the Biblical account was derived many centuries later, it is even more reasonable to hold that the Sumerian account is an echo of the Biblical version. Why not?
Regarding the ten generations from Adam to Noah, it is also curious how the number ten prevails independently of the Bible concerning the first generations of men. In addition to the Bible and the Sumerian record, the Iranians wrote of the ten kings of ancient times who preserved the purity of the Laws. The Hindus spoke of ten fathers, the children of Brahma. In the sagas of the Germans and Scandinavians ten ancestors of Odin are mentioned. Among the Chinese there were ten emperors before the dawn of history. The Arabs spoke of ten fabled kings who lived between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Berossus, the Babylonian historian, who lived about 300 B.C., copied old inscriptions which told of

https://www.creationism.org/books/vonfange/vonFangeSpadingChap02.htm[2020. 11. 09. 15:25:38]
ten kings who lived before the Flood and who reigned 432,000 years (Custance, 1957. p. 29-33).
This huge number deserves some comment. The total has often been used to demonstrate the mythical nature of the story and to emphasize the fact that such accounts have no connection with true history. The original reads 120 saros. The sari was a Babylonian measure which could mean 3600 of anything.
It is a natural conclusion that in this context one thinks in terms of years, and indeed 120 x 3600 equals 432,000 years. It is seldom noted, however, that the sari also has a meaning of 18 1/2 years, which results in an entirely different conclusion. Suidas, a Greek lexicographer of the 12th century A.D. is quoted as saying that the sari among the Chaldeans is 222 lunar months, that is, 18 years and six months, and that the Chaldean year on which the sari is based consisted of twelve months of thirty days each, or 360 days. If we take the more logical figure of 18 1/2 years, we secure a total length of time for the ten kings of 2220 years. This figure compares astonishingly well with the Vatican Septuagint total of 2242 years for the ten Pre-Flood patriarchs, and places the Sumerian myth into an entirely new light (Custance, 1957, p. 29-33). Gordon observes that many preposterous myths have turned out to be correct, but most academicians cannot be tempted to jeopardize their reputations and their security as crusaders in the cause of truth (Gordon, 1971, p. 79).
A word should be said about the longevity of the ancients. The record in the Old Testament indicates a degenerative process until the present norm of 70 years was stated in the Psalms. Apart from the Bible, we find other literature which refers to the longer life span in ancient times. In the sacred Hindu books, for example, it was taught that in the first ages man lived 400 years, later 300 years, then 200 years. In the fourth and last age the life span decreased to 100 years. It is also on record that a Chinese emperor proposed an inquiry on why the ancients lived so much longer than at his time (Custance, 1957, p. 28-29).
The above discussion shows how much we can learn of ancient times by examining the names which have come down to us in the book of Genesis. More study, if this is possible, should be made of the Pre-Flood names, since great significance was often attached to the meaning of names given in the Bible.
The Ebla tablets have considerable potential in furnishing insights into the root meanings of otherwise obscure Semitic words. In addition to the names, we see that genealogies, symmetries, life spans, parallel accounts In ancient literature all combine to offer tantalizing glimpses into the world before the Flood.

(1) In languages of Mesopotamia old pictographs of familiar objects (star, head, food bowl, stream, walking) are transformed over the centuries to more abstract symbols. Our modern English alphabet also goes back to old pictographs of concrete symbols, e.g., "m" is a picture of water with tiny waves.

Velikovsky makes interesting points in support of Queen Hatshepsut's visit to the land of Punt (the Holy Land) as the same event, shown, for example, in the foreign influence on the architecture of her funerary temple, Deir El Bahari, the inscriptions there of her journey and the gifts she brought back, and in her return up the Nile which would have been impossible if Sheba were in southern Arabia or down the east coast of Africa. Yet this 'solution' has its difficulties too. The Queen of Sheba problem is a perfect illustration of the great importance of ancient chronology - an explosively controversial topic.

(8) One of eight inscriptions found near Hebron in Israel in 1966, this undeciphered text on camel skin was believed by prominent experts to be actual Philistine writing until 1983, when it was convincingly exposed as a forgery. The inscription turns out to be fancifully copied and miscopied lines from the famous Hebrew Siloam inscription. There is a powerful lesson here on the frailty of expert scholarly opinion on matters dealing with the ancient world.

Dr. Henriette Mertz, an amateur explorer of the ancient past, was the first to note that the Smithsonian Institution had published it upside down.

Chapter 3: LOOK TO THE SKY
There are probably no more durable consonants than the STR combination (also found as STL) which is found in many ancient and modern words. Astro- from the Latin or the Greek means star, and we see the word in such terms as astronomy and astrology. In almost every continent we encounter a form of the word star: in German it is Stern; in Persian, Sitar-eh; even in Tierra del Fuego, at the southern tip of South America, the word star is Seter-e. Among the Berbers of North Africa the word is Iter-i; in Latin it is Sider-a. Astr-is common in the Semitic languages. It is Ishtar, a goddess of love and spring, the Venus of Babylonia; Esther in the Old Testament; Ashtor-et in Phoenicia; Astarte in Hellas. Even the name of the Egyptian love-goddess, Hathor or Sathor, is derived from STR. This combination is found in the word Easter. The Anglo-Saxons worshipped the spring-goddess, Eostre, or Ostar-a, which is the same as Astarte or Ishtar.
If you are a considerate person, it means you are in close contact with the stars. If you take a matter under consideration, you are planning to check it out with the stars. If you desire something (desiderium), you make a wish upon the stars. If disaster strikes you, your doom came from the stars (Wadler. 1948, p. 114-118, 223). When we contemplate, we go to a special place marked out to observe the stars or some other form of augury. People become moonstruck, or they may be afflicted with lunacy by the power of the moon (Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th edition, 2:200).
Ancient astronomy offers an especially rich harvest of insights into the sophistication of man many centuries ago. It is very obvious that the Babylonians and other ancients knew a great deal more than those who followed, until very recent times.
We are reluctant to ascribe the telescope to very ancient times, yet the Babylonians and others recorded information which seems impossible to gain without the aid of that instrument. They observed the four satellites of Jupiter. They probably knew all seven of the satellites of Saturn. They described the "horns" of Venus. It is very curious that both the Babylonians and the Maya called the same constellation the Scorpion. Yet the tail of Scorpio is not visible without the aid of a telescope. There is the ancient legend that the planet Uranus eats and then disgorges his children. With modern telescopes one can see that Uranus regularly covers its moons which then become visible again. On a lesser scale we are surprised to find Dante referring to the Southern Cross constellation in the Divine Comedy. It is not visible from Italy in the northern hemisphere and can only be seen south of the equator. Both Homer and Vergil knew that Mars had two small satellites which the ancients named Phobos (terror) and Deimos (rout), the so-called steeds of Mars. These satellites were not rediscovered until 1877 by Asaph Hall, who named them as Homer did. One hundred fifty years earlier Jonathan Swift, drawing on old sources, gave astonishing details about the size, motions, speed, and distances of the two satellites (Berlitz, 1972, p. 39-43, 141; Saga, December 1971, p. 24).
From time to time in the distant past, evil came from the sky and threatened the earth. One of the many indications that the world was not always the geologically peaceful place it now is, lies in the word, Ragnarok, from ancient Scandinavian legends. The word means a rain of dust, and this phenomenon is reported in the legends of many peoples and may have implications for explaining aspects of land forms (Gardner, 1957, p. 36).
It is a curious thing that the beautiful planet, Venus, far in the past was given various names which mean Satan, for example, Ahriman, Seth, and Lucifer. One cannot fail but to suspect that Venus has not always been the well-behaved lady in the sky which she now is. The name of Lucifer is particularly puzzling. It means the light-bearer - hardly a name to be associated with Satan. To complicate the matter, we find that suddenly Venus becomes associated with the word Beelzebub, which carries the strange meaning of lord of the flies. In the Iliad of Homer, Athene, another name for Venus, is called the dog-fly. Stranger yet is the fact that both among the Bantu of Africa and among Indian tribes of Brazil, Venus is called the sand fly. If Venus once approached close to the earth, the heat could have generated vermin on the earth at a feverish rate (Velikovsky, 1950, p. 180-185). Then there is the curious myth, unique to Venus, of the

birth of this planet or this goddess. One is compelled to conclude that Venus has had a very strange past in historic times which left a searing impact on the world. In widely separated parts of the world, people were terrified of Venus to the point where they commonly made human sacrifices to appease the planet.
There is much more to say about this strange planet. At one time Athene or Venus was called Tritogeneia (Tritonia) after the enormous lake Triton which disappeared in a catastrophe in Africa when the lake broke into the ocean, leaving the desert of Sahara behind (Velikovsky, 1950, p. 169). According to Rawlinson, the Persian prophet of the sixth century B.C., Zoroaster, is associated in some way with the planet Venus. His name means the seed of Istaru, which was the Assyrian name for the planet Venus (Victoria Institute, 13:248). Who would walk outside at night to look at Mars and then describe the planet as the Crushers or the Storm-winds? Like the mysterious past of Venus in ancient history, Mars has had an equally checkered career which is described in much ancient literature. We are very reluctant to visualize a world different in the past from what we experience now. Yet the evidence is compelling that brutal events occurred in the past on the earth which involved Venus and Mars at various times. (Victoria Institute, 13:280).
Job 38:31 "Can you bind the sweet influences of Pleiades...?" The Pleiades is a cluster of stars in the constellation Taurus. The ancients counted seven visible stars, and they called them the Seven Sisters. Today we count six. These modest little specks in the sky are hardly noticed today. In ancient times they were of great importance, which is a story in itself. The word comes from the Greek meaning, "I navigate." The Greeks began the navigation season in May when the Pleiades rose, and finished when they set (Kolosimo, 1971, p. 54).
It is apparent from the study of astronomical terms, concepts, and root meanings of terms and names that the ancients were very sophisticated in the field of astronomy. It is also evident that some very strange catastrophic events occurred in the past which had a profound effect on the earth, on man, and on his memories of those events.

Chapter 4: CLUES FOR GODS, SITES, AND PEOPLES
Baal. The worship of fire is associated with both Baal and Moloch in ancient times. There is the familiar story of Elijah and the prophets of Baal in I Kings 18. An idea of the extent of Baal worship is found in Ireland. Abundant traces are preserved to this day in place names and in dedications of ancient temples to Baal. The tradition remains at Glendalough, County Wicklow, Ireland, that in ancient times the heathen priest used to ascend the fine round stone tower, now restored, and at sunrise called aloud the name of Baal four times, once from each of the four openings at the summit of the tower which face the cardinal points of the compass. Baal worship is believed to have continued until the time of St. Patrick. There are many remnants of old fire worship and sacrifice of children to Moloch in Scotland. Only a century ago on an estate in Scotland it was the practice of peasants on May Day to gather round a fire and throw their children across from one to another through the fire. Other similar descriptions come from Devonshire and in Ireland at fires called Beltina, or Baal fires. Beltane is the name of the first of May in Scotland which even now commemorates the ancient name of Bel (Victoria Institute, 44:125; 6:267; 27:185-186).
In many parts of the world, children dance and play around the Maypole on May Day. This lovely old custom which presents a joyous sight to all who see it unfortunately goes back to a less attractive origin. From ancient times this was part of Baal worship. The word Belus or Baal is the same in Babylonian, Phoenician, Celtic, and other languages. The Celts brought Baal worship into northern Europe, and our old May Day was called Beltina in the British Isles and Ireland (Victoria Institute, 14:131).
Such place names as Ball Hill, Val Hill, and Baalbeg are examples of Baal place names in England. Baalbeg is a deserted village above Loch Ness in Scotland (Michell, 1969, p. 40).
The Phoenicians are also thought to have carried Baal worship to the western and northern coasts of Europe. Baal gave his name to the Baltic Sea, and to the Great Belt and Little Belt channels of Denmark, to towns such as Baleshaugen, Balestranden, and to many localities in the British Isles, such as Belan, and the Baal hills in Yorkshire (Donnelly, 1949, p. 67).
The word Peor appears abruptly in two connections in the books of Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Psalms, and Hosea. It is the name of the mountain from which Baalam last blessed Israel. Although the specific peak is not known today, its location was north of the Dead Sea and opposite the city of Jericho. The word also suddenly became attached to the word Baal, which means lord, and thus we have the word Baalpeor. Few today realize the 'peor' has become a common word in English. It seems passing strange that the word 'peor' is not a Semitic word at all, but it is the Hittite word for fire and underlies the Greek 'pyr,' which is found in many English words meaning 'fire,' and it is the word from which the English word 'fire' is derived (Mendenhall, 1979, p. 109). We thus have a peak called the Mountain of Fire, and the sudden deification of fire in the word Baalpeor, the God of Fire. It seems reasonable to conclude that some terrifying, fiery event some time previously impelled the tribes and nations of the eastern Mediterranean to worship a god of fire in the hope of avoiding another such event. Whether the event was the pillar of fire after the Exodus, or some other event, we do not know, but when we say the word 'fire' today, we are saying quite a historical mouthful.
Basques, Cari, and Scyths. The Basques, those people of unknown origin, now are concentrated in the western Pyrenees in France and Spain. At one time they left a much wider impact on Europe. Basque is a form of the Latin Vasco, and we can see at once that the famous explorer, Vasco da Gama, was a Basque. The French province north of the Pyrenees on the Atlantic shore is called Gascogne or Guascogne, and is of course named after the Basques. We can also see the name in the Biscayan or Viscayan Gulf on the Atlantic side of France and Spain. We can trace the Basques to the east. The mountain chain which separates France and Germany is called the Vosges, the Mountains of the Basques. In the oldest German records, Walther's Song, this barrier is called the Wasgen Wald, or the Forest of the Basques (Wadler, 1948, p.48-42).

The mysterious Basques of the Spanish and French mountain regions have defied all efforts to relate them to other peoples or languages. Some years ago, however, an Indian scholar, Lahovary, completed a study which showed interesting and detailed relationships between the Dravidian and the Basque languages. These two widely separated people still today have in common such words as those related to sheep, oxen, pigs, asses; spun and woven wool; ducks and doves; houses of wood, stone, or brick; boats of wood; fruit trees, plowing, cattle raising, and vine growing. The Tamil language (Dravidian) is still spoken by millions in India. The oldest form of the word Tamil was Dramila, Dramiza (Dravida). Lahovary also notes that the Lycians of Asia Minor called themselves Trmmili, and the preHellenic Asiatic people of Crete were called Termilai, further possible links to Dravidians ad Basques. Perhaps the trail of these peoples will one day be further clarified (Lahovary, 1963, p. 33-35).
The Carians were a mysterious eastern Mediterranean people often associated with the Philistines and with the Phoenicians. The tradition of the Carians was that they, the Lydians, and the Mysians were brother-peoples, descended from three brothers: Car, Lydus, and Mysos. Their reputation as warriors is noted by the fact that King David had both Philistine and Carian bodyguards, the Pleti (a shortened form of Philistine) and the Kari (II Sam. 8:18). At a later time Queen Athaliah, II Kings 11, also had a bodyguard of Cari. The greater fame of the Carians was their reputation as mariners and pirates. The Carians are often mentioned in classical literature. In Egypt, the Mediterranean Sea was known as the Sea of Khar(u). Carians lived in Crete under the name of Leleges and were famous warriors under King Minos of Crete. The Carians had settlements in many parts of the world and left traces in many geographical names containing the syllable "Car," "Cart," or "Keret." The Greek writer, Thucydides noted that the Carians lived on many Aegean islands and joined with the Phoenicians in the great game of piracy. Studies have been made of "Car-" sites all over the world, e.g., Karkar, Carchemish, Car Shalmaneser, and Carthage. After Nebuchadnezzar took Tyre, a remnant of Phoenicians and Carians fled to the west and settled in an earlier colony, Carthage. Homer speaks of barbarously speaking Carians, that is, they did not speak Greek. The script of the Carians may be the same as the still unread Cyprian language or the picture script of Crete, but of course this is only speculation. If some day these scripts are read, we may learn a great deal of ancient times in the eastern Mediterranean (Velikovsky, 1952, p. 198-205; Victoria Institute, 39:90-91).
Beth-Shan was an important old city located at the strategic junction of the Valley of Jezreel with the Jordan Valley. The name is preserved in the modern village of Beisan. The site was settled as early as the fourth millennium B.C. Beth-Shan may mean the Temple of the Serpent God. There have been many finds there of serpent representations. Serpent worship in ancient times was a world-wide phenomenon, and there must be some kind of cultural link in this practice. Beth-Shan at various times was the home of the Canaanites, Egyptians, Hittites, Babylonians, Philistines, Israelites, Scythians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders, and now Israelis. In the Septuagint, Beth-Shan is translated as Scythopolis, or the City of the Scyths. This unexpected name refers back to a Russian (IndoEuropean) Invasion of Palestine in the seventh century B.C. about which we know little. At this time the warlike Scythians swept down from the plains of south Russia as far as the boundaries of Egypt. This occurred after the fall of Samaria in 722 B.C., the end of the Kingdom of Israel, and the disappearance of the ten tribes of Israel (Glueck, 1968, p. 173-174).
Finding Sites. The priceless Tell el-Amarna Letters found in Egypt tie into some Old Testament history. Among other things, the letters spoke of the important city-states with Important harbors which lay from Mount Carmel northward along the Phoenician coastline. Among them were Acco, Tyre, Sidon, Berytus, Byblos, Simyra, Arvad, and Ugarit. Archaeologists soon Identified all but the last, Ugarit. In 1928 Ugarit was found by accident, and a priceless treasure of Canaanite literature was uncovered. The fact that over a gap in time of an least three thousand years an old place name can be definitely located demonstrates how persistently the root consonant structure of ancient words live on in modern words. Acco, now called Acre, was an Important stepping-stone to the rich Plain of Esdraelon and to southern Galilee. The ancient city of Berytus is easily seen in the present name of Beirut, and Arvad is now known as Ru-Ad (Cleator, 1959, p. 134).
Tarshish. This, is a troublesome place name usually placed on maps as Tarshish(?). Was there one Tarshish or many? As Albright pointed out, the word meant "smelter" in Phoenician before it became a place name. The obsession of the ancients with metal is a strong hint that many places were known as the "Place of the Smelter." The Tarshish of Solomon's day may not be the same location as the Tarshish of Jonah or of St. Paul some centuries later. While Spain may be one likely location, there are other places known by that name many centuries ago (Glueck, 1968, p. 120).

A Cultural Pattern. Our Indo-European languages betray our cattle-raising past in prehistoric times. Cattle were often the sole form of wealth in early societies, and this concept of wealth still survives in parts of the world today. We seldom realize how strikingly various words for cattle are preserved in our languages. The word fee, which now means reward or payment, and closely related words such as feud, fief, feudal, plus our modern terms such as fee-simple, and limited fee, are derived from Scottish, Old Saxon, German, Swedish, and Danish words, all of which mean cattle. From the Latin we have received the word pecuniary, which refers to money. This word is derived from the Latin pecus, which again means cattle. We use the legal term, chattel, which refers to the goods one owns. Again this word is plainly derived from cattle. Another common term for money is capital, which originally referred to the chief part of one's property, which is to say, one's cattle. From the same root we have such English words as cadet, cap, cape, capital, capitol, capitulate, caprice, captain, cattle, chapter, chef, cope, achieve, biceps, decapitate, kerchief, mischief, precipitate, recapitulate, and triceps - all related in some way back to the word cattle (Victoria Institute, 24:156).
Old Testament Synchronisms. It seems strange to find a very ancient Hebrew place name in Egypt, the Yusuf Canal. The author still remembers the excitement of coming unexpectedly to the Yusuf Canal and then noting an ominous sign that photography was forbidden there. Yusuf is the word Joseph. There is no attempt in conventional writing to link the canal with Joseph since the canal supposedly predates him by a number of centuries. Since, however, Egyptian chronology is far from firmly established, there is some likelihood that this famous canal in full operation today was constructed at the time of Joseph after he was made a viceroy (Victoria Institute, 59:90).
Shishak is mentioned twice in the Old Testament: I Kings 11:40 "And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon," and II Chronicles 12:9 "So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made." The name Shishak is a perfect Illustration of the chaotic condition of ancient chronology. The fabulous find of the Ras Shamra tablets at Ugarit north of Israel is generally dated as 15th century B.C. Shishak lived in the 10th century B.C., 500 years later. Yet one of the first Egyptian names translated from the Ras Shamra tablets was that of Sosaq or Sisaq, which is Shishak, but the translator did not dare draw the correct conclusion, for what was this 10th century Pharaoh doing in the middle of the second millennium B.C. (Velikovsky, 1952, p. 219)?
Punt is another mysterious geographical location, and scholars have come up with various conjectures about its location. Inscriptions in Egypt sometimes say Punt is to the east, and sometimes to the south. This land became famous in ancient literature when the Queen of Egypt, Hatshepsut, took the unprecedented step of voyaging overseas to pay homage to a foreign ruler. Problems of Egyptian chronology have complicated the search. The word Punt means "Holy Land." Already in the Old and Middle Kingdoms of Egypt, the land of Israel was called the Divine Land or God's Land in Egyptian Inscriptions. There is evidence that Queen Hatshepsut was a contemporary of King Solomon, and that her visit to Punt, which is elaborately recorded in Egyptian inscriptions, was the same historical event described in the Old Testament as the visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon. The opinion is given in the Talmud that Sheba was a personal name rather than a geographic one, and Josephus said that Sheba was the ruler of Egypt and Ethiopia, just as Ethiopian tradition has it. The Punt inscriptions in Egypt show the gifts which Solomon gave her. Before the queen went to Punt there was a preliminary mission which was met by a Chief of Punt named Perehu or Paruah. Compare I Kings 4:17 "Jehoshaphat, the son of Paruah." The meeting place was in Aloth or Eloth. Compare Solomon's city of Eloth (next to Ezlongeber) at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba, on the east side of the Sinai peninsula. One of the inscriptions reads: "Sailing in the sea, beginning the goodly way toward God's Land, journeying in peace to the land of Punt." "I have reached the myrrh terraces. It is the glorious region of God's Land." Compare II Chronicles 9:11 "And the King made of algum trees terraces to the house of the Lord and the palace." On a Punt relief kneeling men were called chiefs of Irem (Hiram). On the return trip the ships arrived at Thebes, so they must have come from the Mediterranean, two fleets and two routes to Palestine, one to the south and one to the east. From other Punt reliefs we see that trees were taken up in God's Land and set in the ground in Egypt. Not only were the gardens of Solomon imitated, but the plan of the Temple and the temple service were followed as models. The temple at Deir el Bahari shows foreign elements, and the queen said that she had built a Punt here. I Kings 10:24 "And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart" (Victoria Institute, 57:191; Velikovsky, 1952, p. 107135).

Chapter 5: LOOKING FAR BACK
There is abundant evidence that before widespread travel across the seas was undertaken by the Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Egyptians, and Romans, certain key names and words had already been taken by land and water throughout the world, perhaps even to lands now buried under miles of ice, as, for example, the Antarctic continent.
Although these names and words have undergone change over the centuries, they can still be found in their changed forms when competent scholars study the native place names of rivers and mountains, of volcanoes, waterfalls, lakes, islands, regions, towns and cities.
Moreover, these same names and words are found in personal and tribal names, in mythological and deified names, and in the names for animals, birds, fish, flowers, trees, foods, and parts of the body. Only half-concealed in the spoken and written languages of widely separated peoples in the world are intriguing clues to man's ancient past. These key words, blended into many combinations in many languages can be identified in two distinct groups. Words of the first group are found in all parts of the world. Key words of the second group are found in the Mediterranean area, Europe, Africa, parts of the east coast of North America, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand. Thus two old dispersions of people have been identified and recorded. Further it is startling that legends about the Garden of Eden, the expulsion of Adam and Eve, the temptation by the serpent, the sharing of forbidden fruit, the confusion of tongues at the Tower of Babel, and the story of the great Flood were found in Middle America by the Spanish before priests began their work with the Indians. Clearly such claims by students of language must be examined (Cohane, 1969, p. 13-24).
If we live in the kind of young world described in Genesis, if the world was destroyed in a universal Flood, if Noah's three sons and their wives began to repopulate the entire world, if the confusion of tongues really happened as described, if the Table of Nations is a true genealogy of nations and an accurate description of language families, there ought to be some hints of these great events half-buried in the languages which have come down to us. It is not necessary that there be such evidences, but just as ancient artifacts have been preserved over millennia down to the present, we need not be surprised to find equally ancient and impressive linguistic "artifacts" if we look closely at language.
What might we look for? The root meaning of some modern words could well go back to interesting facets of the daily life of our remote ancestors. If in very ancient times man was the kind of world traveler and navigator described above, there ought to be some linguistic relics lying around to support such a view of the past. If we live on a young earth, there ought to be some evidences in languages of intractions among peoples before the great separation occurred at Babel. If earliest man was as sophisticated as modern man, there is no reason to accept the notion that the alphabet was a relatively recent discovery made many thousands of years after cruder forms of speech had been developed, e.g., a syllabic system. If the old appearance of the earth is due to the consequence of a number of catastrophic events, some such memories ought to be concealed in some words which have come down to us. In much of the above, place names ought to be of particular value in shedding light on many aspects of the ancient past. All in all, language has unusual potential in relating back to our remote past. In this work we make something of a pioneering survey of words, the alphabet, and our number system which clearly was derived from the alphabet.
We know that even the most casual examination of our language and of place names - cities, lakes, rivers, mountains shows many traces of the natives, the conquerors, and the immigrants for hundreds of years in the past. Scholars have noted that we can follow the path of Alexander the Great as he conquered the known world of his day by observing the place names that still exist all the way from Macedonia to India. These place names capture moments of history 2300 years ago. We are beginning to realize that place names go back farther still.
In the attempt to search into languages for clues to the ancient past, the searcher must be aware of some of the



Spading Up Ancient Words
https://www.creationism.org/books/vonfange/vonFangeSpadingChap05.htm[2020. 11. 09. 15:25:45]
characteristics of language. Important information could well be overlooked otherwise.
It is essential that anyone who works with various Indo-European languages must be acquainted with Grimm's Law, which shows the orderly changes which many words have undergone from time to time and from language to language. Knowledge of Grimm's Law helps one to see and understand why father, pater, and Vater are three forms of the same word, as are brother, frater, and Bruder. We also see precisely why the following word pairs are identical - the one being derived lawfully from the other: pes and foot, tres and three, duo and two, granum(grain) and corn, and cornu and horn. Awareness of the above helps the reader understand relevant examples given by linguists. The Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) who discovered the law is the same person who worked with his brother to collect the famous Grimm's Fairy Tales (Blumberg, 1969, p. 66-67).
Further, the modern form of a word or a place name is generally established on the basis of consonant structure, rather than on vowels, prefixes, suffixes,aspirates, etc. There are many examples in the Middle East of the interchangeability or confusion of L and R, just as we find today in the Orient. Consonants are astonishingly durable over the centuries within words. Amateurs are not qualified to establish relationships between words, since words that appear to be closely related may have nothing at all in common, e.g., the words cornu and corn above. Yet very dissimilar appearing words may be derived one from the other. When one studies examples, the concept of consonant structure becomes clearer: The word Philistine is precisely the same as the word Palestine, Copt is another way of spelling Egypt, Massilia is Marseille, Neapolis is Naples, Firenze is Florence, Gades is Cadiz, Megiddo is Armageddon, Iskanda is Alexander, Heracles in Hercules, Aryan is Iran. Ecuador is the word equator. We can understand that Venezuela means "Little Venice", when we know that the discoverer found a village erected on piles on the shore of the Gulf of Maracaibo in 1499 which reminded him of Venice (Wadler, 1948, p. 109-111).
But there is another side of the coin. We look in vain for any relationship between the words Germany, Deutschland, and Allemande. Yet all three are exactly the same in geographical meaning. The word we use in this case depends on where we live. This fact poses many problems for the study of some ancient place names.
Having discussed some possibilities one might look for in using languages to search out the past, and being aware of several basic characteristics of language, we may now proceed to look for examples of how useful language can be to gain insights into the distant past.

Chapter 6: CLUES IN ANCIENT WRITING
Place names can give valuable clues for locating ancient sites. By taking seriously a place name given to him by Arab companions, Nelson Glueck rediscovered an important copper mining site in the Negev from the time of King Solomon, 3000 years ago. The Arabs kept referring to the place called Khirbet Nahas, which means "Copper Ruin."
Nelson Glueck observed that the most ancient geographical names are faithfully reflected in modern designations. As examples he cites the following from the Jordan Valley: Eriha is the word Jericho; Beisan is old Beth-shan; Damieh is biblical Ad amah; and Tell Abil is Abel-beth-maachah. When the explorer or the archaeologist is searching for an ancient site it is crucial for him to pay attention to the modern place names in the area he is searching (Horizon, 2:2, November 1959, p. 10; Glueck, 1968, p. 16-17).
Another value of word study is shown by the following. Based on lexical analysis, Semites must have lived together in an original land of rivers and no mountains. There is evidence that the land was in the Arabian Desert before it became desert. Rawlinson observed that linguistic evidence showed the early existence in Arabia of at least two races: one in the north and central of Semitic peoples, and the other in the south, which was non-Semitic. The latter possessed a language resembling the dialects of aborigines in Ethiopia (Custance, 1964, p. 31; McClure, 1971, p. 31).
Support for this analysis was reported by McClure. An extraordinary discovery was made in the Arabian desert - ancient rock carvings of tall black cattle people just like the Watusi-Masai of today in Africa. He suggests the possibility that the people of East Africa may very well be living descendants of the ancient ones who lived in Arabia when it was a fertile, well-watered land (McClure, 1971, p. 80).
From the above reference to rivers we can infer another point to be emphasized later, that we have clues to a golden time before a catastrophic event created the desert we now know in that region.
We can learn something about the sophistication of a culture and other insights of their life from the texts which have been preserved. Cyrus Gordon analyzed many ancient texts and believed he had identified ancient cryptograms of great interest. These are messages within messages (Science Digest, April 1972, p. 60).
An old Mesopotamian language, Akkadian, was no longer in use after 1500 B.C. The fact that they had a word for iron, as well as words for tin, copper, lead, gold, silver, and bronze, says a great deal about the culture of these people at that time in history. It is especially Interesting to note their familiarity with Iron centuries before the Iron Age began, although it is possible they knew only meteoric Iron at that time (Victoria Institute, 23:303). We must grant the possibility, however, that "meteoric Iron" is simply a convenient explanation. We know almost nothing of the earliest development of the use of Iron.
Baring-Gould mentions the tradition in England that some of the counting-out rhymes, such as are found in nursery rhymes, may be relics of formulas used by the Druids in choosing human sacrifices (Baring-Gould, 1962, p. 12). It is entirely possible that similar rhymes served as mnemonic or memory devices for ancient mariners in plotting their voyages by the movements of constellations, each of which had an easily remembered common name.
Just as the Arab has a great many words for camel which show almost every imaginable state and condition, and the Eskimo does the same with words for snow, so the Egyptians used at least 37 terms for our word heaven and more than 370 specific astronomical terms. There is no way we can translate many of these terms accurately. This is a good example of how differently ancient man viewed the universe around him. There can be little doubt that the Egyptians and other ancients could read valuable information out of the stars, particularly with respect to navigation and other travel (de Santillana, 1969, p. 73).

Albright speaks too of the values of word and language studies for the historian in tracing interacting continuities, and in providing useful and sometimes unique evidence of otherwise indiscernible ethnic and cultural relationships far back in time. Further, he notes that the analysis of personal names is a powerful tool for tracing various ethnic elements in an old population. This study, for example, showed the surprising presence of Indo-Europeans in Syria and Palestine during the Late Bronze Age. The continued presence of Indo-Europeans is clearly noted in the Amarna Letters (thought of as from the 14th century B. C.). Often we are dependent on personal and place names as our only source for an entire language. Albright makes the very interesting observation that although Egypt was not within the Semitic language family, there are few grammatical features which could be considered alien to Semitic languages, which may suggest a close relationship or other early interaction between the two (Albright, 1966, p. 3-14).
There are curious links between ancient languages. Albright comments on the fact that Sumerian, the oldest known literary language of man, showed a remarkable breakdown in the phonetic structure of individual words and compounds which are quite comparable to that which now exists in Chinese. There were so many syllables that had the same sound that Albright concludes they had to distinguish them by tones in the Chinese manner. While there is no direct evidence, he can draw no other conclusion. Similarly Sayce states that Sumerian is related to the language of China, and the first Chinese emigrants and the pre-Semitics of Chaldea were related linguistically and racially (Albright, 1966, p. 26-27; Custance, 1961, p. 9).
Albright speaks with amazement about the mobility of ancient languages (as though world-wide travel were a common thing) and he speaks confidently that scholars will soon locate Old World sources of elements of the oldest American cultures (Albright, 1966, p. 3-12). The historical links between different areas in the ancient world and a further suggestion of widespread land and sea travel are illustrated by the strange duality of place names. Musri, north of Assyria is the same as Musur or Misir, which is Egypt. Cush was an area in Cappadocia and later Cush became the name for Ethiopia. The place names of Makan and Meluhha in Babylonia were the same as names of districts far to the southwest, probably in the Sinai region. Akkad was the name for both Armenia and for the northern part of Babylonia (Victoria Institute, 25:91).
Ur of the Chaldees has been located in Sumer by a general consensus of scholars for many generations. From early studies of Ebla tablets it is beginning to dawn on scholars that Abraham probably came from another Ur many hundreds of miles to the northwest of Sumer. The point of interest is that man apparently traveled very widely. When he did so, he left clues behind in the form of place names and loan words to other languages.
We can infer at least some hint of catastrophic events in the past from clues left in the language. In actions we do not really understand, ancient writers give every appearance of describing a suddenly changed world. In a highly sophisticated age. Aristotle still referred respectfully to the grave testimony of the ancient writers. It is more than a bit significant that in the very earliest writing, the writers behave like worried and doubting commentators. They tried to explain a dimly understood tradition and half forgotten words once of great significance.
Neither in ancient Egypt nor in old Sumer could the ancients explain the origin of the star lists, the constellations, or even the names of their greatest gods. Every appearance Is given of a world which had undergone significant, even radical change. (de Santillana, 1969, p. 119-120). Similarly in Homer the art of writing is associated with peril, and among many peoples writing was too sacred a thing to fall into the wrong hands, so sacred books were handed down orally from generation to generation even though writing for other common purposes was used (Whatmough, 1956, p. 14-15).
One final example will be given to show how clues to the ancient past might be derived from ancient writing. Already more than a century ago it was observed that much of mythology - a form of coded history in the minds of many scholars - relates scriptural happenings. Thus Jove may be but a corruption of the name Jehovah (Victoria Institute, 6:261).

Chapter 7: THE ALPHABET AS AN ARTIFACT
It seems fair to say that most people look at the alphabet and see nothing in particular -certainly nothing exciting. It has always been there. Scholarly accounts of the history of the alphabet reflect dull and incurious eyes. Still, most would agree that the alphabet is the greatest of all inventions, and there ought to be excitement and adventure about it. With only several exceptions, we cannot ask the same questions about the alphabet as we did earlier about ancient writing in general. However, we can expect to learn something about widespread early travel and unexpected interaction between distant nations as we follow the quick spread of early forms of the alphabet. We also may learn something of early sophistication if we discover that the alphabet is older than generally thought, and we may even find relics in the alphabet hinting at catastrophes in the past. This seems to be expecting a great deal from a simple row of letters.
If we are to shed light on prehistory, or more properly, ancient history, the following questions will be important ones to pursue. The time of the origin of the alphabet is a vital question. Does the conventional account of the Phoenicians and the alphabet pretty much sum up the whole story? Does the development support an evolutionary view, or can we find evidence for early and unexpected sophistication in matters related to a writing system? If there is some great organizing principle for the manner in which the alphabet was drawn up, a number of peculiarities might be explained. Can we find any such organizing principles? It is crucial to attempt to learn where the symbols themselves came from. Are they familiar objects found in the ancient community? Are the symbols abstractions drawn from nature, or is there some other source? The order of the letters seems rather odd. Can we find any compelling reason for the manner in which they were arranged in ancient times? The fact that people are notably resistant to change has long been observed. Reforms of the alphabet seem to be unusually resistant to change despite the fact that such proposed reforms are often clearly superior and beneficial. If there something involved in the failures to accept reform which goes beyond typical resistance to change? There seem to be some indications that the alphabet was a more useful tool in the distant past than it now is. Is it possible to gain insights into the ancient world from this factor? The name of the inventor of the alphabet is given in some myths. Is it possible to identify the actual inventor, and if so, what light does this shed on ancient history for us?
When we look closely at the alphabet as an artifact, that is, as something shaped by human workmanship of historical interest, we can expect to find some clues to the nature of the ancient world which can help us fashion a more satisfactory framework for history.
Since there have been many, many modes of communication in the past, the question naturally arises as to whether these modes of expression can be placed into some kind of time sequence to show development from primitive and simple to modern and complex. Man has communicated by means of a thong with knots and its highly developed form, the quipus, the notched message stick, painted pebbles, beadwork or wampum, rock paintings and carvings, engraved and scratched bone and ivory, pictorial symbols, cuneiform writing on clay tablets, hieroglyphics painted or carved or pressed on various surfaces, drums, and smoke signals (Encyclopedia Britannica, llth ed., 28:852).
The use of the quipus was far more widespread than one might think, and its peculiar pattern of use around the world is an example of how one might infer something about ancient travel. The quipus consisted of a main cord to which at given distances thinner cords of different colors were fastened. Each cord was knotted in various ways for special purposes, each color having Its own significance. The Chinese have a tradition that the old fathers first used knotted cords to maintain the memory of events. Later they invented written characters which were then substituted for the knotted cords. The quipus was used along the west coast of Africa and in Egypt, in Australia, in China, and in the whole Pacific region from Melanesia to Formosa. It was also used in Scotland and in Germany, but its best known use was among the Incas in Peru. As a memory device it has never had an equal (Victoria Institute, 25:70; Wadler, 1948, p. 53-54). To assume that the quipus was a primitive step preceding the invention of writing is only conjecture. There is nothing primitive about the quipus, and its use was deliberate to keep sacred wisdom and privileged Information away

from the wrong eyes and ears.
More than 2000 years ago the Greeks and Romans considered five different possible inventors of the alphabet Phoenicians, Egyptians, Assyrians, Cretans, and Hebrews. Two millennia of further consideration have clouded the matter further. Every country in the eastern Mediterranean region has been nominated, Including Egypt, the cuneiformwriting countries of Sumer, Babylonia, and Assyria, Crete, the Hittites, Cyprus, and others. Others believe the Philistines brought the alphabet from Crete to Palestine, or that the alphabet was developed at Ugarit in Syria. The astonishing finds at Ebla in Syria since 1974 may influence further theoretical work on the origin of the alphabet. Most scholars simply assume an evolutionary model developing from prehistoric geometric symbols used throughout the ancient world (Encyclopedia Britannica, 15th ed., Macrop., 1:618).
For generations we have been lulled with the story that writing began with pictographs in Mesopotamia and Egypt. Much later the Phoenicians somehow came up with an alphabet which was very widely spread and copied. Yet contrary to popular and scholarly views and assumptions, there is good evidence that most of the alphabetic signs are older than hieroglyphs. The alphabet was not derived from hieroglyphs or pictograms (Moran, 1969, p. 4-11).
There are false trails in the study of origins. After enormous amounts of futile discussion, linguists conclude that their studies have yielded little or no evidence about the origin of human speech. Assumptions have not been supported. Long ago acrimony reached the point where La Societe de Linguistique de Paris made a standing rule that no papers on the subject may be presented at its sessions. Another vain effort has been the study of the speech of primitive peoples in order to shed light on the origin of speech. As far as we know there is no sign that any language spoken today has had a shorter history or a slower development than any other. Another lead has been the study of the speech of young children, but this too has yielded no significant results on origins. Hope springs eternal in the linguist's breast, however, and the focus now is on patterns of communication in the animal world in comparison with that of man (Sturtevant, 1947, p. 40).
It is certainly relevant to this discussion to note that no society is known at any point in history which did not have a fully developed language (Encyclopedia Britannica, 15th ed., Macrop., 19:1033). Neither in language nor in the alphabet are there any reasons to believe in any sequence of simple to complex as required by an evolutionary model. Certainly there has been much change, but not in a simple to complex sequence, and this is a very significant observation.
When we go back farther in time, we find the unexpected. In various cave sites in France and Spain, conventionally dated about 8,000-10,000 years ago, letters, writing, and symbols preliminary to a form of written script have been found.
M. Ed. Piette found at Mas d'Azil about 1896 a large number of pebbles in a stratum between the last Reindeer Age and the first Neolithic period, in the so-called Magdalenian Age. The layer was more than two feet thick of red and black color and with the pebbles were cinders, perforated deer teeth, harpoons, wheat, nuts and fruit seeds. The marks on the painted pebbles are not accidental. A great number closely resemble symbols of the alphabet. Nine agree with inscriptions found in Cyprus. Eleven correspond closely with Phoenician letters (Encyclopedia Britannica, llth ed., 28:853).
At Glozel another mystery was found. Among axes and pottery was found an incised tablet with signs and letters similar to Phoenician of Greek signs. Again the table was dated long before such writing is thought to have been developed (Berlitz, 1972, p. 170-171).
The mystery of writing deepens with a report from the Prehistoric Laboratory of Bordeaux University in 1972. An engraved beef bone found a Pech Laze, France, one of the earliest samples of written communication, was hailed as one of the greatest scientific discoveries of our time. The bone was dated as 135,000 years old (Ann Arbor News, 12/5/1972, p. 1). There is ample reason not to take such conjectural dating seriously, but the find nevertheless raises puzzling questions about the origin of writing.
Another complicating factor is the recent discovery in Bulgaria of baked clay disks or seals on which incisions are present. Scientists are agreed that the seals, dated no later than 4000 B. C., contain ideograms or pictographs. This is

many centuries earlier than the oldest writing found in Sumer or Egypt. The situation is so chaotic that articles begin with the familiar refrain: "Until recently it was supposed that..." One can well understand that scholars are reluctant to have this aspect of civilization begin in Bulgaria and spread from there to Egypt and Mesopotamia (Victoria Institute, 99:2, p. 99).
All in all, it seems fair to say that some important ingredients seem to be missing in the current attempts to explain the origin of modern writing.

Chapter 8: THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE ALPHABET
The study of the alphabet shows us something of man's great sophistication in very early times, widespread travel, and interaction with distant lands and peoples.
After much study, Gordon concluded that at least some early alphabets served three functions simultaneously: arithmetic, calendric, and phonetic. Thus, depending on the context, the letter "a" stood for the number value of "1," the first day of a month, or the phonetic sound we associate with it. Only the last function is fully utilized in our culture today, although we do make minor use of the alphabet in placing things in order from A to Z. This three-way use of each letter in ancient times provided an infinite store of possibilities for memory devices to remember and transmit the culture orally. Such memory devices were used in navigation, world-wide travel, science, technology, mathematics, astronomy, time reckoning, land and marine architecture, cartography, principles of economics, law and religion, agriculture, animal husbandry, weaving, ceramics, metallurgy, and writing. We can assume that little rhymes or sayings could be accurately and quickly coded and decoded into formulas, procedures, laws, and the like. Traces of this ancient skill remain today. Illiterate Mayan peasants still retain the amazing skill and speed of their ancestors in making calendrical calculations. This skill deserves study which may reveal to us something of the sophistication of the ancients. The ancient Sea People had to have an alphabet for direction finding and time reckoning. They had to have a calendar for the solar year and for the seasons. They needed a system for calculating the lunar cycles, for their records, and for bookkeeping. The astonishing thing is that they only needed from twenty to thirty symbols for accomplishing all these tasks.
Our alphabet today, which retains only the sound values, is a shadow of the real miracle of this invention (Gordon, 1971, p. 105, 172).
Vere Gordon Childe notes that the hieroglyphic script comes from elements whose origin is clearly derived from the plants and animals of the Nile region. Yet its curious combination of phonetic signs with ideographs and determinants agrees so strikingly with the Babylonian that the two systems must be interrelated (Custance, 1961, p. 9).
One dialect of Indo-European Hittite was printed with movable stamps or type. The example found in Crete was the mysterious Phaistos disc, which must have been carried there from Asia Minor. The disc has not been deciphered. As one intriguing possibility, the Phaistos disc could be a highly sophisticated device to lead the mariner to a distant port, each symbol of the spiral being a significant astronomical or land checkpoint on the way. It is more likely that all the symbols are astral due to the spiral design of the disc. The ancients associated the spiral with the movements of the constellations in the heavens.
Carvings said to be Phoenician, other Mediterranean languages, or unknown scripts have been reported in many parts of the world. Such carvings have been observed in large numbers in the Amazon and Orinoco River tributary systems. More evaluation is needed of these reports. Many inscriptions have been found in past years in the Andean plateau which cannot yet be translated and which are thus far unidentified as to origin. Among other mysteries reported having to do with language is a recent find in the Well of the Virgins at Chichen-Itza. Associated with 13th century A.D. artifacts was a doll crudely made of wood and wax. A few Latin letters were carved on it. The Spanish did not arrive there until the 16th century(Berlitz, 1972, p. 57, 158); Argosy, May 1968, p. 65-67). The mystery, however, fades when one reads Fell (1976) where he has made an interesting but controversial beginning in deciphering many old Inscriptions found in America which were long written off as frauds or which were simply ignored. The brief Inscription referred to above is only one of many evidences of transoceanic travel long before Columbus. Some such Inscriptions are known to be fraudulent. There is every reason to believe that others are genuine.

Chapter 9: IS THERE AN IDEAL ALPHABET?
All would agree that the ideal alphabet would have one and only one letter for each speech sound, with perhaps a few concessions made for common compound sounds to be represented by a single symbol. For example, the long "i" sound in English is clearly a combination of two separate vowel sounds, and we would find it awkward to use two symbols to represent that familiar sound today. Accepting the genius of the invention of the alphabet, it is more than a little strange that no alphabet in common use in the world has ever reached this goal (Sturtevant, 1947, p. 24). It is of course somewhat arbitrary which sounds uttered by the human voice are to be recognized and dignified with a symbol. Yet strangely, all alphabets omit symbols for some common vocal sounds, and all contain redundant letters, that is, letters that represent sounds already provided for by other symbols. We can illustrate the idea of redundant letters by looking at ways one might spell out the sound of -ks as in "marks." One might spell it -CS as in lilacs, or -X as in box or -Q's, CKS, -KES, or -CHS. On the surface this may appear simply as another case of human stupidity or as a consequence of borrowing from different languages. Those who have attempted to reform the alphabet for the best of reasons have all failed. Our alphabet seems to be tamper-proof. We know that ancient Egypt had an alphabet of 24 symbols and chose not to develop its communication system by this means. The Chinese also in the most ancient times had an alphabet but elected to develop its present complex system instead. From these odd facts one can only conclude that some other very compelling factor entered into the formation of the ancient alphabet (Encyclopedia Britannica, 15th ed., Macrop., 1:627).
According to Moran (1969, p. 13, 28), religion is the only imaginable organizing principle behind the alphabet. Although some kinds of worship may well have sprung up independently, e.g., sun worship, the slaughter of a bull at the time of the spring equinox on both the altars of Ur and in the Valley of the Man in China shows common roots in a common culture. The 12 signs of the zodiac (the twelve constellations), the 12 months known throughout the ancient world of Europe, Asia, and North Africa point to a common source. The 52-year cycle was used both in the Orient and in pre-Columbian American cultures with 13 days of houses in a quarter. Lunar and solar calendars were brought into correspondence by the cycle of 52. The 52-card deck with 13 cards to a suit faithfully reproduces ancient calendrical knowledge. Even the Joker serves a calendrical function for leap years. The twelve signs of the solar zodiac may be in some way derived from the lunar zodiac of 27-28 signs. The relationship of the two is very unclear, but many of the same stars are involved in both sets of signs. From this well of astronomical and astrological knowledge, the alphabet was drawn.
To establish the source for the alphabet, one must show its great antiquity, wide diffusion, and some powerful cohesive principle outside itself in order to hold the signs in established order despite circumstances, time, and geography.
Gustavus Seyffarth, a 19th century scholar and rival of Champollion on the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics, served for a time in the 1850's on the faculty of Concordia Theological Seminary, St. Louis, Missouri. He understood two things clearly in our context which he expressed in his many writings. He was one of the first to grasp the idea that much actual history was concealed in myth and legend. Further he realized the overwhelming importance of the heavens in the life and culture of ancient man. Although Seyffarth is wrong in some of his conclusions, and though some of his work is necessarily conjectural, his voluminous works deserve careful study and reworking. He saw the connection between the alphabet and the skies about 150 years before this principle was rediscovered by Moran and Kelley (1969). Seyffarth states:
It is said and believed that our alphabet was invented by Cadmus in 1500 B.C., but this cannot be considered a historical fact. In the New Testament we read of a book that was written by Enoch 900 years prior to the Deluge. Pliny said that man always had literature. The Vedas and Avesta tell us that prior to the Deluge sacred books existed and that, in consequence of their loss, the human race became so wicked that the Creator resolved to destroy it.

The Koran (Sura 57) mentions that Noah was the author of a book... It is true that Cadmus invented the alphabet, but Cadmus means "ancestor," i.e., Noah. Cadmus was, like the latter, the first planter of the vineyard.
All these and similar traditions concur in demonstrating that the alphabet existed prior to the Deluge... The Noachian alphabet was a representation of the zodiac.
Seyffarth held that our alphabet is a reproduction of the zodiac with the constellation of the planets at a point in time of 3446 B.C., Septuagint chronology, apparently at the end of the Flood, probably according to the observation of Noah himself. Seyffarth translates Phoenician, Chinese, Chaldean, Greek, and Roman myths which clearly related the formulation of the alphabet to the zodiac (Seyffarth, 1886, p. 53-54).
An idea explored by both Seyffarth and Wadler much later focuses on the peculiar placement of the vowels in the alphabet. There is no logical sense in their location in our present alphabet, nor in any other alphabet where they are included: Abcd Efgh Ijklmn Opqrst Uv(W)x(Y)z. Wadler noted that the ancients associated the vowels as follows with the "7" planets: ao-Sun. i-Moon, a-Mars, e-Mercury, o-Jupiter, aw-Venus, oo-Saturn (Wadler, 1948. p. 103). Thus the intriguing notion has arisen that vowels and unneeded letters in some ancient alphabets may represent the position of the planets among the houses of the lunar zodiac, that is, the consonants, at a critical point in human history. Perhaps one reason Seyffarth's discussions have not been studied seriously is the common belief that any use of the concept of the zodiac involves astrology. In the ancient world there was no necessary connection. The above discussion is in no way connected with what we understand today as astrology. Unfortunately, Seyffarth was less than clear on just which alphabet he had in mind in ancient times that included vowels and apparently "useless" letters to indicate the location of the planets within the lunar zodiac at a crucial moment in history.
Moran's theory is that the alphabet was derived from 28-30 lunar signs, and that some of the signs are the actual appearance of a given constellation. Moran argues that the lunar zodiac is older than the solar zodiac. In support of his theory, he notes that there are startling correspondences between the lunar and the alphabetical signs (Moran, 1969, p. xiv-xviii).

SPADING UP ANCIENT WORDS

AN AFTERWORD
In taking a preliminary survey of language, speech, and the alphabet, we have made some interesting discoveries. The study of words and symbols tells us of ancient sites, culture, geographic setting, and level of sophistication. They tell us of ancient travel patterns and show that ancient travelers left their calling cards all over the world in the form of place names which can be traced back to their sources in the Old World, but with some degree of uncertainty to be sure. We see indications of deterioration after a previous higher level which hints at catastrophic events. We find no support at all for any kind of evolutionary development of language. If anything, the evidence clearly shows that languages have become simplified out of a more complex past. The development of English is a good example of this. In all of our exploration we find that the characteristics and events in language and the alphabet fit very comfortably within a framework of history as described in Genesis. Perhaps our greatest surprise is the unmistakable evidence in support of linking the alphabet with star formations. But as we have stressed before, such an origin has no relationship at all with astrology. It seems reasonable to say that linguistic studies will continue to be immensely useful and will continue to illuminate the ancient past.
There are many complicating factors. We have noted more than once that deliberate attempts were made in many cultures to keep a knowledge of writing away from all except a small elite group in the society. Writing was sacred, and thus it is no surprise to see civilizations moving from alphabetical systems to more complicated ways. Another factor which must not be overlooked is the tabu. There is the odd Inca legend, for example, that writing was once known but abolished by an ancient ruler on the assumption that writing had caused a plague. It seems reasonable to say that cultures changed radically overnight as a result of a tabu imposed by the person or group in power. The tabu may help to explain the curious absence of important inventions in cultures at later states of development. We know, for example, that the wheel was well known in the Middle American cultures and was used for toys. Yet by the time of the Spanish explorers the wheel was unknown (Berlitz. 1972. p. 53-57).
The sacredness of writing and the tabu may be better explanations for the peculiar development of writing than any theory of gradual development from primitive to modern forms.
We examined some words of unusual historical richness. We learned some interesting insights about the Pre-Flood world on the basis of word studies. We found that ancient astronomical words told us much of early sophistication and traumatic events which changed the course of history many times. We discovered that word studies can teach us much about the ancient world, far beyond the mere meaning of the words themselves. The reader will agree that field archaeology and linguistic studies must go hand in hand whenever this is possible. Each gives us Information of critical importance. Searching out the significance of words and place names shows that there is Indeed a valuable study in the archaeology of words.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Author Erich A. von Fange, Ph.D., is Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Statistics at Concordia University, Ann Arbor MI, where he served from 1962-1987.
After graduating from Concordia College, Seward, NE, he began his teaching career at Christian schools in San Francisco, CA, and at other Lutheran Concordia Colleges in Seward, NE; and Edmonton, Alberta. Besides his teaching, he served in various administrative positions and was a member of boards, committees, and commissions devoted to Christian higher education. His graduate degrees are from the University of Nebraska (M.A.) and the University of Alberta (Ph.D.).
His writing and lectures reflect many years of study of a biblical framework for the ancient world. He has long been absorbed in the study of ancient history, Old Testament, archaeology, geology, paleontology, and related sciences. From extensive reading, field trips and other travel, he has written and published books and papers on prehistory and ancient history, as they relate to a biblical framework.
Long ago he discovered that pastors, Christian teachers, and parents are troubled by the good questions of children as well as adults of all ages about supposed Bible/science conflicts. In the early 1970s he began to write a series of papers published in the Creation Research Society Quarterly and other Christian publications. Several papers were translated into Portuguese and are circulating among Christians in Brazil. Over the past three decades his Surprises in Genesis lectures have been presented to Elderhostel and many other adult and youth groups.
Among his hobbies, past and present, are rockhounding, photography, travel, and chess. He was a frequent visitor to the dinosaur beds in Alberta. Trips were made to Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Israel and elsewhere to visit important sites and for the preparation of programs on the biblical world as illuminated by archaeology. Dr. von Fange and his wife Esther currently live in Adrian MI.
His writings include the following titles:
Time Upside Down. The ancient world was far more interesting and surprising than you can imagine, and not at all like the dull treatment it receives in the textbooks. The idea of vast periods of time is only a clumsy invention by evolutionists to try to make things happen without God. Illustrated and documented.
Helping Children Understand Genesis and the Dinosaur. One reviewer said this book is perfect for ages 10 to 100. It was written especially for pastors, teachers, and parents to help children understand how and when the dinosaur lived and died on a young, created earth.
Noah to Abram: The Turbulent Years. The fascinating true story of the early centuries after the Flood. New light is shed on the Ice Age, Stone Age, and Cave Man within a true biblical framework.
Genesis and the Dinosaur. The amazing story of the rise and fall of the dinosaur on a young created earth, and it shows the consequences of the Fall away from God! Hardly a year goes by without exciting new dinosaur finds, yet the mysteries about these strange creatures deepen. Their fossil remains form a backdrop for a biblical foundation of the rise and extinction of the dinosaur within the framework of a young, created earth. Genesis tells more about the preFlood world in which the dinosaur lived than is generally thought. This is an easy to read and fully documented book for adults.

In Search of the Genesis World (in preparation). The arts and sciences that treat the ancient world reveal glimpses of the same wonderful story we find briefly described in the Bible. We observe this in the study of ancient history, literature and art, archaeology, linguistics, historical geology, astronomy, paleontology, and anthropology. The explorations in this book give a true picture of the ancient world by cleansing many interesting topics of faulty and outmoded thinking that tries to ungod the unverse.
