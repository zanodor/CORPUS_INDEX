PREF ACE.
SOME explanation may be necessary for the publication of an essay on the antiquity of the Vedas by one whose
professional work lies in a different direction. About four
years ago, as I was reading the Bhagavad Gita, it occurred
to me that we might derive important conclusions from fche statement of Krishna that ''he was Margashirsha of the
months. " This led me to inquire into the primitive Vedic calendar, and the result of four years' labour is now placed before the public. The essay was originally written for the Ninth Oriental Congress held in London last year.
But it was found too large to be inserted in the proceedings wherein its summary alone is now included. I have had
therefore to publish it separately, and in doing so I have
taken the opportunity of incorporating into it such addi
tions, alterations and modifications, as were suggested by further thought and discussion.
The chief res alt of my inquiry would be evident from the
title of the essay. The high antiquity of the Egyptian civilization is now generally admitted. But scholars still hesitate to place the commencement of the Vedic civilization earlier than 2400 B.C. I have endeavoured to show
in the following pages that the traditions recorded in
the Rigveda unmistakably point to a period not later than 4000 B.C., when the vernal equinox was in Orion, or,
in other words, when the Dog-star ( or the Dog as we have
it in the Rigveda) commenced the equinoctial year. Many of the Vedic texts and legends, quoted in support of this conclusion, have been cited in this connection and also ration

ally and intelligently explained for tho first time, tlius throwing a considerable light on the legends and rites in
later Sanskrit works. I have farther tried to show how
these legends are strikingly corroborated by the legends and traditions of Iran and Greece. Perhaps some of this
corroborative evidence may not be regarded as sufficiently
conclusive by itself, but in that case I hope it will be borne in mind that my conclusions are not based merely upon my
thological or philological coincidences, and if some of these
are disputable, they do not in any way shake the validity of the conclusions based on the express texts and references
scattered over the whole Vedic literature. I wanted to
collect together all the facts that could possibly throw any light upon, or be shown to be connected with the question in issue, and if in so doing I have mentioned some "that are
not as convincing as the others, 1 am sure that they will at
least be found interesting, and that even after omitting them there will be ample evidence to establish the main
point. I have, therefore, to request my critics not to be I prejudiced by such facts, and to examine Mid weigh the Iwhole evidence I have adduced in support of my theory
before they give their judgment upon it,
I have tried to make the book as little technical as possible | but I am afraid that those who are not acquainted
withtJie Hindu method of computing time may still find ife
somewhat difficult to follow the argument in a few places. If my conclusions come to be accepted and th seeoticl
edition of the book be called for, these defects ffiay T^e
removed by adding further explanations in such oftff6& >; - At
present I have only attempted to give the maiti argument
on the assumption that the reader is already familiar with the method, I may further remark that though I have



PREFACE. V.
used the astronomical method, yet a comparison with Bent
ley's work will show that the present essay is more literary than astronomical in its character. In other words, it is the
Sanskrit scholars who have first of all to decide if my inter- /
pretations of certain texts are correct, and when this judg
ment is once given it is not at all difficult to astronomically
calculate the exact period of the traditions in the Rigveda.
I do not mean to say that no knowledge of astronomy is necessary to discuss the subject, but on the whole it would
be readily seen that the question is one more for Sanskrit t scholars than for astronomers to decide. '
Some scholars may doubt the possibility of deriving so important and far-reaching conclusions from the data
furnished by the hymns of the Rigveda, and some may
think that I am taking the antiquity of the Vedas too far
back. Bat fears like these are out of place in a historical
or scientific inquiry, the sole object of which should be to
search for and find out the truth, The method of investigation
followed by me is the same as that adopted by Bentley, Colebrooke and other well-known writers on the subject,
and, in my opinion, the ojaly question that Sanskrit scholars
have now to decide, is whether I am or am not justified in
carrying it a step further than my predecessors, indepen
dently of any modifications that may be thereby made
necessary in the existing hypothesis on the subject.
I have omitted to mention in the essay that a few native scholars have tried to ascertain the date of the MaMbh&rata,
and the Rkn&yana from certain positions of the sun, the moon and the planets given in those works. For instance,
the horoscope of R&ma and the positions of the planets at the time of the great civil war, aa found in the Mah&bh&rata,



VI PREFACE.
are said to point to a period of 5000 or 6000 B. C., and it is
contended that the Vedas which preceded these works
mast be older still. Bentley relying on the same data has
calculated 961 B. C. as the exact date of Rama's birth.
| This will show how unsafe it is to act upon calculations
\] based upon such loose statements. Sometimes the accounts
in the Puranas are themselves conflicting, but even where they are or can be made definite any conclusions based on
them are not only doubtful, but well nigh useless for chro
nological purposes, for in the first instance they are open to the objection that these works may not have been written by eye-witnesses ( the mention of Edshis in the
Bamayana directly supporting such an assumption ) , and, secondly, because it is still more difficult to prove that we now possess these books in the form in which they were
originally written. With regard to the positions of the planets at the time of the war given in the Mahabharata, the statements are undoubtedly confused ; but apart from
it, I think that it is almost a gratuitous assumption to hold
that all of them really give us the positions of the planets in the ecliptic and that such positions again refer to the fixed and the moveable zodiacal portions of the Nakshatras.
Perhaps the writers simply intend to mention all auspicious
or inauspicious positions of the planets in such cases. I have therefore avoided all such debatable and doubtful
points by confining myself solely to the Vedic works, about the genuineness of which there can be no" doubt, and using the Puranic accounts only to corroborate the results deduced from the Vedic texts. According to this view the Mahabharafea war must be placed in the Krittika period, inas
much as we are told that Bhishma was waiting for the turning of the sun from the winter solstice in the month

of Magha. The poem* as we now have it, is evidently written a long time after this event.
Lastly, I have to express my obligations to several friends
for encouraging me to carry on the inquiry and helping me in one way or another to complete this essay. My special thanks are however due to Dr. Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, who kindly undertook to explain to me the views of German scholars in regard to certain passages from the Rigveda, and to Khan Bahadur Dr. Dastur Hoshang Jamasp for the ready assistance he gave in supplying information
contained in the original Parsi sacred books. I am also
greatly indebted to Prof. Max M tiller for some valuable
suggestions and critical comments on the etymological evidence contained in the essay. I am, however, alone
responsible for all the views, suggestions, and statements
made in the following pages. With these remarks I leave the book in the hands of
critics, fully relying upon the saying of the poet
" The fineness or the darkness of gold is best tested in
fire. " It is not likely that my other engagements will
permit me to devote much time to this subject in future ; and
I shall consider myself well rewarded if the present essay
does in any way contribute to a fuller and unprejudiced
discussion of the high antiquity of the Aryan civilization, of which our sacred books are the oldest records in the world.

Importance of ascertaining the A,ge of the Vedas Linguistic method Its defects Astronomical method Its difficulties unduly magnified Views of European and Native scholars examined .
THE VEDA is the oldest of^the books that we now possess,
and it is generally admitted " that for a study of man, or if
you like/ for a study of Aryan humanity, there is nothing in
the world equal in importance with it. 3 '* There is no other book which carries us so near the beginning of the Aryan
civilization, if not the absolute beginning of all things, as maintained by the Hindu theologians ; and the importance
of ascertaining even approximately the age when the oldest of the Vedic Rishis, like the classical Valmiki, may have
been inspired to unconsciously give utterance to a Vedic verse, cannot therefore be overrated- The birth of Gautama
Buddha, the invasion of Alexander the Great, the inscrip
tions of Ashoka, the account of the Chinese travellers, and the overthrow of Buddhism and Jaiuism by Bhatta Rumania
and Shankarach&rya, joined with several other loss important

periods of the same still defy all attempts to ascertain their
chronology ; and the earliest of them all, so important to the

still the snbject of vague and uncertain speculations. Qan
we or can we not ascertain the age of the Vedas ? This is
a question which has baffled the ingenuity of many an.
ancient and a modern scholar, and though I have ventured to write on the subject I cannot claim to have finally solved
this important problem in all its bearings. I only wish, to .place before the public tte result of my researches in this direction and leave it to scholars to decide if it throws any
^additional light on the earliest periods of the Aryan civilisation.
But before I proceed fco state nay views, it may be useful

called the literary or the linguistic .method of ascertaining
the age of the Vedas. A little consideration will, however,
at once disclose the weak points in such arbitrary calcula
tions. There are different opinions as to the division of r
the Vedic literature ; some scholars holding that the Chhan
das and Mantra is one period, though a long- one. But
granting that the Vedic literature admits of a four-fold'
division, the question of the duration of. each period", is still*
involved in uncertainty and, considering the fact that each* period might run into and overlap the ofcher to- a certain^
extent, it becomes extremely difficult to assign even the
minimum chronological limits to the -different periods. Themethod may, indeed; be used with advantage to show that the Vedas could not have been composed later than a cer
tain period; but it helps little in eve a- approximately fixing
the correct age of the Vedaa. Prof. M&x Mutter himself
admits* that the limit of 200 years carjube assigned to ea,ch
period only under the supposition that during ther- early periods of history the growth of the^human mind' was more
luxuriant than in later times-; while the late Dr}. Haug,,
following the same method, fixed the very commencement of the Vedic literature between 2400-2000 B. C.,f by'
assigning- about 500 years to each period^, on the analogy of similar periods in tire Chinese literature. It is- therefore
evident that this method of calculation^ howsoever valuable

it may be in checking the results arrived at "by other me
thods, is, when taken by itself, most vague and uncertain*
A farther study of the different periods of the Vedic literature and its comparison with other ancient literatures nrigHt hereafter help us to ascertain the duration of each
period a little more accurately.* But I think we cannot
expect, by this method alone, to be ever in a position to fix with any approach to certainty the correct age of the Vedas.
Prof. Max Muller considers 200 years to be the minimum duration of each period* while Dr. Haug and Prof. Wilson
thooght that a period of 500 years was not too long for the
purpose ;f and I believe there is hardly any inherent improbability if a third scholar proposes to extend the duration
of eaeh of these periods up to something like 1000 years. In t3*e face of this uncertainty we must try to find out other means for ascertaining the correct age of the Vedas*
The Vedas, the Brahmanas and the Sutras contain numerous allusions and references to astronomical facts, and it was believed that we might be able to ascertain from them the
a*ge of the oldest literary relic of the Aryan race. But somehow or other the attempts of scholars to fix the age of Ihe Vedas by what may be called the astronomical method^ have not yet met with the expected success. Unfortunately for us, alt the Sanskrit astronomical works that we now

Dhmva has recently examined the whole Vedic literature with a
view to ascertain its chronology* and he arrives at the conclusion
that the ctnnttion assigned to the several periods of the Vedic
literature by Prof. Max Mailer is toe short, and that "without
making any guesses at numbers of years or centuries** we should

possess, except perhaps the Vedanga Jyotishaj belong to the later period of Sanskrit literature, when the Greek influence
is perceptible in. all its mathematical works. The different
methods of astronomical calculations given in these works-,
the various eras that were established in India after Shali
v&hana or Vikrama, the introduction of the Barhaspatya cycle, and the adoption of the Greek division of the Zodiac-,
make it extremely difficult to correctly interpret the astronomical references in the later works ; while the confusion, caused by the supposed absence of any definite statement as to the character of the year and the cycle mentioned in the Vedic works, renders it a hard task to deduce a consistent theory out of the various but stray references to astrono
mical facts in the Vedic literature. Take for instance the
question of the commencement of the year in the Vedic calendar. There are grounds to hold that the ancient Aryas
commenced their year either with spring or with autumn, at
the equinoxes or at the solstices ;* while the later astrono
mical works and systems furnish us with facts which go to
prove that the year, in the different parts of India, com* monced with almost all the different months of the year
K&rtika, M&rgashJrslia,t AsMdha, Chaitra and Bhadrapada. The discussion as to the number of the Nakshatras and
different opinions as to their origin have further complicated the problem ; while doubts have been raised as to the capacity of the Brfthmaus in 3200 B. C. to make observa
tions of solstitial points with astronomical accuracy,:]: I shall

THE ORION [CHAPTER
have to examine hereafter how far some of these objections
are tenable. For the present it is sufficient to state that in
consequence o such doubts and objections, definite observations or allusions to astronomical events in the earliest
works have been looked upon with suspicion by t a good many Oriental scholars, while some have "even condemned
the astronomical method as inaccurate and conjectural.* It is, however, admitted that "if the astronomical data on
which conclusions as to the age of the Veda have been
built implied all that they were represented to imply, the earliest periods of Yedic- poetry will have to be rearranged.'
7t
It appears to me that scholars have erred too- much on the
mde of overcaujtiousness in condemning this method. I do
*mot mean to say that there are no difficulties ; but sufficient
eare does not appear to have been taken to always keep in
'Tiew the main point of the- inquiry, by separating it from the mass of irrelevant matter, with which, in some cases,
it becomes unavoidably mixed up,.- Some 0f Bentley's
speculations, for instance, are indeed ingenious and suggestive, but he relies too much upon Puranic traditions,
mere etymological speculations and his own calculations b^sed thereon, instead of trying to find out whether there is
anything in the earlier works to corroborate or support these
traditions; On the other hand, Prof. WebWs Essay, wkidlt, as a collection of astronomical allusions and referen
ces in the Vedic-literature, is extremely valuable, is takeh lip by the controversy as to the origin of the- Kakshatrate raised by M, Biot ; and the same thing may be said of

other questions, such as whether the Vedic cycle comprised
five or six years, how and when the intercalary days or months were inserted to make the lunar correspond with the solar year, have also caused the attention of scholars to be diverted from the broad astronomical facts and observations to be found recorded in the Vedic literature ; and as a
consequence we find that while the questions as to the original number of the Nakshatras and as to whether the Chinese borrowed them from the Hindus or vies versa, are
so ably discussed, no systematic attempt has yet been made to trace back the astronomical references in the - later
works to the Sauhitas, and to fully examine their bearing
on the question of the age and character of the Vedas. On
the contrary, Prof. Weber asks us to reconcile ourselves to
the fact that any such search will, as a general rule, bo
absolutely fruitless !"* In the following pages I have endea
voured to shew that we need not be so much disappointed. In my opinion there is ample evidence direct and circum
stantial in the earliest of the Sanhitas, to fully establish
the high antiquity assigned to the Indian literature on
geographical and historical grounds, f I base my opinion mainly upon references to be found in the early Vedic
works, the Sanhitas and the Br&hrnanas, and especially in the earliest of these, the Rigveda. For though later works
may sppaetimes give the same traditions and references/ yefe any in&;rep.ce which is based upon them is likely to be re
garded with more or less suspicion, unless we can show
* Weber's History of Indian Literature, p. 7. t It is on these grounds that Prof. Weber believes that the be

8 THE ORION [CHAPTER
something in the 'earliest works themselves to justify that
inference. Where the Sanhitas and the Brahmanas directly
speak of the actual state of things in their time, there is, of
course, no ground to disbelieve the same, but I think that
even the traditions recorded in these works are more reliable
than those in later works, for the simple reason that those
traditions are there found in their purest form. Later
works may indeed be used to supply confirmatory evidence, where such is available; but our conclusions must in the ^ main be based on the internal evidence supplied by the ij Vedic works alone. Several Indian astronomers have ' worked more or less on the lines here indicated, but their
labours in this direction have not unfortunately received
the attention they deserve. The late Krishna SMstri
Godbole published his views on the antiquity of the Vedas in the second and third Volumes of the J'heosop'hist,* and
though he has failed to correctly interpret some astronomical allusions in the Vedic works, yet there is much that
is suggestive and valuable in his essay. The 'late Prof. X. L. Ohhatre also appears to have held similar views on
&e -subject, but he has not published them, so far as I fcb*w, in a systematic form. My friend Mr. Shankara

done, has also discussed this question in his essay,, which I was allowed to read in MS. through his kindness. I am
indebted to these scho]ars for some of the facts and argu
ments set forth in the following pages, and the present essay may, I think, be regarded as greatly developing, if not completing, the theory started by them.

IT is necessary, in the first place, to see what contrivances were adopted by the ancient Aryas for the measure
ment and division of time. The present Indian system has been thus described by Professor Whitney in his notes to
the Siirya Siddhanta (r. 13, notes) :
fc In the ordinary reckoning of time* these elements are
u variously combined. Throughout Southern India (see
*' Warren's Kala Sankalita, Madras, 1825, p. 4, etc.), the
M year and month made use of are the solar, and the day the

" is likewise kept up, and to maintain tlie concurrence of
" the civil and lunar days, and the lunar and solar months,
" is a process of great complexity, into the details of which <f we need not enter here.'*
But the complications here referred to are evidently the
growth of later times. The four ways of reckoning time, the Sftvana, the Chandra, the Nakshatra and the Saura, are
not all referred to in the early works, and even in later days all these measures of time do not appear to have been fully
and systematically utilised. There is, as I have said before,
no early work extant on Vedic calendar, except the small tract on Jyotisha, and our information about the oldest
calendar must, therefore, be gathered either from stray references in the Vedic works or from the early traditions
or practices recorded in the old sacrificial literature of
India. There are several sacrificial hymns in , the Rigveda, which show that the sacrificial ceremonies must then have
been considerably developed ; and as no sacrificial system could be developed without the knowledge of months, seasons, and the year, it will not be too much to presume that in Vedic times there must have existed a calendar to regu
late the sacrifices. It is difficult to determine the exact
nature of this calendar, but a study of the sacrificial litera
ture would show that the phases of the moon, the changes in the seasons, and the southern and northern courses of the sun were the principal land-marks in the measurement
of time in those early days. What is still more interesting,
however, is that the leading features in the early sacrifices are the same as those in the year. The late Dr. Haug, in
his introduction to the Aitareya Br&hmana,, has observed
that "the satras, which lasted for one year, were nothing but
81$. imitation of the sun's *yearly course. They were divided



12 THE ORION [CHAPTER
into two distinct parts, each consisting of six months of 80 days each. In the midst of both was the Vishuvdn, i. e.,
the equator or the central day, catting the whole satra into
two halves."* This clearly shows that the ancient Rishis
prepared their calendar mainly for sacrificial purposes, and
the performance of various sacrifices facilitated, in its turn,
the keeping up of the calendar. Offerings were made every
morning and evening, on every new and full moon, and at
the commencement of every season and ay ana. f When this course of sacrifices was thus completed, it was naturally
found that the year also had run its course, and the sacri!e&ai the year, therefore, seem to have early become synonymous terms. There are many passages in the
Br^bmanas and Sanhit&s, where Samvatsara and Yajna are declared to be convertible terms,J and no other theory has yet been suggested on which this may be accounted for. I
am therefore inclined to believe that the Vedic Rishis kept
up their calendar by performing the corresponding round of sacrifices on the sacred fire that constantly burnt in their
houses, like the fire of the Parsi priest in modern times.
e numerous sacrificial details, which we find so fully
in the Brahmanas, might be later innovations,

II.] SACRIFICE alias THE YEAR. 13
but the main idea of the yearly sacrifice appears to be an
old one. The etymology of the word ritvij ( ritu+yaj^= season sacrificer) shows that even in the oldest days there
existed a certain correspondence between the sacrifices and the seasons, and what is true of the seasons is true of the
year which according to one derivation of samvatsara (vas
=
to dwell ) is nothing but a period where seasons dwell, or
a cycle of seasons.* The priests were not only the sacri
ficers of the community, but were also its time-keepers, t and these two functions they appear to have blended into one by assigning the commencement of the several sacrifices
to the leading days of the year, on the natural ground that if
the sacrifices were- to be performed they must be performed on the principal days of the year. J Some scholars have suggested that the yearly satras might have been subse
quently invented by the priests. But the hypothesis derives little support from the oldest records and traditions of all
the sections of the Aryan race. Without a yearly satra
* Of. Bhanu Dikshita's Com. on Amara i. 4. 20. Dr. Schrader,
in his Prehistoric Antiquities of the Aryan Peoples, Part iv., Ch. vi.
(p. 305), also makes a similar observation. He holds, on philological
grounds, that the conception of the year was already formed in the primeval period by combining into one whole the conception of winter and summer, which he believes to be the two primeval
seasons.
f " In Rome the care of the calendar was considered a religious
function, and it had from earliest times been* placed in the hands
of the pontiffs/' Lewis's Historical Survey of the Astronomy of the
Ancients, p. 24.
J " Plato states that the months and years are regulated in
order that the sacrifices and festivals may correspond with the
natural seasons ; and Cicero remarks that the system of intercala
tioa was introduced with this object." Lewis's His; Aste Aac^ p. 19.



THE ORION [CHAPTER
regularly kept up, a Vedic Rishi could hardly have been able to ascertain and measure -the course of time in the way
he did. When better contrivances were subsequently
discovered the sacrifices might naturally become divested of
their time-keeping function and the differentiation so caused
might have ultimately led to an independent development of both fche sacrifices and the calendar. It is to this stage
that we must assign the introduction of the numerous details
of the yearly sacrifice mentioned in later works ; and thus
understood, the idea of a sacrifice extending over the whole
year, may be safely supposed to have originated in the oldest days of the history of the Aryan race."* In fact, it may be regarded as coeval with, if not antecedent to, the very
beginning of the calendar itself.
We have now to examine the principal parts of the year,
alias the sacrifice. The sdvana or the civil day appears to

for the month and the moon coincide, with occasional small
differences of suffix,* inmost of the Indo-European languages, and we may therefore conclude that in the primitive Aryan
times the month was determined by the moon. Now a
month of thirty civil or s&vana days cannot correspond with a lunar synodical month, and the Brahmavadins liad therefore to omit a day in some of the sdvana months to secure the concurrence of the civil and the lunar months. t The year of 360 sdvana days was thus practically reduced to a lunar year of 354 civil days or 360 tithis. But a further
correction was necessary to adjust the lunar with the solar reckoning of time. The zodiac was not yet divided into
twelve equal parts , and the solar month, as we now understand it, was unknown. The commencement of the cycle of
seasons was, therefore, the only means to correct the calendar,
and the ancient Aryas appeared to have early hit upon the device of the intercalary days or month for that purpose*
There are many passages in the Taittirlya and V&jasaneyi Sanhit&s and also one in the Rigveda$ wherein the inter
calary month is mentioned, and though opinions may differ as to when and how it was inserted, we may, for the purpose
of our present inquiry, regard it as undisputed that in the old 7edic days means were devised and adopted to secure

the correspondence of the lunar with the solar year. The occurrence of the twelve hallowed nights amongst the
Teutons points to the same conclusion. They were in fact
the supplementary days (366-354=12) required to balance the lunar with the solar year, a period when the Ribhus, or the genii of the seasons, slackened their course and enjoyed
the hospitality of the sun after toiling for a whole year (Rig. i. 33. 7.),* and when Prajapati, the God of sacrifices, after
finishing the old year's sacrifice, prepared himself for the new year's work (Atharva Veda iv. 11. 1L). The sacrificial literature of India still preserves the memory of these days
by ordaining that a person wishing to perform a yearly sacrifice should devote ] 2 days ( dvddasMJia ) before its
commencement to the preparatory rites. These facts, in
my opinion, conclusively establish that the primitive Aryans had solved the problem involved in balancing the solar with the lunar year. There may be some doubt as to whether the concurrence of the two years was at first secured by
intercalating twelve days at the end of every lunar year, or whether the days were allowed to accumulate until an
intercalary month could be inserted. The former appears to
have been the older method, especially as it has been utilised
and retained in the performance of yearly sacrifices ; but whichsoever may be the older method., one thing is certain,
that primitive Aryas had contrived means for adjusting the lunar with the solar year. Prof. Weber and Dr. Schraderf appear to doubt the conclusion on the sole ground that we

cannot suppose the primitive Aryans to have so far advanced in civilization as to correctly comprehend such, problems.
This means that we must refuse to draw legitimate inferences
from plain facts when such inferences conflict with our
preconceived notions about the primitive Aryan civilization.
I am not disposed to follow this method, nor do I think that
people, who knew and worked in metals, made clothing of
wool, constructed boats, built nouses and chariots, performed
sacrifices, and had made some advance in agriculture,* were
incapable of ascertaining - the solar and the lunar year. They could not have determined it correct to a fraction of a second as modern astronomers have done; but a rough
practical estimate was, certainly, not beyond their powers of comprehension. Dr. Schrader has himself observed that
the conception of the year in the primeval period was formed by combining the conceptions of the seasons.f If
so, it would not be difficult, even for these primitive Aryans,
to perceive that the period of twelve full moons fell short
of their seasonal year by twelve days. Dr. Schrader again
forgets the fact that it is more convenient, and hence easier
and more natural, to make the year begin with a particular season or a fixed position of the sun in the heavens, than to have an ever-varying measure of time like the lunar year.

months by the moon and their years by the sun," J and

this appears to me to have been tie system in force in the
Indo-Grerrnanie, or at any rate in the primitive Vedic period. There is no other conclusion that we can fairly draw from
the facts and passages noted above.
There is, however, a farther question, as to whether the solar year, with reference to which these corrections were
made^ was tropical or sidereal. It is true that the great
object of the calendar was to ascertain the proper time of
the seasons. But the change in the seasons consequent
npon the precession of the equinoxes is so exceedingly minute as to become appreciable only after hundreds of years, and it is more probable than not that it must have escaped the notice of the early observers of the heavens,
whose only method of determining the position of the sun in the ecliptic was to observe every morning the fixed stars nearest that luminary.* Under such a system the
year would naturally be said to be complete when the sun returned to the same fixed star. Prof. Whitney has pointed out that the same system is followed in the Surya Siddbanta,
thoQgh the motion of the equinoxes was then discovered.t
It is, therefore, natural to presume that the early Vedic
priests were ignorant of the motion of the equinoxes. Eo early work makes any mention of or refers to it either expressly or otherwise ; and the solar year mentioned in

the Vedic works must, therefore, be considered as sidereal and not tropical. This would necessitate a change in the
beginning of the year, every two thousand years or so, to make it correspond with the cycle of natural seasons, and the fact that such changes were introduced twice or
thrice is a further proof of the old year" being a sidereal one.* The difference between the sidereal and the tropical year is 20*4 minutes, which causes the seasons to fall back nearly one lunar month in about every two thousand years, if the sidereal solar year be taken as the standard of measure
ment. When these changes and corrections came to be noticed for the first time, they must have created a great
surprise, and it was not till after one or two adjustments on this account were made that their true reason, the motion of the equinoxes, could have been discovered, Garga tells
us that if the sun were to turn to the north without reaching
Dhanihtha, f it foretold great calamity, and I am disposed
to put a similar interpretation upon the story o Praj&pati alias Yajna alias the year, who, contra-ry to all expectations, moved backwards to his daughter Rohini. $ But as I wish
to examine the tradition more fully hereafter, it is not neces
sary to dilate on the point here. My object at present is to show that the Vedic solar year was sidereal and
not tropical, and what has been said above is, I believe,

Opinions differ as to whether the lunar month began wifcli the full or the new moon,* and whether the original number of Natshatras was 27 or 28. f But I pass over these and
similar other points as not very relevant to my purpose,
and take up next the question of the commencement of the year. I have already stated that the sacrifice and
the year were treated as synonymous in old days, and we
may, therefore, naturally expect to find that the beginning1 of the one was also the beginning of the other. The Ved&nga
fJyotisha makes the year commence with the winter solstice, and there are passages, in the Shrauta Sutras which lay down that the annual sacrifices like t/avd-m-ayana^ should
be begun at the same time.$ A tradition has also been recorded by Jaimini and others that all Deva ceremonies
should be performed^ only during the Uttarayana; and the
"Ottarayana, according to the several Jyotisha works,]] is the period of the year from the winter to the summer solstice,

that is, from the time when the sun turns towards the north
till it returns towards the south. This leads one to suppose
that the winter solstice was the beginning of the year and
also of the Uttarayana at the time when the annual sacrifices
were established, and therefore in the old Vedic days.
But a closer consideration of the ceremonies performed in
the yearly satras will show that the winter solstice could
not have been the original beginning of these satras. The middle day of the annual satra is called the Vishuvan day, and it is expressly stated that this central day divides
the satra into two equal halves, in the same way as the . Vishuvan or the equinoctial day divides the year.* The satra was thus the imitation of the year in every respect,
and originally it. must have corresponded exactly wifch the course of the year. Now, as Vishuvan literally means the
time when day and night are of equal length, if we suppose the year to have at the time commenced with the winter solstice, the Vishuvan or the equinoctial day could never have been its central day; and the middle day of the satra
would correspond, not with the equinoctial, as it should, but with the summer solstice. It might be urged that Vishuvan as referring to the satra should be supposed to be
used in a secondary sense. But this does not solve the difficulty. It presupposes that Vishuvdm, must have been used at one time in the primary sense (i. e. ? denoting the
time when day and night are equal); and if in its primary sense it was not used with reference to the satm, it must
| have been so used at least with reference to the year. But
if Vishuvan was thus the centra] day of the year, the year
must have once commenced with the equinoxes. The word

the summer solstice.* But notwithstanding their high
authority it will be found that their interpretation, though in consonance with the later astronomical views, is directly opposed to the passages in the Vedic works. In the
Taittinya Sanhita vi. 5. 3, we are told "the sun/ therefore,
goes by the south for six months and six by the north. " But
this does not help us in ascertaining the correct meaning
of the phrase " by the north." As it stands it may mean
either the solstitial or the equinoctial six months. We must
therefore look for another passage, and this we find in the
Bhatapatha Brahmana (ii. ]. 3,. 1-3), wherein describing the two aforesaid paths it lays down, in distinct terms that Vasanta, Grishnm and Varsha are the seasons of the Devas ; Sharad, Hemanta and Shishira those of the Pitris the in
creasing fortnight is of the Devas ; the decreasing one of the Pitris: the day is .of the Devas; the night of the Pitris:
again the fir st part of the day is of the Devas ; the latter of
the Pitris ...... When he (the sun) turns to the north, he is
amongst the Devas and protects them ; when he turns to
the south he is amongst the Pitris and protects them."t This removes all doubts as to what we are to understand by
devaydna, devapaiha, or devaloTca and uttardyona as connected with it. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is a part of the Shatapatha Brahmana, and we shall not be violating any
rule of interpretation if we interpret the passage in the one

in tlie light of a similar passage ia the otliei\ Now if Va~
santa (spring), Grlshnia (summer) and Varsha (rains) were tlie seasons of the Dev&s and the sun moved amongst the Devas when he turned to the north, it is impossible to 'main
tain that the Devayana or the Uttarayaua ever commenced with the winter solstice, for in neither hemisphere the winter
solstice marks tli beginning of spring,, tlie first of the Deva seasons* The seasons in Central A&ia and India differ. Thus the rains in India commence about or after the summer solstice, while in the plains of Asia the season occurs about the autumnal equinox:. But in neither cas-e Vasanta (spring) commences with, the winter solstice or
Varsha (rains) ends at the summer solstice. Wo rawst;

the three seasons of spring, summer, and rains, i. e., froml the vernal to the autumnal equinox, whoa the sun, was in I
the northern hemisphere or -to the north of the equator J
This shows farther that the oldest order of seasons did noil
place Varrfha (rains) at the summer solstice, when the chief Indian monsoon commences; but at the autumnal equinox.
The winter solstice, according to this order, falls in the middle of Hemanta. In the modern astronomical works,
the winter solstice is, however, placed at the end and not in the
middle of Hemanta, while the vernal equinox is said to fall in the middle of Vasanta. When the Vedic Aryas became
settled in India, such a change in the old order of seasons
was necessary to make them correspond with the real
aspect of nature. But it is difficult to determine exactly
when this change was made.* The old order o seasons

given in the passage above quoted, however, clearly states jfchat Vasanta in old days commenced with the vernal
jequinox. We can now understand why Vasanta has been I spoken of as the first season and why the Nakshatras have been divided into two groups called the Deva Nakshatras and the Yama Nakshatras.* I am aware of the theory
which attempts to explain away the passages above cited as metaphorical to avoid the appearance of superstition. f But the method is neither sound nor necessary. The path of the Devas and the path of the Pitris are several times
referred to in the Rigveda, and though we migkt sppose the j
Brahmavldins to have developed the two ideas to thei^r '^Sf extent, it cannot be denied that the original ideais
an old one, suggested by the passage of the sun in the northern and southern hemispheres.
In the absence of anything to the contrary we niighfe j therefore take it as established that in the early Vedic days

the year began when the sun was in the vernal equinox ;
and as the sun then passed from the south to the north ot
the equator it was also the commencement of his northern In other words, the Uttariyaaa (if soch a word

Shiromani tie raises the question how the Uttarayana, as it ; was generally understood in his day, could be the day of the '
Devas? He admits that the celestial beings om Meru at the j
North Pole behold the si*n (during all the six months) 1
when lie is in the northern hemisphere (vii. 9) and theso
six months may therefore be properly called their day.* But tbe word uttardyana was then used to denote the
period of six months from the winter to- the- summer solstice ; and Bhaskaracharya was unable to understand how (
such an Uttarayana could be called the day of the Devas by - l
t
tbe writers of the astronomical Sanhitas. If the sun is '' yisible to the Gods at Meru from the vernal equinox j'< to> the summer solstice, its passage back to the autumnal
equinox lies through the same latitudes and in that passage, I
i. e^ during the three months after the summer solstice, the
sun must, says Bhaskaracharya, be visible to the Gods, But according to the Sanhita-writers the day of the Devas
ended with the Uttarayana, that is, as Bh&skara understood
the word, at the summer solstice. How is this conflict to
be reconciled ? Bhaskaracharya could give no satisfactory solution of the difficulty, and asks his readers to reconcile
the conflicting statements an the supposition that the
doctrine may be regarded as referring to "judicial astrology

to the autumnal equinox, I am suve^ he would uot have asked us to be satisfied with the lame explanation that the
.doctrine of the Sanhita- writers need not be mathematically
correct as it refers exclusively to judicial astrology. It is difficult to say whether the ancient Aryas ever lived so
near the north pole as to be aware of the existence of a. day
extending over at least two or three if not six rnontbs of the
year. But the idea that the day of the Bevas commences
when the sun passes to the north of the equator, appears to be an old one. In the Taittinya Brahmanaf iii. 9. 22. ]. we are told that the year is but a day of the Devas and

been cited as indicating the fact that the North Pole was inhabited

existence of a pre-glacial period. Is it not more probable to suppose that when vt tardy ana and dcilcshinuyana, came to be first

I have stated above that when the commencement of the
year was altered from fehe vernal equinox t the winter
solstice^ uffiardyana either lost its older meaning or was rather used to denote the solstitial division of the year.
But this is not the only consequence of that change. With the year the beginning of the annual satras was also gradually transferred to the winter solstice and the change
was complete when the Taittiriya Sanhita was compiled. Tn fact had it not been for the passage in the Shatapatha Bi-ahmana it would have been impossible to produce any
direct evidence of the older practice* When thje beginning of the satm was thus changed, the Yishiivan day must have
gradually lost its primary meaning and come to denote
simply the central day of the- yearly satra*
The old practice was not however completely forgotten and for tte purpose of the Nakshatra-sacrifices the vernal
equinox was still taken as. the starting point. Thus it is. that

tion appears to have been eventually lost sight of by the latsr writers and all references to uttardyana were understood to be made solely to the six months from the winter to the summer solstice, an error from which even Bh&ska
racharya did not escape, though, he perceived the absurdity caused by it in some cases. At the present day we on the southern side of the Narmada begin the year at the vernal
equinox for all civil purposes, but still all the religious
ceremonies prescribed to be performed in the Uttarayana, are performed during the Uttarayana beginning with the winter solstice, a position quite the reverse of that described
by Garg^a. When we at the present day have been
thus using the system of a double year-beginning, we need not be surprised if the ancient Aryas, after shifting the
commencement of the year to the winter solstice, managed
to keep up the old and the new system together by assigning the different beginnings of the year to different purposes as
indicated by Garga. It was the only alternative possible if
nothing old was to be entirely given up.

the one for sacrificial and the other for civil purposes. Let
us now examine if there is any reliable evidence to show
that "the Vedic priests made any corrections in the calendar
when by the precession of the equinoxes the cycle of seasons gradually fell back. All our present calendars are prepared on the supposition that the vernal equinox still coincides with, the end of Revatt and our enumeration of the Naksha
tras begins with Ashvini, though the equinox has now receded about 13 from Eevati. It has been shown by Prof.
Whitney (Surya Siddhanfca, viii.,, 9 note, p. 211 ) that theabove position of the vernal equinox may be assumed to be true at about 490 A.D. Taking this as the probable date of the introduction of the present system t we liave now to see if we can trace back the position of the veraaJ equinox
amongst the fixed circle of stars. The question, so far as

one antecedent stage is concerned, lias been thoroughly
discussed by Colebrooke, Bentley, Max MiUler, Weber, Whitney, Biot, and other scholars ; and I shall therefore only summarise what they have said, noting the points where I differ from them. I do not propose to enter into any
detailed mathematical calculations at this stage of the
inquiry, for I am of opinion that until we have thoroughly examined and discussed all the passages in the Vedic works
bearing on this question, and settled and arranged our facts, it is useless to go into minute numerical calculations. The Vedic observations could not again be such as need any minute or detailed arithmetical operations. I shall
therefore adopt for the present the simplest possible method of calculation, a method which may be easily understood and followed by any one, who can wa.tch and observe the
stars after the manner of the ancient priests. We shall assume that the zodiac was divided into 27 parts,not by
compass but, by means of the leading stars, which. Prof*
Max Miiller rightly calls the milestones of the heavens. The Vedic priest, who ascertained the motion of the sun
by observing with his unaided eye the nearest visible star,* cannot be supposed to have followed a different method in
making other celestial observations*; and, if so, we cannot
assume that he was capable of recognizing and using for the purposes of observation any artificial divisions of the
ecliptic on a mathematical principle, such as those which would result from the division of o60 of the zodiac into 2.7

followed in later days, when the means of observation
increased and the science of arithmetic was developed.
But in the earliest days of civilization, it is more natural to
suppose that the motions of the sun and the moon were deter
mined by observing which -of the known fixed stars was
nearest to them. When we, therefore, find it stated in the Vedic works that the sun was in the Krittikas, it is more
probable that the fixed asterism, and not the beginning of the artificial portion of the zodiac, was intended. I admit that the accuracy of such observations cannot be relied
upon within two or three degrees, if not more. But we
must take the facts as they are, especially when it is impossible to get anything more accurate from the ancient obser
vers of the heavens.* It will, I trust, however, be found
that this inevitable want of accuracy in the old observations does not affect our conclusions to such an extent as to make
them practically useless for chronological purposes. For
instance, suppose that there is a mistake of 5 in observing the position of the sun with reference to a fixed star when
the day and the night are of equal length. This would
cause an error of not more than 5X 72=360 years in our
calculations ; and in the absence of better means there is no
reason to be dissatisfied even with such a result, especially
when we are dealing with the remotest periods of antiquity.
I shall, therefore, assume that references to the Nakshatras
in the old Vedic works",* especially in cases where the mo
tions of other bodies are referred to them, are to the fixed
* Similar observations have been recorded by Greek poets. Homer mentions ' the turns of the sun/ and Hesiod c the rising and
the setting of the Pleiades at the beginnings of day and night.'
The observations in the Vedic works may be supposed to have been
made in a similar way.

asterisms and not -to the zodiacal portions. I may also
state here that as a change in the position of the vernal
equinox necessarily causes a similar change in the position of the winter solstice, both the beginnings of the year,
previously referred to, would require to be simultaneously altered. Whenever, therefore, we find a change in the position of the vernal equinox recorded in the early works,
we must look for the evidence of a corresponding alteration
in the position of the winter solstice, and the corroborative
evidence so supplied will naturally add to the strength of
our conclusions. This will, I hope, sufficiently explain the
pi*ocedure I mean to follow in the investigation of the problem before us. I shall now proceed to examine the
passages which place the vernal equinox in the Krittikas, beginning with the latest writer on the subject.
It is now well-known that Varahatnihira, in whose time the vernal equinox coincided with the end of Eevatl and
the summer solstice was in Punarvasu, distinctly refers in two places to the older position of the solstices recorded by
writers who preceded him. " When the return of the sun
took place from the middle of Ashlesha, " says he in his
Pancha Siddhautika, " the tropic was then right. It now
takes place from Punarvasu." * And, again, in the Brihat Sanhita iiL, 1 and 2, he mentions the same older position of
both the solstitial points amd appeals to his readers to ascertain for themselves by actual observation which of the
two positions of the solstices is the correct one, whether the

older position of the solstices or that given by the writer.*
It is clear, therefore, that in the days of Varahamihira, there existed works which placed the winter solstice in the begin
ning of (divisional) Dhanishtha and the summer solstice in the middle of Ashlesha. This statement of Varahamihira
is fully corroborated by quotations from Gargat and Parashara which we meet with in the works of the later com
mentators; and it appears that the system of commencing the year with the month of Magha, which corresponds with
the above position of the solstices> was once actually in vogue. Amarasinha states that the seasons comprise two months each, beginning with Magha, aiid three such seasons make an ayana*$ The same arrangement of seasons is also mentioned in the medical works of Fhushruta and Vagbhata. The account of the death of Bhlshma, related in the Mahabharata AnusMshaua-parva 167, further shows
that the old warrior, who possessed the superhuman power of choosing his time of death, was waiting on his death-bed for the return of the sun towards the north from the winter

solstice and that this auspicious event took place in the
first half of the month of M&gha.* It is evident from this that the winter solstice must have coincided in those days with the beginning of Dhanishtha as described in the
Vedanga Jyotisha and other works.
There is thus sufficient independent evidence bo show that before the Hindus began to make their measurements from
the vernal equinox in Revati there existed a system in. which the year commenced with the winter solstice in the month of Magha and the vernal equinox was in the last
quarter of Bharani or the beginning of the Krittikas."f- We
need not, therefore, have any doubts about the authenticity of a work which describes this older system and gives rales
of preparing a calendar accordingly. Now this is what the Vedanga Jyotisha has done. It is a small treatise on the
Vedic calendar, and though some of its verses still remain.

once supposed that the treatise mentions the Rdshis,
* Mah. Ann. 167, 26 and 28:
Lele, Modak, fcetkar and other Hindu astronomers have recently tried to determine the date of the Mahabharata war from such
references, and they hold that the vernal equinox was then in the Krittikas.
t Prof. MaxMuller has pointed out that in the Atharva Veda
i. 10. 7 and in the Yajnavalkya Smriti I. 267, the Krittikas occupy
their early position, while the Vishnu Parana actually places the
vernal equinox in theKpfctikas* See Pref. to Rig,, Vol. IV,, p. xxxi.



38 THE ORIOX. [CHAPTER
but a farther study of the work has shown that though the word Rdshi occurs in some of its verses, it is there used in
a totally different sense. This work gives the following
positions of the solstices and the equinoxes: *
1. The winter solstice in the beginning of Shravishtha,
(divisional) ;
2. The vernal equinox in 10 of Bharani;
3. The summer solstice in the middle of Ashlesha, and
4. The autumnal equinox in 3 20' of Vishakha.
The first year of the cycle commenced with the winter solstice* when the sun and the tnoon were together at the
beginning of Dhanishtha and the Uttarayana also began at the same time. There is very little else in the Vedanga
Jyotisha that may help us in our present inquiry except the fact that the enumeration of the deities presiding over the
various Nakshatras begins with Agni, the presiding deity of the Krittikasf. From these data astronomers have calculated that the solstitial colure occupied the position above mentioned between 1269 B. C. to 1181 B. C., according as
we take the mean rate of the precession of the equinoxes 50* or 48*-6 a year.J
Some scholars, however, have boldly raised the question, what authority is there to hold that the position of the
solstitial colure was recorded in the Vedanga Jyotisha from.

actual observation ? It is conceded that the position of the
solstitial colure might have been incorporated in the Jyotisha from real traditional information, but it is at the same
time contended that the language of the treatise and the
methods given therein create doubts about the antiquity claimed for the work on the strength of the position of the
solstitial points given therein. "I feel bound to remark/'
says Prof. Max Miiller, " that unless there was internal evidence that the Vedic hymns reached back to that remote
antiquity this passage in the Jyotisha would by itself carry no weight whatever*/ 5 The existence of the different versions
of the Vedanga Jyotisha and the obscurity into which some of its verses are still shrouded render it rather difficult to
meet the above objection, especially as it is a side attack on the antiquity of the work with an admission that the position oE the colure might have been recorded in the work from real traditions current in the time of its author. It
is, however, needless to answer this objection, inasmuch as there is ample confirmatory evidence in the Vedic works themselves which not only bears out the statement in the
Vedanga Jyotisha, but takes us back into still remoter
antiquity.
There are many passages in the Taittirlya Sanhita, the Taittiriya Brahmana and other works where the Krittikas
occupy the first place in the list of the Nakshatras.t In
the Taittiriya Brahmana (i. 1, 2, 1) it is distinctly stated

"one should consecrate the ( sacred ) fire in the Krittikas; ^ ......the Krittikas are the mouth of the Nakshatras."* ^
This shows that the first place given to the Krittikas in the ^
list of the Nakshatras is not accidental and that we must at ^
least suppose that the Krittikas were the *' mouth of the ^
Nakshatras/ 5 in the same way as Vasanta or spring was the ^

and naturally enough ifc must be similarly interpreted. But h * granting that the Krittikas were the mouth of the Naksha- y
tras in the sense that their list always commenced with them, ^
it may be' asked what position we are to assign to the I Krittikas in the course of the year. There were, as I have f
previously shown, two beginnings of the year, the winter F solstice and the vernal equinox; which of these two cor- |
responded with the Krittikas ? Or, are they, to be supposed j
r
to have coincided with a point altogether different from | ,
these two ? A little consideration will show that it is not f
difficult to answer these questions satisfactorily. The | present distance between the Krittikas and the summer solstice is more then 30, and if they ever coincided with
the summer solstice it must have been long ago in .the pre
sent cycle of the precession of the equinoxes. We cannot therefore interpret the above passage so as to place the summer solstice in the Krittikas, unless we are prepared to
take back the composition of the Taittiriya Sanhita to about
22,000 B, 0.5 and further suppose that all evidence of the intermediate astronomical observations is entirely lost, and
the same thing may be said against placing the Krittik&s

in the autumnal equinox.* Both the suggestions In my opinion are too extravagant to deserve any consideration. Nor can we assign the beginning of the Nakshatras to any random point in the ecliptic. There thus remain two pos
, sible explanations: viz., that the Krittikas coincided either
with the winter solstice, or with the vernal equinox,
Now, considering the fact that the vernal equinox is placed
in the last quarter of Bharani in the Vedauga Jyotisha it is more natural to presume that the vernal equinox coincided / with the Krittikas at the time when the Taittirlya Sanhita /
was compiled. But we need not depend upon probabilities
like these, when there are other passages in the Taittiriya Sanhita and Brahmana which, serve to clearly define the position of the Krittikas in those days.
In the Taittiriya Brahmana (i. 5, 2, 7) it is stated that
" the Nakshatras are the houses of gods , . . . the Nakshatras of the Devas begin with the Krittikas and end with Vishtakha,
whereas the Nakshatras of Yama begin with the Anuradhas and end with the Apa-Bharanis. J; t Prof. Max Mliller
appears to think that the latter group is called the Naksha
tras of Yama because Yama presides over the last of them.J
But the explanation appears to me to be quite unsatisfactory; for on the same principle the first group should have been called the Nakshatras of Indr&gni, the presiding
deities of VishakM, the last in that group. I am, there

fore, disposed to think that tlie principle of division in this case Is the same as that followed in the case o the Devayana
and the Pitriyana discussed before. We have the express
authority of the Shatapatha Brahmana stating that the sun was to be considered as moving amongst and protecting the Devas, when he turned to the north, in the three seasons of spring, summer and rains. In other words the hemisphere to the north of the equator was supposed to be consecrated to the Devas and the southern one to the Pitris. Now, the sun moved amongst the Devas when he was in the northern
hemisphere. The Devas, therefore, must have their abode in that hemisphere, and as the Nakshatras are said to be the houses of the Devas, all the Nakshatras in the northern hemisphere, from the vernal to the autumnal equinox, would
naturally be called the Nakshatras of the Devas. Now the
southern hemisphere was assigned to the Pitris; but I have already quoted a passage from the Rigveda which states that it was the path of the god of death. In Rig. x. 14, 1,
Yama is spoken of as the king of Pitris, and in verse 7 o the same hymn the deceased is told to go to the pitri-loka, where he would meet the god Yama. In the Vajasaneyi Sanhita 19, 45, salutation is made to the world of Pitris in
the kingdom of Yama. There are many other passages of
similar import in the Sanhitas,* and from all these it would
be quite clear that the Pitriyana or Pitri-loka was also called the kingdom of Yama. The Nakshatras in the southern
hemisphere, therefore, came to be designated as the Nak
shatras of Yama in opposition to the Nakshatras of th^
Devas, thus dividing the whole circle of stars in two equal
groups. This also explains why Yama is made to preside
* Cf.Taitt. San. vik.3, 14. 3jiR
[ I Also see A that. Ved, xviii, 4.



IIL] THE KRITTIKAS. 43
over the Apa-Bharanis. It was at tlis Apa-Bharanis that tlie zodiac was divided, the Krittikas going over into the
Devas* and the Apa-Bharanis turning* down into- the Yama's
portion of the celestial hemisphere.* The Taittiriya Brahmana further states that the Nakshatras of the De^as move towards the south while the Nakshatras of Yama move towards the north. The words dakskina (south) and wttara (north) are in the instrumental case, and doubts have been,
entertained as to their exact meaning. But if we accept the statement in the Shatapatha Brahman a about the abode of
the Devas, no other meaning is possible 'except that the Nakshatras of the Devas were counted from the vernal to the autumnal equinox:, that is, to the point where the south
(southern hemisphere) begins, and conversely in the ease of the Nakshatras. of Yama. I may here mention that the movements of both the groups are described in the Brahmana
in the present tense (pari-yanti), and that we may, therefore, suppose the-m to be recorded from actual observation. If
this explanation of the division of the Nakshatras. into the
Nakshatras of gods and those of Yama is correct and I
think it is it at once fixes the position of the Krittikas at
the beginning of the Devay&na or the vernal equinox at the time when these Vedic works were compiled,.
There is another and still more important passage in the*
Taittiriya Sanhita which supplies further confirmatory evidence on the same point. In the Taittiriya Sanhita vii. 4, &,
* May not Apa-Bharanis have heen so named from this circum
stance ? Bharam appears to be an older name, changed afterwards into Apa-Bharani, in the same man-ner, Mula into Mula-barham, and

clearly showing that the former was then understood to
mean the fall-moon night. Both the passages are similar
in other respects.
Fortunately for us Sayanacharya is not our only guide in the interpretation of these important passages. It is
probably the only passage (the two passages being similar I treat them as one) in the Vedas where the commencement
of the annual satra is given and from the ritualistic point
of view it has formed the subject of a learned discussion? amongst the Mimansakas. Jaimini in his Mimans&-darshana
Chap. vi. Sect. 5 has devoted an Adhikarana (10th) to the
interpretation of this passage, and the subject has been thoroughly discussed by Shabara, Rumania, Parthasarathi,
Khandadeva and other writers on Mimansa. We have thus
a continuous tradition about the meaning of this passage
current amongst the Indian divines a tradition based not
upon mere authority, but on the logically solid; rules of
exegetics propounded in the work of Jaimini. I shall first
give a literal translation of the passage from the Taittirfya
ISanhita and then discuss its interpretation as bearing on, the
present question.
"Those who are about to consecrate themselves for the
year (sacrifice) should do so on the Ekdshtaka (day). The

that sacrifice on the Ekashtaka, sacrifice to the distressed
( period ) o the year. It is the season .( dual) whose name
comes last. Those, that sacrifice on the Ekashtaka, sacrifice to the reversed* ( period ) of the year. It is the season (dual) whose name conies last. They should consecrate
themselves for the sacrifice on the Phalguni full moon.
The Phalgnni full- moon is the mouth of the year. They
sacrifice (by) beginning the year from the very mouth. It
has only one fault, viz., that the Vishuvan [i. e>, the equator
or the central day] falls in the .rains. They should conse,
crate themselves for the sacrifice on the Chitrci, full-moon. The Chi bra full-moon is the mouth of the year. They
sacrifice (by) beginning the year from the very mouth. It has no fault whatsoever. They should consecrate themselves for the sacrifice four days before the full-moon.
Their Kraya [i. e>, bhe purchase of soma.] falls on the Ekash~ taka. Thereby they do not render the Ekashtaka void
[i.e., of no consequence]. Their Sutya [i.e., the extraction of soma juice] falls in the first [i.e., the bright] half (of the
month). Their months [i'.e., the monthly sacrifices] fall in the first half. They rise [i.e., finish their sacrifice] in the
first half. On their rising, herbs and plants rise after them.
After them rises the good fame that these sacrificers have
prospered. Thereon all prosper."
Here in the beginning we are told that the Ekashtaka is
the day to commence the Satra, which lasts for one year. But the word Ekashtaka is used to denote the eighth day of the latter (dark) half of the four months of Hemantaand Shishira seasons, f and sometimes it means the eighth day of the
* According to the TandyaBrahmana"hroken' J or "destroyed." t Cf. Ashv. Gri. Sutra iu 4/1;

TEE ORION. [CHAPTER
flark half of each of the twelve months of the year.* The statement iu the following sentences that this lilkashtaka
is liable to the objection of occurring in the cold or the
last season does, however, at once narrow the field of our choice. It must be further borne in mind that the
Ek&shtaka, here spoken of, is the wife of the year, and is contrasted with the Phalguni and Chitra full-moons; while
tradition in the time of Jaimiui and Apastamba interpreted it to mean the 8th day of the dark half of Magha. All writers on Mimansa therefore take this Ekashtaka to mean the 8th day of the dark half of Magiia. As the Ekashtaka
is the wife of the yearf and as the god of the year is said
to reside with her on that night, those that commence their
sacrifice on the Ekashtaka may practically be supposed to
commence it at the beginning of the year which resides there. In other words the Ekashtaka is thus a constructive
beginning of the year, and therefore the yearly sacrifice may be commenced ou that day* Bat the passage now
proceeds to point out the objections to the commencing of the sacrifice on the Ekashtaka day. The 8th day of
JSagha falls during the distressed period of the year, that is* according to Shabara and other commentators the period
Of. Taitdya Br&hmaua x. 3, 11. his commentary on fan. Br. v. 9, observes that Ekasktakfi

when people are distressed by cold.* The word in the text is
Aria which literally means 'distressed,' but Sayana takes it to denote the end or destruction of the year, implying thereby
that the old year is then brought to an end and that the
consecration for the yearly satra, which must be made before
the beginning of the new year, or, in other words, not after
the previous year is ended or destroyed, cannot be made at
this time. Though Shabara and Sayana thus give different
interpretations of drta, practically both agree in holding that in those days the old year ended before the eighth
day of the dark half of Magh ; for Shabara distinctly states
that the word '' reversed " used further on means " reversed
on account of the change of ayana""\ Sacrificing during. the distressed period of the year is thus the first objection
to commencing the satra on the Ekashtak day. The
second objection is that it is the last season, that is, though
you may be said to sacrifice to the constructive beginning
of the year, yet as far as the seasons are concerned you
sacrifice in the last of them. The word for season, ritu, has been used in the text in the dual number and it might be
urged that it denotes two seasons. A reference to the
Taittiriya Sanhita iv. 4-11, 1. will, however, show that the word ritu is there used in dual, probably because each
season comprises two months, just as "scissors" is

To get over this threefold objection an alternative next proposed. The Phalguni full-moon day was
to be the first day of the year. If you commence
sacrifice on that day, you avoid the three objections pre
viously noted and still secure your object of sacrificing at
the beginning or the mouth of the year. But even course is not faultless -, because if you commence on the Phalguni full-moon the middle or the central day of
falls in the rainy season, which again is not a desirable The first twelve days of a satra are taken up in
cration and twelve more in upasacte after which the satra sacrifices commence. So the middle day of tlic
falls after six months and twenty-four days from the Phal

the month of Ashvina."^ Now if we suppose solstice or the beginning of the cold season to on the
Magha full-moon, the summer solstice, or the of tbi*
summer and the beginning of the rainy sess0ay fell a little after the full-moon in Shravana. The drapada and Ashvina therefore represented the
in those days, and the occurrence of the VishAfia in

the next alternative it is, therefore, suggested the
consecration should take place on the Chitrfr full-moon, and
this, course is said to be open to no objection

and also the next previous to the Ekashtaka, which is the wife of the year and which falls in the cold season, in the
last season, i. e., Shishira [or when water is not delightful!
and after the sun has passed through the winter solstice. It must also be remembered that the Phalguni and the
.Chitra full-moon are to be excluded, Jaimini, therefore, concludes that this full-moon cannot be any other than the
one falling in the month of Magha, and his conclusion
been adopted by all the Mimansakas. We can now understand why Laugakshi, quoted by Somakara, stales "they sacrifice to the year four days before the full-moon
in Magha. "*
If Jaimini's interpretation of this passage is correct, we may, so far as our present inquiry is concerned, deduce the following conclusions from it : ( 1 ) That in the days of
the Taittiriya Sanhitft the winter solstice occurred before
the eighth day of the dark half of Magha, which again wast a month of the cold season. Whether the solstitial day fell
on the Magha full-moon is not so certain, though it mmj be taken as fairly implied. For the Ekashtakl was abandoned because it occurred in the "reversed" period of the year,
and it is quite natural to suppose that the priests in choosing a second day would try to remove as many of
the objections to the Ekashtaka as they could. In other
words, they would not select a day In the "reversed " period
of the year, nor one in the last season. The fact that a day
before the fall-moon in Magha was selected is, therefore, a
clear indication of the solstice occurring on that day, white
their anxiety to utilise the EkashtaM fully accounts for the
selection of the fourth in preference to any other day before
the full-moon. I may also remark that throughout the



54 THE ORION. [CHAPTER ty
h
whole passage the intention of sacrificing at the beginning 1
(real, constructive, or traditional) of the year is quite clear. > The full-moon in Magha must, therefore, have been one of ^
such beginnings, (2) That the year then commenced with *'/ the winter solstice. (3) That as there cannot be three real 1
beginnings of the year at an interval of one month each, the ,V
passage must be understood as recording a tradition aboub r
the Chitra full-moon and the Phalguui full-moon being onco |f
considered as the first days of the year. (4) That Vishnvun
had lost its primary meaning and that it fell in the rainy
season if the sacrifice was commenced on the Phalguni
full-moon.
The passage thus supplies not only confirmatory, but direct evidence of the coincidence of the Krittikas with the
vernal equinox in the days of the Taittiriya Sanhitu. For, if the winter solstice fell on the full-mocn day in Maghd, then the summer solstice, where the moon must then bo . must coincide with the asterism of Magha, and counting seven Nakshatras backwards We get the vernal equinox in
the Krittikas. Independently of the Vedanga Jyotisha we ttns have four different statements in the Taittiriya Sanhitft
and Briliinana clearly showing that the vernal equinox was
thenia fete Krittikas": firstly, the lists of tbe Nakshatras
and their 'presiding deities, given in the Taittiriya SanhitS.
and Brttmana, all beginning with the Krittikas ; secondly,
an express statement in the Taittiriya Brahraana that the Krittikas are the mouth of the Nakshatras ; thirdly? a statement that the Krittikas are the first of the Ddva itilc
shatras, thai is, as I have shown before, the Nakehakw in
the northern hemisphere abov& the vernal eqtuttog; j and
fourthly, the passage in the Taittiriya 'Sajabitfc above discussed, which exprmif abates that th Iriatar r solstice fell



III.] THE KEITT1KKS. 55
in the month of MagM. The vernal equinox is referred to
the Krittikas directly or indirectly in all these passages and I do not think that any more confirmatory evidence
from, the Vedic works is required to establish the proposition \ thatuihe Krittikas coincided with the vernal, equinox, when '
the Taittiriya Sanhitft was compiled. I As an additional
proof I may, however, mention the fact, that Pitris are said to be the presiding deities of Magh& in the
Taittiriya Sanhita iv. 4. 10. ]. With the Krittikas in the
vernal equinox Magha iS at the summer solstice and as the Dakshinayana or the ay ana of the Pitris commencedat this point, the asterism which happened to be there at
that time was naturally assigned to the Pitris. The position of all the other, cardinal points of the ecliptic can be thus
shown to be consistent with the position of the vernal
equinox in the Krittikas.
Supposing the Krittikas to denote the asterism of that
rxarne this gives us, according bo Prof. Whitney's* calcula
tion, 2350 B. C. as the probable time for the compilation of the TaittirJya Sanhita. Some scholars unwilling to carry
t}ie antiquity of the work to such a rempte period, have
urged, without assigning any special reason, that by Krittikas we must here understand the beginning of the zodiacal
portion of that name. Now as the position, of th^ asterism. of the Krittikas in its zodiacal portion is 10 50' from tho
beginning^ these scholars would place the vernal equinox about 11 behind the asterism of the Krittikas and thus
reduce the antiquity of the Sanhitfr nearly by 1 1 X 72=792

years or to about 1426 B. 0.* I have briefly stated before
my reasons for discarding this supposition and holding that
the names of the Nakshatras in the early Vedic days must *" be taken to denote the asterisms known by such names. If
Indian priests are to be supposed incapable of making any accurate observations of solstitial points in J 200 B. C.,f it
is to my mind utterly inconsistent and illogical to hold that
the forefathers of these priests, when they assigned the
vernal equinox to the Krittikas, understood the word to
mean not the asterism but the imaginary beginning of the zodiacal portion of that name. / I cannot also understand
why scholars should hesitate to assign the Vedic works to
the same period of antiquity which they allow to the Chinese and the Egyptians.f Bufc it is needless here to euter into
this, controversy. For if I once succeed in showing, as I
hope to do. that there is sufficient internal evidence in the
Vedic literature itself of a still remoter antiquity, all theories,
conjectures, and guesses, which have the effect of unduly
reducing the antiquity of the Vedic works and also of throwing discredit upon the claims of the Indians to the
c-riginof the Nakshatra system, will require no refutation.)
Bentley, however, takes his stand on a different ground.

He suggests that the word VishdkM, like Vidala,* may
mean "possessed of two branches/' and that these two branches may have been caused by the equinoctial colure
bisecting the zodiacal portion of the Vishakhas. Now the
equinoctial colure passing through the beginning of the divisional Krittikas naturally bisects the zodiacal portion of
VishakM. Bentley, therefore, concludes, without any more
proof than this etymological conjecture, that this was the position of the colure when Vishakha received its name.
This is no doubt an ingenious hypothesis. But there is not only no evidence in the Yedic works to support such
etymological speculation, but it may be easily shown to be inconsistent with the position of the winter solstice in
the days of the Taittiriya Sanhita'.
I have already stated that from the passage of the Tait
tiriya/ Sanhita just quoted we may fairly infer that the
winter solstice occurred in those days on the full moon in
M&gha. According to the Vedanga Jyotisha it fell a fortnight earlier, that is, on the first day of the bright half o Mgha. It is roughly estimated that the equinox must
recede about two divisional Nakshatras, i.e. 26 40', to make the seasons fall back by one month. Between the times of
the Taittiriya Sanhita and the Vedanga Jyotisha the equinox,
must accordingly recede 13 20' or nearly 14. Now the
position of the equinox as given in the Vedanga Jyotisha is
10 of Bharani From this to the beginning of the divi
sional Krittikas, the distance is only 8 20', while if we mea
sure it from the asterism of Krittika it is 3 20'+ 1 50' = 1 4 10 r
. Therefore during the period that lapsed between the

&& THE ORION* [CHAPTEE
Taittiriya' Sanhita and the V-edaaaga Jyotisha the equinox^ according to JBentley, receded only 3 20' ; while if we understand the Kritfcik&s to denote the asterism of that
name, it .gives as a precession of 14 10'. Now as the winter
solstice fell a fortnight later in the days of the Sanhita we
must accept the latter precession of 14, which alone
corresponds with that interval of time (i. e. a fortnight) and assume that the vernal equinox then coincided with the
asterism of Krittika, a conclusion the probability of which
has already bean -established on other grounds. Bep.tley*$
speculation must, therefore, be rejected, unless we ar prepared to allow his guess about the primary meaning of Visbakba to prevail against reasonable conclusions based
upon a passage from the Taittiriya Sanhitft. ,

''
But even admitting Bentley's speculation about the meaning of Vishakha, we may fairly question the soundness of the conclusion drawn therefrom. For what ground is there for holding that the two divisions of Vishakha must
be mathematically equal in every respect ? The word dala in v-idala may be so understood ; but dala and shdkkd are
not similar in this respect. Bentley's error., therefore, consists not in supposing that tha colure may have cut the
divisional Vishakhas, but in inferring therefrom that it must have bisected it. The whole ecliptic was divided
into 27 Nakshatras, and 13 could only be comprised in each hemisphere. YishakM, the 14th ISTakshatra from
the Krittik&s, may have been thus considered, by simply
counting the number of the Nakshatras, as lying partly in the region of the Devas and partly in that of the Pitris.*
to satisfy a tamely etymological speculation evidence whatsoever* Speaking more

For though we might hold that the Vedi observers were
not provided with means to fix imaginary points in the heavens and ta refer to these points the motions oi the
heavenly bodies as- astronomers do at present^ yet it does
not imply that they were unaware oi the approximate dis
tances between, the various asterisms selected by them* In?

conjecture about the primary meaning of Vishakhi does not necessarily imply that, the equinoctial colure bisected the divisional VishakMs in those days *r and when the

accurately if the vernal equinox, coincided with the- asterism of the
Krittik&s, the equinoctial colure falls out of the divisional Vishakas
by 4, but ife is nearly 6 behind the asterism of Aniiradha. Of these two asterisms Yishaklui would therefore be nearer to the colure. But we might as well ask what ground there is for holding that the Nakshatra division* of the Zodiac, at the time when the vernal
equinox was in the Krittikas (supposing sueh divisions to have then existed), were the same as those which we-now use and which- com
mence with Revati. Bendey appears to have altogether overlooked this objection. I have already stated my view regarding the existence of the divisional Kakshatras in old times,, and I would reject

So far, wo have been going over the ground more or less traversed before by several scholars. But it may be asked if we have here reached the Ultima Thule of the Vedic
antiquity. Does the oldest hymn, the first utterance of the
Aryana mind, reach back thus far and no further ? Was it
such a hymn that the Brahma-vadins of old and Panini several
centuries before Christ believed and declared as c< seen"?
. In what follows, I propose to bring together such evidence from the Vedic works as would enable us to deal with these
questions. I have already drawn attention to the fact that the Ohitra and the Phalguni full-moon are mentioned as the
mouths or the beginnings of the year in the passage from the Taittiriya Sanhita last quoted and discussed. In the next chapter I shall endeavour to show how these state
ments are to be interpreted, how far they are corroborated by other evidence and what conclusions we may deduce
therefrom.

THE passage from the Taittiriya Sanhita quoted in the last chapter states that the Chitra and Phalguni full-moons were the beginnings of the year, which then commenced with the winter solstice in the month of Mlgha. The words used
in the original are Chitrd-piirna-'mdsa and Phalgunt-purna, -mdsa and these must be understood to denote, not the Ohaitra and the PMlguna months, whether sidereal and
synodical, as Prof. Weber seems to have, in one case, supposed., but the full-moon days in each of these months. This is evident from the fact that these have been recommended as alternative times for the commencement of the satra in opposition to the Ek&shtak& day. In the case of the Phalguni-pirna-rndsa we are further told that Yishuv&n

62 THE ORION. [CHAPTER
is impossible to suppose that Vishuvan can be counted from a month. The whole context, therefore, shows that it is a discussion as to the particular day best suited to commence
the yearly sacrifice, and that Chitrd-purna~mdsa and Phalguni-punia-mdsa must mean the days when the moon is full near the asterisms of Chitra and Phalguui. In the Tanclya
Brahmaria* Phalguni-yurna-rndsa is rendered by Phdlguni and Jairnini has paraphrased Chitr&-pdrna-mdsa by CJudtoi and Phalguni and Chaitri, according to Panini (iv. 2. 3)., are

r!ya Sanhita the winter solstice, as shown in the last
chapter, fell in the month of Magha ; and Magha and
Phalguna were therefore comprised in Shishira, and Chaitra and Vaishakha in Vasanta. But in order that S&yanVs
explanation might be correct Phalguna must fall in the Vasatita season which, as a matter of fact, it did not. In, his
commentary on the Baudh&yana Sutras"34" and also in the
Kalamadhavat S yana tries to get over this difficulty by proposing a double Vasanta lunar and, solar, the lunar ta include the months of Phalguna and Chaitra, and the solar
those of Chaitra and Vaishakha, quoting amongst others, Rig. x., 85, 18, as an authority to show that the seasons
were regulated by the mo.on. The authorities, however, are not explicit and therefore sufficient to maintain the two-fold character of the seasons ; nor do I see the necessity of the
two-fold character. It is true that the months in the: calendar were all lunar, but the concurrence of the lunar
and the solar year was always secured by inserting an inter-, calary month whenever necessary. Under such a system
lunar seasons can have no permanent place. Now and then
lunar months ceased, as they now do, to correspond with the
seasons they represented, but this was at once set aright by the introduction of an intercalary month. If we, therefore,

64 THE ORION. [CHAPTER
exclude the correction due to the precession of the equi~ noxes, which was too minute to be noticed till after hundreds of years, there was thus no reason why the lunar seasons
should come to be regarded as a permanent institution. But even accepting Sayana's two-fold character of the seasons, it can be easily shewn that it does not support his conclu
sions. A lunar year is shorter than a solar year by 11
days. If the solar Vasanta, therefore, commences on the 3 st day of the lunar Chaitra month this year, it will commence on the 12th day of Chaitra (lunar) next year and 11 days later still in the third year when by the introduction of an intercalary month the commencement of Vasanta will be again brought back to the 1st day of Chaitra. The twofold character of the seasons may thus delay the beginning of Vasanta to Vaishakha (lunar), but the season cannot be
accelerated and brought back to Phalguna. It is true that
in the days of Sayana (14th century) Vasanta commenced, as it does now, in the month of Phalguna; but it was so because the winter solstice had receded by over full one
month by that time. Sayana does not appear to have fully realised the reason of this change and combining the occurrence of Vasanta in Phalguna in his time with the occurrence
of the same season, in Chaifcra in the days of the Taitciriya
Sanhita and other works he attempted to reconcile the difference on the theory of the two-fold character of the seasons. But we can now better understand the change as due
ty* the precession of the equinoxes, and must, in consequence,
reject Sayana's explanation as unsatisfactory.
The only other authority I can find ' for supposing that Phalguna was a Vasanta month is the statement in Shu
shruta's medical work, that " Phalguna and Chaitra make Vasanfca." But on a closer examination of the



IV.] AGRAHAFANA. 65
wherein this sentence occurs, it will be found to bear on its face the marks of later insertion. There are two conse
cutive paragraphs in Shushruta, each enumerating and describing the seasons of the year. The first states that
" There the twelve months, beginning with Magha, make six seasons, comprising two months each. They are Shi
shira, &c Of these Tapa and Tapasya make Shishira " and so on until all the six seasons in their usual order, the
ay anas, the year and the lustrum are described; and at the
end we have " this is called the wheel of time by some." *
The second paragraph then begins with the words " But here" and continues to state "But here the six seasons are,
Varsha, Sharad, Hemanta, Vasanta, Grishma and Pravrish,"
thus altogether dropping Shishira and dividing the rainy period into two seasons Varsha and Pravrish, The paragraph then proceeds to assign the months to the seasons as follows : "Bhadrapada and Ashvina is Varsha, Kartika and
Margashirsha is Sharad, Pausha and Magha is Hemanta, and Phalgana and Chaitra is Vasanta;" and so on until
all the months are assigned to their respective seasons. The second paragraph, however, makes no mention of the ayanas, the year, or the lustrum. It is therefore evident
* See Shushruta, Sutrasthana Adhyaya 6. The two consecutive paragraphs here referred to are :



66 THE ORION. [CHAPTER
that the writer of the second paragraph, whosoever he may be> wished to note that the seasons and their corresponding months mentioned in the first paragraph had ceased to represent the actual state of things in the writer's time
and province, and not thinking it desirable or possible to expunge or correct the old paragraph, he added immediately after it a second paragraph describing the seasons as he
saw them. The words *' but here " at its beginning, the
assignment of four months to the rainy season, but under two different names of Pravrish and VarsM, to keep up the old number of the seasons* and the absence of any reference to the ayanas, the year and the lustrum described in the
praTious paragraph all point to the conclusion that the Second paragraph is of later origin and inserted with a view only to note the changes in the occurrence of events de
scribed in the paragraph next preceding it. It might be contended that the second paragraph is that of Shushruta, who notices the old order of things ia the first. But I need
not go into that question here. For in either case it is
plain that the passage wherein Phalguna and Chaitra are argued to Vasanta is the production of a later writer, whohe may be, whether Shushruta or any one else, and present inquiry is concerned we cannot tak&
'as an authority for holding that PhMguna was in the days of the Taittiriya Sanhita. I ma^

the paragraph did not exist in Vagbhata's' time or that he
did not regard it as genuine. There is thus no reliable authority, that I am aware of, for
holding that Phalguna, in the days of the Taittinya Sanhitft, was a Vasanta month, and Sayana's explanation does not in consequence hold good at least in this case* The explanation is further inconsistent with the fact that in several Brahmanas and Sfttras the full-moon night in the
month of Phalguna has been pronounced to be the first
night of the year. The Shatapatha Brahmana (vi. 2. 2. 18) says "the Phalgunl full -moon is the first night of the year.
1'
The Taittiriya (i. 1, 2, 8) and the S&nkhyayana (iv. 4 and v. 1 )
* Brahmanas contain similar passages, while the
Gopatha Brahmana (i. 1 &) after stating that the Uttar
and the Pttrva Ph&Iguni are respectively the beginning and the end of the year, adds e< just as the two ends of a thing meet so these two termini of the year meet together."f I
have already quoted a passage from the Tandya Brahmana to the same effect. The Sutra^writers, though not so explicit, do however distinctly state that the annual sacrifices "should be commenced either on the Chaitrl or the
Ph&lguni full-moon night, "$ thus clearly indicating that these were regarded as the beginnings of the year. If

these passages mean anything, we must hold that the Ph3lgutn full-moon night was once considered to be actually the
first night of the year, or to put it in a modern" form the new
yew's night. We cannot assign this position to it by simply assuming, as Sayana has done, that the night occurred during the two months of Vasanta. Sayana it
appears, was aware of this objection and so in commenting on the passage from the Taittiriya Sanhita, quoted in the
last chapter, he attempts to explain the position of the Phalguni night by reference to the above mentioned passages
in the Br&hmanas, while with respect to tlie Chaitri, he
Cjuietly observes that " this too is the mouth of the year as il during the season of Vasauta." * But an explana
admittedly fails in one case must fail in the other,
for the Chitrft and the Plialguni nights are described to
gather, in the mme passage and in the same words, as the
beginnings of the year.
It will be clear from the above, first, that the theory of
tie lunar seasons, started by Sayana to account for the posi
tion assigned to the Phalguni night in the Vedic works, cannot ha?e a permanent place in the Vedic calendar ;
even accepting the theory, the beginning of the fasanta might be put off to the month of (lunar) YmisMkia, font could not be brought back to any day in
PhftlgBBa ; and thirdly, the express texts in the Brahmanas
declaring the Phalguni full-moon to be the new-year's

with respect to the Phalguni night, how are we to interpret the several passages in the Sanhita and the
Brahnaanas given above? We cannot suppose that the Phalguni full-moon commenced the year at the vernal equinox ; for then we shall have to place the vernal equinox
in Uttara Bhadrapada, which to render possible in the preKrittika period we must go back to something like 20,000 B. C. The only other alternative is to make the full-moon eommence the year, at the winter solstice, and from the fact that the Maghi, the Phalguni and the Chaitri full-moons
are mentioned together in the same passage of the Taittiriya Sanhita, and for the same purpose, I conclude that this is
the real meaning of the passage in the Taittiriya Sanhita and those in the Brahrnanas. It is the most natural and
reasonable interpretation of the passage and I find that
Bhaskara Bhatta, who is older than Sayana, fully adopts this view in his Bhashya on the Taittiriya Sanhita. "* I have however devoted so much space to the discussion of Saya

na's explanation as the "high authority of that scholar is likely to mislead us in the interpretation of the passage. The Bhashya of Bhaskara Bhatta fully shews that Sayana
is not here following- any older tradition and the reasons
given, by him for explaining the position assigned to the Phalgtmi full-moon in the Vedic works are mere conjectures and guesses of his own. I admit that even the guesses of
a scholar like Sstyana deserve consideration. But when on
a closer examination we find that they are not supported by
any eld traditions and are besides objectionable on various
other grounds, I think we are bound to reject them. A.B observed by Bhaskara Bhatta the passage in the Taittirfya
S&tbit& must, therefore, be understood as referring to an older year beginning, and we must hold that the fall-moon
in PMlguna did as a matter of fact once commence the year at the winter solstice. I know that this view has been
regarded as improbable by some scholars, on the sole
ground that it would, if substantiated, enhance the antiquity of the Vedic works by about 2000 years more Iban what these scholars are willing to assign to them ;

was in 'the Krittikas. I think the pres-ent Brahmans are
worse off in this respect, inasmuch as. they have not even
the liberty, which the passage in the Taittiriya Sanhita
accorded, though hesitatingly, to the old priests, of choosing either the old or the new calendar. To use the words of
Professor Max Miiller we must in s-uch cases, therefore, u keep
our preconceived notions of what people call primitive
humanity in abeyance for a time.," * and form our judgment of antiquity, as we do of other facts, solely upon evidence.
We have seen in th>e last chapter that the evidence for placing the vernal equinox in the Krittikas consisted of (1)
the lists of the Nakshatras all beginning with the Krittikas,
(2) the winter solstice then falling in the month of Magha,
{3) the Nakshatra at the summer solstice being presided
over by the- pi'tris , and (4-,) the possibility of considering, as
Bentley suggested, the portion of the Nakshatra at tfhe autumnal equinox as divided by the equinoctial colure. In
short, if the year was supposed to have begun in the month
Magha, the position of the four cardinal points of the ecliptic as referred to the Nakshatras, was consistent with, and so indirectly established the truth of, such a supposition.
Let us see if we can produce similar1 evidence for establish
ing the hypothesis (for it is no better at present) that the year in the old Vedic days began, as stated in the Brahma
nas9 with the Phalguni full-moon, and that the winter solstice
occurred on ihat day. 'On a rough calculation the vernal
cquincix, must recede two divisional Nakshatras to make the seasons fall back by one month. If the winter solstice, therefore, occurred in the month of -Phalguna, one month in advance of Mfigha, in the old Vedic days, the vernal equinox must then have been in Mrigashiras or two Nak

shatras in Advance of the Krittikas. Taking tie data given
in the Vedanga Jyofeha as hia basis, the late Krishna SMstri Godbole has thus calculated* the position of the
four cardinal points of the ecliptic, when the winter solstice, as stated in the Brfihmanas, occurred on the full-moon day
in the month of Phalguna :
(1) The winter solstice in 3 20' of the divisional
tiara Bhadrapada; (2) The vernal equinox in the beginning of Ardra;
(3) The summer solstice in 10 of Uttara Phalguni ; and
(4) The autumnal equinox in the middle of Mula ;
or giving up the system of reckoning by the divisional portions of the Zodiac, we have, roughly speaking., the winter solstice quite near the asterism of Uttara Bhadrapada, the vernal equinox between the head and the right shoulder
of Orion or about 3 east of Mrigashiras, -the summer sol
stice at a distance of within 2 east of Uttara Phalguni,
and the autumnal equinox about 5 east of the asterism of
Hula. If we suppose the vernal equinox to coincide with
Mrigashiras, the three other cardinal points are brought nearer to the fixed asterisms, and this appears to bo tho
more probable position of the equinoxes and the solstices in those days. But without entering into these details, it will "be evident from this that when the winter solstice fell on
the Phalguni full-moon the vernal equinox must be very
near the asterism of Mrigashiras or two Nakshatras in
advance of the Krittikas. We have now to see what evidence there is in the Vedic works from which this old position of
the four principal points in the ecliptic may be established.

works, wliicli states that Mrigashiras, like the Krittikas was ever the mouth of the Nakshatras. But what is so
lost may still be discovered, in the words of Prof. Mas Miiller, 4 ' hidden in the secret drawers of language." Mrigashiras may not be specifically described as the first of the Naksha
tras ; but the word Agrahdyanl which Amarsinha (i. 3. 23),
gives as a synonym for Mrigashiras, and which supplies, according to Panini, a derivative word for the month of
Margashirsha tells the same tale. Agrah&yanl literally means
" commencing the year ;
" and the question is how did the Nakshatra come to be so called ? In explaining the forma
tion of this word all native lexicologists, begin by assuming that the full-moon in the month of Margashirsha was
the first night of the year, hence called Agrahdyani, and as this full -moon occurred in the month of Margashirsha the
montlWtself was called Agrahdyanika There is no gram
matical inconsistency so far. But when these lexicographers further tell us that the Nakshatra itself was called Agrahdyani, as Amarsinha has done, because the full-moon in the vicinity
of that Nakshatra commenced the year in old days,* one feels
that there is something wrong in this explanation. The ordinary course is to name the full-moon or any other day after the
Nakshatra, as Chaitrl, Pausham, Paushi, &c. (Pan, iv. 2, 3), while in the present case the order is reversed and the
Nakshatra, we are told, is named after the full -moan. It
is true that the lexicographers were, to a certain extent*
compelled to adopt such a course, as they could not other. wise explain why AgraMyani, a term usually denoting a full-moon night, should have been given as a synonym for

the Nakshatra of Mrigashiras by Amarslnha. But what
ever their motive, we have now to see if their explanations, as well as the statement in Amara, are correct. Turning
to Panini we find no authority for this converse process.
The word Agrahdyam occurs in Panini iv. 2, 22, which lays down the rule that the derivative names of months are
formed from Agrahdya?ii and Ashvaf-tha, by the addition
ofthak, * as a necessary termination; and this gives us the words Agrahdyanika and Ashvatthika for the months of
MargashSrsha and Ashvina. Now in the previous. 9&tr& (iv. 2.21) Panini states that the names of the months art derived from the names of the full-moon days that occur in those months. It appears, therefore, that he understood Agrahdyam to mean the full-moon and not the Nakshaira of Mrigashiras. The word Agrahdyanl occurs thrice in
Panini (iv. 2. 22 ; 3. 50 ; and v. 4. 110) and in all places
it denotes the full- moon day. It is not, however, clear whether Panini treated it as a word derived in the same
manner as Ohaitn, &c. If we, however, rely on analogy there is every reason to hold that Agrahdyam, like Kdrtiki and Phdlguni, may have been derived from Agrahdyana, and that this may originally be the name of the Nakshatra of
.Mrigashiras. This supposition derives support from the fact that if, like Aunarsinha, we take Agrahdyanl as synonymous with the Nakshatra of Mrigashiras and follow
the native grammarians in deriving this name of the Nakshatra from that of the full-moon, it is very difficult to
account for the initial long vowel in Agralidyani* All

iexicograsxhers derive the word form Agra and Sdyana combined in a Bahuvrihi compound and afterwards adding
the feminine termination ; thus Agra ,-f- hdi/ana-\-L But the feminine termination cannot be added without a pre

I is not a general feminine suffix, but is only used in special
cases. We cannot get this an by Panini iv., 2. 8, as Agrahdyaiia is not the name of a Nakshatra according to
Amarsinha. Various suggestions have, therefore, been made to account for the initial long vowel. Bhattoji suggests that we should obtain the long vowel by including
Agrakdyana in the Prajnadi list ( Pan. v. 4. 33 ) ; but in. the
(Janapatha^ the list is not said to be a c specimen list/"*6" nor is the word Agrah&yana specifically included in the list
there given. Boehblingk and Both in their dictionary obtain the long vowel by Pan. v. 4. 36 ; but here 36 may probably be a misprint for 38. Taranatha in his Vachaspatya obtains the long vowel by Panini v. 2. 1Q29 Vartika 1;

very fact that the word itself is so pronounced by Panini
in iv, 2. 22 ; but this gives us Agrakdyani as a ready made word at once, and Mukuta had to assign some reason why
the word should have been again included in the G-auradi list in Pan. iv. 1. 41. Mukuta's explanation is that P&nim*
thereby intends to show that the feminine termination in
Agrakdyani is not dropped in compounds. But Bhann

Dtkshita replies "by observing that tie Gauradi list was never intended for the purpose and that as regards the
accent we can get it otherwise. Bhanu Dikshita's own
explanation or that of his father Bhattoji also dispenses with the necessity of including the word in the G-aurftdi list as they obtain the feminine suffix i by Pan. iv. 1. 15; and so in -replying to Mukuta he observes at the end that the "inclusion of the word in the Gauradi list is questionable.1 ' Thus if we suppose Ainarsinha to be correct *md accept either Bhattoji' s or Mukuta* s derivation of AgrahAyam we shall have to hold that the word in question was either
wrongly included or subsequently inserted ia the GraBradi
list and that Panini, who knew the word, forgot to insert
it in the Prajnadi or the Jyotsn&di list. Both the explanations are again open to the objection that in this instance the Nakshatra is named after the fall- moon as against the usual method given by Panini in iv. 2. 3.
The whole of this difficulty, however, vanishes, if we give ?up the notion, that the full-mocn night in the month of
Margashirsha might have commenced the year at one time
\ and that the name of the Nakshatra as given by Amara ^tnust be derived from the name of the full-moon. There is
no express authority in the Vedic works to support such a theory and a closer examination of P&nini's sutras points
to the same conclusion. Months in the Hindu calendar
receive their names from the full -moon nights occurring in them ; and the characteristics of a month are the same as these of the full-moon night after which it is named, if the
full-moon night in Margashirsha was, therefore, eTer the
Hy&w'-year's night then the month itself would have come to
be properly called the-first: month of the year. III other

be called AgraJidyana. Boehtlingk and Koth do interpret the word AgraMyana in this way on the authority of Shabda-kalpa-druma and Taranatha has done the same probably
on the same authority, for none quotes any passage where
the word is so used. Now if Agrahdyana ever meant the mouth of Margashirsha, the word would also assume the
form Agrahdyana on the ground given above by Bhattoji ; *
and we shall have Agrahdyana as another name of the month of Margashirsha. The word occurs in the Gauradi list (Pan. iv. 1. 41), and therefore must be taken to have been known to Panini. What did he understand it to
mean ? There is strong ground to hold that he could not have understood it to mean the month of M4rgashirsha. For if we suppose that in Panini's times there were two
forms of the word in. this sense Agrahuyana and Agrahayanika he would have rather mentioned Agrahdyani in iv.
2. 23,-f along with Ghaitri, &c., which gives the double forms Chaitra and Ghaitrika and nob with AsJivattha in iv. 2. 22 f
as he has now done. We may, therefore, infer that Agra-* Jidyanika was the only sanctioned form of the word to denote the month of Margashirsha in Panini's time. This means that P&nini did not know of the theory which makes the year commence with the Margashirshi full-moon night or
the month of Margashirsha (AgraJidyana). Tf so, he could
* Bhanu Dikshita, in his commentary on Amara i. 4. 14. gives
Agrahdyana as a synonym for Margashirsha on the authority of Purushottama and obtains the initial long vowel by including the

t The sutras are : srriTfni1^^^^^ (iv. 2. 22 ) npTF*T W

78 THE ORION.
not have derived the word Agrahayani for the full-moon
night directly by taking it to be a Bahuvnhi compound.* The only other alternative is to derive it as we derive Chaitri and other similar words, and I think this is what Panini meant. For if he had been aware of any such difficulty in the formation of Agrahdyani, a word thrice used
by him, and especially in obtaining the initial long vowel as Bhattoji and others have felt by taking* it to be a Bahuvrihi compound, he would have naturally noticed it himself. I therefore conclude that Panini derived Agra
hdyant from Agrdh&yana, as the name of a Nakshatra.
In this case we can derive Agrahayani in a simple and easy
naanner. For by Panini iv. 2. 3, we get the initial long vowel, when derivative words are formed from the names of the Nakshatras to express time; we now want the feminine suffix i, and though this could have been obtained by
Pan. iv. 1. 15, yet, for accentual purposes, it may be considered as provided for by the inclusion of the word Agra
Myana-f in the Gauradi list in Pan. iv. 1. 41, We can thus
derive the word in the ordinary way, and unless we have strong grounds to maintain that it was really the full-moon mght and not the Nakshatra, which commenced the year, we*shall not be justified in accepting unusual derivations and explanations of these words. It is true that the word
Agrahdyana as denoting a Nakshatra is now lost and

a synonym for the Nakshatra of Miigashiras. But I shall presently show that Aniarasinha is not alone in misconceiv
ing the meaning of these old words. The theory that the
Margashirshi full-moon was the first night of the year, has / been the source of many other errors in later literature ;
but before examining these it was necessary to show how the theory has distorted the natural meaning and derivation of the very words on which it appears to have been based. As remarked above if there be any express or cogent autho
rity to support the theory we might connive at the etymo4
logical difficulties, bub if it be found that the theory is inconsistent with many other facts, or leads, as I shall pre
sently show, to absurd results, the etymological distortions would afford us an additional ground for rejecting it.
We shall now examine in detail the theory tha-t the f ull
jnoon night in Margashirsha was once the first night of the
year. So far as I am aware there is no express authority
for such an hypothesis except the statement in the Bhagavad
Grita (x. 35) where Krishna tells Arjuna that he, Krishna,
ia " Margashirsha of the months (and), Vasanta of the seasons. 1' Anandagiri in his gloss on Shankara's Bhashya
upon the GIt, observes that Margashirsha is here specially selected because it is a month of plenty. But the reason
does not appear to be either sufficient or satisfactory ; for
the next sentence, and in fact the whole context, shows that Margashirsha was here intended to be the first of the months. The principal commentators on the Git& are too
philosophical to notice this point, but in a commentary written by Siirya Pandit, an astronomer, entitled the
Paramrtha-prap&, I find that he explains the statement on the ground that Margashirsha was otherwise called
Agrahdyanika, and th latter word denotes that the. full



THE ORION. [CHAPTlER
BKX>B night in this month was the first night of the year.*
If we accept this explanation, and no other plausible one is
iorftmmiBg, it appears that this statement in the Bhagavadwas based on an etymological misconception of the
among of the term Agrah&yani'ka ; and later writers like
lia and Yagbhata,t simply followed the Gita in
the same position to the month of Margashirsha. We may, therefore, treat all these statements as coming from
oae source and representing a certain period of the Sanskrit literature, when native scholars first misconceived the
primary meaning of AgraMyanikct. I have already shown
properly understood, the etymology of the word gives
EteUazbora for such a misconception. Agrahdyanika is really
a ietiwmtive word and cannot therefore mean that the
denoted by it was the first in the year just as
Jjeehtiia does not mean the eldest month. But it appears

sidered to be sound etymological grounds that tbe montt and not the Nakshatra was the commencement of the year.
Once started and embodied in the Gita, the theory gained
an easy and rapid currency amongst native scholars, all of
whom naturally felt bound to shape their views accordingly.
And not only literary scholars, but astronomers appear to have done the same. In old astronomical works the year commenced with the winter solstice atxl the first month of

commenced, with this solstice. If then the Marg;ash1nshi full-moon was said to be the first night of the year, an astronomer would naturally understand such statement to mean that the winter solstice fell on the full-moon, day of
Margashirsha. Now if we suppose that the Margashirshi fullmoon was thus the night of the winter solstice,, it would mean that the full moon on that day happened to be near the asterism of Mrigashiras. With the sun at the winter . solstice, the moon, to be full, must be near the summer solstice; and therefore the summer solstice must have then
coincided with the asterism of Mrigashiras. The verna-l
equinox is 90 behind the summer solstice; and if Mriga
shiras coincided with the latter, the vernal equinox would then be 90 behind the asterism of Mrigashiras. This is the only logical and mathematical conclusion possible, if we accept the theory that the full-moon night in MargasMrsha was the first night of the year at the winter solstice* And what does it mean ? It means a clear mathematical
absurdity to us, though older astronomers,, not realizing its
full effect, invented an explanation to account for- iL The
Surya Siddhanta (viii. 2. 9} gives 63 as the polar longitude
of Mrigashiras, counting from Revati. Now if the Yeroal

90 63=27 behind the asterism of Eevati ! * The Vedic
works, on the other hand, mention the "Krittikas as the first
of the Nakshatras, and the winter solstice is shewn to have
then occurred in the month of Magha. This means that the
vernal equinox must be placed at least 26 40', or nearly 27
in front of Revati. Now imagine the position of the Indian astronomer, who could neither reject the statement in the Vedic works, nor the one in the Bhaevad Gita. Both were
sacred and unquestionable tests, and it would be no wonder
if, to his great relief, he got over the difficulty by proposing a libration of the equinoxes, 27 on either side of Revati! The hypothesis is now given up by modern astronomers as
mathematically incorrect; but no reason has yet been as
signed why it found place in the Hindu astronomy. A theory may be erroneons, but even an erroneous theory cannot become prevalent without a good cause. It has been
suggested by Bentley and approved by Prof. Whitney t, that the limits of the libration might have been determined by the fact that the earliest recorded Hindn year had been made to begin when the sun entered the asterism of Krit
toka or 26 40' in front of Revati. Bnt this alone is not
enough to suggest the theory of libration. For, unless the Hindu astronomer had grounds to him conclusive and
* This may imply that the Surya Siddhanta was in existence at the time when the libration theory was started. I think it was. But it has been suggested that the libration theory might have been
subsequently inserted therein (see Whitney's Sur. Sid., p. 104). It
is not, however, necessary to make any supposition regarding the existence of the Surya Siddhanta at this time, as almost all other
Siddbantas give the same bkoga, viz., 63 for Mrigashiim See
Colebrooke's Essays, Yol ii., p. 325 (table).

IV.] AGKANATANA. 83
otherwise inexplicable for holding that the vernal equinox fell 27 on each side of Revati, lie would not have proposed
the libration of the equinoxes. So far as I know no such grounds have been yet discovered by modern scholars, and if
the explanation given above accounts for the theory in all
its details, I see no-reason why it should not be accepted as
a probable explanation. Perhaps, it may be asked, what grounds I have to suppose that the astronomers combined the two statements declaring that Magha and M&rgashirsha were both, each in its turn, the first months of the
year, and so obtained the theory of the libration of the
equinoxes. This is, however, not the place to go fully into
this discussion; for all that I am bound to prove, as far as
the present inquiry is concerned, is that if we accept the theory that the M&rgashirsha full-moon was ever the new
year's night, it leads us to an absurd conclusion, and this is evident from the above whether it does or does not give
the real explanation of the libration theory. I may, how
ever, remark that when we actually find Amarasinha first
stating (i, 4. 13) that " seasons comprise two months each beginning with Magha, and three such seasons make an
ayana?' and then in the very next verse enumerating the months commencing with. Margashirsha ; there is nothing
extraordinary in the snpposition that some Hindu astronomers might have 'similarly attempted to reconcile what were
then regarded as the two beginnings of the year, by placing the statements in juxtaposition and pushing them to their
logical conclusions. On the contrary, I should have been surprised if the Hindu astronomers had not done so.
Bufc, apart from the origin of the libration theory, I think
it is clear that, if we accept that the Margashir&ha full-moon
was ever a new-year's night, in the sense that the winlte*

might be; but what evidence is there that any nativs
scholars ever thought of it ? None that I know of. There are only two beginnings of the year known in ancient Hindu literature. I have shown that the winter solstice could not
have occurred on. the full-moon in Margashirsha , and by the same method we can prove the improbability of the
vernal equinox falling on that day. For if we suppose the Margashirsha full-moon to be the new-year's night, in the sense that the vernal equinox occurred on that date, we
must make the asterisin of Abhijit coincide with the vernal
equinox. This gives us about 20,000 years B. C. for the period when these positions could have been true. The author of the Bhagavata Parana appears to have had some
such theory in his mind when he paraphrased (xi. 16- 11)
the above quoted verse in the Gtta by " I am Margashlrsha
of the months, Abhijit of the Nakshatras," and the late Krishna Shastri Godbole took this statement for a record
of a real tradition ! This illustrates the danger of relying
on traditions in later books, without tracing them to their
source in the oldest works we possess.
We must therefore rise above these etymological spe
culations of the native scholars of what Prof- Max Muller
not have been called Agrahayavdlsa ? Bentley supposes that, this method was in force till 538 A. D. ; if so ? why should Pausha not
become Agrah&yanilsa instead of Margashirsha, inj 451 B. C. ? Bentley
J s unsupported speculation Doust, therefore, be rejected as
imaginary* It gives no reason why Margashirsha, the third of the several months which, according to his theory, would successive: ly begin the year from 1192 B. C. to 538 A. D., should alone have been called AgraMy arnica* and none whatever why the Nakshatra
should be called Agrahdyaw, contrary to the usual rule, according to which the word should denote the full-moon day.



86 THE ORION. [CHAPTER
once called the Renaissance period of the Sanskrit literature. It is these speculations that have given us the
libration theory and interrupted the tradition of Agrahdyana
coming down to us iritact. It is difficult to say how these
etymological speculations originated. Perhaps the word Agrahdyanika was in course of time corrupted by nonuser into Agrahdyana on the analogy of Chaitra and Cliai
trika, and such corruption gave rise to these speculations, or it might be that the year locally commenced with
Mirgashirsha in certain provinces, and attempts were made to find an authority for such custom in the etymological
meaning of the word Agrahdyanika. It appears to me more probable, however, that the old tradition about the Nak~ shatra gradually got connected with the month which was named after it as in the case of Kartika, whose first rank
amongst months is suggested by Prof. Whitney ffas due to the ancient position of the Krittikas as the first among the
lunar mansions.' 1 * This is very likely if, as shown below, the word Agrahdyani was ever used to denote both the Nakshatra and t-he full-moon. But whatever the origin j
the . speculation was there safe under the authority and
prestige of the Bbagavad GHtft, and Amarasinha, who appears to have been not wholly free from the influence of such the
ories, naturally put down Agrahdyani instead of Agrahdyana, as the name of the Mrigashiras, especially as the latter
word, Agrahdyana, was not expressly mentioned by Pmnu
Later lexicographers, who considered Amara and especially
the QM to be above error, attempted to reconcile Anmm's statement with the system of Panini by unusual derivations,
and astronomers appear to have vied with them in ! mathe^

nings of the year ! We must, therefore, set aside all these theories and go back to the purer times of Panini, to determine what was the real name of the Nakshatra. I have already shown that Panini knew the word Agrahdyana and also that he could not have understood it to mean the month
of Margashirsha. It is, therefore, evident that he used it as a derivative from Agrahdyana in the sense of time as
given in Panini iv. 2. 3. If so, he considered Agrahdyana to be a name of the Nakshatra of Mrigashiras. Amarsmha's Agrahdyani is, therefore, either an error or a feminine
adjective for the tdrd of Mrigashiras meaning exactly the
same thing as Agrahdyana: thus Agrahdyana = Agrahdyana (Pan. v. 4. 38), Agrahdyana-\-i (Pan. iv. 1. 15)= Agrahdyani* In support of this derivation, may be cited the fact that Mrigashiras was once considered to be a feminine word, Mukuta and Bhanu Dikshita t both quote, Bopalifca who gives the neuter and the feminine forms of Mrigashiras. Raman&tha in his Trikanda Vivaka, gives a quotation from Babhasa and another from a Smriti to the same effect.^ If,
the word Mrigashiras was thus ever used in the feminine
gender, the feminine adjective Agrahdyani might have
been used as a synonym for the same, not because it was the name of the full-moon, but because the asterism was spoken of in the feminine gender. This may account for

THE ORION. [CHAPTER
the fact why Amarasinha lays particular stress on this point.
For says he " Mrigashlrsham (is) Mrigashiras ; Agrahdytmi (is used) to denote the very some* ;
1} thus implying that ai
feminine word is nsed to denote what he supposed might be
regarded only in the neuter gender. This is, indeed, a plausible explanation. It not only absolves Amarasinha from,
the charge of having given a wrong, or at least a distorted, word, but makes him warn his readers not to misunderstand the word Agrahdyanl for the full-moon night -a mistake into which almost all his commentators have, however, unfor
tunately fallen. It may further explain why instead of the
Nakshatra, the full-moon day (both of which were on this theory denoted by the same word Agrahdyani) came to be
regarded as the firsl night of the year and so gave rise to later speculations. But the fact that Amarasinha mentions MUrgasMrsha first amongst the months shows that he was not altogether free from the influence of the speculative
theory ; and the explanation above stated must therefore be accepted with caution.
But whatever explanations we may adopt to defend Aniara, I think it will be plain from the above that, so far as
our purpose is concerned, we must reject the explanation dtibe commentators of Amara, who derive the name of the
HftkBhatra, as given by Amara, from Agrahdyani, the name of the foil-moon. After this we may either suppose Agra
hdyana or Agra/idyanl or Agrahdyani to be the name of the IJakshalra, for in every case the difference consists only in the form and gender and not in the derivation, or. the meaning of the word. Thus understood Agrahdyani or Agra
Jidyana both give us the same meaning, viz., that tke yvar was in Hi front of the Nakshatra of Mrigashiras ; or in other
* Thus :

words commenced .with it. If what I have said 'above is
enough to prove this, I do not care to insist on a particular
-form, whether masculine, feminine, or neuter, oiAgrahdyana which as an adjective is the basis of all such forms. With
this reservation, I may, I think, in what follows use the word Agrahdyana to denote the Nakshatra of Mrigashiras and as evidencing the circumstance that it was so called
because it was the first Nakshatra in the year.
Corresponding to the winter solstice in Phalguna, we thus have the asterism of Mrigashiras or Agrahdyana to commence the year from the vernal equinox, much after the same manner as the Krittikas were said to be the mouth of the Nakshatras when the winter solstice fell in the month of M%ha. The express statement in the Brahmanas that the PMlguni full-moon commenced the year from, as I have
previously shown, the winter solstice, is thus borne out by the tradition which we find treasured up in Agrahayani.
Now if the vernal equinox was near the asterism .of Mrigashiras the afutuinnal equinox would be in Mula. It has been
ingeniously suggested by Bentley that this name signifying
** root or origin" may have been given to the Nakshatra because it was once the first amongst the asterisms and he
Bias actually given a list of the Nakshatras beginning with Mula; bui he does not appear to have used it except to show that when one of the twenty-eight Nakshatras was dropped the divisional Jyeshtha and Mula both began from
the same fixed point in the heavens, a position which gives
him the vernal equinox in the beginning of the Zodiacal
portion of the Krittikas, I have already shown that we cannot suppose that the old Vedic priests made observations
of imaginary lines in the heavens, and Bentley's explanation

tlie Zodiac is not therefore satisfactory. Nor can I accept
Prof. Whitney's suggestion that Mula " may perhaps have been so named from its being considerably the lowest or farthest to the southward of the whole series of asterisma
and hence capable of being looked upon as the root of all
the asterisms. 1"* I should rather suggest that Mula was so
called because its acronycal rising marked the commencement of the year at the time when the vernal equinox was near Mrigashiras and the winter solstice fell on the Phal
guni full-moon. Agrakdyana setting with the sun in the
west and Mftla rising in the east then marked the beginning
of the year, and this position of Mula is likely to be especially I noised as the heliacal rising and setting of a star/ and so of ;*
Agrakdyana, is difficult to be accurately watched. The Jj!
etymological meaning of Mula may thus be said to supply ] a sort of corroborative evidence for placing the vernal
eqainox in Mrigashiras though, in absence of other "strong $> grounds, it is of no better valu than a similar conjecture of 5
Bentley about the name Vishakha, noticed in the last t *\
chapter,
'
,/
I have already mentioned before that the year was di- " vided into two ay anus, the northern and the southern, and f that though originally the northern ay ana indicated the passage of the sun to the north of the equator yet it afterwards came to indicate the passage of the sun from the winter to the summer solstice. I have also stated that after this
change was made all the attributes of the older ayanas
must have been gradually transferred to the new ones,
though the old division was concurrently kept up ; and
that the new ideas were formed solely with reference to the solstitial division of the year. Thus the Pitriyftna luring
* See his Surya Siddhanta, p. 194,



IV.] AGRAHAYANA. 91
which time tlie stm in older times went down the equator
must have come to be regarded, for some purposes at least, as commencing from the summer solstice. With the winter
solstice occurring on the PhalgunJ fail-moon day, we shall
have the summer solstice on the Bhadrapadi full-moon, so that the dark half of Bhadrapada was the first fortnight
in the Pitriyana, understood as commencing on the summer
solstice. It was thus pre-eminently the fortnight of the pitris or the manes ; and to this day, every Hindu celebrates the feast to the manes in this fortnight. As far as I know no reason has yet been advanced why the dark half of
Bhadrapada should be called the fortnight of the pitris (pitri-paJcslia) and why special feasts to the manes should
be ordained at this particular period of the year. With the
winter solstice in the asterism of TJttara Bhadrapada, that is when it occurred on the PhsUgunl full-moon, the matter
is simply and satisfactorily explained. For then the Dakshinayana or summer solstice commenced on the dark half
of Bhadrapada and this fortnight therefore naturally became the first fortnight in the ayana of the manes.*
And not only the Hindus but the Parsis celebrate their feast to the manes at the same time. The coincidence is
* This explanation implies that the feast to the manes became
permanently fixed at this time ; and there is nothing improbable in it. For as the Parsis hold similar feasts on corresponding days
we must suppose that these feasts became fixed long before the Parsis and the Indians separated. When the vernal equinox receded to the Krittikas the feasts still continued to be celebrated in the dark
half of Bhadrapada. But though the priests could not alter the days of these feasts, yet in assigning duties to the Nakshatras they re
^tgniaed the change by making pitris preside over Magha at tha summer solstice.



92 THEOEION. [CHAPTER
important inasmuch as we are here dealing with periods
of antiquity when the Indian, the Iranian, and the Hellenic Aryas must have lived together, and if our theory is correct it is sure to be corroborated by the customs, practices, and traditions of the other two sections of the Aryan race. I
shall in the next two chapters show that there is ample
independent evidence of this kind confirmatory of the theory
that Mrigashiras commenced the equinoctial year in those
early days. At present I shall only refer to the conclusions of Dr. Geiger as to the nature of what he calls the primitive or the oldest Avesta calendar. He takes madhyaryo which
literally means not * mid- winter/ but 'mid-year' as his
basis and concludes that in the primitive Avesta calendar M the year commenced with the summer solstice.* This is / just what we should expect. The Indian Aryans com- V menced their year from the winter solstice or the beginning [ of the Uttar&yana and the Iranians, who in such matters
always took a diametrically opposite view, naturally commented it with the summer solstice the beginning of the
Dakshin&yana, thus bringing the Sruma (or the winter* solstice) in the middle of the year. But the coincidence
does not stop here ; and in the light of the old Indian |
qalendar we are in a position to explain some difficult points in the primitive Avesta calendar. The Hindu pitri-paksha or the fortnight of the manes commenced with the summer solstice, while the Iranians celebrated their feasts to the
manes just at the same time. The first month in their calendar was called Fravashinam or the month of the manes,
according to the primitive calendar determined ,'lbjf

Dr. Geiger, this first month, when the feasts to tne mane a
were celebrated,* began with the summer solstice. Again, the fourth month of the Avesta calendar was Tishtryehe or the month of Tis try a, which has been identified with the star
Sirius. Counting with Bhadrapada in the summer solstice, the fourth month in the Hindu calendar would be Margashirsha or the month of Mrigashiras, which Nakshatra is
quite near Sirius. We can now also easily explain why Dathusho should have been dedicated to the Creator. Beginning with Fravashinam in the summer solstice, Dathusho begins exactly at the vernal equinox, and as marking the revival of nature it was properly dedicated to the Creator. Both again was partially correct when he imagined that Dathusho must have once commenced the year inasmuch as it was dedicated to the Creator Ahuramazda.
For from, the old Hindu calendar we see that the vernal
equinox was also a beginning of the year. In the primitive
Avesta calendar we can thus discover the traces of the year, beginning with the vernal equinox and also from the summer solstice (in opposition to the Hindu winter solstice) in BMdrapada, the month of the manes. These coinci
dences, especially about the month of the manes, cannot be
said to be merely accidental. The worshippers of Ahura

new year are called 'fFravardigan" days. "During these ten days the frohars (fravashi or fravarti ) the spiritual representatives of the deceased are believed to come to the houses" of men on the
earth. See Dr. Hang's Essays on the Parsis, p. 225 note. At present the Hindu feasts extend over the whole of the fortnight. We, however, find an alternative period recorded in the Nirnaya Sindhu, which states that the feasts may extend over a fortnight, ten days 0r five days !

changed the commencement of tho year from .th
winter to the summer solstice, but as observed by "Kotli cf a sacred and solemn feast conld not be removed from its
place in the year/** and this affords therefore a comparatively
reliable ground to identify the Avesta and the Vedic year.
We find nothing in the Avesta to explain why the first
month of the year should have been devoted to the manes ;
but, as observed by Dr. Geiger in respect of the legend of Tama, the knowledge of it might in course of time have
been lost to the worshippers of Ahuramazda. We can, however, now easily explain it from the statement in the Vedic works that PMlgun! full-moon was once tie new year's night at the winter solstice. I know that such analogies
taken singly are of no great practical value, but when from & consideration of the Yedic literature, we arrive at results, which we then find so similar to those arrived at independ
ently by Zend scholars, we may certainly be led to believet that they are not merely accidental.

Sanhita,, which, states that the "Phalguni-purna-mdsa is the mouth of the year/' in the natural way suggested by the context and similar other passages in no less than five Brahmanas, to mean that the winter solstice occurred on the
Phalguni full-moon in those days, we find that Mrigashiras
has been designated by a name, which, if properly understood, denotes that it was the first of the cycle of the
Nakshatras, thus showing that the vernal equinox was ; once near it; that Miila can now be better understood as the
star that rose at the beginning of the first night of the
equinoctial year ; and finally the fortnight after the summer solstice was devoted to the feast of the manes, as the ayana
of the pifris commenced at that point ; and that this is fully corroborated by the Parsi month of the manes falling in their primitive calendar at the same time. It was on evidence like this that the old position of the Krittikas was
determined, and I do not see why a similar conclusion about Mrigashiras should not be allowed It is true that no |
express statement has been cited to show that Mrigashiras \ commenced the cycle of the Eakshatras in those days and that * some scholars may not consider the evidence of Agrahdyani
sufficient for the purpose. In the following chapters I hope to show that there are a number of other circumstances
and even express texts which leave little room for
cautious fears like these.

priests and the numerous legends that exist in almost all
the sections of the Aryan race about this portion of the heavens fully show that they did not fail to make use of
this brilliant opportunity* I intend to examine some of
these legends in this chapter with a view to see what corroborative evidence we may get therefrom. If we can
more naturally and easily explain the legends that relate to this part of the heavens on the present theory;, than has hitherto been done, we may fairly conclude that we have
rightly interpreted the passages from the Brahmanas; if not, we shall have either to revise our assumption or to
give it up entirely. But before we do so we must3 as far as possible, try to identify the asterisms and determine their forms as described in the ancient works.
We shall first take up Mrigashiras or Agrahayani according to Amarasinha. The very name of the Nakshatra^ which
means " an antelope's head/' * suggests the figure of the asterism. Bat the constellation consists of so many stars
that it is very difficult to say which of them might have suggested the name. I may here remark that the doctrine
of "Yogatar&s" or the junction stars cannot be supposed to have been developed in the early days we are here
* I may here, once for all, remark that though I have translated
the word Mrigaskiras by the " antelope's head," I do not mean
to imply that Mriga necessarily meant " an antelope " in the Yedic literature. It has been suggested that Mriga may mean "a bullock" or some other animal like it. It may, hut we have nothing to do
with it, inasnmch as the word Mriga itself is still used in the
Sanskrit literature to denote the constellation. My translation of
Mngashiras must therefore be considered provisional, remem
bering that though it may change yet the argument in this chapter will still remain unaltered.

speaking of. I do not mean to say that single stars iriay ; not have been or were not specifically named. But where- !;
ever a constellation is spoken of, it is more probable that I
the whole group was intended, as in the case of the Seven | Bears or the Krittikas ; and hence the determination of
the junction . stars, as given in later astronomical works, cannot help us beyond indicating where we are to look lor the constellation described in the old works. For instance, if we take Mrigashiras we are told that one of the three small stars in the head of Orion is the junction star. This
means that we must look for Mrigashiras in the constellation of Orion. But how can these three stars give us the figure of an antelope's head ? The three stars are so close that
between themselves they give us no figure at all. It is, however, suggested that the two stars in the shoulders and two in the knees of Orion give us the four feet of the
antelope, whose head may then be said to correspond with the three stars in the Orion's head. In short, it is the
antelope's head in the same way as it is the head of Orion*
Bat besides being open to the objection that this gives us the head and not the form of an antelope's head, the
explanation presupposes that the whole of the antelope is in the heavens ; and if Ardra be correctly identified with the- star in the right shoulder of Orion we shall have also to
include this star in the four feet of the antelope. The old r
Vedic works, however, seem to lay down that it was the head of the antelope and not the antelope itself, that was
transplanted to the heavens. Keferring to the legend of |I
Eudra piercing Prajfi-pati, S&yana in his commentary on the /ij 2/1/2. 8)* observes that he, tlie

terrible form created by the gods, (f cut off Prajapati' s head by the arrow," and "the arrow and the head both jumped up
to the heavens and are there stationed." The Aitareya
Brahmana (iii. 33) gives the same story and there too Pashuman or Bhutavan is said ta have pierced Prajapati
with an arrow. But it does not distinctly say whether it was the head or the body that was pierced by him though
in the Shatapatha Brahmana Mrigashiras is described as the head of Prajapati. The tradition of piercing the head does not, however, occur in this form in the Rigveda, though in Rig. x. 61. 5-7 this story of Prajapati is alluded to. But in many places where Indra is mentioned as killing Vritra we are told that he cut off the head of his enemy (i. 52. 10 ;
iv. 18. 9; viii. 6. 7) and in Rig. v. 34. 2 and viii. 93. 14,
Indra's enemy is described as appearing in the form of an
antelope. This shows that the Rigveda indirectly speaks of an antelope's head having been cut off by Indra, and it may justify us in holding that Rudra did the same. The tradition is preserved even in the Greek mythology which
tells us that Apollo, indignant at lier sister's affections for Orion, made her hit, with an arrow, a mark in the distant sea, whfeh turned out to be the Orion's head.* In the
heaven^ we must therefore look for the " cut off" head of
Mriga'with the arrow pierced in it. There are other circumstances which point to the conclusion. Sanskrit
writers have described a small group of stars in Mrigashiras
called Invakas. Amarasinha tells us that they are " on the
top of Mrigashiras.f Now if Mrigashiras itself be under

stood to denote the three small stars in the head of Orion,
Invak&s become identical with them and the distinction
given in Amara must be put aside as meaningless. I am,
therefore, of opinion thab the asterism of Mrigashiras was once really believed to possess the/orm of an antelope's head with an arrow sticking to it. The mention of the arrow in these traditions at once enables us to determine the
form, for the arrow can be readily and easily identified
with the three stars in the belt of Orion. The head with
the arrow at the top must therefore be made up by taking along with the belt the two stars in the knees and one in 4he left shoulder o Orion somewhat as below :

those in the belt and not in the head of Orion. I do not mean to imply that the asterism may not have been conceived and
figured otherwise. As a matter of fact we know that it was figured as a hunter or a deer/ and there are good grounds to hold that these are ancient ideas.* All that I, therefore* mean is that of the various figures we may make out of the
stars in the constellation of Orion, one should be of an
antelope's head with the arrow sticking to it to represent the cut off head of Mriga, and not as the present configuration supposes both the body and the head of Mriga together and unseparated.
I have in what has gone above presumed that the asterism of Mrigashiras must be looked for in the constellation of
Orion, and that the legends of Eudra and Prajapati refer to this constellation. Some scholars, however, doubted the correctness of this assumption ; and so far as ' absolute cer
tainty is concerned their doubts maybe justifiable. For, Vedic hymns were not committed to paper till a long time
after they were 1
sung, and there is of course no possibility of finding therein a photograph of the portion of the heavens referred to in the various hymns. All that we can, therefore,
do is to weigh the probabilities of the proposed identifications ; and if this course be adopted I do not think any
reasonable doubts could be entertained about the identi
fication of Mrigashiras with the constellation of Orion. To
* The constellation appears to have been variously conceived :
(1) the antelope's head ; (2) the whole antelope ; (3) Prajapati either in tte fbrm , of an antelope or as a person with a belt or
YajnopavUa (see the next chap.). Of these three forms I consider the

forms are closely connected, and that they are the developments of
the same idea.

avenger (Sirius) is even now to be seen sticking in. his body. With this tale coming down to us from the first period of Nakshatras in India who could have the least doubt of its
persistent identity from the earliest times to the latest/'*
I subscribe to every word of what is here so forcibly ex
pressed. Of course, we may expect some variations of
details as the story got degenerated into Puranic legends ; but it is impossible to mistake the general identity. I shall therefore not unnecessarily dwell upon it here.
We have seen how Mrigashiras may have been primitively
conceived. After this it is not difficult to identify the other stars. The Rohini is no other than Aldebaran. Rudra
is the presiding deity of Ardra, and we may therefore sup
pose Rudra to be represented by the star in the right shoulder of Orion (a). But the Aitareya Brahmana (iii. 33) identifies Rudra with Sirius or what} is now called the
Mriga-vyadha. The Milky Way does not appear to have
received a specific name in these old days, and the threes sections of the Aryan race the Parsis, the Greeks, and the Indians have no common word to denote the same. Yet
it is impossible to suppose that this broad stream of stars could have been unnoticed, and I shall show further on that
it was not. Greek Astronomy places two dogs in this parti of the heavens Canis Major and Canis Minor one on eacH side of the Milky Way, and it has been doubted whether

the claims of these dogs to primitive antiquity are well
founded. In wliat follows, I hope to show that they are. In the meanwhile, I may here refer to the testimony of
Plutarch to prove that some at least, of the actually existing figures of constellations in the heavens are Greek transformations of others which had been placed there before by the
Egyptians ; for this writer, who in his treatise De Iside et
Osiride makes the priests of Egypt say that the souls of gods shine in the heavens and are stars, adds that fc the
constellation of Isis is called, by the Greeks, Canis ; that
of Ebrns, Orion,, and that of Typhon, Ursa/'* This statement is very important, inasmuch as it shows that the
names of at least three constellations, Orion, Canis and Ursa, are not of Egyptian or Chaldean origin. Of these Ursa
Major (Greek ArMos) has been already identified with sapta rik&has or simply the rikshas of the Vedas and the Hapto-'
iringa of the Parsis, thus partly confirming the abovementioned statement of Plutarch; and it can be shewn, that his observation is equally good in respect of the other
two constellations, or that Canis, Orion and Ursa are all of Aryan origin. At present I use Plutarch's statement only so far as to justify us in presuming the three constellations'
to be of Aryan origin, or, to put it negatively, not borrowed by the Greeks from the Egyptians. t
* De Iside et Osiride. I take the quotation from Narrien's
Origin and Progress of Astronomy, p. 44. Narrien further
observes that this assertion of Plutarch seems to be confirmed by
the discovery of a sculptured planisphere on the ceiling of the
Temple of Denderah where "in the place of Canis Major is traced a
cow, the animal consecrated to Isis" and "instead of Orion is the figure of man which is supposed to be intended for the son of Osiris." t I have deemed it necessary to make these remarks because
Mr. Gladstone in his Time and Place of Homer, p. 214, observes that Orion is either non-Hellenic or pre-Hellenic." Plutarch's

Having thus shown that we are at liberty to assume that the Greek legends about Orion and Canis are not of foreign
origin., let us see what coincidences we can discover
between the legends of the three sections of the Aryan
race about this part of the heavens. I am not going to
trace every legend to its primitive source and explain it on the dawn or the storm theory. Nor do I believe that it is
possible to do so ; for there are many other objects in nature besides the dawn and the storm, that are likely to
impress the mind of a primitive man;* and a legend, thought it might have originated with the sun or the dawn, is sur& to grow and develop under the influence of these objects,: For instance* we can understand the story of Vritra by
supposing that he represented the power that locked up the waters in the clouds, but when we are told that this Vritra sometimes assumed the form of a Mriga, here is a distinct addition which cannot be satisfactorily accounted for on the original theory. Those that have watched and examined how legends grow can easily understand what I mean. The idea that everything must be reduced to ' 'dawn
and nothing but the dawn" is the result of supposing that
in the days of the Rigveda men were not acquainted with
anything else. The supposition is partly true, but as I shall presently show there are many passages in the Rigveda which
presuppose the knowledge of stars and constellations. Thus at the time we are speaking of several ideas had already been
testimony shews that the constellation is not of Chaldean or
Egyptian origin. The conception must therefore be pre-Hellem*c,
or, in other words, Indo-Germanic, and I think I have given ample
evidence in this chapter and the next to prove that the i(}ea of
Orion was fully developed before the Greeks, the Parsis and ^le
Hindus separated.

formed and recognised and even familiarly known. For
example, the idea of Devaydna and Pitriydna appears to have been well settled at this time, so much so that I. though the year was afterwards made to commence with the winter
solstice, the equinoctial division of the heavens, with all the notions which had already become associated with it, continued to exist, though somewhat restricted in its scope, side by side with the new system. Whether this idea itself
is or is not further resolvable into simpler ideas is a
'
different question altogether. Perhaps it may be shown to have grown out of the idea of day and night or light and darkness. There are several passages in the Rigveda (L 123. 7; 164. 47e ) which speak of a black and a white day,
and it is very likely that these were the original names of Devaydna and Pitriydna; for when new ideas are introduced
it is usual to express them in old words with such qualify
ing adjectives as would distinguish the new idea from the
old one. A " black day" might thus mean the Dakshina
yana or the Pitriyana, as night appeared to increase at the
expense of day during the period. When the southern course of the sun thus came to be likened to a dark day or
l
night (Ri'g. vi. 9. 1) it was naturally regarded as a night of the Devas to distinguish it from the ordinary night ; and as
no sacrifices were performed during the ordinary night, so no offerings could be made to the Devas during their night (vi. 58. 1 ). Of course, it must have been a long time before
men could develop conceptions like .these,, There was, indeed, a time when they could hardly account for the fact
how the sun found his way from the west back to the east. In the Rigveda x. 72.7, the sun is said to rise from out of
the ocean and a similar , idea is found in Homer who
describes not only the sun, bat even the stars, as '*.bathed



106 THE ORION. [CHAPTER
in the waters of the ocean."* In the Bigveda x. 108. 1,
Saraina is said to have crossed really a " long way." The Aitareya Brahmana iii. 44, which states that the sun never
sets in reality, makes a distinct advance upon these notions. But it is difficult to say whether astronomical ideas were
developed to such an extent in the days when the year first
commenced from the winter solstice. I do not, however, wish
to enter here into these details. As -previously observed I assume that," at the time we are speaking, the Vedic Aryas had
already passed through these stages, and that the ideas of Devaydna and Pitriydna were familiarly known and established ; and assuming these as established, I intend to examine
how legends were built upon them. I have, however, briefly alluded to the probable origin of these ideas inasmuch as
it helps us to better appreciate the description of the Devayana and the Pitriyana. Ordinarily the Pitriyana is
described (Rig. ix. 113. 3 ) as the region " where Vaivas
vata is the king, which is the undermost (lit. obstructed t )
part of the heavens, and where there are eternal waters.-" The Vaivasvata Yama here spoken of does not, however, appear to have as yet been invested with the terrible charao
Rs ter we find given to him in the later literature. Corresponding to Tama in the south we have Indra in the north,
each supreme in his own sphere, and dividing the whole world into two parts, one bright and known, and the other
watery and mysterious, or, in the language of seasons, first

Now when the vernal equinox was in Orion or Mrigashiras 'it was the beginning of the Devayana, and as the constellation is remarkable for its brilliancy and attractive
ness the ancient Aryans may have been naturally influenced not merely to connect their old traditions with it, but also
to develope them on the same lines. Thus the Devayana
and the Pitriyana, as representing the two hemispheres must be joined, and the vernal and the autumnal equinoxes became the natural points of union between the regions of
gods and Yama. The equinoxes were, in fact, the gates of heaven, and as such it was natural to suppose that they were watched by dogs. In the Rigveda i. 48. 15 the dawn
is spoken of as illuminating the "gates of heaven/5 and in i. 13. 6 andii. 3. 5 the gates-deities are invoked to keep the
gates open. We have a similar invocation in the Vajasaneyi Sanhita 21. 49. This shows that the idea of the "gates of heaven" was not unknown in Vedic times, and the ar
rangement of the gates on the sacrificial ground, which is prepared on the model of the annual passage of the sun, shows that these gates divided the whole hemisphere into two
parts. Macrobius records a tradition that " the ancients
designated the signs of Cancer and Capricorn as the gates of the sun, at which having arrived, the luminary seemed to
retrace his path in the zone which he never leaves."* Now Macrobius could not but speak in the language of the
twelve zodiacal portions, and if we therefore divest his
statement of the form in which it is naturally expressed it

means that the equinoxes, which the ancients supposed to be once in the zodiacal signs named above, were then called gates of heaven.
The Iranians, however, have preserved the legend more
fully. With them the equinox is not merely a gate, but a bridge connecting heaven and hell the Devaloka and the Yamaloka, or the Devayana and the Pitriyana and "dogs that keep the Chinvat Bridge )} help the departing soul to
cross it. Darrnesteter, in his introduction to the 'Vendidad, published in the Sacred Books of the Bast Series, observes* that "this reminds one at once of the three-headed Kerberos,
watching at the doors of hell and still more of the four-eyed
dogs of Yama, who guard the ways to the realm of death"
(Rig. x. 14.10). The ideas are, indeed, strikingly similar
and point ont to a common source. Kerberos has even been identified with Sanskrit Shdbala or Sharvara, meaning
variegated or a dog of Yama, But, as far as I know, no satisfactory explanation has yet been given of these legends
nor any attempt made to explain them on a rational basis.t If we, however, suppose that the vernal equinox was once in Orion, the constellations of Canis Major and Canis Minor
the two dogs would then be on the boundary line of heaven and Yama's region, and the whole of the above story may
be seen illustrated in the sky like that of Prajapati and
Budra previously referred to.} According to Bundahis,

of Arezur at the gate of hell ; while Dr. Geiger observes that "it was believed to have been built over a wide expanse
of water which separates the paradise from this world, 5 '*
In the later Indian literature we are told that the souls of
the deceased have to cross a streamt before they reach the region of Yama, while the story of Charon shews that even the Greeks entertained a similar belief. What could this river be ? With the vernal equinox ia Orion, one can
easily identify it with the Milky Way, which could then
have been appropriately described as separating the regions of gods and Yama, the Devayana and the Pitriyana, or the Northern and the Southern hemisphere. In the later
Hindu works it is actually called the Celestial River (svar
that the dogs represent the sun and the moon. His explanation
does not, however, show how and why the dogs came to be located
at the gates of heaven and why they should he entrusted amongst
all the sections of the Aryan race with the duty of watching the
souls of the dead. Bloomfield quotes Kath. S. xxxvii. 14 (where
day and night are called the Dogs of Yama) and Shat. Br. xi. 1.
5. 1. (where the moon is said to be a divine dog) to prove that the
dogs must be understood to mean the sun and the moon. But I
think that the Brahmana here gives simply a conjectural explana
tion, and, as in the case of Namuchi's legend, we cannot accept it,
inasmuch as it does net give any reason why the dogs were station
ed at the doors of Yama's region. There are many other incidents
in the story which are not explained on Bloomfield's theory. I see,
therefore, no reason for modifying my views which were put down
in writing before I could get Bloomfjeld's paper in the last number
of the Journal of the American Oriental Society.

nadi), while the Greeks have placed near it the constellation
of Argos (ship) and two dogs Canis Major and Canis
Minor one on each side to guard both the entrances of the
Ghinvat Bridge across it. The Rigveda also mentions two dogs of Yama kept to "watch the way," while the Greeks
place a three-headed dog at the gates of hell. In Kig. x. 63, 10 we are farther told that the land of the blessed is to
be reached by " the celestial ship with a good rudder." *
The words in the original are daioim navam. Comparing these with the expression divyasya sJiunak in the Atharva
Veda vi 80. 3, and seeing that a celestial (divya) representation of Rudra is described in later worksf it seems to me
that we must interpret the epithet to mean " celestial " and
not simply " divine." Thus the Vedic works appear to place
a celestial dog and a celestial ship at the entrance of the
other world, .and these can be easily identified with the
Greek constellations of Argo Navis and Canis, if we suppose
the Milky Way to be the boundary of Heaven in these days.
I do not mean to say that these conceptions had their origin
in the appearance of the heavens. On the contrary, a com
parison with the n on-Aryan legends shows it to be more likely that the heavenly bodies received their names from
the pre-existing beliefs, about the other world, amongst the
people* .Herbert Spencer tells us that amongst the nonAryan savage races the journey to the next world is believed to lie over land, down a river or across the sea, and that in
consequence the practice of burying their dead in boats prevails amongst some of them.J The North Americans,

we are farther told, say that the Milky Way is fe the e Path
of Spirits j*
* the Road of the Souls/ where they travel to the
laud beyond fche grave, and where their camp fires may be seen blazing as brighter stars."* This coincidence between
the Aryan and the non-Aryan legends makes it highly probable that the figures of the constellations were conceived by the Aryans according to notions of the next world
prevailing amongst them at that time. It may be noticed, however, that the non-Aryan races do not connect the idea
of time, e. </., of the year and the seasons, with these beliefs, while it is the chief characteristic of the Aryan legends.
We are, for instance, told that the dog commenced the year
(Rig. i. 161. 13) and that the Devayana comprised the three seasons of Vasanta, Grishma and Varsha (Shat. Bi\ ii.
L 3. l).f It is this feature of the Aryan legends that is
most important for the purpose of our enquiry, while the coincidence, above pointed out, confirms, in a remarkable
way, the genesis of the Aryan legends here proposed. The chief elements in the traditions of the three Aryan nations
may thus be satisfactorily explained. It may, however, be contended that the two dogs of Yama spoken of in the Rigveda may not be the same as the
Avesta dogs at the Bridge. A closer examination of the
several passages in the Rigveda will, however, dispel such doubts. In the Vendidad xiii. 9, the dogs are called peshupdna, or those that guard the way to the region of death. The Avesta dog is chat/iru-chashmen (Ved. viii. 16), while the Vedic dogs are described as chatur-akshau (Rig. x.
34. 11), both of which expressions mean u four-eyed/' The dogs in the Avesta and the Rigveda, however, differ in colour.

112 THE ORION. [CHAPTER
In Ved. viii. 16 the dogs are said to be zairitem or spaetem yellow or white with yellow ears ; while
zainthe dogs of Yaina are said to be shabalau, spotted or
variegated. But the difference is neither very material,
nor such as cannot be accounted for. In the Rigveda we
can trace the yellow colour of the Avesta dogs. The antelope of the sun in Rig. x. 86. 3 is said to be harita or
.yellow, the zairelem of the Avesta, and if we 'suppose this
antelope to be no other than that represented by Orion, as
the sun commenced the year at that point, we need not be .surprised if the dogs in the Avesta are described as yellow, especially when in the Atharva Veda viii. 1.9. we find the
two messenger dogs of Yama named as Shydma and .Shabala, thus noting probably a difference in colour. The Atharva Veda iv. 20. 7 mentions a four-eyed bitch, while in
the Shatapatha Brahmana xiii. 1. 3. 7 the adjective is applied to a dog ; and the same animal is evidently intended in both
places. In the Parsi scriptures the dogs at the Chinvat
.Bridge are sometimes spoken of in singular (Ved. viii. 16) and sometimes, as in Rig. x. 14. 11. in dual (Ved. xiii. 9).
This shows that we might disregard gender and number in ,the description of these dogs; and we are thus led to
suppose that Sarama in the Rigveda is again to be identified with the dogs that watch the gates of heaven. Whether Sarama* in primitive days was or was not connected with the dawn, I do not undertake to say. But there is an, incident in her story which confirms the identification I
have proposed. The Panis tried to coax Sarama by offering
.her milk which she drank. On her return she denied
having seen the cows of ludra, who thereupon kicked her

and she vomited the milk. Now the mention of milk at once suggests the idea that it must be the milk in the
galaxy on each side of which the two dogs are stationed . In Rig. iv. 57. 5 Shunasirau are invoked in order that they
may pour down upon the earth the C( mil k, " which they
"make in. heaven*" Prof, Max Miiller records a suggestion
that Shunasirau, here spoken of, may be a very old name for the Dog-star, and with its derivative Sairya would give us
the etymon of Seirios I * In Rig, vii. 55. 2 the Vastoshpati,
"the guardian of the house/' in the form of a dog, is invoked and described as bright and red Sdrameya on
whose jaws spears seem to glitter: a description which answers so well with the appearance of Sirius, that with what has been said above we may at once identify the
S&rameya with the Dog-star. I may here refer to the
Shatapatha Brahrnana ii. 1. 2. 9, where speaking of Mriga
shiras, the Prajapati's body pierced by Rudra is described
as his vdstu. May not Vastoshpati be regarded as guardian, of this? If so, it may be a further proof that Vastoshpati
represents the star Sirius, which, as it were, guards the head of Prajapati in the" form of Orion or the antelope's head.
But, apart from this suggestion, I would finally quote Rig. i. 161* 13, where it is expressly stated that "the dog
awakened" the Ribhus, the genii of the seasons, at the "end
of the year I" Sayana proposes to interpret shvdnam in the original by "wind," but it is evidently an error. In. the Shatapatha Brahmana xiii. 5. 1. 8, vrika and sTivd are mentioned together, and the former is known to be a name
for a wild dog. If so, Sayana's explanation of Rig. i. 105. 1 1 appears to be more probable than that of Yaska. It is in

fact a description of the dog (star) appearing in the east
after crossing "the eternal wafers V* of Yamaloka, and tlien
being immediately lost in the rays of the sun, which rising
after it, had to push the wild dog out of his way. The
mention of the "eternal waters" of the Yamaloka indicates
that the heliacal rising of the Dog-star, here referred to*
occurred at the end of the Pitriydna or at the vernal equinox,
thus further confirming the statement that the dog commenced the year. There are -other passages of similar
import, but as I wish to avoid, for the present, any disputed.
passages, I do not mention them here. If the time, I am
contending to establish for the hymns of the Rigveda, comes to b accepted, it is sure to furnish an unerring clue to tlie
interpretation of many other passages and legends in that sacred book, but the work must be left to be done hereafter.
Patting all these passages together, we find that in the
Rlgveda, dogs are described as dark and brown, bright and
red, possessing four eyes, guarding the house and the way
to Yama's region, vomiting and making milk, and above
all beginning the new year.* All these facts clearly show thai the Vedic dogs are the same as the Hellenic or
the Iranian, and we can easily and satisfactorily account
* Prdl Bloomfield's theory leaves many of these facts un
explained. If the dogs represent the sun and the moon, how can Hie SUB tell the Ribhus that the dog awakened them at the end
of the year 7 I cannot also understand how the sun and the moon
em be described as variegated in colour, or as engaged in makiBg
milk. Agala how can the sun or the moon be said to be four- eyed,
and why should they perpetually remain at the boundary of

for all these legends by supposing that the vernal equinox was near the Dog-star in those days,, thus making the dog
rise with the sun in the beginning of the year at the gates of the Devayana. "We can now also understand how the dogs could have been described as four-eyed. For, if they are
correctly identified with Canis near the Milky Way, then
the four stars in the body of Ganis might naturally be said
to be his eyes ;* for once the number of eyes is increased from two to four, we need not expect to find them .all on the
head, but, like the thousand eyes of.Indra in the later
mythology, they may be regarded as spread over the whole body. M. Darmesteter rightly observest that "the Parsis
being at a loss to find four-eyed dogs interpreted the name as meaning a dog with two spots above the eyes; but it is
clear that the two-spotted dog's services^ are only accepted
* In Rig. x. 127. 1, the stars are said to be the eyes of night.
The Greeks entertained a similar idea. Their Argos was surnamed

J These services are required at the funeral ceremony. It may be here noted that the hymn in the Rigveda which describes
Yama's dogs ( Rig. x. 14 ) is still recited at the time of burning the dead body of a Hindu, Every Brahman has also to give, every day, two small offerings of cooked rice to the two dogs of Yama, Shyama and Shabala, at the time of the Paiskvadeva sacrifice. Several
deities receive their oblations at this sacrifice. The offerings are
placed on the ground in the form of a circle, beginning with the
eastern point. The offering to Shyama is placed outside the circle at the south-west and that to Shabala at the north-west point. In other words, Shyama and Shabala are placed cm each side of the

for want o a four-eyed one, or of a white one with yellow ears. 35 Evidently the Parsi priests failed to realise that it
was the divine or heavenly, and not an earthly dog that was here described, as driving the death-fiend. The Atharva Veda vi. 80* 3 shows that the Indian priests of the
time well understood it to mean a dog who is " born of waters, whose house is in the sky, and who sheds his lustre
all around. "
There is another set of traditions which we can similarly
explain on the supposition with which we have started, viz., that the vernal equinox was then in Orion. The heliacal
rising of the constellation at the beginning of the year
marked the revival of nature at the commencement of spring, and the asterism may thus be said to represent all these
milder influences which iu later mythology were fully embodied in the conception o Vishnu. But the case was
completely reversed if we take the acronycal rising of the same. It was at the autumnal equinox that the Dog-star
rose ab the beginning of night, and though, strictly speaking, it marked the end of Varsha, yet the portion of the heaven
wherein the constellation is situated could have been easily
regarded as the battle-ground of Indra' and Vritra who fought ib. those days, and also as the stage on which the terrible
Eudra made his appearance. In short, the constellation
naturally became the harbinger of the mild and the terrible
aspects of nature. It is in this latter sense that the Dog
star might be considered a rain-star, and Sarama, like the
Greek Hermes with which it is identified, might be said to
have been sent to search for the cows of Indra taken away
by the Pa^isof the nether world. The Greek legends mention

two watch dogs Kerberos and Orthros ; and of these Kerberos has been etymologically identified with Sharvara and Orfchros with Vritra* But no explanation has been given of how this Vritra came to be stationed at the gates of
hell. Prof. Max Miiller suggests that Orthros is the dark
spirit that is to be fought by the sun in the morning. But
then, this does not explain why it was called Vritra, and
how it came to be killed by Herakles". The legend - of
Namuchi, as given in the Rigveda and interpreted on the supposition that the year began with, the Dog-star, does, however, solve the difficulty. I have already alluded to the fact that in the Rigveda Vritra is often said to appear in the
form, of a Mriga (Rig. i. 80. 7 ; v. 82. 3 ; v. Si. 2 ; viii. 93 .
14). In Rig. vii. 19. 5 Vritra and Namuchi are both said
to be killed by Indra, and though this cannot be taken as a direct authority for holding that Vritra and Narnuchi are the different forms of the same enemy, yet from the description of the two I do not think there can be any
doubt as to their being identical. In fact, Shushna, Pipru,
Kuvaya and Namuchif are only so many different names
of the enemy of Indra. Now Indra is represented as cutting off the . head of Vritra (Rig- i. 52. 10 ), and also of
Namuchi (Rig. v. 30. 7; vi, 20. 6). Combining these statements we get that Indra cut off the head of Vritra or
Namuchi, in the form of a Mriga; and this at once suggests the question whether that head is not the same as that of
Prajapati cut off by Rudra and which gave the name of

Mriga-shirsha, or cf the antelope's head" to the constellation. In Rig.i. 53. 7, we are simply told that Namuchi was killed by Indra in the distant (pardvati) region, which seems to mean the region of Yama. But as it does not satisfactorily determine the place where Namuchi was killed, I refer to
Rig. x. 73. 7, where Indra by killing Namuohi is said to have
cleared np "the paths leading (ydna in the original) to the (region of) Devas;"* which plainly shows that Namuchi was killed at the gates of the Devayana. In the Vajasaneyi Sanhita 10. 14 a sacrificial rite is described which gives the
same place and time of Namuchi's death. The priest there throws away a piece of metal hidden under a tiger "hide,
exclaiming, " the head of Namuchi is thrown away/' after
he has taken his Yajamdna through all directions (East,
South, West, North and upwards) and also through all the seasons (Vasanta, Grishma, Sharad, Varsha and Hemanta
and-Shishira), This means, if it can mean anything, that Namuchi alias Vrifcra was killed, in the language of seasons,
affcer Shishira, or in other words, at the gate of the Devayana as described in the above quoted passage from the Rigveda, for the end of Shishira is the eod of the Pitriyana. Here tfaea we have an explanation of how Orthros came to be
afe && gate of hell, or in a distant region under the setting smn. But the association of Orthros with Kerberos throws
farther light on the subject. If Vritra's head is the same
as Mrigarskfrsha, as explained in the beginning of this chapter* .then .the three stars in the belt of Orion, which
form the top of Mrigashiras, might have easily suggested the idea of a three-headed monster. In Rig. x. 99. .6
* The original verse is as follows :

Indra is said to have killed a three-headed and six-eyed
monster. It might be contended that the explanation is

supposed to be again conceived as a dog, while there is no
authority in the Vedic works expressly describing Mriga as
a dog. But if Orthros has become a dog in the Greek
mythology, while it is a Mriga in the Vedas, I see no reason why Kerberos should not get his three heads from the
Trishirshan of the Vedas. The difficulty is not at all a serious one. In bringing together the traditions of the three Aryan
races after thousands of years, we must make some allow
ances, and be satisfied with a general similarity of the stories. The asterism of Mrigashiras and the dogs are so close, that one might be easily mistaken for the other, when all
the knowledge of the original traditions was lost. It is thus that we can account for the fact that out of the three beings
that were represented in this portion of the heavens, Bodra
(the hunter), Mriga (bhe antelope), and Shv& (the dog),
the Greeks retained in the sky only the hunter (Orion), and
the dog (Kaon*, Ganis), with nothing to hunt, while the Hindus have not only forgotten, but condemned, the dog.
The Parsis, it is true, have not mistaken the dog* but
still as regards complexion, they have represented their dogs as possessing the colour which in the Bigveda is given.
* The principal star in Ganis Minor is still called Procyon = Gk.
Prokuon, Sk. Prashvan, the Foredog. It shews that the previous
star was once called Kaon by the Greeks. If we count the Naksha

to the antelope of the sun. Another objection that may be
urged against this identification is that we are required to
suppose Mrigashiras to be once the head of Prajllpati, and at another time that of Vritra. It must, however, "be remembered that we do so on the express authority of the Rigveda, and that besides it is quite natural to suppose that
once the antelope's head was said to exist in the heavens., Vedic poets vied with each other in weaving legends out of
it. As an illustration I refer to Rig. x. 86. 5, where the
poet describes Vrishakapi's head as cut off, but soon after
Yrishakapi is told that it was an illusion, and that in reality it was some one else whose head was so severed {verse 18).
This clearly shows that it was a period when legends were

We can now explain how later writers evolved a myth
out of Hamuchi's death. The story is given in the Tandya Brahnlana (xii. 6. 8).* There we are told that Indra and Namuchi came to a settlement that the former should kill
the latter, neither during day nor by night, nor by any
weapon, whether dry or wet, Indra therefore killed him with the foam of the waters at the junction of day and night, when it had dawned, but yet the sun had not risen, It is
probably this circumstance that has led Professor Max Miller to suppose that Orthros represents the gloom of the morning. Bnt the explanation does not account for the other

incidents in the story. Was Namuchi or Vritra killed every
morning by Indra ? Or was it only at the beginning of the
rainy season ? Evidently the latter. We must then suppose
that Namuchi was killed after dawn, bat before the actnal daybreak, at or during the monsoons. In other words, the
junction of day and night in the later myths must be under
stood to mean a particular junction of day and night in the
rains, or more definitely, the junction of the day and the night of the Gods the junction of the Pitriyana and the Devayana, the gates of which are said to be cleared np by Namuehi's. death in the passage from the Rigveda given
above. The latter part of the legend is, however, still more
poetical, and Prof. Max Muller's theory leaves it entirely unexplained. Indra is here said to have killed Narauclii with a weapon which was neither dry nor moist the watery
froth. This is evidently based upon Rig. viii. 14. 13, where Indra is described as rt catting the head of Namuchi with.
the foam of waters, " and the same incident is again referred
to in Rig. x. 61. 8. Therefore, even if we reject later speculations with respect to "why foam or froth should have

elements in the later Yedic traditions are satisfactorily
explained by placing, as originally proposed/ the vernal I equinox in the constellation of Orion, and identifying Namuchi alias Vritra with the constellation of Mrigashiras
- or the antelope's head, situated just below the Milky Way.
We have next to deal with the legends of the bold
hunter, the terrible Eudra chasing the antelope. Several
attributes in the Puranic mythology, e. g., his bearing the
Ganges, in his matted hair, his fondness for the burning
ground, and his appearance as Kirata or hunter, are all accounted for by placing Eudra just below the Milky Way or the celestial Ganges,* at the gates of the Ktri
yana and figured as a hunter. I have already alluded to the difficulty of identifying Rudra. But whether we take the star of Ardra or Sirius to represent the lord of cattle, the above attributes remain the same. But neither these
legends, nor the story of Eudra chasing Prajapati, which, so far as it was necessary for our present purpose, has been
already given, can help us, in a material degree, to solve the question under consideration. I wish, therefore, to deal here only with such traditions as point out to the position
of Eudra in the course of the year. Rudra as the lord of the
cattle and the presiding deity of storms, can be at once recognized and placed in the rainy season. There are, how
ever, other legends indicating time more definitely. In Rig. x. 192. 2, Samvatsara or the year is said to rise out of
the ocean, the place where Vritra was killed (Rig. x. 68.
12). Prajapati, as represented by Orion, may also be
naturally supposed to commence the year when the vernal
equinox was irt Orion. Rudra killed Prajapati, and as If
\\

V.] THE ANTELOPE'S HEAD. 125
I have shown before, Prajapati, Samvatsara and Yajna were convertible terms. Rudra therefore killed Prajapati
or Yajna at the beginning of the year ; and Yajna also meant sacrifice. Rudra was therefore naturally believed to
have killed the sacrifice thus giving rise to the Puranic
.legends of Rudra routing the sacrifice of Daksha. At the
end of the Sauptika Parva in the Mahabharata * we are told
that " Rudra pierced the heart of Yajna or Sacrifice with
an arrow. Thus pierced the Sacrifice, with fire, fled away in the form of an antelope and having reached the sky, there shines in that form, followed by Rudra." Thus it was
that Rudra acquired the title of Facrifice-breaJker. In the
Tandya Brahmana vii. 2.1, the death of Prajapati is, however,
spoken of as voluntary. In Taitt. Br. iii. 9. 22. 1, he is said to have assumed the form of Yajna and given himself up
to the Devas to be sacrificed. The Devas killed Mm on
their morning, and so every one should similarly perform the Ashvamedha sacrifice at the beginning of the year. One can now understand what the meaning of these stories is.
They refer to the death of Praj&pati by Rudra at the begin
ning of the year ; and thus it was that Yajna, meaning- the year was sacrificed by means of Yajna or Prajapati, Rig. x. 90. 16., where we are told that Gods sacrificed Yajna by Yajna,
but this (human sacrifice) was an old (out of date) practice, may also be similarly interpreted. I cannot say which of

I have already alluded to 'the Pars! legends of the Chinvat

Tistrya'hs "been identified with.Sirius and the identification^
i^jadt absolutely correct, is at least sufficiently, so for general purposes. . But I think ;that the word itself has not been, yet
satisfactorily explained. I propose to derive Tistrya from i-sivi which in- Sanscrit means three-stars, Tri-stri may

Tistrya witl Shins the etymology is not explained, nor can we
account for fie Modern Persian name Tir which again means an
arrow. While if we identify Tristrya.with the three stars in the
belt everything is satisfactbrily accountecT for. All the arguments
based upon the "rain-producing" influence of the star are equally
applicable in either case, since both the stars ( Sinus and Orion }

preserved another interesting relic of tlie asterism of
Mrigashiras, but I reserve it for the next chapter.
Starting with the supposition that the vernal equinox was in Orion, we have thus an easy and a simple explanation "by which the three principal deities in the Hindu mythology can be traced to and located in this part of heavens.
Vishnu representing the happy times of Vasanta, Kudra presiding over storms and Prajapati, the deity of sacrifices
beginning the year, were all combined in one place. It was here that Vishnu killed Varaha ( Rig. i. 61. 7) ; it was here that Indra killed Vritra, and it was here that Eudra
chased Prajapati, iu the form of Yajna or that he sacrificed
himself. r he celestial Ganges separating the upper and the nether world was also in the same quarters, and through
|t Jay the path to Yama's region. In a word the Trinity ofthe
i Hindu Pantheon was fully represented in the constellation of Orion, when the vernal equinox was there. Later writers describe this Trinity as represented by the three-headed Dattatreya, followed by the Vedas in the form of dogs; and after what has been said above, I think we can have no
difficulty in identifying this personified Trinity with Orion having three stars in the head and closely followed by the dog (Canis) at its foot. It will be difficult to find another place int the heavens where all these elements are combined in such an interesting manner.

IN the last chapter I have quoted an observation of Plutarch that the Greeks gave their own name to the constellation of Orion, and have there discussed some Vedic legends which corroborate Plutarch's remarks and indicate that the vernal equinox was in Orion at that time. In the present chapter I mean to examine other legends which go to shew that the constellation of Orion was known and figured before the Greeks, the Parsis, and the Indians separated from their common home, and that the legends or the traditions so preserved, and perhaps the name of the
constellation, can be naturally and easily explained only on the snpposition that the vernal equinox was then near the
asterism of Mrigashiras.
I have already shown that Agr<ih3,yant9 if not Agraliciyana, can be traced back to Panini's time, as the name of a Nakshatra, and that it is a mistake to derive it from the
name of the full-moon day. We have now to see i we cam

trace back the word still further. The word lidyana does
not occur in the Bigveda, and it may "be doubted if the name
Agralidyani was in use in the old Vedic days. Hayana is., however, used in the Atharva Veda (viii. 2. 21 ; xi. 6. 17) and in the Brahinanas; and may be compared with Zend Zayano meaning winter, Panini (lii. 1. 148) derives hdyana
from &$=== to go or abandon, after the analogy of gdyana, and gives two meanings, viz., the grain ' vrlhi ' and time. Whether we accept this derivation or not, it is at any rate clear that the word was used in Paninfs days, to denote
a division of time and a kind of grain, and I think w
can better account for both, these meanings of hdyana

cf calendar observes that ft probably the half-year was more
employed in civil life than the complete year/'* Now whether the observation be entirely correct or not, we can,
I think at any rate, assume that the division of the. year into
two equal halves is an old one. I have already discussed the two-fold division of the year into Devaydna and Pitriydna and its coincidence with the passage of the sun to the north
and the south of the equator. Ayana in the sense of such a division thus appears to be an old word and by prefixing h

followed by a vowel at the beginning of a word is not un
common even in these days,"* and there is nothing extra
ordinary if we derive hdyana from ayana. Now by a natural process when we have two forms of a word or two
derivatives of the same root they gradually come to be
utilised for specific purposes, and so acquire distinct meanings. Sanskrit lexicographers class such words under
Yogarudha, meaning thereby that etymology and convention have each a share in determining their denotation.
Hagana might thus come to exclusively denote a complete year, while ayana continued to denote a half-year as
before.-f When ayana thus became hayana, Agrayana,
which all lexicologists derive from agra + ayana, J would
be changed into agra + liayana = AgraJiayana $ and when. Jiayana was changed to hdyana in a manner analogous to the words in the Prajnadi list (Pan. v. 4. 3&) as stated above,
Agrahayana would be altered into Agrahdyana. We can thus account for the double forms Jiayana and hayana,
AgraJiayana and AgraJiayana which we find given, in Bohtlingk and Roth's and other lexicons, while if we ac

f Zend Zayano, denoting winter, probably preserves an older meaning, when hupam was used to denote the second of the two seasons (summer and winter) into which Dr. Schrader believes
that the year was primevally divided. Some of the synonyms for
the year in. Sanskrit originally denoted particular seasons, e. g.,
Parshd, Sharad. Samd and Hdyana may he similarly supposed to have been derived from the names of the half-year or ayana.

the interchange of theinitial vowel with the following long a.



13? THE ORIO%. [CHAPTER
cept Panini's derivation, hay aria will have to be either thrown out as incorrect or derived otherwise. In Amara
ii. S. 52, hayana occurs as a different reading for day ana in the sense of a vehicle and Bhanu Dikshita derives it from
hay to go ; but we might as well ask it hay, ay, and i, all
meaning to go, are not the different forms of the same root.
As far as the form of the word is concerned we may there
fore derive hdyana from hay etna and the latter again from
ayana and similarly Agrahdyana from Agrahayana and this again from Agrayana.
I may> however, remark that the process which appears so
simple according to the modern philological rules,, was not recognized by the native grammarians. There are good many words in Sanskrit which can be thus easily derived on the principle of the insertion and omission of h. Thus we have invakd and hinvdkd both meaning the stars on the top of Mrigashiras, and atta and hatta denoting a market
place. But native grammarians, including Panini, would not derive the words from each other, as we have done above in the case of ayana and hayana. Their method is to give two different roots for the two words ; thus we have two Vedic roots hinva and inva or hiv and iv, both mean
ing to go, to please, the one giving us hinvaltd and the other invaJcd. At and hat, an and han, ay and hay, i and hi are farther instances of the principle adopted by the
native grammarians in such cases. Really speaking this is not solving the difficulty, but only shifting it a stage backwards; for, if any explanation is necessary to account for the double forms like ayana and hayana, it is equally
Tequirejr to explain why we should have the doublf roots like-oj and hay, both meaning to go. But it appears that the native grammarians, having traced the words to .their



VL] ORIOlf AND. HIS- BELT. 193
roots, did not push the matter further. With them ina is
derived from i to go, ayana from ay to go, hayana from hay to go, and hayana from hd to go.* Whether and how far we can dispense with some of these roots is an impor
tant philological question, but it is not necessary for us to discuss it here. It does not much affect the point under
discussion whether hdyana is derived from ayana, i. e., ay to
go, or from hd to go as Panini has done. Etymologically
both the words, ayana and hdyana, mean "going',' and when both carne to be used to denote a division of time, it
is natural to suppose that they soon acquired special meanings. Thus while ayana continued to denote the half-year;
hdyana, which was comparatively a later word, might have been exclusively used to denote the complete year, and as the beginning of the first ayana was also the beginning of
the year, A(a)grayana would be naturally changed into A(a)grahd(a)ya,iia to express the beginning of the year. Whether we adopt Panini's derivation or the principle
of modern philology we thus arrive at the same result, and so far as our present inquiry is concerned we can therefore suppose that the various words, which may be
represented by A(a)gra(d)yana, or A(a)grahd(a)yana, are
all transformations or derivations of agra + ayana =
A(a)grayana.
* This method sometimes fails, and native grammarians who are not now at liberty to coin new roots, have to resort to the Pnshodaradi list. For example, we have two forms ilvald and
hilval'd as different readings for invaM in Amara i. 3. 23. Of
these Undid can be derived from U9 to sleep, though the root meaning" is ii@t suitable, but hilvald cannot be even so derived and Taranutha in his Vachaspatya would derive or rather obtain the
initial h by Prishodaradi. Similarly cf. darldi! . .--. '



134 THE ORION. [CHAPTER
Now as regards tlie meaning it appears to me that ayana, at first denoted nothing more than the passage of the
sun. Gradually it meant a division of time regulated by
such passage. The Agrayana-ishtis thus appear to have originally meant the two half-yearly sacrifices performed on the first day of each ayana, which seems to be regarded
somewhat like the new year's day at present. Gargya Narayana, in his commentary on Ashvalayana's Shrauta Sutras
<i. 2. 9. L) derives Agrayana from agra+ayana^ but interprets it to mean a sacrifice which is followed by eating (ayana),
that is, which requires to be performed before the new
harvest is used for domestic purposes. He thus takes
ayana to mean eating, and as the Agrayaneslitis in later
works like Manu (iv. 27) were described as u new-harvest
sacrifices/' all commentators have adopted this explanation of the word. But it appears to me to be evidently of later origin and invented to account for the nature of the
sacrifice when owing to the falling back of seasons the
Agrayaneshtis came to be performed not at the beginning of each ayana as they should have been, but at wrong
times. The necessity of such an explanation must haye been still more keenly felt, when instead of two half-yearly
sacrifices, the Agrayanaishtis were performed thrice a yeai\ Ashvalayana, it is true, gives only two, one in Vasanta and
the other in Sharad, the old beginnings of the Devayana and the Pitriy&na and the real commencement of the two ayanas. But he has mentioned three kinds of grain that
maybe used, vrihi, shydmdka and yava ( i. 2. 9. 1, ) and his commentator Gargya Narayana observes that yava and
shydmdka are to be used simultaneously in Sharad (i. 2* 9 13). It appears, however, that the fact, that three kinds of grain were sanctioned for use, soon gave rise to three



VI.] ORIOU AND HIS BELT. 135
Agrayana-ishtis one in Yasanta with vrlhi ; the second in Varsha with shydmaka, and the third in Sharad with
yava. But that it is a practice of later origin is evident
from a passage in the Taittiriya Sanhita ( v. 1. 7. 3 )
which states that " twice is grain cooked for the year, "
clearly meaning thereby thab there were only two Agrayana-ishtis in a year when the new harvest was first offered to gods. I am therefore of opinion that originally
there were only two half-yearly sacrifices at the commence- !
i|
ment of each ay ana, and as vrihi was used on the occasion
of the first of these ishtis, the word ayana or kdyana
naturally came to denote the grain SQ used, and that ayana in Agrayana originally meant not eating as the later writers have imagined, but a half-year as the word usually denotes. This way of deriving and explaining the word is not a new invention. For notwithstanding the fact 'that
Agrayana and AgraJidyana are explained by Taranatha as referring to the sacrifice of grain and eating, yet he derives
Agrayana, a word of the same group, from agra-\-ayana
and explains it to mean that " the Uttarayana was in its front."* Even native scholars thus appear .to be aware of the fact that Agrayana could be or was derived from
ayana meaning the Uttarayana. Indeed, we cannot otherwise account why the Agrayaneshtis were originally celebrated at the beginning of Vasanta and the end of Var&ha
as stated by Ashvalayana. The AgraJidyanl of Amara is thus traceable to Agrayani of the Vedic works ; and perhaps
it was the initial long vowel in the latter that might have been retained in the later form.
It may, however, be asked if there is any evidence to show
* See Vachaspatya s. v. Agrayana.



130 THE OEI6N. [CHAPTER
that Agrayana was used to denote a star in the Vedic
works. That Amara, and long before him Panini, under
stood Agralidyanij if not Agrahayana, to mean the Naksha
tra o Mrigashiras is undoubted ; and I think we might
fairly infer therefrom that the meaning given by these writers must have come down to them traditionally. Every
ayana must begin with some Nakshatra, and it is quite natural to suppose that Agrayana must have gradually come to denote the star that rose with the first ay ana. But I
have not been able to find out a passage where Agrayana is used in the Vedic works to expressly denote the constella
tion of Mrigashiras. I -may, however, refer to the Taittiriya
Sanhita (vi. 4 11. 1.) wherein the vessels ( grahas ) used
for sacrificial purposes are mentioned as beginning with Agrayana and considering the fact that two other vessels are named, as the words themselves denote, after the
planets Shukra and Manthin 5* we might suppose that Agrayana came to be included in the list, not as the name of a
deity, for it. was not such a name, but as denoting, the star which commenced the year, or the half-year. The word graha which in the sacrificial literature denotes vessel has
been used in later astronomical works to denote the planets,
the number of which, including the sun and the moon, is fixed at nine, the same as the number of the vessels used
for sacrificial purpos es. It is not, therefore, improbable that Agrahdyanl or AgraJidyana of the later writers was a transformation of Agray an a, and that Mrigashiras, was so
called in old times for sacrificial purposes. When the Agra

yaneslitis lost tlieir primary meaning, Agrayana or AgraJidyana naturally came to be used more to denote the month when the sacrifice was performed than the Nakshatra at
the beginning of the dyana, thus giving rise to the speculations previously discussed. But in whatever way we may
explain the disappearance of Agrayana in the sense of Mrigashiras in the oldest Vedic works, the fact that in the days of Amara and long before hint of Panini Agrakdyani was used to denote the constellation of Orion remains
unshaken, and we may safely infer therefrom that the^nieaning giten by them was a traditional one.
We have already seen how legends gathered round the (f antelope's head.'* It was the head of Prajapati wishing to violate his daughter, by whrch some understood the dawn, some the sky and some the star Aldebaran ( Ait.
Br. iii, 33). Others built the sto^y of Namuchi upon the same which placed V|itra> at the doors of hell ; while a third
class of legend-makers considered that the death of Prajapati
was voluntary for the sacrificial purposes of the Devas, The following summary of the classical traditions about the death of Orion, taken from Dr. Smith's smaller Classical
Dictionary, will show how strikingly similar they are to the
old Vedic legends.
" The cause of Orion's death is related Variously.
<f According to some> Orion was carried off by Eos (Aurora), (e who had fallen in love with him; but as this was dis*
f< pleasing to the gods, Artemis killed him with an arrow

" for him, asserted that she was unable to hit with her
" arrow a distant point which he showed her in the sea*
" She thereupon took aim, the arrow hit its mark, but the <c mark was the head of Orion, who was swimming in the
u sea. A third account, which Horace follows, states that he
" offered violence to Artemis, and was killed by the godf( dess with one of her arrows/ 3
Thus love, arrow and decapitation which are the three
principal elements in the Vedic legends, are all present in
these traditions. There is another story which says that
Orion was stung to death by a scorpion ; but this is evidently intended to represent the fact that the constella
tion of Orion sets when that of Scorpion rises in the east,
and is therefore of later origin when the 20 diacal signs were adopted by the Greeks.
There are other traditions which point out the position of Orion in the course of the year. The cosmical setting of the constellation was believed to be an indication of stormy
weather and the constellation was called imbrifer or acquosus in the same way as the Shvd in the Vedas is said to corn* mence the year, while Shunasirau are invoked along with.
Parjanya for rain. The German traditions are, however, more specific, and T take the following abstract of the same
by Prof. Kuhn communicated to the late Dr. Rajendral&l
Mitra and published by the latter in his " Indo- Aryans,19
Vol. II., pp. 300-302 :~
"Both in our ancient and modern popular traditions",,
there is universally spoken of the Wild Hunter, who sometimes appears under the name of "Wodan or Goden, and
was, in heathenish times, the supreme god of the ancient German nations. This god coincides, both in character shape with the ancient Kudra of the Vedas (vide p t



VI.] ORION AND HIS BELT.
Now there is a class of traditions in which this ancient god
is said to hunt a stag and shoot at it, just as Rudra in the
Br^hmanas is represented as shooting at the rlski/a and rohit. The stag in German mythology, is the animal of the
god Freyr, who like Prajapati, is a god of the sun, of fertility, &c., so that the shot at that stag is to be compared
with Rudra' s shooting at the Hs%a=Prajapati. I have farther endeavoured to show that some indications exist in
tjie mediaeval penitentials of Germany and England, which give ns to understand that at the close of the old year and at the beginning of the new one ( we call that time ee die
ziwoiften" or the twelve clays, the dvddashdha of the Indians)
there were mnmmeries performed by the country people, in which two persons seem to have heen the principal per
formers, the one of whom was disguised as a stag while the
other was disguised as a hind. Both represented a scene, which mast have greatly interested and amused the people, but very much offended the clergy, by its sordid and hideous character; and from all the indications which are given in
the text, communicated by me (pp. 108-180), we may safely suppose that the chief contents of this representation was
the connection of a stag and a hind (or of an old woman),
which was accompanied by the singing of unchaste songs.
From English customs at the New-Year's Day, we may also infer that the hunter's shooting at this pair was even
a few centuries ago, nay, is even now, not quite forgotten.
Now as the time of the " twelve days * was with our ances
tors the holiest of the whole year, and the gods were believed to descend at that time from heaven, and to visit
the abodes of men, we may firmly believe that this representation also was a scene of the life of the gods. I hope to have thus proved that the Brahmanical and the Germaa



140 TPE ORION. [CHAPTER
traditions are almost fully equal, and I have finally attempted to lay open the idea from which the ancient myth proceeded.
According to my explanations, our common Indor-European ancestors believed that the sun and the day-light ( which
was, so to say, personified under the image of various animals, as a cow or bull, a horse, a boar, a stag), was every day killed in the evening and yet reappeared almost unhurt, the next morning. Yet a (Jecay of his power was clearly visible in the time from midsummer to midwinter,
in which latter time, in the more northern regions, he
almost wholly disappears, ancjin northern Germany, Curing the time of the twelve days, is seldom1 to b$ seen, the
heavens being then usually covered all over with clouds.
I have therefore supposed, it was formerly believed that
the sun was then completely destroyed by a god, who was,
both a god of night and winter as also of storm, Kudra=
Wodan. The relics of the destroyed sun A th$y seem to have
recognised in the brightest constellations of "the winter months, December and January, tfrat is, in Orion and the
surrounding stars. But when they sa.w that they had been,
deceived and the sun reappeared the myth gained th$ further development of the seed of Prajapati, from the remnants of which a new Aditya 9,3 well, as all bright an4
shining gods were produced. I have further shown that
both Greek astronomy and German tradition proved to be in an intimate relation with the Brahmanieal tradition ; for
the former shows us, in almost the same place of the celestial
sphere, a gigantic hunter (Mrigavyadha, Sirius; Orion/ the
hunter Mrigaahiras) : whilst the latter has not yet forgotten
that Saint Hiibertus, the stag-killei% who is nothing feui &
representative of the god Wodan, who had, like Rudira, the power of healing all diseases ( the WmhaUcma * of the



VI.] OElON AND HIS BELT. 141
Vedas) and particularly possessed cures for rnad dogs which not only were his favourite companions; but were also in near connection with the hottest season of the year, when
the declining of the sun begins, the socalled dag-days*3
Here is an equally striking coincidence between the German and the Vedic traditions. The mummeries were
performed " at the close of the old year- and at the beginning of the new one," and the stag and the hunter had therefore
something to do with it. Prof. Kuhn's explanation does not
dear up this point satisfactorily, nor does it give any rea
son why the festivals were celebrated only during thev
twelve days preceding the new year. As regards the decay of the sun's power it must have been observable during the whole season and does not therefore in any way account for
the selection of 12 particular days. As for the duddashdha
of the Indians, it is the period during which a person consecrates himself for a yearly sacrifice and so must naturally precede the commencement of the new year when the
annual sacrifice commences, and I have previously shewn that it represents the difference between the lunar and the
solar years ; in other words, they were whac we may now call the intercalary days added at the end of each year to keep the concurrence of the lunar and the solar measures of time. The German traditions therefore can be better accounted for, if we suppose that they are the reminiscences of a time when the stag and the hunter actually commenced
the year. This also explains why the dog-days were consi
dered so important. When Sirius or the dog-star rose with
the sun at the beginning of the year, the dog-days, or rather the days when the dog was not visible, were the new
year's days, and as such they were naturally invested with
*ati importance which they never lost. I have already



142 THE ORION, [CHAPTER
alluded to tlie passage in tlie Eigveda which states that the
dog awakened the Ribhus, or the gods of the seasons, at the
end of the year, and this appears to me to be the origin of what are still known as dog-days in the western countries.
Owing to the precession of the equinoxes and by neglecting
to maintain the correspondence of the seasons the days now
fail during a period different from the one they did of old,
but such differences we find in all cases where ancient rites
or festivals are preserved. The feast of the manes, which the Parsis and the Hindus seem to have commenced together when the summer solstice occurred in the month o^ Bhadrapada, now no. longer coincides with the summer solstice ; but for that reason we cannot say that it might not
have occurred originally at the summer solstice, especially
when the latter supposition is supported by other reliable
evidence, and gives a better origin of the festival. I am
not therefore disposed to accept Prof. Kuhn's explanation as satisfactory, and am of opinion that the German traditions are the reminiscences of a time when the vernal equinox was
in. Orion, the hunter. We cannot otherwise "account why
the mummeries and festivals should h,aye been celebrated
during the twelve days at the end of the old and the begin*
ning of the new year.
It will, I think, be evident from this that the Greeks and
Germans have preserved the memory of the days when the year commenced with the vernal equinox in Orion. I have
previously shown that the Parsi primitive calendar, as fixed by Dr. Geiger, points to the same conclusion. The Parsis,, tlie Greeks, the Germans and the Indians therefore appear
to have separated after these traditions were formed and
after Orion was figured, and recognised as the Agrayana constellation. I do not think that any more traditional



VI.l OEION AND HIS BELT. 143
coincidences are necessary to establish tile Aryan, origin of the constellation of Orion, as well as its position at the ver
nal equinox in old days. I shall, however^ give one more coincidence which on account of its peculiar nature is alike
interesting and important.
In the Greek mythology Orion, after his death as above
described, was placed among stars, " where he appears as a giant with a girdle, sWord, a lion's skin, and a club. >'"* Now, if as remarked by Plutarch, Orion is an original Greek name, we should find some traces of these various adjuncts of Orion or at least some of them in the old Iranian and Indian works. Do we so find them ? I think we do, only if we look for them with a little more attention and care, for the transformation is more specific and peculiarly out of the way in this case. In the Vedic works Soma is said to be
the presiding deity of the asterism of Mrigashiras. Soma is Haoma with the Parsis* The 26th verse in the Haoma Yasht is as follows :
Frd te Mazddo "barat paitrvanim aivydonghanem steher-paesanghem mainyu-tdstem vanghuhim-daendm Mdzdayasnim. which has been thus rendered by Mr. Mills in his translation of the Zend Avesta, Part III., in the Sacred Books of the
Bast Series (p. 238) t " Forth has Mazda borne to thee,
the star-bespangled girdle, the spirit-made, the ancient one* the Mazda- Yasnian Faith/' Dr. Haug takes faurvanwi
in the original to mean " leading the Paurvas," which latter he believes to be the Persian name for the Pleiades, which
is variously written paru, parvah, parvtn and parviz.-f Thia keen-sighted suggestion of Dr. Haug has been pronounced

.than it denotes. Both Haug and Mills have used the word
* gir,dle
' in the translation. But whether we use 'girdle*
or 'belt,
5 it hardly conveys the idea of the original aivyaon* ghanem. It is a striking instance of how in translations we
sometimes lose the force of the original. Aivyaonghana is a Zend word for the kusti, or* the sacred thread of the
Parsis, which they wear round their waist* The f girdle

or the ' belt ' of Orion is thus said to be his krtsti, and

Prajapati in the Vedic works, otherwise called Yajna. A belt or girdle or a piece of cloth round the waist of Orion or
Yajna will therefore be naturally named after him as yajno*
jpavHa, the upavita or the cloth of Yajna. The term, how*

may naturally be asked whether it owes its character, if ndb

the origin, to the belt of Orion. I think it does on the
following grounds.
The word yajnopavUa is derived by all native scholars
from yafna + upavUa; but there is a difference of opinion as to whether we should understand the compound to
mean an 'upavlta for yajna,' i. e.,for sacrificial purposes, or, whether it is the ' upavlta of yajnaS The former is not in
correct, but authority is in favour of the latter. Thus
the Prayoga-writers quote a smriti to the effect that " the
High Soul is termed yajna by the hotris* ; this is his upavita;
therefore, it is yajnopavita." A mantra, which is recited on
the occasion of wearing the sacred thread means, " I bind you with the upavlta of yajna ;"f while the first half of the
general formula with which a Brahman always puts on his sacred thread is as follows :
The mantra is not to be found in any of the existing
Sanhitas, but is given in the Brahmopanishad and by Baudhayana. This verse is strikingly similar to the verse
quoted above from the Haoma Yasht, It says, " yajno
famta is high and sacred ; it was born with Prajapati, of

146 THE ORION. [CHAPTER
Dr. Haug, while sahaja* born with the limbs of Prajapat-i,
conveys the same meaning as mainyu-tastem. The coincidence between these verses cannot be accidental, and it appears to me that the sacred thread must be derived from
the belt of Orion. UpavUa, from ve to weave, literally means a piece of cloth and not a thread, f It appears, there
fore, that a cloth worn round the waist was the primitive form of yajnopavUa, and that the idea of sacredness was
introduced by the theory that it was to be a symbolic
representation of Prajapati's waist-cloth or belt. In the
Taittiriya Sanhita ( ii. 5. 11. 1.) nivita, prdchinavita, and upavita, three words which at present denote the position
of the sacred thread on the body of a Brahman,, are defined, but the MimansakasJ understand them to apply not to the
sacred thread, as we now wear it, but to a piece of cloth or deer-skin, which everyone must use at the time of
sacrificing. It appears, therefore, that iu the oldest times the Brahtnans wore a piece of cloth or deer-skin and not
a thread. This conclusion is further strengthened by the
fact, that according to the ritual given in the Sutras, no sacred thread is mentioned in the description of the
ceremony of Upanayana; while the investiture with the
Shankarananda's com.* on Brahmopanishad (MS.). * t Cf. Medhatithi on Manu, ii. 44.

thread is looted upon at present as tlie principal part of that?
ceremony, We hare still retained a memory of this old
practice in the performance of obsequies and at the time of performing sacrifices, when a piece of cloth is worn in addition to the sacred thread. Devala* says that oat of the three sacred threads to be worn, one is a substitute for the upper
garment, thus clearly indicating what the old practice was. Bat this is not the place to go into these details. It is
enough for our purpose to notice that yajnopavita originally,meant a piece of cloth, and that in the times of the smriti
writers, it came to be symbolically represented by the sacred
thread, thrice twisted and thrice folded. Here is, however, another difficulty which must be here noticed. The Parsis wear their sacred thread round the waist, while the Br&hmacs usually wear it over the left shoulder and across the body,
leaving the right arm free (i. e. 3 upavita). The Parsis may" thus be said to wear their sacred thread after the manner
of Orion; but in the ca-se of the Brahmans, it may be ques
tioned if their manner of wearing the thread corresponds
to the position of Orion's belt. From the passage in
the Taittiriya Sanhita referred to above, it will, however, be seen that nivtta (and not upavita), is the position of the thread there prescribed for all human actions, or, in other
words, for doing all ordinary business of life. Nivita has been
defined by all later writers to mean, the position of the
sacrecl thread passing around the neck, over both the
shoulders and dropping down in front. A reference to Kumarila BHatta's Tantra Vartika (iii. 4. 2.), will, however,
show that nivtta, also meant " tying round the waist/' and
Kumarila observes that " tying round the waist is the most

convenient position for all kinds of work/'* Ahandagiri and Govindananda in their commentaries on the ShankanVs
Bhashya on the Brahmasutras ( iii. 4, ]9. ), give the same
explanation, from which it appears that the Brahmans, like the Parsis, once wore the thread around the waist, thus
literally girding up their loins when they had to do any work. The sacred thread of the Parsis and the Brahmans thus
seems to be a symbolical representation of Prajapati's girdle or Orion's belt in every respect. The various stages, by which the original piece of cloth round the waist dwindled into
a thread, are interesting and instructive from a ceremonial
point of view, but not being r-elevant to the present inquiry, I do not mention them here.

whole waist. As the practice has long since been obsolete, the verses have been much misunderstood by later writers. The
author of the ^R3f*fcrK does, however, clearly state that there are two ways of wearing the thread, first over the shoulder as

skin, : and all. Every boy, who is the subject of this ceremony, has to wear a mekhald or grass cord round his waist, and
we still put three knots to this cord just over the navel, as
it were, to represent the three stars in the belt of Orion."* In the Vajasaaeyi Sanhita 4. 10, we are told that the knot
of the melthald; when it is worn for sacrificial purposes, is to
be tied with the mantra, " you are the knot of Sorna/'-f*
which Mahidhara explains as " a knot dear to Soma ;'
f but which remembering that we have a similar verse in the
Haoma Yasht, may be naturally interpreted to mean the knot of Soma, the presiding deity over the constellation of Orion
Then every boy whose tip may ana, or the thread-ceremony as it is popularly understood, is performed, must carry with him a stick of the paldsha or the fig-tree and the same
passage in the Vajasaneyi Sanhita says that for sacrificial purposes the stick (danda) is to be taken in hand by the
Mantra, " wood ! be erect and protect me from sin. till
the end of this yajna." Here again Mahidhara interprets
yajna to mean sacrifice for which the staff is takea up.
* In the Prayoga works we have (and we still do so) :
In the S&nkhy&yana Grihya Sutra ii. 2. ,2, we are told that the knots of the mekkald may be one, three or five, and the commentator adds that the knots should be equal in number to one's pravaras. The author of the Sanskara Kaustubha quotes a smriti
to the same effect. But the explanation is unsuited to the first
case, viz., of one knot, and I am inclined to take it to be a later
suggestion.
t



THE ORION, [CHAPTER
But I tliink here also we may trace a reference to
Prajnpati alias Tajna. The third accompaniment of a
newly initiated boy is the deer-skin. Theoretically it is necessary that he should be fully clothed in a deer-skin, but practically we now attach a small piece of deer- skin to a
silk-thread and wear this thread along with the yajnopavita. HeJchald, ajina, and danda ( the girdle, the skin and the staff ) are thus the three distinguishing marks of a newly
initiated boy ; and what could they mean, except that the boy is made to assume the dress of Prajapati as far as possible. To become a Br&hman is to imitate Prajapati, the first of the Brahmans,- Prajapati assumed the form of a
deer, so the boy is clothed in a deer-skin ; Prajapati has a
girdle round his waist (the belt of "Orion), so has the boy his mekhald with three knots over the navel ; and lastly,
Prajapati has a staff, and so the boy must have it too.*
* Dr. Schrader in his Preh, Ant. Ary. Peop., Part iv., Chap. viii., concludes that the primitive dress consisted of a piece of
woolen or linen cloth thrown round the shoulders like a mantle,
and a girdle. The history of yajnopavita, the way of wearing it
as described in Taitt. Am. ii. 1., and Orion's dress, as conceived by
the Greeks, point to the same conclusion. I have already alluded
to the difficulty of explaining how upavtia, which literally means a cloth, came to denote a thread. If yajnopavtta be taken to have
originally meant yajna and upavita, and yajna be further supposed to kave once denoted a girdle this difficulty is removed. Av. yasto

Thus in their Dpanayan ceremony the Brahmans have fully preserved the original characteristic of the dress of Praja
pati or Orion. The Brahman latu (boy) does not, however, carry a sword as Orion is supposed to do, and the skin used by the boy is deer's and not lion's. I cannot account for the first of these differences except on the ground that it might be a later addition to the equipment of Orion, the hunter.
Bat the second might be traced to a mistake similar to that committed in the case of the seven rikshas. The word
Mriga in the Rigveda, means according to Sayana both a lion and a deer, and I have already referred to the doubts entertained by modern scholars as to the animal really denoted by it. Mrigdjma is therefore likely to be mistaken for lion's skin. There is thus an almost complete coincidence of form between Orion as figured by the Greeks and
the boy whose upanayana is recently performed, and who is
thus made to dress after the manner of Prajapati. I do not
mean to say that a piece of cloth was not worn round the waist before the constellation of Orion was so conceived ; on
the contrary, it is more natural to suppose tbat the amount
taken to have meant nothing more than a mantle and a girdle in primitive times and that the primitive people invested Orion with a dress similar to their own. "When Orion came to be looked upon,
as a celestial representation of Prajapati, Orion's dress must have attained the sacred character which we find preserved in the sacred thread of the Parsis and the Brahmans. I, however, know of no passage in the Vedic literature where yajna is used in the sense of a girdle, and hence the above suggestion must be considered as very doubtful. But it may be here mentioned that in Maratht we use the wor&jdnve to denote the sacred thread. This word is
evidently derived from. Sk. yajna, Prakritajanflo. Perhaps we have retained only the first word of the long compound yajnojpavUa.

dence of details above given does, in my opinion, fully establish the fact that the sacred character of a batu's dress was derived from what the ancient priests conceived
to be the dress of Prajapati. With these coincidences of
details, still preserved, it is impossible to deny that the configuration of the constellation of Orion, is of Aryan origin and that the Hellenic, the Iranian and the Indian Aryas must have lived together when these traditions and legends were formed.
And now it may be asked that if the Eastern and the Western legends and traditions of Orion are so strikingly
similar, if not identical, if the dress and the form of the constellation are shewn to have been the same amongst the
different sections of the Aryan race, and if the constellations at the feet and in front of Orion Canis Major and
Canis Minor, Tuon and Prokuon,* Shvan and Prashvan, the Dog and the Foredog are Aryan both in name and traditions ; in short, if the figure, the costume, the attendants and
the history of Orion are already recognised as Aryan, is it not highly probable that the name, Orion, should itself be a transformation or corruption of an ancient Aryan word ?
prion is an old Greek name. Homer in the fifth book of
Odyssey speaks of the bold Orion and the traditional coin
cidences, mentioned above, fully establish the probability of Plutarch's statement thab the word is not borrowed from a noti-Aryan source. Two of the three names, mentioned by Plutarch Canis (Kuon) and Ursa (ArJdos) have agaia been phonetically identified with Sanskrit shvan and rikshag,
and we may, therefore, legitimately expect to find Orion similarly traced back to an Aryan original. The task, ILOW

everts not so easy as it appears to be at the first sight-. The Greek mythology does not give us any help in the
solution of this question- It tells us that a hunter by name
Orion was transformed after his death into this constellation
which consequently came to be called after him. Bnfc this
is surely no satisfactory explanation. Who is the hunter that was so transformed ? There are many mythological proper names in Greek which can be traced back to their
Aryan originals, and why should Orion be not similarly derived ? The story obviously points to the Vedic legends of Rudra, who is said to be still chasing Praj&pati in the
heavens. The Vedic legend has fully preserved all the three elements in the story the hunter Rudra, the dog and the antelope's head, while the Greeks appear to have retained only the hunter and the dog with nothing to hunt !
QBut that does not, preclude us from discovering the
identity of these legends, and the question is whether we can suggest a Sanskrit word which -will give us Orion
according to the already established phonetic rules. I know of no name of Rudra from which Onon can be so derived;
But if we look to the names of the constellation of
Mrigashiras, we may, I think, in the absence of any better
snggestion, provisionally derive Orion from Sanskrit Agrayana the original of Agrahdyana. The initial long d in Sanskrit may be represented by 'omega in Greek as in Sk;
dma, Gt. dmoSi Sk. dshu, Gr. okus, and the last word ayana
may become ion in Greek. It is not, however, so easy to account for the dropping of g before r in the body of th4
word. Comparison of Sk. grdvan with Gk. laos and of Ski
ghrdna with Gk. ris, rinos, shews that the change may takf place initially, but scholars whom I have consulted think
that there is no instance in which it takes place

must remain content with simply throwing out the suggestion for what it is worth. I have shewn that traditional
coincidences clearly establish the possibility of the Aryan origin of Orion, and if I have not hit upon the correct word
that does not affect my argument. My case does not, in
{fact, rest on phonetic coincidences. I rely principally upon certain statements in the Vedic works, which indicate that the vernal equinox was once in Orion, and I wanted to shew and I think I have shewn it that there is sufficient evidence in the Greek and Parsi legends to corroborate the statement in the Vedic works about the Phalguni-fullmoon being once the first night of the year.

identifying Gk. Orion with Sk. Agrayana, see App. to this essay.
t By the bye it may be here remarked that we can perhaps
better account for the names Ahuramazda and Ahriman on the theory that the vernal equinox was then in Orion, the
winter solstice in Uttara Bhadrapada and the summer solstice
in Uttara Phalgirat The presiding deities of the last two Nakshatras

The mummeries and festivals amongst the Germans can also be more satisfactorily accounted for, while above all, the form, the dress and the traditions of Orion may be now better traced and understood. I have already in the
previous chapter shown that even the Vedic legends, especially those in the later works, can be simply and naturally
explained on the assumption we have made regarding the position of the equinoxes in the days of the Rigveda. (The hypothesis on which so many facts, legends, and traditions
can be so naturally explained, may, in the absence of a better theory, be fairly accepted as correct without more
proof^But in the present case we can go still further and
adduce even direct evidence, or express Vedic texts, in its
point, would come to be regarded as the supreme, ruler of the gods,
while A.ryaman would be the king of the evil spirits. Therefore we
may suppose that the names Ahura-Mazda and Ahriman, if not
actually derived from these words, were, at least modelled after
them. Amongst the names of the Yedic deities Ahir-Budhnya is
the only word, both the component members of which, are declined
as in Ahura-Mazda. Spent-Mainyus and Anghra-Mainyus is a distinct pair by itself; and besides the difficulty of deriving Ahriman from Aiigkra-Mainyus, there seems to be no reason why Ahriman, if so derived, should be contrasted with Ahnra-Mazda
($e<?Phil. Mazd. Eelig. by Casartelli, trans, by F. J, Dastur Jamasp
Asa, 71, 72, pp. 54>-6_) Pa,rsi mythology has another deity named Airyamaa, and as this word is derived from Sanskrit Aryaman, it tnay be objected that same word cannot be said to have also
given the name for the evil spirit. I do not think that the objection
is well founded. Of. Andra(Sk. Indra) and Verethraghna ( Sk. Vritrahan ) both of which are the names of the same deity in Sanskrit, but one of which has become an evil spirit in the Avesta.

attention to the remarks of Prof. Max Miiller who objected
to the conclusion based entirely on the Vedanga Jyotisha on the ground that no allusion to the position of the Kritti
kas \vas to be found in the Vedic hymns. We can now
account for this silence; for how can the hymns, which appear to be sung when the sun was in Orion at the begin
ning of the year, contain any allusion to the period when the vernal equinox fell in the Krittikas ? This could have
been easily perceived if, instead of confining to the contro
versy about the position of the Krittikas and endeavouring to find out if some clue to the date of the Veda could bo obtained from the determination of the original number and
source of the Nakshatras, scholars had pushed their inquiries further back and examined the Vedic hymns in the same
critical spirit. It would not have been difficult in that
case to discover the real meaning of the Vedic verse which
states that "the dog awakened the Ribhus at the end of the
year/' I have in a previous chapter already referred to the
verses in the Rigveda regarding the position of Jama's dogs and the death of Namuchi. These passages,, as well as the
description of Vriha or the dog-star risiag before the sun after , crossing the eternal waters; the terminus of the
Devayana (Rig. i. 105. 11.), sufficiently indicate the position of the equinoxes in those days. In the next chapter I propose, to discuss and examine two other important passages from the Rigveda, which directly bear out the statement in.
the Taittirya Sanhita with which we have started, vi%>, that the Phalgunf fall-moon commenced the year at the winter
solstice in days previous to those of the Taittirya SanMt4 and the Brahrnanas.

find that some of the Nakshatras are specifically named,
such as Arjtini and Ayhd in Rig. x. 85. 18, while the same
hymn speaks generally of the Nakshatras, and the motions of the moon and the sun as causing the seasons. In Rig
i. 164 we have again several references to the seasons, the year and the number of days contained in it (verse 48) and
according to Yaska, perhaps to the ayanas (Nirukta 7. 24), I have in a previous chapter referred to the passages in the Rigveda, which mention the Devayana and tlie Pitriyana, the old names of the ay anas beginning with the
vernal equinox ; and there is, therefore, no objection to understand the above verse (i. J64. 48) as alluding to the
black or the Pitriyana. The intercalary month is mentioned in Rig. i. 25. 8, while in i. 24. 8 Varuna is said to have constructed a broad path for the sun, which appears
evidently to refer to the Zodiacal belt. I am further in
clined to think that the path of rita (Rig. i. 41. 4) which is mentioned several times in the Eigveda, where the
Adifcyas are said to be placed (s. 85. 1), and wherein Sarama, discovered the cows of Indra (v. 45. 7, 8) refers to
the same broad belt of the Zodiac which the luminaries, as observed by the Vedic bards, never transgressed. It was
so to speak their 'right' way, and therefore called rita,
which though literally derived from ri, to go, soon came to
mean lie 'right* path, the circle of which exists for ever, or
rather exists and exists (varvarti) in the vault of the heavens (Rig. i. 164. U). Prof. Ludwig goes further and holds
that the Eigveda mentions the inclination of the ecliptic
with the equator (i. 110. 2) and the axis of the earth (x. 86.
4). It is now generally admitted that the seven rifohas
were also known and named at this time. The mention of
a hundred physicians in Rig. i. 24. 9 may again be taken

to represent tlie ftsfcerism of Shala-ljliibhalz or Shata
tdrakd, presided over by Varnna according to the later lists of the Nakshatras in the Taittirrya Brahrnana.
The fortieth hymn in the fifth Mandala of the Bigveda is still more important in this connection. It shows that an eclipse of the sun was then first observed with any preten
sions to accuracy by the sage Atri.* It is thus that I
understand the last verse in the hymn which, after describing the eclipse, says, cc Atri alone knew him (the sun) none else could/ 3 This observation of the solar eclipse is noticed
in the Sankhyayana (24, 8) and also in the Tandya Brah
mana (iv. 5. 2; 6. 14) 3 in the former of which it is said to have occurred three days previous to the Visliuvdn (the autumnal equinox). The observation thus appears to have attracted considerable attention in those days. It seems
to have been a total eclipse of the SUB, and the stars became
visible during the time, for I so interpret the- expression, bhuvandni adidJiayuJt in verse 5. In verse 6 we are told
* Prof. Ludwig has tried to deduce the date of the hymn from
this circumstance. But the attempt is a failure as shewn by Prof.
Whitney (see the Proceedings of the American Oriental Society,
Yol. XIII., pp. 17-22 ). As the eclipses recur in the same order after
a certain period, we cannot use such facts for chronological purposes
without knowing the geographical position of the place where the
eclipse occurred, and even then the conclusion will be correct only if it
can be shown on independent grounds that such a phenomenon did not
occur at that place during several centuries before or after the date
we determine. I, therefore, simply use the hymn for the purpose
of showing that an eclipse of the sun was observed in those day sin such
a way as to leave a record behind. It would be difficult to deduce any
other reliable conclusion from it even upon the assumption, not known
and hence not used by Prof. Ludwig, that the vernal equinox was
then in Orion and that the eclipse occurred three days before the
autumnal equinox as described in the Brahnumas. I cannot, however, accept the suggestion that the hymn may be understood as referring
to the obscuration of the sun by clouds.

verse or mantra/ 3 But the verse wherein these words occur
as itself the sixth, and Sayana has to explain that by " fourth"

" The explanation may be good from the ritualistic point of view, but it appears to me to be
t]uite unsatisfactory otherwise. I could rather interpret
tur'h/ena brahmand to mean " by means of turiya" Turiya is mentioned in modern astronomical works as a name for
an instrument called quadrant (SiddMnta Shiromani xi. 15), and though we may not suppose the same instrument to
have existed ia the old Vedic days, yet there seems to be
too objection to hold thafc it may have meant some instrufetent of observation. The word brahma is no doubt used
to denote a mantra, but it may also mean knowledge or the
means of the acquiring such knowledge. In Rig. ii. 2. 7 Sayana has himself interpreted braJtma to mean some ct act
or action; " and I see no reason why we should not understand the phrase turiyena brahmand in the above hymn to
mean "by the action of turiya" or, in other words, "by means of turiya" and thus give to the whole hymn a simple and natural appearance, rather than endeavour to interpret it
after the manner of the Red Indians, who believed that
Columbus averted the calamity of the eclipse by prayers.
The peasants of the Vedic times, some scholars might
argue, cannot be" considered to be more civilized than the
"Bed Indians ; but in so arguing they forget the fact that
tiier e must be a Columbus, who would, by his superior

Sayana's explanation, as I have above observed, may be good
from the ritualistic standpoint ; but we cannot, for other
purposes, accept an interpretation which makes the ' fourth* to mean the ' tenth J verse of the hymn 1 Thus understood the hymn clearly indicates that at the time when the
observation was taken the Vedic priests were tolerably well
acquainted with the elementary astronomical facts. It is, however, suggested that the planets were unknown in these
days. I am unable to accept even this statement. It is
impossible to suppose that the Vedic poets, who constantly watched and observed the various Nakshatras in the Zodiac,
should not have noticed planets like Venus, Jupiter, or Saturn^ which outshine many of the Nakshatras in brilliancy. The periodical appearance of Venus in the west and the east* and especially its rising only to a certain altitude followed by its regress, are facts too striking to remain unnoticed even
by the superficial observers of the heavens. But we mast
not go on mere probabilities. The hymns of the Rigveda are before us, and though probabilities may serve the purpose of determining the direction of our search, yet if we cannot find any reference to the planets in the Vedic works themselves, we must give up the notion that they were known to
the poets of these hymns. There is no question that planets were known in the days of the Brahmanas. In the Taittiriya
Br&hmana (iiu 1. 1* 5) we are told that Brihaspati (Jupiter)
was first born * near the asterism of Tishya, and to this
day the conjunction of Tishya and Jupiter is considered as
highly auspicious in the astrological works. We have, however, to look for any allusion to the planets in the Rigveda
. I This reminds us of

not b considered as sufficiently explicit to denote the five
planets; * but what shall we say to the mention of Shukra and Manthin together in Rig. iii. 32. 2 and ix. 46. 4 ? They seem to be evident references to the vessels called Shukra and Manthin used in sacrifices and have been so interpreted' fey the commentators. Bat as I have before observed, the
vessels in the sacrifice themselves appear to have derived their names from the heavenly bodies and deities known at
the time. It is generally conceded that the sacrificial arrangements more or less represent the motions o the sanf &&d the chief events of the year. In other words,
tte yearly sacrifice is nothing but a symbolical representation 0r -rather Imitation of the sun's yearly course. If so, it is

applied to vessels, in the Kigveda is a clear indieatidn o the planets being then discovered. There is, how.ever, in
my opinion, a more explicit reference to a planet in th0 Bigveda which does not seem to have yet been noticed. In the tenth Mandala we have a hymn (123) dedicated tp
Vena^ which according to Yaska denotes a deity of the *tniddier region. Yaska (Nirukta 10. 38) derives the word
from ven ' to love/ f to desire, ' and explains it as denoting,
as his commentator Durgacharya says, " loved by all; n *
while the hymn itself contains such expressions as the " son
of the sun/' ** on the top of rita," " comes out of the ocean
like a wave, " t &c., which have been variously interpreted by the commentators. But from all these facts I think we have herein the original Aryan name of Venus. The word,
'or rather the meaning I have here proposed, is entirely lost in the Sanskrit literature, but considering the fact
that the Latins named the planet as Venus, while the word
t**eiszeB&tF'-
cannot be satisfactorily derived from any Latin root/} titeera can be BO objection to identify Venus with the Vena (nom. sin, Venas) in the Vedic works. In the Latin
mythology Venus is the goddess of love, and this we can now easily account for, as the name of the Vedic deity is derived
.from a. root which means " to desire, " " to love." I may
again point out that the hymn of Vena in the Rigveday is
* See Mahidhara on Vaj* San. 7. 16. Some consider that ihe root is Fin and not Few.. . . .
f This reminds one of the tradition of Aphrodite who, in Sreek mythology, is said to be sprung from the foam of the sea.

used In sacrifices at the time, when the priest' takes tip the Tessel Shnkra in the sacrificial ceremonies.* Katyayana,
indeed, mentions the optional use of the hymn for taking
up the vessel of Manthin.t But that does not much alter
the position, for, when the meaning of the word was utterly
forgotten the hymn might come to be used for a different purpose in addition to the previous one. The fact, that the Vena hymn was used in taking up the Shnkra vessel
is, therefore, an important indication of its old meaning, and
when we find the name actually preserved till now indicating the planet Venus, and that this name cannot be
satisfactorily derived in any other way, we might fairly
infer that Vena of the Rigveda is Venus of the Latin
Mythology* As regards the change of gender we need not eonslder it to be a serious objection inasmuch as not only
Venus, but also the moon has changed in gender in its passage to Europe. As a further proof of the statement that the planets, or at any rate Shukra, was discovered and named in the primitive period, I refer to the Greek word Kupris (Latin Cypris) which means Venus. The word cau fee easily identified with Sanskrit Shukra which, according
to the well-established phonetic rules, becomes Kupro in

jnriamai, Sk. &r-ttmt, I purchase. As Venus was supposed
to be a feminine deity in Europe Kupros was naturally changed into Kupis. Thus, both the Latin and the Greek names of the deity may be traced back to the Vedic Vena
and Shukra, and we may therefore hold that the planet was discovered and named before these races separated* I
know that European lexicologists derive Kupris from Kupros the Greek name of the island of Cyprus where Venus
was said to be much worshipped and that Cyprus again is
supposed to have received its name from the trees, cypresses, in which it abounds ! But the explanation, which gives no
derivation for the name of the tree, seems to me to be
quite unsatisfactory. If Aphrodite was known to the Greeks in the primitive times it is more natural to derive the name of the island from the name of the deity. In course of time this original connection between the name of the deity and
that of the island may have been forgotten, and Greek writers regarded Eupris as born in Cyprus. But we must receive
these derivations of Greek mythological proper names with great caution as most of them have been suggested at a
time when comparative Philology and comparative Mytho
logy were unknown. Latin cuprum meaning f copper * is again said to be derived from Cyprus (Gk. Eupras), but it does not affect our argument, for whatever be the reason for
giving the name to the island, once it wa^ named Cyprus or
Kupros, many other words may be derived from it without
any reference to the reasons for which the island was so called.
Some of the reasons given above may be doubtful, trot on the whole I am inclined to hold that the Vedic Eishis were not as ignorant of the broad astronomical facts

their yearly course noted the bearing of their motions on
the division of time, fixed the length of the solar year and endeavoured to make the lunar correspond with it. The
Nakshatras and thsir rising and setting also appear to have been, duly observed. It was perceived that the sun and the moon and such of the planets as they had discovered never
travelled out of a certain belt in the heavens, called rita ;
while the eclipses of the sun and the moon also received due
attention and notice. Men, who were acquainted with these
facts, would naturally be able to fix the beginning of tlie months and the year by the stars that Tose at the time, and though we cannot suppose the Vedic bards to have been in
tie possession of any accurate astronomical instruments, yet it was not difficult for them to decide roughly by simple observation when .the day and the night were equal, OF when the sun turned to the north, either from the solstitial
or from the equinoctial point. The knowledge implied by these observations may appear to be too much for a Vedic poet in the opinion of those who have formed their notions
of primitive humanity from the accounts of savages in Africa or the Islands of the Pacific. But as observed before
/we must give up these a priori notions of primitive
Jhumanity. in the face of evidence supplied by the h^mns of the Bigveda. It is on this evidence that we have to form
our judgment of the primitive Aryan civilization, and if that
evidence is found conflicting with our prepossessions, thj& latter must be given up. In what follows I shall therefore assume the capacity of a Vedic bard to make the simple observations above mentioned.

i. 161. 13) ; and the first question that arises in this connection is, who are the Ribhus ? Referring to Nirukha
(11. J5 and 16) we find that native scholars consider that the three Ribhus Ribhu, Vibhvan and Vaja were the sons of Sudhanvan and that having rendered wonderous services to the Gods they gained divine honors and a share in the sacrifice and immortality.* But even Yaska does ,not seem to be satisfied with this explanation. There are
several hymns in the 'Kigveda wherein the deeds of the Ribhus are described (Rig. iv. 33-37; i. 20. 110. Ill and 161), and in most of them the Ribhus are spoken of aa
working in close connection with, the year (samvatsam or
samvatsara}. Thus in the Rigveda i. 110. 4 they are said to have commenced work at the end of the year, and in iv* 33. 4. they are described as engaged, for the whole year
(samvatsam ), in reviving the cows (the rays of the sun) <
The Ribhus are further mentioned as resting in the house
of Agohya, the " unconcealable " sun-god for twelve days at the end of their course (Rig. iv. 33. 7). In Ait. Br. iii. 30
they are described as sun's neighbours or pupils (ante vdsds)* while in. Rig. iv. 51. 6 their work is said to be done by the
dawn. , Ya^ska therefore considers that the Ribhus also re
presented, the rays of the sun, and in this he is followed by Sayana. But the explanation does not account for the number.
of the Ribhus who are said to be three brothers. We must therefore go a step further and hold that the Ribhus did
BOt merely represent the rays of the sun generally, but the three seasons, as connected with them, as several European,

Ribhus" are told to rejoice with the seasons (Ritus) and this
supports the latter view. In Eig. i. 15. 10, Dravinoda is said to be the fourth companion of the seasons and the
Shatapatha Brahmana (xiv. 1. 1. 28) expressly states that there are three seasons. It is therefore generally believed that this was the old division of the year, and that the number of the seasons was increased as the Aryas travelled further from their original home.* The three Eibhus,
representing the three seasons, may thus be said to be
engaged, throughout the whole year, in doing wonders for the gods and received as guests in the house of Agohya at
the end of their course. " Here they spend twelve days in
enjoyment; then the course begins anew, and anew the earth brings forth fruit, the streams flow; plants cover the
heights, and waters the depths."f And now comes the* verse (Rig. i. 16 L 13) on which I rely:
Here the Eibhus, awakened from their sleep and rest for
twelve days, ask " Agohya ! Who is it that awakened us ?"J
The goat (the sun) replies that it is the " hound. " Sayana
understands shvdnam to mean ' wind, ' but there is na
authority for it and the meaning is perfectly unnatural. In fact Sayana may be said to have failed to interpret the

verse correctly. Ludwig and Grassmann both translate ifc by
f hound/ but neither of them explains what it signifies.
There is again some difference of opinion as to whether the word samvatsare should be taken with bodhayitdram
or with vyakhyata. But whichsoever construction we adopt the meaning remains the same, since it is the same thing if the Ribhns are said to be awakened at the end of the year and then commenced their conrse, or they awakened and then looked up at the beginning of the new year, or, in
other words, commenced their new-year's course. Practically,
therefore, all agree in holding that the awakening of the Ribhns here referred to is their awakening at the end of
the year, after they have enjoyed sound sleep and rest in the house of Agohya for twelve ( intercalary) days, and the only question that remains is, who is the hound or the dog
that awakens them ? We have seen that the Ribhus were the genii of the seasons and that as companions of the sun they worked wonders during the whole course of the year. But as it was a lunar year, 12 days were intercalated at the
end of each year to make it correspond with the solar year. These 12 days belonged neither to the old nor to the new year, and the Ribhus were therefore naturally believed to
suspend work during this neutral period and spend it in
rest and enjoyment in the house of Agohya. When the
whole legend has thus a chronological signification it is
natural to hold that the hound, here alluded to, must be
some constellation in the heavens, and if so, after what has been said in the previous chapters about it, what could it be except Canis Major or the Dog-star V The end of the
year here referred to is evidently the end of the three
seasons, represented by the three Ribhus, and we must, therefore, take it to mean the end of the equinoctial yeat 22



170 THE ORION. [CHAPTER
or tlie beginning of Vasanta, the first of tlie seasons. Durga
charya in Ms commentary on Nirukta 11. 16 explains the phrase samvatsare ( in Rig. i. 110. 4 ) in the same way. As I have already discussed the subject before,* I do not here repeat the grounds on which I hold that the year, in
primitive times, commenced with the vernal equinox.
Prof. Ludwig has made a happy suggestion that dbhogaya, which the Ribhus are said to desire (Rig i. 110. 2) before they commence their career and reach the house of the
sun, should be interpreted in its ordinary sense to mean, the bend or the inclination of the ecliptic with the equator.
Our investigation, based upon, independent facts, leads us to the same conclusion. In short, the whole story of the
Ribhus, as we find it recorded in the Rigveda, directly establishes the fact that at the time when this legend was formed the year commenced with the vernal equinox in
Canis Major or the Dog-star. It is highly improbable, if not impossible, to give any other reasonable interpretation to the verse in question, whether we understand the Ribhus to mean the three seasons of the year or the rays of the sun as Yaska and Suyana have done. With the vernal equinox
near the Dog-star, the winter solstice would fall on the full
moon in Phalguna and Mrigashiras would head the list of the Nakshatras. Our interpretation of the verse in question
is, therefore, fully warranted by the traditions about the
ancient year-beginnings given in the Taittirfya Sanhita and the Br&hmanas. Let us now examine the too much and too long misunderstood or rather not-understood hymn of Vrish&kapi
in the tenth Mandala of the Rigveda. As there is only one
hymn in the Rigveda which gives the story, it is not so

easy, as in the case of the Bibhus, to determine the nature of the deity, and hence various conjectures have been made
by scholars as to its origin, character and meaning. The deities appear both in the masculine and in the feminine
form, Vrishakapi and Vrishakapyi. Amara* considers that Vrishakapi means either Vishnu or Shiva, and Vrishakapayi either Lakshm! or Gaurf. In the Brihad-devatH
Vrishakapi is said to represent the setting sun, and
Vrishakapayi the gloaming-f Yaska (12. 27) would derive the word so as to mean the sun who shakes (the world) with his rays, and his commentator observes that the god showers mist or dew and shakes the animate world. Modern speculations about the derivation and the meaning of the name may be found in Bhanu Dikshita's commentary
on Amara (iii. 3. 130). Prof. Mas Miiller, in one place,J observes that ' e it is difficult, on seeing the name of Vrisha
kapi, not to think of JBrika/paeos, an Orphic name of Profo

kapi (Vrishan, bull, irrigator ; Kapi, ape, tremulous) is not much clearer than that of EriJcapaeos." However, if the
comparison be correct, we may, I think, take it as confirm, ing the identification of Vrishakapi with the sun proposed
by several scholars, native and European. In fact, there
seems to be a general agreement that Vrishakapi represents
the sun in one form or the other. But this alone does not account for all the incidents recorded in the hymn. I
would, therefore, further suggest that VrisMkapi be understood as representing the sun at the autumnal equinox,
when he may be rightly said to shake off the rains, inas| much as the equinox falls at the end of the rainy season.
I have previously shown that the conception of Vishnu and { Shiva can be traced to the Vedic Vishnu and Rudra, and
these latter may be taken as the types or tho embodiments
of the mild and terrible aspects of nature at the vernal and
5 the autumnal equinox. If VrisMkapi in later mythology
i has therefore come to denote Vishnu and Shiva, according
to Amara, the meanings are consistont with the supposition
that in the Vedas Vrish&kapi represents the sun at the
I equinoxes. In the hymn itself, Vri&hakapi is said to have I assumed the form of a yellow antelope whose head IndrSni
is described to have cut off. This circumstance serves to
guide us in at once fixing the position of Vrishakapi in the
|
heavens. It is the same antelope's head that has given rise to
I so many myths. When the position of V ri^hdkapi is thus fixed,
| it would not be difficult to understand the various incidents

described in the hymn. But without further anticipating

now proceed to examine the hymn itself, We shall then see whether the assumption which we have made regarding *

There are twenty-three verses in the hymn ; and of these
3, 4, 5 and 20, 21 and 22 have a direct bearing on the
question we are discussing. But to understand these verses properly, it is necessary to discuss most of the other verses in the hymn, and I shall therefore examine the hymn verse
by verse. I have already remarked that the hymn is one of
those which have not yet been properly understood. Some of the verses have been explained by Yaska, but he has nownere tried to give us the bearing of the whole story
described in the hymn. S&yana's commentary is very often simply verbal, and in many places he too is not certain about the meaning, while the AnukramanJ has been several
times disregarded by S&yana himself. On the other hand, Ludwig, Grassmann, and several other European scholars
have tried in their own way to explain the legend or the
story embodied in the hymn, and the latest attempt of the kind is that of Piscel and Geldner in their Vedic studies, Vol. VII., Part I.* These scholars hold that the hymn
* I am indebted for this information to Dr. B. G. Bhand&rkar, who kindly undertook to explain to me the views of German
scholars on this point.



176 TEE ORION. [CHAPTER
narrates a legend current in old days. In other words, they take it, and I think rightly, to be a historic hymn. Bat the
question, what does the legend signify, or how did it originate, still remains unsolved. Piscel and G-eldner
understand the hymn to mean that Vrishakapi went down to the south and again returned to the house of Indra.
But even then the bearing of the legend is but imperfectly explained. The occurrence of such words as ddsa, drya and
parshu in the hymn have led some to suppose that the hymn
records the story of a struggle between the Aryan and the
non-Aryan races. But the hypothesis hardly explains the various incidents in the story, and the legend may therefore
be said to be but still imperfectly understood. Under such
circumstances any suggestion which explains the hymn
better is at least entitled to a hearing. It is admitted that
the hymn is a dialogue between Indra, Indram, and Vrishakapi, a son of Indra as they call him.* But there is a great
divergence of opinion in assigning different verses to their deities. I shall examine these points while discussing the verses.
Katyayana in his Sarvanukramani says f
Upon this the Vedartha-dipika by Shadgurushishya has, Nr: 1 The verses of the hymn are then distributed amongst the speakers as follows :
Indra, 1, 8, 11, 12, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 ; Indram, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18 ; and Yrishakapi, 7, 13, 23. The same distribution is given in the Brihad-devat& by Shaunaka. Piscel and Geldner in
troduce Vrishakapayi in the dialogue and distribute the verses
somewhat differently thus, Indra, 1, 3, 8, 12, 14, 19, 201

JndrAnt 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 16, 21 ; Vrishakapi 7, 10 13 ; and VrisMkapAyi, 11, 15, '17, 18. Verses 22 and 22 are supposed to* be
addressed by a stranger, the narrator.



VIL] EIEHUS AND VRISHAKAPI. 177
VERSE 1. The verse has been differently interpreted "by different writers. Yaska (13. 4.) interprets it as
referring to the rays of the sun, which ( the rays ) deem
themselves perfectly independent of the luminary by which they were sent out. Say ana ascribes it to Indra who savs
" that sacrificers, allowed by me to sacrifice fco Vrishakapi,
have disregarded me, but are praising the lord Vrishakapi who is delighted, as my friend, in the sacrifices, where
plenty of Soma is used; [but notwithstanding] this Indra is superior to all.' 3 Madhava Bhatta, whom. Sayana mentions with respect, however thinks otherwise. He considers that the verse is addressed by Tndrani to Indra, when she
.perceived that the sacrificers have ceased to sacrifice on
account of the oblations being spoiled by an animal repre
senting Vrishakapi. He would, therefore, thus interpret
the verse. Says Indrani, " In places of plenty where lord
Vrishakapi revels, sacrificers have given up sacrificing and disregarded Indra. My friend Indra is superior to all/'"
When the very first verse is thus interpreted in three
different ways,* one can easily attribute the difference to an
imperfect perception of the bearing of the whole hymn.
To me Madhava Bhatta alone appears to have taken into
consideration the verses that follow. Thus the fifth verse
of the hymn states that the things of Indrani were spoilt by
Vrishakapi in the form of an animal, and consequently he was beheaded. I should, however, like to refer to verse 21,
wherein Vrish&kapi is told that when he appears again, sacrifices would be performed. This evidently implies that they were stopped before and were to be commenced again
on tibfe tfe-t{^earance of Vrishikapi. The first verse there

abandon or to allow, but the former is its natural meaning,
and when verse 21 in the same hymn can be easily explain
ed by taking the former meaning of srij with vi, it would be straining the words if we put a different inter
pretation on them. I am, therefore, disposed to interpret the verse after the manner of Madhava Bhatta, except the
last sentence.
Bnt why should sacrifices be stopped ? What has
Vrishakapi to do with them ? These are very important
questions, and I am sure that had they been properly answered, there would have been no difficulty in interpreting the hymn. In verse 3 we are told that Vrishakapi?
spoken of in this hymn, has the form of a yellow antelope. ) 1 In verse 5 Indrani is prepared to cut off his head, because tf**' he offended her, and in the preceding verse ( 4th ) a dog
is said to be let loose upon him. These facts an antelope
,! with the head cut off, and a dog closely following him are

*"
quite sufficient for the purposes of identification. They
shew that the whole story is based upon the " antelope's
head " we have previously discussed ; and bad Yaska and
Sayana known that there is a constellation called dog iu the
heavens by the side of Mrigashiras, I feel certain that they would not have hesitated to recognize in Vrishakapi, the
sun as jtpES8fi&ted by the constellation of Orion. But all
traces of the dog, as a constellation, having been lost in the Sanskrit literature, neither Yaska nor Sayaiia could find any clue to the true meaning of the hymn. This is not,
however, the only place where Yaska has been obliged to
invent extraordinary interpretations. Not knowing that
the dog represente^La,,star, he has proposed (Mrakta 5. 20), tha 'Vrika, sTiouTd be understood to mean '"the 'moon,**
while usually it means a wolf or a wild dog, and it appears to



VIL] EIBHUS AND VSI8HJtKA.PI. . I
me that a similar mistake has been also committed here*
Comparative Mythology and Greek Astronomy have, however, thrown further light on the subject, and we mnst now
try to interpret the hymn accordingly. Vrishakapi must, therefore, be taken, to represent the sun in Orion.
,; Bat even supposing . that Vrishakapi thus represents the sun in Orion, why should the sacrifices be stopped on his
account? The identification of Vrishakapi with Orion at
once furnishes us with a solution of this question. We have already seen that the dog is said to commence the new year in Rig. i. 161. 13; and since Canis and Orion are close to each other, Orion may also be said to have commenced
the year. The Devayana, therefore, extended in those days from the heliacal to the acronycal rising of Orion ; that is> when Orion rose with the sun, it was the vernal equinox,
the beginning of the Devayaua, and six months after, when it rose at the beginning of night, it was the autumnal
equinox, the end of the Devayana. Now all Devacereinoaies and sacrifices could be begun and performed only
during the Devayana, * or, as we find it in later traditions* only in the Uttar&yana. The acronycal rising of Orion was thus a signal to stop such ceremonies, and oblations could
properly be said to have been spoilt by the appearance of this constellation at the beginning of night.t But above
all the burden of tlie song " Indr# is utiara of all,'? becomes specially appropriate in this case. The word utiara
* Jaimiai Mim. Dar, vi. 8. 23, auct other authorities cited in

t If Vrit-ra is correctly identified with the constellation of
Mrigashiras, we may on the same theory also explain why he is
called Makhasyu in Rig. x. 73. 7. The appearance of Mriga, at
the beginning of nisht, indicated the commencement of the Dakshi*
nay ana when sacrifices were stopped. Vritra alias Mriga might
thus come to be regarded as a destroyer of the sacrifices

obes not here mean superior, but f6 upper'* implying that Indra is in the upper or the northern portion of the universe,
though the sun or Vrishakapi may go down. I would
therefore translate the first verse thus :
" Where my friend
Vrishakapi rejoiced in the wealth of the Aryans, they gave up sacrificing and did not respect Indra. Indra is (how
ever) in the upper (i. e., northern) part of the universe/'*
VERSE 2..Indra is here reproached for following up Vrishakapi, though he has offended Iridrani. Says sli-e to Indra : 6< Indra ! (how is it that) you run down fast after
Vrishakapi and do not go anywhere else to drink sorna. Indra is, &c. ?) The word pard in this verse seems to denote the region where Vrishakapi has gone. Pardvat is often said to be the place in the distant or lower portion of the sphere, and is thus contrasted with arv&vat (Rig- viii. 13. 15). In Big. viii. 33. 10 Indra is said to be Vrisha in the pardcat and
also in the arudvat regions. Indra is again very often
spoken of as going to distant regions to see whether Vyitra
s duly killed. The same fact appears to be here expressed
in a different form,
VERSE 3. Sayana following the Armkramani, understands the verse as addressed by Indrani to Indra. Ludwig and Grassmann, on the other hand, take ifc to be addressed
by Indra to Indrani: and this construction seems better
than that of Sayana. It may, however, be here, once for all, remarked that though scholars thus differ in assigning
verses to different deities, yet it does not, on the whole,
materially alter the legend incorporated in the iiymn.
* If Vrishakapayl is to be at all introduced in the dialogue, we
may assign this verse to her. The phrases, " my friend " and "did
not respect Indra, " would be more appropriate ia her mouth than
in that of Indra or Indrami.

Says Indra: " What lias this Vrish&kapi, in the form of a
yollow antelope, done to thee that you are so much angry
with him ? Was it the rich possession (wealth) of the
Aryans ? Indra, &c." The form, in which Vrishakapi is here said to have
appeared, should be specially noted. Harita means yellow, and yellow animals (Haritah) are said to be yoked to the
carriage of Aditya in Nighantu (]. 15). There the word is, however, understood to be the plural of Harit, by the com
mentators in conformity to Rig. i. 115. 3 and v. 45. 9, where the sun is said to have seven horses yoked to his
carriage. But I think that the same idea may give rise to
the conception that the sun is represented by a single yellow animal, and we may take the passage in the Nighantu as referring also to the verse under consideration. I have
previously -alluded to the fact that the dog at the Chinvat
bridge in the Parsi traditions is described as zaritem, that
is, of the same colour as the antelope in the third verse.
But the question of coloar cannot be taken as finally settled
until we first definitely decide what animal is represented
by Mriga.*
VERSES 4 & 5. Sayana is literally correct, but again misses the spirit, or rather has missed it throughout the hymn. Indra was reproached in the second verse for his
partiality or over-kindness to Vrisbakapi. But Indrani was
not satisfied with it, and if Indra failed to punish the Kapi,
she took the matter in her own hand. Says she : " Indra!
Us you (thus) protect this (your) favourite Vrishakapi, let
the dog, eager (to chase) a hog (vardha)> bite him at his ear. Tho Kapi spoilt my favourite things, f I shall, there

fore, cut off his head, in order that an evil-doer may not
enjoy happiness. Indra is in the upper (portion) of the universe." Here Indrani is herself prepared to punish
VrisMkapi by setting the dog at his ear, and cutting oft' his
head. I have in a previous chapter shown how the fig-are of Mriga's head is to be obtained in the sky. Taking the three stars in the belt of Orion as the top of the head, the
dog is close by the right ear of Mriga and may properly
be said to bite it. The word vardha also points out the
place where we may expect to find the dog. In Rig. i. 61. 7, vardha* is said to be killed by Vishnu beyond a
mountain, which, in all probability, is the same story as that
of Indra killing Vritra. A dog chasing vardha is therefore
no other than Canis Major following the constellation of
Orion, or the "antelope's head" representing Vritra. Say.-ma and Yaska, and even European scholars are silent as to who
this dog is. The verses, in fact, may be said to have
remained altogether unexplained hitherto, though the words themselves are simple enough and have caused no
difficulty.
VERSE 6. This verse presents no difficulty. Thus satisfied, Indrani speaks of herself as the best of women,
"best in every way. VEESES 7 & 8. Indra now tries to conciliate her. Sayana,
following the Anukramani, supposes that the seventh verse is addressed by Vrishakapi and the eighth by Indra. The only reason I can find for such an interpretation is the
oblations offered to lu'dranl. I translate it by things generally,
"Whatever meantng we may adopt, it is quite evident that the Kapi's interfering with them has offended Indranl

occurrence of the word ambd, which means cc mother/ 'and
this cannot be supposed to be used by Indra, But though
we avoid one difficulty in this way, we are launched into
another, for the verse speaks of Indrani being pleasing
" to me;" anil if Vrishakapi is the speaker (C me," cannot refer to him, as ludrani is his mother and, consequently,
''me" has to be interpreted to mean (< my father/ 7 and this
Sayjina has done. I prefer taking ambd as an affectionate
and respectful mode of address, as in modern Sanskrit,, and
the verse presents no difficulty. We can then take both the 7th and the 8th verse together and give them a natural
interpretation. I translate thus " 0" auspicious lady! what
you say is true you are pleasing to me . .
But oh! hero-wife, with beautiful arms, pretty figure,
profuse hair, and broad hips, -why should you be so angry with our Vrishakapi ? Indra is in the upper (part) of the universe,"
V^KESK 9. Indrani replies, "This mischievous (Vrishakapi ) considers me to be avird ( i.e., without a brave husband or son), while I am the wife of Indra, the mother
of the brave, and the friend of Maruts. Indra, &c."
V BUSES 10 & 11. Pischel and Geldner suppose that the
first is addressed by Vrishakapi to Indrani, and the second by Vrishakapayi. Sayana understands them, to be addressed
by Indra, Whichsoever construction we adopt, the meaning remains the same. Indrani is here told that she is
highly respected everywhere ; she is the blessed of all women, and that her husband never suffers from old age.
This is obviously intended to pacify her.
VERSE 12. Indra says "0 Indrani ! I am not delighted
without my friend Vrishakapi, of whom these favourite



184 THE ORION. [CHAPTER
watery oblations reach the gods. Indra is in the upper
( part ) of the universe."
VERSE 13. This seems to be also addressed by Indra to
Indrani, who is here called Vrishakapayi. This latter name has caused a difference of opinion, some considering
Vrishakapayi to be the mother, some the wife of Vrishakapi.* I do not see how the wife of Vrishakapi, as such, could be introduced in the song, unless Vrishakapi is understood to be the name of Indra himself. Commentators, who take
Vrishakapayi to mean the wife of Vrishakapi, accordingly adopt the latter view. Pisehel and Geldner think that tho
verse is addressed by Vrishakapi to his wife Vrishakapayi.
The verse means, u rich Vrishakapayi ! having a good son
and a daughter-in-law, let Indra swallow the bulls, your favourite and delightful oblation. Indra, &c." There has been much speculation as to who could be the son and tho
daughter-in-law of Vrishakapayi, But if Vrishakapayi be understood to mean the wife of Indra, it causes no such
difficulty. The adjectives " having a good son," &c., are
simply complimentary, corresponding to the statement of Indrani, that she was the <c mother of the brave" in verse 9. Indra accepting her statements, asks her to allow him
to swallow the watery oblations said to come from Vmh
kapi in the last verse. The words priyam and liavis are .the same in both the verses ; and I think that both of them refer to the same oblations.

The practice of sacrificing bulls to Indra seems to have been out of date even at the time of the Rigveda (cf. i. 164. 43,
where it is said to be an old custom). But the old custom
could not be entirely forgotten, and if real bulls were not
offered to Indra, poets supposed that clouds or stars might answer the same purpose. The number 35 mentioned in the verse may thus refer to the Nakshatras (28), and planets (7).
But this explanation is doubtf ul, and I cannot suggest a better one.
VERSES 15, 16 & 17. The fifteenth and the sixteenth seem to be addressed to Indra by Indrani, and the seventeenth to
Indra ni by Indra. In the fifteenth Indrarii, according to
Sayana, asked Indra to sport with her just as a bull, with pointed horns, roars amongst a number of cows. The next two verses do not appear to be relevant to our purpose.
We may therefore pass these over, and resume the thread of the story. Pischel and Geldner suppose that the 17th.
and 18th verses are addressed by Vrishakap&yi.
VEUSES 18 & 19. Indrani is now conciliated, and says that she has not killed Vrishakapi, but some one else.
The verse thus means, " Indra ! let Vrishakapi get the slain animal an animal which was quite different from
VrishAkapi's. Let him at once have a knife, a fire-place, a new vessel, and a cart-load of firewood (to cook the killed
animal ). Indra/&c." Thus by the intercession of Indra, IndrS.nl was moved, and at last undid or rather explained away her previous act of decapitation. Pischel and Geldner trans
late the verse very nearly as I have done. They, however, consider it to be addressed by Vrishakap&yi and translate
parasvantam by f wild.3 This does not explain what dead
&airnal is here referred to. It is, I think, more natural to
suppose that the dead animal here spoken pf is the same .a& ,

that described in verse 5, and one whose head Indram is
fchere said to be ready to cut off. Indram now says that this
dead animal should be given to Vrishakapi, especially as Indra has already got hie oblations of balls. I have already shown.
that there were several legends about the " antelope's head."
It seems that Indrdni, referring to some of them, assures
Indra that it was not Vrishakapi in the form of the antelope
which she killed, but some one else ( literally parasvan
ton=represecting another than Vrishakapi, as Say ana takes it). Thereon Indra, having thus saved Vrishakapi by his inter
cession, observes, " Thus do I go seeing and discriminating between a ddsa and an drya; I take my drink from those
that prepare Soraa juice and cook the oblations, and thus behold or protect the intelligent} sacrificers. - In another word, Indra is glad that he has saved an Arya, and trium
phantly declares that he is always careful to distinguish
between an Arya and a Dasa, the latter of whom he would
punish and kill, e. g., Vritra, who is said to be a Dasa.
Vrishakapi being thus saved Indra, in the following verses, "bids him a farewell, wishing for a safe journey and speedy
return. These verses are very important for our present
purpose, and I shall therefore examine them singly.
20. In this verse Indra asks Vrishakapi to go
to Ms house (astam) and then return afterwards to the house ^nhas) of Indra. But the question is where is Vrishikapi's house and where is that of Indra ? The words in
the original are dhanva, krirttatra and nediyas. Vrishlkapi
'
is asked logo iodhanva, which is also krtotatra. Sayana
takes .d&owwto mean, a desert and krintatra in the, sense
that "the treejs therein are cut off.'* .But this meaning
does not qwte suit the context. What is meant by- saying

form, should go to a forest? Where is that forest, and
what does it imply ? DJianva is a word that occurs several
times in the Rigveda. In Rig. i. 35. 3 it is saiu to consist
of three yojanas and is contrasted with the earth. Sayanai
there understands it to mean " sky or heavens ;
" and I see no reason why we should not interpret the word in the
same way in this verse, Dhanva therefore means "gkj'
J or " heavens." Bat is it the vault above with three stages ?
No, the poet qualifies the idea by tyintatra, meaning "cut off." It is thus evidently the portion of the heavens which is cut off. In other words, the idea here denoted is the same as that expressed by the phrase avarodhanam
divah ee where heavens are closed/' or " where the view is
obstructed," in Rig- ix. 113. 8. Dhanva, which is kritantra,* thus denotes the innermost part of the celestial sphere,
the southern hemisphere or the Pitriyana. The poet knows that the vault of the heavens above him has three halts or stages which Vishnu is said to have used as his three steps
(Rig. i. 22. 17). But of the nether world the poet has
no definite knowledge, and he therefore cannot specify the
yojanas or the stages it contains. Thus he simply says that there are some yojanas therein. The first part of the verse
may now be translated thus : " Vrishakapi ! go to the
house (in) the celestial sphere which is cut off and which con
tains some yojanas or stages/' In short, Indra means that Vrishakapi should now descend into the southern hemisphere.
The latter part o the verse literally means " and come
to our house from nediyas." Now nediyas. is again a
* The only other place where "krintatra is used iu the Rigveda is
v. 27. 13, which Yaska and Sayaaa both interpret to mean that
" waters come up from krintatra, i.e., a cloud." But it may be
as well asked if Itrfatolrdt cannot here mean " from below."



138 THE ORION. [CHAPTER
word which neither Yaska nor Sayana seem to have properly
understood. Panini (v. 3. 63) tells us that nediyas is the
comparative of antika. Now nediyas catmot possibly be derived from antika by any change in the form of the latter word. Panini therefore considers neda to be a substitute
for antika, when the comparative form is to be derived.
This is equivalent to saying that ( bet J is to be substituted
for c good ' in deriving the comparative form of f good * in
English. I need not say how far such an explanation would be regarded satisfactory. My own view is that nediyas had lost its positive form in the times of P&nini, or
perhaps its positive form was never in use like that of
' superior^ in English. But P&nini, who> as a grammarian, felt bound to account for all the forms, connected nediyas
with ^antika, probably because the ordinary meaning of ned^yas in his time was the same as that of the comparative
form of antika. But we cannot infer from this that nediyas
might not have m^ant anything else in the days of Panini. Panini might have taken into account only the most
ordinary sense of the word, and finding that a positive form was wanting connected it with the word which expressed
the ordinary meaning in the positive form. The fact that Panini considers nediyas as the comparative of antika does not therefore preclude us from assuming", if we have |
other grounds to do so; that nediyas originally meant some
thing else in addition to its present sense ; for Pfinini speaks
of -the form and not of the meaning of nediyas. Having
thus, shown that the authority of P&nini is not against me , i
|
I shall now give my meaning of nediyas. I think it means j
lower, being akin to neath, beneath, nether* and corres*

ponding words in other languages. The suggestion, I
know, will be received by some with surprise and suspicion,
and I must give my grounds for proposing a new meaning. There is no passage in the Rigveda where the use of
nediyas might be considered as definitely deciding its meaning. In Rig. v. 52. 6, viii. 26. 10 and x. 101. 3,
nedisJitlia or nediyas might be supposed to mean lowest or lower. But- the passages are not conclusive on this point, as the word there used might also be understood to mean
' nearest/ ' nearer/ according to Panini. In the Brahmanas we 5 however, meet with more decisive passages. Thus in the
Aitareya Brahrnana vi. 27 nediyas is contrasted with upari
slitd-t* Bohtlingk and Roth give a passage from the
Kathaka recension of Yajurveda (28. 4), which says, " he ascends (drohati) to the heavens from HienethisJitha world." f Here the word ' ascend '
clearly shows that the nethshitha world must be understood to mean the c lowest world/
* world at the bottom. ' In the Tandya Brahmana (iii. 4, 2,
verb ntihan, nath, nethvm, and divided as nid-ar, ar being a comparative termination. (Bopp, Com. Gr. Eng. Tr. 1860, Vol. I.,

sed to sit). Of. Sk. mda Lat. nldu, O. Ir. net, 0. H. U. nest=.
a resting place (Comp. Gr. i., 51)1, ii. 4, 135). Both Bopp and
Brugmarm do not propose any new meaning of nedtyas. But
it is evident that whichsoever derivation we adopt the word is connected with ni down, and if we find passages in the Brahmanas
where it is contrasted with upari-shtdt, we can, 1 think, safely understand ntdiyas to meau * lower* as suggested by its etymology;
* nearer ' is a secondary meaning, ^

190 THE ORION* [CHAPTER
3 3, 2) there occurs a passage where the directions for
lowering the tone are given as follows : " Just as after
creeping up to the top of a high tree (a man) gradually co.oes lower and lower so, &c."* The word for lowering in
the text in nediyas sankramdt, and there is no possibility of mistaking its meaning. In the T&ndya Brahmanaii. 1. 3 the raising of the tone is described as ascending from top to
top (agrdt agram) ; and nediyas sankrama must, therefore,
mean a gradual lowering of the Yoice. In fact, nediyas sankrama represents the same idea as low-er-ing, that is, not taking a sudden leap down but descending from the highest point to the next lower, and so on. In all these
places Sayana explains nediyas as meaning * nearer J according to Panini ; but in every case he has to strain the words
to suit the context. It was not, however, Rayaiia's fault; for after nadiijas was once assigned to antika, all traces of its
old meaning were naturally lost, and none dared to question Panmi's authority. Bat we now know that in other
languages neatfi means low, and in several passages in the
Brahmanas, we find nediyas contrasted with * upper * .or
*top.
; This, in my opinion, is sufficient to prove that nediyas meant lower in the Vedic times. I have already shown
that the authority of Panini is not against understanding the word in this way. All that he has laid down is that nediyas having no comparative form should be derived from antika without saying whether nediyas was or was not used in any other sense. I am therefore inclined to think that necliyas might have had more than one meaning even in
JPanini's time, but he took the most ordinary meaning and derived the comparative form from antika. This in course

of time served in its turn to restrict the denotation of the
word only to one meaning, viz.* ' nearer.*
I would therefore translate the verse thus, " Vrisha
kapi ! go to the house the celestial sphere which is cut off
land which contains some (unknown) yofanas or stages.
From your nether house come to our house. Indra is iti
the upper (portion) of the universe." Nediyas is thus contrasted with uttara in the burden of the song. Both
are comparative forms. Indra is in the uttara (upper)
regions, while Vrishakapi is going to the nectiyas (lower)
world ; and Indra expects or rather requests Vrishakapi to
come back agaia to his (Indra's) house. That is the gist
of the whole verse. The idea that the sun falls down from
the autumnal equinox is an old one. In Ait. Br. iii. 18 and in Taifct. Br. i. 5. 12. 1 the ceremonies on the Vishuvan or
the equinoctial day in a satra are described* and there w are told that "gods were afraid of the sun falling down
from the sky and so supported him, " and being thus sup
ported he " became uttara to all." The Ait. Br* iii. 18 has thus the same word uitara that we have in this verse, and
it is natural to suppose that both relate to the same subject.
I have also quoted a passage from the Aitareya Brahmana where nedtyas is contrasted with uparishtdt. From these I infer that the verse, we are now considering, describes the descent of the son into the southern or the lower 'hemisphere, and that Indra asks him to come back again to
the house of gods, 'i.e., the northern hemisphere. I have
already given in full my reasons for understanding nediyas in a different sense. But I may remark that, even accepting the common meaning of the word, the verse may still
be interpreted in the way I have suggested.

world. This verse now describes what Indra will do when
he returns. Says Indra, <c "0 Vrishakapi ! you, the destroyer of sleep, who are going to the house, come back again,
again by (your) way. We would perform the sacrifices. Indra, &c/' The verse thus distinctly refers to the recommencement of the sacrifices in the Devayana or the Uttarayana as understood in old days. The word swvita is from the same root as vaitdnika and 'kdlpaydvaliai is from Jcrip,
the root which gives us the word kalpa, in Italpasutras.
Suvita Jcalpaydvaliai thus means * s we would perform 'the mitdnika ceremonies/' which, as described in the first verse, were stopped when the sun went down to the nether world. I may also here point out that the house in the
i&tli&r world or,- as S&yaiia interprets it. the house of the
Hei&y is called o$a literally
f thrown/ while Indra's house
is called griha. The sun goes down to the asta and returns
up to the griha of Indra. This verse, insofar as it speaks
of the recommencement of sacrificial ceremonies., confirms
the interpretation I have proposed for the preceding verse.

misleads people, would go ? Indra, &c." Now Yaska, in whose days all traces of Canis being once a star in the
heavens were lost, could not understand what to make
of the statement " where would that great sinner Mriga
be ? " It means that Mriga would not be seen, would
not be visible, when Vrishakapi goes t6 the house of Indra ;
but "Yaska did not perceive what was intended by such a
statement. He could not conceive that the constellation
of Mrigashiras would be invisible, when the Sun in his upward march would be there at the beginning of the
Devayana, that is,- when he comes to the house of Indra,
and therefore he proposed to interpret Mriga in the sense
of "the sun" (Nirukta 13. 3). Mrig-a/ says he, isderived from
mrij to go, and means " going/' " one who goes and goes
and never stops," in other wordsy " the sun." Now, says his commutator,- when a person goes into a house he can
not be seen by the outsiders. So Vrishakapi, when he goes to the house, cannot be seen by the people on the earth I

enters. What can, in such a case, be the propriety of the

rising sun was mwisible, a clear contradiction in terms. I am
sure Yaska here tried to explain away the difficulty in the way as he has done in the case of Vrika. But., in the
present instance, the solution he has proposed is, on the face
rf it* highly inconsistent, so much so that even S&yana does
follow it. Sayana, however, has nothing else to propose,
lie quietly leaves the word Mriga as it is and unexplain1
d in his commentary. In short, both Sayana and Yaska have found the verse too difficult to explain. The meaning I have proposed explains the verse in a natural and a 'simple manner, mud further corroborates the statement in th$
Rigged* previously referred to, viz., " Canis awakened
at the end of tlie year." In tne Taittiiiya S. S. l f we are told that the Vedic priests^ HL f^ observed the position of the son amongst in ihe morning, and, as the Naksliatras disappear

(tNirukta 12; 12 ). If the meaning I" have proposed is
correct, we have here a record of the position of the sun at
th0 vernal equinox. I take pulvnghas in the original to mean *' great sinner ;
" but it may be translated as Yaska
proposes by " omnivorous '; or " voracious." But in either
case I would take it as referring to the antelope's spoiling the things of Indrani. The point is that the sinning Mriga would not be with Vrishakapi when he again goes to the bouse of Indra, and Indrani would have no cause to com
plain of the presence of the odious Mriga at the time.
VERSE 23. Sayana translates, " O arrow ! Ma-na's daugh^
ier, named Parshu, gave birth to twenty (sons) together. Let her whose belly was big be happy ! Indra is in the uppetf
(portion ) of the universe." I cannot, however, under" stand what it means* Parshu, according to Sayana, is a Mrigi or a female antelope. Bat why address the arrow to give happiness to her ? Can it have any reference to the arrow With which Orion was killed ? Then who are these twenty ^ons ? Are they the same as twenty mentioned in verse 14 ?
In it likely that twenty alone are mentioned leaving the
additional fifteen to be understood from the context ? The
eoncluding verse undoubtedly appears to be benedictory. Buir I 'have not found a satisfactory solution of the above
questions. Perhaps, -bhala meaning ' auspicious/ may be used for Vrishakapi, and Indra addressing him- pronounces benediction on the female that gave birth to the yellpw
antelope and several dther stars that are supposed to be
either killed or . swallowed by Indra in this hymn. But
I cannot speak with certainty on tie point and must leave tHe Verse as it is.

that scholars differ in assigning the verses of the hymn to
the different speakers, and here and there we meet with expressions and words which cannot be said to be yet satis
factorily explained. Some of the interpretations I have proposed may not again be acceptable to all. But these difficulties do not prevent us from determining the leading
incidents in the legend, which may therefore be summarised
sorctewhat as follows. Vrishakapi is a Mriga, and sacrifices
are stopped where he revels. He is, however, a favourite of
Indra, and consequently the latter, instead of punishing, follows him, Indrani, who has frerself been offended by
the 'Kapi, now reproaches Indpa for his overfondness for the animal and threatens to ppnish. tfce beast by cutting off
his head and letting loose a dog at his ear. Indra intercedes
and Indian} assures bim that the punishipent has not been
inflicted on bis fayorite beast, but on someone else.
Vrishakapi is now going down to l}.is house and Indra, in.
bidding farewell to Ids friend, asks him to come up again to his ( Indra's ) house, so that the sacrifices may be
recommenqed ; and, strange to say, that when Vrish&kapi returns, in his upward march to the house of Indra, the*
impertinent Myiga. is no longer to be seen J Vrishakapi
Indra and Indraiii thus finally meet in the same house,
without the offensive beast, and th@ hymn, therefore con-*
eludes ;v?ith a benedictory verse,
There pan be little doubt that the kytpn gives a legend
urrentin old Vedic days, But no explanation has yet
been suggested, which accounts fpr all the incidents in the
story or explains how it originated. VrisMkapi is a Mriga;
p,nd his appearanpe and disappearance mark the cessation
and the recommencement of the sacrifices. The Indian tradition identifies him ^ith the #un in on form or anoth^- and



KIB&US AND FElSElKAPL 197
comparison with Greek Erikapaeos points to the same conclusion. Our Vrishakapi or Mriga must again be such as is liable to be conceived in the form of a head cut off from the
body, and closely followed by a dog at its ear, unless we are prepared to treat the very specific threat of Indrani as mean
ingless except as a general threat* All these incidents are
plainly and intelligibly explained by taking Vrishakapi to represent the sun at the autumnal equinox, when the Dogstar or Orion commenced the equinoctial year ; and, above all, we can now well understand why Vrishakapi's house is said to be low in the south and how his Mriga disappears when he goes to the house of Indra a point which has been a hard knot for the commentation to solve. I, therefore,
conclude that the hymn gives us not only a description of
the constellation of Orion and Canis (verses 4 and 5), but
clearly and expressly defines the position of the sun when be passed to the north of the equator in old times (verse 22) ;
3,nd joined with the legend of the Ribhns we have here
unnaistakeable and reliable internal evidence of the hymns
of the Rigveda to ascertain the period when the traditions incorporated in these hymns were first framed and con
ceived. In the face of these facts it is impossible, to hold
that the passages in the Taittiriya Sanhita and the Brahmanas do not record a real tradition about the older begin

conclusive. Scholars have already discovered the similarity between the traditions of the three nations, "but without
any clue to the period when all the Aryas lived together, it was impossible to reduce all these traditions into a
harmonious whole. The traditions of Orion, and especially
its position at the beginning of the equinoctial year, da, however, supply such a clue, and with its help the mystery about the oldest periods of Aryan civilization is consider
ably cleared up. Thus if Orion is now no longer a hunter
of unknown parentage, we need not also indulge in uncertain speculations about the foamy weapon with which Indra killed his enemy, or how the four- eyed dogs came to be stationed at the Chinvat Bridge, or why the Ribhus are
said to be awakened by a dog at the end of the year.
Astronomically the matter is as simple as it could be. All our measurements of time are directly based upon the
changes in the positions of heavenly bodies* But there is no measurement of time, at present determined, which is
longer than the period during which the equinoxes complete their revolution in the ecliptic. It is, therefore, the best measurement of time for determining the periods of anti
quity, only if wa iiave reliable records about the position of
heavenly bodies in early days. Fortunately, such records of the time, when the Hellenic, the Iranian and the Indian
lived together, have been preserved for us in, the , and. with the help of the Greek and the Parsi traditions we can now decipher these records inscribed on
the specially cultivated memory of the Indian Aryans.'

preted, stowed that the vernal equinox coincided with, that asterism in old times. This was, so to speak, a sort of corroborative evidence of the truth of the statement in the
Taittiriya Sanhita. A reference to the figure will show at a glance that if the sun be at the winter solstice on the FJialgunf fall-moon day, the moon to be full must be
diametrically opposite to the sun and also near Phalguni. ITttara Phalgunt will thus be at the summer solstice and the
vernal equinox will coincide with Mrlgashiras. With the sol
stice in Magha, the equinox will be in the Krittikas ; while
when the Uttar&yana begins in Pauba the equinox is in Ashvinl, Ashviaf and Pausha, Krittikas and Magha, and MrigasMras and PMlguna are thus the correlative pairs of
successive yeai^begmnings depending entirely upon the precession of the equinoxes; and the facts, statements, texts and
legends discussed in the previous chapters supply us with reliable evidence, direct and indirect, of the existence of all
these year-beginnings in the various periods of Aryan cifilization. It has been further shown that not only the traditions
but also the primitive calendar of the Parsis bears oat the conclusions we have deduced from the Vedic woi*ks.
We have eo far considered only one of the traditional
year-beginnings recorded in the Taittiriya Sanhita, the Plialgun! full-moon. But it may be asked how we interpret the other mentioned along with itr and almost in the aurae
worAs. Analogy at once suggests that we should interpret
it in the same way as we have interpreted the first. With

statement that the Sacrifice (the mysterial sacrificial personage) went away from the gods. The gods were then unable to perform any further ceremonies, and did not know where it ( the sacrifice ) had gone to:; and it was Aditi tha-t
helped them, in this state, to find out the proper commencement of the sacrifice.* This clearly means, if it can
mean anything, that before this time sacrifices were per
formed at random, but it was at this time resolved -and fixed to commen'ce them from Aditi. Aditi was thus the oldest and the first commencement of the sacrifice or the year

; interpret it to mean that the two termini of the sacrifices,
which began and ended with Aditi, are the two heads here | alluded to. These traditions are further corroborated by
j the sacrificial ceremonies. According to the sacrificial ! terminology the 4th day before Vishuvan or the central
j day of the yearly satra is called the Abhijit day. " In the j sixth month/' observes Lr. Haug,* "there are three Abhi
\ plava, shalahas ( six-days' periods ) and one Prishthya | shalaha." This makes up the first 24 days of the sixth | fnonth. The following days are thus enumerated : "the
I Abhijit day, the three svarasdman days and the Vishuvan,
j
or the central day which stands quite apart." Thus if we
j exclude the Vishuvan day, as standing apart by itself, this 5 gives us four days* and with the two days Atirdtra and 1 Okafnnimha which are taken np by the initial ceremonies t^ pi the mtra, we make up the shalaha wanted to complete the ! six months. The Abhijit day thus falls on the fourth day
before the Vishflvan. Now if Abhijit day be supposed
i\Gs "N* ^e nam^ after the Nakshatra of that name ( i. e., when
^
|1the sun is in Abhijit) then the Vishuvan or the autumnal
equinox must fall four days or as the sun travels over
about 1 of the ecliptic each day, 4 after the asterisca gi Abbijit ; and it can be shewn by astronomical calculation ihafc, with Aditi or Punarvasfi at the vernal equinox to
commence the sacrifice, we get nearly the same result* In

the asteranal equinox or Vishuvan, if we suppose the vernal
equinox to exactly coincide with Punarvasfi. With the

vernal equinox in Panarvasu there is again no oilier Nakshatra nearer to or at the autumnal equinox to mark the
Vishuvan day. We can, therefore, now understand why
Abhijit, which is so far away from the ecliptic, should have been included in the old list of the Nakshatras, It marked
the approach of the Vishuvan in the primitive sacrificial
calendar, but when it ceased to be used for that purpose
owing to the falling back of seasons, it was naturally dropped from the list of the Nakshatras, as it was far away from
the Zodiac. If Bentley's suggestion about Mula and JyeshtM be correct, this must have been done at the time when the vernal equinox was in Orion. But be that as it may, it will, I think x be clear from the above that the
position of the Abhijit day in the sacrificial literature fully
supports the tradition about Aditi, the presiding deity of Punarvasu, having discovered the commencement of the
sacrifice. Aditi at this time must have also separated the
Peyay&na from the Pitriyana and thus may have been appropriately called the mother of the Devas ( Rig. x. 72,
5 ).
* It was from her that the Adifcyas were born (Rig. x,
72. 8; Shat. Br. iii. 1. 3. 2.), or the sun commenced his
yearly course. the only other tradition I could find in the "Vedic litera
ture, about this position of Aditi is the story of the
* Aditi is here said to be the daughter of Daksha, also cf. Rig. viL 66, 2. In Purauic traditions the 27 Nakshatras are said to be the daughters of Dakslia who gave them to the moon. If we comMne these two traditions Aditi would |>e at the head of all thfe
Nakshatras, ia the same way as Mrigashiras or theKrittikas beaded

of this Prajapati, Svati the heart, Ha-sta the hand, "VisMkha

satisfactorily explains* why Prajapati>, who is said to be> the god of time or the lustrum of years in the Vedanga
Jyotisha, &hon*ld bave been represented in this way, I propose that we should interpret it after the manner of a.
similar representation of Brahman by Badar&yana, t wherein the different signs of the Zodiac are said to be similarly
related to the different parts of the body of Brahman r the
Creator. Prof. Max Miftller has thiit-s translated the
verse : " The ram is- the head, the face- of the Creator is thebull,- the breast would be the man-pair,, the heart the crab, the lion the stomach, the maid the hip*, the balance-bearer

not give an equally satisfactory reason in the case of one of the Nakshatras in this representation, unless we place three
intercalary months in five years. It . is, however, very difficult to determine how the intercalary months were
inserted, if at all, at this remote period, and the question must therefore, to a certain extent, remain unsolved for the
.present. The analogy of the pictorial representation of the twelve signs of the Zodiac in later days, is, however, a
strong ground to hold that the asterismal Prajapati may have been .similarly conceived when the primitive year was first determined on the Nakshatra system. There is, so far as I know, no more evidence about this primitive calendar in the Vedic works, than what has been given above. But the traces of such period which we can discover in the
sacrificial literature and especially the express mention in Taittiriya Sanhita that the Chitra full-moon once commenced
the year are, in my opinion, sufficient to prove the exist
ence of such a calendar in the primitive days* We
cannot otherwise account why the first and last offerings in
every sacrifice should be made to Aditi and why Abhijit
clay should precede the YisMvan by four days. Compared to the evidences of the Orion period, these are slender materials for the construction of the primitive Vedic calendar, but they are decidedly superior to the materials on which Dr. Geiger has determined the primitive calendar of the
Iranians. It appears to me therefore that the oldest Vedic calendar
like the oldest hymn, was sacrificial ; and that the sacrifice
or the year commenced with Aditi at the vernal equinox in or near Punarvasu. The phases of the moon, the seasons and the ayanas further guided the ancient Aryas in
measuring time for sacrificial purposes. The asterism of Abhijit marked the approach of Vishuvun or the central

day, while Punarvasu, which soon after came to be called
Yamakau, perhaps Yama and Yami, indicated the beginning of the year. Sometime after this and before the vernal equinox had receded to Orion, the Innar months and
tiihis or days appear to have come in use ; and, in fact, the whole calendar seems to have been rearranged, the year being made to commence from the winter solstice in the
Chitra full-moon. But this did not alter the sacrificial
system, which, so far as the procedure is concerned, still Continues to be what it was in the oldest days. For all
civil purposes the new calendar was, however, at once adopted and the two systems have, continued to exist
side by side up to the present day> though in a considerably modified form, as described before in the second
Chapter. The oldest period in the Aryan civilization may there
fore be called the Aditi or the pre-Orion period, and we
may roughly assign 6000-4000 B. C. as its limits. It was a period when the, finished hymns do not seem to have been
known and half -prose and half-poetical Nivids or sacrificial
formulae "giving the principal names, epithets, and feat$
of the deity invoked " were probably in use. The Greeks and the Parsis have retained no traditions of this period,
for the simple reason that they carried with them only
thQ calendar which was in force .when they left the common home, while the Indian Aryas have preserved all th
traditions ....with a super-religious fidelity and scrupuloussess. It is thus that I explain why. the oldest Grreek an;<d
Parsi traditions do not go beyond Orion.
,.. We next come to the. Orion period which, roughly speafcr irrg extended from 40,00 B. C* to 2500 B. 0., from the "when the vernal equinox was in the asterism
time when it receded to -the astqrmnx Jof th.



VIII.] CONCLUSION. 07
This is the most important period in the history of the
Aryan civilization. A good many suktas in the Rigveda
fag., that of Vrishakapi, which contains a record of the
beginning of the year where the legend was first conceived) were sung at this time, and several legends were either formed anew or developed from the older ones. The Greeks and the Parsis appear to have left the common home daring
the latter part of this period as they have retained most
of these legends, and even the attributes of the constellation
of Mrigashiras, otherwise called Agmyana, Orion or
the Pauryeni. We can now easily understand why no confirmatory evidence about the Krittika- period is found
either in the Eigveda or in the Greek and Parsi legends and
traditions. This w,is pre-eminently the period of the hymns.
The* third or the Krittika-period commences with, the vernal equinox in the asterism of the Krittikas and extends
up to the peiiod recorded in the Yedanga Jyotisha, that is,
from 2500 B. 0. to 1400 B. C. It was the period of the Taittiriya Sanhita and several of the Brahmanas, The
Jiymns of the Rigveda had already become antique and
unintelligible by this time and the Brahmavadins indulged in speculations, often too free, about the real meaning of
these hymns and legends, attributing the use of the foamy
weapon used by Indra to a compact between him and Na7
rmichi. It was at this time that the Sanhitas were probably
compiled into systematic books and attempts made to ascei^
,tain the meanings of the oldest hymns and formulae. It wag
also during this period that the Indians appear to tavo
.come in contact wifch t]ie Chinese, and t^e latter borrowed
the Hindu, Naksaatra system. I do ,not mean to , say. Hindus might not have improved, their aystena ;by interchange of ideas as th,ey did wlien they camQ, t JtoQ w_o

Greek astronomy. But the system was decidedly of Hindu origin and of purely Hindu origin being handed down from tke remotest or the pre-Orion period in the Vedic literature. M. Biot was unable to assign any reason why the Chinese should have taken a leap from the shoulder to the belt of
Orion to choose their fourth $ieu. But with the older
Hindu traditions the question admits of an easy explanation, as the belt was therein the real Mrigashiras or rather the
top of Mriga's head.
The fourth and the last period of the old Sanskrit litera
ture extends from 1400 B. G. to 500 B, 0. or to the birth
and rise of Buddhism. It was the period of the Sutras and
philosophical systems. It may be called the real pre-Buddhistic period, But as this has been sufficiently discussed
by other writers I need not go into its further details.
I do not mean to lay down hard-and-fast limits o each of
these periods of antiquity, nor do I intend to say anything about the period which must have elapsed before the Vedic Aryas were able to fix their primitive calendar in the Aditi
period. The beginning of the Aryan civilization must un
doubtedly be placed a long time before the people were able to conceive and determine the calendar. But I do not wish,
to enter here into these speculations. I take my stand only
upon what we find recorded in the Vedic works, and hence all that I mean is that if the astronomical allusions, references,
facts, and legends in the Vedic works can have any meaning*,
we cannot materially shorten the periods I have here in
dicated. We may not rely on vague traditional beliefs amongst one nation alone, but when we find that the tradi
tions of India, Greece, and Iran, agree in their important
features, and can be explained satisfactorily only by placing
the vernal equinox in Orion, and when we have an express



VIII.] CONCLUSION. 209
authority for doing so in the Rigveda, I do not think that we can reasonably refuse to accept the conclusions deduced therefrom. It is true that we have determined the oldest
Vedic periods from the traditions we find recorded in the
Rigveda, and, strictly speaking, it is the period of the traditions and not of the hymns into which they have been in
corporated. But this does not, in my opinion, materially
affect the conclusions we have arrived at above regarding the ancient periods of the Vedic literature. I do not mean
to deny that .the hymns. may not have been sung some time
after these traditions and legends were originally conceived,, or that after they were first sung the hymns might not have been somewhat modified in form in passing from mouth, to mouth before they became settled in the form in which we now possess them. But though, so much, may
be legitimately conceded, I think that it is impossible to hold that the hymns were composed thousands of years after the stories narrated in them, were first conceived*
For, as a matter of fact, we find that the Rigveda hymns
had already become antiquated and unintelligible in the days of the Taittiriya Sanhita and the Brahmanas. The
,Taittir!ya SanhitS, places the vernal equinox in the Krittikas, and I have shown that we must fix its date at about 2500 /
J3, 0. If the hymns of the Rigveda Sanhita were unintelligible at this time, they must have been sung several centuries
beforeiti The comparison of the Taittiriya with the Eigveda Sanhita further shows that while the first mentions three
year-beginnings one current and two old the second .qp]y mentions one. Again, the Rigveda Sanhita contains
up reference to the Krittikas as the mouth of the Nakshatras,
I therefore conclude that the legends in question must have
been incorporated into the hymns of the Rigveda* when
27



: THE
-were .still intelligible, that is, in the Orion period
it is of course impossible to determine the dates of individual hymns. That all of them were not sung at one time
is quite evident from their style. Some of the hymns dis
tinctly speak of older hyinns or bards, while in Rig* x,
90 '9 the hymns are said to proceed directly from ihejpurdsha or the sacrificial personage. All that we can therefore legi
timately say is that the hymns, which contain older traditions
iand legends, e. g^ of the Ribhus and VrisMkapi, must have
"been composed in the Orion period. Some of the hymns
-may even be still older and some later, but generally speak* ing we may suppose that 4000 and 2500 B. C. are the limits
of this period. This may require us to assume the existence bf some Vedio verses at a time when the Hindus, the
'Greeks and the Parsis lived together. Some scholars may
'hesitate to accept such a conclusion. But so far as I know
the conclusion is not inconsistent with the results o com
parative Philology or Mythology, Prof. Max Miiller in
Ms Biographies of Words ( pp.* 188-198 ) gives a Hat of '-about sixty mythological names which may bo shewn to b 'common to Greek and Sanskrit.* If so many mytho
logical names can be shewn to be phonetically identical!,
it is* impossible tD suppose that no songs, celebrating tbe "deeds of these deities, existed in the Indo-Germanic period,

poetry. Verbal coincidences such as, St. pada^Av. padha,, &k, pous, all meaning a metrical foot, again point to the same conclusion.* The results of comparative Philology,
are, therefore, not only not inconsistent with, but, on the. contrary, corroborate the conclusions we have independently deduced from the astronomical references and allusions; recorded in the old Vedic literature. But I would not make
nay case rest on such grounds. It must be remembered, that we have not been speculating . in any way about the eldest Vedic periods. Our conclusions have been based on express statements and texts in the Vedic literature, and unless the texts themselves are questioned or other more reason
able interpretations suggested, we shall not be justified in disregarding these results, simply because they do not
support certain literary hypotheses, guesses, or conjectures, as, for instance, those that have been previously referred^ to in the first .chapter. The results of the literary method may be moderate. But moderation is a virtue only when
we have to make guesses about the periods of antiquity from uncertain data. Where however we have definite
'texts, and traditions to rely upon, nothing biat prejudice pan deter us from drawing legitimate conclusions from, them on the ground that they take us too far back. The
astronomical method, I admit, is vague, insofar as it does not enable us to determine the exact date of all the Vedic
'hymns x>r ^rorks, but it is certainly superior to the linguistic method inasmuch as it supplies us with certain definite and
pn disputed tfacts, for instance,, the position of the equinoxes which can safely be made the nuclei of the different periods

of antiquity. "When the centres of each, period are tlius un~
disputably fixed and determined, we can then use the
literary or the linguistic method to supplement these resultsby determining the duration of each period. There would
then be no real opposition between the two methods. The one would determine the specific points of time, while the other would give us the range of the different periods. In . other words, the first would supply the piers and the second the arches of the bridge, which we mean to construct across
the period of antiquity, and which must therefore be completed with the assistance of both.
It may, however, be urged that if the beginning of the year was twice altered owing to the precession of the equinoxes, how is it that we do not find the traces of the intermediate stages or of the changes in the seasons in the old Vedic works ? How, it m^y be further asked, did the Indian Aryas not discover the precession of the equinoxes in the early Vedic times ? But it is not at all difficult to
answer these questions. We might as well ask how no one before Bhaskaracharya or Newton ever thought of the
attraction of the earth, though since the very beginning of
the human race every one observed heavy objects falling down to the surface of the earth. The reason is plain enough. Celestial and natural phenomena cannot be fathomed or understood without a steady and close observation for
centuries, and, above all, until all the auxiliary, or rather
the whole group of sciences are proportionally developed.
If we bear this circumstance in mind, we can, I am sure, discover sufficient traces of the intermediate changes in the Vedic works. Thus we find that of all the ancient
nations the Hindus alone had well nigh accurately determined the rate of the motion of the precession, of the



VIIL] CONCLUSION. 213
equinoxes.. Hipparchus considered it to "be not less than 36", while the actual motion at present is 50*' 25 per year*
Ptolemy adopted, as observed by Prof. Whitney, the
minimum of 36" determined by Hipparchus; and it is evident that the Hindu astronomers who fixed the rate at 54* per year could not have borrowed it from the Greeks. Prof. Whitney is at a loss to understand how the Hindus succeeded in arriving at a determination of the rate of motion, so much more accurate than was made by the great Greek astronomer, and he observes that it might be a
4t lucky hit on their part/' * But why should they try to hit, even luckily, when they could have easily borrowed it from the Greeks ? I am therefore disposed to think that it
was independently, and almost correctly, discovered by the Hindus long before other nations could do so, though we cannot exactly fix the period when it was done; and that there were sufficient materials for the purpose in the old
literature of India.
- Let us next see what traditions about the intermediate
stages have been preserved. First of all I refer to the
tradition of Eudra killing Prajapati, the god of time, for receding towards his daughter Rohini. The Aitareya Brahmana (iii. 33) describes this conduct of Prajapati as akrita or unprecedented and such as deserved to be
severely noticed by the gods. Can we not herein discover
the fact that the sun was gradually receding towards
Kohini, by the precession of the equinoxes ? The ancient
priests, who observed the fact as they watched the Nakshatras at the commencement o the year, could not account
for the change, and they rightly and honestly believed
that it was a great calamity that the sun or Prajapati
* See Whitney'* notes to the Siirya Siddhaiita^ iii. 13* p.



214 ,TBE ORIONi
should 'thtis follow an unprecedented course.. I Have previously referred to a verse from Garga,* which says that if the Otta'r&yana commenced otherwise than - from the
;asterism of Dhanishtha, it foretold a great danger ; and wa
may suppose that the Vedic Aryas similarly believed that if the sun ceased to commence the year from Orion, it was
an unprecedented calamity. Prajapati, however, was punished for .his unusual conduct, and there the matter ended foE the time being. I may also refer here to the ancient mode
,of deriving the word Eohini. The Arabs called it A1-* JDabaran or/ 6 the follower*' evidently because it came next
after the- Krittikas.f But the Hindus called it Eohini, "the ascended," inasmuch as they noticed that the sun
gradually ran towards it in oldest days. It has been sug*
gested that we should explain the legend of Prajapati by (reference to the daily rising of Echini, Mrigashiras, and
Eudra in succession,. But this explanation hardly accounts for the fact why Prajapati was considered as literally run-*
aiing after Eohini in an unprecedented way. Surely we Cannot suppose that the Vedic priests were ignorant of th.q
fixed position of these constellations, and if so, we cannol^ jaccount for the fact why they considered Praj&pati as
after1 and thinking of living together with Bohinl they had, noticed the actual recession of the sun to^
wards Rohini owing to the precession of the equinoxes* ffhe tradition of Prajapati and Eudra, is thus comparatively
speaking a later tradition^ though it seems to have been -completely formed before the separation, of the Greeks and efehe Parsis from the Indian Aryas,
* See supra, Chapter II, p. 1%
_



.' CONCL USION*
r fiut the question which was dropped" at this time after
'punishing Prajapati, was again taken up when the equino
tad receded to the Krittikas. The seasons had fallen back
fcy one fall month and the priests altered the year-begin
king from the Phalguni to the Magha full-moon, while the list of the isfakshatras was made to commence from the
Krittikas," instead of from Agrahayana. There is nothing surprising in the fact that the change should have been quietly introduced when we see that Varahamihira did the same in the fifth" century after Christ when the'Ashvini!system was introduced.* The calendar was mainly used for
the sacrificial purposes, and when the priests actually observed that the sun was in the Krittikas, and not in Mriga*
shiras, when day and night were equal, they altered the
commencement of the year to the Krittikas, especially a& it was more convenient to d.o so at this time when the cycle >f seasons had receded by one full month. The priests sknew that the year commenced a month earlier in older days^ but like Varahamihira they must have appealed more to the
actual facts., as they saw them, and introduced the change
'without attempting to discover its real cause. }
The Vedanga Jyotisha introduces the third change, whetii the season3 had further fallen back, not by a month, but
by a fortnight. It was probably during this interval that
the beginning of the month was altered from the full-moon
to the new-moon, and when this beginning of the montli
was so altered, advantage was taken of the receding of the seasons by a fortnight, to commence the year with the new-moon in Dhamsshtha as the Vedanga Jyotisha has done* . , . -^
* See supra, Chap. IIL, p. 36.



216 TEE ORION. [CHAPTER
., From this the next recorded step is to Ashvinl There
is, however, an interesting story related in the Mahabharata which evidently refers to an abortive attempt to reform
.the calendar when the seasons had again fallen back by a
fortnight. In the 71st chapter of JLdiparva we are told
that Visvamitra attempted to create a new world,* and make the Nakshatras commence with Shravana, instead of Dhanishtha; and the same story is alluded to in the Ashva
medha Parva, chapter 44. The tradition can also be found in other Puranas where Visvamitra is represented as
.endeavouring to create a new celestial sphere. It appears, however, that he did not succeed, and the Krittika-system, as modified by the Vedanga Jyotisha, continued to re* gulate the calendar until the list of the Nakshatras was
quietly made to begin, as noticed in the third chapter, with
Ashvini in later times.
We have thus an almost continuous record of the year
beginnings from the oldest time down to the present in the
literature o India, and in the face of this evidence it is use
less to indulge in uncertain speculations about the antiquity o the Vedas. I have already referred to the occurrence of
the pifri-pahsha, in Bhadrapada as a relic of the time when
the year commenced with the Phalguni-full-moon. Our Shravani ceremony appears to have been once performed in Bhadrapada (Manu iv. 95) ; and as it marked the begin
ning of the rains,, when the herbs appear anew (Ashvalayana

CONCLUSION. 217
{Jrihya Sutra iii. 5. 2), we can here trace the recession of
the rainy season from Bhadrapada to Shravatta, and from Shr&vana to Ashadha ( Sankhyayana Brahmana i. 3 ) and
finally from Ashadha to Jyeshtha, as at present, thus fully
corroborating the recession of the beginning of the year or the winter solstice from Chaitra to Ph&lguna, from PMlguna to M&gha, and from Magha to Pans ha. The evidence of the recession of the seasons Is not, however, -as complete as
that of different year-beginnings, inasmuch as there are various local causes besides the precession of the equinoxes
"that affect the occurrence of the seasons. The seasons in the Central India and Central Asia caanot, for instance, be the same, and if the Aryas came into India from the North
-West, the very change of locality must have caused a corresponding change in the seasons. The evidence of the change of seasons cannot therefore be supposed to be- so reliable and conclusive as that of the successive changes in the beginning of the year above mentioned.
, Lastly, there remains only one question to be considered* Jb the Vedic period here determined consistent with the .traditions and opinions entertained about it by the ancient and modern scholars ? I think it is. I have already
referred to the remarks of Prof. Weber who, though he
regards the Krittika evidence as vague and uncertain, yet on geographical and historical grounds arrives afc the con
clusion that the beginnings of the Indian literature may
be traced back to the time when the Indian and the Iranian
Aryas lived together; and this opinion is confirmed by the
fact that there are Yashts in the Zend Avesta which may
be considered as "reproductions" of the Vedic hymns. Dr Hang considers - that- this condition may be satisfied
if we place tho-b^ginmng-of the Vedic literature, in 2400 28



518 THE ORION. [CHAPTER
B. C;* but lie was not cognisant of tlie fact that the
vernal equinox can be shown to have been in Mrigashiras at the time when the Parsis and the Indians lived together.
In the light of this new evidence, there is therefore no rea
sonable objection for carrying the periods of the Vedic literature further back by over a thousand years OF to about
4000 B. C. This period is further consistent with the fact that in 470 B. C. Xanthos of Lydia considered Zoroaster
to have lived about 600 years before the Trojan War (about
1800 B. C.); f for according to our calculation the Parsis
jnust have separated from the Indian Aryas in the latter
part of the Orion period, that is to say, between 50*00 to
2500 B. C ; while, if we suppose that the separation occurred at a considerably later date^ a Greek writer in the fifth
century before Christ would certainly have spoken of it as a recent event. Aristotle and Eudoxus liav gone still further and placed the era of Zoroaster as much as 6000 to
5000 years before Plato. The number of years here giveu
is evidently traditional, but we can at any rate infer from it this much that at the time of Aristotle (about 320 B. C,)
Zoroaster was considered to have lived! at a very remote
period of antiquity; and if the era of Zoroaster is to be considered so old/ a fortiori] the period of the Vedas must be older still. Then we have further to consider the fact that an epic poem was written in Greek in about 9'00 or
1000 B, C. The language of this epic is so rmlike that of the Vedic hymns that we must suppose it to have been,
composed long time after the Greeks left their ancient home
and travelled westward. It is not, therefore? at all impro
bable 'that they separated after the formation of the legends

of Orion and before the vernal* equinox was in the Kritti
kas, that is, between 3500 to 3000 B. C. Finally, we can
easily understand ' how the- acutest and most learned of
Indian theologians and scholars believed the Vedas- to have
come down to them from an unknown period of antiquity.
A revelation need not necessarily be anddi, or without a beginning. The history of the Bible and the Koran shows us that a revelation can be conceived to be made at a par
ticular period of time. If so, the mere fact that it is believed to be revealed does not account for the opinion
entertained by the Hindu theological writers that the Veda
lias come down to them, from times beyond the memory of
man. Some of these writers lived several centuries before
Christ, and it is quite natural ta suppose that their opinions were formed from traditions current in their times. The periods of the Vedic antiquity we have determined render
such an explanation highly probable* According to the Christian theology, the world was created only about 4000 years before Christ ; or, in other words, the notions of
antiquity entertained by these Christian writers could not
probably go beyond 4000 B. C. and not being able to say
anything about the period preceding it, they placed the beginning of the world at about 4000 B. C. The Indian theologians may be supposed to have acted somewhat ia the
same manner. I have shewn that the most active of the Vedi.c period commenced at about 4000 B. C., and- there
are grounds for carrying it back still further. The form of the hymns might have been more or less modified in later
times ; but; the matter remained the same, and coming down from such a remote antiquity it could have been easily
believed by Jaimini, Panini, and the Brahmavadin of old to have been in existence almost from the beginning of the

worldj or rather tlie beginning of all known tilings. We can thus satisfactorily account for all the opinions and traditions current about the age of the Vedas amongst ancient and modern scholars in India and in Europe, if we
place the Vedic period at about 4000 B. C., in strict accord*
ance with the astronomical references and facts recorded in
the ancient literature of India. When everything can thus
be consistently explained, I leave it to scholars to decide whether the above period should or should not be accepted
as determining, as correctly as ifc is possible to do under the circumstances, the oldest period of Aryan civilization. It
is the unerring clock of the heavens that has helped us in
determining it, and it is, in my opinion, hardly probable to discover better means for the purposes. The evidence was
in danger of being obliterated out of the surface of the
heavens, when the Greeks borrowed their astronomical
terminology from the Egyptians; But it has fortunately escaped and outlived, not only this, but also another threat
ened attack when it was proposed in England and Germany
to name the constellation of Orion after Nelson or Napoleon
as a mai'k of respect for these heroes* The bold and
brilliant Orion, with his attendant Canis, preserves for u$
the memory of far more important and sacred times i$ the history of the Aryan race.

identifying Sk. Agrayana with Gk. Orion ; and here I wish, to examine the point more fully, not because my case rests
upon it, bat simply with a view to indicate the real nature
of the objections that may be urged against the proposed identification. If philologists are still inclined to hold
that the identification is not even probable, we shall have
to look for some other Aryan derivation, as the similarity of the Eastern and Western traditions of Orion is, in my
opinion, too strong to be accidental.
Agrayana is evidently .derived from agra and ay ana. Of these ay ana,, which is derived from i, to go, may be represented by ion in Greek : c. Sk. ayus, Gk. aion ; Sk. comparative termination (uoni. sin.) tydn, Grk. ion ; Sk. termination
d,yana, as in Gargydyana, Gk. ion, as in Kronion, 'the descendant of Kronos'. The initial d in Sk. Agrayana may also
become din Greek; as in Sk. asliayana, Gk. okeanos ; Sk.a
shu9 Gk. okus. Sanskrit Agrayana may therefore be represent
ed by Ogrion in Greek, and we have now to see if g may be
dropped before r and Ogrion can be changed into Orion.
It is a general phonetic rule in Teutonic languages that a
gutteral may disappear before a liquid, whether initially or medially ; cf. Ger, nagel, Eng. nail ; hagel and hail ; regen and rain; Sk. kravis, 0. H. G. TO. Prof. Mas Miiller has
extended the application of this rule to Latin and Greek, and Latin and .French in his Lectures on the Science of
Language, Vol. II., p. 309. He compares Latin paganus

with French paien, Gk. lachne with Lat. Idna-, and points oat that on the same principle lumen stands for lucmen,
examen for exagmen, flamma for flagma. K. Brugccaun (Com. Gr. I., 52-1) would derive O. Ir. ar^ Cymr. aer
from *agro on. the same principle. This shews that Sk.
aqra may be easily represented by Vzr in Teutonic 'languages.
We may account for the change in two ways. We may
either suppose that the final gntteral of a root is sometimes
dropped before terminations beginning with a liquid and
thus put li.ic-menlu-men, fulg-men=ful-men, Jlag-men~ fta-men, ag-men a -men, ag-raa-ra (with compensation vowel lengthening ; Bopp derives Sk. roman, a hair from
ruh-man growing, on the same principle); or we may suppose that the change is in accordance with the general phonetic rule which sanctions the omission of a gntteral before a
liquid in such cases. But whichsoever explanation we
adopt, there is no question as to the change itself. It must
mot, however,, be supposed that the rule is an nninflexible one,
and that a gutteral must always be dropped before a liquid ; for we find that a gutteral in such cases is often either
retained or labialised, cf. Sk. gr&can, 0. Ir. br@o, bro 9
{gen. lroon)j Cymr. breuan ; Sk. grinami, 0. Ir. gair. The proper rule to deduce from these instances would therefore be, that gr in Sanskrit may be represented by g.r^ ir or r in Teutonic languages, and that all the three changes
sre possible.
Cam we net extend the rule to Greek and Sanskrit ?
is the next question we have to consider. I do not mean to
deny that there are phoaetic rules which are not univer
salf applicable to all languages. But the present rule can.
be easily shewn not to belong to this class. Prof. Max has already extended it to Greek and Latiu ; and
<



1 APPENDIX* 22*3
Vararuchi, in his Prakrita- Prakasha II. 2,. lays down that g in ga may be medially dropped as between Sanskrit and
Prakrit, e. g., Sk.sdgara, Pk, sd-ara; Sk. nagara, Pk. na-ary
eventually corrupted into nara, as in Jun-nara and other names of cities. This is in fact the same rule which, when
applied to Teutonic languages accounts for the change of
segel into sail* nagel into nail and so on. Comparison of Avestie%m with Mod. Per. tir shews that a similar change
may also take place between those languages. We may,, therefore-, fairly say that the rule about the omission of" a
gutteral before a liquid obtains not only in Teutonic languages, but also between Greek and Latin, Latin and French, Sanskrit and Old Irish,, Sanskrit and Prakrit,, and Avestic and Modern Persian. In the face of these facts it would, I
think, be unduly restricting- the applicability of the phonetic rule if we refuse to apply it to Sanskrit and Greek. There
is at any rate no a priori improbability in expecting that a similar change may take place as between Greek and
Sanskrit. Let us now see if there are any instances as between Greek and Sanskrit to support such a conclusion.
Prof. Benfey compares Sk. g.rdvan with Gk. laos (Lat. lapis); and Sk, ghrdna, with Gk. m, rinoa. If this comparison is correct, here at least we have two instances where a
g*atteral before r in Sanskrit is lost in Greek. It is some
times labialised, as in Sk. Jerbiami, Gk. priami; Sk. gw*u t
*
Gk. barns;- and . sometimes retained as it is, as in Sk.. J&ratu, Gk. brains ; Sk. gras, Gk. gfroto^.to swallow. From these
instances we may therefore infer that as between Greek
and Sanskrit, the initialgutteral in Jcr or gr in Sanskrit
may be either retained as it is, or labialised. or dropped in
Greek, the same rule which holds good, as shewn above, in Teutonic languages* It may be^ noticed here that while



224 APPENDIX.
grdvan becomes laos in Greek,- it is Iroon in Old Irish, that is, while the initial g of a Sanskrit word is iabialised in Old
Irish it is dropped in Greek. This shews that the initial kr
or gr in Sanskrit may be differently represented in different languages. Sanskrit krimis, Lat. vermis, Gk. elmis; and
Sk. kli-pta, Avestic kerepta, Gk. raftos, may, I think., also be regarded as further illustrations of the same rule. I
know that the connection between the words last quoted is
still considered doubtful, but that is because the rule about
the omission of a gutteral before a liquid, as between Greek
and Sanskrit, is not yet recognised by scholars. If the
examples I have given at the beginning of this paragraph are, however, sufficient to justify us in applying the rule to Greek and Sanskrit, the instances last cited may be taken
as further supporting the same view.
' With these instances before us, it would be unreasonable
to deny that the three possible changes of kr and gr, which
obtain in Teutonic languages, do 'not take place as between
Greek and Sanskrit, 'at least initially; and if these changes
take place initially, analogy at once suggests that they would also take place medially. At any rate there' is no
reason why they should not. It may be urged that a
comparison of Sk. cJiakra with Gk. kuklos shews that a
medial kr is retained as it is. But as pointed out above
the argument is not conclusive. There may be cases where kr is retained as it is. But we have seen that by the side
of such cases, instances can be quoted where it is changed
to pr or r initially; and we may expect the same threefold
possible change medially. It is admitted that labialisation
takes place medially; and we have therefore to see if there
are any instances where a gutteral is dropped before a
liquid in the body of a word. K, Brugmann tells us that



APPENDIX, 225
at one period gn and gm came to be represented by n and
m in Greek; cf. glgnomai and ginomai, stugnos and sttt<ms*
Now this change in the -body of a word is exactly similar to
that of agmen into amen, and is evidently due to the same
rule, which accounts for the latter change. Similarly Gk.
anoos may be compared with Sk. ajna, and Gk. arinos to
Sk. aghrdna. But I do not lay much stress on these inasmuch as these words may be supposed to have been derived
by the addition of the prefix alpha to the already existing Greek forms, and not directly obtained from Sanskrit ajna
and aghrdna. The change of gignomai into ginomai} or of gignosko into ginosko cannot, however, be so accounted for, and if g before n is dropped in the body of a word> there is no reason why ib should not be dropped before r on the
analogy of the phonetic rule given above. Works on
philology do not give any more instances of such changes, but as observed above, the attention of scholars does not appear to have been directed to this point. Otherwise I
do not think it was difficult to discover the similarity
between Gk. turos and Sk. takra. Takra is derived from
tanch (*t&ng ) to contract, to coagulate or curdle,, and according to Fick the root is Indo- Germanic., It is an
old-Vedic root, and we have such expressions as dadhnd
dtanakti ' coagulates ( milk ) with curds' in the Taittiriya
Sanhita II. 5. 3. 5. Takra therefore literally means '* curdled milk' and uot ' curds mixed with water' as the word is understood in modern Sanskrit. Now, if we suppose that the rule, which sanctions the omission of g or
k before r or m in other languages, also holds good as
between Greek and Sanskrit, not only initially (as in grdvan and loos ) but also medially, as in gignomai ^nd
Sk. takra may be easily identified with Gk*



226 APPENDIX*
turos meaning tf cheese \ Takra may thus be said to
have retained its root meaning in Greek. Twos is- an old Greek word used in the Odyssey, and it has not yet been explained by anything in Indo Germanic. DrSehrader therefore records a suggestion that it should bederived from Purko Tatario turak. But if Sanskrit sdra
and sarpis are found in Greek oros (whey) and elphos. (butter,) it is not reasonable to suppose that turos alane was
borrowed from a non-Aryan source. Takra in modern Sanskrit means c curds mixed with water and churned' and
perhaps it may be contended that we cannot identify ii with turOBj which means 'cheese *. I have, however, shewn
that fafcraefcymologically means 'curdled milk' and not * curds
dissolved in water ' which is evidently its secondary meaning.
Besides when we see that sdra which in Sanskrit denotes 'curdled milk', has become oros=whey in Greek, and serum In Latin, there is nothing unusual if we find takra and
turos used in slightly different senses in the two languages*
I have already suggested iu the body of the essay that we may identify Sk. Shukra with Gk. Rupris. Chakrakuklos* Shukra=zKupri$, and takra=tnras> may thus be taken to
illustrate the application of the rule above discussed,,
regarding the three-fold chaage of kr or gr, to Greek and Saaskrit medially ; and instances have been already quoted to.
show that the rule holds good initially as between Greek
and Sanskrit. We may therefore conclude that the change of
gignomai into ginomai is not a solitary instance, and that as a general rule g may be dropped, labialised or retained before a liquid as between Greek and Sanskrit whether at the
beginning or in the body of a word. We might even discover further instances of the applicability of this rule ; for,
if t&kra is thus correctly identified with turos} we may, on



APPENDIX. 227
tlie same principle identify Sk. agra with Gk. oros, meaning top, summit. It was impossible to represent Sanskrit agra by a separate Greek word otherwise. It could not be re
presented by agros in Greek as the latter word corresponded to Sk. ajra, a field ; nor can agra be changed to akris which
represented Sk. asliri. Sanskrit agra, therefore, naturally
came to be represented by oros. Qros, meaning top or summit, has not yet been satisfactorily derived ir any other
way. It will be seen from the above that we have sufficient
grounds to hold that the rule about the omission of a gut
terai before a liquid, whether initially or medially 3 applies &o Greek and Sanskrit in the same way as it does to other
languages ^ and if so, Sk. Agrayana can be represented by Orion in Greek.
I have already quoted Brugmann to show that *agra be
comes ar or aer in Teutonic languages. Now further com
paring "L&t.integrw, integer with Pr. entier; Gk. dakru, Goth.
tagr with Eng. tear ; pagan with paieti and regen with raw, we are led to infer that where k or g is dropped before r or
a liquid we may expect two contiguous vowels, probably
because this gr is at first optionally altered into ger or gar.
We can now understand why Orion was sometimes spelt as
Marion ; and the existence of this double form, confirms, in
my opinion, the derivation above suggested. As for Orion
alone we might derive it from oros, limit, or ora, spring, and
ion, going, thus giving the same meaning, viz*, the limit o"F
the beginning of the year or spring, &sAgrayana in Sanskrit.
But this does not account for the double form Orion and
Oarion unless the latter be taken for a poetic or a dialectic
variation of Orion. I therefore prefer to derive the word
from Sanskrit Agrayana.
