PREFACE.
The widespread interest in Egyptology which has sprung
up during the last few years has produced an increased demand
for books upon every branch of the science ; Egyptologists
have striven to meet this demand, and the wants of almost
every class of student have been adequately supplied. Only
the beginner has been somewhat forgotten. One of the chief
obstacles to the study of the Egyptian language is the want of
suitable material for elementary work, that is to say editions
of texts of all periods of Egyptian history, which may be
obtained easily and at a reasonable price. The main sources
of information on ancient Egypt must always be such works
as the Description dc I'Jigypte, the Denbmiler, the Select Papyri in the
Plieratic Character in the British Museum, the editions of texts by
Mariette, etc. ; but these are only to be found in large libraries,
and their great cost puts them out of the reach of all but the
few. Moreover, many of the most important texts in them have
been republished with corrections and emendations, and they
have formed the subjects of special studies by various scholars
who have issued the results of their labours either in the form
of independent treatises or as contributions to serial archaeo
logical periodicals. Thus there has grown up around the sub
ject a large and scattered literature which the beginner cannot
penetrate alone without loss of time.
The following pages have been drawn up with the view of
helping the beginner to take his first steps in Egyptian. In



X PREFACE.
brief, they contain a sketch of the commonest and most useful
facts connected with the writing and grammar, short lists of the
signs and determinatives which occur most frequently, a short
vocabulary of about five hundred common words, a series of
thirty-one texts and extracts, with interlinear transliteration and
word for word translation, which belong to the period that lies
between B. C. 4200 and 200, and a few untransliterated and
untranslated texts, with glossary, to be worked out independently.
The Introduction is intended to enable the beginner to use with
advantage and with little loss of time any of the grammars
which he will find in English, French and German, and it is
hoped that the frequent examples of words in it will make him
familiar with the use of the alphabetic and syllabic signs and
determinatives. The hieroglyphic texts which follow the In
troduction include examples of the chief divisions of Egyptian
literature, historical, funeral, religious, moral, mythological, etc.,
and the aim has been to give passages which are at once in
teresting and complete in themselves. The translations have
been made as literal as possible.
To learn the hieroglyphic characters and words the beginner
is recommended to write them out frequently. Nothing will
help him so much in this direction as copying inscriptions, and
nothing will teach him the values of the signs and the mean
ings of determinatives and words so well as constant practice
in writing and reading texts. He should note, too, that a few
new words learnt correctly each day will, in a short time,
enable him to read new texts.

INTRODUCTION.
The first decipherer who succeeded in assigning correct values
to any of the Egyptian picture signs or hieroglyphics was Dr. Tho
mas Young, who already in 1818 had given to six ^ characters Kgyptlan
deciphervalues which are accepted at the present time ; the values of ment.
three others ^ were correctly stated as far as the consonants are
concerned. Four years later M. Jean Francois ChampoUion pub
lished a complete system of decipherment, and was the hrst
European in modern times who was able to translate Egyptian
inscriptions and to understand them. He recovered the long lost
alphabet, and deduced the values of many of the syllabic signs
from a careful and exhaustive examination of all the names and
titles of Greek and Roman kings of Egypt which are found
written in hieroglyphic characters, and from the bilingual inscrip
tions in Greek and Egyptian which are found on an obelisk that
stood originally'^ on the island of Philae, and on the famous
Rosetta Stone now preserved in the British Museum.*
2 Vi:(., and |1 which he read bir, ole, and osh or o.<f, instead of
ba, r or /, and s ; if \vc accept the value of qeb for some would do,
we must not forget that Young assigned the value of ke to this sign.
3 It was discovered by Mr. J. W. Bankes in 18 15, and was removed at his expense by G. Belzoni to be set up at Kingston Hall in Dorsetshire. Both
obelisk and pedestal are of red granite; the former is inscribed with one co
lumn of hieroglyphics on each side, and the latter with 24 lines of Greek.

INTRODUCTION.
Great antiquity of picture writing.
Permanence of hieroglyphic characters.
Various kinds of hieroglyphic writing.
The inventors of the Egyptian system of picture writing are
unknown and it is impossible either to assign a date to the per
iod when it was introduced into Egypt, or to say what people
first made use of it ; that it belongs to a remote antiquity is
certain. It is a remarkable fact that, whereas the ancient inhabi
tants of Mesopotamia, who wrote their inscriptions in cuneiform
characters which were originally pictures like the Egyptian signs,^
modified them in such a way that their original forms had dis
appeared some thousands of years before Christ, the Egyptians
preserved the original forms of their picture signs from the time
of the first historical king Mena to the period of the rule of the
Roman Emperors, that is to say for a space of about five thou
sand years.
Egyptian writing exists in three forms to which the names
Hieroglyphic, Hieratic and Demotic have been given. Hiero
glyphic^ or picture writing is^the earliest form known, and it
remained in constant use in all periods of Egyptian history ; it
was employed chiefly for monumental purposes, i. e., for inscrip
tions upon tombs of all kinds, temples, stelae, etc. The oldest
hieroglyphic inscriptions are probably those which are found in
the mastaha tomb of Seker-kha-baiu, which MM. Mariette and
Maspero believe to belong to the period of the first dynasty or
^ This fact is proved by the fragment of a baked clay tablet, found on the
site of the ancient Nineveh, whereon we have a number of cuneiform charac
ters and the original pictures from which they have been developed arranged
in parallel columns. The fragment is exhibited in the Nineveh Gallery, Table
case B. No. K. 8520 ; for the literature see Bezold, Catalogue of the Cuneiform
Tablets in the Kouyunjik Collection, vol. II., p. 934.
^ The first to describe the hieroglyphic characters systematically was the late
Dr. Birch. In'QunsQri's Egypt's Place in Universal History, Yo\. i. London, 1867,
pp. 505 — 579 he quoted, with references, some 890 signs, and gave 201 deter
minatives. Lists of characters have also been given by de Rouge, Chrestoma
thie Egyptienne, Paris, 1867, p. 86 ff. ; Brugsch, Hieroglyphische Grammatik,
Leipzig, 1872, pp. 119 — 138 ; Loret, Manuel de la Langue Egyptienne, Paris,
1889, pp. ii3 — 135 ; and Erman, Aegyptische Grammatik, Berlin, 1894, pp. 171
193.



INTRODUCTION. 3
earlier. Hieratic is a form of writing in which only the most
salient features of the hieroglyphics or pictures are preserved. ^
It originated, no doubt, in the hastily written memoranda and
drafts of inscriptions with which the scribes supplied the masons
or sculptors who cut hieroglyphics in stone, and subsequently it
was much used in making copies of literary compositions on
papyrus, and for letters, etc. Demotic ^ is an abbreviated form
of hieratic writing which was much used in legal documents
from about B. C. 650 to the Roman period.
Hieroglyphics are written in columns or in horizontal lines pfiaeo^ra
which are sometimes to be read from left to riffht, and some- P}?^
' Hieroglytimes from right to left. In the former case the writing follows phic in1 T- 1 • • scriptions.
the direction m which Assyrian and Ethiopic texts are written,
and in the latter that of inscriptions in Phoenician, Syriac and
Arabic. This being so it is impossible to say which is the pro
per direction ; there seems to be no example of a text written
from left to right, and from right to left, alternately {^ovgtqo
q)rjd6v) as is found in Himyaritic. To ascertain the direction in
which an inscription is to be read we observe in which way
men, and birds, and animals face, and then read towards
them. When hieroglyphics are written in columns this rule
generally enables us to ascertain the correct order of the letters
in the words. Allowance must, however, be made at times
for the scribe's ideas of symmetry which made him misplace
a letter that the balance of the arrangement of the hierogly
phics might be maintained. The following examples explain
this paragraph.

Hieratic is usually written in horizontal lines which are to be
read from right to left, but in some papyri of the Xllth dy
nasty preserved at Berlin and in the British Museum the texts
are arranged in short columns. Demotic texts are usually read
from right to left.
Every hieroglyphic could be used either to express an idea,
in which case it is called an ideograph, or as a character which
represented a sound, in which case it is called a phonetic ; phon
etic characters may be either alphabetic or syllabic. Thus

red (for remd\ represents a man, -^^i:^ maa, an eye, ^=1^ hentasu, a
lizard, vidu, a lion, JT^^ mdiait, a pair of scales, sa, a
goose, and so on ; these are examples of ideographs. But g
is the letter /, is the letter /, is the letter r, ci^^a
is the letter /, and so on. The signs g, , and
represent a door, a worm or snake of some kind, a mouth, and
a hand, and, originally, when used as ideographs, would pro
bably be pronounced ptah (?), fent, re and tet ; at a very early
period, however, these, together with about twenty other ideo
graphs, were set apart to represent alphabetic sounds. These
sounds seem to have been obtained in the following way : the Origin of
sound of the first letter in the name of an object was given to signs.^^^''^
the picture or character which represented it, and henceforward
the character bore that phonetic value. Thus ^ is the picture
of a door made up of a number of boards fastened together by
three cross-pieces at the back, and there is no doubt that the
word for door was connected with the root pth "to open", and
that it was pronounced something like ptah (compare the He
brew njnS pethaK) ; the sound of the hrst letter of ptah is /, and
henceforward the phonetic value of ^ was Similarly to the
signs , <:z^ and c::^:^, the initial sounds of the words for
which were /, r, and /, were assigned the alphabetic values of
/, r, and /. Signs having alphabetic values are used to form
words without any reference to their ideographic meanings. Thus
the group of signs ^^^^^ sfnt forms the word for "knife".
The first p is the picture of the back of a chair, ^^-c^ as we
have seen is the picture for a snake, aaaaaa is the picture of the
wavy surface of water, and cz^r^a as we have seen, of a hand ;
the last two signs are determifiative characters which will be dis
cussed presently. Now in the word sfnt all these signs are used Names of
to express sounds only, and their original ideographic meanings usecfa?^^
of chair-back, snake, water, and hand are not considered. The ^^^^^^^^^^^
Egyptians must have found at a very early date that when they reference

6 INTRODUCTION.
were obliged to use their ideographic signs to express alpha
betic sounds only, or perhaps they found it necessary to pre
serve words by writing them alphabetically. Be this as it may,*
the use of alphabetic signs in Egypt is very ancient, for in the
oldest inscriptions they appear side by side with signs used ideo
graphically. Why the Egyptians did not go a step farther and
abolish all signs which were not used alphabetically cannot be
said ; we owe them much, however, for our English alphabet
is derived from the cursive hieratic forms of certain hierogly
phics through the Phoenician and Greek alphabets.^ The Egyp

Arabic, and the like, and it is equally clear that only the con
sonants which constitute the pith and substance of the language
were set down as real letters, whilst, of the vowel-sounds, only
the fuller ones, and even those not always, were represented by
certain consonants. The pronunciation of Egyptian words was,
of course, known to the educated in all periods, but curiously
enough the Egyptians never invented a system of marks like
the "points" in Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac, whereby the correct Conso
nants used
vocalisation of every word was preserved. Speaking generally, for vowels,
the three primary vowel sounds A, I, U, were represented by

"good" is usually transcribed nefer, ^ 7itr "God" by neter, and

Ideographic signs, i. e., those which express an idea, are some
times to be interpreted literally, and sometimes symbolically,
thus ^ se^ "nest", seyd "field", ^ dneh "wall",
j| texen
"obelisk", are examples of ideographs which are to be under
stood literally ; but the musical instrument J is symbolic of
"happiness", the seal g of "treasure", the instrument of "God",
the bier of "death", and so on.
The phonetic values of ideographic signs were employed in
the spelling of words without any reference to the original ideo
graphic meaning. Thus ^^^x., the picture of a digging tool, the
phonetic value of which is mer, is found in the words ^ ^ ^
mer "to love", ^ meri "tree", -<g>- mer "eye", simply
because it has the syllabic value of mer. Again v.^-^, the picture
of a branch of a tree, is found in the words em yet
"after", and ^ yd "to engrave", etc., but only as a syl
labic value. In theory every hieroglyphic could be used both as
an ideograph and as a syllable. Some ideographs have more
than one phonetic value, in which case they are called poly
phones, and many different ideographs have similar values, in
which case they are called homophones. The following signs
and their values should be learnt by heart :

As long as the Egyptians used picture writing pure and simple
their meaning was easily understood, but when they began to
spell their words with alphabetic signs and syllabic values of
picture signs which had no reference whatever to the original
meaning of the signs, it was at once found necessary to indicate
in some way the meaning and even sounds of many of the words
so written ; this they did by adding to them signs which we
call determinatives. It is impossible to say when the Egyptians
first began to add determinatives to their words, but all hiero

12 INTRODUCTION.
Great antiquity of the use of determinatives.
glyphic inscriptions known contain them, and it would seem
that they originated in prehistoric times. It is, however, clear
that they occur less frequently in the texts of the earlier than
of the later dynasties. The following example will show how
determinatives were added, and how ideographs were spelled
out in alphabetic signs, and what alterations were made when
ancient texts were copied by scribes.

The version given in (i) is from the pyramid of Unas, the
last king of the Vth dynasty, and that in (2) is from a coffin of
the Xlth or Xllth dynasty (see Maspero, J^ec. de Trav., t. Ill, p. 201).
It frequently happened that two or more words of different
meanings had the same sound ; in such cases the proper deter
minative is most useful in determining the exact sense of a word.
Thus I " ° dhd "to stand", and ^ " ° dhd "boat", are two
words having the same sound but different meanmgs ; m the

Determinatives may be divided into two groups : those which General
determine a single species, and those which determine a whole ^^^^ deter
class. Examples of the first group are teien "obelisk", minatives.

words for them written in alphabetic and syllabic characters.

to need no determinative.

may be transliterated : — du dri-nd heseset red hereret neteru hers

em knit dn pet em nevimat-d §em-d her-sa yent dri-nd em madt mer

"I have done {du dri-nd) what is pleasing {heseset) to men {reO)^
and what is gratifying [hereret) unto the gods {neterii) ; because of

It has been shown on p. 17 how variant readings supply the o/findh'ig
correct values of many syllabic signs, and it is self-evident that tl^c mcan
the probable meaning of many words can be at once known by words,
the determinatives which follow them, but there remains a large
number of words the exact meaning of which cannot be exactly
stated by the help of the hieroglyphics only. The early deci
pherers of the cuneiform inscriptions, when once they had ob
tained the alphabetic and syllabic values of the signs, relied
largely on their knowledge of the languages cognate to that
which they were studying for help in determining verbal forms, j^^p^j.^
and for a supply of roots which, having made allowances for ance of
cognate
change in letters, etc., they believed would give them a clue to languages
the meanings which they sought. Thus Sir Henry Rawlinson p^^erment
relied upon Zend and Sanskrit in his immortal work on the ^} cunei
^ rorm and Behistun Inscription, and Norris and others succeeded in de- hieroglyphic in
ciphering Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions by the help of scriptions.



20 INTRODUCTION.
Great value of Coptic.
Ancient Egyptian words preserved in Coptic.
Hebrew and other Semitic dialects. Now although Egyptian is,
in many particulars, similar to the great family of Semitic
languages, yet among them all there is none which is as val
uable in explaining its words and grammar as are Zend and
Sanskrit to the Persian cuneiform inscriptions, and as are Hebrew,
Syriac, and Chaldee to the cuneiform inscriptions which are
written in the Semitic dialects of the ancient dwellers in the
land which lay between the Tigris and Euphrates. We must,
then, look elsewhere for help in determining the meaning of
Egyptian words, and we find it in the language called Coptic,
i. e., the Egyptian language of the Graeco-Roman period which
is written in Greek letters, and has been preserved for us chiefly
by the ecclesiastical literature of the Egyptian Christians. Early
in the first quarter of this century Champollion found it of the
greatest value in deciphering the hieroglyphic inscriptions, in
deed it is most probable that without the great knowledge of
Coptic which he possessed his labours would never have been
crowned with such brilliant success ; the value of the study of
this language remains undiminished for the purposes of Egyptian
philology, and every student of hieroglyphics should make him
self acquainted with as much of it as possible.^
It is not possible to say when the Egyptian language was
first written in Greek letters ; some believe the Bible to have
been translated into Coptic in the second and others in the
eighth century of our era. Be that as it may, it is a fact that
Coptic has preserved a large number of the words which are
found in ancient hieroglyphic inscriptions, and when an allow
ance has been made for phonetic decay and for the changes
of letters which occur in all dialects of cognate languages, it is
found that the meanings of words suggested by their deter
minatives are confirmed, that new ones are supplied, that many
^ The beginner will find SteindorfF's Koptische Grammatik, Berlin, 1894,
a very useful book ; it contains 64 pages of Coptic text and a vocabulary
which will carry him on to larger works.



INTRODUCTION. 21
grammatical forms, etc., can be identified, and. that the vowels
which are added to the words in Coptic indicate the correct
vocalization. Where there exists no Coptic equivalent of a word,
the meaning of which cannot be decided by its determinative,
the sense of that word can only be guessed at. The following
examples show the close connection of Egyptian and Coptic
words.

The dual. In the oldest inscriptions the dual is usually expressed by
doubling the ideograph ; e. g., mesferui "two ears",

"two horizons", ^^^^^^^^^^ haui neterui "two souls divine",
etc. Frequently the word is spelt alphabetically or syllabically
and is determined by the double ideograph ; e. g.,
^
petti "two heavens", S ^ \ ^^^^^ "two sides", "two
lights", s=J^o^| debut "two soles of the feet", etc. Some
times w is the mark of the dual in the early texts, e. g., ^ °^;:z^

should be written 1 1, indicated the dual to the latest times;

Adjectives are without degrees of comparison in Egyptian, but
the comparative and superlative may be expressed in the fol

Egyptian Christians, have preserved, in a corrupt form, the old
Egyptian names of the months, which read :

Thoth, the first month of the Egyptian year, began on the
29th of August.
The verb.
The consideration of the Egyptian verb, or stem-word, is a
difficult subject which can only be properly illustrated by a large
number of extracts from texts of all periods. Egyptologists have,
moreover, agreed neither as to the manner in which it should
be treated, nor as to the classification of the forms which have
been distinguished. The older generation of scholars were un
decided as to the class of languages under which the Egyptian

language should be placed, and contented themselves with point
ing out grammatical forms analogous to those in Coptic, and
perhaps in some of the Semitic dialects ; but the modern Ger
man Egyptologists boldly affirm the relationship of Egyptian to
the Semitic family of languages, and the most recent exponent
of this view applies the nomenclature of the Semitic verb or The stcm
stem-word to that of Egyptian. word.
The Egyptian stem -word may be indifferently a verb or a
noun ; thus ^ y^eper means both "to be", and the "thing which
hath come into being" ; so likewise J nefer may mean "to be
good", and a ."thing which is good", and placed after a noun
it becomes the adjective "good", as we see from the following :

J p^ p^ ^ ^
;/^y;r set her dh-sen "good is it for
their hearts" ; J '^^^ t^^^!
ren-k nefer em rey en seru "thy name is good in the opinion of
princes" ; ^ J hru nefer "a good day" ; with the
addition of the prefix Jj ^ bu, nefer means "prosperity", "good
ness", "happiness", e. g.,
bu - 7iefer yeper em bu - ban
prosperity turneth into adversity.
Returning to the word yeper : by the addition of ^ d we The stem
1 O^kR. u^ 15 UT 5' 1 1 J J- • r 1^ WOXA with
have I am , or I was ; by the addition ot ^3^^ additions,
the stem-word has a participial meaning like "being" or "be
coming" ; by the addition of ^| I in the masc. and 0} 1 in
the fem. yeper becomes a noun in the plural meaning "things
which exist", "created things", and the like ; by the addition of
(j ^ a we have ^ (j ^ yeperd "the god to whom it belongeth to
make things come into being", etc.
Stem-words in Egyptian, like those in Hebrew and other Se
mitic dialects, consist of two, three, four and five consonants,
as examples of which may be cited qem "to find".



38 INTRODUCTION.
Biliteral roots.
Formation of other roots.
Uncertainty of pronunciation.
The Causative.
^
y^esef "to drive back", 1 ® I ^ ^ A seise-j^ "to flee", /
nemesmes "to heap up". The stem-words with three consonants,
which are ordinarily regarded as triliteral roots, may be re
duced to two consonants, w^hich were pronounced by the help
of some vowel between ; these we may call primary or biliteral
roots. Originally all roots consisted of one syllable. By the
addition of feeble consonants in the middle or at the end of the
monosyllabic root, or by repeating the second consonant roots
of three letters were formed. Roots of four consonants are
formed by adding a fourth consonant or by combining two
roots of tw^o letters ; and so on. Speaking generally, the Egyptian
verb has no conjugations or species, like Hebrew and the other
Semitic dialects, and no Perfect (Preterite) or Imperfect (Future)
tenses, but Dr. Erman believes in the existence of the Infinitive
and Imperative Moods and of a Participle. The exact pronun
ciation of a great many verbs must always remain unknown,
because the Egyptians never invented a system of vocalisation
like the Massorah of the sages of Tiberias, or like the additions
and the modifications in the forms of the letters to express the
vowels adopted by the Ethiopians, or even any means of in
dicating the chief vowel sounds like the Syrians and Arabs ;
but very good guesses may sometimes be made by the help
of the Coptic forms of words which are common to the two
languages.
There is in Egyptian a derivative formation of the word
stem or verb, which is made by the addition of —^ or 1 1 to the
simple form of the verb, and which has a causative signification ;

Adverbs.
In Egyptian the prepositions and certain substantives and
adjectives to which <=> er is prefixed take the place of adverbs



INTRODUCTION. 43
e.g., the preposition [|^^ "in" becomes the adverb "there".
Other examples of adverbs are : — <::^ Jj ^ ^ £^
er bunre "outside" ; <:zz> [j ; er dqer "very much", "exceed
ingly", er da ur "very much indeed", "exceed
ingly".
Prepositions.
Prepositions, which may also be used adverbially, are simple
and compound. The simple prepositions are : — aaaaaa en for, to,
in, because ; em from, out of, in, into, on, of, among, as,
conformably to, as, with, in the state of, if, when, and em some
times introduces a quotation ; <c=:> er to, into, against, by, at,
