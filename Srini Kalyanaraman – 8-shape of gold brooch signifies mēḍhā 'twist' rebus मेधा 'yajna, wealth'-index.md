Ancient Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization Ornaments
This collection of gold and agate ornaments includes objects found at both Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. At the top are fillets of hammered gold that would have been worn around the forehead. The other ornaments include bangles, chokers, long pendant necklaces, rings, earrings, conical hair ornaments, and broaches. Such ornaments were never buried with the dead, but were passed on from one generation to the next. These ornaments were hidden under the floors in the homes of wealthy merchants or goldsmiths. -- Jonathan Mark Kenoyer https://www.harappa.com/slide/ancient-indus-ornaments Gold and agate ornaments includes objects found at both Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. At the top are fillets of finely burnished hammered gold that would have been worn around the forehead. Each end of the top fillet is decorated with a punctuated design depicting the ritual offering stand that is common on the unicorn seals. The third ornament from the top was probably worn with the center point at the top of the forehead and the sides curving down over the eyebrows. The hole at the center and on the ends were for holding a cord. The other ornaments include bangles, chokers, long pendant necklaces, rings, earrings, conical hair ornaments, and broaches. Such ornaments were never buried with the dead, but were passed on from one generation to the next. These ornaments were hidden under the floors in the homes of wealthy merchants or goldsmiths.
