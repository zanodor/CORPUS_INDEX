Alcyone (Pleiades): the cosmic Origin
By TPS Editor November 22, 2017 Signs of the Heavens
On November 22nd of each year, right on the line of passage between the Signs of Scorpio and
Sagittarius, a fundamental direction between solar and cosmic Centers is turned on: this Day is that
Degree of the orbital revolution that sees our Earth aligned between the central volcano/Vulcan of the Sun
and the other “Central Sun” Alcyone of the Pleiades.
According to the esoteric Tradition, Alcyone is the Origin and central pivot of the Seven solar systems (the
cosmic Septenary) of which ours is part.

Our Earth, seen from the Sun, therefore flies in the heavenly field qualified by the stars of the Bull, of
which the open cluster of the Pleiades is ‘part’ (formally, in content and essence).[1]
The Stars of the “onward rushing” Animal are referred to as the cosmic Sources of Light, the rhythmic
impulse of Fire.
The Bull is Horus, the fruit of the relationship between Isis and Osiris, the unceasingly desired Son ‘faced’
by the Hunter Orion, the heavenly Osiris, together with His divine Spouse Sirius/Isis, the Sun of Suns.
This is the most beautiful and radiant part of Heaven, home of many primary Stars:



In particular, the bright Pleiades Chariot, led by the central Alcyone, hurtles through the cosmic flashes of
the Bull and the ‘initiatory’ ones of the celestial Ram, another sacred and impetuous Animal/constellation
which still gives the name to the First sector or Sign of the celestial cycle and coordinates: the Ram/Aries
is the Beginning, despite the fact that Its stars no longer stand (for the phenomenon of the precession of
equinoxes) behind the apparent Sun on the “first day of spring”, now lined up between the stars of the
Fishes and those of the Bringer of Water (the coming “New Age”).
Similarly, the Tradition identifies the Seven Sisters as the Spring Stars (from the Latin Vergiliae), as They
were ruling (with Aldebaran, the Eye of the Bull) the Equinox at the Beginning of a major Cycle (the Kali
Yuga of 432,000 years.



Vernal Equinox 3,102 BC
Thus the precession cycle of around 25,000 years was called “the Great Year of the Pleiades” – see also
this article).
This primary forge of stars is indicated in the theosophical texts as the central group of the sidereal
astronomy system, referring to a rotation of Seven solar Systems including ours (the “local universe”)
around the star Alcyone, defined as “the central point around which our Universe of fixed stars revolves,
the focus from which, and into which the divine breath, MOTION, works incessantly during the Manvantara
[cycle of Manifestation].”[2].
“The Sun (that is, the solar system) has Alcyone, in the Pleiades, as the center of its orbit.” (EA, 669)
This rotation of 250,000 years is a cycle not known by ordinary astronomy and is significantly resonating
both with the Sun revolution around the galactic center (around 250 million of years) and the precessional
cycle of about 25,000 years of our Earth, originally called as mentioned ‘the great year of the Pleiades’. 25
is a Number qualitatively associated to 1/4, the fourth part of the One (100/4=25), that is the Quaternary
and “squaring of the Circle”: Ideas’ manifestation through Form.
It is said in Esoteric Astrology that the Pleiades are the vehicle of manifestation of the “Third Aspect”
(Substance-Appearance) of a Great Cosmic Being which, with the Great Bear (First Aspect: Spirit-Life)
and the Little Bear (Second Aspect: Soul-Quality) through the “local” regency of Sirius (reflection of the
Second Aspect), gave Origin to the Seven solar Systems of which ours is part. The Bears and the
Pleiades, with Sirius as an intermediate point of focus, constitute the spiritual Triad which governs the
spiral cyclic activity of our solar system:
“The Pleiades are to the solar system, the source of electrical energy, and just as our sun is the
embodiment of the heart, or love aspect, of the Logos (Who is Himself the heart of ONE ABOUT WHOM
NAUGHT MAY BE SAID) so the Pleiades are the feminine opposite of Brahma [the vehicle of the Third
Aspect, the Creator].”[3]
They are mothers of the seven aspects of formal life and wives of the Seven Sages of the Great Bear.
“They are related to the Mother aspect that feeds the Christ-child [the solar system].”
“... the Pleiades—though they are regarded as embodying the matter aspect in manifestation—are in
reality and literally the expression of that Principle of Life which we call vitality, prana in its various stages
or degrees, ether or substance.”[4]
The energies of the Pleiades, which animate the whole matter of our ‘local’ universe, are therefore in
relation to the active Intelligence of our Solar Lord or Logos, and especially the Alcyone star is Its origin,
the central magnet of the solar Substance, the cosmic creative “throat center”.
Thus Alcione is called by the Teaching “the Star of the Individual” or “Star of Intelligence”, and is connected
to humanity not only through Taurus, but also Aquarius, the rising Sign of universal Service.



“The seven stars of the Pleiades are the goal for the seven types [of the liberated humanity], and this is
hinted at in the Book of Job, in the words, “Canst thou bind the sweet influence of the Pleiades?” In the
mystery of this influence, and in the secret of the sun Sirius, are hidden the facts of our cosmic evolution,
and incidentally, therefore, of our solar system.”[5]
The Pleiades are to Sirius as Earth is to Venus, as the Person is to the Soul:
“...in a peculiar and esoteric sense the sun Sirius and the Pleiades hold a close relation to each other. It is
a relation analogous to that which lower mind holds to higher mind. The lower is receptive to, or negatively
polarised to the higher. Sirius is the seat of higher mind and mahat (as it is called, or universal mind)
sweeps into manifestation in our solar system through the channel of the Pleiades. It is almost as if a great
triangle of mahatic energy was thus formed. Sirius transmits energy to our solar system via that
“...sevenfold brooding Mother, the silver constellation, whose voice is as a tinkling bell, and whose feet
pass lightly o’er the radiant path between our worlds and hers.”
Within the solar system there is an interesting correspondence to this cosmic interplay in the relation
between the Venus scheme, our Earth scheme and the Venus chain in our scheme.
Curiously enough it will be through a comprehension of the human antahkarana, or the path which links



higher and lower mind and which is constructed by the Thinker during the process of evolution, that light
on this abstruse matter will come.”[6]
Finally, it seems significant to recall the names with which Alcyone
was previously known: among the Arabs is Al Wasat, the Central (the
heavenly Hen with its chicks), the Babylonians called it Temennu, the
first Stone (the cornerstone of their temples), for the Chaldeans It
was Kimah, the Immortal Seal, the Pivot, and among the Hindus is
Amba, the Mother; the first ‘nakshatra’ of Indian astrology is centered
on the star Alcyone and Pleiades bearing the name of Krittika (the
“Knives” in Sanskrit), “the stars of fire” mothers of Kartikeia, [7] the
Indian God of War, the General of the Celestial Armies (identical to
Michael, the ‘Chief of the Celestial Legions’ and Mars as the carrier of
Sun/Vulcan’s Will), symbolized by a flame and governed by Agni, the
god of sacred fire.
*
Alcyone/Pleiades is therefore the cosmic source of Light, of creative
Intelligence of spatial Substance, and Earth, 3rd Ray, and Humanity, the 3rd planetary Throat Centre, are
two of Its direct precipitation and distribution centers.
On the day of Sun-Earth-Alcyone alignment on the Ecliptic, the presence of such focal centers on the
same Plan of Love and Light entails the vital impulse for orienting to the heavenly Will and fulfilling the
evolutionary and unitary Purpose.
Today, the human planetary Order which the synthesis of human spirits essentially is, oriented to the
crucial date of 2025, receives and transmits the 3rd cosmic Ray of Creative Intelligence. This cosmic Rays
impulsion is impressed and sown, on the Ecliptic Plane of Love and Light and in all human hearts, by the
3rd Department of this inner Order of Spirits or prototype of a hierarchical Humanity and through seven
relevant Intentions, Directions or Formulas, for the benefit of our beloved Blue Planet.
As it has been sown for the 1st Ray on Sun-Earth-Merak alignment, the 2nd Ray on Sun-Earth-Sirius
alignment, the 4th-6th on Aldebaran-Sun-Earth-Antares alignment, the 5th Ray on Regulus-Earth-Sun
alignment and the 7th Ray on Sun-Earth-Fomalhaut alignment, the human Hierarchy impresses on
Earth a Third Ray thought-form made of seven living centers:
3.1 I initialize egoic contacts
3.2 I trace the initiatory way
3.3 I ILLUMINATE THE PLANETARY PURPOSE
3.4 I lead the regular advancement of the [human] group



3.5 I plan the rhythms and cycles of advancement
3.6 I feed the sacred Fire
3.7 I research the dialogue with the Infinite
1 “The entire secret of divine purpose and planning is hidden in this sign, owing fundamentally to the relation of the
Pleiades to the constellation, the Great Bear, and to our solar system. This constitutes one of the most important
triangles in our entire cosmic series of relationships and this importance is also enhanced by the fact that the “eye
of the Bull” is the eye of revelation. The underlying goal of the evolutionary process—”the onward rush of the Bull of
God,” as it is esoterically called—reveals steadily and without cessation the stupendous and sublime plan of Deity.
This is the subject which light reveals.
THERE IS AT THIS TIME, OWING TO THE INFLUX OF THE SHAMBALLA FORCE, THE ESTABLISHING
OF A PECULIAR RELATION OR ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE CONSTELLATION, TAURUS (WITH ITS
OWN SPECIFIC ALIGNMENT WITH THE PLEIADES AND GREAT BEAR) THE PLANET, PLUTO, AND
OUR EARTH. THIS PRODUCES MUCH OF THE PRESENT WORLD DIFFICULTY AND ONE WHICH
THE MODERN ASTROLOGER WOULD DO WELL TO CONSIDER. IT CONSTITUTES A MAJOR
COSMIC TRIANGLE AT THIS TIME, CONDITIONING MUCH THAT IS NOW HAPPENING.
THIS SHAMBALLA FORCE IS THAT WHICH “FANS OR INTENSIFIES THE LIGHT BY THE REMOVAL
OF OBSTRUCTIONS AND PROCEEDS FROM FAR DISTANT PLACES, POURING THROUGH THE EYE
OF ILLUMINATION INTO THOSE SPHERES OF INFLUENCE UPON THE SORROWFUL PLANET, THE
EARTH, IMPELLING THE BULL UPON ITS ONWARD RUSH.” SO SPEAKS THE OLD COMMENTARY.
THE IMPORT OF THIS IS THAT THE ENERGY OF WILL—NEWLY RELEASED BY SANAT KUMARA
UPON OUR PLANET—EMANATES, VIA THE HEAD CENTRE OF THE PLANETARY LOGOS, FROM
THE GREAT BEAR; IT IS STEPPED DOWN IN VIBRATION VIA ONE OF THE PLEIADES (HENCE ITS
INFLUENCE UPON MATTER AND HENCE ALSO ITS PRONOUNCED TAURIAN EFFECTS UPON
HUMANITY) AND SO ENTERS INTO THE SOLAR SYSTEM. IT IS THERE ABSORBED BY THAT
MAJOR CENTRE OF OUR PLANETARY LIFE TO WHICH WE GIVE THE NAME, SHAMBALLA.”
