Tłı̨ chǫ
"Taicho" redirects here. For the 8th century Japanese monk, see
Taichō.
This article is about the Tłı̨chǫ people. For the language, see Tłı̨chǫ
language.
The Tłı̨ chǫ (Athabaskan pronunciation: [tɬhĩtʃhõ], English: /təˈlɪtʃoʊ/)
people, sometimes spelled Tlicho and also known as the Dogrib, are
a Dene First Nations people of the Athabaskan-speaking
ethnolinguistic group living in the Northwest Territories, Canada. The
name Dogrib is an English adaptation of their own name, Tłı̨chǫ Done
(or Thlingchadinne) - “Dog-Flank People”, referring to their fabled
descent from a supernatural dog-man. Like their Dene neighbours
they called themselves oft simply Done ("person", "human") or Done
Do ("People, i.e. Dene People"). The Tłı̨chǫ's land is known as Ndé
(or Dé, Dèe or Né). On the 1682 Franquelin map, Dogrib was
recorded as "Alimousp[i]goiak" (from Cree Alimospikayak, "Dog
Flanks").
There are now six settlements with
Dogrib populations or mostly of
Dogrib background: Behchoko
(formerly Rae-Edzo), Whatì (Lac la
Martre), Gamèti (Rae Lakes),
Wekweeti (Snare Lake), Dettah, and
Ndilǫ (Rainbow Valley) (a
subcommunity of Yellowknife, known
by the Tłįchǫ as Somba K'e – "where
the money is").
The Tłı̨chǫ Yatı̀ı or Dogrib language



Tlicho communities in the Northwest Territories
belongs to the Athabaskan
languages, which are part of the Na
Dené languages family. The dialect spoken in the communities of
Dettah and Ndilǫ developed from intermarriage between
Yellowknives and Tłįchǫ.
Treaty Process
Yellowknife B Band (Treaty No. 8 Dogrib)
In June 1899, negotiation began on Treaty No. 8, which covered
840,000 square kilometers in the Northwest Territory. It was an
agreement between the Canadian Government and the Dene groups
in the area in question; in return for their willingness to share their
land with non-Natives, the Dene would receive medical and
educational assistance, as well as treaty payments. The Canadian
Government and the various Dene groups, including Yellowknives
and Tłįchǫ under chief Drygeese with headmen Benaiyah and
Sek'eglinan, signed the treaty in 1900 at Fort Resolution (called by
the Tłįchǫ Įndàà). After the signing, the group that signed the treaty
was called the "Yellowknife B Band" (Helm, 7: 1994). At that point in
history, Treaty No.8 was the largest land settlement the Canadian
Government had ever made (PWNHC, Historical).[2]
Dog Rib Rae Band (Treaty No. 11 Dogrib)
Twenty years after Treaty No. 8 was signed, oil was discovered in the
Mackenzie River Valley. Upon the discovery, the Canadian
Government proposed another treaty that would clear the way for
miners and development of the area. The treaty was greatly debated,
as the Natives did not want to lose their right to hunt, fish, gather,
and trap in the area. They also opposed being "confined to Indian
reserves." Many Dene felt that Treaty No. 8 was not honored by the



Canadian Government, and some were afraid that this treaty would
turn out similarly. Nevertheless, Treaty No. 11 was signed by the
Tłįchǫ trading chief Monfwi in the summer of 1921. The Tłįchǫ
groups that signed this treaty were then known as the "Dog Rib Rae
Band" (Helm, 7: 1994), constituting the majority of the Tłįchǫ
population. Both Treaty No. 8 and Treaty No. 11 overlap in several of
their boundaries, and continue to cause conflict between the two
separate treaty bands (nowadays two First Nations).
Not all members of the Dene and Tłįchǫ communities agreed with or
signed these treaties. In the fall of 1992, the Tłįchǫ submitted their
own regional claim to the Canadian government. Negotiations were
scheduled to begin in 1994 between the Yellowknife B Band (Treaty
No. 8 Dogrib) and the Dog Rib Rae Band (Treaty No. 11 Dogrib), but
the Yellowknife B Band refused to enter into negotiations. This
complicated matters, as both treaty groups had land boundaries that
overlapped each other. Self-governance seemed to be the issue
between the two groups, as both wanted to have their say in the
agreement. This halted the negotiations in 1994 while the Canadian
government explored the boundary and self-government issue. A
new mandate in April 1997 allowed negotiation of a "joint land claims
and self-government agreement with the Dogrib Treaty 11 Council"
(Treaty No. 11 Dogrib). In 1999, the Agreement-in-Principle was
available for Dogrib approval and was accepted on January 7, 2000.
Ninety-three percent of the Dog Rib Rae Band (Treaty No. 11 Dogrib)
turned out to vote with over 84% voting for the agreement. After
several community discussions and revisions, in March 2003 the
Chief Negotiators initialed the agreement.
Tłįchǫ First Nations
Yellowknives Dene First Nation (formerly Yellowknife B Band)



The Yellowknife B Band (Treaty No. 8 Dogrib) formed the
Yellowknives Dene First Nation[3] in 1991 following the collapse of
this territorial-wide comprehensive land claim negotiation. They
currently negotiate a land claim settlement for their lands as part of
the Akaitcho Land Claim Process[4] by the Akaitcho Territory
Government. The Yellowknives Dene First Nation (known by
themselves as Weledeh Yellowknives Dene)[5] is the umbrella
organization for the Dettah Yellowknives Dene First Nation (or Detah
- 'Burnt Point' in Tłįchǫ, referring to a traditional Dene fishing camp)
and Ndilǫ Yellowknives Dene First Nation (/ˈdiːloʊ/ DEE-loh). They
speak the Dettah-Ndilǫ dialect of Tłįchǫ and are descendants of
Tłįchǫ, Yellowknives and Chipewyan.
Tlicho Government (formerly Dog Rib Rae Band)
The Tlicho Agreement
The act of signing the agreement began the ratification process for
the Tlicho Agreement. On Thursday, August 4, 2005, the Tlicho
Agreement went into full effect, "The first official day of the Tlicho
Government and the Tlicho community governments" (Tlicho
Effective Date). On August 25, 2003, they signed a land claims
agreement, also called Tłįchǫ, as the Tlicho Government, with the
Government of Canada. The agreement will cede a 39,000 square
kilometres (15,100 sq mi) area between Great Bear Lake and Great
Slave Lake in the NWT to Tłįchǫ ownership. The territory includes the
communities of Behchoko,[6] Gamèti,[7] Wekweeti[8] and Whatì[9]
along with Diavik Diamond Mine and Ekati Diamond Mine. The four
bands, Dogrib Rae Band, Whatí First Nation, Gaméti First Nation and
Dechi Laotʼi First Nation and the Dogrib Treaty 11 Council, ceased to
exist on August 4, 2005 and have been succeeded by the Tlicho
Government (or Tåîchô Government).



The Tłįchǫ will have their own legislative bodies in the area's four
communities, of which the chiefs must be Tłįchǫ, though anyone
may run for councillor and vote. The legislatures will have, among
other authorities, the power to collect taxes, levy resource royalties,
which currently go to the federal government, and control hunting,
fishing and industrial development.
The Tłįchǫ will also receive payments of $152 million over 15 years
and annual payments of approximately $3.5 million.
The federal government will retain control of criminal law, as it does
across Canada, and the NWT will control services such as health
care and education.
This land-claims process took twenty years to conclude. A similar
process with the Inuit in the NWT brought about the creation of the
new territory of Nunavut. Though Tłįchǫ will not be a separate
territory, the extent of its powers has invited comparisons both with
the birth of Nunavut and with the creation of the NWT government in
1967.

The novel White Bird Black Bird, by Val Wake, a CBC Northern
Service reporter based in Yellowknife from 1969 to 1973, tells



the story of Dogrib input into the formation of the NWT Indian
Brotherhood. A lot of the action is set in what was then called
Rae.
