Introduction
In about A.D. 370, a nomadic people called the Huns invaded Eastern Europe. Coming from the East, and having subjugated the Ostrogothic realm of Hermanarich, they established a nomadic empire which soon stretched to the Roman Danubian limes. The Hunnic empire reached its apex under the leadership of Attila (444-453). In 451, however, Attila was defeated in the "Catalaunian fields" in Gaul by the united forces of the Romans and the Visigoths. His sudden death two years later was followed by an internal power struggle among his sons during which the empire's subjugated peoples — mainly the Germanic Gepidae,

Ostrogoths, and Heruli—revolted successfully. A great battle fought in 455 on the still unidentified Pannonian river Nadao put an end to the Hunnic empire's unity and greatness. But some time later, as we learn from Jordanes, groups of Huns returned to their "inner" territory on the river Vär ( = Dnieper) in the Ukraine. There they reorganized on a smaller scale, and still held control over the Danubian Scythia Minor (modern Dobrudza). Unfortunately, sources for that period are very taciturn about Hunnic developments, but the Huns continue to be mentioned, if sporadically, until at least the middle of the sixth century. It was one of the originators of French sinology, Joseph Deguignes (1721-1800), who in 1748 first put the question of the ethnic origin of the Huns on a scholarly level." Since that time, historians, philologists, and, later, also archaeologists and ethnographers have continued the discussion. Nonetheless the question remains unresolved. Since the character of the Hunnic language has consistently held a central place in that debate, reexamination of the language is a requisite for any resolution of it.* The Hunnic problem is of importance in Ukrainian scholarship not just as an interesting academic topic. Not only did the Huns rule over the Ukraine for at least two hundred years (ca. 375-560), but also they apparently merged with successive nomadic waves in that area and had a part in Ukrainian ethnogenesis. In 1829, a Carpatho-Ukrainian scholar working in Moscow, Jurij Huca-Venelin (1802-1839), developed a theory about the Hunnic origin of the Slavs/ His theory found many supporters, including such eminent Russian scholars as the historian Dmitrij Ivanovic Ilovajskij (1832-1920)'' and the ethnographer Ivan Egorevic Zabelin (1820-1908). According to Zabelin, the Huns were the retinue (druzind) of the northern Slavs who were invited by the southern Slavs to help fight against the Goths.e In 1858, A. F. Vel'tman identified the name Huns (via the form Kwäne) with the name Kievans and proposed to call Attila "the autocrat of all Rus'."^

The reader will understand then, why, after having studied the Hunnic problem for over thirty years, I venture to present the results of my investigations in Harvard Ukrainian Studies.
A. The Sources
The works of Greek writers (especially Priscus, d. ca. 472) and Latin writers (especially Jordanes, A. D. 551, based on the work of Cassiodorus, fl. câ. 530) contain the names of some twenty-five persons among Attila's immediate kin and eight names of their close associatestogether thirty-three names over a period of some one hundred and eighty years (ca. 375-555). One can assume that all these persons spoke the same idiom. It is reasonable, then, to use this onomastic material to determine the language of the ruling clan of the so-called European Huns.1 Although contemporaneous sources include many more names of "barbarians" than the thirty-three selected here, for the time being one can dismiss these as uncertain, in consideration of the multiethnic character of any steppe empire.2

HUNNIC LANGUAGE OF THE ATTILA CLAN 431
The thirty-three names selected here are divided into two groups : (1) names of actual members of the dynasty (nos. 1-25), which seem to be either personal names or titles; (2) names of close associates of the dynasty (nos. 26-33), which frequently represent office titles, appellations, epithets, or even nicknames. The Hunnic material to be analyzed here belongs to four periods: (1) ca. A.D. 375—the time of the first name, that of the epic Hunnic ruler who allegedly entered the East European Ostrogothic realm then, as recorded by Jordanes from the Hunnic epic tradition; (2) ca. 390-420the time of names 2 to 6, which are historical, although the relationship of their bearers to Attila (and to each other) remains unknown; (3) ca. 420-480 — the names in this subdivision, including 7-21 and 26-33, are taken from the surest historical and genealogical information; (4) ca. 536-555—the fully historical names, 22-25, are of actors in the Hunnic epilogue. The Hunnic names that have come down to us are transmitted mostly in the works of fourteen contemporary (5th-6th century) Greek and Latin writers. Six Greek and two Roman writers lived in the fifth century, whereas three Greek and three Roman writers were from the sixth century. Also, four works (two Greek and two Roman) were written between the seventh and ninth century by authors who had at their disposal rich sources since then lost. We have no serious reason to question the accuracy of their data. The majority of the Hunnic names (20 of the 33) were recorded by the intelligent politician and historian Priscus of Panium in Thrace (d. after 472), who spent some time at Attila's court (448-449) as the Byzantine ambassador to the Hunnic realm. In fact, thirteen, or more than onethird, of the names are known to us only from Priscus's notations: Άδάμει^', Άτακάμ, Βασίχ, Βέριχος, Έδέκων, Έσκάμ, Ζέρκων, ΉσλανΕ0<;, Κουρσίχ, Κρέκαν, Μάμα8εη, Σκόττας, 'Ωηβάρσιον^. An earlier Byzantine. ambassador to the Huns, Olympiodorus of Thebae in Egypt, visited the Hunnic rulers in 412. In his historical writings he mentions two names unknown in other sources : Δονάτος and Χαράτων. The history of Justinian I's reign by Agathias (fl. 556) mentions two more otherwise unrecorded names: Έλμίγγειρος and Έλμινζούρ. A later but nonetheless reliable chronicler, Theophanes Byzantius (752-818), who incorporated materials from many lost sources in his work, also saved one Hunnic name: Γιέσμου8TM.

Three church historians of the first half of the fifth century transmitted several names: Socrates of Constantinople (d. 440), Sozomen of Ghazzah in Palestine (d. ca. 450), and Theodoret of Antioch (d. 451). Of the Greek authors, only Sozomen and the secular historian Zosimus (who wrote after 498) mentioned the name Οϋλδιν ~ Οϋλδης, and Socrates notes the name Οϋπταρος. The "Chronicon paschale," compiled by an unknown cleric during the reign of Heraclius I (610-641) sometime shortly after 628, contains variants of two names: Βλίδας and Δννζίριχος.3 First among the Latin authors is Jordanes, a pro-Roman Ostrogoth who in 551 (probably in Ravenna) wrote his "Getica," or history of the Goths (and Huns). In composing the work he made use of a very important (now lost) Gothic history by the Roman senator Cassiodorus (ca. 490-585), as well as of Gothic and Hunnic popular traditions. Jordanes includes thirteen Hunnic names in his work. Six of them also appear in the work of Priscus (Attila = 'Αττίλας, Bieda = Βλήδας, Dintzic = Δεγγιζίχ, Hernac = Ήρνάχ, MundzucoM = Μουνδίουχον800, Roas = 'Ρόδα8TM), one in the work of Sozomen and Zosimus (Huldin = Οϋλδιν ~ Οϋλδης) and two in the work of Socrates (petar = Οϋπταρος, Roas = 'Ρούγας). Jordanes himself preserved four Hunnic names for posterity : Balamur, Ellac, Emnetzur, and Vltzindur.
Several names already known from the Greek and other Latin sources occur in the historical apology for Christianity by the Spaniard Paulus Orosius (fl. 414-417), as well as in the "Gallic Chronicle of 452," the "Gallic Chronicle of 511," and, especially, in the Chronicle by Marcellinus Comes (534). The last work givesfiveHunnic names : Attila, Bieda, Denzic- = Δινζίχνρ-, Huldin, and Mundo.
Two Hunnic names survived in Latin works : Laudaricus in the "Gallic Chronicle of 511" (mentioned above), and HunigasioM in the (older) "Vita Sancti Lupi" (probably compiled in the 5th с ; the saint [ca. 383479] was bishop of Troyes in France).4

In order to facilitate use and comparison, the source data is presented on p. 434 in parallel Greek and Latin columns, arranged in two parts : (1) names of members of the dynasty, given chronologically (nos. 1-25); and (2) names of the leading Hunnic statesmen and officers from ca. 448-449, arranged alphabetically (nos. 26-33).
В. Analysis of the Onomastic Material (nos. 1-33)
I. Names of Members of the Dynasty
1. Balamur, Balamber. This name occurs three times in the work of Jordanes (551); it has come down to us in five variants, which can be systematized into three categories:5
Balaber Balamber Balamur Balambyr Balamir.
The form Balaber is undoubtedly a corruption of Balamber, resulting from the omission of -m-. The forms with the second -b- (Balamber, Balambyr) seem to evolve from a dittography (b-b) ; -mir, in the variant Balamir, is certainly secondary and owes its existence to the Gothic onomastic "suffix"-mir/-mer.6 Therefore I regard Balamur as the only original Hunnic form of the name. The word recalls the appellative attested in Mongolian (SH bałamut7 ~ WMo balamud ~ balamad),8 meaning "savage, wild, reckless, venturous, dashing, crazy." Danube-Bulgarian had the suffix /mA/, with the same meaning as the Middle Turkic suffix /mAt/ 'the greatest among' : DBulg dval+ma 'horse herdsman' (originally, 'the greatest among the horseherd') = MTii qoy+mat 'shepherd' (originally, 'the greatest among the sheepherd'). This Turkic suffix consists of two elements : /mA/ and the plurative suffix

HUNNIC LANGUAGE OF THE ATTILA CLAN 4 3 5
/t/.9 In Mongolian the suffix has two variants /mAd/ and /mUd/; cf.
WMo bala+mad ~ bala + mud. As to usage, see WMo aqa+mad
'senior, elder' (originally, 'the oldest among the brothers'), from aqa
'older brother, senior, older'; yeke+med'the highest (official); the elder
men, elders or seniors, important people', from yeke 'great, big, large'.10 Since in Hunnic the suffix /r/ appears in place of the Mongolian /d/ ~
/t/ (see Emnetzur, no. 20), one may assume that Hunnic /mUr/ =
/mU/ł/r/ corresponds to the Turkic /тА/Ч-Д/ (~/тА/ + /с/) and
Mongolian /mA/i/d/ ~ /mU/ł/d/.
The now obsolete noun bala had been preserved in WMo in a
perephrastic rendition : bala bol- 'to lose one's memory from intoxica
tion, senility, or illness; to become stupid'.11 Hence the Hunnic bala+mur must have had the meaning "the greatest
among the venturous, daring" — surely a reasonable designation for a
conquerer and empire builder.
2-3. Βασίχ12 and Κουρσίχ.13 Both names have the denominal nominal suffix /siG/ which in Turkic (e.g., ОТ) has the adjectival meaning "like something."14 2. In the Hunno-Bulgarian languages /r/ within a consonantic cluster tends to disappear, e.g.: DBulg σεκτεμ ~ шехтемь 'the eighth' < *sikdrtdm; VBulg o l âti ~ r-1 асі 'he was' < * är-di > *ärti;15 Ğuv ïdà 'added number' < *artuq}6 On the other hand, there is a tendency in Turkic17 (and also partly in Hunnic; see no. 26) to avoid geminatae. Therefore, I propose the following etymology: βασιχ = *bas'ığ < *bars+siğ18 'feline-like.' The word bars 'feline' also occurs in another Hunnic name discussed here: 'Ωηβαρς Öy bars (see no. 10). 3. The root of κουρσιχ is attested in both Hunnic and Turkic: Bulg Hun *kürä (i.e., kür + ä) = Tu kür. In Hunnic the word occurs in the Danube-Bulgarian tribe name κυριγηρ кигә+gir (<*kürä+gir). Karl

Menges established for the "Altaic" kür ~ kür+ä the meaning "brave,
noble, powerful ; universal" ; cf. the Pećeneg ruler s.a. 972 : Куря Kürä
(Kür+ä).19
Because of Bang's law ("Mittelsilbenschwund")20 the form *kür+ä+ sig ( > *kurasig) became kürs'ıg. The name meant : "brave-like, noble-like, universal-like" ; cf. Attila, no. 13.

4. Ουλδης,22 Uldin23 ~ Huldin.2* As the Latin forms (already in Orosius, fl. 414-417) show, the name had /n/ and not /s/ in its Auslaut. Also see Vltzin+dur, no. 21. The root of the etymons is the verb öl-, which survives in Mo (SH) olje ~ ol-jei25 ~ WMo öl-jei26 'auspice, favourable omen, happiness, good luck'. The suffix /je/ ~ /jei/ < * /je/ goes back to */di/-I-/ge/, since every Mongolian j is originally *di.27 This concept is supported by the Mongolian (SH) form oljige = *öl-jige (< *öl-dige; > *ölje > ölje) with the meaning "front part."28 This word also appears in Mongolian (SH) as oljigetai(= öl-jige + tei) in the phrase oljigetai tergen 'wagon with a front part, i.e., protected wagon'); the Chinese equivalent is Ш wei 'ce qui sert a protéger.'29
In Hunno-Bulgarian there was also a tendency toward the develop
ment of di > ti > ći, as the tribal name Ούλτινζούρ (öl-tin + cür) and the personal name Vltzindur (öl-cin+dür; see no. 21) indicate.

HUNNIC LANGUAGE OF THE ATTILA CLAN 4 3 7
In place of the Mongolian suffix /ge/ ~ /ge+i/ the Hunnic has the suffix /n/. Hence *οί3λδην is *öl-di+n. In Mongolian the word ölje+i > ölje+i with the adjectival suffix /tu/ appears as the name of one Ilkhan, i.e., the Mongolian ruler in Iran (1304-1316): Öljeitü (= öl-je + i+tü), literally, "auspicious, happy, lucky, fortunate." The Hunnic *o!-din (= öl-di+n) apparently had a similar meaning. 5. Δονάτ-.30 The word *donát corresponds to the Turkic generic word for horse, yonat ~ yont, yund, etc.; see OT Inscr. yont, OT Brahmi yunt ~ yund, MTÜ Käsg. yond,31 Qipcaq/Golden Horde (ca. 1342-1357) yont (ёнтя літа 'in the horse year').32 Some Middle Turkic (Abu Haiyän, 1312)33 and older Ottoman texts spelled the word dissyllabically, the latter with the vowels written plene : O ^ yonat.3* The initial consonant, in Greek spelled with δ, was probably d. The initial d- is attested in Danube-Bulgarian, e.g., δυγε- {dügä-) 'to finish.'35
Horses played (and still play) a central role in the life and cult of nomads. Horse sacrifice and eating of horsemeat were common expressions of that special role. Each Hunno-Turkic language had at least two terms for "horse," one of which was used as a designation for the "horse year" in the twelve-cycle calendar.36 Concerning other Hunnic designations for "horse," see Χαράτων (no. 6) and Έλμίγγειρ-, etc. (nos. 24-25). 6. Χαράτων.37 Thefirstcomponent of this name is surely the "Altaic" word xará (= qara; phonetically with initial spirantization: q > [x-]), which had two meanings: (1) 'black' and (2) 'great; northern'.38 Spirantization in the initial position (q- > x-)—as well as in the final position (see no. 7) — seems to be a typical Hunnic phonemic feature. The second element, tön (cf. Turkmen dön), is apparently the Saka loanword in both Hunnic and Turkic: thauna > *taun > tön 'garment, clothing'.39 The compound name, qarätön, therefore, had the meaning

"black-clad; with black coat." It must have had some significance and currency among the Huns, since the name was popular among their progeny, the Old Chuvashians. Chuvash villages are usually named after their owner, and several villages still bear the name Xaratum (< xaratöri). Also, the Chuvash cult seems to include ancestral beings (kiremet) called Xoratom kiremet.40
The word qara-tôn seems to have been an elliptical designation for "horse." In Anatolian dialects and in the Ottoman literary language the word don (< tön) has still another meaning: "the coat of a horse" ("die Pferdefarbe").41
Evliya Çelebi, the great Ottoman traveler (β. 1640-1684), describes the funeral ceremony of Mürád IV (d. 9 February 1640) in the following
way: Cemi'-i iimmet-i Muhammad mätene düşüb. At-Meydânında siyäh dönli atlarda mätem eldiler,4-2 "All Muslims (lit. 'the community of Muhammad'), falling into the funeral procession, went into mourning at the At Meydân (Hippodrome) on horses having black coats." The concept of a "horse with a black coat" is expressed here by siyäh dönli at, where siyäh 'black' is an Arabic loanword used for "black par excellence" in opposition to qara which can mean "dark in general." Like siyäh dön, the compound qara-tôn (lit. 'black coat') may be used elliptically for *siyäh dónli at = *qara tönli at 'black-coated horse'. In this connection I note that the Hunnic Xara-Τδη was the successor of Donat*3 ("Horse"). Apparently the elliptical use of the word for "horse" in the title of the successor of a ruler called "Horse" was intentional, especially if we take into account Hunnic totemism. 7.

other lacking it. The majority of scholars connected this word with the Turkic bunèuq, munëuq, munguq, mingaq, bonguq, moncuq, etc.,47 and with either of its two meanings, "jewel, pearl, bead" or "flag."48 The Turkic etymon has two variants of the initial affricate of the second syllable : voiced j and unvoiced c. But careful study of Greek and Latin usages makes it clear that these two languages distinguished between the two affricates. The voiceless с was rendered in Greek by ζ and in Latin by tz, e.g., δεγγιζιχ : dintzic. On the other hand, precisely in our name Greek had di and Latin had dz : μουνδίου, μουνδίουχ; mundzuc; see also μουνδο = mundo, when the letter ι was omitted (probably erroneously) in the source in question; significantly enough, the voiced δ : d remained. Based upon these considerations, I propose to read μουνδίουχ/ mundzuc and μουνδίου ~ μοϋνδο/mundo as munguq and munğü ~ mungu.*9
Aulis J. Joki suggested that the Turkic word was a borrowing from a Chinese synonym-compositum : men (Arch Chin *mwan, GSR 183f) 'red gem' and chu (Arch Chin *tiu, GSR 128e) 'pearl'. According to him, the second component was later falsely identified with the Turkic diminutive suffix /ĆA/, and was then replaced by its Turkic synonym with the final
-K{=q,k): /ĆUK/ ~ /САК/.50 The existence of two variants of the Hunnic ruler's name, with and without -K, corroborates both Joki's etymology and the connection of Hunnic Μουνδίουχ ~ Μουνδιο with munguq ~ munğu.
The word belongs to the sphere of "Altaic" religious and royal symbolism. The two meanings given above are interconnected. As in China, so also in the Altaic steppe (as confirmed by Kushan, Old Turkic,

and Old Uighur art forms) a pearl called muncuq represented the sun and the moon. In artistic representations it was put in the mouth of a dragon. The muncuq gem was usually surrounded by an aureole of flame, and one of its special uses was as a finial on the imperial flagpole.51 This term, having so much symbolic value, is also often attested as a personal name, e.g. : Qizil Muncuq, a Mongolian commander in Afghanistan (ca. 1223);52 Munćuk Ilcikeev, a Bashkir leader (ca. 1761);53 Moncak ~ Bunëak ~ Puncuk, a Kalmuk (Torgaut) leader (first half of the seventeenth century).54 I conclude that the Hunnic name should be reconstructed as munğu ~ munguq 'jewel, flagpole' (phonetically having a spirantization of the final stop: -q = [x]). Note also the name Μουνδο- (no. 23).
8. Ociar. This name of an uncle (d. ca. 430) of Attila has been transmitted in two forms: by Socrates (ca. 380-440) as Οδπταρος,55 and by Jordanes (A.D. 551), in the "Getica," as Octar.56 The second form is undoubtedly the correct one. The form with -pt- has been rightly recognized by M. Schönfeld as Gothic,57 and the change from -ct- to -ptis one of the characteristic features of Balkan-Latin.58 There occurs in Turkic (e.g., QB, A.D. 1069)59 and Mongolian (e.g., Kalmuk)60 the word öktem with two sets of meanings: (1) "strong, brave, imperious, impetuous," and (2) "proud, boastful; pride." The etymon is the verb ökte- (oktä-), in Turkic known until now only from Chagatai (Wb) : "to encourage, put heart into (someone)," as was rightly stressed by Sir Gerard Clauson.61 In Mongolian, ökte- occurs in MA (fifteenth century): hanisqayin üsüni ökte-be = Ćag qasifj tüketi boldi

'your eyelashes became compact (solid)'.62 The déverbal nominal suffix /m/ is known both in Turkic and Mongolian.63 In the latter language, it alternates with the suffix /ri/,64 e.g., Kalmuk bo- (< boğu-) 'zuschnüren' which has two synonyms (déverbal nouns), one with the suffix /m/ and the other with the suffix /ri/: bö-m and bö-ri 'Engpass.' The Turkic correspondence of Mongolian /ri/ is /z/, e.g., bog-dz 'throat', from boğ- (Mongolian boğu-) 'to strangle, choke'.65 Here we have the following correspondences : Tii /m/ = Mo /m/ ; Tü/z/ = Mo/ri/. Typical of all Hunnic languages is their rhotacism. Therefore the corresponding Hunnic suffix must have been /r/.66 Octar/oOnzap- simply transmits the Hunnic appellative Öktär {*öktä-r),bl most probably with the meaning "strong, brave, imperious" Of special importance to our investigation of the language of Attila's Huns is the very clearly documented rhotacism in this name. 9. 'Poiyya-fRoa-. The name of Attila's second paternal uncle and predecessor (d. A. D. 433) is attested in three variants: Socrates (A.D. 439) 'Ρούγας68 ("Gallic Chronicle 511," Ruga69) = Priscus (A.D. 472) 'Ρουα-70 (= Jordanes Roas)71 = Theodoret (ca. 393-451) 'Ρώϊλας72 (Lat. variant in "Gallic Chronicle 452," Rugila).73 The 'Ρουα- variant is secondary, reflecting the sound change ουγα- > ουα.

borrowing, it probably derived from ö- (see OT ö- 'to think');75 as to the suffix /GA/, see, e.g., ОТ bil-gä 'wise' (from OT bil- 'to know').76 The Greek p[rh] at the beginning of the name was used to render the Hunnic *hr-. The latter goes back to *her, which in an unstressed position lost its vowel. The process can be reconstructed as follows : *hër ögä > * һэг ögä > hrögä; note the Greek accents: 'ρούγα-, ροΰα-.
The word her corresponds to the Old Turkic Brahmi hör ~ Runic är(er), etc., meaning "man,"77 which often occurs as the first component of names or titles, e.g., Er Böri, Er Buğa, Er Τοηα, Er Toğmis.18
In Danube Proto-Bulgarian, the second component, ögä, occurs as a tribal name with the collective suffix /in/: оугаинъ (ögä-iri).19
10. Ώηβάρσ-.80 This personal name of Attila's paternal uncle (d. 449) also has two components, distinguished in the manuscript of Priscus by having two accents : 'φη and βάρς. The second element is the "young Altaic" word bars ( < Iranian pars), the common name for a large feline, e.g., leopard.81 It often occurs as a personal name in the Bulgarian and Turkic worlds. As to the first element, Willy Bang-Kaup insisted that it should be connected with Turkic oy (< öy), a word meaning "color of a horse's coat," rather than with the Turkic ay 'moon'.82 Now there is better documentation available with regard to öy; although definitions vary, they point mainly to "dun," thereby corroborating Bang's thesis:83 öy-bärs = "a dun feline."

part stands for the "Altaic" qäm 'sorcerer, pagan priest';86 the latter word also occurs in the name Άτακάμ (=ata qäm, see no. 14). Es дат alone meant "the great priest." Apparently, Attila's father-in-law was a great priest among the Huns, as Teb Tenggri was among the Mongols of Chinggis qa'an (see SH §§244-246).
The initial q- in καμ qäm had remained a stop (plosive) ; apparently, in Hunnic spirantization was limited to the absolute initial (see no. 6) and final (see no. 7) positions of the word. The initial consonant of the second component was treated just like a medial, i.e., [-s] + [x-] > sq-.
12. Βλήδα-. For this name Priscus gives the form Βλήδας87 ( = "Chronicon paschale," 7th с : Βλίδας),88 whereas Marcellinus Comes and Jordanes, not surprisingly, use a form without the Greek suffix -ς, i.e., Bleda.89 In 1916 Willy Bang-Каир wrote: "Ein Verbalnomen auf -ta, -da kennen wir nun bisher nicht; ich glaube aber annehmen zu müssen, dass ein solches auch dem koib. Imperative auf -daq, -däk < -da
q, -dä-k zugrunde liegt."90 With the publication of Carl Brockelmann's
"Glossary" to Käsgari in 1928, the déverbal nominal suffix /DA/ was
well established, see e.g., bük- 'to bend, bow', and bük-dä ( > büg-dä)
'crooked, bent [knife], dagger' ; kiiy- 'burn' : kuy-dä 'furnace' ; caqir- 'to
call'; caqir-ta (< caqirdd) 'envoy'.91
Hence we must interpret Blida as a déverbal noun in /dA/. In the root,
bli-, it is easy to recognize the typical Hunno-Bulgarian vocalic meta
thesis bli- < *bil-.92 The verb bil- is well attested in Old Turkic and in all
Turkic languages with the meaning "to know."93 The Hunnic titlename
*bildä (> blida) was apparently synonymous with the Old Turkic

Hunnic (non-productive?) suffix /DA/ had the same meaning as the Old Turkic non-productive suffix /GA/. 13. Άττίλα/Αίίϋα.95 In 1955 I showed that 'Αττίλας/Attila should be analyzed as a composite title consisting of *es 'great, old', *t4l· 'sea, ocean', and the suffix /a/. The stressed back syllabic til ( = tlill) assimilated the front member es, so it became *as.96 The consonantic sequence s-t (aş til-) became, due to metathesis, t-s, which by assimilation
resulted in tt.91 In 1981 I was able to establish a Danube-Bulgarian
nominative-suffix /A/ from the consonantic stems.98 Recalling that
Danube-Bulgarian was a Hunnic language, I can now add to the data in
the article of 1955 the following: the Hunnic title attila is a nominative,
(in /A/) form of attil- (< *etsil < *es til) with the meaning "the oceanic,
universal [ruler];" cf. the title of the Pećeneg ruler Куря, i.e., Kür+ä,
meaning "universal" (cf. no. 3).

101 The text is ambiguous : έν οίς και παίδες Μάμα και Άτακάμ του Βασιλείου γένους. Therefore, two interpretations are found in the literature. C. D. Gordon translates it as: "Among them were the children Mama and Atakam, scions of the royal house" (The Age of Attila [Ann Arbor, 1966], p. 61), and this is also how E. A. Thompson understands the text (A History of Attila and the Huns [Oxford, 1948], p. 77: "two boys of Attila's own family named Mama and Atakam"). I follow Moravcsik, who regards Μάμα as [an apparently vulgar—O.P.] genitive from Μάμας (Byz Tur, 2: 180); see also the German translation of the passage by Ernst Doblhofer, Byzantinische Diplomaten und östliche Barbaren (Graz, 1955), p. 16: "... darunter die Söhne des Mama und Atakam, die dem Königshaus entstammten"; cf. the German translation by H. Homeyer (Attila [Berlin, 1951], p. 66). The very fact that the unhappy scions of the royal house were punished by crucifixion (οι παρειληφότες ¿σταύρωσαν, δίκας αυτούς πραττόμενοι της φυγής) may indicate that a change in religion (i.e., Christianity replacing the steppe religion) did in fact

sons. They were later crucified in Carsum, a Thracian fortress, for their fathers' transgression. 14. The first name, Atakam (= ata qärn), is readily analyzed: ata is comparable to Old Turkic (and Common Turkic) ata 'father';102 about qäm 'pagan priest', see no. 11.
15. Μάμα is apparently a popular version of the well-known Greek Christian name Μάμας (~ Μάμα?),103 and suggests that its bearer was a Christian—a circumstance which would probably have facilitated his defection to the Romans. It is remarkable that the names of both fugitives relate to religious matters : Ata-qäm may have been the former chief priest (also a proselyte?), whereas Μάμας was most probably a Christian convert.
16. Laudaríais. The "Gallic Chronicle of 511" noted under the year 451 the death of a relative (cognatus) of Attila named Laudaricus, who was killed in the battle at Lacus Mauriacus.104 The second part of this name is certainly the Gothic word -ric 'king'. Assuming that the first part, Lauda-, has been transmitted properly, M. Schönfeld suggested a Gothic etymology for the entire name: Lauda reiks.105 But it is possible, at least theoretically, that the source of the chronicle (or its compiler) "Gothicized" the name. He might have had before him
* Valda· ~ Velda ( < *Belda > Bleda), which he "corrected" into Lauda, or copied with a metathesis {Lau- for *ual-); cf. no. 18: χιρ > pt%.
17-19. Ellac, Δεγγιζίχ, and Ήρνάχ/Hernac, the names of the three oldest sons of Attila, must have had symbolic meanings.
17. The term ël > il (the etymon of Ellac)106 was the designation for
the nomadic steppe pax in the Old Turkic inscriptions of the first half of
the eighth century found in Mongolia.107 One can assume that the same
term, with the same meaning, also existed in the Hunnic language. Old Turkic has the (denominal) suffix /1AG/, going back to the

denominal verbal suffix /1A/, enlarged by the déverbal nominal ending
/G/, e.g., OT baś 'head': baś+la- 'to begin': bas + la-ğ 'beginning'.108 One can assume a comparable situation for the Hunnic : *el 'realm' : *el+lä- 'to rule' : *el+lä-g 'the rule'. Also, in this word the final с in the Latin notation must represent the final Hunnic -g.
18. Δεγγιζίχ109 has the abbreviated variant Διν[γι]ζιχ110 > DenlgiĄzic-,111 Din\gí\tzic.íí2 The word has the denominal suffix /ćiG/
(see OT /ćiG/ ~ /siG/ and Hunnic /siG/, no. 2), meaning "like." 1 1 3
Before this suffix (in Priscus's notation) the final /r/ of the stem was
dropped.114 But this /r/ was retained in the Greek notation of
Marcellinus Comes (A.D. 534) and taken over (with some change) by the
"Chronicon paschale" (ca. 628):
Marcellinus (p. 90 b, 1. 5) Δινζίχιρος (cf. his Latin form Demie; p. 90a, 1. 7); "Chronicon paschale": Δινζίριχος (the χιρ of Marcellinus became
As we can readily see, the order of syllables in Marcellinus was disturbed. I propose to treat his Greek -ζίχ in the same way as his Latin -zic-, i.e., as a suffix, and to transfer it to the end of the name (the Greek suffix -ος, must, of course, be disregarded). The result is the form *Δινιρζίχ. In Marcellinus's Latin notation the middle syllable -gi- was missing (see above), whereas to the Greek notation only γ must be added. The restored form, then, is *Δινγιρζίχ. The name should be reconstructed as derjir+ćig > derjwíg (cf. ОТ îei]3z 'sea' and OMo [hP'ags-pa] άέψί 'heaven'),115 with the meaning "ocean-like." Hence the name of the son belongs to the same semantic field as that of the father (Attila; see no. 13). The form *deyir is remarkable because of its rhotacism.

19. Attila's beloved youngest son was by his queen Krekän. It was this son that soothsayers prophesied would restore the Hunnic realm to greatness. Three variants of his name appear in the sources: Ήρνάχ,116 Ирнихъ,117 and Hernac.118 It has been suggested that the name should be connected with the Turkic ernäk ~ ernäk 'finger, thumb'.119 Some time ago I expressed another opinion: the etymon here is erän, the "irregular" plural of ër 'man', with the meaning "real man, a man squared, hero." 12° But there is actually no problem here, since ernäk ~ ernäk is a diminutive οι erän (er+än): erän + diminutive suffix /G Ак/ or /АК/: er+än+gäk > ernäk: ar+än+äk > ernäk).121 The word erän must have had two oppositional meanings: "real man, hero" and "small man." The latter meaning is found in Kasğarî's dictionary: through a denominal suffix the verb erän+ge- was created, in which the noun in /u/ erän+gä-yü had the meaning "a very small (short = Arab. qasir) man, two cubits tall." But erängäyü also had the meaning "a man with six fingers (Arab, lahu sitta asabi')"122 which probably also meant "lucky man."
The "Altaic" etymology of the Turkic word ernäk ( < erän +gäk) ~ ernäk (< ërà'n-Ydiminutive suffix /AK/), as elaborated by N. Poppe, proves that the word in fact goes back to ër 'man', since originally it had h- in the initial position (like er < här, her, etc.) : MMo heregai 'thumb' (cf. Mo ere 'man' = tu. ër id.), Manchu ferxe 'id', Orók pero(n-) 'id', etc.123 Since Jordanes writes the name of Attila's third son with an initial h(Hernac), the spiritus lenis of the Greek form should be corrected into a spiritus asper, i.e., ή into ή. The name hërmk, having the oppositional meanings "hero" and "little [i.e., lucky?] man," was especially fitting for Attila's beloved son.

names belong together, although they refer to two different persons: Emnetzur (no. 20) and Vltzindur (no. 23) were consanguinei, or brothers, of Attila's son Hernac, i.e., sons of Attila; Έλμίγγειρ- (no. 24), also called Έλμινζούρ (no. 25), was a progeny of Attila's dynasty who was active in 556. Two suffixes in the three names can easily be determined : -tzur = -ζουρ [cür] and -γειρ [gir]. The latter is known in DanubeBulgarian, where it appears as a suffix in tribal names: e.g., Κουριγηρ (=küri+gir).127 The suffix /-f-ćUr/ can be compared with the
Mongolian collective suffix /H-cUd/ ( = /си/Ц-ДІ/),128 where /d/ is the plural affix, in Hunno-Bulgarian having the correspondence /r/; see Balamu+r (no. 1).
The etymon is *elmin {elmin + car) with its variant *emnin ( < *emlin > *emnin > етпә[п] [> етпә[п]+сиг > етпә + ćiir) 'horse' (in the
twelve animal cycle; also a tribal name), known from the Danube Proto
Bulgarian.129 In Volga-Bulgarian and in Chuvash the cluster -né- is
often simplified into s, e.g., ¡J^>\ altiśi130 (< *altin£i). Therefore, the
form emnecür goes back to ^emnen+cür; cf. elmin + ćur.
The persons in question apparently also bore their clan name as a
personal name: Elmin+cür > Emnecür, or the tribal name Elmin+gir.
The nameforms were obviously interchangeable, since both the form Έλμίγγειρ (elmín+gir) and Έλμινζούρ (Elmin+cur) (occurring in A.D. 556) sseem to relate to one and the same person, as the editors (Niebuhr and Stein) of Agathias's work—where the two forms appear—have suggested.131 See also the name Δονάτ-, above, no. 5. 21. Vltzindur.132 This name contains another clan (tribal) suffix, /DUr/, parallelling the suffix /ćUr/; the latter is also attested in the name
Ούλτινζούρ (öltin + cur).133
The etymon is the Hunnic ruler's name discussed above: oldin (see
no. 4). In the notations under discussion, the change Id > It > lć had
already taken place; the parallel development is known from the Volga

Bulgarian inscriptions, e.g., *di bolci (< bolti < bol-di),i3* cJI elti > lJr\ elä 'lady'.135 The name has to be interpreted, therefore, as ölcindür.
The very fact that the known tribal clan suffixes occur only with the names Oldin and Elmin may suggest that the European Huns designated themselves by the names of two ancestors, Oldin and Elmin ( ~ Donat). This brings to mind the two ancestors of the Türküt-Turks as they are styled in the Orkhon inscriptions : Вшпәп qagan and Istämi qagan.
22. Γιέσμ-.136 According to Theophanes's chronicle (ca. 814), this person was the father of Mundo (no. 23), who in turn is characterized as a descendant of Attila. There was initially a g- in the Hunno-Bulgarian languages: e.g., the Danube-Bulgarian ruler's nameTocToyH-/Gos/MH,137 Old Bulgarian > Hungarian: gb'rény 'polecat', etc.138 Therefore, in my view the word γιέσμ- should be interpreted as having the initial Hunnic g-, that is, as *gésdm.
My thesis here is that in this word the Hunnic g- corresponds to the
Turkic-Chuvash-Mongolian k- in kes/käs ( > Ćuv kas), where, due to
regressive dissimilation in the sequence *g-s (*ges), it was replaced by the voiceless k- ( = g-s > k-s).139
Mongolian has a term kesig, for which Ferdinand D. Lessing's
dictionary gives the following meanings: [1*] "grace, favor, blessing"; [2]
"good luck or good fortune" ; [3] "turn (one's place, time, or opportunity
in a scheduled or alternating order)." 14° To this one should add [as 4]
"gift, present."141 The Yakuts borrowed this Mongolian word in the form käsi{< kesig)
with the meaning [4] "small gift, present not requiring a gift in
return,"142 and the word entered (via Yakut?) the majority of the

Tunguz languages, e.g., Negidal käsi, Udihe, Ulcha, Orok, Manchu käsi, with the meanings: [1] "favor, blessing"; [2] "luck, good luck"; [4] "gift."143 The Mongolian word is a déverbal noun in /g/ from the ProtoMongolian root *kesi-,1** which ultimately goes back to the noun kes, which (as will be shown below) also left traces in Turkic and Chuvash. The "Altaic" verb *gesi- > *kesi-(= *kes + i—)14S can be established on the basis of Ottoman (dialectal) kesimiş (= käs+i—mis) [4] 'wedding present (götürü iş)'.146 The deverbal suffix /miś/ goes back to an expansion of the déverbal noun /m/, that is, /miś/ = /m/ł/iś/.147 On this basis, we can accept—theoretically, at least—that from the verb käsi-, in addition to the derived form in /g/ there was also a derived form in /m/. While there are no traces of the deverbal form in /g/ from käsi- in the Turkic languages or in Chuvash—the Bashkir {Bask 254) kïsï{< *käsi) in kîsîllk (semantically, a response to meanings [1, 2, 4]) 'reverence' is certainly a borrowing ultimately from Mongolian kesig—Ottoman (Old Ottoman and the dialects) does have the anticipated form kesim ( = käs+i—m) with the meaning "deal; agreement (pazarlık; anlaşma)."148 Apparently, agreement between two parties was originally based on the exchange of gifts (meaning [4]). In Chuvash culture there is a ceremonial wedding soup — apparently bestowing "blessing" [1] and "good luck" [2]—called kasmak jaśki.149 The first component of the Chuvash term corresponds exactly to the Ottoman ((dialectal) kesme aşı/kesme çorbası150 (Ğuv jaska, and Ottoman aş and çorba mean "soup"). Both forms, Chuvash kasmak ( = kas+так < käsi-mäk) and Ottoman kesme ( = kes-me < kes-mek < *kesi-mäk), go back to the verb kesi-, augmented with the suffix /mAK/

Since the déverbal suffix /mAk/- like the suffix /miś/- consists of two elements: /m/ and /Ak/, the data presented here confirm further the occurrence of the déverbal suffix /m/ with the root *kesi- in both Turkic and Chuvash. The root kes, a term which—as its semantic fields indicate — derived from the religious and social life of the Eurasian steppe, has survived (if somewhat limited or transformed in semantics) in the Karakhanid language (11th century), Old Ottoman (and in Turkey in Turkish dialects), Yakut, Chuvash, and Written Mongolian. The Karakhanid meanings encompass three groups, the semantics of which are clearly influenced by the Islamic religion and Bedouin customs. So, obligatory ablution has influenced the semantic change käs — [Arab] an-nubla, that is, "a piece of dried clay ([Arab] al-madärä) with which one cleans oneself [after passing water],"152 certainly in order to be ready to receive [1] "grace, favor, blessing." Because of meanings [1] and [2] ("good luck and good fortune"), a person was käs 'quick-minded, expeditious',153 and because of [4] ("gift, present"), one was full of käsgii ( = käs+gü) 'praise';154 cf. the Bashkir data above. Two words in particular should be regarded as resulting from meaning [4]: käs 'a piece' (originally 'of a gift'?)155 and kästänt (käs+täm) 'an entertainment with drinks, other than a formal banquet, which a man gives to visitors at night'.156 In Old Ottoman (15th century), probably due to the influence of despotic rule, semantics concentrate on the agent of the meanings [1-4]. There kes is "owner; protector, helper (sahip, hamî, yardımcı),"157 and

[Istanbul, 1943], p. 30,1. 5) replaces käsgii of the Herat manuscript of QB (facs. [Istanbul, 1942], p. 18, 1. 23). Concerning the denominal suffix /GU/, see von Gabain, ATG, p. 62 (§60). There was still another word, käsgii 'piece', in the Karakhanid language, but it does not belong here, because it is a déverbal noun /GU/ from käs- 'to cut', as Kaśgan correctly explains.

then he is "decisive."158 On the other hand, the object of this active element is kes as with the meaning "dumbfounded, confused" ;159 hence, also the abstraction käs 'confusion'.160 The Ottoman and Chuvash dialects have a depreciated meaning [4] already influenced by agricultural practices: kes or kes+bik (= Cuv kas +рік) 'huge [pressed] straw and fire made of it' [as a gift?—O.P.].161 The word occurs already in the Old Ottoman texts (15th-18th centuries), in the forms kesmik ~ kesmiik ( = kesi-m -b/Uk/), with the following four meanings: "bounded huge straw (boğumlu iri saman)" ; "ears of grain, remaining apart during the harvest because of insufficient threshing (harmanda fena dövülmekten taneli kalmış başak)" ; "end of the threshing season (harman sonu)" ; "dog collar made of wood (ağaçtan yapılan köpek haltası, tok, tasma)."162
In Yakut the term was recorded in three instances : käskil (=käs+kil) [2] "good-luck, fate; commandment, rule";163 käs, as the result of [1] ("grace, favor, blessing"), means "sacred, intimate." Meaning [4] ("gift") is apparently responsible for käs, as an attribute to їпах 'cow', acquiring the meaning "calved cow," that is, "cow with a gift."164 The Mongolian and Chuvash meanings of kes ( > kas) are semantically connected with kesig's third meaning, "turn" : Written Mongolian kes 'advance abruptly, in a decisive manner; suddenly; off (with verbs meaning breaking or tearing)';165 Chuvash kas 'part, stripe, segment of time'.166
In the "Altaic" languages déverbal nouns in /g/ usually designate the results of action, whereas in Turkic and Chuvash the suffix /m/167 is used for abstracta or an agent of action, for instance, Turkic öl-üg 'dead' and öl-üm 'death', al-ig 'duty' and al-im 'debt'.168 The original meaning of the Hunnic *gesm < *gèsam (< *ges+i—m)

was probably "protector, bestower of favor, blessing, good-fortune, etc." This was certainly a suitable name for a Hunnic prince still cognizant of his family's high origin and exceptional historical role. 23. Μοΰνδο-169/ΜΜ«Λ?ο.170 This name is, in my opinion, the "abbreviated" form of the designation of Attila's father, discussed above (no. 7). While Μουνδίουχ *Mungúq was already the "Hunnicized" version of the Chinese loanword, the form Μοδνδο- (see also the variant Μουνδίο, no. 7) better reflects the original *munğu (see no. 7).
It is remarkable that one of the last known members of Attila's clan bore the name of Attila's father.

26. Άδάμις.171 When the Roman embassy came to the court of Attila (ca. 449), its members were all also invited by Krekän, the Hunnic queen, to dine at the home of Άδάμειαίΐ', who was described by Priscus as the steward in charge of the queen's affairs. Since in medieval Eurasian societies such a position was usually held by an eunuch, we can speculate that the "name" 'Αδάμ- was actually an appellative meaning "eunuch." A Turkic word already known from Kasğari's "Dictionary" (1077) occurs there without any other relatives: atan, meaning "a gelded camel."172 The word and its meaning were later borrowed into Mongolian.173 Since some Turkic languages use atan as an attribute to a word meaning "camel"—e.g., Kirg 79 atan tö (tö 'camel'), Nog 52, KKlp 59 atan tüyä (tüyä 'camel')—atan only elliptically acquired the meaning "a gelded camel": originally it was doubtlessly an adjective meaning "gelded." This interpretation is also given by Èrvand V. Sevortjan in his Turkic etymological dictionary.174

Only the manuscripts of Ibn Muhannä (14th century) have two other forms, atğân and atağan, for "a gelded camel."175 Sevortjan explains all three forms—atan, atğân, and atağan—as derivations from the hypothetical verb at- 'to geld, castrate'.176 This etymology requires some elaboration and correction. In Yakut there is a verb atta-, meaning "to put, lighten, castrate, geld."177 The word is a denominal verb in /DA/ (~ /LÄ/) from the unattested nominal stem *ad.118 The form atan had the following history, in my view. Old Turkic developed a strong dislike for geminatae, for example, dd, presuming the first d was the ending of the stem and the second d was the initial letter of the suffix. In such a case, the following happened: d-d > *dt > t, e.g., (IS12,1 E7, II E7, II N14) it1 і 'he sent' (< *id-di); (II E40, To 33, To 52 etc.) it1 эт Ί sent' (< *id-ddm); the verbal root was id1- 'to send'. Hence the form atan should be explained as a déverbal noun in /n/179 from the verb *ad+da-: *adda-n > atan.
Later (in the 14th century) atan was interpreted (due to the popular etymology) as an "Oghuz Turkic" participial form in /An/, and two Qipcaq Turkic corresponding forms were created in which the given suffix had an initial gutural /GAn/ or /AGAN/. I interpret the forms in the manuscripts of Ibn Muhannä's work in the following way. In Turkic the déverbal nominal suffixes /n/ and /m/ were often used interchangeably in the same function (verbal abstracta or adjectiva), e.g., igr-in = igr-im 'act of twisting, whirlpool'.180 Apart from the common Turkic denominal verbal suffix /dA/ ~ /1Ä/, there also existed, in the same function, the suffix /A/.

In Yakut the root final -¿developed into -/, e.g., Old Turkic ad-ад 'foot' ( = Ottoman etc. ay-aq, Yakut at-ax); see Räsänen, Lautgeschichte, pp. 162-64. 178 On the suffix /DA/, see von Gabain, ATG, p. 69 (§102), Brockelmann, OTG, pp. 21617, 223; Räsänen, Morphologie, p. 145; cf. /DA/ in Mongolian, Szabó, Szóképzés, pp. 3637 (§77). Yakut has only one denominal verbal suffix /LA/ ~ /TA/, i.e., the suffix /DA/ and LÄ/ merged; see L. N. Xaritonov, Tipy glagol'noj osnovy ν jakutskom jazyke (Moscow and Leningrad, 1954), pp. 91 -121. As an example of the merger, see Turkic yol+da-s- 'to unify' = Yakut .mollas ( < suol+lä-s-); also see Piekarski, vol. 3, col. 2344. 179 On the déverbal suffix /n/, see Räsänen, Morphologie, p. 138. 180 Brockelmann, OTG, p. 129 (igri-n), p. 124 (igri-m), from egir- 'to surround, encircle, twist, spin' (Clauson, EDT, p. 113).

From these data I conclude that in both Turkic and Hunnic, there was a verb with the meaning "to castrate, geld" from the nominal base *ad. In Turkic the denominal verbal suffix /dA/ and the déverbal nominal suffix /n/ were used to convey the meaning "castrated; gelded" (*ad+ da-n > atari).
Hunnic used, for the same purpose, the denominal verbal suffix /A/ and the déverbal nominal suffix /m/. The result was *ad+a-m = adam. The Hunnic dignitary in charge of the queen's household was, indeed, a eunuch, as his "name" — i.e., official title—corroborates. His position could be compared to that of the qizlar ağasi in the Ottoman empire. Establishment of the Hunnic word adam with the medial -d- is of great significance, because this illustrates one of the basic distinctive features in Turkic and Altaic language classifications. It is apparent that the change -d- > -r- was late; hence it was not Hunnic, but Bulgarian (first attested in the 9th century). See also no. 28, Έδέκων.
27. Βέριχος.181 He was an important logas, or minister (ca. 449), of Attila who was also of high Hunnic origin. Since the Hunnic final -q and -k had a tendency toward spirantization (see nos. 6, 7), the name should be interpreted phonologically as *bérik. This same form is suggested by È. V. Sevortjan as the original for the very popular Turkic adjective and name berk 'fine, stable, solid, strong'.182 The form berik is also attested in the glossary of Ibn Muhannä (14th century)183 and in the legend of Oghuz Qagan (13th century).184 The word was borrowed into Mongolian, where it became berke,185 since in the final position of a stem Mongolian allows no voiceless stops. The Mongolian loanword (which, incidentally, entered into Chuvash as parka < berke)186 was also used as a personal name, e.g., Berke, the second khan of the Golden Horde (1257-1266), who converted to Islam. The appellation berik 'strong' is certainly a reasonable one for a responsible Hunnic leader.

28. Έδέκων.187 This Hun was one of "Attila's most powerful lieutenants" and served as ambassador to the Roman emperor in 449. The second part of his name, -κων, derives from the déverbal noun /GUN/ (like -κων of Ζερ-κων) ; the initial -k of this suffix indicates that originally the stem ended in /r/ which is also responsible for the change of *g- into k- (as in ζερ-κων): /r-g/ > /r-k/ ~ /k/.188 In this way we arrive at the verbal root edär-, which is well known in
Turkic from the eighth century on, usually with -d- already developed
into -y- ( > -g-, etc.). The verb's basic meaning was "to pursue, to
follow."189 Several Turkic languages use derivational forms of this verb. These are
grouped below according to their suffixes : (a) /GUći/: NUig 76 ägäs-küci190 'adherent';
(b) /GUc/: Kzk 143, KKlp 195 yer-gïsi9i 'dependent, complaisant, unsteady';
(c) /iGći/: Ткт 777 eyar-iği 'follower'; Tat 184 iyar-iiwéï 'fol
lower, devotee', iyär-üwcilik 'imitation'; Bask 678 eyar-ïwsï 'follower, imitator';
(d) /iGćAn/: Tat 184 iyä'r-üwcän 'imitative', iyär-üwöänlik 'imita
tion' ; (e) ćArj/ ~ /cin/: Tkm 111 eyär-gäy 'fellow-traveler'; Bask 679
ey'àr-sïn 'adherent, follower'; Tat 184 iyär-cin 'fellowtraveler, follower, confederate';
(f) /inći/ : Tuv 576 edär-inei 'fellow traveler' ; (g) /mA/ : Tat 184 iyär-mä 'retinue' ; NUig 76 ägäs-mä 'following'.
Interestingly enough, Chuvash has the same suffix /GUn/ ( < -GU + n) as Hunnic does; but there the original stem was replaced by a Turkic one
of the Kazakh type : jer-kän (/kân/ < /GUn/) 'lover'.192

Our conclusion is that the Hunnic "name" was actually an appellative derived from the déverbal noun *edakiin ( < *edär-küri). The meaning of the word was very probably "follower, retainer."
29. Ζέρκων.193 The bearer of this name—or, better, title—was not a member of the dynasty of Attila, but a Moorish dwarf and buffoon of the king Blida. From Priscus's stories it is clear that Ζέρκων was not his real name, but a sobriquet given to the clown by his capricious master. The final /n/ is the "plural of quantity," comparable to Mongolian (e.g., Urdus) /n/ in tribal names.194 Without the suffix /n/ the word occurs in a Danube-Bulgarian name list in Latin script from 869-870 as zerco.195 It has long been recognized as an abbreviated variant of the DanubeBulgarian title ήτζιργου icirgii 'the inner [residence] official', i.e.,196 ić+i-r-gii > éérkü (> ¿érkü+ri):
In this way, Blida jokingly named his buffoon éérkün, or "the inner [residence] official."
30. Ήσλα.197 This Hun was an experienced diplomat who served first Ruga (Hrögä) and later Attila. The first element of his name, or title, is es 'great, old' (see nos. 11, 13); the vowel e is rendered here by η ; in the title es qam the same word was written with ε. +λα is the denominal suffix /1A/;198 in Old Chuvash another suffix /1Ä/ < /HG/, having a similar meaning, was added to the same stem: as-lä < *äs+lig 'old, great'.199 The Hunnic appellation ésla apparently meant "the great, old (gentleman)"; this was probably the way the Huns referred to their elder statesmen.

attractive Turkic etymology for it. According to him, the lady's name
was •Αρεκαν, i.e., *ariqan < *ariğ qan 'the pure princess'.202 However, his pretty proposition can no longer be defended, since κ ρε- (or, for that matter, ηρε-)203 cannot possibly stand for the Turkic ariğ 'pure'. In 1955 Pavel Poucha made another suggestion : he connected the Hunnic name with the Mongolian appellation for "wife," gergei, without giving any elaboration.204 I came to the same conclusion independently, and my reasons (presented here in print for the first time) are as follows. In Mongolian there exist two variants of the word in question : SH gergai205 and WMo gergen.206 Regarding the form with the final +n Nicholas Poppe writes: "In Written Mongolian the form gergen 'wife' from gergei id. is still used. The form gergen was originally a plural, but it has become a singular semantically, in the same manner as Khalkha еххэпэг 'woman' morphologically is a plural form of еххэ 'mother'."207 The Hunnic form also has a final /n/: κρέκαν = krekän like WMo gergen. The Turkic word for "wife," already existing in the Karakhanid language, was eblig, that is, "possessing a house" = "living at home."208 Eb is the word for "house," whereas /lig/ is the suffix of the possessor. The Mongolian word for house, which is the root ger, is augmented by the "class-suffix" /GA/, to which at an early time was added either the singulative suffix /i/ or the collective suffix /n/, in the sense described in my "Stammesnamen."209 The connection between the semantic fields "house," "family," and "wife" can readily be illustrated in the Yakut language : The word kärgän (the root kär is comparable to the Mongolian ger; +gän is also comparable to the Mongolian suffixes /GAI+fn/) means "family; house; all persons living in one house; member of a family; member of household."210 Accordingly, kärgännä- ( = kärgän + /LA/)

has the meaning "to marry," and kärgännäx (kärgän + /LAG/) that of "married."211 The Hunno-Bulgarian vocalic metathesis mentioned above (no. 12) is responsible for the change of *ker into kre-. The k- in the initial position of the suffix /GAN/ is the result of Hunno-Turkic (e.g., Chuvash, Old Turkic) devoicing after r, I, n. Apparently *kerkän developed from the older *kergän. It is impossible to say whether the older Hunnic also had g- in the initial position of the word (like Mongolian ger + ) . 2 1 2 The "name" of this primary wife of Attila, as noted in our sources, was not a personal name at all, but rather the Hunnic appellative krekän meaning "wife," since she was the Hunnic ruler's consort or "wife par excellence."
32. Όνηγήσιος213/#Μη/£αΑίΜ,ϊ.214 The most powerful of Attila's logades, or ministers, was Ονηγησι-/Hunigasi- (-osf-us are foreign suffixes), "who held power second only to Attila."
The Mongolian word ünen 'truth'215 (today also the title of Mongolia's official newspaper, namesake and imitator of the Russian Pravda) must be regarded as a déverbal noun from the unattested root *iine-, which was of Mongolo-Turkic origin. That conclusion is based on the fact that in Mongolian the suffixes added to this reconstructed root *iine-, are either of Mongolian or of Turkic origin : (a) Turkic /msi/:216 iine-msi- 'to believe, or accept as true, trust';217 (b) Turkic /ncï/:218 üne-néi 'honest, faithful, truthful, loyal';219 (c) Mo /GAr/:220 iine-ker 'truly, really, indeed; very much, extremely'.221 The déverbal suffix /mlA/ can be either of Turkic or Mongolian origin, since it consists of the déverbal noun /m/, and the very productive

denominal verbal suffix /1A/. But the form with the root üne- occurs only in Mongolian : iinemle- 'to certify, testify, attest'.222 According to Käsgari (ca. 1077) there was a Turkic Oghuz déverbal noun in /Äsi/, which corresponded to the Karakhanid suffix /Gu/, e.g., bar-äsi yer = bar-ğu yer 'a place of going'.223
Judging by the available historical data, the forms /Äsi/ ~ /Äs/ and /GÄs/ must originally have been two variants of the suffix of nomen futuri (necessitatis), e.g., Käsgari biâ-ğas 'a contract, or covenant'.224 In Hunnic the word apparently had a final -i, like the Oghuz form /Äs+i/, i.e., its form was */GÄsi/. The name or epithet of the Hunnic leader was, therefore, *üne-gäsi, meaning "honest, faithful, truthful, loyal."
33. Σκόττας.225 According to Priscus, this person was a prominent noble of Hunnic origin and brother of Όνηγήσιος. In our source he is depicted as a hotspur and a blusterer. One of the typical features of the Hunno-Bulgarian linguistic group is a cluster in the word initial position. Such clusters developed—as mentioned above—due to vocalic metathesis, e.g., blidä < *bildä (see no. 12), krekän < *kerkän. (see no. 31). In the same way ska- in σκοττα
sköttä- developed from the original *sökit-tä. The etymon sök- means "to tear apart, pull down, break through (an
obstacle)"; sök-it- is formally the causative, attested as hapax in Old
Turkic;226 sök-it- > *sokat-; the vocalic metathesis in the stem resulted
in sköt-.
The root sök- had special importance in Turkic military parlance.
According to Käsgari (1074), sökmän (/mÄn/ is a deverbal nominal
suffix) was "a military title, meaning 'he who breaks the battle line (Arab
käsir şaffal-harby."221
In *sökattä (> sköttä) there is the déverbal suffix /DA/, which was
also recognized in the name blida (< *bil-da) (see no. 12).
One can assume that skottä (< *sökattä = *sök-it-), apparently
having the same meaning as verbum simplex, was used, like sökmän, as a
title or nickname meaning "hotspur."

II. Phonology
1. Consonantism in General
Seventeen consonantic phonemes are attested : qs b m 1 h
There was, at the very least, a clear distinction between the front and back к and q, and the latter (q) was pronounced, in absolute initial and final positions, like a spirant x; see the Greek notations: χαράτων [xaratön] and μουνδίουχ- [тшзих] for qarätön and mungúq, and εσκάμ esqäm. Since qäm was not in absolute initial position, its q- was not spirantized. A tendency towards spirantization can also be observed with the final -ğ and possibly -k and -g : ßepix-/berik/and βασίχ /basiğ/ and κουρσίχ /kürsíg/. One can regard the presence of the initial h- as a specific feature of Hunnic consonantism : hernac/hernäk/, ροΰγα /hrögä/. The compound attíla ( < *es + tila), with initial a from original *e but with middle front /, indicates that there was a consonantic palatal harmony in Hunnic, comparable to that in Old Turkic. Therefore I interpret tila as having the back consonantic phonemes t and /. Unfortunately, the limited material does not support any far-reaching conclusions. As to their morphonemic occurrences, the Hunnic consonantic phonemes can be grouped according to their positions within the root (stem) and the suffixes. Here, it must be stressed, our data is very incomplete, but even so it can help us understand the operational structures : Stems (first syllable) Suffixes Initial position simple consonants kq t с s ć s

3. Vocalism
(a) First syllable
Seven vocalic phonemes are certainly attested : three back (а, о, и), three front (e, ö, ii), and the neutral (although phonetically front) i. The same system of vocalism is attested in Old Turkic. I may add that the phonemically neutral /i/ is also typical for Old Chuvash and Mongolian.



HUNNIC LANGUAGE OF THE ATTILA CLAN 4 6 5
The quantity was phonemic, since of the total of seven vowels, four long vowels are reconstructable from the limited data available to u s . 2 2 8 The vocalic system can be presented graphically as follows : Simple Vowels Long Vowels
і ü229 u e ö ë öö
(b) Second or Succeeding Syllable
In the suffixes appear the two archphonemes A (its realization was a or a), U (=м or ii) and the neutral phoneme /, which in closed syllables has a tendency to become a schwa (a) or to disappear (but under stress develops to e) : I ( = 1/е/ә) U A, A
The attested realization of the suffixed vocalism is as follows :
/i/ : +Ә-, +ér-{< * + i-r-); +ciG, +síG, -Din (> -tin), +Gir, /A/ : +A, +ÁK, +An; -DA, -GА, Л-GAn, +IA, +IA-, +IAG, /Ä/ : -GÄsi, /U/ : +cVr, +DUr, -GUn, ^mUr.
Here, as in Old Turkic, the vocalic phonemes appear singly, rather than in clusters. There is a clear palatal harmony : a, o, u; q, ğ versus e, ö, ii; к, g, e.g., mungúq and hernäk.
But no labial harmony or labial attraction can be detected, e.g., donat, ögä, kürsíg.
228 Instead of assuming that writers in the first half of the fifth century had already disregarded the vocalic quantity, I believe that it was not accidental that Olympiodorus in A.D. 425 writes Χαρα-των by means of the omega (των) — this for a word which had a vocalic length (tön). The same principle applies to the very exact notations of Priscus, who writes 'Ωη-βαρσ- ( = öy), Ήρναχ ( = her-), 'ΡοΟα ( = hr-ö[g]ä), etc.
2 2 9 The only pair of Hunnic phonemes that the Greek and Latin autors had difficulty distinguishing clearly and rendering systematically were the labial front vowels ö and ii: öü Greek o/Latin o: octar, σκοττα;
Greek ου-: οΰπταρ; Greek ου: κουρσιχ; Greek ou-/Latin һу- ~ u- ~ γ-: ουλδην/ Greek o-/Latin hu-: ονηγησι/hunigasi. huldin, uldin, vltzinGreek ou-/Latin o: ρουγα/roas.

On the other hand, the labiality of the suffix archphoneme is kept, regardless of the non-round stem, e.g., Ьаіатмг, elmmćwr, öltmcür,
сегкйп.

3. Síress
My premise here is that the Middle Greek accentuation of foreign names can be treated seriously. Based on this hypothesis, one arrives at the following conclusions : (a) Two-syllable words that were not clear etymologically to the speakers had the stress on the ultima: adám, donát, qará, mungúq (but, interestingly enough, munğu ~ munğü). (b) Two-syllable words that were transparent, rightly or not, to the speaker had the stress on the penúltima (stem) : ögä ( < ö-), öldin ( < öl-), bérik, oktär, gésam (or gesmi), múngu (< Chinese loanword).
(c) Suffixes were divided into two groups: (1) stressed and (2) nonstressed. (d) Stressed suffixes: (1) denominal nominal: /ÁK/: hernäk; /ćiG/:
denirćig; /síG/ : bas'ığ, kürs'ıg; /ćUr/ : elminćur; (2) denominal verbal : /Á/ :
adám; (3) deverbal nominal: /GÄsi/: ünegäsi;.
(e) Non-stressed suffixes: (1) denominal nominal: /ΙΑ/: ésla, /Gir/:
elm'mgir; /GAn/: krékân; (2) deverbal nominal: /DA/: bl'idä, skottä; /Din/: oldin; /GUn/: cérkün, edékün.
(f) Composite nouns had the stress placed either on each component, e.g., 5y bars, or on their second component; if the latter had two syllables, stress was placed on the penúltima: es qam, ata qam; һәг-ögä, attíla.
The only exception to this rule was qarâ tön, which had the stress on the ultima of the first component. Apparently qará tön was not yet considered to be a true composite noun.

D. Concluding Remarks
Our detailed analysis of the Hunnic onomastic material, together with examination of it from the point of view of Altaistic linguistics, has yielded very positive results indeed. It has proved that it is possible to determine the character of the Hunnic language.230 It was not a Turkic language, but one between Turkic and Mongolian, probably closer to the former than the latter. The language had strong ties to Old Bulgarian and to modern Chuvash, but also had some important connections, especially lexical and morphological, to Ottoman and Yakut. Hunnic vocalism, consisting of seven vowels with quantitative opposition (long: short) but with the singular high-front vowel /, is comparable to Old Turkic and Old Mongolian vocalism. However, it seems not to have included diphthongs. Hunnic had a palatal harmony (probably syllabic), but neither labial harmony nor labial attraction. As to consonantism, its initial position in Hunnic was in agreement with Old (and Middle) Mongolian rather than with Old Turkic : h-, as well as the voiced stops d- and g-, were allowed to occur. But like ProtoBulgarian, Hunnic possessed clusters in the initial position. The medial -d- in the stem is of great significance, since it is different from the ProtoBulgarian and Chuvash. Also, Hunnic shared rhotacism with Mongolian, Old Bulgarian, and Chuvash. It is highly probable, however, that Hunnic had a palatal correlation of its consonantism, of the Old Turkic type.
When I decided to experiment with the thirty-three Hunnic names in an effort to determine their linguistic relationship, I did not have any preconceptions about what the results would be, that is, whether the
230 The last contribution to deal with the language of the Huns was Gerhard Doerfer's article, "Zur Sprache der Hunnen," published in CAJ 17, no. 1 (1973): 1-50. Alas, it is a very disappointing and unproductive study. Contrary to the addage he himself there notes, "zuviel Skepsis ist unkritisch" (p. 32), the author overindulges his scepticism, and, naturally enough, arrives at a completely negative conclusion. Instead of examining the Hunnic onomastic material in a detailed structural analysis, based on knowledge of Old Bulgarian, Chuvash, Yakut, Old Turkic, and Old Ottoman material, Professor Doerfer wasted the greater part of his study on magisterial theorizing and on pun-etymologies.



HUNNIC LANGUAGE OF THE ATTILA CLAN 471
reconstructed language would prove to be Altaic, Iranian, Ugric, or anything else. I simply wanted to ascertain definitely whether or not the existing onomastic material was adequate for such a quest, i.e., whether it would show the required structural uniformity. I did not treat each onomastic item in isolation, thereby creating "phonemic laws" ad hoc, but rather constantly checked to see whether or not any clear and convincing structural pattern of morphonemics for the entire body of data would emerge. Also, I carefully avoided changing a single letter in my sources so as to benefit my "ingenious" reconstructions and constructs.
The results have been more than satisfying. Not only did a clear structural pattern in the Hunnic language emerge, but also it was possible to reconstruct the language's morphonemic system almost in its entirety, and even to establish its accentuation patterns. The deciphering of meanings of the reconstructed words (which were not provided with translations) and forms (derivations) found corroboration in the realia of Hunnic history and culture. This was especially true with reference to the "names," or, better still, the designations of offices/professions, epithets, and nicknames of the Hunnic leaders from a specific time, A.D. 448-449. I hope that the experiment described and reproduced here will be judged successful by scholarship and that the mystery of the character of the Hunnic language will be regarded as solved.
