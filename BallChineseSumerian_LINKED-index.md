PREFACE
A LENGTHY preface would hardly go well with a slender book.
And it is a pertinent question to ask why an author, of whatever sort,
should labour to say over again in brief all that he has already said at
length. The slenderness of the present volume is happily not due to
an early consumption of the available material. The introductory
chapter, with its analyses of various Sumerian characters, mostly
determined years ago, although here published for the first time, might
have been considerably prolonged; especially if Professor Barton's
valuable work on the Origin and Development of Babylonian Writing
had come to hand before this book was sent to press (September 1912).
The fifty pages or so of philological discussion which precede the
detailed comparison of vocabularies, might easily have been extended
to a hundred or more, had the writer chosen to publish everything
lying at his disposal in the miscellaneous accumulations of years. As
it is, some may think that he has given more than sufficient evidence
of the imperfection of his own equipment for dealing with the difficult
problems of speech and writing which the book makes some attempt to
solve ; and he will not be altogether dissatisfied with results, if an exam
ination of his work should induce a few younger minds, starting with
the advantages of a better education and higher natural endowments,
to follow in a path in which it is perhaps not entirely presumptuous on
his part to hope to be regarded hereafter as a humble pioneer.
The writer's thanks are due to the Staff of the Clarendon Press
for the care and intelligence exhibited in the production of a work
involving many material difficulties. He is especially sensible of
obligation to the draughtsman whose calligraphy is well displayed in
the Plates of Characters.

INTRODUCTION
THE NATURE OF SUMERIAN WRITING AS ILLUSTRATED
BY THE ANALYSIS OF CERTAIN CHARACTERS
It has long been recognized by those most competent to judge, that Sumerian
writing (that is, the primitive script of Babylonia, from which in the course of time
were developed all the varieties of cuneiform) was originally of a pictorial or hiero
glyphic nature. It is true that the primary pictograms or picture-characters of the
system had already disappeared at the remote period of the fourth millennium b. c,
to which the earliest extant monuments of the Sumerian language apparently belong
but many of the more or less conventional linear forms which had by that time
already usurped the place of the original hieroglyphs, are still quite obviously rude
outlines of physical objects, presenting the remains of picture-characters as altered
and simplified during centuries of use, in accordance with the convenience or caprice
of the scribes and the practical exigencies of the instruments and materials of writing.
As in Chinese one type of ku win, or old characters, displays every indication of the
brush and pigment, while another gives equally clear evidence of the use of the
graver of burin on hard substances such as stone, bronze, or bone ; so in Sumerian
the stiff angular outlines of the oldest forms of the written character suggest the
practical difficulties of the engraver in hard stone when attempting to portray the
rounder and more flexible outlines of nature.
The fact that the objects represented by many of the characters of linear
Sumerian have not yet been identified, should not be allowed to make us sceptical
of the pictorial origin of this most ancient system of writing. The evidence of those
characters which can certainly be explained as copies of things visible is not invali
dated by our present ignorance of the precise intention of the obscure remainder. It
is enough for us that the symbols for the common objects of the natural world, such
as sun, moon and stars, mountains, water, trees, reeds, man and his bodily organs and
members, birds, fishes and other animals (in whole or in part), as well as artificial
products of human activity such as houses, nets, knives, bows, vessels and implements
of various kinds, are all characters which still exhibit more or less unmistakable
vestiges of their pictorial or pictographic origin.
These primary signs were soon made to include other things, by natural trans
ference to things in any way similar, and by the association of ideas. Take the



viii INTRODUCTION
character for house, Dangin 423. It looks like the symbol for netting, network, net,
D. 422, with an added line at the bottom of the figure.
house according to Br. 3072) and
SA, SAD, is net (also
E(N), E, is house. Now, what possible resem
blance of form or relation of ideas is traceable between a net and a house ? The
Net-symbol, in what may be called its proper sense, is easily intelligible as a rough
picture of the object it represents—a thing of cross-threads or strands knotted or
twined together. But the bare linear figure might equally well stand for any other
fabric consisting of materials crossing each other or plaited or interwoven together,
e.g. a wickerwork screen or a wall of open reed matting, such as is still used in
constructing the temporary dwellings of Bedawis ; and the pictogram of such a reed
wall might become the chosen symbol of a house with walls of this kind {cf. NE. xi.
20 ff. quoted below). Hence also the same character, D. 423, could be used for
LIL, the wind ; since it might for that purpose be taken to represent a piece of
matting used as a sail. This possibility is confirmed by the fact that the wind (t'w =
TU !) is symbolized by I^ the outline of a full sail, in the old Egyptian hiero
glyphic script. And my view of the primary significance of the house ideogram,
expressed in notes made years ago, seems to find support in the following statements
of Prof Elie R6clus, which I came upon for the first time quite recently : ' One sees
in the Egyptian temples that their columns were imitations of Nile reeds tied in
a bundle, that their walls were an imitation of plaited mats! ' It is a theory amongst
architects . . . that the first buildings of men, inhabitants of caves, holes, or trees,
were not dwellings for themselves, but simple hearth-places protected by reed zvalls
and some thatching against wind and rain. They believe that on this model of
a prytaneum or abode of the firegod, the abode of his priest, and then of the kings
and chiefs of noble families, were successively erected.' Vid. Encycl. Brit.^ viii. 617.
It would appear, then, that this primitive pictogram for house (and wind), which,
so far as I know, has not hitherto been explained, really figures a reed wall, when it
denotes a house, and a reed or mat sail (Ch. ||)g li), when it denotes the wind.^
LIL is also ' the earth or land', as the realm of the god Bel, EN-LIL, ' the Lord
of Earth'. The earth is thus regarded as a great house or dwelling-place {vid.
Creation-Tab. V, ad fin). Both word and character may survive in the Chinese J|^
li, 'a place of residence' (kien-shou, ku y€), which has been altered to suggest field -\
' Cf. the well-known passage of the Nimrod Epic
AmdtsunH uianna \ ana kikMti 'Their talk he told to the reed-hut:
Kikkil kikkts
I igar igar " Reed-hut ! reed-hut I wall ! wall
Kikkiia hviima \ igaru hissas Reed-hut hearken, and wall perpend ! "
{NE. xi. 20 ff.)
Prof. Giles quotes a Chinese saying : Mei-yiu puh-t'ou-feng-tih li-pa, ' There is no wattle-fence which
will not let the wind through '= Walls have ears (G. 6908).



INTRODUCTION ix
earth. (See especially the second of the three forms of this character, cited from
an old collection, ap. Luh-shu T'ung, s. v. cit)
The linear form of the Sumerian character ^^^ BAR, ' spread out ', ' extended ',
of a net and other things (Br. 5528 ff. ; 3i26f.), is evidently a modification of the
pictogram for net (see D. 426; cf. D. 422); and the character tJUt KUSH, U,
' grass ', ' herbage ', ' vegetation ', has at least been modified in the same direction, so
as to suggest a network of growth, matted and tangled together (see Sign-list, No. 84).
But the linear form of t^J^f UG (GUG), 'the land or country', 'the people', which in
the oldest known form looks almost exactly like spread out -V great (BAR + NUN)
an ideogram appropriate enough to the meaning, since the land lies spread out in
great stretches all around us,—may rather perhaps have sprung from the House
character discussed above. In that case, the idea of country or nation would be
expressed by great house (E + NUN) —an equally suitable combination, since the
nation is regarded as one great family dwelling together (see D. 421=423+43 >
426 + 43). The other linear symbol, which so closely resembles this last that it was
merged in the same cuneiform character, EiJ^f read KA-NAM, KA-LAM, 'the land',
' country ', may perhaps be resolved into great (or many 7) canal(i) (see Amiaud and
Mdchineau, 119; 120; cf. 129; 0.420=109 + 43); a highly significant combination,
inasmuch as Babylonia was a network of canals for irrigation, the vestiges of which
are still visible all over the country.
We have no reason to suppose that the primitive Sumerian system of writing
was the invention of a single mind or of a single generation. It probably grew up
gradually from small beginnings, being extended and enlarged from time to time by
the addition of new or modified characters and combinations, the work of the scribes
or literati, whose art and mystery it constituted. Some of the symbols with which
we have been dealing agree very well with the theory of a Babylonian origin.
Shumer (Shinar) or southern Babylonia is a land of rivers and marshes, where reeds
and rushes flourish abundantly. Hence the walls and sails of reed matting, and
the corresponding ideogram for house and wind. And, as we have seen, the con
ception of the country as a place of many canals was well suited to the local
conditions. Other ideograms for house and country, however, would seem to suggest
a different locality as their place of origin. Thus we have ^, linear •, U (GU ; from
GUR?), 'a house' ; strictly, a hole or pit in the ground, as the old hnear character
itself suggests, as does also the use of it for BUR ( = GUR), 'pit', 'cave' (and even
' earth ', ' ground '). Hence it would appear that subterranean dwellings, and caves,
natural, or scooped out by human agency in the softer rocks and cliffs, may have
served as ' houses ' to the inventors of the Sumerian script. At all events, this Hole
symbol for house enables us to understand the character V". which does duty for the
two distinct ideas of mountain and country. In the earliest writing it is a threefold
repetition of the Pit- (or Cave-)symbol, thus : ^^ (D. 479). In the sense of country.



X INTRODUCTION
three houses (strictly, holes or caves) might naturally stand for the multitude of
dwellings which make up the whole community (vid. Lex. s. v. ESH, 'many', 'three',
sign of plur.) ; and the use of the same remarkable symbol for the apparently
altogether unconnected idea of mountains may possibly indicate that, in the original
home of the inventors of Sumerian writing, the hills and cliffs were, as in modern
China, full of holes and caves in which the people lived. At the risk of some
repetition, I may allow myself to quote here something to the same effect which
I wrote a good many years ago : ' As caves are among the earliest dwellings, and
are usually found in hilly regions, three caves might well symbolize a dwelling-place
or inhabited country, and at the same time, by association of ideas, a hill, mountain,
or mountainous region. Cave-dwellings are still quite common in parts of China, e.g.
L,t^- lU,s*.-v '^^ Shan-tung ; and holes or pits in the ground, such as Xenophon met with in his
march through Asia Minor, are used for the same purpose. The character suggests
that the Sumerian writing was not originally invented in Babylonia, which is not
a hilly country, but in some mountainous region of the further East.' (Gen. xi. 2
may possibly preserve a trace of a tradition of primaeval immigration into Shumer
Shinar ' from the East '.)
^
In D. 287 we have another linear form of V', which looks more like an outline
of mountain peaks, although in use it coincides entirely with D. 479, the symbol we
have been discussing. It is figured in our Sign-list as No. 102 and, as will be seen,
agrees very well with the Chinese parallels or derivatives there given. It is possible,
as Dangin has suggested, that it was derived from the Three-hole symbol through the
influence of writing on clay, which from the first tended to give a wedgelike form to
the characters and their components. (See D. 287; 479; 486.) In Chinese writing,
vestiges of the primitive three holes or caves may perhaps be recognized in the two
(modified) holes of the ku win form of ^ hiit, gut ( = gur), 'a cave', 'a hole in the
earth or side of a hill—used as a dwelling', R. 116, the third or lower hole being
omitted; and in the three circles of the ku win of ^ fou, vu, pu, bu [Amoy hu = ku,
gu), bu-t, gu-t, hill [see Ski, II. i. VI. 3), R. 170.
It seems possible, when we consider the truly primitive nature of the reed-wall
ideogram for house discussed above, that another House-character, viz. tt^J, D. 345,
may primarily have figured a pit-dwelling, with its narrow shaft above leading to the
wider living-room below. {See Sign-list, No. 98 b ; also No. 99 = D. 346.) It is used
for AB, 'the Sea' {Tdmtu); cf. also ZU-AB, later AB-ZU, 'the Deep'. The
archaic form of D. 345, given by Barton, JAOS. xxiii. 19, without the cross-line, and

with the lower sides rounded, seems to confirm this view of its significance as an
underground abode. Cf. also Perrot and Chipiez, Art in Chaldaea, i. 184: 'The
houses of the Armenian peasantry are sunk into the ground,' &c. The cross-line of
Dangin's figure can hardly represent a division into upper and lower stories, since
Babylonian and Assyrian houses were usually one-storied edifices (Perrot and Chipiez,
AC. i. 188 f.). The same remark applies to the similar character, D. 403; where,
however, it is conceivable that the cross-line indicates division into an outer and
inner court or chamber.
Since mountain ranges constitute the eastern boundary of Babylonia, ' the East
was naturally there designated by the Mountain-symbol and word (V" KUR, Sadu).
And since the horse was not indigenous in the country, it has been usual to interpret
the group rTl^^ <*' E^U' which denotes the horse (Br. 4994 : stsil) as meaning ' Ass
of the East '. But although the horse may well have been originally imported into
Babylonia from the East, and although the ass was probably in use there long before,
there is no apparent reason why the name of the horse should not have been
introduced along with the animal itself; and the analogy of the similar group ?VTw^
"V Kf^y, read simply GAM-MAL, 'camel', seems to favour the idea that KUR
(GUR) was a (the ?) Sumerian term for 'horse' (cf. HWB. p. 308 s.v. siptu). The
Ass-symbol, in fact, appears to have included the horse (Br. 4986), and, in that case,
may have been read KUR as well as AN-SHU {see Lex. s.v. KUR, horse). What,
however, is particularly interesting for our purpose is the fact that the Ass- (and
Horse-) symbol in question is used as a Determinative Prefix (Classifier or ' Radical ')
in the groups denoting the camel and the mule as well as the horse ; a fact which
finds a close parallel in the Chinese use of the Horse-Radical in the characters for the
ass, the mule, and the camel.
Another no less striking instance of the same kind of agreement between the
two scripts is the use of the Dog-symbol in certain characters denoting beasts of prey,
such as the lion, the leopard or panther, and the wolf (Br. 11271 ; 11 274; 11276;
1 1290; cf. 1983). In both, for instance, the lion is 'The Great Dog' or 'The
Master Dog' {see Lex. s. v. UR, « value of the Dog-symbol). It hardly seems probable
that these peculiar coincidences of usage arose independently in the two languages
and systems of writing.
It may be added that the linear Sumerian character ^:; (D. 226) denotes not
only the ass (and horse), but also the foot (^epii) of man and beast and, accordingly, is
represented in cuneiform by the two signs <^ GIR, ' foot', and ^^1^ ' ass ' (' horse ').
Now this curious linear symbol, which somewhat resembles the linear forms of ^J
(p. 18 f. ; Sign-list, No. 79 ; D. 304) set up on end and turned round, and which also
presents some degree of likeness to the symbols which figure the two legs with
various adjuncts (D. 310-315), may conceivably have originated in an attempt to
b2



xii INTRODUCTION
depict the human foot with projecting heel. The four cross-lines were, in that case,
possibly added to suggest a ' four-foot ' or quadruped. As in analogous instances,
the simple form without these lines (D. 224) was used when a Phonetic was added
to indicate the species, such as the E-LIM or the LU-LIM, the 'ram' or 'stag'
(buck i*) : see D. 228 ; 229.
It will doubtless, however, have occurred to the reader that all the animals in
whose names this character appears, are hoofed or hard-footed ; so that the symbol, in
this application, might indicate horses, asses, mules, camels, rams, or bucks, as ' hoofs
{cf. Exod. X. 26 ; ' There shall not a hoof be left behind '). It is, therefore, a natural
question to ask how the same symbol could also denote the human foot, which is not
hard and horny, but soft and fleshy. Upon the whole, it seems possible that the
strange figure under consideration was originally a pictogram of the shod human foot
which, like the hoofs of quadrupeds, presented a hard surface to the ground ; or,
more simply and probably, it was the rude outline of some kind of boot, held up
sideways and heel upwards, and showing the thongs or cross-straps. {See Perrot
Chipiez, AC. ii, Plates X ; XV.) Such a symbol might come to be used ideographi
cally to signify also the hoofed or hard-footed animals, regarded as shod by nature.
(C/. Houghton, TSBA. vi. 470 ; and Hommel's explanation of the symbol as
Sandale mit Zeheti) To conclude our consideration of this peculiar ideogram, we
may observe that, in view of the remarkable parallelism above noted between its use
as a Determinative of certain species of quadrupeds and the corresponding use of
the Horse-Radical in Chinese writing, we seem to be justified in assuming that the
Chinese character for horse (R. 187) was not originally a picture of the animal, as is
commonly supposed, but finds its archetype in this very ancient Sumerian symbol,
some likeness to which the ku-wen form still exhibits, in spite of attempts to
assimilate it to the figure of a horse. {See Sign-list, No. 73 ; and cf. the analogous
treatment of the Swine-characters, Nos. 71 and 72.)
A good example of the way in which the use of the primitive characters (which
in themselves are merely pictures or, rather, roughly drawn outlines of physical
objects) was extended to the metaphorical expression of mental phenomena, may be
recognized in the linear form of JX^SfcJ the ideogram for AG, to love (^see Lex.),
consisting of a bushel or grain-measure with^r^ inside it (D. 62 ; 60-82). The bushel
(or grain-receiver) may here be a metaphor for the body or belly, or perhaps an
altered form of a lost character portraying it (cf p. xvi note). The conception of love
as an inward fire is universal (Cant. viii. 6, 7). Or, possibly, the bushel covering the
Fire-symbol may suggest a hidden fire {cf Matt. v. 15); but the former is the more
probable explanation. The linear character for GU(N), the neck or throat, apparently
a bottle or vase (D. 352), presents an analogy. (The seeming 'bottle' may have
originated in a rough sketch of the throat, the bulge being ' Adam's Apple '. See
Sign- list. No. 104.)



INTRODUCTION xiii
Again, the ideas of going straight, putting {causing to go) straight, being or
making right (' all right '), directing, governing, consulting, judging, determining,
deciding, are expressed by the ideogram Kj^^. the linear forms of which figure an eye,
with the pupil prominent, as if looking hard or straight before it {see Sign-list, No. 50).
The primary idea would be that of looking at or into things, seeing to or about them.
The symbol might originally have stood for the Eye of the all-seeing Sun-god, the
Judge of Heaven and Earth; though this assumption is not necessary to the under
standing of the character.
Another symbol which admits of more than one interpretative construction is
the ideogram for night (^^), discussed below (pp. 28 f ). The oldest form of the
character {see Sign-list, No. 69) has seven instead of eight short vertical strokes under
the shallow arc which seems to figure the arch of the firmament. How could such
a combination as this suggest the idea of night or darkness ? The scribe who first
wrote the symbol thus may have meant that it became dark when the seven divine
luminaries (the sun, the moon, and the five planets) were under cover or hidden ; or
the key to the original significance of the ideogram may rather be found in the
possibility that the seven strokes mean the Seven Evil Spirits, whose work it was to
quench the light of day and bring darkness over heaven and earth {see C. T. xvi. 19,
lines 30 ff.). In either case, the character will be an instance of a Suggestive
Compound (Class iii. p. 16), in which both elements {Jirmament \- seven) contribute to
the meaning.
The Woman-sign, ^, which was primarily an outline of the characteristic organ,
had many applications in the Sumerian script, some of which are noted in the Sign
list (Nos. 56-58). It seems, for instance, to account for the early confusion (due to
original identity?) of the symbols for ZU, 'to know', 'to learn' (which was also
used for ZU, the Pronoun of the Second Person), and SU, ' skin ', ' flesh', ' body', ' to
stretch', 'extend', 'increase', 'add to' (the last also given as meanings of ZU : Br.
134; '^'hi)- The primary idea of ZU, in that case, will have been to knoiv carnally
(Gen. iv. i ; xix. 8 ; Judges xxi. 1 1 f.) ; cf. the well-known line iiari rihd iltamad,
naidgam iltamad (ZU = lamadu, 'to learn', in each case). The symbol is what the
Chinese call an Inverted Character {Chuen chu : Class v ; see p. 20) ; and one to
three cross-lines are added in the oldest forms, the significance of which I must
leave undetermined for the present {Sign-list, No. 56 ; 56 a; 89). The use of the
same character, or a modification of it, for the word SU, 'skin', 'flesh', &c., is
intelligible enough when we consider the elastic and fleshy. nature of the female
organ. Hence the same symbol came to be used for the expression of the ideas of
extension, increase, addition, and the like (strictly, stretching; which is characteristic
of the skin, and associated with it in Chinese : see Chalmers, 1 74 and 75 a).^ That
" The character ^jywfj ' mother ', is also ' wide ', ' broad ', ' to broaden ', ' multiply ', &c. {see p. 26 f.).



xiv INTRODUCTION
ZU, the Pronoun of the Second Person (Suff.), should also be expressed in writing by
the symbol for ZU, 'to know', may be a mere instance of Phonetic Borrowing (Class
vi ; p. 23). In the Shi the Woman-character ^ is often to be read zu, 'thou'; and
the same symbol is phonetic in the ordinary way of writing the pronoun (Hr ' thou ',
' yon' = water + woman. Cf, the Sumerian use of Jf, the Water-sign, for 'thou';
Br. 1 1 329). It seems likely, however, that there may be a connexion of thought as
well as of sound, since the ordinary Sumerian symbol for a man (^^^) also signifies
the Pronoun of the First Person (Br. 6400). Cf. also ^^J ' wife ', ' thou ' {Sign-list,
No. 58), and perhaps the word ZU-ZU, 'lady' (Br. 745). From this point of view,
the Second is the inferior Person, the companion or associate of the First, as the
woman of the man.
The word ME, ' battle ', may be etymologically identical with ME, 'to do ' {see
Lex. s. z/.), with which it is homophonous ; cf. our English ' action ' in the like use.
In cuneiform, at all events, the two characters have been assimilated to each other
*")^I^3f, battle, now consisting of >-J'*'| do, with ^\ soldier, inserted. In the oldest
form we have, however, that of Gudea (D. 7), while we still see the horizontal bow
which stands for soldier (p. 20), the likeness to ME, 'to do' {Sign-list, No. 55), has
almost disappeared ; and the discovery of earlier forms of the character may hereafter
confirm my conjecture that the character was originally an outline of a lance and
oblong shield, such as we see the warriors of Eannatum bearing in the sculptured
scene on the famous Vulture-stele (De Sarzec, D^c. PI. 3. ii) ; * or perhaps the picture
of a bow, with an arrow on the string, held upright between the hands.
In another fragment of the same monument we have what I cannot but regard
as a striking confirmation of my analysis of the character tJU -^jpfl^, the symbol for
bearing and carrying (Sign-list, No. 75). I refer to the two men ascending the
tumulus and, with one hand, poising baskets of earth on their heads {D^c. PI. 3).
A variant like that of Lugalzaggisi only corroborates my view ; for it is clearly
a rough outline of the vessel being carried on the head zvitk both hands, as in the case
of the Canephoric statuettes {Ddc. PI. 28). As in the corresponding Chinese
characters {Sign-list, No. 75), only the essential parts of the pictograph are preserved.
The character, like that for battle, may be reckoned as another instance of a
Suggestive Compound (Class iii) ; though, considering its strictly pictorial origin, it
might be referred to Class i (p. 15), except in metaphorical applications.
As the Sun-symbol ^J appears, judging by its linear forms {Sign-list, No. 39), to
figure the rising sun (p. 20), so the linear forms of the Light-symbol *-^^ would seem
to portray the fully risen or the meridian sun, darting his beams above and below.
The sounds connected with the sign, viz. SIR, NUR (SIL, DUR), also agree essen
tially with zi, djit(su), nyit, nal, which are sounds of the Sun-symbol in Chinese (R. 72 ;
see pp. 13 ; 21 ; and Sign-list, No. 107). The lines within the figure, which like those

INTRODUCTION xv
of the old Chinese forms, vary considerably, may be supposed to represent the visible
markings or spots on the disk of the orb of day.
The ambiguity and perplexity arising from the vagueness of the attenuated and
impoverished remnants of what once were outlines of visible objects, sufficiently clear
and determinate for immediate perception of the thing intended, will continue to
baffle the would-be interpreter, until more material of a still more primitive character,
such as the inscription published by Scheil (De Morgan, Ddldgation en Perse, ii. 130),
has been discovered and satisfactorily deciphered and explained. A system of
writing which has come to represent the oval of a bird's body by a scalene triangle
(see Sign-list, No. 32) and rounded figures by rhomboidal or square outlines (ib., Nos.
39 ; 45), has undoubtedly arrived at a stage of formal simplicity where confusion and
misunderstanding become inevitable. The character ^^, meaning ybf^, may be the
simple Food-sign ^ (which in its oldest shape appears as a bowl or basin with
something in it), augmented by the addition of ^ a cover (seeV). 337; 277; Sign
list, No. 24). But what looks like a cover may have been intended, in the original
figure, to suggest a bowl piled high with eatables, especially as the character denotes
also a food-offering ; while there is a third possibility that both the simple and the
augmented characters were originally meant to depict bread-cakes of different shapes.
Indeed, if we compare the linear forms of the Eye-symbol ^^ (D. 253 ; Sign-list,
No. 50) and the Food-symbol 4^ (D. 277; Sign-list, No. 24), we shall see that the
one almost resembles a mere inversion of the other ; and we might, accordingly,
suppose that the apparently composite Food-symbol originally contemplated food as
something looked at wistfully and longed for, something eminently desirable (Gen.
iii. 6) ; a solution which, however little we may be inclined to acquiesce in it, will not
appear violently improbable to those who have any acquaintance with the speculative
attempts of the Chinese literati to analyse and explain their own characters. But
I pass on to another group of similar and seemingly related signs.
The word URU-DU, 'copper', ^< j. is represented by the linear figure [~^
(D. 362), which certainly suggests some kind of vessel or utensil. Hommel thought
it was a crucible or melting-pot {Schmelzliegel) ; but smelting is hardly distinctive
enough {cf. the bilingual Hymn to the Fire-god, 4 R. 14. 16 ff., which mentions the
smelting or refining of copper, lead, silver, and gold, successively). It seems more
probable and more accordant with analogy that the figure is that of some copper
vessel or implement, familiar from everyday use at the time of the invention of the
symbol ; perhaps a ' bronze ' bucket with a looped handle {cf. the illustrations, Perrot
Chipiez, AC. ii. 325), or a bowl with a ring, or even a dish with a ladle, or something
similar {cf. the symbol for the pestle and mortar or hand-mill, D. 374 f.). Whatever
the precise vessel intended, it is certain that great similarity is observable between
the oldest known forms of the cuneiform signs t^^Uy, fe^my, t^fTT and that of this



xvi INTRODUCTION
symbol for copper. The first of these is UM, 'pregnant woman' ( = EM id.);
'a mother'; M. 2578; 2589. The word is identical with the Chinese yem, nyim,
yiin, yiing, eing, ying, ' pregnant ' {vtd. Comp. Lex). The character surely represents
a full vessel {see D, 79) ; the ' vessel ' being, of course, the bulging uterus, which
contains the embryo.^ It was at least assimilated at a very early period (before
3CXX) B.C.) to other characters which unquestionably represent vessels in common use.
And if the neck or throat could be symbolized by a vessel (bottle ? ; see Sign-list,
No. 104), the trunk or belly might with equal justice be so signified. The second
symbol, t^t^fyjl DUB, DIG, &c., was actually interchanged with the symbol for
copper, and read URUDU (perhaps indicating an original sound URU-DUB =
URU-DUG), and SHEN, apparently a kind of copper or bronze (C T. xii. 14a; cf.
'] a). It shares the reading MES, 'male', 'great', 'lordly', 'son' (idlu, rubii, mdru)
with the third character ^TTT, which itself is the common cuneiform representative of
two or three originally distinct linear forms (D. 363; 419; cf. 429). DUB means
' to pour out ' water and other liquids, ritually or otherwise, and then ' to pour (earth)
in a heap ', to heap it up {e.g. in embanking a canal or forming the nucleus of
a rampart ; hence it is also to surround or enclose and to mark off, as with a wall or
other boundary). The idea of pouring out is appropriately symbolized by a vessel
containing something indicated by one or more cross-lines, which is the linear form of
the character {Sign-list, No. 49). The same idea of pouring out would also explain
the extension of use by which the character for DUB was made to include the word
MES, ' male ' {cf. Num. xxiv. 7 : V7"l& D'fi ?V), from which the transition of thought
to ' great one', ' hero ', &c., is easy and, in fact, usual ; and also to MES, ' son ' {mdru ;
M. 2605), as being the oiUpouring, i.e. issue or seed of the male {cf. A, 'son').
Inscribed tablets of clay were also called DUB ; a word which was written with the
same character, though the reason for this use of the sign is hardly self-evident.
Perhaps it is merely an instance of Phonetic Borrowing {see p. 23, Class vi). It
might be said, of course, that the old linear forms {Sign-list, No. 49) offer some
resemblance to a square tablet with a stylus or writing-reed ; but, as we have seen,
that probably is not the original significance of the pictogram, but rather some vessel
for pouring out liquids—a vessel with a narrow neck and a bulging or bulbous body.
The third character, ^TTT, when read MES, ' male', appears to spring from an
old symbol which is almost or altogether identical with that which we have been
considering ( i-Ll-i ; D. Suppl. 363), and therefore admitting of the same explanation.
The readings SANGU, 'priest', and LAG, 'offering', go back to a different linear
symbol ( |t ; D. 419), the pictorial significance of which is far from being evident
' It is conceivable, and perhaps probable, that cf. p. xii, AG and GU(N). There is no doubt
the symbol was originally intended as a front view about the significance of the Egyptian hieroglyph
of the female trunk, with protruding abdomen: S) \^ 'pregnant'.



INTRODUCTION xvH
and beyond dispute. It might possibly figure a sort of priestly tiara or mitre (t/. the
symbol D. 91, which it somewhat resembles); but the head-dress of the priests as
portrayed on the seals is usually pointed, not truncated at the top like this
character ; and a mitre does not seem a particularly appropriate symbol for a present
or offering to the 'gods. The same objection would lie against any other article of
priestly attire. A hand presenting something would suit both meanings better ; cf,
the archaic form of the hand published by Barton in the Journal of the American
Oriental Society, xxiii. 19, and the Egyptian symbols for giving and offering (Erman,
Gr. p. 176, Breasted's Trans., 1894). What the hand holds in the Sumerian symbol
may be (or have been) a libatory vessel, the cross-lines representing the rim and
bottom of the cup. This would account for the association and ultimate confusion of
the character with others expressing the idea of pouring in various applications.
Thus the priest is symbolized by his function of making offerings (libations) ; and
the same symbol naturally serves for that which he offers, whether it be a drink
offering or other gift {cf. nigtl, Trankopfer ; Opfer ; Opferlamm).
It might be suggested that the entire symbol originally represented a libatorium
of peculiar shape. The point of importance, however, is that the priest appears to
have been figured in this symbol as one who oj^ers or presents something ; and that
the something was an outpouring or ' drink-offering ' is rendered yet more probable
by the features of resemblance between this character and others, the essential idea
of which is the act oi pouring out. Thus the linear form of the character tfiy^ LAG,
LUG, ' to wash ritually or ceremonially', ' to cleanse ', to purify ' (misti), 'a servant or
minister ', especially of the gods {sukkalhi), looks like a pictogram of water pouring
down on something and flowing away (D. 102). To pour water on the hands was
a characteristic function of personal attendants {cf 2 Kings iii. 11:' Elisha . . . who
poured water on the hands of Elijah ').^ Another symbol suggestive of the same idea
of pouring or being poured in a heap is fflt, the linear form of t^JJ, read ISH (GISH),
MIL ( = MISH), SA-6aR, with the meanings 'dust' or 'earth', 'soil', and 'hill'.
It seems to depict earth or soil pouring down on a heap or mound which in form
resembles the contemporary equivalents of ^]^, ' the Earth '. It must be remem
bered that the Earth itself was a huge ' mound ' or ' mountain ' in Babylonian belief.
Dust, earth, soil, is therefore visualized in the written character as that which is
poured in heaps, whether in the mounds of cities, or the banks of canals, or in natural
hills and hillocks. {See D. 97 ; 254.) The use of the same symbol for ISH, ' to
^ The same ideogram was also used phonetically last meaning and, moreover, finds some analogy in for LU6, 'to fear', ' to revere ', and tram, 'to Chinese usage, where the Net-character (R. 122) frighten ' ; fear or reverence being the natural atti- with the Determinative heart means ' perturbed
tude of inferiors toward superiors (see Lex. LAG, (P. 488). Cf. also the Hebrew play on no, net, and LUG). The symbol of an Inverted Net, which is '\V&,/ear, Isa. xxiv. 17 f.
another linear form of the character, would suit this



xviii INTRODUCTION
weep ', is doubtless phonetic ; though the choice of it may have been determined by
a fancied likeness of several of the old forms to an eye streaming with tears (cf.
D. 238). The last symbol which resembles and may be nearly related to the fore
going is I , the ideogram for KI-SAL (D. 415) ; a word which denotes the raised
floor or platform of earth, cased with brick, on which temples and palaces were
usually erected. The cross-line at the top of the figure may be taken to indicate the
enclosing of the soil heaped on the site within the casing of brickwork.
The natural flow or running of water, as opposed to being poured out by man,
would seem to be suggested by the use of wavy lines, indicating the broken or
rippling surface of a stream. Thus it is that the word LUM, ' to grow ', appears in
the old linear script as W m ; symbols which closely resemble some of the ku-win
forms of the Chinese character for water, which very fittingly symbolizes luxuriant
growth of vegetation, especially in the hot East (Jer. xvii. 8); and the word ZI,
'right', is written reed 'rgrowing (GI+LUM), although the original pictogram may
have been modified to this result (D, 135; 297; Sign-list, No. 95). The antique
form of t^]y SAR, 'vegetation', which seems to figure 'trees planted by the water'
(Jer. /. c), may also be compared {Ddl^gation en Perse, ii. 130; Sign-list, No. 46).
The ordinary character for water, |if, has various linear forms. All are horizontal
pairs of lines ; whereas in Chinese we have more symmetrical groups of three lines,
both horizontal and vertical. The simplest Sumerian form, which is = , possibly
figures the two banks of a stream, rather than the water flowing between them ; but
other forms, which are waved, suggest running water, e.g. =^z= (D. 470). On the
other hand, the straight parallel lines of the linear forms of E, EG, 'ditch', PA,
'canal', and RA, 'to flood' or 'irrigate' {see D. 109; 11 1; 413; 520), seem to
indicate clearly enough the two banks of an irrigating channel bordering a plot of
ground ; the cross-lines of PA and RA representing the sluices and ditches which
conduct the water from the main supply on to the land. The oldest form of
E (D. 109 Suppl) shows a main stream with two smaller ones branching off
from it at right angles. PA is apparently the same character, with KUR (PAP),
' support ', ' help ', inserted between the two branch canals. This X-like insertion
(Sign-list, No. 27; 51), representing originally a (tripod?) stand or support for vessels,
when inserted in the House-character AB (D. 345) gives us the ideogram for AD,
' father ', ' mother ', ' parent ' ; the suggestion being that parents are the support on
which the house or family stands (D. 376). Both \^} PA, ' irrigation-canal ', and
f:^ AD, 'parent', are thus seen to be instances of the third Class of Characters
('Combined Meanings' or 'Suggestive Compounds': see p. 16). The ideogram
^<^4ff- , A-ZU, U-ZU, 'seer', 'witch-doctor' (S^ 202), belongs to the same Class;
consisting, as it appears to do, of a full measure (D. 60) with the symbol for magic
(ME, SHIB) inserted. The 'doctor' is suitably suggested by his vessel of charmed
water or other potent materials. Other clear examples of the same Class are g^<yTT^*-T



INTRODUCTION xix
SHAM, SAM, 'price', which in linear exhibits the measure (D. 60) with an ear of
corn (D. 140) inside it (D. 61)—an ideogram which takes us back to the days of
exchange by barter or payment in kind; J^ UDU, 'a sheep', which in linear
writing is compounded of >^ MASH, 'domestic animals ' {bUlum ; Br. 1749), within
C"! 'an enclosure' (D. 454); t^tlT SI, 'gall', 'bitterness', which looks like GU,
'throat', with SIG, 'burn', inserted (D. 347; cf. Ddl. en Perse, ii. Ob. de Man);
^^^y LAL, 'honey', 'sweet', which in linear depicts z.jar of some kind with DUG,
'good', 'sweet', inscribed on the side of it (D. 357; cf. 355; 356); and ,^ft^|f{]f
SHANGA, SHAG, SHA, 'to be bright or pure', 'to purify', 'refine metals', the
linear forms of which picture the process of fertilizing the date-palm (a frequent
subject of the Assyrian sculptures), which was doubtless regarded as a magical rite
of purification of the female tree. (See Sign-list, No. 106.) The character ^py], SIG,
SI, ' horn ', would appear from the linear figure to represent, not the straight horn of
a bull, but the curving or spiral horn of a ram (D. 47 ; ^, 1— ). Naturally the use
of the symbol was extended to include horns of every shape and kind ; as also the
'horns' or curved ends of the crescent moon, and the 'horns' {garndte) of a ship.
The last is an interesting point, because the character for MA, 'ship' (t:yyy), is
evidently identical with the Horn-symbol, modified by the mere addition of a single
short stroke (D. 340 : ^, 1— f).^ It would seem, then, that a ship or boat was
regarded as a horned thing—a thing of which horns, or what from an obvious and
striking resemblance could well be called ' horns ', constituted the most salient
feature. How are we to determine what this feature was ? If Sumerian writing was
really pictorial to begin with, it is reasonable to look to the remains of Sumerian art,
preserved in the sculptures and seal-engravings, for the original types of many of the
simplified pictures which we find in the linear script. By reference to these
monumental sources we have, in fact, already succeeded in explaining several
important ideograms ; and the present is an instance in which we might very
naturally turn for help to the same sources. Now the boats figured on the archaic
seals have both ends curved upwards, for all the world like horns ; in fact, there is
considerable resemblance between a boat of this kind, as depicted on the seals, and
the crescent moon as it appears on the seal of Ur-Engur (see the photographs in my
Light from the East, pp. 34 and 50). In at least one example the high ends or
' horns ' of the boat are even curved inwards at the top spirally, like rams' horns
{see Hayes Ward, Cylinder Seals of Western Asia). It seems probable, therefore,
that these high horn-like ends are the 'horns', which suggested the use of the
Horn-pictogram (very slightly modified) as the written symbol for a boat. It goes
almost without saying that we should not look to the sculptures of later times, such
as those which portray the war-galleys of Sennacherib, for the illustration of
' A Chinese use of the same device may be seen in the Sign-list, Nos. 38-40.

XX INTRODUCTION
a primitive character like the one in question, but to the remains of an age far more
nearly contemporaneous with the origin of the character.^
The Sumerian symbol for boat or ship is thus seen to be, not a picture of the
object, but of something else which, by its form, suggests two similar parts of it, and
so brings to mind the image of the whole vessel, as an udder suggests a she-goat or
a lifted foot the dog {see Class i; p. 15). In like manner, the Hnear form of ^^J
GAN, 'enclosed plot', 'garden', 'field', may possibly figure a gate; thus suggesting
a place shut up or barred against intruders {see Sign-list, No. 9). This view of the
significance of the character is corroborated by its surprisingly close resemblance to
the gates figured on an old Babylonian seal which portrays the opening of the Gates
of Dawn {Light from the East, p. 151).
A symbol more difficult to deal with, as being less immediately suggestive to
a modern eye, is ^^]w NAR, ' singer ', minstrel ',
' musician ' ; a character which is also
read LUL, LUG, LUB, LIB, BAu (inferred from Assyrian value pakh), in various
senses. The first use, in the sense of ' singers ' (with Det. Prefix of either sex), is
the most important application of the symbol (Br. 7274) ; and the god Ae was called
DUNGA (-^fc^jc:) as the god of musicians (Br. 7270). The word NAR is probably
cognate with (or the older sound of) SHAR, SAR, 'to sing' or 'sing with musical
accompaniment' (p. 13; C. T. xii. 40). This being so, we might have expected
that the linear form of the character would resemble that of some musical instrument,
a harp, for instance, such as we see depicted in the bas-relief from Tell-L6, now in
the Louvre Museum {Ddc, PI. 23 ; ^ee Light from the East, p. 58, for a photographic
reproduction) ; and it certainly does present some degree of likeness to an Assyrian
' dulcimer ' of the seventh century b. c, as figured on a sculptured slab from the
palace of Assurbanipal {see Enc. Bibl., col. 3236, fig. 19; col. 3239, fig. 25).
The form of the character, however, and the fact that male singers were usually
eunuchs {see the figure of the beardless musician in the sculpture of Assurbanipal's
banquet. Light from the East, p. 202 ; and cf. the remarks in Perrot and Chipiez,
AC. i. 96-103), may suggest another solution, viz. that the linear symbol really
figures a drooping phallus (penis emasculatus) ; the Knee-symbol, with inserted cross,
at the top of the ideogram indicating the deprivation of virile power (DUG, rihH,
riMtu, penis, coire, coitio-f-MASH, ellu, purus). It is not more singular that such
a symbol should serve as ideogram for ' eunuch-singer ', and then simply ' singer ',
than that an erect phallus, emitting semen, should be the common ideogram for
'lofty', 'exalted', 'supreme', in hymns to the gods (MAG, siru, hoch, erhaben : see
Sign-list, No. 28). Moreover, the character was also read LUL, in the sense of
sarru, ' insolent ', ' refractory ', ' rebellious ', ' rebel ', ' wicked ' ; perhaps because
eunuchs had a bad name for sullen insubordination. In later times we know that
^ It is, of course, possible that in later times the Assyrian phrase qarndti la elippi, ' the horns of a ship ', denoted the ' yard-arms ' or ' sail-yards ' {Ktpaia ; comua antennarum) ; but the primitive Euphratean boats were propelled by oars, not sails.



INTRODUCTION xxi
they became a proverb of moral corruption. However that may have been, as
regards their vocal powers it is well known that adult eunuchs may retain their
childish soprano and, in fact, the choir of the Sistine Chapel was recruited from such
persons, until Leo XIII abolished an evil tradition. It seems possible that the
Assyrian lallaru, ' howler ', ' wailer ', and lallartu, lallar&ti, ' wailing ' (also ' joyful
shouting'), may have sprung from LAR-LAR= NAR-NAR. At any rate, as music
may be mournful as well as joyous, we can understand how the character came to be
used for LUB or LIB ( = LUG, LIG i*), ' a lament' or ' cry of woe' [kuru) ; while its
use for LIG, LIB, 'strong' (Br. 7276), was merely phonetic, as Jensen long ago
perceived (ZA. i. 396). And as, further, clearness of sound and brightness of light are
commonly expressed in language by the same or kindred roots [cf. Heb. 77n I and
II ; 7nX I and II), we also seem to see a real connexion between LUG, ' to scream',
' to sing' (?), and LUG in the groups t^U IgQf ^^K KUSH-LUG {cf. <Ig[ i:^\
KUSH-LUG, 'flaring up' ?), 'to shine', 'be bright', and ^ ^Jt SUS-LUG, in the
same sense {namdru). But why was the same simple sign selected to denote the fox
or jackal (probably both) ? and which of the sounds associated with the sign bore this
meaning ? The word might well have been LUG, dial. LUB or LIB ; cf. LIG, LI,
which are known sounds of the Dog-symbol, and the Chinese li, li-k, a name for the
fox and certain other small animals, as well as the Assyrian Ulabu, ieiidu, Ullibu =
Arab, tha/ab, 'fox' (which last may have sprung from ^L-B + the Factitive SHA),
and even the Greek d\a>nrj^, the Lithuanian Idpe, and the Latin vulpes. Foxes and
jackals may have been called LUG (LUB, LIB), because of their 'bright' (j-e. red,
or reddish-gold) colour ; cf. Moh cHih fei hu, ' Nothing red is seen but foxes ' (Legge,
SAt, I. iii. XVI. 3). The vagueness of colour-terms in ancient speech is illustrated
by the Chinese cA'tA, ch'ik, ' red ', which is said of gold, copper, fire, foxes, and brown
sugar ! Thus the word may be etymologically akin to LAG, LUG, ' bright ',
'shining' (in KUSH-LUG, SUS-LUG, ZA-LAG, namdru), and perhaps, further, to
DU ( = DUG, DUB = LUG, LUB?) in URU-DU, 'copper', which is the 'red'
metal par excellence: cf. also the Semitic iHX, 'gleam', 'shine' (Heb., of bronze),
' yellow ' or ' golden ' (Heb., of hair) ; 'red' (Arab.) ;—a root formed from ZIB = DUB
by internal Triliteralization. (The jackal might, of course, have been called LUG,
LUB, because of its howling; but this would not apply to the fox whose only cry
is a short, sharp bark.)
Among other characters which the extant remains of Sumerian antiquity enable
us to refer to their concrete originals with a considerable degree of assurance are
*-*-yyy GIR, tab, 'a lance', 'lightning' (cf. the Chinese word sham, shap. Hem, 'to
flash ', of lightning, G. 9707), ' to flash ' ; the linear form of which (D. 3, 4) is the head
of a lance or spear such as we see in the Assyrian sculptures {cf. also the flat oval
blade figured in Heuzey, Une Villa royale, fig. 19): t:!^ SHUM, 'to kill', 'to
slaughter ', a man or a sheep, the linear form of which seems to exhibit a blade like

the last, with a shaft or handle (D. 371 ; cf. D. 4); E^< URU (UR, GUR?), 'to
guard', 'protect', the linear form of which {Sign-list, No. 59) greatly resembles
a long copper weapon (lance or spear-shaft ?), found by De Sarzec at Tell-Lo, with
a looped handle at the side, which also appears to be figured on the vase of Gudea and
on certain archaic seals {see Heuzey, Une Villa royale, fig. 1 9 ; Musde du Louvre, Cat.
p. 401 ; Perrot and Chipiez, AC. i. 84, fig. 17) ; although another possible original of
the character may perhaps be recognized in an oblong shield, with ring-handle,
viewed sideways, such as we see in the sculptures from Nimriid: ^|]f KU(N, G),
'bright', 'shining', which on the archaic Blau Monument, Brit. Mus., No. 86260, is
shaped thus xii'^ (D. 252); a figure which it does not seem fanciful to compare
with the sickle-shaped sword or scimitar of AdadnirAri I, of which a drawing was
given in Light from the East, p. 133, and especially with the boomerang-like weapon
of the Sumerian sculptures (Louvre, Cat., No. 5), to one form of which the linear
symbol approaches very nearly {see Heuzey, Comptes rendus, 1908, pp. 415-422;
DSc, PI. 46, No. 3, a fragment of engraved shell from Tell-Lo) : 1 t]]^ GAR, MAR
(C. T. xii. 18), the linear form of which (D. 77) might be a conventionalized copy of
the shafts and cross-piece (yoke) of a chariot, set up on end {see Perrot and Chipiez,
AC. i. fig. 23), as I^ GI-NAR, 'chariot', was very probably a picture of a wheel
originally (D. 453), although (by omission of some of the spokes) the character has
been reduced to an apparent compound of the signs for circle + open (not a bad
ideogram for a wheel like that in AC. loc. cit., not solid but divided by spokes) :
\f^y DUL, DU, 'a mound', 'to cover', 'to hide', which originally represented
a tumulus or burial-mound such as is depicted on the Vulture-stele, where we see
Eannatum's warriors raising one over their slain comrades after a battle (D. 233 :
the strokes within the triangle, which represents the mound, indicate the bodies) :
»-yyyy nun, ZIL ( = ZIN), 'great', 'tall', the linear forms of which suggest a tree of

is removed by milling. (The use of the unaltered symbol in GISH-TUG, MUSH

linear characters (allowing for the inevitable percentage of mistaken comparisons)
and probably not a few besides, which need not be suggested or considered on the

INITIAL AND FINAL SOUNDS—THEIR CORRESPONDENCE
AND PARALLEL CHANGES
It is evident that the preceding list presents at a glance sufficient similarity
between the material of the two languages to suggest at once the hypothesis of
relationship. But if we look below the surface, as Philology justifies us in doing, we
shall discover in Chinese a large number of vocables which, although they have
become dissimilar in the natural course of phonetic change, were originally either
identical with the corresponding sounds of the primitive Sumerian speech, or at all
events manifestly akin to them. In fact, much as Philology justifies us in connecting
the Latin aqua with the French eau, so it may justify us in connecting the Chinese
ho, river, with the Sumerian ID, I, river, and CjAL, to flow ; although the three
terms possess not a letter in common. When it is pointed out that the character
^
ho is still read ka or ga in the traditional Japanese pronunciation, which is more
faithful to the ancient sounds of the Chinese, and that the kindred Mongol word for
river is gol, Manchau hoi ; we see at once that the Chinese initial h represents, as
indeed is usual, an older k (from a yet earlier g), and that the lost final of the root
is 1 or a related sound. It thus appears likely that the Chinese ho, river, is akin to
the Sumerian GAL, to flow. But, further, the Sumerian ID, I, river, which occurs
in the name I.DIGNA, Assyrian Idiglat, the Tigris, is really a worn form of GID,
as is shown by the Hebrew transcription Vpin Khiddeqel ; and this earlier GID
suggests a primary GAD, cognate with GAL, to flow, and identical with the old
Chinese kat, gat, river (cf P. 145).



INITIAL AND FINAL SOUNDS, ETC. ^
Take another instance, ^ ho, fire, was formerly ka, as we learn again from the
Japanese pronunciation ; and the Mongol gal, fire, again suggests the loss of a final
dental (Mongol 1 = Chinese t). Thus kat, or gat, emerges as the oldest form of the
Chinese word for fire. But instead of a guttural initial, the dialects present a labial
sound ; Cantonese and Hakka fo, Wenchow fu, implying an earlier pa, ba : others
exhibit transitional sounds, Mandarin hwo, Fuchau hwi ; c/. Korean and Annamite
hwa (ga = gwa = wa). The Chinese sounds, therefore, appear to suggest gat (gal)
and bat (bal) as their biform original. Now the Sumerian character for fire was read
IZ (from GIZ, GAZ ; GUZ, c/. USSl), IZI, fire; and BI, to kindle, to flare up;
and PIL (from BIL, BAL), to burn. We find also the compounds GI.BIL, burning,
light; and GISH.BAR, dialectic MU.BAR, fire. The Fire-god was called BIL.GI (from BAL.GI), later GI.BIL; and GISH.BAR. BAR and BAL in this sense are
evidently related to each other, and to BAR, dialectic MASH, to shine ; while GAZ
is akin to GAR, light. And it is equally clear that the old Chinese sounds gat, bat,
closely correspond to the Sumerian (G)IZ (GAZ), GAR, and BIL (BAL), BAR.
With BI, to kindle, cf. the Japanese hi, fire, from bi, pi, and with BAR, Jap. abure,
to roast. As regards the interchange of sounds, the transition from a guttural to
a labial initial is a common feature of both languages. A good example may be seen
in the Sumerian USH (from GUSH), blood, and what we may call its M-form, MUD,
blood ; a pair of words which are perfectly represented by, or preserved in, the
Chinese hiieh and mieh, blood. That the older sound of hiieh was kut, is inferred
from the Jap. ket-si, compared with Cantonese hiit and Hakka het {see G. 4847) ;
and kut = GUD, GUSH. As for mieh (G. 7880), it is surely enough to adduce
the Cantonese myt, Hakka met, Jap. bet-si or me-chi, Annamite miet, to confirm the
suggestion of its close kindred with the Sumerian MUD, blood.
There can be little doubt, one would think, that the Sumerian (G)USH and
MUD, on the one hand, and their Chinese equivalents hiieh-hut and mieh-myt, on
the other, although given in the dictionaries as mutually independent words, are
really related to each other in much the same way as GISH and MESH, GU and
MU, tree, wood, are related in Sumerian, or as ho and fo, fire, or ngo and wo, I, in
Chinese. One is simply a labialized form of the other.
The Chinese Phonetics have preserved many vestiges of such philological
counterparts. Thus in Sumerian, ^^, the character denoting black and night, had
the sounds GA, GE, GIG, and MI (from MIG, MUG). Accordingly, we find that
the Chinese M (P. 862) has the Phonetic values kek and mek. By itself, the
character is read hei or h^ or ho, C. hak, H. het, W. he, hah, hek, K. hik, J. koku, black
{see G. 3899) ; and with the Radical or Determinative j^ earth, it is ^ mo, mek,
met, meik, mai, me, muk, me, K. mik, J. boku and moku, A. mak, ink ; black ; obscure
(G. 8022). It will be noticed that the vowel-variation resembles that of the values
of the Sumerian prototype, GA, GE, GIG, MI, KUKKU. Of course, the sound



6 INITIAL AND FINAL SOUNDS, ETC.
belongs to the Phonetic ^. The Radical, added later for distinction's sake, has
nothing to do with sound, but only with sense.
Again, l£ wang, wong, W. oa, J. o, A. vong, king, prince (G. 12493, P. 65), and
huang, wong, fong, oa, K. A, hwang, J.kwo, the ruler or sovereign, and the
Almighty (G. 5106; P. 574), are related in the same way. They are the modern
representatives of the Sumerian GUN, MUN, UGUN, UMUN, king, lord, used of
both heavenly and earthly potentates. (The connexion of the modern with the
primitive terms is further happily confirmed by the resemblance of the character for
huang to that of GUN : see List of Similar Characters : No. 82.)
Again, the Chinese -^ mu, muk, K. mok, J, moku, wood, a tree (G. 8077 ; P. 80),
is used as a Phonetic with the sound hiu, in the word -^ hiu. The old sound was
kut (P. 278). Now these sounds mu, kut, which belong to the tree-character, find
a close parallel in the Sumerian MU and GU, which are given as values of the tree
character (C. T. xii. 30), which itself is the obvious prototype of the corresponding
Chinese symbol (see List, No. 25). The Sumerian expression ZAG.MUG, ' Begin
ning of the Year' (ZAG, 'head'; MU, MUG, 'year'), shows that one lost final of
MU, tree, may have been G, in exact correspondence with the Chinese mu, muk.
On the other hand, we have also in Sumerian the synonymous GISH, MESH, wood,
tree ; properly, as the character suggests, a stripped trunk, a piece of timber. This
sound GISH (from GUSH ? cf. GU = MU) agrees with the old Chinese kut
(P. 80) ; and also with yeh, yt, A.k'iet, stake, post (G. 13014), formerly ngit (P. 744),
and with nieh, A. niet, ngiet, a small post (G. 8278), and yeh, nieh, ngft. Am. giat,
a tree-stump (G. 8283). These words and the like all point to the Sumerian GISH,
also read NISH, trunk, timber, wood, tree. (MUG is related to MESH as MU6,
to beget, bear, to MUD in the same senses.)
In like manner, the four words hu, u, wu, throat, neck, P. 544 ; hou, wu, throat,
gullet (G. 4007); king, keng, J. kei, neck, throat (G. 2126); hiang, ngong, J. ko,
nape of neck (G. 4291); are the modern representatives of the G- and M-forms
covered by the single Sumerian character >4^^, read GUN, GU, and MU ( = wu),
neck, throat : and the Chinese kou, dirt (from got, P. 10 1, 268), G. 6163 ; mei, miii,
me, dust (from mot, P. 719), G. 7746; and mo, mut, mat, K. mal, dust, G. 7999
(ff. also mo, mok, dust, G. 7979) ; answer with equal completeness to the sounds
belonging to the old Sumerian character for dust, dirt, earth, viz. ISH (from GISH,
GASH = GAR) : SA.6AR ; and MIL (MAL). The SA of the compound SA.6AR
may be the Chinese sha, sa, from sak, sand, G. 9624.
Similarly, Ch. hwang, A. kwang, bright, dazzling, G. 5137 (old sound kom)
kuang, kong, J. ko, light, brightness, G. 6389; king, kin, bright, beautiful, G. 2143,
and other kindred words (e.g. 2142, 2149) ; and Ch. ming, min, light, bright, represent
the Sumerian KUM, flame, fire; KUN, to shine; and MEL (MEN), MUN, flame,
flashing, brightness.



INITIAL AND FINAL SOUNDS, ETC. 7
Lastly, to conclude with an instance as remarkable as any, the Sumerian group
Vj r" had the two values GAL, MUL (written GALLA, MULLA), and the meaning
ghost, spirit, demon (Assyr. loanword gallti). Here, as I pointed out years ago,
we have an exact agreement with the Chinese ^ kwei, cii, kwai, J. ki, ghosts, spirits,
demons, G. 6430 (old sound kut, P. 684), and ^ mei, mui, mi, H. mat, mwoui,
K. mi, J. bi, mi, a demon, G. 7738 (old sound mot, P. 135). Cf. also G. 7748.
The old Chinese final t = Sumerian L, as in many other instances (see pp. 4, 10).
From the above examples it will be seen that sometimes the related G- and
M- or B-forms are represented by one and the same character, sometimes by
different characters. It will also be noticed that these changes from guttural to
labial sounds, which are characteristic of the Eme-sal, 'The Women's Speech'
or softer pronunciation of Sumerian, reappear in the Chinese dialects in the most
unmistakable manner. And in both languages closely related words, distinguished
by these different initial sounds (G, K, H = M, B, P, W), occur, not only as dialectic
variations, but also as constituent elements in the vocabulary of the main body of
speech: e.g. 'blood' is expressed by (G)USH and MUD in Sumerian, and by the
corresponding words hiit and myt in Chinese.
We saw that the character for mei, demon, is read bi as well as mi by the
Japanese. This reminds us of the Sumerian equivalence BAR = MASH. The
mutual equivalence of the labial letters, and the transition from one to another of
them, finds ample illustration in the Chinese dialects. It is well known that F,
which seems never to have emerged in Sumerian (unless we regard SfXiipdr,
Hesychius's transcription of DIL-BAD, as an indication of its appearance at the
very latest stage in the history of the language), is a modern sound in Chinese.
It is wanting in Mongol. In Chinese it has taken the place of an older p, which
itself sprang from b. The dialects and the older pronunciation of Chinese words
traditional in Korea, Japan, and Annam, supply abundant proof of this and other
facts important for Chinese Phonology and Chinese Etymology. ^ fang, house,
for instance, is K. pang, J. bo (Japanese drops the final ng, as always), Ningpo vong,
Wenchow voa, Shanghai vang, Amoy pong (G. 3440). Here we have f, p, b, v,
in succession. The old sound would be bam, ban ; and the term appears to be
ultimately identical with the Sumerian MAL, house, which is probably from MAN
(WAN), weakened from GAN. The character is t^], read GA (GA-L or GA-N)
and MAL. A trace of GA(N) may be recognized in Fuchau hwong ( = kwong,
gong). So feng, the wind, K. pung, A. fong, anciently bam (P. 571); but the
Fuchau hung ( = kung) implies an earlier kam, gam, agreeing with the primary
Sumerian GAM, GAN, the wind, which later became IM, EN.
This last word illustrates another important and normal interchange of sounds
in both languages ; I mean that of the final m and n. As the Sumerian character
^4f, wind, was read both IM and EN, so we find in Chinese that i'f^, heart, is read



B INITIAL AND FINAL SOUNDS, ETC.
sin by the Japanese and sim by the Koreans. Further, the Cantonese says sem
(sum or sam), the Hakka sim, the Pekingese hsin (with an approach to sh). Bearing
in mind what has been said of the free interchange of the labial letters, we see that
the Chinese word is ultimately the same as the Sumerian SHAB ( = SHAM), heart.
But the Eme-ku, the harsher Sumerian dialect, pronounced the term SHAG, or
(especially when linked with other subordinate words) SH AG-GA. In the latter case,
at all events, the G seems to have been nasalized in utterance, thus SH ANGA ; so that
we have here a prototype of the Wenchow sang, Ningpo sing, Yangchow hsing, heart.
Other Sumerian instances of N=M are ALAN, ALAM, likeness, image;
MU.TAN, NITA.DAM, husband ; GIN, GIM, DEN, DIM, DAM, TUMA,
like; SUN, SUM, to give.
In the word feng, bam, wind, Chinese has preserved the labial initial in the
standard speech, in contrast with the Sumerian IM (GIM, GAM). In ^ wang,
to go, it has in like manner preserved the softer initial sound, Wang, C. H. F.
wong, A. vang, presents a trace of the other sound initial g, in Wenchow yiioa
(y = older g) ; and wong implies a guttural counterpart kwong, from gong, answering
to the Sumerian GIN (from GUN ?), to go, which is the Chinese hing, ging, to walk,
just as hwang. J. kwo, and wang, A. vong, answer to Sumerian GUN, MUN
(p. 5 seg.). The labialized or M-form of GIN, to go, has not yet been identified in
Sumerian ; but MAL ( = MAN), the Erne-sal of GA(L), to go {aldku, C. T. xii. 27), is
nearly akin to it and to the Chinese wang.
According to Edkins (Chinas Place in Philology, p. 78), the old Chinese final
letters were ng, n, m, k, t, p, and the vowels ; sounds retained to this day in the
Canton and Amoy dialects. The initials were g, d, b, ng, n, m, 1, z, dz, zh, and the
vowels. From g, d, b, z, dz, zh, were gradually developed the younger initial sounds
k', t', p', ts', and k, t, p, s, ts, sh. ' The sonants g, d, b, z, are the old letters ; the surds
k, t, p, s, are more recent ; f and h seem to be the newest of all ' [ib. p. 82). Further
on he observes (p. 83) that ' final letters will drop off, through laziness in enunciation,
through imitation of the defects of others, and from the circumstance that, when stress
is laid by the speaker on some one element of sound, the other elements will suffer '.
The feeling for euphony may also have something to do with it.
Sumerian presents a general agreement with these phenomena. We find there,
as final sounds, g, d, b, n, m, ng, and the vowels ; e.g. GIN, walk, DIM, like, DAG,
stone, GUN, tribute, DIB, take, GIN and MEN, pronoun ist pers., GA and DA,
milk, GUG, GU, speak, MUD, blood, GUB, stand, SHAB, heart, ME, liquid, BAD,
open, SIM, call, BI, that, LI, in, into. The sound ng is perhaps heard in KINGI,
land, country, which may be really a compound of KIN, earth, land, and GI (perhaps
NGI), a synonym of KI {see C. T. xii. 38); in MUNGA, MUNGAR, property,
goods (Br. 1292 sq.), which need not be regarded as forged on the basis of the
Semitic makkuru ; in SANGU, priest, which so curiously resembles the Chinese



INITIAL AND FINAL SOUNDS, ETC 9
s6ng, priest ; in SANGU, the name of the character for SAG, head ; perhaps in
KI.AG, pronounced KI.ANG(?), to love; and certainly in SHANGA, one of the
sounds of the character SHAG, SHAGGA {i.e. SHANGA?), bright, pure (Br.
7285). A character like ^l with the values SUM, SUN, SIG (SIG-GI, SIG-GA),
suggests the existence in Sumerian of a nasalized G, equivalent to the Chinese ng
and it is a remarkable fact that this SUM (dialectic SEM or ZIM ? Br. 4202) means
to give, and is thus equivalent to the Chinese sung and shang; G. 9735 ; 10463.
The surds, as finals in Sumerian, appear to be of much later origin : c/. AKA,
love, beside AG; UTU, sun, day, beside UD, UG ; ITU, ITI, moon, month, from
GUD, GID, ID, bright; UG, people, country, C. T. xii. 27, beside UKU, S^' 246.
Final p hardly occurs at all in Sumerian, except perhaps in the proper name PAP
SUKAL, from an older BABSUKAL.
The oldest initials also are practically identical in the two languages. In
Chinese, as far back as we can go, these were g, d, b, ng, n, m, 1, z, dz, zh, and the
vowels: compare the Sumerian words GIN, GI, reed, stem; GAB, breast; GAN,
garden ; DUG, sweet, good ; DUB, tablet ; BAD, open ; BA, give ; NA, NE, that
NIM, high; MUSH, serpent; LAG, offering; LUD, LUTU, a vessel; ZI. right;
ZUN, many, all ; AB, ocean; IB, region, district ; UB,clo.; AN, high, heaven ; EN,
high, lord ; UN, dwelling-place ; UG, U KU, country, people. That initial G was some
times nasalized in Sumerian as in Chinese (ng), may be inferred from the compound
KI.BI.GAR, province, satrapy, which is also written KI.BI-IN.GAR, i.e. KI.BI.
NGAR. Cf. also the term DI.GIR, god, king, side by side with DI-IN-GIR, i.e.
DI.NGIR, which is clearly connected with the old Turkish i^jS^i tengry, God,
transcribed in Chinese by t'ang-li : see G. 735. (The dialectic DI.MER proves that
DINGIR is a compound.)
The sounds dz, ts, are hardly traceable in Sumerian ; but zh may be regarded
as the transitional sound between Z and SH, in cases like ZI, life, and the later SHI.
The aspirate k' maybe compared with the Sumerian spirant G in GUD, to shine,
from an older GUD ; t', p", cannot be traced. K, t, p, s, sh, are common initials in
Sumerian; e.£'. KUM, flame; KUN, to shine; KAN, KA, gate; KUD, cut off,
decide ; KALA, high, exalted, costly ; TUD, to beget, to bring forth ; TAB, double ;
companion; TIN, TIL, TI, live, life; TAG, to break, evil; PAR, bright; PAD,
PA, call, speak; PIL, to burn; SAM or SHAM, price; SUM, SIG, SI, to give;
SIL, to cut through; SAR, SAG, to write; SHU, writing, the scribe's art; SHU,
hand; SHAG, bright; SIG, green; SIG, to beget; SIM, call, name, proclaim;
SHUM, kill, slay; SHEN, copper (from SHUN; Assyrian shinnti). Chinese
scholars will at once recognize all or most of these words (see Lex. s. vv,).
As final sounds Sumerian also employs R, L, and Z, S, SH. To take the last
first, Z occurs in GAZ, smite, kill; GUZ, a bond, and BUZ, a title of the goddess
Damkina; LI. LIZ, a ring (?) ; NU.NUZ, offspring; (the last two perhaps from



lo INITIAL AND FINAL SOUNDS, ETC.
LIZ. LIZ, NUZ.NUZ ;) and a few other instances. In Chinese this final Z (s)
reappears as t, so far as we can trace it; e.g. GAZ, to smite, is gat, kat, now hai, to
injure ; GUZ, a bond, is kit, kieh, to bind ; IZ, GAZ, fire, is gat, kat, ka, ho. The final
S is doubtful, as the writing is ambiguous. (MES, male, hero, might equally well
be transcribed MEZ, S^ 120; and SUS.LUG, to be bright, might be SUZ.LUG,
Br. 7209.) The final L has sometimes displaced an older N, as appears from TIL, TI, and DIN, TIN, live; GAL, GUL, GIN, DILI, DIN, male, man; MEL and
MUNU, flame, flash; SHU.DUL and SHU. DUN, yoke; SHUL and DUN, to
dig; cf, the interchange of initial N, L, in NU, LA, not. (LA need not be derived
from the Semitic Id. It may be dialectic, like f^ I, NI, LI, in Sumerian,
or i, li, fiyi, G. 3354, in Chinese.) Kindred terms in Chinese suggest that
this may have happened in other instances, such as DA. GAL, DA.MAL, broad,
wide; where GAL, MAL, may be assumed to represent an older GAN, MAN,
corresponding to kwan, fun, H. kon, fon, J. kan, broad ; G. 6382. So GA(L),
MAL, house, from GAN, MAN, will be equivalent to the Chinese |^ kwan, kiin,
kon, kiie, kou, a residence, G. 6353, and cognate with EN, E, house (from GAN),
which so strongly resembles J*' yen, fm, ng^n, J. gen, gon, roof, shelter, G. 13 148
(R. 53 : from ngam, ngan), and with ^ an, am, ang, 6, ein, hut, cottage, G. 50. So,
again, Chinese analogy suggests that the Sumerian DUL, DU, mound {tilu. Tell),
was originally DUN = tun, do, J. ton, A. doun, an artificial mound; a tumulus;
G. 12205 ; and that GUL, joy, rejoice, sprang from GUN = hin, y^n, J. kin, kon, joy,
rejoice; G. 4571 {cf. KUN, to be bright, to shine, y^". to be cheerful, glad).
Often, however, and perhaps most frequently, a Sumerian final L is represented
by Chinese t: thus we have BAL (a character which has also the value BUL), to
draw up water = pa, pat, J. bat-, Korean pal; G. 8527 ; BAL, pour out water = p'o,
p'ut, p'at, p'wak, K. pal, A. bat, bak, G. 9428 ; BAL, pudendum muliebre ; coire = po,
p'at, K. pal, A. bat, wife, G. 9384; BAL, rebel, oppose, resist; battle; combat = po,
put, A. bout, disobedient, rebellious, G. 9356 ; po, put, pat, bah, K. pal, A. bat, to walk,
to travel, to traverse, G. 9386 = BAL, to travel, march, proceed {see the other
equivalents of BAL; Lex. p. i^f). The Sumerian LIL, wind, storm-wind, blast,
agrees with lieh, lyt, lih, (K. yol), violent gust, squall, G. 7090 ; and LUL, bad,
rebellious, with lieh, lut, lih, K. yol, G. 7101 ; while LAL, to take, to seize, may be
equated with la, lat, lak, (K. nal, J.nat-si, A. lat), to seize, to carry off, G. 6655 and
Wells Williams. In numerous cases the final t has disappeared in Chinese, though the
phonetic use of the character proves that it was formerly present : e.g. lo, K. ra, and
na, J. ra, A. la, a bird-net; to spread out ; to arrange ; G. 7291, was once lat, P. 1031 ;
so agreeing with the Sumerian LAL, a net ; to lay out, extend, spread out or over.
A Sumerian final L sometimes represents a prior S (SH) ; as in (G)ISH, ISHI, MIL (= MISH), dust; DISH and perhaps DIL, one; GASH, ESH, and GA(L), MAL, house; GISH and GIL.DAN, ear; "^ read DEL (= DISH) and LISH.



INITIAL AND FINAL SOUNDS, ETC. it
Like D, L, R, and Z, this final S is represented by Chinese t, as we have already
seen (pp. 5, 6, \osupr.). In other instances it interchanges with R, as in GIL, IL, to
lift, from OUR, also read GA (from GAR), to lift ; cf. also GAL, to lift.
R
is the commonest final in Sumerian as we have it, involving over 150
instances. It may have arisen from final S (of which about 50 examples remain); or
the contrary may have happened ; but the former seems more probable. However
that may be, we find the same character ]^ read DUR and TUSH, in the sense to
dwell; »Jf- is read BAR and MASH in a great variety of meanings ; *-^f TUR is
to set, of the sun, and so is ^ SHUSH (C. T. xii. i) ; Jlldf, the dog-symbol, had the
sound GISH as well as UR (= GUR = GUSH = GISH) and DISH, SUR, TASH
and TAN, LIG, and LI ; ]} <\^, to weep, is both IR or ER and ESH ; t^i is both
GIR (KIR) and BISH (PESH). As already stated, final R is properly represented
by a Chinese t, though k has often taken its place : e.g. BAR, PAR, bright, white,
written with the sun-symbol, has become in Chinese ^ po, pak, bak, written with the
sun-symbol slightly modified. (Yet cf. po, p'a, ba, ba-t, white, G. 9370; P. 840.)
Similarly, BAR, brother, is represented by po, ba, pak, father's elder brother, eldest
brother, G. 9340; and UR-BAR, leopard, panther, or the like (written dog + BAR),
survives in pao, pau, boa, pio, bau, panther, leopard, formerly bak (P. 41), written
with R. 153, probably once identical with the dog-character, and P. 41.
The Mongol has no z, but has preserved final 1 and r, as in k'ul, foot, Chinese
kio, kok, kiok, G. 1362 = Sumerian GIR (but Mongol gar, hand, is Sumerian GAD)
k'ara, black, Jap. kuroi, Turkish kara = Chinese kek, Sumerian GIG ; Mongol ger,
house = Sum. (GASH), ESH, or GA(L) : ger-te, in the house = Sum. GA.TA
Mongol ger-el, light = Jap. akari. Sum. GAR {cf. Jap. siro, shiroi, white = Sum. SIR,
SHIR, light, bright) ; Mongol mori, horse = Sum. GUR, MUR. ' From kak, black ',
says Edkins, ' came k'ara in Mongol and kuroi in Japanese, the final k being lost in
both cases. The r . . . is merely a phonetic addition.' It is rather difficult to believe
this, in face of the Sumerian evidence, which is far more ancient than either Chinese
or Mongol. All that can be said is that forms with final R and G appear to have
existed side by side : SAR and SAG, to write ; GAR and GAG, to make {cf. AG,
to make, C. T. xii. 10); SHIR and SHAG, SIR and SIG, bright; .^ read DUG,
flow, and SHAR, abound; *^^^]} read SIG (or DIG) and DIR, sorrow; cf. ZIR,
sorrow, Br. 2366 ; ^^ SIG and SAR, green, C. T. xii. 49 ; Jgf read DUR and
T(D)UG. This established equivalence or permutation of the final sounds R and G
seems to account for the not uncommon instances in which Chinese final k (g) appears,
where we should have expected the normal t, in correspondence with a Sumerian r.
Initial r is quite modern in Chinese {see Wells Williams's Diet. s.v. yung, p. 1146).
In Japanese it regularly takes the place of a Chinese 1. It is doubtful whether
it originally existed in Sumerian, although the remains of the language, which
belong to different periods of time, present about a score or so of instances. c2



12 INITIAL AND FINAL SOUNDS, ETC.
In some of these, R evidently occupies the place of an earlier D : thus the
character ^ RU, to build, make, was also read DU in the same sense; and
^^y^to butt, thrust with the horns, was read both DU and RU. Now this Sumerian
initial R = D appears in Chinese as d : ^ chu, chuk, G. 2677, from t'uk (G. 10057),
do-k (P. 929), to butt, is obviously identical with Sumerian DU (from DUG), to
butt ; and ^ tsao, ts'ou, K. cho, A. tau, to build, make, create, from dzok, tok (P. 766),
is as obviously akin to the Sumerian DU, to build, make, create. (It may be
inferred from GAG, the other value of the sign ^, which was also read DA, RA,
in Semitic writing, that DU, RU, and the possibly more original DA, RA, have
lost a final G, corresponding to the k of the old Chinese dzok, tok.) These two
examples are clear and convincing. Others which, though less certain, are possible
and even probable, are the following:— *— RU, in, = ^>^ DU, in ; ^ ^ yu, at,
from tot (P. 392) ; >^] RA, to walk, go, also read DU (from DUG? c/.^} LA6,
to go), answering to ^ lai, K. re, J. rai, to come, from la-k, da-k (P. 409) ; -yy<y RI,
DI, to shine (from DIG = DUG = GUG in UGUG, Br. 6097) ; r/ Ch. yi, A. tik, blaze,
bright light, G. 13183 ; also i, F. ik, sik ( = tik), A. juk, bright, G. 5504; and i, yik,
Amoy ik, OS. tik, kik(P. 254), bright, dawn, G. 5502, and also Sumerian UG (GUG),
day, C. T. xii. 6, and perhaps MAR-DUG, Son of Dawn or Day (= chou, teu, OS.
tok, daylight, G. 2475).
In some examples initial R interchanges with L (=D); e.£: in the instance
quoted above, RA(G), to go = LA6 ; c/. Ch. lu, K. J. ro, a road, from lo-k, la-k,
P. 272. The Sumerian LAG is also to drive off cattle or captives ; to plunder = Ch. lo,
J. ro, to take captive, to plunder, G. 7285, from lo-k, P. 917, and Ch. liieh, lok, liak,
J. riaku, to capture people, to drive off cattle, G. 7564. In ^ RAG, LAG, female, L
is probably prior to R; c/. the character "^yyy SI. LAG (written LAG.SI): see D. 328.
We saw that an initial G or its equivalent often interchanges dialectically or
otherwise with a labial sound. In GI, DISH, one; GAR, DAR, fetter; GA, DA, milk; GIN, GIM, DIM. TUM, to walk; GIN, DIN, male; GAG(AG), DA, DU, to make; GIN, TUN, axe; GE, DE, shekel; GUG, GU, DUG, to speak; we see
a transition from G to D, characteristic of the softer dialect. It is like a young child
saying 'dot' for 'got' or 'dun' for 'gun' —a substitution of sounds with which
every one is familiar in our own language. This phenomenon reappears in Chinese,
the sonants g, d, being represented, as usual, by the surds k, t ; compare kun, ruler,
G. 3269, P. chiin, with tien, dien, J. ten or den, to rule, G. 11 180; k'wang, gwoiig,
mad, G. 6409, with tien, die, A. dien, mad, G. 11 197. Instances abound: such are
kan and tan, dawn ; kien and t'ien, heaven ; kan, kom, and t'ien, t'ym, sweet ; kiin,
G. 3145, and t'sin, ch'in, t'en, G. 2081, to love ; kien, kin, a bolt or bar, and tien,
tfm, to bar a gate ; besides a number of Phonetics like kit, tit, P. 9 ; kut, tut, P. 16 ;
kam, tam, P. 62 ; tik, gik, P. 78 ; gip, sap (= tap), P. 97 ; gik, dik, P. 106 ; kim, tim,
P. no; gat, dat, P. 186; ngim, dim, P. 379; ngak, lak, shak, P. 978; and many



INITIAL AND FINAL SOUNDS, ETC. 13
others. Such equivalences may justify the surmise that the Chinese k'in, k'im, djing,
birds, stands in the same relation to the Sumerian SHEN, TIN, in MU-SHEN,
MU-TIN, bird. (The MU or WU in this compound is probably the labialized pro
nunciation of GU, bird.)
To a philologist there is nothing strange in the mutual equivalence or inter
change of obviously related sounds, such as b, p, f, m, v, or m, n, ng, or d, t, s, z, all of
which find ample illustration in the Chinese dialects. A transition from n to s, z, sh,
or zh, may appear more remarkable, if not altogether incredible. But, as I pointed
out many years ago, this very feature is as characteristic of Chinese as of the
Sumerian language. The ninth of the ' Ten Stems ', ^, zen, great, pronounced nin
by the Japanese, nyem in Annam, and zing, zang, dialectically, is evidently a close
parallel to the Sumerian »"yyyy NUN, ZIL (^from ZIN), SIL (SIN), great; and, to
clinch the comparison, the two characters were originally identical (Sign-list, No. 35).
This is a specially interesting example for the general thesis of the present work
on the following grounds. The character -^ nin, zen, is immediately connected with
the character J^ shi, zit, R. 33, P. 28 a, in the Chinese lexicons (Radical Index).
The meanings of the latter symbol are male, man, husband, warrior, officer, minister
(of State); see Legge, Shi king, vol. II, index iii. But these meanings are virtually
identical with those of the Sumerian character t]f]f|| NIR, NUR, SHER, which
consists of doubled »"|yyy NUN ; see C. T, xii. 24 and 30 ; D. 73 and D. 43 ; Br.628off.
S'' 129; 130. {See also Lex. s.v. NIR, SHER.) And the Chinese J; shi is a
natural simplification of the Sumerian symbol, which is its obvious prototype ; see
Sign-list, No. 36.
Another clear instance of the same transition of sound in both languages is seen
in the Sumerian '^^J NIN, lord, lady = i^ SHIN, also written >^yy^y phonetically
(Br. 9949 ; 9967 ; 2 R. 59.29 ab) ; a word which was probably of the same origin as
^yy^ GIN and ^ DIN, male, man, and (to say the least) strongly resembles the
Chinese ^ zen, nyin, J. djin, nin, man, woman, lady {Shi king). See R. 9 ; G. 5624,
Other Sumerian examples are >-][^ NA, SHA, C. T. xii. 10; ^^J NA, SHA;
XS^ NA, ZA, SI ; "^^ NAD, SHAD ; fclfe NAG, SHAG ; ^Jt NAR = ^^
SAR, *^ SUR, or SHAR, SHUR, C. T. xii. 40; .-y<y^ NAM, SIM; ^^ NI,
ZAL ; and the pronominal t^^^y NE, t^I NI, ][| ZA, >-*^yy ZU. Cf. also perhaps
^ NU (from NUG ?), flesh = ::;^>-< U-ZU (from ZUG ?), flesh, in the meta
phorical expression >:f-'^X^^^^ NU-NU-NE, 'this on€s fleshes,' i.e. his blood
relations (compare G. 5665).
Lastly, the equivalence of initial sounds which we see in Sumerian E0 BAR,
SHAR, .-( BAD, TIL, <^ BAD, PAD, SHUG, ^"i^ BAR, DAG, ZA, Xm} BAR,
DAG, -^ BUR, SIR, JJ PIG, SIG, has its parallel in the Chinese pi, ti, G. 8981,
pi, hse, G. 8986, pit, pi, tet ( = >-< BAD, BE, TIL!), G. 8994, pik, sik, tik, G. 9027,
and other instances of the same kind.



THE CHINESE CLASSIFICATION OF WRITTEN CHARACTERS AND THE SUMERIAN PARALLELS OR PROTOTYPES
There is a curious parallel between the use of the Chinese script by the Japanese
and Annamese and the use of the primitive Sumerian script by the later Semitic
population of Babylonia and Assyria. It is well known that every Sumerian
character represents a word, and that there is a double use of these characters in
Semitic writing ; where for the most part they represent mere syllables without
regard to their original meaning, but also and often they are used ideographically,
to suggest the idea or meaning of the Sumerian word ; in which case a Semitic
equivalent is substituted in reading the sentence in which the Sumerian symbol
occurs. Precisely so, in Japanese, a Chinese character may stand for a mere
syllable, or it may represent an idea, in which case it will be read, not as a Chinese
monosyllable, but as a Japanese word of the same meaning, which may very likely be
polysyllabic. Thus the Chinese -^ ch'ang, 'long', may be written in a Japanese
sentence to express the same idea, but it will be read nagai, which is the Japanese
word for 'long', just as the Sumerian V"^ GID would be read arku in an Assyrian
sentence. In Annamese the Chinese characters, variously modified, are mostly used
as mere syllables or indications of sounds ; with which may be compared the use of
the Sumerian script in ordinary (syllabic or so-called phonetic) Assyrian writing.
Chinese writing has undergone little change during the past two thousand years.
Its beginnings are lost in the mists of antiquity. Native legend ascribes the invention
of it to Fuh-hi, the founder of the monarchy, whose date is variously given as
B.C. 2952-2837 (Williams), 2953-2838 (Giles), 2852-2738 (Mayers), and who is
fabled to have been conceived 'by the inspiration of Heaven'. After twelve years'
gestation he was born at Ch'eng Ki, in the region of Hwa Sii (near the modern
Singan Fu). From his capital Ch'en (the modern K'ai-feng Fu), he instructed the
people in the arts of hunting, fishing, and pasturage. Before his time they were
like beasts, clothing themselves in skins, and eating raw flesh ; knowing their mothers
but not their fathers, and pairing without decency. One day a ' Dragon-horse ' rose at
his feet from the waters of the Yellow River, and presented to his gaze a scroll upon
its back inscribed with mystic diagrams. From these, and from the movements of the
heavenly bodies (5^^ note, p. 15), he devised the system of written characters, with which
he superseded the method of keeping records by means of knotted cords (which must have
been something like the Peruvian quipos). After forming the six classes of characters



THE CHINESE CLASSIFICATION OF CHARACTERS 15
{luh shti), he invented the system of horary and cyclical notation, and regulated the
seasons. He established the laws of marriage, and made lutes and lyres {k'in sefi). He
discovered the arts of metallurgy, and had a female associate or 'sister' called Nii-kwa
(Nli-kwa shi). Evidently Fuh-hi (the ancient sound of whose name would be some
thing like Bok-ki or Bak-ki : see P. 276 and P. 1006) was a Culture-hero, like the
Sumerian Fire-god BIL-GI (BAL-GI), the later GI-BIL, with his companion-goddess
NIN-KA-SI, and the Hebrew (Tu)bal-cain (Gen. iv. 22), with his sister Naamah or
No'oma, and VolcanuSj the Italian god of fire and metallurgy.
But Chinese tradition upon such a subject as the invention of writing is
naturally not uniform. The story is also told that, in the time of Hwang-ti, the
third successor of Fuh-hi, a minister named Ts'ang-hieh elaborated the art of forming
written characters by imitating the footprints of birds on the sand ; upon which basis
he produced five hundred and forty characters. Other accounts are that Ts'ang-hieh
first conceived the idea of forming characters from observing the appearance of a
certain constellation,' the marks on the shell of a tortoise, and the print of a horse's
foot; or that, having ascended a mountain overlooking the river Loh, he beheld a
mysterious tortoise rising out of the waters and displaying the marks on its back,
which enabled him to * lay bare the permutations of nature, and to devise a system of
written records' (Mayers, p. 228).
Leaving these legendary fancies, which belong really to the realm of Mythology,
we arrive at something which may be historical in the account of Pao-shi, a scholar
who flourished under Ch'eng-wang, the second ruler of the Chou Dynasty (i 1 15 b. c).
Pao-shi is considered the Father of Letters, and his work entitled Luk-shu (' The Six
Scripts') has been a standard to which all subsequent ages have referred. It is there
affirmed that nine-tenths of the Chinese characters were of ' hieroglyphic ' or pictorial
origin ; and that the primitive shapes of the symbols were gradually lost, owing to
abbreviation for the sake of convenience or addition for the sake of appearance.
Comparison of the old forms of the Chinese characters with the primitive Babylonian
symbols had led me to much the same conclusion long before I became acquainted
with Pao-shi's views as interpreted by the illustrious Morrison. Following the latter,
we may here enumerate the six classes of * writing ' or written characters, called in
Chinese Shu; a term which appears to be identical with the Sumerian SHU,
' writing', ' the scribe's art ', Assyrian dupsarriKu (Br. 8673). They are
(i) Hing-siang, ' forms (and) images ' ; i. e. pictorial characters or ' hieroglyphs '.
These in the ancient forms with which we are chiefly concerned, are rude outlines of
visible objects. Thus sun, moon, mountain, fish, ox, dog, are represented by outline
pictures of the things themselves or of characteristic parts of the same. (This is as
truly the case in Sumerian as it is in Chinese. Thus the ox is represented in both
' Or constellations ? Cf. the Babylonian phrase 'writing of heaven' i^itir laml ; h'tirti hmdmi), as a description (astrological ?) of the constellations.



i6 THE CHINESE CLASSIFICATION OF CHARACTERS
by a horned head, and the dog by an upliftedforepaw—a highly characteristic gesture
of the animal. Similarly, in Sumerian, an udder represents a she-goat.)
(ii) Chi-ssu, ' Pointing out something ' ; characters indicating local or numerical
conditions, such as I (the supposed original form of J^) ' above ' ; or one stroke
for the numeral ' one ', two strokes for ' two ', which we find also in Sumerian. (Giles
renders the designation of this class ' Indicative or self-explaining characters '.) Few
characters are assigned to this class.
(iii) Hwui-i, ' Combined meanings ', or ' Suggestive Compounds ' (Giles) ; char
acters composed of two symbols belonging to Class (i), both of which contribute to
the suggestion of the meaning without reference to the sound. Among the instances
given are ^ ming; ' brightness ', composed of Q sun and ^ moon together, a parallel
to which may be recognized in the Sumerian group ^J ^*^y ^I^ff^ K]^ ^D, 'bright',
composed of •^J sun and "J^I^^^]^ a title of the moon-god; -^ (antique /^fl)
to follow, composed of two men {f\ man), one behind the other; ^^ good faith, which
is a compound of '\ man and s" word, implying that man is naturally honourable ;
^
warrior, composed of ]^ to stop and "^ weapons (which the warrior stops or
repels). There are plenty of examples of this kind of ideogram in Sumerian ; such
are fl^^^y "'^JTT enemy, composed of X^^^^ fi'*'e and ^JTT throw, ^^-'^^^ evil, hostile,
compounded of {^*- eye and J]tJ dog.
Other instances of Hwui-i or Suggestive Compounds in Sumerian are such as
*^t^]^J prayer, bless, an ideogram appropriately composed of *"^^]y[ KA, mouth, and
^J SHU, hand, the two organs concerned in the action denoted [see D. 198) ; >-^]^
drink, composed of >-£:][*-y mouth and Jy water (D. 205) ; *"t:]^J eat, composed of
»-w^*-y mouth and ^ food (D. 203) ; <y»-][^ old, composed of <y^ eye and J^ meal
{cf. D. 249 c, D. 469)—a reference to the defective sight characteristic of old age
(Gen. xxvii. i), and to the white specks or white surroundings of the cornea (arcus
senilis) which cause it ; ^^][P^f dead, which in cuneiform coincides with the character
for wall (BAD), but in the primitive linear form is composed of EZEN./m^^, and
DINGIR, _^<?^; a clear indication that the old Sumerians, like the Chinese, regarded
the dead as ' gods ' (D^"^7N) or spirits to whom feasts or sacrificial offerings were due
at stated times or anniversaries (D. 364 and 367; Br. 4383 f; 431 1); i^ »-\ Law,
composed of ^ stylus and *~>^ God or Heaven, as though to suggest that laws were
' written with the finger of God ' ; t:^ abundance, which no longer looks like a com
pound ideogram in its cuneiform shape, but in the ancient linear form is a vessel on
a stand {see Sign-list, No. 51); *^yy5^ "^ a slave, composed of •piyyt^ head {i.e.
individual) and ^ woman {see Lex. s.v. ER, ERI slave); ^^'\ waste, steppe, desert^
open country, which has become pu^ breast and ^\ warrior in cuneiform, but appears
to be composed of the signs for milk, light, and place in the linear character {see
D. 427 f; cf. D. 417; 15; 254); perhaps referring to the sunny pastures of the
wilderness. In this last instance we have an example of the tendency to make the



AND THE SUMERIAN PARALLELS 17
cuneiform disguises of the old pictorial symbols suggest something to the eye, even
if it be something entirely different from the import of the original characters. The
immediate significance of the primitive ideograms was inevitably obscured in the process
of their gradual transformation from linear figures to more or less broken groups of
arrowy lines and curves ; but in some cases at least these new groups have been so
arranged as to suggest a combination of other and simpler cuneiform characters. The
like tendency to invest altered forms with a new suggestiveness, and so to make
what has become non-significant again significant, accounts for many of the variations
of the old Chinese characters.
A remarkable example in Sumerian is *-I^]f ^^^^, the pig-symbol, now com
pounded of t-^f ITI or ITU, moni/i, and t-}}}} NIR, SHER, /ord or /lero; an
apparent allusion to DUMUZI, Tammuz, the god after whom the fourth Baby
lonian month was named, and to whom the pig (wild boar) was sacred in legend {see
PSBA. xvi. 198-200). But in all probability neither this nor the closely related
character ^^y|f^ D U N, ^t* dig, had anything to do originally with the symbol X^^^ which
is an element in the cuneiform equivalents of both. Already, indeed, the oldest forms
of the two ideograms known to us at present have assimilated their lower segments to
the linear shape of this character {cf. D. 18 and D. 250 c. D. 73), but the upper segment
is still unexplained ; and analogy suggests that the linear form of 'J^^f t^^fllnf SHAG,
SHIG, SIG, wild boar, swine {cf. the old Chinese shik, pig), originally figured the
head of a boar with tusks and mane, while ^ft^fl^ DUN, /i? dig, like the corresponding
Chinese word and symbol, is a modified form of the swine-symbol based on the
animal's well-known characteristic of rooting up the ground. See Sign-list, Nos.
71 and 72, and Lex. s.v. DUN, to dig; SHAG, SHIG, swine; and KISH, a swine,
answering to Chinese ki, ki-t, the so-called ^2^5 head, Rad. 58, which is curiously like
the top of the two Sumerian characters in their oldest accessible forms.
For other striking examples of this kind of novel conversion or perversion of
ancient pictograms, see p. 25 infra.
(iv) Hiai-shing or Hing-shing, ' Agreeing sounds ' or ' Figuring sounds ', i, e.
Phonetic characters. We have here a very extensive class of signs, both simple
and compound, the principle of which consists in the borrowing of a word-symbol
already in use, to become the symbol (or part of the symbol) of another word
of like sound but (generally) different meaning. There are in Chinese about
1040 principal Phonetics (also called Primitives), by the union of which with the
214 Radicals or generic Determinatives the great mass of the characters has been
formed.
Thus in ^ kiang, ' river ', we see the Radical or Generic Determinative »J shut,
' water ', with X ^^^ng, ' work ', added as a Phonetic to suggest the sound (originally
kong, kom : P. 27). In ^ ho, ' river ', the Phonetic is "pj' k'o, ' may ', ' can ', indicating
that ho, 'river', was formerly io. (Both words were originally ka-t or ga-t : P. 145.)



i8 THE CHINESE CLASSIFICATION OF CHARACTERS
It is evident from these examples that the Phonetic may play an important part in
enabling us to determine the older sounds of a Chinese word.
There is practically no limit to the possible multiplication of characters by this
ingenious device, the credit for the extended use of which must be assigned to the
Chinese themselves, although it may have been originally suggested by such
Sumerian analogies as ^Jp<|
' BAD, 'wall', 'fortress', where >—< BAD appears to be
used as a Phonetic giving the sound ; "J^Jtll NIG, ' bitch ' {/emale + dog), in which JT*-!
LIG seems to stand for NIG; ^yy T>->-IlT MEN, 'crown', diadem', where the inserted
y>- *-J][ ME-EN is certainly phonetic and, moreover, spelled out phonetically; "j!?-^.'*'
GIN, GEM, 'bondmaid', in which V" GIN may be phonetic; ^J I^^J U6, 'spittle',
'venom', where ^J UG indicates the sound of the compound ideogram {see D. 235
for the archaic form of the character). Similarly, the ancient form (D. 354) suggests
that in J^^^^ DUR, 'all', t?: DU-R may be phonetic; and in Jgf DUR(?),
'marsh', 'swamp' (also read SUG, SHUG), the sound DUR is possibly indicated by
^ DUR. The eye-symbol {[>- BAD (C. T. xi. 2) is phonetic and seems to suggest
both sound and sense in <y>-'^JTT. BAD, ' to see ',
' to choose ' ; a compound sign
which is then itself used phonetically for BAD or PAD, ' to call', 'speak', 'swear',
&c., thus becoming an instance of the Sixth Class (Kia-Tsi6, ' Borrowed Characters '
g. v). The symbol \^ GIG, ' dark', is in like manner both phonetic and significative
in ^^^^A, GIG, 'sick', ' sickness ', written darkness—offspring (see D. 264; 283);
alluding to the demons, children of night or darkness, which were supposed to cause
disease—possession by which, in fact, was disease. The character ^yf I, NI, DIG,
ZAL, appears to be phonetic in fi^^ I, NA, DAG, ZA, 'stone', both parts of which
latter ideogram, indeed, indicate that stone is a shining substance (see D. 322).
Lastly, »-»f- AM, AN, AG (ang?), may be regarded as phonetic in yffj AMA,
AGA, (vid. Lex. s.v. KGh-R\]<i, parent).
Examples of this class of written characters are comparatively rare in Sumerian,
because a more or less syllabic writing already prevails in most of the texts that have
come down to us ; so that any inscription of Ur-Nina or Gudea will afford instances
of the same character used sometimes as an ideogram with its original meaning, and
sometimes as a mere syllable : while other texts present us with such complete
syllabic spellings as U-MU-UN for UMUN, ' lord', and DA-MU for D AMU, 'child',
' son ' (e. g. the Tammuz-hymns, C. T. xv). Chinese never attained this degree of
freedom in the use of the written character, which was perhaps due to the ingenuity
of Semitic scribes and, in any case, is not primitive.
In Sumerian, as is well known, a simple pictorial character like 71 . (cuneiform
fc^J), an outline of the human foot, stood for a number of different words and
meanings. Read GIN, it has the diverse meanings to walk and io establish, set up.
In Chinese GIN is preserved as kien, kfn; but kien, to walk, is written |^ and kien,
to establish, is |^, the latter character being used as a Phonetic in the former. J^



AND THE SUMERIAN PARALLELS 19
and ^ are both foot-symbols originally ; a statement which is also true of the other
Radicals which have to do with walking, going, standing or stopping. Such are ^
hing, kiang, OS. ging, io walk (R, 144), which is very common in the Shi in the sense
of going and marching; f ch'i, J.seki, shaku, A. hsik, from t'i-k, 'to walk' (R. 60),
' step with left foot ', and -^ ch'uh, ch'uk, from t'u-k, ' step with the right foot ' ; jj;;^
chi, from ti-k, ' to stop ' (a picture of \}s\t.foot resting on the ground : R. 77 ; Chalmers,
94), so used in the Shi; ^ tsou, K.chu, A. teu, from to-k, 'to walk, go, depart'
(R. 156); -^ ch'o, J.chaku, A. hsok, from t'ok or t'ak, 'going on and stopping' or
'walking' (R. 162). The Shwoh-wen explains J^ (tsuk, tsu, chouk, J.soku, A. tuk),
the character for 'the leg', 'foot', as derived from p k'ou, 'mouth' \cf. Sumerian
K A, ' mouth '], and jj^ chi, ' to stop ', which the character certainly resembles. A
commentator, feeling the difficulty of ' mouth ' in this connexion, says that P here is
a picture of the thighbones ! Tai-tung comes nearer to the truth in stating that J^
is a picture of the knee, leg, ankle, and foot : cf. p with the Sumerian \^ (modern ,^0
DUG, 'knee', for which we find SIB and ZAG dialectically (Br. 4210, 6470). As a
philological fact it is not very remarkable that the sounds DUG, ZAG (= tsuk, tuk)
should mean 'knee' in Sumerian and 'leg' or 'foot' in Chinese. (Indeed, DUG
seems to be used for the whole leg in phrases like DUG-MU AN-TA-TUM-TUMU, 'my knees are moving on'.) What is remarkable is the close correspondence of
dialectical change which they exemplify, supposing that the two languages are not
closely akin to each other. We may here add one other character as in all probability
formed, like those specified above, from the original pictogram for the foot, viz. ^
k'U, from k'u-p (P. 143), 'to go away', although it has come to look like a com
bination of R. 28 and R. 32. It is the Sumerian GUB, 'to take one's stand', 'step',
'walk'. Further, the character ^, yin, ying, J. in, A. jen, 'to move on' (R. 54;
G. 13285), which as mentioned above, and as the old writing shows, is also a foot
character (see List, No. 79, and cf. Morrison, s. v. ^ keen), appears to be phonetic
in ^ kien, kfn, ' to establish ', and therefore probably represents an original sound
gin as well as din (Edkins : R. 54). In Sumerian DIN is a dialectic form of GIN
{see p. 12); and the same interchange of initials is observable in the Chinese ;^j£
ching, chin, from tim (P. 142), ' to go ' = Sumerian DIM (<^jy : also GIM), ' to go ' =
TUM (from DUM), 'to go', which is another value of ^f, the foot-character. With
S. TUM, 'to go', cf. Ch. -^ ts'ung, dzung, chung, A. tung or t'ung, 'to follow'
(G. 12028). We have also in the Shi 1^ t'u, du, 'to go afoot' (= S, t^J DU, 'to
walk'), with ^ Phonetic (tu-k) ; and ^ tsin, tsun, chin, ching, J. shin, A. ten, 'to
advance ', ' go to ', ' enter ', where the bird-character ^ is Phonetic, with the value
tun or tin (P. 472 ; cf. the Sumerian compounds MU-TIN, MU-SHEN, 'bird').
This brief review has shown us that the sounds associated with the foot-symbol
and its modifications in Chinese are mainly kin, ti-k (Japanese shaku), tu-k or tok
(A. hsok ; nearly = shok), t'u, du, k'u-p, tin, tim, tum ; a series which will at once
D2



20 THE CHINESE CLASSIFICATION OF CHARACTERS
recall to the Sumerlan scholar the values of the polyphonic Sumerian foot-symbol
JL^ (modern J^J), viz. GIN, DI, DU, SHA, GUB, DUN, TUM. And we have
seen that the Chinese word for ' leg ', ' foot ', viz. isu^, tsu, ink, is practically identical
with S. DUG, ZAG, ' knee '. To complete the parallelism of the two series, compare
S. J^f RA (from RAG = LAG), 'to walk', 'to go', and HJ or J^J J^J LA6, 'to
walk about', with the Chinese ^ lu, from lok (P. 865), ' road', and xfa lai from lak
(P. 409), ' to come ',
(v) Chuen-chu, ' Inverted' or 'Deflected' characters ; in which a new sound and
a change of sense are indicated by inverting a character, or turning it partly or
completely round. Thus the old form of .^ hill is said to be simply the old form
of [Jj mountain turned up on its right side. This device does not seem to
be very common. It is, however, exemplified in the Sumerian "jL BAN, a bow
(D. 118), which is apparently identical with 'V''^ warrior (D. 173). The warrior is
the bowman : cf. the Egyptian p^^t, ' bow ', and the piddii, ' bows ' or troops, of the
Tell el-Amarna letters. Similarly in Chinese & ping, pin, is both ' soldier ' and
'weapon' (G. 9279). Another Sumerian example of apparent inversion may be seen
in >0v PIG, SIG, ' weak' or 'ill' (D. 256) as compared with ^ (the rising or risen,
sun) 'bright', 'cheerful' (D. 234), The strict suggestion of the former character
seems to be sundown, and so gloom or darkness, which is a natural metaphor for
sickness. (It is also used for SIG, 'down', 'below'.) Mayers understands by the
Chinese name of this class (Chuen-chu, 'Turned Meanings'?) 'Mutable Signifi
cations ', and makes it comprise such characters as ^, which ' signifies ' more than
one sound, viz. tun, tui, tiao and twan. The class would thus consist of polyphonic
symbols, or characters which have more than one value, as is the case with most of
the primitive Sumerian symbols, and with many of the Chinese Phonetics. We saw
that the foot-symbol in Sumerian represents seven or eight different sounds ; and ^\
(\>')the sun-character is even more polyphonic, with its known values GAD, GUD,
UD, UTU, U, U6, UG, GAL, AL, UL, 6a§, GES, 6IS, PAR, BIR, BABBAR (from BAR-BAR), LA, LA6, RA, SAG, TAM, TAN, ZAL, and the compounds
ZA-LAG and PI-RIG (see Br. 7758 fif. ; C. T. xii. 6), besides other values, some of
which are lost owing to fracture of the tablet. It is obvious, however, to remark that
this amazing polyphony of a simple primary character admits of material reduction by
the consideration that many of the sounds are clearly variants of a single root, as may
be more evident if we arrange them thus :
1. (GAD), 6AD, 6AS, GES, GIS, GAL, AL (D = S = L) 6UD, UD, UTU, UL, U (D = T) (GUG), UG, U6, U.
2. (BAR), BABBAR, PAR, BIR; cf. ^ BAR,
' the sun ' ; read M A§, ' bright ',
' to glitter '.



AND THE SUMERIAN PARALLELS at
3. LAG (in ZA-LAG), LA6, LA = (RAG), RA, RIG (in PI-RIG) = SHAG.
4. TAM, TAN, ZAL (from ZAN ?).
But, further, since it is a well-known feature of the two dialects of Sumerian that an
Eme-ku G may correspond to an Eme-sal B or M, and since the interchange of D
(T), R, L, S, Z, is as well known in Sumerian as in Chinese and other languages, we
see that an original GAD (= GAS = GAL, &c.) may be cognate with BAR
(= MA§). The change from the A- to the U- series (6aD, 6UD, UD, &c.) is
not uncommon [e.g. BAR = BUR), and the transition from final -D to final -G
(UD = UG) is also frequent in Sumerian, and finds its counterpart in Chinese : cf.
in the former SUD = SUG, SHED = SHEG, and in the latter the regular
equivalence of Fuhchau -k to Cantonese -t. We may thus bring our series down to
the following sources :
1. GAD (= BAR); 2. LAG (= RAG) = SHAG; 3. TAM (DAM) = TAN
(DAN) = ZAL (ZAN). And since SHAG = SHANG = SHAM = TAM, &c.,
we may reduce our sounds finally to GAD and a cognate DAG.
But leaving for the present this question of ultimate etymologies, let us proceed
to compare the sounds associated with the Chinese character for * sun ' with those
which we have seen to be associated with the corresponding Sumerian character.
Edkins long ago gave nit (= ngit?) and got as the old sounds of g (P. 120), used
as a Phonetic. It represents ^^/ {or gut), and its labialized equivalent mot, dot, in the
character yg ku, mi, C. kwet, mik, K. kol, miok, J. beki, miaku, kot-, A. kuk, mik
(G. 6249). With final -k for -t, these sounds agree generally with those of the
Sumerian series 1 and 2. In the character ^ tan, F. tang (= tarn), 'dawn', 'day',
g
is Phonetic for the sound tan ; in ;}:0 for tarn, tan ; and in ^ ch'ang, tsang,
A. hsong, 'shining', 'bright' (P. 496), it represents tarn, zam. (The last character
consists of p sutt + Q mouth, speak ; see the old forms. This agrees with the
Sumerian ^y •-t:]y ZA, in the compound ^J »-t:y "Jf- ZA-BAR, 'shining', which
is written suti + mouth. ZA-BAR is perhaps for ZAB-BAR, from ZAM-BAR
cf. ZIM-BIR, Sippar, the Sun-city.) See the Sumerian series 4.
It remains to notice that the character Q preserves in its dialectic pronuncia
tions {see Giles, 5642) a number of sounds more or less approximating to those of the
Sumerian sun-character. It must be admitted that ngyit, nyit, nyit, yet {yutt), nyih,
are philologically comparable with 6UD, UD, UTU, U, E (I); that nal (= ngal), il,
resemble GAL, AL, UL; that m6t {mutt), mih, may be related to MAS, and there
fore to its cognates BAR, BIR; that jih, ji', jeh, (zih, zi, z^h), zai, djit-, agree with
ZAL, ZA ; and that nik (nig), jek (pronounced zhuM), may be compared with LAG,
LA6 (LIG), SHAG.
The close equivalence of the sounds associated with the primary characters of
the two languages may be further illustrated not less strikingly by the following
examples :— The Chinese ^ nim, nin, P. go a, as a Phonetic is also ttm, dim, shim :



2ix THE CHINESE CLASSIFICATION OF CHARACTERS
see P. 341 ^ t'ing, P. 373 ^ ch'eng, and P. 886 ^ sheng. Among the dialectical
sounds of this character, which means 'great', are nyim, zing, nin, zen or jen (pronounced
zhunn). Compare the Sumerian ^ (•^TTTT) NUM, NUN, 'great' ; a character which
has also the values ZIL (from ZIN) and SIL (SIN) : see C. T. xii. 30. It is doubled
in t^|^]ff NIR, SHER, male, husband, lord, hero, &c. ; a character and word preserved
in the Chinese -^ shi (zhi-t = zhir, shir), R. 33, in similar senses. The pictogram of
a knife or sword (**^) has in Sumerian the sound-values TAR, GAS, CjAZ, GUG,
KUR, KUD, SIL. The corresponding Ch. character {yj) is read tao, tau, toa, to,
from iat or tot, in agreement with TA-R ; while as a Phonetic it is also kit, kek, and
sit (= KUR, KUD, GUG, SIL) ; see ^ kyt, k'ouk, syt, K. kiol, sol, P. 567 (G. 1053).
[With GUG, cf. ^J k'ek, P. 216 (G. 6099).] The Chinese character for 'dog' {j^
has the Phonetic values li and t'ot (P. 72 ; cf. PP. 462 and 505) ; thus agreeing with
the Sumerian dog-sign (][til), which has the similar values LIG, LI, TAS. (With
TAS, cf. also the Turkish t_i%bi tazy, 'hunting-dog'.) The Chinese Jfj ch'ut, chu, 'to
go out', 'to beget', springs from (ut, and as a Phonetic (P. 207) has also the sound
Hut (in ^ kut, ku, P. 442), like its Sumerian prototype -^J TUD, TUR, TU, GU
(see Sign-list, No. 8).
The Chinese p has the Phonetic values hwei, hui, OS. gut, to go round ; return,
and also kw'un, kin, kon, to surround (R. 31 ; P. 51 a ; cf. G. 5162 f. ; 3307). The
Sumerian Q is read GUD, GUR (= gut), and doubled S it is NI-GIN, to surround.
See D. 449 f. The Chinese pQ has the Phonetic values lu, t'ap, dip, as well as din
(field; cf. E-DIN); .y^^ PP. 793; 881; 985; 1037a. The Sumerian prototype is
read LU, DAB, DIB. See Sign-list, No. 100. The Chinese ^ min, R. 205, as a
Phonetic is also ding, dim (P. 922). It denotes various reptiles; a fly, and a cable
j^ G. 7936; 9886; 13313. The Sumerian symbol read DIM, a cable, is also read
MUN (C. T. xii. 12), denoting worms, caterpillars, some serpents, and the. like {cf.
Br. 331 ; 342; 98). See Sign-list, No. 92. The Chinese :^ instrument of writing,
stylus, has the Phonetic values yut, but, pit, lut (R. 129; P. 252); so agreeing with
the Sumerian 6AD, 6uD, PA (from PAD), BA, MUATI, LU. See Sign-list,
No. loi. The Chinese y~" han, Amoy gan, overhanging or bending over, R. 27, as
a Phonetic is also ngam and ngat (ngot, ngut) ; P. 2 « ; cf. V. 410. The Sumerian
\ GAM, to bow or bend, is also read GUR (ngot). Lastly, the Sumerian fire
symbol has, among other values, the sound KUM, NE, NI, DE, and the derived
Chinese character is kong, kom, in P. 288; nen, in P. 846 (zan, J. zen, nen, kindle,
burn) ; di, in P. 212, P. 352 ; and din, in yen, flame, P. 400. Moreover, the pronoun
ni (G. 82 11) may be modified from the same symbol {Sign-list, Nos. 64; 65). The
other Sumerian values of the fire-symbol (BIL, PIL, BI, PI ; IZ, US, from GIZ,
GUZ, GUS ; GIR; LAM; SHEG, M. 3095 ; ZAG) are now expressed in Chinese
writing by the addition of other Phonetics to the fire-symbol used as a Determinative



AND THE SUMERIAN PARALLELS 23
or 'Radical' (R. 86), Thus we have i)|| p^t, pi (K. pil), A. t^t, fiery; blazing,
G. 8999, written fire + finish (P. 791 pit, pil), in which we hear an echo of the
Sumerian sounds BIL, PIL, BI, PI, and DE. GUZ, GIZ, GISH, IZ, IZI, USSI,
again, are evidently represented by yt, ngiet, zo, zih, ngih, yeh, K. yol, J. net, A.
fiyiet {cf. Sumerian NE = NGE, NI), hot, to heat, G. 5649, and its homophone yt,
ngiet, ziet, nih, &c., to burn, set fire to, G. 5594. Here the fire-symbol as Radical is
combined with P. 744 (ngit, nit, sit), with the addition of the grass-character in the
latter instance. The sound LAM has been treated quite similarly in the Chinese
script {see Lex. s. v. LAM in ME-LAM). The same may be said of ZAG, the sound
of which is heard in tsau, J. so, furnace, fireplace, G. 11625; in tsok, chiok, ziek,
chio, a torch, to kindle, G. 2221, P. 1019 tsak; in tsiu, tsiau, scorched, burnt, G. 1317,
P. 850; and in other words. All this is easily intelligible; and it is needless to
multiply examples of the mode in which originally polyphonic symbols have been
relieved of a great part of their burden of different sounds. But, it may very
naturally be asked, how did it ever happen that so many dissimilar sounds came to
be associated with a single primitive symbol like the Sumerian character for ' fire '
in other words, how did the original characters of Sumerian or Chinese writing
become polyphonic ? Leaving out of consideration merely dialectical changes of
sound, we may reply that a written symbol begins to become polyphonic, when it is
used for some word of different sound but of similar meaning to that which it was
invented to suggest. Thus the use of the characters which originally denoted the
sun and fire was naturally extended to comprehend numerous other words expressing
the ideas of brightness and purity and the modes of their manifestation or production,
(vi) Kia-tsid, ' borrowed characters ' ; as when ^, the character for nu, ' woman ',
is written for j^ j'u (zu), ' thou ', as it often is in the SAi. Giles calls this class of
characters ' Adoptive ', giving the example just cited. Douglas adduces the instance
of ^ sAi, ' an arrow ', used in the sense of ' direct ', ' right ', because of the straight
course of an arrow. Such a use would be ' metaphorical ', in the ordinary sense of
the word. But Edkins distinguishes this class from (iv) Hiai-shing as ' borrowing
without any additional mark', i.e. without appended Radicals. Confucius, for instance,
uses .^ sun ('grandson'), without any addition for ^ siin, siun, 'compliant'; and g^
shi (' time ') is used without alteration for ^ shi, ' this ', in the older classics. Quite
similarly, the Sumerian ^*-, the eye-symbol, is used for SHI, 'land', 'earth', (= KI
Br. 9275), and for SHI, 'ear', and for SHI, 'life', and for SHI, 'this', 'that';
simply because one of its sounds was SHI (probably meaning 'to see'). Another
Sumerian example is *^yy SIG, SI, 'horn', used for JJ SIG, 'weak', 'ill'. Such
cases are numerous both in Sumerian {^d. exx. in Lex.) and in Chinese. In the latter,
as Edkins observes, ' very many abstract terms, verbs, adjectives, and particles, were
supplied on this principle with the required written signs'. It is one of the most natural,
obvious, and probably oldest, devices for the enlargement of the scribe's resources.



24 THE CHINESE CLASSIFICATION OF CHARACTERS
It is evident that Sumerian texts 'phonetically written', i.e. texts in which
compound syllables and words are spelled out, to a greater or less extent, by using
the simple symbols as mere syllabic signs, without reference to their individual
meaning, are a larger application of this 'borrowing' principle. In Kj^^J^Of "-^ t^Jff
u mu — un
^
-^I*"^! Jff^ for UMUN MU-TANA-NI, every single character is used as a mere
mu—tan—na——^ni
index of sound, without reference to its original meaning as an independent Sumerian
word ; and the same, of course, is even more true of ' phonetically written ' Assyrian,
where the simple Sumerian signs are used to express the syllabic sounds of another
language.
From the age of Confucius (sixth century b. c.) downwards, it became more and
more the rule of Chinese writing to transform Kia-tsU characters into Hiai-shing by
the addition of determining Radicals.



PROGRESSIVE TRANSFORMATION OF CHARACTERS
IN SUMERIAN AND CHINESE
The cuneiform Syllabaries or lists of characters are nothing more to the ordinary
eye than a repellent congeries of arbitrary and conventional signs, having no apparent
relation either to the sounds or the meanings intended to be conveyed. In their
cuneiform shape, the originally pictorial symbols have mostly lost all resemblance to
the things they represented at an earlier stage of their existence. Dr. Chalmers
makes a similar observation about the Chinese characters. Eight or nine tenths of
them, he says, are apparently ' nothing more than conventional signs, having no
resemblance to the things, or natural association with the ideas, which they represent '.
Fortunately for us, the archaic linear forms from which the cuneiform characters were
in course of time gradually developed, in many cases preserve a sufficient resemblance
to the original picture-signs to enable us to determine, with a greater or less degree
of certainty, what objects these already conventionalized outlines were intended to
suggest. The cuneiform •^J , for instance, can hardly be called a picture of the sun
but the oldest linear form ^O' (D. 234) approaches considerably nearer to what is
required. Even in this form, which belongs to the fourth or fifth millennium before
our era, the symbol has already a history behind it. The original figure, probably
a circle, has become angular under the stress of sculptural necessities ; and in its
modified shape it seems to suggest the orb of day emerging into sight from between
two peaks (the subject of a well-known seal-intaglio). Cf. the symbol for TUD, 'to
beget', D. 147. The cuneiform *"y<y^ does not inevitably suggest a swallow; but it
is no great strain on imagination to see a bird of some kind in the archaic figure ^[
(D. 42), from which this character has descended by a series of regular changes.
This example demonstrates very clearly how fallacious it would be to explain the
character by the apparent significance of its cuneiform elements. ^-J^J 4^ looks as if it
had been compounded of -y<y bird and V" lucky. But though this may have been
what was intended by the ultimate modification of the character, it is certainly not the
suggestion of the original pictogram. In the same way, the corresponding Chinese
character ^ yen, 'a swallow' (from tan; P. 997), looks like a combination of several
Radicals in the modern writing ; but the old forms suggest the figure of a bird (see
Sign-list, No. 34). With yen, yeng, tan, tam, cf. NAM, SIM, the sounds of the
1101 E



26 PROGRESSIVE TRANSFORMATION OF CHARACTERS
Sumerian symbol. These imply a dialectic NAN, SIN ; cf. the derived Assyrian
sin-utitu, Syriac senii-nttha, ' swallow '. Take, again, the Sumerian *t:yyy^, ' she-goat '.
This now consists of *>^IJ],
' ship ', and iS^ ' road ' ; as if to identify the goat with the
sea (the road of ships), because the sea was mythically a goat {cf. y^ ; and see
PSBA., Feb. 1909). But this curious cuneiform character is not original. It was
only arrived at by successive transformations of the primitive figure tt (D. 51), which
appears to represent the animal's udder. Thus the original linear fig. for an udder,
which suggested the animal to the inventors of the script as naturally as a lifted
forepaw suggested the dog, has become in the cuneiform writing something altogether
different. It shows what changes primitive hieroglyphs or pictograms are liable to
undergo in the course of ages. We are not therefore surprised at meeting with
similar transformations in the history of Chinese writing. The character ^ Hen,
' heaven ', for instance, is explained by the old Dictionary Shwoh-win (a. d. 200) as
composed of —•
' one ' and ^ ' great ' ; which is certainly what the symbol looks like
in its modern shape. But neither this, nor any of the other Chinese explanations, is
correct. When we look at old forms of the character, such as 55 /Hi 0^ ^. we
surely recognize a likeness to the Sumerian /N E-DIM ( = E-DIN), 'heaven';
which seems to figure the arch of the firmament, upheld by a central pillar. {See
D. 278 ; also D. 1 1 /*\ ; a sign with which the former was early confounded.)
To take another instance, the Chinese analysis of -^ ti, K. che. A, de, ' god ',
' emperor ', makes the character a compound of —i— shang, ' above ', and ^ iz'ti, tsek,
A. fik, ' prickle ', ' thorn ',
' to prick ', ' stab ' (G. 1 2410). The latter is then Phonetic
(Chalmers : ' a phonetic in disguise '), indicating that the old sound of the word was
tik. The ancient form of -^ has doubtless been modified in this direction ; but, as
Chalmers points out, the assimilation is not complete (Ch. 189), and Wells Williams
remarks that the composition of the character is obscure. One of the old forms,
however, is )7f\, which at once suggests comparison with the Sumerian ^j^ DIGIR,
DINGIR, DIMER, 'god', 'king'. The Sumerian symbol (an eight-rayed star) was
also read AN, in the sense of' Heaven' ; and there seems to be a relation between
some of the old forms of ^ Hen, ' heaven ', which we gave above, and such forms of
^
ti, ' god ', as !^, ^, and 13^. In any case, it appears probable that the resolution
of "^ into a Radical element and a Phonetic was an afterthought. Our derivation of
the Chinese -^ from the Sumerian star-symbol which denotes 'god', 'king', 'heaven',
may perhaps be confirmed by comparison of ^ ch'in, ts'en, A. t'^n, ' kindred ',
'parents', G. 2081, for which an old form fw\ is given, with the Sumerian group
t\Y^ tfT^ AGA-RIN, dialectically AMA-TUN, which is explained both ' father' and
^ mother ', and may therefore be taken to mean ' parents ' or nearest kin, like the
Chinese term {OS. //» = tun). The oldest forms of the two characters which



IN SUMERIAN AND CHINESE ij
constitute the Sumerian group are ^ AMA (written star inside house', cf. the old
Chinese character) and % GIN, DUN, TUN (C. T. xii. lo). As is often the case,
the old Chinese character retains only the upper part of the ideogram, viz. the sign
AMA. Unfortunately the compound ideogram has not yet been found in any archaic
inscription ; consequently, although the elements composing it are both ancient, we
cannot at present be sure that Cyy^T IF^ has not been evolved out of some single
character. Anyhow, the symbol house + star is found in both languages expressing
the nearest of kin; a fact which can hardly be due to chance coincidence. (The
ancient Chinese o°o. '^ ^^^^^ resembles the Sumerian ^ij^, id., in that both suggest
a group or constellation, or perhaps rather the stars as a whole. The sounds of the
two words are different ; a fact which may account for the inversion of the original
symbol in the Chinese figure.)
The great variety in the modes of writing the Chinese characters exhibited by
different styles and periods—the 'effraenata scripturae licentia' of which Callery
speaks, after giving some astonishing examples of it (pp. 31-34) —rnay be paralleled
to some extent by the changes undergone by the old Sumerian characters in the
course of their transition from the earliest known linear forms to the modern
Babylonian and Assyrian cuneiform symbols. It will be evident that, for our
purposes, all intermediate and fanciful variations may be neglected. We are only
concerned with the antique Chinese (or ku win) and the linear Babylonian characters,
such as those with which we have been dealing. But, unless we are greatly mistaken,
our argument will derive strong support in a multitude of cases from the demonstrable
relationship of the words involved, as well as from that of the characters which
suggest them. When Wang-cKung (a.d. 27-97) argued that ^ kwei, 'a disembodied
spirit ', ' ghost ', ' demon ', really means that which has returned (deriving the word
from ^ kwei, ' to return '), he showed, as Edkins has somewhere truly observed, that
the Tones did not count for much in his etymology, the former word being in the
First Tone, the latter in the Third. Nor need the Tones trouble us. Morrison
quotes from the Luh-shu ku (Diet, of Tai-tung; twelfth cent. A. D.)the statement that
' the doctrine of Tones (Shing-yun) and of the Syllabic spelling was not known in
ancient times ' ; adding that ' the whole of this system, and these nice and, in part,
imperceptible distinctions, are comparatively modern in China ; and a large proportion
of them have been introduced from foreign countries '. See his Diet., vol. i, Pt. I, p. v.
It will not, therefore, be necessary for us to spend any of our time in a futile inquiry
whether Sumerian Homophones were or were not distinguished by differences of
Tone. Possibly, like their Chinese cognates, to some extent they were so dis
tinguished ; but as the question of the etymology of words and the derivation of
characters is but little affected by these subtleties of intonation, we shall take leave to
neglect them altogether. Our objection to Wang-cJiungs ingenious identification of
kwei, ' ghost ', with kzi'ei ' to return ', is based, not on his disregard of the Tones, but
E2



28 PROGRESSIVE TRANSFORMATION OF CHARACTERS
on the real relations of words, which lay quite beyond the ken of Wang-cKung, as of
all the old Chinese philologists. In short, ^ kwei, ' ghost ', the old sound of which
was gu-t (R. 194; P. 684), and its labialized cognates ^ mei, mi (from mi-t), 'ghost'
(G. 7748), ^ mui, mei, mi, 'demon' (G. 7738), find their prototypes in the'Sumerian
and Accadian G A-L, MU-L, ' ghost ', ' demon ' ; while ^ kwei, ' to return ', which also
was anciently gu-t (P, 1020), answers to the Sumerian GUR, GI, 'to return'.
The cuneiform ideogram which is read GAL and MUL in the sense of 'ghost*
or ' demon ' is ^J Y~ ; ^ compound, apparently, of ^J awe or dread and J*" full^
and so a very good instance of a ' Suggestive Compound ' (Class iii). The linear
character, however, being still unknown, we cannot be sure that it was not * a picture
of the fancied shape of a demon ', as the Chinese ^ has been supposed to have been
originally. (Cf. the similar case, p. 26 f.) Still, if we write ^J J*" in linear style, it
will be ^ (cf. D. 217, 440; 218); and some maybe inclined to recognize in this
ideogram the possible original of the ku win figures j^ and ^. It should be noted
that the value GAL of the group "i^l J*" is inferred from galiU, an obvious loan-word,
by which the ideogram is always rendered in Assyrian versions of Sumerian texts
and (2) from MUL, the known Erne-sal va\\x&, which implies a Sumerian equivalent
GAL (GUL). The old Chinese sounds gut, mit, clearly corroborate this inference of
Sumerian scholars.
The pictorial import of the Sumerian mi? ' dark ', ' black ', ' night ', may be
shadows descending from the hollow firmament of heaven ; as though darkness were
something positive which, like rain, falls from the sky {cf. our own expression
'nightfall'). It was read GIG, GE, and MI, as well as GA (cf. the sign-name
GA-GIG). Doubled, it is <:^ <^ KUK-KU (from GUG-GUG ?), 'darkness' {see
C. T. xi. 36). It is evident that GIG (GUG ; GA-G), ' black ', ' dark ', is the Chinese
^
kek (P. 862 ; R. 203), ' black ', ' dark ', now variously read hei, hak, het, haik, hik,
he, Jii, K. hik, J. koku, A. hak ; see G. 3899. It is true that the oldest known form of
the Chinese character already shows traces of the artificial attempts at explanation
which native scholars are fain to substitute for lost knowledge. The ku-wen figure
^
doubtless owes its shaping to the idea that the character was originally a
compound of signs for window and flame, because fire and smoke blacken openings.
But although this false analysis has modified the symbol materially, it has not wiped
out all resemblance to the Sumerian original. The four lines on four survive, though
they are no longer vertical. The Sumerian symbol mi, read GIG and GE, also
meant 'sunset', 'night'; and S^ is used of 'the dark' or dusk of evening and morning.
But ^ ye, 'night', is another offshoot of the same Sumerian original ; although the
old forms have undergone various alterations in the effort to restore significance to
a symbol which had become unintelligible, or to distinguish the different applications
of the primitive character by modifying its form. In the light afforded by the



IN SUMERIAN AND CHINESE 2^
primitive Sumerian symbol, it has become needless to discuss which of the half-dozen
old variations of the Chinese derivative is the most authentic ; but we may compare
the form given by Chalmers (56) -^ and Morrison's <!(V and, above all, ^ (Luh-shu
fung, s. V. ^) with the Sumerian prototype, of which they are ingenious perversions.
Whether used to suggest the idea of ' black ' or the idea of ' night ', the symbol, of
course, depicts darkness descending from the concave sky. There is thus a glimmering
of truth in the opinion of those who derived :^ 'night' from ^ 'evening', with a line
to indicate the horizon above it. The view which makes :^ yik, yi, present in the
character as a Phonetic, correctly indicates that^^, 'night', is ixorayik, as the Sumerian
GE, 'night', is from GIG. ^ is dialectically ^a (H., P., N., K., J.); cf. the Sumerian
value GA. The Annamese gia or ja seems to indicate da = ga. As a Phonetic,
the character has the values yik and tik (P. 394; cf. P. 619). With the latter
sound cf. Sumerian DIR, DIG (or SIG), 'dark', as also DI-RIG { = DI-DIG =
DIG-DIG ?), in the like sense.
We have still to notice a final point of striking agreement between the Sumerian
and Chinese characters for ' black ' and ' night *. It is this. Besides GA, GE, GIG,
the Sumerian night-symbol had the value MI (from MI-G) ; and this is its ordinary
sound in the Assyrian syllabary. MI(G), however, was a Sumerian word before it
was adopted to play the part of a mere syllabic sign in phonetic writing. It was, in
fact, the M-form of GIG, characteristic of the Erne-sal or Accadian dialect. With
this MI (MIG, MUG? Vid. SU-MUG ap. Lex) we must surely compare "^ m^k,
muk, mo, K. mi'k, Jap. moku, ' dark ' (an old character also written |^, with the mouth
Radical, like Sumerian ^-feJ^J 'gloomy', Br. 832), and the younger ^ mik, mo,
'ink', 'black', with the Radical earth (circ. 220 a. d.) ; ^^ mei, mi, ' black ', with the
Phonetic :j0 wei, mi, ' small ' (P. 903) ; and >^ mei, mui, ' soot ', ' coal ', ' charcoal ',
written with the Phonetic ^ mou, mu (mu-k, P. 541), 'a certain one', and the Radical
J^ ' fire '. That Chinese writing has striven to eliminate ambiguity by the addition
of Radicals, the use of Phonetics, and the invention of new characters appropriate to
the various meanings of the sound, instead of being content with a single primitive
symbol like ^ (or the original form of it), is only natural, and should not be allowed
to blind us to the perception of the real relation between that and the Sumerian
character and between their respective sounds.
Edkins observed that ^ ch'ui, shui, A. iui, ' to drop ', ' let fall ',
' hang down ',
P. 456, has in the Seal-character a form something like that of ^ yii, 'rain' and of
rain-drops, and was perhaps an imitation. Cf. the ku win jp and ^ with their far-off
progenitor ;;•,; DUGUD (DUG-t-GID), 'heavy' (a picture which suggests fatting
down). The idea of flowers drooping on a stalk, or leaves pendent on a tree, doubtless
modified the shape of the symbol after the real meaning of the primary form was
forgotten. It is used as a Phonetic in 7^ chui, ' to weigh ', |f| chui, {ui, ' the weight



30 PROGRESSIVE TRANSFORMATION OF CHARACTERS
on a steelyard ',
' heavy ', and in other characters. Edkins infers an old sound </(3-p
from P. 502, which seems an insecure basis. Otherwise, dop^dok would not be
remarkable; cf. Sumerian DUG = DUB, ZAG = ZIB. Moreover, do-p, do-b, do-m,
are related sounds {cf. chung, dom, heavy; I-DIM, heavy).
-^ mu, 'mother', differs from ^ nil, 'woman', in the old writing, merely or
mainly by the addition of marks denoting the teats. Tai-hmg therefore calls it a
picture of the object ; but Edkins would rather explain the character by the principle
of Suggestion, observing, truly enough, that ' the separate provinces of the Six
Principles of Formation are not always well defined '. The fact, however, that in
Sumerian the woman-symbol ^37 or V (D- 327-336) has the sounds RAG, LAG
(Br. 1 1 1 71), and MUG, MU, may perhaps be held to throw more light on the connexion
f the two characters. The harmony with the Chinese is perfect, for the old sound of
nil is nok (R. 38, P. 50), and nil is lu dialectically ; so that we at once discern the
possibility of a close etymological relation between Chinese nok, lok, and Sumerian
RAG, LAG. Further, mu, 'mother', appears to be from muk (P. 187) ; cf. Sumerian
^»-t]y MUG, ' parent', Br. 8837. For the rest, any one with an eye for essentials
may see that the Sumerian woman-symbol (a pictogram of the vulva) is identical with
P^, ^, ^9 {woman), and ^, h^, '^ {mother).
The character -^ tzu, child ', ' son ', is represented by over forty older forms in
the Luh-shu fung. The principal type is ^, supposed to depict a baby strapped on
the back, its legs looking like one. Other forms add hair, hands, legs, and other
details to the simple figure, which is really the oldest, as is proved by the Sumerian
prototype W DU, ' child ', ' son ', from which it almost certainly sprang. The
Sumerian symbol (D. 338) has been thought to figure the flowing teats of a mother,
and hence to denote a 'suckling' or infant (Hilprecht; Hommel). But whatever
else it was intended to portray, it was clearly not meant for the figure of a human
baby. It is equally clear that the Chinese have halved the obscure original symbol,
perhaps thinking the double sign with its suggestion of duality inappropriate, or
merely for the sake of abbreviation ; afterwards adding the indication of uplifted
arms, in order to make the character more truly pictorial. The only forms besides
the one already given that need concern us here are one from a drinking-cup {yih-kia),
viz. X^, and another cited as occurring on a Wang-tzu k'iiek ('King's Son Gateway'),
viz. -^ {cf. the Tung-Tvin tsih character ^), the triangular heads of which agree so
well with the Sumerian symbol. One of the ku win forms looks strangely like
a combination of the two halves of the Sumerian character, so as roughly to suggest
a human figure {j^ ; but no stress need be laid upon this possible explanation of an
isolated symbol.
As to the sound, it is obvious that -^ tzu, tsze, F. chii, chi, K. ch&, J. shi, A. t'l, tt
(G. 1 231 7), which according to Edkins is from an older tak (R, 39) or tik (P. 36),



IN SUMERIAN AND CHINESE 31
offers a remarkable correspondence with the known values of the Sumerian symbol,
which are DU, TUR (from DUR), SHIR, SHAG (2 R. 19. 66 Strassmaier), and SAG
{cf. Na.h<l-SAG-usur = A^a3u-ap/a-usur, Nabopolassar); cf. Medic shak-ri, 'the son'.
^
ju, yii, zu, lu, J. niu, dju, A. ngiu, ' teats \ 'milk', 'to suckle' (G. 5691), is
apparently composed of ^ /u, OS. po-t, bu-t, ' to brood on eggs ', ' to hatch ', and ^
yik, ' a period '. ^ is a picture of c/aws over a young one. It agrees with Sumerian
^ MUD, ' to bring forth ' ; a figure originally intended to represent a bird over an egg.
But the ku win form of ^, which is 3^, does not agree with the modern analysis.
It, in fact, resembles the old Sumerian ^ GA, TA-6 (from DA-6), 'milk', 'breast'
(D. 416 ; Br. 61 i4f), laid on its side and opened, much more nearly than it resembles
its own modern equivalent. Compare also the old tripod form ,^. The primitive
pictogram may have represented a teat; but already in Sumerian this has been
modified, so as to suggest a vessel full of liquid (milk) : cf. D. 380, 390. The sounds
also agree. GA, dial. DA (cf. TA-G, TU, TI, as values of the Sumerian character)
in UME-DA = EME-GA, ' pregnant + giving milk ', 'pregnant woman', are clearly
akin, not only to the sounds associated with ^j but also to those of ^fJJ nai, lai, na,
J.dai, dei, 'woman's breasts', ' milk', ' to suckle ' (G. 81 14), OS. perhaps na-k (P. 8),
and #gf nou, ngieu, also read k'ou, 'milk', 'to suckle' (G. 8386). K'ou is very
noteworthy in the light of GA ; cf. Sumerian K A (GA), ' mouth ', which similarly
corresponds to the Chinese k'ou, ' mouth '.
The remark of the Shwo Win that the character ^ (^) kiai, kai, ka, ka-t,
P. 256, represents vegetation growing in a tangle (kien shou, ts'ao-ts'ai ye; slang ts'ao
sh^ng-chi san-lwan ye) would seem to indicate that the figure is a simplification of the
primitive Sumerian ^ KUSH, ' herbage ', as it might very well be. Even the sounds
agree ; for as a Phonetic the character may stand for kat^ kot^ or kit ( = kut, kus) : cf.
ki, ki-t (P. 776), 'grass growing thickly', G. 954, and especially ^ hui, J.ki, ku-t,
' plants ', ' herbs ', ' vegetation ', G. 5214, P. 244 a. The same symbol, however, appears
as the Phonetic in ^^ k'i, k'ai, ' to cut a notch in a stick ', G. 1 05 1 , P. 256 (Chalmers, 114:
k'at, ' to engrave '), which is itself Phonetic in ^ k'i, k'ei, k'a-t, ' to carve ', G. 1052, and
in ^ k'i, k'ai, k'at, k'et, ' covenant ', ' bond ', ' deed ', G. 1053, P. 567. Accordingly the
Phonetic Shwo Wen asserts that the character represents ' the notches made on a stick
or bamboo in the first efforts at writing ', and then comes to mean to draw or mark
boundary lines (see Chalmers, 114). Now for this last sense Sumerian presents us
with i^^ ^ : Sign-list, No. 90), 6aR ( = k'at), 6UR, GUR (MUR, UR ; 6IR), 'to
draw an outline or design ' ; ' to sculpture reliefs ' ; ' boundary ', ' limit ', ' ban '. It would
seem, therefore, that we have here an instance in which the later simplified character
has come to represent two (or more) originally distinct symbols. Cf. also ^ (^),
(G)ASH, 'curse', 'wish', which certainly resembles the Chinese sound and symbol
(ga§ = kat). Similar examples of the later assimilation or identification of characters



32 PROGRESSIVE TRANSFORMATION OF CHARACTERS
originally distinct have been observed in the Sumerio-Babylonian script in its
transition from the linear to the cuneiform mode of writing. {See Dangin on the
linear forms corresponding to -<, i, &c. D. ii ; 257.) Characters originally, as it
would seem, diverse, yet more or less resembling each other, were finally merged
in a common representative.
