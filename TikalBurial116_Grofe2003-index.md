Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to explore and discuss some of the significant
calendrical information given by two bone fragments from the tomb of Tikal’s
Hasaw Chan K’awil in burial 116, Temple 2. The intervals indicated on these
fragments reveal important connections to periods that facilitate the calculation
of the true tropical year and the 26,000 year cycle of precession, both of which
appear to be strongly suggested by the structure of the Long Count.
The subject of Mesoamerican calendrical calculation has been a
preoccupation in the field of Maya studies since its inception, and this has been
the area in which the greatest initial progress in hieroglyphic translation has
taken place. From a recovered a copy of Diego de Landa’s Relación de las Cosas de



2
Yucatán from the mid Sixteenth century, Charles Brasseur de Bourbourg revealed
the Maya names of the days of the tzolk’in cycle of 260 days, and how it is
intercalated with the 365 day Haab’ solar year, forming the 52 year calendar
round, as found throughout Mesoamerica (Coe 1992:100-102). By the late 1800’s,
Ernst Förstemann had accurately read and understood the Long Count system in
the Dresden Codex, with its repeating cycles of 360 day years which proceeded
from the ancient origin date of 4 Ahau 8 Cumku (ibid: 107-108).
In 1905, Joseph Goodman first proposed a nearly accurate correlation
between the Long Count and Gregorian/Julian calendars, establishing the
antiquity of the origin date (ibid: 111-114). Following this, much of the work in
Maya studies in the majority of the twentieth century has been concerned with
further calendrical and astronomical information as elucidated in translated texts
on both monumental inscriptions and the information found in the few
remaining codices.
Eric Thompson, whose extensive work on Maya calendrics dominated the
larger part of the twentieth century, later finalized the correlation of the Long
Count calendar (Thompson 1935; 1970: 303-310). Though Thompson has been
criticized by Coe (1992) for his focus on Maya time cycles at the expense of other
textual and phonetic information, his work, and that of his predecessors, must be
acknowledged. From their initial efforts, a vast amount of information regarding
the complexity and scientific, observational accuracy of the calendrical systems
of ancient Mesoamerica has been revealed. We are thus challenged to attempt to
understand a way of reckoning time which exists outside the Western tradition,
often preceding and exceeding the calculations of the West.

Though much about the Long Count system has been elucidated, there are
still some significant questions which remain regarding the function and purpose
of the system itself, and the manner in which calculations were made. There is a
general consensus that the Maya were able to track and calculate the true tropical
year, and the drifting of the Haab’ (Aveni 2001:165). While a great deal has been
written on this subject, the question still remains as to the means by which the
Maya were able to predict the tropical year, and the accuracy of this count which
would allow them to predict its location in the distant past or future. The
existence of the 365 day solar year has been clearly demonstrated, yet it becomes
immediately apparent that this cycle accounts for no leap year, and drifts
approximately one day every four years.
Given the sophistication of the calculation of various lunar cycles, and the
absolute accuracy of unambiguously counting each day within a system which
spans thousands of years, it is likely that the Maya, and the developers of the
Mesoamerican calendar systems, employed a highly accurate method to track the
drift of the Haab’ against the true tropical year. According to the early work of J.
E. Teeple (1930), some of the repeating intervals of time from the inscriptions at
Copan reveal a Metonic cycle of approximately 19 tropical years, also 235
lunations, given on Stela A as two successive dates separated by 9.5.0. or 6,940
days. This would give a tropical year of 365.2631 days, as opposed to the true
tropical year at 365.2422 (Aveni 2001: 164). It is interesting to note that this cycle
is exactly 260 days, or one tzolk’in, from the ending of a K’atun. We will discuss
the possible significance of this in a later section. While this system would
successfully operate for short intervals of 19 years within a calendar round of 52



4
Haab’, it rapidly degrades at higher intervals of time. After only three cycles of
19 years, the count again drifts by one day.
Associated with the above interval of 6,940 days is an additional date of
9.14.19.8.0 12 Ahau 18 Cumku, exactly 200 days before the K’atun ending of
9.15.0.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Yax. Teeple proposes that this is a more accurate calculation
of the tropical year starting from the zero year of the Long Count to this K’atun
ending, over which the Haab’ had drifted by two full cycles plus a remainder of
200 days, for a total of 930 days giving a tropical year of 365.2418 days. The
actual drift is a close 931 days using a 365.2422 day tropical year. This would
suggest that the authors of the inscription were acknowledging 18 Cumku as the
original day and month at the time the K’atun ending was then falling. The
Haab’ had drifted to the point where the calendar round was a full 200 day after
the original date in the zero year (Teeple 1930; Aveni 2001: 164-165; 352). In this
case, it is a solar anniversary of a day which fell exactly ten days after the origin
date of 4 Ahau 8 Cumku.
The 9.15.0.0.0 calculation appears to be highly accurate, much more than
the Metonic cycle, though it still reveals an error of one day over this period of
3,846 years. Teeple has received some criticism for his assertions, given that the
dates provided may be historical in nature, and the absence of proof of the
calculation process or the intention of representing the drift of the Haab’.
However, the calendrical nature of the K’atun ending, and the correspondences
between significant astronomical and calendrical events and historical events has
clearly been demonstrated (Aveni 2001: 165).
The tomb of Hasaw Chan K’awil contained a cache of many incised bones,
some of which are illustrated. Two of these bones contain information which



5
may help us to understand how the Maya and their predecessors were able to
perform such an accurate calculation of the tropical year. First, bone #4P-113
contains two dates, beginning with the origin date of 4 Ahau 8 Cumku. The next
date is 4 Ben 1 Xul, giving an interval of 2.12.0.13 or 18,733 days. This is exactly
52 Tuns of 360 days with the addition of 13 days. Most significantly, this is 260
days before 52 tropical years, or 52 Haab’ plus 13 days. Again, as with the
Metonic cycle of 19 years, we see that the addition of a 260 day tzolk’in brings us
to another significant event, which will be discussed further.
To illustrate:
52 Tuns 52 tr.yr. < | -----------------------------260 days ---------------------------- |
-13 days- | | -13 days
18,733 days from origin date 52 haab
The interval suggested by this bone uses the Calendar Round system of 52
Haab’, associating it with 52 Tuns which is 260 days before, with the addition of
13 days of drift from the true tropical year. This gives a tropical year of 365.25,
operating much like a leap year over one Calendar Round of 52 Haab’. This is the
exact quarter-day addition, in that 13 is precisely one quarter of 52, and this
would serve as a more accurate calculation than the Metonic cycle, but not quite
as accurate as the 9.15.0.0.0 calculation. Because the actual interval between 52
Tuns plus 13 days and the true solar year is 259.5944 days, the cycle breaks down
after periods of over 128 Haab’, and this is the very reason that the leap year is
omitted at the turn of every odd numbered century in the Gregorian calendar.
Nonetheless, this system could be used within periods under 128 Haab’
for any increment of time. Every 52 Haab’ requires the addition of 13 days, and
the remaining years can then be divided by four, or an extra day can be added



6
every four years. For instance, the amount of Haab’ drift in 77 Haab’ will be 13
days for 52 Haab’, plus 6 days for the remaining 25 Haab’, giving a total of 19
days of drift from 77 Haab’ to the true solar year. Again, this breaks down
beyond 128 Haab’, and requires a more accurate correction for longer durations
of time.
Was there an additional correction to this Calendar Round calculation? It
seems, from Teeple’s evidence, that an even more precise calibration was needed
for durations far in excess of 128 years. Using the Calendar Round system, in 5
Calendar Rounds, or 260 Haab’, the expected drift using the quarter day system
would be 65 days. However, the actual drift is 2.028 days less, at 63 days. Given
that the Calendar Round drift was being regularly calculated and recorded at 13
days of Haab’ drift to reach the true tropical year, it is highly likely that
successive generations would have noticed that the expected drift was off by 2
days every five Calendar Rounds. Would this correction suffice to calculate
much longer durations? If so, what is the exact error accumulated?
Using the suggested correction of subtracting 2 days from the expected
Calendar Round Haab’ drift of 65 days per 260 Haab’, we get a solar year
calculation of 365.2423 days, even closer to the true value of 365.2422 days. This
would only accumulate an error of 1 day after 36 x 260 Haab’, or 9,360 Haab’, a
duration almost twice as long as the 13 B’ak’tun cycle. However, the Maya and
their predecessors may not have been calculating this correction to the fullest
extent of accuracy in that fractions or decimals may not be observed.
From another bone fragment from the cache of Hasaw Chan K’awil, noted
as Miscellaneous Text 26 from Burial 116, we find a series of three Calendar
Round dates, with an associated glyph which has been noted by Matthew



7
Looper (2002) and Nikolai Grube, Alfonso Lacadena and Simon Martin (2003).
This glyph is a recognizable image of pih or pik, usually representing a B’ak’tun
of 400 Tuns. Above this image is the number 11, somewhat like a distance
number, while to the left usually appears the number three, preceeded by the
ordinal u-. In several examples, the glyph reading 3-11-pih exists as part of the
title of an ahau. However, in the example from the bone fragment from burial
116, we find that there are three successive examples associated with Calendar
Round dates. The first is 6 Ahau 8 Mak, u-1-11-pih, or the first 11-pih. This is a
period of 8660 days, as noted by Looper, within the Calendar Round. The second
11-pih follows with 8 Ahau 8 Mak, and the third with 10 Ahau 8 Sip. Each
successive 11-pih, then represents the exact same interval of 8660 days. The
accumulated periods of 3 x 8660 days, or 25,980 days seem to reflect a temporal
title much like the 3-K’atun ahau titles, bestowed only to those who live within
three periods of 20 years (Looper 2002).
However, Grube, et al., noticed that the interval seems to represent
periods of 11 B’ak’tuns in length, resulting in the exact same Calendar Round
positions. This would seem to explain the usage of the B’ak’tun glyph, yet the
title of 3-11-pih ahau remains somewhat obscure. Gurbe, et al. suggest that it
denotes the duration of the present creation, with the title meaning “Lord of the
present Creation” (Grube, et al. 2003: II-6). However, these authors overlook that
the u- may simply reflect ordinals and not the alternative meaning of possession.
There are several interesting things about this interval, both as 11
B’ak’tuns and as 8660 days. Looking at the period of 11 B’ak’tuns as a measuring
device for the calculation of the tropical year may provide some insight.

To illustrate, using the Calendar Round calculation process outlined
above to obtain the amount of Haab’ drift from the true tropical year:
11 B’ak’tuns = 4400 Tuns
4400 Tuns = 1,584,000 days = 4339 Haab’ + 265 days
4339 Haab’ = 83 Calendar Rounds + 23 Haab’
For 13 days of drift every C.R.:
83 C.R. x 13 = 1079 days } + } = 1084 days expected = 2 Haab’+354 d 23 Haab’ = 5.75 days (5)} = 11 days drift from Haab’ 4
For correction, subtract 2 days for every 5 C.R., or 1 day every 130 Haab’:
83 C.R. = 16.6 x 2 days = 33.2 days 5
or, more accurately:
4339 Haab’ = 33.4 days drift from expected (1/4 day drift) 130 Haab’
1084 days - 33 days = 1051 days = 2 Haab’ + 321 days = 44 days
44 days btwn. Haab’ and tropical year
For a visual illustration:
At 11 B’ak’tuns:
Tropical Year Haab’ 11 B’ak’tuns
| -11 days- | -265 days- |
-33 days- |
Expected C.R. calculation (1/4 year)
The telling thing about this configuration, is the relationship to the
number 11, in 11 B’ak’tuns, in that the expected drift, using the Calendar Round
calibration, gives us a tropical year 11 days before the Haab’. However, the
correction gives us a more accurate 44 days between the tropical year and the
Haab’, which seems to reflect the 4400 Tun cycle, informing us that the accurate



9
Haab’ drift is 44 days every 4400 Tuns. Note that this only works in these higher
increments of time.
When we multiply 11 B’ak’tuns three times, some interesting things occur.
Again, we can use a Haab’ drift of 44 days for each 11 B’ak’tuns, giving 44, 88,
and 132 days of drift for each respective 11 B’ak’tun cycle. At 33 B’ak’tuns, or
3-11-pih, let us note the interesting configurations of the position of the Haab’
relative to the tropical year. For the sake of this discussion, I will use the 584383
correlation which places the origin date at August 11, 3114 B.C.E.:
At 33 B’ak’tuns = 13,200 Tuns
Distance between tropical year and Haab’ = 132 days
8/11
Tropical Year 33 B’ak’tuns ||
-132 days- | -65 days
Haab’ 12/21
From this image, we can see that the position of the tropical year remains
constantly on August 11, where the count began on 4 Ahau 8 Cumku. This also
coincides closely with the second solar zenith passage in Copan, and Izapa, near
15° N latitude. The zenith passages of the sun, as we shall see, are the most
accurate way of measuring the exact day of the solar year. Furthermore, at this
latitude, the two zenith passages are separated by exactly 260 days, with the
winter solstice precisely at the midpoint between the zenith passages, 131 days in
either direction (Aveni 2001: 144).
At 33 B’ak’tuns, we see the position of the Haab’ falling on the winter
solstice, 132 days after the second zenith passage on August 11. Given that the



10
zenith passages of the sun may occur over two days around 15° N latitude, with
slight differences in location, the 132 days may include this extra day. Similarly,
it may also require two days to determine the exact last day of the zenith. It
appears that the creators of the Long Count system, and those who noticed the
33-B’ak’tun pattern were intending to determine when the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumku
would reach the point of the winter solstice. This is most fascinating, however, it
should be noted that the Haab’ by this time would have drifted in and out of the
winter solstice over eight times. What is more interesting is the length of time
being measured. 13,200 Tuns is exactly one half of a precessional cycle of 26,000
years. This is an apparent midpoint, as we shall see what happens when we
multiply 13,200 Tuns by two.
33 B’ak’tuns appears to be the relevance of 3-11-pih, yet when multiplied
twice, it gives us 66 B’ak’tuns, or 26,400 Tuns. This is equal to 26,038 Haab’ + 130
days, or 26,021 tropical years + 32 days. This is almost exactly the cycle of
precession, and in this time period, the equinoxes and solstices will have
precessed through the entire zodiac and back to their exact location a full year of
365.54 days. This is a measurement which will bring the position of the zenith
passage on August 11 to the exact sidereal position as it was on the day of origin.
At 66 B’ak’tuns = 26,400 Tuns
Distance between tropical year and Haab’ = 264 days
8/11
Tropical Year 66 B’ak’tuns

11
Amazingly, also on this day, according to the calculation of 264 days of
Haab’ drift for 26,400 Tuns, the Haab’ location of 4 Ahau 8 Cumku will be found
on the day of the first zenith passage on May 1 or 2nd. This was apparently the
intention of the creators of the calendar system, coordinating the long cycle of
precession – the longest observable astronomical cycle – with the drift of the
Haab’ from the tropical year. Curiously, the positioning of the Haab’ at this date
of 66 B’ak’tuns may indeed approximate the positioning of the Haab’ during the
earliest appearance of the Long Count.
It should be mentioned that this apparently intended pattern begins to
show an error of three additional days of drift at 66 B’ak’tuns, over the corrected
drift of 264 days, reaching 267 days. A slight error at 33 B’ak’tuns is evident, with
the true Haab’ drift being 133.978 days rather than 132 days. This error is
certainly slight given the vast expanses of time being dealt with accurately.
The measurement of the precise tropical year can be accomplished using a
vertical zenith sight tube, as can be found in Monte Albán, and other
Mesoamerican sites. This consists of a narrow vertical opening through which a
beam of light passes on the day of the solar zenith, illuminating a chamber
beneath, which otherwise is never lit by the sun on all other days of the year
(Aveni 2001: 262-271).
This may indeed be the original purpose of using the solar zenith passage
days to calculate increments of time which then leave 260 days additional days to
reach the final goal. At the latitude of Copan or Izapa, if we count forward from
4 Ahau 8 Cumku on the origin date and the second zenith passage of the sun,
this would place the day of the intended goal on the date of the first zenith
passage, 260 days later. The Metonic interval of 19 tropical years plus 260 days to



12
reach an exact K’atun, and the 52 Tuns thirteen days plus 260 days is yet another
example. All count forward form 4 Ahau 8 Cumku. Clearly, there is interwoven
in this system the utilization of solar zenith passage calibrations which rely on
the specific latitude where the two zenith passages are 260 days apart.
We also see the specific calculation of the cycle precession within these
cycles, which apparently was intended in the inception of the Long Count. The
66 B’ak’tun cycle implied in the bone fragment of Hasaw Chan K’awil accounts
for an exact measurement of one precessional cycle. Curiously, this is also
implied in the Long Count system of 13 B’ak’tuns, in that five cycles of 13
B’ak’tuns gives 65 B’ak’tuns, or 26,000 Tuns, exactly one B’ak’tun less than the 66
B’ak’tun cycle, accounting for exactly 360 days of precession, presumably to fit
the 360 day Tun.
Curiously, the calculation of exactly one day of precession corresponds to
26,000 days, which is coincidentally, or perhaps intentionally close to the
calculation of 3 x 8,660 days, or 25,980 days, the original number proposed by
Looper (2002) which falls within the nearest Calendar Round. If this was
intended, the increment of one day of precession, some 71 years, indeed may
have been a significant event for an individual, thus affording them the title of 3
11-pih ahau as Looper suggests. Alternately, the naming of an ahau as 3-11-pih
may confer upon them , as Grube, et al. suggest, that the ahau is lord over
creation. In this case, the half-precessional cycle may relate a sense of centering
oneself in time, as in space, with alpha and omega points at equal distances.
In this exploration, it appears highly likely that the ancient
Mesoamericans devised an ingenious system with which to track and observe
the cycles of nature and the cosmos. That they succeeded at this much earlier



13
than Europeans, or even earlier civilizations in the West, may come as some
surprise and a definite challenge to the Eurocentric bias against non-Western
histories, traditions, and sciences. There is much more to understand regarding
the operations of this system, and the meanings of this knowledge to those who
recorded it. Yet, what appears in the system of the Long Count is an unparalleled
understanding of the workings of the earth as it relates to the heavens, and the
human realm as it relates to the entirety of time.
Appendix
There is perhaps more to understand regarding the possible connection of
11 B’ak’tuns to the increments of 8,660 days. The increments 25,980 and 8,660
appear to be based on multiples of 433 days, conferring perhaps another reading
on 3-11-pih, or 3 x 11 + 400. The number 433 is curiously composed of one 360
day Tun plus 73 days, or one fifth of a Haab’ year, so that:
433 days = 360 days + 73 days
8,660 days = 20(433) days = 20 Tuns + 4 Haab’
25,980 days multiplied by six brings us to exactly 433 Tuns, accurate for
measuring six days of precessional drift. When added to exactly 70 tropical
years, 433 brings us to precisely 26,000 days, or one day of precessional drift.
Following this, 1,400 tropical years plus 8,660 days is equal to 20 days of
precessional drift.
83 Calendar Rounds + 8,660 days = 4,400 Tuns or 11 B’ak’tuns
83 C.R. + 8,300 days + 360 days = 11 B’ak’tuns
This gives us the same remainder of 8,660 days from the point of starting a
new Calendar Round.
