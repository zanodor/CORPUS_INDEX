Ninurta defeats Asag as well as the Na Stones
on Ancient Near East cylinder seals
Number 1
The most common animals on cylinder seals from the Ancient Near East are lions, bulls and sheep. But a small number of seals also feature boars, as shown, for example, in this imprint It is obvious to say that this is a hunting scene: the owner of the seal, who is indicated by the letters 'wyzk', kills a wild boar just like king Šulgi does:
A praise poem of Šulgi When a burly wild boar (?) is running across the plain, I pierce its lungs with an arrow. With only one shot of mine I bring it to the ground; no single clansman from my regiments can surpass me in archery. I am a man with sharp eyes. When I lead the ...... of the crack troops, I know best of all how to cast the throw-stick, running as quick as light radiating from heaven. What I hit no longer rises from its place. (1 line unclear)I can throw a ball (?) as high in the air as if it were a rag. I can bring down quadrupeds lightning-quick with the sling. I, Šulgi, can catch a goat with a quick pace; nothing checks my power. ...... has been given to me. Wherever I direct my steps, I always achieve something; when I return from the desert, I always bring something more for her -- for Ninsumun, my own mother, I am her son of five things, of 10 things (= of everything).
And yet we are not done with this: there is much more to tell about both the hunter and the boar.



Number 2
Because a boar is a fearless beast and that is why in the ancient Iran the warrior god Verethragna is called a ‘mighty boar’:
Verethragna
The warrior-god who fights against the forces of evil constantly. He has no other responsibilities and so is considered the greatest protection against the demons of Angra Mainyu. He is depicted in various forms and changes shape depending on the circumstances of battle. He can be a bull with yellow ears and golden horns, a white horse adorned with gold, a strong camel, a mighty boar, a young man of strength at the age of 15 (considered the ideal age when a boy became a man), a great ram, a deer, a warrior with a golden sword, a strong wind, or a great bird. As a bird, Verethragna was associated with Simurgh, the legendary bird of the mountains, whose feathers could be rubbed or burned to invoke her aid in times of need.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verethragna
Number 3
Kanishka I Orlagno (Verethragna)
On this coin he is on the left in his human form.



Number 4
And here Verethragna stands both as a boar and as a warrior, as the most highly armed, who is in constant battle with men and daemons:
Verethragna In the Bahram Yasht
Yasht 14, the hymn of praise to Verethragna, ‘though ill-preserved, contains what seem very archaic elements’ There, Verethragna is described as ‘the most highly armed’ (Yasht 14.1), the ‘best equipped with might’ (14.13), with ‘effervescent glory’ (14.3), has ‘conquering superiority’ (14.64), and is in constant battle with men and daemons (14.4, 14.62).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verethragna
By the way, Verethragna is also connected with sexual potency and ‘confers virility’ (Yasht 14.29), has the ‘ability to heal’ (14.3) and ‘renders wonderful’:
Verethragna
Verethragna is not exclusively associated with military might and victory. So, for instance, he is
connected with sexual potency and ‘confers virility’ (Yasht 14.29), has the ‘ability to heal’ (14.3) and ‘renders wonderful’. The Yasht begins with an enumeration of the ten forms in which the divinity appears: As an impetuous wind (14.2-5); as an armed warrior (14.27) and as an adolescent of fifteen (14.17); and in the remaining seven forms as animals: a bull with horns of gold (14.7); a white horse with ears and a muzzle of gold (14.9); a camel in heat (14.11-13); a boar (14.15); a bird of prey (veregna, 14.19-21); a ram (14.23); and a wild goat (14.25). Many of these incarnations are also shared with other divinities, for instance, the youth, the bull and the horse are also attributed to Tishtrya. Likewise, the bird, the camel and the wind to Vayu-Vata, another member of the Zoroastrian pantheon associated with martial victory.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verethragna
This means, that as a boar he might be virile and engender a child.



Number 5
The 'hunting scenes' can also be viewed in a different way. In the star list of the Mul-apin, 'The Wild Boar' is a constellation:
22 The Wild Boar (EN.TE.NA.BAR.CHUM), d.NIN.GIR.SU {Centaurus?}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
And so is the warrior's lance:
6 The Lance (KAK.SI.SA), the spear of the great hero Ninurta [Procyon - or Sirius] {Alphard in Hydra with Monoceros as the lance}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
So here we see that 'The Wild Boar' is associated with Ningirsu and 'The Lance' with Ninurta. What is special is that Ningirsu is another name of Ninurta, which means that in the image Ninurta kills himself. This turns out not to be the case, because on the imprint Ninurta battles with the 'Na Stone', and in the myth 'Ninurta's exploits' this stone is worked on like a pig, therefore it is depicted as such:
Ninurta's exploits: a cir-sud (?) to Ninurta
479-481. My king turned to the na stone. He ...... the body from the na stone. Ninurta son of Enlil cursed it: 482-486. ‘Stone, since you said, ‘If only it had been me’; na stones, since you bewitched my powers -- lie down there, you, to be worked on like a pig. Be discarded, be used for nothing, end up by being reduced to tiny fragments. He who knows you shall reduce you to liquid.’



Number 6
Antelope Ninurta
We continue with this imprint. In the centre of it is an upside-down antelope. Depicted upside-down this animal indicates that the archer is Ninurta, for he is the only god who is called the 'Antelope of Heaven' as he is called in ‘Ninurta’s exploits’:
Ninurta's exploits: a cir-sud (?) to Ninurta
57-69. ‘But you will force it into the shackles of the gods. You, Antelope of Heaven, must trample the mountains beneath your hooves, Ninurta, lord, son of Enlil. Who has so far been able to resist its assault? The besetting Asag is beyond all control, its weight is too heavy. Rumours of its armies constantly arrive, before ever its soldiers are seen. This thing's strength is massive, no weapon has been able to overturn it. Ninurta, neither the axe nor the all-powerful spear can penetrate its flesh, no warrior like it has ever been created against you.’
In the imprint Ninurta is a warrior god: in the myth ‘Ninurta’s exploits’ ‘his arms grasped a lance’ and ‘he placed a quiver on his hook’, which means that he is a lancer as well as an archer:
Ninurta's exploits: a cir-sud (?) to Ninurta
70-95. The lord cried ‘Alas!’ so that Heaven trembled, and Earth huddled at his feet and was terrified (?) at his strength. Enlil became confused and went out of the E-kur. The mountains were devastated. That day the earth became dark, the Anuna trembled. The hero beat his thighs with his fists. The gods dispersed; the Anuna disappeared over the horizon like sheep. The lord arose, touching the sky; Ninurta went to battle, with one step (?) he covered a league, he was an alarming storm, and rode on the eight winds towards the rebel lands. His arms grasped the lance. The mace snarled at the mountains, the club began to devour all the enemy. He fitted the evil wind and the sirocco on a pole (?), he placed the quiver on its hook (?). An enormous hurricane, irresistible, went before the hero, stirred up the dust, caused the dust to settle, levelled high and low, filled the holes. It caused a rain of coals and flaming fires; the fire consumed men. It overturned tall trees by their trunks, reducing the forests to heaps, Earth put her hands on her heart and cried harrowingly; the Tigris was muddied, disturbed, cloudy, stirred up. He hurried to battle on the boat Ma-kar-nuntaea; the people there did not know where to turn, they bumped into (?) the walls’.



Number 6
Lion Pig
In ‘Ninurta's exploits’ his opponents are Asag and the ‘Na Stones’. Asag is called a lion among other things:
Ninurta's exploits: a cir-sud (?) to Ninurta
265-280. ‘Hero, ah, whatever further awaits you, do not on any account meddle with the hurricane of the mountains. Ninurta, lord, son of Enlil, I tell you again, it is made like a storm. It is a blister whose smell is foul, like mucus which comes from the nose it is unpleasant, lord, its words are devious, it will not obey you. My master, it has been created against you as a god; who can help you? Hero, it falls on the land as a whirlwind, it scrubs it as if with saltwort, Ninurta, it chases the onagers before it in the mountains. It’s terrifying splendour sends the dust into clouds, it causes a
downpour of potsherds. In the rebel lands it is a lion striking with savage teeth; no man can catch it. After reducing everything to nothing in the north wind, that one will batter you’.
And to the 'Na Stones' Ninurta said that they will be worked on like a pig, therefore it is depicted as such:
Ninurta's exploits: a cir-sud (?) to Ninurta
482-486. ‘Stone, since you said, ‘If only it had been me’; na stones, since you bewitched my powers - lie down there, you, to be worked on like a pig. Be discarded, be used for nothing, end up by being reduced to tiny fragments. He who knows you shall reduce you to liquid.’



Number 7
On this stamp Ninurta, fighting on horseback, is depicted twice, indicating that he is in the constellation Gemini:
5 The Large Twins (MASH.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL), d.Lugalgirra (plague god?) and d.Meslamtaea. (Nergal.) {‘End’ rather than large}; Bottom stars of Gemini}
At the top he holds a bow: the constellation 'The Bow':
7 The Bow (BAN), the elamite d.Ishtar, the daughter of d.Enlil {part of Hydra}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
At the bottom he has a lance: the constellation 'The Lance':
6 The Lance (KAK.SI.SA), the spear of the great hero Ninurta [Procyon - or Sirius] {Alphard in Hydra with Monoceros as the lance}
He rides a horse twice, and a horse too represents a constellation:
30 The star to his left: The Horse (ANSHE.KUR.RA){Lacerta. This is later confused with Equuleus.}
His enemy Asag is depicted as a lion, obviously the constellation 'Leo':
8 The Lion (UR.GU.LA), d.Latarak. (Monster.) {Regulus, in Leo}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
The 'Na Stone' is depicted as a pig: the constellation 'The Wild Boar':
22 The Wild Boar (EN.TE.NA.BAR.CHUM), d.NIN.GIR.SU {Centaurus?}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm



This sky map shows that these constellations, with the exception of The Horse, are neatly aligned.

It is customary for the new moon to be depicted as a crescent, as a bowl, or as a boat or barge. This means that on the next two imprints, two boats symbolize this phase of the moon. The above Babylonian calendar shows that the moon god Suen is the presiding deity of Gemini: the boats therefore also indicate this constellation.



Number 8
In this imprint, Ninurta is depicted twice, as he is in the constellation Gemini. He sails in the moon boat which in 'Ninurta's exploits' is called 'the boat Ma-kar-nunta-ea':
Ninurta's exploits: a cir-sud (?) to Ninurta
70-95. The lord cried ‘Alas!’ so that Heaven trembled, and Earth huddled at his feet and was terrified (?) at his strength. Enlil became confused and went out of the E-kur. The mountains were devastated. That day the earth became dark, the Anuna trembled. The hero beat his thighs with his fists. The gods dispersed; the Anuna disappeared over the horizon like sheep. The lord arose, touching the sky; Ninurta went to battle, with one step (?) he covered a league, he was an alarming storm, and rode on the eight winds towards the rebel lands. His arms grasped the lance. The mace snarled at the mountains, the club began to devour all the enemy. He fitted the evil wind and the sirocco on a pole (?), he placed the quiver on its hook (?). An enormous hurricane, irresistible, went before the hero, stirred up the dust, caused the dust to settle, levelled high and low, filled the holes. It caused a rain of coals and flaming fires; the fire consumed men. It overturned tall trees by their trunks, reducing the forests to heaps, Earth put her hands on her heart and cried harrowingly; the Tigris was muddied, disturbed, cloudy, stirred up. He hurried to battle on the boat Ma-kar-nuntaea; the people there did not know where to turn, they bumped into (?) the walls.
In this boat he twice prepared the throw-stick:
Ninurta's exploits: a cir-sud (?) to Ninurta
151-167. The hero, the son, pride of his father, the very wise, rising from profound deliberation, Ninurta, the lord, the son of Enlil, gifted with broad wisdom, the ...... god, the lord stretched his leg to mount the onager, and joined the battalions ....... He spread over the mountains his great long ......, he caused ...... to go out among its people like the ....... He reached ....... He went into the rebel lands in the vanguard of the battle. He gave orders to his lance, and attached it ...... by its cord; the lord commanded his mace, and it went to its belt. The hero hastened to the battle, he ...... heaven and earth. He prepared the throw-stick and the shield, the mountains were smitten and cringed beside the battle legions of Ninurta.
And again, he fights against the ‘Na Stone’ which is depicted as a pig. And above this pig are reeds of the reedbeds: Asag will set them on fire:
Ninurta's exploits: a cir-sud (?) to Ninurta
168-186. The Asag leapt up at the head of the battle. For a club it uprooted the sky, took it in its hand; like a snake it slid its head along the ground. It was a mad dog attacking to kill the helpless, dripping with sweat on its flanks. Like a wall collapsing, the Asag fell on Ninurta, the son of Enlil. Like an accursed storm, it howled in a raucous voice; like a gigantic snake, it roared at the Land. It dried up the waters of the mountains, dragged away the tamarisks, tore the flesh of the Earth and covered her with painful wounds. It set fire to the reedbeds, bathed the sky in blood, turned it inside out; it dispersed the people there. At that moment, on that day, the fields became black scum, across the whole extent of the horizon, reddish like purple dye -- truly it was so!.



Number 9
An Enki Ninurta reed pig
In this imprint, three gods sail a boat. At the left is An, the god of heaven indicated by the star, who’s heart appeased for the lord (Ninurta):
Ninurta's exploits: a cir-sud (?) to Ninurta
669-671. ’May An's heart be appeased for the lord, may the maiden, Mother Bau, shine like the daylight for Ninurta, Enlil's strength.’ 672-680. They sang to the lord in the ceremonial (?) boat. The boat, floating of its own accord, was piled up with riches. The boat Ma-kar-nunta-ea proceeded shiningly. To greet the hero from the smiting of weapons, the Anuna ...... came to meet him. They pressed their noses to the ground, they placed their hands on their chests. They addressed a prayer and a supplication to the lord: ‘May your anger be appeased ....... Ninurta, king, Uta-ulu, lift your head to heaven.’
In the middle is Enki, the lord of the earth and the waters within it. He is indicated by two streams of water. He is the one who endowed Ninurta with a great intelligence.:
Ninurta's exploits: a cir-sud (?) to Ninurta
698-711. Since the hero had killed the Asag, since the lord had made that pile of stones, since he had given the order ‘Let it be called Stone’, since he had ...... the roaring dragon, since the hero had traced the way of the waters ...... down from above, since he had brought them to the fertile fields, since he had made famous the plough of abundance, since the lord had established it in regular furrows, since Ninurta son of Enlil had heaped up grain-piles and granaries -- Ninurta son of Enlil entrusted their keeping to the care of the lady who possesses the divine powers which exist of themselves, who is eminently worthy of praise, to Nisaba, good lady, greatly wise, pre-eminent in the lands, her who possesses the principal tablet with the obligations of en and lugal, endowed by Enki on the Holy Mound with a great intelligence.
At the right is Ninurta, the warrior god, who kills the pig with his lance. Above this pig are reeds and Asag will set them on fire:
The boat represents the new moon and Suen, the god of this moon, is the presiding deity of Gemini.
The question arises: what do these seals really want to tell us. To answer it we first have to look at a Cyprus stamp.



Number 10
Here are two sides of a Cyprus stamp. On the left we see a man and a woman who will be married to each other and on the right we see the woman with her child. Obviously this child was conceived during the honeymoon of the man and the woman and he born about nine months later.
What can be immediately understood on this stamp is suggested on the cylinder seals. From other cylinder seals we can deduce that marriages were consummated in June or July and that about nine months later a children were born in March or April.
The previous cylinder seals were made between ca. 2340-2193. At that time, the sun passed 'The Wild Boar' {Centaurus?} in July and it passed through Gemini in April. These two months indicated that a child was engendered in July and born in April.



Number 11
So, in this imprint we see a boar or a pig indicating the constellation 'The Wild Boar':
22 The Wild Boar (EN.TE.NA.BAR.CHUM), d.NIN.GIR.SU {Centaurus?}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
And the warrior's lance, indicating ‘The Lance’:
6 The Lance (KAK.SI.SA), the spear of the great hero Ninurta [Procyon - or Sirius] {Alphard in Hydra with Monoceros as the lance}
v http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
The funny thing is that this imprint can be understood in three different ways:
1. The boar may depict the warrior god Verethragna who fights his opponent. 2. It may represent the ‘Na Stone’ which is defeated by Ninurta, 3. And it also can represent Set who is defeated by Horus:
Set (/sɛt/; Egyptological: Sutekh - swtẖ ~ stẖ[a] or Greek: Seth /sɛθ/) is a god of deserts, storms, disorder, violence, and foreigners in ancient Egyptian religion.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(deity)
As Set could be depicted in the form of a black pig or a wild boar:
The god Set was usually depicted as a man with a head resembling that of the sha, which is why the sha is referred to by Egyptologists as the Set animal or Typhonic beast. When Set was depicted as a human with only the head of the Set animal, he usually had a long, slightly curved nose, and erect ears, squared at the tops. Occasionally he was represented in animal form as the sha itself, with a long, down-turned snout, squared ears, erect forked tail and a canine-like body, although he was also depicted in the form of an onager or as a black pig. Other animals sacred to Set included the antelope, hippopotamus, wild boar, crocodile and scorpion, all of which represented strength, power, protection, or wildness. The sha was also used as a determinative in the names of Set and the goddess Nut, who may be identified with Nephthys, the wife of Set.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_animal
This could be possible as there was an Egyptian influence at that time as we can see on the following two imprints.



Number 12
This imprint of an Achaemenid cylinder seal shows the Egyptian influence as it depicts the Egypt dwarf god Bes.
Bes (/ˈbɛs/; also spelled as Bisu), together with his feminine counterpart Beset, is an ancient Egyptian deity worshipped as a protector of households and, in particular, of mothers, children, and childbirth. Bes later came to be regarded as the defender of everything good and the enemy of all that is bad. Bes may have been a Middle Kingdom import from Nubia or Somalia, and his cult did not become widespread until the beginning of the New Kingdom.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bes
The history of Persian Egypt is divided into three eras:
o Achaemenid Egypt (525–404 BC and 343–332 BC), referring to two periods of Achaemenid rule punctuated by an interval of independence:
1. Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt (525–404 BC), also known as the First Egyptian Satrapy. 2. Thirty-first Dynasty of Egypt (343–332 BC), also known as the Second Egyptian Satrapy.
o Sasanian Egypt (619–629 AD), referring to a period of occupation by the Sasanian Empire (Second Persian Empire), after the Sasanian conquest of Egypt and shortly before the Muslim invasions
Egypt was a rich country, and the Persians had coveted it for more than a millennium. It had been conquered twice by the Achaemenids (525–404 and 343–332 BC, before Alexander's conquest), but the stable and powerful Ptolemaic Kingdom, and then the Roman Empire, kept away Persians from Egypt for much of the Greek, Roman, and Byzantine periods. However, the expansionist designs of the Sasanian King Khosrow II (590–628), taking advantage of a troubled period on the Byzantine side, allowed Persians under the command of Shahrbaraz to conquer Egypt once again (among other parts of the Near East), for a short period (619–629).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Persian_Egypt



Number 13
Here is another imprint of an Achaemenid seal found in West Iran with Egyptian influence: the upper and lower edges of the seal are decorated by a row of the sacred eye (wedjat) symbol of the god Horus.
The Eye of Horus, wedjat eye or udjat eye is a concept and symbol in ancient Egyptian religion that represents well-being, healing, and protection. It derives from the mythical conflict between the god Horus with his rival Set, in which Set tore out or destroyed one or both of Horus's eyes and the eye was subsequently healed or returned to Horus with the assistance of another deity, such as Thoth.
The falcon may be a modification of the constellation ‘The Rooster’:
5 The star behind him: The Rooster (DAR.LUGAL) {Procyon, in Canis Minor}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
It represented Horus:
Horus was represented as a falcon, such as a lanner or peregrine falcon, or as a human with a falcon head. The Eye of Horus is a stylized human or falcon eye. The symbol often includes an
eyebrow, a dark line extending behind the rear corner of the eye, a cheek marking below the center or forward corner of the eye, and a line extending below and toward the rear of the eye that ends in a curl or spiral. The cheek marking resembles that found on many falcons.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Horus
The winged ram may represent the Egyptian god Khnum, who was thought to be the creator of bodies of children:
Khnum or also Romanised Khnemu (/kəˈnuːm/; Ancient Egyptian: 𓎸𓅱𓀭ẖnmw, Koinē Greek: Χνοῦβις) was one of the earliest-known Egyptian deities, originally the god of the source of the Nile. Since the annual flooding of the Nile brought with it silt and clay, and its water brought life to its
surroundings, he was thought to be the creator of the bodies of human children, which he made at a potter's wheel, from clay, and placed in their mothers' wombs. He was later described as having moulded the other deities, and he had the titles ‘Divine Potter’ and ‘Lord of created things from himself’.
In art, Khnum was usually depicted as a ram-headed man at a potter's wheel, with recently created children's bodies standing on the wheel. He was also shown holding a jar from which flowed a stream of water.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khnum
And thus, the above imprint indicates that a child engendered in ‘The Rooster’ was born in Aries.



Number 14
All in all, the winged disk, depicted on top of this imprint, can represent the Iran god Faravahar, the Assyrian god Ashur, as well as the Egypt god Ra-Horakhty. The boar can represent the Achaemenid god Verethragna, the Sumerian ‘Na Stone’ or the Egyptian god Set. The Lancer can represent the opponent of Verethragna, the Sumerian god Ninurta, as well as the Egyptian god Horus. Because the culture of Assyria/Sumer, of Egypt and Zoroaster were present in Iran at that time.
Number 14a
Here Horus defeats Set



Number 15
Once more, this hunting scene consists of three constellations;
On the left the lance represents the constellation ‘The Lance’.
6 The Lance (KAK.SI.SA), the spear of the great hero Ninurta [Procyon - or Sirius] {Alphard in Hydra with Monoceros as the lance}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
The dog represents the constellation Canis Major.
And the boar represents 'The Wild Boar':
22 The Wild Boar (EN.TE.NA.BAR.CHUM), d.NIN.GIR.SU {Centaurus?}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
So, the special thing about this imprint is that it can be 'read' in three different ways and also has three different meanings. Nevertheless, everyone understands that the boar indicates that a child is conceived in 'The Wild Boar' and the lance indicates that the same child is born in 'The Lance'.
The next cylinder seal with Indus inscription shows a hunting scene which looks more or less similar to the hunting scene on the above Iran imprint. Nevertheless it has a different meaning.



Number 16
The hunting scene may be described in the Rig Veda hymn 8-66 as well as in hymn 10-86:
‘Thou, Indra, heedless passest by the ill Vrsakapi hath wrought; Yet nowhere else thou findest place wherein to drink the Soma juice. Supreme is Indra over all. What hath he done to injure thee, this tawny beast Vrsakapi, With whom thou art so angry now? What is the votary's foodful store? Supreme is Indra over all. Soon may the hound who hunts the boar seize him and bite him in the car’.
The archer may represent Indra: the Rig Veda hymn 8-66 describes that he slew the ravening boar with his bow and arrow:
‘All these things Visnu brought, the Lord of ample stride whom thou hadst sent- A hundred buffaloes, a brew of rice and milk: and Indra, slew the ravening boar most deadly is thy bow, successful, fashioned well: good is thine arrow, decked with gold’.
The dog may represent Sarama. When Indra smote away the floods' obstructer Vritra she went before Indra as we read in hymn 4-16:
‘He smote away the floods' obstructer, Vritra; Earth, conscious, lent her aid to speed thy thunder. Thou sentest forth the waters of the ocean, as Lord through power and might, O daring Hero. When, Much-invoked! the water's rock thou cleftest, Sarama showed herself and went before thee. Hymned by Angirases, bursting the cowstalls, much strength thou foundest for us as our leader.’
Sarama is a dog goddess:
Early Rig-Vedic works do not depict Sarama as canine, but later Vedic mythologies and interpretations usually show her as a bitch. She is described as the mother of all dogs.’
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarama
The boar may represent Vritra: in the Rig Veda hymn 1-121 he is called ‘the boar who lay amid the waters’:
‘The mighty Heaven and Earth, those bright expanses that have no wheels, joyed, Indra, at thine exploit. Vritra, the boar who lay amid the waters, to sleep thou sentest with thy mighty thunder.’
All together this hunting scene may show that with the help of the dog goddess Sarama the storm god Indra kills Vritra with his bow and arrow.
Like on the Afghanistan seal this hunting scene consists of three constellations;
1. On the right the hunter represents the constellation Orion (Hunter). 2. The dog represents the constellation Canis Major. 3. But the swine represents the Sumerian constellation the Swine, Damu (Probably Delphinus.)
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
Orion and Canis Major indicate March and the Swine indicates December. Although there is no child depicted at all the two months may indicate that a prince was engendered in March and that he was born in December. The inscription tells about the same story.



Number 17
This will be the imprint of a swineherd's seal. In Sumerian literature, a boar or pig is rarely mentioned:
A diatribe against Engar-dug
Engar-dug, croaker (?) among singers, a man without good judgment, braggart, ......, a man ......! -open (?) the house, I have a quarrel with you! In appearance a monkey, a rogue, a witness without shame, not accepting a verdict, a slippery place which respected men avoid, despising (?) the leader of the work-force, a man who does not ...... a festival, a pig spattered with mud, ......! Loving crosstalk and deceit, ......, having got stuck into a quarrel he ...... coming out mouthing insults. A warrior on duty but holding back, .......
The debate between Winter and Summer
Summer, the heroic son of Enlil, decided to bring offerings to E-namtila, the house of Enlil. He brought animals, cattle and sheep of the hill, fully grown wild rams, deer and stags, ...... sheep, long-fleeced barley-fed sheep, thick-tailed sheep. Pigs grown fat in the midst of the reedbeds, porcupine, tortoise, turtle, birds brooding in their nests, taken together with their eggs, harvest crops, flour and malt for mixing, butter and milk from cattle-pen and sheepfold, wheat, hulled barley, small beans and large beans gathered in piled-high baskets, onions ...... in their furrows, zaḫadin onions and shallots, seed turnips, cardamom (?), ......, (8 lines missing)-- Summer, the heroic son of Enlil, offered.
But it is a number of times the subject in a proverb:
Proverbs: collection 1
A trough from which the pigs eat.
Proverbs: collection 1
In the seventh month he did not slaughter (?) a pig. In the sixth month he did not put on a new turban.
Proverbs: collection 3
You keep walking around the storehouse like a pig with a morsel in its mouth.
Proverbs: collection 7
He gathered everything for himself, but had to slaughter his pig.
Proverbs: collection 8
A pig digging in the house.
Proverbs: collection 8
A pig which was about to be slaughtered by the pig-butcher squealed. (The butcher said:) ‘Your ancestors and forebears walked this road, and now you too are walking it, so why (?) are you squealing?’



Proverbs: collection 8
He snatches things like a pig, as if for himself, but also for his owner.
Proverbs: collection 8
The pig picks up morsels of bread.
Proverbs: from Nibru
He wipes his bread on the pig.
Proverbs: of unknown provenance
When a fattened pig is about to be slaughtered, one says: ‘Let me replace what I eat.’
Proverbs: of unknown provenance
As the piglet roots around (?), it says: ‘I do not eat for pleasure.’
There is something contradictory with these pigs: a pig itself rummages in the mud and is a filthy beast, but enthusiasts can appreciate his ham:
Proverbs: from Urim
Like a pig spattered with mud.
Proverbs: collection
Let her eat the ham of a pig!
Proverbs: collection 14: c.6.1.14
A pig was carrying something (?): ‘Where is my sow?’ it said. As it neared its fate, it said: ‘It is my dung-spattered (?) food!’
So, when a pig has to lose her sow for slaughter, she regards it as ‘dung-spattered (?) food, to make her loss bearable.’.

He comments that, in any case, the name may well be of Iranian origin, and it seems likely to assume the original form ending in ‘*aka-’ (a common hypocoristic suffix), but nowhere, as far as he knows, is an equivalent form attested. The uncertainity or variety in the reading is caused by the fact that there are different ductuses of Aramaic (lupidary/cursive, Western/Eastern, fifth century/fourth century, etc.).

Number 4 Museum number: 132877 Description: Mottled orange and yellow-brown limestone cylinder seal; crowned figure standing before an animal and symbols. The personage faces left in full profile, his beard is barely discernible but his hair, in a full bunch at the nape of his neck, is striated; he wears a dentate crown and is dressed in the Persian robe with shortened back skirt, and the pendant sleeve is depicted from the side in an inverted tear-drop with the left arm appearing as a band across or beneath the sleeve material; he carries on his back a bow and quiver case decorated with two long swinging tassels; he carries a vessel (?) in his left hand and in his right hand he may be holding a flower which he raises towards the winged bust symbol (of Ahura Mazda in disc). A boar paces towards the left, his snout lowered; its back bristles are indicated by a notched outline along its back ending in a horn-like projection above its forehead, its tail is curled up and round, gouged hollows emphasize its eye and shoulder, while a 'ladder' pattern covers the rib section and there are curving lines over the haunch. Above the boar, and facing right, hovers the winged bust depicted in the same manner as the personage, the straight wings have wide upper sections and above and below them scroll-like appendages emerge; the crescent is behind the winged bust; the engraving around the head and face of the personage appears rather deep and may have been cut deeper than had originally been intended. Cultures/periods Achaemenid (Persepolitan, Early/Mature) Made in: Asia Materials: limestone Dimensions: Diameter: 0.90 centimetres, Height: 2 centimetres Curator's comments: According to catalogue ‘there appear to be no provenanced examples, but



there are three fairly close comparisions .....’ two in Porada 1948 and one in Lambert 1979. This seal ‘has a more ritualistic approach in that the animal does not confront the personage who in turn carries no weapon in his hand. Porada has categorised one object as a possible forgery, but the four seals, all in soft stone and in linear style, show a remarkable similarity in their design, with the figure in the unusual stance of full profile, while the pendant sleeves on three of the seals have the same shape’.

Number 6 British Museum number 102557 Description Black limestone cylinder seal; figure (king?) in combat with two animals, and a third animal. The personage faces left, with torso presented frontally, in a half-kneeling position, with his bent leg noticeably curved; his short, pointed beard and hair in a small bun at the nape of his neck are faintly striated; he wears an abbreviated dentate crown and is dressed in a Persian robe with extra 'ties at the waist, on his back he carries a full quiver decorated with swinging tassels. The personage draws a curvilinear bow, aiming an arrow towards a fleeing lioness, its head regardant and upright tail curved at the tip; beneath the lioness, a boar with pointed snout and short, angled tail charges towards the right; between the contestants is suspended a reversed caprid with beard and short, horizontal, notched horn and stubby tail. A crescent is placed above. The musculature of the three animals is defined by lines and 'ladder' markings along the bodies while the muzzle of the lioness, the eyes, hip-and-shoulder joints, together with the dugs of lioness, are emphasized by the small and gouged hollows; the boar's body bristles are depicted by an outline of short, faint, diagonal lines along the crest of the back; some minor chipping on the upper edge and surface. Cultures/periods: Achaemenid (Persepolitan, Early/Mature) Made in: Asia Materials: limestone Dimensions: Diameter: Diameter: 1.35 centimetres, Height: Height: 2.55 centimetres Curator's comments: According to Merrillees catalogue ‘this two-tier arrangement is like that ... on a bitumen cylinder from the 'Ville Royale' at Susa, on a yellow limestone cylinder from Kish and a number of unprovenanced examples. John Boardman (personal communication) has pointed out that the dugs are misplaced and should be in the groin and not along the belly as for a dog; this depiction is common in Greece and in the east’.

Cultures/periods: Achaemenid (Mixed I, Archaic/Court) Made in: Asia Materials: limestone Dimensions: Diameter: Diameter: 1.10 - 1.30 centimetres Height: Height: 2.75 centimetres Inscription language: Semitic Inscription script: Aramaic Inscription note: Semitic? Aramaic? Four Aramaic letters are to be read dextroversely (ie. from left to right on the impression) as ‘'m'k’ and were probably the work of an inexperienced seal-cutter. The presence of the 'ayin sign seems reason enough for excluding an Iranian name and in all probability the name is Semitic (R. Schmitt, personal communication). Professor Ran Zadok comments ‘The presence of ' is a good reason for thinking the name is Semitic; it is not otherwise found except in rare Aramaic spellings of Anatolian names, presumably rendering a laryngeal. ‘'m'k apparently starts with a preformative ' - and may derive from ‘m-'-k’. In West Semitic this root has the following meaning : to press, squeeze, crush; in addition the meaning - to overcome (in wrestling) is found in Arabic. Names denoting bodily qualifications, including defects, are attested in the West Semitic onamasticon.
Number 12 British Museum Number: 89133 Description: Heavily translucent, red cornelian cylinder seal; two figures (priests?) with Bes, symbol and inscription. Two identical personages (priests?) stand opposite each other with torsos presented frontally; striations and circular curls mark their square-tipped beards and hair bunched at the nape of the neck, they are dressed in the Persian robe with a knotted, waist-fastening with two hanging ends; beneath the long garments they seem to be wearing trousers (?) and their shoes have straps; they raise their arms, with hands spread out to support the winged disc above them. The long, straight wings, on each side of the encircled disc, have a double central ridge with the feathers singled out along the lower edge, ending in slightly splayed tips; three rows of feathers mark the tail and from each side emerges scroll-like appendages; above the disc are two curled projections. Between the personages stands the dwarf-god Bes, frontally presented; he has large ears and full side-whiskers, he wears a feather crown and a chest medallion of a lion's head, and he is dressed in a short pleated kilt over which hangs his protuberant abdomen; he holds a lotus bloom in each raised fist. At the side is a framed inscription in eight horizontal lines (the last three of which are damaged). Traces of line borders above and below; chipped and worn along both edges, with a large piece out of the lower edge and surface eliminating part of the engraving; the surface is worn.

Number 13 British Museum number128865 Description: showing a bird, ritual object and winged animal. A falcon stands facing right, with carefully engraved hooked beak, round eye and ruff, folded wings with the different overlap of feathers indicated by four rows of dots along the upper part and then four graduating panels, each marked by fine parallel lines; the tail is similarly marked; the softer fluffy feathers over the oblongshaped lower abdomen and upper legs are shown by fine curved oblique lines and the talons are depicted with fine drill-holes. The incense burner consists of a columnar stand with a widened or circular base, marked by transverse striations, on its fluted, capped top is fitted a bowl with a twotiered lid attached by a chain to the top of the column; the lid and chain are marked with drill-holes. On the other side of the incense burner, a winged goat or ibex leaps forward, also to right, with forelegs straight out and hind legs on the ground close to the burner; it has a short pointed beard, side tufts and a ridged mane along the crest of the neck and its long notched horn curves up and back, with the central portion divided into two sections, the inner one decorated by a row of dots (comparable to peas in a pod), and from the narrow, lower ridge, the double rows of feathers are singled out by very fine lines splayed round at the tips; the modelling is strong with finely depicted haunch, joints, leg muscles and sinews while the rib area is marked out by an emphasized curved projection emerging from beneath the wing, to which are attached five slightly curving oblique lines; the short, stubby tail lies close to the haunch. The upper and lower edges of the seal are decorated by a row of the sacred eye symbol of the god Horus; fine workmanship; some minor chipping along the edge.
