The Wonder of the Skies
The sight of a truly dark night sky is simply breathtaking. In the modern world
it is denied to all but those who still live, or might occasionally venture, well be
yond the glare of city lights and the effects of atmospheric pollution. For people
in the past, though, the panoply of thousands of stars was a familiar sight. Some
twinkled particularly brightly; others hovered on the borderline of visibility. A
few were tinted orange or blue. They formed distinct patterns that moved
around but never changed. The Milky Way was a familiar sight to all, snaking
across the heavens with its light and dark patches forming recognizable shapes.
The sky also contained numerous isolated faint and fuzzy objects (nebulae), fixed
among the stars, as well as bright wandering stars (planets), and of course the
moon, dominating the night sky, lighting the way by night, and rendering many
of its fainter companions temporarily invisible. Added to all this was the occa
sional appearance of something rare or totally unexpected: a shower of meteors
(shooting stars), a lunar eclipse, an aurora (at high latitudes), or—more seldom
still—a comet (often perceived as a tailed or plumed star) or a new star (nova).
The exact appearance of the heavenly vault differed from place to place and
time to time. Whether it was visible on a particular night was dependent, of
course, upon local weather conditions. However, the visual impact of the sky on
a clear night was always stunning, and even in the cloudiest and wettest of places
there were a good many clear periods. As a result, human communities the world
over, and for many thousands of years, have recognized familiar patterns and cy
cles of change in the skies, as well as unexpected sights and events, and struggled
to make sense of them. The inhabitants of the night sky—whether perceived as
animals, fantastical creatures, legendary characters, ancestors, or other entities
were ever present. The cycles of their appearance and disappearance provided the
basis for, and reinforced, countless creation stories and cultural myths.
The lack of opportunity to experience the true night sky is, for a great many
people in the modern Western world, something beyond their control. The same
cannot be said, though, of the daytime sky, and yet few people pay much atten
tion to it beyond worrying about the weather. Only a meager proportion—and

this does not just apply to city-dwellers—could, for example, orient themselves
from the time of day and the position of the sun, or could accurately describe the
way in which the sun’s daily arc through the sky changes with the seasons.
As a result, it can be difficult for us to imagine just how great an impact the
sky, whether by night or day, had upon human cultures in the past. Yet we need
look no further than the many indigenous peoples today for whom the sky con
tinues to be of immense importance. In addition to this, certain world religions
such as Islam continue to tie daily and annual observances very explicitly to the ap
pearance of the sun and moon (see ISLAMIC ASTRONOMY). And one only has to talk
to some of the older people living in rural areas, even in the world’s most densely
populated and developed nations, to discover that an immense amount of practi
cal, everyday sky knowledge was possessed even within living memory. Who, sky
watchers of the past might wonder, could fail to notice the regular cycle of lunar
phases keeping time with the human menstrual cycle? Who could fail to recognize
the changing path taken by the sun through the sky, higher in summer and lower
in winter? Who, even in an unfamiliar place, could fail to be able to tell directions
and hence find their way about by night or day using the sun or stars?
Perceptions of the Skies in the Past
ARCHAEOASTRONOMY can be defined as the study of beliefs and practices con
cerning the sky in the past, especially in prehistory, and the uses to which peo
ple’s knowledge of the skies were put. It has been recognized in recent years as a
legitimate and worthwhile academic pursuit, but it also strikes a popular chord,
bringing together two of the most attractive sciences, archaeology and astron
omy. It combines the excitement of the cosmos with the romance of the past.
Books making spectacular claims about ancient astronomical knowledge often
find themselves on bestseller lists. But why should studying people’s perceptions
of the skies in history, let alone in prehistory, be of particular interest or impor
tance to scholars, not to mention anyone else, in the twenty-first century?
One reason is that archaeoastronomy gives us important insights into how
people in the past made sense of the world within which they dwelt. People’s lives
were governed by observations of objects and events in the world around them.
On one level, it is obvious that human communities needed to keep track of var
ious seasonal markers in order to control and maintain their food supply through
the year. This would be true whether they subsisted by harvesting plants, fruits,
and tubers, by fishing, by hunting, by herding animals or by growing crops, or
(most commonly) by a combination of these. CALENDARS, however rudimentary,
were necessary for survival in all types of human society: for the smallest bands
of hunter-gatherers; for farming villages controlled by local chiefs; and for com
plex urban societies seeking to support the higher social echelons of elite special
ists, craftsmen, priests, and kings.

But humans share a deeper need to understand the world that they inhabit.
This does not necessarily mean seeing humankind (or the human mind) as exist
ing within the “objective reality” of the natural environment, as is the modern sci
entific view, but more generally perceiving the cosmos as a conceptual whole with
oneself and one’s own community embedded within it. In such a view of the
world, the human body, or the dwelling house, or the sacred temple, is often seen
as a microcosm reflecting and reinforcing the nature and structure of the cosmos
as a whole. Such a worldview makes people strive to be at one with the cosmos
of which they are a part and achieve a harmony of existence that enables indi
viduals and whole communities to survive and flourish. This harmony is sustained
by continually observing what is happening in the world and keeping one’s own
actions in tune.
The sky was an integral and prominent part of the perceived cosmos. Its fa
miliar sights and unceasing cycles were part of the fabric of life. Its rhythms were
correlated with the time of day and with the seasons. In fact, although we know
these cycles to be unfailingly regular and reliable, to past peoples they may not
have appeared any more so than a host of other seasonal indicators in the world
around them. The important point for us is that, unlike the rest of their perceived
world, the sky is a part that we can visualize directly. Landscapes change: patterns
of settlement and land use alter, people move around, plants constantly grow and
die. We only have indirect knowledge of the appearance of past landscapes. But
thanks to modern astronomy, we can reconstruct mathematically the actual ap
pearance of the sky (or, at least, the regular aspects of it—that is, the appearance
of the sun, moon, planets, and stars) at any place on earth at any time in the past
and visualize it on a computer display or in a planetarium. This gives us a “direct
view” of a prominent part of the world that was perceived by peoples in the past.
By studying knowledge passed down orally through myth and story, as well
as a variety of other types of evidence available to the historian and the archaeol
ogist, we can begin to appreciate the many different ways in which human soci
eties came to understand what they saw in the skies, and how they came to “use”
that knowledge for cultural ends. The sky could, for instance, affirm the POWER
of cultural elites, as in the case of the Inca rulers, whose right to rule stemmed
from their avowed relationship to the sun god himself (see CEQUE SYSTEM; CUSCO
SUN PILLARS). Then again, it could reinforce the status of a shaman or priest who,
by performing the appropriate rites at the appropriate times, could be seen as able
to affect what happened in the sky—for example by reversing the direction of the
sun at the winter solstice and preventing the days from getting ever shorter and
colder. Likewise, people tend to lay out buildings in tune with the cosmos, in other
words, reflecting perceived links with the wider world (see, for example, NAVAJO
HOGAN; PAWNEE EARTH LODGE). Where these links relate to the sky—for instance,
to the rising or setting position of the sun, moon, or stars—then we have partic
ular hope of recognizing them, since we know where these celestial bodies ap

peared in the past (see HOW THE SKY HAS CHANGED OVER THE CENTURIES). By study
ing architectural alignments upon sky phenomena, we can obtain valuable in
sights into the worldviews that engendered them.
There is no reason investigations of people’s perceptions of the skies should
be limited to past societies, and a field known as ETHNOASTRONOMY has emerged
in recent years alongside archaeoastronomy, concerned with studies of beliefs and
practices relating to the sky among modern indigenous peoples. Since there is no
hard line between past and present, many scholars prefer to merge the two fields
and to speak instead of cultural astronomy. Regardless of how the subject is di
vided up, the study of people’s perceptions of the skies has a deep resonance and
helps us appreciate the richness and diversity of human cognition and belief (see
COGNITIVE ARCHAEOLOGY).
This said, our knowledge of particular practices is always indirect, whether
the evidence we are working with is ethnographic, historical, or archaeological,
and questions of METHODOLOGY are highly important. For example, when study
ing an astronomical alignment (such as a building or temple oriented upon solsti
tial sunrise) it is necessary to have reasonable confidence that the alignment was
actually intentional. This is not self-evident, since everything must, after all, point
somewhere. In the 1970s, an abyss developed between two groups of academics
regarding the interpretation of British megalithic monuments (see MEGALITHIC
MONUMENTS OF BRITAIN AND IRELAND). On the one side were those who paid great
attention to STATISTICAL ANALYSIS but little to anthropological theory and tended
to argue that “MEGALITHIC ASTRONOMY” was highly mathematically sophisticated.
On the other were those who did the reverse and reached the diametrically oppo
site conclusion: that ancient peoples had no interest in the sky at all.
To get past this impasse, it is important to distinguish between “our” sci
ence, which provides tried and tested methods for fairly selecting and assessing ev
idence, and “their” science, the worldview (ancient, historical, or indigenous) we
are interested in (see PALAEOSCIENCE; SCIENCE OR SYMBOLISM?). Those who are
mathematically adept but anthropologically naive tend to try to show, in a pro
prietary way, that people in the past were our intellectual equals by demonstrat
ing that they were capable of sophisticated mathematics and astronomy. The flaw,
and also the irony, in this approach lies in the desire to measure the achievements
of a past society against the yardstick of our own. This tendency, well known to
anthropologists as ETHNOCENTRISM, amounts to putting our own culture on a
pedestal. It is necessary to recognize that the worldview we are studying might
well be logical enough in its own terms even though it does not conform in every
respect to our rationality, since it is built upon different assumptions and princi
ples. A few thousand years is nothing in human evolutionary terms, and thus peo
ple living a few thousand years ago were undoubtedly our intellectual equals:
however, their way of thinking was different. We pay respect to that difference by
trying to understand their way of thinking in its own terms rather than trying to
xii Introduction

make it conform to ours. It is for this reason that many prefer to avoid using the
singular term astronomy to describe ancient peoples’ interest in the skies, speak
ing instead, if they use the term at all, of ancient astronomies.
All people develop a personal view of the world. It is influenced by their own
memories and experiences in which any things that may be perceived—objects,
places, events, people and their actions, other living creatures, and plants—can ac
quire particular meanings, as can the relationships perceived to exist between
them. What is more, among the countless things that make up an individual’s ex
perience, some come to acquire more significance than others, in a selection
process that can seem, to an outsider, highly arbitrary. A “discovery” that seems
important to one person may be entirely overlooked or simply of no interest to
another. Thus one of the Mursi, a modern group of cultivators and herders living
in southwestern Ethiopia, determined the number of days that had elapsed be
tween the planting and first harvesting of his sorghum crop by wearing a cord
round his ankle and tying a new knot in it each day. However, those to whom he
proudly announced the result were mildly surprised that anyone should have
taken so much trouble to deduce something so irrelevant to their daily lives
something that added nothing to their total stock of knowledge about the world.
Groups of people living together do, however, tend to develop common
mindsets—sets of common perceptions and understandings. These worldviews
are reinforced by shared experiences and social convention, and by regular com
munication, which in small groups is likely to take place by means of a common
language. In the framework of modern Western thought, we organize what we
perceive in nature according to the principles of Linnaean classification (deriving
from the work of the eighteenth-century Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus)
that is, into a hierarchical structure of groups (taxa) based upon their observable
characteristics. We also tend to believe that the universe is an empirical reality ex
isting independently of the human mind that can progressively be understood
through rational argument and scientific experimentation. Other worldviews,
however, do not generally classify objects and phenomena into taxa familiar from
a Western viewpoint: categories and relationships are not determined by “objec
tive” criteria but simply by whether enough people agree on them. As a result
there is generally no clear distinction between the sacred and the mundane, the
animate and the inanimate, the empirically real and the fantastic; nor indeed be
tween the terrestrial and the celestial. In traditional cultures, creatures such as
fish-man or bird-woman may be seen as fellow beings, every bit as much a part
of the perceived universe as entities a Westerner would identify as physically real.
As an example, Old Star, chief protector of the inhabitants of the sacred He world
of the Barasana of the Colombian Amazon, is at once a short trumpet, a constel
lation corresponding to ORION, the fierce thunder jaguar, and a human warrior.
The sky is a crucial component in practically every indigenous worldview.
For earlier peoples and for many indigenous groups around the world today, what

we in the modern Western world separate out and categorize as astronomical and
meteorological phenomena were an integral part of the environment as a whole.
This total environment, including things both real and imagined, was the cosmos;
the words COSMOLOGY (as widely used in anthropological literature) and cosmo
visión are broadly synonymous with worldview. In non-Western worldviews, direct
associations between the terrestrial and the celestial are commonplace. A good ex
ample of this is the BARASANA “CATERPILLAR JAGUAR” CONSTELLATION, whose be
havior is believed to relate directly to that of earthly caterpillars, which fall out of
trees and provide an important food source at a certain time of the year.
Myths and Monuments
Where we have first-hand informants or can actually still witness long-standing
cultural practices, we are in the strongest position to recognize aspects of other
worldviews. Examples such as the modern Yucatec Maya village of Yalcobá in
southern Mexico, where the structure of the cosmos is reflected in a whole vari
ety of aspects of social behavior, show just how rich and complex these practices
can be. Yet ethnographers can be misled by informants, especially if they ask the
wrong questions—all too easy if they have very little initial understanding of the
nature of the worldview they are studying. Added to this, sacred information is
often withheld, or the anthropologist may not be at liberty to pass it on. There
is also the additional danger that the ethnographer may succeed, unwittingly, in
influencing the very worldview he or she is trying to investigate, so that a subse
quent investigator is misled into thinking that certain modern knowledge was in
fact indigenous. Finally, most of us are limited to approaching the cultural in
formation indirectly, at best at second hand, which imposes a selectivity that is
not of our choosing and a filter—that of the ethnographer’s interpretations
through which we are forced to view everything.
Historical accounts, whether by indigenous people themselves or by past
ethnographers, are subject to all the problems just mentioned together with some
additional ones. For one thing, an author who is no longer alive cannot be ques
tioned, so there is no possibility of clarification or elaboration. For another, in in
terpreting a historical account it may be critical to appreciate the context in which
it was produced.
Ancient written records directly relating to astronomy exist not only among
the civilizations of the Middle and Far East (see for example CHINESE ASTRON
OMY). Perhaps the most extraordinary example produced in the American conti
nent is the Maya DRESDEN CODEX, a pre-Columbian astronomical (or, more accu
rately, astrological) almanac. Both its complexity and level of detail are
exceptional. In some cultures, other types of recording device encapsulated sacred
information, including astronomical knowledge or calendrical data. One intrigu
ing example is the QUIPU, bundles of knotted strings used in the Inca empire. A
xiv Introduction
Pure Mathematical Physics



much more widespread practice, which did not produce any form of written
record, was to embed sky knowledge and cosmological beliefs within myths that
were transmitted from generation to generation orally. Storytelling may have been
entertaining, but it could also have the deeper purpose of passing on wisdom. Cre
ation myths often served to confirm a community’s rightful place in space and
time, or to establish the genealogical credentials, and hence the social standing, of
a king or leader. (Genealogies were not limited to human forbears. The KUMULIPO,
a 2,000-line long Hawaiian creation chant composed in the eighteenth century, re
counted in detail how chief Ka-‘»-i-mamao was related, ultimately, to everything
in the world.) Some sacred stories were carefully learned and recounted, often in
the context of formal ceremonies. Other tales might change in the telling, bring
ing many variations down to us but leaving intact the essential underlying sub
stance and meaning.
The further we delve into the past, the more we find ourselves limited to the
archaeological record—the material remains of past human activity. Silent align
ments of stone temples and tombs, interplays of sunlight and shade that light up
dark spaces only on rare occasions, symbols with unfathomable meanings but
which resemble the sun or moon or familiar groups of stars—these form many of
the most famous manifestations of ancient astronomy. But they also present the
serious scholar with serious methodological problems. Every oriented structure
must point towards some point on the horizon, and in all likelihood to one or
more identifiable astronomical targets. Similarly, the majority of entrances and
openings will let in a shaft of sunlight at some time of the year and day. The mere
existence of (say) a solar alignment is no guarantee that this meant anything to
the builders of a house, temple, or tomb. Since astronomical alignments can—and
frequently will—occur completely by chance, we must do more than simply “but
terfly collect” them if we are interested in what they actually meant to people in
the past. There are two ways of proceeding: either to seek statistical confirma
tion—for example, by identifying a group of several monuments in which a cer
tain type of astronomical alignment occurs repeatedly—or by finding corroborat
ing archaeological evidence of different forms. An example of the former is the
RECUMBENT STONE CIRCLES of northeast Scotland, which have a consistent orien
tation relating to the moon. Two different examples of the latter, also from Ne
olithic and Bronze Age Britain, are the THORNBOROUGH henges (large round em
banked enclosures) in Yorkshire, England, and the cairns at Balnuaran of Clava
in Inverness, Scotland (see CLAVA CAIRNS).
In some cases, such as pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, we have both archaeo
logical and other forms of evidence, including ethnohistory (accounts recorded
during the early years of European contact), iconography, and written records (see
“BROWN” ARCHAEOASTRONOMY). Integrating these diverse forms of evidence can
be a considerable challenge. This problem is illustrated by the prolonged contro
versy that surrounded the putative Venus alignment at the so-called Governor’s
Introduction xv
Pure Mathematical Physics



Palace at the Maya city of Uxmal (see GOVERNOR’S PALACE AT UXMAL). Inscriptions
on the building attest to a strong interest in the planet Venus, but the apparent
orientation of the building toward an extreme rising point of the planet has gen
erated much debate. In ancient Mesoamerica in general, the historical evidence re
lating to astronomy and calendrics is strong, and the archaeological evidence—for
example in the form of alignments—tends to strengthen and corroborate this. If
it were not for the accounts of the early Spanish chroniclers, the calendrical in
scriptions, and the vital bark books (codices), we would simply have no idea of
the sophistication and complexity of Mesoamerican astronomy.
In other places there can be a finer balance. The origins of a piece of oral his
tory are typically much more obscure than the historical context of written
records or inscriptions. It can be extremely difficult to separate genuine traditions
and stories that stretch back over many generations from more modern inventions
or infiltrations. In Hawai’i, a very rich oral heritage existed until the early nine
teenth century, of which only fragments now survive (see HAWAIIAN CALENDAR;
POLYNESIAN AND MICRONESIAN ASTRONOMY). Yet in assessing the significance of
temple alignments in these islands, some of those surviving fragments may con
tain vital gems of information (see POLYNESIAN TEMPLE PLATFORMS AND ENCLO
SURES). They are of uncertain provenance, so must be used with extreme caution,
but one would be unwise to simply ignore them and revert to statistics alone.
Where the only available evidence is archaeological, it is possible to use
analogies from different cultures where other forms of evidence exist to suggest
interpretations. Thus in the 1970s, the Scottish archaeologist Euan MacKie at
tempted to use the analogy of Maya society to argue (in support of theories, pop
ular at the time, that many of the British megaliths were high-precision observa
tories) for the existence of highly skilled astronomer-priests in Neolithic Britain
(see “MEGALITHIC ASTRONOMY”; “MEGALITHIC” CALENDAR). However, this direct
use of ethnographic or historical analogy is generally fraught with problems.
Most archaeologists concluded, for a variety of reasons, that MacKie’s efforts
were badly misguided. On the other hand, analogies can be very useful in chal
lenging assumptions that might have been made too unquestioningly, and hence
in suggesting new interpretative possibilities. It is generally assumed, for example,
that any people who observed the changing rising and setting position of the sun
on the horizon over the year must have understood that this regulated seasonal
events. Yet while it is true that some of the Mursi, already mentioned, track the
changing rising position of the sun on the horizon, the MURSI CALENDAR is based
upon the moon. The sun is regarded as no more reliable a seasonal indicator than
the behavior of various birds, animals, or plants. The Mursi example stops us
leaping to conclusions about practices in the past by showing us that the range of
possibilities is wider than we might have imagined.
In summary, where we have only archaeological evidence to go on, it may be
possible to gain insights into prehistoric worldviews by recognizing symbolic as

sociations in the material record. Analogy may be useful in the process of inter
pretation, but our conclusions will never be categorical. We can only ever have a
certain degree of belief that a specific association had meaning to a particular
group of people, although our belief may be strengthened or weakened by further
evidence.
From Tally Marks to Calendars
How did people begin to make links between different cycles of activity they ob
served around them and hence begin to understand and control the periodic
changes in the natural world as they perceived it? At what stage did they start
consciously to plan their own actions in accordance with those perceptions?
Groups of people from the earliest times would certainly have varied their
subsistence activities in accordance with the seasons, whether these involved
searching for edible plants and animals, fishing, or hunting. But in this alone they
were little different from many others in the animal kingdom: many birds, after
all, undertake seasonal migrations. Two characteristics that have distinguished
humankind for several tens of thousands of years are people’s capacity for ab
stract thought—making connections between things in order to satisfy the desire
to make sense of them—and the use of symbolic representation to express ideas.
There is ample evidence of the latter in the Upper Palaeolithic, in the form of sys
tematic markings on many small portable objects such as pieces of bone. Their
meaning is much debated, but it has been suggested that some at least represented
rudimentary lunar calendars—tallies of days or some other sort of symbolic no
tation relating to the lunar phase cycle. The most famous example is a fragment
of eagle’s wing found in a cave at Abri Blanchard in southern France, dating to
around 30,000 B.C.E. (see ABRI BLANCHARD BONE). Some much more recent, and
less controversial, examples of possible lunar tallies among hunter-gatherers are
found in rock art from northeastern Mexico. The site of PRESA DE LA MULA, near
Monterrey, is one of two petroglyphs that seem to record counts of days stretch
ing over seven synodic (lunar-phase-cycle) months, divided up according to the
appearance of the moon. However, these designs were not calendars: they were
clearly not intended for regulating future activities. Rather, they were first-hand
observational records, with all the vagaries and imperfections this implies.
Counting days, as such, is unlikely to have been an overriding issue for most
people in the past. They had to be aware of many different cycles of activity in
their lives. One of the most effective ways of keeping track of things is through
myth and appropriately timed ritual performance. These were invariably tied in,
along with many aspects of living and being, with the unchanging entities in the
sky and the ceaseless cycles in which they were seen to move. Stories help describe
the world and explain why things are as they are. Ceremonies serve in a very ac
tive way to affirm the natural order. Stories and ceremonies also involve an ele

ment of control, in that their successful performance, with adherence to strict pro
tocols, is often seen as necessary—even vital—in order to ensure continuity, re
newal, and growth. The appropriate rituals may ensure the arrival of the sun on
a given morning, or bring about the reversal of the sun’s winterward movement
so that it will return and give greater warmth again each spring. Whether per
formed by a lone shaman, by whole communities working in unison, or by a pow
erful priest with the active participation of a controlling elite, rituals, ceremonies,
and other performances can ensure that the order of the cosmos, and of the lives
of the people within it, is duly maintained. The Blessingway and other sacred rites
of the Navajo people are just one example of performances of this kind recorded
in modern times and, in some cases, continuing to the present day, both among
native Americans and among indigenous peoples around the world. The Bless
ingway ceremony serves to ensure good health, prosperity, and so on by prevent
ing misfortune, and involves detailed renditions of the Navajo creation story (see
NAVAJO COSMOLOGY).
What may be an extremely old tradition of myths and performances relates
to the identification of two bears circling around the northern celestial pole. The
evidence to support this assertion, paradoxically, is found in modern oral tradi
tions across Europe. In the Basque country, the bears’ motions around the celes
tial pole are linked to an annual cycle of storytelling and song and dance per
formances involving whole communities. Other variants are found throughout
Europe. Constellation myths within the framework of Greek and Near Eastern
thought form an integral part of the modern Western heritage, but the prevalence
of indigenous bear myths suggests that two circumpolar bears are star figures em
anating from much older cosmological traditions (see SKY BEARS).
In the 1969 book Hamlet’s Mill, Giorgio De Santillana and Hertha Von
Dechend suggested that specific astronomical knowledge—namely the gradual
shifting of the entire mantle of stars over the centuries due to a phenomenon
known as PRECESSION—had been systematically “encoded” in mythological narra
tives all over the world over a period of many millennia. There are various prob
lems with the evidence presented in support of this idea, but there is also a funda
mental difficulty with the idea itself. It presupposes an almost universal concern in
ancient times with a particular concept (precession) familiar to ourselves. This is
very different from arguing that some communities in certain places and times
might have had stable enough cosmologies—sky knowledge passed down accu
rately enough over several generations—to have noticed the gradually changing ap
pearance of the sky and attempted to come to terms with it in one way or another.
The point about the sky bears, on the other hand, is that we may be glimps
ing an ancient framework of understanding very different from the Western one.
According to the American linguist Roslyn Frank, who has investigated the rele
vant European folk traditions in detail, it was a framework in which earthly bears
were venerated. She argues that a human individual playing the role of a bear
xviii Introduction
Pure Mathematical Physics



shaman acted to maintain the cosmic order, organizing the cycle of earthly cere
monial in tune with the annual cycles of the stars. If Frank is right, then we should
not look back to some sort of universal, all-prevailing myth or cosmology, diluted
with time, but rather to one that always coexisted with many others. One would
have to argue that it achieved particular prevalence at high northern latitudes be
cause it brought together what was seen on earth and in the sky in a particularly
effective and understandable way; thus it tended to propagate, encountering and
mixing with other traditions, and eventually leaving traces visible in folk tradi
tions to this very day.
Another way in which a people can affirm the perceived cosmic order is by
carefully timed movement through the landscape. The Lakota people of South
Dakota, for example, traditionally keep their subsistence activities in tune with
other seasonal cycles by moving from one place to another in an annual pattern
that, as they see it, reflects the sun’s movement through the constellations (see
LAKOTA SACRED GEOGRAPHY). Their annual round combines subsistence activities
focused upon the terrestrial movements of the buffalo, with sacred rites focused
upon the celestial movements of the sun. In doing so, it ties together earth, sky,
and people into a comprehensible whole, thereby keeping everything in harmony.
The Mursi of Ethiopia perceive a direct connection between the successive disap
pearance of four bright stars in the southern sky and events on the ground related
to successive floods of the river Omo. This enables them to time their annual mi
gration to the banks of the Omo precisely enough to carry out the vital planting
of their crop of cowpeas within a few days of the river’s final flood.
Can we hope to find, in the material record, evidence of astronomically
timed movement through the landscape in the past? If we could determine the
times of year when certain sites or locations were occupied, and if we could spot
symbolic links between these places and the sun or stars, then it is certainly pos
sible that this could give us some clues. Symbolism relating to a solstice, at a site
that is occupied around the time of solstice, is one possibility. It has been sug
gested that CHACO CANYON in New Mexico was a focus for sacred pilgrimage for
Anasazi (ancestral Pueblo) communities in the surrounding area around the
eleventh century C.E. The archaeological evidence for this is supported by ar
chaeoastronomical evidence that people in the outlying communities used astro
nomical observations to synchronize their convergence upon Chaco. Another,
much older, example of a similar phenomenon occurs at THORNBOROUGH, a group
of Neolithic henges in Yorkshire, England. Here the archaeoastronomical evi
dence consists of a series of alignments upon the rising position of the three stars
of ORION’s belt, suggesting that it might have been the first predawn appearance
(HELIACAL RISE) of this asterism that triggered an annual PILGRIMAGE for an autumn
festival at the henges.
In modern indigenous societies, we see ample evidence of the various ways
in which people strive to harmonize what they do with cycles of events in the nat

ural world. Studies of tally counts, astronomically related myth and ritual per
formance, and patterns of ritual movement have begun to reveal some of the
ways in which this may have been done in the past. CALENDARS—self-consistent
systems of marking time—developed from these more rudimentary perceptions
of correlations between different cycles of activity in nature, and the desire to
keep human activities—ones that we might identify as sacred, mundane, or hav
ing aspects of both—in tune with natural events. The cycles of change of the ce
lestial bodies—regular, immutable, and reliable—are clearly of particular impor
tance in this context.
It is commonly assumed that there is a natural progression of calendrical
development relating to astronomical observation. The first step is to develop a
simple month-by-month calendar based on the phase cycle of the moon, the
most obvious cycle in the night sky. However, because there are between twelve
and thirteen synodic (phase-cycle) months in a solar year, it follows that in or
der to keep in phase with the seasons, one needs to have twelve months in some
years and thirteen in others. The second step, then, is to take note of phenom
ena that are related to the seasons, including astronomical ones, using them to
keep lunar calendars in pace with the seasonal year by inserting or omitting a
month from time to time as required (see LUNAR AND LUNI-SOLAR CALENDARS).
The ancient Egyptians, for example, used the first predawn appearance (helia
cal rise) of Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, to keep the start of the new year
in step with the annual flood of the Nile. Sirius would have been first seen ap
proximately eleven days later in the twelfth month each year. Whenever it did
not appear until the last few days of the twelfth month, then an extra or inter
calary month was added so that it would continue to rise in the final month of
the following year.
A seasonally related phenomenon of particular importance is the changing
rising or setting position of the sun along the horizon (see SOLSTICES, SOLSTITIAL DI
RECTIONS). Once a society recognizes this, they can use it to regulate a solar cal
endar that is entirely independent of the moon. If the horizon is sufficiently dis
tant and contains a good many distinctive points, then such a calendar can quite
easily be kept accurate to within two or three days of the “true” solar year. One
of the classic modern examples of a solar horizon calendar is that of the Hopi peo
ple of Arizona. As first recorded by the ethnographer Alexander Stephen at the
end of the nineteenth century, solar horizon observations were used by the Hopi
both to regulate crop-planting activities and to pinpoint events within an elabo
rate ceremonial calendar (see HOPI CALENDAR AND WORLDVIEW).
The final step in the development of luni-solar calendars is to replace the ad
hoc insertion or omission of intercalary months by a systematic procedure. By
about the fifth century B.C.E., the Babylonians had developed a fixed system
whereby a thirteenth month was inserted into seven different years, in a fixed pat
tern, within every period of nineteen years (see BABYLONIAN ASTRONOMY AND AS
xx Introduction
Pure Mathematical Physics



TROLOGY). This Metonic cycle, named after the Greek astronomer Meton, keeps
the lunar calendar in step with the solar year to within an error of just one day in
every 200 years.
The Babylonian calendar was an impressive achievement made possible by
systematic astronomical observations recorded over many generations. However,
ancient calendars do not inevitably follow the progression just described (and
even in Babylonia itself, calendrical developments were more complicated). The
Mursi yet again provide a good example. They have what, to an outsider, looks
like a thoroughly haphazard calendar in which no one ever seems to know for cer
tain what month it is, although everyone believes there are “experts” around. In
practice, different opinions always exist, and the calendar is effectively adjusted
“on the fly” according to various seasonal markers—though no one is aware that
these adjustments are being made. The calendar is completely self-consistent in its
own terms, and there is no need for intercalary months. The nearby Borana have
a completely different and utterly distinctive luni-stellar calendar that reckons the
time of the month and year by observing the moon in relation to the stars, com
pletely ignoring the sun (see BORANA CALENDAR). The Works part of HESIOD’s
Works and Days describes farmers’ rules of thumb in eighth-century B.C.E. Greece
that related exclusively to seasonal astronomical phenomena such as the heliacal
rising of stars; the lunar phases are only mentioned in the separate Days part. The
Roman civic calendar, upon which the modern (Western) calendar is based, only
emerged from chaos when it ignored the moon completely (see ROMAN ASTRON
OMY AND ASTROLOGY). On the other hand, uncorrected lunar calendars remain of
considerable importance to this day, one of the most obvious examples being the
Islamic calendar (see ISLAMIC ASTRONOMY). Finally, the ancient Mesoamerican cal
endar, arguably the most sophisticated and complex of all the world’s calendars,
operated by combining cycles as diverse as the 365-day year, a 260-day cycle
(whose astronomical derivation, if it is astronomically derived at all, remains un
clear), and the 584-day synodic cycle of the planet Venus (see MESOAMERICAN CAL
ENDAR ROUND).
In short, there is no inevitable path in the development of calendars. Instead,
they advance in diverse ways according to local conditions and needs. This means,
for one thing, that they cannot be used as yardsticks of cultural achievement. It
also means that they cannot be considered as abstractions, divorced from the so
cial context in which they developed and the social needs that they fulfilled. The
Hopi calendar, for example, had (as we would see it) both a pragmatic and a sa
cred function, but from the Hopi perspective it functioned holistically to ensure
the well-being of the community in all respects. Different calendars can have dif
ferent purposes and even run alongside one another, as—it appears—did the reli
gious and administrative calendars in ancient Egypt (see ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CAL
ENDARS). To the historian or archaeologist, understanding the technical aspects of
an ancient calendar is often of limited interest. It is much more intriguing (and of
Introduction xxi
Pure Mathematical Physics



ten much more challenging) to understand how a calendar operated in its social
context, what it meant to people, and what its social implications were.
Modern folk calendars and associated traditions that still exist in many parts
of the world, particularly in rural communities, often preserve an inherently ho
listic worldview, integrating earth and sky in a mixture of what the modern sci
entist would be inclined to view as rationality and superstition. In the Baltic States
of Latvia and Lithuania, for instance, a mixture of prognostications survives that
relate people’s character, health, and happiness to the phase of the moon at the
time of their birth and at important moments in their lives. This Baltic tradition
leads to a related issue: the role of ASTROLOGY. The history of astronomy is clearly
intimately bound up with the history of astrology; the distinction between the two
is only an issue in the context of the modern scientific way of understanding the
world. Taking an anthropological viewpoint, we must realize that systems of
thought including beliefs that we might describe as “astrological” may themselves
constitute ways of understanding the world that are perfectly coherent and logi
cal in their own terms. Thus by considering the biblical skies from the point of
view of the astrologers of the time, rather than simply as modern astronomers, a
very plausible solution has recently been suggested to the riddle of the identity of
the STAR OF BETHLEHEM, which has perplexed astronomers for years.
Ancient peoples generally did not share the modern conception of time as an
abstract entity, as a line along which we move through our lives (see SPACE AND
TIME, ANCIENT PERCEPTIONS OF). The earliest calendars almost certainly did not
come into being as a result of simply conceived astronomical observations under
taken in order to mark the passage of abstract time. They emerged in the context
of complex views of the universe in which many aspects of natural and human ac
tivity were seen as tied together in fundamental ways. This concept is of vital im
portance when we try to interpret archaeological monuments that appear to have
incorporated alignments marking sunrise or sunset on particular calendrical
dates. A fundamental question is: Which regular astronomical events might have
been significant to people in the past? Alongside the SOLSTICES, the EQUINOXES are
widely assumed to have had inherent significance, yet many investigators have
been surprised to discover the absence of equinoctial markers in the culture they
are studying. From the point of view of the observers themselves, however, there
is a clear difference between the two. The solstices are tangible: at these times, the
sun reaches the physical extremes of its motions along the horizon. The SOLSTITIAL
DIRECTIONS mark the boundary between those parts of the horizon where the sun
can rise or set, only passes over, or is never seen. These define a natural division
of the world, as seen from any central point of observation, into four parts. The
equinoxes, on the other hand, would in practice only have been observable as
halfway points between the solstices. They would generally have been no more
likely than any other date in the year to be correlated with any of the other sea
sonal events that would actually have meant something to people. The midpoint,
xxii Introduction
Pure Mathematical Physics



whether in time or space, seems significant only if one views time and space in the
abstract. This is not to deny that particular groups of people in the past may have
chosen to divide the year into four roughly equal divisions, but we can not sim
ply assume that the equinox was a significant calendrical date for all.
Interpreting the Archaeological Record
As we have seen, astronomy helps us learn how the cosmos was perceived and
understood in the past based on evidence we can retrieve from the material
record. The “raw resource” is directly accessible to us: within certain boundaries
of error we can reconstruct the positions of the sun, moon, stars, and planets in
the night sky at any place and any time in the past. This means that we can read
ily identify ways in which ancient architecture could have made reference to ce
lestial objects and events. But we must retain a sense of proportion. The astro
nomical ORIENTATION of a monument, to take an example, might only have
conveyed meaning to a few people around the time of its construction, whereas
the monument would also have been significant to people in many other ways,
communicating meaning by way of its form, the materials used, and other as
pects of its location.
In recent years archaeologists have applied a variety of interpretative ap
proaches to the study of how people in the past conceptualized the LANDSCAPE. Yet
landscape itself is a limiting if not excluding term. Its use reinforces a Western
conceptualization of space that divides the world into three distinct parts—land,
sea, and sky—and then, more often than not, leads us to ignore two out of three
of these. Contrast this concept of landscape with that of the indigenous person
who would, without hesitation, identify numerous connections between objects
and events in the sky and many other aspects of his or her experience. In dealing
with past as well as modern indigenous societies, the term worldview should
mean exactly that: a people’s understanding of the totality of the perceived envi
ronment.
The evidence available to the archaeologist consists of a present-day land
scape containing scattered traces of past human activity, the end result of cen
turies—even millennia—of processes of attrition that have served to modify and
to destroy. Archaeologists can look at the remains of permanent structures such
as houses, tombs, and temples, and examine their location as well as architectural
features that seem to express associations with features in the visible landscape
and objects in the sky. Other human activities leave traces that are fixed in space,
such as rock art (see PRESA DE LA MULA; SWEDISH ROCK ART). Beyond this are nu
merous types of material evidence, such as small artifacts, which are not fixed in
space but may still tell us a great deal in various ways.
A well-tried approach is to try to identify alignments that were deliberately
incorporated in architecture or in the location of manmade structures in relation
Introduction xxiii
Pure Mathematical Physics



to other prominent features in the landscape. The latter approach has been suc
cessful in central Mexico, where the day of sunrise or sunset behind prominent
mountains as viewed from certain pyramids and palaces has been found to corre
late with calendrical ceremonies performed in sanctuaries built on those moun
tains. The hilltop palace of CACAXTLA, built in what is now the Mexican state of
Tlaxcala in the seventh century C.E., was located directly on a preexisting align
ment connecting an older ceremonial site with La Malinche, a prominent volcanic
peak still important today as a source of rain and symbol of fertility. The times in
the year when the sun rose behind this mountain from Cacaxtla and other temples
in the alignment marked two important calendrical festivals and times of ritual pil
grimage. The observances survive, in the form of Christian festivals, to this day.
In this instance ethnohistoric and ethnographic evidence confirms the mean
ing of symbolic alignments. Where such evidence does not exist, identifying mean
ingful alignments is much more problematic. Clearly, it is possible to identify
alignments between manmade structures and natural features that are in fact to
tally fortuitous and had no meaning whatsoever to anyone in the past. One pos
sibility is to look for (what seem to us to have been) the most prominent man
made and natural features in the landscape in order to examine possible
alignments of significance between them. But even this may be misleading. Mursi
sun watchers stand by a favorite boulder or tree to make observations rather than
erecting a more permanent marker that would be evident in the archaeological
record of the future. Many important dates in the Hopi solar horizon calendar are
marked by tiny, inconspicuous skyline notches, while many more conspicuous
horizon features are unused. Furthermore, there is generally no obvious natural
feature (such as a prominent notch or peak) in the solstitial directions, important
as these actually were and are to the Hopi. The reason is that traditional Hopi vil
lages from which observations were made were not located with regard to as
tronomy and calendrics. Walpi, for example, is perched on a narrow cliff-top
mesa: its inhabitants had a given horizon and could not move their position of ob
servation except within very narrow margins in and around the village. They did
make precise horizon observations, but this fact would not be recoverable from
the archaeological record alone. Any future archaeologist proposing that these
particular alignments were significant would be open to the accusation of being
highly selective with the data.
In other cases, however, evidence of horizon observations might be more
readily identifiable in the archaeological record of the future. The Zuni, for ex
ample, had sun-watching stations used for horizon observations prior to the sum
mer solstice. And the inhabitants of the Polynesian island of MANGAREVA estab
lished observation places for noting the summer and winter solstices against
suitable landmarks, such as adjacent islets or mountain ridges, often erecting
stones upon them as foresights. This example bears some similarity to the inter
pretation of many of the British megaliths, erected in the third and second mil
xxiv Introduction

lennia B.C.E., put forward in the mid-twentieth century by the Scottish engineer,
Alexander Thom (see THOM, ALEXANDER). Basing his conclusions upon surveys of
many hundreds of STONE CIRCLES, SHORT STONE ROWS, and single standing stones,
Thom concluded that “megalithic man” had undertaken high-precision observa
tions of the sun and moon using distant mountainous horizons as the observing
instrument. The megaliths, according to Thom, marked where to stand and, in
many cases, pointed out the horizon foresight (such as a conspicuous notch be
tween two mountains) that was to be viewed.
Thom’s results did not stand the test of time. One reason is that his data set
included a wide variety of sites spanning a wide geographical area and a period of
some two millennia (see MEGALITHIC MONUMENTS OF BRITAIN AND IRELAND). Subse
quent analyses that have been restricted to certain areas during particular periods,
and have taken account of a wider range of archaeological evidence, have been
more successful. The Scottish RECUMBENT STONE CIRCLES (RSCs) are particularly en
lightening in this respect. These are a group of several dozen stone circles confined
to an area within about fifty kilometers (thirty miles) of Aberdeen in northeastern
Scotland. Their distinguishing feature is a single recumbent stone flanked by two
tall uprights, which are without exception oriented between west-southwest and
south-southeast, that is, within a quarter of the available horizon. Furthermore,
they are consistently aligned upon the midsummer full moon, suggesting that cer
emonials were carried out there when the midsummer full moon was passing low
over the recumbent stone. This is a conclusion backed up at one excavated site,
Berrybrae, where scatters of quartz and burned flint—white stones whose color is
similar to the light of the moon—were found in the vicinity of the recumbent stone.
However, more recent excavations at other sites have confounded the issue.
The RSCs were modest monuments, apparently serving relatively small
farming communities around 2000 B.C.E. Aligning them upon the moon at an im
portant time, and also if possible upon a conspicuous feature in the landscape
such as a prominent hill (as is the case at many but not all of the circles), tied them
into nature in two different ways. This almost certainly served to reinforce the sa
cred status of the monuments for the people they served. It seems likely that soci
ety in this area at the time never became centrally organized and controlled, and
this has bequeathed to us a set of small, similar monuments among which we can
easily spot repeated patterns. This enables us to catch a glimpse of some aspects
of ritual tradition and worldview—a glimpse that points strongly to the moon as
a principal focus of attention. Similar conclusions have been reached in investiga
tions of SHORT STONE ROWS in southwest Ireland.
A step on from identifying and interpreting monumental alignments is to ask
why the monuments were placed where they were and not elsewhere. Answering
this question involves a detailed investigation of whole landscapes to identify po
tential alternative locations. Such an investigation was carried out in the late
1980s in the northern part of the Isle of Mull, off the west coast of Scotland. It

showed that a set of five stone rows found there, apart from being consistently
aligned upon the moon, were all placed so that Ben More—the most conspicuous
mountain on the horizon in the area—was on the very margin of visibility, clearly
in sight to one side of each row but completely hidden by intervening ground from
the other. One suggestion is that the stone rows’ main significance was as some
sort of symbolic boundary marker between areas from which this (sacred?) moun
tain was, and was not, visible.
One supposition that emerges from these studies of monuments incorpo
rating astronomical alignments is that many of them became “special” when the
astronomical body in question appeared at the appointed place. At these times,
their sacred power was surely reinforced. Another way in which a similar effect
could be achieved—creating a very considerable visual impact at certain special
times—was through the interplay of sunlight and shadow. Widespread evidence
indicates an interest in creating carefully orchestrated interplays of shadow and
light at sacred places, sometimes producing special effects visible on only very
rare occasions. A famous example occurs at the passage tomb of NEWGRANGE in
Ireland. Here, for a few precious minutes after sunrise on a few days around
winter solstice, the dark interior of the tomb becomes lit up by sunlight shining
directly down the passage. Even in the present day, such hierophanies can cap
ture the imagination and become the focus of great public spectacles, whether
or not they were actually intended by the builders. A case in point involves the
pyramid of KUKULCAN (El Castillo) at Chichen Itza. It contains a staircase on
each of its four sides, and at the base of the northern staircase is the carved head
of a serpent. On days close to the equinoxes, the light of the late afternoon sun
falling across the stepped corner of the pyramid creates the effect of a serpent’s
body, which only “appears” at these times. This spectacle now attracts tens of
thousands of visitors. In contrast to Kukulcan, no serious doubts exist that the
Newgrange hierophany was actually intentional; though, by its nature, it could
never have formed a great public spectacle, since the space inside the tomb was
confined. This dramatic effect was intended for the ancestors, or for ancestral
spirits.
What was the purpose and meaning of such hierophanies? There is no sim
ple answer, but further clues can be found by looking at more modest examples,
often to be found in rock art. By carefully placing rock art designs, sunlight could
be made to play across them at certain times, with impressive effect. A number of
interesting examples are to be found in California, which was densely populated
by hunter-gatherer groups prior to the European conquest. The Luiseño, for ex
ample, had an intense ceremonialism, a rich sky lore, and a calendar regulated by
various astronomical observations. Although their seasonal calendar was lunar
based, they observed and celebrated the solstices, attaching particular importance
to the winter solstice, which they regarded as a time of cosmological crisis. Solar
imagery is evident at various Luiseño rock art sites, and light-and-shadow effects

Pure Mathematical Physics



have been discovered at three or four of them, more than one involving daggers
of sunlight that bisect painted discs.
One of the most famous shadow-and-light phenomena concerns a petroglyph
situated toward the summit of Fajada Butte, in Chaco Canyon (see FAJADA BUTTE
SUN DAGGER). A carved spiral hidden away behind three slabs of rock leaning
against a vertical rock face is occasionally lit up by the light of the sun shining
through cracks in the rocks in front of it. Around noon on the summer solstice,
however, a thoroughly distinctive dagger of light suddenly appears and bisects the
carving. How should this be interpreted? Assuming that the slabs were carefully
placed rather than falling into their positions naturally (and there has been some
debate on this issue), it appears that a good deal of care was taken in positioning
the spirals so that the summer solstice, and possibly other times of the year also,
were clearly marked. The location is difficult to access but good for astronomical
observation. Comparisons with the practices of historic Pueblos suggest that it
might have been a sun shrine—a sacred place where a sun priest came to deposit
offerings at certain important times in the ceremonial year. In this sense it would
have been far more than a simple calendrical device. It was more likely something
that, through its powerful symbolism, helped to affirm the sacredness of this in
accessible place, and by so doing helped to reinforce the power of the person or
people who understood its meaning and had the privilege of using it.
As with astronomical alignments, we again encounter a methodological
problem: just because we observe a shadow-and-light phenomenon does not
mean that it was intended by the builders or had any special significance before
our “discovery” of it. Given any pattern carved on a rock, what are the chances
that the sun will play across it at some time, quite fortuitously, creating an unin
tentional effect? In the case of the Chaco petroglyph, more secure interpretations
can only stem from wider evidence about Anasazi culture, perhaps with valuable
clues from historic and modern Pueblo groups.
A different form of shadow-and-light phenomenon has been noted in Meso
america: the so-called zenith tube. ZENITH TUBES are vertical tubes incorporated in
specialized ceremonial structures that marked the biannual passage of the sun
through the zenith at noon, at which time sunlight could pass directly down the tube
and light a chamber below. One of the most impressive examples is found at the ru
ins of Xochicalco in Mexico, where a tube more than five meters (sixteen feet) long
opens into the roof of a natural cave artificially extended to form a rectangular
gallery with three central pillars. The use of such tubes for the purposes of astro
nomical observation cannot be established with certainty but seems likely given the
known significance of the ZENITH PASSAGE OF THE SUN in Mesoamerica, both from
studies of the ancient Mesoamerican calendar and from modern ethnography.
Displays of light and shadow, especially if they occur only infrequently, can
be highly impressive. It is easy to see how they could have conveyed symbolic
power, reinforcing sacred associations that formed part of the fabric of the pre

vailing worldview. Their presence in the archaeological record has the potential to
reveal aspects of that worldview to us. The power to impress is conveyed to the
modern investigator through direct experience—“being there” and experiencing
the event for oneself has proved popular and is useful in generating tentative in
terpretations. But it also brings dangers. There is considerable potential for us to
experience shadow-and-light phenomena that had no significance whatsoever to
people in the past.
Great monuments also have the power to impress, none more so than STONE
HENGE in England. Over the years it has attracted more than its fair share of the
ories, from the plausible to the plainly ridiculous. However, the general percep
tion prevails that there was some sort of connection between Stonehenge and the
skies, which accounts for its frequent appearance on the front covers of books on
ancient astronomy. In the meantime, archaeological excavations have put some of
these theories in a more secure context. The bluestone and sarsen circles, con
structed around the middle of the third millennium B.C.E., replaced earlier timber
constructions built within a circular ditch and bank that had been completed
some 500 years earlier. The later stone monument was certainly a place of great
power, and the solstitial alignment of the main axis, which all commentators agree
was deliberate, represented a shift of several degrees from the earlier orientation.
The transformation of the monument from timber into stone, the use of exotic
stones from faraway places, and the sheer size and scale of the edifice strongly
suggest a process of enriching the ritual symbolism of the site around 2500 B.C.E.
to legitimize its place at the center of the cosmos and hence its ultimate power.
This transformation probably served in turn to reinforce the earthly power and
influence of a social elite. The change in the axis to incorporate the solar align
ment was almost certainly part of the same process.
Modern Western science is only one of many frameworks of thought within
which people all over the world, from Palaeolithic times to the present day, have
gained an understanding of natural phenomena, including what could be seen in the
sky. Modern science only seems the pinnacle of intellectual achievement from a
Western perspective, and seeing it as such creates a tendency, when trying to com
prehend non-Western modes of understanding, to single out particular “advances,”
seeing them as steps along the road. From an anthropological point of view, it seems
stiflingly restrictive to proceed in this way when we can seek a much broader ap
preciation of different developments in human thought. This can only be achieved
by studying the great many ways in which people have striven to comprehend the
world that they inhabit and the many different contexts—physical and social
within which particular developments in thought have occurred. This applies just as
much to sky knowledge as to all other knowledge. Above all, we need to recognize
the magnificent diversity of human worldviews that has existed through time, and
to respect them for what they were and are, even though we will inevitably continue
to describe them, and try to make sense of them, in the framework of our own.

Using This Book
The entries in this encyclopedia fall into three categories. First, there are those
that elaborate upon some of the key themes and issues relating to ancient as
tronomy, many of which have been introduced above. They include, for exam
ple, LUNAR AND LUNI-SOLAR CALENDARS, PALAEOSCIENCE, and ASTRONOMICAL DAT
ING. Other entries in this category relate to particular objects or phenomena in
the sky and their cultural significance (for example, ORION and LUNAR ECLIPSES).
Also included are broad definitions and explanations of key concepts (such as
ARCHAEOASTRONOMY, COSMOLOGY, and ALIGNMENT STUDIES), brief descriptions of
procedures and techniques (for example, FIELD SURVEY and STATISTICAL ANALYSIS),
and a few people who have been important in the overall development of the
subject, such as SIR NORMAN LOCKYER and ALEXANDER THOM. The second cate
gory comprises case studies of a variety of types of human society, from hunter
gatherer groups to urban city-states, and spanning a chronological and geo
graphical range that stretches from Upper Palaeolithic Europe through Polynesia
and other remote parts of the world prior to European contact. Though the case
studies are far from exhaustive, they have been carefully selected to illustrate
particular issues and themes, with an emphasis upon cultures and places that are
less well known outside the specialist literature of archaeoastronomy. The final
category of entries consists of short, nontechnical explanations of basic concepts
like SOLSTICES, HELIACAL RISE, and DECLINATION. At the end of each entry is a list
of related entries divided into three parts: themes, case studies, and basic con
cepts. Straightforward definitions of terms are given in the glossary.
We have avoided drawing sharp divisions between ancient and modern—di
visions that only serve to mask the rich variety of human ways of understanding
and appreciating the sky. For this reason, we include topics such as CHURCH ORI
ENTATIONS and ASTROLOGY, which extend into relatively recent and even modern
times, together with examples of traditions that live on still among modern in
digenous peoples, such as BARASANA “CATERPILLAR JAGUAR” CONSTELLATION, MURSI
CALENDAR, and PAWNEE COSMOLOGY.

Aboriginal Astronomy
When Captain James Cook first sailed up the east coast of New Holland
(what is now Australia) in 1770, he encountered native people who had lit
tle interest in their strange visitors and none whatsoever in trading—peo
ple who surprised him by being generally unclothed, constructing little in
the way of shelter around their camp fires, and even sleeping in the open.
Yet their lifestyle, while short of so many of the conveniences viewed by Eu
ropeans as essential, also seemed free from many of the cares that accom
panied them. As Cook saw it, the earth and sea satisfied all their needs.
As we now know, the Aboriginal way of life had gradually developed
over many thousands, and indeed tens of thousands, of years. Australia’s first
inhabitants traveled to the continent more than 50,000 years ago from Asia,
via the islands of what is now Indonesia. Despite lower sea levels at that time,
the journey still involved crossing straits as wide as eighty kilometers (fifty
miles) or more. During the long history of the Aboriginal peoples, factors
such as climate change almost certainly caused significant upheavals, but by
the time the Europeans arrived, Aboriginal groups were to be found in all
corners of this vast and largely arid continent. Their lifestyle had become well
adapted to an environment that, from a European perspective, was im
mensely inhospitable. Never settling for long in one place, they lived by gath
ering food, hunting, and (for people in the coastal fringes) fishing. This
hunter-gatherer style of subsistence had never been superseded by agricul
ture, let alone affected by technological innovation such as metallurgy.
Since Aboriginal culture and tradition had developed independently of
the rest of the world for millennia, it is tragic that much of it was utterly de
stroyed in such a short time after the arrival of the Europeans. It is estimated
that at the time of contact there were more than 750 different Aboriginal
languages, few of which now survive. Though our knowledge of the ways
in which different native Australians viewed the world in pre-contact times
is extremely fragmentary, there was clearly considerable diversity between
different groups. Yet it is evident that certain fundamental concepts and
1

principles underlay most Aboriginal systems of thought. The most important
of these is the Dreamtime or Dreaming. The Dreamtime is sometimes por
trayed as a sort of parallel, more fundamental reality in which ancestor spir
its created the world and continue to exist within it. Certain places and paths
through the landscape have deep significance within the Dreamtime. The ac
tions of ancestors are re-enacted in many aspects of life, and oftentimes these
re-enactments involve being at certain places and following certain paths.
Aboriginal peoples identified strongly with the landscape. Some of the
places charged with sacred power were natural, such as distinctive rocks, ter
mite mounds, or water-holes. Others were created, such as “ringed” euca
lyptus trees (branches growing apart were trained together again until they
rejoined, forming a ring in the trunk). In some locations, “stone configura
tions”—constructed arrangements of rocks and boulders—also appear to
mark sacred places in the landscape, especially in regions devoid of other
prominent natural landmarks.
However, to see the Dreaming as something in the Aboriginal mind that
is superimposed upon the physical world is a quintessentially Western view
of things. From an Aboriginal perspective, the motions and actions of the an
cestors are an integral part of the world and can be perceived in places, in
the objects that are found there, in the pathways between them, and in
events that are constantly happening (“signs,” which must be perpetually

Pure Mathematical Physics



watched for). Living people also leave their mark by their passage and con
duct, not necessarily in a way that a Westerner would recognize as “physi
cal,” but by ascribing new meanings to places and pathways in the world.
Naturally that world includes the sky. The actions of the ancestors can also
be perceived in the appearance and motions of the sun, moon, and stars: sky
events affect people, and people affect sky events.
Celestial mythology features extensively in the surviving Aboriginal
cultural heritage. A wealth of stories relate to sky objects, including Orion,
the Pleiades, the Southern Cross and Pointers, and the Magellanic Clouds. A
recent collaboration between ethnographer Hugh Cairns and Yidumduma
(Bill Harney), a senior elder of the Wardaman community in Northern Ter
ritory, has shown how the night sky acts as a repository of ancient traditions
and learning in this community. This learning was taught using song lines
that cross through the constellations just as the so-called dreaming paths
pass through the earthly landscape below.
Extrapolating back in time is much more difficult. Among the few tan
gible remains from earlier epochs, the most ubiquitous are the rock art sites
found in several parts of Australia: over 100,000 such sites have been
recorded. Their dates are generally indeterminable within wide bounds, al
though some may be several thousand or even tens of thousands of years old.
Some include what are clearly depictions of ancestor spirits, people, animals,
and activities such as hunting and dancing, while others are more abstract.
To what extent modern practices can inform us about the meaning and use
of art in the past is a contentious issue. Some contemporary bark paintings
certainly include depictions of the sun, moon, Venus, various constellations,
the Milky Way, or the Magellanic Clouds, although in many cases it would
be impossible to recognize them for what they are if we did not have in
formants to tell us. In some cases we know something of the stories to which
they relate and the context in which they were used to tell those stories. Rock
art, on the other hand, is tied to a particular place. For Yidumduma, rock
art sites are places (but by no means the only places) where ancestor spirits
reside, and the significance of each is revealed in the context of the whole
Wardaman creation story. The sky is an intimate part of this story:
Dreaming for the cosmos, the land and sky together for people that travel. The Creation routes connected to the people on the wall of the rock, and the connection up on the top, on the sky, down the bottom, and how everything is changing in this country. All the animal[s] and . . . the ceremony of the people in the rock . . . and all these other ones divided from the bottom and up to the top in the sky, with all the stars all part of human life from the sky. (Cairns and Yidumduma 2003, p. 31)

Pure Mathematical Physics



Taken out of context, as this example shows, the complexity of the con
nections between the content of rock art, its location, and the sky would
be quite unfathomable to an archaeologist without an informant to inter
pret them.
Can more direct links between rock art and the sky sometimes be evi
dent, even where we lack “the big picture”? A number of rock art sites con
tain inexplicable groupings of round holes or cup marks, which have not, it
seems, arisen naturally; and some of these, it has been suggested, could rep
resent constellations. However, it is disconcertingly easy to fit random collec
tions of cup marks with patterns of stars in the sky if one is prepared to be
sufficiently flexible in one’s selection criteria, so the case remains unproven.
There is little other evidence of direct relationships between rock art motifs
and the appearance of celestial objects, although it has been suggested that the
stylized forms of emu on some panels reflect the shape of the emu in the sky,
a conglomeration of dark clouds in the Milky Way recognized as such in a
number of places across Australia. John Morieson, an Australian archaeoas
tronomer, has suggested that a number of stone configurations in northwest
ern Victoria related directly to the rising or setting sun and incorporated de
liberate alignments toward sunrise or sunset in particular seasons in the year.
There is certainly evidence that a number of different Aboriginal groups
took note of the annual changes in the position of certain stars or constella
tions as indicators of seasonal events that affected their food supply. Arc
turus is the fourth brightest star in the sky. For the Boorong people of north
ern Victoria, this star was Marpeankurrk, the ancestor who discovered
bittur, or termite larvae, a delicious and valuable source of protein available
at a time of year (August and September) when other food sources were
scarce. Every year Marpeankurrk taught the living people when to find the
bittur by appearing in the north during the evening. But night by night she
appeared for a shorter and shorter time until she disappeared completely
and so did the bittur.
Although this is one of many similar examples, there is no evidence of
any Aboriginal group having reckoned time using a calendar based, for ex
ample, on the phase cycle of the moon. Another curious feature of Aborig
inal astronomy—at least, as far as we can tell from the available evidence
is that, despite living in wide open landscapes and having an intimate
knowledge of the skies, Aboriginal peoples do not seem to have used the
stars to navigate at night. Their astronomical knowledge, and their knowl
edge of the world in general, was qualitative rather than quantitative. It
consisted of a rich network of associations confirmed in myth and tied to
places and pathways both in the land and in the sky. Their worldview inte
grated land, sky, and social structure and kept human action intimately in
tune with the cosmos.

Despite our fragmentary knowledge of Aboriginal astronomy, it is of
great importance in showing how sky knowledge among hunter-gatherers
can be rich and complex, despite leaving little or no trace in the material
record. This fact has implications for how we interpret what extremely frag
mentary archaeological evidence we have pertaining to astronomical knowl
edge in Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic times.

Abri Blanchard Bone
The earliest indications of the use of a symbolic notation to represent or vi
sualize an astronomical cycle come from the Upper Palaeolithic period. At
this time, in addition to striking cave art, engravings were made on small
portable objects such as stones and pieces of bone and antler. Thousands of
examples are known. A number of these are in the form of series of marks,
and several were subjected to meticulous microscopic analysis by the Amer
ican researcher Alexander Marshack. He concluded that the marks were
not a simple decoration but carefully accumulated, often using different
tools and techniques, over a period of time.
One famous example is part of an eagle’s wing discovered in a cave at
Abri Blanchard in the Dordogne valley, France. Dated to around 30,000
B.C.E., it contains a series of notched marks in a serpentine pattern. Mar
shack proposed that these represent a tally of days. The assumption is that
the earliest marks are those in the center of the pattern, and that marks were
Abri Blanchard Bone 5
Pure Mathematical Physics



accumulated around existing ones. By following the line outwards and back
and forth, we discover that there are about fifteen marks in each sweep be
fore the direction changes.
The most prominent astronomical cycle is the phase cycle of the moon.
In addition to being readily observable, it coincides with the female men
strual cycle. The moon’s phase cycle is certainly recognized among modern
hunter-gatherer groups, although not necessarily universally (an apparent
exception being Australian Aboriginals). The period of the lunar phase cycle
(synodic month) is between twenty-nine and thirty days, so one interpreta
tion of the Abri Blanchard bone is that it represents a tally in which the days
of the waxing moon are marked off in one direction and those of the wan
ing moon in the other; in other words it forms a rudimentary lunar calendar,
maintained for about two months. Marshack suggested a similar lunar-cal
endar interpretation for patterns on a number of other Upper Palaeolithic
portable artifacts.
Several criticisms can be made of the interpretation of the Abri Blan
chard bone as a lunar calendar. Two assumptions upon which it rests are
that the number of marks between each “turn” in the line was significant
and, second, that this represented the period between successive new or
full moons. How easy might it be to fit other explanations? How can we
judge a particular interpretation against the alternatives? At least one of
the turns is not sharp, which gives greater flexibility in interpretation. Two
of the lines could easily be interpreted as separate straight lines rather than
part of the serpentine pattern. And there is the question of what exactly we
mean by “new moon”: there is a one- or two-day period each month when
the moon is not visible at all (astronomical new moon occurs in the mid
dle of this), but it is the first reappearance of the crescent moon in the
evening sky (the popular concept of “new moon”) that is the most signif
icant event in visual terms, widely recognized even in the today’s world,
from small indigenous groups to major religious calendars. Finally, al
though some of the marks appear round and others crescent-shaped, there
is no apparent correlation between the shape of the marks themselves and
the lunar phases.
All of these points introduce doubts in the interpretation of the Abri
Blanchard bone as a lunar calendar. It is possible to address them by in
creasing the complexity of the explanation: for example, the left-to-right se
quences contain more marks and can be taken to represent the days from full
moon to new moon in the popular sense. But the potential for speculative ar
gument seems endless. Indeed, the underlying microscopic evidence that the
engravings represent tally marks or some other form of notation in the first
place has been vigorously questioned.
And yet the underlying idea—that certain people in the Upper Palae
6 Abri Blanchard Bone
Pure Mathematical Physics



olithic would have recognized the phase cycle of the moon and may have at
tempted to record it—seems plausible enough. One approach would be to
try to ascertain, hypothetically, how easy we would find it to “recognize”
patterns in sets of markings that were in fact unintentional (for instance,
caused by people sharpening tools) or had other meanings entirely. The con
clusions could then be used as the basis for a formal statistical test. Yet even
if lunar tallies or calendars were quite commonplace in the Upper Palae
olithic, they may not have been recorded at all consistently, in which case
any attempt to identify sets of calendrical tallies recorded in a systematic way
would be doomed to failure.
Studies of some of the many other Upper Palaeolithic engraved artifacts
may clarify the issue. One example, another bone fragment known as the Täi
plaque, has been interpreted by Marshack as a more sophisticated lunar cal
endar. And yet more complex designs give us greater flexibility in interpre
tation. This is not to say that such explanations are necessarily misguided,
but rather that assessing them is no trivial matter. Identifying a methodology
that will satisfy both scientists and social scientists is a challenge that has yet
to be met by archaeologists.

Alignment Studies
Archaeoastronomy owes its emergence in the 1970s largely to the furor
caused by the controversial and often spectacular claims made by Alexan
der Thom and others about astronomical alignments at British megalithic
monuments. Although archaeoastronomy itself soon grew to encompass a
much wider range of evidence, “alignment studies” remain at the heart of
a great many archaeoastronomical investigations, particularly those con
cerning prehistoric Europe.
Where we are searching for evidence of astronomical concerns in pre
history, alignments of monumental architecture remain at the forefront of
most investigations. Yet alignments can arise fortuitously, since every ori
ented structure must point somewhere. Hence the importance of repeated
trends, which can be identified and/or verified statistically; good exemplars
are the short stone rows in western Scotland and the recumbent stone circles
in eastern Scotland. (The stone circle at Drombeg in Ireland provides a cau
tionary case study.) On the other hand, where other types of evidence are
available to us (such as written documents or ethnohistory), studies of the
significance of particular alignments may be carried out in a broader context
with little or no need for statistical verification. A good example of this is the
alignment of the so-called Governor’s Palace at the Maya site of Uxmal.
The term alignment studies is not limited to the architecture of large
monuments and public buildings but also includes studies of the layout of
cities, as in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica (Teotihuacan, for example) or
the ancient classical civilizations, and their possible relationships to celes
tial objects.

Altitude
Altitude is the vertical angle between a given direction—such as the direc
tion toward a particular point on the horizon from a given place—and the
horizontal plane through the observer. A positive altitude indicates that the
point being observed is above the observer; if it is below, then the altitude
will be negative. Thus the altitude of a horizon point level with the ob
server is 0°. That of the summit of a high or nearby hill might be as much
8 Alignment Studies

as 5° or 10°, but that of a sea horizon viewed from a high place might be
–0.5° or –1°.
One can also speak of the altitude of a star in the sky, but this will not
generally be the same as the angle of the star above the horizon, since the
horizon altitude will not normally be 0°.
There is considerable confusion between the terms altitude and eleva
tion. Elevation is normally taken to mean the height of a given place above
sea level, but the two terms are quite often transposed, for example when pi
lots speak of the altitude of an airplane to mean its height above sea level
and use an altimeter to measure it, while some engineers and astronomers
use “elevation” to mean “altitude” as we have defined it here.

Ancient Egyptian Calendars
The kingdom of Ancient Egypt existed for over three millennia and for
much of this time was remarkable in having two different calendars in si
multaneous operation. Each arose in response to different social needs and
developed a distinct function. At least, this is the standard interpretation of
the evidence.
The oldest Egyptian calendar was lunar. It arose in Predynastic times
(prior to c. 3000 B.C.E.) from the simple need to keep agriculture in track
with the seasons. Twelve lunar phase-cycle (synodic) months only amount
to 354 days, so a mechanism is needed for adding an additional (inter
calary) month every two to three years in order to keep the calendar in
track with the seasons. It is generally supposed that in Upper Egypt (the
Nile valley) the calendar was regulated by Sothis, or Sirius, whose first ap
pearance before dawn each year (heliacal rise) coincided with the regular
annual flood of the Nile, the most critical event in the agricultural year.
Whenever Sothis was not seen until late in the twelfth month, an additional
(intercalary) month was added.
Some scholars have argued that a lunar calendar had also developed in
dependently in Lower Egypt (the Nile Delta), but that there it was regulated
by observations of the sun. A myth of central importance for the Egyptians
was the daily rebirth of the sun god Ra by the sky goddess Nut, who
stretched from one side of the sky to the other. This legend was played out
Ancient Egyptian Calendars 9
Pure Mathematical Physics



in the sky. If the Milky Way was seen as Nut herself, as has been suggested,
the legend would doubtless have accounted for its shifting position with re
spect to the rising and setting positions of the sun, according to the time of
year. This would have provided the conceptual basis for what we might too
easily see as the purely pragmatic process of keeping track of the seasons
by tracking the movement of the sunrise and sunset along the horizon. When
the two parts of Egypt became unified into a single kingdom, these luni
stellar and luni-solar calendars would have merged.
The Early Dynastic period (c. 3000–2600 B.C.E.) was the time of the
first pharaohs and the development of written records. The lunar calendar
was fine for regulating agricultural activity on a local scale but became un
workable for satisfying the needs of a complex economy and state bureau
cracy. Recording and regulating the movement of perishable commodities,
for example, demanded absolute agreement about the date. Yet the begin
ning of each month, and the insertion of intercalary months, was determined

Pure Mathematical Physics



by observation, and observations could differ; as a result, it was often diffi
cult to be certain either about the month or the day in the month. The result
was the development of a quite independent civil calendar used for adminis
tration purposes. This comprised twelve “months” of exactly thirty days
each, divided into ten-day periods known (rather confusingly, given that the
word is commonly taken to mean “ten years”) as decades, followed by a
five-day period known as the additional or epagomenal days, making a to
tal of 365. Once the calendar was set up, it was defined indefinitely; there
was no need to regulate it by observations of nature. It was so fit for its pur
pose that it survived well beyond the end of ancient Egypt itself and was still
being used by astronomers in medieval times.
It may seem surprising to suggest that the lunar calendar did not die out
when the civil calendar was introduced. Yet this is precisely what has gener
ally been believed for many years, following the work of the great Egyptian
scholar R. A. Parker in the 1940s. According to this view, the purpose of the
lunar calendar became the regulation of religious observances. Responsibil
ity for determining the correct month and day within this calendar, and with
it the timing of religious festivals, became the responsibility of certain priests.
At some stage, and possibly as early as Old Kingdom times (c. 2600–2100
B.C.E.), Egyptians started to use the heliacal rise of other stars to help regu
late the calendar and to develop the system of decans. These were thirty-six
stars or star groups whose heliacal risings occurred in succession, roughly
ten days apart—in other words, marking successive decades (ten-day peri
ods) in the civil calendar. This meant that the two calendars could easily be
synchronized.
Only recently has a different view emerged, proposed by the Spanish
archaeoastronomer Juan Antonio Belmonte. This is that different Egyptian
calendars did not in fact coexist. In Belmonte’s view, sun observations were
used initially to establish the 365-day calendar, but thereafter the dates of lu
nar-related religious festivals were simply established within this calendar,
rather as Christians determine the annual date of Easter to this day.
Whatever the outcome of this debate, it is clear that the decans also her
alded a hugely important innovation: they could be used as “clocks” to mark
the passing of time during the night. Instead of focusing just on the heliacal
rise, that is, on the decan rising immediately before dawn, one simply had to
view the risings of successive decans through the night. On this basis, the
Egyptians were the first to divide the night into approximately equal time in
tervals. Theoretically, at the equinoxes, when sunrise and sunset are exactly
twelve hours apart, eighteen ideally placed decans should rise between sun
set and sunrise at intervals of 40 minutes. In practice, however, the length of
the night varies through the year, and twilight renders the first and last ris
ings invisible. Furthermore, it could not have been possible to find stars to
Ancient Egyptian Calendars 11

use as decans that were precisely evenly spaced across the sky. Finally, the
Egyptian kingdom stretched sufficiently far from north to south for latitude
to make a difference. The most decans that could actually be seen in one
night, during the longest nights of the year around the winter solstice, was
twelve. This fact, it is widely believed, led to the concept of the night being
divided into twelve “hours,” whose length varied through the year, but
which were nonetheless a precursor to the modern concept of dividing the
day-night cycle into twenty-four equal hours. There is a scholarly consensus
on the identification of several of the decans, but the identification of others
remains extremely speculative.
The Egyptian civil calendar was simple, useful, and all-pervasive. It
worked unfailingly for almost three millennia, and although it gradually
slipped with respect to the seasons (historical sources confirm that the civil
new year once more coincided with the heliacal rising of Sirius in C.E. 139),
this never seems to have created a problem during any particular epoch. Not
until the third century B.C.E. was any attempt made to add leap years.

Andean Mountain Shrines
Traditional belief systems that still persist in a number of remote Andean
villages link mountains, ancestor worship, ritual pilgrimage, and the sea as
the ultimate source of water and fertility. The landscape is “animated” in
the sense that unusual or prominent features are perceived to have a super
natural aspect. Local communities often regard themselves as the descen
dents of mountain deities; consequently mountain peaks—and especially
volcanoes—occupy a prominent place in their cosmic beliefs and commu
nal rituals. Mountains and mountain gods are seen as the controllers of
rain, and their summits sometimes remain an important focus of ceremo
nial activity today. These metaphysical convictions do have a foundation in
the physical world, in that prominent mountains have a strong effect on lo
cal meteorological phenomena.
These modern mythologies represent the remnants of belief systems
stretching back at least as far as Inca times. Numerous shrines, both Incaic
and more modern, have been discovered on hills and mountain peaks in
Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. Sea shells and river stones were com
monly offered to deities for water, but more macabre offerings have also
been uncovered: human (including child) sacrifices. We know from the ac
counts of Spanish chroniclers that elaborate pilgrimages were involved in
reaching these sacred places. But the intensity of conviction that motivated
the expeditions still defies the imagination. Offerings have been found on
mountain peaks as high as 6,000 meters (20,000 feet).
There is every reason to believe that some of the mountain pilgrimages
were tied to specific calendrical rituals and that they were astronomically
timed. Broadly similar sets of beliefs and practices in central Mexico provide
more concrete evidence of calendrical and astronomical associations. How
ever, the specific associations that regulated the Andean rituals remain
largely unknown.

Angkor
The ancient Khmer civilization flowered in southeastern Asia for over five
centuries. A number of interacting and competing kingdoms had existed in
the area since the early centuries C.E., and both the Buddhist and Hindu re
ligions had been widely adopted. But in C.E. 802, several of these kingdoms
joined together to form a powerful state. The capital, Angkor, situated in
modern Cambodia, became the center of an empire that, at its height,
stretched over 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from what is now Burma in the
west across Thailand and Laos to central Vietnam in the east, and a similar
distance north to south, from the Khorat plateau in northern Thailand both
to the tip of southern Vietnam and down the long isthmus toward the
Malay peninsula. After the early fourteenth century, the Khmer empire
went into decline and Angkor collapsed. However, a new capital emerged
downstream. Khmer culture endured and in many respects thrived until the
arrival of the Europeans and the establishment of the French Protectorate
in the mid-nineteenth century.
The word Angkor means “Holy City” in Sanskrit. The arrangement of
magnificent buildings and reservoirs (barays) that survives to this day re
sulted from construction projects initiated by a succession of rulers, and in
cludes both Buddhist and Hindu temples, according to the religious persua
sion of the king in question. At its heart is Angkor Thom, a huge square
compound—some 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) on a side—containing a royal
palace surrounded by numerous public buildings, platforms, and courts, and
including two temple-pyramids, the Baphuon and the Bayon. Angkor Thom
is flanked both to the east and west by enormous rectangular reservoirs, each
over 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) long and 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) wide. To the
south is a small hill, Phnom Bakheng (Mighty Mount Ancestor), with a tem
ple on its summit. Beyond that to the south is the most magnificent temple
complex of all: Angkor Wat, arguably the largest and most impressive reli
gious structure ever built. Although it has been a Buddhist temple (wat) for
many centuries, it was originally dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu. Scat
tered in its vicinity, but mostly found close to the western and southern sides
of the East Baray, are a number of additional temple enclosures, including
three that functioned as Buddhist monasteries.
Although it is Angkor Wat’s artistic and architectural splendor that so
impresses the modern visitor, many of the temples built there also expressed
vital principles of cosmic harmony. Some of these expressions are obvious:
the large numbers of towers pointing at heaven; the cardinal orientation of
14 Angkor
Pure Mathematical Physics



the temple precincts and barays; and the westward orientation of Angkor
Wat, generally supposed to express a link between death and the setting
sun, but possibly symbolizing the direction associated with Vishnu. The
central tower of the Bayon—at the center of Angkor Thom, which is itself
at the center of Angkor—represented Mount Meru, the dwelling place of
the gods, placed at the center of a symbolic model of the cosmos. Other
principles and relationships may have been expressed more subtly, encoded
numerically and geometrically in a variety of ways. Thus the Bakheng tem
ple, with seven levels to represent the layers of heaven, takes the form of a
stepped pyramid supporting 108 towers, symmetrically arranged. The visi
tor mounting the central staircase on any side, however, can only see thirty
three of the towers—the number of principal gods in the Hindu pantheon.
The design of Angkor Wat incorporated alignments upon solstitial and
equinoctial sunrise, and it has even been suggested that the dimensions of
the central structure encoded, in Khmer units of measurement, the number
of days in the year. Although many of the specific suggestions are unproven
and controversial, they remain plausible, given the ways in which cosmo
logical principles are known to have been encapsulated in Hindu temples
throughout history and still are today.
The author Graham Hancock has gone further, arguing that the entire
Angkor 15

layout of temples at Angkor had another purpose. It formed a gigantic
model on the ground of the constellation Draco, just as (he and others have
supposed) the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt modeled Orion’s Belt. Although
this may sound like a simple extension of the idea of human constructions
modeling the cosmos, it is ill conceived at a number of levels. For one thing,
the idea of producing literal “maps” of the stars in the sky, as opposed to
symbolic models of the gods in heaven, has no known place in Hindu beliefs
and practice. In other words, this is an idea totally divorced from the social
context in which it is supposed to have operated. Second, the construction
of successive temples would have needed to have conformed to a very spe
cific grand plan conceived before any of the building started and strictly ad
hered to by one ruler after another. Third, in order to make the orientation
fit the appearance of the constellation in the sky, one has to assume that the
plan was conceived around the year 10,500 B.C.E. Though it is not beyond
the bounds of possibility that sacred sites might have been recognized for
one reason and then retained their sacredness, it is sheer fantasy to suggest
that a fixed plan could have been perpetuated for more than 11,000 years.
Likewise, the idea of a “lost golden age” at such an early date flies in the face
of well-established archaeological evidence from all over the world.
But how, then, does one explain the apparent fit of the temple posi
tions with the pattern of stars in Draco? The answer is that apparently im
pressive matches like this can easily arise fortuitously, especially if one is
prepared to be selective with the data. There are many temples at Angkor,
many bright stars in the sky to choose from, and one can project the curved
surface of the sky onto the flat surface of the ground in various ways. Cer
tain temples, such as the Baphuon and Bayon, do not fit stars, and certain
bright stars in the relevant part of Draco, such as Eltanin (γ Dra) and Altais
(δ Dra), do not fit temples. Furthermore, the fit in the remainder of cases is
not always impressive. It is possible to argue that there were inevitable er
rors in the process of identifying the correct location, multiplicities of pur
pose, and other difficulties in practice. But these possibilities (for which
there is no direct evidence) provide no justification for selecting data arbi
trarily in order to obtain more impressive fits. This is a flawed game that
one plays at one’s peril.
The example of Angkor serves to show the severe dangers of seeking
astronomical correlates of spatial patterns in archaeological data too keenly
and taking interpretations far too far without heeding the constraint of cul
tural evidence. We do not need to go to such lengths to acknowledge that as
tronomical and cosmological symbolism was deeply engrained in this ex
traordinary group of monuments.

Antas
Antas are a distinctive type of dolmen concentrated in the Alentejo region
of central Portugal and the bordering provinces of western Spain. Anta in
Portuguese simply means “dolmen,” but the word has been appropriated to
signify a particular method of construction. A large, flattish stone was set
in the ground on its side to act as the backstone. Two further slabs were
then placed upright leaning against it, one on each side, then a further pair
was added with each one leaning against one of the earlier pair, and so on,
to form a chamber with a single entrance. Most commonly, seven stones
were used in total. A flat capstone was finally placed horizontally on top.
Antas vary considerably in size, the smallest chambers being under 2 meters
(6 feet) wide and no more than 1.5 meters (5 feet) high, while the largest
measure over 5 meters (16 feet) wide and 4 meters (13 feet) high. A magnif
icent example of the latter is the Anta Grande do Zambujeiro near Évora.
A remarkable feature of the antas is their pattern of orientation.
Michael Hoskin, a British historian of astronomy, surveyed 177 of them in
the 1990s, using a compass and clinometer to determine their axial orienta
tion (the direction along the axis of symmetry toward the entrance) and their
astronomical potential in terms of the declination of the indicated horizon
point. According to Hoskin, not a single orientation falls outside that part of
the horizon on which the sun rises at some date in the year. Many different
groups of later prehistoric monuments within western Europe show distinc
tive orientation signatures, but the implications of this group’s signature
seem particularly clear: the antas faced sunrise on some day in the year, per
Antas 17

haps the day on which construction commenced.
If so, then we must add a qualification. The spread of orientations does
not correspond to what one would expect if these dolmens were constructed
at random times in the year. If that were the case, we would expect more ori
entations to fall toward the two ends of the solar range (where its rising po
sition changes less from day to day, and so it spends more days) than in the
middle. The actual anta orientations, on the other hand, fall mainly toward the
middle of the range. This could be explained in one of two ways. The first pos
sibility is that they were merely oriented roughly eastwards. In this case, the
fact that the most extreme orientations happen to fall close to the edges of the
solar range, that is, in the solstitial directions, would be seen as purely fortu
itous. The other possibility is that tombs were constructed preferentially at cer
tain times of the year, namely spring and/or autumn. Hoskin suggests the lat
ter, arguing that in the spring and summer the needs of agriculture or animal
herding would take precedence, but if work on dolmen construction com
menced in the fall, it could reliably be completed during the ensuing winter.

Antizenith Passage of the Sun
Just as the sun passes through the zenith, that is, directly overhead, twice a
year as viewed from any location within the tropics, so it also passes twice
a year through the point directly beneath the observer. This point is known
as the antizenith or nadir. The dates of solar antizenith passage occur six
months away from those of zenith passage so that, for example, the anti
zenith passage dates at a location a little way south of the Tropic of Cancer
will be shortly before and after the December solstice.
The antizenith passage of the sun may seem a totally esoteric event
since, unlike zenith passage, it is not directly observable. Yet some human
cultures do seem to have had an interest in identifying the dates of solar an
tizenith passages and marking them with appropriate observances. It has
been suggested, for example, that some of the pillars erected on the western
horizon at the Inca capital city of Cusco were aligned upon sunset on the
day of antizenith passage.

Archaeoastronomy
Archaeoastronomy is best defined as the study of beliefs and practices con
cerning the sky in the past, and especially in prehistory, and the uses to
which people’s knowledge of the skies were put. It can be misleading to
think of archaeoastronomy as the study of ancient astronomy, since people
in the past might have related to the sky in very different ways from people
in the modern Western world. For this reason many people prefer to avoid
the word astronomy altogether. Some speak of astronomies to emphasize
Archaeoastronomy 19
Pure Mathematical Physics



this point, as is evident in the title of books such as Astronomies and Cul
tures (Ruggles and Saunders 1993).
There have been scientific investigations of the possible astronomical
significance of spectacular ancient monuments ever since the later nineteenth
century—in the work of Sir Norman Lockyer and Alexander Thom, for ex
ample. However, the term archaeoastronomy has only been in existence
since 1969 and soon thereafter came to take on a much broader meaning.
Some popular authors such as Gerald Hawkins, whose book Stonehenge De
coded brought Stonehenge into the limelight in the mid-1960s, preferred the
term astro-archaeology, and this for some became synonymous with align
ment studies, causing a good deal of confusion that has still not entirely
abated. Nonetheless, it was archaeoastronomy that emerged as a recognized
academic “interdiscipline” a decade later, marked most significantly by the
appearance of two academic journals: Archaeoastronomy: The Journal of
the Center for Archaeoastronomy in the US and, in the UK, the Archaeoas
tronomy supplement to the Journal for the History of Astronomy. It was also
signaled by a landmark international conference in archaeoastronomy at
Oxford in 1981, the first of a series that has continued ever since.
By that time, archaeoastronomy had already expanded beyond the
mere study of monumental alignments. This development was led from the
Americas in the 1970s, particularly by studies of astronomy in pre
Columbian Mesoamerica. These studies leaned heavily upon ethnohistorical
evidence—the writings of chroniclers in the early years after European con
tact and conquest—and also, at least in the case of the Maya, upon written
evidence in the form of native “books,” most notably the Dresden Codex.
Alignment studies formed an important part of the new integrated approach
to studying Mesoamerican archaeoastronomy but did not drive it. On the
other hand, European and especially British archaeoastronomers in the
1970s were largely obsessed with archaeological and statistical reappraisals
of Alexander Thom’s work and were busy developing formal fieldwork pro
cedures and quantitative techniques for resolving the huge controversy sur
rounding Thom’s conclusions. The American archaeoastronomer Anthony
Aveni would later come to characterize these two contrasting approaches
within archaeoastronomy as “brown” and “green,” after the colors of the
covers of the two volumes (Archaeoastronomy in the New World and Ar
chaeoastronomy in the Old World, respectively) that emerged from the 1981
Oxford conference. Finding the right balance between these two method
ological approaches remains one of the major challenges for archaeoastron
omy to this day.
Archaeoastronomers, then, are prepared to consider a range of types of
evidence—not simply archaeological—and they certainly do not restrict
themselves to alignments of monuments. In this sense the word archaeoas
20 Archaeoastronomy
Pure Mathematical Physics



tronomy is misleading, even though it is the term that has stuck. Further
more, there is no clear boundary between the past and present. Almost from
the outset, “brown” archaeoastronomers who studied astronomical tradi
tions within North America realized that myths and traditions surviving in
modern indigenous Native American groups could be highly relevant to our
understanding of astronomical traditions of the past. When we study reports
of ethnographers who worked, say, fifty years ago on a tradition that has
since died out, it is clearly pointless to worry about whether to classify this
as ethnohistory or ethnography. We may even be able to identify longer
threads of continuity stretching from the past into the present, so that, for
example, the study of a modern Andean village such as Misminay in Peru
may give us some insights into worldviews prevailing in Incaic or even pre
Incaic times. In short, what was once (and sometimes still is) identified as
ethnoastronomy blends seamlessly into archaeoastronomy. Many would
prefer simply to combine the two fields of study, referring to them together
by a term such as cultural astronomy.
Why was archaeoastronomy so controversial in its formative days in
the 1960s and 1970s? Partly because Thom’s own interpretations, though
based upon high-quality surveys of many hundreds of British megalithic
sites and supported by rigorous statistical analysis, struck most archaeolo
gists as clear examples of ethnocentrism. In seeing prehistoric Britain as
populated by “megalithic man” whom he described as “a competent engi
neer with an extensive knowledge of practical geometry,” Thom was merely
seeing his own reflection in the past, the skeptics claimed. In like manner,
they pointed out, several prominent astronomers were seeing their own re
flections when they described Stonehenge as a sophisticated observatory
and eclipse predictor. But there was also a deeper reason. In the 1970s, most
archaeologists in the forefront of theoretical developments were trying to
describe the actions of human communities in prehistory and the processes
of social change in terms of human responses to ecological or environmen
tal constraints. These “processual archaeologists” saw no reason why pre
historic people would have bothered incorporating astronomical align
ments into communal monuments.
In the decades that followed, both archaeoastronomy and theoretical
archaeology moved forward. Archaeoastronomy ceased to be dominated by
astronomers and began to incorporate more archaeologists and anthropol
ogists. This would, at the very least, help to avoid naive pitfalls such as eth
nocentrism. As a result, archaeoastronomy began to lose its cavalier atti
tude toward the body of theory that had been developed (and was
continuing to develop) within archaeology and anthropology for interpret
ing the actions of any past community from what we can find in their ma
terial remains. At the same time, the so-called “post-processual” revolution
Archaeoastronomy 21
Pure Mathematical Physics



was taking place in theoretical archaeology. A new generation of archaeol
ogists was beginning to confront issues such as cognition. What was going
on in people’s minds, claimed these interpretative archaeologists, was just
as vital in determining people’s actions in the past as any environmental
constraints. Put another way, how a group of people viewed the world
their cosmology—was just as important in determining their actions as
what a modern archaeologist might consider “rational” considerations.
This conclusion was supported by numerous case studies from modern in
digenous communities such as the Hopi and Pawnee in North America. To
speak of “rational” behavior is itself ethnocentric, since what we consider
rational is a product of our own worldview.
Why are archaeoastronomy (and ethnoastronomy) worth doing? If we
want to understand more about why certain human communities did what
they did in the past, then we need to try to understand aspects of their cos
mologies—the ways in which they perceived the world. Astronomy is an es
sential part of nearly every cosmology, because all human communities have
a sky, and the sky and the objects in it form an integral part of the perceived
world. The objects in the night sky are immutable, regular, reliable, pre
dictable; for communities who did not live inside brightly lit buildings and
whose skies were not polluted by modern city lights, they were there for peo
ple to watch and contemplate night after night, season after season. They be
come imbued with meaning.
But what different groups of people perceive as important in the sky,
and what significance they ascribe to it, is highly culture-dependent. Two
good examples that illustrate this in different ways are the calendar of the
Borana of Ethiopia, and the emu “dark cloud constellation” recognized
by certain Aboriginal groups in Australia. Nevertheless, people generally
try to keep their actions in harmony with the cosmos as they perceive it,
which may be the reason many prehistoric monuments were deliberately
aligned with objects in the wider landscape, including objects in the sky.
Recognizing associations that certain human communities considered im
portant can help us understand something of the worldviews that gave rise
to them.
The advantage that the sky holds for us in trying to spot such associ
ations is that it forms a part of the ancient environment that is directly ac
cessible to us, unlike the terrestrial landscape, which is often transitory. We
can use modern astronomy to reconstruct, with considerable accuracy, the
appearance of the night sky at any place and time, including the motions
of the sun, moon, stars, and planets. And this capability offers a consider
able advantage, whether we are concerned with myths and beliefs relating
to the sky, monumental alignments upon celestial objects, or other kinds
of evidence.

Archaeotopography
One of the criticisms of archaeoastronomy is that archaeoastronomers who
investigate the reasons why ancient buildings and monuments were situated
and oriented as they are often seem concerned only with the possibility that
the main influencing factors were astronomical. But many different consid
erations, some quite unrelated to astronomy, can determine the orientation
of a monument. One possibility is alignment based on prominent topo
graphic features in the surrounding landscape. Accordingly, the term ar
chaeotopography was coined by Michael Hoskin in 1997 to describe the
collection of orientation data, as opposed to its (exclusively astronomical)
interpretation. However, since the term would seem, similarly, to imply a
necessarily topographical interpretation, and since topographical and as
tronomical motivations are only two among numerous possible reasons for
orienting a structure in a particular direction, the term is rather misleading
and has not been adopted widely.

Astrology
To a modern astronomer, astrology is anathema. The idea that there can be
any direct connection between the configuration or appearance of distant
heavenly bodies in the sky and current or future events in the terrestrial
world flies in the face of laws of physics that have been established beyond
question over many centuries. This is not to deny that in a few cases an as
trological relationship might actually have a physical basis: some claim, for
example, that a correlation can exist between the growth of plants and the
phase of the moon, because the level of moisture in the soil is related to the
lunar phase through a tidal effect.
From the perspective of the archaeologist or anthropologist, whose ul
timate interest is in human behavior rather than the laws of the universe,
whether such an argument is scientifically verifiable or not is not the point.
What interests these scientists is the fact that people throughout the ages
have drawn direct connections between the appearance of the sky and events
on earth, and that this forms an integral part of their understanding of how
the world works. Even in the modern Western world, popular astrology rep

well be far closer to the ways people throughout history have managed to
make sense of the world than the explanations provided by modern science.
Outside the Western scientific tradition there is no meaningful distinc
tion between astronomy and astrology; indeed, archaeoastronomy might
equally well be named archaeoastrology. Modern indigenous worldviews
(cosmologies) commonly feature the idea that good fortune on earth de
pends upon keeping human action in harmony with what is happening in
the skies, and there is every reason to assume that this has been true since
early prehistory.
The term astrology can be applied to three rather different but not en
tirely separable ways in which people have perceived connections between
the configuration of the heavens and events on earth: the belief that partic
ular celestial configurations can portend future events; the belief that they
can determine or influence the characteristics and lives of people, most com
monly at their moment of birth; and the belief that they are directly con
nected to (that is, influence and/or reflect) current terrestrial events. Each
type of perceived connection could provoke a variety of actions in response
to certain observed celestial events.
The belief that what is seen in the sky may foreshadow the future—typ
ically stemming, as for the ancient Greeks, from a belief that it can indicate
the intentions of the gods—underlies celestial divination: the use of observa
tions of sky phenomena to predict future earthly events. Such a belief is very
widespread in human history. Unique, unexpected, and imposing events such
as solar and lunar eclipses were widely seen as portents of disaster. But more
regular celestial events also indicated auspicious or inauspicious times for
planting crops, having children, going to war, and so on. In city-state or em
pire, astronomers and astrologers were employed to identify good and bad
omens for the benefit of their nations and their rulers. This happened in an
cient Babylonia, China, Greece, and Rome, as well as in pre-Columbian
Mesoamerica. Observation was followed by prognosis (interpretation) and
then by action (prescription). A good example of celestial divination is found
in the early Chinese artifacts known as oracle bones. Oracle bone inscrip
tions (a subset of which relate to astronomical observations) followed a pre
scribed format: a preface describing the action taken by the diviner was fol
lowed by the resulting prognostication and then by a verification describing
what actually came to pass.
Predictability did not necessarily detract from the divinatory power of
a celestial event. The motions of the five visible planets are regular and pre
dictable, though quite complex. Planetary astrology, which can assign div
inatory significance to the cycles of appearance of particular planets as well
as to their positions with respect to the background stars and constellations
and even to one another, extends back to Babylonian times. The Maya went
Astrology 25
Pure Mathematical Physics



to extraordinary lengths to reduce the workings of the cosmos to a series of
interacting regular cycles. The Dresden Codex—a surviving almanac con
taining tabulations of the cycles of appearance of the moon, Venus and pos
sibly Mars, and even of lunar eclipses—seems to have been an attempt to
make the various motions of the heavenly bodies predictable. In doing so,
the Maya reached a remarkable level of mathematical sophistication, yet
their ultimate motive seems to have remained divinatory. For the ancient
Chinese, on the other hand, predicting celestial events through systematic
observations and recording fell within the domain of calendrics. This disci
pline acted almost independently of, and in some senses in competition with,
astrology. Here, once lunar eclipses began to become predictable around the
year 0, they lost their divinatory significance.
The idea that people’s lives can be permanently influenced by the ce
lestial—and particularly the planetary—configurations at the moment of
their birth is one of the defining characteristics of modern astrology, and
also one that modern scientists find particularly indigestible. (It should be
said that planetary birth charts go far beyond, and are considerably more
complex than, the popular perception of horoscopes based solely upon the
sun’s position within the zodiac at birth [“birth sign”].) Planetary birth
charts have their origins in ancient Babylonia and reached an apex in
Greece and Rome. When astrologers began to generate horoscopes, this
fundamentally altered their role. Instead of observing the skies and waiting
for calamitous astronomical events, they were now required to work out
planetary configurations at specified moments in the past, something that
demanded considerable technical skill. Given the particularity of the idea of
the planetary birth chart as against the myriad ways one might envision the
influence of the celestial bodies on human lives, it is surprising that the
practice has proved so persistent.
Insofar as it maintains that a person’s destiny is determined or influenced
by the configuration of the heavens at the time of their birth, horoscopic as
trology is actually a form of divination. It also introduces awkward issues
about free will: if one’s fate is already sealed, there seems little point in trying
to alter it. However, variants are evident in modern folklore that largely over
come this problem. Thus in the Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia, well into
the twentieth century, it was commonly believed among rural communities
that the phase of the moon at birth influenced various aspects of a person’s
character—their propensity to strength or timidity, cleverness, long life, a joy
ful or gloomy disposition, and so on. But such characteristics could be mod
ified throughout life by choosing, for example, the correct phase of the moon
for weaning, baptism, marriage, or building a house.
The most fundamental connection between objects and events in the
sky and those on earth that we might term astrological relates to the here

and now. Belief in the direct interconnectedness of things is evident among
modern indigenous communities and surely extended far back into prehis
tory. Modern examples include the Barasana of the Colombian Amazon,
who understand that the celestial caterpillar causes the proliferation of
earthly caterpillars; the Mursi of Ethiopia, for whom the flooding of the river
they call waar can be determined, without going down to the banks, by the
behavior of the star of the same name; and those native Hawaiians who still
carry on the ancient practice of planting taro and other crops according to
the day of the month in the traditional calendar (i.e., the phase of the moon).
The extent to which such mental connections might be considered astrolog
ical is arguable, but if our interest is in the practices themselves, and what
was going on in the minds of the people who practiced them, then the ques
tion is largely irrelevant—as irrelevant as the question of which practices
might have a rational basis in modern scientific terms. What one might
choose to term science and what one might choose to term astrology are
both rather subjective in the context of an alternative rationality, and the dis
tinction between them is certainly meaningless.

Astronomical Dating
Is it possible to date an archaeological site by astronomical means? In the
ory, the answer is yes, for if we can identify an alignment and the intended
Astronomical Dating 27
Pure Mathematical Physics



astronomical target, measure where the alignment points, and then use
modern astronomy to calculate where that event occurred at different times
in the past, then we can fit the best date to the alignment. Stellar alignments
would seem to be most promising, because the rising and setting positions
of most stars change significantly over the centuries owing to precession.
The rising and setting position of the sun at the solstices and the moon at
the standstill limits also alter with time, although by much less, owing to
the slow change in the obliquity of the ecliptic.
In practice, however, astronomical dating is rife with pitfalls. The main
one is that we rarely have reliable (e.g., historical) evidence to tell us either
that a particular alignment was actually deliberate, or what is was aligned
upon in the first place. Where we do have historical evidence, we are likely
to know the date fairly accurately already. (A case where we do have some
historical evidence, but not as much as we might like, and the alignment does
tell us something, is the Venus alignment of the Governor’s Palace at the
Maya city of Uxmal.)
More often, we are dealing with prehistoric structures where we have
no evidence other than the alignments themselves. If we find an alignment
that we suspect to be stellar, we can try different stars and different dates to
see if any combination fits particularly well. The problem here is that if, say,
we are willing to consider the fifteen brightest stars and a five-hundred-year
date range, then there is approximately a one-in-three chance that we will be
able to find a star and a date to fit any alignment. It is frighteningly easy,
then, to fit a star and a date fortuitously and made all the easier when we
consider that only rarely does one single alignment at a particular monument
stand out as the obvious astronomical candidate. In order to be fair with the
data—one of the most fundamental methodological principles—we should
consider all possible alignments. Added to this is the problem of extinction
(the dimming of a star at low altitude due to the earth’s atmosphere), which
may mean that most if not all of our fifteen stars wouldn’t have been visible
all the way down to the horizon in the first place. If we are willing to pos
tulate (as some people have done) that structures were aligned upon the
point of appearance or disappearance of a star rather than its actual rising
and setting point, it increases the chances of our being able to fit a date and
star fortuitously to any given alignment (especially at high latitudes, where
the astronomical bodies rise and set at a fairly shallow angle). Overall, the
potential for circular argument is obvious.
Yet despite these problems, there have been cases where postulated stel
lar alignments can help in the process of dating a site. One relates to the
Pyramids of Giza in Egypt and another to a perplexing later prehistoric sanc
tuary in Mallorca, Son Mas.
Solar and lunar alignments don’t suffer from these problems but have
28 Astronomical Dating

others of their own, mainly that the change over time is very small. The
change in the declination of the solstitial sun, for example, amounts to
only about one arc minute per century. This means that only if we have
good reason to suspect that a solstitial alignment had very high precision,
such as that envisaged by Alexander Thom at British megalithic sites, can
such an alignment be used to indicate a date accurate to within a few cen
turies. Even then, variations in refraction may provide an insurmountable
obstacle.

Avebury
Situated in Wiltshire, England, a few kilometers south of the modern town
of Swindon, Avebury is one of the largest and most impressive Later Ne
olithic henge monuments in Britain. Built around the middle of the third mil
lennium B.C.E., it measures some 350 meters (1,150 feet) across and sur
rounds an entire modern village. The outer ditch and bank, when first
constructed, were some 9 meters (30 feet) deep and 8 meters (25 feet) high,
respectively, and it is estimated that almost a hundred stones encircled the in
terior. There were also two inner circles, each around 100 meters (300 feet)
in diameter. At the center of the northernmost of these was a configuration
of three massive stones arranged like three of the four sides of a huge rec
tangular box, known as the Cove. Running away from two of the four en
trances of the henge, to the west and south, were two long stone avenues.
Much of the first 800 meters (half mile) of the latter (the Kennet Avenue) sur
vives, but it originally ran for over 2.3 kilometers (1.5 miles), connecting
Avebury to a site whose construction had commenced many centuries ear
lier: a set of concentric timber circles (possibly a roofed building) later re
placed by two circles of small stones, known as the Sanctuary.
Surprisingly, given the obvious importance of the monumental land
scape in and around Avebury in Later Neolithic times, few astronomical
Avebury 29

alignments have ever been claimed here. Alexander Thom’s only interest in
the site was geometrical. The British archaeologist Aubrey Burl has sug
gested that the Cove was aligned upon the most northerly rising position of
the moon, but the few other known examples of coves show no astronomi
cal consistency.

Axial Stone Circles
Axial stone circles (ASCs), or more correctly axial-stone circles, are a dis
tinctive type of stone circle found only in the southwestern corner of Ire
land, in counties Cork and Kerry. Only one other regional group of stone
circles bears any resemblance to the axial stone circles: the recumbent stone

circles (RSCs) found several hundred kilometers away on the opposite side
of the British Isles, in northeastern Scotland. The Irish axial stone circles
(ASCs), like their Scottish counterparts, consist of a single stone placed on
its side, with all the other stones being set upright. Without exception, this
recumbent stone is found in the southwestern or western part of the circle.
But unlike the typical Scottish RSC, the recumbent in Irish ASCs is modest
in size. The remaining stones in the circle tend to increase (not decrease, as
with the RSCs) in height around to the opposite side, where we find a pair
of uprights, generally the tallest, known as portals, because it is easy to
imagine them forming an entrance into the circle. All of the remaining
stones are placed symmetrically in pairs about the axis passing between the
portals, across the circle and through the middle of the recumbent stone.
This distinctive symmetry means, for one thing, that there is always an odd
number of stones in these circles (from five to nineteen). Perhaps more im
portantly, it also emphasizes the axial orientation. This raises the intriguing
question of why it seems to have been so important to orient this axis in a
westerly or southwesterly direction (taken from the portals toward the re
cumbent stone).
The nature of the link between the two groups of monuments is un
known. The Scottish RSCs appear to be older, dating perhaps toward the
end of the third millennium B.C.E., while the ASCs appear to extend well into
the second millennium. However, secure archaeological dating evidence is
still scarce. Postulating a direct link, some authors refer to the axial stone cir
cles as recumbent stone circles; others warn against prejudging the nature of
the interrelationship between the two groups and argue in favor of a dis
tinctive term for a distinctive group of monuments.
Despite some systematic differences, the strong resemblance—both in
form and orientation—between these two geographically separate groups of
stone circles is undeniable. It is perhaps surprising, then, that when we look
more closely at the individual orientations of the ASCs we find that—quite
unlike the RSCs—they were not guided by particular topographic or astro
nomical considerations in any consistent way. Unlike their Scottish counter
parts, where there is a clear preference for a reasonably distant horizon be
hind the recumbent, the ASCs are found in a variety of topographic
situations, some with high ground rising close behind the recumbent and
blocking the distant view completely. And unlike the RSCs, where there is a
consistent pattern of orientation in relation to the moon, the Irish sites show
no consistent pattern in relation to any astronomical body.
The lesson to be learned here is that a variety of considerations may
have influenced the location and orientation of any prehistoric ritual monu
ment, including topographic factors (relationships to prominent natural fea
tures such as visible mountains, sacred places, water sources, and so on) as
Axial Stone Circles 31
Pure Mathematical Physics



well as the heavenly bodies. In different places and different times, different
considerations might have held sway according to the dominant tradition.
While some elements of prevailing traditions may be carried forward from
place to place and through time, others may be modified or be abandoned.
The sky forms only one part of a much bigger picture, even where we do
have clear and consistent astronomical alignments. Whatever the links be
tween these two very distinctive stone circle traditions at the opposite sides
of Scotland and Ireland, it is clear that the strong astronomical (and specifi
cally, lunar) associations of the Scottish RSCs were not transmitted across to
their Irish counterparts.
The lack of consistent astronomy among the axial stone circles does not
necessarily mean that one or two individual examples could not have been
deliberately astronomically oriented, for reasons specific to a particular
place and time. The most quoted examples are Drombeg, near Ros Ó gCair
bre (Ross Carbery) on the south coast of County Cork, a well-preserved cir
cle whose axis points toward midwinter sunset; and nearby Bohonagh,
which faces more or less due west and has been claimed as aligned upon sun
set at the equinox. However, the fact that Drombeg is the only one of sev
eral dozen large axial stone circles with a clear solstitial alignment must raise
the possibility that this could have arisen by chance, and the equinoctial in
32 Axial Stone Circles

terpretation of Bohonagh is subject to certain difficulties that pertain to all
putative equinoctial alignments.

Azimuth
Azimuth means the bearing of a direction—such as that toward a particular
point on the horizon from a given place—measured clockwise around from
due north. Thus the azimuth of due north is 0°, that of due east is 90°, that
of due south 180°, and that of due west 270°. The azimuth of a point one
degree to the west of north is 359°. Azimuth is measured in the horizontal
plane through the observer. To fully specify the direction of an observed
point, one must also specify the vertical angle or altitude of the point.
It is possible to specify the position of a star or other object in the sky
by its azimuth and altitude, but this will change with time owing to the di
urnal motion of the celestial sphere. Even at a given moment, the azimuth
and altitude values of a particular star will be different for observers at dif
ferent places on the earth.

Aztec Sacred Geography
The Aztec (also known as the Nahua, or Mexica) empire—the last of the
great Mesoamerican civilizations—dominated the highlands of central
Mexico at the time of the arrival of Hernando Cortés in 1519. It had risen
to power following a series of military conquests just a century or two ear
lier and maintained economic control by extracting tributes in the form of
foodstuffs and raw materials (as well as personal services) from conquered
populations. The Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, situated at the center of
Aztec Sacred Geography 33
Pure Mathematical Physics



present-day Mexico City on an island approached along three long cause
ways, had an estimated population of 250,000. The mass sacrifices to their
war and sun god Huitzilopochtli, which took place at the great Templo
Mayor in the center of the city, are legendary.
The landscape around the Aztec capital is characterized by strings of
mountains and towering volcanoes that surround and dominate flat valleys,
creating obvious associations between mountains, clouds, rains, fogs, thun
derstorms, springs, and rivers. Under the valley floors and mountain slopes
are numerous caves created by ancient lava flows. And before time took its
toll and the suburbs of Mexico City spread through the landscape, the terrain
was also peppered with magnificent human constructions, both the temples
of the Aztecs themselves and the conspicuous remains of earlier temples dat
ing back to the Preclassic period (at least as far as the mid-first millennium
B.C.E.). This combination created, in the Aztec mind, a vibrant perceived
world strewn with the abodes of powerful spirits: mountains were sources of
water and rain; caves were entrances to the underworld; and the huge cere
monial center of Teotihuacan with its enormous pyramids, a thousand years
old by this time, was itself seen as a magnificent creation of the gods.
Tributes to the gods had to be made in the appropriate place but also
at the correct time. One of the most critical actions was to appease Tlaloc,
the god of rain and fertility, and persuade him to send water for the year’s
maize crop. Petitions to Tlaloc were timed in relation to calendar festivals
and often involved the sacrifice of children. Thus on the first day of the
month Atlcahualo (in the 365-day calendrical cycle or xihuitl), or around the
middle of February in the Gregorian calendar at the time of the Conquest,
the bodies of sacrificed children were thrown into caves close to mountain
sanctuaries, since the water was thought to remain there, inside the moun
tain, until released by the gods as rain. On the summit of Mount Tlaloc it
self, at an elevation of more than 4,000 meters (13,000 feet), was a shrine
containing an idol of the rain god where the nobles from Tenochtitlan and
adjacent cities converged during a great festival in the month Hueytozoztli,
at the end of April. Here, a young boy was sacrificed while, in a comple
mentary ceremony taking place at a nearby lake, a similar fate awaited a
young girl, who was appropriately dressed in blue.
Many different calendrically timed rituals such as these, taking place all
over the Aztec empire, generated a network of relationships in people’s
minds between sacred places in the landscape (particularly mountains), the
activities that took place there, and the timing of those activities. Evidence
suggests that those perceptions were reinforced both by the positioning of
temples in the landscape and by solar alignments deliberately built into those
temples. It has been proposed that the Templo Mayor was (at least approx
imately) aligned upon Cerro Tlaloc on the horizon to the east, that the sun
34 Aztec Sacred Geography
Pure Mathematical Physics



would have risen more or less behind that mountain on the equinox, and
that two prominent mountains on the eastern horizon from Cerro Tlaloc it
self, across the next valley, aligned with sunrise on two important days when
mountain ceremonies were taking place on that peak. More recent work sug
gests that the later phases of the temple were in fact oriented upon sunset at
the feast of Tlacaxipehualiztli, which coincided with the Julian vernal equi
nox in 1519 and was duly recorded by the chronicler Motolinia. Whatever
the details in this case, the combination of ethnohistorical accounts relating
to the nature and timing of ceremonies, archaeological evidence of votive of
ferings at sites such as mountain shrines, and archaeoastronomical data on
orientations and alignments makes a convincing case that many relation
ships such as these were real enough in the Aztec mind.

Babylonian Astronomy and Astrology
Ancient Babylonia occupies a pivotal place in the history of modern sci
entific astronomy. In great part this is due to the conscientious nature of
the astronomical observations that were made there and the meticulous
way in which they were recorded for generation after generation. In time,
the existence of a huge, cumulative database of past observations made
possible the development of mathematically based rules for predicting fu
ture events. The Babylonian legacy of careful observation and recording
combined with mathematical modeling went on to influence developments
in ancient Greece and beyond. The other reason ancient Babylonia is so
important to modern historians of astronomy is the fortunate choice of
medium on which many of the ancient astronomical observations (along
with many other documents) were recorded. The method used was to
press wedge-shaped marks into smooth, damp tablets of clay using a sty
lus. Subsequently, the tablets were dried in the sun or fired in kilns for per
manence. Clay tablets do not tend to disintegrate with time like (say)
parchments or papyri and are unaffected by subsequent fire, so they fre
quently survived the looting or destruction of buildings and other cata
clysmic events of history. The Babylonian cuneiform script was deciphered
in the nineteenth century. In short, many high-quality records have sur
vived, and they can be read.
The ancient city-state of Babylon lay some 90 kilometers (55 miles)
south of modern Baghdad. Its power and influence came to cover all of
lower (southern) Mesopotamia—the region of modern Iraq between the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers down to the Persian Gulf—in the eighteenth cen
tury B.C.E., after which it followed a turbulent history under a succession of
dynasties until its conquest by the Persians in 539 B.C.E. Subsequently, Baby
lon became part of greater empires: the Persian until 331 B.C.E., when it was
conquered by Alexander the Great; then (after Alexander’s death) the Se
leucid Empire; it ultimately fell to the Romans in 63 B.C.E. The latest known
cuneiform tablet dates to C.E. 75.

Most of the written evidence that comes down to us is in the form of
clay tablets from the Seleucid period from 311 B.C.E. onwards. Those in
cluding astronomical data are of various types: astronomical diaries con
taining nightly observations; records of sightings of astronomical events such
as planetary conjunctions and eclipses; and (increasingly with time) al
manacs containing predictions of the length of the month, the positions of
the planets among the fixed stars, and many other things. These documents
demonstrate beautifully how the systematic accumulation of carefully
recorded passive observations led in time to the ability to predict using math
ematical models. One thing that made this development possible was the
Babylonian system for representing numbers: like ours it used a fixed base,
but instead of ten, the base was sixty. In other words, each “digit”—itself a
set of strokes representing tens and ones—represented a value from zero to
fifty-nine, with subsequent digits representing “units,” multiples of sixty,
multiples of sixty times sixty, and so on. (The Maya, in contrast, used a base
of twenty.)
In the Babylonian calendar, the new day began at sunset and the new
month began when the thin crescent moon was first sighted in the evening
sky after sunset. Back in the third millennium B.C.E., two calendars seem to
have existed in parallel: an “ideal” calendar that was theoretical, with each
month containing thirty days, and a common calendar based on actual lu
nar observations. The first of these calendars is used in early clay tablets that
are essentially business documents: this is hardly surprising, since people had
to agree on the day something had been signed or a commitment had been
made, and this could not be dependent upon the vagaries of whether or not
the new crescent moon had been seen (which could be a matter of some dis
pute, especially if it had been cloudy in certain places at critical times). This
civil calendar needed to be the same all over Babylonia and not subject to
disputes between different local officials.
Nonetheless, it seems that the actual astronomical calendar (rather than
the abstract “ideal” calendar) was used for civil purposes from the second
millennium B.C.E. onwards, despite the attendant problems. Gradually, the
analysis of accumulated observations of first sightings of the new crescent
moon enabled Babylonian astronomers to develop mathematical “rules of
thumb” that permitted month lengths to be accurately and reliably pre
dicted. Furthermore, by about the fifth century B.C.E., the nineteen-month
(Metonic) intercalation cycle had been discovered and established. It pro
vided a rule whereby the additional (intercalary) months needed to keep the
lunar calendar in step with the seasonal (solar) year could be added in a me
chanical, deterministic, yet reliable way. Astronomers no longer had to de
pend upon independent astronomical observations, such as the heliacal ris
ing of Sirius.

One of the most remarkable consequences of the Babylonian as
tronomers’ attention to detail and the sheer volume of records that they ac
cumulated over many generations was the recognition of the so-called Saros
cycle: it described the fact that if a lunar eclipse occurs, others will tend to fol
low at regular intervals of eighteen years and eleven days for many centuries
thereafter. This discovery was no mean feat, since approximately forty differ
ent Saros cycles run simultaneously, and the conditions for visibility of any
particular eclipse vary considerably—many are completely invisible from any
given location on the earth (if they occur during daytime, for example). They
simply cannot be revealed by casual observations of lunar eclipses over a few
years or even decades, even if clear skies were permanently assured.
In view of its undoubted influence on the development of modern as
tronomy, it is tempting to view the Babylonian tradition as the birthplace of
scientific investigation of the heavens. But this would be highly misleading.
The main motivation for the Babylonians’ intense interest in the skies was
astrological. Different days in the common calendar were associated with
different prognostications, and by the seventh century B.C.E., scholars were
advising the Assyrian king of the calendrical omens. A particular concern
was the issue of whether the forthcoming month would have twenty-nine or
thirty days. Other concerns included the length of day and night, the helia
cal events of stars, the positions of the planets, and of course the occurrence
of solar and lunar eclipses. One of the most important series of celestially re
lated clay tablets has become known as the Enuma Anu Enlil, meaning
“When [the great gods] Anu and Enlil . . .” (the first line of the text). This
document, which dates to around the end of the second or the beginning of
the first millennium B.C.E., runs to seventy tablets, and multiple copies exist.
It contains around seven thousand omens accumulated from past experience
and provides advice as to whether certain celestial configurations and
events—signals from the gods—would indicate their pleasure or displeasure.
This was not astrology in the sense that celestial configurations were
perceived as the direct cause of terrestrial events (although this did become
a widespread philosophy from the fourth century B.C.E. onwards in Hel
lenistic Greece) but rather that they provided portents of events that could
then, if necessary, be averted by taking appropriate action. In this, astro
nomical predictions were used along with a variety of other forms of div
ination.
Ancient Babylonia was also the birthplace of modern horoscopic as
trology, or at least the earliest known example of the belief in the predictive
capabilities of charts recording planetary positions at the moment of a per
son’s birth. (Actually, the horoscopes of modern popular astrology represent
a revival of this belief rather than any sort of continuity of tradition.) An im
portant prerequisite was the division of the zodiac (through which the plan

ets move) into twelve regions of equal size. Birth charts began to appear in
the second half of the first millennium B.C.E. and represented a move away
from the astrologers having to watch the skies passively, waiting for omens
to appear, to the more active pursuit (performed on demand) of calculating
where the planets would have been among the stars at a particular time. It
also represented a shift away from observational astronomy toward inten
sive mathematics. It is ironic, in view of the way in which modern astrology
is seen as the very antithesis of modern science—irrational and unscientific
that this astrological innovation in Babylonian times necessitated making
full use of the most up-to-date scientific knowledge and methods that had
been developed by this time.
From the late third century B.C.E. onward, two fundamentally different
schools of thought emerged for generating predictions from the extensive
records of existing observations. These seem to have coexisted throughout
the final few centuries of ancient Babylon (until the late first century C.E.), to
judge by two types of works—mathematical ephemerides and almanacs
known as Goal Year Texts—that were evidently produced in parallel. The
ephemerides represent the height of Babylonian scientific achievement, using
sophisticated mathematical models to predict phenomena of the moon and
planets with remarkable accuracy. The Goal Year Texts, on the other hand
each one a sort of astrological handbook for a given year—seem to represent
an independent tradition of prediction based upon repeating cycles that had
been discovered by studying the existing diaries of observations (the Saros
cycle was one of these).
There is a great deal still to be learned about the nature of astronomi
cal and astrological knowledge in ancient Babylonia and the social context
in which it operated. Though about three thousand fragments of clay tablets
containing astronomical information are currently known to exist, a huge
amount of basic data simply remains unexplored. There are tens of thou
sands of fragments of clay tablets in the British Museum alone, many tens of
thousands more in other museums around the world, and untold quantities
still buried under the ground in modern Iraq. Since a sizeable proportion of
the clay tablets that have been studied contain astronomical information,
there is every reason to expect the same to be true in the future. And while
many of the museum specimens are of unknown provenance, only eventu
ally having found their way into the public domain after progressing along
tortuous routes, some of those still waiting to be discovered may be exca
vated in a context that will yield valuable archaeological information about
their broader function and significance.

Ballochroy
Ballochroy is one of many hundreds of small megalithic monuments found
in western Britain. The casual visitor is unlikely to be greatly impressed at
the sight of it: a row of three standing stones, one broken off, occupying an
unassuming location in a field behind a barn at Ballochroy farmhouse on
the west coast of the Kintyre peninsula, Argyll, Scotland. There is, however,
a good view over the coast to the west, and this view is key to understand
ing its significance, for this modest monument is one of the earliest and
most famous examples of a megalithic “observatory” put forward by
Alexander Thom, during the 1950s. It assumed a central place in the con
troversies that raged for more than two decades over Thom’s theories.
Ballochroy encapsulates Thom’s idea that prehistoric Britons used
features on distant horizons as astronomical foresights in order to observe
and record the motions of the sun and moon to remarkable precision. The
central stone at Ballochroy has a broad, flat face oriented across the align
ment that points northwest, directly at the slopes of Corra Bheinn, a
mountain on the Island of Jura some 31 kilometers (19 miles) away. On
the summer solstice, the tip of the sun’s disc twinkled down the indicated
slope; a couple days before or after, when the sun’s path was just slightly
lower, it would not have been visible. The row of three stones itself points
southwestward toward a small island called Cara Island about 12 kilome
ters (7 miles) away. Close to the winter solstice, the tip of the sun’s disc
gleamed to the right of the island as it set; on the solstice itself this would
not have been the case.
Ballochroy 41
Pure Mathematical Physics



The best evidence supporting the theory that Ballochroy was a “solar
observatory” is that there are not one but two foresights at the same site,
marking the setting sun at both of the solstices. Surely such a coincidence
could not have arisen by chance? And yet many critics raised doubts. One of
the other standing stones in the row also has a broad, flat face pointing
northwestwards, but this one points at a different mountain. And the align
ment along the row is very broad, encompassing not only the right-hand end
of Cara Island but also its left-hand end and central peak as well. If we are
fair with the data, then we should admit the existence of at least a few other
candidates for foresights that are equally plausible but have no ready astro
nomical explanation.
On the other hand, the fact that the claimed alignments are so precise
means that we can use the slow change in the setting path of the solstitial sun
century by century (due to the gradual change in the obliquity of the eclip
tic) to calculate the best-fit dates for the two foresights and see if they coin
cide. The result is stunning: the best-fit date is pretty much the same for both
foresights, around 1600 B.C.E., and this is a date that is certainly plausible
archaeologically.
Yet archaeological and historical evidence has all but destroyed the
idea that Ballochroy is a precise solstitial observatory. There is, and was,
more to this monument than three stones in a row. A drawing by the anti
quarian Edward Lhuyd in 1699 clearly shows three cairns in line with the
three stones, one of them so large that it would have blocked the view to
Cara Island, together with a fourth stone beyond. The burial cist (a box
shaped tomb with four side slabs) that was originally covered by this
mound is still visible at the site, although the mound and the other features
sketched by Lhuyd have been destroyed. The remains of this cairn were ex
cavated in the 1960s, and the archaeological evidence indicates that it is
very unlikely to have been constructed as late as the mid-second millennium
B.C.E. If the stones were erected at the date indicated by the two alignments,
then one of them was always blocked by the cairn. Though a few have ar
gued that people might have stood atop the cairn to make the observations,
this is special pleading. Being realistic, we are forced to conclude that the
solstitial alignment of the stone row at Ballochroy, if intentional at all, was
only of a low precision: it was not an observing instrument.
The example of Ballochroy remains important to archaeoastronomers
because it demonstrates the dangers of enthusiastically endorsing alignments
that seem to fit an astronomical theory while ignoring other possibilities be
cause they don’t. This isn’t being fair with the evidence. It also shows the im
portance of the broader context of archaeological and, where we have it, his
torical evidence.

Barasana “Caterpillar Jaguar” Constellation
The Barasana are a group of forest-dwellers in the Colombian Amazon.
They survive by a mixture of fishing, hunting, and gathering, supplemented
by slash-and-burn agriculture. June, July, and August (in our calendar) are
difficult months for them, since their regular food sources are scarce. But at
this time of year pupating caterpillars fall down from the trees and provide
a much-needed source of nutrition. The date this happens coincides with
the time when the Caterpillar Jaguar, a constellation regarded by the
Barasana as (among other things) the Father of Caterpillars, rises higher
and higher in the sky at dusk. Since the Caterpillar Jaguar is formed by stars
in our constellations of Scorpius and Cetus, it is easy to explain, from a
Western perspective, the association that the Barasana observe: the time of
year following the acronical rising of Scorpius and Cetus happens to be the
time of year when several species of caterpillar pupate.
The Barasana can explain the phenomenon too. They say that the Fa
ther of Caterpillars, by rising higher and higher in the sky at dusk, is directly
responsible for the increasing numbers of earthly caterpillars. In the
Barasana worldview, there exists a direct correspondence between two enti
ties that from a Western perspective are quite distinct: the position of a con
stellation in the sky and the behavior of terrestrial creatures.
This is a good example of how a non-Western worldview can make
sense of the cosmos by drawing direct connections between things that we
would regard as quite unconnected. It is also a good example of a way of un
derstanding the world that (at least potentially) has predictive capability:
when the constellation rises, then the caterpillars will start to appear. This
characteristic of Barasana cosmology, some would argue, means that we
could regard it as a rudimentary form of science. However, it might also be
described by others as astrology in the sense that events of earth are per
ceived to be determined by, or at least directly linked with, the configuration
of objects in the sky.

Beltany
The very name of this large stone circle in County Donegal, northwest Ire
land, is of astronomical interest because it suggests an association with the
Celtic calendrical festival of Beltaine, or Bealltaine, which is associated with
the mid-quarter day of May 6. A conspicuous alignment at the site backs
up the idea of such an association. If one stands by the tallest stone in the
circle, which is on the southwestern side, then one can see on the far side a
distinctive triangular stone covered with several cup marks. This stone is
aligned with a point on the horizon where the sun rises on May 6. As a con
sequence, the cup-marked stone is often dubbed the Beltane Stone.
This combination of a 5,000-year-old astronomical alignment and a
more recent mythical tradition that may have given rise to the name, and
their possible linkage through Celtic calendrical festivals, is an attractive
possibility. However, we cannot be sure. Several other astronomical align
ments have been postulated at the circle, showing that the Beltane alignment
may not be the most convincing. For example, there is a small hill summit at
the relevant point on the horizon, but a much more conspicuous hill, Bin
nion Hill, appears just to the left, where the sun rises on about May 21. The
idea of a precise Celtic calendar and its linkage back to an earlier “mega
lithic” calendar is also problematic in a number of ways. The Beltane align
ment at Beltany may, after all, just be a coincidence.
Nonetheless, cup-marked stones do seem to be associated with astro
nomical alignments elsewhere—for example, at the Scottish recumbent
stone circles—so the idea may not be so far-fetched that this particular
springtime sunrise alignment was significant, for some reason, back in the
Neolithic.

Borana Calendar
The Borana are a group of nomadic cattle herders inhabiting an area that
lies partly in southern Ethiopia and partly in northern Kenya. Their calen
dar, which regulates both subsistence and ceremonial activities, is of vital
importance to them and is regulated by experts on sky observation known
as ayantu. The Borana calendar is conventional in some respects. It is based
upon the phase cycle of the moon, with each new month signaled by the ap
pearance of the new, crescent moon in the evening sky. Both months and
days are named, and the ayantu generally know the current month and day
from memory. But if there is any uncertainty they make observations of the
moon and stars. Seven months of the year are identified by a star or group
of stars that rises side by side with the crescent moon when it first appears
in the evening sky. The seven stars and asterisms used are Triangulum, the
Pleiades, Aldebaran, Bellatrix, Orion’s belt and sword, Saiph, and Sirius.
During the other half of the year, at least some of the ayantu watch to see
at what phase the moon is side by side with the first star group in the list,
Triangulum (although others may use different asterisms for this purpose).
“Side by side” is a concept that only makes sense because the Borana live
very close to the equator. This means that all celestial objects rise vertically
somewhere in the eastern sector of the horizon and set vertically in the west
ern sector. On any particular night, all the stars and asterisms that rise to
gether continue to climb up into the sky “side by side.”
The Borana’s obsession with Triangulum is interesting in itself. It is of
ten argued that the brightest stars and asterisms are likely to have been the
most important to prehistoric peoples. Thus, people who seek stellar align
ments at prehistoric monuments tend to examine the brightest stars. The Bo
rana show that this is not necessarily the case. Triangulum is a relatively faint
group of three stars, yet it is of prime importance to them.
What renders the Borana calendar highly distinctive, and confused an
thropologists and archaeoastronomers for over a decade, is that day names
do not start afresh with each month but progress in an endless cycle of
twenty-seven names. Since the phase-cycle (synodic) month is between
twenty-nine and thirty days long, two or three days appear twice in each
month, once at the beginning and again at the end. The reason for this seem
ingly incomprehensible practice becomes clear when we consider the monthly
passage of the moon through the stars. Night by night, the moon moves
slowly relative to the stars, completing a circuit through the stars in 27.3 days.
This is known as the sidereal month. At the equator, this means that if the
Borana Calendar 45
Pure Mathematical Physics



moon rises on one night side by side with a certain set of stars, by the next it
will have progressed and rise level with a different set. After 27 nights, it will
be rising side by side once again (more or less) with the original set of stars.
The Borana day is determined by the stars that the moon is level with on a
given night, regardless of its phase. Twenty-seven day names suffice, with one
being repeated in roughly every third cycle as observations dictate.
The fact that the ayantu ignore the sun in determining the time of year
seems surprising until we realize the implications of their location close to
the equator. Here, the sun’s behavior changes little through the year: the
length of the day is effectively the same all year round, and the annual swing
in the sun’s rising or setting position between the solstices is relatively small.
On the other hand, the vertical motion of the celestial bodies at night makes
it natural to notice which stars are level with the moon, especially just after
the moon has risen or before it sets.

Boyne Valley Tombs
The northern banks of the river Boyne in County Meath, Ireland, at a spot
called the Bend of the Boyne, are the site of a remarkable concentration of
Neolithic tombs dating to the late fourth millennium B.C.E. These include
three large passage tombs: Newgrange, Knowth, and Dowth.
At Newgrange a single 19-meter (60-foot) passage leads in from an en
trance on the southeast side of a huge mound (some 80 meters [260 feet]
across), famously oriented so that the sun shines directly along it, lighting up
the central chamber, just after dawn on days around the winter solstice. Each
of the other major tombs has two passages. Those at Knowth run deep into
the interior from entrances opposite each other, facing more or less due east
and west respectively. Dowth has passages of different lengths, both in its
southwestern quarter. The longer one runs in from an entrance in the west
southwest, the shorter one from the southwest.
46 Boyne Valley Tombs
Pure Mathematical Physics



Apart from Newgrange, only the shorter passage at Dowth could
conceivably be interpreted as aligned upon the solstitial sun, and the tar
get here is winter solstice sunset rather than sunrise. However, it has also
been pointed out that the three monuments, taken together, might have a
broader calendrical significance. Each of their five passages is oriented
close to sunrise or sunset on a solstice, equinox, or mid-quarter day: that
is, upon one of the dates obtained by dividing the year into eight exactly
equal parts starting at either of the solstices. This division is reflected in the
traditional Celtic calendrical festivals, which fall close to these dates. It is
also reflected in the precise alignments upon sunrise or sunset on these
dates at many British megalithic sites that were claimed by Alexander
Thom in the mid-twentieth century and seemed to imply that a calendar
dividing the year into eight equal parts had been in extensive use through
out Neolithic Britain.
However, as later reassessments showed, the archaeological and statis
tical evidence simply does not support Thom’s “megalithic” calendar, and
the idea of any all-pervasive Celtic calendar in later, Iron Age times has
proven highly questionable. Astronomical and calendrical practices through
out later prehistory were much more variable and localized. Furthermore,
the supposedly calendrical alignments of the Boyne valley tomb passages
(Newgrange aside) are not exact. All this suggests that the Boyne valley
tombs may have done no more than to fit within a broad general pattern of
orientation practice that prevailed locally and perhaps extended to Irish pas
sage tombs further afield. This much would accord with what one finds
among local groups of later prehistoric tombs and temples throughout west
ern Europe. Indeed, we need look no further than the sixteen smaller passage
tombs that surrounded Knowth in order to see a broad range of passage ori
entations varying from northeast around through east and south to south
west, but avoiding the northwest and north.
Yet it remains possible that more particular practices relating to the sea
sons and the skies may show up archaeologically in other ways, as “one-off”
phenomena, such as the solstitial hierophany at Newgrange itself. Thus, one
of the decorated kerbstones at Knowth resembles a sundial, while another
contains a cyclic arrangement of twenty-nine circles and crescents that could
be a representation of the phase cycle of the moon.

Brainport Bay
The landscape of much of the western highlands of Scotland is one of
mountains dissected by long narrow lakes, similar to Norwegian fjords, ex
tending inland from the coast. Loch Fyne in Argyll is one of the longest of
these, stretching for more than 50 kilometers (30 miles). On its shores,
about halfway along, is one of the most convincing candidates for a pre
historic solar observation platform.
The site known as Brainport Bay or Minard occupies a spectacular set
ting on a low eminence jutting out into the lake. It achieved notoriety in the
late 1970s when, following excavations by the local archaeological society, a
curious alignment of artificial structures came to light, dating to the Bronze
Age in the mid second millennium B.C.E. It includes a back platform, a flat
area built around a natural rock outcrop; two large boulders standing on end,
known as the observation boulders, with a flat cobbled area between; and a
main platform, again artificially enhanced. The main platform contains what
appears to have been an extraordinary sighting device. Two slender standing
stones a little over 1 meter (3 feet) tall stood upright in clefts between rocks
(they had fallen and been moved but were re-erected after the excavations had
located the stone-holes). As viewed from the observation boulders, these
stones would have lined up, with the precision of a rifle barrel, upon a notch
between two mountains on the only distant horizon visible from the site,
some 45 kilometers (30 miles) along the lake to the northeast.
In the Bronze Age, the midsummer sunrise would have occurred just a
little to the left of this notch. As the sun moved steadily upwards and to the
right, it would have crossed the exact alignment, passing just above the notch,
a few minutes later. Furthermore, the appearance of the sun in the alignment
would not have been confined to the solstice itself, but would have been
equally impressive for a period of several days, like the famous midwinter
alignment at Newgrange. This means that unreliable weather is unlikely to
have prevented at least one successful sighting of the event in most years.
48 Brainport Bay
Pure Mathematical Physics



As far as the evidence goes, this is one of the most convincing cases of
a monumental solstitial alignment constructed in the Bronze Age in the
whole of Britain and Ireland. Compared with the possible observing plat
form at Kintraw, for example, the structures at Brainport Bay show clear ev
idence of human activity and enhancement of the natural features, but not
of habitation or burial. It is a prime candidate, in other words, for a cere
monial or ritual site. We are still a long way from knowing what the solstice
meant to the people who, we assume, came and observed or worshipped
here at dawn on or around the longest day of the year. It is tempting, though,
to imagine a priest or two, or perhaps a couple of other people of special so
cial standing, observing the event from the special vantage of the observa
tion boulders while a larger audience had to content themselves with stand
ing on the back platform up the hill behind. On the basis of current evidence,
though, this remains speculative.
Despite this relatively straightforward and impressive alignment, the
site nevertheless became controversial. This is because of additional sugges
tions by Euan MacKie, the archaeologist who had originally excavated at
Kintraw and was also responsible for bringing Brainport Bay to the atten
tion of a wider audience. One of MacKie’s ideas was that the Brainport Bay
alignment was not imprecise and not just used for ceremonial purposes: it
was a precision observing instrument for determining the exact date of the
solstice. It is difficult to determine the exact date of the solstice, because the
change in the rising position of the sun on days near to the solstice is only
minuscule. The horizon notch that the “rifle barrel” stones align upon actu
ally marked the first gleam of sunrise about fifteen days before and after the
solstice. The prehistoric observers, according to MacKie, would have deter
mined the solstice by counting the number of days between the two times
when the sun rose in the notch and halving the difference.
The problem with this argument is that it cuts both ways. Counting in
its favor is the fact that if prehistoric people were trying to determine the sol
stice, then using a horizon notch displaced from the actual solstitial rising
position of the sun and halving the difference would have been a very sensi
ble way to do it, because they were focusing on a place on the horizon where
the day-to-day change in the position of sunrise was easily perceptible.
Counting against the idea, though, is the fact that any notch within a short
distance of the solstice is susceptible to a similar argument, since we do not
have direct knowledge about the interval of time around the solstice that
would have to be halved. In mountainous country there are lots of notches,
and the chances of a fortuitous alignment are very considerable. The upshot
is that on the basis of the evidence available to us we can only return one
verdict—and fortunately it is one that is allowed in the Scottish legal sys
tem—namely, “not proven.”
Brainport Bay 49
Pure Mathematical Physics



MacKie went further still. There are a variety of other signs of human
activity in the immediate area around the Brainport Bay alignment, includ
ing a 3.4 meters (11 feet) long fallen standing stone and cup markings on
rock outcroppings. The whole area, MacKie suggested, formed a “calen
drical complex,” with several precise alignments upon sunrise or sunset on
epoch dates in the “megalithic” calendar. But critics have pointed out a
number of difficulties, particularly the fact that the alleged calendrical
alignments at Brainport Bay are marked in very different ways: across a
platform to a pyramid-shaped stone; from a standing stone to a cup mark
on a rock; and along the line of a cup-and-groove mark (but not along a
similar cup-and-groove mark on another stone). A great many potential
alignments of various types exist here, which implies that the calendrical
ones could easily have arisen fortuitously.

Brodgar, Ring of
The Ring of Brodgar is one of the most impressive, and one of the two most
northerly, examples in Britain of a henge monument containing a stone cir
cle. The stone circle is over 100 meters (330 feet) across, standing within a
ditch over 120 meters (400 feet) in diameter (the outer bank has now al
most completely disappeared). Several of the stones rise to a height of over
3 meters (10 feet). Located on the largest of the Orkney Islands (Mainland
Orkney) off the northern coast of Scotland, it occupies a magnificent situa
tion toward the end of a long, narrow isthmus projecting into a large fresh
water lake (the lochs of Harray and Stenness). Just 1.5 kilometers (1 mile)
away are the even taller Stones of Stenness, another henge and stone circle
in a matching situation: Stenness occupies a shorter isthmus on the other
side of a 200 meters (700 feet) gap that one can now cross by a road bridge.
The Ring of Brodgar was clearly of paramount importance in the prehis
toric landscape in around 3000 B.C.E., when it was probably constructed.
Standing sentinel over what was almost certainly an important route across
the island, and clearly visible from all around, it occupied a position of
great power and influence. That it remained a conspicuous ancestral mon
ument revered for many generations seems evident from the numerous
50 Brodgar, Ring of
Pure Mathematical Physics



round cairns that were built around it in the Bronze Age, more than a mil
lennium later.
The site achieved astronomical notoriety in the 1970s when Alexander
Thom and his son Archie first published the theory that it was a sophisti
cated lunar observatory. According to the Thoms, various alignments at the
site, mostly between the outlying cairns, were deliberately aligned upon hori
zon foresights that marked limiting rising and setting positions in the moon’s
complex cycles. So precise were the alleged alignments—to less than two arc
minutes—that the Thoms were forced to conclude that programs of obser
vation lasting many generations must have been needed.
The Ring of Brodgar, more than any other single monument, demon
strates the dangers of over-enthusiastic interpretation in archaeoastronomy.
Time has dealt harshly with the “lunar observatory” hypothesis. The prob
lem lies in the selection of data: the selection of alignments, the selection of
foresights, and the selection of lunar “targets” deemed significant are all
highly questionable. The four foresights, for example, are of varying degrees
of conspicuity, varying from the crest of the impressive distant cliffs of Hel
lia 13 kilometers (8 miles) away on the island of Hoy, down to an almost im
perceptible blip on the horizon at a place called Ravie Hill. There is no rea
son (other than their lunar potential) to pick out the four chosen from the
many dozens, if not hundreds, of other possibilities.

Above all, the example of Brodgar shows the paramount importance of
a field methodology that ensures the fair selection of data and its critical as
sessment. It is all too easy, even for a professional academic working outside
his or her own discipline, to end up—unwittingly—merely picking out the
evidence that seems to support a favored theory while ignoring the rest.

“Brown” Archaeoastronomy
This term denotes an approach in archaeoastronomy that is not primarily
focused upon alignment studies but is concerned with a much broader
range of types of evidence, such as written documents or ethnohistorical ac
counts. This approach emerged in North America during the 1970s, partic
ularly in the context of studies of astronomy in native North America and
pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. It involved attempts to integrate approaches
from a range of humanities and social science disciplines such as history,
cultural anthropology, art history, ethnography, folklore studies, history of
religions, and many more. This broad, multidisciplinary approach con
trasted starkly with the pursuit of statistical rigor that absorbed most Old
World archaeoastronomers at the time.

Bush Barrow Gold Lozenge
The Bush Barrow is one of a number of spectacular burial mounds in the
vicinity of Stonehenge in southern England, many of them clustering along
the low ridges that surround the famous site itself. These round barrows,
the burial places of prominent Bronze Age chieftains in the Wessex region,
52 “Brown” Archaeoastronomy
Pure Mathematical Physics



were built around 2000 B.C.E., several centuries after the main construction
activity had ceased at Stonehenge. Few doubt that their position, at the
boundary between the “lived-in” landscape and the low bowl of the sacred
landscape centered upon the ancestral place of power, in clear sight of both,
was in itself an expression of the power and influence of the dead chiefs.
Rich assemblages of grave goods accompanied the chieftains to the af
terworld. One of the most impressive was the Bush Barrow lozenge, a mag
nificent diamond-shaped plate of thin sheet gold 18 centimeters (7 inches)
across. Finely decorated with distinctive patterns of incised lines, it is gener
ally interpreted as an ornamental breast plate—an imposing mark of status.
In the 1980s, Archie Thom and two colleagues claimed that the lozenge was
a sophisticated astronomical observing instrument. By holding the plate hor
izontally and lining it up in the correct orientation, the various markings
could have been used to indicate the sunrise and sunset positions on signifi
cant epoch dates in the “megalithic calendar” that Archie Thom’s father, the
Scottish engineer Alexander Thom, had proposed. It could be used in a sim
ilar manner to determine significant rising and setting points of the moon.
The claim appeared to vindicate his father’s theories.
But attractive as the idea seemed, problems emerged when it was ex
amined in detail. For one thing, there would be various practical difficulties
using such a device, not least in determining its correct orientation. The most
serious problem, however, is that the directions supposedly marked by the
patterns on the lozenge do not really fit very well. Several of the alignments
actually fall between the markings, while many of the markings do not fit
any of the alignments at all. The fact that the markings actually form a reg
ular and symmetrical design (while the astronomical targets are not regular)
argues strongly in favor of their being purely decorative rather than astro
nomically functional. And as if this were not enough, other lozenges exist in
nearby burials with a similar form of decoration but different dimensions.
Why should only this one function additionally as a calendrical device?
By the 1990s it had become clear that the other evidence supporting the
idea of a “megalithic calendar” did not stand up to critical evaluation. How
ever, the most direct blow to the calendrical interpretation of the Bush Bar
row lozenge was delivered, ironically, when the historian John North at
tempted to interpret the lozenge independently as part of his own
astronomical interpretations of prehistoric monuments and artifacts in
southern England. Vehemently criticizing the existing astronomical interpre
tation, he proposed an equally complex but entirely different one of his own,
thereby showing how easy it was to do so and in the process undermining
confidence in both theories.
The example of the Bush Barrow lozenge demonstrates very clearly the
dangers of trying to mould the evidence to fit a favored theory rather than

letting the evidence speak for itself. Most likely the lozenge was simply a dec
orative artifact. It is impressive nonetheless and can be recognized as a con
siderable technological achievement without recourse to sophisticated calen
dars and astronomy.

Cacaxtla
The citadel of Cacaxtla is prominently located on a hilltop in the highlands
of Mexico, in the state of Tlaxcala, about eighty kilometers (fifty miles)
southeast of Mexico City. It dates to the Epiclassic period (c. C.E. 650–850),
a time when great cities such as Teotihuacan had collapsed and independent
highland kingdoms had begun to develop. It was the main seat of the rulers
of a group known to archaeologists as the Olmeca-Xicalanca (not connected
with earlier Olmecs on the Gulf Coast).
The most impressive feature of Cacaxtla for the modern visitor is its
huge murals, colorful and dramatic, reflecting a mixture of stylistic influ
ences. These bear witness to tumultuous times. One of them vividly depicts
the aftermath of battle and sacrifice, with the victorious dark-skinned war
riors shown in jaguar pelts and the defeated lowland army in bird costumes.
In one scene, the defeated captain is draped with Venus symbols and is be
ing publicly humiliated prior to his execution. The archaeoastronomer John
Carlson has argued convincingly that this episode was one manifestation of
a wider cult of warfare and ritual sacrifice related to the patterns of ap
pearance of the planet Venus. A small chamber discovered in 1987 con
tained two stuccoed pillars, each painted with a life-sized figure rich in sym
bolism relating to blood, water, and the planet Venus. One is male and one
is female, but they also have scorpion, bird, and jaguar features and wear
Venus skirts, kilts ornamented with a huge depiction of the glyph known to
represent Venus. They are thought to represent deities strongly related to
Venus, who had a vital role in the process of turning blood into water
through ritual sacrifice (feeding the gods with human blood would encour
age them to reciprocate by providing rain), thus ensuring fertility and re
newal. It is possible that this room was the place where some of the most
important sacrifices took place.
About one and a half kilometers (one mile) to the west of Cacaxtla, on
an adjacent and higher hilltop, is the ceremonial center of Xochitecatl, a
much older site that was occupied from about 700 B.C.E. and in use until an
55
C
Pure Mathematical Physics



eruption of the volcano Popocatepetl forced its abandonment around C.E.
150. (Later, at the time of the dominance of Cacaxtla, parts of it were reoc
cupied.) One of its most distinctive features is a spiral pyramid built around
700 B.C.E. But it is the rectangular Pyramid of the Flowers that is most re
markable. It contains more than thirty infant burials (yet only one adult) and
over two thousand clay figures, the great majority representing females of all
ages. The obvious conclusion is that the latter were votive offerings related
to fertility rites. The infant burials evoke practices known in (later) Aztec
times, when children were sacrificed at mountain shrines on particular cal
endar dates to petition for rain.
Ascending the temple’s western staircase to the large central platform
140 by 100 meters (460 by 330 feet)—reveals a striking view to the east and,
directly ahead, the 4,600 meter (15,000 foot) volcano La Malinche, which
dominates this region. The deposits of clay figures were found near this spot,
which is scarcely surprising. Rain and fertility are clearly associated, and
clouds tend to loom over the mountain even when the sky is otherwise clear.
The later Aztecs certainly associated mountains with rains, believing (some
have argued) that mountains were hollow “houses” filled with water—a
conviction that is likely to reflect a much longer-standing element of
Mesoamerican worldview. In pre-conquest times La Malinche was known as
Matlalcueye, the great female mountain of sustenance. It is fair to conclude
that rain and fertility rites at Xochitecatl might have been associated with
this mountain for many centuries into the past, and possibly as far back as
the Middle Formative Period when the pyramids were first built.
The view from the platform of the Pyramid of the Flowers reveals one
more remarkable fact. From here, the palace of Cacaxtla sits immediately be
low and directly in line with the volcano. Is it too far-fetched to suggest that
Cacaxtla was deliberately placed in an alignment whose significance was al
ready long established? Possibly not; and it is even possible that cult prac
tices related to this alignment have survived into modern times. Each year on
the festival of St. Michael, September 29, the people of the village of San
Miguel del Milagro, close to Xochitecatl, set out on a pilgrimage to the
archangel’s shrine. Chanting to celebrate the feast begins at sunrise. Around
this day, as viewed from the Pyramid of the Flowers, the sun rises behind the
summit of La Malinche, along the alignment of monuments and mountain.
According to Carlson, these activities that still take place in a small Mexican
village represent, in Christianized form, a living tradition of sacred geogra
phy, timed pilgrimage, and mountain veneration related to rain and fertility
rites that extends well back into pre-conquest times. Such a continuity of tra
dition might seem unthinkable if we did not have good evidence that other
fundamental aspects of Mesoamerican thought were remarkably durable
in particular the calendar itself.

Threading together in this way strands of evidence of different types
from archaeology, history, archaeoastronomy, and modern ethnography
raises many methodological issues, and if done carelessly can lead to quite
unsustainable conclusions. Yet if done carefully it can bring some remark
able insights.

Cahokia
The many huge earthworks or mounds that remain visible in the Mississippi
and Ohio valleys form a conspicuous testimonial to the technical achieve
ments of indigenous North Americans before the arrival of European set
tlers. Inevitably, a number of them have attracted interest in potential as
tronomical alignments, and it is scarcely surprising that this includes the
great Mississippian site of Cahokia.
The Mississippian culture flourished from about C.E. 1000 to 1400 in
the central Mississippi valley, where the fertile floodplains were ideal for
growing maize and other staple crops. Cahokia was not only the main eco
nomic and political focus of this culture but also the largest pre-Columbian
town—worthy in fact of being called a city—north of Mexico. At the height
of its development it covered over fifteen square kilometers (six square miles)
and had an estimated population of more than twenty thousand. The city it
self was laid out on a roughly cardinally aligned grid. At its heart was a cer
emonial center containing over a hundred earthworks—temple or house
Cahokia 57

platforms together with burial mounds. Most of this “mound center” is now
preserved in Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site near East St. Louis.
The rectangular, flat-topped earthwork known as Monks’ Mound is at
the center of the ceremonial grid. It is the largest earthen mound in the
whole of the Americas, some thirty meters (a hundred feet) high and cover
ing around seven hectares (seventeen acres). But it was the discovery in the
early 1960s of rings of postholes marking the sites of five timber circles to
the west of Monks’ Mound that triggered intense astronomical interest in
the site. By analogy to Woodhenge—a set of concentric, oval-shaped timber
rings found near Stonehenge in England—the discoverers named them
woodhenges, although it is dangerous to draw close similarities between su
perficially similar sites from completely different cultural contexts. The five
original woodhenges at Cahokia, identified by extrapolating from strings of
postholes forming circular arcs running through excavated areas, appear to
have had diameters ranging from thirty-seven meters (120 feet) to seventy
one meters (233 feet). They were good approximations to true circles, with
evenly spaced posts. Most remarkably, initial estimates of the numbers of
posts in the five circles—twenty-four, thirty-six, forty-eight, sixty, and sev
enty-two—implied that numerology was vitally important, and that strict
design principles were operating. Four of the five posthole circles overlap,
suggesting that they represent successive constructions fulfilling a particu
lar purpose. Since this time, a number of other postholes and posthole
structures have been discovered at Cahokia.
The original suggestion made by archaeologist Warren Wittry in the
early 1960s was that the various circles of timber posts functioned as devices
for observing the rising position of the sun at the solstices and equinoxes,
perhaps for the purpose of regulating an agricultural or ceremonial calendar.
However, this involved the totally arbitrary selection of data: for instance,
three posts—indistinguishable in any other way from all the remaining posts
in one of the circles—were identified as putative solar foresights as viewed
from a central post. Other corroborating evidence presented at the time—for
instance, relating to the orientation of the ramps used in setting each relevant
timber post in its place—has proved totally fallacious, as have various fur
ther astronomical speculations.
An obvious question to have asked at the outset was: why, if sunrise ob
servation was the primary purpose, was a whole circle of posts needed? In
deed, circles of this size—unless supplemented by the use of distant horizon
foresights—cannot define the relevant alignments at all precisely. It is possi
ble that the circles had a cosmological function or meaning, but the public
ity given to the unfounded astronomical speculations has undoubtedly ham
pered serious consideration of this issue.
Instead, Cahokia stands as an unfortunate example of bad practice

Calendars
The regular motions of celestial bodies can be used to keep track of the pas
sage of time, and observations of different cycles in the sky have underlain
many different types of calendars developed and used from early prehistory
to the present. The moon is an obvious tool for this purpose: it is conspicu
ous in the sky, and its cycle of phases is easily tracked and of a convenient
periodicity (between twenty-nine and thirty days). The sun is another obvi
ous candidate: the annual passage of its rising and setting position along the
horizon, and its changing arc through the sky, which gives rise to days of dif
ferent lengths, is directly related to the seasonal year. The stars follow the
same track through the sky day after day, the changing time of night of their
appearance and disappearance are also correlated with the seasonal year.
Even the planets follow regular cycles, more complex but nonetheless recog
nizable and readily observable.
The diversity of human calendars, and the complexity of many of them,
arises partly because these natural cycles do not fit together neatly. The
length of the lunar phase cycle (synodic month) is not a whole number of
days, the length of the seasonal year is not a whole number of lunar phase
cycles, and so on. Sometimes nature provides, by chance, a reasonably close
fit—thus five synodic cycles of the planet Venus are very close to eight sea
sonal years—and some human cultures seem to have gone out of their way
to identify such correlations. A prime example is the Maya, as is clear from
the almanac known as the Dresden Codex. Others observe certain cycles in
the heavens and seem to ignore the rest. It is scarcely surprising that there is
Calendars 59
Pure Mathematical Physics



a broad correlation between calendars and latitude, since the general ap
pearance of the skies and of the celestial cycles depends upon it. For exam
ple, the annual variation in the length of the day, and in the horizon position
of sunrise (or sunset), is much greater, and hence more obvious, at higher lat
itudes than near to the equator.
These are convenient categorizations for us and for the modern as
tronomer, but they may have made no sense to peoples in the past. To un
derstand the nature of a calendar we must understand the needs it fulfilled
practical, ideological, and social. In some cases more than one distinct
calendars fulfilling different needs may have run in parallel. We must also
understand that a calendar may have been conceptualized within a very dif
ferent framework of understanding from our own. It then comes as less of a
surprise that calendars are commonly regulated using astronomical cycles
observed in combination with a multitude of other natural cycles, many of
which (to our way of thinking) are less regular or reliable.
One of the greatest pitfalls is to try to identify “stages” in the develop
ment of the modern Western calendar, seeing these as a progression along an
inevitable path of calendrical development. This encourages a form of intel
lectual imperialism (or ethnocentrism) in which we attempt to measure the
achievement of others in relation to our own. This stepped approach is easily
refuted by a number of indigenous calendars recorded in modern times. The
calendar of the Mursi of Ethiopia is particularly valuable in this respect. What
we actually find, rather than a single progression, is considerable diversity
combined with remarkable ingenuity and adaptability to local circumstances.
Another pitfall is to simplify calendrical developments in the distant
past, postulating the existence of calendars in common use over great swaths
of the prehistoric world and/or changing little over many centuries. Notori
ous examples of this kind of oversimplification are the “megalithic” calen
dar in Neolithic Britain and the “Celtic” calendar in Iron Age Europe. An
other is the proposition that the modern Borana calendar represented a
calendar that had been propagated, without variation, through two millen
nia since being encapsulated in a set of alignments at Namoratung’a in
northern Kenya. Research has shown, instead, that calendars are very often
adapted rapidly to changing circumstances.
On the other hand, broad calendrical principles can be preserved with
remarkable consistency, as happened amongst the scattered islands of Poly
nesia. Yet even here, considerable local variations developed: even between
individual islands and parts of islands within the Hawaiian group. There
were variations, for example, in the naming of months, the timing of months
within the seasonal year, and rules for inserting intercalary months. A simi
lar degree of variation is evident between different city-states in Classical
Greece and also within pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.

Callanish
In one of the most remote corners of Britain stands one of the country’s most
impressive megalithic monuments. The standing stones of Callanish (an an
glicization of the Gaelic name, Calanais) can be found on the western shores
of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides off western Scotland. They occupy
a commanding situation overlooking what is now a stark landscape of
heathery peat bogs and, to the west, the sea inlet of East Loch Roag. The site,
dating to the third millennium B.C.E., consists of a ring of tall menhirs—the
ring is 13 meters (43 feet) across and the stones vary from 3 meters (10 feet)
to 4 meters (13 feet) in height—surrounding a small, chambered tomb. Rows
of four or five stones radiate out to the east, west, and south. Northwards,
but displaced by about ten degrees to the east, runs a longer double row or
avenue. Several smaller stone circles and settings of standing stones are
found in the vicinity.
The site first achieved astronomical notoriety when a survey was pub
lished by Vice-Admiral Boyle Somerville in 1912. It included the first-ever
suggestion that a megalithic monument might have been aligned upon the
moon at an extreme rising or setting point in its 18.6-year cycle, known as
the lunar node cycle. As Somerville pointed out, the avenue is aligned south
wards in the direction of the most southerly possible setting point of the
moon, which the moon can only reach every eighteenth or nineteenth year.
This idea was elaborated in the 1960s and 1970s by Gerald Hawkins, the
author of Stonehenge Decoded, and by the Scottish engineer Alexander
Thom. The Greek historian Diodorus of Sicily, writing in the first century
B.C.E., referred to a sacred precinct or circular temple in the island of the
Hyperboreans where the moon appeared close to the earth and the god re
turned every nineteen years, and it has been suggested by some people, in
cluding the British archaeologist Aubrey Burl, that Diodorus referred to
Callanish 61
Pure Mathematical Physics



Callanish rather than Stonehenge, as was more generally assumed. (Both in
terpretations are problematic.)
Thom proposed that Callanish was one of several “lunar observato
ries” marking significant lunar rising and setting points very precisely (down
to a small fraction of the moon’s diameter) using distant foresights—in this
case, the mountain of Clisham on Harris, some 26 kilometers (16 miles)
away. However, there is no clear view of Clisham from the avenue—it is ob
scured both by the taller stones of the central ring and by a small rocky out
crop just to the south of the site. Thom’s high-precision “lunar observato
ries” in general have not stood the test of time.
However, the failure of mid-twentieth-century attempts to populate the
prehistoric past with an intellectual or priestly elite prepossessed with high
precision astronomical observations should not blind us to the basic rela
tionship with the moon that exists at the Callanish stones, or with what this
might actually have meant to the Neolithic populations of this area. The full
or nearly full moon scraping uncommonly low over the hills to the south and
then—as viewed along the avenue—passing behind and setting among the
stones of the circle, casting them into silhouette, would have been a truly
spectacular sight, one that could only have been seen once or twice in a gen
eration. If this was intentional from the outset, then it would certainly ex

plain the skewing of the avenue away from the meridian. It would also have
ensured that this location was charged with tremendous sacred power at
these special times.
It has been suggested that the standing stones of Callanish and the var
ious smaller megalithic monuments in the surrounding area incorporated nu
merous alignments upon prominent horizon features and extreme lunar ris
ing and setting positions. The Callanish stones, it was proposed, stood at the
heart of a complex that encapsulated a variety of relationships between built
monuments, prominent natural features in the landscape, and the motions of
the moon. The general idea is not implausible: indigenous societies com
monly organize sacred space to reflect cosmic relationships perceived in the
wider visual setting, and the visible environment included the sky. But in the
absence of corroborating evidence, it is almost impossible to argue convinc
ingly for any particular scheme. We have no way of knowing which rela
tionships actually were perceived as significant in the past, and any choice
that we make is ultimately subjective. Whether the Callanish stones really
represent a temple whose significance related to the moon appearing in a
special way in every nineteenth year remains an open question.

Caracol at Chichen Itza
An extraordinary feature of Mesoamerican astronomy, given the complex
ity and sophistication evident from the ethnohistory and written sources
such as the Dresden Codex, is the apparent lack of any observatories or ob
serving instruments apart from the cross-sticks depicted in various codices,
widely interpreted as a naked-eye sighting device. One of the very few seri
ous candidates for a building used as an observatory is the Caracol at
Chichen Itza.
Chichen Itza is one of the most famous Maya cities. Like Uxmal, it
flourished around C.E. 800, but its influence appears to have persisted while
many other cities were abandoned and fell into ruin. During the Postclassic
period (C.E. 900–1300), before Chichen Itza itself fell into ruin, its sphere of
influence became greatly extended and the constructions forming its cere
monial center became bigger and more impressive than ever. Even so, the
Caracol stands out as exceptional. The reason is not so much its size as its
shape: it is round, while every other visible construction here is straight
sided. As such the Caracol is almost unique, and certainly uniquely pre
served. The round tower was ascended by a curved staircase running inside
its double outer walls, leading to a small upper chamber with windows on
various sides—or so it is supposed, since less than half of it now survives.

The openings are little more than niches, which means that they provide re
strictive sighting devices. They do look out just above the horizon, which has
led numerous researchers to measure alignments and speculate on their pre
cise function. This anomalous and unaesthetic building seems an ideal can
didate for an observatory where Maya priests observed the heavens to regu
late the calendar.
To the person seeking statistical verification that the tower was used for
astronomical observations, the results are disappointing. There are no con
sistent alignments on the sun, moon, or planets. And while stellar observa
tions might have been important, there are too many possibilities—too many
bright stars—to place much credence on any apparent stellar alignments that
have been found. Further progress must consider the cultural context. Given
the close association of various nearby structures at Chichen Itza with the
planet Venus, the claim that two of the three surviving windows were ideally
placed for observing the furthest northerly and southerly settings of this
planet deserves closer scrutiny. But in view of the total lack of cultural evi
dence attesting to its use as an observatory, the strong possibility remains
that the Caracol had nothing to do with astronomical observations at all.

Carahunge
In a mountainous region of southern Armenia, near the town of Sisian, is
an impressive stone setting consisting of over 150 standing stones varying
from about one meter (three feet) to 2.8 meters (nine feet) in height. Ap
proximately fifty more stones have now fallen. Of Neolithic date, probably
built no later than the third millennium B.C.E. and possibly considerably
earlier, the site broadly resembles many better-known megalithic monu
ments on the Atlantic seaboard of Europe, and particularly in Britain, Ire
land, and Brittany. Surrounding a central dolmen is an oval-shaped ring
about thirty-five meters (115 feet) in diameter consisting of about forty
stones. An avenue runs out from the ring to the northeast, and other rows
run north and south.
The site has been interpreted as an astronomical observatory and ac
claimed as an Armenian Stonehenge. A distinctive feature of Carahunge is
that about eighty of the stones in the north-south rows contained a small cir

cular hole running through their upper section (although only about fifty of
these stones survive intact). These curious holes have carefully smoothed
edges and are around five centimeters (two inches) in diameter. Some are as
much as twenty centimeters (eight inches) deep, opening out into wider de
pressions carved into each side of the stone. Three holes enter in one side of
a stone, turn a right angle and then point directly upwards. An unresolved
question is whether the holes, which seem remarkably unweathered if they
are indeed prehistoric, were in fact added as a later feature.
A number of Armenian and Russian archaeoastronomers have investi
gated the possible use of these holes for observations of the sun and moon
in prehistoric times. They have established, for example, that three or four
of them are directed toward the point of sunrise on the summer solstice and
another three or four toward the point of sunset on the same day. Other
holes point in a variety of directions, all around the compass. They are also
inclined at various angles to the horizontal, mostly up to about fifteen de
grees; this means that most are directed toward points in the sky just above
the local horizon. These facts raise the serious possibility that the holes were

used for astronomical observations, whether contemporary with the con
struction of the original monument or later. It has even been suggested that
the three right-angled holes contained mirrors and were used for zenith ob
servation. To address these issues, a systematic study of the holes that remain
in situ, paying careful attention to methodological issues, is urgently needed,
because the site is unprotected and threatened by damage from sightseers
and looters.
Inevitably there have been other claims—more speculative and less sup
portable—relating to the astronomical significance of the site. One is that it
can be astronomically dated to the sixth millennium B.C.E. And direct com
parisons with Stonehenge, which few now believe was an observatory, are
less than helpful.

Cardinal Directions
If we find monumental alignments pointing due north, east, south, or west,
it is tempting to interpret them simply as “cardinally oriented,” but we
must be cautious in doing so. Why would such alignments arise?
Where architecture is intentionally aligned toward due north or south,
disregarding the exceptional circumstance where this is because some signif
icant place or landmark happens to be located in that direction, then it is as
tronomical in a broad sense. This is because north-south alignments follow
the axis of symmetry of the daily motions of the stars in the night sky as they
swing each day around the celestial poles. From some locations, certain im
portant celestial bodies may be seen to “rise” or “set” in these directions, but
this can only happen if the horizon is not flat, since all the celestial bodies
move along on the level when they are due north or south. In general, north
south alignments relate to the daily motions of the heavens as a whole rather
than to any particular celestial body or event. Three very different examples
illustrate the reasons for keeping architecture “in tune with the cosmos” in
this way: the Great North Road at Chaco Canyon—the so-called Chaco

Meridian; the Forbidden City in Beijing; and the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt.
Alignments to the east or west are more problematic. An alignment on
equinoctial sunrise or sunset, for example, will be approximately toward due
east or west, respectively, but was not necessarily perceived as “cardinal.”
Then again, the concept of “east” may be a much broader one. Christian
churches are generally conceived as oriented eastwards, for a variety of litur
gical reasons that dictated this to be the direction that Christian worshipers
should face when praying. However, their actual orientations span a range
spreading as much as several tens of degrees away from true east. If we have
only archaeological evidence to go on, especially if we have no reason to as
sume any great precision, then it is difficult to see how we can distinguish an
alignment conceived to be “easterly” from one upon the equinoctial rising
sun, or indeed upon some other star or asterism that happens to rise in that
general direction (such as, in the present day, Orion’s belt).
As if this were not enough, there is a deeper problem. In assuming that
east is universally conceived as a cardinal direction, we are making the as
sumption that every human community, past and present, would be inclined
to identify as significant four directions that divide the horizon into four ex
actly equal parts. This assumption is unwarranted. It is not true for the
Chorti Maya people of the Yucatan in Mexico, for whom the east and west
are seen as the directions of sunrise and sunset on the day when the sun
passes directly overhead. The north and south directions, as we have said,
arise as a direct consequence of the motions of the stars in the night sky as
they swing each day around the celestial poles—in other words, they are dis
cernible by direct observation of the heavens in a way that applies equally
well at any point on the earth (apart from the poles). On the other hand, the
directions east and west as we conceive them are not marked in any direct
and consistent way by astronomical referents. (There is no direct way, for ex
ample, of identifying a particular sunrise as equinoctial: to do this one must
employ some device such as counting the number of days or dividing the
horizon between the solstices.)
In short, because the designation of the four directions due north,
south, east, and west as cardinal is so familiar to us, it is easy to think of their
significance as an absolute, but this would be a mistake. There is no reason
to suppose concepts such as “east” and “west” in any prehistoric society
bore any direct relation to our concepts, or meant anything at all. And yet a
common trait among historical and modern indigenous communities, par
ticularly in the Americas, is to conceive the cosmos to be divided (horizon
tally) into four parts. This is known as a quadripartite cosmology. Within
such a worldview, “east” might refer to what we would describe as a range
of directions around due east. But there is no reason a quadripartite cos
mology must divide the horizon into exactly equal quarters, or for each part
68 Cardinal Directions
Pure Mathematical Physics



to be centered upon one of “our” cardinal directions. Indeed, quadripartite
cosmologies are commonly related to the sun, so that the easterly direction
is not a complete quarter of the horizon but that part within which the sun
rises at some time during the year.

Casa Rinconada
Casa Rinconada was the largest of the great kivas in Chaco Canyon. Kivas
were subterranean circular buildings used as meeting places or for sacred
ceremonies. In Chaco they were generally built with their roofs at ground
level, within the central plazas of Great Houses such as Pueblo Bonito,
where over thirty-five examples, great and small, are to be found. Casa Rin
conada was unlike the other kivas in both these respects. It was built on its
own, separately from any Great House, and while the dirt floor was 3.5 me
ters (twelve feet) below the surrounding ground level, its walls protruded
above the ground. It measured twenty meters (sixty-six feet) across, and its
vast roof (of which no trace remains) was supported by four vertical timber
uprights placed near the center. There were entrances to the north and
south, and around the outer wall were twenty-eight regularly spaced niches
together with six larger, irregularly spaced ones.
During the 1970s, archaeoastronomers were apt to scrutinize ancient
monuments anywhere in the world for potential solar and lunar alignments
reflecting those that had been so famously proposed a decade earlier at
Stonehenge in England; Casa Rinconada was analyzed closely in this regard.
However, as these early investigators had to admit, the roof was a problem.
Only through what seems to have been a single window in the north-north
east could sunlight (or moonlight) actually have entered the kiva, and the
best they could come up with was that after sunrise at the summer solstice,
a beam of sunlight entering through this window could have illuminated one
of six niches that, for some unfathomable reason, were built slightly larger
than the rest. However, the window in question has been reconstructed and
its original position is uncertain, and even if it is in the original position, it
seems that one of the four roof supports may have been in the way. All of

this serves to illustrate the dangers of naïve “alignment hunting.”
It also obscures a more fundamental property of the orientation of
Casa Rinconada. The kiva was cardinally aligned: its main axis (through the
entrances) was due north-south, and it was also broadly symmetrical about
the east-west axis. The intention, surely, was cosmological. Creation myths
that have come down to modern indigenous peoples in the vicinity tell how
the first kiva was circular to reflect the circle of the sky, and conceptual prin
ciples that result in a quartering of space in relation to the cardinal directions
are commonplace among indigenous North American groups to this day. As
archaeoastronomer Ray Williamson concluded back in 1982, Casa Rin
conada “was meant to serve as an earthly image of the celestial realm; . . . it
was not an observatory, but a ritual building whose structure reflects the
central place astronomy had in ancient Pueblo religious practice” (Aveni
1982, p. 205).
It is even more intriguing that principles of cardinality seem to have ex
tended into the landscape. In 1978, archaeologist John Fritz drew attention
to the fact that three major Chaco structures, the Great House of Pueblo Alto
to the north of the canyon, Casa Rinconada within it, and Tsin Kletzin, an
other Great House on the mesa to the south, lie on a north-south line. This,
argued Fritz, was the main axis of the city. The two largest Chacoan build
ings, Chetro Ketl and Pueblo Bonito, lie on either side of this axis, almost
equidistant from it, and on an east-west line. Fritz’s contention was that these
two cardinal axes were of fundamental importance in the minds of the Cha
coans, a theory that received a dramatic endorsement with the subsequent
discovery of what has become known as the (Great) North Road, which ex
tends the north-south axis physically northwards for at least fifty-five kilo
meters. Archaeologist Steve Lekson has extended this idea still further, argu
ing the existence of a “Chaco Meridian” that extended from Aztec, over
eighty kilometers (fifty miles) north of Chaco, right down to Paquime in mod
ern Mexico, a staggering 630 kilometers (390 miles) to the south.
An investigation in the 1980s of the orientations of the principal walls
of Chacoan Great Houses showed that only four out of fourteen of them
were aligned cardinally. However, three of the four lie on Fritz’s axes: Pueblo
Bonito (north-south) and Pueblo Alto and Tsin Kletzin (both east-west).
Casa Rinconada itself was also cardinally aligned, as we have already seen.
Only Chetro Ketl stands out as an exception, its principal wall oriented at
an azimuth of about seventy degrees. The fact that all but one of the build
ings situated on the cardinal axes were themselves cardinally aligned surely
adds strength to the idea that the cardinal directions and Fritz’s axes were of
fundamental importance. (Conversely, all but one of the buildings not lying
on these axes were not cardinally aligned.)
During its first half-century of existence, archaeoastronomy has ma
Casa Rinconada 71
Pure Mathematical Physics



tured considerably as a discipline, moving on from “alignment hunting” to
addressing culturally relevant questions. In the same period, Casa Rin
conada has been transformed from a building containing numerous poten
tial solar and lunar alignments (an idea that never really resonated with the
cultural evidence) to a central point within an astronomically referenced sa
cred landscape.

Catastrophic Events
Unexpected events in past skies, such as eclipses or the appearance of
comets and meteors, could cause fear and even social disruption. In partic
ular, they could threaten the power of elites, which was often predicated on
being able to control the celestial bodies and keep them regular and pre
dictable.
It has been suggested by some astronomers that cometary activity
might have been much greater at certain epochs in the past, resulting in pe
riods when sightings of spectacular comets and meteors were much more
common. One such period occurred during the second millennium B.C.E.,
causing considerably more “active” skies, and the unrest that these caused
brought about significant social and political upheaval, together with
abrupt changes in beliefs systems in many parts of the world. The astro
nomical arguments remain controversial, but even if one accepts them,
there are problems on the archaeological side. For sure, major social and
ideological changes affected many human societies all round the globe dur
ing the second millennium B.C.E., but one has to question whether this pe
riod was much different from any other era in the last few millennia in this
respect. In any case, the impact of fearsome sights in the sky on any partic
ular group of people would have depended greatly upon all the other, more

localized problems that were of concern at the time. The sky was important,
but it wasn’t everything.
Since the 1990s, increased cometary activity in the past has engendered
a great deal of interest, but largely for another reason: the increased proba
bility of physical impacts from small meteorites hitting the earth. Though de
rived from the same astronomical cause, this is a fundamentally different is
sue in human terms. Meteoritic impacts have a direct physical outcome.
Even a small meteoritic impact can have a devastating short-term effect on
the climate, causing atmospheric dust, which leads to growth-free “cold
summers” over vast areas.
And such effects did happen, which is clearly shown by evidence from
dendrochronology (tree-ring dating). This dating technique is capable of as
signing individual growth rings in particular timbers to a particular year. As
a result, we know that during certain years in the last five millennia, there
was virtually no significant tree growth anywhere in the northern hemi
sphere. The years with the most severe climatic downturns were 2345 B.C.E.,
1628 B.C.E., 1159 B.C.E., and 536 C.E. When these events were first identified
Catastrophic Events 73

Pure Mathematical Physics



in the tree-ring record, the cause was suspected to be volcanic eruptions, but
the Northern Irish dendrochronologist Mike Baillie has argued strongly
against this. If one accepts that the cause of some or all of the climatic down
turns was indeed a meteoritic impact, this does not mean such impacts were
more likely in the past; on the contrary, they may be as likely today as ever.
Whatever did cause these climatic downturns, questions about their im
pact on the Earth’s population at the time can only be addressed by carefully
piecing together fragments of archaeological, historical, and environmental
evidence. In the meantime, the popular wave of interest in meteoritic impacts
that ensued in the late 1990s generated everything from theories of global
catastrophe and revolutionary social change throughout the world in the
mid-sixth century C.E. to totally unsustainable ideas that Stonehenge in Eng
land was built to observe and predict meteoritic impacts.

Celestial Poles
See Celestial Sphere.
Celestial Sphere
The earth is surrounded by stars at various distances, but when the night
sky is viewed on a clear night from anywhere on the earth, it appears that
all the stars (and other celestial objects) are fixed onto a huge sphere sur
rounding the observer. From any given place at any given time, roughly half
of the sphere is visible above the horizon, provided that there are clear
views unobscured by things like trees or buildings. The other half is below
the horizon and invisible.
74 Celestial Poles
Pure Mathematical Physics



The earth rotates in space once a day, and the stars are effectively mo
tionless. (They are actually in motion with respect to one another, but gen
erally the effects of these proper motions are so negligible that they will not
affect the configurations of the stars in a way detectable with the naked eye
over many tens of thousands of years or more.) This means that from the
viewpoint of an observer on the earth, the celestial sphere appears to rotate
around him or her once a day, with all the stars affixed to it. (The fact that
the observer is not at the center of the earth is of little consequence except
in the case of the moon, for which lunar parallax must be taken into ac
count before we can determine the position of the moon in the sky, either
now or in the past.)
If we are interested in how human societies perceive the sky, as opposed
to what modern physics and astronomy can tell us about the universe, then
it is how the sky appears rather than how it actually is that is important.
Thinking in terms of the celestial sphere enables us to define a number of
fundamental concepts that are extremely useful in discussing ancient skies.
For example, on this rotating sphere we can identify an equator and
two poles. The latter are called the north and south celestial poles, and they
are directly overhead as viewed from the north and south poles respectively
on the earth. More generally, and most usefully, we can define lines of lati
tude (declination) and longitude (right ascension), which allow us to specify
the position of any star on the sphere.

Celtic Calendar
The concept of a Celtic calendar that divided the year into eight precisely
equal parts, marked by festivals on the solstices, equinoxes, and mid-quar
ter days, has influenced archaeoastronomy for decades and does so still, in
that many people continue to perceive monumental alignments upon sun
rise or sunset on the equinoxes or mid-quarter days as inherently signifi
cant. Certainly pre-Christian calendrical festivals existed, such as Imbolc,
Beltaine, Lughnasa, and Samhain (celebrated in modern pagan traditions at
the beginning of February, May, August, and November, respectively), and
continued to be important, for example, in early medieval Ireland. How
ever, we should not accept uncritically the notions that their precursors
Celtic Calendar 75
Pure Mathematical Physics



were both widespread within Iron Age Europe and precisely determined.
The whole concept of Celtic culture is now generally felt to be problematic,
with many archaeologists arguing that it has more to do with modern per
ceptions of ethnicity than with historical or archaeological evidence of any
widespread conformity between cultures in the European Iron Age. Given
these uncertainties, the idea of a precise and all-pervasive Celtic calendar
must be treated with considerable caution.
Nonetheless, there are indications that a precise division of the year
into eight parts, based on observations of the sun, might have existed in pre
Roman times. Chief among these is the Coligny calendar, a bronze tablet
about 1.5 meters by 0.9 meters (five feet by three feet) in size (though found
in fragments, some of which were missing) dating to the second century C.E.
It is a public calendar covering five years, with dates and festivals marked,
and it is luni-solar in character: a late remnant of an indigenous calendar
from the pre-Roman world. Lunar months alternating between twenty-nine
and thirty days, and even intercalary months, are marked; but so, too, are
dates that recur once every three months or so, each mysteriously marked
“PRINI LAG” or something similar. These dates occur at intervals of ninety
one, ninety-three, ninety-one, and ninety-two days—intervals of almost ex
actly one quarter of the year (which has 367 days in the Coligny calendar).
It has been suggested that they actually mark Celtic quarter-day festivals.
Regardless of the “Celticity” of the indigenous calendar in this region
of southern Gaul (the calendar was discovered about eighty kilometers [fifty
miles] from Lyon), the vital question is whether it provides solid evidence for
a pre-Roman calendar in which the main seasonal festivals were timed by
counting off exact numbers of days in the solar year. In view of the fact that
the indigenous calendar concerned was clearly lunar-based, this seems very
unlikely. Perhaps the regular intervals were introduced as part of the process
of making the existing calendar conform to the Roman system.

Ceque System
The capital of the Inca empire, Cusco (or Cuzco), was at the heart of a huge
scheme of sacred geography. At the very center was the Temple of the Sun,
known as the Coricancha (“golden enclosure”). The entire Inca empire was
partitioned into four divisions known as suyus, a division that was so fun
damental in Inca thought that the Inca name for their own empire was
Tahuantinsuyu (“four parts”). The boundary lines separating the four suyus
radiated out from Cusco, indeed from the Coricancha itself. This much is
known from the accounts of several different chroniclers; but one of the
most thorough and meticulous, Bernabé Cobo, tells us of the existence of
no fewer than forty-one (or forty-two) such radial lines, and he records that
they were known as ceques (or zeq’e).
The spiritual order of the Inca empire was based around shrines called
huacas (or wak’a), sacred places for the worship of gods, prayers, and sacri
fices. Huacas were often located at places that were in some way special or
exceptional, such as caves, springs, mountain peaks, bends in rivers, or un
usual rocks or trees. Cobo recorded well over three hundred huacas in the
vicinity of Cusco, documenting each of them individually. Three hundred
thirty-two of them were located on one of the ceques, with a number more
that were not part of the system; none of the ceques contained fewer than
three shrines, and a couple had as many as fifteen. The ceques, however,
were more than just lines along which the sacred places lay. They were also
linked in various ways to social relations and the division of labor. Accord
ing to Cobo again, each ceque was given over to one of the three main so
cial classes (those directly related, less directly related, or unrelated to the
Inca ruler), and it was the responsibility of representatives of that social
group to take care of its huacas and to carry out the appropriate ceremonial
activities there. Protocols for assigning representatives of different family
groups (ayllus) to communal work activities, such as the maintenance of ir
rigation canals, were also governed by the ceque system. In these and vari
ous other ways, the ceque system made many of the principles of Incaic so
cial and political organization tangible in the landscape.
Cobo’s accounts seem to indicate that the ceques were conceived as
System 77

straight lines diverging radially from the Coricancha, the symbolic center of
the world, and extending out into the cosmos. This way of organizing
things spatially—lines radiating out from a center—seems to extend well
back into pre-Inca times, evident, for example, in the lines on the desert at
Nasca. It is also evident in the quipu—recording devices consisting of knot
ted strings—which can be laid out in a radial fashion, and has even survived
to the present day in the layout of some of the more remote and traditional
Andean villages.
It has been suggested that some of the Cusco ceques were astronomi
cally aligned. Cobo’s account of various huacas includes hilltops where mon
uments were placed that marked the sun’s arrival at significant dates, such
as the times to sow crops. This leaves open the question of where the hilltop
huacas were to be viewed from, but archaeoastronomical investigations sug
gest that in some cases, at least, the answer was “along the ceques.” A re
lated claim is that some of the ceques radiating out from the Coricancha hit
the visible horizon at astronomically significant points such as the rising and
setting of the sun at one of the solstices, something that is not surprising
given that various chroniclers describe horizon observations of the sun from

cilitate the observations. However, the evidence for the solstitial ceques is far
from conclusive.
Anthropologist and historian Tom Zuidema has gone considerably fur
ther by suggesting that the ceque system was linked directly to an elaborate
ritual calendar based neither upon solar observations nor upon lunar phase
cycle (synodic) months but upon sidereal months. A sidereal month, the time
it takes for the moon to complete a circuit through the stars, is two days
shorter than a synodic month, lasting 27.3 days. This may seem like a very
esoteric concept, but it is a cycle that is particularly noticeable near the equa
tor (where the celestial bodies rise and set almost vertically) by observing
what stars the moon (whatever its phase) appears on a level with, for exam
ple, as it rises. This is done, for instance, by the Borana in east Africa.
Zuidema’s interpretation was triggered by the fact that the number of
huacas recorded by Cobo in the vicinity of Cusco, which he took to be 328,
is exactly equal to the number of days in twelve sidereal months. Each
huaca, then, according to Zuidema, corresponded to a day in the calendar.
This might well be dismissed as speculative nonsense, a mere numerical co
incidence, except that Cobo tells us that acts of worship (such as sacrifices)
took place at the various shrines in a sequential order, proceeding from one
to the next, working gradually round the Cusco horizon. What of the re
maining thirty-seven days in each seasonal year? These, according to
Zuidema, represented the period of time when the fields lay fallow between
last harvest and first planting. These were “dead days” when no ceremonies
took place at any huaca, and corresponded to the time when the Pleiades
were invisible, being too close to the sun. The various strands of evidence in
support of Zuidema’s ritual calendar at Cusco are highly complex and hotly
disputed, but the interpretation remains a highly intriguing one.
It has become evident, however, that we would be unwise to interpret
the ceques too literally as a set of dead straight lines radiating out into the
landscape from the center of Cusco. During the 1990s, archaeologist Brian
Bauer conducted a field project around Cusco aiming to identify the actual
locations of as many as possible of the original huacas. His conclusion was
that the ceques were not straight at all, but actually zigzagged through the
landscape. The huacas, according to Bauer, were defined by the innate power
of places themselves, and they were subsequently grouped into ceques. They
were certainly not placed on preconceived lines. In other words, the huacas
defined the ceques, not the other way round.
It is possible, then, that some earlier work on ceque alignments has
been misconceived. On the other hand, the non-straightness of the ceques
does not detract from the fact that the whole landscape was evidently full of
sacred and special places at which, for example, the sun was observed to rise
or set on certain days of the year as seen from others. This is quite clear from
System 79
Pure Mathematical Physics



the chroniclers’ accounts. We might conclude that Incaic perceptions of
straightness do not accord with ours. But it may simply be that the ceques,
although often straight over relatively small distances that could easily be
sighted along, became more sinuous as they stretched out over the wider
landscape. The ideal may not have been matched by the reality, but perhaps
this was not a critical concern in practice.
In sum, the ceque system was undoubtedly both a basic organizing
principle of the Inca empire and a mechanism of political control. The ex
tent to which it was also a manifestation of calendrical principles and prac
tices is likely to be debated for a long time to come.

Chaco Canyon
The sight of the Great Houses of Chaco Canyon—vast multistory con
structions containing scores, and in a few cases hundreds, of rooms built in
a dry and inhospitable valley—is nothing short of extraordinary. These and
other architectural edifices were built by the ancient Puebloan peoples who
occupied the canyon and the surrounding area between about C.E. 950 and
1125. The largest Great House, Pueblo Bonito, covers an area of 1.8
hectares (4.5 acres) and contains seven hundred rooms arranged in an ir
regular semicircle round a central plaza. The building increases in height

from a single story by the plaza up to an incredible five stories next to the
outer wall. In the plaza itself were numerous kivas—underground chambers
built for religious ceremonies—of various sizes, including two “great kivas”
around fifteen meters (fifty feet) across.
The canyon has also been the focus for a variety of archaeoastronomi
cal theories that, as much as anything, illustrate the changing focus of the
discipline since its early development in the 1970s to the present day. For ex
ample, a hot issue in the 1970s was whether a rock-art pictograph painted
on one of the canyon walls depicted a particular supernova explosion in C.E.
1054. Another discovery that attracted a great deal of popular attention was
the “sun dagger”—an interplay of sunlight and shadow on two spiral pet
roglyphs high up on the isolated pinnacle of Fajada Butte at the eastern en
trance to the valley. Finally, there have been the inevitable studies of orien
tations and alignments, which in the early days followed a paradigm that
had been established in the context of British stone monuments: this was to
search for alignments upon a predefined set of astronomical targets consist
ing of the horizon rising and setting positions of the sun at the solstices and
equinoxes and of the moon at the lunar “standstills.”
These early approaches tended to be motivated more strongly by an in
terest in the nature of the astronomical practice itself than by an interest in
Chaco Canyon 81

the culture within which the practice operated. More recently, there has been
a closer convergence between the questions asked by archaeoastronomers
and the broader social issues of greater interest to archaeologists at large.
Archaeologically, one of the most intriguing questions about Chaco is
why social organization and architectural technology should have reached
such impressive heights in such an improbable place, and how they were
supported. It is clear that a huge and well-organized infrastructure was
needed, for example, in transporting tens of thousands of large timber beams
for the construction of floors and roofs over distances of a hundred kilome
ters (sixty miles) or more from the nearest forests. A key issue is the size of
the resident population. It seems unthinkable that the scant food sources
available could have supported a population that filled all the rooms of the
Great Houses, and this, together with other factors such as the preponder
ance of kivas, invites the suggestion that the canyon was first and foremost
a religious center, with a relatively modest number of permanent residents.
If so, then it was likely controlled by an elite who exerted both ideological
and political control. One suggestion is that pilgrims are likely to have con
verged here in considerable numbers at particular times, and that these times
would have been astronomically determined.
In recent years, convincing evidence has emerged that the houses, kivas,
roads, stairways, and even middens around Chaco formed a carefully planned
“ritual landscape” centered upon the Great Houses of the canyon itself.
Within this scheme of things, it is perhaps not surprising that a number of
buildings seem to have been deliberately oriented along one or the other of
the cardinal directions, or else display a strong degree of symmetry about
their north-south and/or east-west axes. Similar principles seem to have ex
tended to the layout of buildings within the landscape, with several of the
principal ones lying on an east-west axis and a north-south axis, which cross
in the valley. When these axes were first discovered, many dismissed them as
fortuitous rather than deliberate, but this changed with the subsequent dis
covery of the (Great) North Road, which connects with the north-south axis
and runs due north from Chaco for more than fifty kilometers.
Astronomy, then, was part of the conceptual framework that lay be
hind the location and design of many of the principal Chaco constructions
at least on a basic level, since the north-south direction is ultimately defined
in relation to the daily rotation of the celestial sphere about the celestial pole.
This may not sound too exciting to a modern astronomer looking for astro
nomical “sophistication” (as defined in his or her own terms), but it is ex
tremely interesting from a cultural perspective, because it suggests a degree
of continuity of worldview extending down to the present day. The princi
ples that defined the spatial layout of Chaco buildings and their landscape
were apparently derived from a quadripartite cosmology—a perceived divi

sion of the world into four quarters around some central place. Such divi
sions have persisted as a characteristic feature of indigenous North Ameri
can worldviews up to modern times.

Chaco Meridian
Chaco Canyon in New Mexico was at the heart of a bustling landscape.
Not surprisingly for a major cultural center, trackways converged on it
from the surrounding villages and settlements. However, some of these
make little practical sense in terms of communication or the transportation
of goods. Typically a few meters (fifteen–thirty feet) wide, these “roads”
were created by digging out topsoil or clearing away surface rocks and were
sometimes lined with stone or adobe kerbs. And they ran almost perfectly
straight, sometimes for several kilometers, completely disregarding the to
pography. (In this sense they bear more than a passing resemblance to some
of the Nasca lines in faraway Peru.) Sometimes they were multiple, with up
to four roads running in parallel. When they approached the steep walls of
the canyon itself, rather than deviating to find easier routes down into the
valley, they descended directly via precarious steps carved into the living
rock (supplemented where necessary by less durable devices such as ramps).
At first, these roads were thought to connect the Great Houses of Chaco
with outlying villages or sacred sites many tens of kilometers away, but
many of the roads running out from the canyon (or from outlying sites and
Chaco Meridian 83
Pure Mathematical Physics



pointing back toward Chaco) stop short after a few kilometers—seemingly
functioning as symbolic pointers only.
One, which has become known as the (Great) North Road, is much
longer and particularly remarkable. This nine-meter-wide road runs north
wards from Pueblo Alto, one of the earlier structures in the Chaco Canyon
area (built about 1020 C.E. over a pre-existing Great House), continuing
through the landscape for more than 55 kilometers (35 miles) before reach
ing another canyon (Kutz Canyon) at a site known as Twin Angels Pueblo.
Allowing for a dog-leg westwards along the canyon floor, another stretch
striking out northwards would have brought the North Road a total of
eighty-five km (fifty-three miles) to Aztec, a major cultural center in the Four
Corners area where construction began just as major construction activity
ceased at Chaco: in the early twelfth century.
The orientation of the North Road, and especially the main extant
stretch from about three kilometers (two miles) north of Pueblo Alto north
ward to the southern rim of Kutz Canyon, is impressively close to the true
north-south direction—the meridian. The southernmost third of this fifty
kilometer (thirty-mile) section heads only half a degree west of north, where
upon it turns slightly and heads two degrees east of north for the remainder.
The whole of this stretch of road therefore remains within a conceptual
north-south corridor little more than one kilometer wide. What determined
its orientation? Did it simply join together two already existing places? The
chronological evidence seems to rule out this idea. Instead, the construction
of the road seems to have coincided broadly with the time when construc
tion activity was just commencing at Aztec (and Chaco was on the point of
falling into sudden decline).
Is the alternative possible, then, that the orientation defined the loca
tion of Aztec? If so, we must first ask the question of whether the cardinal
orientation of the road was deliberate. The layout and design of the struc
tures in Chaco Canyon itself strongly suggest that the answer is yes: many of
the Great Houses and kivas in the canyon, such as Casa Rinconada, were
built on a cardinal orientation, and some of the principal ones were them
selves placed on cardinal axes within the landscape. Yet the orientation of
the road was not so precise that one has to postulate the use of anything but
basic surveying techniques. More impressive is the principle—the strength of
belief that determined not only that a number of minor pueblos should be
situated along the road, but that a major new center should be constructed
on this very axis, connected, as it were, back to the source. This principle is
also demonstrated elsewhere in the landscape around Chaco, where several
roads (conceptually, if not actually) connect later buildings to earlier ones.
(Examples also occur elsewhere in the world. One is the Neolithic stone cir
cle and henge at Avebury in England, where a stone avenue [the Kennet Av
84 Chaco Meridian
Pure Mathematical Physics



enue] ran for over two kilometers [1.5 miles], connecting the great henge to
a centuries-older multiple-timber circle known as the Sanctuary).
Why was the north-south direction important? The answer suggested
by the evidence from the layout of Chaco itself is that it was cosmologically
significant—it was part of structuring the landscape according to the pre
vailing worldview. And the motivation for doing this, to judge from count
less similar practices the world over, was to keep human action fundamen
tally in harmony with the cosmos and hence to ensure well-being and
stability.
In the late 1990s, archaeologist Steve Lekson proposed a radical new
theory, suggesting that the North Road was only part of a far longer con
struction that he terms the “Chaco Meridian.” Its southern extension, he
suggested, stretched southwards from Chaco Canyon for a staggering 630
kilometers (390 miles) into modern Mexico, to the most important regional
center in the period C.E. 1250–1450: the city of Paquime. Lekson’s argument
proceeds as follows. The fact that the three major regional centers of Aztec,
Chaco (that is, its principal north-south axis through Pueblo Alto), and
Paquime lie exactly on a north-south line (to within four kilometers from
east to west) seems an extraordinary coincidence, if coincidence it is. Now
consider their chronology: building at Chaco took place during the period c.
950–1125; Aztec c. 1100–1275; and Paquime c. 1250–1450. As soon as one
city was abandoned, it seems, another rose up in its place. The implications
are clear. For some reason—perhaps an environmental disaster triggered by
overexploitation of local resources—the controlling elite were forced to
abandon Chaco in the early twelfth century. When this happened, having
staked out a north-south line on which their new center had to lie and iden
tified a suitable spot on that line, they subsequently relocated there. In the
late thirteenth century there was an extended drought in the Four Corners
area, and that the whole vicinity suffered extensive depopulation. So the elite
moved again, but this time they followed the Meridian southwards—a long
way south.
These ideas are challenging and controversial, but their social and cog
nitive ramifications are profound, in that they challenge two long-held no
tions concerning what is now the Southwest between C.E. 900 and 1450. The
first is that the peoples of the Southwest were organized into a variety of po
litical units essentially operating on a local scale, though communicating via
networks of trade and exchange. But the sheer scale of the Chaco Meridian,
and the idea that the controlling elite could have uprooted themselves so far
north and then, a few generations later, several times as far in the opposite
direction, seems to contradict this idea. Instead, it is possible that a vast re
gion stretching from the Four Corners area to northern Mexico could have
been economically and politically integrated, and furthermore, that this sit
Chaco Meridian 85
Pure Mathematical Physics



uation might have prevailed for a considerable time.
The second controversial notion is that social and economic change
was driven purely by environmental factors. Not that there is any reason to
doubt the conventional view that the two abandonments were driven by en
vironmental catastrophes (although a number of questions surround the
first, in particular). The point is that the locations of the new, alternative
cities—first Aztec and then Paquime—were primarily determined by con
straints existing within people’s own minds. The manner in which worldview
influences action in numerous other human cultures suggests the following
explanation. Chaco was conceived as the very center of the cosmos. That
center could not be shifted arbitrarily, since this would introduce further dis
order into the world. Only by extending the world axis north and south
could a new center, appropriately connected back to the old one and to the
existing order, be established and thus continuity—and survival—be assured.
Whatever new evidence is brought to bear upon the Chaco Meridian in
the future, Lekson’s theory serves as a fine illustration of a much broader
general principle: human action in the past was typically determined by a
mix of factors, some of which seem to us wholly pragmatic and others purely
conceptual. In the context of another worldview, what is “in the mind” and
what we would view as “objectively real” influences in the external world
are not separated but woven together.

Chaco Supernova Pictograph
The walker exploring the trail northwestward up Chaco Canyon toward
the ruins of Peñasco Blanco—one of several Great Houses built in the
canyon by Anasazi peoples in the tenth and eleventh centuries—passes a
number of notable rock-art panels, but one in particular is remarkable in its
simplicity and power. At one point, high up the vertical sandstone cliff that
forms the side of the canyon, some 6 meters (20 feet) off the ground, is a
narrow overhang. And painted on the bottom of this are three straightfor
ward designs: a (life-sized) hand, a ten-pointed star, and a crescent—surely
a depiction of the crescent moon.
86 Chaco Supernova Pictograph
Pure Mathematical Physics



This site has achieved particular notoriety because it has been claimed
to be a representation of a supernova—an exploding star, previously invis
ible to the naked eye, that suddenly grows spectacularly in brightness. The
supernova in question is one that astronomers know to have occurred in
C.E. 1054 and which was certainly recorded by the ancient Chinese. It is of
ten referred to nowadays as the Crab supernova, because the aftermath of
the explosion is visible to astronomers today as a cloud of gas in the con
stellation of Taurus known as the Crab Nebula. For a few weeks the new
star was significantly brighter even than the planet Venus and visible in
broad daylight.
Anyone who has seen Venus and the crescent moon close together,
hanging low in a clear blue and otherwise empty twilight sky, will know just
what a conspicuous sight this is. In 1054, though—in the early morning of
July 5 (in today’s Gregorian calendar)—an even more extraordinary sight
would have greeted anyone sheltering by the cliff looking eastwards into the
predawn sky. On this morning, the crescent moon would have appeared
right next to the supernova, and the suggestion is that this is precisely what
the Chaco pictograph represents. (It is a pictograph rather than a petroglyph
because it is painted onto, rather than carved out of, the rock.)
A number of factors seem to support this argument. First, the date fits
with the archaeological evidence of when Anasazi activity reached such ex

traordinary heights in this apparently inhospitable valley, with the construc
tion of numerous Great Houses and kivas. Second, the juxtaposition of the
crescent moon and star in the pictograph fits the actual configuration visible
in the sky on that July morning in 1054. Third, several other rock-art sites
in the western United States have been interpreted as depictions of the same
event. And finally, there is independent evidence of the ancient Chacoans’ in
terest in astronomy, manifested most famously in the interplay of sunlight
and shadow on the “sun dagger” petroglyph on Fajada Butte at the eastern
entrance to the canyon.
Nonetheless, even if we accept that the crescent is an unmistakable rep
resentation of the crescent moon, is the star necessarily the Crab supernova?
The answer, of course, is no. The “star and crescent” is one of the most per
vasive astronomical symbols among humankind, particularly in the Islamic
world. It is usually taken to represent the crescent moon and Venus, which
aside from transient phenomena such as supernovae—is the brightest object
in the sky apart from the sun and moon. Eye-catching conjunctions of the
crescent moon and Venus occur at quite frequent intervals (several times dur
ing each eight-year period that it takes Venus to return to essentially the
same place relative to the sun and stars). Could the juxtaposed star and cres
cent symbols in the Chaco pictograph simply be depicting one of these con
junctions of the crescent moon and Venus? They clearly could: just because
one rather attractive and exciting interpretation seems to fit the evidence, we
cannot accept this as incontrovertible proof if there remains at least one
equally plausible, though slightly more mundane, alternative.
Another uncomfortable question is: what is the hand doing there? It
has been argued that it is merely a symbol showing that the place is sacred,
but its presence might also suggest the uncomfortable possibility that these
three icons belonged together as a triplet, conveying symbolic meanings
perhaps, rather than (two of them but not the other) representing some
thing “literal” in the sky.
What characterizes all these arguments is that they are based on specu
lations that pay no attention to the cultural context. In fact, all of them are
rendered futile by an observation made by a Zuni ethnographer almost as
soon as the supernova interpretation was originally proposed, back in 1975.
The modern Zuni have sun-watching stations for calendrical observations,
and traditionally mark them using a pictograph with four elements: a cres
cent, a hand, a star, and a sundisk. Although more worn and less visible,
there is indeed a sundisk accompanying the other symbols on the overhang.
This, surely, was a sun-watching station: astronomical certainly, but with
nothing at all to do with the Crab supernova.

Chinese Astronomy
The political history of ancient China was no less turbulent than that of
many other parts of the world. From about 4000 B.C.E. onwards it devel
oped from a multitude of farming villages into warring local chiefdoms, and
these gradually confederated into larger competing states ruled by powerful
dynasties. The best known of these are the Shang and Zhou, which succes
sively controlled ever greater swathes of eastern China during the second
and first millennia B.C.E. Yet despite all this social turmoil, a characteristic
cultural tradition emerged that is instantly recognizable in arts, crafts, and
architecture. One reason is that it arose in geographical isolation from other
developing cultures farther west. In 221 B.C.E., China was unified, thus
forming one of the world’s greatest empires. Further great dynasties, such
as the Han, T’ang, Song, Yuan (when China was under Mongul control),
Ming, and finally the Qing, endured until the Chinese revolution of C.E.
1911. Imperial China is characterized at various stages by impressive and
highly distinctive developments in scholarship, literature, and art.
Many aspects of Chinese astronomy, from ancient times to the later im
perial dynasties, are equally distinctive. Some of the earliest Chinese records
of astronomical events, for example, are found on divinatory devices known
as oracle bones that date to the Shang and Zhou dynasties. These were ani
mal bones or turtle shells heated with a hot needle until cracks appeared in
their surface. The shape of the cracks provided prognostications used by
kings to assist in affairs of state. Fortunately for modern scholars, the prog
nostication was recorded on the bone itself, together with the eventual out
come (tending to confirm that the prognostication was correct). Some oracle

Pure Mathematical Physics



bones relate to astronomical events, including both solar and lunar eclipses,
and form the earliest Chinese records of such phenomena.
In the ensuing centuries and millennia of China’s imperial era, the
recording of occurrences in the skies became systematized. Yet in China, un
like (for example) in ancient Babylonia, a clear distinction was maintained
between what we might see as scientific (astronomical) and divinatory (as
trological) traditions. The first was predicated on the regularity of calendri
cal cycles, which could be established through careful observation and
recording and then reliably predicted. The latter concerned unpredictable
phenomena, which had divinatory significance: these were omens to be
noted and acted upon. There were even separate practitioners: experts in cal
endrical methods and experts in celestial patterns (whom we might choose
to categorize as astrologers). Both were highly valued state employees. The
goal of the state astronomers, and their principal raison d’être, was to pro
duce ever more detailed and accurate almanacs that would reinforce (percep
tions of) the emperor’s control of order in the cosmos. The purpose of the as
trologers, on the other hand, was to warn the emperor of portents in the skies
and aid him in making crucial decisions. Rulers felt they had a mandate from
heaven, but if they ignored signs of approval or disapproval and failed to act
accordingly, consequences could be dire. The two sets of records—calendrical
and astrological—combine to bequeath us an unparalleled data set of obser
vations of astronomical events, both regular and recurrent (such as planetary
motions) and transient (one-off), such as the appearance of comets, novae,
meteor showers, aurorae, sunspots, and of course eclipses.
Occasionally, a form of celestial phenomenon would pass from the do
main of divination to that of calendrics when its underlying regularity was
discovered. The classic example of this in the Chinese case is that of lunar
eclipses. Around the year 0, the Chinese discovered a cycle of ten years and
334 days (135 lunations), which, like the longer Saros cycle discovered by
the Babylonians, defines a period after which a lunar eclipse will tend to re
cur. With this discovery lunar eclipses essentially became predictable, and
while they continued to be recorded, they ceased from this point to have any
significance as omens.
A landmark in ancient Chinese astronomy was the development of a
distinctive reference system that enabled specialists to map stars, to note the
positions of the sun, moon, planets, or transient phenomena, and to reckon
time at night. This was the system of twenty-eight xiu or lunar lodges.
These are best conceptualized as twenty-eight regions into which the sky
was divided like the segments of an orange and which were identified by
convenient stars and asterisms situated within them. If the xiu had been of
equal width, the moon would have moved from one to the next in each
twenty-four-hour period. However, the widths varied considerably, and the
92 Chinese Astronomy
Pure Mathematical Physics



moon could spend two or three nights in a very wide xiu, but only a few
hours in a narrow one.
In Imperial China, astronomy was inextricably linked to the supreme
power of the emperor, who was seen as uniquely able to harness the sacred
forces of the heavens and preserve the balance and harmony of the cosmos in
the service of the people. This power was reflected (and the emperor’s right
to rule thereby reinforced) both in the spatial layout of the palace and in the
timing of appropriate rituals. From the Ming dynasty (fourteenth century)
onwards, the imperial palace—otherwise known as the Forbidden City—was
in the heart of Beijing and was approached along the meridian, directly to
ward the north celestial pole, which was seen as the very heart of the heav
ens. The Emperor moved around the sacred capital on prescribed paths at dif
ferent seasons, leaving the palace so as to undertake rituals at various nearby
shrines at the appropriate times. Two of the most important ceremonies took
place at the solstices, when the emperor was required to actively assist in the
transitions between the seasons. At winter solstice, he ascended the Round
Mound, the highest part of the Temple of Heaven complex to the south of the
Forbidden City, climbing up from the south and publicly paying homage by

himself facing the center of the heavens in the north. At other times, subjects
permitted to visit the emperor in the Forbidden City were required, similarly,
to approach his throne—the center of the earthly realm—from due south.
Chinese astronomers established an impressive record in the develop
ment and construction of astronomical instruments. One of the most re
markable is a giant gnomon, in the form of a brick tower, built by the as
tronomer Guo Shou Jing in C.E. 1276. This enabled Guo to establish the
length of the tropical (seasonal) year with an error of only twenty-six seconds.
A collection of large Bronze instruments that were used for mapping and
timekeeping can now be found on the roof of the Old Observatory in Beijing.
However, it is as well to remember the context in which these achieve
ments took place. There was certainly a demand for ever greater astronom
ical and calendrical precision, but it resulted ultimately from the perceived
need for the emperor to maintain cosmic harmony. In other words, the rea
sons astronomy was maintained at such a high level for so long in Imperial
China were ultimately ideological and political rather than purely scientific,
at least as we would see it.

Christianization of “Pagan” Festivals
Wherever a ruling elite seeks to impose or stimulate a change in the domi
nant religious beliefs of the populace, as when controlling a new population
following a victory in war, they may tear down old places of worship and
build different ones on the same sites, replace existing sacred myths and sto
ries with ones that reflect the new ideology, and introduce novel rites and
ceremonies in the hope of eliminating the existing ones. This is as true of
the spread of Christianity as of any other religion. Throughout history,
new Christian churches have been placed on the sites of “pagan” temples.
This process is particularly evident in the Republic of Georgia, where the
conversion to Christianity occurred as early as the fourth century C.E., and
archaeologists excavating under early churches are wont to discover pre
Christian temples built several centuries earlier. Where indigenous reli
gious festivals were timed in relation to the calendar, or tied to particular
astronomical observations, it made sense to schedule the new Christian
festivals to coincide with them, thereby upstaging them. A well-known ex
ample of this is the timing of Christmas to coincide with pre-existing win
ter solstice festivals; likewise, the feast of St. John is scheduled close to the
summer solstice.
The result was the transformation of pagan festivals into Christian
ones, but the original meaning was not always lost. In Mexico, for example,
the feast day of St. Michael, as observed in the village of San Miguel del Mi
lagro in the state of Tlaxcala, preserves some aspects of ancient observances
relating to mountain and fertility gods.
It has been supposed that the timing of certain Christian feasts on mid
quarter days reflects the Christianization within Europe of earlier Celtic fes
tivals dividing the year into eight equal parts. The best known of these is the
feast of All Saints, which takes place on November 1, on the traditional date
attributed to the Celtic festival of Samhain. The notion of a Celtic calendar
that was widespread through western Europe in the Iron Age and provided
an accurate division of the year into eight equal parts is problematic. Yet
there is no doubt that a significant pagan “start of winter” festival somehow
became transformed into a Christian festival. Its main association now, in
many parts of the world, is with the dead, but this probably came later.

Church Orientations
Christian churches generally point eastwards. Liturgical traditions dating
from medieval times associate the direction east—the rising place of the
heavenly bodies and particularly of the sun—with the resurrection of Christ
and the dawning of the “day of eternity” for righteous souls. Worshipers
therefore face, symbolically, their eventual home in paradise.
“East,” however, evidently did not necessarily mean “due east.” The
orientations of many churches actually deviate from true east by consider
able amounts. In modern times church builders were often constrained by
the space available within densely populated towns and cities, so this is
scarcely surprising, but in earlier centuries and in rural settings such limita
tions seldom existed. Given the care and attention that were afforded to
many other aspects of a church’s construction, it seems inconceivable that
their orientations were merely poor attempts at facing due east. The ques
tion, then, is how the direction in which a given church should face was de
termined in practice. What motives and procedures led to the resulting ori
entations is seldom clear from surviving historical accounts or liturgical
texts, and the question has fascinated a number of scholars in recent years.
There have been various suggestions, the main ones of which nearly all
relate in some way to the rising sun. One is that churches simply needed to
face within the eastern quarter of the horizon; the details were not impor
tant. A second is that they needed to face within the solar arc—toward a
point on the horizon where the sun would rise at some time in the year—but
again, the actual position within this range was not important. A third sug
gestion is that they faced the rising sun on the day when the foundations
were set out. A fourth: they faced sunrise on the feast day of the saint to
whom the church was dedicated. A fifth: they faced sunrise on the equinox.
And a sixth possibility: they faced sunrise at Easter. The list is not exhaus
tive, and it is not at all improbable that different traditions and practices held
sway in different places and at different times.
Occasionally, we have historical evidence of a particular practice. For
instance, there is clear support for the third suggestion in seventeenth and
eighteenth century England. Historian Sir Henry Chauncy, in a book de
scribing the historical antiquities of Hertfordshire written at the end of the
seventeenth century, reported a common practice of aligning the foundations
in the direction of sunrise. Over a century later, the poet William
Wordsworth graphically described a similar practice far away in the county
96 Church Orientations
Pure Mathematical Physics



of Westmoreland. Those who were charged with building Rydal Chapel kept
vigil through a whole night, waiting for the sun to appear, at which time they
carefully laid out the foundation stones and thus ensured that the building
and especially the high altar—would be correctly placed. The night con
cerned was not chosen arbitrarily: it was the night preceding the feast day of
the church’s patron saint.
Nevertheless, it is possible that Chauncy, Wordsworth, and others were
merely expressing a romanticized notion rather than hard evidence. For that,
we need to measure the orientations of particular churches and compare
them with sunrise on the day when construction began, or with sunrise on
the patronal feast day. Sadly, the date when construction started was rarely
recorded; what mattered was the date of consecration of the completed
church. Identifying the patronal feast day can also give us problems, since we
do not always know the saint to whom the church was originally dedicated.
Even where the church is still in use, the modern patron may not be the same
as the original one.
In most cases, the only evidence remaining is from the orientations of
the churches themselves. Here we must be careful, since so many churches
have been partially rebuilt, extended, or altered since their original con
struction. It is certainly necessary to pay strict attention to historical records
of construction phases where they are available. How can the orientations
themselves help us choose between the six possibilities already mentioned?
The answer is that if we observe a large enough group of churches con
forming to a common practice, then the resulting spreads of orientations
should be distinctively different. At all but the most northerly latitudes
(above about 55°N), general orientation within the solar arc would result in
a narrower range of orientations than general orientation within the eastern
quarter, but both practices would simply result in a fairly even spread of ori
entations within this range, perhaps concentrated toward the middle. Orien
tation on sunrise on the day of laying the foundations would also result in a
spread of orientations throughout the solar arc, but concentrated toward the
ends if the foundation dates were spread evenly through the year. This is be
cause the change in the sun’s rising position from day to day is much smaller
close to the solstices.
In order to investigate the remaining possibilities, we must determine
more precisely the dates on which the sun rose at a particular spot on the
horizon. For this, it is necessary to take into account the altitude of the hori
zon and to convert azimuths (orientations) into declinations. Orientation of
sunrise on saints’ days would result in sharp spikes corresponding to sun
rise on a few specific dates in the year. (Here we encounter another com
plication: the dates in many cases would have been determined according to
the Julian calendar rather than the modern Gregorian calendar.) Orienta
Church Orientations 97

tion on equinoctial sunrise should result in a single, reasonably sharp con
centration of declinations, but quite possibly significantly offset from the
true (astronomical) equinox, both because of the use of the Julian calendar
and depending upon how the equinox was determined in practice. Easter
sunrise orientation, finally, would result in a wider spread of orientations,
yet much narrower than the whole solar range, since it would correspond
to sunrise over the four- or five-week period following the vernal equinox
(again, reckoned in the Julian calendar for earlier churches) where Easter
could fall.
In recent years, some studies of the orientation of churches of various
ages in eastern Europe, Austria, Italy, and Great Britain have supported the
idea of orientation upon sunrise on patron saints’ feast days. There is also
evidence of solstitial and equinoctial orientation among thirteenth- and
fourteenth-century churches in Hungary and elsewhere. The significance of
these dates in medieval times is unquestionable: as early as the fourth cen
tury, feasts marking the births of Christ and John the Baptist had been es
tablished at the two solstices, together with feasts marking their respective
conceptions (the Feast of the Annunciation and the Feast of the Visitation)
at the two equinoxes. Other surveys, however, have concluded that pa
tronal orientations never even existed. It seems that problems of data selec
tion, together with a lack of rigorous statistics, may lie at the heart of these
inconsistencies.
A recent systematic study of the orientations of medieval village
churches in central England, by the American archaeoastronomer Stephen
McCluskey, has revealed a complex picture that does not fit cleanly any of
the six models. McCluskey restricted his sample to around a hundred
churches that were dedicated to four particular patrons: Mary, John the
Baptist, All Saints, and Andrew. The related feast days would be the spring
equinox, the summer solstice, November 1, and November 30. While the
orientations of the churches all fit comfortably within the solar arc—facing
the direction of sunrise at some time in the year—they did not correlate
with the four relevant saints’ days. Instead, the spread of orientations cor
responded broadly to the date range from mid-February to mid-April (or in
the late summer and autumn, the period from early August to early Octo
ber) in the Julian calendar. This spread is too narrow to fit the “any time of
year” model, yet too wide to fit the “Easter” model. There is no obvious,
simple explanation, and it seems likely that a number of different traditions
and practices were operating, even within this confined group of churches.
However, certain preferences do stand out. For example, All Saints
churches were preferentially oriented upon sunrise on the (Julian) spring
equinox, something that may be explained in liturgical texts connecting the
day of eternity—“god’s eighth day”—with (strictly?) eastward orientation,
98 Church Orientations
Pure Mathematical Physics



and with all the saints. Another, unexpected, trend is that the naves of
churches of St. John the Baptist tend to point westward toward sunset on
the feast of the conception of this saint on the autumnal equinox. Was this
their defining characteristic?
Despite the patchiness and evident complexity of the data, there seems
little doubt that astronomical observations, and particularly observations of
the rising sun, were commonly used to determine the orientations of me
dieval churches all over Europe. Such practices may have continued well into
early modern times, especially in rural areas. The investigations of such is
sues to date have only touched the tip of the iceberg: the evidence is exten
sive and remains largely unexplored.

Circles of Earth, Timber, and Stone
The practice of building circular, or at least roughly circular, enclosures and
monuments was widespread in Europe in the Neolithic and Bronze Age. In
Britain, for example, some of the earliest farming communities in the fourth
millennium B.C.E. built earthworks known as causewayed enclosures. These
Circles of Earth, Timber, and Stone 99
Pure Mathematical Physics



are mostly fairly circular, although some are highly irregular, and most of
the examples are in southern England. They seem to have had a range of
purposes, but they were almost certainly places where people from small
surrounding communities came together. Later in the Neolithic, more regu
lar circular earthworks known as henges started to appear, as did circles of
upright timbers and circles of standing stones. Henges are generally more
regular (better approximations of true circles) than causewayed enclosures.
They consist of a ditch and exterior bank, usually with one or two en
trances, and vary in size from a few meters across to the large henge enclo
sures or superhenges such as Avebury in Wiltshire, southern England. The
large henge at Avebury is some 350 meters (1,150 feet) across, had a ditch
some nine meters (thirty feet) deep and a bank eight meters (twenty-five
feet) high, and surrounds an entire village. (Ironically, the name henge was
coined for a type of monument that was like Stonehenge but without the
stones; the name Stonehenge means “hanging stones” in Old English. The
irony is that, by the generally accepted definition we have just given, Stone
henge is not actually a henge; its earthen enclosure has the bank on the in
terior of the ditch.)
In trying to understand the purpose and meaning of this type of monu
ment, it is less helpful than was once thought to classify them primarily by the

type of materials used, that is, as earthen circles, timber circles, or stone cir
cles. This is because these do not form three separate categories—far from it.
Excavations suggest that many circles of uprights were probably sculpted first
in wood and then repeated in stone, a good example being Temple Wood in
Argyll, western Scotland. Many henges containing stone circles have survived
into modern times (e.g., the Ring of Brodgar and Avebury), although the se
quence of chronological development is seldom clear without excavation.
Others contained timber circles, and Woodhenge, situated some three kilo
meters (two miles) east-northeast of Stonehenge, contained no fewer than six
concentric ellipses (some have suggested that they represent the postholes of
a roofed building, but this has been the subject of intensive debate). Finally,
Stonehenge itself represents an earthen circle with an interior ring of timber
uprights, later superseded by the famous constructions in stone.
Stone circles (whether built as such or as elements of more complex
sites) survive relatively well and the remains of many of them are still con
spicuous in today’s landscape. Timber uprights, on the other hand, have long
since rotted away, perhaps leaving postholes that might one day be discov
ered by excavation. Many earthen ditches have long since filled in and banks
been ploughed away, only to be revealed, where we are lucky, in cropmarks
visible from aerial photographs. It is a reasonable supposition that the num
ber of timber and earth circles built in Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain was
at least comparable with, and possibly considerably greater than, the num
ber of stone circles.
Why build a circle? On the face of it, a circle is the simplest way to
mark off an area of sacred space, but there may be a great deal more to it
than that. Important cognitive principles surely lay behind such monuments
and helped determine how they were integrated into the landscape. The later
prehistoric circles of earth, timber, and stone were surely places where peo
ple gathered, very likely for formal or ritualistic activities or observances.
Perhaps, in some cases, only a privileged few were allowed to take part. The
presence of apparently formal approaches to some sites, such as the earthen
avenue that leads into Stonehenge and the stone avenues leading into Ave
bury, suggests that the experiences of the participants were carefully orches
trated. The permeability of the boundary is clearly important: there would
have been a world of difference between undertaking a private observance
inside a large henge with a high outer bank, cut off from the wider world
and hidden from outside view, and giving an open performance inside a
stone circle, feeling fully a part of that wider world. The British archaeolo
gist Richard Bradley has identified a number of examples where circles seem
to have been “closed off” over time, perhaps as part of a wider process of
making both the places themselves and what went on there less generally ac
cessible, more limited to a privileged few.
Circles of Earth, Timber, and Stone 101

One possibility, for which there are plenty of historical and ethno
graphic parallels, is that many of these circles might have been conceived as
central places, conceptual centers of the world. It is even possible that the cir
cular shape might have been intended, at least initially, to be a reflection of
the visible horizon, and that some circles might have been perceived as a mi
crocosm encapsulating and reflecting the properties of the wider cosmos in
various ways. Following this idea, a number of British archaeologists have
explored various ways in which the properties of the surrounding world
might have been reflected at these sites. The possibilities include the shape of
a ring reflecting the surrounding topography, the shapes of stones in stone
circles reflecting the shapes of hills behind them, and alignments (e.g., of en
trances) toward sources of water. Unfortunately there are so many possibil
ities that it is difficult not to be entirely subjective.
Nonetheless, it is by this route that the alignment studies undertaken by
archaeoastronomers for many years have begun to dovetail within the
agenda of archaeologists interested in wider issues of cognition and cosmol
ogy. For astronomers, it is stone circles that have attracted most attention,
since they leave readily surveyable remains above the ground and (subject to
vegetation cover) alignments that can still be directly viewed. Nonetheless,
some important astronomical features of timber circles have been noted,
such as the orientation of Woodhenge, which, in common with Stonehenge
itself and another henge in the general vicinity, Coneybury (which has now
been obliterated), faces northeastwards toward midsummer sunrise.

once a day. These are known as circumpolar stars. Roughly speaking, these
will be the stars whose declination, when added to your latitude on the
earth, comes to more than 90°. For example, at latitude 40°N, all those
stars with a declination greater than about 50° will circle around in the sky.
The exact figure will depend upon the altitude of your northern horizon.
The same is true if you are in the southern hemisphere, except that the
south celestial pole is now the relevant one, and the declination of the star
(negative) plus your latitude (also counted as negative for the purpose) must
now add up to less than –90°. In other words, at latitude 30°S, the circum
polar stars will be those with a declination less than about –60°.

Clava Cairns
Neolithic passage tombs, of which the most famous and impressive exam
ples include Newgrange in Ireland and Maes Howe in the Scottish Orkney
Islands, are found extensively in Ireland and also in significant numbers in
the more northerly parts of Scotland. In a cluster around the northern Scot
tish city of Inverness are found a few more modest examples of the genre,
which dating evidence suggests were constructed at a relatively late date
around the year 2000 B.C.E. The so-called Clava cairns derive their name
from a concentration of seven such monuments at Balnuaran of Clava, on
the southern banks of the river Nairn some eight kilometers (five miles) east
of Inverness. They comprise two types: the passage tombs (or passage
graves) themselves and ring cairns, cairns surrounded by a circular raised
bank but without a passage. Circles of standing stones surround several ex
amples of both types.
Orientation was clearly an important consideration when a Clava cairn
was being constructed. The orientations of the passages, where they exist,
fall without exception within a quarter of the compass between west-south
west and south-southeast. The encompassing stone circles tend to have their
stones graded in height with the tallest in the southwest. The southwesterly
preference in the orientations of these monuments appears to follow a dom
inant tradition very similar to the one that controlled the broadly contem
porary recumbent stone circles found farther to the south and east.
The most evident concentration of cairns at Balnuaran of Clava com
prises two passage tombs and a single ring cairn, all surrounded by stone cir
cles. The two passage tombs are arranged so that their passages are directly

in line with each other. The ring cairn, although placed between them, is
slightly off to one side and does not obscure the alignment. Alexander Thom
visited the site as part of his extensive campaign in the 1950s and 1960s to
survey many hundreds of Scottish megalithic monuments. He noted that the
two passages were not only directly in line with each other, but also closely
aligned upon midwinter sunset. Twenty years later the archaeologist Aubrey
Burl completed a study of the Clava cairn orientations and concluded that,
while the solstitial alignment was not generally repeated at other sites, the
whole group had a consistent, broader pattern of orientation related to the
moon. The simplest interpretation is that it related to the midsummer full
moon. In this respect, again, the Clava cairns seemed to have much in com
mon with the nearby recumbent stone circles. As it happens, the direction of
midwinter sunset falls within the broader lunar range, and the obvious con
clusion from considering the monuments systematically as a group was that
their significance was in fact lunar, with the specifically solar alignment at
Balnuaran of Clava itself being a fortuitous occurrence within this range.
The Clava cairns stood for almost twenty years as a clear example of how
studying a group of monuments as a whole can modify, and constrain, “one
off” interpretations of individual sites.
All this changed in the late 1990s when another British archaeologist,
Richard Bradley, commenced excavations at Balnuaran of Clava. One of his
principal conclusions was that structural risks had been taken in order to
conform to prevailing norms that (to our view) have no practical value—in
deed, that seem to run counter to common sense. These included grading
the heights not only of the surrounding stone circle but of the kerbstones
and other stones within the cairn that governed its structural integrity: the
tallest were placed on the southwestern side, something that made the over
lying cairn structure inherently rather unstable. This confirms the impor
tance of orientation but also hints at a much richer set of prevailing sym
bolic or aesthetic principles that governed the construction of these
monuments.
Another extraordinary fact revealed by the excavations was that the
various stones used in the construction of the cairns were often not, struc
turally speaking, best suited for the job. The choice of stone often seems to
have had more to do with color than with (what we would see as) practical
necessities such as size, shape, or strength. Most intriguing of all, stones of
certain colors predominated in different parts of the cairns—with, broadly
speaking, a preference for white stones facing sunrise in the east but red
stones facing sunset in the west. Changes in color seem to have been related
to the directions of solstitial sunrise and sunset. It is here that Bradley’s dis
coveries provide a direct challenge to the lunar conclusion: they suggest that
the predominant symbolism at the site was solar. This, combined with the
104 Clava Cairns
Pure Mathematical Physics



very fact that the solar alignment is so precise—the setting midwinter sun
shone down the full length of the passage—argue strongly that the solar
symbolism, and particularly the solstitial alignment, were deliberate.
The wider issue that this conclusion raises is methodological. Every
aligned structure must point somewhere, and we must seek corroborating
evidence if we wish to increase our degree of belief that any particular align
ment upon a specific astronomical target was actually intentional or, at the
least, came to mean something to certain people in the past. There are two
main ways to do this. The first is to investigate whether the alignment is re
peated at similar monuments in the locality. The second is to seek a broader
range of contextual evidence relating to the case in question: evidence that
could inform us about the broader symbolic principles prevailing in that par
ticular instance. The example of Balnuaran of Clava shows the potential of
both methods, but also shows that they can be in direct conflict, and raises
the question of how we can best achieve a reconciliation in such circum
stances. One solution may be to postulate that this site, evidently the most
complex and sophisticated in the Clava cairn tradition, incorporated a layer
of symbolism relating to the sun that was additional to the more common
place, and more basic, relationship to the moon.

Cobo, Bernabé (1582–1657)

first-hand accounts of a number of chroniclers in the first two or three
generations following the conquest. Some of these were early settlers
priests, administrators, soldiers, and the like—and others were natives or
of mixed blood.
Bernabé Cobo was a Spanish-born Jesuit priest and missionary who
settled in Peru in 1599. He spent thirty years on various postings in South
America, mostly in southern Peru and northern Bolivia, before moving to
Mexico in 1630. During this time he observed and meticulously recorded a
wealth of information about animals, plants, and people and their customs.
In 1650 he returned to spend the last few years of his life in Peru.
Cobo is best known for his multivolume work History of the New
World, eventually completed in 1653. Although it appeared over a century
after the Spanish conqueror Pizarro first entered Cusco in 1533 and included
a good deal of secondary material taken from earlier chronicles, some now
lost, it provides one of the most detailed and wide-ranging accounts of prac
tices and beliefs in the Inca world and is generally considered one of the most
reliable. But for Cobo, we would know little if anything of the elaborate sys
tem of ceque lines that surround the Inca capital of Cusco, conceptual lines
that defined and controlled social divisions as well as sacred space.

Coffin Lids
Unlike those of Babylonia, the astronomical records of ancient Egypt, if
they once existed, have generally not survived. It is possible that they were
recorded on papyrus rather than on clay tablets, as was the Babylonian
case. So-called pyramid texts, found inside tombs and coffins dating back
as far as Old Kingdom times (c. 2600–2100 B.C.E.), and the younger “cof
fin texts” of the First Intermediate Period and the Middle Kingdom, do list
various celestial bodies that represent deities, but they are in no way records
of observations; their primary concern is with the passage of the soul to
eternal life. The architecture of temples and pyramids in Old Kingdom
times gives us some insights into how astronomical considerations affected
106 Coffin Lids
Pure Mathematical Physics



and determined their construction. However, our main source of informa
tion about the development of astronomy and calendrics during Middle
Kingdom Egypt comes from wooden coffin lids.
A modest number—about twenty—of such lids survive, dating mainly
from the Ninth and Twelfth Dynasties (c. 2160–1780 B.C.E.). Painted scenes
preserved on the inside incorporate arrays of hieroglyphs, typically forty
rows long by thirteen columns wide. Each box in the array contains a name,
and these were, for the most part, repeated along diagonals. The overall ef
fect is of a checkerboard pattern with diagonal stripes, but there are nu
merous glitches—where a diagonal alignment of symbols jumps by a col
umn, for example.
What was their purpose? The remarkable broad consistency between
them, despite individual differences, suggests an elegant answer that makes
sense in view of our broader knowledge of ancient Egyptian calendars and
clocks. Each box in the grid contains the name of a star or star group known
as a decan. In a typical table, three rows contain each of the names that ap
pear elsewhere: these are a list of the thirty-six available decans. The re
maining thirty-seven rows, containing the nearly diagonal grid, with its oc
casional glitches, represent the thirty-six weeks of the Egyptian civil
calendar—each ten days long—together with the epagomenal period of five
additional days that made up the year. For any given week, the names read
ing across the row represent the decans whose rising marked the successive
“hours” during the night (these divisions of the night, unlike our hours, var
ied in length). A week later, each will rise roughly an “hour” earlier, which
explains the diagonal pattern. However, since the position of the stars is ir
regular, it would not have been possible to choose decans that were evenly
spaced across the sky, and this helps to explain the glitches.
Although they are often called diagonal calendars or diagonal star
clocks, these were not instruments as such, but arrays of tabulated data.
They helped the priest determine the time of night for nocturnal observances.
For any given week in the civil year, the user could read off the stars whose
appearance in the east would mark a particular hour in the night. We must
also bear in mind that the data tables we find on the coffin lids were not ac
tually functional—except, presumably, in the sense that the deceased would
take them to use in the afterlife. The tables that actually served as priestly
aids have not survived. In any event, each of them must have become obso
lete relatively rapidly, because of the slippage of the civil calendar relative to
the seasonal year by one day in every four years, and by a whole ten-day
“week” after only forty.
The coffin-lid calendars were probably copies of the tables that the
priests actually used. It is likely that these copies were made by artists who
were not astronomical experts (unlike the creators of the actual tables). Per
Coffin Lids 107
Pure Mathematical Physics



haps they made mistakes in the transcription. Indeed, this may well explain
other anomalies in some of the coffin-lid tables that do not seem to have an
astronomical explanation. Reasonable as this sounds, it creates a headache
for the modern interpreter. Do particular features reflect astronomical real
ity or were they merely errors in the transcription? To what extent did accu
racy actually matter? It is hardly surprising that a definitive identification of
all of the decans has eluded modern scholars and continues to do so at the
present time.

Cognitive Archaeology
In order to probe the nature of astronomy in prehistoric cultures we must
turn to the material evidence available in the archaeological record. Yet it is
technological rather than cognitive achievement that is most obviously
recorded there, in the form of artifacts such as stone axes and metal
weapons, and constructions such as flint mines and megalithic monuments.
Hence the traditional three-age system (Stone, Bronze, Iron) for categoriz
ing periods in prehistory. Since the 1960s, environmental archaeology has
provided a range of evidence pertaining to climate, landscape, and vegeta
tion, as well as health and diet. Although this evidence has helped reveal
many details of human subsistence activity in relation to the environment,
such as developments in animal husbandry and agriculture, the emphasis is,
once again, primarily technological. Social archaeology gained popularity
in the 1970s, as people became more interested in political and economic
108 Cognitive Archaeology

relationships, structures, and spheres of influence. Archaeologists could
make deductions from distributions of monuments and estimates of the
work (and hence the labor organization) involved in their construction. But
understanding prehistoric cognition always remained a more distant goal.
Only in the 1990s, in the wake of intensive debates about archaeological
theory and method that took place during the two previous decades, has
cognitive archaeology begun to seem a feasible field of study.
We may be able to make specific deductions about the mental processes
that made possible a particular technological achievement. For example, it
seems clear that the layout of the sarsen circle and trilithons constructed at
Stonehenge in around 2400 B.C.E. using massive stones weighing up to forty
five tons must have been carefully planned before each one was manually
hauled overland to the site, a journey of over thirty kilometers involving a
huge expenditure of labor. From this we can deduce that certain people, at
least, possessed a level of numerical and geometrical skills that included the
ability to produce a scaled-down plan or model, perhaps constructed in
wood; the ability to deduce from that model the numbers, sizes, and shapes
of stones actually required; the means to communicate the appropriate num
bers and measurements to the place from which the sarsen blocks were be
ing brought; and the ability to determine the place of erection of each stone.
But even this tells us nothing about the ideas and beliefs that led them
to conceive of constructing the sarsen monument in the first place. For this,
we need to develop a broader framework—a body of theory that suggests
more general relationships between human thought and material remains,
and more disciplined methods by which we can extrapolate from objects and
patterns in the archaeological record to concepts in people’s minds. This is
sue has been the subject of extensive debate among theoretical archaeolo
gists, and there is no simple answer.

Comets, Novae, and Meteors
The majority of objects we see in the night sky move in regular and readily
recognizable cycles, but a few phenomena are much more sporadic. These
include meteors, or “shooting stars”; comets, which at their most spectac
ular are seen as bright, blurry patches with a long tail; and novae, new stars
that appear where nothing was visible before.
Meteors are by far the most common of the three. On almost any night
a patient observer can see a random shooting star fleetingly passing from one
point in the sky to another. In fact, shooting stars are not stars at all but
small particles of dust that fly into the earth’s atmosphere (or, to put it an
other way, the earth flies into them), whereupon they burn up. When they
are unusually large and close to the observer, they can appear as bright and
colored fireballs. Occasionally a small fragment of rock, or a meteorite, will
fall to earth; large meteorites are rarer still but can cause local damage or
even environmental catastrophe. Meteors often occur in systematic bursts
known as meteor showers, with scores or even hundreds visible in the space
of a few hours. When watching these closely, an observer soon notes that all
110 Comets, Novae, and Meteors
Cometary observations made by English astronomer Edmond Halley in 1682. Halley deduced that comets seen in 1531, 1607, and 1682 were in fact the same comet and correctly predicted its return, which happened in 1758. The comet was then named in his honor. (Library of Congress)
Pure Mathematical Physics



the shooting stars appear to radiate from the same point in the sky. It is as
though the earth is heading at breakneck speed toward this spot, rushing
past stationary points of light. This is, in fact, pretty much what is happen
ing, since the earth’s orbit is passing through a stream of material (although
the material in the stream is itself in orbit). This means that many meteor
showers occur regularly, around the same date each year, when the earth’s
orbit passes through the same region in space. However, varying conditions
can mean that while in some years a given shower will be strikingly visible,
in other years it will pass almost unnoticed.
Comets can be truly spectacular, their tails stretching far across the sky,
and a few are so bright that they can be seen in daytime. Such occurrences
are relatively rare, though. The best examples in the last two centuries were
seen in 1811, 1843, 1861, 1882, and 1910. The best example in the later
twentieth century (which, though impressive, did not compare with any of
these) was Comet Hale-Bopp in 1997. The appearance of any particular
comet, and how this varies from night to night, depends on many factors and
differs considerably from one comet to another. A comet may take several
weeks to reach its maximum brightness or do so extremely rapidly, and it
may only be at its most striking for a day or two. Some comets recur regu
larly—the most famous being Comet Halley, which reappears roughly every
seventy-six years—but these comets cannot always be relied upon to be con
spicuous on every occasion (indeed, Halley passed almost unnoticed in
1986). In practice, then, the appearance of a bright comet to peoples in the
past—even those who kept accurate records, such as the Babylonians and
Chinese—was unpredictable.
While the majority of stars shine constantly with little perceptible vari
ation for literally billions of years, some are variable and a few—known as
novae—are liable to sudden outbursts that cause their brightness to increase
considerably. However, the most incredible phenomena of this type are the
so-called supernovae—stars that literally explode or implode and whose
brightness, as a result, suddenly increases by a huge factor. When super
novae occur relatively close to us (in astronomical terms), then what before
was invisible to the naked eye suddenly makes its appearance as a guest star,
which, in some cases, can outshine everything in the sky apart from the
moon and sun. There have been no great supernovae in the last four cen
turies and only around eight have been reliably recorded in historical times.
The earliest, in the constellation of Centaurus, was recorded by Chinese as
tronomers in C.E. 185, although there is some dispute about whether this
was actually a supernova. The most recent was Kepler’s Supernova of 1604.
It has been suggested that a guest star that appeared in 1054, and was cer
tainly recorded by the Chinese and possibly by others in Asia and Europe,
was also recorded in North America. However, the idea that a famous pic

tograph at Chaco Canyon was a depiction of this supernova does not with
stand close scrutiny.
Any unexpected and conspicuous occurrence in the sky—including so
lar and lunar eclipses as well as rare meteorological phenomena—has the po
tential to cause panic and even social upheaval. The political control wielded
by ruling elites often rests upon a spiritual power derived from their appar
ent links with the heavens. Unanticipated and unnerving celestial events can
serve to undermine this power, sometimes catastrophically.

Compass and Clinometer Surveys
To determine the astronomical potential of a horizon point we need to meas
ure its azimuth and altitude and then calculate the declination. Where we are
concerned with possible alignments set up to within about half a degree or
better (half a degree is roughly the diameter of the sun or moon), this is best
done using a theodolite. However, when the accuracy required is not as great
as this, a magnetic compass together with a clinometer may well be sufficient.
To be suitable for the task of determining the azimuth, a compass must
be of the prismatic variety, enabling the user to view a distant object, a sight
ing mark (such as a vertical line), and the scale all at the same time. The
measurement obtained is the magnetic bearing, or clockwise angle from
magnetic north, as opposed to what is needed, which is the azimuth or clock
wise angle from true north. To convert a magnetic bearing into a (true) az
imuth, one must know the difference between true north and magnetic
north. This difference—which is sometimes known as the magnetic declina
tion, a term that can cause considerable confusion with (astronomical) dec
lination—varies from place to place and time to time. Values for a particu
lar place and time can often be obtained from topographical maps, or from
various web sites on the internet. It is important to make sure that the cor
rection is applied in the right direction: if magnetic north is to the east of true
north, then the (true) azimuth will be greater than the magnetic bearing; if it
112 Compass and Clinometer Surveys
Pure Mathematical Physics



is to the west then the (true) azimuth will be less.
A clinometer, or inclinometer, performs a similar task for measuring al
titudes except that the zero point is determined simply by leveling a bubble
before taking the reading, so that no further calibration is needed. Some
manufacturers produce combined compass-clinometers as a single instru
ment, which are extremely useful for the archaeoastronomer.
Using a compass and clinometer has some clear advantages over using
a theodolite. They are light and easily portable instruments, which is a ma
jor advantage if a site is difficult of access. There is no need for preliminary
setting up and no need to take supplementary readings such as timed obser
vations of the sun, which have the added problem of being dependent upon
the weather (since a clear view of the sun is needed).
However, the compass also has some disadvantages. The main one is
that the reading it gives can be affected by magnetic rocks or other magnetic
materials close by (steel-rimmed glasses, for example). It is desirable to take
various precautions, such as keeping metal objects well away from it, and
measuring alignments in both directions wherever possible—the bearings
should be 180 degrees apart. Best of all is to calibrate the readings from a
particular location by measuring one or two reference points whose location,
and hence true azimuth, can be determined independently from maps or dig
ital topographic data. For this, one needs to know one’s own location to
within, typically, a few meters; this can be determined using another portable
instrument, the GPS receiver.
Many archaeoastronomers prefer to use a theodolite, while others ar
gue in favor of a compass and clinometer. Which instruments are best in any
given instance actually depends upon the problem being addressed.

Constellation Maps on the Ground
It is often claimed, especially in popular accounts of archaeoastronomy,
that human artifacts or constructions were laid out on the ground in the
form of groups of stars in the sky. One such idea is that a group of temples
at Angkor in Cambodia were laid out in the shape of the constellation
Constellation Maps on the Ground 113
Pure Mathematical Physics



Draco. Another claim is that the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt were laid out
in the form of the three stars of Orion’s Belt. Groups of cup-like depressions
resembling the Southern Cross and other constellations have been found on
rock platforms in Aboriginal Australia.
Given that there is no independent evidence to support the supposi
tion that any of these correspondences was intentional, we must ask how
likely it is that they could have arisen by chance. (The patterns of stars in
the sky, as opposed to their positions, have not changed significantly since
earliest antiquity, so insecure dating is not a problem.) The chances of be
ing able to fit a random set of points on the ground, such as buildings, to
a set of stars in the sky might not seem very great. However, there are a
large numbers of stars in the sky and a lot depends upon the size of the er
rors one is prepared to tolerate. And once the researcher selects some
points and ignores others, the likelihood of a good fit is very greatly in
creased. A British television documentary broadcast in 1999 managed to
fit the locations of selected major public buildings in New York City to the
brightest stars of the constellation Leo with surprising ease. This corre
spondence clearly was not intentional.
We cannot dismiss outright the possibility that, at certain times in cer
tain places in the past, things on the ground were configured to map out,
represent, or reflect constellations in the sky. Anyone proposing this, how
ever, must be able to describe and justify the selections made, provide an ob
jective assessment of the goodness of fit, and determine the probability of the
results obtained being fortuitous. They also face wider problems. First, there
are few, if any, known cultural precedents among historical or modern in
digenous communities for arrangements that map the stars; this will increase
any archaeologist or anthropologist’s inherent skepticism. Second, patterns
visible archaeologically were often created in many stages, over a consider
able period of time, whereas this idea implies that a single planning concept
was adhered to. Finally, the use of some of the more sinuous Western con
stellations, such as Draco, must also arouse suspicions, since which collec
tions of stars are perceived to form a constellation varies from one culture to
another.
A particularly notorious example is the so-called Glastonbury Zodiac.
This theory, which dates back to the 1920s, holds that features in the area
surrounding the isolated hill of Glastonbury Tor, in Somerset, England—an
cient field boundaries, paths, ditches, and banks—mimicked the shapes of
zodiacal constellations. As soon as the evidence is examined in any detail,
however, the arbitrary nature of the whole scheme becomes readily appar
ent. Those fragments of boundaries that best fit the theory are simply as
sumed to be the remnants of ancient boundaries, while others that do not are
discarded. When we do this, we are forcing the evidence to fit the theory
114 Constellation Maps on the Ground
Pure Mathematical Physics



rather than using the evidence to test the theory, which any objective assess
ment soon shows to be unsupportable.
It is not out of the question that some sacred architecture in the past
was laid out to reflect the configurations of groups of stars in the sky. But
without due attention to the cultural context and a strict attention to
methodology, investigations in this area can become no more than a modern
game of fitting stars on a star chart to points on an archaeological map, with
no cultural significance whatsoever.

Cosmology
A cosmology is a shared system of beliefs about the nature of the world
the cosmos—as it is perceived by a group of people. The term worldview is
often used to mean much the same thing, as is (less frequently) the Spanish
term cosmovisión.
How people perceive the world influences what they do and where they
do it. Principles of cosmology may be reflected in domestic architecture and
sacred buildings, the design of great monuments, city layouts, and even
whole landscapes. Numerous examples in the modern world or historically
documented illustrate this point, such as the design of the Navajo hogan, the
Pawnee earth lodge, and the Yekuana roundhouse; the layout of the me
dieval Hindu city of Vijayanagara and of the imperial Forbidden City in Bei
jing; and the landscape around the Hopi village of Walpi.
Cosmology intimately involves astronomy, since the sky is an integral
part of the world that people see around them. But cosmology is not re
stricted to astronomy. In many indigenous communities people freely asso
ciate things and events in the sky with those in the terrestrial world, in spirit
worlds, or in a perceived world populated with beings that, from a Western
scientific point of view, are imaginary and fantastical. Objects and happen
ings in the sky are also seen as intimately connected with actions and occur
rences in the realm of human relations. It is people in the Western world who
Cosmology 115
Pure Mathematical Physics



are exceptional in this respect, separating, in accordance with the Linnaean
tradition, the perceived world into different categories that can be analyzed
using different branches of science such as astronomy, geology, biology, and
the social sciences. (And even in the Western world, despite modern science,
astrology still continues to have a strong influence.) Today, the separation of
the world of everyday concerns from the domain of the sky is exacerbated
by the city lights, which prevent much of the modern population ever (at
least, in the normal course of things) from seeing a really dark night sky.
For many indigenous peoples, on the other hand, and (as we now sus
pect) for virtually every human community way back into prehistory, the sky
is an important if not critical part of the world in which they live, and it is
crucial to keep human activity in harmony with it. Thus, for example, the
traditional seasonal progression of the Lakota through the Black Hills of
South Dakota is kept in tune with the path of the sun as it moves through
certain constellations. The constellations themselves are directly associated
with particular landmarks.
The perceived relationships among people, land, and sky can often
guide human action in what we would see as a pragmatic way. The Lakota
are one example of this, since their annual cycle of movement through the
landscape following the buffalo was necessary for subsistence. Two rather
different examples are the Caterpillar Jaguar constellation of the Barasana
people of the Colombian Amazon and the star Marpeankurrk in Aboriginal
Australia.
Archaeologists can seek to identify cosmological relationships in the
archaeological record—in the orientations of buildings and monuments, for
example—and alignment studies within archaeoastronomy form an impor
tant part of this process. However, spotting associations that might have
had cosmological significance is far from a straightforward task, especially
for the prehistorian, who may have little corroborating evidence other than
the existence of an alignment itself. One problem, clearly, is that any align
ment could have arisen fortuitously. Just because a structure may be
aligned, say, upon a prominent (as it might seem to the modern investiga
tor) hill or the midsummer sunrise does not mean that this was either in
tentional or meaningful—either to the builders or to those who used the
place subsequently. Another problem is that we cannot prejudge the types
of association most likely to have been significant (the possibilities are al
most endless), let alone the actual meaning(s) that might have been ascribed
to them. We have already intimated that prominence is a subjective concept,
and one has to avoid the dangers of a checklist of possibly meaningful types
of association that is formulated in the context of a modern worldview but
may be totally inapplicable in the context of another. This is particularly the
case in seeking astronomical associations such as alignments, where all too
116 Cosmology
Pure Mathematical Physics



often an investigator will approach a site with a ready-made toolkit of as
tronomical targets.
In fact, it is when cosmological considerations act counter to pragmat
ics that they may be most striking in the archaeological record. An excellent
example of this is the passage tomb at Balnuaran of Clava in Invernessshire,
Scotland, where an apparent cosmological necessity, the need to have taller
kerbstones on the southwestern side (following a local tradition evident in
the nearby recumbent stone circles) seems to have resulted in structural prin
ciples being compromised so that the whole cairn was rendered unstable. In
other cases, the arguments about whether an evidently intentional alignment
reflects cosmological, or simply pragmatic, concerns, may be more difficult
to resolve. Thus, the fact that many Iron Age roundhouses in Britain are ori
ented predominantly east- and southeastwards can be interpreted in two dif
ferent ways: first, that it is the result of a pragmatic consideration, an align
ment that allows the warming rays of the morning sun to shine into the
house; second, that the orientation was dictated by cosmological principles,
paralleling many modern examples such as the Navajo hogans and Pawnee
earth lodges already mentioned. And these two explanations are not neces
sarily mutually exclusive.

Crucifixion of Christ
Can biblical, historical, and astronomical data be combined to produce an
exact date for the crucifixion? The question has intrigued Christian schol
ars right back to Sir Isaac Newton and continues to spark fierce debate
from time to time. The Bible places the crucifixion within the period when
Pontius Pilate was procurator of Judaea, C.E. 26 to 36, and other historical
constraints are generally agreed to rule out years earlier than C.E. 29 and
Crucifixion of Christ 117
Pure Mathematical Physics



later than C.E. 34, with C.E. 29 and 34 themselves being unlikely. The bibli
cal accounts also make it clear that the crucifixion took place on the after
noon before the Sabbath began, that is a Friday afternoon, and on the day
before (or possibly on the day of) the feast of the Passover, that is on the
Jewish date 14 Nisan or 15 Nisan. But in which year?
Attempting to answer this question involves correlating two calendars
that are very different in nature. The Julian calendar of the Romans ran in a
fixed and pre-determined way, tied to a solar year of 365-and-a-quarter days
in length and ignoring the actual heavenly bodies. The (Gregorian) calendar
used in the Western world today is directly descended from the Julian one.
The Jewish calendar, on the other hand, was a lunar one and was, at least in
the first century C.E., always regulated by direct observations of the moon.
In the Jewish calendar, the new day begins at sunset, with the Sabbath
having fallen unfailingly on every seventh day since Biblical times. The new
month begins when the new crescent moon first appears in the evening sky.
A major problem, then, in trying to date the crucifixion is that we have to
estimate the likelihood that the new crescent moon would have first been
seen on a given evening or whether it would not have been noticed until the
next. Another problem for us is that an intercalary month needed to be in
serted periodically in order to keep the Jewish calendar in step with the sea
sonal year, and in the first century C.E. this was also done empirically. Al
though in theory the main trigger for inserting an extra month before Nisan
was that Passover should not precede the vernal equinox, it is unclear how
the equinox was itself determined (and to what accuracy), and in practice a
variety of pragmatic criteria seem to have been used, including the availabil
ity (depending upon the weather) of first fruits and sacrificial lambs.
Given all these uncertainties, we cannot obtain a clear-cut answer to the
critical question, which is whether 14 Nisan or 15 Nisan fell on a Thursday
Friday (the Jewish day running from sunset Thursday to sunset Friday) in any
given year, and hence whether one or the other might be a candidate for the
date of the crucifixion. However, the years C.E. 31 and 32 seem to be non
starters. Newton himself favored April 23, C.E. 34, but historical arguments
weigh against this. The clear favorites are generally April 7, C.E. 30 and April
3, C.E. 33. One view favors the C.E. 33 date on the grounds that (as astro
nomical calculations show) a lunar eclipse occurred on that very day. This
seems to accord with the prophecy (Acts 2:20) that “the moon [shall be
turned] into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord comes,”
which some interpret as describing an actual event at the time of Christ’s
death. On the other hand, the lunar eclipse was only partial and in its final
stages when the moon rose: the moon would not have turned red for this rea
son. Furthermore, this and other references in the Bible to the moon turning
to blood clearly refer to Judgment Day rather than to the crucifixion.
118 Crucifixion of Christ
Pure Mathematical Physics



A final difficulty is that if the crucifixion really took place on a Friday,
then it did not allow Jesus to spend three days and three nights in the tomb
before Sunday morning. If one entertains the possibility that the crucifixion
actually happened on a Wednesday or Thursday, then some of the eliminated
years re-enter the frame.
In the end, it is more likely to be historical arguments than astronomi
cal ones that will tip the balance in this issue.

Crucuno
Crucuno is one of a number of megalithic enclosures—settings of standing
stones or boulders arranged to enclose a space—found in two clusters in
Brittany, northwest France. One group is found toward the far northwest
coast, around the modern city of Brest, and the other is found on the south
coast of the Département of Morbihan, around Carnac. Often grouped to
gether under the term cromlechs, some of these enclosures are very roughly
circular or oval, while others are shaped like a horseshoe, a barrel, or a let
ter “D”; a few are closer to a rectangle or square. Crucuno, situated some
five kilometers (three miles) northwest of Carnac, is certainly the most im
pressive of these. The twenty-two stones form the remains of what appears
to have been an almost perfect rectangle, 33.2 meters by 24.9 meters (108.8
by 81.6 feet), oriented in the cardinal directions, with the longer sides east
west. Although the site has been largely reconstructed, the reconstruction
appears to have been done faithfully, so that the layout can be trusted.
Amazingly, this simple structure combines geometrical perfection with
cardinal orientation and astronomical alignment. In addition to being a near
perfect rectangle, the lengths of its sides were in the ratio 3:4. And in addition
to the sides being oriented in the cardinal directions, the diagonals are ori
ented toward the rising and setting positions of the sun at the two solstices.
Yet we should guard against overinterpretation. The ratio of the sides
does not necessarily imply that the builders were aware of the Pythagorean
rule whereby the length of the diagonal is also a whole number of units (5).

It could be just that, for aesthetic or other reasons, they chose to have the side
lengths in the proportion 3:4 instead of, say, 2:3 or 4:5. Then there is the
question of whether the solstitial orientation of the diagonals is fortuitous.
Crucuno is located at a latitude (47.6°N) where, given a reasonably flat hori
zon, constructing a cardinally oriented 3:4 rectangle with its longer sides east
west will ensure the (approximate) solstitial orientation of the diagonals,
whether or not this was intentional. On the other hand, perhaps the solstitial
orientation of the diagonals was deliberate and the ratio of the lengths of the
sides followed, unintentionally, as a result. Either way, it seems inconceivable
that the latitude was deliberately chosen in order to achieve both solstitial ori
entations and Pythagorean proportions at once: the location of the site was
surely determined in relation to the territory occupied by the people who built
it, as is evident from its position within a tightly confined cluster of various
types of megalithic enclosure in the Carnac area. Lastly, it is tempting to iden
tify the east-west orientation as aligning upon the sunrise and sunset at the
equinoxes, but this also makes several questionable assumptions, not least
that the equinox as a concept meant something to people in prehistory.
The Scottish engineer Alexander Thom believed fervently that, in addi
tion to a sophisticated knowledge of astronomy, “megalithic man” knew a
good deal of geometry, including Pythagorean triangles, and used a precise unit
120 Crucuno

of measurement, the “megalithic yard” of 0.829 meters (2.72 feet), in con
structing monuments throughout the length and breadth of Britain, as well as
in Brittany. The evidence he used to support this idea has now been largely re
futed, but it is curious that the 3:4 ratio of side lengths is marked so clearly at
Crucuno and that this implies a unit of 8.3 meters (27.2 feet), which is almost
exactly ten of Thom’s megalithic yards. The most probable explanation is that
a unit of around this length tends to arise through local practices of pacing.
Most of the other recorded stone rectangles in Brittany are in a dilapi
dated state or have been removed entirely, but similarities have been noted
with the station stones at Stonehenge. These four stones marked the corners
of a rectangle whose side lengths were in the ratio 5:12, another Pythagorean
combination yielding a diagonal of length thirteen units. The station stone
rectangle is not cardinally oriented, but its shorter sides are themselves ori
ented upon midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset, while the longer sides
align roughly with an extreme rising position of the moon. This is similar
enough to be intriguing, but different enough that it does not provide com
pelling corroborative evidence.
Nonetheless, despite the many problems and unresolved issues, the fact
that people in the Neolithic or Bronze Age could have encapsulated four dis
tinct characteristics—geometrical and numerological perfection, cardinal
orientation, and astronomical alignments—in such a simple setting is truly
remarkable. We do not have to accept Thom’s megalithic yard at face value
or postulate that the builders conceptualized Pythagorean geometry to ap
preciate this fact.
Nor do we have to assume that the builders chose their latitude in or
der to believe that the solstitial alignments of the diagonals were fully inten
tional. True, Crucuno would not have “worked” if it had been located much
farther north or south. It is also true that such ideal latitudes are few and far
between. For example, a square enclosure with similar properties would
need to be placed much farther north—around Carlisle in northern England
(latitude 55.0°)—and a 3:4 rectangle with its longer sides north-south would
have to be located around latitude 59.6°, somewhat to the north of the
Orkney Islands in northern Scotland. But what seems to us a case of re
markably good luck could, for people living in the Carnac area and unaware
of differences farther afield, simply have seemed an intrinsic property of na
ture. In encapsulating the interconnectedness of geometry and astronomy in
this modest but powerful way, the Crucuno rectangle may have provided a
clear confirmation of the unity and integrity of the cosmos.

Cumbrian Stone Circles
In and around the Lake District, in the county of Cumbria in the northwest
of England, are a group of nine large stone circles in spectacular landscape
settings with panoramic views of the surrounding hills. The British archae
ologist Aubrey Burl has also noted four similar large circles scattered slightly
farther afield—three across the Solway Firth in Dumfriesshire, southwest
Scotland, and one across the Irish Sea in County Down, Northern Ireland
that also seem to form part of this distinctive group of monuments.
These great stone circles are impressive in scale, varying from some
thirty meters (100 feet) to over a hundred meters (330 feet) in diameter. The
largest, Long Meg and Her Daughters, contains sixty-six stones (originally
there may have been up to ninety). Nowhere does the idea that stone circles
were conceived as microcosms, sacred spaces relating to the wider world and
used for ritual performances, seem more appropriate than at some of these
majestic circles in their breathtaking settings.
Astronomical alignments have been noted at a number of these circles.
A large outlier at Long Meg and Her Daughters (Long Meg itself) is located
in the direction of midwinter sunset from the center of the adjacent ring. The
entrance at Swinside is roughly in the direction of midwinter sunrise. One of
the best known of these circles, Castlerigg, contains a number of low-preci
sion alignments noted by Alexander Thom, who considered it “a symbolic
observatory.” Systematic studies of the group as a whole do back up these
initial impressions to some extent, revealing an apparent obsession with the
cardinal directions and the solstitial directions. This may well reflect the ex
istence of quadripartite cosmologies not dissimilar to those so prevalent in
pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and indigenous North America.

Cursus Monuments
In addition to the large numbers of circles of earth, timber, and stone con
structed in Britain and Ireland during the Neolithic and Bronze Age, there
were also a variety of monumental constructions that were linear in form,
including rows of free-standing timber uprights or standing stones. Two
very different examples of the latter are the 2 kilometer- (1.5 mile-) long
Kennet Avenue at Avebury and the many short rows of no more than six
megaliths found in western Scotland and the west of Ireland. The earliest
easily recognizable type of linear monument, however, is the cursus, a pair
of roughly parallel ditches and banks, typically a few tens of meters (one
hundred to three hundred feet) apart, that run for some distance, typically

a few hundred meters. Some eighty examples are known, of which the
longest is the Dorset cursus in southwest England, which runs up and down
across the undulating chalk uplands of Cranborne Chase for a remarkable
ten kilometers (seven miles).
The name cursus derives from the spurious characterization by William
Stukeley in the eighteenth century of one such monument as a racetrack for
chariots. Their actual purpose is far from clear. The dating evidence suggests
that cursuses were constructed in the Early Neolithic, generally within the
later part of the fourth millennium B.C.E., so that they predate many of the
more conspicuous, and hence better-known, British prehistoric monuments.
The so-called Stonehenge cursus, for example, which is located just 1 kilo
meter north of Stonehenge and runs roughly east-west for some 3 kilometers
(2 miles), is scarcely visible on the ground but may well have existed for sev
eral centuries before the earliest discernible activity took place at Stonehenge
itself, and it may predate the arrival of the stones by as much as a whole mil
lennium.
Cursus monuments are found in many parts of Britain with possible
examples farther afield, although the main concentration is in southern
England. Around twenty are known in the Upper Thames Valley alone.
They represent some of the earliest monuments that impacted the British
landscape in a way that is still visible today (though in most cases they are
visible only from cropmarks evident in aerial photographs). They are also
among the most baffling. Were they pathways or processional ways? If so,
it seems strange that in most cases the ends, or terminals, were not open: in
stead, the banks along the sides curved or bent round, closing them off. It
is debated whether the ditches and banks were sufficient to form a physical
barrier, or whether the monuments could have been entered or crossed from
almost anywhere. There is some evidence to support the assertion that they
were cleared of tall vegetation, or at least built through cleared or partially
cleared areas.
Did cursus monuments mark out formalized, or ritualistic, rites of pas
sage? Some, like the Stonehenge cursus, joined two high points in the land
scape, and it has been speculated that they provided some sort of symbolic
link between two settlement areas. On the other hand, at Rudston in York
shire four different cursuses converge upon (or diverge from) a point in the
valley through the chalk wolds, a natural focus for settlement through the
ages, seemingly connecting it to the surrounding higher ground in various di
rections. Yet again, many of the Thames valley cursuses are situated on a sin
gle gravel terrace, their orientations ensuring that there were no sudden
changes in elevation along their length.
Many cursuses also seem to encapsulate a variety of symbolic relation
ships with the wider visual environment. A number appear to be linked with

streams and watercourses, while others are aligned with local hilltops. Yet
others are astronomically aligned. Standing at what was once the northeast
ern terminal of the Dorset cursus, on Bottlebush Down, prehistoric viewers
looking along the cursus to the southwest would have seen a conspicuous
long barrow, built right across the cursus where it crossed the horizon.
Around the shortest day of the year, the sun would have set directly behind
this barrow. Although this segment of the Dorset cursus is virtually impossi
ble to make out from the ground, the terminal can be identified and the bar
row on Gussage Cow Down remains conspicuous. Another solstitially
aligned cursus, the Dorchester cursus in Oxfordshire, has fared even less
well: it has been completely destroyed by a combination of quarrying and
the construction of a bypass.
It cannot be proved statistically that these solstitial alignments were de
liberate. They are not repeated at most cursuses. Even at the Dorset cursus
itself, only one segment is solstitially aligned: there were several other seg
ments, built in more than one stage. Even if it was done intentionally, we can
never know exactly why it was important to the people who built these par
ticular cursuses to align them upon the midwinter sun. Some have suggested
that there was a desire to keep them in harmony with nature, to appear to
be part of the functioning of nature in a broad sense. And yet in some other
cases a clear opportunity for a solstitial alignment seems to have been passed
over. At Cleaven Dyke in Perthshire, central Scotland, is a two kilometer
(over one mile-) long earthen bank running between two ditches, generally
considered to be a variant cursus monument. From the vicinity of its north
western terminus a prominent hill is clearly visible, and this would have lined
up approximately with the midsummer setting sun. If astronomical orienta
tion really was important, it is hard to conceive that such an obvious align
ment, with solstitial sunset coinciding with a prominent hill, would have
been shunned. The cursus was not, however, oriented in this direction but
over ten degrees differently. Some other suggested solar alignments are also
problematic. The Stonehenge cursus, for instance, is often said to be aligned
upon equinoctial sunrise and sunset, but there are a number of problems
with this, as with supposed equinoctial alignments generally.
A different type of astronomical alignment is found at Thornborough
in Yorkshire. The cursus here is associated with circular earthworks that
were later superseded by three large henge monuments. To the northeast it
was aligned upon midsummer sunrise, but to the southwest it was aligned
upon the setting of the stars of Orion’s belt. Since there are a good many
bright stars in the sky, and their rising and setting positions vary consider
ably over the centuries owing to precession, it is possible to fit stars to al
most any alignment, given the uncertainty in the archaeological dating of
most prehistoric monuments. This one would certainly not be considered
Cursus Monuments 125

significant were it not for the fact that Orion’s belt alignments are found re
peatedly in different features at the site and fit with other archaeological ev
idence suggesting that the site was a pilgrimage center where ceremonies
were held in early autumn. Orion’s belt could have been important because
its annual reappearance in the morning sky—its heliacal rising—served to
forewarn potential participants.
In sum, cursus monuments do not appear to have any common ritual
istic or symbolic purpose that is reflected in their relationships to the wider
landscape or sky. Yet we can see tantalizing indications that both might have
been important in particular cases.

Cusco Sun Pillars
The Inca elite claimed kinship to the sun, and this needed to be constantly
reinforced. Public rituals were regulated by the annual motions of the sun
along the horizon, the most important of these being the festival of Inti
Raymi, which took place at the time of the June solstice. This is still enacted
today in the form of a pageant held annually at the ruins of the fortress of
Sacsahuaman (Saqsaywaman) in the hills immediately outside the city of
Cusco (Cuzco), once the capital of the entire Inca empire.
Several chroniclers, including Bernabé Cobo, give accounts of pillars
that were erected on the horizon around Cusco in order to mark sunrise or
sunset on key dates in the year. These eye-witness accounts span the whole
of the century immediately following the European conquest and differ in
many details, not least the number of pillars and their locations. There are,
however, independent and largely consistent accounts of four pillars (“small
towers”) placed on a hill to the west of the city to mark planting times. Gar
cilaso de la Vega, the son of a Spanish captain and an Inca princess, de
scribed four sets of four pillars, each set marking one of the four solstitial di

rections. In each case, according to Garcilaso, the critical rising or setting po
sition of the sun was flanked by two smaller towers, themselves flanked by
two larger towers to guard them.
Given the importance of the sun in Inca religion, it is scarcely surpris
ing that horizon observations of the sun might have been the dominant sea
sonal markers and calendrical determinants, but some chroniclers’ accounts
also speak of a lunar calendar and distinctive ceremonials and rituals (such
as llama sacrifices) being carried out each month. How the lunar and solar
aspects of the calendar were resolved is not clear, although Garcilaso main
tains that the solstitial pillars were used for this purpose. There are also some
grounds for suggesting that pillars were used to observe lunar as well as so
lar risings and settings.
Within a generation after the conquest the pillars fell into disuse, al
though some may have survived for more than a century. No material traces
remain today, though archaeologists and archaeoastronomers have tried to
identify where some of them stood. Archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni has
identified what he feels is the likely location of a set of four pillars to the west
of Cusco, on a hill called Cerro Picchu, suggesting that they marked sunset
not on either of the solstices but on the dates of solar antizenith passage.
However, the evidence is equivocal and his conclusions are hotly disputed.

Declination
Declination is the single most useful concept in archaeoastronomy. It basi
cally means no more than “latitude” on the spinning celestial sphere, with
the axis of spin defining the north and south poles. Every star has a par
ticular declination and moves daily around a line of constant declination.
This means that if you go to a place and identify a point of interest on the
horizon—perhaps because an interesting archaeological feature points
there—then all you have to do is to determine the declination of that hori
zon point, whereupon you can deduce what will rise and set there, and fur
thermore what would have risen and set there at any epoch in the past. The
declination of a horizon point depends upon the azimuth and altitude of
the point, together with the latitude of the observer. When calculating a
declination, we need to make allowance for atmospheric refraction and, in
the case of the moon, for lunar parallax.
The declination of the north celestial pole is 90° and that of the celes
tial equator is 0°. The declination of Polaris, for example, is 89° and that of
the Pleiades is 24°. By convention, declinations south of the celestial equa
tor are negative, so that the declination of Sirius, for example, is –17°, and
that of Acrux, the brightest star in the Southern Cross, is –63°. The decli
nation of the south celestial pole is –90°.
Confusingly, the word declination is also used to mean the difference
between magnetic and true north. Equally confusingly, astronomers use the
term latitude in the context of a different coordinate system on the celestial

Delphic Oracle
The oracle at Delphi, famous throughout ancient Greece from about the
seventh century B.C.E., was (at least initially) only available for consultation
on one day in the entire year. It was also set in a remote location in the
foothills of Mount Parnassos, several days’ journey from most ancient
Greek cities. How, then, did pilgrims manage to arrive there at the appro
priate time?
There might appear to be little difficulty, because the date was clearly
specified as Apollo’s birthday, the seventh day of the month of Bysios. The
problem is that in ancient Greece, even as late as the fifth century B.C.E.,
there was no universal calendar. Instead, each urban center reckoned its own
lunar calendar independently. In theory, observations of the first appearance
of the new moon were used to determine the beginning of each month, but
these were often subject to political interference, and the same was true of
the insertion of intercalary months to keep the calendar in step with the sea
sonal year. Different cities had different sequences of months, different god
and goddess cults, and different festival dates. The month of Bysios, for ex
ample, could fall at any time from (what in our calendar is) mid-January to
mid-March. Certainly, no pilgrim relying on their own city’s civic lunar cal
endar could be sure of arriving at the oracle at the appropriate time, perhaps
within several weeks.
The key, it seems, was in observations of the stars. Their use as seasonal
indicators had been known to Greek farmers since at least the eighth century
B.C.E., as is clear from the writings of Hesiod. By the fifth century—follow
ing the development of peg-hole star calendars called parapegmata—some
cities at least were using star sightings to regulate their own civic calendars.
We also know from at least one parapegma that the relatively faint stars of
the constellation Delphinus were recognized as a dolphin from at least the
fifth century B.C.E. Finally, the cult title of the god (Apollo Delphinios) and
the name of the site suggest an association with Delphinus.
Weaving these various strands together, it is not surprising to discover
that the heliacal rise (first pre-dawn appearance) of Delphinus occurred to
130 Delphic Oracle

wards the end of December. If pilgrims used this event as the cue to com
mence the journey to the oracle, then they would have arrived in good time.
What is more, this celestial event may well (at least initially) have defined the
date when the oracle held forth. The key to this notion is Delphi’s location
within the landscape: it is situated in a natural bowl surrounded on three
sides by towering cliffs. The high eastern horizon means that from the tem
ple itself, the first appearance of Delphinus did not occur until about the end
of January. According to tradition, Apollo left Delphi for a three-month pe
riod each year, which coincides (at least approximately) with the period
when the constellation was too close to the sun and hence invisible. The con
sultation, then, would have taken place on the seventh day of the first lunar
month in which the celestial dolphin had returned.
All this is strongly suggestive that the cult activities associated with the
god Apollo Delphinios, and in particular the day when the oracle made its
pronouncements, were defined by direct reference to the annual cycles of
appearance of the constellation Delphinus. This direct connection may well
have been used by pilgrims to know when to commence their journey to the
oracle.

Diurnal Motion
Diurnal means “daily.” Each day the celestial sphere turns once about an
axis through two points known as the celestial poles. For an observer in the
northern hemisphere, the north celestial pole is up in the sky while the south
celestial pole is below the ground. The stars appear to turn around the
north celestial pole, which defines the (“true”) north direction. (In the
southern hemisphere, the south celestial pole is up in the sky and defines the
south direction.)
The diurnal motion is the most fundamental motion of the celestial
bodies. For any place on earth (apart from the poles!) it defines the north
south axis known as the meridian, and hence any other direction in relation
to this, regardless of the nature of the terrestrial landscape. Suppose, for ex
ample, that we find a group of monuments that are consistent in their ori
entation, and this has evidently been achieved over a wide area and despite
a varied topography, so that it cannot be put down to prevailing winds, the
local topography, or reference to distant landmarks. It follows that these ori
entations must be astronomical in the broadest sense, in that they can only
have been achieved in relation to the diurnal motion of the celestial bodies.

on stelae that stand like sentinels by a particular temple-pyramid. Sometimes
textual commentaries were associated with striking carved friezes and vivid

painted murals. Classic-period inscrip
tions and murals typically describe key
events in the lives of kings and gods,
but the later ones are increasingly con
cerned with warfare, conquest, and the
sacrifice of captives. Many inscriptions
contain calendrical dates, and these
helped researchers establish the nature
of the Maya calendar long before the
remaining parts of the inscriptions be
gan to be deciphered.
That these texts contained true hi
eroglyphic writing was not generally
accepted until the later part of the
twentieth century but is now beyond
dispute. As we now know, syllabic
glyphs were combined to produce pho
netic expressions of words in a lan
guage conforming to strict principles of
grammar and syntax, principles that
have passed down recognizably into
modern Maya languages such as Yu
catec, spoken in the Yucatan peninsula
of Mexico and in parts of northern
Guatemala and Belize.
Ancient Maya script was without
doubt the most highly developed writ
ing system in the whole of pre
Columbian America. Yet much of it
doubtless existed on perishable media
and has been permanently lost. Hun
dreds of “books” in the form of folded
strips of bark paper were burned to a
cinder by the Spanish priests. From the
Maya region only four of these codices
survive, but these give us tremendous
insights into learning and ritual. They are known, after the places where they
were eventually discovered, respectively as the Dresden Codex, Madrid
Codex, Paris Codex, and Grolier Codex. It is the first—the Dresden
Codex—that holds the most fascination regarding astronomy. The whole
book appears to be an astronomical (or rather astrological) almanac stuffed
full of information about different celestial bodies. A vast amount of careful

scholarship has been concerned with the detailed analysis of the contents of
the codex. Among many other things, this work suggests that the Dresden
Codex was actually a copy, probably made between the twelfth and four
teenth centuries C.E., of an original document as much as three or four hun
dred years older.
The Dresden Codex contains a number of tables that relate to particu
lar celestial bodies. One of the most famous is the Venus table, which was
first identified as such from the repeated appearance of the number sequence
236, 90, 250, and 8. These numbers seem to correspond to the canonical
lengths of the appearance and disappearance of Venus during each synodic
cycle. Another table records intervals between “danger periods” when solar
eclipses might occur. It is also clear from the Dresden Codex that the Maya
were obsessed with interlocking time cycles: they were well aware that five
Venus cycles equaled eight years and also (nearly) 99 lunations; 46 tzolkins
(260-day cycles) equaled 405 lunations, and so on. We would see these as
coincidences of nature but to the Maya they represented natural rhythms of
the cosmos.
The motivation for their interest in celestial cycles was, as we would see
it, primarily astrological. They needed to be able to predict the motions of
Venus, for example, so that they could judge the time when the omens would
be best for waging war and capturing warriors for sacrifice to the gods. In
this sense, the Dresden Codex and other books like it might have functioned
both as astronomical tables and as divinatory almanacs.

Drombeg
Drombeg is a carefully restored and well-preserved example of a south-west
Irish axial stone circle, probably built in the early part of the second mil
lennium B.C.E. Located near to the south coast of County Cork, a few kilo
meters from the village of Ros Ó gCairbre (Ross Carbery), it commands a

wide view southward down toward the sea. It is relatively large as axial
stone circles go: it is a little under ten meters in diameter and contains sev
enteen stones.
Drombeg is significant astronomically because of its axial alignment.
As viewed along the axis from outside the circle to the northeast, looking in
through the portals, the recumbent stone on the far side sits beneath a rela
tively close hill, less than a kilometer (half a mile) distant. In this hill, above
the center of the recumbent stone, is a shallow but prominent notch. The
axis and notch mark the setting position of the midwinter sun. The solstitial
alignment of Drombeg was first recorded by Boyle Somerville in 1923 and
has been much noted since. In fact, it is not exact: at around the time of the
circle’s construction the midwinter sun would have set somewhat to the left
of the notch, only reaching it about two weeks before and after. Nowadays
it is much closer. Nonetheless, even at the time of construction it would have
been close enough to impress.
Much has been written about Drombeg, including speculations about
other sunrises and sunsets that might have been observed from the circle at
different times in the seasonal year. But everywhere has a horizon, and a cir
cle of seventeen stones must of necessity form many alignments. Although it
is not unreasonable to imagine Bronze Age people tracking the annual pas

sage of the sun along the horizon, the archaeological record does not speak
clearly about this. Even the intentionality of the main solstitial alignment is
in some doubt. When Drombeg is considered in the wider context of the
group of monuments of which it is a member, it is found that—despite the
general consistency of the orientations of the axial stone circles toward the
southwest or west—not a single other example is solstitially aligned. The ob
vious conclusion is that solstitial alignment was not important to the axial
stone circle builders—even though the general design and orientation was
and that the solstitial alignment of this single example was probably fortu
itous. On the other hand, however strong the framework of beliefs and tra
ditions that governed and constrained the construction of one of these
circles, it is always possible that the builders of this particular one had a spe
cial reason for going beyond the prevailing convention and incorporating a
deliberate alignment upon sunset on the shortest day.

Easter Island
Easter Island is the most isolated island on earth. Less than twenty-five
kilometers (fifteen miles) across, it is well over 2,000 kilometers (1,300
miles) distant from the nearest habitable land in any direction. Yet when
Europeans first chanced across it (Dutchman Jacob Roggeveen arrived
there on Easter Sunday in 1722, hence the name), they found it inhabited.
In fact, Rapa Nui (which is the Polynesian name for the island) had been
colonized well over a millennium earlier, in about C.E. 400. Whether only
a single canoe or fleet of canoes ever reached this remotest corner of Poly
nesia, or whether for a period there was further contact, we shall probably
never know. What is certain is that the inhabitants of the island soon lost
contact with their forebears and spent many centuries in complete isola
tion. Both archaeologists and ecologists have been bequeathed an incredi
bly valuable case study of people interacting with their environment within
a closed system, and it is one that has some sobering lessons for the popu
lation of the planet as a whole. Certainly environmental disaster loomed
toward the end, when the population had increased dramatically and all
the forests had been destroyed.
Among the fascinations of Easter Island are the famous large statues or
moai. Several hundred of them came to stand imposingly on platforms
(ahu), mostly ringing the island and facing inland, but with a few in other
locations. Scores more lie or stand in what resembles a frozen production
line in the volcanic crater Rano Raraku, in various stages of production
from quarrying to transportation. Why would an isolated population on a
small island have put such a significant proportion of its human resources
into producing them? One possibility is that they were seen as protective
presences, but their full significance for the population of this tiny island re
mains largely a matter of speculation.
The island has long attracted astronomical attention. As far back as the
1960s, publications appeared describing ahu that were solstitially or
equinoctially aligned. But since there are over 250 ahu on the island, the
137
E
Pure Mathematical Physics



question of bias in selection arose. Were the supposedly astronomically
aligned ahu selected on the basis of a preconceived “toolkit” of targets? If
so, it is possible that they had no statistical or cultural significance whatso
ever. Attempts were made to resolve this question through systematic stud
ies of ahu and moai orientations, both by an archaeologist (the Easter Island
specialist William Mulloy) and later by an astronomer, William Liller. They
provide only marginal evidence at best of any intentional orientations upon
solstitial and equinoctial sunrise and sunset. The overriding tendency is for
ahu to be situated close to the coast and oriented parallel to it, with the moai
facing inland. Since such platforms are to be found all around the perimeter
of the island, their orientations are scattered around the compass, with some
falling inevitably within the solstitial and equinoctial ranges.
Perhaps the most noteworthy ahu from an astronomical point of view
is one of a small minority that are not situated on the coast but a good way
inland. Ahu Huri a Urenga is situated in a low saddle surrounded—unusu
ally for Easter Island—by a hilly horizon with very little sea visible. Stand
ing upon the platform is a distinctive and imposing moai. This is aligned not
only upon the rising sun at the June solstice, but upon a prominent hill sum
mit. Another hilltop marks equinoctial sunset. A number of apparently arti
ficial depressions in boulders adjacent to the platform incorporate several so
lar alignments and hence, it has been claimed, could have functioned as a

solar-ranging device. All this evidence still falls short of conclusive proof, but
it does at least raise the possibility that natural features in the landscape were
used to mark the solar rising or setting positions at different times of the
year. This is a possibility that has been raised elsewhere in Polynesia, for ex
ample in the N§ Pali region of the Hawaiian island of Kaua‘i.
One of the most significant astronomical alignments to the inhabitants
of Rapa Nui may actually have been a natural one. The village of Orongo
was placed in an extraordinary situation on a knife-edge ridge overlooking
the spectacular but treacherous crater of Rano Kau, with its marshy lake on
one side and the ocean on the other. This sacred place was the ceremonial
base for the extraordinary annual “birdman” ritual in which contestants had
to swim two kilometers (over a mile) out to a small rock, wait there for the
return of a migratory sea bird, and collect its first egg. As seen from Orongo,
the sun rose behind the summit of Poike, a prominent volcanic hill on a far
corner of the island, precisely at the winter (June) solstice. As the rising sun
moved away from this peak, the spring ceremony approached. It is hard to
believe that priests at Orongo could have failed to notice that the peak of
Poike marked the limit of the sun’s movement along the horizon, especially
given that the word poike, according to the anthropologist and Maori
scholar Sir Peter Buck (Te Rangi Hiroa), means “to be seen just above the
horizon.” However, the severe limitations of the topography make it unlikely
that this was taken into account when the village was planned. Instead, the
solstitial alignment of Poike from the crater-rim village may have been dis
covered later. We would see it as a coincidence, but it may well have been
taken by the Easter Islanders as something that confirmed and reinforced the
already evident sacredness of the place.
A remnant of Easter Island astronomy of a rather different nature may
have been bequeathed to us in the form of Rongorongo script, a system of
symbols used on Easter Island that seems to have provided a series of trig
gers for the reader rather than actual words or syllables. One fragment of
Rongorongo has been interpreted as a lunar calendar.

Eclipse Records and the Earth’s Rotation
Modern physics allows us to calculate, with extraordinary accuracy, the or
bits of the earth about the sun and the moon about the earth. This enables
scientists to predict the characteristics of solar (and lunar) eclipses for many
centuries into the future, and in particular, to determine “paths of totality.”
These are narrow tracks across the surface of the planet defining those
places where that rare and spectacular event—a total eclipse of the sun
will occur.
It is also possible to operate backwards in time and “predict” the oc
currence of total solar eclipses in the past. Unfortunately, there are innate er
rors in this process that increase the further back (or forward) one tries to
go. A significant effect is tidal friction, which has the effect of gradually
slowing the rate of rotation of the earth. To illustrate the point, suppose that
we made the assumption that the earth has rotated at the exactly same rate
for the past two millennia. In fact it has slowed down slightly, and during
that time it has actually rotated by one eighth of a turn more than we
thought. The result will be that our eclipse track “predictions” for an eclipse
occurring in the year 0 would be correct in latitude but some 45 degrees off
in longitude, since the moon’s shadow would actually have fallen further
round the earth’s surface than we expected.
It was first realized in the 1970s that this argument could be turned
around. Eclipses were recorded by the ancient Chinese, Babylonians, Greeks,
and Romans, as well as by astronomers in medieval Europe. As a result,
there exist many scores of records of total solar eclipses (and other sun
moon-earth related astronomical events) dating between about 700 B.C.E.
and C.E. 1600 with sufficient information on the timing of their occurrence
to enable us to identify them with “predicted” eclipses. By comparing,
through time, the difference in longitude between the “predictions” and the
actual observations, it is possible to construct a remarkably accurate esti
mate of the rate of deceleration of the earth’s rotation. Even so the modeling
is not straightforward, and the main progress was made in the 1980s by the
British historian of astronomy Richard Stephenson working together with
astronomer Leslie Morrison.
This type of study uses archaeology and history—in the form of ancient
eclipse records—to inform modern physics and astronomy. It has been

of learning something about people’s beliefs and practices in the past.

Ecliptic
If the earth didn’t rotate, and the atmosphere didn’t scatter the light of the
sun and obscure our view of the stars during the day, then as the earth
moved slowly on its annual cycle around the sun we would see the sun mov
ing slowly against the stars, completing a circuit around the celestial sphere
once every year. This apparent path of the sun through the stars is known
as the ecliptic.
Because the earth does rotate, the celestial sphere appears to spin
around once every day. During each twenty-four-hour period, as it moves
around with the stars, the sun progresses along the ecliptic by approximately
one degree. If it were not for the atmosphere, we would see it by day among
the stars. To many human communities it is important to know where
among the stars the sun is. The zodiac familiar to people in the modern
Western world—a band of twelve constellations through which the ecliptic
runs—has its origins in ancient Babylonia. But many different “zodiacs” are
possible, as for example among the Maya. The Lakota people of North
Dakota traditionally keep their seasonal movement around the landscape in
tune with the path of the sun through their own “zodiacal” constellations.

Egyptian Temples and Tombs
During the earliest dynasties in ancient Egypt, from about 3000 B.C.E. on
wards, royal burials increased steadily in size and complexity. However, it
is the construction of huge pyramids that for most people epitomizes an
cient Egyptian burial customs and captures the imagination.
Large stone architecture first appeared during the Third Dynasty
(twenty-seventh century B.C.E.) in the form of the 77-meter- (254 foot-)high
stepped pyramid at Saqqara, some ten kilometers (six miles) south of mod
ern Cairo. Pyramid building reached its peak (after some initial shortcom
ings) during the Fourth Dynasty (2613–2494 B.C.E.) with the construction of
the famous Pyramids of Giza. Pyramids actually formed part of complexes,
typically built on the edge of the desert plateau above the fertile river valley
where they would dominate the surrounding landscape yet remain inacces
sible to the masses: they were enclosed, together with other sacred structures,
within a high wall. The precinct interior could only be reached by means of
a covered causeway leading up from a separate temple in the valley, accessi
ble by boat.
The subsequent Fifth Dynasty is particularly characterized by the con
struction of temples dedicated to the sun god, Ra (or Re). The pharaoh’s
power depended upon sun worship, and these “sun sanctuaries” followed
the design of the mortuary complexes in having two enclosed precincts on
different levels linked by a causeway. Six of the nine pharaohs of the Fifth
Dynasty built temple complexes; the best preserved is that built by the sixth
pharaoh, Neuserre, at Abu Ghurab.
All of this happened during Old Kingdom times, up to the mid-twenty
second century B.C.E. Ancient Egyptian civilization lasted for a further two
millennia, its complex history including periods of political instability and
social upheaval as well as two further periods of relative stability: the Mid
dle Kingdom (mid-twenty-first century to mid-seventeenth century) and the
New Kingdom (mid-sixteenth century to mid-eleventh century). Monumen
tal tombs and temples proliferated in these later times, but they were gener
ally more modest and not just the preserve of the kings themselves. However,
the New Kingdom has left us some spectacular remains in the vicinity of its
Egyptian Temples and Tombs 143
Pure Mathematical Physics



sacred capital, Thebes, some five hundred kilometers (three hundred miles)
upriver to the south of Cairo, near modern Luxor. Amun (or Amon), the pa
tron god of Thebes, had become identified with the existing sun god Ra, and
the Great Temple of Amun-Ra at Karnak provided a spectacular setting at
the heart of the city for public ceremonials relating to the sun god. On the
opposite side of the river is the so-called Valley of the Kings, which contains
over sixty underground pharaohs’ tombs, including the famous (because it
was discovered intact) tomb of Tutankhamun.
The most obvious clues to astronomical associations of temples and
tombs are found in the inscriptions within them. A number of New King
dom tombs and temples, for example, contain painted “astronomical ceil
ings,” listing and depicting stars, constellations, and even planets. But why
should these be placed inside tombs? The answer is that ancient Egyptians’
understanding of the sky was framed within a worldview that bound to
gether inextricably the gods, the otherworld Duat, the afterlife, and what
was seen in the night sky. It had long been engrained in ancient Egyptian

minds that the sun god Ra traveled nightly through Duat, the world beyond
the horizon, on his journey to the eastern side where the sky goddess Nut
would give birth to him once again. Similarly, most of the stars in the sky
disappeared from view for a period of some weeks in the year, between their
heliacal set and heliacal rise; during this time they too were understood to
pass through Duat. Likewise, the deceased were required to pass through
the twelve parts of the underworld in order to join the gods in the sky. As
far back as Old Kingdom times, pharaohs’ tombs contained sets of spells
known as pyramid texts that were designed to ensure a safe passage. Cir
cumpolar stars, on the other hand, were immortal: ever present in the night
sky, they never crossed the horizon into Duat, never died, and were never
reborn. It was these stars that the human soul, striving for immortality, en
deavored to join.
These beliefs, and especially the deep importance attached to the north
direction with its imperishable stars, may well have given rise to a practice
during Old Kingdom times of aligning tombs and temples with the cardinal
directions. Pyramids from Saqqara onwards were oriented to the cardinal
points, and at the Pyramids of Giza this was achieved with remarkable pre
cision. This practice of cardinal orientation also appears to have been fol
lowed, though not necessarily with such great precision, at Old Kingdom
temples such as those at Abu Ghurab. Other celestial alignments have also
been discovered at Old Kingdom temples and tombs. The great pyramid of
Khufu, the largest of the three pyramids at Giza, contains two long shafts
connecting the King’s Chamber directly to the outside world. Thought for
many years to be mere ventilation shafts, it was discovered in the 1960s that
one was aligned upon the star Thuban in the north, the closest thing to a
pole star at the time, and the other upon Orion’s belt in the south. While it
is possible that the alignments are fortuitous, it is more likely that they had
a very real purpose relating to the journeys to the stars that the pharaoh
would need to make in the afterlife.
Various New Kingdom temples seem to have been aligned with the sun.
The central axis of the Great Temple of Amun-Ra is aligned toward winter
solstice sunrise. The main enclosure at Karnak also contains several other
temples with solstitial orientations. This is scarcely surprising, given that it
was the center of a sun cult, but the reasons that particular importance was
attached to the winter solstice are unknown. The main axis of another great
New Kingdom temple, Abu Simbel, was aligned upon sunrise on (in our cal
endar) October 18 and February 22. (This temple was moved in the 1960s
out of the way of the floodwaters created by the Aswan Dam, but the align
ment was carefully preserved.) These dates were probably significant for cal
endrical reasons, but precisely what these were is hotly disputed.
A number of enthusiasts have investigated possible astronomical align

ments at Egyptian temples and tombs over the years, going back to the pio
neering efforts of the German scholar Heinrich Nissen and the British physi
cist Sir Norman Lockyer in the late nineteenth century. Not only solar but
also stellar and even lunar alignments have been claimed, but there are in
herent dangers in all this. The mere existence of an alignment does not prove
that it was intentional, and the number of different structures in each tem
ple complex provides many putative alignments. Only recently have system
atic studies of temple and tomb orientations in ancient Egypt, sensibly inter
preted in the light of the broader knowledge that has been obtained over the
years from a range of archaeological evidence, begun to be undertaken. Pre
liminary results seem to indicate that temples in the Upper Egyptian Nile val
ley were predominantly topographically oriented, although some astronom
ical orientations were included as well, especially upon the winter solstice
sun. According to another recent idea, the builders of Old Kingdom pyra
mids perfected (over time) their orientation and proportions so as to achieve
impressive illumination effects at the summer solstice and equinoxes.

Emu in the Sky
When the Europeans arrived in Australia at the end of the eighteenth cen
tury, they found a huge diversity of Aboriginal languages and traditions,
much of which has been irretrievably lost in recent generations. Sky myths
and stories were of great importance to many Aboriginal groups. Like other
aspects of the Aboriginal cultural heritage, they varied greatly from one
group to another, but some common elements do emerge from the fragments
that have come down to us. A good example of this is the celestial emu.
The emu in the sky is a dark shape formed by dust clouds in the Milky
Way. The clouds obscure the bright light behind them, and so appear as
darker patches within the ribbon of diffuse light that encircles the sky. The
emu’s head is a particularly clear and compact black patch known to mod
ern astronomers as the Coalsack, close to the Southern Cross. From here, a
long neck runs along the Milky Way to a large body in the vicinity of Scor
pius, with the hint of legs below. All this is completely invisible in modern
light-polluted city skies where even the Milky Way itself can scarcely be seen.
In remote areas, however, on a moonless night, it can be magnificent: par
ticularly so when the emu “stands” on the horizon with its head halfway up
toward the zenith. It is a huge and directly visible shape, looming darkly and
imposingly behind the brilliant light of the foreground stars that fill the
whole sky. For a Western observer unused to truly dark skies, recognizing
the emu can come as a real shock, a moment of revelation that throws into
a different perspective the Western predilection for forming constellations by

minder that different ways of perceiving things not only exist, but can be
compelling and unforgettable once the mind comprehends them.
Earthly emus are unusual in that the male incubates the eggs and rears

had the task of training boys in preparation for their initiation into manhood.
Emu in the Sky 147

It is said that the changing appearance of the emu in the sky served to indi
cate the time (of year) when initiation ceremonies should be held. It has also
been claimed that some of the rather distorted forms of the emu appearing in
Australian rock art owe their appearance to the shape of the celestial emu.
The emu in the sky was recognized as such from one side of Australia
to the other, although by no means universally or consistently. This has led
some to propose that this particular celestial being may have a history that
goes back thousands of years.

Equinoxes
The word equinox is generally taken to refer to the days when, at every
point on the earth, day and night are of equal length. But this definition of
the equinox is a bit misleading. Since it gets light before the sun rises and
remains light after the sun sets, the actual period of darkness at the equinox
will be substantially less than twelve hours, the exact amount depending on
latitude and how one defines the boundary between twilight and night. It is
even misleading to say that the equinoxes are the days when the time be
tween sunrise and sunset is the same as that between sunset and sunrise, be
cause this definition assumes a flat horizon and the absence of atmospheric
effects, particularly refraction. In practice, one cannot determine the equi
nox by measuring the length of time between sunrise and sunset.
From an astronomical perspective, the definition of the equinoxes is
much clearer. They represent the positions in the earth’s orbit where the axis
joining the two poles leans neither toward nor away from the sun. These
points are roughly a quarter of the way around from the two solstices, al
though not exactly, because the earth’s orbit is elliptical rather than circu
lar. It is also possible to express this technical definition from the perspec
tive of an earth-based observer, using the concepts of the celestial sphere
and declination. The equinoxes are the times when the sun, in its progress
along its annual circuit through the stars known as the ecliptic, crosses the
celestial equator, in other words, when its declination is zero. This occurs
twice in each year, at the vernal, or spring, equinox, which generally falls
on March 20 or 21 in the modern (Gregorian) calendar, and the autumnal
148 Equinoxes

equinox on September 22 or 23. (Of course, spring and autumn are trans
posed in the southern hemisphere.)
This concept of the equinox, in the sense in which astronomers use the
term today, was a natural one for the astronomers of Hellenistic Greece, be
cause they were attempting to develop geometric models that fit the avail
able observational data. For example, Hipparchus in the second century
B.C.E. developed a model of the motion of the sun around the earth in which
the sun orbited in a circle at uniform speed but the earth was displaced from
the center of the circle. If we were in Hipparchus’s shoes, approaching the
problem geometrically, then we might naturally progress as follows. First,
draw a circle to represent the sun’s orbit around the earth. Then divide it into
quarter-points (the solstices and equinoxes). Then consider how these could
best be determined through observation. Then measure the time intervals be
tween them (leading to the discovery that they are not uniform). Finally, try
to find a way of modifying the model to fit the observations. The point of
this exercise is to show that, while the equinoxes do enter this particular
thought process quite naturally, this is only because we are approaching the
problem in a geometrical way. What if, in common with many other human
societies in the past, especially the prehistoric past, as well as in the indige
nous present, we were not inclined to try to understand or explain the cos
mos using geometrical models? In other words, how relevant is the concept
of the equinoxes likely to be among other human cultures in general?
To add a further complication, when people use the term equinox in a
cultural context, they commonly mean not the true equinox (as just defined)
but the halfway point between the two solstices. Unfortunately, this, like the
“night and day” definition, is problematic in practice. For a start, one might
mean the halfway point in space or the halfway point in time. The first of
these might be identified, say, by observing the rising points of the sun at the
two solstices and then marking out the day when it rises halfway between
them. The second would involve counting the number of days between the
adjacent summer and winter solstices, then counting half that number of
days. In the case of the spatial halfway point, unless one is close to the equa
tor, the sun does not rise vertically but at an angle. This means that, unless
the horizon is smooth and flat, the resulting “equinoctial sunrise” could be as
much as several degrees (and the resulting “equinox” many days) away from
the true one. The temporal halfway point is less problematic, in that it is in
dependent of place, thus making it easier for us to spot if things were consis
tently aligned upon sunrise (or sunset) on that date. The engineer Alexander
Thom did believe that this event was extensively known in prehistoric Britain
and marked by monumental alignments; for this reason the day halfway in
time between the solstices is sometimes referred to as the Thom equinox. Be
cause the earth does not orbit the sun at a constant speed, it actually occurs
Equinoxes 149
Pure Mathematical Physics



one or two days later in March, and earlier in September, than the true equi
nox, at a time when the sun’s declination is about +0.5 degrees.
When monumental alignments are found facing close to east and west,
such as the two passages at the passage tomb of Knowth in the Boyne Valley
of Ireland, it is often assumed that they are equinoctial in the “halfway be
tween the solstices” sense. It is certainly easier to argue on pragmatic grounds
that the “halfway” rather than true equinox was the one marked in prehis
toric times, in that the halfway point (whether in space or time) could have
been identified using direct observations from the place concerned. However,
this explanation leaves open the question of how this might have been
achieved in practice, and to what precision. Identifying the Thom equinox,
for example, requires an efficient system of recording or memorizing numbers
of days up to at least 180 and presupposes that the solstices can themselves
be defined to pinpoint precision—which is not self-evident, as is seen at the
Bronze Age site of Brainport Bay in Argyll, Scotland. This is quite different
from suggesting, for example, that past communities in temperate latitudes
may have divided the seasonal year into two main portions, the start of sum
mer and winter halves being recognized and celebrated at times that happen
to approximate the equinoxes. The point is whether the equinox existed as a
meaningful concept for them, and hence a meaningful concept for us in try
ing to explain, for example, monumental alignments to the east or west.
This question leads to another, fundamental question. Even if certain
human societies in the past had the technical means to accurately determine
the halfway point between the solstices, either in space or time, are they
likely to have been motivated to do so? Historical and anthropological evi
dence suggests that the answer in most cases is no. To judge from historical
and ethnographic examples, the norm is to identify dates that are significant
in a local context, such as in a ceremonial calendar related to seasonal agri
cultural activities. Ceremonial significance might also be attached, say, to the
day on which the sun rises or sets in line with a significant feature in the vis
ible landscape, such as a sacred mountain: an example of this occurs at Ca
caxtla in Mexico. The point is that space and time are generally not con
ceived in the abstract, as in the modern scientific tradition, but in relation to
physically perceived objects and events. Now, the solstices are physically dis
cernible (to whatever precision) as the days when the lengths of day and
night are at their longest or shortest. In addition, the solstitial rising and set
ting points of the sun have a concrete significance in any landscape as the
limits of the sun’s motion, and the boundaries of those parts of the horizon
where the sun can rise or set. The equinoxes, and the positions of equinoc
tial sunrise and sunset, on the other hand, have no inherent significance. Di
vision into two equal parts only tends to strike the modern investigator as an
obvious way of subdividing up the arc of horizon where the sun rises, or the
150 Equinoxes

time between the solstices, because he or she perceives space and time in an
abstract way in the first place.
The fact that the equinox has, nonetheless, acquired crucial liturgical
importance within the Christian world in connection with the timing of
Easter is attributable to the roots of that tradition in the Classical world. The
difficulties of recognizing and marking the equinox in medieval times were
considerable, and this is reflected in the process and practice of orienting
churches.
But outside this context the evidence from around the world that peo
ple in the past were directly interested in the equinox (however defined) and
intentional equinoctial alignments is rather thin. For instance, if we look im
partially at the patterns of orientation of local groups of European prehis
toric temples and tombs, rather than just picking out individual examples,
then the evidence suggests a clear interest in the motions of the sun, mani
fested in many different ways in different places and times, but no clear pref
erence for equinoctial alignments. In Mesoamerica, to take another example,
the easterly direction was itself of fundamental importance, and convincing
evidence exists for horizon calendars marking sunrise at different dates in the
year against topographic landmarks. However, there is little or no direct ev
idence of precise equinoctial alignments. Despite this, some researchers con
tinue to argue that topographic landmarks could have been used to mark off
equal divisions of the year into quarters or eighths.
When trying to interpret the orientations of ancient structures, it has
become commonplace to apply a “toolkit” of potential astronomical targets
in which sunrise and sunset on the solstices and equinoxes invariably appear
at the top of the list. One problem is that the term “equinoctial” is often
poorly defined and used all too often simply as a convenient label for east
west alignments. More seriously, it is usually considered self-evident (or else
implicitly assumed) that the equinox was a meaningful concept, whatever
the human society being investigated, and hence that sunrise or sunset on
that date was a possible target for orientations. In fact, outside the frame
work of the modern Western scientific tradition (which has its roots in the
Greek geometrical tradition), it is far from self-evident in most cases that the
equinox was of any significance at all.
The equinoxes, perhaps more than any other astronomical concept,
demonstrate the dangers of applying Western concepts too readily and un
critically in interpreting the material remains of human cultures in the past. It
is essential to deconstruct concepts that are particular to our own mindset if
we want to understand actions that arise as a result of the mindsets of others.

Ethnoastronomy
Paralleling the definition of archaeoastronomy, one can define ethnoas
tronomy as the study of beliefs and practices concerning the sky among
modern peoples, and particularly among indigenous communities, and the
uses to which people’s knowledge of the skies are put. The term ethnoas
tronomy seems to have been coined in 1973, not long after the term ar
chaeoastronomy, first appearing in the title of a review article by Elizabeth
C. Baity, “Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy So Far,” in the journal
Current Anthropology. There is no clear dividing line between archaeoas
tronomy and ethnoastronomy, and many would prefer simply to combine
the two fields under one heading, such as cultural astronomy.

Ethnocentrism
Ethnocentrism is the tendency to create a privileged view of our own (mod
ern Western) culture and hence to project our own ways of comprehending
things onto the people we are interested in. Clearly, this is something to be
avoided if we are trying to understand other ways of understanding the
world, which is the broader agenda into which archaeoastronomy fits.
In its most extreme form, ethnocentrism manifests itself as the tendency
to judge the “achievements” of a past culture as if they can be measured on
a linear scale with ourselves at the pinnacle. It is very easy to fall into this
trap quite innocently, simply by praising some intellectual achievement of a
past culture. Yet if a time machine took us to meet face to face with the peo
152 Ethnoastronomy

ple of whom we were speaking, they would surely find this practice im
mensely patronizing: from their point of view it would be we who are clearly
failing to comprehend their way of viewing the world. Very likely we would
be seen to have progressed only a short way up their scale of achievement.
A problematic issue arises. To reach what people in the modern West
ern world, at least, would consider to be the most reasonable, reliable, and
sustainable conclusions on the basis of the evidence available—for example,
whether an astronomical alignment at a monument was likely to have been
deliberate and, if so, what it meant to the people who created it—we must
be scientific in the broadest sense. This is another way of saying that we
must select the evidence fairly and consider it objectively, rather than just
taking into account the evidence that fits our favorite theory and ignoring
the rest. However, some argue that in order to avoid ethnocentrism we
must not accord “our science” a privileged place in analysis and must even
strive not to be objective. This problem is relevant in archaeology, and in
deed in many of the social sciences as a whole: it is a form of cultural rel
ativism that has caused a good deal of confusion and aggravation. The res
olution of this apparent paradox is simple. Even when we are studying
other worldviews, and the context in which they operated, we must seek
to comprehend them using our own mindset. Although we should avoid
ethnocentric interpretations, we must still be “scientific” in our broad ap
proach to interpreting the evidence.

Extinction
If you attempt to watch a star setting in the middle of the night, you may
well be in for a disappointment. Unless the western horizon is a high one,
as the star approaches it, it will gradually become dimmer and (depending
upon a number of factors including, of course, the initial brightness of the
star) may well disappear completely. Even in a location where the skies are
little affected by modern light pollution, this will still be the case. The cause
is atmospheric extinction—the absorption and dispersion of the starlight as
it passes through the earth’s atmosphere on the last leg of its long journey
to the human observer on earth. When a star appears close to the horizon,
its light has to pass through many times as much atmosphere as when it is
high in the sky. The practical effect is that surprisingly few stars—even
Extinction 153
Pure Mathematical Physics



bright ones—are actually visible at the moment of rising or setting, even in
remote places on the darkest of nights.
The effect of extinction is that a star will only be visible above a certain
altitude, known as the extinction angle. That angle will depend upon the
brightness of the star and upon atmospheric conditions. At high latitudes,
where the celestial bodies rise and set at relatively shallow angles, extinction
adds another confounding factor to any attempt to date a monument on the
basis of postulated stellar alignments.

Fajada Butte Sun Dagger
Fajada Butte is an isolated, 135 meter- (440-foot-)high column of rock at the
southern entrance of Chaco Canyon in New Mexico. In a precarious loca
tion on a narrow ledge are three stone slabs between 2 and 3 meters (7–10
feet) in height, with narrow gaps between them, which lean against the cliff.
On the cliff immediately behind the slabs are two spiral petroglyphs. For a
few days around summer solstice, the larger spiral is directly lit by sunlight
for just eighteen minutes. Shortly before noon, a spot of light appears right
at the top of the spiral, quickly grows into a vertical dagger of light passing
directly through the center, and then passes downward to disappear near the
bottom of the spiral. On days before and after the solstice the dagger ap
pears for longer and to the right of the center, the displacement being de
tectable only two or three days away from the solstice itself. The smaller spi
ral manifests a similar effect at the equinoxes. At winter solstice the two
light daggers frame the larger spiral by appearing down each side of it.
This spectacle achieved considerable fame following its discovery in
the 1970s and remains for many the best-known manifestation of ancient
astronomy in the United States. Yet fierce debates surrounded it for many
years, centering upon the question of whether the sun dagger was actually
significant to, or even noticed by, the person or people who carved the spi
ral petroglyphs. It is not contentious to suggest that this inaccessible spot
may well have had a sacred significance for ancient Puebloans. Neither is it
difficult to envisage a sun priest coming here to conduct a lonely ritual, de
riving cosmic power and making suitable offerings when the sunlight
showed that the time was right. This is not so different from practices
recorded in later, historic Pueblo times. But was it really a sun shrine? Did
the sun dagger phenomenon even exist when the spirals were first carved?
The slabs have shifted slightly since the 1970s, probably because of the dam
aging effects of the large numbers of visitors resulting from the publicity the
initial discovery received, and before the site was closed off to the public.
This shifting raises the possibility that shifting also could have occurred in

the centuries between the period when the site was in use and its discovery.
We can take nothing for granted.
Even ignoring this possibility, one much-debated question is whether
the three slabs were placed in position or had simply fallen there naturally.
Either way, placing the spirals to get the light daggers striking them in the
correct way at the correct times would have been a formidable task involv
ing long days studying the patterns of sunlight and shadows against the half
hidden rock face. In the absence of any independent evidence, how can we
judge whether this feat was actually achieved? The question must be turned
about to focus upon our own methodology. It becomes a question of how
likely we are to interpret wholly fortuitous phenomena as deliberate. Given
rock art in a restricted location, how likely are we to be able to spot totally
unintentional but nonetheless impressive light and shadow phenomena oc
curring at what we would take to be significant times?
In the decade following the initial discovery, the team who had first un
covered the sun dagger phenomenon carried out further research at the site.
As a result, they extended their hypothesis to suggest that the Fajada Butte
petroglyphs were significant in relation not only to sunlight but to the light
of the moon. At the time of moonrise, there would have been a sharp divi
sion between parts of the spirals lit up by moonlight and those still in
shadow. But the motions of the moon are more complex than that of the sun,
varying over an 18.6-year cycle known as the lunar node cycle. Lunar dag
ger configurations in relation to the spirals were duly identified, and the con

clusion was reached that the ancient Puebloans knew and recorded the
longer-term motions of the moon. This conclusion was subsequently rein
forced by studies of alignments of various buildings in Chaco Canyon, which
seemed to show significant alignments upon limiting moonrise and moonset
positions that occur only around the times of lunar standstills, and these only
occur once in every lunar node cycle. The alignment evidence proved highly
controversial, both because of selection effects in the data and the fact that
independent historical or ethnographic evidence of an interest in the lunar
standstills as a concept is lacking anywhere in pre-Columbian or indigenous
America. Ironically, what arose as an additional (lunar) elaboration of the
original (solar) light-and-shadow idea turned out for many critics to under
mine it, since it raised serious concerns about how easy it is to see signifi
cance in things that are, in fact, purely fortuitous.
The question remains: by focusing on the solstitial and equinoctial
light dagger phenomena, might we be ignoring equally impressive but dif
ferent phenomena that occur at numerous other times of day and year? If
so, then we should question whether the solstitial and equinoctial ones were
really intentional. This is an issue that has been extremely difficult to re
solve until recently, with the development of a new visualization tool,
which, at the time of writing, is on display at the Adler Planetarium in
Chicago. This is a computer reconstruction of the Chaco petroglyph in
three dimensions. It allows the user to set the time to any day in the year
and any time of day, and to watch the light and shadow effects. Using such
a tool, the user can reach an informed conclusion about whether the solsti
tial sun daggers are really so special.
The consensus that has emerged after the many debates is that the dag
gers that appear at the summer and winter solstices could well have been de
liberate, and that the site may well have been a sacred place used as a sun
shrine. This conclusion is considerably strengthened by a number of other
“solstice daggers” that have now been found at other sites in the U.S. south
west. The lunar alignments at Fajada Butte, however, are almost certainly
fortuitous, and the equinoctial ones remain open to question.

Field Survey
The goal of archaeoastronomical field surveys is to assess the astronomical
potential of a set of archaeological or material remains. Often we are inter
ested in structural alignments, asking where they point to on the horizon
and what rises or sets there, or would have risen or set there at some point
in the past. Sometimes we are interested in the interplay of sunlight and
shadow. We might be interested to know, for example, the particular times
of the year and day when sunlight suddenly streamed into the dark interior
of a prehistoric tomb such as Newgrange in Ireland, or when streaks of sun
light or shadow fell in distinctive ways across the spiral rock carvings on
Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon.
It is, of course, possible to go to an archaeological site and simply ob
serve what happens, for example, at a sunrise or sunset. Being there in this
way has the advantage that you can assess the visual impact of a phenom
enon first-hand and in context, and maybe spot alignments or light-and
shadow effects that might otherwise have been missed. For those lucky
enough to be able to revisit a place on many different occasions, special ef
fects only visible at certain times may suddenly show up. Some important
discoveries have certainly been made in this way, including the famous mid
winter sunrise alignment at Newgrange. However, there are dangers. An
obvious one is that a site and its landscape may have altered significantly
since earlier times: a monument may have been constructed and recon
structed in several stages or may have suffered damage more recently. Be
cause of this, effects that are spotted now may have appeared rather differ
ent, if they appeared at all, in the past. A more subtle danger arises because
people are inevitably drawn to a site on what they perceive as special days,
such as the solstices. If you spot an eye-catching effect on a day such as this,
it is easy to forget that equally eye-catching effects might also be present on
other days, thereby decreasing the likelihood that the solstitial effects were
actually intentional and meaningful to the original builders. Yet another
158 Field Survey

problem is that the rising and setting position of the celestial bodies may
have been different then from now. How great a problem this is depends
upon the astronomical body or phenomenon in question, the precision of
the alignment or effect, and the time span that has passed since it was (os
tensibly) set up.
For professional work, a set of methods and techniques has been es
tablished by archaeoastronomers over the years. These form an essential part
of the broader study of archaeoastronomy, just as excavation and other field
techniques form a central part of archaeology as a whole.
For assessing alignments, the standard procedure is to determine the az
imuth and altitude of the relevant point or range of points on the horizon us
ing an instrument such as a theodolite or a magnetic compass and clinome
ter, depending upon the accuracy required. From this we are able to
determine the declination, which provides an indication of what rises and
sets there, or would have risen or set there at any given era in the past. In
particular, it is not necessary to wait for a particular day such as the solstice
in order to determine where the sun would have risen and set on that day, or
on any other day in the year. Depending upon the accuracy required, it may
also be possible to determine horizon data directly from large-scale topo
graphic maps or by analyzing digital topographic data using computer soft
ware such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS). This approach is also
useful in helping to overcome practical problems such as the obscuration of
the horizon by modern buildings or trees, or even the bad weather that might
beset a survey. There is also great potential for using computer technology
to combine three-dimensional reconstructions of sites, monuments, and
landscapes with visualizations of the whole sky; this is a technique that re
mains to be fully exploited.
For light-and-shadow effects, various forms of simulation are possible,
including three-dimentional computer reconstructions. For example, at the
time of writing, a simulation of a “sun dagger” that crosses one of the spi
ral petroglyphs at Chaco Canyon, where the user can set the day of the year
and the time of day, can be viewed in the cultural astronomy gallery at the
Adler Planetarium in Chicago.
It is important to be rigorous in presenting the results of field surveys
so that others can objectively assess the evidence. A photograph of a pretty
sunset in a horizon notch behind a standing monument is generally of little
value because it is unquantitative: there can often be great flexibility in
choosing a suitable spot for taking the photograph, and one often has only
the photographer’s word as to when the picture was taken. Scaled horizon
diagrams and associated site plans are as essential to the archaeoastronomer
as carefully drawn and scaled excavation plans are to the archaeologist.
A vital, though less tangible, aspect of field procedure is selection of

data. The mere existence of an astronomical alignment does not prove that
it was intentional or meaningful in the past. This means that we must pay
attention (some would say, strict attention) to selecting data fairly. It proves
nothing to go to a site and, wittingly or unwittingly, choose the alignments
that look promising astronomically while ignoring the rest. Selection criteria
form an essential part of the methodology that underlies all archaeoastro
nomical fieldwork.

Fiskerton
The site of Fiskerton in Lincolnshire, in the fenlands of eastern England, is
one of a number of wooden trackways or causeways built during the Late
Bronze Age and Iron Age (late second and first millennium BC) across
marshes, shallow lakes or rivers at various locations in Britain and conti
nental Europe. Whether we might wish to classify them as “bridges” (con
necting dry land) or “jetties” (for example, leading out onto platforms over
open water) is not always clear from the available evidence, but what they
have in common may have to do less with this (to us) pragmatic aspect of
their function as with their strong association with votive deposits con
nected with water. Underneath and along both sides of the Fiskerton cause
way, which was supported by two rows of upright posts, were scattered lit
erally hundreds of what appear to be votive offerings, including precious
weapons such as daggers and swords as well as more mundane items of
metalwork such as hammers.
This is interesting enough in itself, but what sets Fiskerton apart is ev
idence that the causeway underwent major refurbishment at regular inter
vals. One of the advantages of ancient timber artifacts and constructions,
where they remain to be examined by the modern archaeologist, is that they
are susceptible to dendrochronology (tree-ring dating). This is a technique
that can specify the date of felling to a particular year, and even season.
Thus we know that the Fiskerton causeway was periodically maintained by
adding new posts, and that the felling dates span a period of over a century,
from 457 B.C.E. to 339 B.C.E. It appears that the felling took place predom

inantly in the winter or early spring, and that few if any timbers were sea
soned before use—in other words, they were put into use within a year. Re
markably, the causeway uprights seem to have been felled—and, by impli
cation, placed—at regular intervals of between sixteen and eighteen years.
Given the evident sacred significance of the site, an obvious possibility
is that the regular episodes of major refurbishment—likely accompanied by
due ritualistic observances—were astronomically regulated. Archaeologist
Andrew Chamberlain has examined the possibilities in detail. A prime can
didate would seem to be the Saros cycle. This represents a period after
which the sun, moon, and earth return to almost exactly the same configu
ration in space. The upshot is that, at any time, the moon’s phase and po
sition in the sky are more or less identical to what they were eighteen years
and eleven days before. In particular, if a lunar eclipse occurs once, then an
other is likely to occur eighteen years and eleven days later. Chamberlain
concluded that the major episodes of construction were indeed correlated
with total lunar eclipses—those associated with two particular Saros series
(nos. 46 and 47).
The implication here is that the people who used Fiskerton could pre
dict eclipses as opposed to merely reacting to them. Unfortunately, this ap
pealing conclusion may not be as clear-cut as it seems. For one thing, the
fact that one lunar eclipse may be prominently visible does not necessarily
mean that the next one in the given Saros series will be prominent as well;
the successor may, for example, occur below the horizon during the day
time. Second, many different Saros cycles, running concurrently, produce
eclipses from one year to the next. Third, some lunar eclipses will be missed
on cloudy nights. In the absence of any form of counting or recording, the
occurrence of total lunar eclipses observed from any given location could
not seem anything but entirely irregular. There are some short-term cycles
that, once recognized, will yield partial predictive success, but only after
very careful recording maintained systematically over several generations
(as among the ancient Babylonians) can longer-term cycles such as the Saros
become evident. And even then, the Saros is not the only cycle that might
be recognized: the ancient Chinese, for example, identified a shorter one of
10 years and 334 days, while the Maya discovered a longer one of 32 years
and 272 days. While we should not underestimate the capacity of people in
Iron Age Britain to keep records had they been so motivated, we have no
direct evidence of this.
It remains possible that some of the bursts of construction at Fisker
ton were carried out in response to lunar eclipses, and indeed there is some
evidence from other European trackway sites of correlations with various
lunar eclipses that might support this conclusion. However, in this case the
apparent regularity of the interval between the bursts of activity at Fisker
Fiskerton 161

ton would have to be fortuitous, since people would have had no way to
distinguish only those eclipses from particular Saros series. Further evidence
and statistical analysis may clarify some of these issues.
Despite all these imponderables, Fiskerton has a wider significance.
One of the most important things about the sky as a cultural resource is
that the regular cycles of the celestial bodies provide a way keeping the tim
ing of various activities in tune with nature. Yet archaeoastronomers are sel
dom faced with evidence that bears directly on this, since the time resolu
tion of most archaeological data is so imprecise. (Some have tried to use the
astronomy to do the dating, but this is dangerous because it can so easily
result in circular argument.) Even the best radiocarbon dating can seldom
tie down a particular action to much better than the nearest century, and
often the uncertainties are much greater than this. Fiskerton represents a
rare example of a prehistoric site—certainly the first in Britain—where the
timing of several successive bursts of activity can be tied down to the very
year, if not the season. This enables us to ask not only whether they were
correlated with the regular cycles of the heavens, but also whether they may
even have had some connection to actual celestial events such as particular
eclipses. This sets an important precedent for other places where we are
lucky enough to be able to recover timber artifacts and monuments.

Governor’s Palace at Uxmal
Uxmal is situated in the Puuc Hills region of northern Yucatan. One of the
largest Classic Maya cities, it reached its apex around C.E. 800, then was
suddenly abandoned, a fate shared by many other Maya centers during the
ninth century. The various buildings that form its ceremonial center are
straight-sided and consistently aligned (on a grid rotated by nine degrees
clockwise from the cardinal directions), but with a single glaring exception.
The so-called Palace of the Governor (a traditional name not necessarily re
lated to its original purpose)—one of the most splendid buildings on the
site, an elongated rectangle in shape with a beautifully decorated façade
containing seven entrances—is noticeably skewed from the common grid
(by just under twenty degrees).
The Governor’s Palace looks towards the distant (now ruined) pyramid
of Cehtzuc, a little under five kilometers (three miles) away. (There is con
siderable confusion in the early literature, since Cehtzuc was originally
misidentified as a different ruin, Nohpat.) This direction—east-southeast, or
more precisely, an azimuth of 118 degrees—corresponds to the maximum
southerly rising point of the planet Venus at around the time the temple was
built. Another possibility, argued strongly by some scholars such as the
Slovenian archaeologist Ivan \prajc, is that the Venus alignment actually op
erated in the opposite direction, from Cehtzuc toward the Governor’s Palace.
If this were a prehistoric monument that we were investigating in the
absence of historical or documentary evidence, then little credence would be
placed on such an alignment. The planetary motions are notoriously com
plex, and their extreme rising or setting points are subject to complicated
patterns of change operating on various time scales. Furthermore, the ex
tremes for all the planets are all fairly close together on the horizon and can

be difficult to distinguish, both from one another and from the sun and
moon. Why should we believe that this Venus alignment (in whichever di
rection) was deliberate? The most direct answer is the abundance of Venus
glyphs within the carved frieze on the front of the building—over three hun
dred of them. To one able to read Maya writing, the building fairly screams
“Venus.” A recent reinterpretation of the hieroglyphic throne inscription
above the central doorway has reinforced this conclusion by arguing that it
depicts Maya zodiacal constellations and includes reference to Venus.

GPS Surveys
Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers use signals from satellites to de
termine their position on the ground. Given a reasonably clear view of the
sky, a standard GPS receiver can usually locate itself in the horizontal to
within a few meters. This information is clearly useful in locating or relo
cating sites of interest, especially in remote areas, but it also has some uses
in the course of archaeoastronomical field survey. Sometimes we wish to
know the azimuth of a feature on a distant horizon, such as a mountain
peak, in order to assess its potential astronomical significance. Then again,
we might wish to know the azimuth of a reference point such as a church
spire in order to calibrate a compass and clinometer survey. Given that the
distant point is readily identifiable on a topographic map, one way to do
this is to determine its coordinate position from the map, and to determine
the coordinate position of the observing point using a GPS receiver. The az
imuth of the distant point can then be deduced.
Standard GPS receivers are not accurate enough to be used for meas
uring the azimuth between two points (that is, determining the orientation
of an alignment) unless the points in question align, in turn, with a distant
landmark whose azimuth can be determined with the aid of a map, as al
ready described. Trying to determine the azimuth of one point from another
simply by placing a GPS receiver at each of them would, given a ten meter
uncertainty in the position of either, require the two points to be something
like two kilometers (one and a half miles) apart in order to achieve half-de
gree accuracy in the result. Differential GPS receivers can be a good deal
more accurate, perhaps determining a location to within one or two meters,
but even then the two points would need to be several hundred meters (up
to half a mile) apart for this technique to be of any use.
Carrier-phase GPS receivers relate to standard GPS receivers as FM
radio does to AM radio. Although still prohibitively expensive for most
users, they have the potential to transform field survey techniques gener
ally in the near future. A carrier-phase GPS receiver has the capacity to de
termine a position to within a centimeter or two if not better. This should
dispense with the need for heavy surveying equipment such as a theodolite
in many cases, although even this sort of GPS receiver will experience dif

Grand Menhir Brisé
The landscape around Carnac on the south coast of Brittany, northwestern
France, is so full of megalithic monuments that one almost grows blasé
about them. There are huge passage tombs (also referred to as passage
graves) and other types of burial monument; great multiple alignments of
standing stones several hundreds of meters (over a thousand feet) in length;
stone circles and variants, known locally as cromlechs; and numerous indi
vidual standing stones, often themselves of considerable size (some are sev
eral meters [over 15 feet] high). Le Grand Menhir Brisé (the Great Broken
Menhir) is situated close to the modern town of Locmariaquer, adjacent to
two burial mounds of considerable size: a passage tomb known as the Table
des Marchand (Merchants’ Table), and a 160 meter- (close to five-hundred
foot-) long tumulus known by its Breton name Er Grah, much of which was
destroyed in the mid-twentieth century to make room for a visitors’ park
ing lot, but which has now been carefully restored.
The Great Menhir stands out as by far the largest single standing stone
in the area, indeed the largest standing stone in Europe; incredibly, it weighed
well over three hundred tons and measured some 20.5 meters (67 feet) from
its base to its tip. It does not stand now: at some stage it broke, the top part
falling one way and the lower part in the opposite direction. The top part split
into three on impact, so that the stone now lies in four huge pieces. The fact
that the whole menhir did not topple over in the same direction implies that
it could not have fallen while being erected, nor could it have been deliber
ately pushed over. The only viable conclusion seems to be that it was shaken
from side to side by an earthquake: in other words, it fell naturally.
The Scottish engineer Alexander Thom, famous for his interpretation
of the British megalithic sites as solar and lunar “observatories” of consid
erable precision, interpreted the menhir as a “universal” lunar foresight that
was used to track the changing rising and setting positions of the moon. The
rising point of the moon moves up and down the eastern horizon (and sim
ilarly the setting point on the western horizon) between limits that are
reached once every month. These limits themselves vary over a cycle of 18.6
166 Grand Menhir Brisé

years, so that in every nineteenth year the range of rising (and setting) posi
tions of the moon is at its widest, while nine and a half years later it is at its
narrowest. The outer and inner “limits of the limits,” where the moon rises
and sets at times that are (rather misleadingly) referred to as its major and
minor “standstills,” form eight lunar horizon targets that, if known, would
have helped people keep track of the 18.6-year cycle. All eight horizon tar
gets were, according to Thom, accurately marked by the Great Menhir. This
was achieved by carefully placing backsights some distance away in each of
the eight opposite directions, to mark places where people could stand and
observe the rising or setting of the moon in relation to the Great Menhir in
the distance.
Unfortunately, there are many problems with this interpretation. How
could the positions of the backsights have been fixed without observing pro
grams lasting many generations? How useful would the “inner” target
markers have been in practice? (The moon passes these positions twice every
month!) What happened when a critical observation was missed owing to
bad weather? Given these and many other concerns, people were quick to
ask whether Thom’s evidence could really support such an idea. One prob
lem that soon emerged was that the alleged backsights formed a motley mix
Grand Menhir Brisé 167

Pure Mathematical Physics



of prehistoric monuments, and in four out of eight cases were probably not
genuine prehistoric monuments at all. Yet the landscape in this area is strewn
with impressive monuments. Wouldn’t it be quite easy to find an equally
convincing backsight in almost any direction from the Great Menhir? The
answer, it is now generally agreed, is: very likely indeed.
The importance of this example is methodological. How could Thom
have been so selective with the evidence without realizing it? As we know
from the accounts of those who worked with him, he merely set out to iden
tify suitable backsights in each of the eight directions he considered signifi
cant. Why didn’t he at least try some other, randomly chosen, directions as
a control? The probable answer is that he was too convinced by his own the
ory—that Neolithic people observed the motions of the sun and moon to
great precision—to feel it necessary. He was not alone in this. It is natural to
want to find evidence that supports a favorite theory, especially if it is one
that has taken a lifetime to develop. Yet it is precisely for this reason that cor
rect field methodology, which ensures that one gives due consideration to all
the evidence, is so critically important.
In fact, The Grand Menhir is now known to have stood at the end of
an alignment of more than a dozen stones, varying in height. Most of the
smaller stones in the row were subsequently felled and some at least were
then reused in the construction of tombs. A split carving shows without any
trace of doubt that one former menhir—possibly one of this row—was split
asunder, with one end ending up as the capstone at the Table des Marchand
and another as the capstone at the tomb of Gavrinis several kilometers away
across a strait (it is now on an island). Not only does the very early date for
menhir construction that this implies drive a final nail in the coffin of the lu
nar foresight hypothesis (since the lunar targets shift slightly over the cen
turies owing to the changing obliquity of the ecliptic). More importantly, it
shows the potential complexity of the archaeological and chronological con
text, and the vital importance of taking this into account when formulating
astronomical theories.

“Green” Archaeoastronomy
This term denotes an approach in archaeoastronomy that is primarily con
cerned with developing rigorous procedures in studying the possible astro
nomical alignment of monumental structures. It involves developing strict
criteria for data selection and fieldwork methodology, and the formal sta
tistical analysis of the results. This approach emerged in Britain during the
1970s in the attempt to move alignment studies forward and as a response
to the huge controversy between archaeologists and astronomers caused by
the conclusions of Alexander Thom.

Gregorian Calendar
In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII introduced a dramatic calendrical reform to
overcome the problem with the existing Julian calendar: it was getting grad
ually further and further out of step with the seasonal (“Tropical”) year.
The problem would not have occurred if the mean length of the year were
exactly 365 days and 6 hours, but it is in fact somewhat shorter—365 days,
5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds. By the sixteenth century, the Julian
calendar was running ten days behind the true solar year.
The solution to the problem was two-pronged. First, the pope issued a
decree that the day following October 4, 1582, would be October 15. This
brought the calendar back in step with the seasonal year. Second, steps were
Gregorian Calendar 169
Pure Mathematical Physics



taken to prevent a significant error from accumulating in the future. A
scheme was introduced whereby in each subsequent period of four hundred
years, three years that would have been leap years under the “every fourth
year” rule now would not be. This makes the mean length of the calendrical
year 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, and 20 seconds, which is only 34 sec
onds longer than the true (Tropical) year and means that the accumulated er
ror will not reach a full day again for some 2,500 years. The specific scheme
adopted was that century years not divisible by four hundred would not now
be leap years, that is, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, etc.
Calendrical reform took place immediately in Catholic countries, but
not surprisingly, in Protestant countries the pope’s decree was ignored. The
Gregorian calendar was not adopted in Britain and its colonies until 1752,
by which time the error had increased to eleven days, and in Russia until the
Bolshevik revolution of 1917. In Ethiopia, the Julian calendar still remains
in use, and the timing of Easter for Orthodox Christians in eastern Europe
still follows the Julian calendar.
Although it bears no direct relationship to ancient calendars, the Gre
gorian calendar is related closely to the seasonal year and so provides a con
venient frame of reference when discussing the timing of seasonal activities,
astronomical observations, or the dates when the sun rose or set in line with
temples or buildings. If we are interested in whether the orientation of cer
tain temples or buildings had a calendrical significance, we do have an ad
vantage where we know something of the calendar involved. An obvious
case in point is the orientation of medieval churches, where we must be es
pecially careful to distinguish between the Gregorian calendar as our point
of reference and the Julian calendar that was being used by the builders.

Group E Structures
Uaxactún is one of scores of Maya architectural complexes located in the
Petén, a forested lowland region in northern Guatemala. From modest be
ginnings in the first millennium B.C.E. it grew to become one of the most im
portant Maya cities, the focus of a city-state that thrived for several cen
turies before finally collapsing around C.E. 900.
A rather peculiar group of structures at Uaxactún, known as Group E,
was identified as far back as the 1920s as potentially having astronomical
significance. The structures lie on opposite (western and eastern) sides of a
170 Group E Structures
Pure Mathematical Physics



plaza located on the eastern side of the ceremonial center of the city. (There
are also structures to the north and south of the plaza, but these seem to be
of secondary significance.) In around C.E. 200 an eight meter- (twenty-six
foot-) high pyramid was built on the western side of the plaza, known to ar
chaeologists as Structure E-VII-sub. Later, this pyramid was covered by a
fourteen meter- (forty-five foot-) high pyramid, Structure E-VII. Across the
plaza on the eastern side was an elongated platform running lengthwise from
north to south, upon which there were three buildings (“temples” E-I, E-II,
and E-III), evenly spaced. Viewed from the western pyramid, the three build
ings to the east are approximately in line with sunrise at the summer solstice,
equinoxes, and winter solstice, respectively. This was one of the earliest as
tronomical alignments to be recognized in Maya architecture, and the site
became renowned as a “solar observatory.”
A detailed investigation in the 1980s by archaeoastronomer Anthony
Aveni and architect Horst Hartung confirmed that the solstitial and equinoc
tial alignments were precise, provided that the observer was standing about
3.5 meters (11 feet) up the western pyramid. This, together with various
strands of archaeological evidence, led them to propose that the whole struc
ture evolved in three stages. At first, E-VII-sub was a truncated pyramid
standing only to about 3.5 meters (11 feet) high, and the eastern mound was
a simple rectangular platform. An observer standing on the western pyramid
would have been able to track the sun rising along the horizon behind—and
just about level with—the eastern platform. The length of the platform just
spanned the solar rising range. At some stage, the three “temples” were
added. These provided points of reference against which precise observa
tions of the solstices and equinoxes could now be made. When E-VII-sub
was completed to its full height, such observations could still be made by
standing at the appropriate level on the eastern staircase, but all this changed
when a new, larger pyramid was built over the top. An observer on this new
pyramid would see the eastern horizon well above the eastern temples, and
the precise alignments would no longer be functional.
A skeptic examining the Group E alignments might well ask whether
they could have arisen fortuitously. One approach to this problem would be
to look for similar structures elsewhere, to see if they systematically incor
porate similar alignments. Such an approach has been used extensively in
Europe, both to confirm suspected megalithic alignments and—as at
Drombeg stone circle in Ireland—to isolate megalithic alignments that seem
convincing in themselves but become less so when the site concerned is con
sidered as one of a group. In fact, over fifty architecturally similar structures
are now known to exist at other Maya sites, mostly concentrated in the
Petén within about a hundred kilometers (sixty miles) of Uaxactún: they are
so similar to Group E that they have become known as E-group structures.
Group E Structures 171
Pure Mathematical Physics



These are broadly characterized by an eastern platform in the shape of an
elongated rectangle supporting three equally spaced buildings in a roughly
north-south line. There are several variants, including some with three sepa
rate constructions on the eastern side. Many of these, while clearly preserv
ing the general form, are so irregular that they could not reproduce the sol
stitial and equinoctial alignments found at Uaxactún, at least in anything like
a similar way.
One’s immediate reaction might be to dismiss the Uaxactún alignments
as fortuitous. However, we have a plausible chronological development at
Uaxactún itself obtained by combining the archaeological and alignment ev
idence. This suggests another interpretation: that the other E-groups were
nonfunctional copies of the Uaxactún observatory. Just as in the later stages
at Uaxactún itself, they preserved a ritual significance that had its origin in
real observations but no longer needed to be confirmed or reinforced by re
peating those same observations. Unfortunately, as dating evidence has
slowly emerged, it no longer seems that Uaxactún Group E was a particu
larly early example of the genre. Many other E-groups were built at around
the same time—the transition between the Late Preclassic Period and Early
Classic Period around C.E. 200—and at least two seem to have been consid
erably earlier. Even more recently, other pseudo E-structures have been dis
covered that date from the Late Classic period (as late as the seventh century
C.E.) but appear to incorporate functional solstitial alignments. A more sus
tainable argument, then, is that while Maya rulers in the northern Petén over
a considerable time span desired to have one of these ritualistic complexes,
the actual solar observations mattered more to some than to others.
If solar observations were carried out at Uaxactún and some other E
groups, what then was their purpose? One possibility is that they related
at least originally—to an empirical calendar based upon direct observations
of the horizon rising position of the sun. Such a calendar existed in this re
gion, it has been suggested, before an invasion from the north in about C.E.
400 brought greater emphasis on the more abstract 260-day cycle that came
to characterize calendars throughout Mesoamerica. Recent statistical analy
sis of the alignments incorporated in the Group-E-type assemblages does
support the conclusion that many of them incorporated sunrise alignments
on dates marking calendrically significant intervals. Even so, it may be mis
leading to portray even the functional E-groups as observatories, since they
were primarily ritual complexes. It seems more likely that, where solar ob
servations actually took place, they served as much as anything to regulate
calendrically related rituals or ceremonials. One of these may well have been
the ball game—a sacred game played all over Mesoamerica and claimed by
some scholars to have been played at the equinoxes, since they symbolized
the time when the forces of nature were in balance. A great many of the E
172 Group E Structures

groups are found close to a ball court—an arena where such games were
played. In many cases, though, any association between the sun and the tim
ing of a ceremony such as the ball game did not need to be reaffirmed by
making actual observations.

Ha‘amonga-a-Maui
As ancient Polynesians voyaged across the Pacific, discovering and coloniz
ing a great variety of islands, the cultures they established developed in dif
ferent ways according to the environment and the available natural re
sources. At one end of the scale were sand and coral atolls where little but
coconuts could be made to grow; lifestyle there was frugal, and many of
these atolls were settled for only a short period before being abandoned. By
contrast, in large and fertile island groups such as Tonga, the Society Islands,
and the Hawaiian chain, populations thrived, and complex social hierar
chies and powerful chiefdoms developed. The Tongan Islands, in the heart
lands of ancient Polynesia, are unusual in that, never having been over
thrown by European invaders, the pre-contact social structure has in essence
persisted without severe cultural disruption right up to the present day.
On the largest Tongan island, Tongatapu, is found Oceania’s most fa
mous archaeoastronomical artifact: the coral trilithon known as Ha‘a
monga-a-Maui. According to tradition, its construction was ordered by
Tu‘itatui, the eleventh sacred ruler of Tonga, in around C.E. 1200. It consists
of three large coral monoliths, two standing and one placed as a lintel across
the top, and bears an uncanny resemblance to the sarsen trilithons at Stone
henge in England. Nothing quite like it is known elsewhere in Polynesia. It
is aligned along its length upon the rising position of the sun on the June sol
stice, and ceremonies to mark the occasion still take place.
Despite the superficial similarity between Ha‘amonga-a-Maui and the
Stonehenge trilithons, and the existence of solstitial alignments at both sites,
it would be plainly ridiculous to posit a direct connection between these two
sites on opposite sides of the world and separated in time by some three mil
lennia. Even so, it might seem impressive that human thought could develop
in such similar ways at such different places and times. However, there is ab
solutely no historical evidence to back up the assertion that the Tongan
alignment was significant at the time of its construction. The present tradi
tion dates no further back than 1967, when the King of Tonga, Taufa‘ahau

Tupou IV, himself an amateur astronomer, began to take an interest in the
alignment of the monument.
In fact, valuable insights about ancient Tongan astronomy may be
found by focusing less on monumental alignments and examining instead a
broader range of customs and traditions, including contemporary ones. In
Tonga, many cultural practices have been unusually well preserved, though
constantly subject to modern influences. Stories and poetry frequently refer
to topographic features in the landscape and describe the motions of objects
in the sky. Designs on bark-cloth and incised markings on war clubs often
incorporate symbols of the heavenly bodies. Dance movements can have sa
cred and cosmic significance. As all this reminds us, knowledge of celestial
phenomena formed an integral element of worldview in Tonga as well as
throughout Oceania and among human societies everywhere.

Hawaiian Calendar
The Hawaiian islands were settled, probably in around C.E. 400, by Poly
nesians who had voyaged northwards across the Pacific for some 3,000
kilometers (2,000 miles) from central Polynesia. This new island chain pro
vided a substantial land mass and a rich and fertile environment in which,
over the subsequent centuries, agriculture developed and intensified, and
the population thrived and multiplied. During the last two centuries or so
before European contact, powerful social hierarchies developed, controlled

by high chiefs (ali‘i), with lesser chiefs, priests, and other specialists, and
commoners (fishermen and farmers) being assigned to progressively lower
ranks. There may also have been a lowest social class of slaves and outcasts.
Everyday life, whatever a person’s rank in society, was pervaded by ritual
observances and taboos tied to a strict calendar. This calendar derived from
an earlier prototype, variants of which were in use all over Polynesia by the
time of European contact.
What we know of the Hawaiian calendar derives largely from three na
tive historians, David Malo, Samuel Kamakau, and Kepelino, whose ac
counts were first recorded in the mid-nineteenth century, in the decades fol
lowing the arrival of the Christian missionaries and the virtual eradication
of indigenous religious practices. While broadly consistent, the three de
scriptions of the calendar differ markedly in many details. This variation not
only indicates that there were significant differences from one island to an
other at around the time of European contact, but also suggests that the im
plementation of the calendar in practice, while following common princi
ples, operated on a local basis. In view of the broad similarities between the
recorded Hawaiian calendars and those recorded elsewhere in Polynesia, the
general principles were probably of considerable antiquity.
The Hawaiian year, termed the makahiki, was divided into twelve
months according to the phase of the moon. Most month names were used
on more than one island and followed broadly the same sequence, but their
timing in the seasonal year varied considerably from one Hawaiian island
to another. The month Iki-iki, for example, was said to have occurred in
March on O‘ahu, in May on the big island of Hawai‘i, in July on Kaua‘i,
and in August on Moloka‘i. The main division of the year was always into
equal summer and winter halves, but the two seasons were recorded as con
taining different sets of six months on different islands. All this might be
taken as evidence that no additional (intercalary) month was ever inserted
to keep the month sequence in step with the seasons, so that the sequence
of months moved around in the solar year. Indeed, there is no record of an
intercalary month being inserted, or of what procedure was followed in or
der to know when to do so. On the other hand, if there were no intercala
tion, then the timing of events that were fixed in the seasonal year (such as
the beginning of summer) would progress on average by one month in every
second or third year, and there is no evidence of this happening either.
The Hawaiians did make use of observations of astronomical events
fixed in the solar year. Piecing together fragments of the available accounts,
it appears that the beginning of the summer and winter halves of the year
were marked by two major annual events involving the Pleiades. The be
ginning of winter, in about November, was marked by the appearance of the
Pleiades in the eastern sky just after sunset as opposed to rising later in the
Hawaiian Calendar 177

night (loosely, their acronical rise). The beginning of summer, in about May,
was marked by the first appearance of the Pleiades in the eastern sky before
dawn, after not having been visible at all for several weeks (their heliacal
rise). The Hawaiian term for the new year is the same as that for the year
itself, makahiki, and this appears to be a contraction of makali‘i-hiki, which
means the rising of the Pleiades.
Each month consisted (nominally) of thirty nights—Hawaiians
counted the nights rather than the days—whose names, like those of the
months themselves, differed somewhat from island to island or place to
place. According to Malo, the day when the new crescent moon was first
sighted was known as Hilo, meaning “twisted,” because slender and
twisted was how the moon appeared, and he goes on to name the other
twenty-nine nights. There is no explicit reference to the last night, Muku,
being skipped in approximately every second month, but this must have
happened in order to keep the months correlated with the lunar phases.
Nonetheless, it is quite clear that a rich set of prognostications was attached
to the various nights of the month. For example, according to Kepelino, po
tatoes, bananas, and gourds planted on the day following Hilo will thrive,
while those planted on Ku-kolu, the fifth night, will “just shoot up like co
conuts” and be useless. Many native Hawaiians today still keep track of the
phase of the moon and will only carry out certain activities, such as plant
ing crops, on the correct day or days in the month. People’s personalities
were also seen as related to the night of the month on which they were
born. Before the arrival of the Europeans, each month contained four tapu
(taboo) periods dedicated to the worship of particular gods, when appro
priate ritual observances took place. Each was imposed at sunset and lifted
at dawn two or three days later.
The term makahiki not only referred to the new year and the year as
a whole, but also to a period starting at new year and lasting, by most ac
counts, for some three or four months. It was a sort of prolonged harvest
festival, during which normal labors were suspended, as was the regular
monthly cycle of ritual observances and taboos associated with them. In
stead, a number of rites took place that were connected with the god
Lono—who was particularly associated with (dryland) agriculture, fertility,
and medicine—as well as with other gods in the Hawaiian pantheon. When
Captain Cook first arrived on the Big Island of Hawai‘i, he was received
and revered as Lono himself, but when he was forced to return just eight
days after his departure, in order to repair a mast, he was killed. The deifi
cation of Captain Cook almost certainly owed a great deal to the timing of
his appearance in relation to the calendar, which may also have had a bear
ing on his subsequent demise. The first arrival occurred, by good chance,
during the makahiki festival when the mythical return of Lono was annu

ally re-enacted. The second happened inopportunely, after the makahiki pe
riod had finished. At this time Lono was meant to have departed, having
fulfilled his annual task of regenerating nature, leaving the ali‘i to rule in the
normal way until the following year. His unexpected return constituted a
threat to the perceived order of things and he met a ritualistic death. But
this interpretation remains fiercely debated. The opposite view is that Cook
was primarily revered as a visiting chief and met his end in a skirmish that
had a very down-to-earth explanation—it resulted from his attempts to
take an ali‘i hostage in return for a stolen boat.
A wider issue of considerable significance here is how outsiders should
best try to comprehend, and hence to respect, indigenous traditions. Is it not
demeaning to native Hawaiians, as the Sri Lankan anthropologist
Gananath Obeyesekere has argued, to assume that they were incapable of
recognizing a real threat and dealing with this threat in a “common-sense”
manner by attacking the perpetrator? Or is it more demeaning, as the
American anthropologist Marshall Sahlins has argued, to fail to recognize
and respect the worldview within which Hawaiian religious beliefs and cal
endrical rituals operated, rather than trying to rate it against our own ra
tionality?

Heliacal Rise
As the celestial sphere rotates, every star moves constantly around the line
of a particular “latitude” or declination. This means that from any place on
earth, every star that is not circumpolar will rise and set in the same posi
tions, day in and day out, year in and year out (although this is not the case
on longer time scales). However, since the (diurnal) rotation period is
slightly less than a day—approximately four minutes shorter—this means
than the time of rising or setting will not remain the same but will be ap
proximately four minutes earlier each day.
For any given place and any given star (apart from circumpolar ones),
there will be a time of year, typically lasting a few weeks, when that star is
not visible in the night sky at all, because it is rising at approximately the
same time as the sun and setting at about the same time as the sun. In other
words, it is up in the sky during the day, when it cannot be seen, and below
the horizon at night. Gradually, however, the rising time will progress earlier
and earlier each day until there comes a day when the star can be seen briefly
in the morning sky before the sky brightens too much prior to sunrise. This
is known as the heliacal rise. After this, the star will rise progressively ear
lier, getting ever higher in the sky before it is lost in the pre-dawn twilight.
Eventually, the star will reach a point, typically five months or so after the
date of heliacal rise, where it crosses the sky from east to west during the
night and can just be seen to set before the sky brightens. This first visible
setting is often referred to as the acronical set, although the term strictly ap
plies when the star sets at sunrise, an event that will already have passed un
noticed some days earlier. At around the same date, the star’s rising time will
have moved back through the night and be approaching the previous sunset.
The last time the star can be seen to rise before this occurrence becomes lost
in the evening twilight is often referred to (again loosely) as the acronical
rise. During the ensuing months the star will be rising in daylight but setting
ever earlier during the night. Finally, the day will come when it can only be
seen briefly in the evening sky after sunset before itself setting, after which it
will once again become invisible. This is known as the heliacal set.
This general series of events—disappearance, heliacal rise, acronical
rise/set, heliacal set, and then disappearance again—holds for all stars
apart from circumpolar ones, which never rise or set. On the other hand,
details such as the length of disappearance, and whether acronical rise oc
curs before or after acronical set, will depend upon the brightness of the
star, the latitude of the place, the declination of the star, and even atmos
pheric conditions (since these can affect the visibility of a star in the
evening or morning twilight). Nonetheless, for any particular star and
place of observation, the approximate dates of the various events can be
reliably specified.

The terms heliacal rise and heliacal set are also applied to planets and
have the same meaning of “first appearance in the pre-dawn sky” and “last
appearance in the evening sky,” respectively. However, the apparent motions
of the planets are more complex than those of the stars, and those of infe
rior and superior planets are fundamentally different from each other.

Hesiod (Eighth Century B.C.E.)
Ancient Greece is well known as the place where the modern science of as
tronomy has its roots. This resulted from the blending together, in the Hel
lenistic era that followed the conquests of Alexander the Great in the latter
part of the fourth century B.C.E., of two earlier traditions: a Babylonian tra
dition of careful empirical observation and a Greek tradition of cosmolog
ical and philosophical theorizing about the cause of observed phenomena.
It is easy to forget that the classical world not only contained famous
philosophers and astronomers—Plato, Aristotle, Aristarchus, Apollonius,
and Hipparchus—but also contained common people, such as farmers, who
made use of observations of the sun, moon, and stars in going about their
everyday activities, as they had done for many generations.
Hesiod was a farmer who lived in central Greece in the eighth century
B.C.E. He was also a poet, and his epic Works and Days was written to be
chanted or sung. It was passed on for many generations and eventually writ
ten down three centuries later, whence it has come down to us. Thanks to
Hesiod we know something of the ways in which his contemporaries regu
Hesiod 181
Pure Mathematical Physics



lated their activities through the seasons by watching the skies, thereby help
ing to overcome the vicissitudes of the climate. Works and Days contains a
series of tips about signs to watch for and what to do in response to them
a sort of farmer’s almanac that could be easily memorized and recited. Tips
such as those contained in Hesiod’s poem had doubtless been carefully ac
cumulated and passed down over many generations.
The Works part of Works and Days refers to many seasonal astro
nomical indicators that make good sense from a modern perspective. For
example:
At the time when the Pleiades, the daughters of Atlas, are rising, begin your harvest, and plow again when they are setting. The Pleiades are hidden for forty nights and forty days, and then, as the turn of the year reaches that point they show again, at the time you first sharpen your iron.
(Works and Days 383–387.)
Descriptions such as this one of the changing appearance of the
Pleiades refer to observable events in the skies that are tied to the seasons,
and give good practical advice. So useful are these types of observation—and
in particular observations of the heliacal rise (first pre-dawn appearance) of
stars and asterisms—as seasonal indicators, that similar practices have
evolved, and persisted, as an aid to subsistence all over the world, from pre
historic times right up to the present day.
The Days part, in contrast to the Works, contains prognostications as
sociated with the phase of the moon that, from a modern scientific perspec
tive, represent no more than irrational superstition. However, it is important
to realize that, to the farmers of the time, there was no fundamental distinc
tion between the two parts: they would have viewed them on equal terms.
This illustrates an important general principle. In attempting to interpret an
cient practices relating to astronomy, we can rarely separate what, from a
modern perspective, might appear to be “rational” behavior with pragmatic
outcomes from “irrational” actions that are only explicable if one knows
something about the prevalent systems of beliefs.

Hopewell Mounds
The custom of mound building was widespread in eastern North America
prior to European contact, and it was long-enduring. Earthen burial
mounds were built as far back as the fourth millennium B.C.E. The tradition
spread and developed until reaching a culmination that lasted from the late
second millennium B.C.E. until well into the mid-second millennium C.E. It
was characterized by the construction of huge earthworks typically several
hundred meters (more than a thousand feet) across—comparable in size to
the largest British henges, such as Avebury. These earthworks are found
down the Mississippi valley from Wisconsin to Louisiana, as well as east
wards into Ohio in the north and Alabama in the south. A distinctive phe
nomenon within the mound-building tradition, particularly from the late
first millennium C.E. onwards, was the construction of effigy mounds
earthworks in the form of birds, animals, (occasionally) people, and more
abstract designs. Serpent Mound in southern Ohio is one of the best-known
examples of these.
The number of mounds built by ancient native North Americans is
staggering: over fifteen thousand examples have been documented within the
state of Wisconsin alone. Sadly, many have been obliterated and others only
survive as almost imperceptible bumps in ploughed fields. Still others have
met more distinctive fates—such as the enclosure in the shape of a conjoined
circle and octagon at Newark in Ohio, which has been landscaped into a golf
course. The largest were on a grand scale, and in just a few cases one can still
gain a sense of how impressive they must originally have been.
The peoples who adopted the practice of mound building were many
and various, each doubtless turning the practice to their own purposes.
These peoples occupied a variety of woodland and valley environments and,
over the centuries, developed new modes of subsistence. One of the clearest
transitions was the adoption of maize as a staple food in the late first mil
lennium C.E. Archaeologists identify a number of distinctive cultural assem
blages: Poverty Point, named after the earliest known large ceremonial earth
work in the lower Mississippi valley, dating to around 1200 B.C.E.; Adena,
in the Ohio valley in the mid-first millennium B.C.E.; Hopewell, which flour
ished later in the same area; and Mississippian, in the first part of the second
millennium C.E., its most famous site being the great center of Cahokia, sited
close to modern St. Louis.
The Hopewell assemblage is characterized by enormous enclosures in
the shape of circles, squares, and other clear-cut geometrical shapes, gener
ally thought to have been built between about 200 B.C.E. and C.E. 400. These
are often found in association and even connected together, as at Newark.
From an engineering perspective they are awe-inspiring, which has led to
much speculation about other aspects of their construction, such as the use
Hopewell Mounds 183
Pure Mathematical Physics



of precise measurement units and the incorporation of astronomical align
ments. The latter include a number of solstitial alignments: for example,
along the diagonal axis of several square earthworks, such as Hopeton, An
derson, Dunlap, Hopewell, and Mound City. Even the Serpent Mound—be
longing to the later effigy mound tradition—has its head pointing at least
roughly toward midsummer sunset. Various alignments upon potentially sig
nificant horizon rising and setting positions of the moon have also been
claimed. The best known of these is the axis of the circle-octagon at Newark,
which is aligned upon the most northerly rising position of the moon.
One thing is certain: these sites were not astronomical observatories.
They served a variety of purposes. The geometrical earthworks demarcate
large spaces, and it is generally assumed that they functioned, among other
things, as ceremonial centers. One suggestion is that rituals related to bury
ing the dead changed over time into grander ceremonials aimed at ensuring
the continuance of world order and seasonal renewal. This explanation cer
tainly fits the archaeological evidence of burial mounds gradually becoming
transformed into large ceremonial earthworks. If so, it reflects a modifica
tion in the way people expressed and acted upon their beliefs relating to
death, ancestors, and regeneration.
If these great earthworks were focuses for ceremonial activity preserv
ing the world order, then they would surely reflect that perceived world or
der in their overall design. But how do we go about trying to understand this
in any detail? One possibility is to examine modern indigenous worldviews
in the region, on the basis that some aspects of early indigenous American
cosmological beliefs may have survived through to modern times. For ex
ample, in the case of Wisconsin effigy mounds it has been suggested, by com
parison with modern indigenous beliefs there, that the bird-shaped mounds
were representations of powerful spirits inhabiting the upperworld, while
land and water animals represented spirits of the lowerworld. Clusters of ef
figy mounds, then, both reflected—and preserved—the balance between the
two realms of nature, earth and sky. (Other modern groups conceive of three
realms—sky, earth, and a watery underworld—but the same general princi
ples apply.)
Hopewell mounds are more distant in time from the indigenous pres
ent. Yet, just as modern traditional houses of many native North American
groups reflect the fundamental perceived division of the (horizontal) world
into four quarters, demarcated either by the cardinal or solstitial directions,
so many of the Hopewell earthworks have a fourfold symmetry and are car
dinally or solstitially aligned. More speculatively, it has been suggested that
circles and squares (or octagons) might themselves represent the earth and
sky. When conjoined, as at Newark, they would have represented the whole
universe in microcosm, defining spaces in which ceremonies or other activi
184 Hopewell Mounds
Pure Mathematical Physics



ties could be performed that were suited to each realm, dedicated to keeping
each in its natural balance with the other.
However close to the truth such speculations might be, it is clear that
any astronomical alignments that were intentionally built into the Hopewell
mounds formed part of a much wider set of symbolic associations that
helped to affirm the perceived order of things. Solstitial alignments, if de
liberate, were not very precise. But if their purpose was merely to demar
cate the four divisions of the cosmos, they did not need to be. The horizon
rising and setting positions of the moon, on the other hand, have no place
in modern native American thought, which is one reason why many ar
chaeoastronomers remain unconvinced that such alignments were inten
tional. The other is that the alignments do not seem to occur in any consis
tent way.

Hopi Calendar and Worldview
The Hopi people of Arizona remained almost undisturbed by European in
fluences until about 1870. A number of traditional Hopi villages were situ
ated on the very edges of mesa tops overlooking the surrounding barren
plains, and Walpi, located particularly precariously on the top of a narrow
mesa with precipitous cliffs on three sides, has remained relatively unspoiled.
The inhabitants of Walpi are known to have observed an elaborate ceremo
nial calendar. The entire year was punctuated with ceremonies whose purpose
was to “assure vital equilibrium, both social and individual, and conciliate the
supernatural powers in order to obtain rain, good harvests, good health, and
peace” (Ortiz 1979, p. 564). Some were carried out in public and some in pri
vate. Some were of considerable duration: a celebration lasting nine days oc
curred at the time of winter solstice. The calendar was regulated by carefully
tracking the horizon rising position of the sun against various distant land
marks from different observing positions in and around the village.
The Hopi calendar, as practiced at Walpi and other traditional villages,
provides a fine example of a seasonal calendar regulated by horizon sun ob
servations. First recorded by the ethnographer Alexander Stephen in the
1890s, it has attracted a good deal of attention because it achieved an accu
racy that many commentators found remarkable, generally keeping within
two or three days of the “true” solar year. As a result, it has sometimes been
portrayed as a classic example of the use of horizon sun observations to reg
ulate crop planting and other subsistence activities, and so it is. Yet this only
represents one aspect of the whole picture. The elaborate ceremonials (“rit
ual performances”) that accompanied the various seasonal subsistence tasks
were a vital part of an annual round of activities that—although we might
try to break them up into those that were more “sacred” and those that were
more “secular” or pragmatic in character—represented to the Hopi an inte
grated way of harmonizing human actions with cycles of events in the natu
ral world. The calendar and all its associated ceremonies, in other words,
had a key role in reaffirming the natural (cosmic) order.
This cosmic order also had spatial characteristics. These are reflected in
186 Hopi Calendar and Worldview

the way people perceived the horizon and the whole landscape around them,
and attributed meaning to different places. Working with the Hopi in the
1970s, historian Stephen McCluskey found out that the points on the hori
zon behind which the sun rises and sets at the solstices are themselves sacred
places. Some of them are visited at the appropriate times of the year, when
decorated prayer sticks and other offerings to the sun are placed on shrines.
The place of midwinter sunrise in the southeast is the house of the sun, out
of which the sun is said to come eating from a red stone bowl. The place of
midsummer sunset in the northwest is the house of Huzruing wuhti, “hard
being woman,” who is associated with hard substances such as shells, corals,
and turquoise. The sun stands directly above her house before descending
into it through a hatchway in the roof (Ruggles 1993, 40).
Observations of the sun rising and setting at the solstices themselves are
actually superfluous to the ceremonial calendar, since the sun’s day-to-day
movement at these times is minuscule and there are no suitable foresights
that would aid precision. The solstitial directions are important for a differ
ent reason: they mark the four principal directions that are sacred in the
Hopi worldview, fundamental axes that divide the world into four parts cen
tered upon a particular village. These directions are not conceived as geomet
rical abstractions but as empirical realities with a variety of symbolic associ
ations. They result in a conceptual quartering of the world, or quadripartite
cosmology, a type of worldview that is found, in different variants, among
other indigenous American groups such as the Navajo and Pawnee.
Each of the mesa-top villages, then, had an associated “sacred geogra
phy” in which particular places in the landscape had specific meanings,
many were sacred, and the village itself stood at the center of things. This
view of the world was derived through experience and constantly reinforced
in myth and practice. It contrasts absolutely with the Western view of land
as a resource to be exploited.
The Hopi calendar did (and does) not simply regulate crop-planting ac
tivities but constantly reaffirms the structure and correct functioning of the
Hopi cosmos.

Since the emergence of archaeoastronomy in the 1970s, there have been
numerous studies of the orientations of temple-pyramids and other con
structions in the central Mexican highlands and throughout Mesoamerica.
Particular attention has been paid to the Valley of Mexico, in which peo
ples had dwelt for millennia before the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, was
eventually founded at what is now the center of Mexico City. Numerous
instances have been identified of orientation upon sunrise at the solstices
and on the day of solar zenith passage, as well as on other calendrically
significant dates.
It has also been proposed that horizon calendars were developed by di
rect observation of the movement of sunrise on successive days along moun
tainous horizons full of natural foresights and reference points. Some re
searchers have argued that surprisingly many sunrise alignments correspond
to dates separated from the solstices by intervals of 20, 52, 65, or 73 days
numbers that are also encapsulated in the intermeshing cycles of the
Mesoamerican Calendar Round. Among the independent strands of evi
dence in support of this idea is the fact that the first appearance of the noon
day sun in the Xochicalco zenith tube occurs exactly fifty-two days before
the June solstice, and the final appearance fifty-two days after. These suc
cessive fifty-two-day intervals are particularly intriguing because the interval
between them (at Xochicalco, the length of the period of darkness before the
sun starts to appear at noon again) is more or less 260 days, the length of
the calendrical cycle known as the tonalpohualli.
A more controversial suggestion is that horizon calendars were tied to
concepts of space, with intervals in time corresponding to horizon sunrise
positions separated by multiples of an angular unit of around 4.5 degrees.
However it is more likely that the true significance of dates encapsulated in
intentional sunrise alignments had to do with a much richer set of perceived
connections—between temples, the perceived dwelling places of the gods,
the correct place and timing of tributes to ensure seasonal renewal, and so
on. In other words, the horizon calendars only made sense in the context of
complex schemes of sacred geography.
One idea is that horizon calendars might have been developed in the Val
ley of Mexico at a very early date and may have helped stimulate the devel
opment of the Mesoamerican Calendar Round that is well known from his
188 Horizon Calendars of Central Mexico

torical and documentary evidence. One of the main proponents of this idea is
the Austrian-born anthropologist Johanna Broda, who argues that an early
horizon calendar existed at Cuicuilco, a large Preclassic temple-pyramid dat
ing from the first millennium B.C.E. whose ruins are now lost within the sub
urbs of Mexico City. This temple, argues Broda, was built on an observation
point where some of the natural features of the eastern horizon happened to
mark—and others came to define—significant calendrical dates.
There are three strands to the argument. First, the main peaks on the
eastern horizon correlate particularly well with sunrise on calendar dates
that were significant in the later Mesoamerican calendar and some of
which continue to be significant to the present day. Second, there are co
incidences between these sunrise dates and the dates of the calendrical rit
uals performed at shrines erected on the slopes of some of the relevant
mountains. And finally, the visual lines that connect Cuicuilco with the
mountain peaks on the eastern horizon pass through a number of histori
cally significant settlements, sacred mountains, and shrines, implying a
network of sacred lines in the landscape that remained significant, and
continued to be respected, over a long period. Broda’s scheme has since
been reassessed and modified by the Slovenian archaeoastronomer Ivan
\prajc, but he has confirmed the idea that calendrically significant inter
vals were marked at Cuicuilco.
This type of investigation raises a number of methodological questions
that are more familiar from “green” archaeoastronomy and reassessments
of British ley lines. Yet it rests on much firmer ground because of the abun
dance of historical evidence concerning sacred geography in ancient
Mesoamerica.

How the Sky Has Changed over the Centuries
The actual positions of the distant stars in space relative to one another
have only changed by minuscule amounts over many millennia. This means
that the distinctive patterns of the constellations visible in today’s skies
around the world have not changed significantly since early prehistory. On
the other hand, the rising and setting positions of particular stars as viewed
from a given spot, although constant day after day and year after year, do
change significantly on a time scale of centuries. On this time scale, the
whole mantle of stars shifts on the celestial sphere owing to a phenomenon
called precession (short for the precession of the equinoxes). This shift has
important methodological implications whenever we try to interpret appar
ent alignments upon stellar targets at ancient structures whose date can
only be determined archaeologically to within a span of a few centuries.
The rising and setting positions of the sun, moon, and planets are not
affected by precession but do nonetheless change by a smaller amount ow
ing to a distinct phenomenon known as the change in the obliquity of the
ecliptic. For example, in an equatorial location, the difference between the
horizon position where the sun rises or sets at one of the solstices now and
the corresponding position in 2000 B.C.E. is about the same as sun’s own di
ameter. (In temperate zones the difference is slightly greater, because the sun
rises or sets at a shallower angle rather than almost vertically.)
Some astronomers have argued that the appearance of spectacular
comets and meteors occurred much more frequently at certain epochs in the
past, for example during the Bronze Age. Since this would also have resulted
in an increased probability of meteoritic impacts, the idea is usually dis
cussed in the context of catastrophism, the idea that major natural catastro
phes could have affected humanity in the past.

Inferior Planets, Motions of
The planets Venus and Mercury revolve around the sun on orbits inside
that of the earth. And because they are on closer orbits, they move faster.
Suppose for a moment that the earth simply vanished, leaving a sentient
space monster orbiting the sun in its place, its head upward to the north.
For want of anything better to do, the monster decides to ignore everything
else in the sky but the sun and Venus, keeping its face toward the sun and
watching Venus gradually progressing around it. At intervals it sees Venus
at its closest approach come rattling past between it and the sun, then pull
rapidly away to the right. The time when Venus passes the sun (only rarely
will it pass directly in front of it) is known as inferior conjunction. As
Venus continues to arc round the sun, its rightward motion decreases, but
it continues to get farther away (and hence it also gets fainter). At some
point, well before it has gained on the earth-monster by a quarter of an or
bit, it will be at its furthest angle rightward from the sun, known techni
cally as the point of greatest elongation. Thereafter Venus appears to move
leftward toward the sun again, but ever more slowly, as it heads round to
the far side of the sun from the earth-monster. Eventually, it passes behind
the sun, an event known as superior conjunction, and then gradually
emerges to the left. The sequence is now repeated in reverse and in mirror
image, the planet increasing in proximity and brightness, gradually at first,
then reaching its greatest elongation to the left of the sun, and finally mov
ing rapidly once again toward inferior conjunction.
The sequence of events for an earth-based observer reflects those just
described, except that we view them from the surface of a spinning planet.
An observer in the northern hemisphere perceives the celestial sphere to be
turning to the right. If Venus is to the right of the sun, it rises earlier, passes
across the sky to the right (west) of the sun, and sets earlier. The directions
are reversed for an observer in the southern hemisphere, whose perceptions
can be modeled by turning the space monster upside down.
Just a few days after inferior conjunction, then, Venus suddenly ap

pears in the eastern sky before sunrise. This event as known as the heliacal
rise—a similar concept to the heliacal rise of stars. The planet is already
bright, and in a few more days it dominates the dawn sky, easily the bright
est object apart from the sun and moon. As it draws rapidly away westward
from the sun, it rises earlier and climbs higher in the sky by sunrise, until at
greatest (western) elongation it can be visible in the pre-dawn sky for as much
as three hours. This occurs about seventy-one days after inferior conjunction.
Subsequently, it draws closer to the sun once again but much more gradually,
steadily losing brightness as its distance from the earth increases. After a fur
ther 180 days or so, it disappears from the pre-dawn sky. This time—around
superior conjunction—it remains hidden for much longer, around fifty days
on average. The cycle is then repeated, in reverse, in the evening sky. Toward
the end of this period it dominates the western sky after sunset. Then it rap
idly disappears from the evening sky (this is known as the heliacal set). This
is followed by inferior conjunction, and the cycle is repeated.
It may seem strange at first that Venus can only ever be seen during a
short period around dawn or dusk. It never appears in the middle of the
night, which would imply that it was opposite to the sun in the sky—that the
earth was between the sun and Venus. However, since Venus is on a closer
orbit to the sun, the earth can never be between Venus and the sun.
The period between successive occurrences of the same configuration
(the synodic period) of Venus is 584 days, the average periods of visibility
and invisibility being 263, 50, 263 and 8 days. It is an accident of nature that
five Venus synodic cycles equate to almost exactly eight years, the difference
being less than three days. This means that whatever Venus’s appearance on
a particular date, it will be almost exactly the same eight years (minus two
days) later. It also means that the motions of Venus (over eight years) can be
correlated with the seasons. Both of these facts had a particular significance
in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.
Mercury is much closer to the sun and orbits it in a much shorter time,
but its apparent motions follow a similar pattern. Its synodic period is just
116 days, the average periods of visibility and invisibility being 38, 35, 38
and 5 days (with quite wide variations).

Inuit Cosmology
The Inuit peoples, who live (mainly) in the extreme north of Canada, oc
cupy one of the most hostile and challenging environments in the world.
Their communities, scattered over eight thousand kilometers (five thousand
miles) from the eastern tip of Siberia eastward to the west coast of Green
land, seem to an outsider to represent outposts in a vast, icy wilderness. Yet
to the Inuit themselves the Arctic tundra is a homeland—the central part of
which now forms the Canadian territory of Nunavut—that for countless
generations has provided a variety of resources deriving from both land and
sea animals and is navigable by kayak and dog-drawn sled.
The survival of human communities in such an inhospitable environ
ment seems, to most outsiders, nothing short of miraculous. How survival
was achieved varied from place to place, according to the resources avail
able. Thus for the central Inuit, living around Hudson Bay, subsistence
needs had to be satisfied in very different ways during the two seasons of
the year. Winters were traditionally spent in fixed coastal settlements, with
sea mammals the main source of food and other essentials. Summers were
traditionally spent in temporary camps while hunters followed the caribou
herds and other land animals. This basic dichotomy is reflected in central
Inuit people’s conception of the structure of the world. So, too, are gender
qualities. For example, women are regarded as belonging more to the sea,
sea mammals, and the winter season, while men belong more to the land,
land animals, and summer. Such principles determine the materials of
which, say, hunting (male) and sewing (female) tools are made; they can
also influence the orientations of male and female burials. Similar principles
also extend to a number of perceived Other Worlds: the Land of the Moon
Spirit, Birdland, and Belowsea Land. Belowsea Land, for example, is ruled
by Sea Woman, while the night sky is a reflection of terra firma, where the
male moon spirit drives his sled across smooth ice (clear sky) or through
trickier snow fields (clouds).
As for numerous other indigenous peoples, sky myth and symbolism
formed an integral part of Inuit understanding of the workings of the cos
mos—knowledge that ensured well-being and, ultimately, survival. What
makes the Inuit case particularly interesting is that they are one of the very
few sets of human communities living at very high latitudes (the only others
are in northern Scandinavia and parts of Siberia). Here, the appearance and
behavior of the celestial bodies is distinctive in several ways. Many Inuit
communities lie within the Arctic Circle, which means that there is a period
around the summer solstice when the sun never sets, and around the winter
solstice when it never rises. During the hours (and—around the winter sol
stice each year for those living north of the Arctic circle—the weeks) of dark
ness, whenever the skies are clear, the stars are seen to pass around the sky
Inuit Cosmology 193

in circles only shallowly inclined to the horizontal, a great many of them
never disappearing below the horizon.
The Sun and Moon Spirits are prominent in Inuit cosmology; the sun is
female and the moon male. Yet the sun’s role in Inuit myth is limited; by far
the more important figure is the moon, her brother. Moon Man was widely
seen as a benevolent and approachable spirit, a direct help in maintaining
human life. This is scarcely surprising, since it is the principal luminary dur
ing the long, dark winter nights, especially prominent during those years (de
pending upon the lunar node cycle) when the winter moon would circle
above the horizon each month for several days on end.
Observances to mark the winter solstice, or (above the Arctic Circle) to
mark the first brief noonday appearance of the sun after the “great dark
ness,” were certainly important. Great festivities lasting for many days have
been recorded in Greenland, but in many other places they were rather sub
dued, since this is one of the most difficult times of the year. Children (sym
bolic of renewal) were often to the fore: in one custom, they would smile at
the newly appeared sun, but only with one side of their face. This was to
show that while warmer weather was now assured, the coldest part of the
winter was yet to come. The summer solstice, in contrast, apparently was of
little or no importance. Summer festivals recorded by early ethnographers
tended to take place later in the season or as the first terrestrial signs (such
as the formation of ice floes) heralded the onset of winter.
Traditionally, Inuit communities have named relatively few bright
stars and constellations. They saw the majority generally as spirits of the
dead or as “holes in the sky.” Ursa Major is one distinctive group of stars
that was widely recognized; it was seen variously as a herd of caribou or
as a single animal. It was used for navigating and for marking time. Spe
cific meanings, and the stories associated with them, most often attached
to those brighter stars that were seen to set and rise again. Thus Sirius,
which only appeared low in the southern sky in the middle of winter, and
flickered brightly in different colors owing to atmospheric effects, was
known by some Inuit peoples as the “fox star,” and was seen as a red fox
and a white fox fighting to get into the same foxhole. The annual patterns
of appearance and disappearance of these stars were also used to mark
times of the year.
The exceptional nature of the terrestrial environment in which they live
has strongly influenced Inuit knowledge and beliefs, but so too has their ex
ceptional sky. The extent to which their distinctive view of the positions and
motions of the celestial bodies has given rise to characteristic aspects of Inuit
cosmology is an issue about which little more may be knowable, but it high
lights the wider cultural significance of the shreds of evidence that have sur
vived concerning traditional Inuit sky knowledge.

Iron-Age Roundhouses
Unlike the preceding two thousand years, which remain conspicuous in the
British landscape by way of their monumental tombs and temples while set
tlement evidence is sparse, the archaeological record of the late second and
first millennium B.C.E. in Britain—conventionally labeled as the Middle
Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age—is characterized by settlements. There
were isolated farmsteads; villages, both open and fortified; and hill forts,
some of which housed communities of several hundred people. The domi
nant form of domestic architecture during this period was the roundhouse,
and several thousand of these have been uncovered by archaeologists over
the years. They were generally of moderate size, typically between about
eight meters (twenty-five feet) and fifteen meters (fifty feet) across. A ring
of upright wooden posts or planks, either within the walls or forming a sep
arate interior ring, supported a conical roof, which was probably thatched
with straw or reeds and may often have been covered in turf. Inside this
roof space, smoke from a central fire could accumulate before gradually
permeating out through the thatch.
The roundhouse provided good and effective shelter from the British
climate, and it is scarcely surprising that there was just a single doorway.
But it may seem odd that the direction the entrance faced was far from ran
dom. At first, roundhouses faced predominantly southward, but from c.
1200 B.C.E. onward the great majority of roundhouse doorways faced gen
erally toward the east or southeast. Why? An obvious practical explanation
is that by placing the entrance in this direction the roundhouse interior
would be sheltered from the prevailing westerly winds and could be
warmed by letting the early morning sunlight enter the house. Yet if west
erly winds were the major factor, might there not be greater variation in ori
entation? It also seems curious that little attempt was made to avoid the el
ements in the actual siting of buildings and settlements. Furthermore,
similar orientation practices seem to extend more widely—for example, to
hill fort entrances, where the prevailing wind would hardly have been a
consideration.
Iron-Age Roundhouses 195
Pure Mathematical Physics



The “obvious” explanation was increasingly challenged in the 1990s.
Detailed analyses of the azimuths of roundhouse entrances showed that
there are particular concentrations around due east (between about 85 de
grees and 95 degrees) and similarly around southeast (between about 125
degrees and 135 degrees). There was a significant drop between the two as
well as a sharp drop outside the whole range (85 degrees to 135 degrees).
The second of the two ranges corresponds to the position of midwinter sun
rise, prompting suggestions that the solstitial sun was the intended target,
and a natural extension of the argument was to suggest that the easterly con
centration had something to do with the equinox. But why should the equi
nox have been a significant target at all, since it does not represent a physi
cal “station of the sun,” only the half-way point between its two extreme
rising positions? The position of winter solstice sunrise, on the other hand,
is certainly tangible, in that it represents the limit of the part of the horizon
where the sun can rise, separating it from the southern quarter, which the
sun only ever passes over. But even so, why should the direction of sunrise
at different times in the year have had any bearing upon the way people ori
ented their houses and other structures?
Vital clues are provided by practices still known among certain modern
indigenous peoples, together with broader archaeological evidence concern
ing the spatial distribution of different activities within the Iron Age round
houses themselves. To take one modern example, hogans, traditional houses
of the Navajo, face eastwards toward the sacred mountain of the east, for
reasons that have to do with keeping life in harmony with a cosmos per
ceived to be divided into four quarters. The earth lodges of the Pawnee pro
vide another example where the dominant practice of entrance orientation
again, toward the east—derives from the dominant worldview. A more
general principle is at work in these cases, of which entrance orientations
form just one part: these modern roundhouses serve as models of the
world—microcosms—designed as such so that people can live their lives at
one with the cosmos.
Recent work provides compelling evidence that there were many sym
bolic divisions of space and activity within Iron-Age roundhouses in relation
to their overall design and orientation: for example, between living, eating,
and sleeping; between preparing and eating food; between male and female
activities; and so on. Everyday activities that we would see as mundane and
unconsequential were, it seems, strictly enacted in accordance with a prevail
ing worldview, as is the case among the modern indigenous peoples just men
tioned. Within this context, it is scarcely surprising that the entrance orienta
tions should have been heavily influenced by cosmological considerations.
Nonetheless, considerations that seem to us altogether more pragmatic
may also have played their part. As in the case of the Pawnee earth lodge,
196 Iron-Age Roundhouses
Pure Mathematical Physics



the practical benefits of houses facing the warmth of the early morning sun
could certainly have been recognized. The separation between behavior that
we would see as having clear practical ends and what we might choose to
describe as symbolic or even irrational did not exist in the minds of prehis
toric people. There was no clear separation between special rites that ap
peased the cosmic powers and those mundane activities that filled and main
tained life from hour to hour and day to day. In this sense, there was a sacred
aspect to the very houses in which they lived out their daily lives; the orien
tation of those houses in relation to the rising sun is just one manifestation
of this.

Is Paras
Is Paras is one of an extraordinary type of prehistoric monument known as
nuraghi that is found in copious numbers on the Mediterranean island of Sar
dinia. Located near to the modern town of Isili, Is Paras was built during the
Bronze Age, probably around the middle of the second millennium B.C.E. De
spite some damage to the exterior, it contains one of the most impressive ex
amples of the central chamber characteristic of all nuraghi, and this is pre
served intact. Circular in cross-section at ground level, measuring over 6.5
meters (21 feet) across, the walls rise vertically for several meters before be
ginning to close in. From this point, layer upon layer of stone blocks are grad
ually corbelled inwards, each supporting the next so as to form a high vaulted
roof. Although it is built entirely of dry stone, it rises to an incredible 11.5
meters (over 37 feet), making it the tallest example known.
Is Paras 197
Pure Mathematical Physics



It has been suggested that the tower functioned as part of a system of
inter-nuraghe alignments marking solar and lunar events. Viewed from an
other nuraghe, Nueddas, a few kilometers away, it is a prominent skyline
feature and marks the position of midsummer sunset. However, what makes
Is Paras of particular interest is a distinctive light-and-shadow phenomenon
that also seems to relate to the summer solstice.
The apex of the vaulted roof is unusual in having a small round open
ing, about forty centimeters (sixteen inches) across. A stone, possibly used to
cover the hole, was discovered on top of the tower by excavators in the late
1990s, but it could be moved by one or two people and is too small to pro
vide a permanent cover. While it is possible that a larger, more permanent
stone was used at one time to cover the hole, there is no sign of it now. It is
therefore a strong possibility, though by no means a certainty, that the hole
was designed to be uncovered at least at certain times.
When the sun is high in the sky, sunlight enters the chamber and casts
a dagger of light onto the chamber wall. This only happens around the mid
dle of the day, and since the sun is toward the south at this time, the dagger
appears on the northern wall, moving in a “U”-shaped curve down and to
the left until local noon is reached, whereupon it starts to move upwards
again, continuing to the left. At noon on the summer solstice, the sun is as

high as it ever reaches in the sky and the noontime dagger reaches its lowest
point of all. This is on the very lowest layer of stones, within two centime
ters of the floor. For a period of about twenty minutes on this day, it moves
across on this level before starting to rise up again.
This example epitomizes the problems of interpreting a “one-off” phe
nomenon. Nothing like it has been discovered at any other nuraghe, despite
the fact that there are several thousand of them, and this must cast doubt
upon its authenticity. Could it simply be a coincidence? Was the hole per
manently covered? And yet the fact that the light dagger reaches so close to
the floor without actually touching it—surely an incredible coincidence if
unintentional—seems to argue otherwise. Without further contextual evi
dence we may never know whether this phenomenon was deliberately in
tended, or if it was deliberate, what it actually meant to the people who built
and used this tower back in the Bronze Age.

Islamic Astronomy
Scholars in the Islamic world were responsible for providing a vital bridge
connecting ancient Babylonian and Greek astronomy to modern scientific
astronomy. But for this bridge, the traditions of thought that had led to the
development of mathematical astronomy in Hellenistic Greece (after the
conquests of Alexander the Great in the fourth century B.C.E. had brought
the Babylonian and Greek traditions into direct contact) would have been
all but severed. In any case, several centuries had passed by the time (in the
ninth century C.E.) that serious quantities of old astronomical treatises writ
ten in Greek began to be retrieved, translated into Arabic, and thence com
municated around the Muslim world. There they helped give birth to one
of the world’s richest and most sophisticated astronomical traditions. Early
elements of this tradition (including translations and re-translations of the
ancient Greek texts) subsequently passed into Christian Europe, where they
contributed to the development of ideas within the European Renaissance.
(This legacy is most obvious today in the fact that a number of modern star
names, such as Aldebaran, Alnilam, Alnitak, and Altair—as well as techni
Islamic Astronomy 199
Pure Mathematical Physics



cal terms, such as azimuth, zenith and nadir—are Arabic in origin.) How
ever, Islamic astronomy continued to develop in its own right until around
the beginning of the sixteenth century, and Europeans remained largely ig
norant of it. In fact, developments in Europe and the Muslim world re
mained largely independent until the nineteenth century.
Astronomy and astronomers generally thrived in the Islamic world. The
distinctive nature of the astronomy that they studied and practiced derived
from a particular mixture of traditions: indigenous folk astronomies, Baby
lonian and Greek ideas drawn from ancient texts, and elements of Persian
and Indian astronomy absorbed as the Muslim world stretched eastwards.
An example of this mixed intellectual heritage is the set of stars and aster
isms known as anw§’ that identified twenty-eight lunar stations or “man
sions”; these helped identify the position of the moon on successive nights
and hence to track its monthly course through the stars. The general concept
may well have been adopted from Hindu astronomy, while the chosen refer
ence stars derived from Bedouin knowledge of heliacal and acronical events.
Muslim astronomers advanced mathematical astronomy in various ways, in
cluding studies of the motions of the sun, moon, and planets, and catalogues

zßjes. They were also responsible for the construction of many fine portable
astronomical instruments and made a number of important technical ad
vances in the design of the astrolabe and the quadrant.
Coexisting alongside what we would recognize as scientific astronomy
was a tradition of folk astronomy that did not involve any attempt to make
systematic observations or predictions based on mathematical models. What
it did do was to regulate both agricultural activities and religious ones using
straightforward observations of the skies. While mathematical astronomy
could achieve the same ends, and indeed do so with a great deal more preci
sion, it was the preserve of just a few specialists; folk astronomy, on the other
hand, was accessible to all, and thus had far wider social implications since
it determined everyday practice for ordinary people.
Prior to the widespread adoption of the Muslim faith, different cultural
traditions within what became the Islamic world would have tended to pro
duce a mish-mash of local seasonal calendars and/or astronomical rules of
thumb molded by the particular subsistence requirements of a given com
munity. The rapid exchange of ideas within the Islamic world itself brought
about a degree of rationalization: thus a broadly consistent set of anw§’ be
came widely used for divination and were increasingly adopted as a means
of time keeping. Nonetheless, what makes it possible to speak meaningfully
of “Islamic folk astronomy” is the fact that very particular requirements
would have been imposed upon all practicing Muslims by sacred Islamic law.
Folk astronomies all over the Muslim world adapted to satisfy these com
mon needs.
The first essential was to observe religious festivals on the right days,
and particularly to correctly define such critical dates as the beginning and
end of the month-long fast in the holy month of Ramadan. The formal Is
lamic calendar is lunar, and consists of only twelve synodic (phase-cycle)
months, since intercalary months are forbidden by the Quran: this means
that it is eleven days shorter than the seasonal year. Whatever calendars were
in local use for seasonal reckoning, it was necessary for liturgical purposes
to determine the start of each new month by direct observations of the new
crescent moon. People with good eyesight might be sent to watch the west
ern sky on the critical evenings, and various solutions had to be found when
the critical part of the sky was obscured by cloud. It is scarcely surprising
that the star and crescent symbol, depicting the crescent moon, has become
a global symbol of the Islamic faith.
An imperative for any Muslim is to observe the five daily prayers,
which must take place within set intervals during the day and night. The in
tervals in question are specified according to the daily motions of the sun: in
relation to the lengths of shadows when the sun is up; in relation to certain
visible phenomena (such as the redness of the sky) at twilight; and in rela

tion to set time intervals during the night (the evening prayer, specifically,
should preferably be completed before a third of the night has passed). This
means that the actual prayer times vary both according to latitude and lon
gitude, and at any given place they change from day to day with the varying
length of daylight. This makes the problem of determining the correct prayer
times nontrivial, and before tables based on scientific data became available,
the use of sundials and gnomons was common, with anw§’ used to estimate
the time of night.
Folk astronomy had a third and rather different application, though to
something no less vital in the practice of the Muslim faith. This was to help
determine the sacred direction, or qibla. One of the most basic necessities for
any Muslim is to know the direction of Mecca, in order to determine the cor
rect bodily orientation during prayers and other activities. Formally this has
nothing to do with astronomy, but (again, before Muslim mathematicians
had produced tabulations of the qibla for different latitudes and longitudes)
astronomical observations were extensively used to provide the best avail
able approximations, some of which were rather better than others. Typi
cally they used the horizon rising or setting point of a particular bright star
or the rising or setting arc of the sun. This seemed only natural as the base
of the Kaaba itself—the cube-shaped stone structure at the center of the
Great Mosque in Mecca that forms the sacred center of the Muslim world
had been known as far back as the seventh century to have its longer axis
oriented upon the rising of the star Canopus and its minor axis aligned
(roughly) in line with midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset.
Historically, the assumed qibla is most evident in the orientation of
mosques and in the layouts of some cities. In some cases, historical accounts
attest to how the sacred direction was actually determined. Thus, we know
that the earliest mosques in Iraq were built with their prayer walls facing
midwinter sunset in order to face the northeastern wall of the Kaaba, while
Egyptian ones were built with their prayer walls facing midwinter sunrise in
an attempt to be parallel with the Kaaba’s northwestern wall. However, in
many cases we can only speculate about the methods used to determine the
qibla. Since the errors were sometimes considerable, anyone trying to recon
struct the motivation behind mosque orientations in the absence of anything
but the orientations themselves would have a hard time fathoming that the
intention was always to orient them toward Mecca.

Island of the Sun
The Inca empire dominated a huge swath of the Andean region running
down the west coast of South America for almost a century before the ar
rival of the Europeans in 1532. At its height, it stretched for no less than
4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) from north to south, an area that extends
from the northern border of Ecuador down to Santiago, Chile. The Inca
rulers rose to dominance remarkably quickly and ruled their vast and di
verse state using bureaucratic and rigidly hierarchical procedures to organ
ize labor and redistribute food and other raw materials. One mechanism of
conquest was subsuming the religions and ideologies of captured peoples
within a state-controlled cult. It was dedicated to three principal deities,
among whom Inti, the Sun god, was prominent. The ruling Inca elite
claimed to be descended from Inti himself, and in this way the dominant
ideology they had imposed served also as a mechanism of political control,
putting their own right to rule beyond question.
In one myth recounted by the chronicler Bernabé Cobo, the “true
dwelling place of the sun” was said to be a large crag on the island in the
huge inland lake of Titicaca, on the border between modern Peru and Bo
livia. According to the legend, the ancient peoples had been without light for
many days. “Finally, the people of the Island of Titicaca saw the Sun come
up one morning out of that crag with extraordinary radiance. For this rea
son they believed that the true dwelling place of the Sun was that crag, or at
least that crag was the most delightful thing in the world for the Sun”
(Hamilton 1990, pp. 91–92). This myth evidently had pre-Inca origins, but
under Inca control the island became a destination for pilgrimages to the
sun’s place of origin. A sanctuary was built around the sacred crag and ac
cess was tightly controlled. Common pilgrims were only permitted if they
Island of the Sun 203

followed various strict protocols and donated appropriate offerings. Even
then, they were not allowed near the sacred crag, but had to watch the sun
rise ceremony from a distance. By combining elements of Cobo’s and other
accounts with archaeological examinations of the remains of the sanctuary
and archaeoastronomical measurements to determine the rising direction of
the sun at different times, archaeologist Brian Bauer and archaeoastronomer
David Dearborn have deduced that the sunrise-watching ceremony almost
certainly took place in June or July, perhaps at the June solstice itself.
The fact that the sunrise ceremony at the sanctuary on the Island of the
Sun is historically attested allows us to answer questions that we would not
be able to answer if we had to rely upon archaeological evidence alone.
Compare, for example, later British prehistoric sites such as Brainport Bay,
a solstitially aligned set of platforms and structures, where we would dearly
like to know who made sunrise observations and for what purpose; Stone
henge, where—although it is evident that only a select few could observe sol
stitial sunrise or sunset from within the huge stones of the sarsen circle—we
can only speculate about the observers’ social status and purpose, and
whether larger crowds were allowed to spectate from a distance; and the
Thornborough henges, which appear from the archaeological evidence to
have been a pilgrimage destination, and we are keen to ask when in the year
people came here and what the place signified to them.

Javanese Calendar
To many generations of rice farmers in rural Java, Indonesia, it was not the
stars of Ursa Major that formed the plough, but the stars of Orion. Here,
close to the equator, the constellation appears on its side and Orion’s belt
plus three of the four outer stars (excluding Betelgeuse) were seen to re
semble a traditional Javanese plough (Weluku): they constituted the con
stellation Bintang Weluku.
The changing appearance of this constellation (together with the
Pleiades) over the year was used to provide various rules of thumb to regu
late the different seasonal activities associated with inundated rice cultiva
tion. The beginning of the new agricultural year was marked by the plough’s
first appearance in the pre-dawn sky (heliacal rise). This happened around
the time of the June solstice. At this time the celestial plough was upright,
just like earthly ploughs when in use. Three months later, with Bintang
Weluku rising progressively earlier each night, came the onset of the rainy
season and the time to prepare the tools and check the water channels.
When the plough eventually rose at sunset (acronical rise) and was once
again upright, it was the time for the women to sow the rice in the nursery
and for the men to start plowing the fields. About a month later, at around
the time of the December solstice, the process began of harrowing the fields
(men) and transplanting the seedlings into the fields (women). (Planting was
also regulated by the phase of the moon.) By now, Bintang Weluku was ap
pearing higher and higher in the sky after sunset, and the end of this period
was marked by its culmination (appearing at its highest point in the sky) at
dusk. Four months later, when the rain had stopped and the rice had
ripened, the harvest began. This season was marked by the celestial plough
appearing progressively lower in the western sky after sunset. At this time it
was perceived as upside down, “like a farmer’s plough when the work is
done.” Soon afterwards, it disappeared completely (heliacal set).
The workings of this pragmatic stellar calendar are reminiscent of Hes
iod’s words of advice to Greek farmers in the eighth century B.C.E. Numer

ous other practices known from many different parts of the world also reg
ulate seasonal farming activities (both growing crops and managing live
stock) by reference to the observed behavior of prominent stars or asterisms.
Bintang Weluku remained in use until around the late nineteenth cen
tury and is still prominent in folk memory, despite the co-existence of two
other methods of dividing the year. The first involved numerical (i.e., non
astronomical) cycles such as five- and seven-day weeks and 210-day years,
which derived from a mix of Islamic and Hindu traditions. This system was
institutionalized and also used for divination. The other calendar, known as
the pranotomongso (or pranatamongsa), was based on measurements of the
length of the sun’s shadow at noon, regulated since the seventeenth century
by using an accurate gnomon device known as a bencet. This calendar di
vided the year into twelve unequal divisions, although only four were widely
used in practice. These were demarcated by the solstices and the days of so
lar zenith passage.

Julian Calendar
The new civic calendar introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 B.C.E. was revo
lutionary in that it ignored the moon. Earlier calendars in the Roman world
had been based on the lunar phase cycle and had gotten badly out of step
with the seasonal year. Remarkably, two key elements of our own modern
calendar date all the way back to Caesar’s innovations. The first is its divi
sion into twelve months, each with a fixed number of days, chosen so as to
add up to the number of whole days in the seasonal year (365). The word
month in this context is in fact a complete misnomer, since the divisions of
our year are completely independent of the cycle of lunar phases. The sec
ond innovation was the concept of a leap year. By introducing an additional
day once every four years, the average length of a year in the Julian calen
dar became 365.25 days, very close to the true length of the year.
The Julian calendar did not escape teething troubles. For over three
decades an additional day was mistakenly inserted every third instead of
every fourth year, necessitating a retrospective adjustment. Only by C.E. 8
208 Julian Calendar
Pure Mathematical Physics



was the pattern established that remains familiar today, whereby every
fourth year (whenever the year is divisible by four) is a leap year.
The Julian calendar survived intact for over 1500 years in the Christian
world, but (with the exception of Ethiopia) was eventually superseded by the
more accurate Gregorian calendar. This happened at different times in dif
ferent countries according to whether the dominant tradition was Catholic,
Protestant, or Orthodox. Those who study calendrically related phenomena
in medieval times, for example the orientations of medieval churches, have
to be critically aware of the differences between the two calendars.

Kintraw
This megalithic monument on the west coast of Argyll, Scotland, consists
of a single standing stone four meters (thirteen feet) high situated between
two round cairns. It probably dates to the late third or early second mil
lennium B.C.E. It is well known because it was the place where, in the
1970s, an archaeological excavation was first used to test an astronomical
theory deduced from alignment studies.
The horizon all around this site is relatively close except toward the
southwest, where there is a distant view toward the Isle of Jura, some 45
kilometers (28 miles) away. Here two adjacent mountain peaks stand out
prominently with a deep, sharp notch between them. As viewed from the
standing stone, this notch aligns precisely with the midwinter sunset. Close
to the winter solstice, the top part of the setting sun would reappear briefly
in the bottom of the notch, but at the solstice itself it would be slightly too
low, and only then would it disappear from view.
When Alexander Thom discovered this alignment, he also discovered
a problem. The notch is just hidden from the standing stone itself by an in
tervening ridge; only a 2.5-meter (8-foot) giant would be able to see it from
the standing stone. Undeterred, Thom followed the alignment back toward
the northeast where it crosses a deep gorge and then climbs a steep hillside.
Halfway up this precipitous slope is a narrow ledge, which would have pro
vided the perfect spot from which to observe the setting sun. From here, the
standing stone appears directly beneath the deep notch. But there was no
obvious sign of human activity here, just two rounded boulders. Was the
ledge simply a natural feature? Here was the perfect opportunity for an ar
chaeological test of an astronomical theory: if the ledge could be shown by
excavation to be artificial, then this would vindicate the idea that it was used
211
K
Pure Mathematical Physics



as an observing platform.
Archaeologist Euan MacKie rose to the challenge in 1970 and 1971.
Unfortunately, his excavations did not reveal any clear and direct signs of
human activity. However, they did show that the flat part of the ledge was
covered with rounded pebbles, which he suggested had been carefully placed
there to form a viewing platform. The problem was that they might have ar
rived naturally, rolling down the hill and coming to rest behind the two
larger boulders. Analyses were undertaken of the orientations of the pebbles,
in the hope of distinguishing between the two possibilities, but no clear con
clusion could be reached. Thus MacKie’s excavations proved inconclusive.
One of the general questions that arises from Thom’s theory of highly
precise solstitial sightlines is how they could have been set up in the first
place. One of the most plausible ideas is that a row of people, stretching per
pendicularly to the sightline, watched the sunset on days leading up to the
solstice. Each day, fewer or them would see the sun reappear in the notch, as
the sun’s setting path sank slightly in the sky (the opposite would be true at
a notch where the sun rose or set at the summer solstice). Each evening a
temporary marker would be set up to mark the limiting position where the
sun could be seen to reappear in the notch. Day by day, this position would
move sideways, by less and less as the solstice approached, until the limit
was eventually reached and the position began to move back in the opposite
direction. For the summer solstice, the limit would mark the spot where the
tip of the sun would only appear in the notch on the solstice itself; for the
winter solstice, as at Kintraw, it would mark the spot from which the sun
would only disappear on the solstice itself. This, then, would be the spot
where a permanent marker would be erected.
There are two serious problems with this procedure at Kintraw. First,
there is no room to set out a line of people as just described, because the plat
form is situated on the side of a precipitous hillside above a deep gorge. Sec
ond, the intervening ridge blocks the view of the distant notch from those
positions where one would have had to stand in order to watch the sunset
on the days before and after the solstice. There are also more general prob
lems that bring into question the whole idea that solstitial sightlines of pin
point precision could have been established at British megalithic sites such as
Kintraw, Ballochroy, or the Ring of Brodgar. An obvious imponderable
would have been the British weather: the setting-up procedure would only
work given a reasonable run of clear evenings, something that would have
been far from guaranteed even given that the weather in western Scotland in
later prehistoric times was somewhat different from now. Another is the pos
sibility of significant day-to-day variations in atmospheric refraction due to
changing atmospheric conditions, which would alter the apparent altitude of
the setting sun.
212 Kintraw
Pure Mathematical Physics



The reappearance of the setting sun in the notch at Kintraw for a pe
riod around the December solstice would undoubtedly have formed a spec
tacular sight. Certainly, it may have been deeply significant to the people
who constructed (not necessarily at the same time) the cairns and monolith:
the larger cairn, for example, had a setting of stones resembling an entrance
(known as a false portal) facing in this general direction. Perhaps no greater
precision than this was needed. By trying too hard to fit prehistoric people
into the mould of ancient “scientific” astronomers, and by focusing too
closely on the possible existence of alignments of pinpoint precision, we risk
failing to grasp more useful insights into the part that astronomy really
played in prehistoric burial and ceremonial practices.

Kukulcan
The pyramid of Kukulcan, also known as El Castillo, is one of the most im
pressive constructions at the Maya site of Chichen Itza. Some consider its
innate calendrical significance to be expressed in the numerology of its four
stairways, one on each side, each of which rises in ninety-one steps to the
top platform; adding the final step into the temple on the top makes 365
steps in all. The pyramid is not cardinally oriented but skewed by about
twenty-one degrees clockwise, and archaeoastronomers have investigated
the possible reasons for this as part of systematic studies of the orientations
of Maya temples and city plans. However, the phenomenon that has cap
tured the public imagination was apparently discovered by chance by a
caretaker at the site in the late 1920s.
Twice each year, at around the time of the equinoxes, the late afternoon
sun slants across the stepped terraces of the northwestern (actually NNW)
corner of the pyramid and casts a sinuous shadow onto one balustrade of the
northern (actually NNE) staircase. At the bottom of this balustrade is a large
stone serpent’s head, and the shadow appears to complete the body of the
serpent, undulating back up the balustrade. The shadow is visible for an
hour or two, as sunset approaches.
Whether the phenomenon that has become known as the equinox hi
erophany was intentionally orchestrated by the builders is highly question
able. Given the overall fourfold symmetry of the monument, it seems incon
gruous that the northern staircase should be favored in this way. However,
Kukulcan 213
Pure Mathematical Physics



the pyramid does overlay an earlier version, and this one only had a single
stairway which was on the northern (actually NNE) side. Furthermore, there
is good evidence to relate the pyramid to Kukulcan, a plumed serpent (feath
ered rattlesnake) god prominent in the Mesoamerican pantheon, known
later to the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl. There is also good evidence to relate
Quetzalcoatl to the planet Venus. A platform to the north of the Kukulcan
pyramid has wall carvings containing a number of Venus symbols, and as a
result has become known as the Platform of Venus. This has led some to sug
gest that the timing of the so-called equinox hierophany may have had more
to do with the motions of Venus than the equinox.
Be this as it may, the site has certainly become the focus for modern pil
grimage. The hierophany is now witnessed by tens of thousands of visitors,
which has become interesting as a modern sociological phenomenon in itself.

Kumukahi
Cape Kumukahi, in the southeastern corner of the Big Island of Hawai‘i,
forms the bleak, easternmost extremity of the Hawaiian island chain. Lava
flows have pushed across this flat plain over the centuries, most recently in
1960, when the molten rock stopped just short of the lighthouse at the end
of the road out across the cape—something regarded by many as a concilia
tory gesture by the volcano goddess Pele. East of the lighthouse, close to the
coast, is a rugged landscape formed of large irregular chunks of black lava.
This is an unlikely setting for astronomical observations, yet it is one
of the very few places mentioned explicitly in this regard in Hawaiian oral
history. Two traditions have come down to us. The first, recorded by the
ethnographer Nathaniel Emerson in 1909 as a footnote in a book about
sacred songs of the hula, refers to a “pillar of stone,” itself called Ku
Kumukahi 215

Pure Mathematical Physics



mukahi, and a “monolith,” to the south of it, called Makahoni. According
to Emerson:
In summer the sun in its northern excursion inclined, as the Hawaiians noted, to the side of Kumukahi, while in the season of cool weather, called Makalii, it swung in the opposite direction and passed over to Makahoni. The people of Puna accordingly said, “The sun has passed over to Makahoni,” or “The sun has passed over to Kumukahi,” as the case might be. (Emerson 1997 [1909], p.197)
Ethnographer Martha Beckwith recorded a slightly different legend. By this
account, a red stone at the extreme end of the cape represents the god Ku
mukahi, a god with healing powers who can take the form of a plover. Two
further stones represent his wives, who “manipulate the seasons by pushing
the sun back and forth between them at the two solstices” (Beckwith 1970
[1940], p.119).
The observations described in the myths are hardly of great sophistica
tion. The significance of this example is that the Kumukahi pillars constitute
one of very few calendrical markers whose location is identified in Polynesian
oral traditions with absolute certainty. Without these legends, this barren cor
ner of the Hawaiian islands would surely be one of the last places a modern
archaeoastronomer might think to look for evidence of ancient astronomical
observations. The visible landscape is formed entirely in relatively modern
times, a substantial part of it within living memory; such landmarks as there
are were formed by natural processes rather than human intervention. The
stones and pillars of which the legends speak are not easy to single out from
among the many natural lava pillars in the area, if indeed they are still stand
ing. Even with the help of the legends, the exact nature of the observations,
and hence of the alignments that may still exist, is not entirely clear. Nonethe
less, a combination of archaeology and archaeoastronomy may yet manage
to identify the Kumukahi pillars with a fair degree of confidence.
One cannot visit Kumukahi without wondering what the ancient
Hawaiians could possibly have been doing in such a desolate spot. Yet this
was undoubtedly a sacred place, featuring in a number of different songs and
chants. We do not need to postulate the existence of more precise astro
nomical alignments in order to explain its sacred significance; we probably
need look no further than the fact that it was an extremity, beyond which
the boundless ocean extended away in the direction of the rising sun. In this
sense, it may have something in common with remote Necker Island, at the
opposite end of the chain.

Kumulipo
Just because a human society has not developed writing does not mean that
it cannot generate literature. In many nonliterate cultures, certain stories
and particularly creation myths—were so sacred that they were carefully
learned and passed on from generation to generation, strictly verbatim, and
thereby preserved intact for many decades or even centuries. Recital or per
formance, sacred in itself, was typically a formal affair and subject to strict
protocols. The audience was often restricted to those of sufficient rank or
those suitably initiated in some way.
A fine example of such oral literature is the Hawaiian prayer chant
known as the Kumulipo. Passed down through several generations of high
chiefs (ali‘i), it came into the possession of the last native ruler of Hawai‘i,
King David Kalakaua, after which it was recorded and translated into Eng
lish. It originated as far back as the mid-eighteenth century, a longevity that
is all the more remarkable given its considerable length—over two thousand
lines. It was composed for the ali‘i Ka-‘»-i-mamao, and clearly served as a le
gitimization of his rank and power. Its purpose was to demonstrate how he
(and, by extrapolation, his descendants) was directly descended from a string
of culture heroes and ultimately from the gods themselves. The Kumulipo
was, according to later Hawaiian informants, the very chant that was recited
to Captain Cook during a ceremony at Hikiau heiau on the Big Island of
Hawai‘i, when he was being received as the god Lono.
The Kumulipo combines a creation story and description of the world
with genealogies that recount (or, as an outsider would see it, establish) the
lineage of the chief. It is in the form of a poem, although substantial chunks
consist of no more than lists of names. Although genealogical prayer chants
of this nature are not exceptional in Polynesia, the Kumulipo describes var
ious natural phenomena in particular detail. It is, in this sense, an excellent
natural history. The heavens are included, of course, and the work actually
Kumulipo 217
Pure Mathematical Physics



begins with a reference to the sun, moon, and Pleiades. Some have claimed
that a much richer body of astronomical knowledge is represented in the
form of hidden, double meanings, which were undoubtedly included.
Hawaiian is a language ripe for punning; subtle word play, allusions, and
different levels of meaning were an essential characteristic of sacred chants.
The difficulty lies in accurately reconstructing them. Unfortunately, much
was lost in the early transcriptions of Hawaiian, which ignored subtle but vi
tal differences in vowel sounds that have only relatively recently been repre
sented using appropriate diacritical marks. The underlying, hidden meanings
of old texts are extremely difficult to reconstruct, even for native Hawaiian
scholars, and can vary widely in their interpretations. In this regard, the Ku
mulipo is no exception.
The genealogical lists in the Kumulipo certainly include known star
names. One native Hawaiian scholar, Rubellite Kawena Johnson, has argued
that the chant describes the heavenly cycles in considerable detail using var
ious numerological encodings and devices. Others, however, argue that the
particular ordering of and relationships between the natural phenomena de
scribed have more to do with the requirements of good rhythmic balance.
However this debate is ultimately resolved, the Kumulipo is interesting
enough as an example of a creation story that not only describes the natural
world and its human inhabitants but tries to explain it.

Lakota Sacred Geography
The traditional homeland of the Lakota (Sioux) is the Black Hills, an iso
lated oval-shaped area of mountains on the border between South Dakota
and Wyoming. The mountains stretch some 180 kilometers (120 miles)
from north to south and 80 kilometers (50 miles) east to west, and are sur
rounded by flat plains. The name Lakota means “Friends of the Earth,”
and the Lakota, traditionally a nomadic people, kept their lives in har
mony with the cosmos by tuning their seasonal path through the land
scape to the annual cycle of the sun through the stars. The basis of their
subsistence was the buffalo (tatanka), an animal they considered to em
body the power of the sun. As they followed the herds through the land
scape, they received spiritual instruction from the stars. Although their
traditional way of life was virtually eliminated during the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries, as were the extensive buffalo herds that used to roam
this country, the Lakota are now sharing with outsiders elements of their
tradition as they try to rebuild it.
The Lakota perceive a direct connection between certain places in the
landscape and certain groups of stars in the sky. Thus Harney Peak, the
highest mountain in the Black Hills, was associated with Seven Little Girls
(the Pleiades), and isolated Devil’s Peak was connected with Bear’s Lodge
(part of Gemini). During the year, the Lakota traditionally moved from their
winter camps south of the Black Hills northward, toward and into the
range. This journey, following the seasonal movements of the buffalo
through the landscape, also followed the path of the sun through the con
stellations, and an integral part of the process was the performance of the
appropriate sacred rites. On one level, this annual journey, regulated by ob
servations of astronomical phenomena, simply served to ensure the success
ful exploitation of a vital food resource. However, this outsiders’ perspective
fails utterly to comprehend anything of the meaning of these practices to the
people who undertook them. From the Lakota standpoint, the whole jour
ney was a ceremony—a sort of ritual pilgrimage—that first and foremost
219
L
Pure Mathematical Physics



preserved the balance of life and ensured peace and harmony in the cosmos
in general.
A few details serve to give an idea of the complexities involved. The
spring journey away from the winter encampments commenced when the
sun entered the Cansana Ipusye constellation (parts of Aries and Triangu
lum). The same phrase, Cansana Ipusye, is used by the Lakota to describe
the Dried Willow, the Sacred Pipe in which it was smoked, and the wooden
spoon in which shamans would carry live coals (representing the sun) as the
journey commenced. At the same time (around the spring equinox), the sa
cred powers in the sky would use the celestial wooden spoon (Ursa Major)
to carry the sun to the celestial pipe (Aries/Triangulum).
When the sun arrived at the Pleiades, the people would camp at Har
ney Peak and perform ceremonies welcoming back the Thunders. After this,
the sun moved toward the center of “the great circle of stars” (Rigel, Sirius,
Procyon, Pollux, Castor, Menkalinan, Capella, and the Pleiades) while the
people moved to Pe Sla, a “bare hill” in the middle of the Black Hills. Emerg
ing out of the celestial great circle are the head (Hyades), backbone (Orion’s
belt), ribs (Betelgeuse/Bellatrix and Rigel) and tail (Sirius) of a buffalo, the
animal that symbolized all life. Likewise, the Black Hills were seen as the
place out of which all life was annually renewed on earth. For this reason,
rites took place there at this time to welcome back life: water was poured on
the earth to feed the plants, seeds were scattered for birds, and buffalo
tongues were offered for meat-eating animals.
As the summer solstice approached, the sun approached the Bear’s
Lodge (Mato Tipila) and the people arrived at the Devil’s Tower. Mato Tip
ila was created by the central figure in Lakota oral tradition, Fallen Star, to
protect two children threatened by bears. The constellation is located on one
side of, but nonetheless within, the great circle of stars, whereas its earthly
equivalent, Devil’s Tower, is in fact some one hundred kilometers (sixty
miles) northwest of the Black Hills. This configuration seems contradictory
from a Western perspective, serving to remind us how wrong we could be if
we tried to reconstruct elements of Lakota worldview from partial historical
information without having modern informants. We might easily try to en
force too literal an interpretation of the mapping between sky and earth, and
dismiss the idea that the Devil’s Tower could have been part of the scheme.
It was at Devil’s Tower that, in July or August, the annual Sun Dance took
place. Contrary to popular belief, this was a solemn ritual, the last celebra
tion of the season devoted to the sun, buffalo, and the Black Hills.
The Lakota, like many indigenous peoples, ascribe spiritual meaning to
the whole landscape and to particular places within it. What makes their
case particularly interesting, though, is the added dimension of timing. Cos
mic harmony is preserved by being in the right place at the right time and

performing the appropriate rites. The terrestrial world is connected to the
spirit world both in space and time, and the key to this connection is the sky.
Not only are places in the landscape associated with particular asterisms, but
the time to be there is prescribed by reference to the sun’s passage through
the stars. This connection between the terrestrial and the spiritual also has
the pragmatic effect (from a Western perspective) of making sure that the
buffalo can be successfully hunted. But for the Lakota, the buffalo are not
simply a resource to be exploited. They are part of the whole circle of life,
who say “take my flesh with gratitude” (Chamberlain et al. 2005, p. 145),
and humans have to return this gift by doing all they can to preserve the cos
mic order.

Land of the Rising Sun
In modern Japan, ancient traditions coexist with the many emanations of
modern Western culture. In centuries past, too, Japanese culture continually
absorbed influences from abroad—namely from mainland Asia—and yet
retained a distinct identity. Even the Japanese language, when it was first
written down in the middle of the first millennium C.E., used kanji charac
ters imported from the Chinese.
For a millennium and a half, from the fourth century until the end of
World War II, the principles of Shinto religion forged unbreakable links be
tween cosmology, political structure, and the sun. Successive emperors
traced their ancestry directly back to the Sun Goddess, helping to forge a na
tional identity linked with the sun that is still evident in the national flag.
Shinto persisted despite the strong influence of Buddhist traditions from
China that have coexisted in this island nation from the sixth century on
wards. This coexistence involved some remarkable compromises, for in
stance, in locating and aligning temples and palaces. In the Shinto tradition
Land of the Rising Sun 221
Pure Mathematical Physics



this would be done with respect to places of spiritual power in the landscape,
whereas in the Chinese tradition they would typically be aligned cardinally,
reflecting the principle that spiritual and imperial power derived from the
north celestial pole as the pivot of the heavens, and ensuring that the em
peror would be approached, like the celestial pole itself, from the south. The
plan of ancient Kyoto, for example, built in C.E. 794, with its palace com
plex approached from due south, reflected such principles every bit as faith
fully as Beijing itself.
Aside from institutionalized astronomy, elements of star lore and folk
calendars have been transmitted through countless generations of ordinary
people, and some have persisted in rural areas despite the introduction of the
Gregorian calendar. For example, the changing patterns of appearance of the
Pleiades (Subaru), Hyades, and Orion’s belt provided a succession of seasonal
rules of thumb for rice farmers. One of these was that when Subaru—which
resembled a collection of rice seedlings—set progressively earlier in the
evening sky in the spring, this indicated the time for planting the actual rice
seeds in the ground.
Archaeoastronomy is in its infancy in Japan. The Asuka plain, to the
east of Osaka, contains several tombs (kofun) of high-status individuals that
were erected in the seventh and early eighth centuries. Two of them, only
about a kilometer (half mile) apart—Takamatsu Zuka Kofun, excavated in
1972, and Kitora Kofun, probed in 1998 using a miniature camera—contain
paintings with strong astronomical associations. The ceilings depict the
twenty-eight lunar “mansions” (known in Japan as shuku) and other con
stellations, while the walls show the animal gods associated with each of the
cardinal directions. The two tombs demonstrate clear but nonetheless dif
ferent Chinese and Korean influences. The region also contains a number of
granite megaliths carved in the shape of human figures. These are of uncer
tain origin, date, and purpose, and while some have attracted archaeoastro
nomical interest, interpretations are far more speculative.

Landscape
People in the past ordered the world of their experience, defining places
within it and pathways through it, and in that way came to understand and
control it. Vital as it was to exploit natural resources to the full in order to
subsist, human activity in relation to the landscape was often structured ac
cording to symbolic or cosmological principles, forming what are known to
archaeologists as ritual landscapes or sacred geographies. Examples of sa
cred geographies are many and varied among both historically recorded
and modern indigenous peoples.
As is still the case for many indigenous peoples today, places may have
become imbued with sacred or mystical significance because of their position
within the landscape, as with the summits of high hills; because of the pres
ence of prominent landmarks, such as caves, watering holes, or distinctive
natural rocks; or because of remembered events that happened there. Some
of these places may have been used for the construction of shrines or monu
ments, and others may have assumed sacred significance precisely because
earlier constructions were built there. Sacred significance may be attached to
lines and paths as well as particular places. For the inhabitants of the Hopi
village of Walpi, the directions of sunrise and sunset at the solstices are them
selves sacred, so that four sacred lines radiate out through the landscape
from the village to the horizon. This configuration represents a very direct
and obvious connection between the landscape and the sky, and also a rela
tionship between space and time, in that each line is empowered by the ac
tual occurrence of sunrise or sunset on the appropriate day.
Patterns of movement through the landscape may be vitally important
as a way of reinforcing a group’s understanding of the structure of the world
and their place within it. Thus the Lakota people of South Dakota associate
certain constellations with specific landmarks within the Black Hills. In ac
cordance with their oral tradition, they undertake an annual progression
through those hills that is understood to be related to, and seen to be in tune
with, the path of the sun through the constellations. The Lakota example
also illustrates how the needs of the sacred and the mundane—or, as we
might see it, of ideology and pragmatism—need not necessarily be mutually
exclusive or in conflict. The cycle of seasonal movements ensures that the
Lakota follow the movements of the buffalo, a vital food source that they
also saw as the very embodiment of the power of the sun.
Landscape 223
Pure Mathematical Physics



The Lakota example also illustrates that no discussion of sacred land
scapes is likely to be complete without a consideration of the sky. As soon as
we start to think about how people perceived and conceived the world, and
as soon as we start examining evidence of human action shaped by and un
dertaken in accordance with such perceptions, then we need to consider not
only the land and sea but the totality of the visible environment within which
those people lived. That includes the sky.

Ley Lines
In 1921, so the story goes, businessman Alfred Watkins had a revelation.
Standing on a hillside in Herefordshire, England, overlooking an expanse
of rural countryside containing a number of ancient features, he noticed
that many of them seemed to lie on straight lines. A subsequent examina
tion of Ordnance Survey maps revealed the apparent existence of numer
ous ancient straight trackways that formed a network of intersecting
straight lines stretching from one end of Britain to the other, with ancient
sites of various ages situated along them. Noticing that many of the track
ways passed through places whose names contained the syllable ley,
Watkins concluded that the word ley referred to the trackways themselves
and named them ley lines. Drawing on the earlier astronomical work of Sir
Norman Lockyer, he also concluded that some of the lines were oriented
in the directions of sunrise and sunset at the solstices. By the following year
he had published his first book, Early British Trackways; its sequel, The
224 Ley Lines
Pure Mathematical Physics



Old Straight Track, published in 1925, attracted a wide following from a
fascinated public.
Professional archaeologists, however, were highly skeptical. The idea
that the whole of Britain could have been mapped out single-mindedly in
prehistoric times seemed to them inherently unreasonable, and there seemed
little in the way of hard evidence to support the theory. For a start, the sug
gested etymology of the term ley as referring to ancient tracks was highly
questionable. More crucially, the ancient sites taken to define the lines were
of widely different ages and types, and marker points actually included nat
ural features such as large stones, trees, ponds, and mountain peaks. Fur
thermore, large numbers of equally plausible ancient sites and natural
places did not lie on any of the proposed lines. We must ask the question:
how easy is it, given a scatter of effectively random locations, to find
straight lines joining some of them? It is possible to give a mathematical an
swer, but the informal answer is clear: surprisingly easy. The excavator of
Stonehenge, Richard Atkinson, once demonstrated this using the locations
of telephone boxes, which no one could argue had been laid out deliberately
in straight lines, finding several convincing “telephone box leys.” As to the
question of the different ages of the sites forming supposed marker points,
Watkins and his followers argued that newer buildings such as churches
must have been constructed on the site of older markers. However, in most
cases there was little or no independent evidence to support this, and in
some cases the archaeological evidence stood in flagrant contradiction to
the theory. A notorious example is a ley line joining Stonehenge (third mil
lennium B.C.E.), Old Sarum (first millennium B.C.E.), and Salisbury cathedral
(C.E. 1220) in Wiltshire. The site for Salisbury cathedral was on virgin
marshland, actually chosen because a preferred site, several kilometers to
the west, could not be secured.
Curiously, unbeknownst to Watkins and his followers in the 1920s, a
similar idea had been developed in Germany around the same time, claim
ing that sacred places in that country were linked by Heilige Linien (“Holy
lines”). This theory came, infamously, to be used in support of the Nazi po
litical agenda. Back in Britain after the 1920s, though, ley lines soon faded
into obscurity and would have been long forgotten but for their reemergence
in the 1960s in a new guise. Watkins believed that his trackways were con
structed by prehistoric surveyors physically sighting from one place to an
other, but the ley lines of the 1960s were conceived as lines of power, the
paths of some form of spiritual force or energy accessible to our ancient an
cestors but now lost to narrow-minded twentieth-century scientific thought.
Public interest in ley lines mushroomed, and “ley hunting” became a hugely
popular pastime, largely because someone with no professional training
whatsoever could feel directly involved in the process of rediscovering the
Ley Lines 225
Pure Mathematical Physics



magical landscapes of the past. All that was required was an open mind, the
energy to walk about in the landscape seeking potential sacred places, and
the ability to feel the spiritual forces.
The dangerous aspect of this approach is that it abandons all attempts
to examine the evidence objectively—to be scientific in any broad sense. The
existence of the lines of force had to be accepted as an article of faith, to be
backed up by subjective discoveries. Very few archaeologists bothered to
waste their time on a topic that seemed to them a complete fiction, but this
just served to confirm to the ley liners that the academics were both narrow
minded and arrogant. Meanwhile ley hunting spawned journals and books,
sub-fields, experts, and doctrinal disputes; in short, it developed all the trap
pings of an alternative discipline, arrayed in competition against the aca
demic establishment. The irony is that the ley hunters found themselves
adopting the very paraphernalia of science that most of them were arguing
so vociferously against.
For the most part, ley lines represent an unhappy episode now con
signed to history. Yet humans do tend to construct lines in the landscape,
conceptual or actual, a practice that has emerged in some human societies in
the past. The best-known example is that of the Inca ceques, conceptually
(though not actually) straight lines radiating out from the capital, Cusco,
throughout the entire Inca empire. Sacred sites and places, huacas, lay on the
ceques. There is even evidence that a few ceques (though by no means all)
were oriented astronomically. In cases such as this we may wonder how an
cient people perceived these lines, and whether in their minds they may in
deed have been the loci of sacred power. In doing so, we may find ourselves,
as anthropologists, investigating an innate human desire to discern, and
hence to try to reinforce, a structure in the landscape that we can under
stand. The ley line phenomenon, at least in its later manifestation, may rep
resent a more modern manifestation of this same innate desire.

many years the editor of the scientific journal Nature. In later life Lockyer
became fascinated by possible solar and stellar alignments at Egyptian tem
ples and surveyed several of them, publishing his results in 1894 in a book
entitled The Dawn of Astronomy. He was responsible for the idea that
some temples were carefully designed so that a beam of light from the sun,
or possibly a bright star, would shine down a long narrow passage, illumi
nating a dark sanctuary in the interior on particular days. This idea would
be applied more generally in very different contexts in later times, one of its
most famous manifestations being at Newgrange in Ireland. Later Lockyer
turned his attention to his native Britain, surveying several dozen megalithic
monuments all over the British Isles and publishing the results in 1906 un

Lunar and Luni-Solar Calendars
One lunar phase cycle, also known as a lunation or a synodic month, is
completed on average every 29.53 days. It is one of the most obvious of all
the celestial cycles and has formed the fundamental basis for reckoning time
in a wide range of human communities to the present day. Recognition of
the lunar phase cycle may extend well back into Palaeolithic times: mark
ings on the 30,000-year-old Abri Blanchard bone have been identified as a
possible lunar calendar. Yet the lunar phase cycle remains at the heart of
some of the world’s great calendar systems, including both the Jewish and
Islamic calendars.
In the great majority of lunar calendars, the new month is taken to start
following the new moon, with the first appearance of the thin crescent just
after sunset. This particular point in the cycle is chosen because it is a clearly
definable event; but even so there can be problems. Among the Mursi of
southwestern Ethiopia, there is often disagreement as to whether the moon
was really seen or not by someone who claims to have done so. Problems
228 Lunar and Luni-Solar Calendars
Pure Mathematical Physics



also arise if a critical evening is cloudy, and they are compounded if a single
calendar needs to be consistently adopted over a wider area. The Islamic
world faced this problem at an early stage, and at first Muslim astronomers
used technical criteria to determine the theoretical visibility of the new
moon. Nowadays an institutionalized algorithm is more widely adopted, in
which the length of successive months alternates between twenty-nine and
thirty days. However, it is still necessary to modify this from time to time.
In many calendars, each day in the month is given a name. The Greeks
divided the month into three periods of ten days known as decades, while
other cultures simply distinguish between the waxing and waning halves. A
variety of portents may be associated with the particular days or periods in
the cycle. One of the most intricate examples of this is the Hawaiian ritual
calendar, in which each month contains a number of taboo periods. Lunar
prognostications also live on in folk traditions in various parts of the world.
Problems occur as soon as any attempt is made to keep a lunar calen
dar in step with the seasonal year. Whether the number of months in a year
is taken to be twelve or thirteen, the calendar will drift out of step with the
seasons by more than a full month in only two or three years. Some lunar
calendars, such as the Islamic calendar, simply proceed independently of the
seasonal year. This calendar comprises twelve months and lasts 354 days, so
that the start of each year moves back by eleven or twelve days in relation
to the seasons. Thus, in 1994 the Islamic New Year occurred on June 11,
while in 2004 it occurred on February 22.
Calendars that are based on the cycle of the lunar phases but take ac
count of the seasonal (solar) year are known as luni-solar. In these calendars,
a month is periodically added or subtracted, a process known as intercala
tion. It is not necessary to do this formally: the Mursi manage it through a
process of institutionalized disagreement and retrospective correction. Gen
erally, however, wherever people do need to know what month it is at any
given time, definite procedures are required that determine the insertion or
omission of an intercalary month.
One way is to incorporate other forms of astronomical observation that
are directly linked to the seasonal year. Among the most common are the ap
pearance and disappearance of certain stars or constellations in the dawn
and dusk sky, known technically as their heliacal and acronical rise and set.
Early ancient Egyptians, for example, used the heliacal rise of Sirius, which
coincided with the beginning of the flood of the Nile, to decide whether to
insert an intercalary month before the start of the new year. The Hawaiians
and other Polynesians used the heliacal or sometimes the acronical rising of
the Pleiades in similar ways. In ancient Greece, the practice of directly link
ing star appearances and disappearances with seasonal events or actions was
documented as far back as the eighth century B.C.E. in the farmers’ almanac
Lunar and Luni-Solar Calendars 229
Pure Mathematical Physics



written by Hesiod, and it may have preceded the development of lunar cal
endars. Certainly, star calendars, or parapegmata, existed by the fifth cen
tury B.C.E. These were stone tablets used like pegboards for tracking the 365
days in the year, and many of them were annotated with star configurations
for each day. By this time lunar calendars existed too, and parapegmata
could have provided any number of reference points—appropriate star ob
servations—for keeping a lunar calendar in step with the seasonal year.
A different intercalation method came to light in Greece in the fifth cen
tury B.C.E. It emerged from a centuries-old Babylonian tradition that com
bined meticulous observation and recording with complex arithmetical cal
culations. The discovery was that adding seven intercalary months in every
nineteen years kept a lunar calendar accurately in step with the seasonal year.
The error is less than a fifth of a day in each cycle—just over a day in a cen
tury. This idea was propagated in Greece by Meton and bears his name—the
Metonic cycle. The significance of the Metonic cycle is that it paved the way
for empirical practices to be replaced by a set of mechanical rules. This de
velopment epitomizes the move toward a logical and mathematical way of
understanding nature, and toward an abstract concept of time, which devel
oped in ancient Greece and prevails in the Western world today.
Ironically, it is not clear that Meton’s scheme caught on widely, and
empirical intercalation schemes may have persisted in many Greek cities.
Even more crude and subjective schemes of intercalation persisted in the
Roman world, but the schemes became so dogged by political interference
that the calendar got more than three months out of step with the seasonal
year before it was eventually replaced in the Roman world by the solar
based Julian calendar.

pen—about once every sixth lunation—the moon passes through the earth’s
shadow (umbra). At such times an astronaut on the moon would see the
earth passing across in front of the sun—a rather different experience from
seeing a solar eclipse from the earth, since the earth’s disc would appear
about four times the size of the sun’s.
The situation is actually more complicated than this example suggests,
because the earth’s shadow has an inner cone (the umbra) and an outer part
called the penumbra. If our astronaut on the moon stood within the penum
bra, he or she would see the equivalent of a partial solar eclipse. But if he or
she stood within the umbra, the earth’s disc could entirely cover the sun.
Around the disc an eerie glow would be visible—orange, reddish, or
brown—due to sunlight reflected in the earth’s cloudy, dusty atmosphere.
But how does this appear from the earth? If the moon passes through
the penumbra but misses the umbra—a so-called penumbral eclipse—then
the moon’s disc is slightly dimmed and the eclipse passes unnoticed to the
naked eye. Such eclipses have no cultural impact and can be ignored. Um
bral eclipses may themselves be partial or total, depending whether the en
tire moon passes into the umbra.
Lunar umbral eclipses, unlike solar ones, can be seen (weather permit
ting) from approximately half of the earth: from all places where the sun is
below the horizon, it is night, and the moon—opposite to it in the sky—is
up and visible. During a partial lunar eclipse—as well as in the stages lead
ing up to a total one—part of the moon is in the earth’s shadow and is dark.
Sometimes a partially eclipsed moon could be mistaken for a normal cres
cent moon except that it is in the wrong position in the sky and, to the dis
cerning eye its appearance is odd—the crescent may be at an unusual angle
and have an odd shape. A total lunar eclipse, however, can be truly spectac
ular. As soon as no bright part remains to overpower the rest, the whole lu
nar disc reappears but now glows dimly with a deep red, brown, or orange
color. “Totality” can last as long as one and three-quarter hours.
For modern city dwellers it is easy to miss even a total lunar eclipse, and
for this reason we are inclined to think that for ancient peoples the social im
pact of a total solar eclipse—a truly rare event transforming day into night
would have been far greater. Yet anyone who relies upon the moon to illu
minate a dark night or as the basis of their calendar regulating seasonal,
subsistence, and ritual activities may be alarmed to watch the full moon be
ing “eaten” away and then totally consumed. And such events are not rare:
given clear skies and someone to wake us up when it happens, we would ex
pect to see roughly one total lunar eclipse every three years on average.
To many peoples in the past, then, an eclipse of the moon was just as
ominous, potentially frightening, and even calamitous, as a total solar
eclipse. The Aztecs, certainly, were every bit as terrified of a lunar eclipse as
Lunar Eclipses 231

of a solar one, as we know from the writings of the chronicler Fray
Bernardino de Sahagún: when the moon’s face darkened, women feared that
their unborn children would be born lipless, noseless, or cross-eyed, or
turned into mice. Maya, ancient and historical, variously saw the moon as
being attacked, bitten, or eaten, and hence sick or dying, just as they saw the
sun during a solar eclipse. The impression of the moon literally being eaten
is reinforced by its blood-red color at the time of totality. Indeed, the moon
being turned into blood was a common metaphor in medieval European
chronicles.
The blood-red color was also taken as a portent of death. The Anglo
Saxon Chronicles record that in C.E. 734 the moon was as though drenched
with blood; this lunar eclipse was taken to presage the death of the Venera
ble Bede in the following year. Similarly, it has been supposed that a
prophecy that the moon would “turn to blood” at the crucifixion of Christ
might refer to a lunar eclipse (although this is highly questionable). Lunar
eclipses were certainly taken very widely as a bad omen. An unexpected lu
nar eclipse in 413 B.C.E., for example, led the Athenian forces to postpone
their departure from Syracuse, which they had held under siege for two years
during the Peloponnesian war. This delay resulted in total military defeat. Al
most a millennium later, in C.E. 549, two Teutonic armies were preparing to
wage battle in the Carpathian basin. It was nighttime. In their two camps,
close but out of sight of each other, the chieftains and escorts on each side
were likely drunk in their tents. Without warning, the soldiers of both
armies—quite independently—simply fled from their camps, leaving their
superiors with no choice but to conclude an armistice. The reason, it seems,
was a total lunar eclipse.
The Maori had a less calamitous view. According to Maori myth, a
woman named Rona was snatched up by the moon after insulting it when it
disappeared behind a cloud while she was trying to fetch water at night.
Rona can still be seen in the face of the moon. During a lunar eclipse, Rona
was attacking the moon and trying to destroy it. The result of the conflict,
however, was far from calamitous: the moon ultimately returned reinvigo
rated, young and beautiful.
Once people began to keep systematic records, the possibility emerged
of predicting lunar eclipses. Since they can only occur at full moon, the chal
lenge is to predict which full moons are the mostly likely candidates. There
are a variety of cycles that, once recognized, provide the means to do this at
various levels of reliability. The simplest in the short term involves regular
counting in sixes and fives: if a lunar eclipse occurs in month zero, then an
other is most likely in months six, twelve, eighteen, etc.; might happen in
months five, eleven, seventeen, etc.; but cannot happen in any other month.
The best-known longer-term cycle is the so-called Saros cycle of eighteen

years and eleven days (223 lunations) discovered by the Babylonians, but the
Chinese used one of ten years and 334 days (135 lunations), and the Maya
recognized one of thirty-two years and 272 days (405 lunations), a time pe
riod commensurate with their 260-day sacred calendar round known as the
tzolkin (405 lunations = 46 tzolkins to within a fraction of a day). None of
these cycles is failsafe, however. Some of the predicted eclipses will only be
partial, and some may occur but not be visible because they happen during
daylight. Those that occur high in the sky in the middle of the night, and last
longest, will be the most conspicuous.
For many ancient peoples, the motivation for systematic astronomical
observations—initially, at least—was divinatory. Thus ancient Chinese
records of lunar eclipses date back to the Shang dynasty in the second half
of the second millennium B.C.E., when they were recorded—together with as
sociated prognostications and verifications—on turtle shells and animal
bones that have become known as oracle bones. However, as lunar eclipses
became more predictable, around the year 0 and beyond, they began to lose
their significance as portents and to fall into the domain of calendrics. They
simply became part of the framework of regular and reliable events whose
cycles could be calculated using careful record-keeping and mathematics.
(Solar eclipses, in contrast, remained unpredictable and so continued to be
regarded as bad omens.) The Maya, on the other hand, seem to have been
obsessed with establishing exact numerical relationships between natural
and entirely manmade cycles, and in particular with the 260-day tzolkin.
Each day of this sacred round had particular characteristics that were cru
cial in fixing rituals and making prognostications. In complete contrast to
the ancient Chinese, the desire to incorporate what were effectively astro
logical considerations into their calendar drove the Maya to ever greater lev
els of astronomical achievement.

Lunar Parallax
We use modern astronomy to determine the appearance of the sky in dif
ferent parts of the world at different times in the past. The formulae we use
are derived from mathematical models of the motions of the earth through
space, as it orbits around the sun, spinning and wobbling under the gravi
tational influences of the sun and moon. One consequence of this is that
when we use standard formulae to calculate the declination of a celestial
body or event, we implicitly make the assumption that we are standing at
the center of the earth. Although this sounds crazy, the distances of most ce
lestial objects are so vast that it makes no practical difference to the ar
chaeoastronomer studying naked-eye observations of the skies in the past.
Only in the case of the moon is the difference important.
The lunar parallax is the difference between the position of the moon
in the sky as viewed (theoretically) from the center of the earth and (actu
ally) from somewhere on the earth’s surface. If we are interested in the pos
sibility of lunar alignments of a precision much greater than the size of the
moon (about thirty arc minutes across), then we must take parallax into ac
count. There are two ways of doing this. The usual way, which is adequate
in most cases, is to adjust the “target” declination values that correspond to
various lunar events, such as the moonrise or moonset at the major stand
still limits. However, if we are interested, as was Alexander Thom, in possi
ble alignments of very high precision—precise to a just few minutes of arc
then we must take account of the fact that the parallax correction varies
slightly from place to place and from time to time. We can only do this by
increasing by an appropriate amount, different in each case, the altitude of
any given horizon point, and hence of the moon if it were rising or setting
behind that point, in order to calculate where it would be seen in the sky,
234 Lunar Parallax
Pure Mathematical Physics



and hence what its declination would be if we were standing at the earth’s
center. The corrected declination, which can now be compared directly with
the target declination, is known as the geocentric lunar declination.

Lunar Phase Cycle
The changing phases of the moon form the most obvious regular cycle of
events in the night sky. This phase cycle of the moon, known by as
tronomers as the synodic month and also as a lunation, is between twenty
nine and thirty days long. The details depend upon the viewer’s latitude on
earth, the time of year, and upon the timing in relation to certain longer
term cycles of the moon, but generally the phase cycle adheres to the fol
lowing pattern. After a period of no more than a few days when the moon
is not seen at all, a thin crescent moon is seen low in the western sky just
after sunset, following the sun downward. During the next few nights, the
moon grows in phase night by night and also appears higher in the western
sky night by night, taking longer until it sets. By the time half phase is
reached, also known confusingly as first quarter, since this is a quarter of
the way through the cycle, the moon appears close to the north-south
meridian at dusk and sets approximately halfway through the night. Dur
ing the next seven days it becomes gibbous. It now appears in the eastern
sky at dusk, or may even be visible before dusk, taking most of the night to
pass at first across the meridian and then set in the west in the early hours.
Finally, the moon becomes full. The full moon rises around dusk and sets
around dawn. Then, during the next seven days, while it decreases back to
half phase, it rises progressively later each night and is still high in the west
ern sky at dawn. By the time half phase (third quarter) is reached, it rises
approximately halfway through the night and reaches the meridian around
dawn. Then finally, as it diminishes back to a crescent, it rises progressively
later and later, getting less and less far up into the eastern sky by dawn, un
til finally the thin crescent is seen only briefly just before sunrise.
The lunar phase cycle is likely to have been recognized by human com
munities well back into Palaeolithic times. One obvious practical conse
quence of the changing lunar phases is that at certain times in the month one
can see to travel about at night, when hunting, for example. Seafaring com
munities could also become aware that the appearance of the moon is related
Lunar Phase Cycle 235
Pure Mathematical Physics



to the tides. The fact that the length of the phase cycle is close to that of the
female menstrual cycle has led to controversial suggestions that groups of
women in hunter-gatherer communities would tend to synchronize their
menstrual periods not only with one another but also with the phases of the
moon. This, alongside the other effects, could lead to the regulation of food
gathering, fishing, hunting, cooking, feasting, and sexual activity—all in ac
cordance with the moon. And this cycle, in turn, would eventually become
“institutionalized,” reinforced through ritual practices and taboos related to
the lunar phases, and encapsulated in myth. Although this sequence of events
is speculative, examples abound of the influence of the lunar cycles on hu
man activity. Indigenous peoples in the historical and modern world often
tied ritual practices to the phases of the moon (the Hawaiian calendar is just
one example), and many folk practices and beliefs relate to the lunar phase
cycle, such as those found in the Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia.

Maes Howe
The gently rolling landscape of the Orkney Islands, north of mainland
Scotland, is home to a wealth of prehistoric monuments, few more impres
sive than the great passage tomb at Maes Howe. Probably built around
3000 B.C.E., it is the largest of its type in Scotland. Its dome-shaped mound
is estimated to have been some 38 meters (125 feet) across and about eight
meters (26 feet) high, and its huge central chamber, cruciform in shape and
over 4.5 meters (15 feet) across in each direction, was probably more than
4 meters (13 feet) high originally. This was reached via a low passage over
15 meters (50 feet) long, which enters the mound from the southwest.
The passage at Maes Howe is aligned so that the light of the setting sun
on the shortest day of the year shines along its entire length and onto the
back wall of the main chamber. However, this solstitial alignment is far from
exact. A similar phenomenon occurs daily from more than a month before
the solstice until more than a month after it, and the same would have been
true in prehistory. In fact, a most impressive light phenomenon occurs about
twenty-one days (twenty-two to twenty-three days when the tomb was
built) before and after the solstice. On these days the sun, having set behind
the top of Ward Hill, on the adjacent island of Hoy, reappears briefly to the
side of the hill a few minutes later, suddenly striking the back of the cham
ber for a second time.
Archaeologist Euan MacKie has argued that the tomb was not poorly
aligned upon the solstice but very precisely aligned upon the sun’s setting
position twenty-two or twenty-three days before and after it. These dates,
argued MacKie, were significant because they represented “epoch dates” in
a calendar that divided the year into exactly sixteen equal parts of (on av
erage) 22.8 days each. The existence of such a calendar in Neolithic Britain
had been argued by the engineer Alexander Thom on the basis of a variety
of supposed alignments at different megalithic monuments. However, it has
subsequently been shown that if the data are selected fairly, there is no con
vincing evidence to support it. This fact, quite apart from a number of other
237
M
Pure Mathematical Physics



arguments, undermines the calendrical interpretation of Maes Howe.
On the other hand, it remains possible that the imprecise solstitial
alignment was deliberate, and comparisons have inevitably been made be
tween Maes Howe and the Irish passage tomb of Newgrange, which is also
aligned upon the midwinter solstitial sun, though at sunrise rather than sun
set. However, Maes Howe lacks anything like the famous “roof-box” that
distinguishes Newgrange, and which allowed the sun to shine into that tomb
even after the entrance had been blocked off. The entrance at Maes Howe
was blocked off too, admittedly using a stone that was too short, and some
have argued that this was to permit the continued entry of sunlight for a sim
ilar purpose, but this argument is controversial. And the alignment at Maes
Howe is even less precise than that at Newgrange. Yet the fact that the align
ment was imprecise does not mean that the tomb was badly constructed or
unfit for its purpose. Some, indeed, have argued that the vagaries of the
Orkney weather would have made this imprecision a necessity.
Yet to dwell too long on the precision of the alignment, or the actual
interplay of sunlight within the tomb at or dates close to the solstice, may be
missing the point. We may learn more of the purpose and meaning of the ori
entation of Maes Howe tomb by examining the archaeology of the living.

The Orkney Islands are rare in that they contain evidence of Neolithic set
tlements. One of these is the famous village at Skara Brae, with its stone
houses huddled together as protection against the winds and weather, some
containing still-visible central hearths and dressers made of stone. In the
1980s, excavations commenced at a newly discovered village at Barnhouse,
only about one kilometer (one-half mile) from Maes Howe. They revealed a
number of houses, cruciform in shape like the Maes Howe chamber, includ
ing a particularly large one remarkably similar in form to the nearby tomb.
This discovery reinforces the oft-made suggestion that the design of tombs
houses for the dead—reflected that of houses for the living. One aspect of
design is orientation, and tombs may well have echoed orientation practices
common among houses for the living. In this way they did not only reflect
what we would consider “practical” considerations; they also reflected prin
ciples that were symbolic or cosmological, though of no less importance to
their builders. Such principles still operate among a number of modern in
digenous peoples, good examples being the Navajo and Pawnee in the
United States.
Neolithic houses in Orkney are characterized by a remarkable consis
tency in their spatial arrangement. A square hearth is always located in the
center, a stone dresser is always found against the wall opposite the door,
and rectangular stone boxes, generally assumed to be beds, were placed
against the side walls. This uniformity provides ample evidence that activi
ties in these houses were, indeed, governed and strongly constrained by a
consistent set of ordering principles. These principles no doubt derived from
how people perceived and understood the world, and served in their minds
to keep everyday life in tune with the cosmos.
Studies of the orientations of houses at Barnhouse, together with other
Neolithic villages in Orkney, show a marked preference for entrances in the
southeast. Given other similarities between houses for the living and houses
for the dead, it comes as little surprise that the many chambered tombs in
the area were oriented in the same direction, Maes Howe itself being an ex
ception. However, in many cases, the only indication of the orientation of an
excavated house is the orientation of the hearth, since all other features have
disappeared. We can extrapolate the orientations of the walls, but we can
not tell which wall contained the entrance. When studied systematically, the
hearth orientations—and hence the wall-directions—cluster broadly but
quite unequivocally around the intercardinal directions; the cardinal direc
tions themselves were avoided. The four wall-directions also cluster around
the directions of sunrise and sunset at the solstices and may have been in
tended to be oriented upon them, but this is uncertain. It is clear, though,
that one of the basic ordering principles of the cosmos, which constrained
the orientation of houses and, by extrapolation, tombs, was a quartering de
Maes Howe 239
Pure Mathematical Physics



marcated by the cardinal directions. This quartering recalls the quadripartite
cosmologies common among indigenous American peoples such as the
Navajo and Pawnee.
Given this context, the solstitial alignment at Maes Howe should surely
be interpreted not as an indicator of an illusory prehistoric calendar of sup
posed remarkable precision, but in a more modest way, as a particularly fine
reflection of prevailing views of the cosmos.

Magellanic Clouds
The two Magellanic Clouds are the most extensive patches of fuzzy light
(nebulae) in the sky, apart from the Milky Way itself, and can be seen from
the southern hemisphere and tropics. Where the Milky Way sweeps past the
south celestial pole, they are seen on the opposite side of the pole, the Small
(or Lesser) Magellanic Cloud (SMC) more or less directly across from the
Southern Cross, and the Large (or Greater) Magellanic Cloud (LMC) off to
one side. Most of the LMC falls within the southern constellation of Do
rado (the “goldfish”—or more strictly, the Hawaiian mahi-mahi). When the
Southern Cross, which is within the Milky Way, appears high in the sky
above the pole, the SMC will be seen close to the horizon below the pole,
with the LMC over to its right, looking like detached pieces of the Milky
Way itself. As nights progress, the Milky Way and the two Magellenic
Clouds, together with all the individual stars and other objects in the sky,
swing round the pole, just as the Great and Little Bear (Ursa Major and
240 Magellanic Clouds
Pure Mathematical Physics



Ursa Minor) and other stars do in the north, but in the opposite direction
(i.e., clockwise).
The Magellanic Clouds are actually great clumps of stars, or dwarf
galaxies, satellite appendages to our own large galaxy (the Milky Way). Each
contains hundreds of millions of stars, but this is only a small fraction of the
number of stars contained in the Milky Way itself.
Not surprisingly given their visual prominence in southern skies, the
Magellanic Clouds frequently feature in southern-hemisphere cosmologies
and myths. A number of different stories have been recorded among Aus
tralian Aboriginals. To one group in Arnhem Land, toward the northern tip
of Northern Territory, Australia, the Magellanic Clouds represent the homes
of two sisters. When only the SMC is visible, it is said that the elder of the
two, who dwells in the LMC, journeys away. Her younger sister eventually
persuades her to return in the wet season, when they can go out together to
collect yams. They were also widely recognized in ancient Polynesia: to the
ancient Hawaiians, for example, they were “white butterfly” and “dark but
terfly.” One story among the Khoisan bush-peoples of southwestern Africa
starts with the culture hero =Gao (the = symbol represents a palatal click, or
the sound made when the tongue is pressed against the roof of the mouth
and then quickly removed) standing on the LMC, looking around for game
to hunt. He eventually spots three zebras (Orion’s belt) but his arrow
(Orion’s sword), aimed at the middle one, falls short.
One could continue to recount such stories, but these three examples
alone are sufficient to demonstrate the diverse ways in which different peo
ples can perceive the same objects in the skies, each colored by their own
earthly environment and subsistence practices.

Mangareva
Mangareva is the largest of the Gambier Islands at the southeastern corner
of French Polynesia. South of this group lies nothing but clear ocean all the
way to Antarctica. To the east lie just four small and scattered islands in the
Pitcairn group, and then well over 2,000 kilometers (1,400 miles) beyond
those, the remote Rapa Nui (Easter Island), the most isolated outpost of an
cient Polynesia. In 1834, a Belgian priest by the name of Honoré Laval be
Mangareva 241

gan working as a missionary on Mangareva. He remained on the island for
almost four decades and compiled a detailed account of the indigenous peo
ples. Ironically, their traditional religious practices were simultaneously being
relentlessly destroyed in the missionary zeal to convert them to Catholicism.
Laval describes the use of two tall, dressed stones set up side by side on
a small mountain, for determining the solstice. When the sun rose between
them, a “learned person” called Akaputu, seated on a flat stone in the mid
dle of the village, announced that the sun had reached its resting place. The
anthropologist and Maori scholar Sir Peter Buck (Te Rangi Hiroa), who vis
ited the island a century later, coincidentally published his Ethnology of
Mangareva in the same year Laval’s account, which had languished in mis
sionary archives in Belgium, was finally brought to publication. Buck docu
ments four separate places where observations were made of the northern
and southern limits of the course of the sun along the horizon. The place of
observation, in one case at least, was a flat rock or stone on which the priest
sat. From vantages close to the east coast, the changing rising position of the
sun could be tracked against various islets visible on the reef to the east. Else
where, people took advantage of other foresights, such as natural landmarks
on mountain ridges, and sometimes used the setting rather than the rising
sun. In another case, the focus of attention was the shadow of a mountain
at sunset: when this reached a certain stone, the winter (June) solstice had
arrived. The practice of placing a pair of stones on the horizon to mark the
limiting rising or setting position of the sun with maximum precision seems
to have represented the culmination of this widespread tradition.
Archaeological and archaeoastronomical work by the American an
thropologist Patrick Kirch has recently established, beyond any reasonable
doubt, the location of one platform used to make solstitial observations as
recorded by Laval. The platform at Atituiti Ruga is about twenty-three me
ters (seventy-five feet) square and contains a large, flat boulder at its center.
From here, sunrise on summer (December) solstice was observed over
Agakauitai, an island in the outer barrier reef that is visible on the sea hori
zon to the east. The shadow of the eastern peak of Auorotini (Mount Duff),
which towers over the site to the north, passed across the platform shortly
after local noon on the winter (June) solstice.
Why was it important to keep track of the sun? One possibility is that
the solstices were used to mark the start of the new season or the new year. A
side benefit of this would be to keep the calendar in phase with the seasons.
The Mangarevan calendar had much in common with the calendars of most
of the rest of Polynesia: it was a lunar calendar based on the phase cycle of
the moon, days within the month were reckoned by nights of the moon, and
it used month and day names of which variants appear more widely. As is the
case with all lunar calendars, it would have been necessary to insert an inter
242 Mangareva
Pure Mathematical Physics



calary month from time to time in order to keep the months in step with the
seasons. Making observations of the solstices would be one way to do this.
However, even though the calendar is of a type familiar through Poly
nesia, clear evidence of careful observations of the solstices is nonexistent
elsewhere, except for hints in Hawai‘i. This raises the question: did a par
ticular concern with the annual motions of the sun happen to develop in
Mangareva but not in other places, or was it a wider Polynesian preoccu
pation that just happens to have survived long enough in this island to be
reliably recorded?

Maya Long Count
The Maya were the most enduring of the Mesoamerican civilizations. The
origins of Maya society can be traced back to at least 400 B.C.E. in the low
lands of the Yucatan peninsula, when existing small villages—which, in the
dry north, were built close to cenotes, sink holes full of vital water formed
by the collapse of underground caves—started to develop into more sprawl
ing towns with monumental structures at their centers. This process accel
erated, with social elites beginning to gain power, during what is known as
the Late Preclassic, or Late Formative, period, which lasted until about C.E.
250. In the Classic period that followed, the political structure of the Maya
lowlands developed into a patchwork of city states—anywhere from about
twenty-five to about sixty of them at different times—creating a continually
shifting network of wars and alliances. Each political center was also a re
ligious one, with ceremonial buildings and pyramids surrounding a large
central plaza. But the ninth century brought change. Many of the largest
Maya cities were suddenly abandoned for no clearly apparent reason. One
of the exceptions was Chichen Itza, which endured and even reached its
apex in the ensuing Postclassic period, from about C.E. 900–1300. Maya de
scendents, speaking dialects of the Maya language, continue to live in
southern Mexico, Guatemala, and adjacent countries.
Maya Long Count 243

That the Maya peoples were prepossessed with astronomy is beyond
dispute, although the motivation seems to have been primarily astrological.
The Maya shared the general Mesoamerican concern with calendrical cycles,
taking to tremendous lengths the quest to find coincidence between different
numbers of cycles of different celestial bodies. However, one of their most
incredible achievements was the adoption, development, and extensive use
of the linear calendar known as the Long Count. Underlying this was a set
of time units—baktuns (periods of four hundred years), katuns (twenty
years), tuns (years of 360 days), uinals (twenty days) and kins (days)—and
each progressive day was simply expressed as a number of each unit. For ex
ample, 9.17.19.13.16 meant nine baktuns, seventeen katuns, nineteen tuns,
thirteen uinals and sixteen days.
One crucial prerequisite, without which Long Count dates could never
have been recorded and, arguably, the Long Count is unlikely even to have
been conceived, is a system for recording numbers using a fixed base. Mod
ern (Arabic) numerals use a decimal (base ten) system, so that 8,945 signi
fies 5 units + 4 tens + 9 hundreds (10 x 10) + 8 thousands (10 x 10 x 10).
The Maya did the same, except they used different symbols to express the
digits and used a base of twenty. Thus, when they wrote (in their own vi
gesimal, rather than decimal, notation) 1.2.7.5 this signified 5 units + 7
twenties + 2 four-hundreds (20 x 20) + 1 eight-thousand (20 x 20 x 20)—in
other words, the same number. (The use of base twenty makes sense: our
base ten derives from counting using the fingers and thumbs, and people
have twenty digits on their hands and feet.) To represent the individual nu
merical digits, the Maya used bars and dots. Each dot counted one and each
bar five. Thus the digit seven was represented by a bar and two dots. When
reading Maya numbers it is essential to remember that each set of bars and
dots represents a single digit. In a base-twenty system, we need symbols for
all the digits from one to nineteen, and so the largest, nineteen, was repre
sented by three bars and four dots. Finally, in any fixed-base notation we
need a symbol for zero. The Maya used a stylized nut, shell, or other vari
ants. More esoteric ways of recording numbers also existed, such as repre
senting each digit from 0 to 19 as a deity’s head shown in profile with dis
tinctive attributes.
Before any society can develop a fixed-base recording system for num
bers, they must develop two concepts: first, the idea that the position of a
digit can be used to signify value—that is, depending on its place, a digit can
represent units, twenties, four-hundreds, etc.; second, the concept of zero in
order to concoct a symbol to represent it. Once these bridges are crossed,
two major advantages soon emerge. The first is the ease with which one can
do simple arithmetic. It is a trivial matter to multiply a Maya numeral by
twenty by simply adding a zero on the end, and other sums are easily solved
244 Maya Long Count
Pure Mathematical Physics



using straightforward rules, just as with modern numbers; but they would be
frightfully difficult using, say, Roman numerals. The second advantage is the
ability to represent arbitrarily large numbers (since it is always possible to
add further digits). It is this ability that aided the conceptualization of the
long periods of time that underlie the Long Count.
The relationship between Long Count dates and base-twenty numbers
fell out naturally, since each time unit was twenty times larger than the next
smaller one, with the single exception of the tun, which is eighteen rather
than twenty uinals in order to achieve a “year” not too different in length
from the real one. In fact, all written records that have come down to us are
calendrical, and in these the Maya used a modified vigesimal system to ex
press all numbers, in which the third-to-last digit was 18, rather than 20,
times the second-to-last one.
The significance for us of Long Count dates is that they permit us to
date sites and artifacts. The significance for the ancient Maya was that they
could achieve a grand conception of history. On the first point, most Maya
calendrical inscriptions give the Long Count and Calendar Round (haab plus
tzolkin) date. One of the main challenges is to find events, dated according
to the Long Count, that can also be dated within our own (Gregorian) cal
endar to permit a correlation between the two. Astronomical events such as
eclipses are one possibility; recorded events soon after the conquest are an
other. Once the correlation is determined any Long Count date can be con
verted to a Gregorian one. The issue of finding the definitive correlation has
occupied Maya scholars for many decades.
On the second point, since the Long Count was a linear calendar, the
Maya could conjure up key (mythical) historical events and assign them
dates that seemed significant within the Long Count, such as the beginning
of a new baktun. Even more fundamentally, they had to fix a zero date for
the whole scheme—an assumed date of creation. The date chosen corre
sponds in the Gregorian calendar to about August 13, 3114 B.C.E. (depend
ing upon the correlation). One explanation of why this particular date was
chosen is that it was obtained by retrogressing the Calendar Round and
other observed astronomical cycles in order to reach a date of key (per
ceived) astronomical significance.
The Long Count could also be extended into the future and provided a
source of prognostication. It is commonly believed that the ancient Maya
even predicted the end of the world, which would occur at the end of bak
tun 13, around December 21, 2012. However it now seems more likely that
they considered the present era would contain 20 baktuns, or a complete pic
tun of 8,000 years, giving the world considerably longer.
A more sobering thought is that without the historical evidence of
Maya inscriptions and the few books that only survive through fortunate ac

cident, we would know little or nothing of the existence—let alone the dis
tinctiveness or complexities—of Maya astronomy and calendrics. Although
a few anomalous round towers, such as the Caracol at Chichen Itza, have
been suggested as possible observatories, there is no convincing archaeolog
ical evidence of any Maya astronomical measuring instruments.

Medicine Wheels
The structures known as medicine wheels are distinctive configurations of
boulders found across the Great Plains region of Canada and the United
States. Over 130 examples are known; they are typically found in remote
spots at high elevations. Among the most famous are Majorville Cairn in
Alberta, Moose Mountain in Saskatchewan, and Big Horn in Wyoming.
The archetypal medicine wheel is a few tens of meters (around a hundred
feet) across and exhibits a characteristic “spoked wheel” structure, with an
outer ring and a central cairn. In practice, however, no two are the same
and the form varies widely. The supernatural and shamanic associations
that have given rise to the term “medicine” are modern. Yet at sites such as
Majorville, the large central cairn—striking both because of its size and be
cause of the inclusion of a variety of colorful local stones topped with re
cent offerings—has evidently been cumulated over a very long period. Ar
chaeological evidence corroborates this conclusion (the site was excavated
in the 1970s) and demonstrates that there has been more or less continuous
activity at the site for as long as five thousand years.
Medicine wheels were among the earliest indigenous structures in the
Americas to be analyzed astronomically, at around the time of the rise of
“megalithic astronomy” in Britain in the 1970s. Big Horn, for example, was
found to have a plausible axis of symmetry oriented upon midsummer sun
rise and excited much attention. This was followed by the discovery of align
ments upon midsummer sunset and the rising positions of the stars Alde

baran, Rigel, and Sirius. The idea that these alignments could have been in
tentional was backed up by the common-sense argument that the heliacal ris
ings of the three stars, and of course the summer solstice sunrise and sunset,
all occurred during the summer months, when the site would not have been
covered with deep, drifting snow.
However, as astronomical interest in medicine wheels grew, the ease
with which solar, stellar, and even lunar alignments could be identified
and replaced by new ones when errors were found in earlier calculations
became disconcerting. A more systematic study in the 1990s by the Cana
dian archaeoastronomer David Vogt revealed little overall consistency in
patterns of orientation and astronomical alignment. The basic problem
was that the alignment hunters had paid little attention to the cultural con
text.
Anthropological studies have suggested a variety of functions that med
icine wheels may have served: as monuments to the dead, for example; as fo
cuses for Sun Dance rituals; or as sacred places where those on solitary Vi
sion Quests went to seek the patronage of guardian spirits. Such ideas do not
rule out the possibility that solar and stellar alignments were incorporated
into at least some medicine wheels as a vital part of their broader function;
but it is difficult to see any need for high precision, and the ways in which

different forms of the medicine wheels themselves.

“Megalithic Astronomy”
This term, which is a chapter title in Alexander Thom’s first book, came to
be synonymous with Thom’s ideas concerning the astronomical significance
of the megalithic monuments of Britain. It is generally felt by archaeologists
to be unhelpful (along with terms such as “megalithic mensuration,” “mega
lithic geometry,” and “megalithic man”) because there was no “megalithic
culture” as such. The prehistoric communities who built many of the mega
lithic monuments of Britain and Ireland also built structures in earth, timber,
and other materials; it is just that the stone constructions have best with
stood the passing of time so that many of them remain, conspicuous, in the
modern landscape.

“Megalithic” Calendar
Sir Norman Lockyer, writing early in the twentieth century, was one of the
first to suggest that there was a widespread calendrical practice in Neolithic
248 “Megalithic Astronomy”
Pure Mathematical Physics



and Bronze Age Britain and Ireland that involved dividing the year into
eight equal parts. This calendrical practice fed through into Celtic times two
millennia later, and thence to medieval pagan and Christianized calendrical
festivals. It has nothing to do with lunar months but instead involves count
ing the days from one of the solstices. The eight division points are the two
solstices themselves, the two equinoxes, and the four mid-quarter days.
When Alexander Thom started to survey scores of British megalithic
monuments several decades later, and to examine their astronomical poten
tial, he noticed accumulations of alignments upon the position of sunrise or
sunset at each of these eight dates. There was even some hint of an interest
in the dates halfway in between them. On the basis of this evidence Thom
proposed that there existed in Neolithic Britain a “megalithic calendar” di
viding the year into sixteen equal parts, each twenty-two or twenty-three
days long, demarcated by “epoch dates,” which in the modern (Gregorian)
calendar would correspond, to within a day or so, to June 21 (solstice), July
14, August 6 (mid-quarter day), August 28, September 20 (equinox), Octo
ber 13, November 5 (mid-quarter day), November 28, December 21 (sol
stice), January 12, February 4 (mid-quarter day), February 27, March 22
(equinox), April 14, May 6 (mid-quarter-day), and May 29. While the six
teen-division calendar never gained wide acceptance, there was a great at
traction in the idea that the eight-fold division of the year represented a
thread of continuity stretching through the Celtic calendar and into the even
more remote past. Indeed, mid-quarter day alignments have been found
among stone circles, such as Beltany in County Donegal, Ireland; among Ne
olithic passage tombs dating back to the late fourth millennium B.C.E., such
as Dowth (one of the large tombs in the Boyne valley) and Bryn Celli Ddu
on the Isle of Anglesey (Ynys Môn) in Wales; and even in one Earlier Ne
olithic site (a U-shaped setting of timber posts) at Godmanchester in Cam
bridgeshire, England.
Yet this argument may be circular. There is a distinct danger of our
picking out “calendrical” alignments because they seem interesting—be
cause they form part of our list of astronomical targets deemed worthy of at
tention—while ignoring many other alignments that do not point at calen
drical targets. Lockyer was certainly aware of existing ideas about the Celtic
calendar, as was Thom. Reassessments of Thom’s data, paying stricter at
tention to the fair selection of data, have failed to duplicate his results re
garding the calendar, as have systematic studies of local groups of monu
ments. Added to this, the whole notion of a precise “Celtic” calendar,
confidently assumed by Lockyer and Thom and their contemporaries, is now
known to be highly problematic and questionable in itself.
Finally, one of the other criticisms of Thom’s megalithic calendar was
that he did not find calendrical sites as such (although the site at Brainport
“Megalithic” Calendar 249

Bay in Argyll, Scotland, was subsequently claimed as one), but rather a scat
ter of individual monuments with isolated alignments, each of which indi
cated sunrise or sunset on just one of the various calendrical epoch dates.

Megalithic Monuments of Britain and Ireland
All over Britain and Ireland, and particularly in the more remote northern
and western areas of Britain and the western side of Ireland, the traveler is
quite likely to encounter one of the hundreds—indeed, several thousands
of megalithic monuments (monuments built of large stones) that form a
conspicuous legacy of the prehistoric past of the British Isles. Erected in the
Neolithic period or the earlier part of the Bronze Age, between the later part
of the fourth millennium B.C.E. and the later part of the second millennium
B.C.E., this category of monuments includes huge passage tombs such as
Newgrange in Ireland and Maes Howe in Scotland, and spectacular settings
of standing stones such as Callanish in Scotland and Avebury and Stone
henge in southern England. It also includes a great many more modest
tombs and temples, often found in remote fields and farmlands, as well as
stone circles, short stone rows, and many single standing stones.
These alluring and mysterious monuments have attracted astronomical
attention ever since the earliest antiquarians roamed the British Isles as far
back as the seventeenth century. The first person to bring any semblance of
a scientific method to this type of investigation was Sir Norman Lockyer at
the beginning of the twentieth century. However, the most famous name in
this regard is Alexander Thom who, from the 1950s to the 1970s, espoused
the idea that they functioned as astronomical observatories and incorporated
high-precision alignments upon the rising and setting positions of the sun,
moon, and stars. These conclusions concerning “megalithic astronomy”
caused controversy for many years, until a consensus among archaeologists
and astronomers finally began to emerge toward the end of the 1980s.
From the archaeological point of view, it is important to realize that
this category of monument does not reflect a particular cultural development
250 Megalithic Monuments of Britain and Ireland
Pure Mathematical Physics



but rather a practice of construction using large stones that emerged among
the early farmers of the Neolithic period and spread, developing all the time
in various ways, until it finally faded out toward the end of the Bronze Age.
It manifests itself in various forms of monument, doubtless with many dif
ferent purposes. Some, like the great sarsen monument at Stonehenge, were
unique, while others evidently represented regional traditions, since monu
ments of very similar form were found in considerable numbers in particu
lar local areas. Examples of the latter are the wedge tombs of western Ire
land and the recumbent stone circles of northeastern Scotland. Many of
these regional practices appear to have emerged, and then faded away,
within a fairly short period compared with the two millennia or so that the
whole megalithic tradition persisted in Britain and Ireland. The whole tra
dition itself forms part of a wider megalithic tradition that is particularly
prominent on the Atlantic fringes of western and northern Europe, al
though megalithic monuments are also found in other parts of Europe and
indeed all over the world at such places as Carahunge in Armenia, Nabta
Playa in Egypt, and Rujm el-Hiri in Israel. This wide distribution in itself
helps to emphasize that we should not see the practice of building things
with big stones as a key indicator of significant ethnic or cultural identities
in the past.

All this helps to explain archaeologists’ skepticism in the 1970s toward
archaeoastronomical theories such as Thom’s that implied the existence in
Neolithic Britain of a “megalithic science” that was well developed, stable,
and consistently practiced (by “megalithic man”) from one end of the British
Isles to the other. More recent evidence reveals much more complex and re
gionally specific developments in astronomy throughout the two millennia
when megalithic monuments of various forms were being constructed. Im
portant examples in this regard are the axial stone circles of southwest Ire
land, the wedge tombs of western Ireland, and the Clava cairns and recum
bent stone circles of northeast Scotland.

Megalithic “Observatories”
In the mid-twentieth century, the engineer Alexander Thom proposed that
many British megalithic monuments functioned in prehistory as devices for
observing the sun, moon, or stars. Actually, the horizon was the real ob
serving instrument. Given a sufficiently distant horizon, and provided that
the observing position is closely enough defined, then any clear, unmistak
able horizon feature such as a jagged hilltop or a sharp notch between two
steep slopes can be used to pinpoint a particular direction. From the right
observing position, the notch or other feature can be used as a foresight
marking the rising or setting point of a celestial body to remarkable preci
sion, perhaps to as little as a few arc minutes. For instance, the difference
in the rising or setting position of the sun on the solstice and a couple of
days earlier or later is normally imperceptible. However, by choosing a suit
able observing position and horizon notch, an oberserver could distinguish
the solstice, Thom observed, on the basis of whether or not a brief flash of
sunlight from the very edge of the sun’s disc appeared in the notch. Many
megalithic monuments, he claimed, marked both the place to stand and the
direction in which to look. They could, in this sense, appropriately be la
beled “observatories.” Classic examples include the stone row at Bal

lochroy and the standing stone at Kintraw, both near the coast of Argyll,
western Scotland.
Thom’s ideas of high-precision alignments have not withstood the test
of time. During the 1970s and 1980s many problems came to light, includ
ing day-to-day variations in atmospheric refraction, and extinction in the
case of stars; and many difficulties were found with Thom’s selection of data
(see, for example, Brodgar, Ring of). Many archaeologists were deeply sus
picious from the outset of the idea of “observatories” in prehistory. They did
not necessarily dismiss out of hand the possibility of deliberate astronomical
alignments; what disturbed them was the idea that monumental alignments
were used primarily as observing devices. Surely, if the aim was merely to
mark a rising or setting position, one could simply use a temporary marker
such as a wooden stake, as is done by sun-watchers among the Mursi in
Ethiopia. There would be no need to go to all the bother of erecting big
stones. Given that big stones were used, it would seem more likely that they
were encapsulating an alignment that was already well known, perhaps us
ing it for symbolic or ceremonial purposes. This would be entirely consistent
with the human tendency, identified by anthropologists, to encapsulate rela
tionships of cosmological significance in monumental architecture. This sort
of explanation also fits well with the lower-precision alignments that are
more commonly indicated by research in archaeoastronomy today.

Meridian
The meridian is a line running directly overhead across the sky, joining the
north point on the horizon to the south point. Technically, it is defined as
the complete circle around the celestial sphere that also passes directly un
derneath, but this definition can be ignored for current purposes. Any ob
server on earth, unless they are standing at one of the two poles, has a
meridian. Every celestial body crosses that meridian once each day, halfway
Meridian 253

in time between rising in the east and setting in the west, assuming that the
eastern and western horizons are level or at a similar altitude; circumpolar
stars, which never rise or set, cross it twice. The celestial north pole lies on
the meridian for observers in the northern hemisphere, as does the celestial
south pole for observers in the southern hemisphere. Outside the tropics,
every celestial object reaches its highest altitude, or point of culmination, on
the meridian. In particular, the sun crosses the meridian at local noon: at
this time, the shadow of a vertical pole is shortest and points due north in
the northern hemisphere or south in the southern hemisphere.
The cultural significance of the meridian is that it is an axis of symme
try around which all the celestial bodies swing evenly in the course of their
diurnal motion. Anything aligned along this axis on the ground (i.e., due
north–south) will appear naturally “in tune” with the symmetry of the heav
ens. Perhaps this was one reason the Great North Road leading into and out
of Chaco Canyon was so closely aligned along the meridian. Meridianal
alignments are also oriented, consequentially, upon the celestial pole, which
is often seen as the hub of the heavens, the point that keeps the cosmos in
place, or the point of connection with the upper world. Aligning earthly
structures along the meridian can serve to confirm and reinforce the power
of great leaders, whether living, as in the imperial Forbidden City in Beijing,
or dead, as with those entombed in the Pyramids of Giza.
How, though, was the meridian determined in practice, especially when
reasonable accuracy was desired? After dispensing with modern instruments,
the simplest way in the northern hemisphere at the present time might be to
orient directly upon Polaris, which would give true north to within a degree;
but owing to precession no bright star marked the pole at most times in the
past. One possibility is to use two chosen circumpolar stars to determine the
north direction, using a plumb line to determine when one passed directly
above the other. It has been suggested that, with the right choice of stars, this
method would explain the extraordinary accuracy with which the Khufu
Pyramid at Giza was cardinally aligned. The continued use of the same stars
over subsequent decades would then have resulted in lower accuracy for sub
sequent pharaohs.
But there is a problem here. We can easily work out which two stars
would give the best result because our modern instruments and computer
programs tell us very accurately where true north actually is; people in the
past did not, by definition, have such a yardstick. How could they have
known which two stars were best? In fact, this was not an insoluble prob
lem for them: one possibility is that they marked the direction defined by a
vertically aligned pair of stars, then observed the same pair of stars at a dif
ferent time of year and night when they were upside down (this would hap
pen twelve hours after the first observation but would not generally be ob
254 Meridian
Pure Mathematical Physics



servable at that time because the sky would be light). The difference between
the two directions would give an indication of the accuracy (in fact, the av
erage of the two directions would be true north). Of course, this is only a
suggestion, and the actual method used remains speculative; the point is that
we have step out of our own shoes in order to recognize that there is a ques
tion to be answered.

Mesoamerican Calendar Round
Ancient Mesoamerica—the region stretching from central Mexico to El Sal
vador and northern Honduras, including Guatemala and Belize—had a tur
bulent history. One city-state after another rose to power and then col
lapsed, often relatively suddenly and for no obvious cause. From the Olmec,
who inhabited the hot and humid lowlands of the Mexican Gulf Coast as
early as 1200–400 B.C.E., to the Aztec, whose powerful and in many ways
cruel empire centered on the Valley of Mexico in the central highlands was
at its height at the time of Spanish contact, the archaeological record of the
region bears witness to numerous and varied polities that rose and fell.
Despite this backdrop of social turmoil, common aspects of Mesoamer
ican ceremonial centers (such as ball courts, the setting for a ritualistic ball
game) bear witness to common practices and beliefs—in other words, a com
mon worldview. An essential and apparently unassailable aspect of this
worldview was the calendar. Its basic structure was totally distinctive—it is
unlike any other calendar system the world has seen—yet extraordinarily
consistent, and persistent, through ancient Mesoamerica. It consisted of two
interconnected cycles. The first, relatively unexceptional in itself, comprised
an endlessly repeating cycle of 365 days divided into eighteen months of
twenty days plus five additional days.
It is the other cycle that is extraordinary and gives the Mesoamerican
calendar its idiosyncratic character. Also endlessly repeating, it contained

260 days, organized around thirteen numbers and twenty day names, but
with each running continuously, like two interlocking cogwheels. Thus, for
the Maya (for whom the twenty day names were Imix, Ik, Akbal, Kan, Chic
chan, Cimi, Manik, Lamat, Muluc, Oc, Chuen, Eb, Ben, Ix, Men, Cib, Ca
ban, Etznab, Cauac, and Ahau), the day 1 Imix was followed by 2 Ik, 3 Ak
bal, etc., round to 13 Ben, but then followed 1 Ix, 2 Men, etc., round to 7
Ahau, then 8 Imix, 9 Ik, etc. Every possible combination of number and day
name would be covered, but in what seems to us a very improbable order,
before the commencement of the next 260-day cycle. The names of the two
cycles, as well as the month and day names within them, varied from one
Mesoamerican culture to another, but the cycles themselves were quite in
variable. And they were themselves intermeshed, resulting in a Calendar
Round that only returned to its starting point after slightly less than fifty-two
years, in other words, exactly fifty-two rounds of the longer (365-day) cycle
and seventy-three rounds of the shorter (260-day) one.
In central Mexico the Calendar Round was known as the Xuihmolpilli,
or “binding of the years.” The end of the cycle, when the years were bound,
was a time of great fear. All fires were extinguished, houses were swept very
clean and all rubbish removed. At an elaborate ceremony, commencing in
the middle of the night (when the Pleiades crossed the meridian, according
to one source), new fire was kindled in the heart of a sacrificed warrior, thus
ensuring that the sun would reappear, at which point runners with torches
would spread the new fire around the land. The great Templo Mayor in the
center of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan was rebuilt six times, each reju
venation involving the addition of an entirely new layer over the existing
temple, thereby increasing its size substantially. It has been suggested that
these episodes of rebuilding might well have been undertaken in preparation
for the start of a new Calendar Round, although there is no direct evidence
to support the idea. It is more generally accepted that they were ordered by
successive new rulers.
The 260-day cycle was called the tzolkin in the Maya region and the
tonalpohualli in central Mexico. Nobody knows its origins. While the 365
day cycle (haab for the Maya, xihuitl or xiuhpohualli for the Aztecs) was
clearly related to the solar year, the tzolkin has no obvious astronomical der
ivation, although several different theories have been proposed. One sugges
tion is that it arose from observations of the zenith passage of the sun around
the latitude of fifteen degrees (that is, at around the latitude of the Classic
Maya site of Copan), where the interval between the two dates of zenith pas
sage in a given year was, indeed, 260 days. However, the earliest inscriptions
attesting to the 260-day calendar round, dating to the mid-first millennium
B.C.E., come from much farther north, in the region of Oaxaca. We do know
for certain that the 260-day cycle was of fundamental importance for div
256 Mesoamerican Calendar Round
Pure Mathematical Physics



inatory purposes. Each day had its omens, good or bad, and these were used
to regulate a variety of sacred rituals as well as more general activities. The
tzolkin is still used for prognostications among Quiché Maya peoples to this
day.
Ancient Mesoamericans were tremendously concerned with fitting to
gether cycles of nature—or to be more precise, cycles of the celestial bodies
into neatly repeating longer cycles. All the while, the 260-day cycle, itself ap
parently unrelated to any cycle directly visible in the skies, endured and
formed part of this process. Some larger cycles fell out naturally, owing to
(what we would see as) coincidences of nature. The most important of these
is the fact that eight synodic cycles of Venus are very close to five solar years.
The Mesoamericans knew the synodic period of Venus to be 584 days, and
by this reckoning five Venus cycles are exactly equivalent to eight haab or xi
huitl years of 365 days. It follows that, since the number of 365-day years in
two Calendar Rounds is divisible by eight, two Calendar Rounds must also
be a whole number of Venus cycles: actually sixty-five of them. This coinci
dence of three cycles has been suggested as a reason that particular signifi
cance was attached to the end of every second Calendar Round.
Another astronomical coincidence is that three times the mean eclipse
danger period, close to 173.3 days, which would be necessary knowledge for
anyone hoping to predict eclipses, is equal to two 260-day cycles, so that the
main danger of eclipses would recur around (every other occurrence of) the
same three dates in the 260-day cycle. Yet another coincidence is the fact that
the synodic period of the planet Mars is equal to exactly three rounds of 260
days. In the case of central Mexico, it is not always easy to pursue these
ideas, since the threads of evidence are very indirect, but it is quite certain
that the Maya took this process of cycle-matching to tremendous lengths: we
know this from the Dresden Codex.
A number of religious texts both from before and from shortly after the
conquest contain cosmograms—representations of the cosmos that can con
tain depictions of the gods, the four quarters of the world and their quali
ties, the path of the sun along the horizon, and the calendar, plus perceived
interrelationships between them. A famous example in the Codex Féjérvary
Mayer, a pre-conquest document from central Mexico, contains a pattern of
dots in the shape of a Maltese cross which represents the entire 260-day sa
cred round arranged in twenty groups of thirteen. In form, this resembles
many of the pecked cross-circle designs found in and around a number of
central Mexican sites. It is not surprising, then, that the numbers of small
holes forming the basic elements of such designs seem to include, much more
frequently than would be expected by chance, calendrically significant num
bers such as twenty, eighteen, thirteen, and five.
Another way in which concepts of number, calendar, space, and time
Mesoamerican Calendar Round 257
Pure Mathematical Physics



may have been tied together in ancient Mesoamerica is manifested in what
has become known as calendrical orientation. Systematic studies of the ori
entations of buildings and city plans, both in central Mexico and in the
Maya world, have revealed clear but curious patterns of orientation prefer
ence. (Many Maya cities, for example, have their street grids oriented a few
degrees clockwise of the cardinal directions.) These preferences included
sunrise and sunset on dates whose significance would have followed, as for
many peoples worldwide, from directly observable extremes in the motions
of the sun—the solstices and the days of zenith (and perhaps also anti-zenith)
passage. However, there are also notable regional preferences for other days
in the year. Some of these seem to indicate the existence of horizon calendars
in which key dates were those counted off from the solstices in intervals such
as twenty, fifty-two, sixty-five, and seventy-three days, numbers that also
arise in the context of the Calendar Round.
However, the apparent coexistence of the Calendar Round and horizon
calendars raises an issue. Calendars based on the movement of the sun up
and down the horizon are implicitly tied to the true solar year, whereas the
365-day cycle of the Calendar Round that became established all over
Mesoamerica would have slipped against this by one day in every four years,
and the discrepancy would have become evident over time. Since our knowl
edge of the Calendar Round comes from documentary and historical
sources, while the evidence for horizon calendars relies more on the statistics
of alignments, it is not easy to resolve this issue. One possibility that has
been suggested is that the horizon calendars were older developments, pre
cursors of the Calendar Round. Another is that the formal, ceremonial 365
day calendar and the pragmatic horizon-based one existed in parallel, rather
like what is thought (by most scholars) to have occurred with the civil and
lunar calendars in ancient Egypt.
In most respects, the Mesoamerican calendar reflected the cycles of na
ture—particularly observable astronomical cycles—directly. The only appar
ent exception to this was the 260-cycle tzolkin or tonalpohualli: if this ever
did have such a basis, it became lost in the mists of time. Yet this sacred cy
cle, with its complex set of associated prognostications, lay at the very heart
of Mesoamerican worldview and calendrics.

Mesoamerican Cross-Circle Designs
Cross-circle designs, often referred to as pecked cross-circles, are found at
several sites in the highlands of central Mexico and also as far south as the
Maya city of Uaxactún, typically pecked into the stuccoed floors of build
ings or carved as petroglyphs in rocks in the hills around cities. The great
est preponderance is in and around Teotihuacan, where over fifty are
known. They generally consist of one, two, or three concentric circles in
tersecting four radial lines in the shape of a cross, though there are numer
ous variants on this design, including squares and Maltese crosses. They are
typically around one meter (three feet) across, and made up of cuplike de
pressions about one centimeter (half an inch) in diameter. They have at
tracted a good deal of attention from archaeoastronomers, since they may
have reflected aspects of astronomy and the calendar in three distinct ways.
The first way is in their numerology. Counts of the number of dots
forming elements of cross-circle designs, such as on radial spokes between
points where they cross the circles or on circle sectors between points where
they cross radial spokes, reveal a preponderance of the numbers five, thir
teen, eighteen, and twenty, which are significant as elements of the
Mesoamerican calendar. Enough of them have a total count of 260 (the
number of days in the sacred 260-day calendrical cycle) to suggest that this
might have been significant too. They may have been symbolic representa
tions of the calendar in some sense, an idea that seems less strange when we
compare them with cosmograms found in some of the central Mexican
codices. Yet ethnohistoric accounts also refer to the use of such designs,
made up of cavities pecked into the floors of buildings, for a game called pa
tolli, which involved moving pebbles around in the holes. Why should a
gameboard have reflected the calendar? Perhaps because, in Aztec times at
least, it had religious overtones.
The second way the cross-circle designs may have reflected aspects of
Mesoamerican Cross-Circle Designs 259
Pure Mathematical Physics



astronomy and the calendar is in their orientation. Systematic studies suggest
that the spokes of those found as geoglyphs on natural rocks tend (more of
ten than would be expected by chance) to be oriented roughly in the solsti
tial directions. This would not be surprising if they were indeed cosmologi
cal symbols, reflecting the four corners of the perceived cosmos.
Finally, those carved on rock outcrops tend to be in hilly locations with
clear views of distant horizons, particularly toward the east, once again sug
gesting a connection between landscape, calendar, and cosmos. Could some
of them have marked observing points? Or, as has been suggested, were they
used as surveyor’s benchmarks? In the 1970s it was proposed that three of
the cross-circles at Teotihuacan—one pecked into the floor of a building by
the Street of the Dead and two carved into rocks on adjacent hills—defined
two baselines that were used by surveyors in laying out the street grid. This
idea was criticized on statistical grounds, because it depended upon the ar
bitrary selection of three cross-circles from fourteen then known at Teoti
huacan (the total is now over fifty), and on archaeological grounds, because
the central cross-circle, used in both baselines, was pecked into the floor of
a building dating to a late phase, long after the street grid was set out. The
statistical argument was criticized in its turn because of the established fact

that cross-circles had different purposes. But we cannot use this as an excuse
for simply selecting the data that fit a given hypotheses and ignoring the rest.
The archaeological evidence seems to clinch the issue unless one appeals to
the possibility (unproven) that the central pecked cross may have been cited
on the position of an older one.
Be this as it may, it is quite clear that cross-circle designs had several
different functions and meanings. One view is that they represent the prop
agation of a symbol whose form remained essentially unaltered but came to
be used for different purposes. An alternative is that many if not all of these
purposes were interrelated. It may seem strange to us to tie concepts of space
and time together in such contorted ways, but the unfamiliar manner in
which patterns of thought operate within other worldviews means we would
certainly be wrong to close our minds altogether to such possibilities.

Methodology
Methodology concerns how we go about obtaining data and using those
data to assess our theories. Whether we are considering archaeological evi
dence such as monumental alignments, or other forms of evidence relevant
in archaeoastronomy such as ethnohistoric accounts, written documents, or
a combination of these, we need agreed-upon procedures that give us con
fidence that we can reach the best, most reasonable, most reliable, and most
sustainable conclusions on the basis of the evidence available. An accepted
methodology is vital in any academic discipline, and it will constantly be
under review: people will constantly strive to improve it.
Methodology 261
Pure Mathematical Physics



One of the most fundamental methodological necessities is to be fair
with the evidence. As a statistician involved in the debates about Alexander
Thom’s theories concerning the British megaliths once decreed: “Observe all
there is and report all you observe.” In practice it is seldom feasible to ob
serve all there is, so fair ways of selecting (sampling) data become vital. “Fair
selection of data” means doing so in a way that will not bias the eventual
conclusion. In other words, it is vital that researchers not just consider and
present the evidence that favors a favorite theory while ignoring or hiding
the rest by accident or by design. This would occur if, in our enthusiasm to
find data that fit a favored theory—for example, that ancient stone rows
were aligned upon sunrise or sunset on particular days in the year—we kept
searching until we found suitable candidates while ignoring many others that
did not fit. Unless this principle is followed, no amount of complex statisti
cal analysis will have any value whatsoever.
Nowhere are the dangers more evident than in popular claims that con
structions on the ground, such as temples and pyramids, were laid out in the
form of celestial constellations. A famous example is the suggestion that var
ious temples at the ancient site of Angkor in Cambodia were laid out in the
formation of the bright stars in the constellation Draco. If there are no firm
criteria for selecting the buildings to be considered, then, given the large
number of stars in the sky to select from, one can obtain surprisingly good
fits totally fortuitously. One BBC television documentary, experimenting
with this concept, managed to obtain a remarkably good fit between the lay
out of selected large buildings in New York City and the stars in Leo.
Each of the various different types of evidence about ancient astronomy
presents its own methodological challenges. For instance, impressive light
and-shadow effects, occurring only when the sun or moon reach a particular
configuration, are well known. Famous examples include the equinox hiero
phany at the pyramid of Kukulcan at Chichen Itza in Mexico, the sun dagger
at Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, and the passage tomb at Newgrange in Ire
land. Each of these, on the face of it, may have been intentional but might be
the result of chance. As the American archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni
once said, “In the American southwest, the search for solar alignments [has
been] conducted with a fervent passion not exceeded anywhere in the world.
Many a weekend was spent by individuals in hot pursuit of daggers of light
entering cracks and openings in caves and buildings—especially light patterns
that crept across petroglyphs” (Ruggles 2002, p. 444). We have to devise
ways of assessing the likelihood that an effect we observe might actually have
been intentional. Where we have only the archaeological evidence to go on,
this must inevitably involve some sort of statistical analysis.
In alignment studies there is a similar problem, stemming from the sim
ple fact that every oriented building or structure must point somewhere, and
262 Methodology
Pure Mathematical Physics



there can be many different reasons for choosing a particular orientation.
Often an ancient monument contains not just one obvious axis but many
different alignments of buildings, stones, or other structures, and to pick
and choose between them on the basis of a favored theory will lead to com
pletely misleading conclusions. There are also many different horizon tar
gets—many potential rising and setting points of celestial bodies that we
might deem significant if we find alignments upon them. Added to this is a
further problem, that the rising and setting positions of stars change over
the centuries, owing to precession, and those of the sun, moon, and planets
to a lesser extent, owing to the changing obliquity of the ecliptic. If, as is
most often the case, we cannot date a structure at all accurately by archae
ological means, then if we simply choose the best fit date, the possibilities
are almost endless. If we allowed ourselves the fifteen brightest stars, for in
stance, and a range of five hundred years, we could fit a suitable star and
date for one-third of all oriented structures. Clearly we have to be far more
careful and critical.
What, then, can we do to reach a reasonable degree of confidence that
any alignment, light-and-shadow phenomenon, or similar association that
we spot in the archaeological record was actually intentional and meaning
ful? One possibility is to look for repeated occurrences. This approach has
demonstrated the solar and, in some cases, lunar significance of many local
groups of monuments in Britain and Europe, a classic example being the
Scottish recumbent stone circles. On the other hand, repeated occurrences
can only reveal prevailing practices that were widely and consistently ad
hered to. Another approach is to seek independent evidence that a particu
lar alignment was deliberate. Archaeological excavations can sometimes re
veal this, as has been the case at Balnuaran of Clava, near Inverness,
Scotland. Here, it seems that the structural stability of a passage tomb was
compromised in order to incorporate the correct astronomical alignment.
A fundamental methodological issue arises from the fact that people’s
behavior is not governed by unbending principles comparable to the physi
cal laws that govern the universe. Even where the strictest doctrines dictated
correct practice regarding, say, the construction of a Neolithic tomb, it is
likely that some people “did their own thing.” Treating archaeological data
too much like data from physics, subjecting it to “scientific” testing, will not
explain the actions of individuals in particular places and times, according
to particular sets of circumstances. The stone circle at Drombeg in Ireland is
a single solstitially oriented stone circle among a group of around fifty. Con
sidering the group as a whole, one would be extremely inclined to put the
solstitial alignment of Drombeg down to chance. However, it is certainly
possible that the builders of this monument did have reasons for the align
ment and that it was, in fact, deliberate. The crucial point is that one cannot
Methodology 263
Pure Mathematical Physics



use this argument to simply assume that the Drombeg alignment was delib
erate; to do so would be to fall into the trap that we identified at the start,
namely to choose the data that fits a favored theory (the solstitial alignment
at Drombeg) while ignoring the rest (the alignments of the other forty-nine
circles). Independent corroborating evidence, such as that obtained at Bal
nuaran of Clava, is needed.
Problems of data selection are not confined to archaeological evidence.
Ethnographers may have the problem of distinguishing between informants’
accounts that genuinely relate to practices that have been endemic for many
generations and more recent inventions or intrusions. The situation is also
different where we need to reconcile archaeological with historical and other
forms of evidence such as iconography and written inscriptions. Thus a
Venus alignment at the so-called Governor’s Palace at the Maya city of Ux
mal is a one-off that would not be given credence if we did not have a secure
date for the alignment, extensive evidence for the importance of Venus in
contemporary Maya culture, and many Venus glyphs on the building itself.
Another problem is that some alignments occur naturally, purely by
chance, but may well have been afforded significance in the past. A good ex
ample is the Hawaiian island chain, which is quite closely aligned with June
solstice sunset and December solstice sunrise. From an indigenous perspec
tive, such alignments, once noticed, can seem very impressive, since they ap
pear to demonstrate the integrity and harmony of the cosmos and the inter
connectedness of land and sky. However, this possibility can present a
headache for the modern archaeoastronomer seeking to prove that a partic
ular astronomical meaning was attached to a natural alignment in ancient
times, especially in the absence of corroborating evidence from history or
ethnography. A great many alignments with plausible astronomical connec
tions may well occur naturally in the landscape, and we have no knowledge
as to which ones were actually “observed.” Once again, we cannot use our
own predilections to prejudge the issue.
In short, it is crucial not to try to fit a favorite theory to some evidence.
We must select the data fairly and consider the possible alternative explana
tions. Unless we do this, we risk misleading not only everyone else but also
ourselves. How best, in practice, to assess competing interpretations of the
evidence at hand raises a series of questions. There is no simple answer to
many of them.We must always keep an open mind and always be open both
to new ideas and to new data.

Mid-Quarter Days
The solstices and equinoxes divide the year into four almost equal parts. If
one further divides each of these parts into two, the additional dates are
what are known variously as the mid-quarter or cross-quarter days, or
sometimes as the Scottish quarter days, since in Scotland, as opposed to
England, they—and not the solstices and equinoxes—were used as the ba
sis of the legal division of the year into four. The dates are February 4, May
6, August 6, and November 5.
A number of later prehistoric monuments in Britain and Ireland are
aligned upon sunrise or sunset close to one of the mid-quarter days, although
whether these alignments were intended and hence reflect a widespread cal
endrical practice is a matter of considerable doubt. Perhaps the earliest ex
ample is a U-shaped setting of large timber posts constructed in the Earlier
Neolithic (fifth century B.C.E.) at Godmanchester in Cambridgeshire, Eng
land, which was aligned upon sunrise in early May and early August. Oth
ers include the longer passage at the Neolithic passage tomb of Dowth,
County Meath, Ireland (one of three large tombs in the Boyne valley), which
is aligned upon sunset in early November and early February.
Four of the eight festivals traditionally associated with the Celtic calen
dar were also associated with mid-quarter days, namely Imbolc (early Febru
ary), Beltaine (early May), Lughnasa (early August), and Samhain (early No
vember), and these same dates found their way into pagan and Christianized
calendrical festivals, most notably the feast of All Saints on November 1.

Minoan Temples and Tombs
The Minoan civilization flourished in the Mediterranean island of Crete
during the mid-second millennium B.C.E. and influenced later developments
in the Aegean in various ways. It has been suggested, for example, that ori
entation practices in early and Classical Greece may derive in part from this
more ancient culture. The rich Bronze Age heritage of Minoan Crete in
cludes palaces, villas, and several peak sanctuaries—cult centers where ar
chaeologists have uncovered thousands of clay figurines, apparently votive
offerings left by pilgrims. Various solar and stellar alignments noted at peak
sanctuaries such as Pyrgos and Petsophas hint at an intimate relationship
between these temples and observations of the skies, as well as to the pos
sible use of prominent horizon foresights.
Similar relationships may also have extended to tombs. At Armenoi, a
huge Minoan cemetery on the western part of the island, are well over two
hundred carefully constructed tombs consistently oriented eastwards within
an arc that is best explained as relating to moonrise. Prominent on the sky
line in this direction is Mount Vrysinas, a mountain that may well have had
strong cultic associations with the moon, since a peak sanctuary located on
its summit seems to have been dedicated to a moon goddess.

Misminay
Misminay is a small village in the Peruvian Andes, geographically quite
close to well-trodden tourist destinations, since it is situated almost midway
between the city of Cusco and the famous ruins at Machu Picchu. It is,
however, off the main tourist routes and thus relatively remote and difficult
of access. In many ways it is unexceptional; what is unusual is that the as
tronomical knowledge and practices of the villagers are known in some de
tail, owing to the particular interest taken by anthropologist and ethnoas
tronomer Gary Urton in the 1970s.
The villagers recognize various objects in the sky and use several dif
ferent types of astronomical observation to regulate their seasonal agricul
tural activities. One is to observe the annual cycles of appearance (heliacal
rise) and disappearance (heliacal set) of different stars and asterisms. For ex
ample, there are two “celestial storehouses,” the Pleiades and the five stars
at the tail or hook of Scorpius. These are almost opposite in the sky, so one
or the other is generally visible at any time in the night. In fact, the most sig
nificant event in the cycle, the heliacal rise of the Pleiades in June, does not
directly signal the time to begin planting but instead heralds observations
where prognostications are made about the year’s crop yield on the basis of
the perceived brightness of the stars. The times for planting and harvesting
maize and potatoes are determined by another method: by looking at the
changing rising position of the sun on the eastern horizon, and in particular,
noting when it passes a given spot going in one or the other direction. The
lunar phases are also said by some to be important in determining the best
times for planting. In sum, the calendar is not regulated by simple observa
tions of one type, but by a mix of observations of the heliacal risings and set
tings of stars, the changing rising position of the sun along the horizon, and
(to some extent) the phases of the moon.
But there is a good deal more to Misminay astronomy than the agri
cultural calendar. The villagers’ conception of the sky forms part of a world
view that affects many aspects of life, including the very layout of the village.
Central to this worldview is the Milky Way, which at the latitude of Mismi
nay (14°S) has a very distinctive cycle of motions about the heavens during
each twenty-four-hour period. For several hours it appears to hang in the
sky, arcing over from roughly the northeast to the southwest, dividing the
sky into two parts. Then, relatively suddenly, it starts to tumble toward the

above the horizon. Equally suddenly, it starts to rise again, climbing up un
til it partitions the heavens in the orthogonal direction, from the northwest
to the southeast. The sequence is then repeated in reverse. This pattern of
motions only occurs at around this latitude and is difficult to visualize with
out the aid of a planetarium; but when seen it is extremely impressive. Only
half of this diurnal cycle can be seen at any particular time of the year, since
the other half occurs during daylight hours. This means that, for example,
when the sky first gets dark during the rainy season at Misminay, from No
vember to February, the Milky Way is seen arcing over from the northwest
to the southeast; whereas during the dry season, May to August, it divides
the sky the other way. For people living at this latitude and watching the
skies through the year, these patterns of motion soon become apparent. A
natural reaction is to conflate the two axes in one’s mind and to perceive
them as a cross, dividing the celestial dome into four quarters. This is pre
cisely what the inhabitants of Misminay do, and this perception is reflected
on the ground in a very direct way.
The central gathering place in the village is a chapel, standing at a
crossroads from which four paths head off in the intercardinal directions.
Apart from anything else, this alignment reflects a widespread tendency to
organize space around lines radiating out from a central place, a tendency
that stretches back to Inca and even pre-Inca times. The paths also mark out
social divisions, again reflecting broader practices long established in the re
gion. But the specifics of the layout of Misminay also bear important rela
tionships to the sky. The center of the village is the crossing point of two ir
rigation canals. Their directions, as well as those of the paths they follow,
reflect the two axes of the Milky Way in the sky. Terrestrial water flows
downhill, southward to northward, and the Milky Way is seen as a celestial
river that carries water back in the opposite direction, southward and up
into the sky, from which it falls as rain. By this means, the village is appro
priately placed within an integrated system that serves to circulate water
through the cosmos as a whole, and by so doing ensures the continued suc
cess of the crops and the survival of the community.
In fact, these are just some of the principal elements of a much more
complex conceptual scheme that links together, both in time and space, the
layout of things on the ground with different objects and events in the sky.
The directions of the four paths also correspond quite closely to the rising
and setting positions of the sun at the solstices. The June solstice, when the
sun rises in the northeast, corresponds to the time of year when the Milky
Way appears after sunset oriented in this direction. The same is true with re
gard to the southeast and the December solstice. Then again, the rising di
rection of the Pleiades, and the opposite setting direction of the tail of Scor
268 Misminay
Pure Mathematical Physics



pius, also coincide quite closely with the directions of the paths, the Milky
Way, and the solstitial directions. The heliacal rise of the Pleiades coincides
with the time when the sun rises in the same direction at the June solstice. In
short, the quartering of the earth by the cross-shaped paths and ditches re
flects many significant aspects of the quartering of the sky. (The quarters are
actually far from equal in size—the solstitial azimuths at Misminay are
roughly 63 degrees, 117 degrees, 243 degrees and 297 degrees—but this is a
detail that has no significance to the villagers.) The chapel at the center of
the village is appropriately named: its name is Crucero (cross).
Another interesting aspect of the Misminay villagers’ conception of the
sky is the “dark cloud constellations.” They perceive the shapes of dark
patches in the Milky Way to be creatures such as a llama, toad, fox, and
snake. The part of the Milky Way that appears in southern skies is especially
bright and impressive, and it is scarcely surprising to see these dark shapes,
hugely imposing against the foreground of bright stars, singled out as signif
icant in southern hemisphere cosmologies. The celestial llama is one of the
largest and most imposing shapes of all, and broadly corresponds to what is
seen as an emu across Aboriginal Australia. It also reminds us that the prac
tice of imagining stars as bright points on invisible objects and creatures,
which underlies the Western concept of constellations, is not the only way of
perceiving entities in the sky.
Finally, according to the villagers at Misminay, there is a correspon
dence between the gradual rise of the celestial llama in the sky each morning
and the breeding period of terrestrial llamas. This is one of many examples
from around the world of people perceiving a direct correspondence between
linked events on the earth and in the sky, another being the Barasana “Cater
pillar Jaguar” constellation.

Mithraism
The Mithraic religion was one of the most powerful sun cults in human his
tory. It took shape in Persia around the time of the conquests of Alexander
the Great in the fourth century B.C.E., spread into Babylonia and Hellenis
tic Greece, and subsequently into ancient Rome in the second century C.E.
All this time it was developing and changing as it came into contact with
Mithraism 269
Pure Mathematical Physics



other religions and new influences. Mithra, a solar deity, became identified
in Babylonia with the Babylonians’ own ancient sun god, Shamash; in
Greece with Helios, the sun, and the god Apollo; and in the Roman empire
with Sol Invictus, the unconquered, or unconquerable, sun.
In the Roman world, Mithraism had only modest support at first, as
one of a number of “mystery” cults from the east. In the second century C.E.,
however, it became popular among soldiers and spread rapidly with the le
gions to the far corners of the empire. Numerous temples, monuments, and
inscriptions are found from Asia Minor in the east to Britain in the west.
Mithraic temples are characterized by altars containing a scene depicting
Mithras ritually sacrificing a bull. From this primordial act, according to the
Mithraic belief, sprang life on earth.
By the late second century, Mithraism had attracted the support not
only of a range of government officials but even of the emperor himself.
Commodus, emperor from C.E. 180 to 192, was initiated into the sect, and
a frieze at Ephesus shows the sun taking his father, Marcus Aurelius, up to
heaven in a chariot escorted by the moon and stars. Commodus was the first
of a succession of Roman emperors for whom popular worship of the sun as
the supreme body in the heavens affirmed their own earthly powers. (An in
teresting comparison can be made here with the role of sun worship in Inca
society.) Caracalla, emperor from C.E. 212 to 217, seems to have portrayed
himself as the son of the sun god; and the mother of Aurelian (C.E. 270–275)
was believed, at least by some, to be a priestess of the sun. The culmination
came in C.E. 274, when, under Aurelian, the cult of Sol Invictus became the
official state religion of the empire.
Following Constantine’s conversion to Christianity early in the fourth
century, Christianity began its inexorable rise and pagan alternatives de
clined. Mithraism certainly presented the most serious pagan challenge to
early Christianity, and the bitter rivalries that ensued were sometimes over
come by a process of acculturation—subsuming pagan rituals within Chris
tian ones. This process is most obvious in its lasting effect on the Christian
calendar. It is no coincidence, for example, that the date of Christ’s nativity
was fixed as December 25, the date the Romans believed to be the winter
solstice, and which had been established by Aurelian in C.E. 274 as the feast
of the birth of the unconquered sun (Natalis Solis Invicti). Neither is it any
coincidence that the Christian holy day is named Sunday.
The conflict between early Christianity and astral religions such as
Mithraism also hardened Christian attitudes toward astrology.

Monuments and Cosmology
The architecture of public monuments, great and small, can give the ar
chaeologist important clues about the worldviews of those who built them.
One reason is that their designs may reflect the perceived cosmos, revealing
associations that existed in the minds of the builders, just as the solar align
ment at the passage tomb of Newgrange in Ireland reveals a perceived con
nection between the sun and the ancestors. Monumental architecture may
also reflect a ritually defined order of things that was relatively widespread
and relatively stable, even where the nature of the society at the time was
constantly changing in other ways. It is easy to see how existing monuments
may have helped reinforce the perceived order of things, since they created
an indelible mark on the landscape that was bound to have influenced fu
ture worldviews—if this is how the ancestors did things, people would
surely have thought, then this is how we must do things too. Conversely,
fundamental changes in ideology may indicate major social disruption.
This inherent stability of the perceived world order means that associ
ations of ideological and cosmological significance have a greater chance of
leaving their mark on the material record, and thus have a greater chance of
being detectable by modern archaeologists, than many other, more volatile
aspects of a past society. The reason is that we can expect them to be re
peated over and over again. A single association, such as the solstitial align
ment at Newgrange, may have meant nothing at all to the builders; it may
have arisen entirely fortuitously. But if we see other, similar solstitial align
ments repeated again and again, then the likelihood that they could have
arisen fortuitously is rapidly diminished. Where we find significant numbers
of monuments with similar designs, similar orientation, and even consistent
patterns of astronomical alignment, we can be confident that common prac
tices prevailed over a considerable area and time.
Throughout Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe we find discernible tra
ditions of monument construction operating at various levels and scales.
Some of these are remarkably widespread in space and time. In Britain, Ire
land, and Brittany, for example, a propensity to build circular and linear cer
emonial monuments resulted in the construction of many hundreds of stone

circles and stone rows over as long as two millennia. Patterns of orientation
tend to be more localized, and patterns of astronomical orientation more so
still. For example, among the recumbent stone circles, a group of stone cir
cles of a particular form found in northeastern Scotland, and among the
short stone rows of southwestern Ireland, there appear to be more specific
traditions of orientation upon prominent features in the landscape or rising
or setting positions of the sun or moon than in the larger area.

Moon, Motions of
Just as the rising and setting positions of the sun move north and south along
the eastern and western horizons over an annual cycle, those of the moon do
the same over the course of a month. This means that, unlike the sun, the
day-to-day change in the rising or setting position of the moon is consider
able, since the passage from one “lunistice” to the other is completed in a pe
riod of just two weeks. Observing these lunar changes is not an easy matter,
even from a place with perfect weather, because of the lunar phase cycle. The
moon rises and sets approximately an hour later each day, meaning that over
the course of the month, the aspiring observer will have to rise at all hours
of the night. Furthermore, for half of the month the moon will be rising (or
setting) in daylight, rendering the event almost certainly invisible.
The length of time it takes for the moon to complete a whole cycle from
north to south and back again, known technically as the tropical month, is
significantly shorter than the synodic (phase-cycle) month: 27.3 days as op
posed to 29.5. This means that the phase cycle and the cycle to and fro along
the horizon get significantly out of step. However, a pattern emerges over the
course of a complete year. At the time of the June solstice, the moon is full
when it is farthest south, and new when it is farthest north. At the time of
the December solstice, on the other hand, the opposite is the case. This
means that in the northern hemisphere, the midsummer full moon—or more
precisely the full moon nearest to the summer solstice, which can occur up
272 Moon, Motions of
Pure Mathematical Physics



to two weeks before or after the solstice itself—will rise and set at, or very
close to, the southern limit of its monthly motions. Conversely, the midwin
ter full moon will be at or close to the northern limit. Since the full moon is
the most prominent phase, and also the phase at which the moon lights up
the entire night, it may well be that it was the annual motions of the full
moon northward and southward, rather than the monthly cycle to and fro,
that was most important to many human cultures in the past.
From what has been said so far, the northward and southward swing
of the rising or setting moon along the horizon would seem to be similar to
that of the sun, but on a shorter time scale. However, there is another crit
ical complication. The directions of sunrise and sunset at the solstices are
effectively constant from year to year and only change very slowly over the
centuries, owing to the gradual change in the obliquity of the ecliptic. The
directions of moonrise and moonset at the monthly “lunistices,” in con
trast, vary noticeably from year to year. They themselves swing back and
forth over a cycle lasting 18.6 years, which is known as the lunar node cy
cle. At one point in this cycle, the monthly swing of the moon from north
to south is at its maximum and considerably wider than the annual swing
of the sun. At such times, the most northerly monthly rising or setting path
of the moon will reach beyond the most northerly annual rising or setting
path of the sun by more than five degrees, or ten solar or lunar diameters;
the most southerly path will do the same in the other direction. Some nine
years later, in contrast, the monthly swing of the moon will be at its mini
mum, falling short of the annual swing of the sun at both ends by a similar
amount. Alexander Thom coined the terms major standstill and minor
standstill, respectively, to signify these times. Although the terms have been
criticized as misleading, since nothing ever physically stands still, they are
convenient and have become quite commonly used.
Again, it is likely to have been the changes in the position of the full
moon that stood out most clearly to many human communities in the past.
If they noticed the lunar node cycle at all, it may have been because of the
changing path through the sky of the midwinter or midsummer full moon,
rising and setting unusually far north or south for only one or two short pe
riods during a lifetime. The effect would be most striking at latitudes of
about sixty degrees, which is reached in the northern hemisphere, for ex
ample, in northern parts of Scotland. Here, in years close to a major stand
still, the midsummer full moon would appear only briefly in the south, pass
ing very low over the southern horizon, where its proximity to terrestrial
landmarks would make it appear larger and closer.

Mursi Calendar
The Mursi live in the northern part of the basin of the river Omo in south
west Ethiopia. They depend for their subsistence upon both cattle and cul
tivation, mainly of sorghum but including some maize and cowpeas. Their
subsistence activities span two ecological zones: the Omo and its flanking
belt of bushland thicket, which is suitable for cultivation following annual
floods, and the higher, wooded grassland, where the cattle can be herded
safe from infestations of tsetse fly. The two most significant seasonal events
in Mursi country are the onset of the “big rains” in March or April, when
the entire Mursi population comes together at the border of the two zones
and rain cultivation is possible, and the flooding of the Omo six months
later, when some of the population, mainly women and girls, move to the
Omo and plant a flood cultivation along its banks, while the remainder,
mainly men and boys, move in the opposite direction to cattle camps where
they remain during the driest part of the year.
If one were trying to piece together an account of Mursi calendrical
practice from informants’ accounts, the first step in the process would be
easy. The Mursi have a seasonal calendar based upon the phase cycles of the
moon, and every member of the group, including children, can recount the
seasonal events associated with each month. Thus, for example, one would
learn immediately that in month eight the “big rains” fall. One would begin
to encounter difficulties, however, in trying to match up the Mursi months
with the seasonal year. There are between twelve and thirteen synodic (lunar
phase-cycle) months in the seasonal year, as we know. This means that in or
der to keep a lunar calendar in step with the seasons, some years must con
tain twelve months while others have thirteen. And yet, each Mursi year
contains twelve numbered months together with a thirteenth, which has a
name: gamwe. Mursi informants insist that no month is ever missed.
Only by living with the Mursi for a period of time could one discover
the solution to this problem. It would then become clear that, in practice,
no Mursi is ever quite sure what the current month is. This is despite the
fact that everyone is confident that there are experts who are. In actuality,
the regulation of the calendar is a matter of public consensus. When certain
seasonal events occur, their effect is to sway the balance of opinion. Even
major seasonal events such as the coming of the big rains do not serve to
fix the calendar, as might be expected from the rule of thumb that everyone
274 Mursi Calendar
Pure Mathematical Physics



recounts: this is because everyone acknowledges that seasonal events can
sometimes occur early or late. To an outsider, the Mursi calendar seems
haphazard and imprecise; yet for the Mursi it is self-consistent and works
perfectly well.
Among the Mursi are people who have a particular interest in watch
ing the sun rising behind the mountains on the eastern horizon. They recog
nize the sun’s two “houses” in which it rises for a period of time at the ex
tremes of its sojourn along the horizon, around the time of the solstices. A
visitor might be told, for example, that the sun enters its southern house in
the first half of month five and leaves it again in the first half of month six.
A future archaeologist, on discovering evidence of the existence of such ob
servations, might well conclude that the Mursi had developed a horizon
based solar calendar. However, as we know, the sun cannot, for example, al
ways enter its house in the first half of a month, since the lunar phases fall
differently in each solar year. When pressed on the issue, the Mursi special
ists admit that the sun can sometimes be early or late in its movements along
the horizon. The behavior of the sun, in other words, is viewed as no more
reliable a seasonal indicator than that of animals, plants, and the weather.
The lunar calendar remains intact.
Despite the haphazard nature (to an outsider) of the Mursi calendar, it
works well enough for nearly all of the year. There is, however, one event
that must be timed critically. This is the time of migration to the banks of the
Omo. The river floods its banks several times, and the crop of cowpeas must
be planted within a few days of the final flood; otherwise, if planted too late,
the seeds will be too dry to germinate or, if planted too early, they will be
washed away by the subsequent flood. How do people know the right time
to move away from their bushland clearings down to the river? The answer
is: by observing the successive disappearance of four stars in the evening twi
light. The stars in question are the middle two stars of the Southern Cross (›
and ‹ Crucis) and the Pointers (‹ and ¤ Centauri), which are more or less in
a straight line falling vertically to the horizon at the latitude (close to the
equator) where the Mursi live.
The successive disappearance (heliacal setting) of the four stars coin
cides with the time of year of the Omo floods, which are very regular. When
imai (› Crucis) ceases to appear in the evening sky at dusk (around the end
of August), it is said that the Omo rises high enough to flatten the imai grass
that grows along its banks, and then subsides. This is followed a week or
two later by the disappearance of thaadoi (‹ Crucis) when the Omo rises
and falls but does not yet reach its full height. By the time that waar (‹ Cen
tauri) disappears, the Omo (for which the Mursi name is waar) has risen to
its full height and has flooded the levee forest along its banks. Finally, as
sholbi (¤ Centauri) disappears from view (around the beginning of Octo
Mursi Calendar 275
Pure Mathematical Physics



ber), the flood waters finally recede, carrying away the fallen petals of the
sholbi (acacia) tree. Planting can now proceed down to the water’s edge.
To us it might seem that the successive disappearance of these four stars
simply provides a practical rule of thumb that helps to determine when the
move to the river bank should take place. But the use of common terms for
stars and terrestrial objects indicates deeper associations in the minds of the
Mursi, direct connections that tell us something of their worldview. For
them, the behavior of the Omo is understood in relation to other factors in
the natural world, both terrestrial and celestial. It is this knowledge of the
world that is being applied in order to determine when to move down to the
banks of the Omo and begin planting.
The Mursi example serves to undermine virtually every generalization
we might try to make about calendrical development. If people have a basic
lunar calendar, so the argument goes, in which they count off months ac
cording to the changing phases of the moon, then they must inevitably no
tice that it soon gets out of step with the seasons. Whether their annual cy
cle consists of twelve or thirteen months, they will find themselves adding or
subtracting intercalary months to keep the lunar calendar in phase with the
seasons, at first on an ad hoc basis, and then, if they progress beyond this
point, more systematically. The Mursi example shows how a basic lunar cal
endar, without intercalation, can work perfectly well through the mechanism
of institutionalized disagreement. Another common assumption is that if
people observe the changing position of sunrise or sunset on the horizon,
then they have reached a stage of development at which they recognize that
it is the sun, rather than the moon, that is actually tied to the seasons, and
they are likely to shift to a horizon-based solar calendar. Again, the Mursi
example repudiates this notion completely.
Finally, the direct observation of the four stars to determine the cor
rect time of arrival at the river might also be seen as a developmental step.
It would be easy to conclude that, while the Mursi are haphazard the rest
of the time, in this instance, when it really matters, they are capable of be
ing precise. This would be a misleading conclusion. As far as the Mursi are
concerned, there is a direct connection between the successive disappear
ance of each star in the evening twilight and the corresponding terrestrial
events. To say that the Mursi are precise when they need to be is missing
the point. It is more correct to say that their understanding of how the
world works is completely different from ours, and yet it is both self-con
sistent and has a predictive capability. It is the application of this knowledge
that successfully prevents the loss of the crop that provides their main food
source for half of the year.
In short, as the Mursi example shows, it is misguided to attempt to
measure the sophistication of an indigenous calendar against any sort of de
276 Mursi Calendar

velopmental yardstick. Instead, we need to try to understand such calendars
in the context of a framework of indigenous knowledge. By doing so, we bet
ter appreciate that knowledge for what it is, and for what it can add to our
appreciation of the richness and diversity of indigenous knowledge in general.
On the last point, a comparison of the Mursi with the nearby Borana, who
have a much more precise but highly unusual luni-stellar calendar, demon
strates very clearly how two communities in similar circumstances, with sim
ilar skies, can nonetheless think and act in completely different ways.

Na Pali Chant
In the Hawaiian islands prior to European contact, people’s awareness and
use of the skies took place within a cognitive framework that combined an
extensive practical knowledge used in long-distance navigation with
strongly developed elements of ritual and ceremony. In this resource-rich
corner of ancient Polynesia, where powerful social hierarchies developed,
religious practices and cosmological principles are reflected archaeologi
cally in sacred landscapes containing a variety of temples and shrines
(heiau) as well as prominent natural places named after celestial objects.
There is also an abundant heritage of oral literature—creation myths and
formal chants recorded after European contact, some of which contain de
tailed astronomical information.
The hula—despite its modern image as public entertainment and
tourist attraction—actually constitutes a very significant aspect of the
Hawaiian oral tradition dating back to pre-contact times. In those days it
took the form of a formal performance involving the recital of a chant
(mele) together with associated bodily movement. Certain types of hula
were deeply sacred. The repertoire in these cases was fixed, with no im
provisation allowed, and the nature and circumstances of their performance
were bound by strict protocols. It is likely that chants of this nature that
were recorded after European contact could have been passed down from
one generation to another, virtually unscathed, for some considerable time.
The following chant, recorded by the ethnographer Nathaniel Emerson
in 1909 (in the days before diacritical marks were added to Hawaiian words
to aid comprehension), may well be in this category:
Hiki mai, hiki mai ka La, e. Aloha wale ka La e kau nei, Aia malalo o Ka-wai-hoa, A ka lalo o Kauai, o Lehua. A Kauai au, ike i ka pali; A Milo-lii pale ka pali loloa.
279
N
Pure Mathematical Physics



E kolo ana ka pali o Makua-iki; Kolo o Pu-a, he keiki, He keiki makua-ole ke uwe nei. (Emerson 1997, p. 114)
“Literal” translations vary, but the following represents a broad consensus:
It has come, it has come; lo the Sun! How I love the Sun that’s on high; Below it swims Ka-wai-hoa, On the slope inclined from Kaua‘i to Lehua. On Kauai met I a pali, A beetling cliff that bounds Milo-lii, And climbing up Makua-iki, Crawling up was Pua, the child, An orphan that weeps out its tale. (Warther and Meech, in Koleva and Kolev 1996, p. 28, following Emerson 1997, p. 114)
According to a legend recorded in 1899, the chant was first performed on
the island of Ni‘ihau by a chief who was possessed by the spirit of Kapo, an
alternative manifestation of the goddess Laka, principal deity of the hula. It
refers to a number of landscape features both on the island of Ni‘ihau and
on the rugged northwestern coastline of Kaua‘i some thirty kilometers
(twenty miles) to the east, which, viewed from the northern part of Ni‘ihau,
stretches for some twenty kilometers (twelve miles) directly away from the
observer. This remote part of Kaua‘i, impassable even by modern roads, is
known as N§ Pali (“the cliffs”), although its deep valleys, deserted today,
are accessible from the sea and had thriving populations in pre-contact
times. Of the places named in the chant, Kawaihoa is a volcanic cone on
Ni‘ihau; Lehua is another volcanic cone forming a separate islet; and
Makua-iki is a point about halfway along the N§ Pali cliffs, with the
Miloli‘i valley close by.
But could the chant be doing more than just describing the landscape?
It is certainly true that Hawaiian chants contained copious quantities of rid
dles and word play, something the whole language lends itself to very nat
urally. Often they also contained a hidden level of meaning, known as
kaona. In 1996, a local resident, Francis Warther, together with astronomer
Karen Meech, suggested the following interpretation of the hidden (kaona)
meaning:
The sun is rising, east. The sun rises to its zenith. We stand on Ni‘ihau island, Sun reflected down from Kaua‘i island. Look towards Kaua‘i; see the cliff.
280 Na Pali Chant
Pure Mathematical Physics



A big cliff that bounds Milo-li‘i valley. The [baby] sun climbing up the cliff named Makua-iki. Alone, it takes five days to return, or eventually climb the cliff and return on its six-month trip to the south. (Warther and Meech, in Koleva and Kolev 1996, p. 28)
According to Warther and Meech, the whole chant was in fact describ
ing a solstitial alignment along the N§ Pali coastline. This could actually be
viewed both ways, and it so happens that at the far (eastern) end of the cliffs
is a large heiau sitting at the foot of a number of terraces leading up to a sa
cred altar dedicated to Laka herself, Ke-Ahu-a-Laka. According to traditions
recorded early in the twentieth century, this was a place where priests or
priestesses of the hula underwent periods of instruction and came to “gradu
ate.” The spot is very sheltered, and only from the very lowest corner of the
heiau can one see along the coast. From this point, the cliffs of Makua-iki can
be seen jutting out into the sea beyond the immediate cliffs, and Lehua ap
pears in the distance a short way along the skyline. The flat northern part of
Ni‘ihau is in the line of sight but lost beneath the horizon.
The chant and its double connection with Laka/Kapo strongly hints
that this alignment in the landscape had a deep resonance for ancient Hawai
ians, notwithstanding the astronomical connection. But what was the nature
of that connection? Archaeoastronomical work has shown that the align
ment may have had as much, if not more, to do with sunrise and sunset on
the days of zenith/antizenith passage of the sun than the solstices. The mo
ment when the sun passed directly overhead was certainly a moment of great
sacred power (mana) for ancient Hawaiians.
The alignment along the N§ Pali cliffs is, of course, naturally occurring
rather than artificially constructed. This does not mean, though, that astro
nomical significance could not have been attributed to it: on the contrary, in
fact. By an accident of nature (as a Western investigator would see it) re
sulting from the process of their geological formation, the highest points of
various islands along the whole Hawaiian chain are quite closely aligned
along an axis pointing toward June solstice sunset in one direction and to
ward December solstice sunrise in the other. Such fortuitous alignments pre
existing in the landscape might not impress a modern astronomer, but from
an indigenous point of view it is difficult to imagine a more direct affirma
tion of the natural harmony between the land and the sky.
It is possible that this so-called N§ Pali chant will stand the test of
time as a rare example of a “documented” ancient alignment. Unfortu
nately, the evidence is very inconclusive. In particular, the freedom with
which double meanings can be expressed in Hawaiian, and with which
kaona meanings can be imagined, cuts both ways, since it gives the mod
ern investigator a great deal of flexibility to postulate much that may not

Nabta Playa
Between about 9000 B.C.E. and 3000 B.C.E., parts of what is now the Sahara
Desert became habitable for periods lasting many centuries, when summer
monsoons reached farther northward than at present. Nabta Playa is a nat
ural basin in southern Egypt, roughly fifty square kilometers (twenty square
miles) in area, where water accumulated in the summer rainy season. It was
a focus for seasonal occupation and settlement over several millennia, in
cluding ritual activities such as the burial of slaughtered cattle in roofed
chambers covered in sandstone blocks. At some time between 7000 B.C.E.
and the final abandonment of the playa in c. 3000 B.C.E., a number of stone
slabs up to three meters (ten feet) in length seem to have been erected over
a area of about three square kilometers (1.5 square miles), including three
alignments several hundred meters long. There is also an oval arrangement
of small standing and recumbent stones about three meters (ten feet) across.
In many respects these stones bear an uncanny resemblance to European
megaliths but predate them, possibly by several millennia.
Surveys of the Nabta “megaliths” by the American archaeoastronomer
Kim Malville in the late 1990s revealed that one of the alignments faced due
east-west, while pairs of small standing stones sighted on opposite sides of

the circle defined two sightlines across it, one oriented north-south and the
other aligned upon sunrise on the June solstice. The circle has accordingly
been dubbed a calendar circle and seized upon by those keen to challenge the
idea that the oldest astronomical alignments must have developed in Europe.
It is certainly true that there are configurations of standing stones in many
parts of the world that have not received the attention lavished upon their
European counterparts. However, the history of the investigations of the Eu
ropean megaliths readily demonstrates the many dangers that await those
overeager to find astronomical alignments and to overinterpret them in the
absence of supporting archaeological evidence.
Nonetheless, it is possible that the alignments at Nabta provide a mod
est but valuable indication of early cosmological beliefs and calendrical prac
tices among nomadic peoples in northeast Africa before the rise of the Egyp
tian kingdom. One suggestion is that climatic change in the fourth
millennium B.C.E. forced these peoples to move north, not only forcing social
change that precipitated the development of the kingdom, but introducing
beliefs and practices that, in a later form, became enshrined in the architec
ture of large temples and pyramids.

Namoratung’a
Namoratung’a II (or Kalokol) is an archaeological site close to Lake
Turkana in northwest Kenya. It consists of a collection of nineteen small
standing stones—basalt pillars—associated with two burial cairns. It
achieved notoriety in the late 1970s as an ancient calendrical site marking
the horizon rising positions in 300 B.C.E. of seven stars and star groups still
used in the present-day calendar of the Borana, who live about three hun
dred kilometers (two hundred miles) to the east.
This interpretation serves as a warning against the dangers of heaping
supposition upon supposition without paying enough attention to the
broader evidence. Before the Borana were revisited by Italian anthropologist
284 Nadir Passage of the Sun
Pure Mathematical Physics



Marco Bassi in the mid-1980s, the only first-hand account of their calendar
was that obtained by the Ethiopian anthropologist Asmerom Legesse around
twenty years earlier. Legesse’s informants had said that successive months
were recognized by the newly sighted crescent moon rising “in conjunction
with” seven successive stars or star groups: Triangulum, the Pleiades, Alde
baran, Bellatrix, Orion’s belt and sword, Saiph, and Sirius. Astronomer Lau
rence Doyle from NASA examined Legesse’s account but could not make as
tronomical sense of it, unless “rising in conjunction” was taken to mean
rising at the same horizon position, that is, in astronomical terms, at the
same declination. The only problem was that this didn’t work correctly in
the present era; however, it would have worked perfectly in around 300
B.C.E. The answer, suggested Doyle, was that the present-day Borana calen
drical system derives from a more ancient calendar set up by Cushitic peo
ples around 300 B.C.E. A survey of alignments between the pillars at the
Namoratung’a II site revealed alignments upon all seven of the Borana stars
and asterisms at their rising points in around 300 B.C.E.
Unfortunately, subsequent reassessments challenged many aspects of
this attractive picture: the actual dating and purpose of the Namoratung’a
stones; their cultural connection with the later Borana; whether the align
ment evidence was statistically significant (there exist a lot of pairwise align
ments between nineteen stones); and whether the measured alignments were
accurate in the first place. Finally, it is difficult to understand why, and how,
the observational principles underlying the Borana calendar could have re
mained static for over two thousand years when they no longer fit the actual
motions of the stars.
Taken together, these problems made the idea that the Borana calendar
was some sort of frozen remnant of a much earlier calendrical system seem
extremely shaky. The house of cards collapsed completely when Bassi’s field
work confirmed that “in conjunction with” should be interpreted as “side
by side with,” in other words, in astronomical terms, “rising at the same
right ascension as.” When properly understood, the Borana system works
perfectly well in the present day.

Nasca Lines and Figures
Few archaeological enigmas have excited so much fanciful speculation as
the lines and figures etched into the desert near Nasca (or Nazca) in south
ern Peru. Few of the theories are scientifically tenable, and many are pure
fantasy. However, behind the speculation lies a unique cultural phenome
non that for almost a century has attracted the attention of scientists and
archaeologists alike.
The coastal strip of southern Peru, which is in effect the northern ex
tension of the Atacama desert in Chile, is one of the most arid and desolate
regions of the world. The landscape here comprises a series of flat desert
plains, or pampas, separated by oasis-like river valleys. Measurable rainfall
occurs on average only once in several years. Rivers are dry for much of the
year, and water is plentiful for a short period only, when the seasonal melt
water flows down from the snow-capped Andes to the east. Yet despite the
severity of the climatic regime, prehistoric societies flourished in the area for
several millennia. Human occupation was concentrated in the valleys, but
cultural activity extended onto the adjacent pampas, where it left a distinc
tive concentration of prehistoric remains.
The small town of Nasca, some four hundred kilometers south of
Lima, is situated in such a valley. A distinctive culture flourished here be
tween the first and sixth centuries C.E., leaving an abundant archaeological
record including a fine and distinctive style of pottery, brightly colorful and
richly decorated. During the centuries before the arrival of the Europeans,
the people who lived in this area also seem to have channeled considerable
efforts into etching monumental drawings on the desert. The Nasca pampa,
an arid plain to the north of the town, covers an area of some two hundred
square kilometers (about eighty square miles) and is covered in a vast array
of long, straight lines, rectangles and trapezoids, labyrinths and spirals. The
greatest concentration of markings is in the northern corner, where a num
ber of large stylized bird and animal figures, as well as less readily identifi
able forms, are also found. The overall impression, as viewed from one of
the many light aircraft that carry tourists over the plain, is one of a giant

sketchpad, much scribbled upon.
The desert surface here is composed of black ferrous oxide pebbles
darkened by oxidation over many centuries. By simply brushing them aside,
a bright yellow sandy soil is revealed beneath. This means that the desert
markings, often termed geoglyphs, are highly susceptible to modern damage.
Merely walking on the pampa is often enough to leave conspicuous foot
prints, which, owing to the lack of precipitation, will endure almost indefi
nitely. Worse still, many of the ancient lines and figures are scarred by deep
ruts created by cars and even large commercial vehicles, which drive across
the open desert in order to avoid paying highway tolls. On the other hand,
there is no great mystery about how the Nasca geoglyphs were created, at
least in principle. Armed with nothing more than a piece of string and a few
sighting poles, a group of six volunteers was able to produce a ten-meter
(thirty-foot-) long straight line ending in a spiral on a nearby pampa in less
than ninety minutes (see photo).
Yet the Nasca markings were more than casual doodles. Some lines run
for several kilometers, remaining dead straight even where they pass over
small hills and dips. The figures, generally too large to be seen for what they
are when standing close by, must have been constructed by scaling up from
a template of manageable size. The enigma lies not in how the etchings were
288 Nasca Lines and Figures

constructed per se, but in the reasons for their construction on such a vast
scale. One suggested motivation for the anthropomorphic figures, which are
clearly visible only from the air, is that they were for the benefit of shamans
“flying” above the figures under the influence of the powerfully hallucino
genic San Pedro cactus. There is actually some evidence to support this spec
ulation: the San Pedro cactus is depicted upon Nasca pottery; images of birds
are very common amongst Nasca artifacts (including, of course, the desert
drawings themselves); and traditional beliefs about the spirit world that sur
vive today have much to do with flying. Be this as it may, it is clear that one
does not need to resort to explanations totally divorced from the cultural ev
idence (such as the suggested existence of hot-air balloons), let alone extra
terrestrial involvement, to provide plausible theories as to why the Nasca
people were motivated to etch vast figures in the desert.
The lines are a more widespread phenomenon than the figures, both in
time and space. Pottery fragments scattered in the vicinity of the geoglyphs
indicate that the figures are attributable to the “Classic” Nasca period, dur
ing the first six centuries C.E., while the lines were created over a longer pe
riod of time. Not only do the lines (as opposed to the figures) cover the
whole Nasca pampa; they also spread off into the valleys, where they be
come obliterated by modern cultivation. Similar lines are known on adjacent
pampas as well as much farther afield. It just happens that on the Nasca
pampa they are exceptionally well preserved, owing to the nature of the sur
face geology.
Survey work has revealed a network of line centers, mostly located
around the edge of the Nasca pampa, with lines of various types radiating
out from them. Some of the lines stop dead, others turn corners and continue
into labyrinths, but some run on, absolutely straight, for up to several kilo
meters, connecting different line centers. They are not pathways, at least not
casual pathways; they are too perfectly straight. So what was their purpose?
The Peruvian archaeologist Toribio Mejía Xesspe, working in the
1920s, was one of the first to suggest a possible interpretation, dismissing
the possibility that the lines were part of an irrigation system in favor of the
idea that they were associated with some form of religious ritual. A decade
or so later the North American geographer Paul Kosok chanced to observe
the sun setting along one of the lines on June 22, the winter solstice in the
southern hemisphere. This single fortuitous observation apparently led him
to the conviction that the Nasca lines had a calendrical function (he later
described them as the “largest astronomy book in the world”), thereby set
ting the seal on an astronomical interpretation that dominated Nasca stud
ies for many years.
It was this interpretation that inspired a young German mathematics
teacher living in Lima, Maria Reiche, to devote a lifetime to studying the
Nasca Lines and Figures 289

lines. A few visits to the pampa convinced Maria that the lines were directed
toward horizon directions where the sun, moon, or stars appeared and dis
appeared; solving the riddle of the mathematical and astronomical meaning
of the lines and figures subsequently became her mission in life. She began
to visit the pampa regularly, living the life of a recluse, spending hours, days,
and weeks walking on the desert and making measurements. Despite Re
iche’s unremitting devotion to the investigation of the lines, which lasted for
the rest of her life (she died in 1998, aged ninety-five), it produced precious
little published hard data. Reiche’s book Mystery on the Desert, which has
run to several editions, concentrates mainly on descriptive material. In 1968,
the astronomer Gerald Hawkins, who had proposed that Stonehenge in Eng
land was an astronomical observatory or computer, visited the pampa and
carried out a statistical examination of the line orientations. His conclusion,
which came as a surprise for many, was that they had no astronomical sig
nificance whatsoever, beyond what might be expected by chance. Although
very different, both these approaches failed in one fundamental respect: they
were divorced from the cultural context. Each, in its different way, was an
intellectual exercise dictated by Western concepts of science and mathemat
ics but unrelated to the rich cultural traditions of pre-Columbian America.
Any meaningful explanation for the Nasca lines needs to be couched in
290 Nasca Lines and Figures

Pure Mathematical Physics



a wider, pan-Andean framework. There is, for example, an evident similar
ity between the network of line centers and radial lines at Nasca and the sys
tem of ceques that arose later at the imperial Inca capital of Cusco. A radial
structure is also evident in the quipu—Andean recording devices consisting
of knotted strings—which it seems natural to lay out so that the strings ra
diate from the single, “primary,” string to which each is attached. Added to
this, ethnographic work has revealed the existence of a number of modern,
traditional Andean villages, some in the vicinity of Cusco but others as far
afield as northern Chile and Bolivia, organized around lines radiating from
a central place such as a plaza or church. Attaching importance to straight
lines radiating from central places is something that emerges in a variety of
cultural contexts in pre-Columbian, historical, and modern South America.
The Nasca lines seem to represent an early manifestation of conceptual prin
ciples attaching significance to radial lines that may have been remarkably
widespread in Andean thought even in pre-Inca times, before becoming in
tegrated into Incaic worldview. Fragments of this principle survive in the
present day in a few modern, remote Andean villages.
What does this suggest about the purpose of the Nasca lines? The Incaic
ceque system, as we know from historical evidence, was a basic organizing
principle of empire, a mechanism of social and political control. Something
similar may have been true at Nasca, at least in later, Incaic times. Post
conquest documents relating to land and water use in the vicinity of the pampa
shortly after the Spanish conquest suggest that a scheme of social organization
not unlike the one that prevailed in Cusco also existed in that region.
The Nasca lines find a counterpart at an elevation of over four thou
sand meters (thirteen thousand feet) in a series of lines high in the Bolivian
Andes. Some of these connect villages to the summits of nearby hills and ap
pear to have been maintained until very recently. In a village southwest of La
Paz, anthropologist Johan Reinhard chanced to witness an annual proces
sion along one such line to a hilltop shrine. Here is a community still main
taining and using a straight line during an important springtime festival. Af
ter dark, the devotees make their way along the line, which is over one
kilometer long. At the summit of a nearby hill, they worship local mountain
gods, petitioning for fertility for animals (which are believed to be owned by
the mountain) and rain for crops. They descend again to the village in the
morning. At similar rituals in other villages there is a sacrificial element,
where offerings are made to mountain gods that involve a llama sacrifice.
Comparable practices took place during the Inca period.
Some of the Nasca line centers are located at higher points on the pre
dominantly flat plain. Others are on the edges of the pampa, and in some
cases lines running up to them from the valleys are still visible. It may well
be, then, that the Nasca lines were meant to be walked upon after all, but in
Nasca Lines and Figures 291

a formal sense—according to strict protocols, at the correct times, and in the
context of the appropriate rituals. In such an arid environment, it is scarcely
surprising that some of these ceremonials may have related to rain and fer
tility. Nor it is surprising, then, that statistical analyses of the line orienta
tions demonstrate a degree of correlation with local directions of water flow.
On the other hand, we should not conclude that there was no connection
with astronomy at all. A few evident alignments, for example on solstitial
sunrise or sunset, may well have been formed as a deliberate part of the gen
eral scheme of things, just as a few of the Cusco ceques seem to have been
astronomically aligned.
In short, there is no simple explanation for the lines and figures on the
pampa. Looking for simple solutions to a mystery and ignoring the wider
cultural context is not the right approach. The Nasca geoglyphs can only
ever be understood by trying to understand more about the totality of that
cultural context viewed, at best, obscurely through a historical haze.

The idea that certain peoples in the past had sophisticated astronomical
knowledge has sometimes been conflated with issues of national identity and
invoked in support of nationalist agendas. This happened most notoriously
when the Nazis used ancient astronomical achievements as part of their
demonstration of supposed Aryan superiority. Apart from the fact that po

a misguided belief that the achievements of past communities can be rightly
judged against our own—a clear manifestation of ethnocentrism. It is quite
different from the proper agenda of archaeoastronomy, which, in common
with many aspects of anthropology and other social sciences, strives to high
light human diversity in order to promote wider understanding of the
breadth of human achievements and tolerance of humanity in general.

Navajo Cosmology
Navajo country stretches across the four-corners region of the U.S. South
west. The bulk of it lies in northern New Mexico and northern Arizona, with
a small part spilling over into southern Utah and the southwestern tip of
Colorado. It is bounded by four sacred mountains: Turquoise Mountain in
the south (Mount Taylor, New Mexico, between Gallup and Albuquerque);
Obsidian Mountain in the north (Hesperus Peak, Colorado, in the La Plata
Mountains); in the west Mount Humphrey, Arizona, one of the San Fran
cisco Peaks near Flagstaff; and in the east by a mountain called Sis Naajíní,
which is probably Blanca Peak, Colorado, in the Sangre de Cristo range.
Navajo territory exists at the center of things, integrated into the cos
mos through a fourfold harmony: four directions, four seasons, four times
of day, four sacred colors, four precious stones, and so on. Each direction is
associated with a different one of the four things in a particular category:
thus, for example, south is associated with the color blue and the middle of
the day. In this four-ness, Navajo cosmology has much in common with the
worldview of other native American groups, but it is fixed geographically by
a particular sacred topography. The four-directional awareness perpetrates
all aspects of life. West, for instance, portrays family life and is associated
with being at home in the evening with the family around the fire. In learn
ing, east is associated with the arts, west with the social sciences, north with
the hard sciences, and south with technical skills. These associations are re
flected in the layout of Diné College (formerly Navajo Community College)
at Tsaile, Arizona.
The relationship between earth and sky is central to Navajo thought.
Father Sky stretches out over Mother Earth: the space in between them is in
habited by living beings that live on top of the earth, and the stars which
adorn Father Sky. The life force of all living and growing things derives from
Mother Earth and Father Sky (or Father Sun).
Navajo Cosmology 293
Pure Mathematical Physics



Various supernatural beings helped create the world, and they inhabit
it alongside ordinary mortal humans. These Holy People can be dangerous
and harmful, but are generally concerned for the welfare of the Earth Sur
face People. The Holy People include First Man and First Woman, who
showed, by building the first dwelling, or hogan, how all hogans should be
constructed, modeling the cosmos in various ways in order to ensure the
well-being of their inhabitants. Black God was responsible for placing the
stars in the sky—by some accounts helped by First Man and First Woman.
Dilyéhé (the Pleiades) were his own stars. Each time he stamped his foot,
they moved up his body until they finally settled on his forehead. The crys
tals that would form the other stars were carried in his pouch, or in some
versions of the story, in a blanket. Black God carefully placed various stars
in the sky: Fire Star (Polaris), Revolving Male (Ursa Major), Revolving Fe
male (Cassiopeia), First Slim One (Orion), Man With Legs Ajar (Corvus),
First Big One (head of Scorpius), and Rabbit Tracks (tail of Scorpius).
These principal constellations not only lit up the night in the absence of
the moon, but also invoked stories and reinforced social laws, confirming
principles of orderly behavior needed to ensure that the community as a
whole would survive and flourish. Thus the sight of Revolving Male and Re
volving Female turning continuously around Fire Star set an example to be
followed: only one couple should live in a single hogan and cook over the
same fire. This served to emphasize the importance of family responsibilities
and to reinforce the social convention that sons-in-law should avoid looking
their mothers-in-law in the face. Rabbit Tracks directed social behavior in a
different way, by means of its seasonal patterns of appearance and disap
pearance, which defined the periods when hunting was permitted.
According to the legend, Black God placed Dilyéhé in the sky close to
First Slim One, then rested. At this time, Coyote was allowed to place one
star in the south. But Coyote was a trickster. He seized the pouch or blanket
containing the rest of the stars and flung them across the sky. This is why
most of the stars are chaotic. In this way, the Navajo creation story neatly
explains both order and disorder in the heavens.
A distinctive artifact of Navajo culture is the sandpainting or dry paint
ing. These paintings have a life and power of their own. Creating one is a
formal affair carried out according to strict protocols. When completed, the
painting functions (in the context of the appropriate ceremonial) to call su
pernatural beings and focus their healing powers, for example, in curing sick
or injured people. Navajo sandpaintings depict a variety of living beings and
Holy People. A number contain recognizable star groups within representa
tions of the sky, for example in the body of Father Sky.
In sum, the cosmos in general, and the sky in particular, pervades
everyday life for traditional Navajo people. The night sky with its key con

stellations serves as a text, underlying stories that chanters elaborate during
ceremonials (each in their own way, resulting in many variants). Elements
of Najavo worldview are also reflected in a variety of ways in material cul
ture, for example in the design of the hogan and in the content and use of
sandpaintings.

Navajo Hogan
Traditionally, Navajo families do not live in concentrated villages but in
homesteads scattered about in the landscape. The traditional family
dwelling is known as a hogan (or hooghan). Today Navajo families may
live in separate houses or caravans, but the hogan remains the sacred
dwelling, a place of instruction, healing, or simply a quiet refuge.
Round or octagonal in shape, the hogan is built in accordance with
strict cosmological principles. The doorway, for example, always faces east,
toward the rising sun. The roof reflects the sky, the walls reflect the sur
rounding trees and mountains, and the earth floor reflects the earth as a
whole. Four poles are placed in the four cardinal directions, reflecting the
overall structure of the cosmos. Different quarters of the hogan are used for
different activities: everyday crafts and handiwork in the south, telling sto
ries and entertaining visitors take place in the west, sacred activities (such as
preparing masks for ceremonials) in the north. Movement within the hogan,
between these different areas, is sunwise.
In short, the hogan is a reflection of the world as a whole—a micro
cosm. As a result, its occupants, while occupying their home, are also occu
pying the whole cosmos, at harmony with all things, and hence assured long
life and happiness.
There is a lesson here for archaeologists who might seek to interpret
orientation trends among older dwellings for which we have no historical or

modern informants to interpret their meaning. If, as archaeologists of the fu
ture, we measured the orientations of a group of Navajo hogans, we might
find their entrances facing a spread of directions within the range of horizon
where the sun rises at some time during the year. If we then became preoc
cupied with questions such as “which day of the year did the sun rise directly
in line with the entrance of a particular hogan?” and “was a hogan built to
face sunrise on the day of its construction?,” we might lose sight of the
broader questions and meanings that really mattered to the Navajo people.
“East” is the quarter of the world—that part of the horizon—where the sun
shines in at some time of the year. Hogans face “east,” and that may be all
that matters. Even if there is more, Navajo elders may never wish to tell us,
and the archaeological record may never reveal it.

Navajo Star Ceilings
Certain stars and constellations that were of particular cultural signifi
cance can be recognized in Navajo sandpaintings, rock art, and certain
portable artifacts such as gourd rattles used in sacred ceremonies. Small
crosses representing stars are also found painted on the ceilings of rock
shelters and on horizontal, downward-facing surfaces of rock overhangs.
Over seventy-five examples are known, concentrated mainly in the Canyon
de Chelly area of Arizona. They contain anything from a single star to
more than two hundred, sometimes mixed with other elements such as
stylized birds or dragonflies.
According to Navajo myth, Black God, who put the stars in the sky,
only had the chance to place a few carefully before the rest were flung across
the sky haphazardly. As a result, only a few bright stars and constellations
are important to the Navajo; the rest are regarded as random. Some of these
constellations are depicted on certain Navajo artifacts, but the important
thing was to identify them rather than to represent their shape literally (as
we would see it). Thus where Dilyéhé (the Pleiades) are represented on
masks of Black God, the seven dots do not reflect the actual form of the con
stellation in the sky.

Star ceilings, it seems, do not even depict actual stars. Though there are
inviting scatters of stars on many ceilings, attempts to identify particular
constellations are unconvincing. A number of ceilings have the stars
arranged in regular rows; others are as much as twenty meters (sixty-five
feet) above the ground, totally out of reach. The stars were likely placed
there by using bows to fire “arrows” carrying paint-covered stamps—a
process that could not have resulted in great precision.
What were star ceilings for? In Navajo thought, stars are regarded as
beneficent supernatural beings (Holy People) who can restore well-being in
times of misfortune. A likely answer, then, is that the stars had a restorative
or protective role. Perhaps the act of painting of a ceiling created a place
a shrine—where the healing power of the stars could be harnessed through
the performance of the appropriate rites. Another suggestion is that they cre
ated a supernatural presence within a dangerous place to protect people
nearby against disasters such as rock-falls. These and other possibilities are
not mutually exclusive.
In short, it seems that stars on Navajo star ceilings were symbols con
veying the stars’ protective power rather than literal depictions of stars. This
example cautions against jumping to “literalist” conclusions, especially where
we do not have access to the cultural evidence that could counter them.

Navigation
One of the obvious ways in which ancient peoples may have made practi
cal use of astronomy was in finding their way through unknown territory,
where they could not rely on familiar landmarks. Of course travelers in the
past could always attempt to identify a succession of distinctive places and
landscape features, preferably ones that were clearly visible from some dis
tance along the route. However, in some circumstances—in great plains,
deserts and tundra, and especially at sea—these were scarce or nonexistent.
In such situations, the sky can be critical in maintaining a course and, for
longer journeys, indicating the current location.
There are obvious broad indicators of direction: the easterly sunrise,
the westerly sunset, or (in locations north of the tropics) the northerly-fac
ing shadows cast by upright objects in the midday sun (in locations south of
the tropics, the shadows are southerly-facing). However, these only provide
crude indications, since the rising and setting points of the sun depend upon
the time of year, and the midday shadow technique presupposes the means
to accurately determine the time of local noon.
Stars provide a more direct and more accurate means of determining di
rections. Any given star, viewed from a particular place, always rises and sets
at the same point and follows the same path through the sky. By acquiring a
knowledge of guiding stars whose rising or setting positions mark different
directions, it is possible to build up a mental star compass. In practice, ad
verse weather conditions can create difficulties, so the more stars a traveler
knows, the better. Another problem is extinction, the dimming of a star close
to a low horizon as its light is absorbed by the earth’s atmosphere. Deter
mining direction by using stars that are already high in the sky, on the other
298 Navigation

hand, is complicated by the fact that the direction depends on the altitude
above the horizon, something that is itself generally difficult to determine ac
curately. This only ceases to be a problem close to the equator, where the ce
lestial bodies rise and set almost vertically.
From anywhere on earth, there is one point in the heavens whose di
rection is unchanging: the celestial pole. The north celestial pole, visible to
observers north of the equator, is marked by the Pole Star, Polaris (although,
owing to the steady drift in the position of the pole due to precession, this
was not the case before modern times). Observing this star, whatever the
time of night and the time of year, gives a direct indication of due north to
within about a degree (since Polaris is not quite at the celestial pole). Ob
servers in the southern hemisphere have no such bright star to mark the
south celestial pole, but a good knowledge of the star formations that sur
round it, such as the Southern Cross, can be used to obtain quite a good es
timate of its position and hence of the direction of due south.
Voyagers who traveled significant distances to the north or south
would have begun to notice the changing appearance of the sky with lati
tude. The altitude of Polaris, for example, is a direct indication of the lati
tude for an observer north of the equator. Even without instruments, trav
elers in tropical latitudes can estimate their latitude north of the equator by
such techniques as holding a finger or hand at arm’s length to estimate the
angle of Polaris above a level horizon. Another way of keeping track of
one’s latitude is to identify the stars that pass across the zenith, the point di
rectly overhead.
The value of navigation by the stars is most obvious in the open sea,
where there are no terrestrial points of reference and distances traveled can
be great indeed. The most impressive feats of navigation in the past were un
doubtedly those of the ancient Polynesians, who successfully discovered and
colonized innumerable islands, most of which were mere dots in the vast ex
panse of the Pacific Ocean. The Polynesian navigators used a combination
of astronomical observations and other techniques. Estimating one’s longi
tude is much trickier than estimating latitude, since it involves relating the
appearance of the sky to the time of night and the time of year. It is gener
ally easier to use other means, such as dead reckoning: estimating the dis
tance traveled in order to compute the current position. A method of locat
ing known islands was to reach the appropriate latitude and then sail due
east or west, using means such as ocean currents or the appearance of cer
tain birds to indicate that land was close.
Navigation by land using the stars is much less well documented. For
example, despite the vast and open nature of much of the landscape of cen
tral Australia, there is little or no evidence of Aboriginal groups—despite
their detailed knowledge of the skies in other ways—using the appearance of

the skies for navigation purposes at night. Inuit groups, on the other hand,
made extensive use of both the sun and stars for wayfinding in the Canadian
Arctic.

Navigation in Ancient Oceania
The Pacific Ocean is so huge that it covers a third of the earth’s surface and
is larger in area than all of the world’s continents put together. When James
Cook led the first scientific expeditions to the Pacific in the mid-eighteenth
century, he was staggered to discover that small and widely dispersed is
lands spread over thousands of miles were not only inhabited, but by peo
ples who spoke essentially the same language. In this way, Polynesia became
recognized as the most widespread nation in the world, dispersed over an
area that—if shifted to the other side of the world—would simultaneously
encompass London, Vladivostok, and the southern tip of India. The islands
of Micronesia and Melanesia in the western Pacific, generally closer to the
Asian continent, were also inhabited prior to European contact, but by a
mixture of different ethnic and linguistic groups.
Ever since 1520, when Ferdinand Magellan sailed west into the un
known ocean from the tip of South America, arriving in the Philippines with
a starving crew nearly four months later, Europeans had known of the exis
tence of (as one of Magellan’s chroniclers described it) “a sea so vast the hu
man mind can scarcely grasp it” (Beaglehole 1974, p. 109). For another two
and a half centuries before Cook’s expedition, long-distance trading ships
occasionally stumbled upon Pacific islands and to their complete bewilder
ment found them occupied by thriving communities. Having themselves only
recently developed the technology to build ocean-spanning ships, the Euro
peans were simply unable to comprehend how Stone Age people, traveling
in canoes built using stone tools and with no navigational devices, could pos
sibly have got there first.
So how did Polynesian and other Oceanic peoples come to colonize
300 Navigation in Ancient Oceania
Pure Mathematical Physics



such tiny pieces of land in a vast ocean? The navigators must have explored
widely in order to locate them in the first place. They must have been confi
dent of finding them again, in order to bring boatloads of people, tubers, and
animals. And they must have been sure of returning repeatedly in order to
maintain communications. Ocean-going canoes were large and generally
double-hulled or with outriggers. Their sails were woven from pandanus
leaves (rather like bulrushes) and their ropes manufactured from coconut
husks. Polynesian canoes typically used a distinctive crab-claw-shaped sail,
wider at the top than the bottom, which enabled them to catch the wind con
tinuously, even in quite heavy swells. Nonetheless, longer journeys would
still have taken several weeks. During the 1960s, it was seriously proposed
that the Pacific had been colonized by luck rather than by skill. However,
this always begged many questions, such as why people left safe islands and
sailed off into the unknown, taking all their possessions with them, unless
they were forced; and what proportion of the voyagers (surely large) per
ished at sea, making no landfall. The idea of accidental colonization was
firmly laid to rest by the construction in the 1970s of H∂k£le‘a, a tradi
tional-style Polynesian canoe, reconstructed as authentically as possible and
sailed without a compass or any other modern instruments. Between 1975
and 2000, H∂k£le‘a made several successful voyages between the farthest
corners of Polynesia.
Polynesia stretches from the Hawaiian islands in the north to Aotearoa
(New Zealand) in the west and tiny, isolated Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in the
east. The idea that Polynesia was colonized by people drifting westwards
from South America, famously championed by the Norwegian explorer
Thor Heyerdahl in the 1950s following the successful voyage of the balsa
wood raft Kon Tiki from Peru to the Tuamotus, is completely refuted by a
range of archaeological and linguistic evidence. This shows conclusively
that Polynesians ultimately derived from south-east Asia. As early as the
second milennium B.C.E., peoples characterized by a distinctive type of pot
tery (Lapita ware) had spread out along the islands of Melanesia to reach
the central Pacific islands of Tonga, Samoa, and Fiji. Distinctively Polyne
sian characteristics developed here in the central Pacific, and these Polyne
sians subsequently moved eastward to the Society Islands, Marquesas, and
Tuamotus, and finally dispersed to the farther islands. The chronology is far
from certain, but the Society Islands and Marquesas had probably been set
tled by about the year 0, Hawai‘i and Rapa Nui by C.E. 400, and Aotearoa
by C.E. 900.
One problem remains. The assortment of domestic animals and staple
crops dispersed by the Polynesians to their many islands included the sweet
potato, which comes from the Andes. It seems almost ludicrous to suppose
that—as a one-off occurrence at a remarkably early date, before the main
Navigation in Ancient Oceania 301

Polynesian expansion—a canoe managed somehow to travel halfway across
the Pacific from central Polynesia and happen across South America, to col
lect the vital tubers, and to successfully return with them. Surely, some have
argued, there must have been more prolonged contact, a period when regular
voyaging took place across the Pacific, and when regular contact may even
have been made with other parts of the Pacific rim. Others take the view that,
since the island societies went on to develop in such different ways, any reg
ular contact between distant groups of islands was relatively short-lived.
Be this as it may, regular long-distance voyages of anything over a few
hundred kilometers had essentially vanished by the time of European con
tact. Nonetheless, we know a remarkable amount about Polynesian naviga
tional astronomy from the survival of various oral traditions, many recorded
in the early years after European contact. Polynesian navigators enjoyed spe
cial status. One of the most famous contacts made by Cook on his first voy
age in the Endeavour was with a Tahitian navigator, Tupaia. Tupaia could
name scores of islands in central Polynesia, specifying (with remarkable ac
curacy) the direction and distance of each. While the practice of traveling
these distances had apparently died out, the knowledge of how to do it had
remained, as was demonstrated when Tupaia subsequently sailed away with
Cook in the Endeavour.
Our fragmentary knowledge of Polynesian and Micronesian navigation
techniques owes much to a succession of ethnographers and cultural inform
ants as well as to the experimental voyagers who have researched, and at
tempted to use, traditional navigation techniques. Their achievement in ac
quiring and preserving much of what we do know is all the more impressive
given that navigational knowledge was often sacred and known only to a very
few privileged experts, who were reluctant to reveal it to outsiders. Through
out Oceania, navigators were highly respected people and generally had high
social status. Tupaia was a priest, formerly a chief. In Tonga, knowledge of
navigation was the preserve of specialist families who had chiefly rank.
Astronomy was crucial in navigation. By day, direction-finding had to
depend upon the sun, the winds, currents, and swells. The presence of an is
land not far beyond the horizon could sometimes be detected from cloud for
mations or the appearance of certain birds. By night, there were the stars. For
relatively short journeys to familiar destinations, one could learn the succes
sion of rising or setting directional stars that marked a desired course. More
effectively for general use, the navigator could commit to memory a so-called
star compass, a mental image of the rising and setting positions around the
horizon of key stars and star groups, some of which would be visible not too
far above the horizon at any particular time. One of the best-documented star
compasses derives from the Caroline Islands in Micronesia.
Techniques were also needed to determine the current position. From a
302 Navigation in Ancient Oceania
Pure Mathematical Physics



Western perspective it seems natural to determine the latitude by estimating
the altitude of the relevant celestial pole above the horizon. This is facilitated
in the northern hemisphere by the presence of the bright star Polaris close to
the pole. Its height above the horizon can be estimated, for example, by
holding out a hand at arm’s length. Another method is to observe which
stars pass across the zenith. Determining one’s longitude, on the other hand,
is extremely tricky without instruments. But Oceanic navigators did not
think in terms of latitude and longitude. Instead, it seems that they employed
(what seem to us) highly ingenious and (to our way of thinking) very strange
techniques for dead reckoning—determining the absolute distance traveled.
This, in combination with a knowledge of the direction of travel, is sufficient
to specify the present position.
The colonization of the Pacific was achieved, as far as we know, with
out any tools apart from the navigator’s own body and brain. The only sug
gestion of the use of what one might call “navigational instruments” comes
from Hawai‘i, where there is some evidence for the use of hollowed-out
gourds as star compasses and sextants, but this is a controversial topic.
Why was the Pacific settled? To European sailors of the sixteenth to
eighteenth centuries, this vast ocean was a terrifying void that had to be
crossed out of commercial necessity. Whatever motivation prehistoric peoples
had had for setting out across it in no more than dugout canoes was simply
unimaginable. The ancient Polynesians and other Oceanic peoples, however,
thought very differently. To them, this great sea was the world: “a familiar,
life-giving world . . . strewn with fertile islands on which they could settle,
plant their taro, bananas, and other crops, and raise their children” (Finney
1994, p. 3). It is only by starting to appreciate the second of these contrast
ing worldviews that we can even begin to understand their motivations.

Nebra Disc
In 2002, a spectacular discovery came to the world’s attention. It had been
made three years earlier in the region of Sachsen-Anhalt in central Ger
many, close to the small town of Nebra, thirty-five kilometers (twenty-two
miles) southwest of Halle, at the summit of a 250-meter (800-foot) hill
known as the Mittleberg. Here, inside a pit within a palisaded enclosure
dating to the Bronze Age, treasure hunters unearthed a disc thirty-two cen
timeters (thirteen inches) across, about the size of a dinner plate, made of
arsenic-rich bronze. On one side was a decorative pattern of inlaid shapes
in thin plate gold. Although corroded and slightly damaged, the original ap
pearance of the pattern is clear enough. To one side of the center was a cir
cle of gold, occupying about a tenth of the whole area. There was also a
crescent of comparable size, and three bands in the shape of curved arcs,
two of which were placed along the rim on opposite sides, while the other
follows a tighter curve, with only its central part touching the rim. The re
maining space contained thirty-two smaller dots, scattered unsystematically
but generally filling it reasonably evenly, apart from one group of seven
dots placed noticeably closer together.
Few could fail to imagine, on first sight of the disc, that these were
meant as representations of celestial objects. The crescent moon is obvious;
the complete circle could be interpreted either as the sun or the full moon.
The fact that there are seven stars in the cluster invites suggestions that it
portrayed the Pleiades, one of the most conspicuous groups of stars in the
sky. However, the pattern on the disc does not bear any close resemblance to
the actual pattern of those stars in the sky—it was not a literal depiction.
304 Nebra Disc
Pure Mathematical Physics



Nebra Disc 305
The Nebra disc. (Kenneth Garrett/National Geographic Image Collection)
Pure Mathematical Physics



Likewise, the disc as a whole was clearly not a literal depiction of the sky.
The sun (or full moon) and crescent moon are vastly out of proportion, and
the majority of the stars are clearly space fillers.
Could the disc have functioned as some sort of star map or astronom
ical aid? A number of detailed and highly speculative theories have been put
forward, but the strongest evidence in support of this proposition comes
from the two golden arcs along opposite rims. Their lengths are almost iden
tical, and each covers almost exactly eighty-three degrees, which at the lati
tude of Sachsen-Anhalt matches the extent of the eastern and western hori
zon over which the sun rises and sets, respectively, during the year.
Furthermore, the location where the disc was found may well have had cal
endrical significance. From this location, the Brocken, the highest mountain
in northern Germany, is visible on clear days eighty-five kilometers (fifty
three miles) away on the northwestern horizon and is in the direction of sun
set on the summer solstice. This has led some to suggest that the disc had a
practical use as a device for fixing the time of year by observing the position
of sunrise or sunset along the horizon. However, this makes no sense. There
are no reference points on the disc, whereas the distant horizon, like any
horizon, was full of distinguishing features that could have been used di
rectly to identify different days in an agricultural or ceremonial calendar.
Even those who have sought hardest to find a pragmatic function for
the disc tend to acknowledge that the third curved arc, touching the “south
ern” part of the rim (the left side in the photo), presents a problem. Some say
that it resembles a ship sailing through the night: tiny lines on the upper and
lower edges might even represent oars. If this interpretation is correct, then
the whole disc may depict a legend relating to a ship sailing under the stars,
or perhaps sailing through the sky. More speculatively, it could represent a
myth in which the sun is transported from the western to the eastern hori
zon during the night in a ship. On the other hand, if the disc is held the other
way up, the mysterious curve may simply be a rainbow.
How can we resolve the apparent contradiction between the interpre
tation of the disc as a portrayal of a cosmic myth and the apparent exacti
tude of the sunrise and sunset horizon arcs? If we interpret the disc as a rep
resentation of the cosmos, there is not necessarily any contradiction.
Indigenous worldviews commonly incorporate (on an equal footing) aspects
that we would see as purely mythical and aspects that we would see as re
flecting scientific actuality, sometimes observed with impressive exactitude.
Many indigenous cosmologies assign distinct sets of meanings and attributes
to the “quarters of the world” represented by a fourfold partitioning of the
horizon around the solstitial directions. (Two of the dots, or stars, on the Ne
bra disc were actually found underneath one of the rim bands, which implies
that these were added as an afterthought or later elaboration.)
306 Nebra Disc
Pure Mathematical Physics



Unlike the Bush Barrow gold lozenge, another Bronze Age artifact for
which detailed but highly speculative astronomical interpretations have been
put forward, the Nebra disc indisputably contains astronomical/astrological
symbols. On the other hand, to think of the disc as a portable star map is
probably wide of the mark. It was more likely a remarkable status object of
aesthetic rather than practical value, owned by someone with considerable
prestige. As a representation of the cosmos it may well have been an object
of considerable sacred power.

Necker Island
Necker Island is one of the farthest flung of the Hawaiian islands, an iso
lated rocky outcrop protruding above sea level more than five hundred kilo
meters (three hundred miles) to the northwest of the main islands in the
chain. It is certainly not habitable. It is totally exposed, without fresh wa
ter or a natural harbor. It is only some twelve hundred meters (four thou
sand feet) from end to end and comprises a single narrow ridge, little more
than a hundred meters (three hundred feet) at its widest, falling (often pre
cipitously) down to the sea on both sides. And yet, staggeringly, it is cov
ered in no fewer than thirty-four temple platforms. It has been suggested
that a shipwrecked party may have been stranded here, building a succes
sion of shrines to appease the gods while surviving by catching trickles of
rainwater and snaring birds. A more likely, although still extraordinary, ex
planation is that Polynesians came here deliberately and repeatedly, evi
dently in significant numbers, risking life and limb to construct one temple
after another in this remotest of places. Why?
One reason might have been that the island was regarded as a highly
sacred place. Its traditional name in Hawaiian is Moku-manamana, which
has been taken by some to mean “the island with a great deal of sacred
power.” Unfortunately, more than one translation is possible: the name may
simply have meant “branching island.” In any case, this does not in itself tell
us why Necker might have been regarded as so sacred.
Archaeology does not provide clear answers; it poses more questions.
The Hawaiian archaeologist Kenneth Emory, who visited the island in the
1920s, noted that the design of the rectangular temples on Necker bore a
striking resemblance to the marae of central Polynesia, even though those is
Necker Island 307
Pure Mathematical Physics



lands were thousands of kilometers more distant than the other Hawaiian is
lands. In addition, a number of images of male faces carved out of stone,
found on one of the platforms, are similar to stone idols found in the Mar
quesas, but are quite unlike anything found elsewhere in Hawai‘i. It is pos
sible, then, that the activities on Necker have a very early origin, dating to
an erstwhile phase of long-distance Pacific exploration preceding many cen
turies of cultural developments in Hawai‘i prior to European contact. In the
absence of firm archaeological dating evidence, however, the question re
mains an open one.
Studies of the orientations of the temple platforms on Necker by the as
tronomer William Liller have shown that as many as nine are broadly
aligned with the December solstice sunrise and June solstice sunset. How
ever, as this is generally in line with the orientation of the ridge, this does not
in itself provide conclusive evidence that these alignments were intentional.
A more controversial but also intriguing astronomical explanation has
to do with the latitude of Necker Island—23°35' N. There is reasonable ev
idence to suggest that Polynesians—and Hawaiians in particular—had a
keen interest in the passage of the sun through the zenith—the highest point
in the heavens. At any location in the tropics, the sun passes through the
zenith on two different days in the year, the actual dates depending on the
latitude. The Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn represent the limits of this
region. At a location on the Tropic of Cancer, the sun passes directly over
head on only a single day in the year, the June solstice. Necker Island lies
almost exactly on the Tropic of Cancer, whereas the larger Hawaiian is
lands lie farther southwards, well inside the tropics. Could Necker’s sacred
significance have been because it lay on this limit—the symbolic limit of
Polynesia?
The two Tropics are, in fact, drifting gradually closer together owing to
the slow decrease in the obliquity of the ecliptic. Necker was just within the
tropics (located just south of the Tropic of Cancer) before about C.E. 900.
Then at around this time the Tropic passed by on its course southwards.
Thereafter the zenith sun could be seen from the island no more. Could the
sacred power of the island have been at its greatest when the island was pre
cisely on the tropic, and quickly waned thereafter? Such an idea is not in
consistent with the broader chronological evidence: in around C.E. 900 it is
possible that Polynesians were regularly voyaging over long distances in the
central Pacific. However, all this assumes that people were interested in de
termining the zenith passage of the sun very precisely, and for this there is no
direct supporting evidence.
If achieving such a high level of precision were not an issue, then the
idea that Necker was sacred because it marked the limit of the zenith sun
would fit with a wider range of dates. In this case, it may be relevant that
308 Necker Island
Pure Mathematical Physics



unusually large numbers of temple platforms are also found on some islands
close to the Tropic of Capricorn south of the equator, although the concen
trations are nowhere near as dramatic as on Necker. However, it may not be
necessary to imagine such a specifically astronomical motivation at all. It
may be that Necker’s sacredness derived simply from its extreme location
an end place beyond which there were no more habitable islands.

Newgrange
Newgrange is one of three large Neolithic passage tombs that are found
within three kilometers of one another on the northern side of the river
Boyne west of Drogheda, County Meath, in central Ireland. It incorporates
one of the most famous astronomical alignments in the world. Around the
shortest day every year, just after sunrise, a shaft of sunlight suddenly en
ters the tomb and shines directly down the long passage, penetrating right
through to the central chamber for a precious few minutes before, equally
swiftly, it plunges once again into almost interminable darkness.
Newgrange is a supreme example of the passage tomb genre, of which
there are more than three hundred examples to be found across Ireland,
with many more in northern Scotland. Built in the later part of the fourth
millennium B.C.E., it is an enormous mound some eighty meters (260 feet)
across, entered by a passage leading in from an entrance on the southeast
ern side. Almost twenty meters (sixty-five feet) long, with a roof formed of
enormous, flat slabs of rock held up by large, upright side-stones (or
thostats), the passage leads to a central chamber deep within the tomb. This
chamber has an impressive corbelled roof six meters (twenty feet) high and
is so large that several people can stand together inside comfortably. Three
smaller chambers open off the main central chamber, one opposite the en

trance and one on each side. Fragments of human bone, both burned and
unburned, together with animal bones, pendants, beads, and other grave
goods were found within the tomb.
Before Michael O’Kelly began excavations at the site in the early 1960s,
visitors were perplexed by what appeared to be an additional roof slab
above the entrance, apparently a false lintel about one meter (three feet)
higher than the level of the main roof of the passage. This turned out to be
the top of a roof-box above the passage entrance. It is through this roof-box
that the sunlight enters at midwinter. This is not a precise phenomenon: it is
repeated each day for a few days after the solstice, though for a progressively
shorter period of time each day; and likewise (increasing up to the maximum
duration) beforehand. Owing to the changing position of the solstitial sun
over the millennia (due to the changing obliquity of the ecliptic), the shaft of
sunlight would have appeared for somewhat longer, and for a few more
days, at the time when the tomb was built.
There are many beautifully decorated stones at Newgrange, and it has
been suggested that the interplay of sunlight and shadow across various spi
rals, lozenges, and other carvings at certain times of year might also have
been significant to the builders. However, since eye-catching associations of
this nature could easily have arisen fortuitously, such ideas are more contro

versial. Similarly, claims of alignments involving the circle of standing stones
that surround the tomb also remain speculative.
One thing that can be stated with relative certainty, however, is that
Newgrange was not an ancient observatory. It is ludicrous to suggest that
people entered the tomb and sat among the bones of the dead, merely to de
termine whether or not the shortest day of the year had arrived. Frivolous as
this point sounds, it is important in that for many years a number of peo
ple—most famously the Scottish engineer Alexander Thom—claimed that
free-standing megalithic sites that had no other obvious primary function
had been constructed as astronomical observing instruments. In fact, this
theory runs counter to common sense: people in prehistory would clearly not
have gone to all the bother of constructing monumental architecture, even
just one or two standing stones, to do what could be achieved perfectly ef
fectively using non-permanent markers and the natural horizon. Where such
monuments did incorporate intentional astronomical alignments, they ex
pressed what was already known, and there was surely some greater pur
pose. At Newgrange the greater purpose is self-evident: the site was first and
foremost a tomb, or (to use a form of words that better reflects its continual
use over a considerable period) a shrine for offerings relating to the ances
tors. Either way, the solstitial alignment surely expresses some link that ex
isted in people’s minds between the sun, the seasonal cycle, and the ances
tors, although in itself it tells us nothing about the nature of that association.
At some date, possibly many generations after its initial construction,
the entrance was blocked off using a closing stone weighing about a ton.
However, because the critical shaft of sunlight entered through the roof-box
rather than the entrance itself, the solstice hierophany was unaffected. Some
have argued that this was intentional: by using the roof-box device, the
builders ensured that the sun would continue to enter the tomb even after it
had been sealed off. And yet this interpretation brings its own problems: is
it not somewhat surprising that the original builders had the intention—or
at least planned for the possibility—that what was then a dominant practice
would some day come to a sudden end?
In Irish legend, Newgrange tends to be identified as Brug na Bóinne
(“the mansion of the Boyne”), and thereby as the abode of some of the old
gods of Ireland, including one of their principal figures, the Dagda (or
Daghdha). His cauldron, it is said, was the vault of the sky, and this has led
some to propose that the solstitial orientation of the tomb could be a mani
festation of some long forgotten version of this legend. But the connections
are too few and tenuous, and the timespan far too long between Neolithic
times and even the earliest recorded legends in early Christian times, for much
credulity to be attached to any suggestion of a direct continuity of tradition.
What, then, might have been the significance of the alignment? Al
Newgrange 311

though we cannot draw direct parallels, modern indigenous practices can
sometimes give us useful insights in our attempts to interpret practices in the
past. Thus, for example, it was important to the Skidi Pawnee of the U.S.
Midwest that the first rays of the morning sun should enter their traditional
dwelling (“earth lodge”) to bring life-giving strength and power. Could a
similar conviction explain why people in the past appear to have been so in
terested in sunlight entering dark places at special times? This seems evident
at a variety of prehistoric tombs, of which the solstitial alignment at New
grange is merely the most famous. Many of these tombs reflect the structure
of houses for the living in various ways, and it is not unreasonable to sup
pose that they were seen as houses for the dead, or for ancestral spirits. Did
people believe that the light of the sun imparted strength and power to the
ancestors, as it did to them?
The example of Newgrange shows how even a simple, spectacular, and
relatively uncontroversial astronomical alignment can give rise to many sub
tleties of interpretation when we try to explore the nature of its significance
to people in the past.

Heinrich Nissen, professor of history at the University of Bonn, deserves

Greek temples—on which he published his first paper in 1885—to the ori

entations of churches, where he was responsible for demolishing the popu
lar myth that all churches faced (precisely) east. He was an almost exact con
temporary of Sir Norman Lockyer in England, but he anticipated Lockyer’s
own measurements of Egyptian temples. Indeed, Lockyer was dismayed to
discover the existence of Nissen’s published work after returning from his
own first season in Egypt and, when putting forward his own ideas that the
temples were aligned upon the rising and setting of the sun and stars, fully
acknowledged that Nissen had anticipated him in suggesting the possibility.
The fact that Nissen is rarely mentioned in accounts of the early devel
opment of ideas and methods in what subsequently became known as ar
chaeoastronomy, whereas Sir Norman Lockyer is generally considered the
earliest serious pioneer in the subject, is explained by the fact that initial de
velopments in modern archaeoastronomy in the 1960s and 1970s primarily
took place amongst English-speaking scholars. Nissen’s great work on the
subject, the three-volume Orientation: Studien zur Geschichte der Religion,
was published between 1906 and 1910 in German. The first volume ap
peared in the very same year as Lockyer’s seminal Stonehenge and Other
British Stone Monuments Astronomically Considered.

Nuraghi
Nuraghi are tall towers, remarkable because of their scale and the fact that
they are built entirely of dry stone. Found on the Mediterranean island of
Sardinia, they are also remarkable for having been built in extraordinary
numbers. No fewer than seven thousand are known to have been con
structed, during the second millennium B.C.E., on an island measuring no
more than about four hundred kilometers (250 miles) by two hundred kilo
meters (120 miles). They are characterized by a central chamber with a cor
belled roof, often of magnificent proportions. Several have a second cor
belled chamber built directly above the first, and a few have yet a third on

top of that. An example of this last category is Santu Antine, situated some
fifty kilometers from Alghero in the northwest of the island. Its lowest
chamber rises to a height of just under eight meters (twenty-six feet), the
next to over five meters (seventeen feet), and the highest was of compara
ble size but its roof has now collapsed. The remaining tower still stands to
a height of over 17.5 meters (fifty-seven feet). The majority of the nuraghi
were simple towers, but some were elaborated by the addition of a sur
rounding complex of walls, corridors, chambers, and smaller towers. Com
monly, these complex nuraghi—like Santu Antine itself—have a three-fold
symmetry, the compound stretching out to rounded lobes at three corners
of a roughly equilateral triangle; others have four or even five corners.
The function of the nuraghi remains an archaeological puzzle. Astro
nomical associations have been suggested at a number of them, including
solstitial alignments in both directions along two of the three outer walls at
Santu Antine. Alignments between nuraghi may also have been important:
local archaeoastronomer Mauro Zedda has identified a number of solstitial
and also lunar alignments between nuraghi in the vicinity of the town of Isili
in the center of the island. For example, from the now-ruinous nuraghe
Nueddas, the tower of nuraghe Is Paras is prominent on the skyline in the
direction of midsummer sunset, while that of nuraghe Longu marks mid
summer sunrise in a similar way.
However, such alignments can arise by chance—especially considering
the large numbers of nuraghi in the Sardinian landscape—and systematic
studies are clearly needed. Recently such a study has been attempted. It con
centrated upon the orientation along the main axis toward the entrance and
measured this direction at 450 nuraghi from all over the island. The study
concluded that nuraghi are predominantly oriented southeastward and
southward, a pattern that fits an “orientation signature” common among
tombs and temples in western Europe, and in particular applies also to the
tombi di giganti (“tombs of giants”), a type of megalithic tomb attributed to
the same culture that built the nuraghi. Although this pattern corresponds to
a general practice of orientations toward where the sun climbs in the sky, a
strong preference for orientations close to azimuth 150 degrees may be bet
ter explained in relation to the rising of the Southern Cross. This suggestion
appears to be supported by evidence of a gradual orientation change with
time, which would have resulted if monument alignments had followed the
inexorable southward movement of this asterism over the centuries that oc
curred as a result of precession.

Obliquity of the Ecliptic
Obliquity of the ecliptic is not a term that trips easily off the tongue, nor is
it an easy concept to grasp technically. Yet it is vitally important for any
one investigating possible architectural alignments upon the sun, moon, or
planets to take account of the way the obliquity of the ecliptic changes over
the centuries, just as it is necessary for investigations of possible stellar
alignments to take account of precession.
Each day, as the stars and sun move together around the rotating ce
lestial sphere, the sun moves by a small amount against the stars. Only af
ter a full year does it return to the same position, having traced out a path
through the stars known as the ecliptic. The ecliptic is a circle, but it is in
clined at an angle to the daily paths of the stars, which move around on lines
of constant “latitude,” or declination. In particular, if we focus on the ce
lestial equator because it is the one line of constant declination that is also
a great circle (a circle of the largest possible size that can be drawn on a
sphere, its center coinciding with the center of the sphere), then we find that
the angle of inclination between the ecliptic (also a great circle) and the ce
lestial equator is between twenty-three and twenty-four degrees. It is this an
gle that is known as the obliquity of the ecliptic.
At a certain time of year, the sun reaches the northernmost point on the
ecliptic. This is the June solstice, and its declination at this time is approxi
mately 23.5 degrees. Six months later, it reaches its southernmost point: this
is the December solstice, and its declination now is approximately –23.5 de
grees. When the sun crosses the celestial equator, in the spring and autumn,
its declination is 0. These times are known as the equinoxes.
To understand what the obliquity is and hence to understand how it
changes, it is best to switch to the astronomer’s perspective, looking in on
the solar system. The earth, as it orbits annually around the sun, also spins
daily about its own axis. If this axis were perpendicular to the plane of the
earth’s orbit, then the sun would simply appear to us to move around the
celestial equator. But it isn’t. The axis of spin (the earth’s polar axis) actu
317
O

ally leans over by about 23.5 degrees, and this is the reason that the ecliptic
is inclined to the celestial equator by this amount; in other words, it is this
leaning over that gives rise to the obliquity.
Putting to the back of our minds for a moment that it is also orbiting
around the sun, the earth in fact resembles a spinning top, in that it not only
spins daily about its axis, but the axis itself gradually turns, going once
round approximately every twenty-six thousand years. It is this turning that
is known as precession. But a spinning top also wobbles; and so does the
earth. The difference is that a top gradually spins down, so its “obliquity”
gets greater and greater until the top falls over. The tip of the earth’s axis, on
the other hand, oscillates slightly up and down. The obliquity in fact swings
between about twenty-five degrees and about twenty-two degrees over a
timescale of some forty-one thousand years.
The last five thousand years represent a small segment of this cycle.
During this time the obliquity has been gradually decreasing, from approxi
mately 24.0 degrees in 2500 B.C.E. to about 23.5 degrees in the present day.
One practical effect of this is that the ranges over which the rising and set
ting position of the sun swings during the year were somewhat wider in, say,
Neolithic times. In particular, the rising and setting positions of the sun at
the solstices were about one degree (two solar diameters) further away from
each other then than they are now. (The shift is actually in declination: at
higher latitudes, where the rising and setting path is shallower, the shift in
azimuth is greater than this.) This is important in assessing the astronomical
significance of later prehistoric monuments such as Newgrange (Ireland) or
Brainport Bay (Scotland). The rising and setting ranges of the moon and
planets have contracted correspondingly over recent millennia, and it is im
portant for archaeoastronomers to take these changes into account. But for
the moon and planets the effects of the changing obliquity are superimposed
upon much more complex shorter-term variations.
The longer-term cycle of change in the obliquity of the ecliptic be
comes important if it is proposed that much older (Palaeolithic) sites might
have been solstitially aligned. An example of this is Parpalló, a cave in east
ern Spain that was occupied from about 19,000 B.C.E. to 8000 B.C.E. and
into which the light of the sun would have penetrated after sunrise at the
winter solstice.
Another practical effect of the changing obliquity is that the Tropics of
Cancer and Capricorn, and the Arctic and Antarctic circles, move gradually
up and down on the earth. Apart from affecting the size of the tropics and
polar regions, this movement might also have had a direct effect upon
myths associated with, and ritual significance accorded to, places that were
or had been on the tropic. A classic example of this is Necker Island in the
Hawaiian chain.
318 Obliquity of the Ecliptic
Pure Mathematical Physics



In summary, precession causes the rising and setting positions of the
stars to change over the centuries, but it is the change in the obliquity of the
ecliptic that affects the rising and setting positions of the sun, moon, and
planets. Compared with the changes to stellar rising and setting positions
due to precession, the changes in the rising and setting positions of the sun,
moon, and planets due to the changing obliquity are not great, but they do
become significant over a time scale of millennia.

Orientation
Many different factors might have influenced the orientation of an ancient
dwelling house, sacred building, or tomb. Some would have had clear prac
tical benefits. Thus anyone building a house in temperate regions of the
northern hemisphere might well consider orienting its entrance southeast
ward so that the early rays of the sun enter the house and help warm it up
in the mornings. Similarly, it would be beneficial to avoid having entrances
facing into the prevailing wind. Tomb entrances might face downhill so that
water would not run down into them and the interior stayed dry. The pos
sibilities seem almost endless.
But studies of historical and indigenous peoples all over the world re
veal a huge variety of less tangible considerations, such as orienting a tem
ple upon a sacred mountain seen as the dwelling place of a god, or a tomb
in the direction whence ancestors are believed to have come. This “intangi
ble” category includes a range of astronomical considerations, such as align
ing temples and tombs upon sunrise at one of the solstices or the rising point
of a significant star or constellation.
A common reason for choosing particular orientations has to do with
cosmology—people’s understandings and beliefs concerning the nature of
the world—and is motivated by a desire to keep human activity in harmony
with the cosmos to ensure the continuity of life, good health, and so on.
Thus one reason that the traditional earth lodges of the Pawnee face east is
so that every time people enter their home, they do so in the same manner
Orientation 319
Pure Mathematical Physics



the same direction—as the stars enter the sky. To a Western mind this might
amount to little more than superstition, but such considerations are often
bound up inextricably with others that we might consider more pragmatic.
Thus, while some archaeologists argue that the majority of Iron-Age round
houses in Britain faced the rising sun for primarily cosmological reasons,
there would also have been practical benefits in terms of warmth from the
sun in the mornings and shelter from the prevailing wind. Indeed, to the
minds of the time, the distinction we might make between pragmatism and
religious or superstitious belief would not have been a meaningful one. All
these different considerations served the common purpose of sustaining life.
Interpreting the orientations of archaeological structures can be highly
problematic, especially if we only have the material evidence to go on.
Quite simply, everything must point somewhere. The mere fact that some
thing points at what we might consider a prominent topographic feature, or
an important astronomical event, or anything else of apparent significance,
does not mean that this was deliberate. One solution, where possible, is to
seek groups of monuments or buildings that are culturally related and sim
ilar in form and structure (and hence, probably, purpose) and to look for
common trends in their orientation. If a certain pattern emerges strongly
enough, especially if we can obtain a suitable statistical verification, we can
be reasonably confident that a certain set of orientations was deliberate. But
even here there are a number of problems. For a start, we have to be care
ful about data selection. We delude ourselves, and invalidate any statistical
results, if we include a sample of orientations that fit a desired pattern but
exclude others that do not. Secondly, it is quite possible that more than one
factor was important in determining an orientation, and that compromises
may have been reached: consider a culture where the prevailing practice
was to align a temple both upon a sacred mountain and upon the rising sun.
Another problem is that only the most dominant and widespread common
practices will be revealed in this way. People do not act like laws of physics:
even when constrained by the strongest social traditions, people often do
things in their own manner. According to a burial practice recorded among
the Ashanti people of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, for example, the dead are
buried facing away from the village. However, a small percentage of people
believe that the dead turn themselves around in the grave, so they bury their
dead in exactly the opposite direction, facing toward the village. This would
create a tricky problem for an archaeologist of the future trying to make
sense of the orientations of Ashanti graves.
Despite all these difficulties, the approach of looking at groups of sim
ilar monuments has achieved some startling successes. Perhaps the best ex
ample of this is the orientations of later prehistoric tombs and temples in
western Europe, no fewer than three thousand of which have been measured
320 Orientation

and analyzed by the British historian of astronomy Michael Hoskin. There
are a multitude of local groups—distinctive types of stone monument built
in different localities during some two millennia of prehistory—and in nearly
every case the orientations are bunched, clearly intentionally, into a re
stricted range of directions forming a characteristic orientation signature. A
variety of such orientation signatures is encountered. This shows that orien
tation was of near universal importance, although traditions and practices
just like other aspects of the design and construction of the monuments
varied considerably from place to place and time to time.
Even where we do have demonstrably strong and consistent trends such
as these, we cannot always be confident about the motivation. For example,
three quarters of the Early Neolithic long barrows on Cranborne Chase in
southern England face southeast. These might be interpreted as alignments
upon midwinter sunrise until it is realized that their orientation is con
strained by the hill ridges along which the barrows are placed; these tend to
run northwest-southeast as a result of the local geology. And even if we have
few doubts about the intended target, we need to look beyond mere statis
tics—to the social context—in order to infer anything meaningful about
their purpose and significance.

Orion
Except insofar as their visibility and position in the sky is affected by lati
tude and local conditions, the patterns of bright stars are the same for all
human cultures. However, what different people “see” in the sky can vary
enormously from one cultural context to another. First there is the question
of what people notice at all: it is not always the brightest objects. There are
also significant differences in which stars people perceive as grouped to

Pure Mathematical Physics



gether to form constellations, and how people interpret what they see varies
widely. This said, certain configurations of bright stars are so eye-catching
that they have assumed importance in a great range of human cultures. One
of the most obvious is the trapezium of four bright stars with a short line
of three at its center that we know as Orion.
The shape of Orion lends itself very easily to being interpreted as a
person wearing a tunic and belt, especially in temperate latitudes where the
figure is seen upright. Its nightly motion across the sky encourages the idea
the Orion figure is chasing, or being chased by, other characters. Our own
image of the constellation as Orion the hunter derives from Greek tradition,
but the idea of the Orion figure as a male in pursuit of a group of young
women (the Pleiades) can also be found in legends as far afield as Aborigi
nal Australia. A variant is found in Vedic myth, where Orion is the creator
figure Prajapati in pursuit of his daughter Rohini (Aldebaran). Orion’s belt
is an arrow, shot at him from behind by an angered hunter (Sirius). In an

cient China the stars of Orion and Scorpius were two quarreling brothers
who ended up on opposite sides of the sky.
The calendrical importance of a constellation is often inseparable from
the mythology and meaning that attaches to it. In Navajo tradition Orion
was First Slim One, the keeper of the months, whose heliacal phenomena
(along with those of certain other star groups) were used to keep track of
the seasons.
Not all cultures see Orion as a person. Close to the equator, where the
constellation appears on its side, other interpretations are more common.
On Kapingamarangi in the Caroline Islands (Federated States of Microne
sia), for example, it was seen as a canoe house with three men inside. In ru
ral Java, Indonesia, the belt plus three of the four outer stars—Rigel (‹ Ori),
Bellatrix (fi Ori), and Saiph (κ Ori), but not Betelgeuse (¤ Ori)—form the
constellation of the plough, whose annual cycles of appearance and disap
pearance traditionally helped regulate the agricultural year.
Not everyone groups the same set of stars that we see as Orion into a
single constellation. The three stars of Orion’s belt—Mintaka (› Ori), Al
nilam (fl Ori), and Alnitak (ζ Ori)—form a prominent asterism in their own
right: to the Tswana of South Africa, for example, they are three pigs, being
chased by three dogs (a line of three fainter stars that we know as Orion’s
sword). To the Lakota of the United States, the stars of Orion merely form
the central part of a larger constellation, which includes the Hyades and Sir
ius: a large buffalo being born out of an even larger circle of stars.
It is problematic to postulate stellar alignments at prehistoric sites
where the date is uncertain, but plausible alignments upon the three stars of
Orion’s belt have been recognized at a few. One of these is the Thornbor
ough group of henges in Yorkshire, England. It has also been suggested, both
at Thornborough and more notoriously in the case of the three Pyramids of
Giza, that sets of monuments on the ground actually form a spatial repre
sentation of these stars. Such arguments are a lot more problematic because
of the total lack of any convincing evidence for any human society making
constellation maps of this sort. At Giza, for example, the historical context
and the local topography provide a far simpler explanation for the layout of
the three pyramids.
Orion is close to the celestial equator and hence visible at most times of
the year from nearly everywhere on Earth. Yet it was not always so. On a
time scale of centuries and millennia, the position of every constellation
shifts as a result of precession. Orion may be close to the celestial equator
now, but this is just about as far north on the celestial sphere as it ever
reaches. For most of the next twenty-six thousand years, as for most of the
last, it will be situated well to the south, prominently visible in the southern
hemisphere but much less conspicuous in northern latitudes.

Where might we hope to find the earliest signs of human enquiry into the
causes of what we understand as natural phenomena, and what was their
nature? Many different answers may be found in different parts of the
world, and not only in the prehistoric past. But they emerged in the con
text of conceptual frameworks that bear little resemblance to the way that
we classify things we perceive in the natural world according to the West
ern scientific tradition. Within these other frameworks—as in the develop
ment of our own—understanding was not sought as an end in itself but was
inextricably bound up with ideology and religion, myth and ritual, politics
and power, and what to us seem the more practical, everyday aspects of
life—in short, with all aspects of sacred and mundane knowledge and prac
tice. Our own ideas about how people conceived of the world in times and
places where no form of writing had developed, and where no historical ac
count is available, can only be formulated in the context of our knowledge
and theories about human development and behavior in general, and can
only be directly enlightened by what is left to us in the form of material re
mains. Our own interpretations can only be achieved through the filter of
our own cultural background.
The very earliest stages in the development of human thought remain
obscure. Only a few have ventured to explore the development of cognition
on an evolutionary time scale. Physically, the human mind has changed lit
tle since the emergence of Homo sapiens sapiens between about 100,000
and 50,000 B.C.E., although some scholars suggest that certain key develop
ments, such as the ability to communicate using language, had already taken
place some two million years before. By combining ideas from evolutionary
psychology and evidence from palaeolithic archaeology, archaeologist
Steven Mithen has suggested that in the earlier stages of human evolution,
human intelligence was compartmentalized into four separate specialist do
mains—technical, social, natural historical, and linguistic—and these only
came together at the time of transition to the Upper Palaeolithic period,
325
P

around 30,000 B.C.E. This is the time when fine cave-art depictions of ani
mals appeared in western Europe and when the first clear evidence emerges
of decorative items being buried with the dead, although deliberate burial
itself may date back at least to the Neanderthals of the Middle Palaeolithic,
up to 100,000 years earlier. Though controversial, Mithen’s ideas draw at
tention to what is perhaps a key notion in the development of human
thought: the way people come to terms with, and make sense of, themselves
and their environment has much to do with drawing associations between
different things that they perceive in the world around them.
One challenge is to try to trace evidence for the development of certain
fundamental concepts. This is not a trivial matter. No concept seems more
abstract and inviolable than that of number, and yet the anthropologist
Thomas Crump has identified three types of symbolic number, which he
takes to represent three levels of conceptual evolution, and examined their
use in different cultural contexts. This study begins to suggest orders of re
lationship between levels of numerical notation and other aspects of cogni
tion. Nevertheless, it may be inappropriate to try to trace the evolution of
most human concepts in this way; they may simply be different in different
worldviews. For example, Westerners have a concept of direction as some
thing precisely defined: two buildings aligned, respectively, due east and two
degrees south of east would be said to point in slightly different directions.
There is some evidence, on the other hand, that the four directions that are
a common feature of indigenous worldviews in North and Central America
were conceived rather more as (what we would see as) ranges of directions
centered upon (what we would see as) the cardinal points. Wherever possi
ble, we must try to avoid assuming that concepts that seem fundamental to
us are in fact universal and inevitable.
Concepts of measurement have a special place in the development of
thought. These can be recognized in various ways in the archaeological
record. A classic example is a set of carefully manufactured cubical stones
from the city of Mohenjodaro in the Indus valley civilization of c. 2000
B.C.E. The masses of the stones are very close to exact multiples of a unit of
0.836 grams. From this it can be deduced, among other things, that the peo
ple who made and used these stone weights possessed a concept equivalent
to our notion of weight or mass, a concept of modular measure, a hierar
chical system of numeration based on units of four or sixteen, and a notion
of equivalence. Measuring things is one aspect of trying to make sense of
the world. But even this does not in itself tell us anything of how people ex
plained natural phenomena. Such explanations stem from correspondences
that people perceive in the world. The mental process of scientific discov
ery involves bringing together phenomena and concepts that were not pre
viously seen as related.

The Scottish engineer Alexander Thom suggested that a sophisticated
“megalithic science” (although he never himself used this term) existed in
later prehistoric Britain. Thom reasoned that “megalithic man,” as he styled
him, had
a solid background of technological knowledge. Here I am thinking not only of his knowledge of ceramics, textiles, tanning, carpentry, husbandry, metallurgy, and the like, but of his knowledge of levers, fulcrums, foundations, sheerlegs, slings, and ropes. . . . There was also his ability to use boats: he travelled freely as far as Shetland, crossing the wide stretch of open water north of Orkney, as well as the exceedingly dangerous Pentland Firth and the North Channel between Kintyre and Ireland. This involved a knowledge of the tides and tidal currents that rule those waters. (Thom 1971, pp. 9–10)
With this in mind, Thom measured and analyzed the geometrical ground
plans and potential astronomical alignments at several hundred megalithic
monuments (mostly settings of free-standing megaliths such as stone circles
and stone rows) in northern and western Britain. One of his main conclu
sions was that high-precision observations were made of the sun, moon,
and stars using features such as notches and hilltops on distant horizons as
natural foresights against which minute changes in their rising and setting
positions could be measured. There was a “megalithic calendar,” which di
vided the year into eight, or possibly sixteen, equal periods, epoch dates be
ing marked by precise solar alignments at various megalithic sites around
the country. He also concluded that sites all over Britain were laid out us
ing a small number of precise geometrical constructions using a standard
unit of length (the “megalithic yard”) accurate to about one millimeter.
Thom’s theories have not stood the test of time. On the archaeological
side, detailed reassessments have revealed a variety of subtle biases in the se
lection of data that have destroyed the statistical conclusions. Astronomical
critiques have drawn attention to day-to-day changes in atmospheric refrac
tion and to the effects of extinction near the horizon. These have shown that
programs of naked-eye observations of the precision envisaged by Thom
could never have been successfully carried out. Similarly, statistical reap
praisals have shown that Thom’s ideas about precise megalithic mensuration
and geometry cannot be supported on the evidence available.
Observations and perceptions of astronomical phenomena do,
nonetheless, frequently feature in symbolism associated with places of sig
nificance in the landscape or the design of monumental architecture. This is
because human activities tend to reflect the perceived cosmos, of which the
sky is viewed as an integral part. The alignment of numerous European pre
Palaeoscience 327
Pure Mathematical Physics



historic temples and tombs upon horizon astronomical events is probably
best understood in this way. But such alignments are not the only manner in
which ancient obsessions with the skies may show up in the material record.
There is widespread evidence, for example, of the deliberate positioning and
design of art and architecture to permit the interaction of sunlight and
shadow at certain times, a famous example being the “sun dagger” at Fajada
Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico.
It is tempting to speak of astronomy as the oldest science, but in doing
so we may fail to recognize that attempting to make sense of what was per
ceived in the sky merely formed an integral part of human understanding of
the natural world in an integrated way. The solstitial orientation of the pas
sage tomb at Newgrange, Ireland, expressed something about the perceived
association between ancestors and the sun; it was not set up to measure or
track the solar motions. Likewise, in designing their earth lodges the Skidi
Pawnee of North America paid attention to details of light and shadow and
used viewing stations for astronomical observations. However, we would be
wrong to view the earth lodge as an observatory in the Western sense. It was,
according to ethnoastronomer Von Del Chamberlain, “primarily a shelter to
protect its builders from the intense solar heat, cold winter air, wind, rain,
snow, and creatures that might molest them” (Chamberlain 1982, p. 166).

Pantheon

Pure Mathematical Physics



almost intact and is undoubtedly one of the architectural wonders of the
world. Its enormous dome, more than forty-three meters (142 feet) in di
ameter, remained the largest in the world for thirteen centuries. It is made
of solid concrete and is near-perfectly hemispherical on the inside (al
though, for practical reasons, it is thinner and less dense toward the top),
and supported upon masonry walls more than six meters (twenty feet)
thick. At its apex is a circular hole nine meters (twenty-nine feet) across, so
that the visitor feels at once enclosed and yet exposed to the elements.
Though now largely empty, the building was once richly and colorfully dec
orated. The ceiling of the dome was stuccoed, and stones of different colors
(porphyry, marble, and granite) were used in the walls and floor. We can
imagine the numerous recesses filled with statues of the gods.
Although more recently consecrated as a Catholic church, the temple
was originally dedicated to the sun and stars. An intriguing question is the
extent to which religious and astronomical symbolism was reflected in the
architecture. Proportionality evidently mattered, in that the height is pre
cisely the same as the width; in other words, if one were to imagine the dome
being extended into a complete sphere it would just touch the ground in the
middle. A more controversial matter is whether sun-and-shadow effects were
deliberately incorporated. It is certainly true that as the sun moves through
the sky at different times of the year and day, natural light entering through
the apex creates eye-catching patterns on the walls and floor. To what extent
particular effects were intentional and orchestrated to occur at significant
times remains largely a matter of speculation.

Pawnee Cosmology
The Pawnee are one of the best-known native American groups in the U.S.
Midwest. Before the spread of Europeans into the area, they inhabited what
was to become northern Kansas and southern Nebraska. The Skidi (or
Skiri), one of four Pawnee bands, received particular attention from ethno
graphers in the early twentieth century, which provided a strong basis for
Pawnee Cosmology 329
Pure Mathematical Physics



more recent studies of many different aspects of traditional Pawnee lifestyle,
including myths and rituals relating to the sky.
The Skidi Pawnee creation myth tells of how Tirawahat (or Tirawa),
creator of all things, instructed various sky gods, including the Sun, the
Moon, Bright Star (Evening Star), Great Star (Morning Star), and Star-that
does-not-move (Polaris). The four World Quarter Stars were charged with
holding up the heavens and were given the power to create people. Sun pur
sued Moon to produce the first boy; Great Star pursued Bright Star to pro
duce the first girl. The gods in the heavens provided people with materials
for tools, weapons, and clothing, and also with precious objects that they
would need to create sacred bundles. Different star gods created different
groups of people with complementary knowledge and different sacred bun
dles. By coming together and keeping their lives in tune with the patterns es
tablished by the gods in the heavens, and in particular by undertaking the
appropriate ceremonies associated with each of the bundles at the right
times, the Skidi people as a whole were able to live in harmony with them
selves and with the cosmos for many generations.
The traditional cosmology, or worldview, of the Skidi Pawnee is based
upon a rich set of associations that are perceived to exist between people, the
earth, and the sky, intricately woven together to form a complex framework
of understanding. Thus each of the four World Quarter Stars occupied one
of the intercardinal directions and was associated with a color, one of the
four seasons of nature, one of the four seasons of life, a meteorological phe
nomenon, an animal, a type of wood, and a type of corn. The various ethno
graphic accounts differ slightly in some of the finer details, but we can say
with reasonable confidence that Yellow Star occupied the northwest, con
trolled the setting sun, and was associated with the spring, childhood, light
ning, the mountain lion, willow, and yellow corn. Likewise Red Star occu
pied the southeast and was associated with summer, youth, cloud, the wolf,
box elder, and red corn. Big Black Star occupied the northeast and was as
sociated with autumn, adulthood, thunder, the bear, elm, and black corn. Fi
nally, White Star occupied the southwest and was associated with winter, old
age, wind, the wildcat, cottonwood, and white corn. Black Star (male) and
White Star (female) were mates, as were Red Star (male) and Yellow Star (fe
male). Red Star controlled the coming of day, while Black Star controlled the
coming of night. White Star stood by the Moon. Black Star was the patron
of knowledge. The associations seem endless. (The question of whether the
World Quarter Stars represented actual stars, and if so, which, has been in
vestigated extensively but remains unresolved.)
The Skidi view of the world was reinforced by story and by observa
tions of nature itself. For example, the Sun continually chased the Moon
across the sky, regularly (once every month) catching up and causing her to
330 Pawnee Cosmology
Pure Mathematical Physics



disappear. It was also continually enacted in activities and ceremonies that
ensured harmony with the cosmos. As an outsider might see it, the Skidi
Pawnee based their lives around observations of the heavens. However, it
would be a more accurate representation of the complete picture to say that
the pattern of their lives reflected the structure of the cosmos in many dif
ferent ways, both in space and time.
This is particularly evident in the layout of individual dwellings, often
known as earth lodges. They are round because the world is round; the floor
represents the earth and the ceiling the sky. The lodge entrance faces east, to
ward Morning Star, so that people can enter the lodge in the same way as
the stars enter the sky; the altar is located in the western part, the domain of
Evening Star, to symbolize creation and renewal. The roof is held up by four
main posts that represent the World Quarter Stars. They are placed in the in
tercardinal directions and each is painted with the appropriate color. These
reflect the four quarters of the world, and symbolize the connection between
the earth and the sky.
The structure of the cosmos was not only reflected in individual
dwellings; the whole landscape reflected the arrangement of the sky gods.
Four villages were particularly associated with the World Quarter Stars and
were situated in appropriate intercardinal directions in the landscape. Each
possessed sacred bundles bestowed by the World Quarter Star in question and
led ceremonials at certain times of year. These ceremonies, in turn, were re
lated to seasonal activities such as planting, harvesting, and buffalo hunting.
The Skidi Pawnee provide an excellent example of why, and how, hu
man communities strive to keep their lives in tune with the cosmos as they
perceive it.

Pawnee Earth Lodge
The traditional dwelling of the Pawnee, often referred to as an earth lodge,
symbolized the cosmos in many ways: in the materials used, the techniques
of construction, in its orientation, and in the spatial configuration of activ
ities taking place there. The lodges of one of the four Pawnee bands, the
Skidi Pawnee, have been studied in particular detail. They faced eastwards,
Pawnee Earth Lodge 331
Pure Mathematical Physics



with altars in the west. Their four main supporting posts represented the
World Quarter Stars, each placed in the appropriate intercardinal direction,
thus reflecting the four quarters of the world and symbolizing the connec
tion between the earth and the sky. At the top of the lodge, directly over the
hearth, was a smoke-hole, which was said to reflect the shape of the Coun
cil of Chiefs, a group of stars corresponding to our constellation Corona
Borealis. In short, the earth lodge was a model of the world—a micro
cosm—in which people, in carrying out their daily lives within their homes,
also lived at one with, and within, the cosmos as a whole.
The lodge also functioned as a place for observing the heavens. The
first rays of the morning sun, passing in through the entrance, imparted life
giving strength and power. During the day, and depending upon the season
of the year, sunlight slanted down through the roof hole and passed around
the lodge, touching objects and people, bringing light and warmth. It is also
recorded that Skidi priests used the smoke hole to observe stars passing over
head, in order to schedule ceremonies. In this sense, the lodge had a prag
matic function for calendrical observations: it truly was an observatory.
This juxtaposition of the practical and the symbolic may come as a
surprise. It also has implications for some of the questions that have been
asked in the past about the significance and meaning of prehistoric remains,
and about whether astronomical alignments at prehistoric monuments in
Britain represented science or symbolism. Earth lodges clearly combined el
ements of both.

Pawnee Star Chart
In 1906, the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago acquired an oval
shaped piece of thin leather measuring fifty-six by thirty-eight centimeters
(twenty-two by fifteen inches) with lace holes around the edge. One side is
covered with several hundred four-pointed stars of various sizes, painted in
irregular patterns, with a band of smaller dots running across the middle
(on the narrower axis). Several configurations of larger crosses stand out as
possible bright stars or constellations, and the band of dots could be inter

preted as the Milky Way. That this was a representation of the sky seems
beyond question.
Early attempts to identify particular stars on the star chart tended to start
from the assumption that it was a literal map of the night sky. Larger crosses
were thought to represent brighter stars and positions were assumed to be
marked with considerable accuracy. Yet even though some groups of stars such
as the constellations Ursa Major and Corona Borealis, and the Pleiades, are
certainly recognizable, it quickly becomes clear that their shapes, positions,
and relative sizes are approximate at best. Most of the smaller stars seem to be
just a backdrop, not representing any stars or groups of stars in particular.
It is a mistake to take an indigenous artifact out of context and to judge
it by our own standards of precision. Before anything else we should ask
what its purpose was. Fortunately, cultural data do exist in this case: ethno
graphic notes associated with the chart indicate it was part of a medicine
bundle used in various ceremonies that ensured well-being. It was used, in
other words, to harness the sacred power of the stars.
Examples such as this expose the dangers of imposing our own criteria
when trying to interpret an astronomical artifact from another culture. We
might seek a literal representation of the configurations of the stars and be
impressed if it achieved a high degree of accuracy, but in doing so we are be
ing ethnocentric: imposing our own predilections on another culture. Accu
racy in this literal sense might matter to us, but we cannot expect that it mat
tered to them. These dangers are especially great where we do not have a
cultural context, as in the case of the prehistoric Nebra disc. A similar lesson
can also be extended to those who try to find literal representations of con
stellations in the positions of monuments on the ground.

Pilgrimage
The term pilgrimage tends to be applied to journeys in search of spiritual
fulfillment made in historical and modern times, particularly in the context
Pilgrimage 333
Pure Mathematical Physics



of global faiths such as Christianity and Islam. However, the idea of mysti
cal journeys that are undertaken exceptionally—representing a complete
break from familiar places and/or practices—may well be more widely ap
plicable to peoples in the past, and even in prehistory. Of course, such an
experience can be totally individual and personal, but it is very often moti
vated by the perceived need to be in a particular place to undertake one or
more specific acts of idolatry, and very often at a particular time. If similar
ideological perceptions are widely shared, then mass pilgrimages can easily
result. Small-scale, and even individual, acts of reverence in the past could
have resulted in the placing of votive offerings that are discoverable by ar
chaeologists—a possible example is the “formal” deposits found in the
ditch and postholes of the early earth and timber circle at Stonehenge in
England; however, mass pilgrimages seem most likely to be archaeologically
visible. How do we recognize potential places of pilgrimage? And how do
we proceed to address the questions of who came to them, from where,
when, and why?
Answering even the first of these questions is a task that is far from
straightforward. It seems clear that for a place to become the focus for pil
grimage, it must be exceptional in people’s minds. This idea is fine as far as
it goes, but a place could have been seen as exceptional for a whole variety
of reasons that could apply equally well to distinctive natural places or to
human constructions on any scale. Just because a place was large and im
portant enough to have attracted mass gatherings does not mean that we
would necessarily wish to describe it as a pilgrimage center—consider trad
ing centers on market day; nor does a place need to be remote or to attract
participants from great distances in order to qualify (a good example is the
peak sanctuaries of Minoan Crete). Nonetheless, evidence of religious or rit
ualistic activity and participation from afar are key indicators for the ar
chaeologist, and a place of pilgrimage may be more obvious archaeologically
if these pilgrims from afar deposited “foreign” artifacts that can be convinc
ingly interpreted as cult objects or votive offerings.
Another characteristic aspect of pilgrimage is the journey itself. The act
of making a pilgrimage can be as important as the place finally reached, and
the idea of pilgrimages in the distant past may be supported by the existence
of “formalized” routes of approach or by sets of shrines strung out along
routes through the landscape. A possible example of the former is the enig
matic Cursus Monuments of Neolithic Britain, whose low earthen ditches
and banks could have prescribed movement at special times or for special
purposes without constraining it at other times, given (as seems likely) that
they were easily walked across. Elsewhere, and later, stone and timber av
enues may have served a similar purpose. Such arguments are more con
vincing when the formal route in question leads directly to an obvious can

didate for a pilgrimage center, as did the three-kilometer-long avenue that led
up to Stonehenge in the late second millennium B.C.E. Far away in space and
time, the impracticality for normal purposes of many of the roads and track
ways converging upon Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, around the eleventh
century C.E. implies that their function was largely symbolic and adds
strength to arguments that Chaco was a huge pilgrimage center, its Great
Houses full to capacity only at certain times. Likewise, the ceremonial com
plex of Cahuachi in the valley south of the Nasca pampa in Peru has been
interpreted as a focus for pilgrimage, and it is possible that some of the fa
mous geoglyphs—long straight lines running across the arid pampas sur
rounding the site—could have been ritualistic paths of approach.
One of the most important aspects of many pilgrimages is timing.
Many places acquire particular significance and are seen as charged with
particular sacred power at certain times. Astronomical phenomena such as
sunrise alignments and shadow hierophanies are often of key importance in
this context—witness the modern crowds eager to view the equinox hiero
phany at Kukulcan in Mexico, midsummer sunrise at Stonehenge, or mid
winter sunrise at Newgrange in Ireland. (These examples also demonstrate
that such practices do not necessarily bear any relation to the actual original
intention of the builders—as opposed to the perceived or assumed inten
tion—something that may well have also been true in the past when people
ascribed sacred significance to even older monuments.) If such phenomena
inspired mass pilgrimages, then an interesting question arises: how did peo
ple from afar know when to set out?
A possible answer is that they observed the stars. The heliacal rising or
setting of a prominent star or asterism can, for example, provide a sure way
of determining the time of year to within a few days, even if there are peri
ods of bad weather. If the astronomical event in question occurred suffi
ciently far ahead of the sacred ceremony (which might itself have been trig
gered by an astronomical event), then each pilgrim would have sufficient
time to prepare for and make the journey. For example, the Delphic oracle
in ancient Greece was originally only available for consultation on one day
in the year. It has been suggested that the trigger, both for the oracle itself
and for pilgrims to set out, was the first pre-dawn appearance of the con
stellation Delphinus. At Delphi itself, however, the heliacal rise of Delphinus
was considerably delayed owing to the high eastern horizon, giving pilgrims
time to arrive there.
The Thornborough henges in northern England demonstrate how var
ious strands of evidence can be brought together to make a plausible argu
ment for a prehistoric site being a pilgrimage center. These include a con
centration of non-local flints that suggest a mass influx of people from a
considerable distance, and repeated alignments upon the rising position of
Pilgrimage 335
Pure Mathematical Physics



Orion’s belt and Sirius (which reflect their changing position over many cen
turies), suggesting that ceremonial activity here might have been directly re
lated to these two prominent objects in the sky. It makes sense that a major
ceremony would have been held in the early autumn, when the harvest was
completed but before the onset of cold weather. The heliacal rising of Orion’s
belt and Sirius took place some three weeks apart in the late summer and
early autumn. The first appearance of Orion’s belt could have provided the
sign for pilgrims to set out on their journey, while the subsequent appearance
of Sirius provided the signal for the festivities to begin.
Although the term pilgrimage is broad and in some ways ill-defined, the
past is undoubtedly full of instances where large numbers of people—often
coming from large distances—converged on sacred places at particular
times. Where this happened, watching the skies would have provided an easy
and reliable way for pilgrims to judge when to commence their journeys. Pil
grimages of this type, even in prehistory, may be detectable by carefully com
bining evidence from archaeology and archaeoastronomy.

Polynesian and Micronesian Astronomy
The ancient Oceanic peoples populated a vast area of the earth, successfully

colonizing a diverse range of island environments prior to European con
tact. Astronomy was a major factor in their ocean navigation. Directional
stars were used to guide navigators to familiar and not-too-distant islands.
On land, directional stones or even stone canoes were set up so that
would-be voyagers could sight along them and learn the appearance of the
stars in the required direction of travel. For longer journeys, one of the
most important prerequisites was acquiring a knowledge of the rising and
setting positions of various stars around the horizon, the so-called star
compass. This, combined with various techniques for dead reckoning, al
lowed navigators to estimate their current position in relation to the island
they had left or to the one they were trying to reach. There is also patchy
evidence for the use of a variety of other techniques, such as the use of
zenith stars passing directly overhead to estimate the current latitude, and
even (in the Hawaiian islands) the use of gourds as instructional aides or
navigational devices.
But objects and events in the skies were also important to ancient
Oceanic peoples in a variety of other ways. They certainly had an extensive
knowledge of astronomy: ethnographers in the nineteenth and early twenti
eth centuries recorded a great many names for stars, planets, nebulae (such
as the Magellanic Clouds), areas of the Milky Way, and so on—things actu
ally visible in the sky—as well as for purely conceptual constructs related to
the motions of the heavenly bodies. As an example of the latter, the Hawai
ians had names for what we might call the celestial tropics—the most
northerly and southerly paths followed by the sun around the sky at the
times of the June and December solstices, respectively. The northern tropic
they termed “the black shining road of Kane” and the southern one “the
black shining road of Kanaloa,” Kane and Kanaloa being two principal cre
ator-gods. The same or similar names for certain celestial objects (with di
alectic variants) can often be found right across the linguistically homoge
nous area of Polynesia and even farther afield, which indicates considerable
antiquity. For example, the Pleiades were known in Hawai‘i as Makali‘i, in
Samoa as Li‘i, in Tonga as Mataliki, in Tahiti as Matari‘i, and by the Maoris
of New Zealand as Matariki. To the west of Polynesia they were known, for
example, within Vanuatu (Melanesia) as Matalike and in Pohnpei (Microne
sia) as Makeriker.
Stars and constellations were frequently associated with gods, culture
heroes, or living chiefs, as well as featuring in stories of ocean voyaging and
of ancient homelands. A form of genealogical prayer chant common in Poly
nesia served to place those of the highest rank in a cosmic scheme of things
that includes everything in the sky as well as on earth. A famous example of
this is the Hawaiian Kumulipo.
Another way in which astronomy permeated the lives of Oceanic peo
Polynesian and Micronesian Astronomy 337
Pure Mathematical Physics



ples was through the calendar, which had a common form all over Polyne
sia and Micronesia. It consisted of an annual cycle of months based on the
lunar phases, with a named sequence of days (or rather, nights) in each
month. Many of the same or similar month or day names occur over a wide
area, indicating considerable antiquity, and in certain places there is clear
evidence that months shared their names with stars or constellations used
to identify them. Yet some of the variants from region to region were ma
jor, such as when in the solar year a given month actually occurred. There
were also significant, though generally more minor, local variations (for ex
ample from one Hawaiian island to another, or between different Maori
groups in New Zealand). Systems of prognostications and observances as
sociated with the calendar seem to have grown to their most complex on
those groups of islands where powerful social hierarchies developed. The
Hawaiian calendar at the time of European contact, for example, involved
an elaborate system of cycles of ritual observances and taboos tied both to
the time of the year and the time of the month.
Traditional astronomical practices in Oceania have left their mark in
the material record in a number of ways. The purposes of some of the
more recent artifacts, such as sighting stones, can be verified using
recorded oral history or ethnography. Clues to older, pre-contact practices
within Polynesia may be encapsulated in the temple enclosures and plat
forms that were ubiquitous throughout this region. These do not manifest
any systematic astronomical alignments on a large scale, but a few are
known from oral history to have been used for sighting the sun or stars.
Occasionally we find firmer archaeological evidence of deliberate orienta
tion, such as a group of temple enclosures (heiau) on the Hawaiian island
of Maui that are aligned upon the rising position of the Pleiades, appar
ently for reasons associated with the calendar and worship of Lono, a
prominent god of agriculture.
Although a number of claims have been made that Oceanic peoples de
termined the solstices and equinoxes to high precision, most of these stem
from a desire (witting or otherwise) to impose Western aspirations and do
not fit the evidence. However, ethnography confirms that the inhabitants of
one Polynesian island, Mangareva, did indeed mark the solstices to consid
erable precision by erecting pairs of stones as horizon foresights.
In the Hawaiian islands there is a particularly rich heritage of oral lit
erature in the form of creation myths, stories, and chants. Some were
recorded by early missionaries or published in the Hawaiian language in lo
cal newspapers in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The small
proportion that have been translated and republished contain numerous
references to the sun, moon, stars, and planets. Some chants clearly describe
places in the landscape and appear to provide explicit descriptions of as
338 Polynesian and Micronesian Astronomy

tronomical alignments. An example is the so-called “N§ Pali chant” from
the islands of Ni‘ihau and Kaua‘i.
Throughout Oceania, astronomical knowledge was sacred knowledge,
much of it the exclusive preserve of navigators and priests. This fact, added
to all the other processes of change that have occurred since European con
tact, means that only a few fragments have been preserved of what was with
out doubt an enormously rich and far-reaching knowledge of astronomy.
Sky knowledge was nonetheless framed within worldviews that governed all
aspects of existence and were woven into everyday life in a variety of ways.
In the Gilbert Islands, for example, conceptual divisions of the sky (the “roof
of voyaging”) were based upon the structure of actual house roofs. If we are
trying to understand more about that worldview, then it is misleading to di
vide Oceanic astronomical knowledge using such categories as pragmatic
and ritualistic, or useful and conceptual. These are divisions that only have
meaning from a Western perspective. To ancient Polynesian and Micronesian
peoples, all their sky knowledge was useful, all vital within their framework
of understanding the cosmos and how it functioned.

Polynesian Temple Platforms and Enclosures
Undoubtedly the best known and most conspicuous material remains of
Polynesian culture are the temple platforms and enclosures, variously
known as marae in much of central Polynesia (the Marquesas, the Society
Islands) and Aotearoa (New Zealand), ahu in the Tuamotus and remote
Rapa Nui (Easter Island), and heiau in the Hawaiian Islands (where the
term ahu refers just to the altar). The ahu of Easter Island, with their fa
mous statues, or moai, are undoubtedly the best known, but many hun
dreds of these temple platforms and enclosures are found throughout Poly
nesia, and very many more existed in the past.
The temple platform or enclosure was a sacred place constructed, used,
and maintained by a particular family or social group, or for people of a cer
tain social rank. In the Society Islands, for example, there existed maraes
serving individual households; the inhabitants of a district; people in the
same kinship group; those in particular occupations such as healers, canoe
builders, and fishermen; and the high chiefs or ari‘i nui. Temple sites were
used for a variety of purposes. Thus in Hawai‘i, the large and elaborate lu
akini heiau, which were the exclusive preserve of high chiefs, might be used
for investitures or religious rites including sacrifices, while at the other end
of the scale, modest ko‘a were built by commoners as simple fishing shrines.
There existed war heiau, medicinal heiau, navigational heiau, agricultural
heiau, and a host more, all dedicated to the appropriate gods.
Why a given temple site was located in a particular place or constructed
in a particular way is generally lost to us, but there is every reason to sup
pose that a strict set of sacred protocols had to be followed, as can still re
main true today. It is possible, for example, that an extraordinary concen
tration of temple platforms on the tiny and remote Hawaiian outlier of
Necker Island may be due to the location of this isolated rocky outcrop pre
cisely on the Tropic of Cancer. It has been suggested that many of the tem
ple sites were astronomically oriented, as was, for exmple, the inland ahu
Huri a Urenga on Easter Island. However, attempts to identify overall pat
terns have met with little success. On many islands, Rapa Nui being a par
ticularly clear example, it is evident that the predominant trend is simply to
orient temple sites with respect to the coast, either reflecting a general rela

tionship with the sea or the constraints of the local topography. This has
caused some archaeologists to conclude that astronomy played no part at all
in determining temple orientations.
The truth undoubtedly lies between these two extremes. The fact that
there are no obvious systematic astronomical associations is hardly surpris
ing, given the widely ranging functions and purposes of the different types of
temple site. Even where they were important, astronomical considerations are
likely to have been just one of a range of factors affecting temple location and
design, and were not necessarily reflected in the orientation. Some surviving
snippets of oral history do indicate an interest in the annual progress of the
rising sun up and down the eastern horizon (one of the few observation points
mentioned explicitly is Cape Kumukahi in the Big Island of Hawai‘i), but this
account does not point to a direct connection with any heiau.
Accounts do exist of temple platforms being used for sun observations
in Hawai‘i, and of the use of artificial horizon foresights in Mangareva, an
island in French Polynesia. But no accounts mention platforms being actu
ally aligned upon the sun. In one case, a surviving sacred hula chant appears
to describe a solstitial alignment from a heiau on the Hawaiian island of
Kaua‘i stretching along the high cliffs of the N§ Pali coastline of the island.
But even here, there is no suggestion that the alignment is directly reflected

in the orientation of the platform itself. Similarly, certain navigational heiau
are said to have been associated with voyaging stars, without suggesting that
they were oriented upon them. All this complicates efforts to tie together ar
chaeoastronomical field data with relevant fragments of oral tradition, but
does not make it impossible, as the following example shows.
Kahikinui is a remote area on the leeward side of the Hawaiian island
of Maui, on the southern slopes of the volcano Haleakal§. Recent survey
work here has revealed an unusually well preserved pre-conquest landscape
including households, cultivation areas, and almost thirty heiau, mostly of a
distinctive notched enclosure design, which all date to a similar period
around C.E. 1600. It is very unusual to find so many heiau in such a restricted
area and within such a well-defined archaeological context. This enables us
both to spot consistent orientation patterns that are likely to have been in
tentional and meaningful and to suggest plausible interpretations related to
our broader knowledge of the cultural context. The structure, location, and
orientation of the Kahikinui heiau suggest that they may be divisible into
four categories, each of which relates to one of the four main gods in the
Hawaiian pantheon. One set face north, one east, and one relate to the sea.
The last tend to overlook plantation areas and may relate to Lono, the god
associated with dryland agriculture. Their orientations are consistently

around twenty degrees north of east, which strongly suggests a particular ce
lestial target—the horizon rising position of the Pleiades. This asterism is
known to have been of particular significance in the Hawaiian agricultural
and ritual calendar, because its heliacal and acronical rise marked the begin
ning of the two halves of the Hawaiian year. On the northern side of Maui,
on the isolated peninsula of Kalaupapa, is another heiau incorporating a
similar alignment. It is found on a promontory whose traditional name
Makali‘i—means Pleaides in Hawaiian.
The example of the Kahikinui heiau serves to illustrate how little we
would know (and generally do know in other parts of Polynesia) about the
meaning of temple orientations but for being able to combine alignment ev
idence from a well-defined group of sites with oral history.

Power
In many human societies of the past, knowledge and beliefs relating to the
sky served to reinforce the political status quo. In some cases, the power of
the ruler was directly linked to the sky or to sky gods in the form of celes
tial objects. Thus Old Kingdom Egyptian pharaohs’ power depended upon
sun worship, as did that of the ruling elite of the Inca empire and that of
Roman emperors at the time when Mithraism held sway. Chinese emperors,
on the other hand, established their place at the head of the political order
by analogy to the north celestial pole—the hub of the turning sky—and un
derpinned this by aligning the buildings of the Imperial Palace (Forbidden
City) along the meridian. The layout of the greatest medieval Hindu city,
Vijayanagara, together with its position in the landscape in relation to sa
Power 343

cred hills, helped to establish the place of its kings within the cosmic order.
Similarly, the sarsen monument at Stonehenge, undoubtedly a potent sym
bol of the power of the chiefs who controlled it, incorporated a solstitial
alignment that, by linking the monument to the workings of the cosmos,
may have contributed to its symbolic power every bit as much as the exotic
stones and the scale of its construction.
Considerable social prestige and political power could accrue to anyone
who was seen as able to control or influence phenomena that could not be
controlled by anyone else. For this reason, an astronomer-priest might hold
the solstice ceremony around the time that the sun set in a particular horizon
notch so that he could demonstrate the power of “turning it around.” Align
ments that “worked” only at special times—the appearance of the midsum
mer full moon low over the recumbent stone of a Scottish recumbent stone
circle, for example, or the sudden entry of sunlight into places that were nor
mally dark, such as the cave below the zenith tube at Xochicalco in Mexico
would have been highly impressive and could have been used to help justify
the power and prestige of the priest in command. Such apparent control ulti
mately relies, of course, on the regularity of astronomical phenomena—reli
able cycles that are tied to other, observable events in the natural world.
Where a priest or shaman professed the ability to predict phenomena
such as eclipses or the appearance of comets, the results (as we know) would
be a lot more unreliable. Indeed, unexpected events would undermine their
authority and could even cause social and political instability. Certainly they
were commonly taken as bad omens. In C.E. 549, an unexpected lunar
eclipse led two Teutonic armies to flee the scene of battle and thus postponed
the Roman occupation of the Carpathian basin by two years. The appear
ance of Halley’s Comet in the spring of 1066 portended disaster for King
Harold at the battle of Hastings. And a spectacular meteor seen in the Aztec
capital of Tenochtitlan around 1515 caused great fear among the people.
The Spanish conquest followed just a few years later.
Observations of the regular cycles of the skies had a clear practical
value within a wide variety of human societies in the past by helping to keep
subsistence activities in step with the seasonal cycles of nature. However, as
often as not—and especially within larger political units with strong and
powerful social hierarchies—they also played a significant role in perpetuat
ing the power of the ruling elites.

Precession
Technically, precession is quite a difficult concept, but it is an important one
for anyone wishing to study perceptions of the skies in the past. Precession
has the effect of shifting the overall positions of the stars in the sky over a
time scale of centuries, and (from any given place) can make some stars dis
appear completely from view while others become visible for the first time
(in thousands of years). For example, when prehistoric farmers first colo
nized the area of southern England where they would eventually build
Stonehenge, the Southern Cross was prominently visible in the night sky at
certain times of year. However, it has not been visible from this latitude for
over 5,000 years. Taking account of precession is critically important for
anyone investigating possible architectural alignments upon stars. But it
also enters into archaeoastronomy in a different way, in that some have
claimed that the effects of precession are described and documented in
myths that have been perpetuated over many centuries.
In order to explain precession, it is best to adopt the astronomer’s per
spective, looking in on the solar system.
As it progresses on its annual orbit around the sun, the earth also spins
once daily around its own axis. This axis maintains the same orientation in
space, so there is one point in the earth’s orbit where its north pole leans di
rectly toward the sun while the south pole leans directly away from it. When
the earth is at this point in its orbit, for people in the northern hemisphere,
the sun is seen following its highest daily path through the sky, while for peo
ple in the southern hemisphere its path is the lowest. This is one of the sol
stices: the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere and the winter solstice
in the southern. In the modern (Gregorian) calendar this solstice falls on or
very close to June 21. The opposite point in the earth’s orbit, when the north
pole is leaning directly away from the sun and the south pole toward it, is
the December solstice. A quarter of the way around the earth’s orbit,
halfway between the solstices, are the two equinoxes, where the axis joining
the two poles leans neither toward nor away from the sun.
The earth’s axis maintains a fixed direction with respect to the stars.
This is because the stars are so staggeringly far away compared with the di
mensions of the solar system that the earth’s motion around the sun makes
no difference. If the sun were scaled down to the size of a beach ball, then
Precession 345
Pure Mathematical Physics



the earth would be the size of a ball bearing about thirty meters (a hundred
feet) away from it, and the farthest planet, Pluto, would orbit the sun at a
distance of a little over one kilometer (a little under a mile). On this scale,
the distance of the nearest star from the sun would be about the distance of
London from New York, with some of the other visible stars considerably
farther away still. Having established these vast distance scales, it is concep
tually far easier to pretend that the solar system is surrounded by an enor
mous sphere with all the stars attached to it. This means that the earth’s axis,
extended out through the north pole, is always pointing at a fixed position
on the celestial sphere: this is called the north celestial pole. Similarly, the
axis extended out through the south pole is always pointing to the south ce
lestial pole.
Over a time scale of centuries, the direction of the earth’s axis in space
(and with respect to the distant stars) does change. This is because the earth
not only spins about its axis, but the axis itself gradually turns in a way that
resembles a spinning top. One effect of this is that the position in the earth’s
orbit where we find (say) the north pole tilted toward the sun is now differ
ent: in fact, it has “precessed” around the earth’s orbit. So have the positions
corresponding to the other solstice and to both the equinoxes. This is the
reason that the term precession is used to describe this phenomenon: it is in
fact short for precession of the equinoxes.
From the point of view of someone watching the skies from the surface
of the earth, precession makes it seem that the celestial poles gradually
change position. In fact, each of them traces out a wide circle on the celes
tial sphere, completing one circuit every 25,800 years. Occasionally during
this period, one of the poles will come close to a bright star, making it easy
to identify the pole; this is the case with Polaris at the present time, but it is
more often not so.
The principal effect of precession is that the declination of every star in
the sky changes over the centuries. One consequence of this is that the hori
zon rising and setting positions of any particular star as viewed from any
particular place on earth will generally change significantly over a period of
a few centuries (although how significant this effect is depends upon the pre
cision of the alignment being considered). This means that there is a nasty
trap waiting to ensnare the modern investigator looking for possible astro
nomical alignments—at least, stellar alignments—at prehistoric monuments
such as stone circles. The danger is this: these monuments are rarely datable
to within a few centuries (and very often the range of possible dates is far
wider than that). If we notice that a particular structure is aligned upon a
horizon point fairly close to the rising or setting position of some bright star
in the past, then we may well be able to find a date within the permissible
range that fits the alignment perfectly. While there may be exceptions (such
346 Precession
Pure Mathematical Physics



as the prehistoric sanctuary at Son Mas in Mallorca), this sort of astro
nomical dating generally proves nothing because of the ease by which such
alignments can arise fortuitously. To give an idea, suppose we take the fif
teen brightest stars in the sky and a date range of five hundred years. Then
by choosing an appropriate combination of star and date we can cover
about a third of the horizon. In other words, if an alien giant were to come
along and scatter fake prehistoric aligned structures randomly over the
landscape, it would be possible to choose a star and a date within the per
mitted range that would fit one in three of them. The problem is further
confounded by atmospheric extinction. What all this means is that the as
piring archaeoastronomer must pay particular attention to problems of
methodology. Two case studies that illustrate the dangers particularly well
are the stone row at Ballochroy in Scotland and the stone configuration at
Namoratung’a in Kenya.

Precision and Accuracy
These two terms, which mean similar things in common usage, have distinct
meanings to archaeologists and others who undertake surveys as part of
their fieldwork techniques. Suppose that we use a magnetic compass to
measure the azimuth of a prominent mountain peak on the horizon. The
compass, we find, is graduated in degrees but it is possible to estimate the
angle to the nearest half-degree. When we take the same reading three or
four times we get readings consistent to the nearest half-degree. Half a de
gree, then, is the precision of our compass reading.
Accuracy, on the other hand, refers to how close that reading is to the
truth. We may have forgotten to take into account the fact that compasses
point to magnetic north rather than true north. There may also be a local
magnetic anomaly. As a result, it may be that the reading we obtain is actu
ally four degrees higher than the true value. The accuracy of our reading,
then, is only four degrees. Great precision is no guarantee of great accuracy.
Overprecision can be very misleading. If we use a theodolite with an
electronic distance measurement (EDM) capability to measure the distance
between, say, the center of a stone circle and an outlier, then we will be able
Precision and Accuracy 347
Pure Mathematical Physics



to read off the result to the nearest millimeter. However, standing stones are
generally large and irregular in shape and may have shifted somewhat dur
ing the millennia since their original construction. The circle may not be ex
actly circular and its center may be ill-defined. To measure, precise to one
millimeter, the distance between two points which are themselves arbitrary
to within several centimeters or more is completely pointless. Worse, it can
be misleading: there is a danger that such “falsely accurate” measurements
will be used subsequently, say, in calculations that explore the possible exis
tence of a precise unit of measurement.
Finally, we may also speak of the precision with which prehistoric peo
ple set up an astronomical alignment. Thus it could be that a group of peo
ple in Bronze Age Britain constructed a row of standing stones aligned upon
the solstitial sunrise to a precision of about half a degree (thirty arc minutes);
that a team of surveyors in 1999 measured the alignment to an accuracy of
a few arc minutes; and that the results were published in 2001 quoting dec
linations to a precision of one arc minute.

Prehistoric Tombs and Temples in Europe
Scattered through western Europe from Scandinavia and Scotland down to
the Mediterranean (and extending into North Africa) are a staggering vari
ety of later prehistoric monuments that still remain conspicuous in today’s
landscape. Built in some areas as far back as the fourth millennium B.C.E.
and even earlier, and in some places only a few centuries before the coming
of the Roman empire, many hundreds of great constructions in stone have
stood the test of time remarkably well. More modest examples, however,
tend to be little known, and many remain under serious threat. Some were
tombs, some undoubtedly functioned as temples where sacred rites took
place, and some—like the great alignments of hundreds of standing stones
at Carnac in Brittany, northwest France—seem to defy explanation. Within
this broad custom of constructing monumental architecture were a wealth
of local traditions, resulting in groups of monuments as diverse as the re
cumbent stone circles of eastern Scotland, Irish wedge tombs, Causse-type
dolmens of south-central France, Portuguese antas, Sardinian nuraghi,
Menorcan taulas, and many more.

ished on sites such as Stonehenge. Yet, surprising as it seems, there was little
or no interest in—let alone large-scale investigations of—monumental ori
entations in the remainder of western Europe until a systematic survey was
undertaken by the British historian of astronomy Michael Hoskin during the
1990s. Hoskin measured and documented the orientations of over three
thousand later prehistoric tombs and temples in Portugal, Spain, southern
France, and the islands of the western Mediterranean. Within this consider
able area and time span one can identify numerous local traditions resulting
in characteristic types of monument broadly consistent in their design and
methods of construction. Some occur in large numbers, like the Sardinian
tombi di giganti (“tombs of giants”), of which over 250 remain; others con

sist of only a handful of extant examples, such as the dolmenic hypogea of
the Fontvieille region of southern France, of which there are only four.
The remarkable fact that emerges is that nearly every local group has a
discernible orientation signature, as characteristic as the architectural design
of the tomb or temple itself. The vast majority of the three thousand monu
ments faces broadly toward the east, southeast, or south. Some local groups
cover the whole range from northeast to south, while others fall exclusively
within a much narrower span. A few groups of monuments, on the other
hand, face predominantly westerly or southwesterly. South-facing groups are
rare and north-facing monuments are virtually unheard-of, there being only
two examples in the whole set. This shows beyond any doubt that, through
out a significant area of the world and through three or more millennia of
prehistory, the orientation of a monument was of almost universal impor
tance—as important, evidently, as the materials used or the techniques of
construction. At the same time, it is clear that dominant practices with re
gard to orientation varied from place to place and time to time just as much
as those relating to design and construction. The orientation data give us
some clues about how certain practices may have propagated from one re
gion to another. West-facing tombs, for example, are rare in the Iberian
peninsula and western and central France, but predominate in the Mediter
ranean coastal region of France. It seems likely that this practice developed
in Provence or Languedoc, where it prevailed, spreading both east toward
Italy and southwest toward Spain, but then (in both cases) became increas
ingly mixed with rival traditions.
It is much trickier to identify the targets that determined a set of orien
tations, let alone their meaning and significance to the people who built and
used the monuments. However, one thing is clear: even the most modest lo
cal groups of similar monuments are scattered through a sufficiently large
area, and placed in a sufficient variety of landscape situations, to rule out
any suggestion that the determinant was topographic, or even that the ori
entations were due to factors such as the prevailing wind. We are forced to
conclude that reference must have been made to the north-south line defined
by the diurnal motion of the heavens. This demonstrates, at least at the most
basic level, that reference was made to the skies.
How reliably particular targets, astronomical or otherwise, can be
identified for particular groups is debatable. One of the clearest cases is that
of the seven-stone antas (dolmens) of central Portugal, where the orienta
tions of all 177 examples measured fall within the sunrise arc on the east
ern horizon. A common orientation signature stretches from northeast
round to due south, and Hoskin suggests that the motivation here was to
orient monuments either in the direction of sunrise or of the sun climbing
in the sky. Similarly, some of the westward-oriented groups correspond to
350 Prehistoric Tombs and Temples in Europe

the range of directions of sunset and/or sun descending in the sky. An ex
ceptional group of monuments are the taulas of Menorca, whose orienta
tions fall in a range centered upon the south. It is dangerous to try to fit stel
lar alignments in such a case, since there are many bright stars, and their
positions shift significantly over the centuries, owing to precession. How
ever, there is quite strong independent evidence to support the argument
that the taulas were associated with particular stars, most notably the
Southern Cross and Pointers.
Later prehistoric tombs and temples farther north, in Britain and Ire
land, have been much more intensively studied. In some cases, more specific
astronomical associations have been identified: for example, the Scottish re
cumbent stone circles appear to be related to the midsummer full moon.
However, taking a broader European view it is clear that their general ori
entation signatures are very similar to those found elsewhere in western Eu
rope. This implies that more detailed investigation of the monuments in con
tinental Europe may have a great deal more to tell us.

Presa de la Mula
In northeast Mexico, beyond the northern frontiers of the great Mesoamer
ican civilizations, hunter-gatherer groups still roamed at the time of the
Spanish conquest, as they had done for more than ten thousand years. By
the end of the eighteenth century they had been annihilated, but several
hundred of their rock art sites are known in this region. The dating is gen
erally uncertain within wide bounds, but many are clustered in certain lo
cations, usually where there are wide views of the surrounding landscape,
horizon, and sky. These petroglyphs contain numerous depictions of ani
mals and weapons but also, intriguingly, abstract designs consisting of short
lines organized in rectangular arrays, and groups of dots organized in sets
of parallel rows or columns, crosses, concentric circles, and meandering
lines. Anthropologist Breen Murray has examined the numerical character
Presa de la Mula 351
Pure Mathematical Physics



istics of these designs in an attempt to identify patterns of numerical order
that might give some insight into their meaning.
The vertical face of a rock at Presa de la Mula, near Monterrey, contains
one of the most extensive arrays of lines. This petroglyph, which measures
some three meters (ten feet) across by one meter (three feet) high, contains
207 short vertical lines organized in a grid pattern with six rows and four
columns, which divides them into twenty-four cells. Reading horizontally
from left to right, and from the top row downwards, it is possible to discern
sequences of 29, 27, 29, 28, 27, 7, 30, and 28 days. Each of the larger se
quences is subdivided into subsequences such as 11+11+4+3 and 7+8+7+6.
Murray suggests that the lines are “tally marks” that reckon the days
in relation to the phases of the moon. The number 207 corresponds exactly
to the number of days in seven synodic (lunar-phase-cycle) months, and there
are seven subtotals of between twenty-seven and thirty days. The fact that
these are generally shorter than the true length of the synodic month (29.5
days) could be attributed to the vagaries of observing the moon (especially
the thin crescent before and after new moon), and the additional seven days
after the fifth month could be a correction, required to bring the “calendar”
back into line at this point. The fact that this cell of seven days is marked by
two otherwise unexplained arrow-shaped lines backs up this speculation.
The whole design, then, appears to be a record of actual day-by-day obser
vations of the phases of the moon lasting over half a year. Perhaps they had
a seasonal camp near here, and after this period they moved on.
This interpretation has been arrived at by post hoc reasoning. Reading
the count from left to right gives the best fit to a lunar interpretation, so that
is what is suggested. A skeptic might argue that the various cells could be con
joined in different ways, or read in a different sequence, and to some extent
this is undeniable. However, the interpretation is inherently plausible and is
backed up by the presence of circles that seem to mark the completion of the
months. Furthermore, the number 207 occurs in at least one nearby petro
glyph—an array of dots found forty kilometers away at a site called Boca de
Potrerillos. Finally, the total numbers of dots in several smaller dot counts on
other petroglyphs in the area seem to have possible lunar significance.

Pyramids of Giza
The three Pyramids of Giza, to the west of Cairo, were built by three
despotic pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty, in the twenty-seventh to the
twenty-fifth centuries B.C.E.: Khufu (Cheops), Khafre (Chephren), and
Menkaure (Mykerinos). Khufu’s pyramid, most likely constructed in c.
2528 B.C.E., was an extraordinary feat of engineering (and of labor organi
zation), built using over two million blocks of limestone, each weighing
some fifteen tons and rising to an incredible height of over 145 meters (480
feet). Khafre’s was only slightly smaller, while Menkaure’s, at sixty-seven
meters (220 feet), was modest by comparison. Each was actually part of a
funerary complex serving not only as the king’s tomb but also as a place of
continuing ritual. Khafre’s complex included the famous Sphinx.
The sides of each of the Giza pyramids were carefully aligned upon the
cardinal directions (north–south or east–west). This alignment followed es
tablished practice, but the accuracy with which it was achieved at Giza is
truly impressive, particularly in the case of Khufu’s pyramid. Each of its sides
is cardinally aligned to within six arc minutes, or one tenth of a degree. This
is equivalent to no more than one fifth of the apparent diameter of the sun
or moon. The other pyramids are only slightly less well aligned: Khafre’s to
within about eight arc minutes and Menkaure’s to within sixteen.
Why this careful alignment? The broader Old Kingdom practice of car
dinal orientation of tombs and temples almost certainly had to do with pre
serving the perceived cosmic order. Thus the northerly direction, where the
imperishable (circumpolar) stars resided, was the resting place of the im
mortal. The westerly part of the horizon, where the sun set each night, was
the entrance to the Duat, the otherworld, which had to be traversed on the
path to immortality. But why was it important to be so accurate? Here we
are reduced to speculation. Perhaps the north celestial pole, the one fixed
place in the heavens, was seen as the very resting place of the immortal soul,
and the successful path of the pharaoh’s soul to immortality could be en
sured only if the pyramid faced this spot exactly.
What is certain is that great accuracy was achieved, and many different
theories have been put forward to explain how. One of the most plausible
answers is that this was done by direct reference to the celestial north pole.
But there is a problem with this explanation. It is only by chance that we
have, at the present time, a bright star close to the pole. In Old Kingdom
times the closest star to the pole was Thuban in the constellation Draco.
While it had been almost exactly at the pole just after 2800 B.C.E., by 2500
B.C.E. it was 1.7 degrees, or three and a half moon-diameters, away (Polaris
is less than half that distance from the pole today). On the other hand, there
were a number of bright stars circling the pole then, as now. By carefully ob
serving these night after night, it would have become obvious that certain
Pyramids of Giza 353
Pure Mathematical Physics



pairs were (more or less) on opposite sides of the pole, or in line on the same
side. Suppose that the architect set up some form of vertical plumb line de
vice to determine accurately when one of the chosen pair of stars was di
rectly above the other. The direction of the stars when this happened would
be close to due north. Even then, it is not possible to explain the extraordi
nary accuracy of the Khufu pyramid except as a result of good fortune, but
if the same two stars were used in successive generations we can explain why
the other two pyramids are not quite so accurate. After a few decades, pre
cession would have moved them slightly farther out of line.
Celestial observations may well have had a greater part to play in the
construction of the pyramids than merely determining their orientation. The
Khufu pyramid contains various chambers and passages, but also two small
shafts running directly from the walls of the King’s Chamber deep in the in
terior up to openings on the outside of the pyramid, one on the north side
and one on the south. Each shaft runs horizontally for a short distance at
both ends, but their main parts rise perfectly straight and at a steep angle,
the north one inclining at thirty-one degrees and the south one at forty-four
degrees. To archaeologists, the obvious explanation for a long time was that
they were for ventilation, although it seemed strange that they were not sym
metrical. Then, in the 1960s, it was discovered that the northern shaft was

aligned upon the star Thuban at the time of construction, and the southern
upon one of the stars of Orion’s belt. They were clearly not for observation,
but we do not need to put these stellar alignments down to chance. The
pharaoh needed to visit these stars in the afterlife; this is clear from the pyra
mid texts found in later Old Kingdom pyramids. It is likely that these align
ments were quite deliberate and that the shafts’ purpose was to symbolize,
or perhaps to facilitate, his passage.
In the 1990s, the Pyramids of Giza attracted astronomical speculations
of a different sort, following from an observation by writer Robert Bauval
that the layout of the three pyramids on the ground appeared to mimic the
formation of the three stars of Orion’s belt in the sky. Bauval, and later Gra
ham Hancock, elaborated on this in a number of bestselling books. The rep
resentation of Orion’s belt, they argued, was part of a larger “sky map” on
the ground, which included the Milky Way, represented by the river Nile it
self. Unfortunately, the map was wrongly oriented in the third millennium
B.C.E.: it would only fit correctly in the middle of the eleventh millennium
B.C.E. This much older date, argued Bauval and Hancock, was the true date
reflected in the design.
These ideas attracted a great deal of publicity in the 1990s, along with
a torrent of criticism from Egyptologists, astronomers, and archaeoas
tronomers alike. The main problem is that there are more than seventy pyr
amids altogether in Egypt, and the selection of those claimed to be part of
the star map is arbitrary. (The same problem is evident at the Holy City of
Angkor in Cambodia, where a similar theory was proposed.) Another prob
lem is that over a time scale of millennia, the course of the Nile is variable.
But the main problem is the 10,500 B.C.E. date: it flies in the face of all the
archaeological evidence—it is completely fanciful. One can only conclude
that the resemblance to Orion’s belt is fortuitous. The configuration of the
three pyramids is perfectly well explained by the need of successive pharaohs
to locate a pyramid with a clear view to the north in the same general area,
given the constraints of the local topography.
The Giza pyramids illustrate two very different ways in which an at
tempt can be made to use astronomical alignments for archaeological dating.
The first procedure presupposes a technique for fixing the pyramids’ orien
tation that is plausible enough, given our knowledge of Egyptian construc
tion techniques and instrumentation in later periods. Each candidate pair of
circumpolar stars that could possibly have been used to fix the pyramids’
orientation would have produced particular errors at particular dates. Ex
amining the different possibilities may help archaeologists resolve outstand
ing questions concerning the precise dates of construction of these pyramids
and of the reigns of the pharaohs concerned. This is in complete contrast to
the second procedure, which rests upon a set of unsupported speculations

and produces conclusions that are at complete odds with all the archaeolog
ical evidence.

Quipu
Unlike the city-states of Mesoamerica, the great Inca empire of South
America produced no written records of which we are aware. However, in
formation was encoded in mysterious knotted string devices known as
quipu, or khipu. Many hundreds of examples are known, held in museums
in Peru and all over the world, and new ones are still being uncovered. In
1996, thirty-two quipu were discovered in a remote region of northern
Peru, in burial chambers built into a rock overhang surrounded by thick
forest, close to a lake known as Lake of the Condors. At first the quipu ap
peared to have been mechanisms for recording fairly mundane numerical
data, but there is reason to believe that at least some of them contained a
more permanent record of sacred information relating, for example, to the
calendar or astronomy. More intriguingly still, some of them were appar
ently read as texts by storytellers, so they seem to have conveyed histories
and myths.
Quipu generally comprise a number (in some cases, as many as several
hundred) of pendant strings attached to a single primary string. Sometimes
some of the pendant strings have further strings (subsidiaries) hanging off
them, and there are other minor variations, but overall the consistency in
form is remarkable. Quipu can be bundled up, or held or laid out to display
the various strings, which can be of many and various yarn types and col
ors. On the strings are knots. These normally contain up to nine turns, and
it is generally accepted that they encode digits from one to nine. Further
more, in the majority of quipu the knots on each string are carefully
arranged in a way that suggests that they represent a number of two or more
digits—in other words, a number expressed in a base-ten counting system
the same as our own. (The Mesoamericans, in contrast, used a base-twenty
counting system.) The lack of a knot in a significant place is used to signify
the digit zero.
In addition to the numerical data contained in the knots, the quipu
have the potential to convey information in a variety of ways, for instance
357
Q
Pure Mathematical Physics



in the spatial configurations of strings, the type of yarn used in each partic
ular string, its color, its direction of twist, and so on. Unfortunately, we
know next to nothing about how information was encoded and must try to
reconstruct this from scratch. On the other hand, ethnohistory and archae
ology do tell us something of the context in which some of the quipu were
used. Accounts by early Spanish chroniclers, such as Felipe Guaman Poma
de Ayala, attest to their use as tallying devices by local officials, perhaps
recording the payment of tributes, or census information. Archaeologically,
the fact that some quipu are found, like those already mentioned, among
grave goods—evidently part of the personal paraphernalia of ordinary indi
viduals—suggests that they were of significance to the individual or to their
immediate household or local social group (ayllu). It is certainly plausible,
then, that they contained a more permanent record of things of (local) cul
tural and historical relevance. Finally, and perhaps most intriguingly, we
know that some of the native storytellers who recounted histories, chiefly ge
nealogies and myths to the early chroniclers, did so by “reading from,” or at
least by interpreting in some way, certain quipu.
A few of the better-known quipu have been studied for many years. But
recently new large-scale and comparative analyses have become possible,
thanks to an extensive database being compiled at Harvard University by
Gary Urton and his colleagues. This work has revealed, for example, com
mon sequences of numbers on different quipu, implying perhaps that local
tallies were copied by regional officials, further up the Inca hierarchical
chain, and incorporated into summaries covering wider areas.
Some quipu appear to contain calendrical information. One of the
largest of the thirty-two found at Lake of the Condors, known simply as
“UR6,” has 762 pendant strings, 730 of which are systematically organized
into twenty-four sets, each containing twenty-nine, thirty, or thirty-one
strings. An obvious interpretation is that each set represents a synodic
month, that is, a month defined by the phase cycle of the moon, and that
the whole represents a period of two years. However, this does not neces
sarily mean that the purpose of the quipu was to represent calendrical in
formation. The strings themselves contain knots representing numbers. The
obvious conclusion is that quipu UR6 contained information (as yet un
known in nature) organized calendrically. If this is true, it shows that while
no quipu may in itself have been a calendar, we can nonetheless retrieve in
formation about calendars in everyday use within the Inca empire from cer
tain quipu indirectly.
To judge from a sample of over 350 quipu studied recently by Urton,
the knot information on about a third of all quipu does not resolve obviously
into base-ten numbers. An intriguing possibility is that these quipu (or at
least some of them) may have been “narrative” quipu, somehow providing
358 Quipu
Pure Mathematical Physics



information from which a practiced interpreter could have generated, or re
constructed, a story or account. We may never know the particulars of the
information encapsulated in this way on certain quipu, or the nature of the
process by which narratives were extracted. And yet some of the first tenta
tive steps in identifying some of the non-numerical information contained on
quipu may now have been taken. A few numbers much larger than the rest
appear on quipu UR6, but only in sequences of three together. The sugges
tion is that these were not actually number triples as such but ayllu labels or
identifiers, tags that identified the ayllu to which associated numerical infor
mation referred. If this interpretation is correct, then we have made our first
identification, and tentative interpretation, of non-numerical information
contained on a quipu.
Beyond the fact that they recorded tallies and used a base-ten number
ing system, interpretations of the purpose of the quipu and the nature of the
information contained in them have, until recently, remained largely specu
lative. This is now changing, thanks to painstaking analyses of the numeri
cal data combined with new archaeological evidence. The process of decod
ing these idiosyncratic recording devices may just have begun.

Recumbent Stone Circles
A recumbent stone circle (RSC) is a distinctive type of stone circle contain
ing one stone placed on its side. RSCs occur in just two regional groupings
at opposite corners of the British Isles: one is in the Grampian region of
northeastern Scotland around the modern city of Aberdeen, and the other
in the southwestern corner of Ireland, in Counties Cork and Kerry. In both
cases, the recumbent stone is generally found on the southwestern side of
the circle. In the Scottish circles it is large and set between two tall uprights,
known as flankers, that are normally the tallest stones in the circle. The
heights of other stones tend to taper away as one goes round the circle, so
that the smallest are found on the opposite, or northeastern, side. In the
Irish circles, on the other hand, the tapering works in the other direction;
the recumbent stone is small and placed in isolation, and the tallest stones
are normally a pair called portals on the opposite northeastern side.
The clear similarity and obvious systematic difference between these
two groups, together with the fact that they are separated from each other
by sea and several hundred kilometers, have generated a long debate about
the degree of relationship between them. It seems highly unlikely that such
a similar idea could have developed independently in the two places. But
was there necessarily direct communication between these two areas? Or
was the idea carried by a single influential person or group of people, traders
or emigrants, from one place to the other? Although some archaeologists,
such as the British stone circle specialist Aubrey Burl, refer to both groups
as RSCs, others, such as the Irish archaeologist Seán Ó Nualláin, prefer to
avoid implying such a close relationship and refer to the Irish group as ax
ial stone circles.
As a group, the Scottish recumbent stone circles present us with some
of the clearest evidence from Neolithic or Bronze Age Britain or Ireland that
the builders of a particular group of stone monuments carefully configured
them in relation to a particular astronomical body or event. In this case the
astronomical body concerned is not the sun, but the moon.
361

Pure Mathematical Physics



The RSCs are confined to a small geographical area, about a hundred
kilometers (sixty miles) by sixty kilometers (forty miles), and the archaeo
logical evidence, such as it is, suggests that they were constructed within a
period of no more than a few centuries, probably in the later part of the third
millennium B.C.E. However, it is their configuration that is of primary inter
est to archaeoastronomers. Their orientation is remarkably consistent. Over
fifty RSCs are sufficiently well preserved for us to be able to determine the
orientation, and there is a clear candidate for the principal orientation at
each site: the axis of the circle through the recumbent stone. With not a sin
gle exception, the recumbent stone is placed within the quarter of the circle
centered upon south-southwest, that is, between west-southwest and south
southeast. Some have argued that this orientation may simply reflect a rela
tionship with the local topography or the prevailing wind, but this idea does
not stand up to closer scrutiny: the topography of the area is varied and the
patterns of wind flow are diffused around irregular hills and winding valleys.
In fact, the reverse is true: the consistency in orientation that has been
achieved over wide area despite the varied topography makes it clear that the
sky was used in determining the orientation. At the very least, the builders
must have determined the orientation in relation to the diurnal motion of the
celestial bodies that defines the north-south axis.
362 Recumbent Stone Circles

Pure Mathematical Physics



But there is more to it. As viewed from within the circle, the recumbent
stone and flankers frame a part of the horizon, so it is a natural supposition
that this direction might be the one of significance (though most analyses
have also checked the opposite direction). There is always at least a reason
ably distant view beyond the recumbent, and quite often the stretch of hori
zon framed by the recumbent and flankers contains a conspicuous hill. This
strongly suggests that it was important to stand inside the circle looking out
wards toward the horizon. When one examines the declination ranges of the
horizons, then the goal of such observations seems to be revealed: they seem
to relate to the motions of the moon. Put simply, the full moon would pass
low over the recumbent stone around midsummer each year.
It is tempting to imagine these monuments being used for ceremonies
or rituals that took place by the light of the moon on a midsummer evening,
when the moon was seen to reach its correct configuration with respect to
the circle. Some archaeological evidence backs this up. Scatters of white
stone and particularly quartz, which are perceived in some human commu
nities as reflecting or encapsulating the light of the moon, have been found
around the base of the recumbent stone at one excavated site, Berrybrae. At
another recently excavated RSC, Tomnaverie, the recumbent stone itself con
tains more quartz than the other stones; at two others, Auchmallidie and
North Strone, the recumbent stone is itself one huge block of quartz.
The other feature that reinforces the idea that the people who built and
used these circles were interested in the moon is cup marks. There are few
cup-marked stones at RSCs; cup marks occur only on the recumbent stone
or flankers, or in one case only on the adjacent circle stone. They are never
found in other parts of the circle. Remarkably, the orientations of these cup
marks from the center correspond quite closely to specific rising and setting
points of the moon, namely the most southerly limits, known as the major
and minor standstill limits.
However, the image of people dancing by moonlight in a recumbent
stone circle on a midsummer night may be a misleading one. Excavations un
dertaken by the British archaeologist Richard Bradley in 1999–2001 show
that at least four RSCs were put up around an already existing feature, such
as a funerary pyre or platform. They also reveal quartz scatters at different
positions in the circle. Although there is also some evidence that the eventual
addition of a stone circle was anticipated from the outset, it may be that we
are seeing structures transformed from other materials, such as wood, into
stone. This possibility does not detract from the importance of the lunar
alignment, but it does alter how it can be interpreted. On the one hand, it re
minds us that people must have identified a sacred place and perhaps used it
for a variety of ritualistic purposes in order to make the necessary preliminary
observations that enabled them to get the astronomical alignment right when
Recumbent Stone Circles 363
Pure Mathematical Physics



it was set into stone. But it is also possible that the erection of the stones may
have closed off rather than initiated a period of use, so that the alignment,
once set up, was not used by people at all—or at least not by living people.
The Scottish recumbent stone circles are important to archaeoas
tronomers because they provide evidence of a consistent trend of astronom
ical orientation, one so strong that it is unthinkable that it could have arisen
by chance. On the other hand, we will never know as much as we would like
about why such alignments were set up or how (or even if!) they were sub
sequently used. The recent excavations show how, by looking more closely
at stratigraphic, dating, and artifactual evidence, we can begin to gain a
firmer idea of how particular monuments developed and what people did
there at different times. We need this knowledge in order to put our tenta
tive interpretations of symbolic relationships that we find encapsulated in
monuments such as the RSCs into a more reliable context.
By comparing different groups of monuments we can also attempt to
explore where cognitive principles, such as the interest in the moon that is so
clearly manifested at the RSCs, first originated and where and how they
were propagated. For example, evidence of lunar-related orientation can be
found at the Clava cairns of Invernessshire to the northwest of the RSC area
and also at many of the short stone rows found more widely in western Scot
land and western Ireland. On present evidence, it seems that the concern
with the moon that we see at the RSCs emerged in Britain and Ireland late
in the Neolithic period and continued well on into the Bronze Age (from the
late third until the mid or late second millennium B.C.E.). This contrasts with
the solar orientation of certain monuments such as cursus monuments
(Dorset Cursus, for example), passage tombs such as Maes Howe and New
grange, and stone circles such as the group in Cumbria. Such practices ex
tend back to some of the earliest farmers in Britain and Ireland in the fourth
millennium B.C.E.

sky than they actually are. At high altitudes the effect is slight, but close to
low horizons—when light rays have to travel through more of the earth’s
atmosphere to reach the observer—the apparent altitude can be as much as
half a degree above the actual altitude. Certainly if something appears at the
horizon, it is actually below it.
When we are calculating the declination of a celestial body following a
field survey, it is necessary to take refraction into account. Because of the ex
tremely high precision of the sightlines he was postulating, Alexander Thom
went to pains to estimate atmospheric conditions at the time of supposed ob
servations in order to calculate the appropriate refraction correction. How
ever, as astronomers Bradley Schaefer and William Liller have since pointed
out, day-to-day changes in atmospheric conditions effectively rule out sight
lines precise to just a few arc minutes. For most purposes, a mean refraction
correction (related only to the horizon altitude concerned) will suffice.

Roman Astronomy and Astrology
Unlike the temples in ancient Greece, Roman temples are not obviously
consistent in their orientation. Nor did any great innovations in philosoph
ical cosmology or mathematical astronomy emerge in the Roman world
at least none that are well known to modern historians of science. Roman
astronomy, it seems, was more pragmatic in nature, often intimately bound
up with prognostication and astrology.
One of the best-known manifestations of Roman astronomy is the Ju
lian calendar. It evolved initially from a simple sequence of indigenous festi
vals related to the farmers’ seasonal year, then became increasingly formal
ized as Roman society became increasingly urbanized. At first the civic
calendar was based on the phase cycles of the moon, but it faced increasingly
serious problems in getting out of step with the seasonal year because of po

litical interference in the process of intercalation. All this culminated in 45
B.C.E. in the switch from a lunar to a solar calendar, dividing the year into
twelve “months” that were in fact completely independent of the moon.
The civic calendar aside, there is little doubt that astronomy played a
significant role in many aspects of Roman life. Land surveyors, employed all
over the empire with simple instruments, needed good astronomical knowl
edge: this is clear from surviving surveyors’ manuals. Other books instruct
the navigators of commercial ships in navigating by the stars. Sundials were
in common use for telling the hour of the day: over thirty were recovered in
Pompeii alone.
Astrology, popular among the Romans’ Etruscan predecessors as well
as in Hellenistic Greece, had an uneasy relationship with the Roman state at
first, but increased greatly in popularity in the second century C.E. with the
rise of mystery cults such as those of Isis and Mithras. These were astral re
ligions, and for many people the sun itself became an object of direct wor
ship. Later, these cults came into direct conflict with Christianity.

Rujm el-Hiri
The megalithic monuments of Britain and Ireland have been studied in great
detail by archaeoastronomers. Numerous systematic investigations of the
orientations of prehistoric tombs and temples throughout the western
Mediterranean have been carried out. But comparable effort has rarely been
directed towards similar sites elsewhere in the world. One exception is a cu
rious circular construction built by Early Bronze Age peoples in the Golan
Heights, close to the border between Israel and Syria. Its name, Rujm el
Hiri, means “stone pile of the wild cat.” Built around 3000 B.C.E., it con
sists of a massive circular (actually slightly oval) wall some one hundred
fifty meters (five hundred feet) across and over three meters (ten feet) thick
with broad entrances to the northeast and southeast. Inside this are four
further concentric and successively thinner walls with irregularly placed
366 Rujm el-Hiri

openings. Between the circular walls are curved corridors, some of them di
vided into segments by blocking walls built perpendicular to the circles (ori
ented radially out from the center), but there is no evident pattern to them.
Most of the walls still stand to between two and three meters (seven to ten
feet) high. The result resembles the sort of maze encased in plastic into
whose center children try to guide ball bearings. Filling most of the central
space, which measures some thirty meters (one hundred feet) across, is a
cairn still standing to a height of almost five meters and built over a burial
chamber oriented towards the northeast entrance. It is surrounded by three
terraces with circular stone kerbs. The obvious conclusion—that the walls
were built successively around the cairn—seems to be contradicted by the
archaeological evidence, which suggests instead that the central cairn was
actually built more than a millennium after the original construction, in
around 1500 B.C.E. Rujm el-Hiri, in other words, appears to be a temple
that later became a tomb.
Various astronomical alignments have been identified at the site, the
clearest being the solstitial alignment of the northeast entrance, which is re
flected in the orientation of the later burial chamber. Curiously, though, the
southeast entrance is not aligned upon the other solstitial axis: it is too far
to the south. On the other hand, two exceptionally large boulders on the
eastern side could have referenced sunrise close to the equinox, and it has
been suggested that the purpose of this was to indicate that the first spring
rains were imminent, allowing final preparations to be made for water to be
efficiently collected for irrigation. Statistical analyses of the alignments of
over thirty radial wall segments suggest that they may have been used as stel
lar sighting devices.
What should we make of these alignments? It is almost certainly mis
leading to think of the site as an astronomical observatory. As a center for
religious rituals, however, cosmic referencing would have been important.
The location of the temple may have been significant in this regard, in that
it resulted in the two most prominent mountains—Mount Hermon and
Mount Tabor—appearing, respectively, almost due north and close to De
cember solstice sunrise. By visually linking places of vital cosmic signifi
cance, some in the landscape and some in the sky, the builders would have
reinforced the sacred power of the temple itself. More controversial, per
haps, is the idea that the radial walls could have functioned as stellar-align
ment-fixing devices. But then, what other purpose could they have served?
One possibility is that they simply served to restrict and confound access to
the central space, the act of negotiating an asymmetric labyrinth serving to
instill in the visiting pilgrim a heightened sense of the sacred power of the
place. The approximately solstitial orientation of the (later) tomb was cer
tainly nonfunctional but may have been deliberate and symbolic, following
Rujm el-Hiri 367

the alignment of the original temple.
Although Rujm el-Hiri has been hailed as a Stonehenge of the Levant,
and its construction is certainly broadly contemporary with the earliest
known (earth and timber) constructions at Stonehenge, the comparison may
be misleading and inappropriate. It is a magnificent temple in its own right
and gives us some special clues about the beliefs and practices of the Bronze
Age cultures of this part of the Near East.

Sacred Geographies
The term sacred geography stems from the realization that people in the
past conceived the landscape as charged with meaning, some of which
stemmed from the common worldview developed by their community as a
whole, and some of which worked on a personal level. The significance as
signed to particular places, routes through the landscape, and other (gen
erally more visual or perceptual than physically marked) divisions, connec
tions, and directions might well be a result of real events or memories. But
it might equally well derive from mythical or sacred connotations that
make little sense from a modern, Western perspective. Time is an important
factor, too. The sacred power of a place was often thought to be enhanced
at particular times, for example, when it was visually reinforced or revealed
by a brief play of sunlight. Once we realize this, we are in a better position
to appreciate conceptions of landscape in the context of worldviews—cos
mologies—other than our own; conceptions that are unlikely to view land
scape simply as a resource to be exploited and can give rise to actions that
we would not necessarily perceive as rational.
At the same time, using the term sacred geographies (or sacred land
scapes) to describe these conceptions has a major drawback. It implies that
there was a clear separation between the sacred and the secular. That this is
unhelpful is demonstrated by innumerable anthropological studies of his
torical and modern peoples. There are different degrees and types of sa
credness; and while some sacred places were very special indeed, mundane
places often had sacred aspects as well, helping to integrate the need for pre
serving worldly harmony into many different aspects of everyday life. Rites
to ensure continuity and regeneration were often related to particular
places, whether public temples or personal shrines, and tended as well to be
related to natural (that is, seasonal) phenomena: accordingly, they were of
ten carefully timed in relation to the cycles of the celestial bodies.
In all probability, true sacred landscapes, devoid of all mundane activ
ity, simply did not exist. However, the sacred aspects of all landscapes were

crucially important. The methods of archaeoastronomy are particularly im
portant in their potential to reveal sacred aspects of prehistoric landscapes
(for which, by definition, no historical evidence is available) where these
have resulted in spatial patterning with respect to the heavenly bodies.

Sarmizegetusa Regia
The Carpathian mountains run through northwest Romania in a wide arc,
enclosing an area that stretches down westwards into the Carpathian basin
in Hungary. This region forms modern-day Transylvania, but in the cen
turies immediately before and after the birth of Christ it was home to the
Dacians, a powerful kingdom whose later resistance to the Roman conquest
is famously depicted in Trajan’s Column in Rome. The rugged landscape to
the south of the modern town of Or≤∫tie contains a number of impressive
Dacian monuments, including settlements, stone-built fortresses and “sanc
tuaries,” assumed to have been places of religious worship. It is in this area,
at an elevation of over 1,000 meters (3,300 feet), that one encounters
Sarmizegetusa Regia, the ancient capital of the Dacians.
Sarmizegetusa Regia contained a citadel and living areas with dwellings
and workshops, but it also contained a sacred zone. A number of rectangu
lar temples were located there, the bases of their supporting columns still vis
ible in regular arrays. Perhaps the most enigmatic construction at the site,
however, is the large circular sanctuary. This comprised a “D”-shaped set
ting of timber posts surrounded by a timber circle, which was surrounded in
turn by a low stone kerb. The original timber posts have long since rotted
away, and the ones currently visible on the site are modern reconstructions
in the original postholes. They help the modern visitor visualize the layout
of the original construction, although the heights of the posts is completely
speculative.
The layout of the timber settings bears a broad resemblance to the
sarsen stone monument at Stonehenge in England, where five trilithons laid
out in a horseshoe shape are surrounded by a complete circle. This has led
370 Sarmizegetusa Regia
Pure Mathematical Physics



some people to proclaim Sarmizegetusa Regia as a “Romanian Stonehenge”
and to propose it as an ancient observatory comparable in importance to the
British site. In fact, this logic is flawed on several grounds. First, the two sites
are culturally unrelated and well separated in time: Sarmizegetusa Regia was
not built until 1,500 years after Stonehenge had fallen into disuse. The im
portance of the Romanian sanctuary must be measured in the context of the
Dacian cultural heritage. Second, Stonehenge is no longer considered by se
rious scholars to have been an ancient observatory. Its main axis was cer
tainly aligned toward the solstices, and the same has been claimed of the
large circular sanctuary. But in fact there are problems. The Romanian
“horseshoe” (if one excludes the straight side of the “D”) faces southeast
rather than northeast as at Stonehenge, so it is the midwinter rather than
midsummer sunrise upon which it is claimed to be aligned. This would be
the direction of sunrise on the shortest day of the year if there were a distant,
level horizon in this direction. But there is not. The horizon altitude in this
direction is several degrees, and the midwinter sunrise would occur over ten
degrees farther south.
Yet the circular sanctuary and other structures in the sacred zone may
well have had astronomical or calendrical associations. It has been sug
gested, for example, that a large circular block of stone 1.5 meters (five feet)

in diameter, laid flat and known popularly as the “Andesite Sun,” was used
as a sundial. It has been suggested that a circle of rectangular grooves cut
into the stone might have been used to mark the length of the shadow from
a central gnomon, but the existence of such a gnomon is pure speculation.
Others have argued that the stone was simply used for sacrifices or other rit
uals. Yet the idea of as sundial is far from absurd, since there are known to
have been influences on Dacian culture from Hellenistic Greece, and these
may well have included ideas about geometry and astronomy.

Saroeak
Basque stone octagons are symmetrical arrangements of eight small stones
found scattered across the northern coastal parts of the Iberian peninsula
but concentrated mainly in the Basque country—a culturally and ethni
cally distinctive region spanning four provinces in northern Spain and ex
tending into southwestern France. The stone octagons represent an enig
matic class of monument constructed, apparently, using well-defined
astronomical and geometrical principles. Each was of similar size, with a
diameter of about 320 meters (1050 feet), and the stones were placed ac
curately on the cardinal and intercardinal points. (Sometimes an additional
eight stones were placed at points in between, making sixteen in all.) In the
center was a distinctive stone known as an artamugarri. The term saroeak
(the plural, in the Basque language, of saroe), refers to the area demarcated
by these stone arrangements. One closely studied area surrounds the
coastal town of Donostia (San Sebastian) and the villages of Hernani and
Urnieta to the south. Even though it is an area of only about forty square
kilometers (fifteen square miles), nearly forty saroeak have been identified
in this locality alone.
Until the 1990s, saroeak had been of little interest to archaeologists,
who believed them to be a relatively modern phenomenon. However, it was
372 Saroeak
Pure Mathematical Physics



known that their distribution tended to coincide with places used for graz
ing by transhumant shepherding peoples as part of a strong pastoral tradi
tion within the Basque Country. Then, during the 1980s and 1990s, regional
cultural heritage projects combining documentary research and small-scale
excavations revealed a quite remarkable continuity of material tradition ex
tending over almost 2000 years. The historical documents showed the
saroeak to be the material remnants of a system for organizing communal
grazing lands dating back at least to the Early Medieval times—a system
that, in some cases, remained in use until early in the twentieth century. The
archaeological investigations showed that some center stones were con
structed as far back as C.E. 200.
Some of the historical records actually specify the geometrical design of
the saroeak and the methods that should be used in their construction, indi
cating that they were laid out using standard units of length, and confirming
the importance of celestial orientation in relation to the cardinal and inter
cardinal directions. They also tell us that the saroeak could act as local seats
of government and law and order; as meeting places; as safe grazing
grounds; as farmstead boundaries; and as centers for religious rites. The im

portance of reflecting the perceived cosmic order in their design perhaps
comes as no surprise, then, especially in view of the last of these.
The archaeological evidence shows that the design principles underly
ing the saroeak had already remained relatively constant for many centuries
before the earliest documents relating to them were written. Furthermore,
the earliest saroeak respected even earlier megalithic tombs and dolmens, in
that they never enclosed them, although such monuments are sometimes
found just outside a saroe boundary. Some have interpreted this as evidence
of an even longer continuity of tradition dating back to the Neolithic or
Bronze Age. Support for this view has been sought from the fact that the
Basque language is unique in western Europe in not belonging to the Indo
European linguistic family, suggesting that its roots are more localized and
pre-date the spread of Indo-European languages across the continent. If such
a long continuity of tradition did indeed exist in the Basque country, then the
Basque saroeak could be relevant to interpretations of later prehistoric mon
uments all over western Europe, including the famous Neolithic and Bronze
Age stone circles of Britain and Ireland. This is because—despite efforts by
some scholars to argue otherwise, for example in relation to the “mega
lithic” calendar—such interpretations are normally constrained by the fact
that the only direct evidence available is archaeological.
Yet it is also possible that the earliest saroeak simply implemented sa
cred or symbolic principles that respected what were already, even by the
early centuries C.E., conspicuous ancient features in the landscape, just as the
Nahua (Aztecs)—in another continent and another millennium—respected
the already ancient pyramids of Teotihuacan as works of the gods. However,
if we become prepossessed by the possibility of even longer continuities of
tradition, we divert attention away from the broader significance of the
saroeak in a different respect. They demonstrate remarkably well that func
tions and meanings can vary considerably while a material tradition remains
essentially unchanged. (Another, very different, example of this is the
Mesoamerican cross-circle designs.) And they also provide an important case
study concerning the ways in which this can happen in practice, over a pe
riod of nearly two millennia.

Science or Symbolism?
In the early days of modern archaeoastronomy, in the 1970s and early
1980s, there was a long and occasionally rancorous argument about
whether prehistoric astronomy, as manifested in astronomical alignments at
British megalithic sites such as Ballochroy and Kintraw, was scientific or
symbolic in nature. This question was intimately bound up with the issue
of whether, as proposed by Alexander Thom, prehistoric people created de
liberate sightlines on the rising and setting points of the sun, moon, and
stars, making use of features on distant horizons as “foresights” to achieve
pinpoint precision in their astronomical observations. The interpretation fa
vored by many archaeologists was that the high-precision alignments
picked out by Thom were fortuitous and that the people who built large
stone monuments were aware only of rougher alignments, such as the fa
mous midwinter sunrise alignment at the Irish passage tomb of Newgrange.
They argued that these lower-precision alignments were more likely to be
related to rituals and symbolism associated with seasonal activities, death,
renewal, ancestor worship, and so on rather than used as precise “scien
tific” measuring instruments.
There are two ironies here. One is that “high precision” should not
necessarily be equated with “scientific” and “low precision” with “sym
bolic.” Many historical and modern instances demonstrate that human
communities perform remarkably painstaking and exact astronomical
measurements for what, ultimately, are “merely” (as we might mistakenly
see it) ceremonial purposes. (A much-cited example is the traditional calen
dar of the Hopi in the southwestern United States.) Furthermore, the fact
that prehistoric people went to the bother of encapsulating astronomical
alignments, whether rough or more precise, in stone argues that they were
more than mere observing instruments—that they had strong symbolic mo
tivation and meaning.
The second irony in that “our” science—the modern Western way of
understanding the world—is not likely to be the way that human communi
ties understood the world in prehistory, any more than in indigenous com

munities today. One might well see other worldviews as representing alter
native forms of “science,” insofar as they explain what people see in the
world (the cosmos) around them and often have a predictive capability. (A
good example of this is the role of the Caterpillar Jaguar constellation of the
Barasana people of the Columbian Amazon in relation to earthly caterpil
lars.) Such “alternative sciences” often have a strong ceremonial element,
since appropriate observances help to keep human actions in tune with the
cosmos as it is perceived and understood. Incorporating alignments in ar
chitecture to symbolize and reinforce the properties of the world is another.
(This is evident, for example, in the design of the earth lodges of the Pawnee,
or the hogans of the Navajo, to name but two of many examples.) If we are
really interested in understanding more about prehistoric “science,” then we
should probably be looking for evidence of the kind of symbolical align
ments and ceremonial activities that were seen by many back in the 1970s as
its very antithesis.

Short Stone Rows
Among the most enigmatic of all the different types of megalithic monuments
in Britain and Ireland are the short rows of up to six standing stones that are
found scattered around northern and western parts of the islands, as well as
in northwest France. Well over 250 examples are known, and the dates that
exist suggest that the majority of them were erected at a relatively late stage
as far as megalithic monuments go: in the Early to Middle Bronze Age, well
into the second millennium B.C.E. Typically, the stones are one to two meters
(three to six feet) in height and placed a few meters (up to about fifteen feet)
apart, although there are some spectacular exceptions, such as the three-stone
row at Gurranes in County Cork, Ireland, where the slender stones rise to
over four meters (thirteen feet). Most of the rows stand in apparent isolation,
though some are associated with burials or other megalithic structures such
as stone circles. Particular concentrations of short stone rows are found in
western Scotland—in Argyll on the mainland and on inner Hebridean islands
such as Mull—and in southwestern Ireland, in Counties Cork and Kerry.
376 Short Stone Rows
Pure Mathematical Physics



Unlike stone circles, stone rows do not enclose an area so cannot be in
terpreted as demarcating a central place or sacred space. They can, however,
easily be envisaged as pointing at something, and hence have long evoked the
interest of archaeoastronomers. Certain solstitially aligned rows have
achieved considerable public notoriety, such as Gleninagh in Connemara,
western Ireland. Alexander Thom certainly saw their potential as megalithic
“observatories.” He included many British examples in his lists of monu
ments aligned upon horizon features such as hilltops and notches that marked
significant rising or setting positions of the sun, moon, and stars. The row at
Ballochroy, on the west coast of the Kintyre peninsula in southern Argyll,
Scotland, was one of his earliest published and most quoted solar observatory
sites, but it also became one of the most important case studies in demon
strating why apparent astronomical alignments, and especially those of high
precision, have to be treated with considerable care and caution.
Studies of repeated trends among regional groupings have provided the
strongest evidence that many stone rows do have astronomical connections,
though at a lower level of precision than that envisaged by Thom. In both of
the strongest geographical concentrations, the clear consistency in the orien
tation of the rows is not a simple consequence of the local topography. It ap
pears that the location of some of the monuments was carefully selected in
order to follow the prevailing tradition of orientation (and the need for a dis

tant view in certain directions) despite the general lie of the land. In south
western Ireland there are just over fifty measurable rows, and their orienta
tions are strongly clustered around northeast-southwest. The orientations of
the western Scottish rows are just as consistent, but clustered around north
south. In both cases the evidence indicates a linkage with the moon, but for
a stone row as opposed to a stone circle (the prime example being the Scot
tish recumbent stone circles), it is not obvious where in relation to the stones
any moon-related ceremonials might have taken place. Only in the case of
the handful of short stone rows on the northern part of the Isle of Mull in
western Scotland does there seem to be a clearer answer to this question.
These rows are all situated so that a prominent distant mountain is on the
very limit of visibility—in other words, it is not clearly visible unless ones
moves to one side of the row. This side, then, must be where any moon-re
lated observances would have taken place. But this in itself doesn’t help to
explain why the rows should, in the first place, be so carefully located on the
very limit of visibility.
In recent years, many archaeologists have started to question the as
sumption that, once farming spread to islands such as Britain and Ireland,
marking the beginning of the Neolithic period, people settled into permanent
villages, tending their crops and animals. Many peoples may have remained
essentially mobile, with animal herders or perhaps whole communities fol
lowing seasonal paths around the landscape. On an island such as Mull,
where soils are poor and the agricultural potential is low, it is possible that
few people lived there, even in the Bronze Age, and that they were essentially
mobile. Could monuments such as the stone rows, then, mark places that
were only visited occasionally? Or could they mark boundaries, social or
symbolic? Such ideas do not imply that lunar alignments were not an inte
gral part of these monuments but may suggest different ways in which they
could be interpreted.

eral millennia, although the position of the pole gradually shifts owing to
precession. These twin formations of stars, though identified in a variety of
ways by different peoples, have formed a conspicuous feature of the skies
for every human culture in the northern hemisphere—particularly from
temperate latitudes northward, where they are circumpolar and thus remain
visible on every clear night of the year.
Since the two constellations have similar shapes, it is not surprising that
many peoples have perceived them as larger and smaller versions of the same
thing. It is more mystifying why anyone would have conceived of them as
bears. The idea comes down to us (along with many other constellation iden
tifications) from ancient Greece. It does not require too much imagination to
interpret their shapes as pans or ladles, wagons or ploughs, but it is a great
deal more difficult to liken them to bears. This makes it all the more curious
that a number of culturally unrelated groups also, apparently, saw these con
stellations as bears. Examples include several indigenous North American
groups, such as the Iroquois and the Mi’kmaq of Nova Scotia. The desire not
to dismiss this as a coincidence has led some people to propose a radical ex
planation.
The general idea of a bear, or bears, in the sky is widespread, especially
in northerly latitudes. A variety of traditions—folk tales, public perfor
mances, and shamanic rituals—involving terrestrial bears and connected to
a Celestial Bear exist among cultures scattered throughout Europe and the
northernmost parts of Asia and the Americas, including the Basque country,
Finland, Siberia, the Kamchatka peninsula of eastern Russia, Alaska, and
eastern Canada. A common feature of many of these fragmentary traditions
is that bears were seen as the ancestors of humans and suitably revered, the
common ancestor of all being the Celestial Bear or Great Sky Bear.
In several parts of Europe, plays are still performed as part of seasonal
festivities in the winter or spring in which the players enact the story of a
bear who is hunted and killed, but subsequently returns. In Andorra, for ex
ample, the bear actor—or even a live bear—performs a dance accompanied
by musicians and masked actors representing other animals. In some places
older traditions have been reported in which an actual bear was hunted and
sacrificed, then eaten at a banquet. The American linguist Roslyn Frank ar
gues that such ceremonies represent the surviving fragments of a tradition in
which the earthly bear was seen as being “sent home,” its soul ascending up
the “sky pole” to the ancestral bear in heaven, to whom it would report on
its treatment in the earthly world. A positive report guaranteed health and
well-being for another year.
Frank argues that many of these bear myths may have a common ori
gin in an ancient worldview that predated by several millennia the great an
cient civilizations, possibly dating back as far as the Upper Palaeolithic pe

riod over 10,000 years ago. If so, then Ursa Major and Ursa Minor might
have been recognized as bears as long ago as this. And if this was the case,
it might explain how such a conception could have arrived in the Americas
carried there by the earliest settlers entering Alaska across the land bridge
that then connected it to Siberia. But such ideas are highly controversial, and
it is better to separate them into three different strands.
The first is the suggestion that in modern European folk performances
involving bears we may be glimpsing one aspect of a widespread world
view—prevalent at least as far back as Medieval times and existing alongside
the dominant Christian tradition—in which bears, seen as human ancestors,
played a key part in ensuring seasonal renewal through their connection
with an ancestral bear spirit or spirits in the sky. The second is that folk tales
and practices relating to sky bears in Europe relate directly (as opposed to
bearing a fortuitous resemblance) to indigenous cosmological beliefs and rit
uals in other parts of the northern hemisphere, with the implication that this
must represent a tradition whose origins stretch back to the very distant past.
The final strand is that these practices relate specifically to the identification
of one or two bears circling around the northern celestial pole: in other
words, that the bear(s) in the sky can consistently be identified with Ursa
Major and/or Ursa Minor. Each of these strands provides its own challenges
in terms of the available evidence and its interpretation.
Nonetheless, if we do not accept Frank’s scenario we are left with the
open questions of why celestial bear myths are so commonplace, and why
such an inherently improbable identification of these two groups of stars
seems to crop up repeatedly in entirely different places. Finally, there is the
mystery of why the celestial bear was perceived by the ancient Greeks as hav
ing a long tail, unlike terrestrial bears. There is no satisfactory explanation,
and it has been suggested that this might itself be a consequence of the trans
fer into ancient Greece of a much older tradition.

Solar Eclipses
It is a staggering coincidence—but a coincidence nonetheless—that, as seen
from the surface of the earth, the apparent diameter of the sun is more or
380 Solar Eclipses
Pure Mathematical Physics



less the same as that of the moon. It is only because of this fluke of nature
that total solar eclipses appear as spectacular as they do.
A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly in front of
the sun, just covering its disc, but rendering visible the ethereal white light
of the surrounding solar corona—the sun’s outer atmosphere—and reduc
ing the remainder of the sky to a dusk-like half-light. The same fluke of na
ture also ensures that total solar eclipses are rare, since if the alignment is
not exactly right, then the disc of the sun will never be completely covered
and the eclipse will only be partial. As long as only a small part of the sun’s
disc remains uncovered, its light will continue to light up the sky much as
normal and the eclipse might easily pass unnoticed. The same is true of an
annular eclipse, which occurs when the alignment is exact but the moon is
slightly farther away from the earth than it is on average, so that its disc ap
pears slightly smaller than usual; in this case, a thin ring of the sun’s disc re
mains uncovered.
A total solar eclipse can be seen from somewhere on earth about once
every year and a half on average, but each one is only visible from within a
narrow track, typically about 160 kilometers (100 miles) in width, though
stretching for several thousand kilometers across the surface of the planet.
From a typical spot on earth, a total solar eclipse will only occur once every
four hundred years on average. Fewer than one in four people in the past,
lacking the benefit of modern scientific foreknowledge and travel possibili
ties, would have experienced a total solar eclipse during their lifetime.
Witnessing a total solar eclipse at first hand is an awe-inspiring experi
ence. In a few moments the sun is transformed from something too bright to
be directly visible into a black disc surrounded by a wispy white halo, and
the remainder of the sky becomes as dark as early dawn or late dusk, with
planets and bright stars visible. All around, nature reacts: the atmosphere
cools, birds stop singing, and other animals are in confusion. Then, after no
more than a few minutes, and equally rapidly, normality is restored. Even in
the modern world, knowing what to expect, one is left with a profound sense
of the power and immutability of nature. There can be little doubt that the
psychological effect upon people and cultures in the past for whom such an
event occurred entirely without warning—upsetting the rhythms of nature
known and relied upon since time immemorial—was potentially devastating.
Despite this, hardly any eclipse sightings in prehistoric times have left
a definite trace in the archaeological record. Most claims of depictions of
eclipses in rock art are purely speculative. For example, on one panel in a
large petroglyph field at Pu‘u Loa on the Big Island of Hawai‘i is a design
consisting of a full circle with four adjacent crescents, increasing in size
away from it. It has been suggested that these represent the stages of a so
lar eclipse, up to and including totality. However, the crescents vary in size
Solar Eclipses 381
Pure Mathematical Physics



rather than shape, as one would expect if they were literal depictions, and
there are no symmetrical crescents on the other side of the circle, which one
might expect to represent the phases after totality. Furthermore, the cres
cent sun cannot be viewed directly. It is more likely that these symbols have
another meaning entirely. Similarly, a group of petroglyphs on a rock out
crop at Ekenburg in Sweden have been interpreted as a literal depiction of
the sky during a total eclipse in 1596 B.C.E. However, this interpretation de
pends upon a number of unsupported assumptions. Given the likely impact
of such an unexpected event on the people of the time, it seems unthinkable
that, in less than three minutes, they could have recorded the appearance of
the sky in enough detail to then reproduce it faithfully in stone.
Even in some of the great ancient empires and city-states, where liter
acy permitted detailed records to be kept of a variety of astronomical (and
meteorological) phenomena, total solar eclipses could not be reliably pre
dicted and remained greatly feared. In ancient China, for example, records
of total eclipses of the sun go back at least to about 700 B.C.E., but even two
complete millennia after this date there was no means to predict them. When
they did happen, they were taken as particularly disastrous omens for the
state, or for the Emperor himself. Babylonian astronomers were the first to
discover that lunar eclipses tend to recur after certain fixed periods of time.
This enabled them to predict lunar eclipses but not solar ones, which re
mained a sign of an impending calamity.
Across the world in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, the Maya almanac
subsequently known as the Dresden Codex contained a tabulated record of
eclipses that, once again, could have been used to provide warnings of fur
ther lunar eclipses, with a reasonable (although probably not good) success
rate—but not solar ones. The Maya city-states had collapsed by the time the
Europeans arrived, but the Aztecs continued to record eclipses, even after the
conquest. The tremendous fear felt by those natives who witnessed a total
solar eclipse in 1531 is recorded in graphic detail by the chronicler Fray
Bernardino de Sahagún.
The problem with predicting total solar eclipses is that regular cycles
(such as the Saros cycle of eighteen years and eleven days, which the Baby
lonians identified) are only crude. They take no account of various addi
tional, more complex irregularities in the motions of the earth and moon.
These small irregularities are relatively unimportant in predicting eclipses of
the moon, which affect half of the earth, but are critical if we need to pre
dict the narrow path of totality of a solar eclipse.
Many people have been keen to demonstrate that prehistoric people
could predict eclipses. Famously, the Aubrey Holes, a ring of fifty-six pits
surrounding the sarsen circle at Stonehenge in England, was interpreted by
astronomers Gerald Hawkins and Fred Hoyle in the 1960s as an eclipse-pre

dicting device. The two astronomers proposed slightly different methods,
but both schemes involved wooden posts being moved around the holes in
prescribed ways. Both methods would have successfully identified “eclipse
danger periods”—periods when a solar or lunar eclipse could occur—at
roughly six-month intervals. Eclipses of the moon could only occur at full
moons, and eclipses of the sun at new moons, falling within these danger pe
riods. However, even partial solar eclipses would only occur on average once
every two and a half years, and a total solar eclipse would only happen on
average once in several generations. Hawkins’s scheme only successfully pre
dicted a fraction of eclipses; Hoyle claimed that his own method would have
successfully predicted about half. However, further debate about the relative
merits of either scheme is unnecessary. The Aubrey Holes are just one of the
several Neolithic pit circles known in Britain, of a range of sizes. It is ar
chaeological nonsense to pick this one as a potential eclipse predictor while
ignoring the rest.

Few would doubt that total solar eclipses, when they did occur in the
past, could have made a huge impression on the people who witnessed them.
Where historical or written records exist they give us concrete information
about particular eclipse observations and their social impact. But we must
beware of letting our eagerness to find notable accomplishments back in pre
history lead us to invent archaeological evidence that is simply not there.

Solstices
If one were to go to a fixed spot every morning and watch the sun rise be
yond a horizon full of distinctive features, such as distant mountains and
valleys, it would soon become obvious that the rising position moves along
the horizon day by day. During the months of January to May, the daily
change is northward, becoming noticeably smaller in early June and finally
almost imperceptible, until it comes to stop on or very close to June 21. Af
ter this, the motion is southward once again, at first imperceptible, but
gradually hastening until by August the change is almost a whole solar di
ameter each day. By the end of November, the daily progress noticeably
slows once again, until the southerly limit is reached on or about December

21. Exactly the same pattern would emerge if one were to watch sunsets
rather than sunrises. The dates when the limits are reached, June 21 and De
cember 21, are known as the solstices.
In a location north of the tropics, the farther north the sun rises and
sets, the higher it climbs in the sky during the day. The June solstice occurs,
as a consequence, in summer. Thus in the northern hemisphere, June 21 is
generally known as the summer solstice and December 21 as the winter sol
stice. In the southern hemisphere the converse is true. However, as this can
cause confusion, especially within the tropics, the terms June solstice and
December solstice are sometimes preferable.
Outside the polar regions, the summer solstice also represents the
longest day and shortest night (technically, this may actually occur a couple
of days before or afterward, but the difference is negligible). The winter sol
stice represents the shortest day and longest night. Within the tropics,
though, this makes little difference—as one approaches the equator all days
in the year come to have the same length.
The solstices are widely recognized culturally. Historically, summer and
winter solstice festivals are documented the world over. The winter solstice
in particular is a time of death and renewal, a time when, for many human
communities, the sun must be halted in its southward (or northward in the
southern hemisphere) progress and brought back—for example, by shaman
istic intervention—to enable a new growing season. The indigenous Chu
mash of California were just one of many peoples who held a major cere
mony at this time because they believed human intervention to be necessary
in order to maintain the delicate balance of nature. Similar principles may
well have motivated a variety of rituals and ceremonies held at and around
the time of winter solstice, such as the Hawaiian makahiki and the Incaic
Inti Raymi. Pagan solstice festivals underlie the timing of the Christian festi
vals of the feast of St. John and Christmas.

Solstitial Alignments
The term midsummer is loosely applied: it derives from the common name,
Midsummer’s Day, for the feast of St. John, which was timed to coincide
Solstitial Alignments 385

with the earlier pagan festivals associated with the summer solstice. Mid
summer sunrise, then, really means “sunrise at the summer solstice.” Like
wise, midsummer sunset means “sunset at the summer solstice,” and mid
winter sunrise and sunset refer to sunrise and sunset at the winter solstice.
The direction of midsummer sunrise is always in the northeast quad
rant of the horizon for an observer in the northern hemisphere (southeast in
the southern hemisphere), but the exact azimuth depends upon the ob
server’s latitude and the altitude of the horizon in that direction. The same
applies to midsummer sunset (northwest in the northern hemisphere, south
west in the southern hemisphere), midwinter sunrise (southeast in the north
ern hemisphere, northeast in the southern hemisphere), and midwinter sun
set (southwest in the northern hemisphere, northwest in the southern
hemisphere). The only exceptions to this rule occur in the Arctic and Antarc
tic regions, where the midwinter sun never rises and the midsummer sun
never sets.
A great many architectural alignments upon midwinter sunrise have
been noted from a variety of places and times. The most famous is the align
ment of the passage at Newgrange passage tomb in Ireland, built in the late
fourth millennium B.C.E. Similar—in the sense that sunlight only penetrates
into a dark space just after sunrise at the winter solstice—but very much
older is the palaeolithic cave at Parpalló in eastern Spain. If deliberate, this
alignment may date back as far as 19,000 B.C.E.
Midsummer sunrise alignments include what is arguably the most fa
mous solstitial alignment of them all, along the axis of the sarsen monument
at Stonehenge in England, toward the Heelstone. Ironically, though, it is
quite likely that the alignment in the opposite direction, toward midwinter
sunset, was of greater significance to the builders.
Alignments upon sunset at one or the other solstice seem to be no less
common than those upon sunrise. A well-known example from North
America is the Serpent Mound, a 180-meter- (600-foot)-long serpent-shaped
effigy mound in southern Ohio, whose head faces the direction of midsum
mer sunset. Midwinter sunset at Kintraw in western Scotland was one of the
earliest claimed examples of a high-precision sightline using a prominent
notch in the natural horizon as a foresight. But that claim has not withstood
the test of time.
Other controversial examples of solstitial alignments include the
Bronze Age site at Brainport Bay, again in Scotland, where a fierce debate
arose about whether the alignment of archaeological features, indubitably
oriented upon midsummer sunrise, was precise and “calendrical” or less pre
cise and “ceremonial.” The circular sanctuary of timber posts at the Dacian
sanctuary of Sarmizegetusa Regia in Romania (late first millennium B.C.E.) is
said to face midwinter sunrise, but here the problem is that the alignment ex
386 Solstitial Alignments

ists only in a theoretical sense, since the high horizon in the relevant direc
tion displaces the actual direction of sunrise on the shortest day by some ten
degrees along the horizon.
The significance of the solstitial directions is often cosmological rather
than practical/calendrical, although the two are not mutually exclusive. In
Hopi tradition, the main importance of the solstitial directions is that they
define the fundamental divisions of the world into four parts. However, ob
servations of the changing position of the rising and setting sun are also cru
cial in regulating their elaborate seasonal calendar. This includes, on the sol
stices themselves, laying prayer sticks on shrines that are themselves placed
in the landscape along the solstitial directions.
A key issue is the extent to which we find solstitial alignments because
we are looking for them. Nobody would deny that the directions of sunrise
and sunset at the solstices are hugely significant in many cultures; the ques
tion is the extent to which we approach other cultural traditions armed with
a “toolkit” that reflects our own predilections and preferences, and whether
this can make us (perhaps unwittingly) selective with the evidence and hence
biases our interpretation. To give just one example, the solstitial orientation
of the Big Horn medicine wheel in Wyoming, when first announced in the
1970s, engendered much debate because of the suspicion that archaeoas
tronomers were simply extending the techniques and methods of British ar
chaeoastronomy uncritically into North America. In general, such issues can
only be satisfactorily addressed by paying careful attention to field method
ology, the cultural context, and the broader archaeological/historical evi
dence of the site.

Solstitial Directions
The direction of sunrise at the June solstice represents the northernmost
limit of the range of horizon, centered upon east, where the sun will rise on
different days through the year. Similarly, the direction of sunrise at the De
cember solstice represents the southernmost limit of this range. Likewise,
the directions of sunset at the June and December solstices represent, re
spectively, the northern and southern limits of the western range of horizon
where the sun sets at different times of the year.
Everywhere on earth apart from the polar regions, the directions of
June solstice sunrise and sunset, and of December solstice sunrise and sun
set, fall respectively within the northeast, northwest, southeast and south
west quadrants of the horizon. These four directions divide the horizon into
four distinct parts. The eastern part represents the range of horizon within
which the sun always rises; everywhere in this range is a point where the sun
will rise at some time during the year. Similarly, the western part represents
the range within which the sun always sets. In northern temperate zones, the
southern part represents the horizon the sun passes over each day; the di
rection of the sun in the middle of the day. Things facing in this direction will
be open to the light of the sun. The north, on the other hand, is a “dark” di
rection. (The properties of the north and south parts are reversed in the
southern hemisphere.)
Each of these four directions, in other words, has distinct properties
and, in different human societies, can acquire distinct cosmological conno
tations. In one type of quadripartite cosmology (perceived division of the
world, as viewed from some central place, into four parts), the boundaries
between the different quarters of the world are formed by the solstitial di
rections. One example of this is the worldview of the Hopi people of Ari
zona. Another example is the layout of the Andean village of Misminay. It
can be misleading to speak of a “quartering” of the world, since the four
“quarters” are generally nowhere near equal in size: in fact, equal quarters
are only possible (depending upon the horizon altitude) at latitudes of
around fifty-five degrees (north and south). Closer to the equator, the east
and west parts become narrower and the north and south parts wider. At the
equator itself, the east and west parts are only about 47 degrees wide, and
the north and south parts are 133 degrees wide.
As one approaches the polar regions, the northern and southern
“quarters” rapidly shrink away, and in the polar regions themselves the
quadripartite model is not applicable at all. Here, every part of the horizon
is the rising or setting point of the sun at some time in the year. Indeed, there
is a period around the winter solstice when the sun never rises above the
horizon at all, and a period around the summer solstice when the sun never
sets. The length of this period depends upon the latitude, but it is clearly a

Somerville, Boyle (1864–1936)
Henry Boyle Townshend Somerville was one of a handful of keen amateur
astronomers and surveyors in the early part of the twentieth century who
extended the work of Sir Norman Lockyer by carrying out their own sur
veys of megalithic monuments. Having risen to the rank of vice-admiral in
the Royal Navy, he retired in 1919. After he returned to his native County
Cork, he was responsible for the first published archaeoastronomical sur
veys and interpretations of a number of Irish chambered tombs, stone cir
cles, and rows. It was he, for example, who first drew attention to the sol
stitial orientation of the stone circle at Drombeg.
Somerville is best known, however, for first drawing attention in 1912
to the possible lunar orientation of some of the standing stones at Callanish
on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland. One consequence of his paper on Callanish,
published in the Journal of the British Astronomical Association, was to trig
ger the interest of Alexander Thom, who went on to become one of the most
influential twentieth-century figures in the field. More fundamentally,
though, it contained the first suggestion that a prehistoric monument might
have been aligned upon the horizon rising or setting point of the moon, not
just of the sun or stars. This initiated a line of inquiry that is still bearing fruit
today among the Bronze Age monuments of Scotland and Ireland, in partic
ular the Scottish recumbent stone circles and some of the short stone rows
found in western Scotland and western Ireland.
Somerville was murdered in 1936 by Irish republican activists, who saw
him as encouraging Irish recruits into the British armed forces.

Son Mas
Scattered around Mallorca, the largest and most mountainous of the
Balearic Islands in the western Mediterranean, are a number of walled sanc
tuaries built during the first millennium B.C.E. that seem to have been the
setting for various ritual activities. Son Mas, near the northwest coast, is
one of the largest of them but seems to have been in use for a far longer pe
riod: radiocarbon dates stretch back into the third millennium B.C.E. How
ever, there is a curious gap around 1700 B.C.E., when the site seems to have
been abandoned for several centuries for no reason that is apparent from
the archaeology, before being rebuilt and reoccupied.
The reason that the earlier sanctuary was so precipitously abandoned
remained unexplained until the site was studied archaeoastronomically.
Like the taulas of Menorca, it faces south, but in the direction of a nearby
valley flanked by steep hills. This is indicated by a curious, artificial groove
cut into the side of a large upright boulder in front of the sanctuary. When
the Southern Cross and Pointers appeared down low in the southern sky,
passing almost horizontally, from east to west, they would have passed
across this valley and hung spectacularly in the sky just above it. But due to
precession they would have gotten gradually lower century by century un
til they were beginning to disappear in around 1700 B.C.E. The result, quite
plausibly, would have been a crisis, and it was that which caused the sanc
tuary to be abandoned.

Space and Time, Ancient Perceptions of
Long before the invention of writing or the construction of observing in
struments, people made sense of the world by linking objects, events, and
cycles of activity, both on the land and in the sky. The regular cycles of the
skies were often vital in developing notions of temporality, in the sense that
they were used to regulate both practical and ritualistic aspects of human
activity and played a crucial role in the development of calendars. But this
is a very different matter from saying that astronomical periodicities were
used to measure units of time, because this assumes an abstract notion of
time that may not be appropriate in a non-Western worldview. The same
can be said of an abstract notion of space.

For us, time progresses along a line and provides a backdrop against
which we live our lives, constantly measurable from calendars and clocks that
have become divorced from the physical, observable phenomena in the natu
ral world that once generated them. Likewise, we measure our position in
space using maps or GPS receivers that fit comfortably in the hand and, at the
touch of a button, deliver our spatial coordinates to within a few meters.
Prehistoric peoples and others in the past who lacked such devices
would have been no less aware of the passage of time. The basic needs of
survival and subsistence would have forced them to keep their own actions
in tune with various regularly recurring events going on in the natural world
around them. It is also likely that the regular cycles of the heavens, starting
with the most obvious one of them all—the phase cycle of the moon—pro
vided a key point of reference for many and led to the eventual development
of early calendars. But we must be careful not to approach the issue too
naively. The passage of time (as we would think of it) might have been con
ceived in many different ways. One of the most fundamental conceptual dis
tinctions is between circular and linear time—the one implying an endless
perceived repetition of regular events and the other a single history and fu
ture. The ancient Maya are noted for having used both conceptions in par
allel, in the form of the Calendar Round and the Long Count. Even the dis
tinctions between past, present, and future break down differently in many
other systems of thought.
Similarly, there are numerous ways of perceiving the world that differ
from our view of things separated by empty space, from which stems our
own idea of space as an abstract backdrop. Notions of the spatial interrela
tionship of things were inherently contextualized in places and paths with
particular qualities and meanings. Furthermore, spatial and temporal attri
butes of things were intricately bound together in many ways, with the dis
tinction between them (as we would see it) rather blurred. Thus, for the
Lakota, the names and meanings of some places changed according to the
time of year as they followed the buffalo through the landscape, mimicking
the passage of the sun through the sky. The Aztecs, it has been claimed,
linked the mountain dwelling of the rain god Tlaloc, the time when the sun
rose in line with this mountain as viewed from an ancient pyramid
(Cuicuilco), and the time when child sacrifices should be offered to Tlaloc in
order to ensure rain and fertility in the coming growing season. And more
generally, horizon calendars such as those of the Hopi, or those thought to
have operated in central Mexico in pre-conquest times, function by directly
associating time (a particular calendar date) with place (the point on the
horizon where the sun rises or sets on the day in question).
Although such arguments give us a number of reasons for seeking as
tronomical alignments in the prehistoric context, they also provide a warn

ing against pre-judging potential horizon targets of astronomical signifi
cance. Thus, while the solstitial directions have an obvious physical reality
(as the limiting positions of sunrise or sunset on the horizon), the equinoxes,
in general, do not. They are commonly taken as self-evident horizon targets,
but in fact they only make sense as half-way points between the solstices in
space and/or time, and this implies an abstract view of either or both. For a
Neolithic Briton standing in a sacred stone circle, the date when (say) a cru
cial crop should be planted, or when the sun rose behind a particular sacred
mountain—both very concrete associations (though of very different
types)—are much more likely to have been significant than the abstract
equinoxes. This makes it much more difficult for the modern archaeoas
tronomer to determine whether any stone circles intentionally incorporated
symbolic alignments upon sunrise on significant days, since different days
are likely to have been significant—and so the “targets” would have dif
fered—from one stone circle to another. Only solstitial alignments could
show up consistently in a statistical analysis of several sites taken together.

ous objects hanging close together in a clear blue (and otherwise quite
empty) sky, either in the early evening or the early morning, is likely to have
given rise to what is one of the best known and most widespread celestial
icons—the star and crescent symbol. In various forms it can be found on the
flags of several modern Islamic countries, including Turkey, Pakistan, Alge
ria, and Azerbaijan; on modern coins from European countries such as Italy
and Romania; on coins from ancient Rome, Greece, and Persia; and even in
prehistoric rock art from various parts of the world.
The star and crescent is mostly widely recognized in the modern world
as a symbol of the Islamic faith, although its origin in this context is much
older. It originally passed into several Islamic countries from the Ottoman
Empire, and its use within what is now Turkey can be traced back to the
third millennium B.C.E. Although it is often claimed that the symbol (in this
context) owes its origins to a particular astronomical event, several different
candidates have been proposed, and there is really no firm evidence to sup
port any of them.
Elsewhere, where the symbol arose in quite independent cultural con
texts, the motivation is most likely to have been one or more sightings of a

spectacular but not unduly rare. And one of the most famous rock art de

tually a set of four symbols used to mark a sun-watching station.

Star Compasses of the Pacific
Micronesian and Polynesian navigators used the stars in different ways to
help them find their way across the open waters of the Pacific Ocean at
night. One method was to learn the sequence of stars that would rise or set
in the direction in which one wished to sail—the relevant star path or
kavienga (as it was known in Tonga). The New Zealander David Lewis
recorded a few surviving stone structures used for committing a given star
path to memory. A single sighting stone in Tonga and two sets of sighting
stones in the Gilbert Islands (Kiribati) farther to the north seem to have
been set up to mark the directions to various distant islands. (The direction
marked was usually somewhat displaced from the actual azimuth of the tar
get island, so that landfall could be achieved by running with the prevailing
wind and current.) By sighting along one of these lines sufficiently often and
for sufficiently long periods, the novice navigator would come to recognize
the succession of stars that marked a particular course. On the island of
Beru in Kiribati, Lewis observed the continuing use of a stone canoe for a
similar purpose.
When traveling greater distances, following more complex courses, or
exploring rather than traveling to predetermined and familiar places, navi
gators needed a wider knowledge of the stars in order to set different courses
from different locations in the ocean. The difficulty is that there are so many
stars in the sky that to memorize the rising and setting positions of many
hundreds of them would surely be impracticable. One Micronesian example
of a star compass, which was analyzed in detail by the ethnographer Ward
H. Goodenough in the 1950s, overcame this problem in a clever way. (It ex
isted in a number of slightly different forms among the Caroline Islands of
the western Pacific, although the underlying principles are common to all the
variants.) The Carolinian navigator typically relied on just fifteen reference
394 Star Compasses of the Pacific

stars or star groups whose rising and setting positions marked thirty direc
tions around the horizon. The north and south directions, in addition, were
indicated by Polaris and the upright Southern Cross. The relative positions
of these thirty-two guide points around the horizon were carefully memo
rized: the spacing was not particularly regular, but then it didn’t need to be.
In practice, at a given time on a given night, few of the guide stars
would generally be anywhere near to rising or setting, and many would not
be visible in the sky at all. However, the Carolines are situated quite close to
the equator, and the paths of the stars through the sky in this region are more
or less vertical (this is only not the case in the vicinity of the celestial poles).
This means that it was relatively easy to trace the paths of visible stars down
to the horizon. This technique provided a number of reference points. The
experienced navigator could then fill in the gaps and deduce the positions of
all of the thirty-two guide directions that constituted his mental compass in
order to orient himself.
No such detailed accounts exist of star compasses in Polynesia, al
though it is clear from the accounts of Captain James Cook and other early
European explorers that Polynesians made extensive use of directional stars
for navigation. There is, however, a suggestion that a navigational device in
the form of a large hollowed-out gourd was used in Polynesia. The “sacred
calabash” was carried in the canoe for use as a horizon compass or a sort of
sextant for determining latitude. This interpretation has been hotly con
tested, but there is certainly evidence of the use of navigation gourds in the
Hawaiian islands after European contact. In addition, at least one Hawaiian
account recorded in the nineteenth century suggests that large gourds were
used, back on land, as visual aids for teaching about the skies.

Star Names
Individual stars and groups of stars have different names in different cul
tures, but in order to speak of these we need to identify them unambigu
ously using reference names acceptable to everyone. It makes sense to fol
low the nomenclature used by modern astronomers.
Many stars have generally agreed upon proper names, such as Sirius,
Arcturus, Vega, Rigel, and Betelgeuse. However, just as the world is divided
into countries, so the sky is now divided up into strictly defined regions
modern constellations. This means that all stars, whether named or not, be
long to a modern constellation. The convention is to label the most promi
nent stars in each constellation, usually in order of brightness but sometimes
according to their position, using the Greek letters—α (alpha), β (beta), γ
(gamma), δ (delta), ε (epsilon), ζ (zeta), and so on—combined with the con
stellation name (actually the Latin genitive): thus Sirius, the brightest star in
Canis Major, is α Canis Majoris. One example best known by its name in
this form is α Centauri.
Each constellation also has a three-letter abbreviation, for example Dra
for Draco(nis), CMa for Canis Major(is), and Ori for Orion. Thus Betel
geuse is α Ori, Rigel is β Ori, and Sirius is α CMa. Other conventions hold
for fainter stars but are generally of no relevance to archaeoastronomy or
ethnoastronomy.

Star of Bethlehem
According to the Christian scriptures—specifically, the Gospel of St.
Matthew—wise men from the east arrived in Jerusalem to worship the King
of the Jews, declaring that they had seen his star in the east. As they jour
neyed southward to Bethlehem the star went before them until it stopped
over the place where the child was. Ever since the third century, scholars
have struggled to find a concrete explanation for what has become known
as the Star of Bethlehem. Twentieth-century efforts are reflected in scores of
books and literally hundreds of articles in academic journals.
Although translations differ, one reading of Matthew’s account, as
suming that it does indeed have its basis in observed fact, interprets “star in
the east” as “star at its rising.” We must then assume that the journey to
396 Star Names

Bethlehem was made when the star was high in the sky ahead of the Magi,
to the south. Clearly it could not have stopped dead in the sky, so “stopped
over” is then taken to mean “set behind.”
Several types of spectacular astronomical phenomena have been identi
fied as leading candidates. The historical context, which fixes the date of
Christ’s birth to around 6 B.C.E., provides a strong constraint. On the as
sumption that the Star of Bethlehem was literally a star, but an unfamiliar
one that suddenly appeared in the sky at the time, an obvious possibility is
a nova or supernova. The latter is a dying star that gains hugely in bright
ness for a short period, typically just a few weeks. Some supernovae are even
visible by day, so we would not be forced to speculate that the Magi traveled
by night. Unfortunately, if a supernova had occurred at the time we would
expect Chinese astronomers to have recorded a “guest star.” They did not,
unless one counts a “tailed object,” more probably a comet, seen in the
spring of 5 B.C.E. Another possibility is a conjunction (close coming together)
of two planets, each themselves among the brightest objects in the sky. In the
summer and autumn of 7 B.C.E., the planets Jupiter and Saturn passed each
other three times. Nonetheless, eye-catching as this would have been, they
would still have been seen as two “stars” and would only have led the way
at night. Some have argued that it was the succession of several rather un
usual astronomical phenomena that augured great events, but this stretches
credulity even further.
A serious weakness in all of these arguments is that they fail to take ac
count of the Magi’s own worldview. The Magi were astrologers, probably
from Persia. We know that astrological prognostications of the time derived
from a complex set of interrelationships between the planets and the zodia
cal constellations they appeared in. We also know that each constellation
had terrestrial associations, and that Aries or Pisces was associated with Ju
daea. American astronomer Michael Molnar has recently argued from this
standpoint that an occultation of the planet Jupiter by the moon (in other
words, the moon passing directly in front of the planet) that occurred in the
constellation of Aries in the spring of 6 B.C.E. was an astrological portent of
enormous significance and pointed directly to the birth of a new king in Ju
daea. In Molnar’s reading, Matthew’s “rising in the east” refers to a plane
tary heliacal rising, and “stopping” to retrograde motion. Aspects of this in
terpretation continue to be strongly debated. Most controversially, the
occultation in question would actually have been rendered invisible by the
light of the sun. This would not have diminished its astrological significance,
but the question remains of whether the astrologers of the time would have
been able to calculate it.
Be this as it may, it seems obvious in retrospect that the solution to the
Star of Bethlehem mystery lies not in events that would be considered con

terms of the horoscopes generated by the astrologers of the time.

Star Rising and Setting Positions
Any given star, viewed from a given place, traces the same path across the
celestial dome night after night. Though it always rises and sets in the same
place, the time of day when these two events occur alters constantly, getting
earlier by about four minutes each night. Each of them will occur during
daylight for about half of the year, and hence be invisible. So also will all or
part of the star’s daily passage across the sky, whenever the sun is in the sky
at the same time. When people in the past observed the rising of certain
stars and aligned sacred structures upon them, the event of particular sig
nificance was often the heliacal rise, the annual event when the star first
rose sufficiently long before the sun to become visible in the predawn sky.
Observations of the rising and setting of stars are especially useful to
the navigator wishing to set or maintain a course. Micronesian and Polyne
sian navigators, for example, had an excellent knowledge of the stars asso
ciated with various directions, and this served them well during their long
voyages across the Pacific. In practice, such observations are hampered by
extinction, the dimming of a star’s light due to absorption in the intervening
atmosphere. This problem is most severe when a star is close to the sea hori
zon because its light has had to travel through a great deal more of the
earth’s atmosphere before it reaches the observer than when it is higher in
the sky. This is a potential headache for the navigator, as all but the bright
est stars may need to be considerably above the horizon to be visible at all.
However, it is less of a problem close to the equator, where the celestial bod
ies rise and set almost vertically.
Over a long timescale, the slow tumbling of the whole celestial sphere
due to precession gradually causes the rising and setting positions of stars
to drift. As a result, the place on the horizon where a star rises or sets in the
present day may be several degrees away from where it rose or set at the

time of interest (for example when a monumental alignment was built) sev
eral centuries or more in the past. Some stars that (for locations in the
northern hemisphere) rise and set close to due south (or close to due north
in the southern hemisphere) may not have appeared above the horizon at
all at certain times in the past, while others visible then may since have dis
appeared.
Precession limits our confidence when we try to identify putative stel
lar alignments at ancient monuments, since there is invariably some (and of
ten considerable) uncertainty about the date of construction and use. Ex
tinction adds a further complication to the interpretation of such alignments,
especially at high latitudes where stars rise and set at a considerable angle to
the vertical, since it is difficult to be sure about exactly where a given star
was when it appeared or disappeared.

Statistical Analysis
The need for statistical analysis arises in archaeoastronomy because astro
nomical patterns we perceive in the archaeological record may have come
about purely by chance, or to be more precise, as a result of factors quite
unrelated to astronomy. Doubts about intentionality can apply to a whole
range of types of evidence concerning ancient astronomy: monuments
aligned upon the rising and setting positions of astronomical bodies; dis
plays of sunlight and shadow only visible on rare occasions; groups of mon
uments placed so that their positions on the ground mimic the shape of a
constellation; patterns of tally marks carved on rocks or portable artifacts
that include could have functioned as calendars; and so on.
In the formative days of archaeoastronomy in the 1960s to 1980s, sta
tistical analysis was most extensively applied in assessing monumental align
ments. Indeed, this approach came to characterize the “green,” or European,
approach to archaeoastronomy, which focused on prehistoric monuments
without the benefit of related historical or written evidence. Broadly speak
ing, the approach taken was that pioneered by the Scottish engineer Alexan
der Thom, which was to accumulate data from many alignments and deter
mine the declination of the horizon point “indicated” by each alignment,
and then to use statistical methods to determine whether observed declina

tion “peaks”—repeated occurrences of particular declinations—were in fact
significant. If so, then a consistent astronomical purpose was evident and the
question could be asked, which astronomical body the given declination
might have corresponded to.
Devising a suitable statistical test is by no means straightforward.
Sometimes one can only resort to Monte-Carlo testing, a method by which
one generates, for example, randomly oriented sets of monuments in the
computer and sees in what proportion of cases they contain at least as many
of a particular type of alignment as were found in the “real” data. If the an
swer is, say, only once in every thousand runs, then one can conclude that
the chances of the real data having arisen fortuitously are only one in a thou
sand; as this probability is so small, it is fair to conclude that the alignments
were deliberately intended. However, there are a number of dangers and pit
falls with this method. An obvious one is that the data must be fairly se
lected. Even leaving out one site simply because it seems to be pointing in a
different direction from all the rest (and it is often easy enough to find ret
rospective reasons for doing this) can badly distort the results and so under
mine any statistical conclusions.
A less obvious but more fundamental difficulty relates to the whole na
ture of hypothesis testing in this way. Many statistical procedures assume
that the hypothesis preceded the data, whereas in an archaeological context,
a particular interpretation is generally first suggested by the data (or most of
it), since archaeologists do not have the opportunity for repeated experi
ments. The hypothesis that we choose to test may itself be selected from in
numerable possibilities. To take an example, it is a well-known though as
tonishing fact that if twenty-three people are selected randomly, there is an
even chance that two of them will have the same birthday. However, if we
took such a group, observed that two of them had birthdays (say) on July
27, and on the basis of that chose to assess the chances (test the hypothesis)
that two July 27 birthdays could have arisen among the group purely fortu
itously, we would obtain the result “highly unlikely.” The reason, of course,
is that we chose to test the “July 27” hypothesis (rather than any one of 364
others) because the data contained that pattern in the first place. In short,
statistical methods must be used with considerable care, especially where
they purport to assign significance levels to particular results.
Nowadays there is a much greater reliance on simply displaying the
data. If certain trends are strong enough, then their intentionality is obvious,
as is the case for the orientations of numerous local groups of later prehis
toric tombs and temples in western Europe. Where we need to assess sets of
measured declinations, Alexander Thom’s method of curvigrams—graphs
showing accumulations of probability—seems as good a method of visualiz
ing the likely significance of repeatedly occurring declinations as any. The
400 Statistical Analysis
Pure Mathematical Physics



fair selection of data remains a much more crucial issue.
In recent years archaeoastronomers have begun to recognize the poten
tial of a rather different statistical approach: the Bayesian paradigm. This
approach allows one to assess data repeatedly against different “prior” ideas
and to take into account background information. It is especially useful
where we are trying to integrate different types of evidence, such as histori
cal records.
However, we must look beyond statistical analysis if we wish to do
more than establish the intentionality of astronomical alignments or other
astronomically related patterns evident in the archaeological record. No
amount of statistical analysis can help with the interpretation of their signif
icance and meaning to the people who built and used them.

Stone Circles
The stone circle is a type of later prehistoric monument that is commonly
found in northwestern Europe but is also found elsewhere in Europe and
also in certain other parts of the world. Over 1,300 examples survive in
Britain, Ireland, and Brittany, ranging from a few meters to over 350 me
ters in diameter and containing from five to over thirty standing stones. The
stones at some stone circles are mere stumps and rounded boulders; at oth
ers they are great monoliths several meters in height.
Stone circles are not always found in isolation. They can be found sur
rounding tombs, as at Newgrange, or within the banks and ditches of
henges, as at Avebury; they can also be connected to lines or avenues of
stones, as at Callanish and Beaghmore. Some of the most complex arrange
ments of several circles and stone alignments are the stone monuments of

mid-Ulster. The designs of individual circles are also quite diverse, with a
number of regional variants. One of the most distinctive of these is the re
cumbent stone circle, where one stone is placed on its side. Others include
stone circles with entrances, circles with outlying standing stones, embanked
circles, and “circles” with distinctive shapes such as ellipses or flattened cir
cles. (Since many are nowhere near true circles, some have suggested that
stone circles should more correctly be called “stone rings.”)
It is difficult to date a stone circle, but most northwest European ex
amples are thought to have been built in the Later Neolithic or earlier part
of the Bronze Age, broadly in the third and second millennia B.C.E. Stones
were sometimes transported several kilometers to the site; famously (al
though exceptionally) the Stonehenge bluestones, weighing up to four tons
each, were transported over sea and land some three hundred kilometers
(two hundred miles) from the Preseli mountains in southwest Wales.
The purpose of stone circles has long been a mystery. Only a minority
are directly associated with tombs. Cists containing small burials are found
in some of them, but these are often late additions, perhaps placed at what

was already an ancient hallowed or ancestral place whose original purpose
was long forgotten. Other than this, archaeological excavations tend to find
little in the way of stratigraphy and artifacts, so that for many years stone
circles were largely ignored by archaeologists—so much so that the British
archaeologist Aubrey Burl once referred to them as the “personae non gratae
of British prehistory” (Ruggles 2002, p. 176). Yet an obvious assumption
as for any open ring, whether built of earth, timber, or stone—is that they
demarcated a piece of special or sacred ground, perhaps a place used for a
ceremonial gathering or ritual activity. This means it makes sense to study
the form of the rings, their position in the landscape, and their relationship
to visible features in the surrounding environment, including objects in the
sky. Such investigations are now carried out by archaeologists, but until late
in the twentieth century they were the almost exclusive preserve of engineers,
astronomers, and others from outside the discipline.
One of the most famous of these was the engineer Alexander Thom,
who proposed that many British stone circles were laid out using a standard
unit of measurement, the “megalithic yard,” of 0.83 meters (2.72 feet). He
also claimed that many evidently noncircular rings represent precise geo
metrical constructions, such as ellipses and various types of “flattened cir
cle,” laid out using Pythagorean triangles more than a millennium before
they were (re)discovered by Pythagoras. Given all this, Thom’s other main
idea—that many stone circles incorporated remarkably precise alignments
upon the rising and setting positions of the sun, moon, and certain stars
seemed less surprising.
However, time has dealt harshly with the specifics of “megalithic men
suration,” “megalithic geometry,” and “megalithic astronomy,” even though
Thom himself is remembered as an important pioneer in getting people to
think about such issues. Statistical reappraisals of the diameters of stone cir
cles, given the large size of the stones and their often poor state of preserva
tion, only gives marginal support for the notion that some common unit
(perhaps related to the average human pace) was used in setting out many of
them; there is no sustainable evidence whatsoever for the idea of a precise
measuring stick being carried the length and breadth of later prehistoric
Britain. Similarly, the observed shapes of stone circles can all be adequately
explained by the use of simpler construction techniques: there is no need to
resort to Thom’s geometrical constructions. Some have even argued that
these monuments may all simply be poor attempts at circles, or that the pre
cise shape didn’t matter and was simply laid out by eye.
A major problem with studying possible astronomical alignments at
stone circles is the number of different ways in which such an alignment
might have been set up: in the direction of the entrance where one exists; in
the direction of the tallest stone; from the circle center to an outlier where
Stone Circles 403

one exists, or vice versa; (either way) along the main axis where one can be
identified (e.g., in the case of an elliptical ring); (either way) between the
tallest stones; and so on. At many stone circles, many potential alignments
of various types may exist, making it quite likely—even, in some cases,
highly probable—that one or more of them will align purely by chance upon
a prominent feature in the landscape or a major celestial body or event. This
means that in order to have some degree of confidence that any alignment
we spot was actually intentional and meaningful, we have to pay particular
attention to questions of methodology.
In just a few types of stone circle, one direction of alignment stands out
from any others as possibly significant. Where this occurs we find some of
the strongest evidence of an intense interest in the sun and/or moon, al
though not consistently. In this context the Scottish recumbent stone circles
and the Irish axial stone circles are particularly important. However, as with
mensuration and geometry, the high precision astronomical alignments en
visaged by Thom have not withstood the test of time. They simply cannot be
convincingly demonstrated on the basis of the evidence available. Though
absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, until and unless such evi
dence emerges, we have no need to fit chiefs, shamans, or priests obsessed
with the minutiae of the moon’s motions over several generations into our
models of later prehistoric societies in Britain and Ireland.
On the other hand, solar and lunar alignments of less than pinpoint ac
curacy are nonetheless highly fascinating. They suggest, for example, that
circles may have become charged with meaning at certain times, when the
celestial bodies reached particular configurations in relation to the stones of
the circle. At some sites, other forms of archaeological evidence reinforce the
idea of ceremonies taking place when the celestial configuration was right. A
good example of this is the scatters of moon-reflecting white stones such as
quartz that are found around the base of the recumbent stone at some Scot
tish recumbent stone circles, reinforcing the idea that ceremonies took place
here by the light of the full moon on a midsummer evening when it appeared
low over the recumbent stone. Such ideas must be considered in the broader
context of cosmological ideas that could have viewed these monuments as
microcosms or placed them conceptually at the very center of the world.

Stonehenge
Stonehenge, one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, has
long been associated with astronomy. Situated on the chalk uplands of the
Wessex region in southern England, in the county of Wiltshire, the monu
ment is characterized by its huge sarsen stones, some of which stand over
seven meters (twenty-two feet) tall. The tallest are the remains of five
trilithons (two uprights with a horizontal lintel placed across their tops)
arranged in the shape of a horseshoe, and these are surrounded by what
was once a continuous ring of only slightly less tall uprights and lintels. Al
most unimaginably, these huge stones, weighing up to forty tons apiece,
were dragged here, down- and uphill, over a distance of some thirty kilo
meters (eighteen miles) from the Marlborough Downs to the north. Where
the stones have collapsed it is possible to see some of the carefully carved
mortice-and-tenon and tongue-and-groove joints (joints that would nor
mally be associated with woodworking) that were used to hold them to
gether. The horseshoe is oriented northeastwards. Looking out in this di
rection through a well-preserved section of the outer circle of sarsens, one
sees a much rougher stone, leaning over and badly weathered. This is the
famous Heelstone, which stands some sixty meters outside the outer ring.
The purpose and function of the great stone monument at Stonehenge
has been a source of speculation for centuries. That it was a place of great
power is self-evident. Regarding astronomy, it has been portrayed variously
as a cosmic temple, a calendrical device, an observatory, and an eclipse cal
culator. Many of these ideas have attracted widespread public interest.
However, the majority of astronomical theories concerning Stonehenge
have little hard evidence to support them. Many are based on the idea that,
at one stage or another, the monument incorporated deliberate architectural
alignments upon the rising and setting positions of celestial bodies, particu
larly the sun or moon. The problem is that every architectural alignment must
point somewhere, and many factors might have influenced any particular ori
entation. Just because a pair of stones is aligned upon, say, the position of
sunrise at one of the solstices, does not mean that this was deliberate or that
it meant anything at all to the people who built and used the monument. We
must be particularly cautious if we only find a modest number of potential as
tronomical alignments among a great many possibilities: and there are hun
dreds of ways of aligning different pairs of stones at Stonehenge.
Stonehenge 405
Pure Mathematical Physics



One of the most famous astronomical speculations about Stonehenge is
that it functioned as a calculating device for predicting eclipses. Put forward
in the early 1960s in a popular book by Gerald Hawkins entitled Stonehenge
Decoded, and later elaborated by the astronomer Fred Hoyle, the idea is ba
sically that a small number of wooden posts were moved around the Aubrey
Holes according to strictly defined rules (the two authors suggested different
methods). When certain configurations were reached, then it was a “danger
period” when eclipses could occur.
The Aubrey Holes are a ring of fifty-six pits surrounding the sarsen
monument, named after the antiquarian John Aubrey who discovered them
in the seventeenth century. Concrete markers mark their positions for the
modern visitor. Those who challenged the theory were often asked “why
were there fifty-six Aubrey Holes, then?” But to try to answer this question
is to miss the point. There has to be some number of holes in the ring, even
if it was created for some other purpose; and we may never know with any
certitude what that purpose was. Some astronomers in the 1960s showed
that the number fifty-six is not that special with regard to predicting eclipses:
similar post-moving schemes can be devised with other numbers of holes in
the circle. Archaeologists know of many similar pit circles in Britain, vary

ing in number from less than twenty to over a hundred. The number fifty
six is not special, then, either archaeologically or astronomically. Finally, to
further confound the Hawkins/Hoyle theory, the archaeological evidence
shows that at least some of the Aubrey Holes at Stonehenge held permanent
timber posts, albeit possibly after being left open for a time.
To be plausible, astronomical theories at Stonehenge must be consistent
with what we know of the chronological development of the monument
from the many archaeological investigations that have taken place there,
particularly during the twentieth century. The great sarsen circle and
trilithons, constructed in about 2400 B.C.E., were not the first construction
that left its trace at this spot. The smaller bluestones had been brought there
all the way from the Preseli mountains in South Wales, a distance of some
300 kilometers (200 miles), perhaps a century earlier. And some four or five
centuries earlier still, an earthen enclosure, consisting of a circular ditch and
inner bank, was built here, probably broadly contemporary with the Aubrey
pits/posts. Yet, more remarkably, the postholes of five huge timber poles,
erected several millennia earlier, in about 8000 B.C.E., were discovered dur
ing the construction of the Stonehenge parking lot in the 1970s.
During the first half of the third millennium B.C.E., the earthen enclo
sure seems to have been left to decay. The ditch silted up and the timber posts
eventually rotted away, leaving only the Aubrey Holes. People did come,
though, and carefully placed offerings such as articulated animal bones and
later animal and human cremations, in the ditch and in the Aubrey Holes
themselves. The distribution of these offerings around the site is far from
haphazard and does seem to have been related to the motions of the sun and
moon, perhaps reflecting the cosmological beliefs of the visitors to what may
already have been a sacred ancestral site. This recent discovery is important,
because it demonstrates that in order to understand better how and why
people’s activities related to the celestial bodies in the past we must try to
look beyond the architecture of monuments. Archaeological excavations,
which can reveal evidence of ritualistic activities that have no apparent “ra
tional” explanation in our terms, may give us some important insights.
When stones were first brought to Stonehenge, its axis was changed. It
was now aligned in the northeast upon midsummer sunrise. In other words,
at dawn on the longest day of the year (and for some days before and after)
the sun would have risen squarely between the Heelstone and a companion
that has since disappeared, a beam of light shining along a corridor of stones
and into the interior of the sarsen ring. The axis was also aligned, in the
opposite direction, upon sunset on the shortest day. It is likely that this was
the real focus of the monument, since the ceremonial approach was along an
avenue from the northeast, so that people would have approached facing the
southwest.
Stonehenge 407
Pure Mathematical Physics



Among many other astronomical alignments claimed at Stonehenge,
one of the most intriguing concerns the four station stones. Two of these re
main in situ, just inside the ditch where the timber circle once stood. They
appear to be broadly contemporary with the first appearance of other stones
at the site (though this is unconfirmed archaeologically) and formed a rec
tangle. The lengths of its sides are in the ratio 5:12, a fact that has led some
people to speculate that the builders had knowledge of Pythagorean geome
try, since this ratio gives a diagonal whose length is a whole number (thir
teen) of the same units. The shorter sides of the rectangle are aligned along
the main axis of the monument, on midsummer sunrise and midwinter sun
set, while its longer sides are aligned toward the southeast upon a point close
to the most southerly rising point of the moon. This alignment has led to
claims that the latitude of Stonehenge was carefully chosen to optimize this
arrangement. However, such an argument is flawed on a number of grounds,
most obviously because the earlier monument had already existed on this
spot for several centuries. In any case, the optimal latitude would actually be
well to the south, somewhere in the English Channel.
In comparison, there is little doubt that the solstitial alignment of the
main axis of Stonehenge in its later phases was intentional. Its purpose may
have been as a display of power, showing that this monument, erected with

Pure Mathematical Physics



a huge input of human labor from exotic materials (stone brought from
great distances), was in harmony with nature. Its power would reinforce the
power of those who were seen to be in control of it. Certainly by the middle
of the third millennium B.C.E., Wessex cheftains were powerful and com
manded great long-distance exchange networks. During the ensuing millen
nium, dozens of rich and powerful chieftains were buried along with their
personal treasures in round barrows within sight of Stonehenge, relating in
some way to the power of this great ancestral monument.

Sun, Motions of
On any particular day of the year, the sun occupies a certain position
among the stars. As the celestial sphere turns in the course of its daily (di
urnal) rotation, the sun—like all the stars—appears to trace out a line of
constant “latitude” (for which the technical term is declination) on that ro
tating sphere. Unlike the stars, though, during the course of a year—as the
sun moves gradually along its annual path through the stars, known as the
ecliptic—its declination changes. It is at its farthest north at the June sol
stice, when its declination is about +23.5 degrees, corresponding to the lat
itude of the Tropic of Cancer on the earth. Conversely, it is at its farthest
south at the December solstice, when its declination is about –23.5 degrees,
corresponding to the terrestrial latitude of the Tropic of Capricorn. Over
the years its declination varies continuously between these limits in a
smooth, wave-like manner. In the same way, its rising position moves con
tinually to and fro along the eastern horizon, reaching its limits at the sol
stices; and the same is true of its setting position in the west.
If we have an alignment that we suspect relates to the rising or setting
position of the sun, then we only have to determine the declination of the rel

evant point on the horizon in order to deduce when in the year the sun will
rise or set there. There are always two such times: one when the sun is mov
ing north (in the northern hemisphere spring or southern hemisphere au
tumn) and the other when it is moving south. There will be a slight uncer
tainty of up to a day in each case, mainly because of the leap-year cycle. It is
convenient to express the resulting dates in terms of the modern Gregorian
calendar, but when we interpret our alignments, we must bear in mind that
the people who set them up would have used different calendars. For exam
ple, when medieval churches were constructed, the Julian calendar was in
use. The other complication is that if we delve deeply into the past, we must
make a slight correction (only normally significant on a time scale of mil
lennia) to take into account an effect known as the change in the obliquity
of the ecliptic.

Superior Planets, Motions of
The planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn revolve around the sun on orbits
outside that of Earth. As a result, they travel round the sun more slowly.
Suppose for a moment that the earth simply vanished, leaving a sentient
space monster orbiting the sun in its place, its head upward to the north.
For want of anything better to do, the monster decides to ignore every
thing else in the sky but the sun and Mars, keeping its face toward the sun
and watching Mars gradually progressing around it. At intervals it sees
Mars pass slowly by the sun on the far side (only rarely will it pass directly
behind it): this is known as conjunction. Mars is actually traveling to the
monster’s left, but the monster is traveling faster and in the opposite di
rection, so Mars appears to emerge from behind the sun traveling right. As
Mars continues its journey round the sun, its angle rightward from the sun
steadily increases, slowly at first, but more rapidly as the monster catches
it up. Eventually, it passes round behind the monster, an event known as
opposition, and the sequence is then repeated in reverse on the monster’s
left until Mars eventually approaches the sun again from the left prior to
another conjunction.
The sequence of events for an Earth-based observer reflects those just
described, except that we view them from the surface of a spinning planet.
410 Superior Planets, Motions of
Pure Mathematical Physics



An observer in the northern hemisphere perceives the celestial sphere to be
turning to the right. If Mars is to the right of the sun, it rises earlier, passes
across the sky to the right (west) of the sun, and sets earlier. The directions
are reversed for an observer in the southern hemisphere, whose perceptions
can be modeled by turning the space monster upside-down.
About sixty days after conjunction, then, Mars appears in the eastern
sky before sunrise. This event is known as the heliacal rise—a similar con
cept to the heliacal rise of stars. As it gradually draws away westward from
the sun, it rises earlier and climbs higher in the sky by sunrise. It also in
creases in brightness as it comes closer. The changes become more rapid as
the planet approaches opposition, when it is at its closest and brightest. At
this time, it rises at about sunset and can be seen in the sky all night before
setting at about sunrise. The sequence is now repeated in reverse and in mir
ror image. The planet increases in distance and decreases in brightness, rap
idly at first. It is now visible only in the evenings and gradually approaches
the sun, appearing ever lower in the sky at sunset and setting earlier. Even
tually, it ceases to be visible (this is known as its heliacal setting). This is fol
lowed by another conjunction, and the cycle is repeated.
Returning to the monster for a moment, suppose that it turns its atten
tion to the apparent motion of Mars against the background stars. Suppose
that it now keeps its face toward Mars, watching it pass steadily leftward
(eastward) through the stars as the weeks and months go past. It probably
expects this to be fairly uneventful, but it is in for a surprise. As it ap
proaches opposition, Mars appears to stop and go into reverse. (Actually, it
does not stop, because there is a slight up-and-down motion as well, so that
the path traced out against the stars is a U-shape or loop.) At opposition, it
appears to be going backward (westward), but then, some days later, it stops
a second time and resumes its forward (eastward) progress. This phenome
non is known as retrograde motion. Around the time Earth is overtaking
Mars, it is traveling faster than Mars in roughly the same direction, so Mars
must appear to be moving backward relative to the distant stars. At other
times the two planets are heading in very different directions, so the compo
nent of the earth’s motion in the same direction as Mars is either much
smaller or, for much of the time, in the opposite direction. This means that
Mars will still appear to be moving forward in relation to the distant back
drop of stars.
The period between successive occurrences of the same configuration
(the synodic period) of Mars is 780 days. Invisibility around conjunction
lasts for about 120 days, and retrograde motion around opposition for
about 75 days (with wide variations). Jupiter and Saturn, being much farther
from the sun, progress much more slowly around their orbits, taking several
years to complete even one circuit. This means that their synodic periods are
Superior Planets, Motions of 411
Pure Mathematical Physics



shorter, since these are mainly determined by the rate of the earth’s rotation
around the sun. However, the essential characteristics of their motions are
the same as for Mars. The synodic period of Jupiter is 399 days, disappear
ance around conjunction lasts for about 32, and retrograde motion for
around 120. For Saturn the respective figures are 378, 25, and 140 days.
Retrograde motion was an enigma to pre-Copernican astronomers.
Some of their solutions—such as the Greek epicycles—were extremely ele
gant, but they were ultimately doomed to failure.

Swedish Rock Art
Scattered among the fertile plains of central and southern Sweden, and
found on boulders, outcrops, and flat rock surfaces, are a remarkable quan
tity of prehistoric rock carvings. Mostly attributed to the Bronze Age, and
thus dating to the second and the early part of the first millennia B.C.E., they
include depictions of people, boats, horses, and other animals; wagons and
wheels; the soles of feet, resembling footprints, either barefoot or wearing
sandals; and more abstract elements such as spirals, discs, and cup marks.
Particularly impressive are those sites where we find combinations or accu
mulations of scores, or even hundreds, of rock carvings in a single place.
One small area to the northwest of Stockholm, covering just nine parishes,
was studied recently by British archaeologist John Coles. It alone was found
412 Supernovae
Pure Mathematical Physics



to contain 840 rock art sites containing over 1,500 boats, 350 people and
animals, and 300 soles of feet, together with around 19,000 cup marks.
Some Swedish rock carvings have been interpreted as representations of
ancient constellations and calendars, along with depictions of spectacular
events such as comets, supernovae, and eclipses. These ideas, developed in
great detail during the 1980s and early 1990s by the Swedish astronomer
Göran Henriksson, received a good deal of publicity within Sweden, but also
proved controversial and even contentious. The main criticism leveled at
them was that they were highly subjective. Attributing meaning to rock art,
where there are no “informants” to give us any sort of clue, is notoriously
difficult—many would say impossible—since meaning is highly dependent
upon cultural context. Archaeologists, for this reason, normally tend to limit
themselves to formal analyses of the frequency of certain designs, the loca
tion of rock art sites in the landscape, and similar questions, and to broad
interpretations relating to the cultural setting and to ancient perceptions of
the environment. Attributing specific meaning to particular carvings is un
avoidably speculative and especially dangerous, since there is very wide
scope for fitting complex explanations to complex data.
A particular scene found on a rock panel at Ekenburg near the town of
Norrköping, about 140 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of Stockholm, has
been claimed to depict the sky as seen during a total solar eclipse. The event
in question took place in 1596 B.C.E. For just under three minutes, as the sun
was covered by the moon, people would have seen four bright planets and a
spectacular comet—Comet Encke—close to it in the daytime sky. A set of
concentric rings with a dagger-like object sticking into one side is interpreted
as the eclipsed sun with the tail of Comet Encke adjacent to it. Four nearby
cup marks are interpreted as the planets, and a nearby boat is interpreted as
a constellation comprising parts of Gemini and Taurus.
Attractive as it might seem, there are a number of problems with this in
terpretation. For one thing, some astronomers dispute the calculation of the
time of the eclipse, which depends on certain assumptions about the slowing
of the rate of rotation of the earth. Others point out that the orbit of Encke’s
Comet cannot be calculated prior to C.E. 1100 owing to a close encounter
with Jupiter. In any case, the attribution of this particular astronomical event
is speculative; the choice of which carvings are included while other adjacent
ones are dismissed as not part of the eclipse scene is arbitrary (and influenced
by the interpretation being put forward); and the goodness of fit—in other
words, the positions of (for example) the cup marks compared with the posi
tions of the actual planets in the sky at the time—is not good.
The lesson to be learned here is a methodological one. Enthusiasm in fit
ting an astronomical explanation to an archaeological phenomenon is no sub
stitute for fairly assessing the data. Fitting a complex astronomical explana
Swedish Rock Art 413

tion to complex archaeological data brings the danger that any number of
different, equally complex theories might fit the data equally well. If this is
so, then we cannot claim that the evidence supports our theory in particular.
How, then, do we estimate how many other complex explanations could
have fit equally well? This is not an easy question to answer and not always
of immediate interest to those who see that the data appear to fit their fa
vored theory well enough; but a scientific approach demands that we be pre
pared to consider this question, and that we make a serious attempt to as
sess it fairly.

Symbols
Many archaeologists now believe that it is possible to reconstruct elements
of human cognition from material remains. But in order to do so, it is cru
cial to recognize a means of expression unique to human beings: the use of
symbols. The digit “2,” for example, is a symbol used by Europeans to de
fine a certain numerical concept. But if a hypothetical future archaeologist,
ignorant of all other aspects of twentieth-century European culture, were to
try to interpret the digit “2” carved, say, on an isolated stone, they could
not deduce its meaning from the form of the symbol alone. On the other
hand, they might be able to deduce something from the fact that stones
marked “1 km,” “2 km,” “3 km,” etc. occurred at intervals a fixed distance
apart by the side of a road. The context of the symbols—their association
with one another, as well as their association with the road, which seems
relevant to the way in which they were used, and their spatial distribution
clearly does suggest possible meanings. A complication is that symbols may
mean several different things at once; they may convey different meanings
to different people, some of which may be very different from those in
414 Symbols

tended; and the meanings may well change through time. But just as the
Stars and Stripes would be recognized by virtually everyone in the modern
world as a symbol of the United States, people sharing a common cultural
background are likely to perceive common sets of meanings. It is this set of
shared meanings that gives us some hope of retrieving meanings that reflect
certain worldviews.
Designs found in prehistoric rock art, especially those that do not ob
viously “literally” represent something like an animal, may have had sym
bolic meaning, and it is possible to try to deduce something about that mean
ing from its context. For example, it has been suggested that many circles
and rayed circles in megalithic art all round the Atlantic fringe of Europe
may be sun symbols or representations. Such a design, along with other dec
orations, was carved onto the back corbel of the roof-box above the en
trance of the Neolithic passage tomb at Newgrange, Ireland. The tomb was
apparently designed so that shortly after sunrise on days around winter sol
stice, the sun would shine through the roof-box and down the nineteen-me
ter-long passage, reaching the chambers in the interior of the tomb.
Can we do more than simply recognize possible symbols and possible
meanings? Can we use them to reconstruct elements of other worldviews?
What gives us hope is the human propensity to express and reinforce the na
ture of the cosmos, as a given group of people perceives it, in many different
ways in order to keep their own lives and activities in harmony with the
world. Verbal or visual metaphors might be expressed in myth, exhibited in
activities that we might interpret as either ritualistic or mundane (or both),
or displayed in architecture. For example, hogans, traditional round or oc
tagonal buildings built by Navajo families in the southwestern United States,
reflect the harmony of the cosmos in various ways. Their single door faces
the rising sun, and the space within is conceptually divided into four quar
ters used in different ways, reflecting the four directions of the cosmos and
their associated properties and qualities. Movement within the hogan is al
ways clockwise, reflecting the motion of the sun around the sky.
Where we have only the material record to go by, associations between
symbols, if we can fathom their meaning, may give us insights into corre
spondences that form part of a worldview. We might notice, for example, the
consistent orientation of hogans toward the solar rising arc in the east; if in
addition we consistently found material evidence of different activities in the
four quarters of the hogan, we might correctly deduce the quadripartite
structure of the Navajo cosmos.

Taulas
Taulas are a distinctive type of later prehistoric monument found exclu
sively on the Mediterranean island of Menorca. Attributed to the talayotic
culture—so called because it is characterized by a type of dry-stone tower
known as a talayot—they date broadly to the late second and early first
millennia B.C.E. Taulas consist of two large rectangular blocks of stone, one
standing upright and the other placed across the top, balanced centrally, so
as to form a shape resembling the letter “T.” These were placed within
stone-walled precincts. One side of the “T” was worked flat and smooth.
This side faced the visitors as they came in through the single entrance, as
well as the wider landscape beyond. Each major village seems to have had
its taula, and some twenty-five examples are known, in various states of
preservation, scattered about the small island.
The orientations of taulas (and the precinct entrances) are not random;
they face generally southwards, within a range from southeast to south
southwest. In every case there is an uninterrupted view out to a distant hori
zon, suggesting that it was important to have a clear view of the sky in that
direction. Yet this direction does not correspond to that of the rising or set
ting position of the sun, moon, or planets, leaving only the possibility that
the taulas were aligned on certain stars. It is possible that the asterism of in
terest was the Southern Cross and Pointers, a very conspicuous group of
bright stars appearing low in the southern sky at this latitude in the second
millennium B.C.E. This might also explain the puzzling fact that no taulas are
found on neighboring Mallorca, despite the fact that talayots are equally
abundant there. Mallorca, unlike Menorca, is mountainous and the land
scape around the principal Mallorcan villages (concentrated in the fertile
northern part of the island) would not have permitted a clear view of the
southern sky. In other words, people living on Mallorca had no possibility
of seeing the Southern Cross and so did not build taulas. However, if the
Menorcan taulas were indeed linked inextricably with the Southern Cross
and Pointers, then the passage of time would have presented the ancient
417
T

Menorcans with a problem. Owing to precession, these stars dropped lower
and lower in the southern skies as the centuries progressed, until by the on
set of the first millennium B.C.E. they were hardly visible at all.
Taulas certainly had sacred associations, as is clear from broken stat
ues and sacrificed animal bones strewn about the precincts. In one case
these included a statue of the Egyptian god of medicine, Imhotep, complete
with a hieroglyphic inscription; at another, excavations uncovered a hoof
from a bronze statue, evidently of a horse (or centaur), the remainder pre
sumably having been plundered. Since there is no other evidence of local
horse gods, this again suggests links with the eastern Mediterranean. In an
cient Egypt, it was common to associate gods and goddesses with stars and
constellations, and in Greek mythology the god of medicine, Asclepius
(counterpart to the Egyptian Imhotep), was tutored by a centaur—Chiron.
Tentatively weaving together these threads, the British historian of astron
omy Michael Hoskin suggested that the taula sanctuaries may have been
places of healing and were oriented upon the constellation of the centaur
Centaurus. The Southern Cross and Pointers are at the feet of the centaur
in the sky, the Pointers (α and β Centauri) forming the two brightest stars
of the modern constellation.

Temple Alignments in Ancient Greece
The first systematic study of temple orientations in ancient Greece was car
ried out by Heinrich Nissen in the nineteenth century. William Dinsmoor,
carrying out another study in the 1930s, concluded that almost three quar
ters (73 percent) of them were oriented eastward within the range of sun
rise. Some were oriented on sunrise on the feast day of the deity to whom
the temple was dedicated. One example is the Parthenon itself, dedicated to
Athena. It is not only aligned upon the sunrise on the feast day of Athena
but also upon a prominent hill—Mount Hymettos. How widespread or
long-lasting this practice was is a hard question to answer. The evidence is
complicated by the fact that many temples were reconstructed on a differ
ent orientation or their dedication was changed. Historical sources also
make it clear that sunrise was not always the principal concern. The Greek
writer Vitruvius, in his work De Architectura, indicates that there was
sometimes a preference for facing nearby cities or directions of approach
along rivers or roads.
It has been suggested that the predominantly easterly orientation of
Greek temples may reflect broader orientation practices extending back as
far as the Bronze Age. The Minoan culture survived on the island of Crete
until the middle of the second millennium B.C.E., after which the Mycenaeans
from the Greek mainland took control. Elements of both Mycenaean and
Minoan orientation practices may have come to influence Archaic and, in
due course, Classical Greek temples, but the practice of easterly orientation
seems to derive from the Minoans. Studies of the orientations of over three
Temple Alignments in Ancient Greece 419
Pure Mathematical Physics



hundred Bronze Age passage tombs on Crete, dating back to the mid-third
millennium B.C.E., show a very strong easterly trend, with over 80 percent of
them lying within the solar arc. An even higher proportion (about 87 per
cent) are within the slightly wider lunar arc. Over half the data are derived
from a single cemetery, Armenoi in western Crete. Each of the more than
two hundred tombs there is oriented within the range of moonrise; and it is
surely not coincidental that three kilometers (two miles) to the east is Mount
Vrysinas, upon whose summit was a peak sanctuary apparently, although
not certainly, dedicated to a moon goddess.
The development of mathematical astronomy in ancient Greece from
around 400 B.C.E. onward seems to have derived in large part from ancient
Babylonia. However, in constructing large stone temples as far back as the
seventh century B.C.E., the ancient Greeks acquired both inspiration and
technological expertise from ancient Egypt. This linkage opens up the possi
bility that some of the more symbolic aspects of Greek temple construction,
such as architectural alignments upon celestial objects, also derived from an

cient Egypt, where there is cultural continuity stretching back into the third
millennium B.C.E. Studying the common aspects of astronomical symbolism
incorporated in Greek and Egyptian temples may throw more light on this
possibility in the future.

Teotihuacan Street Grid
Teotihuacan was the first pre-industrial city in the New World. Rising to
prominence in about 100 B.C.E., it subsequently reached massive propor
tions, supporting at its height (between about C.E. 350 and 650) a popula
tion of around 200,000 and covering some twenty square kilometers (eight
square miles). This entire area was partitioned by a regular street grid into
about two thousand rectangular “apartment compounds,” some containing
groups of occupational specialists and others housing different social
classes or ethnic groups. Most remarkable of all is the ceremonial center, its
wide main street (the so-called Street of the Dead) lined with splendid court
yards, palaces, and temples. It also contained the two great pyramids that
have subsequently become known as the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyra
mid of the Moon.
Like many other Mesoamerican cities, the street grid is precise and ori
ented slightly askew from the cardinal directions. There are two different
parts to the city, one around the Pyramid of the Sun, which deviates from the
cardinal directions by about 15.5 degrees clockwise, and another farther to
the south that deviates by about 16.5 degrees. Curiously, quite a large area
in between seems to follow one north-south convention but the other an
east-west one, resulting in street intersections, and even individual buildings,
that have corners of around eighty-nine degrees and ninety-one degrees.
In all likelihood, one or two different sightings fixed the original align
ments in each direction and were then propagated as more streets were con
structed. But what was being sighted upon? One possibility is that the north
south direction reflects the orientation of the Pyramid of the Sun directly upon
the hill Cerro Gordo to the north. Indeed, when viewed from the south, the
Teotihuacan Street Grid 421

pyramid does seem to “reference” the hill behind by mimicking its shape. Oth
ers have argued that the focus of interest was topographic features on the east
ern horizon. But it may be misleading to consider the Teotihuacan street grid
in isolation. Systematic studies of the orientations of the street grids of
Mesoamerican cities show that deviations of between fifteen degrees and eigh
teen degrees clockwise from north-south-east-west are surprisingly common;
indeed, they form a distinctive orientation group. This characteristic strongly
implies that they were fixed using a common astronomical determinant.
Yet no overwhelmingly convincing possibilities emerge, especially
among celestial objects rising to the east. A possible explanation of the east
west direction is that it aligned in the west with the horizon setting position
of the Pleiades, but if so it is curious that the orientations of structures span
ning many centuries remained on the same orientation, while the setting di
rection shifted owing to precession. Another possibility is that the direction
corresponds to sunset on April 30 and August 13, dates significant because
the longer interval between them is exactly 260 days, or the length of the sa
cred cycle that was a defining feature of all Mesoamerican calendars.

Theodolite Surveys
The theodolite, sometimes referred to in the United States as a surveyor’s
transit, is the surveying instrument that is most useful in determining the as
tronomical potential of structural alignments at archaeological sites such as
prehistoric monuments. Although the designs of theodolites vary consider
ably, as they have throughout the century or so that they have been manu
factured, their fundamental components remain invariable. These consist of
a telescope that can be pointed in any direction, together with two gradu
ated circles, mounted horizontally and vertically, which enable that direc
tion to be defined quantitatively. In order to determine the astronomical po

tential of (say) a point on the horizon as viewed from a given observing po
sition—in other words, to determine the apparent positions of the distant
celestial bodies in relation to that closer feature—the direction of that point
from the observer is precisely what we need.
Any direction can be defined in terms of two angles: a horizontal angle
measured around from some suitable zero point, and a vertical angle meas
ured up or down from level. Determining the second of these is straightfor
ward. When a theodolite is first set up on its tripod, a leveling process in
volving various bubbles ensures that the vertical circle is properly zeroed and
will give us the required angle, which is known as the altitude. The situation
regarding the horizontal angle is more complicated. The leveling process en
sures that the horizontal circle is truly horizontal, but the zero point on this
scale will be pointing in an arbitrary direction. What we actually want is the
angle measured clockwise around from true north, which is known as the az
imuth. However, generally we can’t know the direction of true north (at
least, to the required accuracy) in advance. What is normally done in prac
tice is to measure what is called the horizontal plate bearing: the clockwise
angle around from the arbitrary zero point. We must make the adjustment
from plate bearings to azimuths in retrospect. This will involve making the
same correction to each reading, by adding the actual azimuth of the zero
point, sometimes known as plate bearing zero or PBZ.
But how do we determine PBZ once we have set up the theodolite?
One way is to take a series of timed observations of the sun (it is very im
portant not to look through the telescope when it is pointing at the sun, but
the sun’s image can be projected on to a piece of paper). The plate bearing
of each reading can then be compared with the sun’s actual azimuth as de
termined using published or on-line ephemerides. Each direction we meas
ure (e.g., of a point on the horizon) will eventually be defined in terms of
azimuth and altitude, from which we can calculate the declination and
hence know what rises and sets there, or would have risen and set there at
any given era in the past.
A modern theodolite will typically measure the azimuth and altitude
of a distant object to a precision of twenty arc seconds or better. For work
that does not warrant anything like this sort of accuracy, it may be possible
to obtain the necessary information on site using a magnetic compass and
a clinometer, or by using large-scale topographic maps or digital topo
graphic data.
In addition to determining the directions of horizon points, etc., it is im
portant to fix the position of the theodolite in space, for example, in relation
to a monument. This can be done using a tape, but modern surveying in
struments are very useful for this. Theodolites incorporating an electronic
distance measurement device (EDM) provide a convenient way of determin

ing the distance between the instrument and a reflector placed within a range
of distances appropriate for most site surveys. Total Stations combine this
technology with a computer chip that can convert direction-and-distance de
terminations of measured points into positions in space expressed in a cho
sen coordinate system. They can also store measurements for downloading
directly to a computer, which not only allows the surveyor to dispense with
the task of recording measurements manually on site, but also allows for a
quick display of the results, using appropriate software.

Thom, Alexander (1894–1985)
Alexander Thom is widely acknowledged as one of the founding fathers of
modern archaeoastronomy. An engineer by profession, he was also a keen
amateur astronomer, and he was aware from an early age of the writings of
Sir Norman Lockyer on the possible astronomical significance of ancient
stone monuments in his native Scotland and elsewhere in the British Isles.
His own active interest in the megalithic monuments of Britain, and partic
ularly in his native Scotland, is said to have been aroused in 1933 by the
sight, one evening as he was sailing in the Outer Hebrides looking for an
anchorage, of one of the stone circles at Callanish silhouetted against the
rising moon. Twenty years and many dozens of site surveys later, he began
to publish research papers in which he proposed three ideas that, during the
1960s and 1970s, would shake the archaeological world.
The first of Thom’s ideas was that stone circles were laid out using a
precisely defined unit of measurement, which he called the “megalithic
yard.” The second, and related, idea was that each circle was laid out ac
cording to one of a small number of particular geometrical designs using
techniques based upon Pythagorean triangles. The third idea was that a va
riety of “megalithic sites” incorporated alignments of remarkable precision
upon the rising and setting positions of various celestial bodies. Taken to
gether, these showed that “megalithic man,” to use Thom’s own term, was a
competent engineer with considerable technical knowledge, whose accom
plishments included sophisticated numeration, geometry, and astronomy
three things that would come to be known together as “megalithic science.”
Thom’s ideas first appeared in book form in 1967, in a slim but highly tech
Thom, Alexander 425
Pure Mathematical Physics



nical volume called simply Megalithic Sites in Britain, which contained the
detailed analysis of survey results from over 250 standing stone monuments.
Thom’s second book, Megalithic Lunar Observatories, published in
1971, set the archaeological world into a turmoil that did not calm down
fully until more than a decade later. His claim was that many standing stone
monuments were deliberately aligned upon “notches” and other features in
distant mountainous horizons, and that these horizon points marked ex
treme rising and setting points of the moon with incredible precision. To at
tain that level of precision, prehistoric astronomers would have had to carry
out meticulous programs of observation, following them consistently for
years if not decades (in other words, over generations). The problem was
that these conclusions were completely unpalatable to most prehistorians at
the time. Their social models, informed by a variety of archaeological evi
dence, simply did not fit with such ideas. Yet Thom’s results could not eas
ily be refuted: they were based on careful fieldwork and supported by rigor
ous statistical analysis.
When detailed reappraisals of Thom’s ideas on “megalithic astron
omy” were eventually completed in the 1980s, it emerged that the sup
posed astronomical sightlines of very high precision could all be explained
away as chance occurrences. On the other hand, certain groups of monu
ments, such as the recumbent stone circles of eastern Scotland and the
short stone rows of western Scotland and southwest Ireland, definitely did
contain consistent lunar alignments, though at a much lower degree of pre
cision, that could not be ignored. Similarly, although the idea of a precise
“megalithic yardstick” being used all over Britain is not sustainable as
Thom conceived of it, the idea that there was a widespread practice of lay
ing out stone circles and other monuments using broadly consistent meas
urements based upon the human body (such as arm lengths or paces) re
mains a distinct possibility.
In hindsight, even though Thom’s theories have been largely super
seded, his work led archaeologists to start thinking about issues and facing
problems that they had largely avoided. In particular, Thom’s work moti
vated others to investigate intentional astronomical alignments at prehistoric
monuments and eventually resulted in this area of study becoming archaeo
logically informative and respectable. Finally, Thom pioneered ways of car
rying out site surveys using a theodolite, analyzing the data, and presenting
the results that are now a fundamental part of field methodology within ar
chaeoastronomy.

Thornborough
Situated on a gravel plateau near Thornborough in Yorkshire, northern
England, is a remarkable monument consisting of not just one, but an align
ment of three large, round Neolithic earthwork enclosures with high outer
banks, known as henge monuments. The three henges are almost identical
in size and form, each being some two hundred meters across with two en
trances on opposite sides, and they are more or less equally spaced some
five hundred meters apart, forming an alignment over 1.5 kilometers (1
mile) long. The entrances are oriented along the alignment. Surrounding the
henges are a number of other prehistoric features, including two large pits,
which appear to have held sizeable wooden posts, aligned upon a double
ring-ditch that represents the remains of a ploughed-out barrow.
What makes this monument fascinating from an astronomical point of
view is the possibility that it was a pilgrimage center whose astronomical as
sociations tell us not only the time of year when the major ceremonies took
place here, but also reveal how people from far afield may have known when
to set out in order to arrive in time for those ceremonies.
A number of factors support the pilgrimage center idea. First, the
henges were constructed along what is known from other archaeological ev
idence to have been an important routeway. Second, the formal design of the
monuments was evidently important, and it developed over time. The henges
are embellishments of earlier, smaller earthwork enclosures, and the central
one was built over the central part of an earlier linear earthwork known as
a cursus monument, itself over two kilometers (1.5 miles) long. Third, the
high outer banks would have obscured the view of the distant skyline (some
thing that is still evident from what remains of the banks today), and this
suggests that the henge interiors were exclusive places, cut off from the out
side world. Fourth, archaeological field-walking has revealed an almost
complete absence of surface scatters of flints from the area immediately
around the henges, strongly implying that this was not a place where people
routinely lived and worked. Finally, and most extraordinarily, about one
kilometer (half a mile) to the east is a large concentration of surface flint, but
a good deal of it is non-local and from scattered sources, and lightly worked.
It appears that people came here from some distance and brought the stone
Thornborough 427
Pure Mathematical Physics



with them, which implies in turn that this may have been a visitors’ en
campment, rather than a permanent settlement.
There are a number of locations at the site where prominent features
of the monument seem to frame parts of the horizon. Intriguingly, several
of these align upon the same asterism, namely the three stars of Orion’s belt.
It is worryingly easy to identify potential astronomical, and particularly
stellar, alignments at almost any site, whether or not they were intentional.
But this consistency argues in favor of the Thornborough alignments being
deliberate. Viewing along the cursus to the west, the three stars would have
been framed by the western terminal as they set. Viewing along the line of
the two large timber posts, toward the barrow, an observer would have seen
them rising in the alignment. And by the time the bright star Sirius rose, in
roughly the same alignment, Orion’s belt would have moved up and to the
right, to be in line with the henge alignment itself and visible from the henge
interiors over their southern entrances. A final, more speculative suggestion
is that the three henges themselves formed a representation on the ground
of Orion’s belt. Because of precession, the rising and setting positions of any
star or group of stars varies significantly over a time scale of centuries.
Though it is highly inadvisable to try to date sites astronomically by fitting
stars to alignments, precession serves at Thornborough to reinforce the
Orion’s belt alignments, in that the “best fit” dates are wholly compatible
with the archaeological estimates of the dates of different features at the
monument.
If Thornborough really was a pilgrimage center, then two questions
arise. Were there particular times when people congregated here, perhaps for
large ceremonies? And if so, and if people had to come from some distance,
how did they know when to leave in order to arrive on time?
The astronomical associations of the site may provide answers to both
questions. The annual first appearance of Orion’s belt in the eastern sky be
fore dawn—its heliacal rise—would have occurred in the late summer. The
annual reappearance of Sirius—the brightest star in the sky—would have oc
curred two or three weeks later. Once Orion’s belt had appeared in the
predawn sky, it could have provided the necessary reminder for surrounding
peoples that a ceremony was imminent. The actual ceremony could then
have taken place somewhat later, at the time of the dawn reappearance of
Sirius, with Orion’s belt now prominently visible above the southern en
trance of each henge just before dawn. Such a ceremony would have taken
place in early autumn, when the harvests were in and the seasonal workload
had eased up for a while.
This interpretation of the Thornborough henges was made possible us
ing a combination of sky visualization software and virtual reality software.
It shows the potential of this type of approach in contrast to the more tra

Tri-Radial Cairns
Tri-radial cairns are a distinctive type of Bronze Age monument found on
the moorlands of northern England, comprising three radial “arms” of
stones, typically no more than two meters (six feet) long and half a meter
(two feet) high, extending out from a common center. Modest in size and
easily mistaken for sheep shelters or other more modern constructions, their
status as prehistoric monuments was only recognized in the 1990s. Over
twenty examples are now known, with a major concentration of eight at
Lordenshaws in Northumberland.
The state of preservation of the known tri-radial cairns varies. It is of
ten difficult to determine with any great precision the original direction of
each of the arms, even assuming that they were straight in the first place.
Nonetheless, there is a clear general consistency in the orientations, and this
invites an astronomical explanation. In each case one of the arms points ap
proximately due north, always to within about thirty degrees and in the ma
jority of cases to within ten degrees. The remaining two arms point south
eastward and southwestward respectively, with a similar scatter in the
“best-fit” directions.
A group from the Border Archaeological Society who discovered the
cairns has suggested that they might have been constructed by making ob
servations of the sun around the time of the summer solstice. The technique
would have been to erect a vertical post and to build the three arms in the
direction of the shadow at sunrise, noon (when the shadow is shortest), and
Tri-Radial Cairns 429
Pure Mathematical Physics



sunset. This might not have been done to any great precision, so we might
expect a considerable scatter in the resulting orientations even at the time of
construction. (It would also require clear skies, but given the tiny change in
the sun’s motions on days near the solstice, there would be many opportu
nities to take advantage of suitable weather conditions.) The result would be
radial orientations concentrated around azimuths of 0 degrees, 135 degrees,
and 225 degrees respectively.
But there is a simpler explanation that fits the data just as well—in fact,
better. Suppose that one arm was oriented to the north, either by using the
sun’s shadow at noon (on any day of the year), or by reference to the diur
nal motions of the stars at night, the other two arms being simply placed at
regular intervals round the cairn. This would result in radial orientations
concentrated around azimuths of 0 degrees, 120 degrees, and 240 degrees.
Of course this begs the question of why the chosen number of arms was
three, but the explanation could well have nothing to do with astronomy.
There is no conclusive evidence to support either of these explanations,
but the fact that they are both viable shows the dangers of fitting particular
astronomical orientations too readily, and not considering equally plausible
alternatives. It also demonstrates the principle known as Occam’s razor,
which advises us that there is no need to resort to a complex hypothesis to
explain some data if a simpler one will explain the data just as well. Here,
the “regular spacing” explanation is arguably the simpler one and more con
sistent with the data.

Venus in Mesoamerica
The planet Venus is the third brightest regularly visible object in the skies,
behind the sun and moon. Its cycle of morning and evening appearances
was well known to the ancient Mesoamericans, partly because it seemed to
fit naturally with other astronomical cycles, in that five Venus cycles ex
actly equaled eight year-cycles of 365 days. In fact, five Venus cycles do not
quite equal eight years, and we would view the near-coincidence of these
two periods merely as an accident of nature. The ancient Mesoamericans,
on the other hand, saw it as a significant property of the cosmos and this
had two far-reaching consequences. The first was that they, and particu
larly the Maya, could integrate cycles of Venus with ease into the other in
termeshing cycles of their calendar. Direct evidence of the care with which
the synodic cycles of Venus were observed by the Maya comes from the
Dresden Codex, where the motions of the planet are carefully tabulated
and correlated with other astronomical cycles. The heliacal rising of Venus
was probably the most significant event to the Maya, and certainly a time
of dread for the Aztecs.
The second consequence was that Venus appeared to have a relation
ship with the seasons, even though a particular seasonal configuration of
Venus would only recur after eight years, and so Venus became strongly as
sociated with rain, fertility, and maize. It also appears to have become
strongly associated with warfare and ritual sacrifice, with military cam
paigns carefully timed according to Venus-related prognostications. The
two are related, since one of the main purposes of human sacrifice was to
petition the gods for rain. There was also a clear association between Venus
and the sacred ballgame played throughout Mesoamerica; this is evident
from the common occurrence of Venus symbols both in depictions of the

Wedge Tombs
Wedge tombs are a distinctive type of megalithic passage tomb found all
over Ireland, but mainly in the west. Over five hundred examples are
known, and while they vary widely in size, they do have a defining charac
teristic: a trapezoidal central chamber, its sides formed by two lines of
large, upright stones (orthostats), which is wider and higher toward the en
trance end, forming a wedge shape. The bulk of wedge tomb construction
took place in the second half of the third millennium B.C.E., placing them
chronologically toward the end of a rich tradition of Neolithic tomb con
struction in Ireland.
The other property that confirms the wedge tombs as a useful category
of monuments is the strong consistency in their orientations. Nearly all
known examples face the western arc of the horizon, with the majority fac
ing southwest. It is unusual to have such a clear preference for westerly ori
entation among a group of Neolithic tombs, let alone such a substantial one.
The only other example in Britain or Ireland is the few dozen Clava cairns
of northeast Scotland. The fact that the Clava cairns also seem to represent
a late development suggests that a strong predilection for westerly/south
westerly orientations only developed toward the end of the Neolithic. A sim
ilar preference is evident in the orientations of the axial stone circles of
southwest Ireland, a region where there is a major concentration of wedge
tombs, as well as among the recumbent stone circles of northeast Scotland,
which occupy an area close to that where the Clava cairns are found.
What is the astronomical significance of the wedge tombs? Viewed in
the context of groups of later prehistoric temples and tombs found all over
western Europe, their pattern of orientation fits the “sun descending or set
ting” model. In other words, each tomb was oriented upon a position where
the sun was seen either to set, or to be descending in the sky, on a signifi
cant day—perhaps the day on which construction was begun. However,
there is one well-studied example that provides tantalizing evidence of more
particular concerns. This is the tomb of Altar, situated on the south coast of
435
W
Pure Mathematical Physics



the Mizen peninsula at the very extreme of southwest Ireland, close to the
village of An Tuar Mór (Toormore).
The Altar tomb commands a clear view down toward the tip of the
Mizen peninsula, and is directly oriented upon the conspicuous Mizen Peak,
which forms a distinctive pyramid shape on the horizon some twelve kilo
meters (eight miles) away. Added to this, the tomb’s orientation may have
had a calendrical significance. As was first pointed out by Boyle Somerville,
who surveyed the monument in 1931, it is oriented upon the position of sun
set within a couple of days of February 4 and November 5. These are two of
the mid-quarter days, which along with the solstices, equinoxes, and the
other two mid-quarter days divide the year into eight equal parts. This in
terested Somerville because the November date corresponded to the festival
of Samhain in the Celtic calendar.
The problems with this interpretation apply to all supposed equinoctial
and mid-quarter-day alignments, many of which were highlighted in re
assessments of the “megalithic” calendar proposed in Britain by Alexander
Thom. On the other hand, an intriguing aspect of Altar is the existence of
archaeological evidence that suggests a sequence of ritual activity stretching
from around 2000 B.C.E. up to at least the first century C.E. This evidence
might support the argument of continuity of tradition into “Celtic” times.
However, Altar does not seem to be typical even of the wedge tombs in
its immediate vicinity, at least to judge from an analysis of nine other wedge
tombs in the Mizen peninsula. Even the impressive topographic alignment
appears to be a “one-off.” This means that, as with other single instances
among groups such as the solstitially aligned axial stone circle at Drombeg,
one must continue to wonder whether the alignments could have arisen for
tuitously rather than intentionally.

Years B.C.E. and Years before 0
There is great potential for confusion between the ways that archaeologists
and astronomers reckon dates before the birth of Christ. For the archaeol
ogist, the year before C.E. 1 is 1 B.C.E. In other words, there was no “year
0.” The convention amongst astronomers, on the other hand, is to count
years backward on a linear scale, so that the year before the year 1 was the
year 0, the year before that was –1, and so on. This means, for example,
that the archaeologist’s year 331 B.C.E. is the astronomer’s year –330.
This issue becomes crucially important, for example, at the Iron Age
causeway site of Fiskerton in England, where it has been proposed that
episodes of reconstruction may have been associated with lunar eclipses. In
order to test this idea, archaeologically determined tree-ring dates need to be
compared with astronomically determined eclipse dates.

Yekuana Roundhouses
The Yekuana live amid the rainforests of southern Venezuela, along the
banks of the river Orinoco and its tributaries. Their traditional dwellings are
communal roundhouses large enough to house several families. They have
walls of wattle and daub and a huge conical roof, thatched over, through
which the central pole protrudes, pointing directly upwards at the heavens.
According to Yekuana myth, the design of the roundhouse was handed
down by the Sun (Wanadi) himself, the creator of the world, and reflects the
properties of the cosmos in a variety of ways. A circular inner room repre
sents the sea (this is used as sleeping space for bachelor men as well as a
place for rituals and ceremonials presided over by the village shaman), and
439
Y

the outer ring, divided radially into compartments where different families
live, represents the land. The roof is seen as a reflection of the celestial dome:
it is supported by upright posts known as “pillars of the stars,” and the hor
izontal crossbeam supporting it, always placed in a north-south orientation,
has the name of the Milky Way. The center post reaches down into the un
derworld and up, beyond the roof, to the heavens. Placed centrally within
the roof space, about three meters (ten feet) above the floor, is a set of tie
beams forming a rectangular structure. This has a practical purpose in help
ing to support the crossbeam and providing a frame from which the men
sleeping in the central space can hang their hammocks. However, its precise
rectangular shape also has a cosmological significance: the directions of the
four corners from the center pole are the directions of sunrise and sunset at
the solstices and, together with the pole itself, represent the four corners and
center of the world.
A trapezoidal opening in the western or southwestern side of the roof
doubles as a vent for smoke and as a source of light. It is closed in the wet
season (when the roundhouse fills unpleasantly with smoke), but opened up
in the dry season; at this time its orientation, well away from the southerly
or southeasterly direction of the prevailing wind, ensures that only rarely
will it catch the wind thus blocking the escaping smoke. However, this does
not explain why a northerly or northeasterly orientation could not equally
well be chosen in many cases. The reason for this may be that the opening
originally had a third purpose, as an observation window. The beam of the
afternoon sun crosses the interior of the house, its movement marking out
the time of day and the time of year. The interior of the house is richly dec
orated with paintings depicting scenes and figures important in Yekuana
myth, some of which are lit up by the beam of sunlight at certain times.
There are structural alignments, too: thus on the winter solstice, the sun
beam reaches the northeastern corner of the internal rectangle.
The Yekuana roundhouse was truly a model of the cosmos. It may also,
in some senses, have functioned as an observatory, in the sense that obser
vations of sunlight through the roof opening could have been used as a clock
or calendar. It may even have been used to observe the night sky. There is no
ethnographic evidence to support this claim directly, although the same is
known to have been the case among some indigenous North America
groups, such as the Pawnee.
The Yekuana creation myth, and a very specific set of principles of con
struction conceived within the framework of that myth, ensure that the tra
ditional roundhouse not only incorporates sound structural principles and
pragmatics for living, but also reflects and reinforces the prevailing world
view. It is interesting to speculate on how much of the cosmological sym
bolism incorporated just in the overall structure of the roundhouse could
440 Yekuana Roundhouses

have been guessed at by an archaeologist of the future if all historical records
had been lost. The answer is probably very little, a sobering thought when
we struggle to interpret, for example, roundhouses surviving in Europe from
the Iron Age.

Zenith Passage of the Sun
If you are within the tropics—but only if you are within the tropics—you
will have the opportunity to see the sun pass directly overhead. The high
est point in the sky is known as the zenith, so this event is known techni
cally as solar zenith passage. Solar zenith passage will happen at local noon
on two separate days in the year, but what those days are will depend upon
your latitude on the earth. Right on the Tropics themselves, it happens on
just one day in the year: the June solstice at the Tropic of Cancer in the
northern hemisphere, and the December solstice at the Tropic of Capricorn
in the south. A little south of the Tropic of Cancer, the dates of solar zenith
passage will be a little before and after the June solstice: the farther south
you are, the further apart these dates will be. At the equator, the dates oc
cur exactly six months apart, at the two equinoxes. Moving farther south
again, the two dates gradually converge on the December solstice.
One way of visualizing this is to imagine a tightly coiled spring
wrapped around the earth with its open ends on the two Tropics, and its
183 coils not quite following lines of latitude. There is always some point
on the earth where the sun is currently overhead, and from the June solstice
to the December solstice this point will trace slowly along the coils of the
spring, going around once every twenty-four hours and moving inexorably
southwards along the coils, until the December solstice is reached and the
sun starts to move back northwards again.
Times when the sun passes close to the zenith stand out, because peo
ple and other upright objects cease to have shadows. Such times have sacred
and practical significance in a variety of cultures within the tropics. A num
ber of legends identify it as a time when the way is open into the upper
world. In some Guatemalan villages, for example, the two dates of zenith
passage coincide with springtime and August rains, and are marked by rit
ual observances that still live on in Christian tradition in the form of pa
rades. In ancient Hawai‘i, the moment of solar zenith passage was a time
with great mana, or sacred power. It was a time when a person’s shadow
443
Z
Pure Mathematical Physics



was no longer visible and was thought to have retreated directly into the
brain through the top of the head; a person’s spirit could exit at this time.
The coming of the days when the sun will pass through the zenith may
be recognized in various ways, for example, by observing the rising or set
ting position of the sun on the horizon, or by watching for the heliacal rise
or set of certain stars or asterisms. Sometimes we have evidence of devices
that marked the actual moment of solar zenith passage, often in a dramatic
way. Zenith tubes, which allowed the light of the sun to pass down into a
dark place only at the time of zenith passage, are known at the Mesoameri
can cities of Monte Alban and Xochicalco.
The zenith sun may hold one of the keys to the mystery of why Necker
Island, a remote and uninhabitable rock lying well beyond the larger islands
of the Hawaiian chain, is covered in temple platforms. It may have been an
especially sacred place because it lay right on the Tropic of Cancer, at the
very edge of the region where the sun reaches the zenith.

Zenith Stars in Polynesia
The paths of the stars across the sky depend upon the observer’s latitude.
At any given latitude, only certain stars will pass directly overhead. Con
versely, any given star will only be seen to pass overhead from one particu
lar latitude on earth. For this to happen, the observer’s latitude has to be
equal to the “latitude” of the star on the celestial sphere—in other words,
its declination.
The New Zealander David Lewis, in his efforts to trace surviving frag
ments of traditional methods of navigation in the Pacific, encountered a
number of references to “the star on top,” “the overhead star,” “the star that
points down upon an island,” and the like. Taken together, these suggest the
former existence of a Polynesian tradition in which different islands were
seen to have distinctive “marker” stars. Most intriguingly, a Tahitian chant
recorded in 1818 listed eight “pillars that hold up the heavens.” The decli
nations of several of these stars, Lewis found, corresponded in C.E. 1000

itudes of various southern Polynesian islands, from the Line Islands in the
north down to New Zealand in the south. The implication is that the over
head stars, marker stars, and pillar stars could have been zenith stars for par
ticular islands.
The extent to which zenith stars were used by Pacific navigators is an
other question. Zenith stars cannot be used to plot a course, merely to de
termine the current latitude. Even to do the latter at all successfully, one has
to identify the upward direction with reasonable accuracy, which is of course
difficult on a swaying canoe. On the other hand, Lewis himself did achieve
this reasonably satisfactorily by siting up the mast, and there are various
documented references to zenith stars being used for navigation, particularly
in Micronesia. However, even with zenith star observations as a back-up,
Oceanic navigators would still have needed to use other methods (such as a
combination of star compasses and dead reckoning) in order to locate dis
tant islands.

Zenith Tubes
Most people who lived in the tropics in the past would have been broadly
aware of the two times of year when the sun passed more or less directly
overhead at noon and they ceased to have shadows. If they wished to de
termine the precise dates when zenith passage occurred, though, they would
have needed to construct an instrument. A vertical, straight-sided post
would have sufficed—a gnomon whose shadow would have dwindled to
nothing at the appropriate time. So runs a plausible argument; but to rea
son in this way is to approach the issue from a modern Western perspective.
If people had wished instead to harness the sacred power of such a moment,
for whatever ideological or political ends, they would surely have created a
hierophany. One way to achieve this would have been to construct a long
vertical tube opening into a dark chamber below. This would create a
Zenith Tubes 445

breathtaking effect when the light of the zenith sun suddenly passed directly
down the tube and, for a few precious moments, brought a sudden trans
formation to the normally dark space.
Two of the most discussed examples of possible zenith tubes are found
in Mesoamerica. One is at the Early Classic site of Monte Alban, a little un
der four hundred kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Mexico City, close to
the modern city of Oaxaca. Monte Alban was the capital city of the Zapotec
state, which formed in the valley of Oaxaca around 500 B.C.E. and grew
steadily in power and influence until it reached its apex around C.E.
300–600. The massive main plaza, built on a flattened hilltop, was its cere
monial heart. Visitors cannot fail to be impressed by the sheer size of this
plaza, which measures more than three hundred meters by two hundred me
ters (1,000 feet by 650 feet). Nor can they fail to notice something extremely
strange about Building J, situated on the central axis towards one end: it is
wildly skewed with respect to all the other buildings. Rather than being ori
ented along the plaza like all the others, it is aligned directly upon Building
P, one of several stepped buildings along the eastern side. And halfway up
the steep steps of Building P is a curious feature. Here, reached through a
narrow entrance, is a small room built directly under the steps, and at the
back of it is a bench. Above the bench is a narrow vertical tube about 1.5
meters (five feet) high leading up to an opening higher up the staircase. Some
have suggested that this tube could be merely a chimney. But several other
features in the alignments at Monte Alban suggest that it could have been an
astronomical observing device.
The other Mesoamerican zenith tube, at Xochicalco, is on an altogether
different scale from the one at Monte Alban. Located in the state of More
los, some seventy kilometers (forty-five miles) south of Mexico City and
about fifteen kilometers southwest of the city of Cuernavaca, Xochicalco’s
situation—draped over a series of artificially flattened and terraced hilltops
overlooking a deep valley over a hundred meters (330 feet) below—is noth
ing short of stunning. This city-state flowered early in the Epiclassic period,
c. C.E. 700–900 following the collapse of Teotihuacan to the north and
Monte Alban to the south. The tube here is over forty centimeters (sixteen
inches) wide and descends for more than five meters (sixteen feet) before
opening out into the roof in the far corner of a cave chamber almost twenty
meters (sixty-five feet) long and twelve meters (forty feet) wide, dug out of
the living rock. The chamber is supported by three rock pillars and reached
by a network of subterranean passages.
The effect of the midday sun shining down the Xochicalco zenith tube
is spectacular indeed, sending a vertical beam of bright sunlight down into
the dark cave. But because of the width of the tube, this phenomenon is not
confined to the days of solar zenith passage. In fact, the sun first shines di

rectly down the tube, producing a brief spot of sunlight on the chamber
floor, at local noon on April 30. As the sun passes closer to the true zenith
at noon on successive days, the length of time when its light shines directly
onto the floor increases, as does the proportion of its disc that is visible at
maximum, until May 15, when it passes directly across the zenith at noon.
After this, the length and proportion visible start to decrease again until the
solstice is reached, when the noonday sunbeam has almost disappeared. The
sequence is then repeated in reverse: zenith passage is reached on July 29,
and the last spot of direct sunlight is seen on around August 12. A number
of early descriptions dating back to the mid-nineteenth century reassure us
that no dubious reconstructions have taken place and that these alignments
are reliable.
Since it was first investigated astronomically, there have been many fur
ther suggestions about the Xochicalco tube. One is that this is just an ap
proximate zenith device, but others argue that the dates of appearance and
reappearance of noon sunlight are significant, since they fall exactly fifty
two days before and after the solstice respectively, and the fifty-two-day in
terval is calendrically significant. Furthermore, the length of the period of
darkness—before the sun starts to appear at noon again—is (within a day or
two of) 260 days, exactly the length of the sacred calendar cycle or tonalpo
hualli. Still others suggest that the moon might have been at least as impor

tant as the sun at Xochicalco, since at minor standstill it passes directly
through the zenith at this latitude. The idea is given some credence by the
discovery, in excavations during the 1980s, of a unique crescent-moon
shaped stele.
We cannot be certain that the Monte Alban and Xochicalco zenith
tubes were really used for the purposes of astronomical observation, but a
good deal of circumstantial evidence supports this view. Furthermore, the ex
istence of solar zenith passage devices like this seems plausible enough in the
context of Mesoamerican worldview, in which (with variations) the up
down axis is a fundamental means of orientation, together with the four car
dinal directions. The importance of the zenith sun is also well attested in his
torical accounts, iconography, and ethnography. The effect of sunlight
entering the underground chambers is certainly spectacular, and it is hardly
surprising that the Xochicalco “observatory” has become a popular tourist
attraction. If we are lucky, other examples still wait to be discovered in the
future, in Mesoamerica and elsewhere.

This general bibliography contains the principal sources used in compiling the entries, together with a number of additional works. Some focus upon broad themes and issues in cultural astronomy and typically include a range of case studies; some relate to particular cultures with a greater or lesser emphasis on practices relating to the sky; and some serve to put such astronomy in a broader cultural context. Others provide essential information for those wishing to visit and investigate particular monuments first hand: this category includes serious guides and gazetteers. The list also includes a small number of works that introduce background concepts and information, both from astronomy and from the human sciences. Journal articles are included only where they address broad themes and include material of which summaries cannot readily be obtained in any available book. Likewise, web sites are cited only in exceptional cases, because they do not constitute a permanent medium. A small number of the cited works describe the development of this field of study, or themselves form landmarks within that development. The cited works are in English unless otherwise stated. The reader should approach the literature on ancient astronomy with caution. Because of its interdisciplinary nature, peppered with popular misconceptions, the subject is particularly prone to sensationalism and uncritical scholarship. These creep all too frequently into academic publications from which they can easily become propagated further in books directed at a wider audience. Collective works and conference proceedings may, likewise, contain articles varying widely in content, approach, and quality. Short notes are included against many of the works listed in the bibliography, in an attempt to help the reader navigate this minefield and to select reliable and authoritative sources, or else to approach the wider available literature with a duly critical eye. Various encyclopedia entries elaborate further on some of the main problems and issues.

Glossary
This glossary gives short definitions of certain terms that occur regularly within thematic entries and case studies. Some readers will find useful a fuller explanation of some of these concepts, and an asterisk indicates that the topic is elaborated further in the main body of the encyclopedia. Italicized words cross-refer to other glossary entries.
*ACCURACY. The closeness of a measurement to the true value. Cf. Precision. *ACRONICAL RISE. [Alternatively spelled “acronychal,” for example in British usage.] Strictly, the rising of a star at sunset. This event is not directly visible and the term is sometimes loosely applied to the annual last visible rising of a star in or after the evening twilight. *ACRONICAL SET. [Alternatively spelled “acronychal,” for example in British usage.] Strictly, the setting of a star at sunrise. This event is not directly visible and the term is sometimes loosely applied to the annual first visible setting of a star in or before the morning twilight. *ALTITUDE. The angle between the direction to an observed point and the horizontal plane through the observer, with a positive value indicating that the point is above the observer. Cf. Elevation. ANTIZENITH. The point directly beneath the observer, also known as the nadir. Cf. Zenith.
ARC MINUTE. An angle equal to one sixtieth part of a degree, and hence 1 / (60 × 360) or one 21,600th part of the whole circle. This angle is roughly equivalent to the distance between the front and back of a sheep or similar-sized animal viewed side-on (one meter, or three feet) at a distance of about three kilometers (two miles). The apparent diameter of the sun and moon, by comparison, is about thirty arc minutes. ARC SECOND. An angle of one sixtieth of an arc minute, and hence 1 / (60 × 60 × 360) or one 1,296,000th part of the whole circle. This angle is roughly equivalent to the distance between the eyes of a sheep or similar-sized animal viewed front-on (ten centimeters, or four inches) at a distance of about eighteen kilometers (eleven miles). ASTERISM. In modern astronomy, a grouping or pattern of stars that does not form a (modern Western) constellation; in cultural astronomy the term may also be applied to a (historical or indigenous) constellation. ASTROLABE. An instrument for measuring and determining the positions of the sun and bright stars as seen from given locations at given times; in many senses a precursor to the modern planisphere. *AZIMUTH. Bearing clockwise from due north. CELESTIAL NORTH POLE. Point on the celestial sphere, visible from any location in the northern hemisphere where the relevant part of the sky is unobscured, around which the celestial bodies appear to rotate daily (in a counterclockwise direction). CELESTIAL SOUTH POLE. Point on the celestial sphere, visible from any location in the southern hemisphere where the relevant part of the sky is unobscured, around which the celestial bodies appear to rotate daily (in a clockwise direction). *CELESTIAL SPHERE. Imaginary sphere surrounding the observer on which the celestial bodies can be considered to be positioned. *CIRCUMPOLAR STAR. For a given location on earth, a star that is always above the horizon and so never sets or rises. CODEX. In the Mesoamerican context, an indigenous “book” made from pages of painted tree bark folded together in concertina fashion. CODICES. Plural of Codex.
Glossary 483
Pure Mathematical Physics



COSMOGRAM. A symbolic representation of the cosmos, as found in some Mesoamerican codices. CULMINATION. The moment when a celestial object reaches its highest altitude, which happens when it crosses the meridian. *DECLINATION. “Latitude” on the spinning celestial sphere. *DIURNAL MOTION. Daily rotation of the celestial sphere. DOLMEN. Most usually, a megalithic monument comprising a large horizontal stone supported by a number of upright stones. Sometimes the term is applied to a wider range of megalithic tombs. *ECLIPTIC. The annual path of the sun through the stars on the celestrial sphere. *ELEVATION. Height above sea level. Cf. Altitude. *EQUINOXES. Technically, the times when the sun’s declination is zero, but often loosely taken to mean the halfway point in time between the solstices. *EXTINCTION. The dimming of a star at low altitude due to the earth’s atmosphere. GNOMON. A rod, pole, or equivalent device whose function is to cast a shadow for the purposes of reckoning time, typically as part of a sundial. *HELIACAL RISE. The annual first appearance of a star, or the first appearance of a planet, in the eastern sky before sunrise after a period of invisibility. *HELIACAL SET. The annual last appearance of a star, or the last appearance of a planet, in the western sky after sunset before a period of invisibility. HENGE. A prehistoric enclosure consisting of a circular ditch and adjacent external bank, of which many were constructed in Britain and Ireland during the Late Neolithic period. Associated rings of timber posts or stone circles were common but not universal, and were not always part of the original design. Although the term “henge” derives from Stonehenge (that is, like Stonehenge but without the stones), Stonehenge itself—ironically—is not now generally considered a henge, since the circular ditch and bank at the site are of early (Middle Neolithic) date and the bank is internal to the ditch. HIEROPHANY. An appearance of the sacred, or the experience of this. The term is commonly used to describe a spectacular effect perceived as mystical, such as those produced by sunlight and shadow at ancient sites, but only on rare occasions. INFERIOR PLANET. A planet whose orbit is closer to the sun than the Earth’s. The two inferior planets, Venus and Mercury, are both visible to the naked eye, although Mercury, being closer to the sun, is more seldom seen. Cf. Inner planet and Superior planet.
INNER PLANET. One of the four planets closest to the sun, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Cf. Inferior planet and Outer planet. KIVA. A subterranean building in the southwestern United States, roofed and used as a meeting place or for sacred ceremonies. LATITUDE. Angular distance from the equator of a location on the earth. Because of a confusion of terminology it is better to speak of declination on the spinning celestial sphere.
LUNATION. The time that it takes the moon to complete its cycle of phases. Equivalent to synodic month.
MAJOR STANDSTILL LIMITS. The most northerly or southerly possible rising or setting positions of the moon, which can only be reached around the time of a “major standstill,” which only occurs every 18.6 years. See the encyclopedia entry Moon, Motions of. MEGALITHIC MONUMENT. Any monument built of large stones, applied particularly to prehistoric tombs and temples built in Europe during the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age.
484 Glossary
Pure Mathematical Physics



*MERIDIAN. Imaginary line across the sky, joining the north point on the horizon to the south point and passing through the zenith. MIDSUMMER SUNRISE. Popular term for sunrise at the summer solstice. MIDSUMMER SUNSET. Popular term for sunset at the summer solstice. MIDWINTER SUNRISE. Popular term for sunrise at the winter solstice. MIDWINTER SUNSET. Popular term for sunset at the winter solstice. NADIR. The point directly beneath the observer, also known as the antizenith. Cf. Zenith.
NEOLITHIC. Broadly speaking, a prehistoric society whose subsistence is based on animal herding or agriculture but lacks any knowledge of metallurgy. Meaning “New Stone Age,” the term is a remnant of the “three-age” classification (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age) that has long been superseded as a primary indicator of social development but is often still retained for convenience. The term is seldom used in reference to the Americas. *OBLIQUITY OF THE ECLIPTIC. The amount by which the earth’s axis is “tilted” with respect to the plane of its orbit about the sun. More precisely, the angle between the earth’s axis and the direction perpendicular to the plane of its orbit. OUTER PLANET. One of the five planets furthest from the sun, namely Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Only Jupiter and Saturn are visible to the naked eye. Cf. Inner planet and Superior planet.
*PARALLAX. The difference between the position of an object in the sky as viewed (conceptually) from the center of the earth and (actually) from somewhere on the earth’s surface. It is only significant in the case of the moon. *PRECESSION. Short for “precession of the equinoxes.” A gradual change in the orientation of the earth’s axis with respect to distant space, which results in the positions where the solstices and equinoxes occur slowly shifting along the earth’s orbit. This significantly alters the position of any given star in the sky over a timescale of centuries. *PRECISION. The degree of consistency of several measurements of the same thing by a particular method. Cf. Accuracy. QUADRANT. An instrument for measuring the altitude of a celestial body. QUADRIPARTITE COSMOLOGY. A perception of the world, or cosmos, as viewed from a central place as being divided horizontally into four quarters, each with distinctive properties and qualities. *REFRACTION. The bending of light, in particular as it passes through the atmosphere, which causes astronomical objects near to the horizon to appear higher than they actually are. SARSEN. A type of large sandstone block found extensively in southern England and used in the construction of Stonehenge. *SOLSTICES. The times of year when the sun reaches its highest or lowest declination and moves on its most extreme daily path across the sky (which, outside the tropics, is its highest or lowest). One solstice occurs on or close to June 21 and the other on or close to December 22. SUMMER SOLSTICE. June solstice (northern hemisphere) or December solstice (southern hemisphere). SUPERIOR PLANET. A planet whose orbit is farther out from the sun than the earth’s. The superior planets visible to the naked eye are Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Cf. Inferior planet and Outer planet.
SYNODIC MONTH. The time that it takes the moon to complete its cycle of phases. Equivalent to lunation. TRILITHON. A formation of three stones, with two vertical uprights holding up a horizontal lintel, as at Stonehenge and Ha‘amonga-a-Maui.
Glossary 485
Pure Mathematical Physics



TROPICAL YEAR. The seasonal year, equal to the time taken by the sun to complete one circuit around the celestial sphere. It is not quite the same as the time taken for the earth to complete an orbit of the sun (the “sidereal year”) because of precession.
WINTER SOLSTICE. December solstice (northern hemisphere) or June solstice (southern hemisphere). ZENITH. The point in the sky directly above the observer. Cf. Antizenith or nadir. ZODIAC. A set of asterisms spread around the ecliptic and hence useful as reference points for the sun’s annual motion through the stars. The term is commonly used to refer to the particular set of twelve zodiacal constellations that has come to be recognized in the modern Western world.

together with nontechnical explanations of more BASIC CONCEPTS, mostly as
tronomical, often elaborating on short definitions to be found in the glossary.
Some entries elaborate upon key THEMES and ISSUES relating to ancient astron

Chronological Index
This list provides a broad indication of the date range, or the principal data range, within which particular case studies fall. The ranges chosen are unavoidably arbitrary, and in such a very wide variety of examples the accuracy to which a date can be quoted varies considerably, both because of the inherent nature of the example concerned and the different types of dating evidence available in any given case. As a general rule we can only present a best estimate on the basis of current evidence. Some items span more than one date range, and the “Modern indigenous” category includes several examples where cultural traditions demonstrably extend back well into the past. Entries not confined to a single date range or even a few such ranges are listed separately at the end.
Labels such as Palaeolithic, Neolithic, Copper/Bronze/Iron Age, etc. have been avoided here on the grounds that they reflect developments occurring at (sometimes very) different dates in different parts of the world and place undue emphasis upon purely technological innovation. Readers interested in the correlation between astronomical practice and the nature of the human society concerned are referred to the Cultural Index that follows.

In this list, case study entries are classified according to the type of society concerned. Such categorizations inevitably oversimplify, in that they ignore and obscure many important variations between one human society and another. In the 1960s and 1970s, many archaeologists believed that one could classify human societies in straightforward terms—the main ones being band, tribe, chiefdom, and state—arguing a strong correlation between the size of the political unit, social and economic organization, and means of subsistence. Such naïve ideas have largely been superseded. One problem is that they carry the implication that we can measure every human society’s progress along a single inevitable path of social development. Added to this, in the case of past societies, the very categorization is a matter of interpretation from the available archaeological or historical evidence and (particularly in prehistory) can in itself be highly questionable. The extent to which (for example) communities in Neolithic Britain developed from segmentary societies (i.e., with no social group or village dominating over the others) into chiefdoms has been a matter of intense debate, and even to focus on this question is arguably to be distracted from more interesting and more complex issues of settlement organization and the development of social differentiation. For these reasons, the set of categories used in this list is intended merely to give the broadest indication of the nature of the human society responsible for a particular set of practices relating to the sky. Thus the pastoral/agricultural category covers, on the one hand, communities that are primarily mobile pastoralists and herders, and on the other, societies whose principal means of subsistence is agriculture and who live in fixed homesteads, whether scattered through the landscape or clustered together into villages; the common feature is that they are not organized into chiefdoms or larger political units. It is a broad category but not easy to subdivide, since there is no clear demarcation between mobile pastoralism and sedentary agriculturalism. Likewise the “state” category spans a range from small, competing city-states (as, for example, in pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica) to large empires.
