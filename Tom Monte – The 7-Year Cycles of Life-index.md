The 7-Year Cycles of Life
Many traditional societies saw an implicit order in life
that we moderns often fail to see. Among the more
important lessons that traditional people drew from
such an order was that every stage of life offers a
specific set of challenges and lessons that add to our
maturity and support our individuation.
In the early part of the 20th Century, Rudolf Steiner,
the great seer and philosopher, offered his own map
of life that revealed some of the important lessons we
must master as we develop. Steiner presented this
map as 10 cycles that all of us who make it to the age
of 70 years old must pass through. Each cycle,
Steiner said, is composed of seven years, and each
cycle offers its own challenges and rewards. If we
confront these lessons with courage, honesty, and

sincerity, the lessons will be mastered and our
psychological and spiritual development will bring
forth great rewards. Here are Steiner’s cycles of life.
AGES 0 to 7: From Oneness
with Mother to Growing
Autonomy
We are never more dependent in life than we are at
birth and during the early years of our lives. Yet, we
naturally move away from our mothers toward a
growing sense of our own individuality and
autonomy. This is the lesson of the first stage of life
the experience of utter dependence on our mothers
for life, followed by a natural movement away from
her toward a growing sense of our own individuality
and power.
In the early years of life, especially between birth to
age two, a child can hardly distinguish between
himself and his mother. But as the child begins to
crawl, and then stands up and walks, she naturally
experiences a greater sense of personal power and
freedom from her mother. The energetic umbilical
chord is being tested. It is stretching and eventually is
meant to be broken.
We typically refer to this process as growing up, but
Steiner saw it in exactly the opposite way. He said we

are “growing down,” meaning the spirit, little by little,
is incarnating into the physical body, thus making it
stronger and, in the process, giving the child a greater
sense of self.
Gradually, the child comes to know himself as
separate from his mother. He has specific needs and
wants that demand attention and fulfillment. The
child enters the “terrible twos,” when individuality is
thrust upon him. He or she is experiencing
separation and the early stages of his or her own
desires. And all of it reveals that the child’s own
unique soul is moving ever more deeply into the
physical body.
As the child incarnates, her etheric, or energetic body
more fully integrates with, and permeates, the
physical body. One of the early signs that this is
happening is that the child produces teeth, thus
allowing her to eat solid food and wean from breast
milk.
At the age of four or five, the child goes off to school
a big moment of separation from mother – and
begins to socialize more extensively with other
children. This experience will draw forth the child’s
individuality even more fully. He has begun the path
of experiencing who he is.
AGES 7 TO 14: A Fight for,



and Commitment To, Life
The emerging power of the child’s life force and
commitment to life is tested during this period.
Suddenly, the childhood illnesses appear — measles,
mumps, and chicken pox. These illnesses challenge
and threaten our lives. The disease fighting forces
within us – indeed, the very will to live – is confronted
and tested. The immune system must either rise and
meet the challenges, or be defeated by them. Our
very survival is on the line.
Huge energetic shifts take place. The body’s life force
takes the next step of grounding more fully into the
physical body in order to meet the challenges to life.
Fevers rage, elimination processes – such as runny
noses, watery eyes, diarrhea, and frequent urination
run wild. The body is fighting for its life. And in the
process, it is drawing on life forces that must either
ground and stake their hold on life, or retreat and
leave life behind.
When the diseases are defeated, a rebirth takes
place, marked by hormonal changes that move us
into puberty. We have landed and are now
incarnating as a sexual being.
AGES 14 TO 21. Wild
Emotions, Raging Hormones,



Sexuality
Steiner maintained that our emotions are housed in a
specific aspect of our spirit, which he referred to as
the astral body. The etheric body is pure life energy,
with its own intelligence that is needed to run the
physical body and maintain its health. The astral
body is another layer of the field of energy that
comprises the human energy field. The astral aspect
of the energy field holds the emotions, which during
this period flare up like a wild horse and demand
attention and harnessing.
This phase of life is dominated by often unruly and
confusing emotional energies. This turbulence is
reflected in the unpredictability of our relationships.
We form friendships that somehow turn into conflicts
and betrayal. We become infatuated, fall in love,
establish intense romantic attachments, and just as
easily fall out of love, often resulting in great pain and
enormous emotional dramas. In other words, we’re a
mess.
Physical and emotional instincts run wild. Hormones
rage. We’re driven by emotional and instinctual
needs that are irrational and often beyond our
control. Indeed, the rational mind has not yet been
fully integrated into our nervous systems. Hence, we
have no real grounding, nor a strong controlling or
tempering force.



Steiner maintained that during this period, our animal
nature rules our lives. We are attempting to face,
and take the first steps toward, integrating the
powerful emotional and instinctual energies that lie
within the human soul. We are little prepared for
such a confrontation, which is why this period seems
so confusing and filled with mistakes in judgment and
behavior.
AGES 21 TO 28. Play That
Turns Toward Responsibility
In the early and middle 20s, we gain a modicum of
control over our emotions and start to integrate our
rational faculties, which give us greater control over
our actions. During these years, most people are
healthy, full of energy, and lusting for life. Meanwhile,
our physical powers are peaking. It’s common for
young people to feel a certain invincibility and even
arrogance. People at this age are often possessed by
wild enthusiasm, independence, and recklessness.
They take risks, play hard, and often make mistakes.
These are the years that young men are sent off to
war. Despite the horrors of war, many young men
enlist for the fighting, always believing that they will
not be among the ones who are killed.
Over time, the abandon of the early and mid-20s
gives way to the growing maturity that slowly takes



hold as we enter the later 20s and start looking at the
approaching milestone of 30 years of age. As we
approach 30, we begin to feel the need to become a
responsible adult.
Indeed, the events coincide with those feelings and
needs. People marry and have children during this
time. Young men have to grow up, get steady jobs,
early a living, and provide for their wives and babies.
For many, the wild years pass away. Responsibility
starts to tie us down.
The compensation, Steiner said, is that we begin to
experience the first signs of our talents and special
abilities. We awaken to vocations that we feel a
special attraction to and, for some, even love. Our
mythological flights of fantasy and arrogance are
passing. We are landing in life, and just beginning to
become more practical.
We are also learning to think about people other than
ourselves. We are being stretched to see life in
broader and more selfless terms.
The centaur, or the mythological beast that was half
human and half horse, best characterizes this period,
Steiner said. The human is emerging from the base,
animal instincts. We are still driven by our animal
impulses, but we are learning to cope with them, as
the higher human faculties become more available to
our us.



AGES 28 TO 35. The Body In
Full Bloom
By the age of 35, the skeleton has reached its optimal
bone mass and density. Everyone loses about 1
percent bone mass per year. The body will begin its
decline after 35, but between 28 and 35, its
remarkable powers are peaking.
At this point, the physical body has matured to the
point that it has given us as strong foundation as it
can. Yes, we can improve our health and even enjoy
greater physical vitality after this period — if we
behave in ways that support the physical body. But
such health-enhancing behaviors must call upon
potentials that already lie within the physical
organism. Such potentials are there in the bank of
the body, awaiting the opportunity to manifest, under
the right conditions.
Having established our physical foundation, we start
to experience the full thrust of our ambitions. The
talents that may have begun to announce themselves
in the late 20s are, for many people, bursting forth
during this period, as well. We strike out on a career
path that will allow us to utilize our abilities for our
own benefit.
At the same time, there is often an enormous
appetite for learning and enhancing our skills. This



period challenges us to channel our skills into specific
area of life. We are being asked by life to specialize
and develop expertise. Individuate, life is saying.
Become a unique being. In specialization and
individuality, you will gain power.
Many people become highly competitive with others
during this period. Our ambitions and desires to get
ahead can cloud our vision, forcing us to see people
and situations in simplistic contrasts of friend or foe,
black or white. We are being challenged to look
beyond these simple formulas and see more deeply
into the complexity of people and of life.
As metaphor, Steiner said that this period can best be
characterized as a knight riding a horse. We are now
in command of our physical powers and instincts and
able to use them for our personal vision and desires.
AGES 35 TO 42. Crisis and
Questioning
In gardening, it’s called “pruning.” A plant gets cut
back, trimmed, made smaller, and in the process it is
made stronger. It may have seemed that we were
pressing ahead, and that our power was rising, but
this is precisely when things seem to go awry.
During this period, crisis hits. Usually that crisis
occurs when we are in our early 40s, as opposed to
the mid-30s. In any event, many of us experience



being cut down by events that seem beyond our
control. And in the process, we experience
disappointment and a sense of failure. The most
common of these disappointments are divorce, or the
collapse of a business, or financial strife. Others
suffer a health crisis of one kind or another.
Whatever occurs, many of us experience life-altering
setback and lose confidence in ourselves and in life.
At this point, we can either embrace our limitations
and live smaller lives, or begin again. We are
challenged to start anew, to refine and rethink our
ways, but to remain committed to our dreams.
We are also asked to expand our vision of life and to
embrace a more spiritual approach to living. We did
not come into this life to be wholly consumed by
materialistic goals and ambitions. We came here to
learn and to grow our souls. The soul shakes the
cage of life during these years and wakes us up to its
presence and its needs.
We are being urged by Spirit to ask a few simple
questions: What is the true source of my happiness
and all that I want for me life? Is it the material world,
or does all I need and want flow from the Great Spirit?
If the latter is true, than I must turn to Spirit for all
that I need and want. And in the process, I must
begin to form a new relationship with my Source.
Steiner said that this period could best be described



by the metaphor of a man or woman leading a horse
by the reins. Our humanity, with its rational and
spiritual qualities, is now in front of our instincts,
leading the way. The spirit is emerging and is starting
to take charge of our lives. It is a time of transition.
We once lived exclusively from our own will and
power. Now we turn increasingly to God for all that
we need.
AGES 42 TO 49. Soul
Searching and Wonder
The 40s are a time of hard work and of laying a strong
foundation for our lives. We develop our own value
and work hard to establish a true competence and
expertise in our chosen field. Meanwhile, as we
approach the age of 49, we become increasingly
aware of a great transition in life. Children are
moving away from home. We are freed from old
responsibilities of family and child-rearing. Women
enter menopause or become perimenopausal. The
burden of childbearing is lifted. You’re more settled,
grounded, and adept at living life. Meanwhile, we
sense big changes ahead, as our 50s approach.
During this time, there is both soul searching and
wonder about life. No matter whether we are aware
of it or not, we are moving toward a profound
balance between mastery of early skills and new
spiritual powers with which can help us utilize those



skills.
As enter the latter stages of this period, creativity and
imagination blossom. Our vision of life expands and
we set off in new directions. We are more firmly
established in our professional lives. We have dug a
deep root in life. We feel more powerful. And we are
more rewarded for what we do.
We the first real signs of success, we start to mellow.
Many become involved in their community, or local
government, or do some kind of civic or charity work.
We develop a broader, humanitarian vision of life.
We seek to be of service to those in our community,
or country, or our world. Steiner said that spirit is
making greater demands on us to incarnate our
spiritual values and ideals into our daily lives. He
called this period the emergence of spirit-man or
spirit-woman. It is a time when the soul has gained
increasing control over our lives and is imposing its
values upon us. We begin to see, if only intuitively,
that a balance must be achieved between our earthly
needs and our idealistic concerns for humanity. As
we move closer to 49, we start to see those parts of
our lives that we overemphasized, and those parts
that we did not value sufficiently. This is a time of
self-reflection.
Our intuitive powers now become the compass by
which we direct our lives.



AGES 49 TO 56. An Ever
Growing Vision and
Understanding of Life
The gift of the 50s is inspiration, mastery, and
growing power. We are blessed with a wealth of
experience, which has given us a certain wisdom. If
we have integrated the gifts and ideals of the
previous cycles, and developed our souls, we
naturally emerge as important guides and leaders in
our communities and society at large. It is the start of
a new period of mastery and personal power.
You’ve suffered failures and experienced success.
Life has softened you and given you perspective. You
are no longer thrown about by the vicissitudes of
daily events. If you have taken care of your health,
and have retained your vitality, you can now start to
become the person you have always longed to be.
You are blessed with a second wind that can take you
the rest of the way in your life. The dream of being
your true self starts to take shape. It is within your
grasp.
Those who have neglected their spiritual life feel
increasingly confused by the aging process. They are
also terrified for their own mortality. They cling to an
illusory and faded youth, which becomes ever more
fleeting as the years pass.



AGES 56 TO 63. The
Crossroads: Mastery or
Reevaluation.
Steiner maintained that 56 is a major turning point in
life. At this point, new intuitive and spiritual powers
emerge into consciousness, especially if you have
been guided through life by your heart and soul.
Your intuition is now the single most important sense,
guiding you to your answers and giving you direction
in life. It is the basis for your sense of connection
with the Source. And as that connection grows, you
experience greater relaxation and comfort with life.
All of this occurs as your true dream for living
emerges into consciousness with greater clarity and
power. You feel called to a mission and you begin to
devote all your talents, understanding, and wisdom to
a cause greater than your own personal needs and
ambitions.
For those who have neglected their spiritual life,
Steiner said that the age of 56 marks a turning point
in which life forces a reassessment. This time is often
accompanied by some form of crisis that makes us
self-reflect and return to a more heart-centered and
spiritually based life. In the face of that crisis, we can
experience a loss of direction, a desperate fear of
mortality, which can awaken the need to return to a
more spiritual life.



Steiner said that Spirit forces a good hard look at your
life at this time, which can be painful and confusing,
especially if we have not spent a lot of time working
to develop our souls
AGES 63 TO 70. A Time of
Harvesting and Spreading
the Wealth.
This period is a time of blessing, grace, and
opportunity. In traditional communities, these were
the elders, those who were turned to for their
wisdom, vision, and intuitive gifts. We have been
freed from the struggles of life. Yet, we may still have
considerable energy and vitality. We are teachers,
advisors, guides, and sources of inspiration to
others. This is the period when we wish to give back
to the those who come after us, and are still
embroiled in the struggles of life. It is a time of great
power and reward. We still care deeply about the
struggles of others, yet we are no longer bound by
those struggles ourselves. Our main tether to society
is our love and caring and the knowledge that others
still need the gift of our experience, wisdom, and
guidance.
AGES 7O AND BEYOND.
Reflection.



During this period, you are no longer bound by any
responsibility to others. It is a time when you assess
and take stock of your life, reflecting on the past, and
experiencing the richness of the present. You are at
the threshold of rebirth into the next world and you
are preparing yourself for that next adventure. You
are awaiting the call.
There are blessings at every stage of life. All
traditional cultures maintained that life improved as
we go older. That is not the message so many of us
are given in this youth-oriented world of ours.
Nevertheless, there is still truth in what Steiner and
others have said – that the best years are ahead of us,
if we follow the dictates of the heart and develop the
awesome powers of our souls.
