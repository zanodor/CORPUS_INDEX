PEEFACE.
Whatever defects the criticism of this book may bring to light, its publication demands no apology. It embraces the results of patient and laborious researches, extending over a score of years ; for, three years before the discovery of the inscriptions of Hamath was made known, the history of the Hittite nation, as set forth in the Hebrew, Egyptian, and Assyrian records, had engaged my attention. The book consists of two parts ; the first being an analysis of all the legible Hittite inscriptions so far published ; the second, an extended history of the Hittite people. In presenting the translations and the history, I have had in view no controversy with any school of philology, history, or theology, my simple aim being to reconstruct with truthfulness, out of many widely scat* tered fragments, an important and long lost page of ancient history. The few scholars of note who have attempted the work of Hittite decipherment, and the value of whose labours I gratefully recognize, will not charge with injustice the statement that, up to the present time, the inscriptions of Hamath and Jerabis have guarded their secret. Five years ago, having discovered the method of interpretation, I gave in pamphlet form a Translation of the Principal Hittite Inscriptions yet Published. The method pursued in that paper was the true one, and many of the interpretations set forth in it were correct, but it abounded with such errors as are incident to all first essays in the decipherment of the unknown. In order to bring more light to bear upon the task, I meanwhile made a careful study of the inscriptions of Asia Minor, Etruria, Celt Iberia, and Pictish Britain, of Turanian India and of Siberia, all of which belong to the Hittite, or Canaanitic category, and by their means withdrew the Syrian documents from their isolation, to read their hieroglyphics in the reflection of the more recent and apparently alphabetic characters of these monuments. Some of these translations have already been published in fugitive form, and some are collected into a volume, entitled The Hittite Track in the East, shortly to appear. In the following pages I have, at the risk of being thought tedious, set forth minutely the process by which results have been reached in the transliteration of the hieroglyphics and the translation of their phonetic contents, so that any reader possessed of ordinary scholarship may, by means of the plates and text, follow it at every step and verify or criticize its results. For the plates I am indebted to Mr. W. Harry Rylands, of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, who has kindly permitted me to copy his admirable drawings of the inscriptions. The historical contents of these, commencing



VI. PREFACE.
with, the reign of the Assyrian Assur-nazir pal in the latter part of the tenth century, B.C., extending to that of Esarhaddon in the first part of the seventh, and embracing brief accounts of the til'st overthrow of the Assyrian empire by the Babylonian Phul, and of the conspiracy that led to the destruction of Hittite monarchy and the deportation of the tribes of Israel, should be of great interest to students of the Bible and of ancient oriental history, although disappointing, perhaps, to those who looked to the monuments for records of greater antiquity. All the cul^teral information furnished by the Assyrian monuments and ancient tradition has been made available for the elucidation of these invaluable documents. The second and larger part of the book contains a history of the Hittites from a period of time some three generations before the patriarch Abraham. The materials for this history are furnished by the Egyptian and Assyrian monuments, by the Greek historians, and by almost universal tradition, arising from the fact that the Hittites were in many respects the greatest of ancient peoples, and constituted the substratum of all early civilizations. The Turanian element that came into prominence in the palmy days of the Egyptian Hycsos, that underlay the culture of the empires on the Tigris and Euphrates, that preceded Israel's occupancy of Palestine, that filled Syria and Asia Minor, that gave to Greece her mythology and sacred rites, and, overflowing into Illyria, Italy, Spain and Britain, bore the Iberic and Pictish name, now only recognizable in the Bas(j[ues of the Pyrenees ; that element on which Cyrus built up his first Aryan empire, and which, volcano-like, broke forth in Parthian days, that preceded the Brahman in Northern India, that, in early Christian centuries, traversed Turkestan and peopled the Siberian wastes, that for two centuries turned China into Cathay, and that still occupies Corea and the islands of Japan ; that Turanian element, moreover, that, driven by adverse fortune, crossed the Northern Pacific into the New World, that reproduced the mounds of European Scythia, of Syria and the Caucasus, of India and Siberia, on level prairies and the alluvium of rivers from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico, that founded the empires of Mexico and Peru, and that lives in many an Indian tribe from the frozen north to the southern land of fire, is the Hittite. It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of this ancient people, without a record of whose exploits ancient history can hardly be said to exist. The thread on which the fragments of liistory, drawn from many lands and from documents most diverse in character, crystallize in order, is one furni.shed by the Hittites themselves. Some fifteen years ago, in the pages of the Canadmn Jovrnal and elsewhere, 1 drew attention to the presence of ancient Gentile records in the well known Hebrew Scriptures. All of these may be of Hittite origin ; one certainly is, the long genealogical record of the first book of Chronicles, so far a mere Bible lumber room, the despair of all commentators, but in reality a mine of historic treasure. In that list but partially concealed lie all the great names of the ancient world, from the time of the dispersion of nations down to the Exodus of Israel, and even beyond it.



PREFACE. Vll.
»
Thus the story of the Hittites furnishes that great desideratum of the Bible student, the connection of sacred and profane history, and to the investigator of the Egyptian and Euphratean monuments, it gives chronological data of the utmost importance. I have indeed written for students in all departments of learning who may care to read mj book, inviting tliat candid criticism and fair discussion by which the cause of truth mugt be advanced ; but above all, 1 have written for the educated reader of the English language, and, while I cannot flatter myself that in so extensive a field every obscurity has been removed, I may claim the merit of him who believes that no science need transgress the limits of
his mother tongue to find its adequate expression.

THE INSCRIPTIONS OF THE HITTITES.






THE HITTITES:
THEIR INSCRIPTIONS AND THEIR HISTORY.
CHAPTER I.
Discovery of the Monuments.
In Central Syria, almost half way between the borders of Palestine and Asia Minor, lies Hamah, the Hamath of the Bible and the Epiphanea of the Greeks. Beautifully situated on either
bank of the Orontes, it has little else than natural beauty to
boast, for its temples and palaces are heaps of ruins. Surrounded
by lofty mountain ranges, it is so isolated from the rest of the
world that it seems a relic of a former state of existence, and has been compared to a Pompeii of the living.-^ Yet in Hamah itself
and in all the neighbouring country there linger traditions of
a glorious past, when Hamath was among the chief cities of the world. These traditions can hardly relate to Mohammedan days, although an Arabian dynasty kept regal state in the ancient town, and sent forth from its line and capital the great historian and geographer Abulfeda.^ Nor can the Syrian successors of Alexander have been witnesses of a dignity which they endeavoured to restore by imparting to the city the name of the infamous Antiochus Epiphanes. Back into the past we must go, to a time coeval with the ancient monuments of which it has recently been deprived, to find in Hamath a competitor for greatness with Babylon and Nineveh, with Jerusalem and Damascus. For there were ancient monuments in this sleepy hollow of the ninteenth century. The traveller Burckhardt passed through Hamah in the year 1812 on his way from Aleppo to Damascus, and saw
stones engraved with strange chai'acters. He chronicled the fact

but did nothing more.^ Fifty-eight years came and went before the stones were rediscovered, although many observing eyes must have peered into the city's recesses, and its thirty thousand inhabitants must have had ample opportunity for making their treasures known. Then the United States Consul General Johnson, in company with the Rev. S. Jessup of the Syria
Mission, paid a visit to the old town. Like all strangers they sought the Bazaar and inspected the wares with which the Syrian merchants tempt the eye of the occidental and deplete his purse. From shop to shop they went, until in the corner of one their gaze rested, for there, engraved upon a large stone, were mysterious characters akin to those which had attracted the attention of Burckhardt. To obtain a squeeze of this stone was
their great desire, but a desire they failed to realize ; for the native frequenters of the bazaar thronged about the strangers, and, with the brutal menacing attitude so naturally assumed by the sons of the Prophet, compelled them to relinquish their examination of the ancient record.* Probably the black stone of the Caaba at Mecca has something to do with the strange superstition that Mohammedans evince regarding inscribed stones. There is virtue in them, and that virtue must not pass
into the possession of the Frank, lest it give him power to inflict injury on the Moslem. The two travellers learned that other inscriptions similar to that in the bazaar, were to be found in Hamah. They went forth, and saw one on a stone over the city gate, in which the elders sit as in ancient Syrian days. Near the gate they found another ; and, crossing one of the bridges that, spanning the
Orontes, connect the two divisions of the city, they were shown
a third. As the inscriptions of Hamath are five in number, that
found near the gate must have been the one which Mr. Jessup tried to purchase, as the stone in the bazaar furnished not
one but two inscriptions. The missionary failed to make a bargain,,
for the blue stone was a source of revenue to its owner, who,
for a consideration, allowed people afflicted with spinal disease

to lie upon its uneven surface. The consul and he were therefore compelled to have recourse to a native artist, who made
faithful copies of the inscriptions, and sent them on their way
rejoicing. Returning to Beyrout wdth their treasures, Messrs Johnson and Jessup communicated the intelligence of their discovery to two eminent men, the lamented Professor E. H. Palmer and Dr. Eisenlohr of Heidelberg. The former, deeply interested in the documents, induced the Palestine Exploration Society to send Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake to Hamah, to obtain undoubted copies of the inscriptions already found and of any others that suljsequent research might discover. Thus the scientific world was awakened to the knowledge that important records of the past awaited decipherment. The following year, 1871, Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake visited Hamah provided with apparatus for taking squeezes and photographs. He was more successful than his American predecessors, and obtained copies of the inscriptions more accurate than those made by the
native artist.^ A third series of casts was taken in 1872, by the Rev. William Wright, of Damascus, through the influence of Mr.
Green, H. M. Vice-Consul in that city.^ Illustrations of the
copies thus obtained were published in the statements of the British and American Palestine Exploration Societies, and in Burton and Drake's Unexplored Syria. Taking as his basis the casts made by Mr. Wright, now in the British Museum, the Secretary of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, Mr. W. Harry Rjdands, prepared from the three sources indicated the textus.
recephis of the Hamath inscriptions, which he published in
1882, in the transactions of his society. Individual inscriptions and fragments had been published as early as 1871 by various writers, and since the appearance of Mr. Rylands' copies, the public has had opportunities of becoming acquainted with the whole of them, through the works of Mr. Wright and Captain Conder.'' The sleepy Porte awoke at last to the knowledge that the stones of Hamah were valuable. Men and oxen and camels

weie provided for the removal and transportation of the precious
relics ; and amid the wailino- of the prond and superstitious Mohammedans, bereaved of their talismanic glories, the stones were taken from the positions in which barbarous ignorance had placed them and laboriously conveyed away, to find a resting
place at last in the Museum of the Seraglio at Constantinople. So large were they that Mr. Wright tells us " it took four oxen and fifty men a day to bring one of the stones a distance of half a mile. The others were cut in two and the fragments inscribed were carried to the Serai on the backs of camels."
In the course of his investigation of the ruins of the ancient
Carchemish, the site of which is now called indifferently Jerabis and Jerablus, doubtless corruptions of the Greek Hierapolis, Mr. George Smith found on a broken statue lines of hieroglyphics similar in many respects to those of Hamath. Copies of the inscription reached England, but they were so imperfect that nothing could be made of them. However Consul Henderson continued the work of excavation, and at last in 1880 sent to the British Musuem several inscribed monuments. Others were furnished by Mr. Rassam, the worthy successor of Mr. George Smith in the work of Assyrian discovery. Nine of these are mere fragments, and the remaining three are much mutilatedOf the two that present sufficient material for decipherment, one
is a block of basalt over three feet in height, cut in vertical steps,
and containing figures more archaic in appearance than those of Hamath. The other is a statue of about five-and-a-half feet
high, also in basalt, representing " the full face figure of a king
or priest, standing in a niche." The inscription is carved upon the back of the stone which was smoothed to receive the writing. The.se Jerabis inscriptions have been carefully copied by Mr. Rylands from the originals in the British Museum.^ Before the discovery of these relics of Carchemish, and as early as 1872, Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake found an inscription of Hamathite character at Aleppo, in Syria, built into the wall of a ruined mosque. Copies of it were taken by him, by M. Clermont Ganneau, Mr. George Smith, Major General Crawford and Mr.

W. Boscawen. These various copies have been published by Mr. Rylands in the proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archa3ology, but they are so indistinct, and differ so widely, that the restora
tion of the text by their means is impossible. Long before the hieroglyphics of Hamath and Cai'chemish were known, Sir Henry Layard found in Sennacherib's palace, at Kouyunjik, a number of clay seals, the characters on which were unlike anything then discovered. These are now found to belong to the category of the Hamathite inscriptions, but their
legends are so brief as to shed little light upon the language they set forth.^ More important by far is an inscribed stone bowl found at Babylon, an illustration of which was published Ity Mr. Rylands in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Arch
aeology. While the inscription contains many symbols identical with those of Hamah and Jerabis, it also has others much less
elaborate in character, which indicate a more recent origin for the bowl and an approximation to a simpler alphabetic or syllabic
notation.^" Turning now from the Syrian and Euphratean region to Asia Minor, the mysterious characters still meet us. The first monument containing these which attracted attention was the representation of a figure of a warrior holding a wine cup, before
whom stands a captive. The hieroglyphics, of which as yet there
is no perfect copy, are in three small groups about the figures. This monument was first depicted by Major Fischer in 1838, but was rediscovered by the Rev. E. J. Davis, who published an account of it in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Arch
seolocjy.i^ j^ ^^g^g found at Ibreez in Lvcaonia, in the neighbour
hood of the Lysti-a and Derbe, with which readers of the Acts of
the Apostles are familiar. The sight of this sculpture and
inscription led Professor Sayce, of Oxford, to compare with it the drawings made by Texier, Hamilton, and Perrot, of specimens of the ancient art of Asia Minor, found in Phrygia, Lydia, and the adjoining regions.^"^ He also made a personal inspection of

6 THE HITTITES.
many of the monuments, and in particular of the two sculptures at Karabel between Smyrna and Sardes, which Herodotus observed twenty-three centuries ago, and attributed to the mythical Egyptian Sesostris. At once Professor Sayce came to the conclusion that these and all monuments of the same class were the work of the Hittites, and necessarily gave a similar origin to the
allied records of Syria. As early as 1874, the Rev. William Wright
had indentified the Hamah Inscriptions with the Hittites, and in 1871, Consul General Johnson of Beyrout had suggested that they might contain an account of the struggles of the Egyptian and Assyrian conquerors with the Hittite people.^^ Only one of the pseudo Sesostris figures is accompanied with hieroglyphics, and these, originally eight in number, are somewhat defaced, yet not
so much so as to be unintelligible.
The most recent addition to the Hittite corpus inscriptionurti is the lion of Merash. At Merash, the ancient Marasia on the eastern border of Cappadocia and Cilicia, where Asia Minor meets Syria, two stone lions were found over a gateway, the front and one side of the animals being covered with hieroglyphics in a good state of preservation. They were conveyed to the Museum
at Constantinople, where Mr. F. D. Mocatta obtained a plaster
cast of one of them. From this cast, Mr. Rylands has made two admirable drawinofs, thus furnishincj students with one of uhe
longest and most perfect Hittite documents.^*
Owing to the exertions of Professor Sayce, a bilingual inscrip
tion, Hittite and cuneiform, was brought to light. An illustration of it with a detailed account of its discovery and characters was published by him in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical
ArchfBology.^^ This inscription is on a silver boss, which may have been originally the knob of a sceptre or dagger. It has been traced back to Smyrna where the Russian numismatist, Mr. Alexander Jovanoti', purchased it. Dr. Mordtmann was the first
to call attention to the boss, but it would have been lost to sight had not the Oxford Professor, with untiring perservance, sought

it out and set its contents before the world. Doubts have been cast upon the genuiness of the article itself, but none upon the inscription, which, if the boss be spurious, must have been taken from an older original.
This semi-cuneiform inscription leads to the last class of Hittite
documents, a series of clay tablets found chiefly in Cappadocia. Thece are in cuneiform writing, but the language they set forth is not Semitic. The original occupation of the whole of Asia Minor by the Hittites, and the undoubted occupation of Cappadocia by that people, naturally lead to an indentitication of the contents of the tablets with the language of the scribes of Hamah, Jerabis and Merash. Yet so far the text of these tablets is but imperfectly determined, inasmuch as some of the cuneiform
signs are indistinct, others obscure, and some that are well
known, capable of diflferent transliterations. A knowledge of
the context is thus necessary, in order to decide the reading of
the latter class, so that the tablets will not be available for
purposes of translation, until from other sources the Hittite language is fairly known. ^^ It will thus be seen that of the numerous inscriptions attribu
ted to the Hittites, those which are susceptible of a satisfactory
rendering are, the bilingual inscription on the silver boss, the
five from Hamah, two from Jerabis, the bowl inscription from Babylon, and the lion inscription of Merash. The reading of
these ten documents will afford a solid basis for Hittite studies, and give opportunity for scientific conjecture as to the signification of more fragmentary records, and of the cuneiform tablets from Cappadocia.

CHAPTER II.
Thk Work (jf Deciphermknt. —The Dkter:siination of
the hittite language.
Sixteen years have elapsed since the iirst Hittite inscription was published, and five, since Mr. Rylands furnished the world with his admirable copies of those of Hamah and Jerabis. Many scholars have exercised their ingenuity upon them ; some, like
Professor Sayce, resting content for the present with the indica
tion of probable values for particular signs ; others, like the Rev. Dunbar J. Heath and Captain Conder, hazarding translations
that have not stood the test of criticism.^ The partial success
attained indicates that there are grave difficulties in the way of Hittite decipherment. Two things are necessary in order to the
reading of an inscription ; the one, a knowledge of the phonetic value of the characters, the other, a knowledge of the language in which it is written. To begin with the latter, the only words known to be Hittite are proper names preserved in Egyptian and Assyrian monuments. These Professor Sayce has collected in
his article on the monuments of the Hittites.- It is supposed
that there is no modern or, at least, literary language which can perform for the stones of Hamah and Jerabis the service rendered by the Coptic to the Egyptian monuments, and by the Zend and Pehlevi to the Achfiemenian Persian. Nevertheless, guesses
have been made in this direction by the late M. Lenormant and Professor Sayce. The latter writer says : " As M. Lenormant was the first to point out. the language of the Vannic inscriptions (proto- Armenian) seems to belong to the Alarodian family of speech, of which Georgian is the best known living example, and in the modern Georgians we may perhaps see the physical type

THE WORK OF DECIPHERMENT. 9
of the Hittites and their kindred." ^ To this conclusion Prof"e.ssor Sayce was led by observing the similarity between Hittite names and those of the ancient Armenian inscriptions. Now Georgian is one of the unclassified languages of the northern hemisphere in most systems of comparative philology, but has been classified by the author with its sister tongues of the Caucasus, with tlie
Basque of western Europe, the languages of northern Asia, (Yeniseian, Yukahirian, Koriak, Japanese and Corean,) and with many American forms of speech, as constituing the Khitan family, the name being taken from the race that took possession of northern China, in the middle of the tenth century A.D., and imposed upon that empire the designation Cathay.^ In calling this family of languages, hitherto Unclassified, by
the name Khitan, an assertion is virtually made, that the namer
has discovered the dialects of which the Hittite of Syria and Asia Minor was the parent, and that he has thus solved half the problem of Hittite decipherment. Rigorous scientific proof will necessarily be demanded for such an assumption, which in its
details can hardly prove of interest to the general reader. Let it be remembered, however, that proper names are our only materials for connecting the Hittite with other forms of speech, and that these are the foundation of Messrs. Lenormant and Sayce's
affiliation of Hittite to the Alarodian family. True science says, carry forward this comparison of proper names, and, if you are
able, show that these names are significant in known languages.
Take for instance the name Hittite, in Egyptian, Khita, in Assyrian, Khatti, Khatte, Kheti. It does not follow that all
Hittites called themselves by this name, for they them.selves were Canaanites, and yet did not adopt the name of Canaan. This they left to the family of Sidon, Canaan's first-born. In the
same way the name Hittite ma}^ have been restricted to the senior branch of the descendants of Heth. It is allowed that the ab
original Cilicians were Hittite ; and Cetis, a district of that country in which the Cetii dwelt, confirms the fact. The Paschal

Chronicle, as was indicated many years ago, derives the Dardani of the Troad from Heth ; and Professor Sayce includes the Trojans among Hittitc peoples.'^ In their neighbourhood dwelt the Ceteii of Homer, whom Mr. Gladstone has indentified with the Hittites, and with them were the Cilices of the Troad.'' In the region of the Caucasus, Colchis preserved the Cilician name, and added to it that of Cyta, a place of such importance that the whole country was called the Cytean land. In the Susian inscriptions commented upon by M. Lenormant and Professor Sayce and translated by Dr. Oppert, a more eastern land of Khiti, or AttarKittah, is mentioned, lying somewhere between Media and Susiana." The ancient Persian historians place Cheen and Khata}^ between Persia and India, the approach to the latter country from Khatay being along the sea shore, so that the commentators are evidently in error who regard Khatay as northern China.* Cataea, the sacred island of the Carmanians mentioned by Nearchus, and many similar names in that province and in Gedi'osia, indicate an eastern migration of the Hittites.^ But in north-western India they appear once more as a historical people, the Cathaei of the Punjab, whose capital Sangala was stormed by Alexander the Great. ^^ Sangala in the Persian annals of Mirkhond and Firdusi becomes the name of a king, Shaukal or
Sinkol of Hindostan.^^ In Indian writinors Sanijala is called Sacral and Sakala, and is thoroughly identified with a Turanian people.^2 A fragmentary inscription from Buddha Gaya mentions, Sangara atogo goyosfd, the mighty successor or descendant of Sangara. And in another from Mathura, occurs the same name as Aramaka ga Sagara, or Sagara of Aramaka.^^ In the Assyrian

records of Samas Rimmon, the Singuriai are mentioned in an enumeration of the Hittite tribes.^-* Asshur-nazir-pal places a river Sangura among the Khatti, from which doubtless the Sangarius of Asia Minor derived its name, flowing as it does
through a region that was originally Hittite.^-^ Sangara or Sagara, king of the Hittites at Carchemish, appears in the inscriptions of Shalmanezer and other Assyrian monarchs; and, in a
note of his translation of the monolith inscription of Shalmanezer,
Professor Sayce suggests that the Hittite king " gave his name to the Singara of the classical geographers which was situated upon the Khaboras." ^^ The word Khita occurs in many Indian inscriptions, one of which from Mathoura reads as follows
:
TsiUemame ri ma Para Humara yofu Hoshrori, Sihir ga Kita ga meta, Hoshrori, the Father of Pala Humara, king of Sibir and Kita, conquers the Tsutemame.^'' The Tsutemame here mentioned were the Sushmins of the Puranas, the Assacani or Astaceni of the classical geographers and the namers of the Acesines. They also were a people of Hittite origin, the Zuzim or Zamzummin of the Bible, the Gagama of the Egyptians, the Gamgumi of the Assyrian monuments, whom Professor Sayce classes amono- Hittite tribes.^^ The whole of northern India was filled with Hittite conquerors from at least the sixth century B.C. till the sixth century A.D. Such were the Oxydracae of Arrian, the Tsutaruki of the Indian inscriptions, descendants of the Susian Sutruks ; and such, the Tokhares or Tucharas of Taxila, whom, as Tochari, Strabo brings from the Jaxartes, but whom Sennacherib found, as Tocharri, among the mountains of Nipur seven hundred years before.^^
At length the Brahmans overcame the war-loving Kshattriyas. The great struggle seems to have begun shortly before the Christian era, and to have terminated in the expulsion of the Indo Scyths or Hittites between the fourth and tenth centuries. The

fugitives occupied Turkestan, or great and little Bukharia, for a while, but, being pressed by Aryans from the south, Tartars from the west, and Chinese on the east, they w^ere compelled to move northwards into the inhospitable country beyond the Thianchan
mountains. Thither they carried one of their distinctive names, calling the country in which they dwelt Soungaria, a name afterwards appropriated by a family of the Mongol Kalmuks. Still the pressure continued, and the Hittite tribes which had already crossed the Himalayas and the Thianchan range, were forced to traverse the Altai mountains and take up their abode on the banks of the Yenisei. The tribe which named this new home was known in Indian story as the Sabaras or Sauviras, the
Sibiras of the Buddhist inscriptions, whose ancient Palestinian record was Tabor. They called the land in which they settled, Sibir, a name afterwards borrowed by the Tartars, whose Khanate of Sibir imposed upon all northern Asia the designation
Siberia. A miserable remnant of the Hittites is still found in that country. They are called the Yeniseians, but their own names for their various tribes are Kenniyeng, Assan, Kottuen and Arin, and every man is, according to the various dialects,
ket, kit, khitt, hitt, het, in other words a Hittite.^*^ The Yenisei country especially about Minousinsk and Krasnoiarsk is full of the remains of ancient empire. They have been described by Pallas, Castren, Popotf, Spassky, and Youferoff ; and consist of mounds from which many valuable and curious relics have been exhumed, and inscriptions on standing rocks and scattered
stones. ^^ Some of tliese inscriptions are of the same character as
tho.se found in parts of America, depicting liunting scenes in a similiar conventional way. Others bear Buddhist emblems, such as the hat and the cross. But most of them are engraved with characters closely akin to those which constitute the Lat inscrip

monarchs, such as Sakata, Matome, Makuba, who ruled over the Raba-Kita in the interests of Buddhism, and whose chief opponents were the Futamame, a tribal name inviting comparision with that of the Tsutemarae in the Indian inscriptions. One of
the dates given, that namely of the discipleship of Sakata, is 970 years from the death of Buddha. Now the attainment of nirvana by Buddha is placed by ditierent writers in 543 or 477 B.C. Thus the era of Sakata must have been either 427 or 493 A.D. Who were the Raba-Kita ? Their name recalls that of the Derben Oeroet or four allies, the name of the Kalrauks who appropriated to themselves the Hittite term Soungaria. It would thus link itself with the Kiprat Arba or four races of the
cuneiform inscriptions, and with Kirjath Arba of Palestine, the
city of Ephron, the Hittite son of Zohar. This Arba was originally the name of a man, the father of Anak, w^ho was a great man among the Anakim."^^ Asshur-nazir-pal mentions Aribua of the land of Khatti.^^ Towards India the Arbas may be found as the Arabics of Nearchus, dwelling in his time in Gedrosia, and whom he terms the most western of the Indians ;
^^ but it is
more probable that the Raba country lay to the south of Cashmere adjoining the region of Abisarus, as Darva and Abhisara are constantly united in the history of Cashmere, and that they represent the Palestinian Rephaim.-*^ Other Indian writings know them as Darvas and connect them with the Yavanas or Asiatic Huns.-" The memory of their Hittite origin and rule in the Yenisei country was till recently preserved among the Siberians, for, according to Malte Brun, the wandering Tartars called their mounds Li Katei or the tombs of the Cathayans.2^ The Siberian relics are too few and contain too little information to enable one to form an opinion as to the length of time the Raba Kita maintained themselves on the banks of the Yenisei.

Other Hittite tribes from India and Turkestan joined them, or established themselves on the outskirts of the great desert of Kobi. There and in Siberia they gathered strength, and soon measured their arms with those of the Chinese. The historians, of that people were guilty of romancing when they placed the Huns or Hiun-yu in warlike contact with their empire, seventeen hundred years before Christ, nor can the later dates from 16S B.C. to 196 A.D. be accepted for the contest between its sovereigns and the Hiong-nou, unless an earlier migration of the Yavanas from India be supposed than that consequent upon the Aryan uprising in the early Christian centuries.-^ It seems
evident, however, that the Yavanas or Huns were the first Hittite invaders of China. In Assyrian records they are earliest known as the Hittite Abaeni mentioned by Tiglath Pileser I,, about 1100 B.C. Later narratives of conquest place one branch of them in Armenia as the people of Van, and another in the south-east towards mount Zagros as the inhabitants of Diahbina.^*'^ The Armenian division occupied the country known to the
classical oreographers as Sophene. In India as in Sarmatia their abode was marked by the river name Hypanis. There are good reasons for connecting the Chinese dynasty of the Oriental Hans with the Huns. This dynasty is placed between the years 25 and 220 A.D. and includes emperors bearing the Yavana like names, Hoping, Heping, Hingping, and Yungping.^^ It was expelled from China; and, while most of the race took refuge in Japan, others are supposed to have gone west to Persia and Armenia, thus seeking the ancient home of their race. If the
Japanese annals are to be trusted, the Hans found their way to Japan about 300 A.D.^"^ Six centuries passed before the
owners of the Cathaean or Hittite name proper replaced them as rulers of China. The historians of that country relate that the Kitan or Khitan made themselves masters of Liao-tong, to the north-east of China on the way to Corea, in the year 907 ; that they conquered China towards the middle of the tenth century.

and were finally expelled in 1125.^^ It is worthy of note that one of the earliest monarehs of the Khitan dynasty was Sheketang, a name that invites comparison with the Sakata of the Yeniseian inscriptions, with the Indoscythic Maurya name Sangata, and with the Japanese Sagateno.^^ Klaproth published from Chinese sources a brief vocabulary of the Khitan language,
which he very unsatisfactorily attempted to connect with the Tungusic family.^^ It was the Khitan who gave to China its mediaeval name Cathay. " Khanbaligh " says, Sadik Isfahani, " is a place in Khata, one of the works of Kibla Kaan." ^e The Tungusian Nyuche expelled the Khitan, and the victorious Mongols soon after dispossessed the Nyuche, and drove the Khitan from Liao-tong. Where did they go ; in what land did they find refuge from their new enemies ? The nearest seat of
civilization to Liao-tong is Corea. The historians of that country know the Khitan, and make frequent mention of them from the year 685, when they first conquered northern Corea, till 1216,
when their chief Louko was put to deatli and their reign apparently came to an end.^'' Thus Corean history places the Khitan in Liao-tong almost three centuries before the historv of
China allows their conquest of that region. The connection of China with,Corea is said to have begun in 1120 B.C., when the Chow dynasty of China placed Khitsu, a member of the previous dynasty of Shang, upon the Corean throne.^^ The Shang dynasty had fallen through the inordinate cruelty of the last emperor Chow-sin and his wife Tan-ke. In the Raja Tarangini the same story of barbarous ferocity is related of Unmattavanti^ son of Partha of the Varma dynasty of Cashmere, whom Kalhana places between 939 and 941 A.D.^^ An almost identical account is given of the Dairi Bourets, in the history of Japan,
but his period is from 499 to 506 A.D.'*'^ It is worthy of note

that the Japanese successor of Bovirets is Kei-tai, a name inviting comparison with the Chinese and Corean Khitsu. Stories of revolting cruelty on the part of absolute monarchs are not wanting all the world over, but the similarity of detail in these three
accounts, and the coincidence in two of them of the names Partha
and Bourets, lead the enquirer after historical truth to ask if
they had not a common origin. There are three Indian inscriptions, one from Bitha, and two from Sravasti, which mention Partha.^^ The first reads : Futa meta Parta, Bagasare ga ojiri, Bika ga shone, Partha king of Futa, grandson of Bagasare, son of Bika. Outside this inscription are the words : gonivari Varma Bika, ifIlia Sena tami ki ga den, the regent Varma-Bika, Sena has spoken the word of the mind of the people. Sena then was the mother of Partha, and Varma-Bika, a prince consort or king by courtesy. Other inscriptions indicate that Varma-Bika was the .son of Gorami, and that the latter reigned or lived 243 years after Buddha, in ordinary computation 300 or 234 B.C. Gorami would thus be a contemporary monarch with the famous Asoka.
Tlie first Sravasti inscj'iption is: Rataha tsiiyoslii ; meta VarmaBika, Parta koka yofv. rimaye Kuniiri, Matori, Rataha the pjjwerful : Kumiri and Matori conquer Varma-Bika, the father
of Partha. The second is more difficult to translate, and, apart from tlie proper names, may be considered tentative : Matori tatsuri Satakwata ; itsuwara rogebutsit tuabi Bagori Futa to rari, uru haru iva koka ri Tsutaruki ga rikuta torita Parta yo. Satakwata sets up Matori : treacherously conquering the peaceful Bagori, ruler of Futa, in contrast to his victory (or in recompense for this victory) he took away from Partha the dominion of the
Tsutaruki. In either inscription Matori appears as the vanquisher,
in one case of tlie father, in the other of the son. In the Japanese annals Fegouri-no-Matori is represented as raising an insurrection against Bourets, and suffering death in consequence.^- In the history of Cashmere, he may be recognized as Matri-Gupta whom Kalhana places between 118 and 123 A.D.^^ The same errors

that pervade the Egyptian chronology of Manetho are f(jund in all these ancient histories, the importation of foreign names, and representation of contemporary dynasties as successive. But
what is even more important to note is the transportation of history from one scene of national existence to another. Possessing
documents setting forth the same traditions, the Indian historian connected them with Cashmere, and the Japanese annalist, with Japan, while the truthful monuments indicate that their scene was the lower waters of the Jumna. It would thus appear that the early history of Corea and Japan, and much of that of China, is imported tradition ; and, in the case of the former countries, of such a nature as to connect their populations with the Hittite
fugitives from India, and the Buddhist Khita of Siberia. It is
impossible to tell when Corea received its Hittite invaders, and
almost as hard to recognize in the names of its original tribes
Kaokiuli, Weime, Ouotsu, the elements of its population. As the
generic name of these tribes was Han, it is probable that the Hiong-nu, Yavanas, or Huns, were its first occupants, and the
Khitan proper, their successors. For the presence of the litter as a conquering people in Corea there is abundant historical
evidence. The chief Corean tribe was that of the Kaokiuli. In India its seat was doubtless Kosol or Kosala, which formed part of Oude and was famous in Buddhist story. In the older Hittite home in Armenia, Cozala was its habitat, and may be the place called Buna-Gislu by Shalmanezer, who thus associates the
Yavana name with that of its tribe."*^ The first Tiglath Pileser, in his enumeration of Hittite states, mentions that of Huzula, and
the Egy^ptian inscriptions furnish a Hittite name Kazel.*^ In Asia Minor, Gazelonitis of Pontus marks another abode of this tribe, and connects it with the Hunnic or Vannic name.*** The next stage in Hittite migration was Japan. The Japanese pretend to be descendants of the Chinese, and to have possessed an organized monarchy from 660 B.C.*" The first
pretence is invalidated by language; the second, by the fact that

an item in their history which is placed as late as 500 A.D. has been found to belong to India, and to have occurred two centuries
before the Christian era. According to their own accounts they were not the first occupants of their islands, being preceded by
the Yebis or Ainos. They make no mention in their history of the Khitan, but the reason is evident, as the Japanese word hito,
a man, like the Yeniseian khitt, denotes their IJittite origin. The
story that the eastern Hans sought i-efuge in Japan about 300 A.D. is confirmed by the Japanese name Nipon, in Chinese Jypen, the Indian Yavana. But the majority of the Japanese did not belong to this Hittite stock, for, while Nipon, or Nippon, denoted their country, Yamato was that of its most ancient district and the designation of the empire as well. The word Yama-to means " the mountain door," and was doubtless the term out of which the Hebrew and Assyrian writers made Hamath. Kat
soura was a famous place in the district of Yamato, and Ifori or
Kofori, the name of the original chief of that district, was
conferred upon its ancient capital. These three words Kofori,
Yamato, and Katsoura are the representatives in Japan of the Indian Sahara, Kambodja and Gandhara, names of related peoples who seem to have dwelt in Arachosia and Gedrosia, the modern Cabul and Candahar preserving two of them.*^ Professor
Rawlinson points out that Gadar is the original and true form of Gandhara. Besides the disguised form Kambodja, the Indians preserved the name Hamath or Yamato as Himav^at, denoting the Himalayas, but never used that word to designate a people. It
was of course borrowed from the Cathaei or Hittites by the Aryans. In mythology Himavat and Bharata are bi-othei-s, and in Syrian geography Berothai was the chief city of Hamath Zobah.*^ The Parthians represented the Bharatan branch of this race, and in their Gadar set forth Gamlhara, while their Sobidae commemorated Zobah. The Parthian name Tiri-Dates answers to the Hittite Giri-Dadi and Cigiri-Dadi, and is an inversion of Hadad-ezer, the name of a king of Berothai and Hamath Zobah. ^'^

A corresponding royal Japanese name is Zada-Akira borne by the tifty-seventh emperor, also called Yozeitenno, in the ninth century.^^ It has been said that tlie Japanese do not mention the
Khitan in their history. This is true, but they call their country, in addition to the two names already referred to, Akitsou-sima,
in which it is not li«rd to perceive the Khitan name.''
Is Japan the eastern limit of Hittite migration, or is it possible,
save in theory, to follow them across the Pacific to the shores of
America ? Japan is not the eastern limit, for historical documents
vouch for their migration. It is not worth while to o-ive
Japanese accounts of expelled tribes, lost navies, and pirates
driven to distant shores, for these accounts do not say where the
expatriated found land. The country of Fousang, once supposed to be part of America, seems to have been a region of fable.'^^ The only aboriginal histories proper of North America are those
of the Aztecs of Mexico and of the peoples of Yucatan and Guatimala. The grammatical forms of the Maya and Quiche, the
languages of the latter peoples are so distinctively non-Khitan
that it is useless for the present to consult the works written in them. The Aztec grammar, however, is accordant. The Mexican
histories bring the various tribes of Mexico into that land from the north, their wanderings leading them slowly southward
through a region of caverns, such as the canons of Colorado
contain, to the plain of Auahuac. ^* The Toltecs were the first to arrive, the year 721 A.D. marking the commencement of their era. They founded the two kingdoms of Culhuacan and Tollan, the former of which passed out of their possession in 1072, and
the latter, ten years before. After them ruled the Chichimecs of
many tribes ; and, towards the end of the thirteenth centurv, the Aztecs or Mexicans came into power, and continued to exercise
authority until the arrival of the Spaniards. All these tribes spoke one language and were of one race. Near the middle of
the eleventh century, a famous tribe, that of the Acolhua

Tepanecs, came into Mexico through Sonora from tlie cavern land of the north. The Chichimec king of Tenayocan received them hospitably, and, as a reconnnendation to his favour, they made known that they were descendants of the Citin, alike illustrious
by the nobility of their ra.ce and their heroic deeds. The Citin were the hares, " apparently the name of a northern tribe," says the Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg.^^ The Aztecs, or Mexicans, again we are told, bore the name Mecitin, which he translates as the
hares of the aloes, whatever that may mean.^^ Now in Japanese, Kitswne is a fox, and that sagacious animal was worshipped in special temples in Japan ; but the evidence of the Hittite monuments shows that the Japanese transferred namQ, and reverence from an orioinal hare to the most astute of creatures. The hieroglyphics of Hamath and Carchemish contain a conventional representation of a hare couchant which has the phonetic value ka, and among those of Merash, a well executed portrait of the animal is an ideograph with the phonetic value kata or keta.
Khatte and Khita may have been dialectic differences in Hittite pronunciation which the lapse of ages converted in the plural number to Citin. Hares and rabbits play a very important part in animal mythology. The armorial bearings also displayed upon the most ancient monuments of the Caucasus are hares. ^"^ Among the Yadavas of India we find a tribe called the Caeas or hares, along with the horse tribe Asvas, and the serpent tribe Nagas. The
connection of Ca(;a with Yadu, the head of the lunar race, in Sanscrit mythology, may account for the presence of the hare in the moon in colloquial Indian language instead of the man of our nursery rhymes.^* It is likely that the word Khita or Kata, which the Hebrew rendered by Heth or Cheth, originally meant a hare, the supposed sagacity of that animal making the name a
desirable one, as the Japanese kiten, clever, ingenious, seems to indicate. The two words Citin and Mecitin recall the Scythian Getaj and Massagetfe, and these, the Cheth and Maachath of the Bible. The Japanese family name Masakado, accompanied by

Tairano, is undoubtedly of the same origin as Massagetae.-''^ In the Punjab, Massaga is mentioned by Arrian as the capital of the Assaceni, while he appears to place the Massaget* farther to the north.'^^ The Indian writers know the Massagetas as the
Magadhas, and represent them as a branch of the Kshattriyas.''^ In very ancient times one of their seats was Magadha, a kingdom of note, generally supposed to have been in central Bahar. In Palestine they were the Maachathites on the north-eastern border, and, in the times of the Egyptian wars with the Hittites, their capital was Megiddo at the foot of the range of Carmel.
The Georgians belonged in part to this Hittite family, deriving themselves from Mtzkehtos, son of Kartli, son of Tai-gamos.^^ In
Piilestine the latter name survived in the form Trachonitis, which
replaced the ancient Maachah. A southern branch of this tribe
is placed in Elam by the Assyrian inscriptions, Madaktu, Durundasi, and Durundasima being among its memorials.^^ The Persian geographers assign to Turan the limits accorded to the Massagetse by the classical writers. If the connection of the Mexicans with the Hittite Maachathites be valid, it would seem that they should be embraced under the larger name Aztec, and the Aztecs, under the more generic Chichimec. The tribal termination ec is thoroughly Hittite. Who were the Chichimecs ? They were the Zuzim of Palestine, the Assacani or Assaceni of the Punjab, whose capital was Massaga, the Tsutemame of the Indian inscriptions. In Siberia the name does not appear with any prominence, but Uda, Mangaseia, and Turuchansk, all in the Yeni.sei country, attest that it should be found there. In Japan the eastern region of Atsouma and Satsouma, of which Yedo is the chief place continue the connection. For Aztec then Yedo and Uda are supposed to stand, the medial z representing an original breathing, similar to that in Turuchan as compared with Touran or Tirhan. In the

Caucasus the Lesghian Kasikumuk are a remnant of the Znzim or Chichimecs, and count among them the Udia and Mukakh. The Armenian historians speak of Udi as an ancient independent kingdom.^* The Assyrian Sargon tells how he carried into captivity the tribes of Gamgum the great, with the Gamgumian king Tarhulara, but neither he nor other Assyrian monarchs connect the Gamgumi with Uda, Yatu, and XJetas, which, however, they place in the same region.*^'' Samas Rimmon does not mention any of these, but enumei'ates the Asatai and Ustassai among Hittite tribes.^^ In Indian tradition Ayodj'a or Oude and Hastipura furnish the two forms of the name, the latter corresponding to the Tyrrhenian and Ligurian Hasta and Asta. The Acolhua Tepanecs, who, equally with the Chichim.ecs, claimed descent from the Citin, were, as Tepanecs, a branch of the Yavanas or PTuns, in the Assyrian form Diahbina, in other words, Japanese, and as Acolhuas, the Kaokiuli of Corea. As the Aztec rejects the letter r, the Toltecs must have been the same as the Indian Daradas dwelling on the Zaradrus and possessing LahoreAs Delhi was a dependency of Lahore, it may be the original of the Toltec Tollan or Tula. Durdukka is a Toltec-like form given to an older abode of the Daradas in Armenia by Sargon,
but Zirta, Surda, Surdira, are more common. These were Hittite Dardanians and towns named after them. The Pactyans of Herodotus came from Armenia and from India, the latter division from near Caspatyrus or Cashmere.^" In the Assyrian records the Lahiru are a tribe of the Pukudu, and in Europe the PeucetisB were an Illyrian tribe.^^ With their name are linked in geographical connection the Assyrian Pahalla, Indian Peucela or Puckholy, Chinese Pechili, and American Paxil.

applies to all the Mexican tribes, although the Nahuatl are distinguished from the Toltecs and Chichimecs. This word, containing a medial breathing, is capable of becoming Navatl on the one hand and Nacatl on the other. The Niquirians of Nicaragua are southern Nahuatl, adding the change of tl to r to
that of It into ^."° The place where the Nahuatl tirst lauded and formed a settlement in Mexico was Tabasco."^ The greatest of the
Hittite families, which the Assyrian, and, before them, the Egyptian inscriptions, held to represent the whole of the Hittite people, was that of the Assyi'ian Nairi and Egyptian Naharina.
Their capital was Khupuscai, the Thapsacus of the classical geographers and the Tiphsach of the Hebrews.''- In India the prefix
kliu or tha was lost, for the Pisachas represe;iited the Khupuscians. These Pisachas were always associated with the Rakshasas and the Nagas who were Nairritas."^ In the Caucasus the Circassian Abasci of Abasech and the Schapsuch preserved the Pasach name. An ancient document classifies the Etruscans of Italy in
the same category, making their tribal divisions Tusci, Naharci and Japusci ; and the Basques of the Pyrenees reproduce this nomenclature in their divisions of Navarre and Guipuscoa.'* In the Navarrese and Naharci, the Scythic Neuri of Herodotus may be found, as well as the Nahri of the Assyrians and the Nahuatl, Navatl, or Niquirians, of America."^ Yet another link in philo
logy binds the Mexicans to the Hittite race. Their learned men were Amoxoaques, so called, it is supposed, from the word arnox
a book.''** The Japanese original of amox is shomiotsu, the Loo Chooan shimutsi, a very old word, for in the Turanian Accadian of Chaldea it appears as swmuk, samuk, a library."" The
Amoxoaques were the scribes of the Aztecs. Now the literary class amonsf the Hittites were the Kenite scribes of Hamath. In

the travels of an Egyptian, Takar-Aar in Hamath is described as the all-assembling place of the Mohars or scribes.'* The different forms .samid-, shomotsu, amox are corruptions of the name Hamath, similar to the forms Hamaxia in Cilicia, Hamaxitus in the Troad, and Hamaxoeci in European Scythia. The latter were known to Herodotus as the Argippjei, a sacred tribe, the more ancient name Hamath being superseded by Rehob or Rechob. In the peculiarly Hamathite country of Japan the name Rechob survived as Sirakabe,*^^ The Indians retained it in the form

work of identical nomenclature can be fortuitous.
In the year 1062 A.D., Topiltzin Acxitl, the last king of
Tollan, disappeared, and, in the same year, died Manco Capac, the first king of Peru, who is said to have arrived in that country in 1021.*^ According to the Mexican historians, Acxitl and the Toltecs migrated southward and formed a new kingdom in the mysterious land of TIapallan. The first link that connects the
Peruvians with the Hittites is the name of their sci'ibes. They were called Amautas, and, looking for their work, it is found in the rock sculptures in the neighbourhood of Arequipa.^- Thus the names of Hamath and Rechob once more appear. Among royal names, Amauta, Yupanqui or Tupanqui, Apusqui, Huascar, Marasco, are purely Hittite.*'^ The royal title Inca gives back the Anakim, and, as lords of the four quarters, the}^ represented the rulers of Kirjath Arba in Palestine, of Kiprat Arba, supposed to denote Syria on the Assyrian monuments, of the original of the Kalmuk Derben Oertet, and of the Basque Laur Cantons.^*

and who were apparently of InJo-Scythic or Hittite clesceut.'=''' Although the Toltecs seem to have been the ruling race of Peru, the Inca name and Yunca dialect belonging apparently to them,
the Peruvian annals assign the first place to the Chichimecs, whose
name is represented by the great capital Cuzco and the purest ^'orm of Quichua speech, the Cusqueno. The Quiteno dialect spoken in tlie region of which Quito was the centre, retained the
generic name Khita, and another dialect, the Oalchaqui, corresponded to the Mexican tribe of the Chalcas and other Cilician forms.^*^ The title Inca is found in the LooChoo islands, whose
inhabitants speak a Japanese dialect. The royal fanjily bears the name Anzi, the name being applied to the monarch and to all that are of his race.'^'' A point of contact between the Toltecs and the Peruvians is presented in the name Huaman which, in the history of Peru, denotes a region, and, at the same time, is a
constituent in the titles of certain Incas.'^* In Mexican historx^ Hueman was the oreat leader of the Toltecs of Anahuac.^^ Now the people of Anaukas answering to Anahuac, Anzi, and Inca, are made Hittites by the Egyptian writers. In the account of the battle of Megiddo they are counted to the Rutennu, who are supposed to have dwelt on the Euphrates, along with the inhabitants of Junuma and Hurankala, and Assuru is intimately associated with them.^*' In the Assyrian inscriptions the Ruten or Rutennu are called the Nirdun and are associated with Kasyari.
To these countries belonged Anzi and Nirbu, the fortress of the
latter being Tila.-'^ It is evident that Kasyari originally denoted
Geshur which lay to the north of Palestine, east of the springs of the Jordan, and that that river derived its name from the
Rutennu or Nirduniui.*^- Hence the identification of Junuma
with Janoah b}^ the late Dr. Birch was correct. The uncommon name Talmai was borne by a king of Geshur and by a much

earlier man of renown, Talmai son of Anak and grandson of Arba, whose brothers were Sheshai and Ahiman.*^^ Ahiman is the name which the Mexican liistorians make Hueinan, and the Peruvian, Huaman. It also appeared among- the extinct Guanches of the Canary Islands as the eponym of the Achimenceys, and in Japan it, as Hachiman, denotes the god of war.^* The Geshurites in eastern migration became possessors of Gujerat in western India, the Saurashtra of the Sanscrit writers, and founded the Sah dynasty of that country. ^^ There is a remarkable likeness between the royal names of that dynasty on the one hand and those of the LooChooan Anzis and the Peruvian Incas.^^ Among the the Saurashtras, Sah was the chief name, occurring in the forms Rudra Sah, Sri Sah, Daman Sah, Visva Sah. The present dynasty of LooChoo is that of the Sio, among whom appear Sio Sio, Sio Fasi, Sio Sidats and Sio Kin. In Peruvian history are found Say Huacapar, Cayo Manco, Cayo Manco Capac. Another Sah name is Sinha as in Rudra Sinha, Visva Sinha and Sangha Daman. The LooChooan equivalent is Soun as in Soun Teno, Soun Basinki, and the Peruvian, Sinchi, as in Sinchi Cozque, Sinchi Apuzqui, Sinchi Ayar Manco and Sinchi Rocca. Jaya and Vijaya in the Sah names, Jaya Dama and Vijaya Sah, correspond to the Loo Chooan Yei, in Yei So, Yei Si, and to the Peruvian Aya and Ayay, in Aya Tarco Cupo and Ayay Manco. Tame Tomo is made the founder of sovereignty in LooChoo. Among the kings of Saurashtra, Dama and Daman appear as in Java Dama, Jiva Dama, Rudra Daman, Daman Sah, Yasa Daman, Vira Daman, Asa Daman, Atri Daman. In Peru the name Tomo or Dama was changed to Topa, the four founders of its monai'chy being Ayai- Manco Topa, Ayar Cachi Topa, Ayai- Auca Topa, and Ayar Uchu Topa. Other Topas are Topa Capac, Topa Yupanqui, Ilia Topa, Hnancar Sacri Topa, Topa Curi, Tllac Topa Capac, Sivi Topa, and Huayni Topa. The remaining names characteristic of of the Sah kings are Sri, as in Sri Sah and Damajata Sri, and

In the Peruvian annals Sri may be represented by Curi, as in Topa Curi Amauta, while Data survives in Titu, as in Titu Capac Yupanqui, Huascar Titu, Quispi Titu, Titu Capac, Huica Titu, Huapa Titu Auqui and many more. The history of Japan places the exile of Tame Tomo, the founder of monarchy in LooChoo, in the year 1156 A.D., and gives as the cause of his banishment, his rising in arms to restore to the empire of Japan, Siutok, who had been virtually deposed in 1142. At the same time the ex-emperor and large numbers of his adherents were sent into exile.''^ It is more than probable therefore that the Sio dynasty of LooChoo is the line of Siutok son of Toba, and that the time of its commencement is some hundreds of years earlier than the date assigned by the Japanese
historians. If this expulsion sent the Toltecs to America as well as the Sios to LooChoo, it must have occurred not later than the seventh century. Tame Tomo belonged to the family of Minamoto which the emperor Sagateno is said to have created by bestowing the name upon his four daughters in the year 814 A.D.^^ The name Minamoto is found however in an ancient Lat inscription from Mathura in India, but as the inscription is fragmentary, it may be a mere complimentary epithet of Buddha.^^ With Sagateno have already been compared Sheketang one of the earliest and greatest monarchs of the Khitan or Liao dynasty of China, in the beginning of the tenth century, and Sakata of the Siberian monuments who is placed by reference to the death of Gautama Buddha between the fourth and fifth centuries. The Japanese name Minamoto with its suggestion of matriarchy may be represented in part by the Peruvian Mayta, as in Inca Mayta Capac, Usca Mayta, Apu Mayta, Mayta Yupanqui, Huallpa Mayta.^*^^ Huallpa is probably the Peruvian
form of Arba, as it is a name specially indentified with the Incas or Anakim. As the Aztec tl generally represents the r of other languages of the same family, Tlapallan, the Mexican name of Peru, would correspond to the Arbelas of the Old World, which appear to consist of the Hittite Arba and a,n increment.

28 THE HITTITES.
The conclusion to which this mass of Hittite nomenclature^ vouched for in its various relations by historical monuments and
documents in Egypt, Palestine, Assyria, Persia, India, Siberia, Corea, Japan, the LooChoo Islands, Mexico and Peru, naturally leads is that the ancient Hittite language, in its different dialectsin Syria and Mespotamia, was the parent of the languages spoken by the Turan of the Persians, the Indo Scyths of Hindostan, the Yeniseians of Siberia, the Khitan of the Chinese, the Goreans, Japanese and LooChooans, and by the Mexicans and Peruvians of America. To set forth all the evidence that could be adduced in support of that already given would be to tax unnecessarily the patience of the reader and to anticipate infor
mation which the sequel will furnish in its historical and logical connection.
Professor Sayce has been quoted as an authority for recognizing in the Georgians of the Gaucasus, the Hittite* type. Besides the Georgians the inhabitants of the Gaucasus are Ossetes, Lesghians,Mizjejians and Gircassians. Already Georgian tradition has furnished the ancestral name Mtzkhethos in company with those of Kartli and Thargamos. Mtzkhethos the seat of whose empire was Mzkheti evidently represents an eponymous hero of the Maachathites. So does the Circassian demigod Mesitcha, and the Circassian district of Machothi. The classical geographers
knew these Circassian Maachathites as the Maeotse. Assur-nazir
pal calls them the Mattiyati, and places them in the vicinity of
Commagene and the laud of Yatu.^^^ The men of Yatu constituted the Ude kingdom of which Berdaa, now Wartashin was the capital. Their feeble remnant is classed along with the Mukakh among the Kasi Kumuk tribes of the Lesghians. In the time of the As.syrian Sargon, Buritis, which he calls Bit Buritis, was the capital of Ambai'is king of Tabal and Colchis.^*'- The name Tabal survives in Tibilisi or Tiflis of the Georoians, and has been
recognized in that of the Tibareni of Pontus. Buritis must have been a conquest of Ambaris, for neither Tabal nor the Georgians as a whole belonged to the Zuzimite tribe represented by
'"• Records of the Past, vol. iii. p)). .50, seq. i"2 Records of the Past, vol. vii. p. 37.



THE WORK OF DECIPHERMENT. 29
Maachah, Ude, Buritis and Thargamos. The Georgian connection is found in the names of the twin rivers Cyrus and Araxes. Araxes, Arxata, Arsesa, Arsissa and similar Armenian names denote the presence in that country in ancient times of the
Biblical Eosh always united with Meshech and Tubal.^**^ The
Assyrian inscriptions place one branch of the Rosh in the vicinity of Elam, calling it by the two names Rassu and Ma Rusu. The northern Rosh they present in disguise as the people of Varutsa,
Varkasi or Markasi.^°* These three different names equally denote that Merash, the ancient Marasia, from which came the stone
lion on which one of the principal Hittite inscriptions is foundIt lies in the angle formed by Cappadocia, Cilicia and the Syrian Cyrrhestica. Its Palestinian original was Mareshah.^"^ The first Tiglath Pileser places Varutsa in Kharia, by which Cyrrhestica is evidently meant. In the time of Sargon the land of the Rosh had been conquered by the Zuzim, for that Assyrian monarch tells how he led into captivity the tribes of Gamgum whose capital was Markas or Varkasi. Professor Sayce in his Hittite map, sets
the Gamgumi down in the vicinity of Merash.^*'*' This conquest accounts for the indroduction of the Zuzim traditions into Georgian history. The Syrian Cyrrhus and Cyrrhestica named from it connect with Marasia as the more northern Cyrus does with Araxes. The Assyrian records preserve the former name as Khirki and connect it with Subariya, a form of the Iberian name anciently given to and still claimed by the Georgians. ^'^' The Iberian name, allowed to be Turanian, whether as the national designation of the Georgians, that of the Lesghian Avars, or of the non- Aryan peoples of southern Gaul and Spain, is thoroughly Hittite, and is of great value in following the Khitan
in their western inio-rations.
Like the Georgians, the other non-Tartar tribes of the
Caucasus are of Hittite descent ; like them also they repre
sent no one original Hittite family, but the remnants of many

different families. To attempt to set these forth with any degree
of completeness, would be to anticipate Hittite history and unnecessarily to plunge the unprepared reader into an abyss of geographical' names, tribal wanderings, and family connections, such as would stifle any interest he might feel in pursuing the
subject. Let it suffice to say that the Lesghians of many tribes have displaced the ancient Albanians, the lUipi of the Assyrians, who are now partially represented by the Ossetes farther to the north; the Georgians are the decendants in part of the old Iberians ;. and the Circassians, among whom some of the progeny of the Colchians still dwell, count among them the Schapsuch and other
tribes of a different Hittite ancestry. All, however, are Hittites,
as their dialects, customs, and relationship to the tribes of Hittites
mentioned by the Assyrians, fully attest. The languages of the Caucasus may therefore be legitimately made use of in translating
the Hittite inscriptions so soon as the phonetic values of their hieroglyphics are known and these are transliterated into modern speech notation. The somewhat allied Ugrian dialects spoken by the Majiars, Finns, Lapps and other Turanians of northern Europe have been employed in translating the Akkadian or old Turanian language of Chaldea. It was a branch of ancient Hittite speech, so that it is allowable to seek the aid of the Ugrian dialects in
interpreting Hittite generally, j^et there is much diversity between these dialects and those of the Caucasus. The nearest language in point of vocabulary, and to a certain extent in grammatical structure, to the Caucasian which Europe presents is the Basque of the Pyrenees. Of the same nature, although necessarily
more archaic, are the dialects of Spain and Ital}^ known as the Celt
Iberian and Etruscan. In the Umbrian tables of the Eugubine inscriptions the Etruscans are said to have consisted of three divisions, the Tuscer, Naharcer, and Japuscer. The Tusci represent in the west the Tuslm of the Caucasus and the Hittite people of Tuskha mentioned by the As.syrians. The Naharcer or Naharci are the Hittite Nairi or Naharina of Mespotamia, in westward migration, and in the Basque country are represented by the Navarrese. The Japusci in the east were the men of Khupuscia or Hupu.scia, the Thapsacus of the Greeks, and the ruling tribe of the Nairi ; in the Caucasus they have left the Schapsuch or



THE WORK OF DECIPHERMENT. 31
Chapsoukes ; and into the Pyrenees they have sent the Guipuscoans. Ahnost all the Hittite names are Basque. The Albanians,
or Illipi, are the people of Alava, in Biseaj^ With Illipi, the men of
Allapur are associated by the Assyi-ians, and from them the Lapurtans of the Labourd have their name. The Alai'odians live again in Oleron, and in the ancient Ilergetes and Ilercaones. The Basque Iturgoyen answers to the Assyro Hittite Aturgina, Ripalda, to Rabilu and to the Roplutae of Arachosia, Urkheta to Urikatu, Arrast to Arazitku, Arbona and Arboti to Arbanun and
Aribue, Algoi-riz and Licarraga to Algariga, Turillas to Taurlai, Equisoain and Orisoain to Ahi Zuhina and Ar Zuhina, Alzania to Elisansu, Tardets to Tsaradavas, Lakharre to Lakhiru, Arias to
Karalla, Mugueta to Massut, Besolla to Pahalla, Oloriz to Alluria, Garinoain to Hurunaya, Soracoiz to Surgadia, Izturitz to Istarat, Bassussary to Patusarra, Barcoche to Perukhuz, Bidarray to Paddira, Charricota to Saragitu, Khambo to Khumbi, Arronce to Arranzi.^'*^ These are but a few of the more prominent coincidences between the geographical nomenclature of the Basques and that of the Hittites. The Iberian wave passed northward into the British Islands, but the remains of the language it carried
thither are only to be found in runic inscriptions that have so far been uninterestingly and ungrammatically translated Ijy the
aid of the Norse staff. They are therefore useless as mate
rials for the determination of the parent Hittite.^*^^ The best known and least corrupted Hittite languages of the present day, leaving America out of account, are the Basque of the Pyrenees and the distant Japanese in eastern Asia. If these languages fail to make plain the sense of the monuments, it may be conceded that the Hittite tongue is a dead language without a
resurrection. The wide extent of Hittite empire forbids the indulgence of any such fear, and offers in the Old World and the New more than a hundred dialects as keys to unlock the secret of the written monuments so .soon as the hieroglyphics shall be converted into sounds.
los All of the above mentioned tribes and places are to be found in the Assyrian inscriptions translated in the Records of the Past.

CHAPTER III.
The Work of Decipherment. —The Hittite Characters.
There are but three pui-ely hieroglyphic systems of writing
extant, the Egyptian, the Hittite, and the Aztec. There are indications which point to a hieroglyphic origin of the most
ancient cuneiform characters, and of the Chinese signs.^ The characters of Y.ucatan and Guatimala and those of Easter Island seem to be conventional renderings of original hieroglyphics On comparing the Hittite hieroglyphics with those of Egypt, many
correspondences appear : the eagle, fish, hare, leg, hand, arm, eye, axe, and cross, are found in both, but the two systems viewed as wholes are irreconcilable. The vast distance in space between the Hittites and the Aztecs has been bridged over by history of
a very definite character : but the difli'erence in time is enormous. The Hittite inscriptions go back beyond the eighth century B.C., while the Aztec writings are not many centuries older than the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1520. A casual glance at the two
systems does not show relationship of a close order. The eagle,
fish, hare, leg, hand, arm, eye, axe, and cross, are still found, but these are common to the Egyptian and the Hittite. A community of animal signs cannot be expected, because the faunas of the two
regions are distinct. But the Hittite tree is Aztec, and the shield
like oval, so characteristic of Hittite inscriptions ; the house, the
flower, the bean, the human face, the tongue, the teeth, the bon
netted head, the .shoe, the knife, the bow, the bee, the animal's
head, are all Aztec as well as Hittite. The Aztec hieroglyphics
possess the phonetic value of the first syllable, consisting of two
letters, of the names of the objects they designate. They were employed by the Spanish priests to teach their converts to repeat

the Pater Noster and other prayers.^ Thus a house being calli,
the hieroglypliic of a house has the phonetic value ca, a leg,
metzli, that of me, a shoe cactli, that of ca, a fish michin that of
TYii, a tongue, nenepilli, that of ne, a tree, quahuitl, that of qua,
an eye, ixtli, that of ix or ish. Seeing that the Aztecs are of Hittite ancestry, there is no reason why the phonetic values of their hieroglyphics should not be applied to the Hittite characters
of Syria ; but the induction is too partial to satisfy the scientific investigator who demands sure ground for his process of transliteration. There are some semi-hieroglyphic characters in a Mound Builder inscription from Davenport, Iowa, and in the Siberian inscriptions from the Yenisei, but they must be read from the Hittite, not the Hittite from them.^ Nevertheless they present links in the chain that connects the hieroglyphics of
Syria with those of Mexico. There are also several systems of writing that have either not
been interpreted at all or have been interpreted in an illogical
,
unscientific, and alltogether unsatisfactory manner. Such are the Phrygian and Lycian inscriptions of that peculiarly Hittite region,
Asia Minor, those of Etruria, Celt-Iberia, and Pictish Britain. In
the east there are the Parthian on coins, the Lat Indian, so
called because chiefly found upon lats or pillars erected by Buddhists over their relics, those of Siberia, and the ancient documents of Japan. The characters of the last are very similar to the present Corean, and the Japanese generally agree that the Corean alphabet was introduced to that country by the Japanese at an early date.* The Japanese now use and have used for many
centuries modified Chinese characters, and Chinese influence, datinar from old Khitan davs, has done much to obscure the ethnic relations of the Japanese. The only purely Hittite alpha
bet, the value of whose characters is known, is the Corean.^ As the Coreans retain to the present day the tip-tilted Hittite boot.

34 THE HITTITES.
SO they keep their old mode of speech notation/^ Yet it is no easy matter to perceive its connection with the Hittite hieroglyph
ics. Of its fifteen characters only six can in a general way be connected ; this however furnishes a good beginning. The Aztec
shield-like oval or circle corresponding to the Hittite, has the phonetic value ma, for in some mysterious way it denotes the
number 10 huitlactli. This number is also denoted by an insci'ibed square as well as by a circle. The Corean square or parallelogram, has the phonetic value m. The Corean syllable le is represented by a bisected parallelogram. In Aztec the bisected parallelogram, which is horizontal, while the Corean is perpendicular, denotes
cultivated ground, and gives tla from tlalli, the earth. A compai'ison of Aztec with other Khitan languages shows that its tla represents la. or ra. Thus tlalli answers to the Basque lurra and Lesghian ra.fl. Other Khitan forms drop one of the liquids for euphony's sake, as the Georgian lete, leta, Mizjejian latte, Lesghian
luchti, Circassian tula, tzida, tsliullaJi, Corean chulu, Peruvian lacca, lacta. Another Corean character with the phonetic value 2) is like that for le, without the enclosing upper horizontal line :
it is, therefore, like a capital H with a line drawn across the base. The Aztecs have a similar character representing a box open at the
top, or pot or other article capable of holding contents. Its value is pa, which has been supposed to come from palli, black colour, but which has been shown to mean rather inclosure or contents, as in the word tenxi-palli, the lip, as compared with the Japanese
kuchi-biru, and the Circassian oku-fari, meaning that which encloses the mouth.''' The Aztec unclothed foot has the value sho from xotl, the foot, and this the Corean represents by a short line drawn at an angle of 30° from the centre of a longer semi
perpendicular one, the former representing the instep or upper
'' For this characteristic boot see Hall's Account of a Voyage of Discovery to the
West coast of Corea and the great LooChoo Island, i)late facing p. 1(5, representing a
Corean chief ; also Belcher's Voyage of H. M. S. Samarang, vol. i., plate facing p. 353,
representing a Corean chief. Profes.sor Sayce remarks in regard to the Hittite boots that
they " are always represented with turned uj) toes, like the boots of the mountaineers
of Asia Minor anfl Greece at the present day. Boots of the same form characterize some
of the female figures on the tomb of the Harpies fotiiid at Xanthos in Lycia, as well as
the Annenian inhabitants of Muzri on the Black Obelisk, and the P^truscans of Italy.
Mr. Spiegelthal ha.^ seen an archaic marble base of a statue at Ejjhesus on which there
were figures with the same kind of shoes. " Trans. Soc. Bib. Archseol., vol. vii. p. 252. 7 The Khitan Languages ; the Aztec and its connections, p. 20.



THE HITTITE CHARACTERS. 3o
outline of the foot ; its value is 6'. The Aztec arm, neitl, gives ne, and n in Corean is a perpendicular line with another vanishing stroke ascending from its base at an angle of S()\ like an arm bent
at the elbow. Finally k in Corean is like the same chai'acter turned upside down, resembling a South Sea cassetete. This does not accord with the Aztec, which gives the phonetic value shi to all cutting and wounding weapons. This, therefore, may be, and will yet be proved to be, a case in which the Corean is right and the Aztec is wrong. A little confirmation has thus been found, but hardly enough to proceed upon. The unknown must be interpreted by the known, or, at any rate, a commencement must be made with what is known, and the sphere of inference narrowed to the smallest possible limits. No other form of Hittite writing has been read, but Professor Sayce once held and subsequently reiterated the opinion that the
syllabic characters of the Cypriote inscriptions, brought prominently into view since the Br-itish occupation of Cyprus, were
related to the Hittite hieroglyphics, as the Semitic characters are to the Egyptian. He published a tentative comparison of characters exhibiting manj^ analogies. The Cj'pviote language is
found to be a Greek dialect, through the medium of bilingual Phosnician and Cypriote inscriptions, but its alphabet or syllabary is very far from Hellenic.'' That Cyprus was occupied originally
by Hittites there is abundant evidence, apart altogether from its
city Citium. The Cypriote characters have all their analogies
with those of Asia Minor, Etruria, and Celt-Iberia, on the one hand, and, on the other, with the Lat Indian and Siberian. There is thus presumptive evidence of their Hittite origin. Looking for
the square or shield-like oval identified in Aztec and Corean, it appears in Cyprus as a circle, parallelogram, or genuine shield,
with the phonetic value 9ho : this definitely restricts the character's meaning to a power of m. The Corean and Aztec bisected parallelogram, le or tla, is in Cypriote two superposed round or triangular compartments, the former like the figure 8 ; and its value is, like the Corean, le. The Corean and Aztec p and pa,

the enclosure, box, or pot, is represented in Cypriote by a semicircular or angular enclosure like a U or V standing upon a horizontal base line, with the value bu, or by two V's set one above the other, like the beginning of a nest of boxes, with the value hi. One of the Cypriote equivalents of sa is like a V, one
of the lines of which is shorter than the other : it is thus more like the Corean n than its s, but on comparison with other alphabets of Hittite origin, it appears that the foot was more generally represented by an ascending than by a descending line, the former representing the sole rather than the instep, and
following the upward trend of the Hittite boot. The Pictish sa is the only one that follows the Corean order in the west. Neither ne nor ka are accordant in Cypriote : yet the Cypriote and Corean may be held as furnishing evidence that the Aztecs were possessed of at least part of the Hittite hieroglyphic system. Comparing now the Cypriote with the Hittite, we find the former representing the yoke-like hieroglyphic of the latter by a
ruder but similar character, possessing the phonetic values re and
ro. This yoke is really a bow, and is the Aztec tlaoitolli, a bow, with phonetic value tla, representing an original oxt or la. The
Koriak form of tlaoitolli is r<itla. The Hittite perpendicular line with a dot on either side is represented in Cypriote by a straight or doubly curved line with a short line on either side: its phonetic value is ne. On the stone bowl from Babylon there is a character somewhat like a Greek lambda with three wedges on its back ; the facsimile of this in Cypriote is iii. The Hittite two peaked mountain is represented in Cyprus by a spreading limbed M with a line drawn along the centre of its base, and its value is mi, which the Basque mendi, Georgian mta, a mountain,
would lead one to expect. A Cypriote character like the eye is si, answering to the Aztec ish. Another form like the letter C, generally in composition, which is common in Hittite, and
corresponds to the Aztec chi, from chichi, the breast and lungs, is in C3'priote su, xe, xa. The Cypriote ko, go, looks like a Hebrew cheth, or child's rude drawing of a house ; there are many house
forms like the Aztec in the Hittite inscriptions, to which we may thus venture to give the Aztec value ca, from calli, a house. Another Cypriote character resembles the Hebrew shin, which

originally meant the teeth : in Cypriote, however, its value is te, which agrees with the Aztec representation of the teeth, whose value is ti from titlan. Another link, which also binds in a
measure the Semitic and Hittite alphabets, is the Cypriote F-like character, which, in old Semitic, was a form of aleph, the ox, represented by his head. Its Cypriote value is to and it closely resembles the Corean /, In Aztec the animal's head is that of the
rabbit, and its value is to. From these various sources, the Aztec, Corean, Cypriote, a foundation for work is furnished, and we are
not left to mere conjecture, as were Professor Grotefend and Sir Henry Rawlinson in the decipherment of the Achsemenian
Persian.^" These illustrious scholars had no single value of any cuneiform character given them, and yet arrived at definite
scientific results. Suppose that the enquirer begins with nothing but the value of the shield, which Cypriote, Corean, and Aztec declare to be a power of m, and for convenience sake calls it ma. He has before him several inscriptions from Hamath, and it is reasonable to think that the name of that city appears somewhere in them.
He looks then for ma, the shield, tentatively, as a possible ingredient in the word Hamath. It is not to be found in Hamath
i,. ii. or iv. : but it is abundant in iii. and v. In Hamath iii. he
sees the shield forming the first character of a group of ten hieroglyphics. It is followed on the left by a basket, value un
known, that by an object that might be a carrot, also of unknown phonetic value ; then comes another ma, and immediately below, for the line ends here, another basket. He turns to H. v. There, on the right hand of the second line, is another group. Before the shield iiuc is an unmistakable bean. In Aztec a bean is etl, and its phonetic value is that of a vowel. Immediately below in line 3, is a similar group. That which precedes the ma in
this case, is an indefinable figure like the Aztec symbol for water,
aAl, having simple vowel power. It is plain from the multiplicity
of Hittite characters that the Hittites denoted the same sound
by different signs, as did the Mexicans. In Aztec etl, the bean,
often had the value euh, and atl, that of auh. The carrot-like

character of H. iii. may be also a vowel, or a breathing, such as that with which the Semitic form Hamath, and the Japanese Yamato would begin. If so, and if the student really has Hamath in these three groups, the basket, which in every case is under the shield, must be the Semitic th, or the Japanese to. But the basket is not to in Aztec, nor can any good reason be given why the basket should be to or any power of t. Turning to Jerabis i. and iii., not with
out the assistance of Professor Sayce, he finds in the second line of each inscription the basket represented by its handle only : and such a handle with a straight line descending from, but not joined
to it is, in Cypriote, ti}'^ The Cypriote perpendicular line is thus a linear expedient for the body of the basket, like the linear men made by boj's and savages. Now the investigator is at liberty
to remember that the LooChooans call a basket tiru and that the Iroquois word for it is atere. Somewhere between ti and to
therefore, lies the phonetic value of the basket. The explorer finds that while the group Hamati, or Hamato, nowhere else appears, the main part of it, namely mati or ^nato, is of constant
occurrence ; it is therefore, no local term. It is in the 1st line
of H. iii., in the 3rd of H. v., in the 2nd and 4th of J. i. in the
4th of J. iii., and on the Babylonian stone bowl. Also in J. i. the shield may be replaced by the Phrygian bonnet, in lines 2,
and 5, and in J. iii. by a fish in line 2, each of these being followed by the basket handle. The Phrygian bonnet is not Aztec, but the fish is, having the value vii from miehin, a
fish. The Lesghian has inuchol as w^ell as rtiigul for fish, and in America there is a Shoshonese form miughat, and a Dacotah
nivia. It is premature, therefore, to decide that the fish, which is abundant in Lat Indian and Siberian, has the phonetic value wi, although there can be no doubt that it is a power of m. Thus emboldened, the explorer proceeds to seek for definite
results. He finds his character ma in two allied groups in J. iii.,
being the last but one in each. Before it, in each case, is an eagle, which is quu or ha in Aztec, from quauhtli, an eagle, and suggests that the Latin aquila may be Hittite. After ma comes an inscribed diamond. In the old Semitic alphabets a diamond as
1' TranH. Soc. Bib. Archaol., vol. vii. p. 303.



THE HITTITE CHARACTERS. 39
well as a circle represented the letter ayin, which means an eye.
If disposed to rationalize philologically, he may find many Hittite words for eye in the Basque. Caucasian, and northern Asiatic
languages. But if satisfied to give the first trial to the Aztec, he
will accept ish, the initial syllable of ixtU. If successful so far,
the result is hamaish ; and it is a coincidence that the inscription comes from Jerabis on the site of the ancient Carchemish. In the first line the eagle is preceded by the yoke or bow, which the
Cypriote has determined as re or I'o, the Aztec, as tla or ra. In
line 5, the place of the bow is taken by a character of uncertain
signification, rare save in the Merash inscription. If the two groups denote the same word, this boomerang-like character
must also furnish ra, or at least a power of r. The bow, of line 1, is preceded by a parallelogram inscribed with two C-like characters back to back, and its equivalent in line 5 is a human
head on a curved support. There is no explanation of either of
these in Cypriote, Corean, or Aztec, save that Aztec has a somewhat similar form to the first with the phonetic value shi, evidently out of place here ; for having already found rakainaish, the first syllable should be some power of k, furnishing Karakamaish, or Kerakamaish, inasmuch as the Egyptian inscriptions call the great Hittite capital Kairkamasha.^^ The epigrapher has
not read the groups with certainty, for three values are inferential
and demand confirmation. The eagle occurs twice in J. i. In line 2 it is preceded by an oval expedient for the eye instead of the diamond, and is followed by the bow ; in line 4 it is also preceded by the eye oval, but is followed by a well defined arm. Now, according to the harmony of the Aztec and Corean, the phonetic equivalent of the arm is ne ; but Ishkane aflfords no knowledge, even though preceded by the shield and basket mati or mato. But Ishkara thus preceded
in line 2 suggests, as appearing in an inscription from Carchemish, Sagara, who was the king of that city in the time of Shalmanezer of Assyria ; what then is more natural by way of inference than that the preceding mati, mato should mean king or lord ? It stands in front of royal groups in H. iii., line 1, H. v., line 3, and
12 Records of the Past, vol. ii. p. 67.



40 THE HITTITES.
on the stone bowl, as well as here. Here is the difficulty however; the word mata does not denote a king in any known language of the Khitan. The Georgian raephe is king, and the Japanese and Choctaw^-Maskoki Tniko means prince in the former and king in the latter language. But the Japanese mikado denotes an emperor, and, on analysis, yields mi honourable, and kado, door, so that the vxikado is the Sublime Porte. The ancient Japanese word for door w^as not kado but do or to ; hence in the Indian and Siberian monuments king or emperor is inito or mita, corresponding in a measure to the ^nato of the Hittite. If the groups read as Hamath be rendered in the Japanese form, Yamato, the Avord for king will be this mato, for its hieroglyphic forms correspond to the two last syllables of Yamato. Returning now
to J. iii, the shield appears in the beginning of line 5, followed by the line and dots which the Cypriote calls 7ie, giving mane. Then comes a kind of cross, which looks like an expedient to represent a winged insect. Try the Aztec xicon, a bee, which
yields shi. Here, therefore, is a possible maneshi followed by ra, the bow, which makes it maneshira. Another group towards the end of line 2 has the leg, m.etztli in Aztec, furnishing me, the head with protruding tongue, nenepilli or ne, the face, xayacatl or sha. ; in all, menesha. Then comes a horned animal, and as the ancient Mexicans had no such creature in their hieroglyphic system, night falls on the explorer. Still he will not give up the
search. Preceding the leg is a cruciform object like a cross
handled sword, and, below it, a bisected circle ; just as before
the shield of line 5 is an indescribable figure that seems elsewhere
represented by two lines united at the base and gradually diverging above ; below it, is the same bisected circle. Unfortunately all the symbols of the Hittites do not bear public explanation, for they were a naturalistic and even unclean people in Asia and in America ; but there are good reasons for connecting the latter symbol with the Aztec bisected parallelogram tla and the Corean le, which in most Hittite monuments is represented by the
figure 8. The character which precedes it in line 5 is tlie original of the Cypriote .sa, the V with limbs of unequal length. Thus he has found in one case salameneshira, and in the other, lamenesha. Supposing the cross to be the e(|uivalent of the initial sa



THE HITTITE CHARACTERS. 41
of line 5, and at the same time, to be analogous to the differently
fomied cross in that group, the transliterator arrives at Sa or Shi-lamenesha. Then, to complete the group, the horned head must be a ?•«, the equivalent of the bow. This is probable, as the Basque ari means a ram. There is inconsistency in vowel values, but in both groups the name set forth is that of the Assyrian Shalmanezer as Salamanesare. The student is now in a position to attempt the reading of the
entire group in H. iii., in which the name of Hamath appears.
The shield and basket give inato ; the vegetable-like character,
with the second shield and basket, hamato ; and to this the foot
is added to denote a particle or inflection. If a foot, it should be
sho from the Aztec ccotl, at any rate, s, from the Corean ; if, how
ever, it is a clothed foot, it may be ca from the Aztec cactli, a
shoe. The lower group, read from right to left, has the inscribed parallelogram, which was queried as ka or ke in Carchemish, then
the line and dots well deflned by the Cypriote as ne, an animal's
head, and finally the bisected circle la, le. In Aztec the com
monest animal's head is that of the rabbit, tochtli, and in Cypriote
the F corresponding to the Semitic aleph, the ox's head, has also the value to. Thus the name reads Kenetola. No such king of Hamath appears in the Assyrian records, Eniel being the nearest
to it which they contain. But among the Hittite Kings of the Lakai appear Khintiel and Aziel. Khintiel, therefore, must be the Assyrian rendering of this Kenetola, answering to the Lydian and Carian Candaules.^^ In the corresponding groups in H. v., the inscribed parallelogram is superseded, in that of line 2, by the tree, whose Aztec phonetic value is ka, from quahuitl, and, in that of line 3, by a club-like stake expanding above into a wedge with the point upwards. This may denote a rude idol or a weapon of some kind. If the former, it will correspond to the human head in J. iii., the phonetic value of which is ka or ke.
The ne, of line 3, is no longer the line and dots, but a phallic figure
of similar significance, only found on Hittite monuments proper. In line 2, this character is placed on a pedestal as an object of
worship, thus altering its phonetic value, and making it the equi
13 Herodotus, lib. i. c. 7 ; lib. vii. c. 98.



42 THE HITTITES.
valent of the animal's head, to. The character between it and the
tree is by a mistake of the copyist made the bisected circle instead of the line and dots. There have been found, therefore, three
different groups setting forth Kenetola or Khintiel, king of Hamath. To the inscribed parallelogram are thus added the tree and the image or weapon as k forms, the first character in Carchemish and in Kenetola. These k& are important finds, as they should aid in discovering the Khita or Hittite name. In H. iii. the first of them appears, followed by the basket and the line with dots. This combination first makes it clear that to is not the power of t indicated by the basket, for, however much it may suit wato and yainato, it is discordant in Kenetola and Keto : it is better, therefore, to regard the basket's phonetic value as ta. After Ketane comes a human figure with a hand pointing to the face, which seems from its position to be part of the word. As the hand, on comparison, is not found to be specially connected with the nose or the mouth, it seems to indicate the face, which in Aztec is xayacatl : hence phonetically it is sha or sa. The whole word Ketanesa is a compound one, and, were the Hittite an inflec
tional language, might be called a form of Hittite declension.
The fact is that all languages are inflectional, the only difference
in their inflection being that in some cases the modifying particles-,
forming declensions and conjugations, retain their integrity and
submit to analysis, while in others this integrity is lost, and the
compound words defy analysis ; to the first class the Hittite be
longs. Here Keta is the root or word proper. The historical name Khitan indicates that n was a plural ending, as in Aztec
which changes cit or citli in the plural into eitin. If the final sa be regarded as a genitive, the grammarian must betake himself for illustration to the Japanese, which has an old genitive particle tsu. Looking for further examples of inflection, the student turns
to H i. line 3. There the basket and line with dots are followed by a C form, which, according to Cypriote analogy, should give s or X with a vowel. In Aztec it has Ijeen found to yield chi from chichitl, breasts, lungs. The basket is preceded by a perpendicular line surmounted by a diagonal cross-piece from which a short limV) descends. According to the analogy of the Aztec this should



THE HITTITE CHARACTERS. 43
be pi from pil a suspended object." If so, the group should be read pitanesi, but the initial character has a competitor for the labial in a similar figure with a basal support of two horizontal lines. These characters, together with the phallic ones with and without the stand, are the confusing elements in Hittite epigraphy, and it is not until after long and patient investigation that the student finds that the base lines which convert the ne
of the latter into a ta, also change the former which yields ka, ke into ba, pa. The whole word, therefore, he must, by anticipation of his comparisons, set forth as Ketanesa, once more meaning, of
the Hittites. This word is followed b}^ a figure like an archaic
W, below which is a hatchet or cleaver. The ancient W is unmistakably the same as the superposed Vs of the Cypriote, whose value is hi, agreeing with the Corean and Aztec hieroglyphics of content, p and pa. The connection of the cleaver is found in Cypriote whose se represents it fairly well without the upper en
closing line. It only occurs again in some proper names in the Lion Inscription of Merash. Tentatively the word may be read Pisi.
In two places in H. ii, appears a crook, which, by the analog}^ of
the Aztec pil, should have labial value, and with it, in one case, to
the left,in the other, to the right,is the C form which has been found to be a power of s. In line 1 it is preceded by C and the bow, saixt, and in line 3 it is followed by the bow, preceded by a figure
that may be the trunk of the body. Its modifications in J. iii.
line 5, make it appear more like an altar or fireplace. If this
guess be a correct one, the word for fire should be initial in it, and
that is the Lesghian zi, za, zo, tzah, Mizjejian zie, dze, Basque and
old Japanese su. Here again, therefore, is read in the 3rd line,
as in the 1st, the same legend with inversion of parts, sara Pisi or Pisi sara. If this be a proper name, it is evident that sara is significant, and, looking to the Japanese and the Basque for explanation, the former furnishes ka-shira, and the latter buruzari, agin-t-sari, a captain or commander, while the Etruscan gives the simpler form sara or sari. The whole name Pisi-sari may thus be that of which the Assyrian scribes made Pisiris, and by which they designated a Hittite King of Carchemish. It follows that the group which precedes his name in H. i. line 3, should not be read Pitanesa, but Ketanesa, and, therefore, that



44 THE HITTITES.
the perpendicular with cross-bar and suspender should be interpreted by ke or ka, and not by pi. Pisiris was the contemporary of Eniel, whom the Assyrians give to represent Kenetala, or Khintiel of Hamath."
This last discovery furnishes the phonetic value of another hieroglyphic, for in H. iv, the fire-place is represented under the crook by a sort of anvil which must also be .su from the Basque sutegi, a forge, Japanese suhitsu, a hearth. One looks in vain
for the shield and basket to orive to Pisiris his title of
king, but, in front of his name in H. ii. line 3, appears an object not unlike a leaf, which on comparison with other forms, however, reveals itself as the Phrygian bonnet. It is repeated in
line 1, and in the second place it is evidently a word subject to declension, for it is followed by mesa, the line and dots and the anvil. Also in line 3 of H. i. it precedes Ketanesa. It is either a word of one syllable, or an ideograph, qualified by
Ketanesa which it governs. Now Pisiris was the suzerain of all the Hittite tribes, whether he be called emperor, king, lord, or
chief. There is every reason to believe that the bonnet, as asserted by Professor Sayce, equally with the obelisk, denotes royalty.^^ But already we have found the word for king to be mato, 7)i<tta. The obeli.sk appears in the beginning of H. iv., in
J. iii. lines 2 and 3, and it is the last figure in the brief
inscription of Tarriktimme. As a cap is a head piece, fnata might be a word for head, the Corean inaii, and Lesghian metheri, and thus be applied to one in authority, like chief from caput, and the German Hauptmann. As an obelisk, however, the sign of authority rather means exaltation, and is symbolized by a mountain, a summit. The Japanese rnoto means head in the
sense of beginning, princei:)^ : the Basque ineta denotes a pile, heap, and mendi, a mountain, which in Georgian is mta, and in Circassian, mezi. In America the word for king or chief-ruler is mountain. Thus in Aztec tcjictl is a mountain, and altepetl is a king ; so in Iroquois onontes, the mountain, makes onontiio, chief governor. This seems to have been the old Hittite terminology,

THE HITTITE CHABACTEES. 45
When, therefore, as m H. ii., two bonnets appear in succession, the latter followed by ne and sa, the plural and genitive particles, the whole yields mata mata-ne-sa, the king of kings. In H. i. line 4, there appears, with the same ideograph, mata Ketanesa king of the Hittites.
In H. ii. line 1, mata matanesa has been read from left to right, and sari Pisi, from right to left ; to complete the circuit of of the group, and thus reconcile divergent orders of reading by a complete boustrophedon furrow, the three characters above the crook, the bow, and the C must be read from left to right. The
first of these is the Phallic we; then follows the line of suspension
on a stand, which, if the Aztec is to be still trusted, must give a
power of b, p. After this come two roughly executed feet, more like carpenters' squares than anything else, and, between them, an arm. The foot has been well determined as sa, the arm as ne : thus the compound third character gives sanesa, of which nesa is the genitive plural. There remains nebasa. The investigator has reached fairly solid ground as far as consonants are con
cerned, but he is not sure, doubts if he ever will be sure, of his vowels. The words may be nabasa, nabusi, nobesu, but n, b and s are there, and something may be made of it, even if he pronounc^ it, as the Arabs would, nebese. The following term is sari or
zari, the captain, which governs nebese in the genitive. Of what
or of whom is Pisi the Captain ? In Basque nabivsi, nausi, nagusi, denotes dovvinus, a master or lord. In modern Japanese it is nushi, lilve the Basque nausi, but which must have been originally nafushi. The root appears in the Aztec pachoa, to rule, govern, whence comes tepacho, a ruler. Thus Pisi is nabusine-sa-zari, the captain of rulers, as well as the king of kinos :
and this captain of rulers is the equivalent of the Biblical lord
of lords. The language of his inscriptions also appears to be
fairly indentified with the Basque. The genitive plural is found
in many of the inscriptions. In J. i. line 3, it occurs with the ox head and the basket, which are followed by the line and dots and the diverging s form found in the name of Shalmanezer in J. iii. As the Aztecs had no oxen, their hieroglyphic system fur
nishes no material for intepretation : hence its value must be determined by the context in which it appears in J. iii. lines 2,



46 THE HITTITES.
and 5. These define its value as ka, he : here again, therefore,
is Ketanesa, of the Hittites. In the Merash inscription, side, line
3, to the right of the hare is the ra figui'e found in the second Carchemish of J. iii., followed by C accompanied with a stroke which must affect somewhat its 8 value, by the arm, ne, and by another I C ; this is Rasa-ne-sa, of the Rosh, who gave their name to Marasia or Merash. At the end of the line near the lion's neck, the symbols are repeated, the commoner bow taking the place of the variant ra. The Babylonian inscription furnishes a mata or king, followed by the shield or target, the eye diamond, and a very crude representation of an eagle, altogether constituting the word Maishka,
which, if it be the name of a Hittite people, will denote the Moschi, whom Professor Sayce has ranked among the Hittites. The name of the king is composed of the basket, the bow, and and the house ; the last of which, according to the Aztec, is ca from calli. The king, therefore is called Taraka, a ver}^ common element in Hittite names, which appeai\s in Tharga-nnas, Thargathazas, Tarkhu-lara, Tarkhu-nazi, Tarkon-diniotus. Another
royal group in the same inscription consists of an uninscribed diamond before the basket, which may be a variant of the shield, like the Corean and Aztec parallelogram; two C's back to back the line and dots repeated ; something that looks like a tadpole
;
the anvil, the bow and the gallows. The values of all are known
with the exception of the tadpole, giving senna-tad'pole-saraba. Farthej-on, the word is repeated with variation, the C being this time accompanied by a stroke, and the anvil coming before the tadpole : the reading being sennasa-ta.d^o\e-raba. Unlike though the embryo batrachian is to the ox, whose dimensions its /E.sopian ancestor sought to emulate, that animal is evidently meant by the artist, and its phonetic value ke or hi makes the two groups yield Sennaksariba and Sennaskeriba, in plain Assyrian, Sennacherib. Is this confirmed? Between these two Sennacheribs comes another group of two C forms, the bow, a character like an old Hebrew shin, but really the Aztec representation
of a plant, or tree, with the value bi, the typical animal's head
lying horizontally, and a final ne. These constitute xasarakatane, the Hittite form of Esarhaddon, who was the son of Sennacherib.



THE HITTITE CHARACTERS. 47
Such then is an illustration of the tedious process hy which results have been arrived at, the main materials being furnished
by the Cypriote syllabary, the Corean alphabet, and last, but not by any means least, the Aztec hieroglyphic system. The latter is infinitely the most valuable aid, although without confirmation from the Corean and the Cypriote it could hardly appeal with confidence to the critical examiner. The Cypriote,
however, supplies many defects in the Aztec, and critical conjecture must occasionally step in to furnish what is lacking in all
the sources of information. By the plan adopted by Grotefend and Rawlinson, the decipherment of the Hittite inscriptions would
have. been an impossibility, as the scribes had so many dift'erent
characters at their command for denoting each syllable that they rarely represented words twice in the same manner ; the sibilants and gutturals are especially numerous and confusing. They had not arrived at conventional writing, but appear to have used any
object that occurred to their minds, the first syllable of which
denoted the sound they desired to express. Happily the ideographs are very few, those that appear such being often simple characters, and sometimes compound, the mechanism of which is at once apparent. Neither are there any determinative prefixes, as in Egyptian and cuneiform writing. An example of a compound character is the hand grasping a dagger, in which the hand is ma, from the Aztec niaitl, and the dagger, ka : the latter is justified by the Corean, whose k is a weapon. The Aztec needs to be watched in its vowel values, which are generally weaker than
the originals, and in its sibilants, which are many of them trans
formed gutturals: an example of the latter is Citin, derived from an orioinal Ketan.

CHAPTER IV.
The Bilingual Inscription.
The importance of bilingual inscriptions in the interpretation of the unknown has been apparent since Champollion compared the Greek and Egyptian hieroglyphic texts of the Rosetta stone. It by no means follows, however, that a bilingual document by its known language clears up the mystery of the unknown. At Limyra, Antiphellus, and other places in Lycia, inscriptions have been found in an ancient character naturally called Lycian, accompanied in each case with a Greek translation or paraphrase. Values have been assigned to the Lycian characters, and Lycian words have been spelled out and compared with their Greek equivalents, but no one who knows anything about languages imagines that the ancient speech of Lycia has thus been discovered.^ The words thus found, like those made out on Eti'uscan monuments and Celt Iberian coins, are irreconcilable with the vocabularies of known languages, and constitute as many new
and uncouth families of speech as there are classes of monuments.
In comparing the texts of bilingual inscriptions, proper names should furnish a starting point, as they did in Egyptian and cuneiform decipherment. Even in their case, however, caution is necessary, for the name by which a people is known to
itself, or the name it applies to places within its area, may not be those by which men of other languages recognize it and them. The land which the Hebrews called Mizraim was the Chemi of its inhabitants and the ^gyptus of the Greeks. The Babylonian of strangers was to himself the man of Duniyas, as in modern times the Deutscher is the Allemand of the French and the
German of the English. Almost as great a difficulty is experienced when, a name being significant, as is the case for instance with many Celtic, Basque, and American Indian names,

it is translated into the language of the transcription. The
Hebrew name Abimeleeh ascribed to the kings of the Philistines was undoubtedly a translation of Padishah or other Aryan word
of similar signification. This process of translation was carried out to a large extent by the Romans, who in this way deprived the philological ethnologist of most important data for ascertaining the aboriginal population of regions within Rome's area of
conquest. Within the limits of the eastern states of the American union and the older provinces of Canada, the original Indian names have been preserved, but, in the west, the Roman example has been unwittingly followed, producing such translations as Ottertail, Yellowstone, Moose Jaw, Pile of Bones, and Medicine Hat. The Assyrian Sargon had a mania for replacing aboriginal names by Assyrian ones, which, however, were not translations, but applications to towns of the names of Assyrian deities, to whose service he devoted them. Shalmanezer set him the example of this renaming a hundred-and-fifty years before.Another thing to guard against in the comparison of bilingual
texts is the assumption that they contain exactly the same
legend or statement—in other words, that they are literal renderings of each other. In the case of a public proclamation such exactness may be expected, but not in that of a sepulchral
inscription or a brief statement of the attributes of royalty. For
the latter each nationality has its own conventional forms, so that in seeking to impart to people of another language the contents of such inscriptions the writer would present a paraphrase rather than a translation, fuller or less complete than
the original, according to his conception of foreign usage and the amount of information the stranger required or it was expedient to impart. A lack of attention to this last caution has hindered the progress of Hittite decipherment.
As has already been stated, the bilingual Hittite and cunei
form inscription was brought to light by the diligence of
Professor Sayce, of Oxford. He first saw a notice of it in a paper by Dr. Mordtmann in the Journal of the German Oriental
2 Sargon, Records of the Past, vol. vii. pp. 21, seq. Shalmanezer, lb. vol. iii. ]) 81, vol. V. p. 27.

Society. Dr. Mordtmann had seen the silver boss containing the
inscription in the possession of M. Alexander Jovanoff in Constantinople, and learned that it had come from Smyrna.
Professor Sayce, after some trouble, came across the facsimile which Dr. Mordtmann had given of the boss in the Miinzstudien or Numismatist published at Leipsic. This further stimulated
his curiosity, and led him to ask, through the columns of the Academy, for information as to the original. He was directed by Mr. Barclay V. Head to the British Museum, which possesses an electrotype of the boss, and was furnished by the same gentleman with a wax cast taken from it. Still unsatisfied, Professor Sayce obtained from the late M. F. Lenormant a cast taken by him from the original at Constantinople. Then comparing all the
copies and finding their accordance, he published an accurate
representation of the inscription and a translation of the cuneiform legend.
^
The silver boss is a little over an inch-and-a-third in diameter,
4? J lines in height, and very thin, so much so as to cause many to
doubt that it can be origina], since the wear and tear of ages on so perishable a metal would have been its destruction. The view of Mr. Rylands is that the original from which the boss was taken was a concave object with incised figures and characters which imparted to the convex impression figures and characters
in relief. Two objections to this theory are that such a concave object, while not without parallel, is at least very uncommon
;
and that Hittite sculpture is generally in relief. Be this as it
may, no one doubts that the inscription is genuine, and that the boss furnishes either an actual Hittite document or a faithful
copy of one. The central figure in the boss is the effigy of a warrior or royal personage of medium or even small stature, clothed in a tunic and elaborately bordered mantle, wearing on his head something very like a peaked jockey cap, and on his
feet, the tip-tilted Hittite boots. He holds a spear or long staff"
in his left hand, and the right is pressed against his breast. The
figure, and indeed the whole inscription, is neatly and carefully

executed, but by one who had crude conceptions of art. Within a circle round this figure are six Hittite hieroglyphics, repeated on either side, and beyond the circle is a rim containing ten cuneiform characters. Professor Sayce refers the form of the cuneiform characters to the age of Sargon, about 720 B.C., or the time of the deportation of the ten tribes of Israel. This, however, by no means settles the antiquity of the inscription, since the same form of writing might be retained for centuries in Asia Minor. Sargon overthrew the Hittite empire at Carchemish, and scattered the warlike tribes that constituted it, many of which took refuge in Asia Minor, carrying with them the latest model of cuneiform writing with which they were acquainted. The reading of the Assyrian characters, according to Professor Sayce, is : Tarriktmime sar mat Ermee, Tarriktimme, king of the country of Erme. The six Hittite hieroglyphics are, from top to bottom, an
animal's head ; a peculiar form of the yoke ; four separate lines,
from the middle of the last of which another projects at right
angles ; a conventional representation of the teeth in the jaw
;
a mountain or double obelisk ; and a single obelisk. The last of
these is to the right in the left hand leo-end, and, in that on the right hand, is immediately below the head and the yoke, being separated from them by the warrior's outstretched arm. Professor Sayce finds that four of the characters are ideographs, and two
only, syllabic characters. With the single obelisk, which he
rightly regards as a symbol of royalty, he connects the animal's head and the yoke, giving to the former the value of tarrik, and
to the latter, that of timnie. The teeth and the four lines he connects with the double obelisk, which he holds to denote a country, and gives the fortuer the value er, and the latter me. The order in which these characters are read is one that takes a
liberty with what seems to be a linear inscription. The word tarkus, tirrikus denotes a hare, as the long-eared animal, in Ossetic, a Caucasian tongue, but the animal whose head is here represented is not a hare, and the Ossetic word is borrowed from the Persian, an Indo-European language. No valid reason is given why the characters should denote timme, er, one. Thus, while the explanation
is ingenious, it is not scientific and accordingly leads to no results



52 THE HITTITES.
The Hittite hieroglyphics in this case should be read naturally from top to bottom. The tirst is an animal's head, which has already been found to have a f value. The Cypriote to agrees in form with old Hebrew alephs originally denoting the head of an ox, and the commonest Aztec hieroglyphic of this nature is the rabbit's head, which also reads to. Here the cuneiform renderinof demands ta instead of to. The second character, although
peculiar, has all its affinities with the yoke or bow, into both of which enters the idea of the arch. Nearly all Cypriote characters of this form are rendered by re and ro. The Aztec tla from tlaoitolli, the bow, is an expedient for ra, and shows it in the Siberian Koriak ratla, the bow. In Basque ra must be the root, meaning an arch, which appears in arrambela, ihztarri, huztarri, denoting arc and yoke. The four lines con
stituting the third hieroglyphic correspond to the Aztec hieroglyphic representing several laths fastened together by a
band or cross piece. In Aztec its value is chi from chiii-hnauh. In its origin it is the same as the Hebrew he meaning a lattice, and is represented by an old Hebrew letter which is the exact reproduction of the Cypriote ke, ge, die, being three horizontal lines united byfa long perpendicular. '^ The Cypriote value being most likely the correct one, he may be considered the power of the lattice. The next character is the teeth, which are represented
in the Aztec hieroglj^phics in a way closely resembling this form.
The Aztec sign has the two values tla and ti from tlantli and titlan. The Circassian dsah, dxe, the Lesghian zavi, the Mizjejian
tzerka, and the Yukahirian fody, preserve the old Hittite root. The Cypriote te has the form of the Semitic letter shin which originally denoted the teeth. The double obelisk of Professor Sayce is rather a mountainous region or sierra. The Georgian mta and Basque meta, mendi, furnish its value, for it is not found in the Aztec system. This is confirmed by the Cypriote,
whose character, mi, exactly corresponds in outline to the Hittite
hieroglyphic, with the exception that the basal line is not carried
to the extremities.

THE BILINGUAL INSCRIPTION. 53
The result attained so far is a syllabic reproduction of
Tarriktimme's name by the five characters, ta-ra-ke-ti-me.
Every character has been vouched for by the Cypriote syllabary, either viewed in itself or in its relations with Semitic alphabets derived from a similar hieroglyphic source. The inscription has
been read naturally from top to bottom in orderly succession. Conjecture has had nothing to do with the process or its result.
This bilingual inscription is not the key to the Hittite inscriptions. That is found in the far distant Aztec hieroglyphics. But something of the kind was necessary in order to convince a world
credulous enough in many things, but sceptical of truth which conflicts with preconceived notions, that two of the three hiero
glyphic systems of the world are in' origin and in signification
one. Professor Sayce is right in regarding the final obelisk as the sign of royalty. It is an ideograph equally with the
Phrygian bonnet to represent the syllabic shield and basket, which furnish the Hittite word Tnata, king. Thus the whole inscription can be read Taraketime-mata, Taraketime, the king, or king Taraketime. The term mata is not confined to the Hittite inscriptions of Syria and Asia Minor, but appears frequently in the Lats of India in the form meta or mita and in the Siberian inscribed monuments. As the languages of these Indian and Siberian records approach nearly to the Japanese, it
is probable that their mito is the original of the Japanese mikado. This word, consisting of mi and kxulo, means the honourable door, and corresponds to the Sublime Porte of the Ottoman Turks. A simple Japanese word for door is to, so that an original Mito would bear the same meanino- as the later Mikado. This, however, does not explain the use of the obelisk
to denote royalty. Dr. Mordtmann and Professor Sayce compared the name Taraketime or Tarriktime with that of the father and son Tarcondimotus mentioned by Dio Cassius and Tacitus as belonging to Cilicia in the time of Augustus. Strabo also speaks of one of them as a person of merit who was made king of Cilicia by the Romans." Professor Sayce has found a Tarcondimatus in
Strabo. lib. xiv. c. v. 18.

Theodoret, who was bishop of Aegae in Cilicia. The name is thus well substantiated as a Cilieian one. But it is also found in India in the form Dirghatamas who was a Kshattriya and at the same time the author of sacred hymns.*' The country over which Tarriktimme ruled is, in the cuneiform legend, called
Erme. If his family remained in possession of their ancient seat of power down to Roman days, this Erme should be looked for somewhere on the borders of Syria and Cilicia, for the later Tarcondimoti were kings of Amanus on the boundary line. No Erme is found there, but there was an Urma eastward in Syria, and a Holmi westward in Cilicia near the Calycadnus. A name that answers in a measure to Erme is that of the Arimi, whom some have supposed to be a fabulous people. They are first mentioned by Homer who places the bed of Typhon in their midst.'^ The abundant references to Typhon by Plutarch and other writers demonstrate that the name denoted that portion of the Hittite family which held sway in Egypt as the Shepherd Kings or Hycsos.^ Typhon also is said to have been the original name
of the Orontes in northern Syria." Pindar derives the Arimi of Sicily from Cilicia, and Strabo quotes Callisthenes to the effect that the Arimi dwelt in Cilicia near the Calycadnus and gave their name to the Arima mountains in that region.^" Now this coincides with the site of Holmi which must be regarded as a corruption of an original Erme or Arimi. The Arimai were a people of the Nairi Hittites of Mesopotamia, and, under their king Bisirain, paid tribute to the Assyrian Samas Riunuon about the middle of the ninth century B.C.^^ It is probable that the name Armenia was derived from this people. The Vishnu Purana which furnishes the name Dirghatamas places Rambha
in the line of his ancestors.^^ Profes.sor Sayce, whose labours in the field of Hittite research
cannot be over estimated, has shown the relation of the name

Tarriktimme to the Hittite names Tharga-nunas and Thargathazas furnished by the Egyptian monuments, and to those of the Gamgumian king Tarkhu-lara, and the Milidian Tarkunazi which the Assyrian records supply. The initial syllables of these names may also be compared with the somewhat disguised Scythic word thyrsus occurring in the names Aga-thyrsus, Idanthyrsus, the latter of wiiich may be an inverted Tarrik-timme.^^ The Scythian Targitaus whom Herodotus presents as the mythic ancestor of that people corresponds in name to the Egyptian Hittite Thargathazas and to the Syrian goddess Atargatis or Derceto. Her temple was found at Ashteroth Karnaim in Bashan in the time of the Maccabees.^^ Another name within the Scythic area is Tama-tarcha, designating a town on the island Taman between the Crimea and the Caucasus.^^ It inverts the Cilician Tarrik-timme like Idan-thyrsus. In Scythic speech Temerinda meant the mother of the sea, and Thamimasadas denoted Neptune.^^ The Maeotis or sea of Azov bore the former name, according to Pliny, and on the southern shore of this sea was Tama-tarcha. The modern Georgian iha, lake or sea, may represent temie, thami, tama, and the words for a spring or source tzqaro, zurgi-li, the final tarcha. The Basque form of the
latter is iturri, and enters largely into proper names, such as Ithuralde, Iturgoyen. It is very unlikely that the timirne of Tarriktimme's name has any connection with tama or tha, the sea ; but that Tarrik means source, fountain head, and thus supreme authority, like the Japanese toriyo, is more than probable. As preceding tinnme it must be employed as an adjective., unless tinime be a word capable of governing one with the meaning
of tarrik in the genitive, which is very doubtful. Among his Etruscan glosses Hesychius furnishes druna, meaning the same as the Greek arche and Latin iDrinciijiu'm}'' This is the Basque iturri in the form iturren, and in this latter form explains the name Tyrrhenia as the home of the original or primitive people,
13 Herodotus, I. iv. cc. 10, 126. In the sequel it appears, however, that Idanthj'rsus is rather a corruption of Hadadezer. 1* II. Maccabees, xii. 26. 15 Constantine Porphyrogenitus, ap. Klaproth, Asia Polyglotta, p. 84. 16 Pliny, 1. vi. c. 7. Herodot, iv. 59. i'^ Hesychius, Lexicon.

while, in the adverbial form iturrik, it furnishes the chief element in the names Tarchon and Tarquin. If it be allowable once more to connect the name Tarriktimme with the Georgian language, which represents the Scythian taina by tba, its words for head, tchnm and tavi,-aiay be compared with tiniine. Should this etymology be correct, as the coincidence of the Japanese atarna, head, and the Bas<(ue thini, top, summit, would warrant in admitting, the name of the ancient king of Erme is, the original or supreme head. It might also mean the head of the source or fountain head, seeing that such is the signification of the family name Minamoto, which plays an important part in the history of Japan. The Basque name that corresponds is Iturburu, and the same language furnishes Iturri-aga to compare with the Scythian Aga-thyrsus. The inversion of Tarriktimme in Idanthyrsus makes it natural to suppose that the Greek name Demetrius, common in Asia Minor, is not to be connected in all cases with Demeter or Ceres, but to be regarded as a hellenized. rendering of the Hittite word which survived in the Indo-Scythic history of
" Cashmere as Damodara.^'* M. Renan, therefore, has not necessarily proved the recent origin of the Book of Xabataean Agriculture when he compares the name of Tamithri the Canaanite with the Greek Demetrius.^^ The Basque tontor, a summit, presents a modern corruption of the two words in this order, inviting comparison with the Egyptian Tentyris and the Greek Tyndarus, as well as with Din-tirki, the Turanian name of Babylon.^^ The original civilization of the countries occupied during the historical period by Semitic and Aryan nations was Turanian, and the Turanian predecessors of Aryans and Semites were
either of the Khitan, or of the allied Ugrian family. It is
natural, therefore, and justifiable to seek in the Khitan languages for the etymologies of the most ancient terms, geographical, personal, or mythological, which occur within the area of original Turanian empire. Among these, Taraketime holds no unimportant place.

CHAPTER V.
The Stone Bowl from Babylon.
As the process of Hittite transliteration has ah'eady been
fully described, and as minute explanation of all the characters,
their values, and the words and constructions they constitute, can only be wearisome to the general reader, these details are transferred to the appendix, where they may be easily consulted. In looking at the inscription on the stone bowl, it would seem as if the scribe had indicated the point at which it begins by the
two dots in the lower part of it as seen in the plate. A slight mistake has been made, however, either by the scribe or the transcriber, for the beginning of the document should be placed two lines to the right of these dots, or between the lines which commence nearest the rim of the bowl, the one with the rude representation of an animal's head, the other with the inscribed diamond. Reading from the rim towards the base, and from left
to right, the inscription yields the following : Asher tsit alka Tuiata Sennakseriha sankatzu ka Assaragotane ne Sennaskeriba arte kakw kara onopi hebane sara sesena mane tsuka hasbane salara rtiata Maishga Tarako Sarara kula takekala. The literal translation is : Assyria of powerful king Sennacherib succeeding son Esarhaddon to Sennacherib to hold memory brings two stone bowls, genuine manehs, containing truly pure silver, King Moschi Tarako Sarara City inhabiting. Translated freely, the inscription reads : Tarako, King OF THE Moschi, dwelling in the city Sarara, brings to Esarhaddon, THE successor OF THE MIGHTY KiNG OF ASSYRIA, SENNACHERIB, TWO STONE BOWLS containing JUST MANEHS OF REALLY
PURE SILVER, TO HOLD SENNACHERIB IN MEMORY (or it may beHOLDING Sennacherib in memory). The first thing which strikes the translator of this document
is that most of its words and constructions are Basque. With the exception of the boss of Tarriktimme, the Stone Bowl is the

most recent record of the Hittites in the hieroglyphic character, dating from about 680 B. C. The western dialect which was afterwards spoken in Illyria, Etruria, Spain and Pictish Britain, was then being developed in Asia Minor ; while in Media and Parthia, the oriental dialect, afterwards spoken in northern India, Siberia, Corea and Japan, was in process of formation. It does not appear, so far as the inscription goes, that the western
dialect had developed the chief peculiarity of Basque grammar in the time of King Tarako. That peculiarity is the combination of pronominal forms with the tenses of the auxiliary verbs, to be,
and, to have or do, so as to include in one word the subject and the direct and indirect objects. Such polysynthetic and apparently inseparable forms are nion, I did it to him, hion, thou didst it to him, zion, he did it to him.^ This system must have been developed in Asia Minor, for it appears in Phrygian and Lycian inscriptions, some of which cannot have been long
posterior to that of the Moschian King. In the so called Kelokes incription, which is really in memory of Meratuneda, probably a Persian Mardontes, occurs the expression, erausi negara kasapara bazion, " he poured out to him tears and sighs," in which bazion is such a case of jiolysynthesis as appears in Etruscan and in modern Basque.- It would be interesting to find the genesis of this system, which has no place in hieroglyphic Hittite nor in
the eastern dialect as written. That it had a place in the latter dialect as spoken, is evident from the fact that the same kind of polysynthesis exactly is found in the Iroquois and some other American languages ; but even in America the process is rare, so that it is a misnomer to call the languages of this continent
polysynthetic.^ The most evident Basque words in the inscription of King Tarako are aUat from al power ; arte kakit, in Basque arte gorjo, keep the memory ; kara, in B. ekarri, our English word carry
;

B. utsbena, pure, true ; salara, B. zillar, silver. The Etruscan form of arte gogo is the same as that on the stone bowl, arte
Jcaku or gogu, and its ekarri is ka/ra.* The word sesena, occurs in the Cappadocian cuneiform tablets transliterated by Professor
Sayce, sometimes, as in this inscription, with raaneh as sussama. mana. These genuine or just manehs must have been those of Carcheraish, which were standard among the Assyrians. To
read the word susuna., which doubtless is more correct than
sesena, would, as a matter of consistency, require the rendering of the royal names by Sunnaskeriba and Susuragotane. One
word, inopi, two, is Etruscan, its first syllable being lost in modern Basque, in which two is bi.^ The term bebane, for stone,
finds no monumental parallel nearer than the Pictish inscriptions of the Isle of Man, in two of which occur the words sakxibama. and bamasaka, denoting a dressed stone.*' The explanation again
comes from the far east, Japan furnishing sekiban, a lithographer's
stone or a slate. In the same language, banjaku is a large stone or boulder ; while the Basque gives pantoka as a synonym of
harritoki, a pile of stones. Otherwise, bama, ban, bebane, are
not Khitan Avords, and clearly indicate the presence of the people
employing them, at some stage in their history, in the vicinity of a Semitic empire, for the original of these tenns is the Hebrew and Assyrian eben, abnu, a stone. To account for such a Semitic root in Biscay and Japan one must needs find the ancestors of the Guipuscoans in Mesopotamian Khupuscia, and those of the men of Yamato in Syrian Hamath. It is thus not hard to understand why the legends of the Basques are full of the Bed Sea, and why the Tenno-Sama or ark shrine of Japan should have many features in common with Israel's Ark of the Covenant.'' The use of the word sara, in Basque za.re, ^are, in Japanese zarv,, to denote a bowl of stone, is remarkaVjle, as in Basque and Japanese
it means a basket. What makes it stranofer is that the Hittite

basket as a symbol has the phonetic value ta. The inversion must have taken place in Japan, which has tarai for a bowl or basin. The word for basket in Loo Chooan, which is a Japanese
dialect, is tiriv, the atere oi the American Iroquois. A similar inversion to the Japanese appears among the Basques, who use the reduplicate tutula to designate a handled bowl akin to the American dipper. A very unexpected word to meet with in a
Hittite inscription is the Basque zillar, silver, as saiarft, probably the original of the German silber and English silver. The word evidently consists of two parts, as the Georgian renders it ver
tsrldi, ver-tschle, kvar-tschili, an inversion of the German and English form. The final ar of the Basque is no doubt arri, a stone, and the Georgian ver, kvar must represent an ancient form of the modern kva, a stone. The Japanese shiro kane, white metal, is in favour of regarding zill in zillar as a corruption of the Basque zari, white, but the Georgian does not conform although its neighbour the Lesghian has tchalasa, white, with
which tschili may be compared. Professor Sayce calls silver the
favourite metal of the Hittites. It is right, therefore, that they should have had the honour of giving a name to their favourite.
There is one word in the inscription under consideration that
occurs in many others. It is that read as kula, a city. The
Georgian kalaki and Circassian shilde are nearest to the Hittite form, although the Basque hiri and Japanese shiro, which word
only means a fortified place, are of the .same origin. The
Yeniseian Kelet, Koleda, transmitted the Circassian variation eastwards, and the Iroquois kanata is the same word with the common change in the Khitan languasres of I to n.^ Looking for the origin of kula it is to be remembered that in Georgian a house is sachli and okori, and that the Aztec and its related
American dialects call a house calli,cari,caliki. An examination of the Khitan languages shows a very definite relation between the names for house and city. That the ancient Hittite word for hou.se was kida cannot yet be proved, but it is certain that
the fir-st .syllable of the word was kn or /.:o, as that is the phonetic
value of the hieroglyphic representing a house in several of the
" Some laws of Phonetic change in the Khitan Languages, Trans. Canad. Inst.



THK STONE BOWL FROM BABYLON. 61
inscriptions. In three instances it stands for the first syllable in the word Kumuka, Korauka, denoting Commagene in Syria. If the transliterations of the cuneiform Hittite tablets from Cappa
docia are to be perfectly relied on, seeing that Professor Sayce himself regards some of them as doubtful, the pronunciation of the word for city in the time of Hittite supremacy in Cappadocia was havl. In the tablet numbered R. I., and on the obverse, the transliteration is : Y mana VI sussana dhu anna ina Abeimniis-kuul ; V bar dhu anna inna Amaas-niis-kuul ; XIV bar dhu anna ina Nakhuur-niis kuul ; III dhu anna Lusiim niis kuul : III dhu anna Niriim-niis kuul. Professor Sayce reads sussana as one third ; it is the Basque zuzena, standard, right. The word anna he translates lead ; it is the Etruscan no7i, the relative pronoun, who, which, but in modern Basque signifies w^here and
that, its place as relative being taken by nor, nok. In Hittite it is represented by two n characters, which may be read nana, aman, anna^. Here the cuneiform comes to the help of the
trausliterator. Professor Sayce renders hia as in or at ; it is an
old verb, to give, contribute, surviving in the Basque indak,
indan, indazv.., give it to me. The words ni-is-kii-ul he regards as the Assyrian niskul, we weighed ; the preceding Abeim, Amaas, Nakhuur he fails to explain, but for niriim and lusiim he suggests worked and un worked. The fact is that these five words are names probably of cities and the people inhabiting them, the word kuul meaning city, and the preceding ni-is being
the plural and genitive particles respectively. The document may therefore be read without explaining the monetary terms : " Five manehs, six standard dhu, which the city of the Abeim gives ; five bar dhu, which the city of the Amaas gives ; fourteen ba.r dhit, which the city of the Nakhuur gives ; three dhu, which
the city of the Lusiim (gives); three dJut, which the city of the Niriim (gives)."^ These cities and peoples were evidently in what afterwards became Galatia, but was Phrygian at the time when the tablet was written. Abeim represents Peium, Nakhuur, Ancyra, Lusiim, Luceium, but Amaas and Niriim are without

other record.^" It would be an important aid to transliteration
could the cuneiform equivalents be relied upon, and the two n
signs be read anna, the plural and genitive particles, nl and 'is, and the word for city, kuul. A comparative survey of the Khitan languacres favours non rather than anna, and hula rather than haul ; it is also in favour of in or en for the plural, and f<e or sa for the genitive. The Hittite hieroglyphic system has a symbol for isJi, the inscribed diamond, but it is not employed to denote the genitive. Yet there is no doubt that sw<>^ana represents the actual pronunciation of the modern Basque zuzena. The finding of the stone bowl in Babylon is explained by the fact that Esarhaddon was the first among Assyrian monarchs to set up his court in that city. The statement of the Book of Chronicles that Manasseh, King of Judah, was carried captive by the Assyrians to Babylon, illustrates this transference of the seat of empire, for Esarhaddon was his captor.^^ The Assyrian monarch was known as the King of Babylon, and conferred upon his son the title, King of Assyria. This inscription is the only
one that calls Ass3'ria by its proper name. In three other inscriptions it is several times mentioned, but under the name Sagane or Sakane, by which Assyria was known to the Hittite kings of Carchemish and of the Rosh. The bowls with their silver contents may have been sent or brou(;ht by the Moschian king on the occasion of the accession of Esarhaddon to sole empire, as the statement that they were memorial gifts, evidencing the friendship of Tarako for Sennacherib, the father of that king, would seem to indicate. Unhappily the name of Tarako does not appear in the inscriptions of either Assyrian, nor do they refer to the Moschi. Tarako is more like the Tarkhu of Tarkhu-lara the Gamgumian, and Tarkhu-nazi, the Milidian, than like the Tarrik of Tarriktimme, and at the same time finds its counterpart
geographically in Tarraco of the Celt Iberians of Spain. The
application of the same name to persons and places is a common practice among the Khitan, and is well illustrated by the name of a distinguished Frenchman of Basijue parentage lately deceased, the Admiral de Jaureguibery, which means the new
'" Strabo. 1. xii. c. v. 2. ' Lenorniant, Ancient History of the East, I. 406 ; 2 Chron. xxxiii. 11.



THE STONE BOWL FROM BABYLON. 63
palace. It would be a matter of mere conjecture to suggest a derivation for the word Tarako, although, assuming it to be the
same as the Tarkhu of the Assyrian inscriptions, the terms lava
and nazi, which accompany it in these inscriptions, may be helpful in arriving at a possible rendering. The iirst of these,
la7'a, may stand for lar, sweet-briar, larre, pasture, larri, great,
larru the skin, lerro, a rank, lora, a flower, lur, earth, etc. So
nazi may be an old form of nas, together, nas-ai, relaxed, ansi,
care, antze, industry, a7itz, appearance, resemblance. Many Khitan names are composed of the Basque eder, Georgian djiri, beautiful, agreeable, good. A Basque, bearing the name Darrigol,
would at once recognize in that name a corruption of edergallu, an ornament or beautiful object. So it is allowable to suppose the khu of Tarkhu and the ko of Tarako to be the genitive
particle ko, go, which in Basque, being affixed to adjectives, changes them into nouns, while, following nouns, it turns them
into adjectives. Recognizing eder in ta7\ the name Tarako, Tarraco, simply means beauty, Tarkhu-lara, the flower, earth, meadow of beauty, and Tarkhu-nazi, the likeness of beauty. Tarako was a king of the Moschi, who are frequently mentioned by the warlike Assyrian monarchs. Long before
their time, Rameses II., of Egypt, met them in Palestine, as the Hittite Masu or Maasu, and it is likely that the Mashuash, who boldly invaded Egypt in the reigns of Rameses III. and Menephtah, were the same people.^-^ Sir Henry Rawlinson finds an agreement between Moschic names and those of the primitive Turanians of Chaldea.^^ It is not improbable, therefore, that the Moschi formed part of the Hittite population which dwelt about the lower waters of the Euphrates and Tigris. Certainly a branch of the Ras was found thereat a comparatively late period in Assyrian history, and the invariable connection of Rosh and
Meshech in the Hebrew record would justify the supposition that
the Moschi in part at least were not far distant.^* But the chief
portion of this Hittite family, in the time of the later Assyrian
kings, was found in the north, somewhere between Iberia in the

Caucasus and the reo^ion of the Rosh, of which Marasia was the capital. The Moschica of the classical geographers extends over the north-western portion of Armenia and parts of Colchis and Iberia. Their most famous seat of empire was Cappadocia, in which the nation underwent a change of name, but retained the primitive appellation to designate the capital Mazaca. Josephus is guilty of many absurdities in his commentary upon the Toldoth Beni Noah, but, in identifying the Cappadocians with the Moschi, through their capital Mazaca, he has shown singular wisdom.^^ The testimony of antiquity is in favour of connecting the
Biblical Caphtorim who came out of Egypt in the Philistines' compan}', with the Cappadocians. They derived their name from Kebt-hor or Coptus, as Mr. Poole and Sir G. Wilkinson have stated.^® The almost inevitable conclusion to be drawn from these two identifications is that the Cappadocians or Moschi were not only a tribe of the Hycsos, who long ruled in the land of the Pharaohs, but that they were the leading or royal tribe. The presence of the Mashuash in Egypt and even south of Memphis,
in the leign of Rameses III., is thus easily explained. The Caphtorim had either not been fully expelled from the scene of their conquest, or they were seeking to regain their lost empire. Being at length driven out, they retired into southern Palestine and conquered the coast of the Avim, extending from Gaza to the extreme east of the Sinaitic peninsula.^" Thence they must have made their way in two directions, the one eastward to the Shat el Arab, where they were known as the Hubudu, the other northward, through the country beyond Jordan, to Mesopotamia, Armenia, and Asia Minor, where they were called the Muski or Moschians.^*^ The Assyrian Sargon makes them the most northern people of whom he had knowledge, and states that Mita, their king, was the first Moschian to pay tribute to his
empire.^'*' This seems to indicate that the Moschi were then in
the region of the Caucasus.

King Tarako indicates the abode of the Moschi in his day by
calling its chief city Sarara. Sururia is mentioned by Tiglath
Pileser I. as one of the cities of the Nairi in Mesopotamia.^" In the later list of the Nairi cities, given by Samas Rimmon, it may
be represented by Zuzarurai or by Arta-Sirari, but neither
account specifies the position of the city.^^ Shalmanezer places Seruria near Kasyari, which was in Armenia near the sources of the Tigris. In the same region he places Saluri, in another
. inscription calling it the capital of Enzite, but farther on Enzite and Kirruri are combined. ^^ Ashur-nazir-pal and Ashur-akh-bal also mention Kirruri as the northern limit of their conquest, and
as the former also professed to receive tribute in copper from the Moschi, it is probable that Kirruri represents a migratory Seruria and Sarara.23 In the classical geographers the name Carura belongs to Phrygia, and should thus be found among the original Phrygians of Iberia. There was an ancient Sura on the river Cyrus in that country, and the Moschi were certainly there, but
the absence of the final syllable does not permit its acceptance as
the Sarara of the text. It is natural to think that at so late a date as 680, the Moschi had already established themselves in Cappadocia, where the Persians found them a hundred and fifty years later. There was in the north-western part of that country a town called Saralium^ which may be taken to represent an aboriginal Sarala or Sarara. The chano-e of tribute, from the copper presented to Ashur-nazir-pal to the very pure silver given to Esarhaddon by King Tarako, is perhaps significant, as Asia Minor was preeminently the land of silver, but no definite argument can be drawn from this distinction in favour of a Cappadocian Sarara. It can only be said that the probabilities are in its favour. The word sarera in Basque means an entrance, and may thus denote a pass such as the Cilician gates, in which case the northern Saralium could no longfer be reofai'ded as, at
least, the original Sarara. This must be found in the south of Cappadocia, where Alexander the Great entered Cilicia on his

way to meet Darius. Carura in Phrycria does not seem to have denoted a pass, but nevertheless connects with Cappadocia in the worship it paid to the god Men, who was called in Cappadocia and Pontus, Men Pharnaces, in Phrygia, Men Carus. Pharnaces is a purely Hittite word denoting the Barnaki who dwelt in Telassar, and whom Esarhaddon subdued.^^

CHAPTER VI.
The Votive Inscriptions from Hamate.
The votive inscriptions are three in number and commemorate
one person. They differ in but few particulars, the legend in
each case being practically the same. The first line reads from
left to right, the second from right to left, and the third line of two of them from left to right again. The Rev. Dr. Hayes Ward was the first to point out this boustrophedon order of
writing, which is characteristic of many Khitan inscriptions, but is also found in the Sigean and other ancient Greek records. The temptation in reading these tablets is to regard the most prominent hieroglyphic, that of a human head and arm with hand pointing to the face, as an ideograph, or even as a deter
minative prefix. Determinative prefixes, or sufiixes, are found in Egyptian and cuneiform inscriptions. These are not read either
alphabetically or syllabically, but simply serve to render definite
the meaning of the connected alphabetic or syllabic characters. They are thus ideographs setting forth a god, ruler, man, woman,
.animal, bird, metal, country, river, city, house, etc. In Hittite there are no determinative suffixes of any kind, every character possessing syllabic or ideographic value and being capable of
transliteration in the text. The only importance attaching to the
hieroglyphic of the hand pointing to the face is that it denotes the first syllable of the word saki meaning supreme head or emperor. It is found in the five inscriptions from Hamath, and in the two from Jerabis which are capable of being translated. That there was no intention on the part of the Hittite scribes to make this character prominent above others appears from Hamath iii,, in which it does duty for the genitive suffix. In this connection
it establishes the Hittite form of the genitive in s, as sa, not
is, for the word saki, in which the hieroglyphic more frequently appears, is a well determined word, being the Japanese saki,

front, foremost, and the Basque zagi, chief. It is not likely that the word has undergone any vowel change since the days of
ancient Hittite monarchy. Hamath i. is imperfect at the beginning of the first and third lines, and at the end of the second. Transliterated, it reads
:
Line 1, basanesa sari ke ne ri tohago itsuka Kera saki : Line 2, ne tenia kara mata matanesa sata kara siitoba niatsuhil : Line 3, inata Katanesa Pisa, II Maka ne non gagu bake. Hamath ii.
is deficient in one or two charactei's at the beginning of the first
line, and the latter part of the second is so mutilated as to be
illegible, the characters that can be read ke ka ne ka, being useless without the context. Its legend is: Line 1, Mata matanesa
nabasanesa. sari Pisa ke ne ri to liago itsuka Kera saki : Line 2, temakata mata matanesa tola sain sutoba matsuhil Baal ke
:
Line 3, mata Pisa sari II Maka ne non gagu bake. Hamath iv., though shorter than the preceding, is apparently more perfect. It reads : Line 1, Ke ne mata matanesa nabasanesa sari Pisa, ne ri to hago ke itsuka Kera saki: Line 2, non gagu bake temata, mata, matanesa kara sata sutoba matsuhil Baal ke. Literally
translated, the inscriptions yield the following : H. i. line 1 , of lords the leader, am I government door bar, whole Syria emperor:
Line 2, I oflTering bring, the king of kings protection to bring, an
altar to sacrifice : Line 3, king of the Hittites Pisa, Il-Makah to
who mind places. H. ii. line 1, king of kings, of lords the leader Pisa, am I government door bar, whole Syria emperor : Line 2,
offered the king of kings to obtain protectid\i an altar to sacrifice
Baal to: Line 3, King Pisa the leader II Makah to who mind places. H. iv. line 1, Am I king of kings of lords the leader Pisa, I government door bar am, whole Syria emperor : Line 2, who mind places to offer king of kings to bring protection an altar to sacrifice
Baal to. Rendered into intelligible English, H. i. reads : The lord of lords, i am the bar of the gate of authority, the emperor of all svkia. i bring an offering to gain protection for the king of kings, an altar to. sacrifict:

Pisa, the king of the Hittites, who sets his heart on II Makah. H. ii. is much the same : Pisa, king of kings, LORD OF lords, I AM THE BAR OF THE GATE OF AUTHORITY,



THE VOTIVE INSCRIPTIONS FROM HAMATH. 69
THE EMPEROR OF ALL SyRIA. ThE KING OF KINGS OFFERED TO OBTAIN PROTECTION, AN ALTAR TO SACRIFICE TO BaAL. KiNG Pisa, the leader, who sets his heart on II Makah. Similar is the legend of H. iv. : I AM THE KING OF KINGS, THE LORD OF lords, Pisa, I am the bar of the gate of authority, the EMPEROR OF ALL SyRIA, WHO SETS HIS HEART TO OFFER AN ALTAR TO SACRIFICE TO BaAL, TO OBTAIN PROTECTION FOR THE KING OF KINGS. Part o£ the same formula is found much disfigured in the upper line of Hamath v., but no mention is there
made of any god, offering, or altar. It is improbable that the
Hittite king presented three altars to Baal. The three stones, therefore, may be regarded as having formed part of one large
altar, containing an inscription on each of its faces. If there
were but three of these, the fourth side of the edifice consisting
of a flight of steps for the ascent of the priests, we possess in all
likelihood the whole of the dedication. The Rev. W. Wright
states that H. iv. is on the side of the stone which has H. v. on its
face. The internal evidence of the inscriptions is that they have no necessary or even probable connection with each other, and Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake confirms this by uniting H. iii. and H. v. in the way indicated by Mr. Wright, and making H. iv. an indepen
dent inscription.
The author of the inscriptions and donor of the altar to which they belonged is Pisa, the sari or leader. A comparison of the Hittite formulas for zazena, Sennacherib, and Esarhaddon, has already indicated that accuracy in the expression of vowel values
was not a failing of the scribes of Jerabis, Hamath, and Sarera. In this respect they imitated the Phoenicians and other writers of Semitic letters, who rarely sought even for the means of expressing vowels. While, therefore, the first character in the name
must be found among the four equivalents, be, hi, jpe, pi, the second may be almost any power of s from se to so and su. Pisa was a common name among the Khitan, both for men and women, and occurs on several Etruscan and Pictish monuments,
at the same time designating an Etruscan city, Pisae. Pais
appears among the Hittite personal names preserved in the
Egyptian monuments, and Bisirain, king of the Arimai, a tribe of the Hittite Nairi, probably bore the same name with an incre

ment. But the Pisa or Pisi of the three votive tablets is no obscure personage. He is the Hittite suzerain whom the
Assyrians called Pisiri or Pisiris, and whose name Professor Sayce has wisely compared as to its second element with that of the ancient Hittite monarch of Egyptian days, Kheta-sira/" The
Assyrian form of the word is a corruption or abbreviation of Pisasari, Pisa the leader or captain. In H. v. Pisa is indicated by an ideograph, the head of a goat upon a stand, which renders it
probable that the original signification of the word was goat or
kid, from which those of agility and liveliness would naturally be derived. The Georgian j^i/cii- a goat conforms, like the Mizjejian
hohe, botsch, goat, and the Basque bitika, a kid, while the Loo
Chooan Jija, goat, kid, exhibits the original labial in the Japanese hitsuji, even now sometimes pronounced jitsiiji, goat. The
Basque words bizi lively, and biztu, excite, animate, display the evolution of abstract ideas from the original Syrian term. The
European names Capriolo, Capreol, Caprilius, are analogous to the Hittite Pisa, of which indeed they may have been translations. So great was the dignity of the goat in eastern lands that Solomon compares it to a lion and a king.^
The Egyptians called a Hittite king Kheta-sira, and the
Assyrians called Pisa-zari, Pisiris. May it not be inferred from
this that the original form of the second half of the name of the ruler of Carchemish was sira or siri rather than sari ? The Japanese word kashira, a captain, is the equivalent of the Etruscan and Basque zari, and seems to favour sira as the primitive form. On the other hand the Basque words zari and zagl, as in buru-zari, buru-zagi, are interchangeable, and the latter agrees with the Japanese saki. So in Assyrian appear the two forms saru, a king, and saku, high, exalted. The Japanese kashira is kaiser and czar. There is no doubt about s%r being Semitic, its philological connections and frequent recurrence in the
Hebrew Scriptures to denote a captain and a prince, establishing its claim in this respect. The same connection does not appear in
1 Trans. Soc. Bib. Archseol., vol. vii. p. 290. 2 Proverbs xxx. 31. Pisa was a very common Hittite name, but as the sequel will indicate, it was not of Hittite origin, being derived from an Indo-European word called in the Hebrew Scriptures Buz.



THE VOTIVE INSCKIPTIONS FROM HAMATH. 71
the Khitan languages, so that it may be a loan word to them from the Semitic Assyrian, in which case it should be pronounced zari or sari, as in Basque. The Japanese saki, foremost, front, has many connections, but in its own language the Basque zagi stands alone. The Georgian eshgu, Circassian seke, seka, denoting the number one, may in the sense of, first, represent the Japanese saki and Basque zagi. Pisa-zari or Pisiris was king of Carchemish, the Hittite capital on the northern borders of Mesopotamia and Syria. He is mentioned by Tiglath Pileser II. and Sargon in their annals. The for
mer tells how he received tribute from the Hittite suzerain, placing his name between that of Urikki of the land of Quai in Cilicia and
that of Eniel of the city of Hamath. Sargon states that in the
fifth year of his reign, or about 716 B.C., " Pisiris of Karkamis sinned against the great gods and sent against Mita the Moschian messages hostile to Assyria." Thereupon the Assyrian monarch drove Pisiris from Carchemish, plundered the city, carried its people captive to Assyria and replaced them with Assyrians.^ In
Pisiris, therefore, we meet with the last lord paramount of the Hittites in Syria. This expulsion of Pisiris from Carchemish, and virtual overthrow of Hittite dominion in all the adjacent country, is one of the most important events, probably the most important, in Hittite history. It must be contained in some native tradition or document, it may be in many of them, could the disguise be penetrated that time throws over events and
personages, when their story is carried to new and distant seats of national life. Some Hittite Homer may have sung the story of Pisiris' wanderings, whether these led him and his followers northward into the fastnesses of the Caucasus, westward to Hittite friends settled throughout the length and breadth of Asia
Minor, or into the far east, where, on the banks of the Indus, the
sons of Heth were once more to rule as lords of the earth.* It is not to be supposed that monumental evidence is all that is available for reconstructing Hittite history, although it must be
the test of the truthfulness of material drawn from other sources.
3 Records of the Past, vol. v. p. 48, vol. vii. p. 30. * Evidence will yet be found for the transference of Hittite monarchy to Hj-rcania and Chorasmia on the Caspian.



72 THE HITTITES.
The early histories of Armenia and Persia were largely derived from Turanian documents and traditions. The greater part of the Raja Tarangini, or history of the kings of Cashmere, was drawn
from similar sources. Purely Hittite are the histories of Corea and Japan, and those of the Iroquois, Mexicans, and Peruvians,
on this continent. In the west, not only all that Greek writers have preserved of the most ancient history of the states of Asia Minor belongs to the same category ; but also all that Pausanias and similar topographical historians have handed down concerning the aborigines of Hellas is to be included in the same. To these materials may be added everything that can be gleaned of lUyrian, Etruscan, and Celt Iberian tradition and the most ancient records preserved by Celtic and Scandinavian writers,
who incorporated in their traditions those of the more civilized
Turanian peoples whose rule they superseded. Among these the
story of the fall of Carchemish and expatriation of king Pisiris will certainly be found by future explorers.
The titles of Pisiris are five in number. First, he is onata
rtiatanesa, the king of kings, a term which in itself explains the
constitution of the Hittite empire. It was a confederac}' of
independent states, which were generally cities with a portion of the surrounding country, under the presidency of the ruler of one of the states distinguished by power, antiquity, or tribal pre-eminence. This constitution, resembling in many respects the feudal government of mediaeval Europe, is found in all countries inhabited by the Khitan, from Etruria and Pictish Britain, on the one hand, to Japan and Mexico on the other. Its order was occasionally set aside by conquerors from among the Khitan themselves, who assumed for a time nnperial power, but after
their death the old state of things returned. Of the Nairi alone,
who were but a branch of the Hittite stock, Tiglath Pileser I. enuTnerated twenty-three states, and Samas Rimmon counted
twenty-eight kings of the same family.^ Pisiris also calls him
self nahwiineHii zari, which is l)etter expressed by the Latin dux clorninoruin than by any English term, for the Basque nahivsi, nausi, Japanese minhi, means a master. In Etruscan, the
'' Records of the Past, vol. v. p. 10, vol. i. ]>. IS.



THE VOTIVE INSCRIPTIONS FROM HAMATH. 73
following zari is employed to denote a military leader, a captain, just as sar is used in Hebrew. Why it should govern such a word as nabusi, master, owner, possessor, in the genitive, is hard to say ; one would rather expect to find it thus governing some word denoting a warrior. Translating nabusi and dominus hy lord, the equivalent of nabusinesa zari is lord of lords. The king of kings and lord of lords is ri to hago, the bar of the door of authority. The Japanese ri, more fully riyo, means dominion, rule, jurisdiction. The same root is found in Basque, but has
erroneously been regarded as a loan word front one of the Romance languages. It appears in errege, king, erretate, royalty, erresuma, kingdom, erretor, rector. The following to is the
Japanese word for door, which enters into the constitution of
Yarnfito, the mountain door ; its Basque equivalent is ate, atJie,
Circassian tsche, Yeniseian athol, Koriak titil, etc. The modern Japanese word for a crossbar, such as primitive doors and gates
were closed with, is yoko-gi. In Basque, haga, ago. means a
horizontal pole or bar, but in the form atkal haga denotes the
bar of the door, the word for door, athe, taking an increment for euphon\ "s sake. The door played an important part in Hittite phraseology. Already the very name mata, 'tnato, mito, has been found as the original of the Japanese mikado, kado being also
door or gate, meaning the illustrious door or sublime porte. The name of Hamath again as Ya^niato is, the gate of the mountains.
In the Book of Rites of the Iroquois, one of the American tribes whose language has intimate affinities to the Basque, the Senecas bore the honourable title Ronaninhohonti, the doorkeepers.^ As applied to Pisiris and other Hittite suzerains dwelling in Carchemish, the term, bar of the gate of dominion, probably means that they were the guardians of the confederacy, con
sidered as a great house or walled city in poetic thought. The fourth title is itsuka or atsuka Kera saki, the emperor or chief ^of the whole of Syria. The Japanese word tsugo means the whole ; in Basque it is oso, osoki. It has often been asked whence
came the word Syria, seeing that the Semitic name of the country so called was Aram. To the Egyptians, Syria was
Kharu. It has no philological connection, therefore, either with
' Hale, The Iroquois Book of Rites, p. 79.



74 THE HITTITES.
Assyria or with Tyre, Tsor. Strabo informs us that the Cappadonians were called Leucosyri or White Syrians, and they certainly were HittitesJ The name Syria is thus a Greek adaptation of the native Kera, and this is probably the same word as the Basque herr'i, Etruscan kara, a country which
survives in the Japanese kori, a province, but finds its best modern
exponent in Corea, anciently called Karo, which means the land. Kera, therefore, is the native land of the Hittites, the country, in
contradistinction to all other parts of the earth. Pisiris' last title is mafa Katanesa, king of the Hittites. Any doubt that the Hittites were the authors of the Hamath and similar inscriptions cannot survive this statement. Some of the symbols that
constitute the initial syllable of the word read Kata, have the
phonetic value ki, as in the last line of Hamath iii., but the hieroglyphic employed in the title under consideration in Hamath i.
has the value generally of ku, gu. Although some Assyrian
inscriptions call the Hittites, Hatti, Khatti, Khatu,—the Hebrew Heth or Cheth, Egyptian Kheta, Khita, Chinese Khitan, and Mexican Citin, are in favour of ki. Yet the Indian Cathaei, Tartar Katei, and mediasval Cathay, seem to indicate, with the Assyrian name, a lack of constancy in the vowel of the tirst
.syllable.
The Hittite words sutoba and matsuhil are worthy of attention. The first of these consists apparently of the Basque verb
siUio to burn, from su, fire, and ha, an old word meaning place.
The Japanese preserves ba in its original signification, but in
Basque its place is generally taken by the word ^^eu of unknown
derivation. Yet ather-be, a shelter, and harro-bi, a quarry, retain ba as be and bi, the two words meaning a place of shelter, and a place of stones. The Basque su, fire, agrees with the Lesghian zo, za, zi, with the Mizjejian zie, tm, and in part with the Georgian zez-chli; but the modern Japanese word is hi. However, the Japanese retains the old word subitsu, a hearth, the Basque
.fubazter, as a remini-scence of the ancient language. Thus satiiba is literally a place of burning. The Japanese has an isolated word sotoba, denoting a wooden grave-tablet inscribed with
' Strabo, lib. xii. c. iii. 5. They were Hittites with a large intermixture of Aryan blood ; Caphtorim mingled with Philistim.



THE VOTIVE INSCRIPTIONS FROM HAMATH. 75
Sanscrit characters, but it is improbable that it has any connection with the term employed by the Hittite scribe. It is only Ijy
a comparison of different texts that the etymology of 'niatsuhil can be decided. It would be a simple matter to compare it at
once with the modern Japanese mat.sitri, to offer sacrifice ; but what are the constituents of matsuri, for the Basque has no such word ? In Hamath iii., matsii occurs twice with an increment as matsune, where a verb, to give, is demanded by the context. This verb is the Basque eviaten, eman, anciently ematzen, to give. The Japanese has lost this as a separate verb, but retains its root ma as mu, to transform nouns into verbs ; thus from ina, no, and
tsuka, a handle, are derived inamu, tsukamu, to refuse, to grasp, but literally, to give a no, to give a handle. In Etruscan the
verb is frequently used in its radical form, ma or ema.^ About hil or il there is no doubt ; it is the Basque word meaning dead, death, die. This simple radical is concealed in the Georgian
rtiokluli, sikvdili, the Circassian tlagha, tkcsh, and the Mizjejian
legi, but is preserved in all its simplicity in the Choctaw illi. A commoner word for death is the Basque heriotze, Lesghian haratz,
Japanese korosu, Iroquois kerios, and Dacotah karrasha. It is more than probable that hiltze and heriotze are but variant forms
of one root. The absence of the letter I in Japanese makes hil,
il an impossibility in that language. The whole word matsu-hil
is thus an inversion of the Basque hildio-onatzen, which now means to mortify, but the literal rendering of which is, to give death. A remnant of pagan days is the Basque ahrildu, to sacri
fice, literally abere-hildu, to kill an animal, but matsuhil is a
much older term, so much so that its Japanese equivalent ^naf-s-^crf has completely lost its etymological connection. The primitive meaning of sacrifice in many languages seems to have been simply
that of slaughter.
The deity honoured by Pisiris at Hamath bears Semitic names, Baal and II Makah. Now the Hamathites had a god of their own name<l Ashima, the same doubtless as the Japanese war god Hachiman. Baal must have been borrowed from the
Phoenicians, as he was by the Israelites in the time of their long
See Etruria Capta.



76 THE HITTITES.
apostacy.^ So great was the fame of this Syrian god that ahnost every European country retains traces of his worship, and even in America these are not altogether wanting.^" The other name, II Makah, can hardly denote a different deity, for we cannot
suppose that the Hittite would profane the altar he erected for one god by placing on it a record of his devotion to another. We must therefore regard II Makah as an epithet of Baal. II Makah was an Arabian god peculiarly connected with Haran,from which the similarly named region in Mesopotamia is not to be dissociated.^^ In the Semitic tongues the name would signify the god of
slauohter, and, in the Hittite iano-uao-e, while II does not denote a god, the words II or Hil-maka mean the death striking, for
maka signifies to strike, wound, kill. It may be, therefore, that
the epithet is Hittite, the only thing against this being the
absence from the base of the il, al, la symbol of the horizontal
line denoting a prefixed vowel or breathing, such as appears in
the last character of the group matsuhil. The reason why Pisiris erected his altar at Hamath rather than at Carchemish, is to be found in the fact that the former place was the abode of the
sacred scribes of the Hittite nation, who may also have con
stituted its priesthood. The Hittite first personal pronoun and verb substantive are contained in these inscriptions. The pronoun I is ne or ni, agreeing with the Lesghian na, the Basque ni, the Corean na, the Aztec ne, and many similar American forms. The Georgian
replaces it by ma, me, mi, in its various dialects, but the Japanese, which rarely employs personal pronouns, is quite unconformable save in its occasional use of mi, which is also found in the dialects of the Dacotah language along with the
form niah. The Hittite verb, to be, is /.('. In its Hittite state
of isolation it is best represented by the ca of the Aztec and Sonora dialects of America. But it is easily recognized in ki and h' forms of the Japanese ski, suriv, which although professedly meaning to do, like the Basque dut, has more frequently the sense
" The original Baal was Bela the son of Beor, the first king that reigned in Edoni, whose name as that of a deity was changed to Baal Peor before the Israelites entered Canaan.

of becoming, as in yashi, yasuru, be lean or become lean. The same form, doing double duty for to be and to do, may be detected in the Basque regular verbs falsely said to be conjugated without auxiliary. Thus erausi, to speak, becomes in the present indica
tive d'araus-kit, I speak; cV araus-kizu, thou speak est; d'araus-ki, he speaks ; and in the past, n'eraus-kian, I spoke; zen eraus-kmn, thou didst speak ; z'eraus-kian, he did speak. The Etruscan discards all the prefixes in d, etc., of the modern Basque, but
retains ki, kio, kian. What are these forms in ki ? Simply
variations of the original Hittite auxiliary, which, being affixed
to the present participle, and that is what a Hittite verb really
is, gives it either active or neuter value, according to the quality of the participle. Thus eraus-ki means literally, he is speaking,
which may be neuter enough ; but heriotz-ki, he is killing, is
quite active or transitive. The Basque verb thus answers exactly to the Japanese shi, and its forms ki and ke. That the Hittites must have had several other auxiliary verbs and other forms of the verb substantive, is undeniable. Happil}^ however, their most ancient inscriptions are not burdened with them. The consequence is that Hittite grammar is one of the simplest and most
rational in existence.



CHAPTER VII.
Historical Inscription of King Kenetala of Hamath.
Part I.
The inscriptions numbered Hamath iii. and v. contain the name of the Hamathite king, Kenetala, and present a connected
narrative, or at least two narratives with striking points of contact. The writer has had no opportunity of ascertaining, by examination of the stones themselves, the truth in the discrepancy between the statements of Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake and the Rev. William Wright, as to the connection of the two inscriptions. Mr. Wright's account connects Hamath v. with the votive Hamath iv. Mr. Drake's is to the effect that iii. and v. are on the side and front respectively of the same stone. The corres
pondence of characters on iii. and v., as well as the contents of
the inscriptions, favours Mr. Drake's statement. If, however, Mr. Wright's statement is the correct one, it will follow that all
the Hamath inscriptions formed part of the great altar of Baal
dedicated by King Pisiris. Some of the hieroglyphics in these
two inscriptions do not appear elsewhere, and parts of H. v. are so defaced that it would be at present unwise to attempt their restoration. Otherwise the language employed is coeval with and of the same character as that of the votive tablets. This is by no means so Iberic or Basque-like as that on the Moschian stone bowl, although the Basque connection of almost all the words can readily be indicated. In Hamath among the Kenite scribes, who may have given name to the Kannushi or native priesthood of Japan, it is natural to find the dialect of Yamato developing itself. It is not, therefore, astonishing to meet in these inscriptions with words and constructions almost
or entirely identical with those of the Japanese language as now written and spoken. The Japanese grammarians insist that their language has undergone but little change from the beginning of

their period, which they place in 660 B.C. The foreign Chinese element that pervades modern Japanese had, however, no place in the ancient documents of the empire. The story that Chinese letters were introduced into Japan in the third century of the
Christian era is evidently false, as the first historical connection of the Khitan with China cannot have been earlier than the seventh century. Yet the Chinese, as themselves a migrating people, may in ancient times have been in contact with branches of the Hittite family in the west, since the Persian historians place Chin, Machin and Katay between Persia and Hindustan. Ancient Indian documents mention the Chinas as aborigines of Hindustan and even enumerate them among the Kshattriyas or Indo Scyths.^ Dr. Edkins exhibits the relation of the Chinese to
the western countries of Asia, but places their migration from these at 3000 B.C.^ This great antiquity of the Chinese people in China not only contradicts the Persian writers, but also gives to the ancient Chinese a prehistoric character, and renders it
absolutely impossible to confirm the statements of their historians by those of any foreign document whatsoever. This is a convenient shield for fable, but it takes the early Chinese annals
out of the domain of historical science.
Hamath III.
The inscription Hamath iii. begins at the right hand corner of the first line, and thence proceeds in regular boustrophedon order to the end. In the preceding inscriptions a commencement was made on the left hand. The Hittites do not seem to have restricted themselves to any one direction in commencing an
inscription, the order of reading being as a rule sufficiently
indicated by the trend of the hieroglyphics, which are generally
to be read toward their backs. The first character in the upper
line is half obliterated, so that its syllabic value must be deter
mined from the text of Hamath v. The transliteration of the
inscription is as follows : Line 1, Kalehamakahaheha Kaba ata Hainata ka Kenetala: Line 2, Mata Kapesaka Antsu atsuta

niakaka sa haka Kaha Kalaka ne ha : Line 3, Sagane matsvme Kaha aginha ne matsiine altoka : Line 4, Kaha keha Katanesa katsu saki Damasakasanesa.
Literally translated, it renders : 1, Kaleba kills chief Kaba, King Hamath in Kenetala : 2, King Khupuscia Yanzu informs killing of, afterwards Kaba Kalaka to places : 3, Assyria to give Kaba army to to-give reinforcement : 4, Kaba, chief of-theHittites, conquers lord of-the-Damascenes. Read freely, the statement of the inscription is : " The CHIEF Kaba kills Kaleba. Yanzu, King of Khupuscia, informs King Kenetala in Hamath of the murder. Afterwards Kaba proposes to give Kalaka to Assyria (that Assyria may) give reinforcement to Kaba's army. The lord of the Damascenes conquers Kaba, the Hittite chief." The record is almost enigmatic in its brevity, and without aid from the Assyrian monuments would be hard to understand. Even with
that aid, .there is some difficulty in unravelling the twisted
threads of the different narratives. These narratives, in addition
to the Hittite text, are the inscriptions of Tiglath Pileser II., and Sargon, the former of whom' is mentioned in the books of Kings and Chronicles, and the latter in the prophecy of Isaiah.^
Tio-lath Pileser II. calls the King of Hamath in his time Eniel, and states that he received tribute from him, along with Rezin of Damascus, Pisiris of Carchemish, Hiram of Tyre, Menahem of Israel, and other kings. He also tells how he kept court at Damascus, where twenty-three subject monarchs came to pay homage, including Eniel and Pisiris, with Pekah of Israel, and Ahaz of Judah. Rezin was put to death before this time and the King of Tyre was absent. Was the Eniel of Tiglath Pileser the
Kenetala of the inscription ? It will be seen shortly that Hamath V. answers this question affirmatively by coupling his name with those of Rezin and Pekah, while the first line of that inscription contains the name of Pisiris. The common Assyrian rendering of Kenetala was Khintiel, the name of a king of the Lakai or ancient Lycians, preserved by Assur-nazir-pal.^ This, as has

already been indicated, is the Lydian royal name Candaules. There is a natural tendency to regard oriental names terminating in el as Semitic, and the words Eniel and Khintiel have been so regarded. But nobody dreams of making Candaules, Semitic. Rather has it been recognized that, as being the son of Myrsus and bearing along with the name Candaules that of Myrsilus, the linal syllable of the monarch's name denoted a son. So, in the ancient history of Cashmere, the son and successor of Hiranyakcha is Hiranyakula.'' In other Indian dynasties appear Kautil3'a, Sumalya and Kuntalas-wati. Among the royal names of the
Iberian Picts, Aniel, (^anuul, Deokil, Dereli, Tarla, are of the same
character. It is interestino- to find the Hamcithites in possession
of the consonant /., which their descendants, the Japanese, have lost, but not the Coreans. If the final el or il denoted a son or
child in some ancient dialect of the Hittite family, such a word as Khinti-el would be of the same formation as the Aegypto Hittite Zaiath-khirri, and Assyrio Hittite Sandu-arri, for the.se are renderings of the Hebrew Ben Zoheth, or rather Ben Zoheth
is the Hebrew form of the Hittite name which these represent. The I form may be detected in the Georgian sAwii, son, otherwise shiri, in the Circassian kaola, chvale, tshale, the Yeniseian jali, the Choctaw ella. It is by no means certain, however, that final
el or il had this meaning in Hittite. It is more important to consider the relation of the forms Eniel and Kenetala or Khintiel. The ke or Jchi was probably pronounced like the ( Jerman (^he in mnachen, so that the guttural might easily be changed to a simple aspirate. Then the concurrence of the two dentals, n and t, would inevitably lead, by a well-known process of phonetic decay, to the disappearance of one of them in pronunciation. Such a process appears in the Celtic word Gaoidheal, pronounced Gael. Either phonetic decay had set in among the people of Hamath, disguising the etymology of their king's name, or Tiglath Pileser's Assyrian scribe took an unwarrantable liberty with the royal word.
The Assyrian records do not chronicle the fate of Kenetala, but, in the second year of the reign of Sargon, the general and successor of Tiglath Pileser, we learn that his throne was occupied
'" Raja Tarang^ni. lib. i. si. 288.



82 THE HITTITES.
by a usurper named llubid. This Ilubid was in tlie town of Karkar, where he excited Arpad, Simyra, Damas and Samaria against Sargon. Sargon took Karkar and flayed Ilubid.^ Elsewhere in the same inscription we read : " The people of Kharkhar liad enforced Kibaba, the chief of the town, and had sent to Dalta of Ellip for submitting themselves. I occupied this town,
I delivered the prisonei-s, I installed those men whom my hand
had conquered. I put over them ray lieutenants as governors." This last Kharkhar seems to have been in Armenia in the vicinity of Media, Araxene, and Albania. Yet the name Kibaba connected with it and the very title, chief, agree with the keba Kaba, of Kalaka. Both chiefs were apparently friends of Assyria. One
difficulty is to reconcile the two cities Karkar and Kharkhar. The former, from its connection with Hamath, Arpad and Simyra, would seem to represent a Syrian Chalcis, of which there was one some distance to the north of Hamath, and another of less importance, almost as far to the south. The Hittite text favours a Chalcis, as the Karkar, by its form Kalaka, and plainly connects Kaba with the town as its captor and the slayer of its ruler,
Kalaba or Caleb. It looks as if the annalist of Sargon had confounded two distinct events, through the coincidence in the
names of tlie places in which the}' occurred. The second difficulty is chronological. Kibaba's fate of enforcement, whatever that may mean, took place, or is recorded as having taken place, in the reiofn of Sarajon, when Rezin and Pekah were dead and Pisiris was banished. But, in the Hittite record, Carchemish under Pisiris, Damascus under Rezin, and Israel under Pekah, togethei* with Hamath under Kenetala, were independent kingdoms. The record, therefore, must belong to the reign of Tiglath Pileser,
and to a tinu^ when Sargon, as his general, first came into relation
with thes^ monarchs and their states. To them the killing of Kaleba by Kaba was a matter of great importance. Indeed, it .seems to have been the cause of their revolt against Assyria that the renegade Hittite murderer should be befriended by that powerful empire. The chronological difficulty may be overcome and a synchronism established by supposing that the revolt took
place during the reign of Tiglath Pileser, resulting in the over

throw of Kaba by Kenetala and his allies, and the occupation of the city of Kalaka, Karkar, or Chalcis, the people of which sided with ihe enemies of the Hittite chief. The remnant of Kaba's forces were imprisoned in Kalaka, and Kenetala, djnng there, was succeeded by Ilubid, who remained in possession of the city.
Tiglath Pileser overcame E,ezin and put him to death, and Pekah was assassinated by Hoshea. Then, after the death of Tiglath
Pileser and the brief reign of Shalmanezer the sixth, Sargon took
Hamath, and, finding its King Ilubid in unlawful possession of
Kalaka, stormed that city, released the followers of Kaba, and put the Hamathite usurper to death. The taking of Kalaka or Karkar would thus be the last act in the groat tragedy of which the murder of Kalaba was the first. Of Kalaba, history saj^s nothing. If Kalaka represents the most famous Chalcis north of Hamath, its proximity to Helbon and the land of Chalybonitis is suggestive. The Charashim or
Cilices who gave name to Chalcis, Cilicia, Colchis, were of the
Kenezite division of the Hittite family, a division in which Caleb was a common name as far back as the time of Moses ; and, still
farther back, in old Egj^ptian days, Khilip-sira, the Hittite, fought
against the armies of Pharaoh. The connection of the chief Kaba with Sargon's chief Kibaba has alread}' been made. It is very unlikely that there were two chiefs so nearly alike in name in two distinct cities of the same name and in coiresponding
circumstances. The word keha, the chief, specially applied to Kaba, is a very common one in the inscriptions of the Khitan.
In the Eugubine insei'iptions it is one of the most fre([uently
recurring words in the form kiibe.'' It also appears in Celt
Iberian and in Pictish inscriptions, in Lat Indian and in Sil»erian.
In Japanese its form is kahi, kohe, head, in Basque, jia6e, jaube, lord. It seems to be the common property of all languages.
That the city seized by Kaba was Chalcis, the capital of Clialeidice, is confirmed by the statement that Yanzu of Khupuscia informed Kenetala of the fact. Khupuscia was the Hittite and Assyrian name of the famous city on the Euphrates called

84 THK HITT[TES.
Tiphsach by the Hebrews and Thapsacus by the Greeks. It was the capital of the country of the Hittite Nairi, its king being called by the Assyrians the King of the Nairi. The variation in the form of the name as presented by Hittites and Assyrians on the one hand, Hebrews and Greeks on the other, evidences that the root of the word is Pasach, the initial Khu and Tha beingsignificant prefixes. In migration the Pasach were the Abasgi of the Caucasus, but as Khupuscai they are also ('hapsoukes of the same region ; they became the Basques of Biscay in the Pyrenees, but also the Guipuscoans. The king of the Khupu.scai is in the text called Antzu or Hantzu. In the Annals of Sargon his name is given as Yauzu. Although the warlike Assyrian monarch overran the country of the Nairi, he did not treat Yanzu
as he had treated Rezin, Pisiris, and Ilubid, but left him in peace, merely imposing upon him a heavy tribute in oxen, horses and
lambs. Assyria is mentioned in the inscription by its common Hittite name Sagane, a word occurring so often in the inscriptions that it is impossible to err in translating it by the Assyrian name. The term may have been one of reproach, for in the only Hittite inscription intended for Assyrian e3^es the word Ashur is
employed. Yet, as will appear, in the lion inscription of Merash,
the word is used, although the evidence of the inscription is in
favour of friendly rather than hostile relations between its
author and the Assyrians. No conmion Hittite word suggests
itself to explain this term, which, like naki, zagi, may be of
Semitic origin. The Assyrian verb .sacana, to dwell, may have been taken l>y the Hittites to denote those who seemed to arrogate to themselves the sole right to occupy the land, and
whose dominion was well established, while that of other peoples was on the wane before them. Or the word may have been a Hittite compound of the Assyrian saku, either to denote theirpreeminence or the mountainous nature of their country. The termination ne, however, does not favour the latter view. Were it permissible to enter the region of abuse, the Basque could furnish many terms to correspond, such as zeken, mean, and zikin,
foul. The lion inscription appears to <^\clude any such rendering
of the word Sairane.

The conqueror of Kaba was the Lord of the Damascenes, namely, Rezin, who is spoken of in the next inscription as the chief ally of Kenetala. As the most prominent in the deed of retributive justice, which the Assyrians regarded as one of hostility to themselves, he was the first to suffer the vengeance of Tiglath Pileser. It is not easy to determine the ethnic rela
tions of the Damascenes. Their city was in existence in the time of Abraham, for his steward, Eliezer, was a native of it.* Its
name, Dammesek or Dannesek, points to a Japhetic origin in the line of Meshech, although Hebrew tradition connects it with Uz,
the son of Aram.*' Certainly it is not to be associated with the Moschi or later Meshech. who were not in existence in Abraham's time. The name of the Moschi, also, as given on the stone bowl, was Maishga, which answers better to the word written Meslia in our English Bibles, but which with medial yod and final ayin, should be read Meyeshag. The Book of Chronicles connects the Meyeshag with the Ma Reshah or Ma Reeshah, who aretheRosh that named Marasia or Merash in Asia Minor.^" It is thus a different word from Meshech. although the Bible writers employ the old Japhetic name to designate the Moschi, as they employ
the Japhetic Kittim in places to denote the later Hittites. The name Damascus, in itself, is no evidence of a Hamitic or Hittite origin. As the centre of a kingdom, Damascus was unknown until after the fall of the Hittite kingdom of Hamath Zobali, whose kings were Rehob and Hadadezer.^' The ancient line represented by them, and which came originally from the south where Hadad, the son of Bedad, Saul of Rehoboth, and Hadar,
ruled, appears to have transferred the seat of its empire to Damascus, for, according to Nicolas of Damascus, and Josephus, nearly all the kings of Syria Damascus bore the name Adad.^* The Hebrew record applies to three kings the name Benhadad, and to the present day one of the chief families in Damascus is the Beit Haddad.^^ This word Hadad has often been regarded

.IS Semitic, for the reason tliat every etymologist explains terms by the language with which he is best acquainted. Macrobius in his Saturnalia explains Hadad as meaning one, in the Syrian language, and Professor Sayce, referring to the passage, understands by Syrian, Hittite.^* The ancient Japanese hitotsu, Corean hotchim, hoten, Yeniseian hauta, hutcha, chuta, may be survivals of the early numeral. The evidence of tlie Etruscan monuments, however, favours jnmo, pirna, as the original Hittite number one.^'" Hadad was one of the most widely spread Khitan names. In India its chief form was Yadu, the name of a royal line to which Yudhishthira, an oriental Hadadezer, belonged. In Lydia, the Atyadae and Sadyattes preserved it. Macrobius makes Hadad to signify the sun as well as unity. Now, there is
no necessary connection between the two ideas, for while it is
true that there is only one sun. it is also true that there is only
(jne n^oon, one earth. It must, therefore, be mere coincidence that unites the meanings in one word. The Lesghian gede, with the Iroquois hiday, ahita, the Loo Chooan fida, and Sonora tat, are forms for the sun which may have arisen out of a word like Hadad. The Bas<|ue word for sun affords a possible solution of
the mystei-y. That word is egiozJci, iruzki, iduzJci. The first
form ^^us/ci, connects with erju'n,-^ day, and when that is said Its etymology is stated. But the other forms indicate two verbs,
erautsi, to spread, and edataen, h'ddtzen, to extend, as their
roots. Thus the sun is the far-reaching, widely-extending, ail
pervading, for erautsi is just our English word, reach. To recover the name Hadad, we have but to take the connnonest
form of kedatzen, which, as hedaiii, stretching, gives in the
Basque of to-day the ancient word. The Japanese, of course, has
the same root, but not so fully displayed. Its words, far-stretching,
extending, are todoku, todokeru, with which, as a coincidence,
tada, alone, may be compared. It is thus settled that Hadad is a Khitan, not a Semitic word. The name Rezin is of the same character. Thf l.sth Emiicror of Japan was Ritsiou, the 63rd,

Reizen, the 70th, Go-Reizen." Other Syrian names, such as Hazael and Naaman, show Khitan origin. Thus Hazael may be hezaula, a pillar, post, stake ; and Naaman may be Naimen, the power of will. Whatever the original population of Damascus may have been, it is evident that the royal line overthrown by
Tiglath Pileser was Hittite. For four hundred and fifty years
that line remained in obscurity, and then, in 255 B.C., it suddenly emerged as the Parthian dynasty of eastern conquerors, replacing the old names Hadad, Hadadezer, and Rezin, with their equiva
lents Diodotus, Tiridates, and Arsaces.^^ On a coin of Arsaces XII. occur the words, Basileos basileon Arsakau megalou, dikaiou, euergetou, theou eupatoros philellenos, which Noel Humphreys correctly translates : " Of the king of kings, Arsaces, the great^
the just, the beneficent, the illustriously born, the lover of the
Greeks." But he does not translate the words in a strange alphabet written at the base of this inscription in two lines from right to left. That strange alphabet is identical with the Etruscan and Celt Iberian, and the reading of the characters is: beha hitz, ome haka, Orofu, behold the word, the peculiar
name, Orodes.^^
" Friend of the Greek, fair fell the mould That veiled thy stater's glittering."
It veiled more than the sheen of the gold, leaving the world in ignorance for almost two thousand years of the fact that the Hittites disputed with Rome the empire of the world, as they had disputed it in ancient times with Egypt aitd Assyria. The peculiarly Japanese words in this short inscription are atsuta and katsu. The former is in Japanese fsufai, transmit, with which is connected tsudasu, communication, information. Its probable Basque equivalent is edausi, which combines eusi, ausi, an old verb, to speak, with edatii, hedatw, extend. At
present edausi is used in the sense of gossiping, but its ancient meaning appears to have been spreading speech or communicating information. The other word is katsu, which still means in
17 Titsingh, Annales. 18 It is doubtful that Arsaces represents Rezin ; it is rather, like .\rish and Araxes, a form of Ma Reshah, behjnging to a different Hittite tribe. 1^ Humphrey's Coin Collector's Manual, vol. 1, plate 7, opi>. ]>. 13t>.



88 THE HITl'ITKS.
Japanese, to conquer, defeat, excel. In Bascjue the present word of tlie same signification is garaitu, a verbal form of garai, excellent. But M. Van Eys in his Basque Lexicon says that the
primitive meaning of garai was not excellent, but high.-^ Now the siujplfst and commonest Basque word for high is go, so that in antiquity the Basques no doubt possessed a verb gotu, gotzen, which has been replaced by garaitu, garaitzen, and which cauie
from the same Hittite source as the ver}) katsu. A somewhat similar form is found in a Celt Iberian inscription in which we read Sipi Erroiiiac olnien goegl, " Scipio makes high the might of the Romans," by which is meant that he conquered the enemies of Rome.^^ The vei'b mdka or makaka means to kill, in many Khitan languages, and is intimately connected with the verb, to die. Thus the Georgian mokluli, die, is the Aztec ndclia, kill, while the Aztec miqiii, die, is the Sonora and Shoshonese muHH, Tiieca, kill. In Japanese, maka-i^hi means to beat, conquer, and
riiaka-ri to die. But the radical appears in Basque as raaka, makatu, to strike. The primitive meaning of death in the
Hittite mind was a stroke, blow. In this inscription occurs, for
the first time, a woixl several times repeated in the Hittite documents, aginba, an army. The temptation is strong to connect it
with the Japanese gwmhigo, an army, derived from (grwii, military. It does not seem, however, that gun is a native word. The Japanese word of which it is a synonym is i/i:t/.sa, related to ikun, command. In modern Basque, agin, agindu is the verb, to command, and agin-tza.ri. chief of command, denotes a military officer. The Eugubine Tables employ agin frequently to denote an army, just as an English officer, speaking of hisconnnand, means there})y
the force or troops under his authority. The Hittite usage
strengthened the idea by calling an army agivh" or a place of
conunand.

CHAPTER VIII.
Historical Inscription of King Kenetala of Hamath.
Part II.
This mutilated document, entitled Hamath v., begins in the
middle of the top line, reading- from left to right, and continues through lines 2 and 8 in boustrophedon order ; but line 4 reads from left to right, like line 3, maintaining, however, the boustrophedon order in line 5. It is hard to account for this freak of
the scribe, unless we suppose that he desired to end the inscrip
tion for some reason in the right half of the last line. The first
line is hardly worth counting in the inscription, first, because it
is the common formula of Pisiris, and secondly, because it is
incomplete, and, so far as our copy goes, fails to yield sense in the latter part. It reads : Ke ne mata matanesa, nabasanesa ne
sari Pisa II Makara ke ne go saki. Rendered literally it is :
Am I king of kings, of lords, I leader Pisa II Maka to am I go I
the chief. It is doubtful that the character read il is such, and something is apparently wanting between ke. ne and saki to give significance to go. The r<i following Maka is a synonym of ne,
the Basque post-position, to. The ne over the yoke or ri in sari
is superfluous. What remain.s is the old formula : I am the king
of kings, the lord of lords, Pi.sa. The presence of the formula is
doubtless a recognition of the suzerainty of Carchemish, for the a,uthor of the inscription seems to have been the King of Hamath. Beginning at the right hand corner of the second line, the
transliteration is as follows : Line 2, Sa ka Hamafa Kenetala Retesine taneha nan kulo Retesine vagoba kida Damosuka'nesa, kanene Peka Remallke ko
yaki Batiiel.

In accord is Pekah, son of Remaliah, the lord OF Bethel. Dahaka, King of the Patini ans, agrees with Kenetala to succour the city of the late Kalaba. Mansakaba, KiN(i OF Nikdera, (agrees) with Kenetala of the Hamathites to succour Kalaka of the late Kalaba. I desire the leadkr of the army to come to Khupuscia, to THE King of Khupuscia. To overthrow the murderer of Kalaba, comes the neighbour of Yanzu, Makaba of the Ankatatsu. To destroy the disturber, comes Batsu of the Tahasi, to give the death blow to the hostile lord. It is evident that the above is the record ot" an alliance which,
although ostensibly formed against the murderer Kaba, was intended to oppose the Assyrian power. Tliat Kenetala, Rezin, Yanzu, and their Hittite neighbours, might fitly league them
selves against the slayer of their countryman and friend, none can doubt ; but what was Pekah of Israel doing in the quarrel ? His presence shows that Kalaba's murder was a pretext for raising the standard of independence in Syria and Palestine. The confederates went to war with their eyes open, foi* Hamath iii. lias shown tlieir knowledije of the fact that Kaba had made

over Chalcis to Assyria, and had sent for reinforcements in retuni.
It is natural to think that the strong city of Chalcis, as a barrier against Assyrian aggression instead of a garrison of Tiglath
Pileser's army, was a greater attraction to the confederates than the desire of avenging the defunct Kalaba, and simply delivering his subjects from the usurpation of Kaba. By its position it commanded the approach to that portion of Syria in which the
kingdoms of the conspirators were situated, so that its occupation by an enemy would place them at his mercy. The tirst ally mentioned is Retezine or Rezin of Damascus. Already in Hamath iii. he has been alluded to as the saki or lord of the Damascenes, and as the conqueror of Kaba. He was, therefore, the generalissimo of the allied armies of Syria and Israel. His warlike achievements are celebrated in the Book of Kings.^ The Hittite <iocument furnishes a valuable piece of information regarding his kingdom, by stating that he added the City of Rezin to that of Damascus. This cannot have been Resaena on the Chaboras in Mesopotamia, although that city,
planted in a peculiarly Hittite region, had no doubt the same verbal signiiication. The Syrian Rezin is unmentioned in the
Bible, or in the writings of Josephus and the classical geographers. Looking for its site in the area of Arabian occupation, the natural question to ask is. What do the Arabs call the known Resaena of Mesopotamia ? The answer is, Ras el Aien. " Ras el Aien," says Sadik Isfahan!, " a place in Diar Rabia."- Now Ras el Aien, as the head of the spring, is a very common name in the east. Its
application in this case illustrates the tendency to make foreign names signiticant, which has beeu a source of endless trouble and
confusion to the ethnologist. The unknown Rezin was distorted into the known Ras el Ain. There is a Ras el Ain near Tyre and another near the site of Antipatris in Samaria, but these do
not satisfy the conditions of the Dama.scene kingdom. Close to
Baalbec or Heliopolis, however, is a heap of ruins called Ras el Ain, suppo.sed to denote the fountain that supplied the great city
of the sun with water.^ It is very probable that this city, lying

92 THE HITTITES.
Avitliiii the territory of Rezin, and the most important next to
Damascus in that tei'ritory, is the one that received the conqueror's name, and tliat Ras el Ain, as in Mesopotamia, is an Arabic corruption of the name Resaena. The only doubtful competitor for the honour of perpetuating the Syrian king's
memoi-y is Rhose of Peutinger's Itinerary, which replaces the Neve of that of Antoninus. Assuming these to denote the same place, we find them representing the present Nowa on the borders of Ituraea and Gauloriitis, and about a day's journey from Damascus. There are ruins of antiquity in its vicinity, but they
are insignificant compaied with those at Ras el Ain.
The initial character in Pekah's name is peculiar to this
inscription and is parth' defaced, but the name of his father
Remaliah, and that of his sacred cit}' Bethel, are so well defined
that there can be no doubt this intimate friend of Rezin, whose alliance with him is recorded alike by the Hebrew and Assyrian
historians, is the person set forth by the tablet.'* Unfortiinately
materials are at present wanting to explain why the Bible con
stantly associates the name of Pekah with that of his father, Remaliah. The latter is not elsewhere mentioned, but the theory of Gesenius that he was a private and ignoble person, and that Pekah was termed Ben Remaliah in contempt, is refuted l>y the Hittite document which also calls him Remaliah's son.-'' The
fact that Pekah's parentage alone is given in this inscription, the object of which must have been to celebrate the names of the
confederate princes, rather indicates some special distinction pertaining to Remaliah. It is very unlikely that Remaliah is a Hebrew word. The Philistine Ramleh, Armenian Aramale, and Latin R(miulus, suofffest an Aryan connection of the name. It does not follow, because Pekah was a captain in Pekahiah's army, that he was an Israelite, for by far the greater number of the
captains of King David, even, were foreigners. He may, therefore, have been a younger son in some Aryan royal family, who had left the court of his well-known father to take service mider the kings of Israel. That he was an alien appears to beimlicated
l»y his alliance, contraiy to all the Israelite traditions, with

Damascus, Hainath and Thapsacus ; for Jeroboam II., one of his predecessors, had conquered the former two for Israel, and Menahem, whose son he slew and succeeded, had treated Thapsacus
with barbaric cruelty.*^ Pekah is called the Lord of Bethel, although he reigned in Samaria, because Bethel was the sanctuary of Isi-ael, as Hamath was the sanctuary of the Hittites. The next ally mentioned is Dahaka, King of Pitane. The name Pitane doubtless denotes the Patinai of the Assyrian
monuments, whom Professor -Sayce, in his Hittite map, places to the north of Antioch. They were thus to the north-west of Chalcis, and near the border of the Cilicians, to whom they seem to have been allied in race ' The Patinians are often mentioned
by the Assyi-ians, and Professor Sayce has collected from these
^
notices the names of several of their kings, Lubarna, Sapalulvi Girparuda, Matuzza, Sasi, Surri, Lubarna II., and Tutamu."* Dahaka does not appear atnong these names, and the only name ike it in the annals of Tiglath Pileser and Sargon is that of Dayaukku, who was the prefect of Van in Armenia.'' Yet the Patinian character of the name Dahaka seems established by the connection of " the men of Khilakki and Duhuka" in an inscription of Esarliaddon.^*^' The name Dayaukku has been compared with the Median Deioces, and both names find their origin in the Turanian Zohak or Dahak of Persian story. That the later Medes may have been Aryans cannot, perhaps, be denied, but that Deioces and his people were such is refuted by his very name as well as by those of Arbaces, Artynes, Astyages, and Cyaxares. The first is the Hittite Arba or Arbag, the next Ardon, the third a reproduction of Deioces with the prefix Ash, as in Ash Dahak or Zohak, and the last is, niirahile dicta, Sagara of Carchemish.^^ Still another ally is Mansakaba, King of Nekutera.

Samas Rimmon, in relating his victories over the Hittite Nairi, mentions Kliirtsina, the soil of Migdiara, who had 800 cities and eleven fortresses in the land of Sunbai, which is placed between Khupuscai and Manai, the latter being the Minni of Van.^-^ There is thus reason for supposing that the Idian land covered an extensive area, from Mygdonia in northern Mesopotamia northeastward to the shores of Lake Van, and thatNekutera, Nikdora, or Nigdiara, was its capital. The Etruscan and primitive Italian
names Incitaria, Nicotera, Angitulae, Anhostatir, reproduce Nekutera, generally in connection with the name Hasta.^^ The Idians, Yahdians, Astians, as they were variously called, were the leading tribe of the Hittites, and Carchemish was probably
one of their foundations. Among the- Turanian tribes of Liguria,
the Celtic tables of the Eugubine inscriptions enumerate twM)
divisions of this stock, the Jovies Hostatir and the Anhostatir.
These are the Astian Oxybii, and the Anhostes oi- Vennostes. The latter must be the descendants in part of the Nikderians and Nigdimians of the As.syrians ; the former, as Oxybii, came from the Yatsubi or Yasibi, who, in the time of Sennacherib, dwelt near Albania.^'' The name of the Nekuterian kingis Mansakaba,

through the information imparted by Aristaeus, are linked in the storj of Herodotus with the Italian Metapontum.-" The Yebis or Ainos of Nossabou or Amossibe, are degraded Messapian Japyges.-^ In America the name is divine among the Dacotahs as Wakaghapi. The Messapians and Amossibes live again in Southern California as the Mojeves or Amockhaves of the Yuma family, w^ho apply the name epatch to their brother Indians, but call every man of their own tribe metapaei. They look for the return of Montezuma, whom they worship, like the Pueblo Indians of Arizona and New Mexico, wdiose waiting fires are ever burning for his coming.^- Nor with Mexico, where at least two historical Montezumas reigned, do the ancient name and its traditions end. The Chibchas or Muyscas of New Granada worshipped the ancestral hero as Nemquetheba ; and to the Peruvians he w^as Manco Capac, the progenitor of their race.^-^ It is doubtful if throughout the world, apart from Christian teaching, there can be found a name so widely spread in tradition and tribal and
geographical nomenclature. Mansakaba, though bearing so illustrious a name, has no other record than this inscription. A similar name to Mansakaba is that of Makaba, king of the Ankatatsu. It may also be compared w^ith that of Maggubi, king of the Madakhirians, whom Shalrnanezer on the Black Obelisk mentions after the- Khupuscians, as if they might be neiohbours."^* However, Shalmanezer was long before Makaba,

and Ankatatsu is not Madakliiri. The second part of the nanie^ Anka-tatsu is the Japanese verb tachi, tatsu, to stand up, but in
Hittite possessing also transitive power. Its Basque equivalent is the verbal termination fatu, tatsen, as in hegis-tatu, naris-tatu,
to look, to reward, literally, to set an eye, to set a reward. What is the anha that was set up by this people ^ There is reason to think that it was the palm tree. The region between Hebron and the Dead Sea, where Amorites and Hittit&s contended in the days of Abraham, bore two names, Hazezon Tamar and Engedi. The first word is Semitic and means " the pruning of the palm "; and Aingedi, if Semitic, means " the fountain of the kid." Is
Engedi necessarih' Semitic ( There is a spring or fountain there, but so there is in almost every place that men have chosen for habitation. In the time of Jerome, Engedi was a place of some
note, and, three centuries before, Josephus mentioned it as the
seat of one of the chief toparchies of Judaea.-^^ Pliny, however, who completed his Natural History soon after the fall of Jerusalem, says nothing of the fountain of the kid, but speaks of " the town of Engadda, once only inferior to Jerusalem in fertility
of soil and groves of palms ; now, like it, a heaf) of ashes.'"^** How came Pliny to know about the palms, since the name of Hazezon Tamar was departed '. The name was in existence before Israel entered the land of promise, and a town was there. »Solomon alludes to its vineyards, but does not bring the fountain of the kid into his imagery.-" Cyprus was originally a Hittite country, and famous among western regions for its palms and vines. In the time of Esarhaddon there was a city in that island which he calls Amtikhadasta, very like an Assyrian con-uption of Ankatatsu.'^ The whole island of Cyprus was called Yahnagi accord
ing to the Assyrians. Now the initial letter of Aingedi is ayiv,
which the Greeks often rendered by gartiimi, so that in sound and transliteration the word varied according to the speaker as Gingedi, Haingedi, Yangedi. It is not to be supposed, however, that Ankatatsu was in Cyprus. It was Hittite, and in the time

of Samas Rimmon may have been either Ginkhidai or Ginkhukhtai, both of which he makes states of the Nairi without settling their locality.-^ Sargon mentions a region, Sinukhta, which he took away from its king, Kiakku, and gave to the King of Atuna ; and his predecessor, Tiglath Pileser, brings into close proximity
Nuqudina, Atinni and Hamath.^*^ A final reference to the Assyrian records shows that in the time of Sennacherib, a southern branch of this family, the Nakindati, dwelt in Elam, their capital being Tagab Lishir. Assurbanipal found them in the same region, but calls them Nakidati.^^ The Hittite text says that the Ankatatsuk were neighbours, literally, at the gate, of Yanzu of Khupuscia. The only neighbours the Thapsacans could have on the west were the inhabitants of Palmyra, for the rest of the country was desert. In ancient Hebrew days, Tadmor, a synonym for Tamar, the palm, was the name of this oasis. Solomon took Hamath Zobah and built Tadmor in the wilderness, and it became a caravan station, with Damascus on one side and Thapsacus on the other, for the great
trade that the wise monarch of Israel opened up with the distant
east.^^ Had Solomon any predecessors in Tadmor ? Were its palms a wild native growth, or had human labour been bestowed upon them ? Botanists tell us that most palms need moisture ;
did anv skilled hands irrioate their roots and add to nature's care ? ^^ When Solomon's northern empire was lost with the rise of Syria Damascus, who cared for Tadmor and led the caravans from Damascus to Thapsacus ? History is silent, unless it speaks now through the inscription of King Kenetala. In Ezra and Nehemiah are found three families that returned from captivity in Babylon and are mentioned together, the children of Rezin, of Nekoda, of Paseah.^* They were not Israelites but Nethinim, the children of Solomon's servants, whom he had doubtless employed in his caravan trade. The children of Nekoda could not even show that they had any connection with Israel. Longing

to get back to the palm trees of their Syrian home, they came as the stowaways of Israel's crew. These passages of the Hebrew scribe and courtier reveal the existence of a city of Rezin more clearly than does Ras el Ain, and warrant us in placing between the transported Damascenes and tlio Pasachites of Thapsacus, the children of Nekoda, who could only have dwelt in Tadmor in the wilderness. Unhappily the Hittites were removed to lands in which palms do not flourish, so that their vocabularies can afford but doubtful information as to what their word for the palm tree was. Among the Aztecs one kind of palm bore the name nequa-metl, the termination onefl denoting the maguey or American agave. The Japanese call the date natsume, but yanagi, which, if it meant a palm, would settle the matter, denotes the willow, feathery in its way, but producing no fruit. Nor does the Basque help much,
although its words iiiaz, a fern, U7itz, ivy, unJci, a tree stump^
and inzatvr, a nut, are suggestive. Most of the Iroquois words denoting trees and vegetation begin with on or ohn, such as
ohneta, pine, onenta, fir, onatsia, corn, onenste, maize, ohontC' grass, onerate, foliage, onenha, almond, onenhare, vine ; and the birch, which in its yarious uses replaces in cold climates the palm of southern regions, is onake, answering in form if not in meaning to the Japanese yanagi. The root appears in Choctaw as anih, enih, to bear fruit, grain, berries, etc.; and the Yeniseian enahai
and Yukahirian yungid, a forest, ^plantation, like the Iroquois onashia, point to vegetation in the form of trees as the meaning of anka. Again anke is the Lesghian word for wheat, and untsha for barley. The Circassian has san, wine, sanahslt, grape,
sanehtshee, vine ; ayen also is a Basque word for vine. Among the Turanian tribes of Northern India, who may in part be regarded as a remnant of ancient Hittite occupation, the name
for the plantain, their most familiar tree, is ungsye. gnaksl,
gnosi.^^ All of these terms point to the Hittite word Anak,
whose initial ayin, as in Engedi, satisfies the conditions required

by the vaiying forms anka, yanagi, gnak. In such forms however as nequa, Nekoda, Nuqudina, the absence of some equivalent for the initial o.yin can only be explained as a corruption of
speech resulting from ignorance of the original signification of the word. If anak in Hittite meant a palm, it would be a fitting
designation for the men of lofty stature in whose presence the Israelite spies were as grasshoppers. The abode of these Anakim in or near Hebron would also justify a connection of their name with the place called Engedi by the Hebrews.^*^ The district in which Palmyra lies is now called Antoura. There, linger traditions of Antar, the Arabian hero ; and, near at hand among the mountains of Lebanon, dwelt the Ansarians, whom Burckhardt regarded as a tribe expelled from India, and whose peculiar idolatry points them out as the remains of a primitive Syrian race.^' What connection these names have with the ancient Ankatatsu is hard to determine. That a Hittite tribe and family existed which nourished fruit trees and derived much of their sustenance from them, like the African Garamantes and Lotophagi, is capable of proof. Among the Scythians of Herodotus appear the baldheaded ArgijDpaeans, who lived on the fruit of a tree called Ponticum, which they made into cakes, and from which they expressed a drink called "aschy." Under these trees or round about them they erected their tents in winter, thus apparently protecting the tree from frost. They
were a sacred race and acted as arbiters in the quarrels of the Scyths. As Professor Rawlinson has indicated, they are called Arimphaeans by Pliny and Pomponius Mela, and as both of these writers place them in the neighbourhood of the Riphaean mountains, there is e'ood reason to think that their name is the most
correct of the two, and that the true name of the sacred race lies between Riphae and Arimphae.^^ Wheeler, after Heeren, identifies the Argippaei with the Calmucs of Tartary, who make a similar use of the bird cherry.^^ Philology here partly favours

the Hittite connection and partly opposes. The Cabnucs occupy what was an original Hittite region, but their language is
Mongolian, which the Hittite language was not. But, on the other hand, these Calmucs call themselves Derben Oeroet, the
four allies or brothers, which are "the tribes Derbet, Torgot,
Choshot, Sungar. The latter tribe has a legend that their great ancestor, being left as a child under a tree, was nourished by the sap which the intelligent tree caused to exude from a branch bent down over his mouth. ^^ We have not found Anak, but we have found his father, Arba, in the various forms Argippaei, Arimphaei, Riphaei, Derben, and Derbet. Just as Herodotus makes Targitaus, the mythic Scythian, the father of Leipoxais, Arpoxais,
and Colaxais, and represents the first as the progenitor of the Auchatae, so tribal nomenclature in Tartary unites the names and establishes the validity of barbarian tradition.*^ For Targitaus is reproduced in Torgot : Arpoxais lives again in Derbet from derhen, four, the Hebrew Arba, Arbag : Colaxais is represented by Chalcha or Kalka, a name of the tribe from which the Choshots are derived : and the Auchatae are these same Choshots
or Hoshoits, as they are sometimes called. As in Europe there are Latinized Etruscans, Iberians, and Celts, Germanized Celts, Ugrians, and Sclaves, so in Tartary the Calmucs are Mongolized
Hittites.
America also has its fruit-loving tribes. When De Soto crossed the Missis.sippi near Chickasa Bluff, gaily decorated natives
brought him presents of fish, and loaves made of the fruit of the persimmon.*^ These were doubtless members of what Mr. Gatschet, in his elaborate memoir, calls the Maskoki family,
including the Alibamu and Koassati or Coosadas.*^ The latter represent the Choshots of the Derben Oeroet, and the former are the Arba Kita. The derivation given for Alibamu is alba, a
thicket, and ayaniule, I clear ; thus the Alibamu are the clearers
of the land or cultivators. De Soto met with the Indian chief Alimamu, whose name stands for the tribe, west of Chickasa, but

the (yhoctaw legends place the giant agricultural and peace-loving nahullo, who should represent them, to the east of the Mississippi.
The absence of the letter r in most of the Maskoki dialects accounts for the change of Arbato Alba. The very word "aschy," that the Argippaei of Herodotus called their beverage, made from the fruit of the Ponticum, is the asahua or cJiicha which
the Peruvians made out of corn, pineapples, plantains, and other
vegetable products.^^ Its root is probably identical with that of
the Maskoki Choctaw verb ishkoh, to drink. The real derivation
of the word Arba or Arbag, giving force to the final ayin, is doubtless to be found in the lengthened modern Japanese form araki-bari, breaking up wild land, in which arahi represents the root ara, wild, rough, and hari, an old verb with the signification of the modern harashi, to clear away. There is a Japanese verb barashi, to break, but many Japanese words in h originally began
with a labial, so that hare, harashi may be regarded as a moditi
cation of a primitive 6are. To get back the bag of Arbag, replace hare or bare by baki, now haki, which means to sweep away ; and in ara-baki, the sweeping away of wildness, the old Hittite Arbag is restored. The Maskoki etymologists evidently knew the meaning of the Alibamu name, but not its constituents. Nor are these easy to find. Even in Basque the root ara is only
found in such words as irha-zain, literally, forest guard, irasagar, wild or rough apple, a quince. That language, however, has a synonym in Intz, rough, coarse, rude, evidently of the same origin. This does not appear in the Choctaw Maskoki languages^ which use lukchuk, mud, muddy, to denote wildness, as in livkchuk ahe, wild potato. This lukchuk is the Basque lohitsu, muddy. It would seem as if the Choctaws had taken their ideas of wild land from a swamp. ' Their ^^ord, to sweep, also is compound, being bushpolih, derived from bushah, cut, mown,
ploughed, etc. Another illustration of the change in signification in the same root is the Choctaw honayo, wild, but the Basque oihan, forest. It is evident, therefore, that the Choctaws have
merged an original root ala or la, meaning rough, crude, wild, in another, hla, la, le, meaning wet, whence lussah, a swamp; wild land.
** Peruvian Antiquities, 198.



102 THE HITTITES.
Before dismissing the Aukatatsu or Anakim of Kirjath Arba, whom we have followed so far into the western world, it is worth while to note two indications of their presence in ancient times
in the region of Palmyra. One of these is the place called Oruba or Oriza, now Sokhne, which the classical geographers set down under the mountains directly to the north of the city of Pahns.
This is a reminiscence of Arba. An older authority, the poet Homer in his Odyssey, has a passage which more than all others puzzled the Greek commentators and was the despair of Strabo. It is that in which Menelaus, describing his wanderings, says
:
"I came to the land of the ^Ethiopians, Sidonians, and
Erembians."'*^ Before these he mentions Cyprus and Phoenicia
;
and by Ethiopia the commentators are agreed that he means Joppa on the Philistine coast. To explain the word Ererabi they
propose many different readings, which incline on the one hand to identify the people mentioned with the Arameans of Syria, on the other to make them Arabians. The fact that the
poet places the Erembi after the Sidonians, who dwelt not far to the south-west of Palmyra, and the similarity of the words Erembi and Arimphaei, tend to identify them with the line of Arba, whose name in the time of king Makaba was superseded by that of his son Anak. These two names, with a lar<;e number of others belonging to the same division of the Hittite race, are constantly connected with agriculture in its various forms and products. That Canaan became a land flowing with milk and
honey, or, in other words, a region of grass and flowers, was no
doubt due largely to the labours of these Hittite pioneers, who caused even such a desert as Palmyra to rejoice and blossom as
the rose.
The last mentioned of the allies of Kenetala is Batsu, or it may be Tsuba, of the Tahasak. Neither he nor his people find a place in the annals of Tiglath Pileser and Sargon, but Assurnazir-pal probably denotes Tahasa by the city of Tuskha, to which he makes frctjuent i-eference.*^ He connects it with Ka.syari, Nirdun, Nirbie, Auzi, and Sigisa, which are Assyrian forms of the Hebrew Geshur, Ardon, Arba, Anak, Sheshai, and appears to

include them all in the territory of the Nairi. The king of the
region containing these places in the time of Assur-nazir-pal was
Labduri, the son of Dubisi or Dubuzi, a term that aflbrds little help even as a family name, since Tsuba may be the original of
its first two syllables, and Batsu of its two last. The Tuscan name in comparative geography is almost confined to Italy, where Tuscania, Tusculum, and Tusculanum denoted the presence of a Turanian people. In the Umbrian tables of the Eugubine
inscriptions, the Tuscer are made the leading division of the Etruscans, the other two being the Naharcer and the Japuscer. Dascylium and Dascylitis of Mysia may be compared with Tusculum and Tusculanum, and the Mysian name luay claim kindred with that of the Maeotae of the Sea of Azov, among whom Strabo places the Dosci. The Hittite form Dahasa best suits Dausa-ra on the Euphrates above Thapsacus and immediately opposite Chalcis. In migration the Dahasak may have been the Dahae, whom Strabo, placing above the Maeotis, seems to identify with the Dosci, and from whom he derives the horde which under Arsaces overthrew the Greeks in the east and founded the Parthian empire in the middle of the third century, B.C.*'' These people are mentioned in the book of Ezra under the name Dehaye, in our English Bible, Dehavites, as constituting part of the imported Gentile population of Samaria.*^
They are probably the Dasyus of the Indian writers, a race devoutly hated by the Aryan Brahmans.'^^ Among Hittite words calling for remark is sa, the third personal pronoun. In Basque it has been displaced by the modern hura, as a separable word, but is easily recognized in the common prefix of verbs in the third person singular, such as zuen, zuela, zuqueyen, zezan, as compared with nuon, nuela, mtqueyen, nezan of the first. In Japanese the demonstratives, which do duty for the third personal pronoun, are a, lea, ko and
so, the latter being the original Hittite word. This third pronoun
in s occurs in Georgian as is, eja, in Circassian as slsha, in Lesgh
ian as djo, in Corean as tsa, in Dacotah as ish, in Sonora as serei, sinu, in Muyscan as as, in Chileno as sas. A common Khitan

form is that presented by the Circassian arr, Mizjejian jer, Georgian alle, Basque hura, Yeniseian bari, Japanese Jcare, LooChooan ori, Iroquois ra, re, ro, Dacotah aar, lailai, Sonora ar, uaharl, Pueblos looko, and Cayubaba Peruvian are. It does not
appear in the Hittite inscriptions. The verb ha, to place, occurs in hane, taneba, nagoha. It is represented in the infinitive form in modern Basque by ipi-ni or imi-ni, the final ni being the postposition ne, to. In Etruscan, imii or mi is its usual form. The infinitive form in Hittite is given in bane. In tane-ba the Japanese tanomi, meaning at once, to ask, and, trust, dependence, must be found, and this word combines the significations of the Basque itan, iiandii, to ask, and adin, good understanding or agreement. Literall}' toMe-ba is to place accord or confidence.
The similar verb iiago-ba consists of ba, to place, and nago, the
Hittite original of the Basque nas, nahas, together, and the Japanese naka, between, which in composition also means together, as in nakama, a company, nakarai, marriage, both of which denote union. Another verb, kanene, ganene, occurs twice in the inscription. As a verb its nearest Basque equivalent is
ganatcea, to attract, the root of which is the postposition gan, at, to, towards. In Etruscan both gan and ra, meaning towards, are converted b}^ the addition of 7ie and none, as ganne, ranone, into verbs signifying to approach, side with, yield to. Such a verb is kanene. Japanese has lost the postposition gan, but retains the •
verb kanai, to agree with, accord, be in harmony. The short word ko, a son, following Remalike, as in the Bowl
Inscription of Babylon it follows Sennacherib, is peculiarly
Japanese. Its literal meaning is young, small, child, and, in the
sense of son, it occurs in the Lat Indian and Siberian inscriptions.
It is the Circassian kkoh, Georgian f^kua, Koriak akek, ikitku, son, the Lesghian gaJte, boy, the Corean liala, and Iroquois axaa, child, and the Lesghian koka, small. The root appears in the Basque gazte, young. Twice in reference to Kalaba the adjective haka is employed. This is the Basque old, former, late, with which
ahukii, a funeral, connects. So in Japanese, okuri, a funeral,
connects with oku, behind, late, departed, the root of which seems
to be yiiku, iku, to go, depart. Twice also one of the commonest
words in Etruscan inscriptions is used, babe or pabe, to help, aid,



HISTORICAL INSCRIPTION OF KING KENETALA OF HAMATH. 105
its modern Basque forms being paba, bahese, support, protection.
In Japanese it is ahai, to protect, defend. Japanese vei'bs ending
in ai and au are euphonic variations in almost all cases of originals terminating in a labial, so that the primitive abau must have been ababa. In the fourth line the city name Khupuscia is abbreviated to Kupusa or Kabesa. The general agreement of the word and the context alone indicate that Khupuscia is still meant. The verb elne, twice repeated, is the
Basque el, eldio, eltzen, to come, the Choctaw elah, and Aztec vallavJi. It is perhaps to be found in the Japanese aruki, to
walk, the Corean kor, kiilin, and Koriak chelchit, to go. The Basque verb to walk is ib-illen, which, besides confirming the
Choctaw connection as corresponding to its bai-ellih, also gives
in illen or ellen the Hittite original. It is hard to say whether the two characters lendered negai should be read thus or as nahiga. As negai we have the Japanese verb, to desire ; as nahiga, a compound of the Basque nahi, with the same meaning. The expression il atatzuko means a murderer in the literal sense of a death striker, il meaning dead, and ko being the Hittite mark of agency. In Etruscan the mark of agency is sa, and in modern Basque, ille, while in modern Japanese ya and shi perform the same office. It is probably demonstrative in origin and may be represented by the Japanese tori-ko, a prisoner, tana-ko, a tenant, and the Basque mende-ko, azpi-ko, a slave,
ararte-ko, a mediator, elkar-go, a company, lenia-ko, a helmsman,
gezurrez-ko, a liar. The verb atatsu seems to be the original of
the Japanese tataki, to strike, a reduplicate form of tsuki, to stab,
pierce. It is hardly recognizable in the Basque jotzen, to strike,
connected in the same way with josi, to pierce. Initial t in the
Khitan, as in the Gaelic division of the Celtic languages, exhibits a tendency to disappear or be converted into a sibilant. Thus the Gaelic teine, a fire, is pronounced cheine, and the same is the
case with the English and French word attention in its last syllable. The Basque verbal ending, tatu, tatzen, represents
sometimes the verb jaso, to raise, and at others, egotze, to throw.
Similar to these is jotzen, to strike, fight.
The word atakaka has been translated neighbour. If the initial a is an essential part of the word, which the figure made



106 THE HITTITES.
to denote ataka liardly determines, it cannot thus be read, nor is it easy to say what atakaka means. But if it be simply takaka, the first syllable is to, the door, in Japanese, in Basque, ate, athe. The modern Japanese word for neighbour, neighbouring, is tonari, composed of to, the door, and nari, the verb to be. A better form would be to-chika, near the door. The Basque word for a neighbour is auzoko, which, on comparison with chitez-ko, intimate, sliows that the second part of the word is ezko, wax, that which adheres, so that atezko would mean adhering to the door. The verb zuzitii occurs twice in the inscription ; it is good Basque of to-day, zuzi, zuzitii, to destroy. The- Japanese form is susanii, in which the verb-forming particle mi, run, replaces the
Basque tu, tzen. In the same way the adjective white, zuri in Basque, shira in Japanese, becomes the vei'b to whiten by adding
tu to zuri, and mi to shira. These particles represent old verbs tniiy and itiv, itzen, the former having the meaning of giving, rtiu,
and placing, 'rni ; the latter, that of placing ; thus zuri-tu and shira-mi equally mean to place whiteness or make white. The
last word calling for special attention is the kamala of line 5.
It answers to the Japanese koniarase, to trouble, molest, disturb, the Basque samurtzen, to vex, and the Aztec comonia, to disturb. It is probably the kambil of the Basque word iskamhil, composed of hitz, a word, and meaning a great noise of words. The
lost kambil, signifying in this compound a great noise, is very suitable for denoting disturbance and a disturber. The Japanese komorase means to shut up, answering to the Choctaw akamalih and ikemalih, but these words also mean to obstruct, to molest. The Choctaw forms serve to explain the Basque word ukhitmil, the fist, as meaning a closed hand. In the Semitic languages the idea of shutting up is closely connected with those of persecuting,
vexing, distressing, and the same figurative speech seems to have characterized the Khitan. Their close proximity, during the ages when language was being developed by the two stocks, would naturally tend to impress upon them common forms of thought, but the question, With whom did these forms originate ? is not one that can be easily answered. There is so much for the Hittite to explain within the circle of living Khitan tongues, that its relations with outside languages may well be left in abeyance.

CHAPTER IX.
First Inscription of King Sagara of Carchemish.
This inscription, numbered Jerabis iii., demands attention
before Jerabis i., because its contents indicate historical priority. Unhappily it is mutilated at the top and on the right side. The upper imperfect line begins at the left, and the inscription proceeds in regular boustrophedon order. The characters are well
executed, distinct, and as a rule easy to read, the chief difficulty being the animals' heads, of which there are no fewer than nineteen, representing five distinct symbols. It can, therefore, no longer be said than an animal's head as such has the phonetic
value ta, for the ass yields sa, the ox, or straight-horned domestic animal, ka, the ram, or twisted-horned animal, ra, and the fish and the dog-like head, ma. The human face appears without the indicating arm and hand, but with the same value, sa. With protruding tongue it denotes ne. An ideograph representing a human head, surmounted by the Phrygian cap, prepares the way for Jerabis i., in which it occurs twice. Its value is saga, saka,
and it was apparently meant to set forth a saki or chief ruler. The only word that can be made out in the broken upper line is Carchemish or Kerakamaish. Beginning then at the mutilated right side of the second line, the transliteration is : Line 2, tsula Katanesa sahaka non kula Neneha menene tekane mata Matake Komukasa Salamanesera nebasine sanketsu Salaka. Line 3, Sasagane Samessinesa kikulaku Komana Kamesinesa non kula Sagara ka alkiv ha korosu ri tori mxata Sagara TYiekuka Konviika baka. Line 4, niara kutaikane Sagara, Saganekasa memese saka kutainekane Matake Komuka mata baka takakane Teraka inarane tsuki marane. Line 5, Salamanesera Sagane ishsa kekisa Kerakamaish Sagara zuzena saki takata kesikaka Gota Katanesa sari sutate taneta non kakutsu.

The literal translation is :

Freely translated, the document is as follows : SHALMANEZER COMMANDS HIS HEIR SaLAKA TO INSTAL AS KiNG OF CoMMAGENE ONE Matake, an opponent of the Hittites, who pays court TO THE CITY OF NiNEVEH. SaSGANE OF THE SaMESSIANS revolts ; COMANA OF THE KaMESIANS, WHO PLACE THEIR CITY IN THE POWER OF SAGARA, KILLS ITS GOVERNOR. KiNG SaGARA INVADES Commagene. I, Sagara, gain the victory; the effeminate prince of the assyrians i overthrow. i instal Teraka as king of Commagene in the place of Matake. Victory follows victory. Shalmanezer the possessor of Assyria, in order to injure Sagara of Carchemish, incites Gota, a Hittite chief who thinks to escape from tribute, to fight against his rightful lord.
This inscription gives the cause of the revolt which led to the destruction of Nineveh, and the end of the old Assyrian Empire.
It and its sister inscription from Jerabis are of vast historic importance, because the events to which they refer are otherwise shrouded in darkness. The Assyrian monuments are necessarily silent concerning them. Save by the incidental mention of the name of the Assyrian Pul, the ever truthful Hebrew Scriptures afibrd no information. And the authority of Ctesias and his copyists is felt to be but a broken reed, independent of their
discrepancies. These two Hittite inscriptions from the site of ancient Carchemish are, therefore, the only trustworthy records
of a period which more than others demands a chronicler, for it



FIRST INSCEIPTIOX OF KING SAGARA OF CARCHEMISH. 109
is a period of revolution and change. The philosophical setting
forth of causes which marks the history of Herodotus is
especially characteristic of the Hittites. This has already appeared in Hamath iii. It is conspicuous in both the Etruscan and Umbrian tables of the Eugubine inscriptions. In the
document under consideration, cause, true or false, is clearly stated, and great results are represented as flowing naturally from it. This inscription may have been the model of Kenetala's Hamathite record, which in spirit, if not in phraseology, it
resembles. The remembrance of a successful contest with the Assyrian armies in the past would be the source of that confidence which the Hamath inscription breathes, a confidence
unjustified by subsequent events. The author of the inscription is Sagara, King of Carchemish, who, according to Professor Sayce, ruled the Hittite confederacy from b76 to 854 B. C, almost a century and a half before Pisa the Zari. This is impossible since the Assyrian Pul was a hundred years later ; not that the historian has made a mistake, for the monuments abundantly testify to the existence of Sagara in the reign of Shalmanezer, the contemporary of Jehu and Hazael ; but the Sagara of the inscription is a later namesake and more illustrious occupant of the throne of Carchemish, concerning whom the Assyrian annals are silent. Is there any
confirmation of the existence of a powerful monarch named Sagara, who successfully waged war wnth the Assyrian Empire ? The monumental history of Persia and Greek records of eastern
tradition answer affirmatively. In the Behistun inscription of Darius we read of two pretenders to royalty ; a Median named Phraortes who called himself Xathrites of the race of Cyaxares, and who was joined by the Parthians and Hyrcanians ; and one Sitratachmes, who claimed to be of the same race, and set up his kingdom in Sagartia on the Caspian Sea, north of Hyrcania.^ Herodotus, Ctesias, and other Greek writers mention this Cyaxares, and represent him as the overthrower of Nineveh. Herodotus places this Median revolt about the middle of the eighth century, but represents the conquest of Nineveh by
1 Records of the Past, vol. i. pp. 116, 119.



110 THE HITTITES.
Cyaxares as occurring about 620 B.C.^ On the other hand, Ctesias makes Arbaces head the Median insurrection in 875 B.C., and about the same time aid the Babylonians under Belesis in overthrowing the Assyrian Empire.^ Already it has appeared that Arbaces, Deioces, and other so called Median names, are Hittite. Of the same character is Phraortes, with which the Parthian Phraates may be compared. Xatlirites and Sitratachmes invite comparison with Seduris, the name of a Hittite King of Van ; with Ashteroth in Ashteroth Karnaim, a Hittite sanctuary ; with Satiriai, the name of a kingdom of the Nairi ; with the Iberian Astures, and the Indo Scythic Kshattriyas. The connection of these men with Parthia, Hyrcania, and notably with
Sagartia, regions of Hittite name and occupation, attest their
origin. Cyaxares, therefore, must be of the same race, and the
association of his name with Sagartia, together with the fact that he headed a successful rebellion against the Assyrian power,
mark him as Sagara of Carchemish."* The Greek historians confounded the two stories of the fall of Nineveh, the former
relating to the conquest of the Babylonian Pul, the Belesis of Ctesias, and the latter to that of Nabopolassar, a hundred and
eighty yeai'S afterwards. It is necessary to anticipate in order
to allay natural scepticism as to the identity of Sagara and
Cyaxares. In Jerabis i. we shall find Pul as Palaka or Phalok, the Belesis of Ctesias, a king of the Babylonians, and companion in arms of Sagara ; and there also the name of the unfortunate Assyrian monarch, overthrown by them, will appear as Salaka, the Saracus of Abydenus. That author makes the same mistake as Ctesias in connecting Saracus with the conquest of Nabopolassar.^ The presence of Hittites in Parthia, Hyrcania, and
Sagartia, in the time of the Achnemenian Persians, is accounted for by the overthrow of their Syrian Empire by the Assyrian Sargon, and their consequent banishment or transportation to distant regions by their conqueror. •

The Shalmanezer of the inscription is the third of that name, who is supposed to have reigned from 828 to 818 B.C. His reign was a troubled one, the northern provinces of the empire
being in a chronic state of revolt, which continued with little intermission till the fall of Nineveh. There is good reason for
placing the period of Shalmanezer III. at least fifty years later than the date assigned to him by M. Lenormant.*'' The Assyrian
Eponym Canon places a total eclipse of the sun in the year of
Bur Sagale, 763 B.C. This is mentioned by the prophet A.mos ? Herodotus states that such an eclipse took place during the war between Cyaxares and the Lydians, which he says was foretold by the philosopher Thales of Miletus.^ As Thales flourished about the year 600, the statement of Herodotus must be incorrect, or Cyaxares is not Sagara. Yet the eclipse occurred at a time of universal upheaval in Assyria, for the year in which it took place and those that immediately followed are marked in the Eponym calendar Ijy rebellions in Assur, Arbaka and Gozan. Pui also came upon the scene about the year 760, and in 745 Tiglath Pileser II. commenced the new line of Assyrian monarchs. Wlien the events recorded in the inscription took place, Salaka or Saracus was acting as his father Shalmanezer's viceroy in
northern Syria. In Jerabis i., which is the historical sequel of this document, Shalmanezer is not mentioned, but Salaka is represented as the Assyrian king. As far as the testimony of the Hittite monuments goes, Shalmanezer must have lived to within a few years at most of the fall of Nineveh. The Eponym Calendar places his death in 771 B. C, but makes no mention of
Salaka.'^ If the eclipse of 763 fell within the period of war between the Assyrians on the one hand and the Babylonians and Hittites on the other, that war must have lasted at least eight years. According to Herodotus, twenty-eight years elapsed between the first siege of Nineveh by Cyaxares and its final

capture, that interval being filled by a period of Scythic domina
tion in Western Asia.
The immediate cause of the Hittite insurrection was the appointment of one Matake as King of Commagene, in the north of Syria. This person was either zahako (Basque), an outsider,
foreigner, or giyakii (Japanese), opponent, traitor, to the Hittites, who, by paying court to Shalmanezer at Nineveh, had succeeded in gaining that monarch's favour, and with it the gift of the Commagenian kingdom. This was a region of great importance, lying to the north of Carchemish and bordering upon Mesopotamia, Armenia, and Cappadocia. As early as the time of Tiglath Pileser I., who is supposed to have reigned about 1100 B.C., when Saul was King of Israel, Commagene or Comukha appears as an Assyrian conquest, and almost every succeeding monarch who has left records of his exploits, mentions the northern kingdom.^*' Several of its kings are named in these documents, such as Sarupin-Sihusuni, Cali-Anteru, Cili-Anteru, Khattukhi, Sadi-Anteru, Catu-Zilu, Kundaspi, Kustaspi, and Mutallu. In Strabo's time its capital was Samosata, a strong city, which he says was the seat of the kings. He also informs us that Commagene and the neighbouring Melitene of Cappadocia were planted with fruit trees, and contrasts them in this respect with the other provinces of Cappadocia. ^^ The capital, Samo.sata, probably
furnishes the more correct form of the name Kumukha ; and the earlier seat of those who inhabited that country may be found in the peculiarly Hittite region about Lake Huleh, the waters of Merom of the Bible, and the Samochonites of Josephus. The chief relations of the people of Commagene in Assyrian days were with the Moschi and Rosh. It is vain to look for Matake the usurper, under Assyria, of the Commagenian throne, in the
records of the Assyrian empire, as there are none of any detail for the period proper, and as a probable alien his name would
not find illustration in dynastic lists. It is a significant fact, however, that Herodotus makes Madyes, the son of Protothyes, a Scythian, and the conqueror of Cyaxares. His progress through Syria, occupation of Palestine, and pillaging of Ascalon in

FIRST INSCRIPTION OF KING SAGARA OF CARCHEMISH. 118
Philistia, as related by the father of history, while not inconsistent with an invasion of Media, are more in harmony with a subjugation of the western provinces of the Assyrian Empire at the request of the Assyrian monarch. This Madyes is doubtless the Madys of Strabo, also a Scythian, who drove the Cimmerian Treres out of Asia Minor.^^ In the straits in which Shalmanezer found himself, nothing would be more natural than that he should accept the aid of an enemy of the Hittites, and place him in occupation of Cominagene, whence he might overawe the tribes of Asia Minor on the west and those of Syria on the south. The name of Salaka, the successor of Shalmanezer, is only preserved by Abydenus, who makes him the successor of Sai'danapalus, and calls him Saracus. In the Merash inscription, Assurnazirpal is simply called Nazir, and in the western Hittite (Etruscan and Celt-Iberian) inscriptions, foreign names are given
in a similar abbreviated form ; it is, therefore, probaVjle that Salaka represents but part of the name of the unhappy King of Assyria. The word Asshur does not enter into the composition of it, for the Hittites were quite able to reproduce that name, and
did so in Jerabis i., where we shall meet with it as denotinof, in all probability, Assur-dayan, whom the Eponym Calendar makes the successor of Shalmanezer. Salaka may be Salkhu, the lofty,
employed as the epithet of a god. He is not called the son of Shalmanezer, but simply his successor. Esarhaddon is Sennacherib's sangetsu ho, or succeeding son, but Salaka is Shalmanezer's sangetsu simply. Still the presumption is that the two monarchs stood in the relation of father and son.
The rule of Matake in Commagene was the signal for revolt, and the leader in disaffection seems to have been Sasgane, a city of the Samessians. Shalmanezer II. places the Sasganians between the Kharranians and the Andians.^^ The Kharranians are the inhabitants of the Biblical Haran in Mesopotamia.
Sasgane, therefore, may denote the Sacane of the classical geographers, lying almost due east of Samosata and north of Haran. It is defined in the inscription as belonging to the Samessians, who must be represented by Simesi in the Assyrian records.

114 THE HITTITES.
Assurnazirpal first mentions this region, which he terms the terri
tory of Zimizi, and seems to place in the land of Kirruri, not far from Gauzanitis and Thapsacus.^^ Shahnanezer in three different places speaks of the lowlands of Simesi.^^ He indicates that it was in the land of the Nairi in northern Mesopotamia, and, like
Assurnazirpal, he associates it with Ulmanya, which is Alama directly south of Haran. At the close of the Black Obelisk inscription he says : " Into the low ground of Simesi at the head of the country of Khalman I went down." The lowlands of Simesi must have corresponded in part with the Biblical Padan Aram, including the country beginning on the north at Sacane in the extreme west of Mount Masius, and extending southwards, past Haran and Alama, towards Thapsacus. Of this, the northern portion between Haran and Sacane must have constituted Simesi. Lying immediately to the east of Commagene, and bordering Assyria on the north-west, the detachment of this country from the enemy was of the utmost importance to the Hittite revolters,
hindering, as it necessarily would, the passage of reinforcements
and supplies from one seat of war to the other, and stopping communication between Assyria and Commagene. Another revolting city was Comana of the Kamesians. Tiglath Pileser I. mentions not the city but the country of Comani, of which Arin was the metropolis, and to which Tala, Khunutsa and Kapshuna belonged.^*' Sargon defines the position of the country of Khammanua by making Miliddie the capital of its King Gunziixan. He says : " I put over him, that is the sttccessor of Gunzinan, my vice-king, as it was in the time of Gunzinan, the preceding king." It is worthy of note that Sennacherib
praises the trees of this region. " Around my palace I planted
the finest of trees, equal to those of the land of Khamana, which all the knowing prefer to those of the land of Chaldaea." This
tallies with the statement of Strabo as to the fruit trees of Melitene, for that is the Miliddie of Khammanua.^^ The country of Comana was thus to the north of Commagene, so that its

FIRST INSCRIPTION OF KING SAGARA OF CARCHEMISH. 115
revolt opened up a passage into Asia Minor, through which supphes and levies might be brought from that Hittite region, and by which, if affairs became desperate, the confederate kings might find safety in flight. To the north-west of Melitene, in the time of the Komans, was situated the region of Camisene with its town Camisa, and still farther to the north-west was Comana
Pontica, so called to distinguish it from the larger Comana in Central Cappadocia. In Strabo's time the priests of Comana Pontica held sway over Camisene. In the south of Camisene were Aranae and Gundusa, representing the Arin and Khunutsa of Comani, mentioned by Tiglath Pileser I. It is not likely that
Miliddie, or the town of Melitene, which gave name to the district, was an original possession of the people of Kamesi, as its
name is not generally associated with theirs. It was probably conquered by them from the Gamgumians or Zuzim. The people of Comana, which, in the time of Sagai'a, was pi'obably situated
in the east of the Tarus range in Cappadocia, killed their 7"i-tori or governor, the viceroy or lieutenant set over them by the
A.ssyrians, and placed the city in the power of Sagara. Although
the fact is not stated in the inscription, it appear.*; that the revolt
of these two regions, Simesi and Camise, wnth their cities, Sasgane and Comana, was due to the advance of Sagara's Hittite army from Carchemish, north-eastward into the former, and then
north-westward into the latter country.
Having thus augmented his forces and hemmed in the enemy with hostile states on the east and north, Sagara was ready for the great struggle. It is probable that the west also was hostile to the Assyrians, for Herodotus mentions Syennesis of Cilicia as a friend of Cyaxares, and mediator between him and Alyattes of Lydia.^^ An invasion of Commagene was determined on. Along the banks of the Euphrates, where it opens a way through the mountains from Melitene, southward to Samosata, the great Hittite army marched to measure its strength with the forces of Assyria. No details are given. Sagara gained the victory, and overthrew the effeminate lord of the Assyrians. There is some
thing very significant in the adjective memese, Japanese memeshii, womanish, here rendered effeminate. The accounts of Diodorus
18 Herodot., i. 74.



V
116 THE HITTITES.
Siculus, Justin, Athenaeus, and other writers indebted to Ctesias, represent Arbaces the Mede, whom the author of the history of Assyria and Persia puts in place of Cyaxares or Sagara, as gaining admittance to the palace of Sardanapalus or Saracus, and seeing the king dressed in feminine costume in the midst of his harem. This sight first roused in him the thought of freeing his countrymen from the Assyrian yoke.^^ The truthfulness of the story is partly vouched for by the use of the word meviese in the inscription, which indicates, on the part of Sagara, an acquaintance with the disposition and habits of Salaka. After the victory Sagara placed Teraka upon the throne of Commagene in the room of Matake, who had doubtless retired with Salaka and the remnant
of his army towards Assyria. Otesias mentions several defeats •
of the confederates, but none are recorded in this inscription. It is hard to say who Teraka wa.s. The name is a very common one in Hittite history. Teru was an element in the names of several kings of Commagene, such as Cili-an-Teru, Cali-an-Teru, Sadi-an-Teru, so that Teraka or Teruka may have belonged to the native royal line.-*^ Tharsa and Dolichc also occur in the classical topography of the country, and tend to associate the name Teraka with the permanent occupants of Commagene. The conciseness of the Hittite documents, which seem to take for granted on the part of the reader a considerable amount of
historical knowledge, renders it a difficult task to reconstruct
detailed history by their means. In the mid.st of his triumphant statement of victory following victory, Sagara suddenly stops short to tell how Shalmanezer, with the design of injuring him, had instigated a Hittite lord,
named Gota, to free himself from tribute obligration and fight
against his lawful sovereign. Here unfortunately the inscription breaks off, so that we are unable to say what was the consequence of Gota's treachery. Is the following extract from Diodorus a mere coincidence, or is it history now for the tirst time confirmed ? " The king, seeing that he was about to fall from the throne, sent

away his three sons and two daughters with much treasure to Cotta, governor of Paphlagonia, the most faithful of his satraps." ^^ The word Catu is an element in the name of Catu-zilu, a Commagenian king, in the middle of the ninth century B.C., and at the
same time lived Cati, king of the Kue in Cilicia.-^ The name is
Hittite, therefore, but it is also Paphlagonian, for the first independent king of the Paphlagonians, during the Persian period, was Cotys, who, in 394 B.C., allied himself with Agesilaus of Sparta
against Pharnabazus.'-^ Strabo gives a list of Paphlagonian names, all of which may be Hittite, namely, Bagas, Biasas, Aeniates, Rhatotes, Zardoces, Tibius, Gasys, Oligasys, and Manes.^* The Paphlagonian word for goat was gangra, gaggra ; this is the Georgian kazari, Basque akher. Cotys was an ancestral name among the Lydians, a Hittite people, and among the Thracian Odrysae and Edoni. Strabo compares the Phrygian rites with
those of the Thracian goddess, Cotys, and there is little doubt that the Thracians represented the aboriginal Turanian occupants of Macedonia and Hellas, who belonged to the same widespread Hittite family.^s The Paphlagonians are not without record in the Assyrian annals. Shalmanezer II. found them, not as constituting a kingdom or province of Asia Minor, but as the inhabitants of a city which he calls Paburrukhbani, situated apparently to the north of Commagene, and, therefore, in that Melitene which after
wards pertained to the Kamesians.-^ In the time of Sagara they had probably been driven farther to the north and west in the direction of the Paphlagonia of the classical geographers, yet
sufficient!}'- near to the seat of war to be, as enemies, a thorn in
the side of the Hittite emperor. The Cotta of Diodorus, or rather
of his authority Ctesias, may thus be fairly identified with the
Gota of the inscription.
In this inscription A.ssyria is still Sagane, but its capital Nineveh is called Neneba. To the Hittites we may owe the form Nineveh, for in Assyrian and Accadian its name was Ninua. It

is true that the Hebrew name was Nineveh, but to the Greeks and Romans it was Ninus until the late period of Ammianus Marcellinus, who calls it Nineve.-'^ Lenormant states that Asshurlikhish, his Sardanapalus, tixed his residence at Nineveh instead of Ellasar, where his predecessor had lived. ^^ Yet it is plain that Shalmanezer had his royal seat in Nineveh. A more
interesting name for etymological investigation is that of Carchemish. It has been supposed to contain the name of Chemosh the Moabite god. Now it is true that both Moabites and Ammonites superseded old Hittite stocks in the country east of the Jordan, and that some of them migrated with the Hittites
into distant regions, as, for instance, into Cilicia, where the Amanides pylae with Mopsucrene and Mopsuestia commemorated Amnion and Moab ; but the speech of the Moabites, as attested by the Moabite stone of King Mesha, was purely Semitic.
Carchemish, as the capital of all the Hittite tribes, should bear the name of some great progenitor in the senior family of the
nation rather than that of a foreign god. The initial ca is
not necessarily part of the word, for, in Khupuscia as compared with Thapsacus, the initial khu is foreign to the root, being a
significant prefix. The final ish is the Basque esi, an enclosure,
which appears also in the Japanese shi-mervu, to shut, enclose. The remaining part of the word is rechem, rekevi, so that Carchemish may have meant the city or enclosure of the great Rekem. This is the Ragmu of the Izdubar legends and the Sargon or Sar Rukin who heads the ancient Chaldean dynasty of Agade. Some years ago the writer directed attention to the identity of the stor}'' of Sargon as preserved in the Assyrian Legend of the Infancy of Sargina, and that of Tilgamus or Gilgamis as told by Aelian.^" Gilgamis or Girgamis is just Carchemish. The
Assyrian changed the m to n, and made the word Rukin. He was Rekem the eldest son of Yachdai, whence the name Agade, and belonged to the tribe of the Zuziin, the senior branch

of the Hittite family.^^ Among the Arabs he was Lokman the Adite.^^ In India he was called Lakshman, and Lucknow was his city.^^ In northern Persia Hyrcania was his memorial ; and Sazabe, the stronghold of Carchemish, was represented by its Casape. There also dwelt the Astaveni, or descendants of Yachdai. The Greeks, eager for etymologies, confounded Carchemish as a name in migration with their word chersonesus, a peninsula, notably in the Crimea, where the Chersonitae and the gulf Carcinites might have taught wise men differently. In Hyrcania the old Hittite name became Syracene. Clazomenae in Lydia was another reminiscence of the Hittite capital. Even
in distant Japan the name appears slightly disguised. The story of Sargon and Tilgamus or Gilgamus is that, being placed by his mother in an ark like that of Moses, he was found by a water-carrier, or, being thrown out of a window, was caught up by an eagle. The Japanese story is that Ourasima caught in the Mitsou river of Tamba a turtle, which turned into a woman and married him ; then they went to live in the island of Fouraisan. It is also found in the Manyoshiu, a collection of Japanese poetry dating from the fifth to the ninth century, A.D., in which the hero is called Urashiraa of Midzunoe. Fouraisan became the name for all treasuries in Japan. Both Urashima and Fouraisan contain the root of Carchemish.^^ It is also likely that the Chorasmii to the north of Hyrcania, whom Strabo places among the Massagetae, were expatriated Carchemishians. Herodotus connects them with the Parthians, a Hittite people. In the tinie of Alexander the Great they were under their own king Pharasmanes, a western Fouraisan. In his Periplus of the Black Sea, Arrian mentions another Pharasmanes who ruled over the Caucasian Sydretes in the time of Hadrian.^^ As in Japan, so in distant Wales the old Hittite

story of Sargou's infancy is found, brought there no doubt by
Pictish Silures. From similarity to the name Tilgamus, that of
the Welsh bard, Taliesin, who is supposed to have lived in the sixth century, A.D., is united with the legend of a child exposed
soon after his birth in a fishing weir on the coast of Cardigan, where he was found by fishermen and brought to Elfin the son of Gwyddno, who ruled the country. ^^^ In Indian mythology the eponym of Carchemish was known as Krishna, the child of the Yadavas, exposed in infancy and afterwards a great warrior. Sir George Cox compares the intimate relationship subsisting between Krishna and Arjuna with that which united Laxmana and Rama.^'' These are but duplicate representations of the same mythological personage, not really mythological but belonging to old Hittite tradition ; for Sargon was the father of Naram-Sin, and the Adite Lokman, the vulture man, the builder of the dyke of Arim. So Urima lay near Carchemish, and Clazomeriae was situated on the Hermaeus Sinus. Divested of its adventitious particles, Carchemish is a world-Avide name or as extensively
spread abroad as is the Hittite race. Two words in the inscription appear to be compounds of the verb mi, Basque inii, imiiii, to place, a synonym of the Japanese ha. One is 'nie-nene, composed of mi and the Japanese nen, attention, heed, which is represented by the Basque verb emun,
enzuten, to hear, listen. The other is mxe-hiih', of which the
second part is the root of the Japanese kogeki, assault, and the Basque javJci, with the same meaning. The verb teka is used more than once in the signification of setting up, appointing.
Its root may be the Basque tegi, foki, a place, which appears also
in the Japanese tochi, tokoro ; but the Japanese takai, high,
iakeru, be high, takame, make high, raise, is the more natural,
and connects with the Basque jaiki, to rise. This verb is in one case followed by the personal pronoun vi, I, in another by the verb substantive and pronoun ka ni, I am. The verb nebnsine, or better, nahutzen, is a genuine Basque form of a derivative from nahusi, lord, master. There does not seem to be any
modern verb of this kind, but jabe, a synonym of nabtusi,
M Parry's Canibrian Plutarch, 41, from HaneR Taliesin. ^^ Cox's Aryan Mythology, i. 393, 425.



FIRST INSCRIPTION OF KING SAGARA OF CARCHEMISH. 121
furnishes jabetsen, to master, command. In line three, kiku laku is composed of kiku, the Japanese verb to hear, obey, and raku, omitting- or falling from, as in raku-ji, a word omitted, raku
haku, falling from wealth, raku-inei, losing life ; it thus means failino- to obey. In Basque entzu takes the place of the Japanese kiku, which is probably represented by ikasi, to learn, and ikusi, to see, the idea of knowledge being contained in each, although
gained by different senses. But raku, laku, is the Basque lekat,
omitted, excepted, ininun. The word ri-tori consists of the
Japanese ri, more fully riyo, government, jurisdiction, and tori,
the verb to take, obtain, hold, a synonym of the Basque artu.
The Basque has retained the entire word as ertor, erretor, rector, which has unnecessarily been supposed a loan from the Romance
lansfuages. A somewhat difficult word is mara, 'niarane, a victory. It is represented by the Japanese amari, to exceed, be more than, and in Basque by oboro, more than, and emparau, that which is over, the rest. As difficult are the two verbs kutaikane and kutaine-kane. The former means to gain, the latter to vanquish. In either case the first part of the verb it:' the Etruscan
ktitu, which is represtented by the modern Basque ekit, ekiten, to
undertake, advance, begin, attack, having in many ways the meaning of the English do. The present verb, to gain, in Basque
is beretu, to get to one's self, but old Basque, such as Etruscan, rarely used 6ere, replacing it with the demonstrative au and its compounds. Another Basque verb is aurketu, to find, gain, which seems to be composed of au, in an old dative form aura, and ekit,
to do or get to one's self. The Hittite inverts the order, dispenses
with the sign of the dative, and in kida-au furnishes the original
verb, to gain. In Japanese the primitive verb, to get, gain, is one of the simplest words in the language, being u, u-ru, more fully u-keru, u-keta. Similar is kutaine or kutavme. The
latter part of the word (.me represents the root on, hon, in the Basque ondo, bottom, depth, down, like the Japanese ana, cave, hole, pit, mine. From the Japanese ana comes anadori, to despise, look down upon ; from the Basque ondu comes ondatu, to destroy, or the French abimer. A somewhat similar word is the Basque onaztu, to trample under foot. Literally kuta-une
is to do down, and that was probably the original signification



122 THE HITTITES.
of the Basque unhatu, to weary, depress. The presence of the Etruscan kutu in ancient Hittite is of great importance to the student of that language and its later dialects, as it is a verb of frequent occurrence both alone and in composition, and as it is barely recognizable in the Basque eJcin, eJciten, and in the Japanese auxiliary kuru, often confounded with the verb to come. Among the Basque words in the inscription occur zuzena rightful, lawful ; zari, zagi, leader ; zahako, without, outside
;
and kakvbtsu or gogotzu, to think. The verb takata, to fight, is the Japanese tekitai, from teki, an enemy. In Basque etsai is the equivalent of teki, and a lost verb etsaitu, whence came etsaitasun, enmity, should stand for tekitai. The Circassian word for enemy, yedzisho, agrees best with the Basque, the Corean taityok, Dacotah toka and Aztec teyaouh, with the Japanese. The Aztec teyaotia, to fight, is formed like the Japanese
teJcitai and the old Hittite takata. An interesting word, exhibit
ing the vitality of language, is kesikaka, to instigate. In
Japanese it is keshikake, in Basque, kitzikatu and kilikatu, and
in Aztec, cocolquitia. It is remarkable that, while the central
Hittite and Japanese coincide, there should be a similar coincidence between the Basque and Aztec extremities. Peculiarly
Japanese words are korosu, to kill, nnemeshii, womanly, tsugi, to follow. The verb ishsa is the Basque itsas, holding, from the
root ich, to close ; and kekisa, to injure, is an inversion of the Basque gaitz-egi, to do harm. The Japanese form of the latter is gai-suru, but as the infinitive sum gives in its finite forms
shi and ki, the connection is evident. The only words remaining to note are sutate and taneta. The first connects with the
Japanese 8vAe, suteru, suteta, to reject, abandon, and the Basque
ichtitu, ixtitu, to stop, cause to cease, and utsi, to abandon. The
word tanetu, translated tribute, is the Basque danda, now meaning payment by instalments, but denoting tribute in the
Eugubine Tables. It is probablj' a compound of the verb to ask, in Basque itan, in Japanese tano-mi. The Japanese denso, a tax, does not appear to be a native word.

CHAPTER X.
Second Inscription of King Sagara of Carchemish.
Jerabis I., so far as history is concerned, is the gem of the Hittite collection, but to the epigrapher it is a most tantalizing document. The inscription does not occupy one uniform surface like the preceding ones, but zig-zags over the tops and sides of
two steps. In the plate the portions lettered D and B represent
the tops or steps proper, C and A the sides or connecting perpendiculars. To read the inscription, therefore, a commence
ment must be made either at the right of A or at the left of D :
continuing, in the former case, to the right of B, C and D, and,
in the latter, to the left of C, B and A. A difficulty appears, however, in the extreme left of D beyond the break in the stone, where it seems evident from the arrangement of characters that the hieroglyphics beyond the break are to be read in the opposite direction to those on its right. This is specially observable in line 4, in which the name of Salaka is read from right to left, while the succeeding Palaka is read -in the reverse order. More
over the portions of the inscription beyond the break are so
fragmentary that at the present stage of Hittite decipherment, it would be unwise to speculate as to their signification. From the break in D to the right of that slab, and throughout the other
faces, the inscription is perfect, with the exception of the upper line, which is more or less defaced in all four. The only word in
it that can be read with certainty is Askai-a, the Hittite form of Assur or Ashur. There is some difficulty even in determining the
direction of that line, for, while the word saki in the right of A should, according to analogy, end the line, the direction of other
characters favours the reading of it from right to left, which is in harmony with the order of the rest of the inscription. It will thus be necessary for the present to ignore the mutilated top
line and all that lies to the left of the break in the step D. Enough remains to excite such interest in this memorial of the Hittites as few other ancient documents are capable of raising
in the mind of the student of oriental history.



124 THE HITTITES.
Beginning at the shield and basket, the hieroglyphics denoting royalty, in the left of" D, proceeding from left to right through D, C, B and A, and continuing in regular boustrophedon order to the end of the inscription, we get the following transliteration : Line 2, Mata Sayara Komuka bake mata Sagara Dunesinesa Askara neke kusago. Line 3, Sakesaku Askara satasa Katanesa aginba Sasahakatufsa Katanesa aginsa satala kara. Line 4, Palaka, Nenebase gosa Palaka Nenebasa sasane Salaku lie tasasa mata Sagane Askara. Line 5, Kiku ba mata Sagane Dunesinesa tasanema nekasa tarasa makasa take su sugo tasa kula ne. Literal translation : Line 2, King Sagara Commagene appoints king Sagara of-the Babylonians Assur together to-crush. Line 3, promptly Assur to-guard of-the-Hittites army Sazabe
makes-descend of-the-Hittites commander protection to-bring. Line 4, Phalok of-Nineveh conqueror Phalok of-Nineveh destroyer Salaka to prefers king Assyria Assur. Line 5, hearing placing king Assyria of-the-Babylonians watchfulness to-escape being-unable of-wood lights fire conflagra
tion sets city to.
Put into English construction the inscription reads
:
King Sagara appoints Commagene for king Sagara and Assur of the Babylonians together to strike. Promptly in order to guard Assur, to bring protection, the commander OF THE HiTTITES CAUSES THE ARMY OF THE HiTTITES DESCEND FROM SaZABE. PhALOK, THE CONQUEROR OF NiNEVEH, Phalok, the destroyer of Nineveh, prefers Assur to Salaka AS king of Assyria. The king of Assyria perceiving the watchfulness of the Babylonians, and being unable to escape, lights a fire of wood and sets the city in conflagration. These are but fragments of the whole story, but fragments
invaluable, for they contain sufficient material to make historical
the first destruction of Nineveh, which some competent historians have called in question, although M.M. Lenormant and Oppert never doubted it. This inscription places it beyond all doubt.



SECOND INSCRIPTION OF KING SAGARA OF CARCHEMISH. 125
So thoroughly in many points does the history of Ctesias tally
with the facts here briefly stated that, but for his placing Arbaces in the room of Sagara, one would think he had seen the very monument itself and had it translated for him by some Pa>-thian skilled in the writing of his ancestors. There are lacunae in the
record as we have it of a most tantalizing kind. It seems that Assur with his Babylonians, who had evidently come northward through Mesopotamia, was unable to reach Commagene, where the victorious Hittites lay, waiting for his arrival before striking the tinal blow at Assyrian supremacy. On the east of the Euphrates the Assyrian forces met him, but at what point it is hard to
decide. According to Ctesias, the first encounter took place in a plain about nine miles from Nineveh, a statement for which
there is no other authority. The absence of a postposition after
Sazabe is the cause of uncertainty, for, as it stands, the reading " causes to descend froiii Sazabe " is as admissible as " descend to Sazabe." This city is mentioned by Shalmanezer II. He says : " From the city of Dabigu I departed. To the city of
Sazabe, his stronghold, belonging to Sangara of the city of Carchemish, I approached. The city I besieged, I took." ^ So far as can be judged from its topographical connections, Sazabe was near the Armenian frontier and much nearer to Assyria than Carchemish. It would thus be a garrison town and fortress of
the Hittite Confederacy, not necessarily in the paternal dominion
of Sagara, but in his possession as the Hittite lord paramount. The fact that the commander of the Hittite army, and not Sagara himself, led the relieving force, makes it probable that it issued from Sazabe, where it had been left as a home-guard. This Hittite contingent apparently saved the Babylonians under Assur. Then Phalok comes suddenly upon the scene as the conqueror and master of Nineveh. This looks as if there Avere two Babylonian armies in the field, that under Assur, which was to co-operate with the Hittites under Sagara in Commagene, and another, under Pul or Phalok, which invaded Assyria from
the south and east. Ctesias gives colour to this view by making the success of the confederates depend upon a reinforcement from Bactria, which, originally intended to strengthen the army
1 Records of the Past, iii. 91.



126 THE HITTITES.
of the Assyrian king, was won over to the side ot" the revolters
by liberal promises. This would necessitate the presence of one of the invading armies near the passes of the Zagros range of mountains, through which the Bactrian troops would reach Assyria. Phalok at any rate is plainly recognized as the vanquisher of the Assyrians in their own territory by the Hittite sovereign, who would certainly not have been slow to assert himself the victor had he possessed any just title to such a claim.
The Babylonians are called in this inscription the Dunesi. This is the name by which they called themselves and by which the Assyrians long knew them. Thus in the Synchronous history of Assyria and Babylonia we read : " Buzur Assur, King of Assyria, and Burna Buryas, King of Gan-Duniyas, made an ordinance." Professor Sayce in a note says : " Gan-Duniyas, also called Gun-duni, the enclosure or fortress of Duni, was Western Chaldaea, the city of Babylon having received that name from some Cassite prince or deity." ^ The name passed down
into the classical period as Tere-Don on the Persian Gulf, the original of which was Kar-Duniyas. It may be also found in the Book of Ezra, which mentions the Dinaites as a people placed in Samaria by the Assyrians, although they are mentioned apart from the Babylonians.^ With the Dunesi Sagara connects Askara or Assur as their commander. Afterwards he represents Phalok as placing this Assur on the throne of A-ssyria instead of Salaka. Now the successor of Shalmanezer III., according to the Eponym Calendar, was Assur-dayan, in 771 B.C. He cannot be
Salaka, who is thus entirely ignored. The eclipse belonging to
this period was in 762, and in 760 Pul or Phalok appears. It is, therefore, possible that, although Assur-dayan only began to reign in 760, the previous eleven years, during which Salaka was king, were counted to him. If such be the case, it follows that he must have asserted his claim to the throne immediately after the death of Shalmanezer. Had he any claim ? It seems probable, for Assur is not a Babylonian name ; and why else should Phalok prefer him to Salaka ^ Cases of brothers contending for the crown were very common in Assyrian history. Thus Assur
2 Records of the Past, iii 29. ^ Lenormant, Ancient History of the East, i. 48G ; Ezra iv. 9.



SECOND INSCEIPTION OF KING SAGARA OF CARCHEMISH. 127
daninpal and Samas E,immon, sons of Shalmanezer II., fought for sovereignty, and so did the sons of Sennacherib.^ Assur and Salaka may, therefore, have been equally sons of Shalmanezer III., and the former perhaps the offspring of a Babylonian alliance. If he be Assur-dayan or-dan, what is the value of the latter part of his name ? It may be the Assyrian dayanu,l]udgb, or it may connect with Duniyas, the land of Assur's adoption.
Ctesias represents the Median Arbaces as ruling in Assyria, and confirming Belesis or Phalok in his kingdom of Babylonia. The true heir to the Assyrian throne and successor of Salaka is
persistently ignored in all the narratives. Palaka or Phalok is mentioned in the Books of Kings and Chronicles under the name of Pul.^ Eusebius, quoting Alexander Polyhistor, calls him a Chaldean Phul who occupied the Assyrian throne ; but it is impossible to make any rational connection of
the ancient lists of As.syrian kings given by the Greeks with the names given in the Bible and on the monuments.^ The verbal environment of Belochus in the lists of Eusebius and Syncellus is unintelligible. The synchronism is given in the Bible accounts
of Pul and the statements of the inscription under consideration. The only other record of any importance that helps to link the Chaldean conqueror of Assyria with historical personages is that of Ctesias, which mentions Belesis as the overthrower of Nineveh. We possess no Babylonian monuments of his time, and the meagre outline of Assyrian history which native documents furnish for the period does not contain the monarch's name. The statement
of Ctesias that Belesis was simply confirmed in the possession of the Babylonian monarchy, is at variance with those of the Bible and Eusebius, which make him King of Assyria. Yet a reconciliation may be found in the inscription, which represents Palaka as conferring upon Assur the crown of Assyria, a circumstance that presupposes its prior possession by the Babylonian, and the subordination of the Assyrian kingdom to that of
Babylon. Also, as, down to his time, Assyria had retained the supremacy, its monarch would naturally be regarded as the ruler

128 THE HITTITES.
of the east, so that for the sake of prestige Phalaka was compelled thus to designate himself even while reigning in Babylon, and governing the kingdom of superior dignity by his viceroy
Assur. The last line of the inscription is so completely in accord with the history of Ctesias that one would almost imagine he had copied the Hittite record. Diodorus, after the Greek physician, says : " The king despaired of safety, and in order not to fall alive into the power of his enemies, he caused a great funeral pile to be built in the midst of his palace, on which he placed his gold, silver, and royal garments. In a chamber constructed in the centre of the pile he shut up his concubines and eunuchs. Fire was set to the pile and he was thus consumed with his palace and his treasures." '' Abydenus, also after Berosus, writes : " Afterwards Saracus reigned over the Assyrians, and w^hen he had learned that a great multitude of barbarians had come fi'oin the sea to attack him, immediately he sent his general, Busalossor, to Babylon. But he, intending to rebel, betrothed Amuhea, the
daughter of Astyages, the prince of the Median family, to his son, Nabuchodrossor. Thereafter at once departing, he fiastened to attack Ninus, that is, Nineveh. But when King Saracus was made aware of all these things he burned himself together with the royal palace Evoritus." ^ Athenaeus' account, which he owed to Ctesias, is more full. " Sardanapalus, being dethroned by Arbaces, died, burning himself alive in his palace, having heaped
up a funeral pile four plethra in extent, on which he placed a hundred and fifty golden couches and a corresponding number of tables, these too being all made of gold. And he also erected on the funeral pile a chamber, a hundred feet long, made of wood ; and in it he had couches spread, and there he himself lay down with his wife, and his concubines lay on other couches around. For he had sent on his three sons and his daughters, when he saw
that his affairs were getting in a dangerous state, to Nineveh, to
the king of that city {there ivas a Neneha among the Niphates mountains of Armenia), giving them three thousand talents of gold. And he made the roof of this apartment of large stout

SECOND INSCRIPTION OF KING SAGARA OF CARCHEMISH. 129
beams, and then all the walls of it he made of numerous thick planks, so that it was impossible to escape out of it. And in it
he placed ten millions of talents of gold, and a hundred millions of talents of silver, and robes and purple garments, and every kind of apparel imaginable. And after that he bade the slaves
•set fire to the pile ; and it w^as fifteen days burning. And those who saw the smoke wondered and thought that he was celebrating a great sacrifice ; but the eunuchs alone knew what was ]"eally being done. And in this way Sardanapalus, who had spent his life in extraordinary luxury, died with as much magnanimity as possible."'' The simple story of Sagara is that, owing to the Babylonians' watchfulness, Salaka despaired of
escaping, that he made a fire of wood and set the city in conflagration. Such is the account of a contemporary document, too briefly told perhaps to set forth events with perfect exactness, yet it is likely that the fire of wood was magnified by Ctesias and Berosus into the funeral pile which Athenaeus so elaborately describes, and that the destruction of the city as well as of himself was intended by the Assyrian king. A. parallel case in some respects in modern history is the burning of Moscow by the Russians in order to rob Napoleon of the glory and advantage
of its capture.
The language of the inscriptions presents few difficulties.
The verb hake is a compound of ha, place, and he, the equivalent of the Basque egi and Japanese hi, makes. The Basque epatu, to fix, set a term, contains the same element huj, pa, but has a diflerent verb-former, tii. The word nehe is apparently of the same meaning as the nego or nago of Hamath v. Time could
hardly have effected the change in the latter syllable, but place may have had something to do with it, the dialect of Hamath,
like its characters, being diflerent from that of Carchemish. The Japanese naka, between, among, and the Basque nas, nahas, among, together, are the modern representatives of the word. In Jcusago may be found the Japanese kudzushi, to break or
throw down, kiijiki, hibjiku, to break, katsa, a mallet, and the Basque kasha, to break, supposed by etymologists to be derived from the Spanish cas-car. The Choctaw has kushah, broken

and kittnsJi, a pestle, agreeing with the Japanese katsu. A good
example of the longevity of words is Kakesakii, translated promptly ; it is the Japanese seka.sekd, hasty, impetuous, the
Basque takataka, promptly, the Aztec iciuhcayotica, ichiuhqui, immediately, rapidly. The verb satasa has appeared in the Hamath Votive inscriptions in the compounds kara.sata and
sat'ikara. It is the Basque zaitsu, to guard, and the Japanese tsiUsushi-me. In katasa appears the Japanese kudadii, cause to descend, the Basque egotzi, " selon M. Salaberry, faire
descendre."^° Then satala kara is in Basque estali ekarri, to
bring protection, estali being the verb, to protect. The Japanese equivalent is tsutsiv-mi, with which the preceding tsutsushi-me may be compared, the original meaning of both words being,
covering. The w^ord Neneba has appeared in Jerabis iii. In this inscription it is partly expressed by an ideograph which might be a glove, but looks more like a hand spanning or measuring distance between the tip of the thumb and those of the fingers. The only word it can stand for is the Etruscan nabe, extend, surviving in the Basque nabe, a plain, and nabari, perceive far off, but to which the Japanese corresponds perfectly in nobe, a
moor, nobe-rit, to stretch, nobi-rii, to extend, noba-shi, to leno-then. The Semitic meaning of Ninua, a bronze fish, is
sufficiently senseless in itself, and if it were the original sifJ"nification of Nineveh would hardly tempt the Hittites to translate it, but that they should endeavour to make the word
sicrnificant in their own language is natural. With an old radical ni, ne, which may appear in the Basque i7i-^?nvt, environ,
that which is around, and be the original of une, a place, in the
.same language, and of the Circa.ssian unna, unneh, a house, place of abode, and with nabe, far-reaching, they doubtless made
Nenabe the spacious place or house, the latter word being employed tropically for a city. The succeeding words, gosa and
sasane, characterize Palaka in relation to Nineveh. Already in Hamath iii. the connection of the Japanese katsu, to conquer, with the Basque f/o, high, has appeared. In the present case goi^n
is a noun, consisting of the Basque go, and f^a, the Etruscan

mark of agency. Thus from zeken, parsimonious, imhe, to send. Ian, to work, the Etruscan makes zekesa, a niggard, imbisa. a messenger, and lanesa, a workman. The simple word gosa in old Hittite meant he who is above, or the victor, vanquisher. The other word sasane has appeared in Hamath v., in the verbal form zuzitu, to destroy. It should take the termination of agency also, but three sibilants in succession were not to be
thought of, so n replaced «, and zuzine characterizes Palaka as. the destroyer of Nineveh. In the same line occurs tasasa, a
difficult expression, not to explain, for the post-position ne, to,
after Salaka, the subjective position of Palaka, and direct
objective position of Salaka, sufficient!}^ indicate that preference
is meant, but difficult to connect with living forms in the Khitan languages. The Japanese sho-tatsu means to be eminent, to surpass, being composed of sho, much, many, and tatsu, to rise.
Now the old Hittite has the verb fatsu, and this verb is not
tatsu, but tasa or ta.su, which in line five means to set. Its
Japanese equivalent, therefore, is tsu in tsukeru, to set, which is
the Basque atze in atzitu, to take, seize, but becomes nztatu,
though from the same root, in the sense of, to touch, set. The Japanese also has susumeru, to promote, su meaning several, many ; and sakidatsu, to stand first, saki meaning front, foremost. In Basque the sense of many, much, very, is expi-essed by as, asko, oso, and azitzen means to grow, bring up, raise, while
asetzen means to fill, make full. Literally these words, like the Japanese examples, mean to set much, and like the Japanese, they invert the old Hittite order of tasu-su. The living equiva
lent of su-tasii, in Basque, although intransitive in meanino-, is
chitzea, to precede ; and its connection with the various words
cited to illustrate the Khitan idiom is found in its radical chit, meaning very, much.
In the fifth line the Japanese kiku is used as a noun, hearintr and is followed by the primitive verb ha, to place. Yet there is a Japanese verb kiki-wakeru, to hear and understand. In Basque the equivalent of kiku is jaki in jakin, jakiten, to know, tiie ideas of hearing and knowing being intimately associated. The long word tasanema is well rendered by the Japanese tashinami, circumspection, care. In Basque it would be behatzen emav, to



132 THE HITTITES.
give attention, or hehatzen iDii, placing attention. The initial he
is not essential to the word, for azteitu means to regard, consider, as well as hehatzen ; so that atzen imi, placing attention, may
reproduce the Hittite verb. The Aztec disguises the original in tecuifldvia, be watchful, careful. The verb nekasa is the Japa
nese nifjnshi. now meaning to let escape, nigeru being the modern word, to escape. It is the Basque inyesi, now generally pronounced ihesi, igesi, to flee. The Aztec has changed the initial n to m, rendering, escape, by riiaquica. The following tarasu is the Japanese taradzu, to be lacking, unable. It is thus the negative of tari, enough. In Basque the negation is placed first in esturasun, difficulty, embarrassment ; it is the negation of tireso, strong, solid, able. The word maka, genitive Tnakasa, of wood, is the Japanese viaki, Tnoku, Circassian mitsha, and the Lesghian murch, a tree. It survives in Basque as raai, board, nuiiran, building timber, perhaps as makilla, a stick, although some lexicographers connect the latter with makatu, to strike, and as arnetz, the oak. Already in considering the vocabulary of the
votive tablets, the Hittite and Basque word sit, fire, has appeared. It is here united to the verb take or taki. This is the Japanese taki, to kindle, the Basque equivalent of which according to form
is izek'i, but as that verb now means to burn, its place must be
taken by izio or irazeki, to light, kindle. Anciently izeki, as
izio seems to indicate, must have possessed transitive power The last word to consider is sugo. The Japanese, which has displaced su by hi, nevertheless uses shukkutua, shikkuiua, to denote, a fire, conflagration. The Basque has no such compound, being content with the ordinary su, but it is followed by k in composition, as in etchea sukartu da, the house has taken fire. There is thus the most perfect accord between the parent Hittite tongue of Syria and its living descendants in Japan and the Pyrenees.
The verification of this concordance may, for a time, be a work of
difficulty, but its accomplishment will amply repay all the labour expended upon it, by bringing to the philologist the knowledge of the most primitive forms of speech-thought, and enabling him, for comparative purposes, to add to the oldest Semitic and Aryan tongues that branch of the Turanian stock which was most intimately associated with ancient empire and civilization.

CHAPTER XI.
The Lion Inscription of King Kapini of Rosh.
Part I.
It appears from the description of Mr. Rylands that there were in Merash two lion figures engraved with Hittite hieroglyphics, and that they were found over a gateway by Dr. Gwyther of Torquay. Since then they have been removed to Constantinople with other Hittite relics. Mr. Rylands supposes from their resemblance to Assyrian sculptures, and notably to the lion from the palace of Assurnazirpal, now in the British Museum, that they were the bases of columns placed on either side of a door
way, into the sides of which they were built. The inscription is
chiefly on one side of the animal, including the large space between the legs and the bevelled part of its back and tail. But
besides the six lines thus situated, there are three and a portion of a fourth in the front of the animal. The two series of lines do not form one continuous inscription, as Mr. Rylands appears to think, but are distinct, that in front being a summar}' of the
larger one on the side. The other side of the stone is uninscribed,
flat, and was apparently built into a wall. The hieroglyphics of Merash are archaic, and some of them unlike anything found on more recent monuments. The symbol denoting the teeth is more
realistic than that of later inscriptions. A new ideograph, shaped like the Roman R, with an inserted dot between the perpendicular and the lower right limb, has the value kane, gane, but it is hard to say why. The hare is another ideograph with the phonetic value kita or kata. The latter portions of the fifth and sixth
lines on the side are so defaced and interrupted by cross lines that it is difficult to make any sense of them. Otherwise the inscription yields a continuous and intelligible narrative. That
on the side begins at the right hand of the top line, and proceeds in regular boustrophedon order to the end of line 4, but the
fifth and sixth lines begin on the left, probably on account of the



134 THE HITTITES.
many breaks on the right ends. The inscription on the front of
the lion connneiices at the left side of the first line, and continues
in boustrophedon order to the end.' Taking the moie important or side inscription first, and begin
ning in the order indicated, the following is its transliteration : Line 1, Koiiiiika tata Hapisata ha hasaka kane Niva Katara As'^ane Assaija Kanirabi mata niatanesa Kapini saishish Nazira Sagane saki tamaka Nira Hapisata nekine Line 2, Nazira Sagane saki kutakasata hapisata sari Bekaina Nenebasanesa haneta ka rata sahaimasa. kutakasa kane Rasa, aspikosa kuta rata Line 3, Algariga Rasanesa kala rakatsa Hapisata Bekama nekasa Rasanesa ahalsa Katara Nira tobaigo Aranzeka.sa, kanene aginba bago Akuni Rasanesa NeneLine 4, basa ta Bekama nekasa basaka ka kikune Assan Kitaraka mata Neritsuke saishsa Kataraka sintara saishish ketsutate sago bakera Bekama arte ketasuLine 5, taka slnetetsu Sagane saki Komuka ra^ Nira sinesa Komuka tamalane Nazira Sagane saki Nenebasa, Tsusane

Assurnazirpal was a great king and the father of the still greater Shalmanezer II. His date is variously fixed by different writers, Lenormant



136 THE HITTITES.
placing him between 980 and 905, and the Rev. J. M. Rodwell, the translator of his Annals, between 888 and 858 B.C., a difference of almost fifty years. He did not dare to attack the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, which were in a flourishing condition in his time, but his arms extended from southern Syria to Pontus and the borders of Colchis. The Nairi felt his power ; Carchemish under another Sangara paid him tribute, as did the cities of Phcenicia ; and Commagene he frequently overran. None of the
Assyrian monarchs, to judge by their inscriptions, were destitute of cruelty, but a more bloodthirsty wretch than Assurnazirpal, who smiles with benign dignity in the statue he has left of him
self, is not to be found on all the page of history. A very pious
worshipper of the gods, his records are stained with blood, and
filled with the accounts of such revolting barbarities as might make the world loathe the Ass3n*ian name. Yet he is the man whom king Kapini calls the Judge. The author of the inscription is one Kapini, who apparently did not recognize the supremacy of Carchemish, for he calls him
self the king of kings. He nowhere styles himself king of the Ras, the Rosh of the Bible, but from his frequent mention of that
nation and from the fact that his inscription was set up in Merash or Marasia, it may be concluded that he was their sovereign. It has already been shown that the Rosh are the people of Mareshah, the prefix ma being doubtless the initial
syllable in mata, king, meaning great or illustrious. It is the Japanese mi of the present day and is the root of the Bascjue TTiira, astonishment, admiration. As Rosh or Reshah, with this prefix, became Mareshah, so Gog became Magog, Rechab, Marcaboth, Dimnah. Madmannah, Cabbon, Machbenah, Caphal, Machpelah, Zahab, Mezahab. The recognition of this complimentary
or honorific prefix is indispen.sable to the student of Hittite proper names. The Assyrians do not seem to have known the northern Rosh by that name, but the southern division of the family
dwelling in Elam their inscriptions make fre(iuent mention of. Sargon calls them Ras; Sennacherib, Rassu; Assurbanipal, Rasi
;
but Tiglath Pileser II., Marusu.^ They are there connected with the Lehitau or Lihutahu, who were Lydians, their eponym being
2 Records of the Past, vii. 27, i. 44, 82, v. 101.



THE LION INSCRIPTION OF KING KAPINI OF ROSH. 137
the god Laguda.^ Two Lacotenas near Marasia, the one in northern Syria, the other in south-eastern Oappadocia, preserved the connection; and in Lydia, where Alyattes reigned, also reigned Myrsus, and flowed the Maisyas river, while more than one Larissa honoured the name of Rosh with a different prefix, not the Semitic article, but the Khitan al, strong or powerful. It has been said, wherever you find Larissas there you find the Maeonians. This is true, for Maeon was a later name of the Lydians or Rosh, coming to them in the line of Rekem. These Maonites or Mehunim are mentioned in many parts of the Bible as dwelling from the Arabian border of Palestine northward to the land of the Ammonites. In I. Chronicles iv. 41, their name is translated by " habitations " ; and it is a curious coincidence that the derivation of the name Mosynoeci, by which they were known in Pontus, is given by Strabo as mossyn, a tower, or as other writers translate it, a wooden house. Though adopted by the Greeks, it is a foreign word, and Professor Sayce calls it Moschian.* The medial ayin in Meon or Maon gives the Mehun and Mosyn forms which find illustration in the Cappadocian area of Lacotenia and Marasia as Messena. In the same way the name given by the Hebrews as Laadah, the father of Mareshah, containing a medial ayin of doubtful consonantal power, became Lehitau, LagUda, Lacote, Lydia. That there may have been Lydians in the western extremity of Asia Minor in the ninth century B.C., cannot be denied. They were there apparently two centuries later, for Assurbanipal speaks of their king Gyges as dwelling far over the sea. But great changes took place during these two centuries, so that it is possible that Marasia
was the Lydia n centre of the earlier period. Were early Roman
history to be trusted, the time of the Etruscans' advent to Italy
would help to decide the question, for besides the general tradition that they were a Lydian colony, and Ovid's statement that they were Maeones, the name Rasaena decides their Lydian and
Hittite connection. Kapini is not a name certainly that belongs to Lydian

tradition. He is called b}' Assuniazirpal, Habini of Tul Abnai,and that monarch also mentions Akuni, son of Adini of Habini, of the city of Tul Abnai, thus apparently setting forth three generations of his family. " In these days " he says, " I recei\ed the tribute of Habini of Tul Abnai, four maneli of silver and 400 sheep. Ten
maneh of silver for his first year as tribute I imposed upon him." Siialmanezer II. also says : " In my seventh year to the cities of Khabini of the city of Tel Abni I went. The city of Tel Abni his stronghold together with the cities which were
dependent on it I captured." In his monolith inscription he states that he received the tribute of Khapini of Tul Abna.^ The Tul Abnai of Assurnazirpal and Shahnanezer is an Assyrian adaptation of the names Aravene and Saravene. The former was in Syria to the north of Commagene and contained a Lacotena : the latter was in south-eastern Cappadocia and also contained a Lacotena. These words have no connection of any kind with the stony hill or cairn which Tul Abnai means. They represent the Biblical Beth Zur descended from Maon, the Hittiteform of which would be Tsura-wuMe, the word wune being Circassian for house, and the equivalent of the Hebrew heth. Sargon calls the region Surgadia, and Tiglath Pileser II. called the southern or Elamite namesake of it Saragitu.*^ It will yet appear that Kapini terms himself king of Surakata. The replacement of vnme by /ir/i(/, may be explained b\^ the Circassian hachhishish, a dwelling, the Japanese yado, a home. Probably kata was the
original Hittite word for house, which, in its tii-st syllable, fur
nished the hieroglyphic of a house with the phonetic value ka. In Lydia the word was reduced to Sar-des, perhaps a corruption
of Sar-etche, in w^hich the Basque form replaces the older Hittite house name. Joannes Lydus sent etymologists on a fruitless errand by stating that Sardes was the old Lydian word for " year." ' It really means the house of the heavens, and might
thus denote a zodiac, for sar is the Basque zeru, Lesghian ser^sur,

and Japanese sora, the heavens. No Khitan word for the year answers to sardes, unless it be the Georgian tselitzadi, the derivation of which is unknown to the writer. The Circassian
seems to agree in itlshes, tle^i, but these words have lost all semblance to the name of the Lydian capital, if they ever had any. The present Basque word for 5'ear is urte, but in Etruscan days
it was arsa. The representative of Sar-etche in Etruria was Soracte. Virgil, Pliny and Strabo speak of the peculiar religious
rites connected with this piace.^ The region over which Kapini held sway extended from Commagene to the north and west, and eastwards into Armenia. Between him and the king of Commagene there was war. The king's name in the inscription is Apisata or Hapisata. Three times Assurnazirpal mentions Commagene, but only once does he 7*efer to its ruler Catuzilu. His successor was Kundaspi, and, a hundred years later, Kustaspi sat on the throne of Commagene, being the successor of that Teraka whom Sagara elevated to myalty. Professor Sayce identities Kustaspi with what he terms the Aryan Hystaspis. Now Hystaspis was a Mede and the Medians have been proved to be Hittites ; the succession, therefore, of Kustaspi and Teraka, although in inverted order, is like that of Hystaspes and Darius, thus rendering it probable that Darius Hystaspes was of the Commagenian line.^ Among Hittite names resembling that of Hapisata are those of two kings of the Nairi mentioned by Samas Rimmon, Aspastatauk of the Huilai, and Bazzuta of the Taurlai.^*^ Of the Commagenian royal names, that of Sadi-an-Teru exhibits what may be the second part of Hapisata in the element Sadi. Assuming the word to be compound and the parts not to depend upon each other, as in genitive government, the name of the hostile monarch may be inverted as Sata-hapi, which is not indeed Kustaspi, but an advance towards it. The sata in this name can hardly be other than that which has appeared in Hamath i, and iv. and in Jerabis i., meaning to guard, protect, save, the Basque zaitu, and Japanese

140 THE HITTITES.
tsutsu. It is also, strange to say, the Greek sozein, whence
soter, a saviour. In the treaty of Rameses II. with the Hittites, the chief god of that people is frequently mentioned, his name
being in the Egyptian rendering, Sutech.^^ This is the precise
equivalent of the Greek soter, the Hittite sign of agency, ko, being
added to sata, to make Satako, a savioui-. The prefixed hapi in Hapisata seems to be an old word for town, surviving in its simplest form as fit, an imperial city in Japanese, but the original of the Georgian daba and sope-li, town, village, the Moesian and Dacian dava, and the Celt Iberian deba, duba. In modern Basque it maybe found as a constituent of ibirizka, village, habi,
abi, a nest, abata, a hunter's lodge in a tree, in which case it answers to the Japanese daiba and odaiba, a fort. It thus
denoted originally a fortified town situated on an eminence,
natural or artificial, and the use of the same term to designate a nest may be illustrated from the prophecy of Balaam, wdio says of the Kenite, " Strong is thy dwelling place and thou puttest thy nest in a rock." ^^ The name Hapisata is then the Hittite equivalent of the Greek Sosipolis, a name applied to Jupiter by the Magnesians of Lydia, and to a daemon worshipped in Greece by th©
Eleans.^^ There were at least two cities called Sozopolis, the one
in Pi.sidia in Asia Minor, the other in north-eastern. Thrace. All
of these seem to have been Greek translations of the significant Hittite name. It is not essential to Khitan syntax that the verb should follow its regimen, so that sata being a verb, and not the noun satako, may either precede or follow hapi, to signify " saving, guarding the city," or " he guards the city." It is probable that the city of Astapa in Baetic Spain bore originally the name Satahapi. Before leaving the royal line of Commagene it may be remarked that its ancient names Cili-an-Teru and Calian-Teru are commemorated by two places called Celenderis, the one in Cilicia, the other in Argolis of Peloponnesus. The latter was situated in a region famous for the worship of Jupiter Soter. The former was founded by Sandochus, the son of Astinous, who married Thanacea or Pharnace, daughter of Megessarus, their
" RecordH of the Past, iv. 25, aeq. '2 Numbers, xxiv. 21. 13 Strabo, xiv. 1, 41 ; PauHanias, vi. 20.



THE LION INSCRIPTION OF KING KAPINI OF ROSH. 141
offspring being Cinyras, king of Assyria. Such is the tradition reported by Apollodorus, who says that Sandochus came to Cilicia from Syria. Cinyras was the father of the famous Adonis worshipped in Phoenicia and Cyprus, but also in Argolis, where Pausanias places his temple near that of Jupiter the Saviour.^* A form of Celenderis is Cleandria in the Troad not far from the
river Andii'us, the proximity of which appears to indicate an
ethnical and philological connection, and to require that Anteru in Cili- Anteru be regarded as one word. In this case the whole name will be Kula-indar, the first part being the old Hittite word for city, the second the Basque for strength, thus answering to the Greek Astykratos, Polikratos, of which Poly crates ma}- have been a corruption. Were it not indeed for the express statement of Herodotus that Polycrates of Samos was a Greek, there would
be great reason for regarding his name as a translation of CiliAnteru, inasmuch as Samos is but an abbreviated Samosata, the capital of Commagene.^' Hapisata had deprived Kapini of many cities, some of which the latter monarch took back evidently by force of arms. These were Nira, Katara-Assane, Assaga and Kanirabi. The position of two of them is well marked hy the classical geographers, namely, Katara-Assane and Kanirabi. The former is Citharizum, on the Arsanian branch of the Euphrates in Armenia ; the latter, Analiba in Cappadocia, a short distance to the north-west of tlie
Armenian city. In another part of the inscription KataraAssane is called Assan-Katara. Neither of these forms of Citharizum is found on the Assyrian monuments. But Kanirabi goes back to the time of Tiglath Pileser I., who reigned in the eleventh century B.C. He speaks of Milidia, the Melitene of Cappadocia, as belonging to the country of the Khani-Rabbi, but
makes no mention of Katara-Assane.^*" Assurnazirpal tells of the
tribute he received from the princes of the land of Hanii-abi, but is silent regarding Katara. Finally Esarhaddon, speaking of his return to Assyria from the snow-clad mountains of the north to

avenge his father's death, tells how he was waylaid in the hill country of the Khani-Rabbi by all their warriors.^' These Khani-Rabbi were at one time a powerful Hittite family, being the Beth Kapha and the Rephaim of the Hebrew record. ^^ Their name is o-iven by anticipation in the Book of Genesis, for, although their race was in existence in the time of Abraham, the eponym Kapha was much later. That race inhabited Ashteroth Karnaim in Baslian, so that they belong to the Ashterathite branch of the Hittite stock. Kapha himself is the Hammu-Kabi of the Assyrioioo-ists, who is said to have headed a stranger dynasty of Babvlonian kings, and whom George Smith placed about 1550 B.C. This is almost two centuries too late, as the notice in
Genesis is two centuries too early. Hammu-Rabi, or, as the Turanian Accadian gives it, Gaammu-Kabi, means in As.syrian Kimta-Rapastuni, that is, the family of the great or of the giants. It mioht also mean the family of the physicians, and either of these meanings may be expressed by the Hebrew Beth-Rapha. It is evident, however, that these are all translations, in part, at
least, of a Hittite word. There is no difficulty wnth the kani of Kani-Rabi, which is more to be trusted than the Accadian gaaminu ; it is the Japanese kanai, family. But what is Rabi or Kapha ? In Aztec a physician is tlama, which should,
according to the laws of phonetic change, be ra7)ia or raba in
other Khitan languages possessing the letter r. The Bascjue for
a remedy is erreparu, derived from eri, sick, ill ; the Japanese for the same is riyoji, but its etymology hardly favours the connection^
althouf^h the Choctaw, which is just American Japanese, has
ilillih, disease, ilaivelih, care for the sick, alikchi, a doctor. The
reason for an incjuiry into the meaning of this word Kapha is that the Greeks carried away the tradition of a Hittite family of
physicians in their legend of Melampus. The Basque laminae or labinak, beings possessed of magical power, may be a reminiscence of the Kephaim.'^ The Greeks knew the Kani-Rabi as the MeRopes or Me-Ropidae, and in old Trojan days joined with them

the peoples of Pedasus and Lyrnessus.-*^ But, lonf( before, the Egyptians met them in Egypt itself, along Avith other Hittite tribes, as the Eubu or Lubu, generally translated Libyans and
connected with the Berbers. Yet these Rubu took possession of the cities of Egypt on the western side of the Nile as far as Memphis, which no body of Libyan colonists that history knows of would be
likely to do, and certainly they were not Libyan al)origines. Their dress indicates rather that they came from a country of a compara
tively cold climate.-^ As Rephaim the Bible frequently alludes to them, and mentions their dwellings near Jerusalem and in Ephraim.^' In Lidia a migrating body of this people was known by the name Kamarupa.-^ In the time of the inscription under consideration the main body of the tribe probably was in northeastern Cappadocia, where the classical geographers place Analiba,
north of the Melitene. The only record that seems to relate to Katara-Assane or Citharizum is the Annals of Assurnazirpal. That monarch speaks of " the strong cit}^ of Katrabi, a city exceedingly strong,'' which he took in Bit Adini, a region that he connects with Tul Abnai of Habini. The remaining places, Nira and Assaya, are
easily identified in Assyrian story after this. Along with the princes of Hanirabi, Assurnazirpal mentions the land of Nilaai, of which he makes Ahiramu, the son of Yahiru, the lord. Then, after the passage relating to Katrabi, he refers to the same region under the two names Nilaya and Anili, which seem to indicate a double monarchy in the land. A third time he tells of the tribute of Nilaya and associates it with Assaya, whose king was Giri-Dadi, a northern Hadad-Ezer. These two places were doubtless situated on the borders of Commagene and Armenia. At first Kapini, either from fear of Hapisata or from a desire to keep the peace, called in the intervention of the Assyrian

monarch, requesting him to make the king of Coramagene surrender Nira or Nilaya. At the time that he did so, Hapisata was continuing his conquest of Kapini's subjects by his general named Bekama. The Assyrian inscriptions mention a name
somewhat similar and sufficiently rare in form to make its appearance at the time more than a mere coincidence. This is
Assurnazirpal's " Bahiani of the land of the Hittites," whom he introduces between Nilaya and Hanirabi. Again, just before Anili and Nilaya are referred to, he says : " To Bit Bakhiani I
approached ; the tribute due from the son (or tribe) of Bakhiani I added to mj" magazines." When he mentions Nilaya the third time under its king Ittiel, he makes no allusion to Bakhiani, but
refers immediately to the tribute of Commagene. Neither does his son Shalmanezer number Bakhiani among his tributaries. The first passage relating to the general of Hapisata is confusing as rendered into English by Mr. Rod well. It reads: "In those days the tribute of Ahiramu son of Yahiru of the land of Nilaai son of Bahiani of the land of the Hittites and of the princes of the land of Hanirabi I received." The language of the Hittite inscription seems to imply that Bekama, rightly or wrongly, was the ruler of Nira, and that, deserting Kapini, he had transferred his allegiance to Commagene. As the general of Hapisata he sought to bring other subjects of the king of Marasia under the sway of the (Jommagenian monarch. He, for this purpose, invaded the land or city of Nenebasa, which is characterized as subject to Ras or the great nation of the Rosh, of which Kapini was the head. Nenebasa was apparently not far from Citharizum.
It is probable, therefore, that it gave name to the Niphates mountains in south-western Armenia, just under Citharizum. Tiglath Pileser I. records warfare with the people of the countries of Tsai'avas and Ammavas in the land of Aruma or Armenia.^* Shalmanezer calls the same place Nappigi, for it was one of the
cities of Bit Adini.-'^ It is well authenticated as belonging to Ras, for among the Elamitic people of that name, was an Ammava, and Napsa was one of their gods.-" Assurnazirpal

and Kapini both sent word to Bekama to withdraw from the territory of the Nenebasa, which he did not do. On the contrary, despising the commands and making little of the opposition of Citharizum and Aranzi, he took the city and annexed it with other places to Commagene. Thereupon the people of Citharizum pressed their regulus Neritsuke, who is nowhere else mentioned^ to lay the matter before the Assyrian king, who, either in person or by deputy, enquired into the matter and sentenced the disobedient lord of Nira to receive punishment. This, judging by what we know of the tender mercies of Assurnazirpal, must have
been no light infliction, flaying alive being one of his ways of
rewarding his disobedient officers. Bekama is twice called the
nagusi in the inscription. It seems to be the same as the common Hittite word nabiisi, master, dominus, for the Basque has the two forms nagusi and nabusi, and the Japanese nushi', having suffered syncope, inclines to either form. The general of Kapini who waged unsuccessful war with Bekama was Akuni, otherwise a man of great note, at least in the eyes of the Assyrians. Assurnazirpal first alludes to him in
connection with the flight of Aziel, king of Lakai. He says : "To the cities of Dumite and Azmu belonging to the son ofAdini I went down after him," Next he tells how he stormed Katrabi, the strong city of Bit Adini. Then he received the tribute of Ahuni son of Adini of Habini of the city of Tul-Abnai, which has been found to be no city, but the countries of Aravene and Saravene. Ahuni, son of Adini, is thus either the grandson of Kapini, or his officer. The latter is most likely, as Kapini does
not call him his successor or heir. Farther on there seems to be a separation of Akuni and Kapini. " From Anili I withdrew ; to Bit Adini I approached ; the tribute of Ahuni son of Adini I received ; the chariots and warlike engines of the officer of Ahuni
I added to my magazines. In those days I received the tribtite of
Habini of Tul-Abnai : from Bit Adini I withdrew." If we may read, the officer Ahuni, and see in him a petty sovereign who acted as Kapini's general, as Bekama did for Hapisata, the
constant association of his name and kingdom with Kapini's will be accounted for. Akuni seems to have been the chief opponent of the great Shalmanezer. In his monolith inscription he says :



146 THE HITTITES.
" The countries of Khasamu and Dikhnunu I passed through. To the city of Lahlahte which belonged to Akhuni the son of Adini I approached. Exceeding fear of Assur my Lord overwhehned him and he fled to his fortified city. The high ground I ascended. The city I threw down, dug up, and burned with fire. From the city of Lahlahti I departed. To the city of Ci . . . . ka, which belonged to Akhuni the son of Adini I approached. Akhuni the son of Adini to the power of his army trusted and battle and war he made with me. In the service of Assur and the great gods my Lords with him I fought. A destruction of him I made. In his
city I shut him up. From the city of Ci . . . . ka I departed. To the city of Burmarahna belonging to Akhuni the son of Adini I approached. The city I besieged, I took. Three hundred of their fighting men with arrows I slew. A pyramid of heads over against the city I built up. The tribute of Khapini of the city of Tul Abnai, of Gahuni of the city of Sa . . . . and of Cigiri Rimmon
of the city of .... silver, gold, oxen, sheep and goats I received.
"From the city of Burmarahna I departed. In great vessels
of skins the river Euphrates I crossed, and the tribute of Katazila
king of Commagene, silver, gold, oxen, sheep and goats. I received. The city of Paburrukhbuni and the cities of Akhuni the son of Adini on the hither banks of the Euphrates I approached. A destruction of the country I made," etc. Professor Sayce, to whom the world is indebted for this translation, elsewhere admits having made a mistake in reading the name Cigiri-Rimmon, which should be Cigiri-Dadi, the same as Assurnazirpal's Giri-Dadi
of Assay a.-^ In the sequel of the inscription, Shalmanezer tells how Akhuni the son of Adini made a league with Khanu of the Samahlians, whom Professor Sayce places to the north of Marasia, but who might perhaps be better located about Salmalassus in north-western Armenia, with Sapalulme of the country of the Patinians in north-western Syria, and with Sangara of Carchemish^ against the Assyrian tyranny ; and, after the defeat of their armies, made another with the same monarchs, together with some others, of whom the names of Pikhirim of the Cilicians, and Buranate of the Yazbukians, alone are legible. Akhuni was the leading spirit in this war or succession of wars. Shalmanezer continues : " The

river Tigris I crossed. Through the countries o£ Khasamu and Dikhnunu I passed. To the city of Tul-Barsip, the stronghold of Akhuni the son of Adini, I approached. Akhuni the son of Adini to the power of his armies trusted and to meet me came.
A destruction of him I made. In his city I shut him up. From the city of Tul-Barsip I departed. In large vessels of skin the
Euphrates in its upper part I crossed. The cities of ga, Tagi . . . . , Surunu, Paripa, Mabasere, and Dabigu,six of his strongholds belonging to Akhuni, I took. His fighting men in numbers I slew. Their spoil I carried away. Two hundred cities which depended on him I threw down, dug up, and burned with fire." The gallant Akhuni was still unsubdued. " The river Tigris I crossed. The countries of Khasamu and Dikhnunu I traversed. To the city of Tul-Barsip, his stronghold, belonging to Akhuni the son of Adini, I betook myself. Akhuni the son of Adini from before the sight of my mighty weapons and my watchful battle
to save his life fled in fear. The Tio-ris I crossed to go agfainst
the hostile countries which had revolted. By the command of
Assur, my great Lord, the cities of Tul-Barsip, Align .... sagukana, and Manya, I seized. Men, even the men of Assyria in the midst of the country, I settled." Then Shalmanezer goes on to
tell how he gave to Tul-Barsip, Nappigi, Alligi and Ruguliti, Assyrian names which did not last long. The further mention of Akhuni seems to summarize some of the preceding events. "In the lowlands of the country of Kirruri at the entrance of the city of Arbela I came forth ; and Akhuni the son of Adini who with the kings my fathers a covenant and treaty had made, with regard to whom when at the beginning of my reign in the eponymy of the year of my own name from the city of Nineveh I departed, the city of Tul-Barsip his capital I besieged; with my
warriors I attacked it; a destruction in the midst of it I made : its groves I cut down; a falling rain of clubs upon it I poured ; from
before the sight of my weapons and the terror of my Lordship he retreated, and his city he left ; to save his life the Euphrates he crossed. In the second year during the eponymy of Assur-Bana3^aYutsur after him I rode down. The country of Sitamrat and the heights of the mountains on the banks of the Euphrates, which like a cloud equalled the sky, as a stronghold he made. By the

command of Assur, the great Lord, my Lord, and Nergal who goes before me, to the country of Sitamrat I approached. Where among the kings my fathers none within it had ever penetrated, in three days my warrior host traversed the mountain ; bravely in its heart opposition it brought, and ascended on its feet. The mountain I swept. Akhuni to the extent of his numerous forces trusted and against me came forth. The line of battle he formed. The weapons of Assur my Lord in the midst of them fell full. A
destruction of them I made. The heads of his fallen I cut off. With the corpses of his soldiers the mountain I strewed. His multitudes into the hollows of the mountains had been driven
together. Fierce battle in the midst of his city I engaged. Exceeding fear of Assur my Lord overwhelmed them. When they had descended, my feet they took. Akhuni with his numerous forces and chariots, his magazines and the goods of
their palaces in great quantities, of which the whole was not taken, to my presence I brought. The Euphrates I crossed. To my city Assur I conveyed them. As men of my own country I counted them." The capture of Akhuni is placed by this inscription in 856 B.C., in that of the Black Obelisk, in 854. It was the o-reat event of Shalmanezer's reion. The Black Obelisk tells how Shalmanezer in his second year besieged Akhuni in TulBarsip, taking Dabigu and other cities from him ; in his third year he took Tul-Barsip, which Akhuni had strongly fortified and from which he fled ; and in his fourth, he pursued the son of Adini to his stronghold on the mountain banks of the Euphrates, where he captured him with all his treasures and brought them to the city Assur. Three years later he went to Tel Abni or Saravene, and took possession of the dominions of Khabini. That Bit Adini belonged to the Rosh is evidenced by the appearance of the name in Elam, where the southern Rosh dwelt in the time of Sennacherib. It is coupled by him with Bit Ainukkan, an Assyrian form of Maeon, Magan, Mosyn, Messen.'^** The northern Bit Adini shouM be recognized by its capital TulBarsip and the neighbouring Nappigi, AUigi, and Ruguliti. Nappigi has already been identified with the Niphates mountains in name and was probably the place from which the district of

Amphissene was so designated. Alligi was represented in the
classical scheme of geography by Elegia, situated in an angle formed by the winding of the Euphrates west of the Niphates range. Ruguliti has left no memorial ; but Tul-Barsip must be
the classical Arsamosata, a famous city to the north-east of Elegia. The Hebrew equivalent of the Assyrian Tul-Barsip is Birzavith, the Tul or Hill being an Assyrian addition to the word,
and out of this, b}^ the rejection of the initial labial, the Greeks and Latins made Arsamosata. Birzavith belonorino: to the senior
family of Rosh is a name of great antiquity, being the original of Borsippa, one of the oldest cities of Babylonia. Strabo speaks of the inhabitants of this older Borsippa as astronomers, and mentions two famous ones among them, Cidenas and Sudinus, names so like Adini the father of Akuni, as to sugfcrest that such
forms were characteristic of Borsippian nomenclature.-'' The name of the country in which Tul-Barsip was situated, namely, Bit Adini, was doubtless derived from the father of Akuni. It is
first mentioned by Ashui-akhbal, a predecessor of Assurnazirpal,
as one of his conquests.^'' Barsip followed the western Hittites
in their migrations as Bersovia of Dacia, situated in the angle between the Tibiscus and Marisus rivers, whose names commemorated Thapsacus and Marasia. But, nearer to the ancient seat of Hittite empire, it survives to the present day in the name Perekop, designating the isthmus which unites the Crimea to the Russian main. The Umbrian Celts, whose ancestors had dwelt with the Cimmerians or Cymry in this Deffrobani, carried away the name as Tefrejovie, the prefixed De or Te being probably the Hittite syllable out of which the Assyrians made their Tul or Tel. The Greeks abbreviated the woi-d, calling it Taphrae, and connecting it, in their rage for etymologies, with taphros, a trench
,
although Strabo says the inhabitants were called Taphrii. The Umbrian Frejovie answers to the modern Perekop, or better still,
to Barsip. In Italy the people of this tribe built the city called by the Romans Bergomum, thus disguising the original as much as in the east Arsamosata disguised Barsip. The name was carried by the Iberians into the west, Burdova being its Spanish

reproduction, and Brocavum and Borcovicus those of Pictish Britain. The latter places were within the area of the Iberian
Brigantes.^^ It will be remembered that in the accounts of the fall of Nineveh in the time of Sar-acus, that monarch is said to have provided for the safety of his children by sending them away. According to Diodorus, they found refuge with the Paphlagonian Cotta ; but Athenaeus says that the Assyrian king sent them to the care of the king of Nineveh. This last apparently absurd
.
statement becomes historically probable, in view of the fact that there was a Hittite Nenebasa among the Niphates mountains, and, somewhere near at hand, a place called Paburrukhbuni by the Assyrians. In the time of Saracus they may easily have been under the sway of one petty king, Cotta or Gota, whose Nenebasa would be the Nineveh of Athenaeus, and whose Paburrukhbuni would furnish the Paphlagonia of Diodorus. Two other cities or regions mentioned in the Hittite inscription as belonging to the confederacy of Kapini are Algariga and Aranzi, the former being taken by Bekaraa, and the latter being associated with Citharizum in an effort to win Nira or Nilaya back from that conqueror. The only Algariga mentioned by the Assyrians was in the Ras country of Elam, but Lagalaga, a similar word, i? given by Assurnazirpal as the name of a city in Dagara, which was neighbour apparentl}^ to Nilaya and the land of Hanirabi.^'^ It may have been the same as Labiate, a city of Akhuni the son of Adini ; and is it not the same as that Ruguliti which constituted with Barsip, Alligu,and Nappigi, the tetrapob's of Adini ?•''" The name is a common Iberian one, finding representation among the Basques of the Pyrenees as Alzorriz, Licarraga, Lakharra, Lekhurin. The Basque word elkargo, a company, assembly, maj^ have been the orifjinal siofnification of the name. Sar^on mentions

on which Citharizum was situated was called Arsanius, indicatincf the existence at some time of a city or people upon its banks known by the name Arsan or Aranes. A word like Aranes would easily take the more euphonic form Arsanes. There was an Aranzese among the Elamitic Ras. The Basques also preserve this geographical name as Arronce, Errangua, Arrangoitz. The derivation of the word is probably from the Basque arrontatze,
meaning to harvest, but primarily, to work in concert, as a band of reapers or other labourers might do. Aranzi and Assan Katara failed to get back Nilaya. Akuni being without an army, thanks to the paternal care of Assurnazirpal, who informs us that he added to his magazines the chariots and warlike engines of the officer of Ahuni, the vigorous Bekama carried all before him. But, after Assurnazirpal as umpire adjudicated the disputed territories, and decided that Nira belonged to Commagene, we find Kapini, doubtless by the arms of Akuni, taking that land back again and thus commencing the career of conquest that made the son of Adini so formidable a rival of Shalmanezer. Many other places were adjudged to the king of Marasia, or to belong to the confederation of which he was the head. The names of many of these, owing to the breaks in the lines and to some defacements, are at present illegible. Of those that remain the first is Nenebasa, the Assyrian Nappigi immediatelj^ followed by Tsusane. This place belonged to Katara-Assane or Citharizum, as the sequel shows, and must be the Armenian Zanziuna of Shalmanezer, and the Danziun of
Tiglath Pileser II., who mentions it alonff with Elusfia, the Alligfu
of the older Assyrian monarchs.^* This identification is confirmed by the following name, Elisansu, which Tiglath Pileser names in the same category. Then follows Katni, which is only named by Assurnazirpal, and has been supposed to be a town on the Chaboras which flows into the Euphrates in the centre of the Mesopotamian border. But Assurnazirpal's account is that he crossed the Tigris, skirted the Kharmis and the Chaboras, and so came to the Euphrates, thus indicating that his Chaboras was the river of that name which flows into the Tigris.^^ The

152 THE HITTITES.
following Tane should probably be read Adini or Atini, denoting the city named after Akuni's father which gave name to the surrounding country. Sadikanni is twice mentioned by Assurnazirpal. It was near Commaffene, and at the same time on or near the banks of the Chaboras. Its king, or more probably, its Assyrian viceroy, was Salman-haman-ilin. It was also near Katni. In migration the name was carried to the north of lake Van as Astacana. Sakatsu is not easy to identify. Esarhaddon connects Ashguza under its king Ispakaya with the Manna or Armenians. It may be represented by Dascusa of the classical geographers, on the borders of Armenia and Cappadocia, and north of Elegia. Both Ashguza and Dascusa indicate that Asgutsa and not Sakatsu was the pronunciation of the name.^^ Massahuni represents the
name if not the locality of Amassihuni, one of the districts of the Nairi in the time of Tiglath Pileser I. In Assurbanipal's annals it is called Musazina, and is connected with the land of Dagara in which Lagalaga was situated; but Munzigaui, also mentioned by him as lying between Carehemish and Lebanon, bore a similar name.^" The classical Moxoene to the north-west of lake Van is probably the memorial of Massahuni. Samabane or Samaibane cannot be the Samibnaya of Sargon, for that town belonged to the Has of Elam, but it may be the Zamba of Assurnazirpal, which he places near the Tigris in the vicinity of Amida or Diarbekr, and the classical Sophene may be its
reminiscence. The only other legible name is Sastale. This is either Sedala in north-western Armenia, on a branch of the Apsarus, or Satala at the sources of the Euphrates in Armenia Minor or north-eastern Cappadocia, or some place nearer the Niphates mountains whose record is lost. It may be the Khastare of Tiglath Pileser I., but beyond the fact that it adjoined the
country of the Nairi, we are ignorant of its position.
All of these places lay in eastern Armenia, with the exception of one or two, like Kanirabi or Analiba, which were in northern Cappadocia, or, as it is generally called, Armenia Minor. They were all governed by kings whose allegiance appears to have been

THE LION INSCRIPTION OF KING KAPINI OF ROSH. 153
divided between Kapini of Marasia and Hapisata of Samosata, This division is not surprising, inasmuch as Commagene with
Cyrrhestica to the south of it, was of Rasite origin. It is certain,
however, that Kanirabi did not originally pertain to the family of Ras, although both families belonged to the Ashterathite
division of the Hittite race. The Chelubite branch of the
Ashterathites, of which the Kanirabi were the senior members, and the Shuhite, of which Ras was the chief representative, appear to have kept company in their northern migrations, for in Asia Minor both east and west they occupied adjoining countries ; in European Scythia they were found together by Herodotus and the classical geographers ; they dwelt side by side in Dacia, Moesia, and Thrace ; in Etruria they were mingled, and in Iberian Spain they maintained their ancient friendship. The Ras also are found throughout in alliance with the Moschi or Cappadocians, who belonged to the Zuzimite or senior division of
the Hittites. This alliance took its rise in Egypt during the
time of the Hittite or Hycsos' occupation of that country, and a tradition of it seems to have remained with the two f)eoples ever
after. It is somewhat remarkable, therefore, to find Kapini of Marasia making no mention of the Moschi in his inscription. The Rasites must have superseded the Moschi in the possession of the country north of Commagene, for, in the eleventh century B.C.,
during the reiorn of Tio^lath Pileser I, the Commacrenians and Moschi are named by that monarch as conterminous peoples. As for Tubal, the Tabalu of the Assyrian monuments, whom the Bible associates with Rosh and Meshech, it does not denote the Tubal of the Toldoth Beni Noah, as he lived long before the
nation forming period, but a Hittite family, the namers of Tibilisi
or Tiflis in Georgia, and who may be in part identified with the Tibareni of the Black Sea.

CHAPTER XII.
The Lion Ixscription of King Kapini of Rosh.
Part II.
The inscription on the front of the lion is brief compared
with that on the side, and contains little new material of an
historical character. It seems to have been intended as a
summary of the latter for the purpose of drawing attention to its detailed account and of pointing a salutary moral. The inscription begins on the left of the top line, and proceeds in boustrophedon
order to the end. Its transliteration is : Line 1, Ni tatsu Tsusnne ta Assam znzene ni tosatsu Neritsuka ni take Hapisata kakane sakake ni tatsu Line 2, Katara kala niatane Neritsuka niata Hapisata Komuka bisitane kata Tsusane alsa Line 3, Tsusane sa tosatsv. atesa Rasa Hapisata ne bakera Sarakata mata Line 4, Kuka saka kiku sari. The literal translation
:

The IIas friend seizes back Tsusane ; I, the king of Sarakata, deprive Hapisata of it. It concerns the grateful to know the reward.



THE LION INSCRIPTION OF KING KAPINI OF ROSH. 155
This part oi' the inscription says nothing of the Assyrians or
of the rival generals Bekama and Akuni. It records an exploit or feat of arms of Kapini himself. One single region is mentioned by him, that of Tsusane, the Assyrian Danziun or Zanziuna. Its name may have been Etchezaina, the house-guard, in Basque. It seems to have been situated to the south-west of Citharizum and
towards Commagene, but this is largely a matter of conjecture, for the Assyrian conquerors made no attempt to set forth their movements in geographical order, writing for their contemporaries only who were acquainted with the places whose names they commemorated, or, if for posterity, with the hope that these names
would not pass away. It is only incidentally, therefore, that they afford any help in determining with accuracy the positions of the towns and regions conquered by them. In the same way king Kapini probablj' held the opinion that everybody ought to know where Tsusane was. It was one of the conquests of Hapisata by his general Bekama, no doubt. So long as that redoubtable Hittite warrior lived, even Akuni, the illustrious opponent of Shalmanezer, could gain no advantage over the Comraaofenians. But Bekama had met his fate at the command of Assurnazirpal, and Commagene was deprived of her right hand. This was Kapini's opportunity. He went to Tsusane, took it from the enemy, and then relieved the city of Citharizum or AssanKatara, confirming Neritsuka in possession of both regions. This he sets forth as a reward for Neritsuka's gratitude or loyalty. Having accomplished this feat, he, like the Assyrian monarch whose warlike achievements he so feebly emulated, ordered the
lion statues, emblems doubtless of his prowess, to be erected, and
dictated, to the Hittite engraver, the account of his contest with Commagene, at the same time exalting himself and doing honour to his Assyrian lord. The admission of weakness in the side
inscription gives confidence to the historian of the truthfulness of
the narrative. Indeed, whatever else the Hittites were, they
were not liars. Some of their records may be puerile in their simplicity of statement, but they are all manly and honest. The
corrupting influences of oriental Aryan and Chinese servility and exaggeration, which were felt by Hittite immigrants into India
from the fourth or fifth century before the Christian era, and into



156 THE HITTITES.
China from the sixth century A.D., are to blame for kindred
vices among oriental Hittite stocks in Asia and America. The more savage branches, that had little contact with Indo- Aryan
and Chinese civ^ilization, are almost altogether free from the taint of falsehood. In the west, the Etruscan documents are singularly candid, contrasting favourably in this respect with contemporary
Roman and Celtic records. Kapini is very fond of the Has name. Four times in the
previous inscription it is contained, and here again it appears.
He is himself the E,as friend who, as such, interferes on behalf of Neritsuka, a man of Ras. It is a case of blood being thicker
than water, and displays a clannishness more characteristic of the Celt than of the Iberian. The Etruscans, Basques and Picts had no clans. Even among wild Khitan tribes, the tribe proper is regarded more as a political expedient than as a bond of kindred, the tendency being to subdivide into gentes, and narrow the limits of kinship. Wise men, therefore, like the Iroquois Hiawatha,
who sought to unite the divisions of even one tribe into a confederacy, were regarded as phenomenal, almost as innovators. And this was just the source of Hittite weakness. Herodotus
believed that if the Thracians, who were chiefly of Hittite origin, had been united, they would have surpassed all other nations; ])ut such a union he thought impossible.^ The Assyrians knew this trait and took advantage of it, disuniting their Hittite enemies and defeating them in detail. The Romans saw the same fault in the Etruscans, and by tactics like those of the Assyrians, overthrew their empire. And in Britain the total ex
tinction of the once powerful Pictish nationality was the outcome of a want of cohesion among its members. Even to Kapini, Ras was more than Khita. The only Hittite since Egyptijin days who appears to have sought a union of all the tribes or confeder
acies of tribes that constituted the nation, if a people of one blood but without common government can be called a nation, was Akuni the son of Adini, and he met with but partial success.'Traitors were easy to find amtrng theui, not that they were faithless

THE LION INSCRIPTION OF KING KAPINI OF ROSH. 157
people—far from it—but because they did not recognize the claim of their brethren upon their fealty, and allowed any family blood feud or even petty grievance to sever the bond, which if maintained, would have rendered them irresistible. Strange to
say, the sovereign state system of the Hittite confederacies is reproduced at the present day in the United States, and in the Canadian and Australian colonies of the British Empire, and threatens to dismember that empire's home kingdoms. If Hittite history all the world over has a voice to teach the politician of the present, it is a unanimous one that cries, Sovereign states have been our ruin. The most important statement in the inscription is that which makes Kapini king of Sarakata. This is the name of which the Assyrians made Surgadia and Sarragitu, and it may be represented by the Basque place named Charricota, of uncertain
etymology. It is also, as has been seen, an original of the Lydian name Sardes. The earlier Assyrian monarchs knew Sarakata as Tul Abnai, which was a significant Assyrian corruption of Zeruwune, a synonym of Zeru-kata. To the Semite the sound of a combined b and n indicated chiefly three things, a son, a stone, a building ; and this the Assyrian thought he found in wuAia or vttna. The prefixed zer he easily changed to Tel or Tul, and thus made of the whole word Tul Abnai, the stony hill. That the form Zeruwune was early in use is attested by an inscription of Tiglath Pileser II., who places Sarrapanu or Sarrabanu in Babylonia, where, as in Elam, the southern Ras dwelt.^ In Syria and Cappadocia also it seems to have been more in use than Sarakata, inasmuch as the latter form has left no distinct trace, while the classical geographers preserved the former in their Saravene and Aravene. The statement of Joannes Lydus, already alluded to, that sardes was a Lydian word for the year,
opens the way for much curious speculation. Literally the word means the house of the heavens, and the circuit of tliat house
by the sun would constitute the year. The idea of time is bound up with this circuit, and the Persian zarvan, time, although belonging to an Aryan people, is not necessarily unconnected with it, for all the primitive history of the Persians

This zarvan as Zarvan Akarana, time unlimited, became the supreme deity of the Zarvanite Zoroastrians, who brought the Ormuzd and Ahriman of their prophet under this principle of unity.* But Zarvan orZervan was an ancestral god of the Babylonians, from whom the Zarvanites borrowed much of their creed. Moses of Chorene, the Armenian historian, reports Berosus, the historian of Babylon, representing Zervan as lord of the earth in the time of Xisuthrus, his competitors and brethren whom he subdued being Titan and Japhetos.^ Now Xisuthrus, or Hasisadra, as his name has been read in the Chaldean Deluge
Tablets, is the Hittite Achashtari, the head of the Ashterathite
division of the Hittite race, whose record is Ashteroth Karnaim in Bashan.*^ To his line belonged the E,as, of whom came Beth Zur or Zeru-vune ; and the Moschi or Cappadocians, whom Japhetos represents, were their intimate allies, and probably for a long period their subjects, inasmuch as, in the enumeration of peoples, Rosh always has the pre-eminence. In the account of Berosus, therefore, we have no mythology but a fragment of ancient historical tradition relating to a time when the Moschi and Rosh ruled in Chaldea. In a paper on the astronomy and astrology of the Babylonians, Professor Sayce translates a document belonging to the time of Sargon of Agane, whom he places in the nineteenth century B.C., in which the following passage occurs: "On the twentieth day an eclipse happens. The king of the Hittites or the king of the Khati lives and on the throne
seizes." "^ Sargon was himself a Hittite on the father's side, but, as
a dispossessed prince who had to make his way to empire without paternal aid, he disowned the name and the language of his ancestors. George Smith assigns the year IGOO B.C. to Sargon but histrue date is between 1700 and 1750. As early, therefore, as the time of the patriarch Jacob, the Hittites were in occupation of kingdoms in Chaldea and the neighbouring Elam. In the peculiarly Hittite Dacia, answering in a measure to the modem Roumania, for the Roumanians are Romanized

Hittites, the Sarakata of Kapini, Saravene of the Greeks, and Sardes of the Lydians, became Ziri-dava, a town appropriately
situated on the Marisiis. In its case and in that of the Spanish Corduba or Cordova, kata, vune and etche were superseded by dava or duha, a Georgian word for town. Nearly all Khitan words for town are derived from house names. This dava, duha is the
Corean zihu, tsipka, a house, the. Japanese sumai, a dwelling, the Choctaw temaha, a town, and the Dacotah tihi, tipi, a house, as well as the Georgian daba. Saratov in Russia, lying north of Astrachan, is a word probably of the same origin, for the Ras were the most ancient inhabitants and the namers of Russia.^ In America the Iroquois had their heaven-town in Karonhiatsikowa or Longueuil, the karonhia of which answers to the Basque zeru and old Hittite sara.'-' In their mythology also they preserved the tradition of Berosus as quoted by Moses of Chorene, for Tharonhia-wakon, the holder of the heavens, is Beth Zur, Sarakata, Zer-vune, and his enemy whom he overcame, his brother Tehotennhiaron, is the Titan whom Berosus unites with Japetos as the opponent of Zervan. The Iroquois form of Titan, namely,
Tehotenn, is invaluable as defining the Hittite stock which united with the Moschi for a time in opposing the Ras in the line of Beth-Zur.^° The Hebrew form of the name is Zoheth, the Egyptian Zaiath, which as Zaiath-khirii may correspond to the Iroquois word in full. In the Izdubar legends the eponym of the
tribe is called Zaidu, but the Assyrians replaced the medial breath
ing by n, making the word Sandu ; their Sandu-arri and Sandusarvi of Cilicia reproducing the Egyptian Zaiath-khirii.^^ To the Persians the eponym was the wicked Zohak or Ashdahak, whence came the tw^in names Deioces and Astyages ; and this form was adopted by Esarhaddon to denote a Cilician tribe. " Trampler on the heads of the men of Khilakki and JDuhuka, who dwell in the mountains which front the land of Tabal." ^The Titan of Berosus thus represents a Xanthian or Sindian

tribe of the Cilicians, which, in migration, is or was known as the Circassian Adighen, the Dahae of Media and Bactria, the Tchuktchis of the Koriak stock in Siberia, the Dacotahs proper, and the Tshekto or Choctaws of America.^^ At tlie same time that the Ii'oquois tradition furnishes this information, it indicates the
Hittite family, to which at least part of the Iroquois confederacy belonofed, as that of Ras. This is confirmed by the name of their o-od of war, Agreskoue among the Iroquois and Areskoui among the Hurons, who is Reshah or Mareshah, tlie eponym of the Ras, and the Ares of the Greeks, who borrowed him, with many other
mythological personages, from the Hittites, as the Romans borrowed the fuller name Mars from the Etruscans.^* The very forms Ares and Mars indicate a Hittite origin. It will be observed that the caparisoned horse's head in the centre of the third line has been rendered by ra, to make with
the following symbol the word Rasa. It is vain to look for this symbol in Aztec, as the horse only came to America with the Spaniards ; nor do the Japanese or Basque languages furnish names for that animal whose first syllables conform. But the Lesghian artsh, urtshi, and Mizjejian ulok, agree, and the Corean mnl may represent the mari oi the Basfjue zamari. From such a Hittite source would come the Cymric inavcli and Gaelic inarc. The English horse, old German and Scandinavian hors, modern German rons, have no affinities with other Indo-European names for the king of domestic animals. They must, therefore, be loanwords from an underlying Turanian stratum of language, and that language the Hittite. In some of the non-Aryan languages
of India, the horse is called roh, rhi, hroh, and these must be the same as the Japanese ro, meaning a mule. The Japanese uma, horse, seems to have been borrowed from the Chinese ma. The Ugrians again in the Mordwin branch have cdasha, in the Vogul l(}, III and liuv, in the Magyar lo, and in the Ostiak, lou, loch and
lofj. If the Ugrians be not a division of the Hittites, they are at
least the race with which pliilologically and otherwise the Khitan

have most in common.^^ Coins of Larissa in Syria and Thessaly, of Argos, Orisia, Rhaucus, and of the Spanish Arsi, bear the
device of a horse, and it is exceedingly probable that these devices, descended to the Aryan conquerors of these places from the hieroglyphic system of their Turanian predecessors.^^ Much of Welsh mythology circles about the horse in the persons of March and Meirchiawn, who, taken back to their originals, may exhibit an alliance of Iberians and Cymri in the ancient days of Mareshah. The early inhabitants of that Chaldea in which Ras and Moschi once held sway, are known from ancient monuments to have been chiefly Sumerians and Accadians, the latter being the Turanian element whose affinities are with the
Uorians. Yet their lansuaoe is full of Celtic roots. So far we have no monuments of the Sumerians, whom there are good reasons for regardino- as the ancestors of the later Zimri, Gimiri, Cimmerians, and Cymry, and thus as Celts, in contact with Turanian peoples to whom they lent and from whom they borrowed much in speech and oral ti'adition. ^lian has a story that there lived anciently in Italy a being named Mares who was so called because he 'was half horse ^ and half mau.^" It is easy here to detect the Celtic marc, but when this Mares is connected with the Marsi said to have descended from Marsus and Circe, he K'ads the ethnologist into an Iberian rather than into a Celtic
connection, for the Sabine cantons were of Hittite origin and
claimed kindred with the Etruscans. Yet, as in Italy, so in all parts of Europe where Celts are found, there will be found well defined traces of conterminous or intermingled Iberians, so that the Spanish name Celt-Iberian might be applied everywhere to a mixed population migrating, from ancient Chaldean days, along the Hittite lines. It may be hard to tell from which race, the Celtic or the Iberic, the horses of St. Mark of Venice took their
rise ; but it is certain that the Maruts and their progenitor, Rudra, the wild horsemen of Sanscrit mythology, were borrowed by the Aryan Indians from the Indo-Scythic aborigines whose blood runs in the veins of the horse-lovinsr Mahrattas.^^

102 THE HITTITES.
Among the words occurring in the inscription on the side of the lion, the first requiring attention is fata, which has been
translated, possessing. Its relations are with the Basque eduAsi
eduki, the originals of the modern enJsi and riiJn, to have, hold,
possess. Their Japanese eijuivalent is t((wotf<ii, which is really
composed of two verbs, the lost fata of the Hittite, and motsu, having the same signification. The verb hasuka is thoroughly
Basque, being ebatsi, ebcu i, rob, fle]>rive ; as ehaska it means a la
derobee, by stealth. It survives in Japanese as ubai,ubatta, to rob,
take by force. Another verb, saUhwh or salshsa, appears thrice in the inscription with the meaning, press ; it is the Japanese seki, saisokti, and the Basque estutzen. Several verbs begin with
fa or to, such as tamaka., fabaigo, tamalatic In these the first
.syllable repi'esents the Japanese ato and Basque aAze, back. The maka of ta-maka is the Basque eman, ernaten, to give, which becomes cinak in the imperative and in compounds. In Japanese this verb is disguised as ivatashi, wafasii, which, however, agrees
with the commoner Hittite form raatsu in Haniath iii. The
root is ma, to give, in Etruscan vui, in Basque ema. It is the Choctaw imah, the Aztec maca, and the Sonora mtd>-, r)iaka, I'/niaka. The baigo of t(d>aigo contains liai or bea, answering to
the Basque bear, in bcartu, oblige, constrain, which in its primitive
sense of duty, corresponds to tlie Japanese beki, ought. The
final go is the Basque particle with futuie or infinitive power,
meaning to, in order to. In tamalanc, the verb, to give, is in its simplest form ma, and lane is a verb foiined from al, power, force, whicli the Bascpie has lost, but which the Etruscan
possessed as alin. Thus fa maka, means give back, taJxitgo, to force
.jack, and tamaiane, compel to give back. In the .second line appear kutakasa and kutakasata. Of these the first part is the
Etru.scan kuti'. and Ba.sqne ekii. to undertake, begin, attack,
being, as M. Van Eys indicates, the ecjuivalent of the Spanish acometer. This verb has been sufficiently explained under
Jerabis iii. The second part is the Bas(|ue ikasi, ika.sfen, to
learn, so that kiifa has the power of a causative, and the whole verb is a synonym of the Ba.sque erakasi, cause to learn, teach.
From the verb kikv, to hear, tlie Japanese lias derived keiko, learning, and kiyoja , teaching. The finnl f<i of kutakasata is



THE LION INSCRIPTION OF KINO KAPINI OF ROSH. 163
hard to explain. The only parallel to it is in temakat(t. of
Hamath ii., where it looks like the Japanese sign of the preterite
tense. The language of this inscription, however, is distinctively Iberian or Basque, and in that language there is no such sign. Final ta should be equivalent to the Basque d(i, he is, du, he has or does, which replaces the commoner auxiliary ki or ka. The
word rendered haneta is blurred in the inscription, so that the reading is doubtful. It may answer to the Basque ontasun,
goods, possessions, or better, to undo, extremity, denoting, like the following kuta, the Basque gede, Japanese kata, side, bound
ary, limit. This word is followed by rala, an impossible word
in Japanese, which has no I. It is the Basque h-uli, irauli, to turn, turn over, turn back. The following sabaimasa, or rather eshaimasa, consists of the bai or bea which has already appeared
in tahaigo, and the negative particle ez, the whole word esbai
being the original of the Basque ezbear, misfortune, evil, that which ought not to be. The Japanese inverts the parts and lengthens the word into bekaradzu. In viasa we have tna, give, and sa, the Hittite and Etruscan sign of agency ; hence masa
is the giver. In Basque e'inaitza is a present.
In the third line the first syllable of rakat&u is doubtful, the
figure which has been read ra being indistinct. If read correctly
it is the Basque erchatu, force, constrain. The carelessness of the
Hittite scribe or the general indifference of his people to vowel values presents what is undoubtedly the same word as nekasa and nekusa. This is the Basque nagusi, a variant of the commoner Hittite and Basque nabusi. It has been widely spread abroad, for we find it in the Agow, Galla, and Tigre languages of Africa as negus, negusish, and in the Zulu Caffre as enkhose, always denoting a lord and master. The verb <dsa, ahcdsa, is a compound of al, power, force, the meaning of which is evidently to force away. The Basque men, as a synonym of al, akcd, power, has superseded the latter in compound words. Its compound, nienderatu, to subjugate, consists of men and artu, to take, hold, treat ; its literal translation is to apply force. In the same way
alsa may be said to consist of al and atzi, atzitu, hold, touch, and
also to mean to apply force. The Japanese equivalent of al is riki, but that language has lost nearly all its compounds of the



16-i THE HITTITES.
word. The post-position bago, without, answering to the Basque
haga, gabe, is the Japanese hoka, the ho of which means the same as ha, a place. There is no doubt that ho is a phonetically converted ba, showing a movement on the part of the Japanese towards that open-mouthed speech which has culminated among the Iroquois in the rejection of all labials. The fourth and fifth
lines contain three compounds of sin, namely sintara, sinetetsu, sinesa. This sin is doubtless the Basque word of identical form ; but that has changed its signification, denoting at present an
oath, and in its compounds setting forth, belief, witness, pledge, seriousness. Its original meaning seems to have been thought, opinion, judgment, answering to the Japanese sltin and zoni. In Etruscan sin meant to think, liut in Basque, etsi, etsten. to
judge, consider, appreciate, has taken the place of sin. • In sintara or sintar the word is followed by what is now called the ethnic
suflBx in Ba.sque, but that is not really such, for it appears in
anaitar, fraternal, from anai, brother, and in itsastar, a sailor
from itsaso, the sea. The sintar, therefore, is the judge or
umpire ; sin-tetsu, literally, to set up an opinion, means to
sentence ; and sin-etsi, now signifying to believe, in Hittite days
bore the sense of adjudicating. Probably sin was the root of
^WS'CTI, right, equitable, in Hittite and Basque. The cZi?i, just, of
the latter language, looks like a Semitic loan. Hittite words for punish and punishment are hetsutate and hetstdaka. The first
part of these is gaitz, bad, which appears in gaztekatze, to puni.sh,
literally, to inflict bad. The tate of the verb is the element that appears in the Basque saris-tatu, haris-tatu, lan-dutzu, to
reward, sew, cultivate, from sari, recompense, hari, thread, Ian,
work, and in gaich-totu. to become wicked, from gaich, gaitz,
bad. It is probably the Japanese tachi, tatsu, to stand up, set
out, begin. The noun is formed by converting the final te of the verb into ka or ko. Ungrateful is the meaning given to sago hakera. The Japanese sha means thanks, ackn<jwledgment, confession, and shows the root of the Ba.sque rftt/.-r'r, thanks, which
makes eskcrgabe, ungrateful. The Hittite word was sago or es-go, and the following bakera is the variant of g'xbe, namely, bage,
in the e(|uivalent of the Bas(iue bagarlk, as in dada bagarik, without doubt. For hagaric, bakera, the Etruscan has niikara.



THE LION INSCKIPTION OF KING KAPINI OF ROSH. 165
and the Japanese nakereha. The Basque character of the inscription is evinced by the presence in it of azpiko, a subject, and arte to receive, two forms stillin use in the Pyrenees.
In the inscription on the front of the lion tatsu appears twice,
once in the sense of setting out, and again in that of setting up. Twice also appears tosatsu, a compound, like tamaka and tabaigo, of the Japanese ato, Basque atze, back, and the Basque itsatsi, seize. The Japanese root in tsu assumes now the form
tsukami, to give the sense of seizing. Near the end of the first line is kakane, which denotes the same verb as kuka of the fourth line. The invariable Etruscan form of this verb is kuka, and it
answers to the Basque egoki, to concern, relate, pertain to, and to
the Japanese kaka-ri. It is in the infinitive when ending in nc,
the post-position, to. The following saJcake is a noun formed from the Basque atzegin, to scratch, the pronunciation of which may have been atz-eg-ik. In Etruscan this verb was used to denote engraving, writing on a monument. In the second line there is a most unlooked-for word, bisitane, answering to the Basque bizitzen, to live, and biztandu, to dwell. In Japanese the Basque bi is mei, life, and with the prefix siv this becomes su-mai, to dwell. The following kata, Japanese, side, region,
place, only survives in Basque in kotor, sloping ground, kanti, a place near at hand, whence kantitu, to leave a place, and kantoi,
a quarter, region. In the third line the word atesa occurs,
consisting of the Basque adi, good understanding or concord, and the sign of agency. The modern Basque word for friend is
adiskide, but as the final kide means like, similar, it is evident
that the idea of friendship must have previously existed in adis. The form bakera is found in the same line as a verb meaning
deprive. The ancient Hittite, therefore, possessed all the flexi
bility of the Basque in its power to verbalize any part of speech.
In the last line saka is the same word as the sago of the side
inscription, being the equivalent of the Basque esker, but its following kiku is the purely Japanese verb, to hear, which has no immediately corresponding verb in Basque. This kiku is a comparatively rare form of the verb to hear. It is not to be found among all the non-Aryan languages of India, whose verb to hear generally resembles the Basque entzu, entzmi.



](jG the hittites.
In this place Idkii means to learn, tlnis answering to the Basque ikasi. Tlie Hittite, however, has both verbs, for ikasi has
alreadv appeared in the side insci-iption. The last word, sari, is Basque, and means a reward ; it answers to the Japanese fiharei, an acknowledgment, the root of which is sha, thanks. Thus, the two apparently distinct Basque words esker and sari have the same root, a root which is found in the form ish or ich
on the Etruscan inscription known as the Leaden Tal)let of Magliano.^' It is not surprising when words from a common
source differ so wideh^ in their j-adical as do sari and esker, that it should be a matter of some difficulty to determine the exact phonetic values of the ancient hieroglyphics by which such
radicals are set forth.

PART II.
THE HISTORY OF THE HITTITES.






169
CHAPTER I.
Sources of Hittite History.
There are actual Hittite records in existence which have been preserved by branches of the great dispersion that survived the continuous assaults to which the race has been subjected from early
days. Chief among these is the history of Japan ; but it does not profess to carry us back farther than the middle of the seventh century B.C., and even for that period has been so disguised hy national vanity and by attempts to synchronize it with the history of China, that in itself, without other materials for comparison,
it is almost valueless.^ There is no real history of Corea and
the Loo-Choo Islands, but many historical facts are to be gleaned from their literatui^. Mexican history, Toltec and Aztec, compiled about the time of the Spanish Conquest from older documents, is very full and complete, back to the beginning of the eighth century A.D. The histories of Yucatan and Guatemala
are of greater antiquity, but, as belonging to an entirely different race, can«ot be expected to shed much light upon Hittite origines.^ Shortly after the conquest of Peru, natives of that country, Spaniards indeed, but who prided themselves most upon their Peruvian descent, compiled from oral tradition the annals of
the fallen empire. One of these records begins in the commencement of the eleventh century A.D ; the other professes to relate the history of Peru from the five hundredth year after the
Deluge.'* Fragments of history are also to be found in the
traditions of less civilized tribes of the American Khitan, such as the Iroquois and the Maskoki.^ None of these documents can .stand alone as a trustworthy record. They furnish abundant

material for negative criticism, bj' means ct" which their credibility
can be deniesl, and a position of historical agnosticism be main
tained. But for him, who, following the highest of all examples, would build rather than destroy, they provide many scattered
elements of truth, w^hich, by careful collation and comparison
among the various sources, may find the confirmation that is estaV)lished out of the mouth of two or three witnesses, and thus lay the foundation of a harmonious and continuous Hittite record. Among the western Khitan the oral and written ti'aditions
of the Caucasian peoples, Georgians, Lesghians, and Circassians,
should be collected, as likely to furnish much information, seeing
that these peoples are in close proximity to the seat of ancient
Hittite empire. The histories of Armenia, the aborigines of which
were Hittite, contain much that belongs to the aboriginal period, although it is not always easy to separate it from Indo-European
tradition.^ There are no aboriginal histories of Parthia, or of the nations of Asia Minor, and Thrace and Illyria, nor do we possess any trustwortliy Etruscan record of antiquity, although many of the Fragments of Inghirami bear internal evidence of genuineness." The monuments of Egypt and Chaldea are the oldest and best sources of information concerning the Hittite people, did we but possess the key by which to read them in chronological order. The unlearned reader of early Egyptian -and Babylonian history
is under the fond delusion that he is studying the actual statements of contemporary monuments, arranged by themselves in successive ordei-, until he changes his work of compilation for
another, when the lack of acjreement between the two narratives makes him aware of a great measure of uncertainty pervading
the w^hole scheme of ancient history. Until the great names of Lenormant and Rawlinson gave confidence to teachers, the early
history of the great monarchies of the East had virtually no place in our University courses, for its ground was felt to be too
unsubstantial beneath the feet of professor and student alike. Nor, in spite of these and other great names that might be mentioned, has the historic ground yet become solid. The reason is evident. The monuments contain fact, and are the work of
* MoHes ChoreneiiHiM. " Inghirami, Fragiiienta jirojie Scoriielluin rei'tTta.



SOURCES OF HITTITE HISTORY. 171
those contemporary with the facts they relate, l^ut these facts are in ancient languages full of equivoques and by no means easy to read. But, supposing that we have in every case the true
reading, they are still not a continuous history, but scattered tablets
in indescribable confusion. How can they be pieced together or strung in orderly succession ? When a monument of Shishak
was found, the Bible settled its place in time. When the names
of Shalmanezer, Ticrlath Pileser, and Sarg^on, came to light, the same historical document decided their epochs and succession. But of the earlier Pharaohs and Chaldean monarchs, w^th the exception of Chedorlaomer, the Bible is supposed to be silent. It rem -tins, therefore, to have recourse to other records in the form of continuous history as skeletons on which to hang the disjecta
membra of monumental lore. These records are the fraofments of Manetho's Egyptian History preserved by Eusebius and other writers, and those of Berosus' History of the Chaldeans, which have come down to us through the same authors. Manetho belonged to the third, and Berosus to the fourth century B.C. Of late years the authority of Berosus has been largely discarded, but Egyptian history to-day is Manetho illustrated by the
monuments. It will yet appear that there is a skeleton of ancient history older than those cited by fully a thousand years.
The oldest Hittite numument is that of Kapini, belonging to the ninth century B.C., but the Assyrian inscriptions furnish information concerning the Hittite people about two centuries
before.^ The inscriptions of Asia Minor, with the exception of
that of Kapini, are subsequent to the Hittite dispersion in the end of the eighth century B.C., and those of Etruria, Spain, and
Pictish Britain, appear not to be older than the third centur}' B.C. In northern India inscriptions of the fourth century bef(5re Christ have been read, and it is probable that some are in existence belonging to the time of Gautama Buddha in the sixth
century.^ Those of Siberia are all later than the Christian eraBut there is an Indian work written in Sanscrit verse by the poet Kalhana, who was alive in 1148 A.D., entitled the Raja

Tarangini, or History of the Kings of Cashmere, which is drawn almost entirely from non- Aryan or Hittite sources. In spite of the venerable antiquity of 2500 B.C., which he claims for the
beginning of his narrative, it does not appear to contain any
trustworthy information prior to the Indian settlement of the Khitan, for like Manetho, he has made up his period by arranging contemporary dynasties in successive order.^'' Coming westward, the Persian poem of Firdusi, the Shah Nameh, composed about the year 1000, and the Chronicle of Mirkhoiid, about four and a half centuries later, contain a record of so-called Persian history beginning with Kaiomars, a grandson of Noah. Thei'e are some
elements of Aryan tradition in these histories, but the greater part of them deals with a time of Hittite supremacy, when Jerusalem was regarded as a great centre. The so-called mythology and early history of the Greeks is largely of the same nature. The Latin traditions contain much that is Turanian. The German and Scandinavian mythology is non-Aryan, if indeed there be any Aryan mythology ; and the Celtic histories and
traditions, Welsh, Irish, and Scottish, contain little that is purely
Celtic. How can this be explained? Very simply; the Hittites
were the pioneers of colonization and civilization in many lands.
They were, and are to-day all over the world, inveterate story
tellers, and' these stories of theirs "were picked up by the Aryan
])eoples who settled among them, con([uered, and finally either
expatriated or assimilated them. Many writers have set forth by
numerous examples the fact that identical stories are found in lands thousands of miles apart and among peoples of different races, and have sought in vain the source from which they
emanated. That source is the hitherto unhistorical but once illus
trious race of the Khitan. It is allowable, therefore, to lay under contribution the most ancient records of all civilized nations with
whom the Hittites came int .) contact, in order to build up the
iiistory of that long-forgotten people. Still, however, with all the various sources of information at our disposal, we possess but an anarchical agglomeration of Hittite facts, which, lacking geogra

SOURCES OF HITTITE HISTORY. 173
phical and chronological definiteness, cannot be called history.
Where is the Bible, the Berosus, the Manetho, that will help us to bring order out of chaos ?
There is an ancient record, not of Hittite history alone, but of the whole ruling population of the East, made by Hittite scribes in the fifteenth century B.C., and by them laid up in the Hebrew
archives. This was found by E^ra, or whoever edited the books of Chronicles, and by him inserted in the early part of the first book. Either by him or by a subsequent hand, this historico-genea
logical record was brought into relation with the tribes of Israel.
The contents of the record, however, make it evident that there was no intention to deceive in so doing, for had there been any
such intention, many passages, whose inconsistency with an Israelite connection is apparent on the face of them, would not have been permitted to stand. The confusion of the Hebrew and Hittite lists will doubtless long remain a mystery. The lastvei-se
of the second chapter of first Chronicles sets forth incidentally
the authors of the Hittite record : " And the families of the
scribes which dwelt at Jabez, the Tirathites, tlie Shimeathites,
and Sucathites. These are the Kenites that came of Hemath, the father of the house of Rechab." Michaelis had his attention drawn to this verse by Venema's commentary on Jeremiah, but hardly ventured to connect the Hemath or Hamath of the passao-e
with the famous city on the Orontes.^^ Nevertheless the names are the same, the former denoting the progenitor of the Hamathites and the eponyni of their city. He is probably the Thamus to whom the Egyptian Thoth is said to have communicated his discovery of the art of writing, for the Arabian name of the early Hamathites is Thamur], and the Dumuzi of the Izdubar
legends seems to represent their ancestor.^'- Part of the Kenite
genealogy is found in the 17th and 18th verses of I Chron. iv., which authenticate the residence of the family in Egypt by stating that Mered, from whom Marathus on the Syrian coast opposite Hamath got its name, as well as the Mardian or Amardian tribe, married Bithiah, a daughter of Pharaoh.

found this prince Merhet's tomb among the pyi-amids of Gizeh and carried away the skull of the ancient Kenite. He was a priest of Chufu, the Cheops of the great pyramid, whose daughter
Bithiah was, and at the same time belonged to a college of sacred scribes.^^ The names Jether and Heber associated with his in the
genealogy appear among the later Kenites—Jethro, the father-inlaw of Moses, and Heber the husband of Jael.^^ It is apparent that the Kenites must have been in Egypt some time before Israel entered that country, forming part of the great Shepherd
or Hittite race. The city with which the Book of Chronicles associates the
scribes is called Jabez. There was no such city in Palestine, for its Hebrew form is Yaabets, or, as the Septuagint renders the
name in one place, Igabes, the g standing for the Hebrew letter tiijin.^^ Now the Egyptian name for Thebes, the Biblical NoAmmon, was Apet, and it became Thebes by prefixing the feminine article t or ta. This Apet is the Yaabets or Jabez of Chronicles, for the Egyptian not possessing the letter ;, replaced it by t. It is an abbreviation of the longer form Aahpeti, by which the great Shepherd king Apophis was sometimes known, and which as perfectly corresponds to the Hebrew Yaabets as it is possible for an Egyptian word to do. Thebes was a great university city famous for its scribes and learned men. Originally an Ammonite foundation, whence its name of No-Ammon, it received its later and almost universally recognized name from the iHustrious Pharaoh who was of Aminonian descent on the maternal side. It was this Aahpeti, no doubt, who removed the scribes from Memphis, in whose cemetery of Gizeh Merhet's mummy was laid, to his new capital in the south, where the
Tirathites, Shimeathites, and Sucathites continued to be masters
of inscriptions, writers of papyrian despatches, and historiographers royal. Of all men likely to be acquainted with early
history, these Kenite scribes were the chief, for in their
po.ssession would be all the archives of the greatest empire in the

world, which stood in intimate relation with all adjoinincr popula
tions, Japhetic Philistines, Semitic Arabs and Assyrians, and
Haniitic Canaanites. Thej^ necessarily possessed a perfect knowledge of at least two languages, the Egyptian and the Hittite, and probably added to these the Semitic lingua franca and the
Philistine. As their work began in or before the reign of 'Cheops, and continued down to within a hundred years or less of the Exodus, the scribes must have performed the duties of chroniclers, recording for the most part contemporary events, so
that their records are thus of the highest historical value. There
are facts briefly stated in these records which tend to show
either that they carried on their historical work after leaving
Egypt, or that they did not all leave that country until some time after the general Hittite expulsion. In Egypt, the Kenites adopted the Hebrew faith wliich the great Aahpeti received the knowledge of from his minister, Josepli.
It is to them, tlierefore, and not to any Israelitish writer, that we owe the remarkable statement that Jabez called upon the God of Israel, and the prayer that accompanies it.^^ This faith they still
possessed when dwelling in Arabia Petraea, after their expulsion
by the kings who knew not Joseph, for Jethro, the priest of Midian, was recognized by Moses as a worshipper of the true GodWhen Israel traversed the Sinaitic peninsula, a body of Kenites, under the leadership of Hobab, the son of Jethro or Raguel, and the brother-in-law of Moses, accompanied them as guides.^*^ They entered the land of promise and received an inheritance in the south of Judah, facing the Arabian land of their adoption. In that region they were pnjtected by Saul and David in later years, on account of ancient friendship, although they never appear to have amalgamated with the Israelites."^ But a northern branch of the same family dwelt, in the time of Barak and Deborah, in the plain of Zaanain in northern Palestine, its head being Heber, a descendant of Hobab.^^ There were other branches
of the Kenite family in the vicinity of Palestine, for in an Egyp

tian papyrus of the time of Raineses II., a mohar or scribe writes : "Let me go to Hamath, to Takar, to Takar-aar, the all asseiubling place of the Mohars." Here, prior to the Exodus, therefore, were Kenite scribes pursuing their vocation. They, in all probability, were the authors of the inscriptions which Rameses II. ordered to be engraved on the rocks at Adloun,
near Tyre, and at the passage of the Nahr el Kelb, near Beyrout.^*** But a fourth off-shoot of the Kenite family, at the time of Balaam's prophecy when Israel was preparing to cross the Jordan, was in sight of the covetous prophet as he stood upon Mount Peor : " And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his paro>ble and said, Strong is thy dwelling place and thou puttest thy nest in a rock. Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive."-^ These were the Thamud of the Arabian historians, who so frequently refer to
their rock dwellings that modern writers have identified them with the Horites of Mount Seir.''^^ It is not likely that either of
the last mentioned branches of the Kenite family contributed anything to the Hebrew Scriptures. There is, of course, a bare possibility that Jonadab, the son of Rechab, in the time of Jehu, or his descendants in that of Jehoiakin, the son of Josiah of
Judah, furnished the historical data, which, if proved, would
tend to diminish their value.-^ But this is rendered improbable
by the fact that the genealogies of the Hittite record proper do not extend l)eyond the time of the Exodus. We are justified, therefore, in regarding the original copy of the summary of univei-.sal history contained in First Chronicles as the gift of
Hobab, or his father Jethro, to Moses, who, being learne-l in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, would be able to appreciate it. From it, probably, the Hebrew lawgiver extracted that part of tiie .SGth chapter of Genesis which contains the genealogies of the Horites.
and the list of kings who ruled in Edom. The reasons for refusing to regard the genealogies of the

the Levites, and those which mention merely the sons of the patriarchs, as Hebrew compilations, are too numerous and require
too elaborate illustration to be given in this place; yet a few of the more obvious may be specified. There is no evidence that the Israelites ever made use of them for oenealogical purposes, nor has any commentator, Jewish or Christian, succeeded in harmonizing- them with the genealogies of the tribes of Israel given elsewhere. They contain the names of many non-Israelite and even of hostile peoples, such as Kenites, Jerahmeelites, Horites, Garmites,
Maachatliites, Manahethites, Zorites, Eshtaulites.-* The Moabite country beyond Jordan not only claims many of the persons mentioned through the correspondence of such geographical names as Ataroth, Madmannah, Charashim, but in chap, iv., verse 22, dominion in Moab is expressly assigned to some of them. Comparatively few of the names are Israelite in character, and
several, such as Shobal, Ahashtari and Zoheth, are unsemitic. Manahath, Etam,Coz, Anub, Aharhel, are purely Egyptian, answering to Month, Atum, Choos, Anubis, Archies. Kenaz, Othniel, Caleb, and Jephunneh, are Kenezzite names. The name Caleb, which
occurs so frequently, is an Israelitish impossibility, for no amount of reverence for the Kenezzite son of Jephunneh, would induce an Israelite to call his son a dog. The express statement that Jabez was more honorable than his brethren, because he called on the God of Israel, testifies to the idolatry of these brethren, even
if the expression "God of Israel," were not antithetic to Jabez,
indicating that he was not of Israel. In chap, vii., verse 22, Ephraim is represented as mourning for his descendants of the seventh generation, which no amount of longevity will justify, and which is plainly inconsistent with the fact that Israel came
out of Egypt in the fifth generation. The families of Kirjath Jearim are counted among the descendants of Judah, although it is stated in the book of Joshua that they were Gibeonites of the Amorite family."^^ Such are a few of the objections to regarding the document as a Hebrew one.

178 THE HITTITES.
of the history of those ancient times that preceded the Exodus^
they become full of light and significance, presenting, even in the baldest form, a panorama of the early ages. The names belong to the nation-forming period of history, and on this account, as well as from the celebrity of many of those who bore them, have attained a permanence in tribal and geographical nomenclature such as later names do not possess. The presentation of the
names in genealogical order, which compels the investigator to
relinquish hypothetical identifications presented in the similarity
of individual names, and to remain unsatisfied until he has found them in concatenation, takes the work of successful comparison
out of the category of mere coincidence, and by its results ^.establishes the gentile character of the genealogies. The principal races whose genealogical history is set forth in
these chapters of Chronicles, from the second to the eighth inclusive, omitting however the third and the sixth, are three, the
Horites, the Jerahmeelites, and the Hittites. The Horites were a sub-Semitic people of Canaan, allied to, and probably including, the Phfeniciaus.-'^ The Jerahmeelites were an Aryan or Japhetic
race that contributed largely to the population of Philistia.
And the Hittites were in point of numbers, at least, the greatest
nation of antiquity, and the pioneers of culture in many lands. In some cases the genealogies are continuous ; in others they have been broken up, perhaps by the original compiler, or it may be by the editor of the Books of Chronicles. The work of re-uniting the fraorments is sometimes simple enough, as when the mention of Mareshah in chap, iv., verse 21, refers the student back to chap,
ii., verse 42, where his descendants are given. The family of
Shobal the Horite also is easily traced in chap, i., verse 40, chap, ii.,
verse 50, and chap, iv., verse 2. But the Hittite line which
begins in chap, iv., verse 5, has its continuity broken by the
mention at verse 8 of the Ammonite line of Coz, for the purpose of introducing Jabez, whose mother Zobebah was of Ammonite
de.?cent, while liis here unnamed father was a Hittite. As Jabez was the ornament and glory of the Hittite tribes, this pre-eminence in the genealogy was doubtless the work of the Kenite

scribe. But in seeking the genealogical continuation of the Jerah
meelites, whose line of Onam is given in full in chap, ii., verses
25-41, we must turn to chap, vii., verse 6, to find the descendants of
the Jamin of ii. 27, who, in the seventh chapter, is falsely called Benjamin in the English vei'sion. More obscure in some respects is the Kenite genealogy, the onl}^ obvious connection between chap, ii., verse .55, and chap, iv., verses 17-19, being that presented
in the Socho of the latter to the Sucathites of the former. It thus appears that light is not always to be attained by means of
this fragmentary Kenite document, interlarded as it is occasionally
with Hebrew interpolations and additions, but that it must
sometimes find its explanations and connections in other historical
narratives. Nor can it be said that in every case it gives a
correct transcript of Hittite names, for Beth Zur, Beth Rapha,
Ben Hanan, and Ben Zoheth, are, at least in their first elements, Hebrew translations. Nevertheless it contains the most ancient, the fullest, and the most trustworthy, if at the same time the bald
est history of the Hittite people which the world is ever likely to
possess. Without this document the Hittite inscriptions would not now have been deciphered, and the history of the Hittites
would be an impossibility.
It is not proposed in the following pages to identify all the Hittite personages, more than two hundred in number, who are mentioned in the book of Chronicles and in other parts of the Bible. That task, involving a comparison of the Kenite record with the details of Egyptian and cuneiform inscriptions, with the fragments of universal history preserved by Greek and Latin and Arabian historians, with the primitive history and so-called mythology of the Greeks, Arabians, Persians, Indians, Teutons
and Celts, is too vast a one and too uninviting to the general
reader in its setting forth to call for performance here. Neverthe
less there are some Hittite names around which cluster facts so
interesting and historically important as to make it desirable to
establish them by wide induction. The statement of such induc
tion in these cases will serve to indicate the process by which the
Kenite record has been first of all discovered, and afterwards aplied for the reconstruction of Hittite history. If the Kenite document be as old as the author of this book maintains it to be, its

paramount importance is evident in the task of sifting the truth of history. It cannot indeed sit in judgment upon contemporary monuments, but it may question all inferences drawn from these, and without arrogance may call Manetho, Berosus, and all
ancient historiographers, before its bar. Let one example suffice. Manetho in his sixth dynasty gives a Methosuphis as a predecessor of the Phiops who reigned a hundred years, and was succeeded by a Menthesuphis with a reign of one year, after whom came queen Nitocris. Eratosthenes calls the king who reigned a hundred years Apappus, makes his successor a nameless monarch reigning one year like Menthesuphis, and places after him queen Nitocris.-" With the exception of Apappus or Pepi, the Aahpeti of the Egyptian inscriptions, the monuments do not know Manetho's Pharaohs. But in the end of the eighteenth dynasty Egyptologists have placed the Haremhebi of the monuments whose daughter Mutretem or Mytera married a Thothmes and united Egypt under one sceptre. ^^ Her father, Haremhebi, has left no record later than his second year. He is supposed to be the golden Horu.s. The Kenite record, which gives the names of all the Egj'^ptian monarchs down to the time of the Exodus, recognizes only one Methosuphis in Mezahab, whose name contains the Semitic zalt'ih, gold. He was the father of Matred, the Mutretem of the mcmuments and the Nitocris of the lists, and her daughter was Mehetabel, the Egyptian Mauthemva.-^ By a comparison of other documents with the Hittite, Mezahab is found to have been the son of Ziph, in Egyptian Neb. the grandson of Mesha, the Egyptian Amosis, wrongly called Aahmes, and the great grandson of Jabez or Aahpeti. He is thus the last of the Shepherd or Hycsos line, and from the day of his death began the sway of the Pharaohs who knew not Joseph. The Greek tradition preserves the name of Mezahab in the two forms Acrisius and Megapenthes, the former being a translation of the golden name. Acrisius was the son of Abas, grandson of Lynceus, and great grandson of iEgyptus, who represents Aahpeti as Jabez in

the Greek form Igabes. In the Sicyonian genealogies he is Messapus, the fifth from Apis, who came from Egypt.so In Persian legendary history his name is disguised, somewhat in the Greek form, as Kai Khosrou, the grandson of Kai Kobad, who is still ^Egyptus and Aahpeti.^^ Geographical and tribal nomenclature also unite the names of Mezahab and Jabez in the Messapian Japyges of Southern Italy. The Kenite record thus places the history of Egypt in harmony with that of the Bible by bringing the favorable Shepherd line down to within two generations of the Exodus of Israel.

CHAPTER II.
The Primitive Hittites.
In the generations of the sons of Noah given in the tenth
chapter of Genesis, we read : " And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth." These are the only personal names, those that follow being names of tribes. Of these tribes the Hivites and Amorites are to be counted to Sidon, and the Hamathites to Heth. The two Canaanitic families, therefore, which rose to
empire, are the Sidonians or Phoenicians, more generally known
in the wider extension of the race as Horites, Hivites, or Amorites ;
and the Hittites. The former, in some at least of their divisions, became thoroughly Semitized in speech ; the latter remained
typical Turanians. The initial letter of Heth is not a mere aspirate, but a guttural ; hence the Septuagint makes the word Chettai, which corresponds better to the form of the name common among the Hittites themselves and the peoples with whom
they came into contact. In the fifth generation after Noah, in the days of Peleg, the earth was divided. The empire of Shinar was overthrown, and mankind, to whom had been given a command to replenish the earth and subdue it, were foiled in their effort of concentration.
Five generations after the dispersion, Abram made his way towards the land of Canaan, and found the Canaanite and the Perizzite already in the land.^ At some point, therefore, between the periods of Peleg and Abram, the Canaanites, in the line of Sidon, miorrated westward from Shinar towards the Mediterranean, while their brethren of the line of Cush passed southward into Arabia. The Canaanites established themselves in five
distinct colonies, the chief of which was Sidon, named after their progenitor. The next was Shcchem, in central Palestine; the third, Salem or Jerusalem, over which Melchizedek ruled
;
1 Genesis xiii. 7.



THE PiUMITIVE HITTITES. 183
the fourth, Mamre; where dwelt the Amorites, Aner, Esheol, and
Mamre ; and the fifth, Mount Seir, the home of the Horites. It
is ahnost necessary to suppose that a large Semitic element accompanied the Canaanites in order to account for the radical diversity of their speech from that of the Hittites, their nearest
relatives, and for the retention by some of them, down at least to the time of Isaac, of the worship of the true God. The Semitic element, in which the Arabian historians seem to recognize a branch of Lud, became thoroughly incorporated with the Canaanites.^ A large Japhetic migration took place at or near the same time. As the Canaanites called Sidon after their father, so the Japhetic descendants of Meshech honoured his name in Damascus, one of the oldest of cities, whence came Abram's steward Eliezer. Then south of Sidon dwelt the Goim, who gave to Galilee its name, Galilee of the Goim, or Gentiles, as the word is often translated. They were known in Assyrian days as the Kue, their home then being Aegae in Cilicia, but in the far more ancient days when Thargal or Tidal was their king, they occupied Accho, Achzib and Achshaph on the Galilean coast.^ These were the ancestors of the Achaeans ; and to the south of them in Dor and Endor dwelt their brethren, the Dorians. Other
Japhetic tribes, including the families of Jerachmeel in the lines of Ram and Onam, probably occupied the coast of what afterwards became Philistia, in Abram's time. At Gaza or lone the line of Onam made a beginning of Ionian sovereignty, while farther to the north, Eker, the son of Ram, was commemorateil iii Ekron.* Still another Japhetic nation was that of the Pliilistines who dwelt in Gerar to the south-east of Gaza, and between that ancient city and Beersheba. And it is more than probable
that the five cities of the plain, notorious for their wickedness and their punishment, were Japhetic settlements. The names of the cities and their kings are not Semitic, nor do they connect with the Hittites. The Persian stor}^ of a great destruction of mankind in the time of their first king, Kaioniars, corresponds with the story of Genesis ; and the name Symobras, sometimes given

to the grandson of that monarch, agrees more nearly than anyother ancient name with Shemeber, the king of Zeboim. Kaio
mars itself is suspiciously like Gomorrah, and Balkh, the first Persian city, answers exactly to Bela or Belag, the name of which was afterwards changed to Zoar, and which alone escaped
overthrovA' owing to the intercession of Lot.^
There is no record of the Hittites crossing the Jordan and making settlements in Palestine until the time of Sarah's death, when Abraham had been more than sixty years in the land. From whence did they come ? Eplu-on, whom the aged patriarch addressed, as he stood up from before his dead, is spoken of as if he were in the third generation of Hittite sovereignty, being the son of Zohar, and the grandson of Ashchur and his wife Helah. The genealogy is given in I Chron. iv., verses 5-7 : " And Ashur, the father of Tekoa, had two wives,' Helah and Naarah. And Naarah bare him Ahuzam, and Hepher, and Temeni, and Haahashtari. These were the sons of Naarah. And the sons of Helah were Zereth, and Zohar, and Ethnan." In chap, ii., verse 24, Abiah is made the mother of Ashur of Tekoa, but her connection with the Jewish Hezron is an interpolation. Giving full value to the Hebrew letters, the names of the Hittite progenitors are Abiah, Ashchui-, Chelah, Nagara, Achuzam, Chepher, Temeni, the Achashtari, Tsereth, Tsochar, and Ethnan ; the name of their city was Tekoag. Where was Tekoa ? There was a place of that name in Judah, which accounts for the genealogy of Ashchur being connected with that of the tribe of Judah. But Ashchur certainly did not live there any more than in Tegeaof the Grecian Arcadia,
and many other places in the world named after the ancestral city. There is a fragment of Damascius which presents an indistinct reflection of primitive Hittite tradition: " The Baby
lonians constitute two principles of the universe, Tauthe and Apason, her husband. From them are derived Dache and Dachus, and again Kissare and A.ssoru.s." '^ An old geographical Babylonian list giv^es to Cutha, north of Babylon, the Assyrian Kute, the Turanian name Tig-gaba-ki." Had the Turanians who

preserved the name been pure Hittites they would doubtless have
written the word Tig-gaauki. Ptolemy calls the city Digoua. This early city, bearing the double name of Cheth and Tekoa, was the point at which Hittite empire began. An ancient tablet from Cutha presents under disguise the story of the rise of this empire : " Men with the bodies of birds of the desert, human beings
with the faces of ravens,
these the great gods created and in the earth the gods created for them a dwelling. Tamat gave unto them strength, their life the mistress of the gods raised, in the midst of the earth they grew up and became great,
and increased in number, seven kings, brothers of the same family, six thousand in number were their people. Banini their father was king, their mother,
the queen, was Milili, their eldest brother who went before them, Mimangab was his name." The second brother was called Midudu, but the names of the others are defaced.^ These seem to be the same as the seven evil spirits who are represented in another tablet as rebelling against heaven
:
" They are seven, those evil spirits, and death they fear not !
They are seven, thowse evil spirits, who rush like a hurricane,
and fall like fire-brands on the earth
!
In front of the bright moon with fiery weapons they draw
nigh, But the noble Sun and Im the warrior are withstanding
them."^ The tribes of the Arcadian Tegeatae were seven in number,
according to Pausanias, and the Mexican historical documents refer continually to the seven tribes. ^^ All that can be gathered from the vague Babylonian traditions is, that from Cutha, or Tiggaba,

186 THE HITTITES.
as a centre, the seven sons of Ashchur went abroad extending their empire, until a Semitic people allied to the Assyrians arose and expelled them for a time. While still in their home upon the banks of the Euphrates the family of Ashchur became connected in history with a flood, into the story of which many elements belonging to the Biblical account of the Noachian deluge were introduced. The hero of this deluge among the Babylonians was the Hittite Achashtari, the Sisithrus or Xisuthrus, of Berosus, and the Hasisadi'a of the
delug-e tablets. In the account of Berosus he is associated with the city Sippara, to the north of Babylon, named after his elder brother Chepher, and, in the deluge tablets, he is called a Surippakite and son of Ubara-tutu, Surippak deriving its name from the son of Chepher, namely, Chareph, the father of the house of Gader, and Ubara being a Babylonian form of Chepher.^^ The Gordyean mountains between Assyria and Armenia where the ark of Xisuthrus rested, received their name from Tsereth, the eldest son of Helah, whose name, owing to the neutral character of its initial letter, was variously rendered as Sard, Dard, Gord and Cret. Among the Welsh Britons the deluge was associated with the name of Yssadawr, but more frequently with that of Dylan, the Iiish Declan, whom Davies compares legitimately enough with the Greek Deucalion.^^ The tiood of Deucalion is placed in Thessaly, the aborigines of which were not Greeks, but Hittites adjoining Molossi or Amalekites, Epirotes of Hepher, and Athamanes of Teraeni. Thessaly and Deucalion are both forms answering to Tsochar as Hiddekel does to Tigris. The deluge again happened in the reign of Phoroneus, the son of Inachus,
who is Ephron, the son of Zohar, his Hittite relationship being evidenced by the Anak name. Another Greek diluvian hero was' Ogyges, whom St. Jerome places not in Greece but in Egypt, while Fourmont identifies him with the Amalekite Agag.^^ The universal tradition of the Greeks, as reported by Julius Africanus,
is that this flood took place in 1706 B.C. The Indian legend makes Satyavrata the hero, the Saphari fish, his informant that

a delude was coming^, and Himavat, a Sanscrit Hamath, the mountain to which he anchored his great ship.^* One of the Aztec accounts makes the flood to have been accompanied with volcanic eruptions, and states that those who survived it were changed
into Chichiraecs.^^ The latter are the Achuzamites or Zuzim of the Bible. The Peruvian deluge was a rain of fire that fell upon the Sodomites in the reign of Ayatarco Cupo, who once more represents Achashtari.^^ Some of these accounts, like Ovid's story of the Phrygian city turned into a lake by Jupiter and Mercury, for refusing them hospitality, while Philemon and Baucis, whom the two gods led to a hill to witness its destruction, were rewarded,
refer evidently to the overthrow of the cities of the plain.^' But others seem to point to some overflow of the waters of the Euphrates, that took place at an earlier period, and which, together with the enmity of surrounding Semitic peoples, led to
the dispersion of the Hittites from Cutha. With the story of this local deluge some of the traditions of the universal one of
Noah were incorporated. The superiority of Chepher, which the prominence given to his name in the forms Sippara, Saphari and Ubara seems to attest, was continued by his son Chareph or Hareph, the father of the house of Gader, or, as it is more frequently called, Gedor.
He established himself, after leaving Surippak, in Elam or Susiana to the east of the Tigris, where he brought the Semitic Elamites into subjection and established the Hittite dynasty of the Kudurs, which continued in existence till the Persian conquest. The son of Chareph was Chedorlaomer, the first element in whose name is Gedor or Kudur, while the second consists of Omer or Gomer, the name proper, and the Hittite prefix al, the powerful. The same element, al, is found in the word Leophrah, as compared with its original, Ophrah.^* The name of Omer does not appear among the genealogies, but Lagomer appears among the Elamite gods, with Sumudu, Ragiba and

other Chepherite names. ^^ The invader of the west was not Kudur Mabuk, as has been supposed, for he was the father of Ardu-sin or Jered, another father of Gedor. He was the older Kndur Nankhundi of whom Assuibanipal speaks, saying- that he oppressed Akkad 1,635 years before his time.'^*^ As Assurbanipal lived in the seventh century, B.C., his reckoning is about four hundred years in excess of the antiquity which the Bible gives to Chedorlaomer. The second element in Kudur Nankhundi's name is an Elamite corruption of the Horite name Manahath, or Manachath, witli whom Ohareph, the father of Laomer, was connected by marriage, so that his posterity were counted to Manahath. -^ The assumption by Laomer of his grandfather's name is an instance of tliat matriarch}^ or counting descent on the
mother's side, which peculiarly characterized, and still in many
places characterizes, the Hittites. A similar instance is Kudur Mabug, whose own name was Jether, but who assumed his wife's name, which was afterwards applied to Mabog in Syria, where their daughter Jerigoth was worshipped as Atargatis, being the head of the Tirathites, or Tirgathi Kenite clan. No original monument of Kudur Nankhundi has been found, but it seems very probable that he as Laomer was the Lubara of the Chaldean tablets, which connect him with Cutha and Elam, represent him as marching to the conquest of Syria, followed Ijj^ the seven warrior gods,
as being angi-y with revolting nations, and as foretelling a time of
universal strife arising apparently from a rejection of central
authority.^^ The Arabian historians have preserved the name of
the Elamite conquei'or in two different forms. The most easily recognized is Kodar el Ahmar, a man of the tribe of Thamud, who dug dwellings in the side of the rock. He killed a miraculous
camel, created at the instance of the prophet Saleh, and brought vengeance on his tribe from heaven. Thamud i.s the old Arabian name of Hamath, as Sumud and Yamut are the Elamite forms. Thamud himself was the son of Gether, the Gader or Gedor of

the 0-enealocfies, the Kudur of the monuments ; and Diar Thamud, or the land of Thamud, was called Hezer after Ezra, the son of Hamath, the ancestor of the Gezrites."^^ Lactantius preserves this old Gedor connection, making Balti, queen of Cyprus, marry Tamuz, son of Cuthar.-^ Hadher, or Jether, was a Thamudite name, and Tabari says that Morthed, the son of Schedad, had the empire after the death of Themoud, whom, however, he connects with Egypt, thus adding Mered, the Egyptian Merhet, to the list of Chepherite names.-^ The Arab name Kodar el Ahmar, both in itself and in its national connection, answers perfectly to that of Chedorlaomer, but it is strange that the killing of a camel should be his chief exploit. Abulfeda calls him Djundu ibu Omar. The second name which, from its place in history, can hardly denote any other than Chedorlaomer, is Schamar larash abou Karib, who conquered the world and left his name to Samarcand.''*^ The name Karib appended to that of Schamar relates to Chareph, his
father. In the distorted Greek traditions Chareph was Cerberus and Omer or Gomer, the Chimaera, while his son Salma became the eponym of the man-eating Solymi, and Beth Lechem, founded by him, the Lycian people. In Lycia the name of Laomer was preserved as Limyra as well as in the form Chimaera. Haniath, or Hemath, was probably another son of Chareph, for it does not appear that he descended from Laomer. From him came the Arabian name of Thamud. As son of Gether,
according to the Arab tradition, his father may have been a Gedor or Gader, and his grandfather Aram may be an Arabic
corruption of Hareph."^'^ This would place him a generation later than Chedorlaomer. He gave the name of Yamut-bal to Elam and became the Elamite god Sumudu. But, as Professor Sayce
has indicated, the Elamites were also called Apharsites, Aipir-irra, men of Khubur or Subarti, in the language of the genealogy,
Chepherites.^'^ The first Hittite tribe, therefore, to which history

ascribes empire is that of Hepher ; but the Bible calls Amalek the first of the nations, so that an Amalekite empire in Arabia Petraea must have preceded that of Chedorlaomer in Elam.-' As far as Arabian tradition sheds any light upon this primitive
Hittite empire, it consisted in the subjection by the Amalika of the Japhetic Arkam, or Jerachmeelites. Then the ancestors of proud Indian Brahmans, Greek Erechthidae, and Latin Romulidae, were under the sway of a tribe whose fortunes have dwindled away through the ages, until now, amid the Arctic snows of America, the degraded Esquimaux of the Amalig-mut arrogate to themselves the once glorious name of Amalek.^*^ Sic transit gloria, iiiundi ! These Amalekites, whose father was Temeni, the third son of Ashchur and Naarah, dwelt in the time of Abram at Enmishpat, or Kadesh, to the south of Beersheba in Arabia Petraea, and ruled over all the eastern part of that peninsula down to
Elath on the eastern gulf of the Red Sea, and eastward beyond Bozrah, which afterwards became the Edomite capital.^^ To their race belonoed Elon, the o-randfather of Esau's wife, Adah or Judith, the mother of Eliphaz, whose Amalekite name was borne
by one of Job's friends, Eliphaz the Temanite.^'" Two also of the kin^s that ruled in Edom, Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah, and Husham of the land of Temani, were Amalekites, who revived the honour of their tribe, which for a time Chedorlaomer had humbled in the dust. The Japhetic Arkam, whom they subdued,
carried away to their later seats of empire many traditions of the sea god Melicerta, son of Athamas, of Ogyges and of Telephus. But the most wonderful one in its minuteness of detail is the
story of Proteus, the old man of the sea, whom Menelaus found
at Pharos, before Egypt, counting his sea-calves. His original is Beeri, the Hittite father-in-law of Esau and ancestor of the Beerothites of Hamath Zobah. His daughter Eidothea is the Judith of Genesis, and his wife Psamathe, daughter of Nereus, is Judith's mother, Bashemath, daughter of Elon.'*^ The Bible statement of the descent of Judith is a clear case of matriarchy.

is called the daughter of Beeri and Bashemath, the daughter of Elon, the ancestry of Beeri the Hepherite being unnoticed. Her son again is named not after his maternal grandfather's, but after his grandmother's family, for Eliphaz was always a Temanite or Amalekite name. Two of the sons of Eliphaz also bore the Amalekite names Teman and Amalek, while the Hepherite line of Beeri was unrepresented by them, for Omar, the name of one of these sons, is not the same word as that borne by Chedorlaomer. Yet Beeri was a man of note, being, through his son Bedad, the grandfather of Hadad who smote the Midianites in the tield of Moab, and superseded the Amalekites in the government of south-eastern Palestine and Arabia Petraea.^*
Two only of the seven tribes of the Hittites have thus been accounted for ; the Hepherites in Elam and the Temenites, or
Amalekites, in the Sinaitic peninsula. Two other tribes had found their way to the east of Jordan in the time of Abram. The descendants of Achashtari had established themselves in Bashan in the north, Ashteroth Karnaim beinof their centre.^^
This city is presented in the Bible in a Semitic form, so that it has been generally regarded as Astarte of the two horns, or Europa, who was changed into a cow. The first part, however, is a Semitic rendering of the name Achashtari, while the second translates the Georgian akixL, Basque adarra, horn, by the Hebrew heren in the plural. The name belongs to Achashtari himself, who is the Dhu el Karnein of the Arabian historians, a conqueror contemporary with Abram, who built a great wall near Armenia to keep out Gog and Magog.^'' The two horns were his sons, Chelub and Shuah, who, like Ephraim and Manasseh from Joseph, doubled the representation of Achashtari among the Hittite
tribes. There is an allusion to this addition to the number of the Hittite tribes in Sanchoniatho. " From Sydyk came the Dioscuri, or Cabiri, or Corybantes, or Samothraces. To Sydyk, or the just, one of the Titanides bare Asclepius. These things the Cabiri, the seven sons of Sydyk, and their eighth brother Asclepius, first of all set down in memoirs as the god Taautus commanded

192 THE HITTITES.
them."^^ By Sydyk, Sanchoniatho means Achashtari, who was called Sheth and Sisit by Egyptians and Chaldeans. He is in error, therefore, in making him the father of the seven tribes, but right in calling him the father of Asclepius, or Chelub, who is thus proved younger than Shuah.^** The name Dioscuri given to the seven tribes has no connection with the Greek dios kouroi, sons of Jove, for they were no Greeks, one of the twin brethren among Greeks and Romans being Castor, or Achashtari. But it
fitly denotes all the seven, as being the name of their father Ashchur, with a prefix that seems to be Semitic rather than Hittite. To the name Pasach, belonging to the line of Chelub, the Hebrews prefixed this particle, making it Tiphsach, the Greek
Thapsacus, while the Hittites called it Khupuscia, in which they were followed by the Assyrians. In Pictish Hittite occurs Kuoskar as a form of Ashchur, and in Peruvian it is Huascar. The Basque Euskara, denoting the race to which the Basques belonged, is sometimes pronounced Heuskara. In the Caucasus the town Dioscurias has rejected the initial di of the Greeks and is now Iskurieh. The only tribes that seem to have retained the
Dioscuri an prefix are the Iroquois, one of whose sections is that of the Tuscaroi-as. Sanchoniatho also calls the Ashchurites Cabiri after the illustrious race of Chepher ; Corybantes, after his son Chareph ; and Samothracians after some later Hittite, from whom Samosata in Commagene received its name. The early history of this island of Samothracia, as told by Diodorus Siculus, is full of the names of Jasion or Achuzam, Dardanus or Zereth, Corybas or Chareph, Cybebe or Zobebah, and Plutus or Peleth
all Hittites by birtli or by marriage.^^ Moses must have anticipated when he called the people of Ashteroth Karnaim, Rei)haim, for Rapha their eponym was four generations after Achashtari, Chelub being followed by Mechir, he by Eshton, and Eshton being the father of Beth Rapha, Paseach, and Techinnah the father of Ir Nachash. The name of Chelub fades from view in the history of this triV)e, being super
seded Vi}' that of his son Mehir, whom it is likely that Chedor

laomer encountered. It is not easy to understand why the initial
m of Mehir's name was changed to n, but it was so changed ahnost invariably. The Egyptians knew the Chelubite Achashtarites in Mesopotamia as the Naharaina, which has been improperly regarded as a form of the Hebrew Aram Naharaim, or Mesopotamia. The fact that they dwelt in Mesopotamia is a mere coincidence. The Assyrians called them the Nairi. Herodotus knew their migrating descendants as the Neuri of Scythia.
When they reached Italy they became the Naharcer of the Eugubine Tables, a division of the Etruscan people. In Spain the medial breathing was converted into a labial, and the Navarrese claimed the ancient name. So also in the far east, but west of
Navarre, the Aztecs, destitute of the letter r, called themselves Nahuatl, or Nawatl, and their brethren of Nicaragua, having
retained the harsh liquid, re-established the full power of the word in their name Niquirian. From Eshton, his son, probably came the abbreviated forms attributed to Ash tar, or Achashtari, such as Sheth and Seth, Sisit and Aston. The Egyptians knew his people as the Shetin, Avhile those of Rapha were the Rubu, of Paseach, the Patasu, and of Tehinnah, the Tohen.*** One of the most famous names in this tribe was that of Ir Nahash. Not onl}^ is Nahusha celebrated in Indian story, but everywhere the word appears as Arnossus, Dirnacus, Parnassus, Lyrnessus, and in many other forms.^^ The elder brother of Chelub representing the chief horn of the Achashtarians was Shuah, the ancestor of the Shuhites, to which family belonged Bildad, the friend of Job.
His son was Shelah, the father of Er, Laadah, and other families, that dwelt at some time in Moab."*^ Er was the father of Lecah, from whom came the Lakai of southern Mesopotamia, always
united there with the Shuhites. More illustrious was Laadah, or Lagadah, an ancient Lyctius, the god Laguda of the later Elamites, but the ancestor of the Lydians, and the original Lydus. As the Salatis of the Egyptian lists, his glory was eclipsed by that of his son Mareshah, the Egyptian Moeris and Phrygian Marsvas, the head as Ma-Reshah of the Biblical Rosh. His son

was Chebron, a Pharaoh like his father, and from him came the four families of the Rosh, namely the Korach, Tappuach, Maon, and Shemag.'*^ The Maonites, or Magonites, descended from Chebron through Shammai and Rekem, and Bethzur, were their posterity. Shemag was the father of Racham, and he of Jorkoam, or Yorkogam. In Maon, the ancestor of the Lydian Maeonians
appears, and the house of Zur gives the original of their capital,
Sardis. To the south-east of Ashteroth Karnaim in Ham, which afterwards became Rabbath, the Ammonite capital, the Zuzim dwelt. This was not a Hebrew plural, but a corruption of Achuzam, the name of the eldest son of Ashchur and Naarah. The Egyptians called his descendants Gagama, and the Assyrians termed them Gamgumi, corresponding to the larger Hebrew form Zamzummim.'** Achuzam was the father of Haran, a famous name among the Arabs, although they generally count him to A.malek, as they do
most heroes of great antiquity.*^ But he was also the Ouranos of the Greeks, whom they admitted to be the son of Acmon, a 'Phrygian, or Scythian. The son of Haran was Gazez, and his, Jahdai, or Yachdai, whom we shall meet with as the leader of the Hittites in their invasion of Egypt. His sons were 9,11 famous, Ijeing at first six in number, Regem, Jotham, Gesham, Pelet, Ephah, and Shaaph. These seem to have been born in Palestine, but Jabez, his youngest son, who eclipsed them all, was a native of Egypt. To the history of that country their record chiefly
belongs. It is possible that there was an earlier Ephah between Achuzam and Haran, but this is by no means well authenticated by tradition. As the Hittite Haran was the ancestor of the
Yahdaites, or Adites, as the Arabs called them, so the Indian Varuna, who represents the Greek Ouranos, was the chief of the Adityas, who are sometimes seven, sometimes eight in number.'*^ He was also an Asura and a Kshattra. Hitzig, in his remarkaVde work on the Philistines, identifies Varuna with Marnas, a god of Gaza, somewhat unsatisfactorily.*^ However, Gazez, the name of

a brother and of the son of Haran, has no connection with the Philistine Gaza, or Azza. It is rather the original of the Hebrew
Kadesh, and especially of the city of that name, in which the Hittitea contended with the Egyptians. The word Haran begins with the guttural Hebrew cheth, so that it may be read Charan. In Greek and Sansci-it ouranos and varuna denote the heavens, but in Hittite the commoner form for sky is ser, zer, sor. How
ever, in the thoroughly Hittite Iroquois the word for heaven is karonhia. Among the non-Aryan languages of India- the usual word for heaven, sky, is sarag, but in some we find sarang, answering to the Iroquois and the Zuzimite form, of which ser,
etc., are probably abbreviations. No Hittite family is uiore famous than that of Achuzam, yet it is hard to say which of his successors was in authority when Chedorlaomer smote the dwellers in Ham.
We have so far anticipated in considering the genealogy of Shuah, the first son of Achashtari, in connection with the Rephaim of Ashteroth Karnaim. The two horns had separated thus early, and the land of the Zuzim lay between them, for the Shuhites were the Emim of Shaveh Kiriathaim, to the north of what afterwards became the land of Moab. The word Shaveh in Hebrew differs little in form from Shuah, so that the reading of vav as a labial instead of as a long vowel may be a Hebrew corruption of the word, or it may denote such phonetic decay as has taken place among the Hittites themselves, who have converted Nahar into Navarre, and Niquir into Nawal. In any case Shaveh Kiriathaim was the possession of the Shuhite Achash
tarites. They are called Emim, or Eimii, a name which the Egyptians changed to Amu, and by which they designated part of Egypt occupied by the Hycsos, and an inimical Asiatic people.^^ The name continued in use among the Assyrians in the forms Ama and Amatu, to denote a southern people connected with Saal or Shelah, Lehitau or Laadah, and Marusu or Mareshah.*^ It is evident, therefore, that the son of Shuah was Eimii, and
that his name, in certain periods and among certain peoples,
superseded that of his father, only to be eclipsed in the main line

ot" the family by the greater Lydian, Rosh, and Maeonian patronymics. The proximity of this family to the abode of Jacob in southern Palestine is evidenced by the fact that Judah married into it, his wi^e being the daughter of one who bore the ancestral name of Shuah and commemorated the great men of her race in the names of her sons Er and Shelah. The latter was born at Ohezib.^" Now, many years before Judah's time, Laadah, the father of Mareshah, and probably Er, the father of Lecah, had descended as waves in the great tide of invasion that swept over the fertile banks of the Nile. But others of their race remained behind, well satisfied with the good things of the fat land of Moab. These were " the families of the house of them that wrought fine linen (byssus) of the house of Ashbea, and Jokim, and the men of Chozeba, and Joash and Saraph, who had the dominion in Moab and Jashubi Lehem. And these are ancient things. These were the potters, and those that dwelt among plants and hedges ; there they dwelt with the king for his work."^^ As the Kenite Hepherites were the authors of literary culture among the Hittites, so the Shuhite Achashtarites were
the leaders in the useful arts. The word rendered fine linen is butz, the original of the Greek hyssos, and was probably a family name at first connected with that of Ashbea; but Chozebah, the Chezib of the story of Judah, must have been intimately connected with the cultivation of the cotton that supplied the weavers
of Ashbea with their material, for that Hittite name is the source of the Latin gossipiurti, denoting cotton and the cotton plant, as
it does in the botanical language of to-day. Commentators on Pliny are agreed that gossipium is no Latin word, but the barbarous name of the plant. De Goguet in his Origin of Ancient Nations, and Bryant, in his ponderous Analysis of Ancient Mythology, cite many authorities as to the invention of spinning and weaving. Most of the names of persons and places mentioned by them and by Pliny in this connection relate to the Shuhite family, Arachnc for instance denoting Rekem, a son of Hebron. Even that ancient language, the Hebrew, seems to have borrowed its verb rakam, to embroider, from this artistic family ; and the

Gaelic hreacaim with the same signification, doubtless had a similar origin. Althouoh it is more than doubtful that so useful an art as weaving was a Lydian invention, as the Lydians claimed
it to be, it is nevertheless true that the art was most extensively practised in ancient times by the posterity of that Shuah from whom the Lydians descended in the line of Laadah. But a volume would not suffice for the history of the Shuhite craftsmen These were all the Ashchurites whom Chedorlaomer encountered beyond Jordan and in Arabia Petraea. The three sons of Helah had not yet made their way to the west. But with the King of Elam three other kings were confederate, Amraphel, Kins: of Shinar or Shinoar ; Arioch, Kino- of Ellasar, and Tidal,
Tidgal, or Thargal, King of Goim. The latter was of Japhetic
descent, his people, as has already been indicated, being the ancestors of the Cilician Kue of Aegae, and the Achaeans of Greece. Thargal, the Septuagint form of this monarch's name, is probably the correct one, answering to the Greek name Thargelia, and to Thargelion, that of one of the Attic months. It may have had the signification of the kindred Greek word
tharsaleos, the bold. The ethnic relations of Amraphel of Shinar are not easy to determine. His name has been read as emer aphel, the commandment which went forth, in Hebrew, but such an explanation carries its refutation on its face. The name of
his city has all its connections with the Hittites, who in Mesopotamia had a King Sangara, and a river Sangura, answering to the Sangarius of Asia Minor. In India also they had many kings called Sankara.^- Nothing could be more natural than the
alliance of Chedorlaomer with his half brothers, the sons of Helah. If Amraphel was of them. he can only have belonged to the family of Zohar or Tsochar. Epliron, called his son, cannot have been such save in the sense of a descendant, for Chedorlaomer was in the second generation from Hepher, and Ephron did not appear until about sixty years after his invasion. This Ephron also possessed the cave of Machpelah, in which the ^^ei
5- It has already been indicated that the name Sagara, or Sangara, is not Hittite, but Indo European, and there is no evidence that at this early date tlie Hittites, or any portion of them, were under Japhetic rule. Tsochar, however, might easily become a Singar.



198 THE HITTITES.
or ^Aei of Amraphel reappears. There were similar names among the Hittites, for Homer speaks of Eurypylus, the son of Telephus, who led the Ceteans, and elsewhere the name is connected with Thessaly, which, like the Indian Taxila, represents the Tsocharites as a people who interchanged the letters I and rTsochar himself was the Teucer of the Greeks, and in his line, conformably with Greek tradition, appear Ephron or Apollon, Jephnnneli or Paeon, Pan, Evander, and Caleb or vEsculapius. The sons of Caleb were Iru or Giru, Elah the father of Uknaz, and Naam or Nagam, the father of Keilah or Kegilah, the Garmite, and Eshtemoa or Eshtemoag, the Maachathite. The most illustrious of these is Naam, the namer of Capurnaum, of whom the Greeks made the physician Machaon, and from whom descended the Nasamones and Garamantes. Eshtemoa is the Astamu or Astamaku of the Assyrian monuments, always con
nected with Hittite peoples. Renan identifies the Tenkelusha of the Book of Nabataean agriculture with Teucros.^^ It may be that Shingar was a corruption of Tsochar by the same process, but it remains to be proved. It certainly reduces one's opinion of the heathen gods to find Abraham purchasing a sepulchre from
Apollo. Yet there is nothing in Hittite history more clear than that Ephron was the Apollon of the Greeks and the eponym of Apolloniatis at the foot of the Zagros mountains which separated Assyria from Media, and near which the Garamaei or Garmites dwelt. To this Hittite family it is possible that Amraphel belonged, but the complete proof is wanting. A branch of the family established itself in Africa round about Cyrene, for there in classical days were Teuchira, Apollonia, Hippon, the Nasamones, Augila, the Garamantes and. the Macatutae. Adjoining this country was Marmarica. Apollo Marmarinus was worshipped in the island of Euboea, his name being derived from the Greek mannaros, stone, marble. The Aryan connections of marmaros, Latin inarmor, English marble, are non-existent. The word is Turanian and Hittite, and occurs continually in Etruscan inscriptions, in wliich maranokoya means a chamber of stone, and luranokoya, an earthen chamber or tumulus. In modern Basque Tnalkar is a stony place, and Triurru and harmora denote a stone

wall. From stone it was transferred to iron in many Khitan
languages, as in the Basque hiirni, so that its root may be the same as that of the Semitic barzil, iron. Taking this word as the amra of Amraphel's name, the last syllable is probably an
old Hittite word for coat, dress, the root of which appears in the Lesghian paltar, the Mizjejian hartshag and the Natchez paeele, and with disguise in the Basque chamar, zamarra, all denoting a vestment. The Utes of Colorado, remote descendants of the Hittite Yahdai, whose congeners, the Shoshonese, retain the
Zuzim name, have a story of Sikor, the crane, an ancient hero, who was killed by Tumpwinairogwinump, which being translated, means " he who had a stone shirt." The man of the stone
shirt carried oif the wife of Sikor, but left her son behind. This son, being cut in two by his grandmother, became Sokus Waiunats, the two-one boy, and these two, learning their father's fate and their mother's imprisonment, travelled among the nations, carrying with them a magic cup, and inciting them to attack the tyrant. Under the leadership of Sokus Waiunats, aided by Shinauav, the wolf, and Togoav, the rattlesnake, the nations marched against the slayer of Sikor. When they arrived at his castle the two-one boys transformed themselves into mice, and, entering Stone Shirt's abode, gnawed the bowstrings and other weapons of a magical nature belonging to his invincible daughters, the consequence being the overthrow of the tyrant and the deliver
ance of his prisoner.^* Students of mythology and folk lore will doubtless find many stories of the man in armour resembling
this, but it is more interesting to know that the Assyrian god
Ninib was called nin hattin barzil, the lord of the iron coat.^^ Ninib's Turanian name was Bar, and his wife was the Queen of Nipur and Parzilla. In the Migration Legend of the Creek Indians the following passage occurs : " At that time there was
a bird of large size, blue in colour, with a long tail, and swifter than an eagle, which came every day and killed and ate their people. They made an image in the shape of a woman and placed it in the way of this bird. The bird carried it off and

kept it a long time, and then brought it back. They left it alone, hoping it would bring something forth. After a long time a red rat came forth from it, and they believe the bird was the father of the rat. They took counsel with the rat how to destroy its father. Now the bird had a bow and arrows, and the rat ofnawed the bowstring, so that the bird could not defend itself,
and the people killed it. They called this bird the King of Birds. They think the eagle is also a great king." ^*' There is a mixing
of the elements in the two stories, for the great blue bird is
plainly Sikor, the crane, who is put in the place of the man with
the stone shirt. Strabo tells the story differently. " The Teucri who came from Crete were told by the oracle to establish themselves in the place where the Autochthones attacked them, which happened near Hamaxitus, for at night great swarms of mice came and consumed all that was made of leather in their weapons and equipment ; therefore the colony established itself in that place." ^"^ At Hamaxitus, Chrysa, and Larissa, in Rhodes, and in Tenedos, Apollo Smintheus, or Apollo of the rat, was worshipped in commemoration of this event. Near at hand, the Teucrian cities of Cebrene and Neandria preserved the Zoharite names Ephron and Naam. More discordant is the account of Herodotus, who represents Sethos, a priest king of Egypt, going forth with a hastily collected army to meet Sennacherib the Assyrian. At Pelusium the armies faced each other, and through
the nio-ht the held mice came in multitudes, devouring the bow
strings, the quivers, and the thongs that fastened the shields of
the Assyrians, so that the Egyptians gained a great victoryHerodotus says that in his time there was in the temple of Vulcan at Memphis, a stone statue of Sethos with a mouse in his hand, and an inscription telling the beholder to learn by looking at him to reverence the gods.''^ The father of history has confounded an old tradition carried into Egypt by the invading Hittites with the Jewish story of the miraculous overthrow of the hosts of Sennacherib. Another version of the Creek legend agrees in part with the Egyptian. The four tribes, Kasichta,

Kawita, Chicasa, and Abika, in their wanderings, crossed the falls of Tallapossa above Tukabachtchi, and visited the Chatahuchti river. " They found a race of people with flat heads in possession of the mounds in the Kasichta fields. These people used bows and
arrows, with strings made of sinews. The aliJdchalgi, or great physic makers, sent some rats in the night time, which gnawed the strings, and in the morning they attacked and defeated the flat
heads." 5» All of these passages relate to primitive Hittite history, and to a time when the Hittites were at war among themselves. The presence of the Teucri and their Sminthian god at Hamaxitus, as recorded by Strabo, is evidence of an ancient alliance of the Tsocharites and the Chepherites of whom Hamath came. Sikor, Shingai-, and even the Sanacharib of Herodotus seem to be corruptions of Tsochar, and the flatheads of the Creek tradition may connect in the Basque word zahal-buru, a flathead. The general
consensus of the traditions is that the Teucri, or Tsocharites, were
the sufferers by the action of the Sminthoi, mice or rats, the Aztec qidmichin, and Japanese oiedzitmi, which latter seems to be an inversion of an original dzwai-ne. Thus Amraphel, Ninkattin-barzil, and the Stone Shirt of the Utes, are identified with
the line of Tsochar in oppo.sition to other Hittite tribes. The Sokus Waiunats, or two-one boy, probably represents the double empire of the family of Achashtari, which Sethos the Egyptian, as Sheth, also sets forth. It seems likely that the rats or mice were the Shuhites, or Shuchites, for the Basque sagu, Circassian clsugoh, Georgian tagwi, Mizjejian dachka, Yeniseian djuta, and Corean dsui, present the common Khitan word for mouse. The Assyrians called the Shuchites the Tsukhi and Tsuhi. Returning, however, to Amraphel, while we cannot identify him with Nurvul, an ancient Chaldean king of Larsa, we at least find in the name of that monarch one similar to that of the king of Shinar. In later days the longer and less common word for stone and metals, mara, was replaced by the more general arri. The Greeks represented the Hittite name by Eurypylus. One of this name led the Trojan Ceteans ; another, from Ormenium in Thessaly, was an opponent of the Trojans ; and a third, also from Thessaly, sailed to

Libya and became king of Cyrene, where Teucra and a host of other geographical names commemorated the line of Tsochar. Herophile, the Trojan Sibyl, was the guardian of the temple of Apollo, and was buried in the grove of Smintheus. Herophilus,
the physician, was of the family of the Asclepiades. The Paeones, who, in legendary Greek history, in the person of Paeon, their progenitor, unite ^Esculapius and Apollo, dwelt about Mount Orbelus, in the north of Macedonia. They were a relict of the Teucri. In the prophecy of Hosea, Aven and Beth Arbel seem to be connected, the latter being referred to as a city spoiled by Shalmanezer.^** The only city whose name corresponds to Arbel and whose fate justifies the language of the prophet, that the inscriptions of Shalmanezer record, is Aramale in Vannic Armenia. 'To the city of Aramale I approached. Its cities I threw down, dug up, and burned with fire." ^^ The prophet seems to say to Israel, you worship the gods of Aven ; see how Shalman has spoiled their city of Arbel ; how much more, therefore, may he prevail against you ? Among the Huns who left China and returned to their ancient home in the west, in the second Christian century were the Orpelians, who settled in Georgia.*"^ In the line of Tsochar, the name of Jephunneh, the son of Ephron, superseded all others, so that Aven, Van, Paeon, and Hun, furnish the most natural connection for forms of Amraphel's name in history and geography. The site of Shinar, where he ruled, is not determined, as that name is applied by sacred and profane writers to three regions ; to the part of Babylonia proper that lay between the narrowing course of the Tigris and Euphrates, to the southern region of Mesopotamia, immediately to. the north of it, and to the district of Singara and Zagora, in central Mesopotamia. The third confederate king was Arioch, kinof of Ellasar. His kingdom has been supposed by almost all commentators from
early days to be that called, in later books of the Bible, Telassar.
But this is not of much assistance, for the children of Eden are said to have dwelt there, and their home apparently was in north
western Syria. ^^ In an inscription of Esarhaddon the city or

region is mentioned : " Crusher of the people of Barnaki, enemies and heretics, who dwell in Telassar, which in the language of
the people, Mikhran Pitan, its name is called." ^* But this is still more perplexing, as it seems to carry us to north-western Cappadocia, where Parnassus represents Barnaki, and Saralium Telassar.
A famous Hittite of the line of Zereth was Asareel. His ancestor, Zereth named Zarthan, and Zereth Shachar, and Cherith, with many other places in Israel and Moab. From Zereth descended Shachar, and he was the father of Jehaleleel. The prophet Isaiah has preserved a poetic fragment relating to Jehaleleel, which he applies to Babylon. In the English version it reads : " How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning ! How art thou cut down to the ground,which didst weaken the nations !"^^
The true readins^ of " Lucifer, son of the mornino- " is " Helel, son of Shachar," thus presenting in an abbreviated form the name of the grandson of Zereth. Zereth in the forms Zarthan and Kartan, appears as the eponym of the Dardanians and Sardinians, and in the form Cherith, of the Cherethites, Cretans, and Kurds. The Paschal Chronicle asserts the descent of the Dardanians from Heth. His descendant, Jehaleleel, is the Dardanian Ilus and
eponym of Ilium, and the sons of that famous hero, Ziph, Tiria,
and Asareel, are the Dardanian Capys, Tros, and Assaracus. His daughter Ziphah married into the family of Amnion, and, if the
Egyptian tradition be correct, was the wife of Coz, the son of Amnion, and as Nephthys, the mother of Anub, or Anubis. As Anub begins with the Hebrew letter ayin, it may be rendered Ganub. This the mythologists changed to Ganymede, another Dardanian, who was carried away to replace Hebe, his sister Zobebah, as cup-bearer of the gods.^** The Egyptians very frequently changed a Semitic, or Turanian z into n ; thus the Hebrew zahah, gold, in Egyptian became nub, and zej^heth, pitch, became Tiapldha. Nephthys, therefore, is the true Coptic equivalent for Ziphah. In Greek, as well as in other mythologies, the gods represent the ruling powers, and generally the Pharaonic families of Egypt. The taking away of Ganub, or Ganj-iiiede, simply

means that his family was not counted to the Dardanians, but to that of his grandfather Amnion. Nevertheless, he followed the fortunes of the Hittites.
The name of Ziph, after whom the Assyrian rivers, the Zabs, were called, appears in an ancient cuneiform list of Babylonian kings, and he is referred to by the Babylonian Nabonidus as a very ancient monarch.^^ The father and predecessor of this Zabu is, in the list, called Sumulailu. The Lailu is right, but the preceding sumii must surely be a misreading. In Moab, where Zereth-Shachar was the memorial of his forefathers, the name of
.Tehaleleel was preserved in-Elealeh, but also in the river Nahaliel. In Asia Minor the river Halys commemorated him, but, when his descendants dwelt in Egypt, they gave to the great river of that country the Nahaliel form of his name and called it the Nile. He is the Ilus of Sanchoniatho's Phoenician history, which, however, is silent concerning his downfall. But the Basques have a record
of it in the beginning of their oldest extant literary production, the Song of Lelo :
' Lelo ! il Lelo Lelo, dead Lelo, Lelo ! il Lelo Lelo, dead Lelo, Leloa ! Zarac O Lelo, Zarac IlLeloa." Kills Lelo.
M. Francisque Michel, in his Pays Basque, says : " There was, according to Basque tradition, a very brave and much beloved
chief called Lelo. This chief being obliged to make a warlike expedition into a strange country, a certain Zara profited b}' his absence in seducing his wife, Tota. Lelo, having ended his expedition and returned to his home, the two lovers plotted together to kill him, and did kill him. The crime was discovered and created an uproar. It was decided in the assembly of the people that the two guilty ones should be forever banished from the country. As for Lelo, it was commanded that, in order to honour his memory and perpetuate regret for his death, all national songs should begin with a couplet of lamentation for him." "'* Hence the everlasting Lelo has passed into a proverb. M. Michel fitly com
pares the song of Lelo with the Linus, or Ailinus, of the Greeks,

which Herodotus was much astonished to hear sung in Egypt. " Where," he asks, " could the Egj'ptians have got the Linus from?"^^ It is every where to be found among the Khitan. Even among' the Senel of California the mourners sing over and over
again :
" Hel lei li ly Hel lei lo Hel lei lu,"
their version of the everlasting Lelo.'° Apollonius Rhodius tells the story of Hylas, who, in the course of the Argonautic voyage, went to look for a spring of water and was carried off by the nymph Hydatie, although others thought he had been killed by a ther, or wild beast. '^ Hydatie resembles the Tota of the Basque legend. Hesiod makes Tethys the mother of the Nile and many rivers, thus confirming the connection of the two names.^^ Yet the historical material for clearing up the mj^stery of the fall of
Helel, the son of Shachar, is wanting. It may refer to the fall of t\\Q Ilian dynasty, wherever that was, rather than to the death of its founder. The Greeks have preserved Jehaleleel's name in many different forms, as Ilus, ^olus, Aloeus, and Eleusis ; that of his
ancestor in Cretheus, Sardus, and Dardanus ; and that of his eldest son in Sisyphus. The only Greek legend that sheds light upon the fate of the son of Shachar is the obscure one of Zagreus, who was killed out of jealousy by the Titans, and from whose heart came Bacchus. ^^ Here Zagreus is Shachar, and the heart is his daughter Ziphah. Cicero makes Nilus the father of this Bacchus.^"*
The fall of Jehaleleel may be set forth in the still more obscure
Chaldean tablets relating the sin of the Zu bird, for in them the god Elu is mentioned, as is Sarturda, in the land of Sabu, while
Zu, on account of his sin, is banished from the society of the gods."^ The most important tradition of this memorable event is that which Diodorus received from a tribe of North African Hittites,

whom he calls Atlantes. They stated that their first king was Uranus, the Hittite Haran. In his line came Helius, who was drowned in the Eridanus by his uncles, the Titans, and whose name was given to the sunJ^ The name Eridanus is quite consistent with the trp.dition, for Ardon, the namer of the Jordan and the two rivers Jardanus in Crete and Elis, was of the posterity of Zereth. This Helius is Helel, or Lucifer, and his name actually denotes the sun among many Khitan families. Thus the Basques have a form iluzki ; the Yukahirian word is yelonsha, the Koriak kulleatsh, shahalch, the Kamtchatdale kuleatsh, the Iroquois, kelanquau, the Pueblos hoolenwah. As a rule, however, the Khitan use the same word to denote both sun and moon, so that the Basque illargi, Yuma hullya, hvMyar, and Peruvian quilla, the moon, belong to the same category. Thus Jehaleleel, or Helel,
is simply Lucifer, the light bringer, whether by day or by night. The Greek Jielios and Latin sol are loan words from the Hittite The youngest son of Jehaleleel was Asareel, the Assaracus of the Greeks. Now, immediately after Zabu, George Smith, in his Early History of Babylonia, places Urukh, who at Zirgulla built a
temple to Sar-ili, the king of the gods. This Sarili is the Hittite
Asare-el, and while Zirgulla and Zarilab, in Chaldea, were his
memorials. Bit Hiliani, an ancient Ilion, was that of his father
Jehaleleel. The Hebrew record inverts the parts of the name
Assare-el and calls it El-assar, for el, the Basque al, power, was, in
ancient Hittite days, the adjective, powerful, mighty, so that the
name might be read indifferently Assar-el, Assar, the mighty, or El-assar, the powerful Assar. When the name was removed into the north, and especially after it was appropriated by non-Zere
thite tribes, such as the Eden and the Barnaki, Semitic writers,
able to make nothing of the initial el, changed it into tel, as TelAssar, the mound of Assar. The son of Asareel was the Babylonian Urukh, the Dardanian Erichthonius of the Greeks. But an older Erichthonius, or Urukh, whom the Greeks make the brother of Ilus, must be the Arioch king of Ellasar, who was confederate with Chedorlaomer. It is exceedingly probable that
branches of the families of Zereth and Zohar settled among the Semitic descendants of Asshur and Arphaxad, acquired their

THE PRIMITIVE HITTITES. 207
language and became the rulers of the Assyrian nation, which is now represented by the Kurds, undoubted descendants of Zereth. The Assyrian eponym was, therefore, the mighty Assar, father of Arioch, rather than the more ancient Asshur, son of Shem."" The whole Assyrian area is thickly planted with Hittite names pertaining tp the two families of Zereth and Zohar, including Arbela
in the centre of the country, which has been found to commemorate Amraphel. In the persons of Asareel and his son Arioch, we may see the beginnings of Assyrian mgnarchy. The posterity of this second Arioch is given in the genealogy, but so vaguely in the Hebrew version that it is difficult to connect him with it.
They are credited to the ubiquitous and impossible son of Hezron, who it is said " begat Azubah (or Gazubah), a woman, and Jerioth (or Yerigoth) ; and these are her sons, Jesher and Shobab and Ardon."^^ The evidence of tradition is that Yerigoth was a daughter of the Hamathite Jether, known in the Elamite records as Kudur Mabug, being the Atargatis who was worshipped at Mabog and Ashteroth Karnaim, and, at the same time, the head
of a line of Tirathite, or Tiro-athite, scribes.'^ As Derceto, she is made the mother of Semiramis. She is also as Orithyia made the daughter of Erechtheus, and, as Eurynome, the wife of the oriental Orchamus. The only queen that appears in early Chaldean history is Azagbau, called in Assyrian Bauellit, who in the
lists follows Saro'on of A^ade.^*^ Now^ this Azag-bau must be Azubah, who is accordingly later than Urukh, or Arioch. She was undoubtedly the wife of Sargon, who is the Orchamus of Ovid, and her importance is indicated by the retention of her name to desio-nate Sazabe, the stronghold of the men of Carchemish. She must, therefore, have been the daughter of Arioch and probably of Yerigoth, who would thus be his wife. This genealogy explodes the Aryan myth borrowed from the Persian Scriptures. The true Iraj, head of the Arians of Ariana, was Arioch, whose son Ardon is the Persian Feridun, wrongly made the father of Iraj. In Ariana the large region of Arachotia commemorated
^^ Another competitor for this honour is Asher, the son of Ziph, or Zabu, whose line is given in 1 Chron, vii, 30. "8 1 Chron. ii. 18. '* There is no other claimant for the name Tirgathi, or Tirathite, in 1 Chron. ii. 55. S" Proc. Soc. Bib. Archaeol., January 11, 1881, 37.

Yerigoth, or a son called after her, in which case Jesher, Shobab and Ardon would be Arioch's grandsons ; and the Casirotae were
the descendants of Jesher, the Biblical Geshur, from whom also Gujerat in India, and the Jaxartes, received their names. The supposition that this family contributed largely to the population of Assyria and obtained empire there, is in accordance with the
views of Lenorraant, who identified the Assyrians with the Rotennu of Egyptian days.^^ These Rotennu were the people of Ardon. Assurnazirpal speaks of the river Radanu, near his birthplace, and not far from the lower Zab.^r Zereth's family was one of river namers, and among the most prominent in it in this respect was Ardon, whom the Palestinian Jordan and Assyrian Radanu, the Jardani of Crete and Elis, the Italian Eridanus, and Gallic
Rhodanus, alike held in honour. His elder brother Jesher, or Geshur, seems to have been the ancestor of Arba, or Arbag, the namer of Arrapachitis, who had a son Auak, and three famous o-randsons. Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.®^ Twelve years the Hittite tribes beyond Jordan had owned the sovereignty of Chedorlaomer, the Hepherite of Elam, and had doubtless aided him in subjecting the Japhetic pentapolis of the Jordan and the neighbouring Horites to his sway. But in the
thirteenth year they rebelled, as Hittites with a strong love of personal freedom have ever been prone to do. History may
yet enlighten us as to the provocation of this rebellion. For a
year the Elamite king was engaged collecting his forces, and then, with the mailed Amraphel, the Tsocharite lord of Shingar, with Ariocli I, the Dardanian or Zerethite king of El-Assar, and
with the Japhetic Thargal, who either from Galilee of the Goim or some more eastern seat of that Achaean stock, joined the con
federates, he proceeded to punish his rebellious brethren of the house of Naarah. Following the well-known route from Dama.scus, he fell first upon the younger branch of the Achashtarites in Ashteroth Karnaim. Then, moving to the south-east, the Zuzims felt his power, and the elder brother, already sufliciently
Innnbled as the tributary of the 3'ounger, was still further

disgraced. Next, in the north of Moab, the elder branch of the
Achashtarites, known as the Emim or Shuchites, met with overthrow at Shaveh Kiriathaim. Farther south, a foreign race, the remnant of the Horites, whose brethren were in Zoan and Mendes, sovereigns in the land of Egypt, were smitten by the ever victorious Chaldeans. One Hittite tribe remained, Amalek, the first of the nations, vainly endeavouring to regain supremacy. Its Agag of the time, some Elon or Eliphaz, they overr'ame and ravaged all his land. Then sweeping northward, fearful of the Philistine standing army under its general, Phichol, that was waiting a favourable opportunity to carve out a Japhetic home in the Nile valley, and would doubtless have enjoyed a brush with the Hittites,-* the men of the east moved rapidly between them and the scene of theii- Horite conquest, and dispersed the Horite or Amorite settlement at Hazezon Tamar which faced the wealthy cities of the plain. Pride and fulness of bread were of no avail,
for thus early in the world's history luxury had enei'vated those who might have ruled it as kings of men. The five kings fell in
the slime pits, and, with the booty of many peoples, Chedorlaomer and his host hastened home. The sequel is a well-known story, though unrecorded save in the Hebrew record. That valiant Semite, Abram, whose three hundred and eighteen fightincr men show him to have been a king, as kings went in these days, over about two thousand people, with perhaps an equal band under Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, the Horites of Hebron, pur.sued the spoilers and overtook them. By night the rescuers and avengers fell upon the Hittite host, little dreaming that an enemy was near, and smote them. They left their ill-gotten spoil in haste and fled, but not until they reached Hobah on the left of Damascus did the Hebrews and Amorites cease pursuing. This was the thunderbolt that on the morning of the fourth day, according to Arabian tradition, fell on Codar el Ahmer and his Thamudites, and, if the Ute tradition, preserved for nigh four
thousand years, is to be trusted, its stone shirt man, the ironcoated Amraphel, must have succumbed to the same stroke. Such is the primitive history of the Hittite race, embracing the

rise of their empire at Cutha or Tiggaba near Babylon, the fall of Jehaleleel, the dispersion of the j'outhful tribes westward to the borders of Palestine and southward to Chaldea and Elam, the revival of sovereignty under Chedorlaomer, the rebellion and overthrow of the western Hittites, and the dispersion of the conquering confederates by the army of Abram.

CHAPTER III.
The Hittites in Palestine.
Great changes took place in the fifty years following Abram's victory. Himself was no more Abram, but Abraham, the father of a multitude. His sons Ishmael and Isaac were men. The cities of the plain lay beneath the waters of the Dead Sea, and Lot, having escaped from the great destruction, had sent his two sons to push their fortunes among the Horite Pharaohs of Egypt, from whose race, it may be, had come their unhappy grandmother, who perished by the way. Abrahaih had taken up his abode in the south near the friendly Philistines of Gerar, whose king may have been the Gilshah of the oriental historians, who was also called Ubul Muluk ; but Sarah remained in Hebron. During these fifty years the Hittites had pushed their way westward, reconciliation having taken place between the Euphratean
and Jordanic divisions ; and part of the tribe that had followed Amraphel in the western foray of Chedorlaomer now occupied the Amorite city of Mamre. Their chief or king was Ephron or Gephron, a descendant of Zohar. He is well identified with the Greek Apollon, not as the son of Zeus and Latona, for that genealogy gives Horus, the Apollo of the Egyptians, but by his race and his descendants. Apollon was the tutelary god of the Teucri or Tsocharites. Among the Tochari of Strabo, Aparni was the name of a tribe called after him, but generally the r is changed to I as in the confines of Mysia and Bithynia, where the connected Dascylium, Apollonia, and Aphneia, represent Tsochar, Ephron and Jephunneh. So Apollon, in what is called mythology, is tlie father of Paeon, and he, of iEsculapius. From ^sculapius comes Machaon or Nicomachus, who is associated with Isthmius, Acacallis, and Garamas, and whose name is reproduced in the son of the latter, Nasamon Caphareus ; thus connecting Caleb son of a Jephunneh, with Naham and Capharnaham, Eshtemoa, Keilah or



212 THE HITTITES.
Kagilah, and the Garmites, of whom he was the father. Comparative geography tells the same story. In Asia Minor, Dascylium, Apollonia, and Aphneia have appeared ; alongside of them were Zeleia and Germe. In southern Assyria in classical times were the Zagros mountains, Apollonia and the Garamaei. In the time of Sennacherib the Tocharri dwelt in the Nipur mountains in six tribes, Kalbuda or Caleb, Sharum or Garmi, Ezama or Eshtemoa, Kana or Uknaz, and Kipsu and Kua undetermined.^ Already the Cyrenian connection has been shown in Teucra, Apollonia, Hippon, Nasamon, Augila, Garamas, and the Macatutse. To repeat such identifications w'ould be tiresome alike for the writer
and his readers, but this example may indicate how, by
actual tribal and city names, the historical character of mythologies may be attested, and the information they afford be
scientifically applied to the connection of the Kenite record. Abraham stood up from before his dead and spoke to the sons of Heth, asking their good offices with Ephron the lord of the laud, that he might sell him the cave of Machpelah. This Ephron or Apollon had, according to Greek tradition, taken service as a herdsman with the Thessalian Admetus. In common speech he
had accepted the thrall of Thamud, the tribe to which Chedorlaomer belonged, but now apparently he was free. He was a courteous Hittite and spoke royally to the bereaved patriarch. Some writer has thrown discredit upon Ephron's generosity, comparing his language with that of the Arabs at the present day. But Ephron was no Arab. He belonged to a race possessed of many faults, but lying and begging are not among them. How little that strangely assorted couple thought of what the world yet would witness ; the name of the greater suppliant confined for almost two thousand years to the little land in which he dwelt, and that of the other spread abroad throughout the world as the name of a god. To think of nations, mighty in numbers, in prowess and in intellect, theGreek and Roman masters of the world, taking up a distorted tradition of Hittite ancestor worshippers, and weaving into a divine creation the story of a name they did not understand and of which their language furnished no etymology ; of Hittite Hyperboreans in the far north sending their

tribute now and again to the distant Delphic shrine ; and of Iberian tribes in remote Aquileia and the Gallic country of the Arverni erecting statues to him as the god Belenus ; nay more, of Semitized Hittites, who, passing over the broad Pacific from the Malay archipelago to the New World, still kept their ancient faith, and, adoring the ancestral Zohar as Tohil, gave him to Guatimala as the god Balam : this surely is one of the strangest thoughts that the mind could conceive, yet it is but the first of many. There is an Indian story given in many forms and under manifold name disguises, from which looms out the fact that Hebrew traditions had found their way into India through the Tukharas and Yavanas, who contributed so largely to its nonAryan population. It is the story of the intended immolation of a son by his father and of the miraculous deliverance of that
son from death by the intervention of the gods. Professor Max Mtiller regards the story as too revolting to belong to Aryan
tradition and refers it to a Turanian people. The victim is always called Sunahsepa, but his father is called Ajigartta and Richika.
The father in one case consents to sell his son and sacrifice him for the benefit of Ambarisha, the father of Yuvanasva, and in the other for Rohita, the son of Harischandra. In both cases the priest king Visvamitra, a man of great piety, descended from the Bharatas and the ancestor of the Kusikas, is the deliverer of the victim, and adopts Sunahsepa, calling him Devarata or the godgiven. Elsewhere he is called the priest of Sudas, the son of Pijavana. The two names, Yuvanasva and Pijavana, connected with this legend, are indicative of its source, for both relate to tlie Yavanas, who came of Jephunneh, the son of Ephron. The migration of Visvamitra, who took his property and crossed the rivers, is frequently referred to in the Indian scriptures. Some remarkable names, such as Kachapa and Rupin, appear among the Kusika descendants of Visvamitra, who seems to set forth,
under a disguise that it may be hard to penetrate, the patriarch Abraham. In the Aitareya Brahmana, Sunahsepa is represented
as saying to his father, " They have seen thee with the sacrificial
knife in thy hand—a thing which men have not found even among the Sudras." And Visvamitra says, " Terrible was the



214 THK HITTITES.
son of Suyavasa as he stood, about to immolate thee with the knife ; continue not to be his son ; become mine." It is natural to think that Sunahsepa is a form of the name of Joseph, whose greater fame would eclipse the memory of his grandfather Isaac. The names of Ishmaelites, Midianites, and Edomites are bound up with the Indian tradition, but as some of these have been trans
lated into Hittite, and then from Hittite into Sanscrit, it is not
easy to trace them back to their originals.'
Long before the trial of Abraham's faith, the patriarch had received a divine intimation that his descendants in the line of promise should possess all the land from the Arish, or river of E^jypt, to the Euphrates, including in addition to that of the Canaanitic tribes proper and Hittite tribes already mentioned, the
territory of the Kenites, the Kenezzites, and the Kadmonites. The Kenites were the Hamathite Chepherites of the line of Ezra, now making their way westward. Their name Kenite probably comes from the Japanese ken, intelligent, wise, answering to the Aztec amoxoaques and the Peruvian amautas, who were wise men or
scholars, but whose title has no .such radical signification, being
derived from Hamath, the father of the scribes. The Basque \Qrh jakin, to know, may relate to the Japanese ken. Hamath's story is hinted at in the Izdubar legends of Chaldea, which call him Dumuzi and make Ishtar of Erech his widow.^ According to Professor Sayce, his father was Ubara-Tutu, a name belonging to his ancestor Hepher.* In the book of Nabathsean Agriculture he is the martyr Tammuzi, the first to found the religion of the planets, who was put to death and afterwards lamented by his followers.^ Tabari says that Morthed had the empire after his death, a statement disproved by the Egyptian monuments, although the connection is valuable.^ Plato calls him Thamus and represents him as receiving instruction in letters and astronomy from the Egyptian Thoth. The prophet Ezekiel speaks of women weeping for Tammuz at one of the gates of the

TempleJ The Japanese historians, however, call him Yamato no orotsi, and state that he was a destroying dragon killed by
Sosanno, the first of the terrestrial spirits, in whose name the
Hittite Zuzim appears.^ From these and numerous other references to Hamath in many traditions, it appears that he lived somewhere in Elam or the neighbouring Chaldea, where he cultivated letters and ruled despotically, that he was assassinated like Jehaleleel, and that his death was avenged, and commemorated by fixed periods of mourning. The Peruvian annals know him as Manco Capac Amauta, an Inca much given to astronomy, who convoked a great assembly for the purpose of making celestial observations.^ In Mexican primitive history he is Mixcohua Camaxtli, or, according to some writers, Mixcohuac Amaxtli^ who married the Amazonian queen Chimalman, founded a secret scientific society with peculiar rites, extended his empire widely,
and was assassinated by his nobles, the ringleaders of whom were Apanecatl, Zolton and Cuilton. He was avenged by his son Ceacatl, and Brasseur de Bourbourg says regarding the act of vengeance : " This bloody holocaust was only the prelude to what succeeding ag^es offered to Camaxtli's manes in the barbarous feasts which were instituted in his honour." ^° From a Turanian source his name found its way into the Norse mythology as Heiradall, the doorkeeper of the gods, which gloss is explained by Yama-to, the mountain door. His acute powers of sight and hearing are often alluded to, but his scientific attainments and unhappy end find no mention.^^ The Indian Jamadagni, assassinated by the sons of Arjuna, whose powers he had curtailed, has many points of contact with Hamath, but his son Parasurama, who avenged him, belongs to a much later period in history. The true representative of Hamath in Indian mythology is Himavat, connected with Rishababa and Bharata, or Rechab and Beeroth, and the Emodi montes or Himalayas. The German himmel and English heaven are derived from the Hittite name. In the Norse story Heimdall is the son of nine mothers, and Oegir,

who is Hamath's son or grandson Ezra, the Arabian Hezer of Thamud, is by his wife Ran the father of nine children. In Indian mythology Agnidhra is the father of nine sons, including Bharata and Himavat. Herodotus speaks of the nine springs of Hymettus, with which may be compared the nine wells of Amatha, Hammet or Gadara in Palestine, and the nine muses of Pieria in ^mathia, who deprived the bard Thamyris of sight and his musical powers, and overcame the nine daughters of the ^mathian king.^'^ It is difficult to fix with certainty the genealogies of Hamath,
yet in all probability Rechab and Ezra wei'e his sons, the former being the father of Beeri, and the latter of Jether, Mered, Epher, and Jalon.^^ Of the latter, Mered sought and obtained his fortune in the land of Egypt as the son-in-law of Cheops, the builder of the great pyramid. But Jether remained in the old
seat of Chepherite empire in the east. He called himself in his inscriptions Kudur Mabuk, father of Martu, which may mean lord of Syria, and lord of Yamut-bal or Elam.^^ The name of
his father, read Simti Silhak, may contain disguises of those of Ezra, the father of Jether, and Hamath, his grandfather. Mabuk, as replacing Jether, denotes the matriarchy characteristic of the Hittites, and refers to some connection with the family that named Mabog in Syria, where Atargatis or his relative, Jerigoth, was worshipped. Sanscrit mythology explains Mabog by the name Vach, who is Sachi, Indrani, the wife of Indra and the source of his knowledge, so that the prefixed ma is the
honorific Hittite particle, meaning great, illustrious. This Indra is Jether and the Adar of the Assyrians and Chaldeans, to whom as a god the month Tammuz was dedicated, while as himself naming a month he was dedicated to the seven great gods. The Aztec story calls him Mapach, and says he was the grandson of Camaxtli or Hemath. He presided over the temples of Caraaxtli,
to which was reserved the right of initiation into m3-steries, and of conferring the highest degrees of chivalry. His attendant
'2 The Nino Bow Barb.arians of the Egj']itian monuments, and the various places called Knneahodoi, or the Nine Ways in Greece, may relate to the same family. 13 1 Chron. ii. 55, iv. 17. Compare Genesis xxvi. 34. '* Records of the Past, iii. 19.

guards were the Cintin.^^ The Ithrites, descendants of Jether, are in the Kenite genealogy counted along with the Puthi or Puhites to Kirjath Jearim, an Amorite family descended from Gibeon or Zibeon, a Horite. Jether, therefore, must have married into the ruling Horite family of Egypt, and have thence obtained that knowledge of sacred things which is represented by the Soma Draught that made Indra stronff.^^ The name Mabog reappears in Ambika, a sister of Rudra, for the Rudras and Maruts were Indra's constant attendants. But Bog, Buk, Puth, is undoubtedly the Sanscrit frog princess, Bheki, who married a king with the condition that he would never show her a drop of water, and who vanished from him when the condition was broken. Sir George Cox has compared this with many parallel tales in folk lore, including the story of Psyche. ^^ In the Japanese story the heroine is the daughter of Toyo Tama ; the hero or king who marries the sea maiden is Fiko Fofo ; their son is Fiko Naki ; and the father who did not long survive his wife's departure was buried at Faka ya no Yama, in the Province of Fiouga/*^ In Aztec, iDcicidli is the name of a month, and means moss or a tree parasite, according to the commentators on the calendar. The interpretation of these ancient signs is, how
ever, very doubtful, but as the month Quecholli of the Mexicans represents the Semitic Chisleu, and their Atemoztli, the Semitic Tammuz, so may Pachtli, as containing the hog of Mabog, represent the month Adar called after Jether or Mabuk. The relations of this family with the legendarj^ history of the
world are so vast, owing to the fact that the family was one of
scribes identified with the most ancient seats of learning, that mere suggestion for the present must take the place of an attempt to give its record. Kudur Mabuk's own inscription leads George Smith to say that he did not reign personally in Babylonia. The inference, therefore, is that he dwelt in Elam, there continuing the line of the Kudurs. Yet the Arabian historians know him as Hadher, son of Thamud, son of Gether,

and place his dwelling in the region of mountains hetween the land of Moab and the ^lanitic gulf of the Red Sea, originally occupied by Horites and Amalekites.^^ In the history of David,
KinsT of Israel, it is stated that the Gezrites, descendants of Ezra or Gezra, father of Jether, were, with the Geshurites and Amalekites, the inhabitants from of old of the wilderness of Shur or northern Arabia Petraeeu^" Not of this region only, but of the whole of Syria, Kudur Mabuk called himself the lord. The three sons of Jether were Jered, the father of Gedor ; Heber, the father of Socho ; and Jekuthiel, the father of Zanoah. The eldest of these, Jered, is Ardu-sin of the monuments, the son of Kudur Mabug, and the founder of Eridu. His brief inscription reads
:
" To Ur his king : Kudur Mabuk lord of Syria, son of Simti Silhak, worshipper of Ur, his protector marching before him, Bit Rubmah, for his preservation and the preservation of Ardu-Sin, his son, king of Larsa, they built." 21
This Jered, or Ardu, was a man of great note in his day. From him the Red Sea gained its name, Erythraean, he, and not Esau,
beincr the Ervthras after whom it was called. He was also Orthos, or Orthros, the Typhonian dog that guarded the oxen of Geryon, as his ancestor Chareph was Cerberus. In the Sanscrit mythology he was Rudra, always associated with Indra and the Maruts. Aditi,
daughter of Vasus, also is made the mother of the Rudras.
Brihaspati, the tutor of the gods, the priest of Indra, friend of the Maruts and Rudras, and the restorer of the cows stolen from Indra by the Panis, is but a form of the name of Rechab, the brother of Ezra. He is the same as Vrishakapi the ape, the Greek Cercops, the Persian Gerchasp, or Keresaspa. Professor Max Mtiller compares with Vrishakapi the obscure Greek name Ericapaeus.-' The relationship is made still closer when Vrishakapayi is made the mother of Indra, and mother-in-law of Vach. The monkey Cercopes are represented in the Greek mythology as infesters of Lydia, whom Hercules led captive. The traditions which best set forth Jered are the Welsh, which were borrowed from the

Turanian Ottadini and Silures. He is in them the original Art
or Arthur, who, as Davies says, " is a traditional character totally distinct from the prince who assumed that name in the beginning
of the sixth century. He is placed, as Mr. Owen remarks, high in the mythological ages, and far beyond the reach of authentic profane history." ^3 This Arthur was the son of Uthy r Pendragon
,
and the name of his mother, Eigyr, or Ogyrven, is really that of his grandfather Ezra, the Indian Guzra and Agra, and the Scandinavian Oeo-ir. As the Welsh tradition makes Ezra a woman, so the Scandinavian does Jered, who becomes Jord, or Hertha.-'* The book of Genesis is silent regarding the empire of Jether and Jered in Palestine, but mentions the Kenites in the passage
alluded to, as inhabitants of a region that was to become the possession of the Israelites. That region was somewhere between the Arish and the Euphrates, and may very well have been part of Mount Hor, in which the Kenites dwelt when Israel was essaying to enter the land of promise. There are some names belonging to primitive Egyptian history that seem to indicate Kenite sovereignty over part of that country, and certainly Mered, the brother of Jether, lived and died there. Jether and Jered must 'have been later than Abraham, who was doubtless contemporary W'ith Hamath as he had been with Chedorlaomer. Another tribe, whose lands were promised to Abraham's
descendants, was that of the Kenizzites. They were the posterity of a Hittite ancestor, who has so far been merely named, Ethnan, the youngest son of Ashchur and Helah. Yet, according to Greek mythology, he must have been one of the most warlike and tur
bulent of the seven Hittite kings, for from his name came that of the Titans, who warred against Jove. His people were the Uten or Aten of the Egyptian monuments,identified by interpreters with
the Danai. There is little doubt that the identification is correct, and that, still further, the famous name of Athene, or Minerva, arose wdth this line ; but of course neither the Danai nor Athene were originally Greek. The Ethnanites appear to have been dwelling in close proximity to the Kenites in the northern part
of the range of Hor, for the earliest Greek traditions coimect

aEmathia, an ancient abode of the Hamathites, Math the Titanic region of Pieria. The first king who ruled in Edom, that is, in the country south of Moab, if indeed it do not include Moab and all the habitable district eastward towards Chaldea, was Bela, or Belag, the son of Beor, or Begor, and he was an Ethnanite. The materials are at present wanting in histoiy to fill up the gap which exists between Beor and Ethnan. No mention is made of this tribe in the story of Chedorlaomer. The Arabian historians, count Adnan in their genealogies and unite him with Bera, but generally refer them to the posterity of Ishmael.*-''' Ethnan himself may be Tanaus the Scyth, whom Justin makes contemporary with the Egyptian Sesostris.-*^ He is the Titan from whom came Pallas, the father of Athene, and his name is represented by ^Etna^
the mother of the Pnlici. In every case Bela, or Belag, is the earliest historic name in the line, and he is the Belus of the Chal
dean and Gieek records, an Assyrian, a Lydian, a Phoenician, an Egyptian, a Titan, as fancy dictated. The author of Phallic worship, the most revolting kind of religion man has conceived, he gained a wide notoriety. The place in which he set up his empire is called Dinhabah, a word that seems decomposable into Di Nehabah, the latter part of which was afterwards contracted to
Nebo. At Mount Nebo, therefore, so famous in the story of Israel's wanderings, the tribe of Ethnan began its empire, while Baal Peor, near at hand, was the sanctuary in which was instituted the licentious cult of the emblem to which the Greeks gave the name of Priapus, but which the Hittite traditions show only too clearly to have been the same as the Palladium, on which the safety of Troy depended. Although history furnishes no connection of Ethnan with Bela, the son of Beor, other mythologies besides the Greek help to do so. In the Chaldean, Bel, called Merodach, is the son of Hea, and the father of Nebo, his wife being Zirpanit, supposed to be the same as Succoth Benoth of the Bible. The Welsh deity corresponding to Hea is Hu, who is also called Teithan and Beli, into M^hose ritual the word Beer of
unknown signification enters, and whose connections were largely of a phallic character. ^'^ In this Hea, or Hu, doubtless the Ahi of

THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE. 221
the Sanscrit, who is connected with Bala as an enemy of Indra, we may see a son or near descendant of Ethnan, and at the same time the namer of the mysterious Avim, Avites, Auites or Gauites, who dwelt from Hazerim to Gaza, or along the whole of the south of Judah, before the Caphtorim came from Egypt and drove them
out.^^ This identification is strengthened by the fact that the Avites, who were settled in Samaria, made Nibhaz and Tartak their gods, in the former of whom Nehabah, or Nebo, may be recognized. ^^ The Arabian tradition makes Ace a son of Adnan.
The chief difficulty in this genealogy is to explain the name Merodach. If it be the same as Amarud there is no reconciling it with the Kenite genealogy, for Mered, whom all such forms
represent, has no relation with Bel. It is confessedly an obscure term, and may consist of two words, Beor as Meor, and dach, the Georgian tzes, a son, Lesghian darga, Japanese doji, a boy. Thus Bel as Bela might fitly be called Meor-dach, the boy or son of Beor. The Etruscan Tages, who, as a child, issued from a clod and tauo-ht the Tarquins, probably presents this dach, and it may be contained in the name of Moritagus, or Moritasgus, a god of the Senones. It will thus answer to the Irish name Murtough and the Welsh Meriadawc.
Diodorus Siculus, who makes Busiris one of the generals of Osiris and a protector of the Egyptian coast, derives from Egypt the Belus who established the Babylonian empire. The resemblance of the Osirian rites to those of Baal Peor certainly suggests contact between Egypt and the kingdom of Gebalene. The common Greek tradition regarding Belus is that he was the son of Neptune and Libya, that he ruled either in Egypt or in Phoenicia, and that his children were Danaus and ^gyptus. According to Diodorus, an Egyptian king was Bocchoris, the son of Gnephactus, who cursed Menes for introducing luxury into the land. Poseidon was the Greek name of Neptune, but Plutarch informs us that the Egyptians called a sea-beat shore Nepthun ; and it is known
that Napata was the name of Ethiopia. In the Arabian o-enealogies Adnan, Ace, Beor and Bera, are always connected with Nabet
who is Nebaioth, the eldest son of Ishmael. In the Sanscrit

222 THE HITTITES.
traditions he is Nabhaga, wrongly associated with Ambarisha. Nebaioth is the Gnephactus of Diodorus, and stands in some definite marriage relation towards Beor, Begor, Busiris or Bocchoris, and Bela or Belus. If Nebaioth were the father-in-law of Beor and the maternal grandfather of Bela, the latter is in the fourth generation after Abraham, which makes a late beginning for Palestinian monarchy, and is chronologically irreconcilable with
other data given in history. We must, therefore, rest contented with the fact that the Nabateans and Ethnanites were connected by marriage. Ishmael, the father of Nebaioth, had an Egyptian mother and an Egyptian wife. It is natural that his eldest son should have sought his fortune in his maternal country, and have left in it the impress of his name, the signs of which have generally been attributed to the unhistorical Naphtuhim of Mizraim. The account which the Greek writers give of Busiris most fre([uently is, that he and his brother Antaeus were tyrants in Egypt,
and that he was in the habit of sacrificing red-haired foreigners,
for which he was put to death by Hercules. The story is probably true, in spite of the numerous disclaimers and attempts that have been made to explain it away. The sacrifice of human
victims was characteristic of some of the Hittite tribes, and continued to exist in Mexico down to the time of the Spanish invasion. The Greek story represents the human sacrifice as a recommendation of the Cyprian prophet Thrasius to deliver Egypt from a dearth that had lasted nine years. The Mexican legend says that, being long deprived of the light of the sun, the gods assembled at Teotihuacan to devise means for bringing back the luminary. An altar fire was kindled, and one of the gods named Nanahuatl, who was suffering from a loathsome and incurable
disease, threw himself into the flames, being followed in this act
of self-sacrifice by another called Metztli. Then the sun reappeared, and the captives, whom these two gods had previously taken for the purpose, were immolated to their manes.^^ Nanahuatl represents Tonatiuh, or the sun, and Metztli is the moon.
It is significant that one of the deities who presided over the primitive sacrifice was Nappateuctli. This practice was continued till the time of the reformer Quetzalcohuatl, who, however, was

overthrown by the votaries of Tetzcatlipoca, representing the ancient sanguinary creed, when human sacrifice resumed its reign. In the time of Herodotus, the Tauri, who dwelt among the Euro
pean Scyths, sacrificed strangers. The Indian story of the origin of human sacrifice and phallic worship is very like the Mexican, the name of Siva replacing that of Nanahuatl in all the disgusting particulars of the legend. ^^ The connection of Siva, whose licentious worship has often been compared with that of Baal Peor and Priapus, with Bela, the son of Beor, is historical. The brother of Belus, according to the Greeks, was Agenor, representing the Hittite Kenaz, who was the head of the Kenezzites. This Kenaz was the father of Othniel, or Gothniel, from whom descended a daughter Hathath, or Chathath, the wife of Abiezer, who was the son of a famous Gileadite queen, Hammoleketh ; their son was Meonothai, or Megonothai, and his son was Ophrah, Gophrah, Leophrah, or Legophrah. But the second son of Kenaz was Seraiah, an ancient Syrus, Sirius, or Surya. He is the Soris who heads Manetho's fourth, Memphite dynasty, and his son Joab is the following
Suphis. Of Joab it is said that he was the father of the valley of the Charashim. This Joab, or Suphis, is the Siva whom the Hittites introduced into India to form a triad with Vishnu and Brahma. The sons of Siva were Kartikeya, Skanda or Guha, and Ganesa or Nagamukhi. In Ganesa and Skanda the Kenezzite name is concealed, and Kartikeya denotes the Charash, from whom the Charashim, or Cilicians, received their name. The various names of Siva's consort are Uma, Parvati, Gauri, Bhavani, and
she was either identified or intimately associated with Durga, Nareda or Kali, who delights in the blood of human victims. The same licentious orgies which characterized the line of Seraiah were found in that of Othniel, for his daughter Chathath was the original goddess Cotytto of the Thracian Edoni, whose name was probably derived from that of Othniel, rather than from that of the more remote ancestor Ethnan.^^ His line was equally

Mr. Maurice, knowing nothing of the corresponding Mexican tradition, in that of Siva tells one that tallies with it, and presents the accordance therewith of the story of Aristophanes and his Scholiast regarding the institution of the Greek Phallica. 32 Strabo, x. iii. 16.



224 THE HITTITES.
prominent in Egypt with that of Seraiah, for Meonothai furnished the name Menephthah, his mother Hathath, or Chathath, Hatasu, and his son Leophrah, the Labaris or Laobra of the labyrinth. It appears, therefore, that Beor, or Begor, the head of this corrupt family, really reigned in the land of Egypt, and that his descendant Kenaz, who was most likely the Apachnas of the Hycsos lists, ruled in that country long after Bela fled to Gebalene and established, at Dinhabah, the dynasty of the kings who reigned in Edom. Bela and his son, after whom he named his city Dinhabah, as Cain was the first to do, are represented by the Greek Belus and his son Danaus, by Belus and Ninus of Babylonian and Lydian tradition, the Bel and Nebo of Chaldean mythology, and by many similar names pertaining to primitive history. To the period of
their rule must belong a great contest, the account of which is preserved in the Indian Scriptures, and which resembles the Mexican story of the long darkness that fell upon the gods. The Mahabharata says : " the gods and Danavas fought together in dreadful darkness ; when Svarbhanu pierced with his arrows the sun and moon. Enveloped in gloom the gods were slaughtered by the Danavas together with the Balis. Being thus slain and exhausted, the Celestials beheld the Brahman Atri employed in austerities." Atri shed light upon the world, and Indra drove Balis and Danavas far to the south.^^ The Brahman Atri is not to be confounded with Indra. As a Brahman, if he be an historical personage, he may be represented by Jether, son of Jada, or Yadag, son of Onam, whose mother was Atarah, the wife of Jerahmeel.^* It is recorded that this Jether died without children. Now to the north of the land of Moab and in the south of Ammon was Ataroth, a famous city, and still farther north in Gilead was Ataroth Shophan, while, exhibiting the connections of the name, there was a third city called Ataroth Adar, on the boundaries of the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin, south-east of Joppa, to the north of which lay Ono, and, to the west, Rama, Arimathea, or Randa. The Ataroths were memorials of their great mother Atarah, made by the Onites, or lonians, of the race of Jerahmeel
^ Muir's Sanscrit Texts, vol. i. 469. »* 1 Chron. ii. 28.



THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE. 225
and Ram. This family, therefore, dwelt beyond Jordan, and united with the Hamathites, or Kenites, in the south, in overthrowing the power of Bela and Nehabah. Strange to say, commentators upon Indian and Arabian history have made the same mistake of identifying Atarah with Keturah, the last wife of the patriarch Abraham. As the word Atarah begins with ay in, it may be pronounced Gatarah. She is thus Gayatri, wife of Brahma and at the same time the female head of the Arabian Katoora who are always connected with the Arkam, or Yerachmeelites. The Arabian traditions tell of war between the Nabateans and the Katoora, which resulted in the latter being driven northwards.^^ With the Nabateans we have already seen that the Ethnanites, whom Bela and Nehabah represent, were closely allied.
It would appear, therefore, that the united forces of Ethnan and Nebaioth had established Bela upon his throne in Dinhabah, where he eclipsed the sun and moon, perhaps the solar and lunar Hittite lines, for there were such in Palestine and Syria long before they fixed themselves in the solar Ayodya and the lunar
Pruyag of India. For a time the Hittite tribes endured this rule with its concomitant slavery, but at length they rebelled, and with the aid of the Japhetic lonians of Cythera. overcame the
tyrants and their bestial followers, who probabl}^ took refuge in the east, making Chaldea acquainted with the names of Bel and Nebo. In Greek story Bela continued to be known as Phlegyas, the strong and impious, who warred against the gods and took Delphi, although some writers attribute the latter exploit to Danaus.^^ From him the Phlegraean fields of Thrace and Italy received their name, being the supposed scenes of the war between the Titans and the gods.
There is a story connected with Phlegyas that tends to illustrate
the relation of Bela's family with other peoples. In the Greek
mythology his brother, or son, is called Ixion, who married Dia, the daughter of Deioneus, and promised his father-in-law large nuptial gifts. When Deioneus came to receive them, the treacherous Ixion had a fire pit prepared, which he covered over with a semblance of solid ground. The unhappy father-in-law fell into
•'S Lenormp.nt, An. Hist, of East, ii. s" Di Nhabah, son of Bela, is Danaus as well as Nebo and Ninus. (15)



220 THE HITTITES.
the pit and was consumed.''^ This story is the counterpart of the Persian one concerning Zohak, or Biurasp, who by his second name exhibits his descent from Beor, the father of Bela. He also
destroyed his father-in-law, Mirtas the Tasi, b}^ suti'ering him to fall into a pit of fire. Thereafter he was troubled with a disease
which could only be cured by the application to the part afflicted of human brains, to supply which large numbers of persons were put to death, until Gavah,the blacksmith, arose in arms, overcame Zohak and placed Feridun upon the Persian throne.^^ This Zohak represents a late descendant of Beor, the Zoheth of the Kenite
genealogy, whom we shall yet meet with in Egj^ptian histoiy.^^ The fire pit and slaughter of men for the purpose of curing the
tyrant's disease, alike refer to the bloody rites inaugurated by Beor, or Busiris. So famous did the name of Zoheth, the son of
Ishi, the son of Leophrah, become that it eclipsed those of his
predecessors in tribal nomenclature. From him, among others, the orallicized Tectosages of Galatia and Gaul received their
designation, and in the latter country they called themselves Volcae, thus adding the name of their remote ancestor Bela, or Belacf. This and similar connections make it clear that Kenaz was the descendant of Bela and the ancestor of the Ixion who is made the son of Phlegyas. Kenaz also is well identified with the enemy of the Indian Krishna, namel}'' Kansa, king of Mathura, whose successor Sura is Seraiah, the second son of Kenaz. None of this race belong to the Vedic period, but its members occupy a
large place in the later literature of the Hindoos. A common
hatred to the peaceful precepts of Buddhism united the proud Brahman and the Turanian worshipper of Bali and Siva, and thus brouglit the Ethnanite abominations into the Indian pantheon. To the present day the Khonds, fit descendants of the ancient Kenaz, retain their sanguinary rites, and steal children to innnolate them
to their vile gods. Ephron in Hebron, and Bela in Dinhabah, were but the first waves of a tide that overswept Palestine east and west of Jordan,
carrying away in its course the traces of Horitc, or Amorite,

sovereignty, and leaving an alluvium of Hittite nomenclature on the land that the wear and tear of ages has not been aVjle to remove. South-east of Bethlehem the ancestral name of Tekoa was revived, and to the west of it lay the land of Hepher, with Marath and Gedor. Farther south in Caleb's land was Eshtemoa, and to the east of it Keilah was commemorated in the hill of Hachilah, an ancient Thessalian Achilles. Southward again, Ithnan and Nebo joined Ethnan and his descendant Nehabah.
Halhul, Ziph, and Arba celebrated the Zerethite line of Jehaleleel
;
Mareshah, Hebron, Tappuah, and Maon, the Shuhite division of the Achashtarites : and Goshen, Beth-Palet, and Madmannah, the families of Achuzam. In the west of Judah, the Japhetic Philistines and Jerachmeelites held their own, and the latter people, passing eastward along the north of that thickly peopled region,
erected a line of fortified cities, of which Jericho, facing the Jordan, was the most famous, that they might keep up communication with the loniaus of the trans-Jordanic Ataroths. But in that
eastern country, as well as in all northern Palestine, the Hittites were the great namers of cities, rivers and mountains. Not Esau
only, but the sons of Jacob also married into the Hittite families, as the story of Judah shows, and as the names of the sons of many of the patriarchs plainly declare. Such are the names of Zohar,
son of Simeon, Tola of Issachar, Elon and Jahleel of Zebulon, Beriah of Asher, Naaman and Rosh of Benjamin, and Hushim of Dan. It is no wonder, therefore, that an editor, uninspired for
this work, regarded the Israelites as the eponyms of the places in which they dwelt so long, and counted the great heroes of Hittite
empire among their progenitors. All civilized nations that followed in the track of the Hittites have done the same thing,
so that what is true of the land of Israel is equally applicable to Persia and India, to Greece and Italy, to Spain and Gaul and Britain. Everywhere, that ancient people became the pioneers
of civilization, and to their successors in all these lands the words
are appropriate, " other men laboured and ye are entered into their labours." The Cadmonites were not Hittites, but of the Horite family of Etam, or Getam.*''

CHAPTER IV.
The Kings that Reigned in Edom.
The king wliom the revolting Hittites placed upon the throne of Gebalene, after the expulsion of Bela and his son Nehabah, was Jobab, the son of Zerah of Bozrah. In his person, Amalek, the first of the nations, regained the empire of which Chedorlaomer had deprived that son of Temeni. The son of Amalek was probably an ancient Eliphaz, and the son of Eliphaz was the Elon of whom Esau's wife Judith was the grand-daughter. These Amalekites, or Amalika, as the Arabian historians call them, dwelt in old times from Mecca in Arabia to Mount Seir, including the lands of Tayraa and Ayla, the Teman and Elath of the Bible, the former being named after Temeni and the latter after Elon. Among their tribes were Lati" or Eliphaz, Bodayl or Bozrah, Azrak or Zerach, and Djasim or Husham.^ The son of Elon was Bozrah, from whom came the name of the city, which w^as the centre of the new Amalekite dominion, between the foot of the Dead Sea and Petra. This Bozrah was the father of Zerach, and his son was Jobab, fhe successor of Bela on the throne of Gebalene. The ancient Greek writers preserved traditions of this ancient family,
and either transported its local and tribal names to the soil of
Hellas, or received them from Amalekite predecessors in that land.
In Achaia especially do these appear as the group of cities called Dyme, Olenus, Patrae, and ^giura, commemorating Temeni, Elon, Bozrah and Husham. Olenus is famous in classic poetry as the rnan turned into a rock from devotion to his wife, a fable which
finds its explanation in Bozrah, the name of his son wdio replaced him, out of which the Greeks made Petra. a rock. The many
names given to certain gods, such as Abadir, Baetylus. Lapis, all denoting stones^ appear to have had the same origin. The Amale
kite connection of Bozrah is well set forth by the tradition that Eumelus, a hellenized Amalek, first dwelt at Patrae.^ The name

of Elon, also, in the Homeric Olenus, in ^tolia, is associated with Amalthaea, who was called Olenia. She and her sister Melissa were the daughters of Melisseus, king of Crete, who fed the infant Jupiter. Eumelus, Amalthaea, Melisseus, with the Molossi of Epirus and Amphilochia, are all Greek versions of the Hittite Amalek. So great was the fame of Elon that poems were attributed to him, and, as the Lycian Olen, he was regarded as an older bard than even Orpheus.^ But nearer to the ancient seat of Hittite empire a remnant of Amalek survives to the present day in the Ossetes of the Caucasus, the descendants of the ancient Albanians. In lag, their word for a man, they preserve that portion of the name Ama-lek which seems to have been most important, for Olen was called a Lycian, and Um-lak now denotes the ancient Lachish. They call themselves Iron, and are called Osi by the Georgians, but are well identified with the Alans of the early Christian centuries. Iron and Alan are forms of Elon, and Osi, As, Huzi, are derived from Husham.* The river Terek on which they dwell commemorates Zerach, and their tribal names Badill and Fitghor set forth Bozrah, the former resembling the Arabic Bodayl.^ Other tribal names, Dugor and Globi, suggest an admixture of Amalek with the Calebite Tsocharites. But Georgian legendary history recognizes Jobab as the author of Ossetic sovereignty in the story that the king of the Chasars,
from the countries north of the Caucasus, having carried away captives from Georgia and Armenia, settled them to the west of
the Terek under his son Uobos, and these constituted the Ossetic
people.**
The storj' of Jobab and his ancestors, as reported by the Greeks from imperfectly understood Hittite tradition, is one of cruelty and marvellous transformations.'^ His father Zerach gave name

The name Chasar is discordant, as it pertains to the Zocharite lords of Razor, or Chazor. ^ These, and many other classical stories referred to, have been drawn from a great variety of sources, and are here mentioned so briefly that to cite authorities would overburden the pages with notes.

to Thrace, which was a transplanted Zerka from the land of Moab,
and figures as Tereus, the earliest king of that country. Herodotus makes a later Teres, or Tereus, the founder of the monarchy of the historical Odrysae. The first or legendary Tereus is said to have married Procne, daughter of Pandion, king of Athens, and to have offered violence to her sister Philomela, after which he cut out her tongue. Thereupon Procne served up to Tereus the flesh of his own son Itys, and fled with Philomela towards her fathers dominions. When about to be overtaken by her husband, she
prayed that she and her sister might be turned into birds. The prayer was granted; Procne became aedon, the nightingale, and Philomela, chelidon, the swallow, while Tereus was metamor
phosed into epops, the hoopoe. It is hard to penetrate the disguise of the narrative, but it is evident that epops denotes Jobab,
the successor of Zerach, just as the petra into which Olenus was turned denotes his son Bozrah. In a companion story, Tereus is replaced by his father Bozrah, who is called Pandareus, the son of Merops of Miletus. He had a daughter ^do, who married Zethus, the brother of Amphion. Envying the numerous posterity of her sister-in-law Niobe, she resolved to kill her eldest son, but
by mistake put her own son Itys, or Itylus, to death. Still another legend makes Pandareus of Ephesus the father of iEdon and Chelidonia. ^don married Polytechnus of Colophon, who some time after their marriage went to Ephesus, at the request of his wife, to bring to Colophon her sister Chelidonia. He behaved towards her as Tereus had done in the case of Philomela, whereupon the two women resolved to make him eat the flesh of his son Itys. Finally the whole family were transformed into
birds. Similar in its horrors is the. Lydian story of Tantalus, who
served up the flesh of his son Pelops to the gods. It connects
with the foregoing, in that Pandareus, having .stolen the golden I log that guarded the Olenian Amalthaea, gave it to Tantalus.
As Tantalus refused to restore the dog to Jupiter, a rock was
suspended over him. The reduplicate word Tantklus suggests
Daulis, the constant scene of the exploits of Tereus, and the very name of Tereus with the change of r to /. The rock again is Petra, or Bozrah. Another name for Pelops is Apis. The names of Zethus and Amphion have occurred in these

leo-ends. A more historical tradition represents Antiope, the daughter of Nycteus, as fleeing- to the court of Epopeus, king of Sicyon. Epopeus married her, Avhereupon Lycus, at the last request of his bi'other Nycteus, invaded Sicyon, killed Epopeus and brought away Antiope, who became the mother of Zethus and Amphion. The Zerach name is in this story attributed to a woman,
Dirce, the wife of Lj^cus, who cruelly treated Antiope until her sons avenged her. Yet another horriljle legend is that of Xyctimene, the daughter of Epopeus, king of Lesbos, who, being vilely treated by her father, fled to the woods and was metamorphosed into an owl. According to Pausanias, the predecessor of Epopeus on the throne of Sicyon was Corax. In the Chaldean Izdubar tablets, part of the story preserved by the Greeks is recorded. Hubaba, or Humbaba, is there represented as a tyrannical eastern kinof holdino- his court among the erini and survan trees. Izdubar
plotted his death, and sent his attendant Zaidu to bring the hermit Heabani to aid him in the enterprise. Some woman is alluded
to in the narrative, but the tablets are so fragmentary that noth
ing can be gathered of her part in the history. Izdubar and Heabani, however, attacked Hubaba in his palace and cut oft' his head, but not long afterwards Heabani himself was slain.^ In Chaldean sculptures Heabani is represented with half a goat's body, precisely as Pan and the Fauns and Satyrs were afterwards delineated. He is undoubtedly the original Pan, Paeon, Faunus, Favonius, Hipponous and Evander. Taken along with Zaidu, the Greek Zethus, he is Amphion and a Hittite Jephunneh. The Arabian story calls the tribe of Jobab by anticipation the Tasm, for it was Husham, his successor, from whom that name was derived. It states that a Tasmite tyrant, ruling also over the Jadis, descended from Jether, made a law subjecting the daughters
of the Jadis to his lust, whereupon the men of that tribe conspired, invited the king and chief nobles of the Tasm to a banquet, and there despatched them. A few escaped, however, and, being aided by Dhu Habshan ebn Akran of Yaman, they destro3'ed the Jadis.** From all the above mentioned sources of information, it
appears that Jobab ruled as despotically as Bela, that the sacrifice

of children, attriV)uted generally to L3^caon, marked the worship of his tribe, and that his expulsion of the votaries of Baal Peor was counterbalanced by his personal immorality. The Ethnanites and Tsocharites, represented by Izdubar and Zaidu on the one hand, and by Heabani on the other, and confusedly set forth in the Greek legends as Zethus and Amphion against Lycus, resent
ing injury inflicted upon the women of their tribes, attacked Jobab and put him to death. It is a question whether the kingdom established by Zerach, the father of Jobab, which the Greeks called Thrace, while at the same time they made Corax the predecessor of Epopeus, be not the same as the Karrak kingdom so
often referred to in early Chaldean inscriptions. No such city is known in Chaldea. The name of the first king of Karrak is doubtful, but it has been provisionally read as Gamil Ninip ; then come Isbi Barra, Libit Anunit, and Ismi Dagan. Of these the last is the only one that remotely resembles the Kenite list of the
descendants of Zerach. ^'^ The Amalekites did not lose their supremacy with the fall of Jobab. His successor on the throne of Bozrah was another man of the family of Temeni, named Husham or Chusham, and he is the Hasem of the Arabian historian Tabari.^^ From him came the Ossetic, and many similar names of the dispersed Amalekites. He is the Sicyon of the Greeks and the eponym of the kingdom of that name, which they regarded as the most ancient in the world. It is said to have embraced the whole of Achaia, but it cea.sed to exist as a kingdom even as early as the time of Homer. Its tribes were Hylloans and Dymanes, Pamphyllians and yEgialeans.of whom the Hylleans an'd Dymanes represented the posterity of Elon and Temeni. In Achaia we have already found Dyme, Patrae, Olenus and ^gium, setting forth the same family. Sicyon him.self, who named the ancient kingdom, was far down in the list of kings, for he is variously called the son of Marathon and grand-son of Epopeus, the son of Pelops, of Erechtheus, of Methion.^"^ Lamedon of Sicyon, who appears to be the same as the Trojan

Laomedon, married his daughter Zeuxippe, and thus inherited the kingdom. It is abundantly evident that Chusham as Sicyon was a relative of Jobab, His daughter Zeuxippe is apparently the same person as Hecuba, who married not Laomedon, but his son Priam. By some accounts Hecuba was the daughter of the Phrygian Dymas and the sister of Asius ; by others, the daughter
of Cisseus of Thrace. Asius, son of Dymas, answers to Casus, or Cisus, son of Temenus, and many neutral characters in Greek legendary history are similar echoes of Husham. But he was no
neutral character, althouorh his record is hard to glean. It must be found in connection with the story of Jobab, his predecessor, and with that of his successor, Hadad, the son of Bedad. This Bedad was probably the son of Beeri and grandson of Rechab, the Hamathite. Thus Hadad represents the Beerothite or junior
division of the Hepherites. Diodorus found an echo of the primitive Thracian history in which Husham, as a descendant of Zerach, should flourish, in the island of Naxos. It was first inhabited by Thracians, whose kingBoreas had banished them, together with his rebellious son Butes, from the mainland, when they took refuge in this island. Thence Butes made an expedition in search of wives for the colonists, and, landing in Thessaly, carried off the Bacchante Corouis, on account of which evil deed the offended god struck him with madness, so that he threw himself into a well and was drowned. But his followers succeeded in escaping to Naxos, taking with them Iphimedea, the wife of Aloeus, and her daughter Pancratis. Then they appointed Agassamenus king instead of Butes, and made him marry Pancratis, after two of their lords, Sicelus and Ecetor, had slain each other contending for her hand. The bereaved Aloeus sent his two sons, Otus and Ephialtes, to .seek their mother and sister. They came to Naxos, vanquished the Thracians, and reigned in the island where their sister soon after
died.^^ The historic elements are present in the narrative, but
much confused ; for Boreas, though rightly the father of Butes, as Beeri was of Bedad, was no Thracian. In Agassamenus, the successor of Butes, however, Chusham, the Thracian, appears. Homer knew him as a king of Thrace, Acessamenus, the father of Periboea,
13 Diod. Sic. V. 31.



234 THE HITTITES.
who married Axius and became the mother of Pelegon. And he seems to be the same person as Dexamenus of Olenus, the father of Deianira, but also of Theronice and Therophone, who married Cteatus and Eur3-tus, the sons of Actor. With Amphimachus and
Thalpius, their sons, was associated in government Polyxenus, son of Agasthenes and grandson of Augeas. This Pelegon, or Polyxenus, will yet appear. Hellanicns, according to Pausanias, made Polyxenus a .son of Jason and Medea, the Colchian princess. Pausanias continues, quoting Eumelus, some hellenized Amalekite, to the effect that the Sun had given Ephyraea to ^etes, who departed to the region of the Colchi, whereupon Epopeus, son of
Aloeus, usurped its sovereignty. After his death and that of Corinthus, the son of Marathon, the Corinthians called Medea to be their queen, and, through her, Jason reigned in Corinth. Now Corinth and Sicyon were not far apart. Epopeus and Marathon
occur in the traditions of both, but the Sicyon of the one is replaced by Jason in the other. Homer knew nothing of the story of the Argonauts which has been told by so many poets and prose
writers. Different traditions of the same man coming through various channels have multiplied traditional personages, so that Husham, or Chusham, is represented in Greek story alone by Sicyon, Agassamenus, Acessamenus, Dexamenus, Jason, Axius, Augeas,Cisseus, Asius, and even Aegeus, who is said to have married Medea and to have been the father of Medus. The Mede connection is constant, Jason and Aegeus marrying Medea, Agassamenus marrying the daughter of Iphimedea, Sicyon being called the son of Methion and marrying his daughter to Lamedon. In the story of Ja.son, Husham's enemy, whom he plunders, is ^Eetes ; in that of Agassamenus, who occupies the throne of Butes, the enemy and avenger is Otus. Then comes in Pelegon, the descendant of
Acessamenus.or Polyxenus, attributed ec^ually to Jason and Augeas.
Strabo regards the expedition of Jason as well attested by the Jasonia of many lands that marked his track and preserved his memory, such as the Jasonian promontory in Pontus, and towns called Ja.sonia in Media, Armenia, and among the Ceraunii mountains in Albania. Wherever the Elon or Iron name is found in ancient geography, there will that of Ja.son, or Husham, appear,
and the same is true if Eliphaz, or Alp, replaces Elon, or if both give way to Tcmeni, Amalek, Bozrah, or Zerach.



THE KINGS THAT REIGNED IN EDim. 235
The story of Husham is one of a period of warfare between the Temenite or Anialekite line to which he belonged, and the Hepherite or Hamathite one of Beeri, Bedad, and Hadad. The historians of Athens represent Bedad by Pandion, as the Sanscrit writers do by Panda, a change analogous to that which appears in the word Hindu as compared with its Hebrew e<|uivalent Hod. Pandion was at war first with the Theban Labdacus, an Egyptian king, for there was no other Thebes then in existence than the
Egyptian, and called in the aid of the Thracian Tereus, whose story has already been considered. Similar names connected with Athenian history are those of Butes, the son of Pandion, Pandion II., and Peteus, the father of Menestheus, who fought in the Trojan war. Pandion II. belongs to the history of the next reign in Gebalene. Already it has been seen that the Jadis of Jether, some Hadadite relatives of the greater Hamathites in the
line of Jether, the son of Ezra, rose in rebellion against Jobab,
the son of Zerach, or Tereus, and put him to death. According to the Naxian story of Diodorus, this event was followed by the death of Bedad, his Butes son of Boreas. Pandion is said to have died of grief for the misfortunes of his family. Then Husham, after a struggle, was accepted as king of Gebalene, and allied himself by marriage with the Beerothite line, represented by a second Bedad, or a first Hadad. By this marriage he came, rightly or wrongly, into possession of a treasure represented in the story of the Argonauts by the golden fleece, and in the mythology which the Teutons borrowed from their subject Turanians by the wealth of the Yolsungs and the Niflungs, or Nibelungen. The Teuton-Hittite versions of the story of Husham came from
two different sources. The Niflung, or Nibelungen, name is the Nipur of the Chaldeans and Assyrians, a nunnated form of Hepher, answeiing to it as Nergal does to Hercules and Nizroch to Zerach.^* The Niflung names, Gunther, Guttorm, and Gudrun, represent the Hepherite Gedors, the Elamite Kudurs, the first and chief of them, in the historical Gandarian and mythological Centaur form. Sigurd, or Siegfried, a name yet to be identified, married Gudrun, or Kriemhild, the sister of the Nifluno-s, and was killed by Hagen, who is called her uncle. This Hagen is Husham,
1* Der Nibelungen Lied.



236 THE HITTITES.
set forth as the ally of the Niflung brothers, who got possession through his means of the great treasures of Kriemhild. Kriemhild seeking revenge, married Atli, whose name recalls the Itylus of the Tereus legends, and put Hagen and her brothers to death.
This lecfend indicates an alliance of the elder branch of the Hepherite family, represented by the Gezrites of southern Palestine, or it may be by the Elamite Kudurs, with the Amalekites under Husham, and the overthrow of both by the Beerothite Hadad. The Volsung story bears the name of Polyxenus or Pelegon, who descended from Husham as Acessamenus, Augeas,
or Jason.^^ In this, Sigmund is the first hero, far surpassing
Siggeir, the husband of his sister Signy. Sigmund and Siggeir contend for the magic sword Gram, and Sigmund is made a prisoner, bat is freed by his sister. He fights his old battle over again with the sons of king Hunding, " in whom," says Sir George Cox, " are reflected the followers of Siggeir," and falls before the might of Odin.^° In this case Sigmund is Chusham, in a Sicvonic form, and king Hunding is Hadad, the Had becoming Hund, as Hod becomes Hind. In another part of the Saga he is Hogni, whose heart Atli cuts out of his body, and Regin is the possessor of the treasure. But who are the Volsung ? They are Amalekite Pelagones, Paphlagonians, Peligni, and their ancestor, who restored empire to the line of Temeni, was one of the kings that reigned in Edom. India, as the land of Hud, where ruled the Bharatan race, should know something of the Hushamite war. It does, but altogether from the Beerothite point of view. The Mahabharata sets forth the contest between the Pandus and the Kurus, or Kauravas.^^ They descended from a remote ancestor Budha, who came to India from some Scythic region. In his line was Bharat, king of Hustinapore, from whom came Yuyati, the father of Uru, Puru and Yadu, and from Puru came Pandu and Dhritarashtra. The latter was the father of the Kurus or Kauravas, but Pandu's sons were Yudisthira, Bhima and Arjuna. In this genealogy Beeri is twice represented as Puru and Bharat, as is Bedad, whom
'5 Die Sagen von den Wolsungen, etc. ''• Aryan Mytliology. 1^ Veda Vya.sa, le Malia Barata.



THE KINGS THAT REIGNED IN EDOM. 237
Budha and Pandu set forth, while Hadad has triple mention in Yuyati, Yadu and Yudisthira. The last form of Hadad's name corresponds to the Biblical Hadad-ezer, which in David's time was the name of the son of Rehob, king of Hamath Zobah, who possessed Betah and Berothai. There were two Yudisthiras among the kings of Cashmere. The Parthians, or later Bharatas, whose empire began in the third century B.C., inverted the
elements of this name, giving it to their kings as Teri-dates. It became Zada-akira among the Japanese, Ato-tarho among the Iroquois, Huascar-titu among the Peruvians. Even among the
Pictish Britons it survived in the corrupt form Hudi-bras, the son of Brutus, and father of Badud. In the Assyrian stories of Hittite conquest it has been read as Giri-dadi and Cigiri-dadi. There can be no doubt that the Yudisthira of the Mahabharata is the Hadad son of Bedad who followed Husham on the throne of Gebalene. Yet Husham was not his chief enemy. The Indian epic gives this place to Duryodhana, an Indian Dardanus, whose mother was Gandhari. He belonged, therefore, to the family of Zereth, which, in the person of Arioch or Urukh, the son of
Asareel, had married into the Gedor line of Hittite EJamites, his wife being Jerigoth. He can be no other than her son or grandson Ardon, the Feridun of the Persians. For it is worthy of note that many Indian gods were Persian demons, including Ander and Saurva, or Indra and Siva. This interchange of name with difference of function between two Aryan nations is not indicative
of religious opposition or of racial antipathies, but of the fact that the two peoples received what became to them mythology from two distinct and hostile divisions of the Hittite stock. The father of Duryodhana is wrongly made a descendant of Puru, Yuyati and Budha, and his name Dhritarashtra is probably derived from that of Zereth, the ancestor of the tribe to which Ardon belonged. Yudisthira established himself at Indraprustha, where Duryodhana visited him and won away his kingdom in gambling. The accomplices of Duryodhana in his act of trickery, for he appear.5 to have loaded his dice, were the king of Gandhara and a certain deceiver named Cakuni. This Cakuni, or Sakuni, the Greek Sicyon, is Chusham in his Indian dress. His character of treachery identifies him with Khasm, or ^shma-daeva, in the



238 THK HITTITES.
Zend Avesta, who is the same as the Asinodeus of the apocryphal book of Tobit.^*^ He is probably the Sisunaga who is fabled to have reigned in Magadha in 19G2 B.C.^'^ In Buddhist history he figures favourably as Kakusanda and Kshema, whom it is hard to separate from Kasyapa.-" To him seems to relate the story of Caca the hare, who gave his flesh for Indra to eat, and whom that deity placed in the moon, ^-a^in, to become what in western nursery language is the man in the moon.-^ The Buddhist Calmuks tell the same story of Sakyamuni, an ancient Buddha, who, meeting a starving man, metamorphosed himself into a hare and allowed himself to be taken to satisfy the man's hunger. Thereupon the figure of a hare was placed in the moon to commemorate this act of devotion.-" All that can be gleaned from a brief survey of Indian mythology and legendary history is that Husham was the ally and intimate friend of the Chepherite Kudurs represented by Gandhara, the Niflung Gunther, whose strength is Hagen, and by Indra, who represents Jether, the head of the family of Gedor.
The story of the Mahabharata leads naturally to the history of Husham's successor, Hadad, the son of Bedad. He removed the seat of empire from Bozrah to Avith, a place whose name so closely resembles that of the Avites as to lead one to look for it
in the Avite countr}- in the north of Arabia Petraea. There was pi-obably a place of this name in Gebalene, but the more famous Avith, in which the line of Hadad held royal state, was Abydos in Egypt. JChe name Avith connects with the Ethnanite line of Beor and Bela, and the presence of Bedad and Hadad in that city may explain the appearance of Pandion among the kings of Athens, for Ethnan's name furnished the original Athene. It is stated that Hadad smote Midian in the field of Moab, a fact of great historical importance. Of the sons of Abraham and Keturah, the most famous were Zimran, the progenitor of the Zimri, who are connected with the Medes ; Jokshan, the father of the later

Sheba and Dedan of Arabia; and Midian, from whom came Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah and Eldaah.-^ In Greek legendary
history the two last are, as Aphidas and Elatus, made the sons of Areas, indicating thus some connection with the Jerachmeelites through their grandmother Keturah. The Midianites are first
set forth in the Bible as merchantmen traflficking between Gilead and Eo-ypt. Prior to the Exodus they must have exerted much influence in Arabia Petraea, for it was called after them the land of Midian, and the Kenite Jethro who dwelt there was a priest of Midian.2* When Israel, on the way to the land of promise, halted in Moab, the Midianites were there confederate with King Balak and partakers in the abominations of Baal Peor. Their five princes, Evi, Rekem, Hur, Reba and Zur, the father of Cozbi, were slain by Joshua in the same field of Moab in which Hadad encountered them.^^ In the Izdubar legends, Heabani says
:
" I will bring to the midst of Erech a Midannu. And if he is able he will destroj' it. In the desert it is begotten, it has great strength." 26
Is not this the encroaching Midianite rather than the tiger, as the word has been provisionally rendered ? One of the Attic Pandions was driven from his dominions by the mysterious Metionidae and died in exile at Megara.-" Metion, their ancestor, is made a son or grandson of Erechtheus, thus indicating his Jerachmeelite descent. In the Mahabharata, Indra and
all the o-ods are said to have been enclo.sed within the mouth of Mada, a great monster. They sought deliverance from the Brahman Chyavana, from whom the monster proceeded. He weakened its power, and Indra then clove Mada to pieces. This Mada is no other than Madhuchhandas, or Madhusyanda, a son of that Visvamitra whose story has been compared with Abraham's, and lie is also Matanga, who was found by a speaking ass whose colt he had struck with a goad, to be no Brahman, as was supposed, but a half-breed. The unhappy Matanga made innumerable

efforts to attain Brahmanhood, but without success. Again, he is the giant Madhu, overthrown by Krishna, or, along with his companion, Kaitabha, slaughtered by Vishnu.^^ As a people, the Midianites may be identified with the Mutibas, descended from Visvamitra and the Madavas of Cashmere. Berosus places a Median dynasty on the Babylonian throne at an early and indefinite period, and states that it continued in power for two and a half centuries.-^ In the story of the preceding reign the Midianite name appears as Metion, a supposed father of Sicyon, as Lamedon, his son-in-law, and as Medea, the wife of Jason, with a son Medus. Iphimedea, again, whose daughter Agassamenus married, was the wife of Aloeus, or Aleus, the son of Aphidas, or
Abidah. It is evident, therefore, that Husham was allied with the Midianites, and that they aided him in oppressing the Beerothite Bedad, in other words, were the Metionidae who expelled Pandion. So well versed did they become in the worship of Baal Peor during their reign in Gebalene and in Chaldea
that the Romans called that god by their name, Mutinus Titinus.^*^ An idea of what the Midianite invasion must have been may be gathered from the record of a later one : " And they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude ; for both they and their camels were without number ; and they entered into the land to destroy it. And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites." ^^ No wonder that Mahdu is spoken of as a giant, or that Mada is represented as gathering Indra and all the gods into his mouth and depriving them of earth and heaven. One branch of the Keturites remained long in Chaldea, the descendants of Zimran, called the Sumerians, whom the prophet Jeremiah calls Zimri, and unites with Elam and the Medes. So great was their fame that the Chaldean monarchs called themselves kinirs of Sumer and Accad. These were the

Zimri of the Assyrian inscriptions, the Gimiri of the Persian, the Cimmerians of the Greeks, and the Cymri of Wales.^- The allied Midianites were the Medes, among whom in Media many
Hittite tribes, especially those of Hepher and Temeni, were mingled. The Indian story of the disowmed Matanga, who at first passed for a Brahman, seems to indicate a separation of the sons of Keturah from their mother's Aryan race, and their alliance with the Hittite stock, an alliance that continued down to the palmy days of the Roman Empire, when, in Europe at least, the Hittites, or Iberians, almost disappeared as a distinct people. Hadad must have been a man of amazing energy and courage, for his foes w^ere many. The Temenite line, represented by Husham, was in undoubted alliance wnth his Midianite adversaries. The Zerethites, or Dardanians, under Ardon, were his enemies, for the Mahabharata represents Duryodhana as the chief of .his opponents. The Kudurs of Elam, related to Beeroth by ties of blood most closely, were also in league with those who .
oppressed his country. Yet, if the Indian story of the great war be true, he must have gained over part, at least, of these kinsmen, otherwise Indraprustha, named after their great hero Jether, would not have been his capital. Moreover, Krishna and
Baludeva his brother, who represent two families of the Achuzamites, or Zuzims, were on his side. The Mahabharata sets forth the Hadad side of the conflict ; the Teutonic legend of the Three
Ilelsfis, that of his enemies. But in the legends of Dietrich of Berne, who is imprisoned by Sigenot in one of them, and kills Ecke in another, the Beerothite story is told, for Dietrich is but a form of Hadadezer, as Ecke and Sigenot are forms of Husham • In the Greek mythology Hadad has also a prominent place. The Thra co-Athenian annalists with the second Pandion connect iEgeus and his son Theseus, but re-establish the descent of the latter from Bedad by making his maternal grandfather Pittheus of Troezene. His character as a great conqueror and wise legislator, his overcoming the Amazons and escaping the enmity of Medea, both of which point to Midianite opposition, and his unhappy fate at the hands of Lycomedes, King of Scyros, to

the Pallantidae rebelled against him, all reflect vaguely the inci
dents of Bharatan story. His capital of Aphidna may also be an echo of the Avith of Hadad. A much inferior personage is Tydeus, the son of CEneus, whose father was Parthaon. He murdered his uncle Lycopeus, a Hittite Rechab, and fled to Adrastus, whom he joined in the war against Thebes. His son was Diomede.^^ This latter name has a curious connection with Hadad, whose city was Avith. In Hamath Zobah the name of this city was revived as Betah and as Tibhath, which is the Dyved that the Welsh mythological writers place in the land of Hud ; and this Dyved by a common change became Demetia. In the tribal nomenclature of South Wales it was represented by the country of the Demetae about the Towy and the Teify, in Latin the Tobias and Tuerobis rivers, in which St. David received honours, beinsf but a form of the Hercules Diodas who, according to
Eusebius, anciently ruled in Phrenicia. There is reason to believe
that Avith was the name of Hadad's wife, for he himself, in the Yudisthira or Hadadezer form of his name, is well identified with the Scythian Apollo called (Etosyrus, while Tahiti, the
Scythian Vesta, is Avith with the prefix as Tibhath.^* The Welsh Tuerobis paves the way for the comparison of Tahiti with Draupadi, daughter of the King of the Upper Doab, the consort of Yudisthira, won for him by his brother Arjuna. Davies associates Demetia with the worship of Demeter or Ceres, and Sir George Cox similarly connects Draupadi, the daughter of Guzra Bai, with her daughter Persephone.^^ Macrobius states that Adad, denoting both the sun and unity, was the chief divinity of the Syrians, and Sanchoniatho calls Adodus the king of the crods. He is thus the same as the Welsh Aedd, from whom the ^Edui are supposed to have received their name.'^^ " And Hadad died and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead." The Indian account of Yudisthira's death is that it over
took him in exile. Wear}'' of the strife, and sad at iieart for the

bloodshed by which he regained his throne, he abdicated and took his way to Mount Meru, the cradle of his race. One by one his friends perished on the road, till he and his dog alone were left, and these Indra received into the heavens. According to the Raja Tarangini, a blind and dissolute king of the name went into exile and became a peaceful sage, although the author admits that others thought he had made an attempt to regain the kingdom and was imprisoned by his officers.^^ The Iroquois legend of Atotarho, King of the Onondagas or mountain men, represents him as a great tyrant, as well as a most successful warrior and a man of powerful intellect. It tells how he became
partially insane after killing a fabulous bird, but is silent regard
ing his death. ^^ In the Greek story of Theseus, exile is the fate
of the hero, whom the rebellious Pallantidae, descendants of Bela, and the invading Dioscuri, representing the family of Achashtari as Castor, drove from his kingdom. To the Achashtarite line belonged Samlah of Masrekah. His father, or more probably his grandfather, occupies one of the most prominent
positions in legendary history, but has happily left inscriptions which justify his withdrawal from the cloudland of mythology. This personage is the Hammurabi that set up a kingdom in Babel, thenceforth to remain the capital of Babylonia. The exiled line of the Ethnanites had taken refuge there, and Hammurabi joined himself to its fortunes, making Bel Merodach, Nebo, and his consort Urmitu, his divinities. In Babel he reigned as King of Sumer and Accad, or of Cymri and Heth ; from that capital he went forth on many a warlike expedition, bringing all
Chaldea under his swa}'. He built cities, excavated canals, gave
dykes to the Euphrates, and strove, as he says, to give pleasure to his people.^*^ His supposed successor, whose name is found on some tablets but on no public monument, was Samsu-iluna, a lengthened formof the Hebraeo-Hittite Samlah. Already the name of Hammurabi has been considered. In Assyrian it is Kimtarapastum, the family of the physicians or of the mighty, equivalent to the Hebrew Beth Rapha, the head of the Rephaim

who dwelt in Ashteroth Karnaim. In one Babylonian list his successor is made Amraisadugga, but the cuneiform chai*acter read as ditg may also denote cir, thus changing the name to Ammisacirga, which is like the Masrekah of the Kenite list. Of this Masrekah Samlah was the son. In giving the genealogy of Beth Rapha, the editor of the Book of Chronicles adds, " and these are anslie Rechoh," the men of Rechah. The Rekah of Masrekah and the Rechah of Chronicles contain different medial
letters, nevertheless many facts indicate that they refer to the same person and race. The Indian scriptures constantly unite the Rakshasas, Pisachas, and Nagas, or the three families of Rapha, Paseach and Nahash, and sometimes call the foi'mer
Mahoragas.^'^ The story of Rapha's family is told in the Finnish Kalewala, a poem that furnished Longfellow with the metre of his Hiawatha,
and in the Kalewipoeg of the Esthonians.*^ Rawa is set forth as the descendant of Kalew or Kaleb, and the Esthonian name from an ancient Eystein, reproduces Eshton. But the sons of Rawa are Wainamoinen or Orpheus, and Ihnarinen or Vulcan. These latter names bear little resemblance to any that other stories connect with that of Rapha. In Ramus's Historiae Norvegicae, Rolvo, who is Rawa, is made the husband of Goe, the sister of Nor, in whom we find the eponym of Norway. Nor married his sister Hoddu. The mother of Rolvo and Hoddu was Askilda, the daughter of Eistenus. Chelub, instead of heading the list, is represented by Gylvus, King of Sweden, who was the son of Goiter, a nephew of Queen Goe. Leaving out Kare, Froste and Snaer, or Wind, Frost and Snow, whom the most ardent Euhemerist would hardly care to personify, the earlier Norse
genealogies are those of Rapha and of the Hepherite line of Ezra.*'- In Ezra must be found the original of the Ugrian name, applied to the Finnic family of peoples and languages which, though varying somewhat from the Khitan type proper, have at the same time their closest affinities with it. As Greeks, Romans,
Persians, Indians, and Celts adopted the legendary lore and

worship of the Turanians they conquered, so did the Norsemen of Scandinavia, their brethren of Germany, and the Sclaves of eastern Europe. Even when the Japhetic name Rom is reached in the genealogies, and an Aryan coimection is fairly established,
many Hittite names still remain to attest the admixture of races in the north.*^ Chelub in the form Kalew shines forth in the
Ugrian epics as the ancestor of the race. The primitive people of Finland and Esthonia are made the descendants of his son Rawa, or Rahwa, whose name is also presented in that of the Esthonian god Tarapyha, and in Revel the modern name of Esthonia, as well as in Dorpat of Livonia, which in Riga gives a home to the men of Recah. These names are valuable as explaining such forms as Triopas and Trapezus among the Greeks. The Lapp name, whence comes Lappi-gunda, an inversion of KhaniRabi, is of the same origin, and may be compared with the Lebu or Libyans of the Egyptian monuments, whose name is frequently read Robu and identified with the Berber nomenclature of northern Africa. The vocabulary and grammatical structure of most Berber dialects are not Khitan, but akin to the Celtic ; nevertheless there was a large Hittite element in the Berber area. What light does the Ugrian mythology shed upon the relation of Samlah of Masrekah to Rapha ? The very clearest, for he is the supreme god of the Rahwas and Lappis, being the Finnish Jomala and Jomal, the Esthonian Jommal, the Lapp Jabmel and Ibmel, and the Permian Jenlen. Their brethren, the Mordwins and Mokshas, seem to trace their descent from Paseach the brother of Rapha, for their great god is Paas or Shkipaas. This Jomala or Yomala is the Zamolxis of the Thracian Getae noticed by Herodotus and Strabo, and the statement of the former that he was no god but a slave of Pythagoras, the son of Mnesarchus, arose doubtless from a misunderstood report that he was the son of Masrekah."** It is true, as Diogenes Laertius shows, that Pythagoras was the son of Mnesarchus, but Herodotus is the only authority for connecting Zamolxis with him, and he doubted the report, believing him to be much older

than the philosopher.'*^ In the dialect of some Thraeians
Zamolxis was Gebeleizis, the m of the former being naturallyconverted into the labial h. From this latter form came the Greek kobalos and German kobold, as well as the English goblin, which translates them. In Syria the name received an increment, for the god representing Jomala was Carmelus of Mount Carmel, whom Tacitus and Suetonius mention, and whom Hitzig in his book on the Philistines, compares with the Indian Kumara.**' There was a Carmalas river in Cappadocia, and a town Carmylessus in Lycia. Among the Greek quasi-divinities, Camillus, an epithet of Mercury, and Camillus or Casmillus one of the Cabiri, denote Samlah ; and Camirus, a city of Rhodes named after one of the Heliades, answers to the Sanscrit form Kumara. He was also worshipped by the Gauls as Camulus ; and Cameliomagus in Cis-alpine Gaul, Samulocenis in Vindelicia, Camalodunum in Britain, with the Pictish Camelon, and Arthurian Camelot, received his name. The prophet Jeremiah mentions a sanctuary
of his in Moab to the east of Nebo, called Beth Gamul.*'' Eusebius cites a city Masreka in Gebalene, but its site is undetermined. The descendants of Sandah retained his name, and were known to the great Shalmanezer as the Samahlians, and to Tiglath
Pileser II. as the Samhalians.'**^ These, according to Professor Sayce, dwelt in Cappadocia on the western border of Commagene. But another, and apparently a larger, body of them constituted the Gainbulians, who are mentioned by many A.ssyrian monarchs. They dwelt in the marshes south of Babylonia, where they con
structed lake dwellings like those which Herodotus atti'ibutes to
the inhabitants of lake Prasias in Thrace.'*'^ Similar dwellings once existed in some of the lakes of Switzerland, and are found at the present day in parts of the Malay Archipelago, and on the Orinoco in South America. As a race, the Greeks called the Rephaim by many names. One of these was that of the I^apitha3, who fought with and finally overcame the Centaurs or Elamite Kudurs. A curious and

valuable piece of history relating to Beth Rapha or Hammurabi, under the name Lapithus, is that he married Eurynome, the widow of Arsinous, who represents the Indian Crishna.^'^ His sons, Phorbas and Periphas, but repeat the Rapha name. Again, they were the Dryopes of Thessaly, who dwelt on the river Campylus, and whose original home in Parnassus connects them with Ir Nahash, the son of Techinnah, Kapha's youngest brother, whose name descended to the Tugeni of the lake-dweller area in Switzerland, that have left the Toggenberg as their memorial. In Switzerland, also, Beth Rapha survived as Urbigenus pagus. But a more famous name was that of the Meropes. These were connected with the island of Cos as a race of giants and physicians, rivalling the line of ^sculapius and Paeon, and their ancestor was Eumelus, the son of Merops, in whom the Yoraala of the Rahwas is at once visible. Homer gives to Troy the Meropian name, which is justified by the vicinity of Pedasus and Lyrnessus, named after Paseach and Ir Nahash. Northern Africa, where the Rubu or Lebu dwelt, is also made the home of the Meropes, who are identified with the Atlantians. The
Meropes were also called Macares, a name that seems to set forth Masraka rather than Mehir or Mechir, for Pausanias connects Macareus, Trapezus and Thocnus as sons of a mythical Lycaon, and Macareus and Merops are associated with the earliest history of the island of Lesbos, famous in the story of Orpheus, who will yet be found to represent Rapha. Lesbos again was a son of Lapithus, and he married Methymna, the daughter of Macareus. Diodorus makes Macareus the son of Crinacus, who is Ir or Gir Nahash, and says that he composed a book of laws. The same connection appears in Pausanias, according to whom Megareus was the son-in-law of Nisus, king of Megara. Now Nisus is Nahash once more, and the Sanscrit Nahusha. Megareus is called the son of Poseidon or Neptune, but it is evident that Po-Seidon is Eshton, his grandfather, for another account gives Megarus as the son of Jupiter and one of the Sithnidian nymphs.^^ Samlah reappears in Timalcus, the son of Megareus, who was slain by Theseus, according to some Greek writers, a statement
'" Diod. Sic. iv. 26. ^1 Pausanias, i. 40.



248 THE HITTITES.
which Pausanias denies. In Pontus of Asia Minor the Macrones represent Megareus and Maeareus, Colopene of the Chalybes, the ancestral Chelub, Sidene, Eshton, Trapezus, Beth Kapha, and Pharnacia of the Chalybes, Ir Nahash. In Thrace the Sithones
were ancient Erjthonians. Turner suggested that Kapha was the original of Orpheus, and that he was a great physician as well as the chief among
ancient musicians. It was a mere guess, and the Abbe Banier
cites it only to pass it by as improbable.^'^ Perhaps Turner was led to make the suggestion by the statement of Pliny that medicine was discovered by Arabus, the son of Apollo and Babylonis."''^ Orpheus also was reputed a son of Apollo and Calliope, whose name reflects that of his ancestor, Chelub, but was also made a son of (EaoTUs, kino- of Thrace. He was a Thracian, and Tertullian says was honoured by the Thracians as a god. Strabo calls him
a Ciconian, but Pliny a Sithonian, and the latter is right, for the Sithonians were of Eshton, the father of Beth Kapha. The Cicones dwelt about Mount Khodope, the Sithonians on the shore of the Black Sea, where places named Tarpodizus represented the Dorpats and Tarapyhas of the north. Conon has a strangely mixed up story about Sithon, the ancestor of the Sithones. He was the son of Poseidon and Ossa, who offered his daughter in marriage to the man who could conquer him in single combat, whereupon Merops of Anthemusia, and Periphetes of Mygdonia, entered the lists against him and were killed.^* In Poseidon his own name is repeated, and the two unfortunate suitors bear the name of his eldest son. Visiting Egypt, Orpheus learned mysteries, and, returning to Thrace, moved all nature by the charm of his lyre and song. When his wife Eurydice was taken away,
he entered the land of the immortals, lulling the watchers to sleep by his music, and gained permission to bring Eurydice back ; but, looking upon her before they were outside of the spirit world, he lost lier forever. Afterwards the Thracian women tore him to
pieces and his head floated to the island of Lesbos. The comparative mythologists have identified the story of Orpheus with
52 Banier, Mythology Explained, iv. 157. 53 Pliny, H. N. vii. 57. ^ Conon, X.



THE KINGS THAT REIGNED IN EDOM. 249
two others that are well known. One is that of Wainamoinen, the son of Rawa, as told in the Kalewala of the Finns. He made himself a lyre, and with it delighted gods and men. At the sound of his harp and voice the forests blossomed and bore fruit. Seeking greater things, he descended to Pojola, the realm of gloom, like Orpheus, disarming the warders by his song, and fled to the light with the mystic Sampo. In the mediaeval tale of the Pied Piper of Hameln, which Mr. Browning has immortalized in his verse, the wonderful musician, whose strains draw all the rats of the infested city into the Weser, and who similarly leads away
all the children when the town council refuses to satisfy his demands, we have not only a repetition of Orpheus and Wainamoinen, but a connection of Samlah, for Hameln is the Finnic Yomala. But the most famous counterpart of the story of Orpheus is the Indian one of Pururavas. He loves Urvasi, a heavenly nymph, who marries the king with the condition that she must never see him unclothed. Being alarmed, he suddenly
rises from his couch, and the moonlight falling upon his figure reveals him to his spouse, who. like Eurydice, disappears never to return. In other accounts Pururavas was the author of the triple Veda, and was the son of Sudyumna or Ha, who was at times a man, at others a woman ; but Sudyumna is a Sanscrit Eshton or Sithon. The son of Pururavas was Ayus, and of him came Nahusha or Nahash, Rambha, a repetition of Rapha, and Eaji or Recah, while a fourth son, Kshattravriddha, whose name sets forth the great ancestor Achashtari, had in Sunahotra a much disguised Samlah.^^ Professor Max Miiller has identified Pururavas of the three Vedas, and Orpheus, with the three wise Ribhus, and the Bribus or carpenters, and these are the Chelubite trio that came of Eshton, the first of whom was Rapha. ^"^ Mythology is not yet done with the house of the ph3^sicians. He is Eumolpus, another Thracian, the son of Poseidon and Chione. He was brought up in Ethiopia, from whence he returned to Thrace and took refuge with King Tegyrius, some Tsocharite, bringing with him his son Ismarus, who represents Samlah. When war took place between the Thracians and

Athenians and the former were defeated, the family of Eumolpus was retained in power by the victors, as a priestly caste presiding over the Eleusinian mysteries. Again he is Mclampus, the first physician, who is mistakenly called the son of Amythaon and Idomene. In his brother Bias, however, Paseach appears. Melampus saved some young serpents, the parents of which had
been killed by his servants, and they in gratitude licked his ears so that he understood the songs of the birds and all earth's voices. Apollo taught him divination and he grew wise in the healing art. When his brother Bias, wishing to marry Pero, the daughter of Neleus, was told that she could only be his on the condition that he brought back from Iphiclus, King of Phylace, in Thessaly, the cows of Tyro, the mother of Neleus, Melampus took his brother's place, and by his arts got back the cows,
famous in Sanscrit as in Greek story. Then he healed the daughters of Prcetus, King of Argos, and, marrying one of them, shared the kingdom with that monarch's successor, Acrisius. The name of Samlah is obscurely given as Amphilochus, the son of Amphiaraus, his descendant. To Herodotus, the physician was
no myth, for to him he attributes the introduction into Greece of the Dionysiac abominations of Phallus worship.^'' The monuments of Hammurabi confirm this charge of Herodotus, for they indicate that his deities were the Ethnanite ancestral gods,
and in particular Bel Merodach, the Hebrew Baal Peor. In Persian legendary history Rapha is a somewhat neutral character, being Mihrab, King of Cabul, whose daughter Rodabeh married Zaul, the son of Saum.''^ This Rodabeh can hardly be any other than the Rhodope, or Rhodopis, of the Greeks, who is said to have been a Thracian. The name certainly was Thracian, for the western mountain range of Thrace was called Rhodope. With this Rhodope originated the nursery tale of CinderellaAn eagle, having picked up one of her sandals, dropped it into the lap of Psannnctichus, the Pharaoh, wlio sought out its owner and married her. Herodotus attributes the third pyramid to Rhodope, while Manetho says it was built by Queen Nitocris, who succeeded Menthesuphis, of the sixth Egyptian dynasty.
•'•7 Herodotus, ii. 49. '•« Mirkhond, 170.



THE KINGS THAT REIGNED IN EDOM. 251
Historical truth is lying about in these stories, and may be ascertained by a comparison of legends. Virgil did not invent his heroes, but found them in popular story. One of these is Metabus, King of the Volsci, to whom he gives a wife Casmilla and a daughter Camilla.^** Now, according to Macrobius and Servius, Camillus was the Etruscan equivalent of Mercury. The marriage of a daughter of Samlah to Mezahab, who is Metabus and Menthesuphis, may have been the fact that tradition has disguised. As a descendant of Rapha she could be imputed to Mihrab, while her father Samlah would furnish the Latin writer with the name Casmilla, which would descend to her daughter Matred in the similar form, Camilla. The Egyptian connection is set forth in the marriage of Melampus to a daughter of Proetus, a descendant of ^Egyptus. In another account he married the daughter of Megapenthes, who represents Mezahab. The
same fact is referred to in the Sanscrit scriptures, which make Gritsamada the son of Sunahotra, of the line of Pururavas, and at the same time the son of Vitahavya, or Mezahab.*"" The record of Samlah is but a shadowy one. Camillus, as the Cabir and the Etruscan Mercury, the Celtic Camulus, the Finnish Jomala, are shadowy personages, like the Semalean Jove who was worshipped with the Parnethian Jove at Parnes in Attica. ^^ Zamolxis and Ismarus have no story to speak of. Even Samsu Iluna simply tells of making a canal and adorning the shrines of the gods. It is hard to say whether the supposed Gamil Ninip, who ruled in Karrak, but was also lord of Nipur and Eridu, is the same person, and whether he is to be identified with Gamil Sin, King of Nipur and Ur, and a worshipper of Bel and Nugan.'^^ In the ancient history of Lydia he has double men
tion. In the line of the Atyadae after Hermon, a genuine historical character, the Harum of the Kenite genealogies, comes Gambles, a king so gluttonous that Athenajus says he devoured his wife in his sleep, and, awaking to find one of her hands, all
that remained of his consort, in his mouth, he slew himself. ^^

252 THE HITTITES.
This kino- is repeated in Tmolus, the last of the Atyadae. He must have been a monarch of note, for Mount Tmolus in Lydia was called after him. He is variously made the son of Mars and Theogena, and of Sipylus and Eptonia. His queen was Omphale, the daughter of Jardanus, King of Crete, who is Ardon of the line of Zereth. Now, as one of the sons of the Persian Feridun, who is this Ardon, was Selm, the comparison which Professor Rawlinson institutes between the latter and Zamolxis, or Zal
moxis, as he is sometimes called, is a just one.^* Selm is represented by the Persian historians as possessing the western part of the empire, as warring against Feridun, and meeting death at
the hands of his successor, Miuucheher.*^^ The rest of the story of Tmolus is that he wronged Arriphe, a companion of Artemis, in the temple of Diana, after which he was carried off by a bull and thrown upon sharp stakes, which pierced him and caused his death. This may set forth his fate as the impaled victim of his conqueror, for impalement, a common mode of punishment among the Assyrians, was probably borrowed from the Hittites. Even the Esquimaux legends contain references to this barbarous custom.^^ Herodotus, in describing the worship of Zamolxis, says that every five years the Getae sent a man to lay their wants before him. Three lances were held with their points upwards, and the victim was thrown into the air so that he might fall upon them. If they pierced a vital part, he was a true messenger ; if he lived, he was scouted as an outcast unworthy of the favour of
their god.**^
Julius Africanus begins his list of Chaldean kings with the family to which Samlah belonged. His first Chaldean monarch is Evechous, a name that meant nothing until Assyrian glosses were found for Accadian words. It is now known that Evechous is the Greek rendering of the Accadian Hubisega, which is translated by the Assyrian Bilu, or Bel. The connection of this name
with the line of Chelub is justified l)y another gloss, for Khilip
is Ilu, a god.^** It is natural, therefore, to find the languages of

those Ugrian peoples who trace their descent from Kalew, the medium for interpreting Accadian. Evechous, or Hubisega, lives in Hittite geographical nomenclature as Hupuskia, or Khupuscia. The Circassian Schapsuches and Basque Guipuzcoans must once have worshipped him, as did the Mordwin Ugrians, under the name Shkipaas. In America the Iroquois, whose language possesses no labials, called him louskeha ; the Maskokis knew him as Efikisa, and the Muyscans, of New Granada, adored him as Pes-ca. He is Paseach, the brother of Kapha, whose name in the Semitic languages means the lame or limping, as it does in some Khitan tongues, for hikko is the Japanese word for lame. In Sanscrit it is pangu. Paseach is thus the Egyptian god Ptah, and the Greek Hephaestus. Pachacuti,the fourth Peruvian Inca, was probably the same lame man, for he was the inventor of carriages called LlmnadoresP In the Bible account of David's conquest of the Jebusites, it is said that they told him : " Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither." So David smote the blind and the lame " that are hated of David's soul." '^*' Why should David hate the lame and the blind ? Do not Hapischim and Hagivrim, the lame and the blind, rather denote the worshippers of two heathen deities, one of whom w^as Hubisega ? The successor of Evechous was Chomasbelus, and he is the Samlah of the Kenite record. M. Lenormant reads it as an Assyrian word, Shamash Bel, but it is the Greek rendering of the Assyrian version of a Hittite name, resembling the Welsh form of the same, Cymbeline. Apollonius Rhodius places the Symplegades, or clashing rocks, in that region of the Black Sea wherein the Chalybes, Sidene, the Macrones, Trapezus, and many other memorials of the Chelubite line are found. There also were the' Harpies and the Stympha
lides, allied birds of evil omen ; and in the same country Strabo
places Symbolon Limen, or the signal harbour. All of these words, Symplegades, Stymphalides, and Symbolon, for which Greek etymologies have been furnished, were originally variations of Samlah in the Gambuli, Cambalidus, and Campylus form which the name assumed. There was a Stymphalis in Macedonia, and

a town Styraphalus in Arcadia, near the Stymphalis Palus, where the birds Stymphalides are said to have dwelt. They are often confounded with the Harpies, as, like them, feeding on human flesh. The destruction of these birds was the sixth labour of that Hercules who married Omphale, the widow of Tmolus, from which union sprang Alcaeus, or Agesilaus, the head of the Heraclid dynasty of Lydia. Hercules also took in marriage Parthenojie, the daughter of Stymphalus, who was the mother of Eueres. Strabo makes Stymbara a city of the Dryopes of Thessaly. There was a bird called siyin'pJialis by Pliny, and supposed to be a kind of crane. Now the Megareans, who represented the family of Masrekah, pretended descent frotn cranes
;
and Garanhir, the crane, was a divine personage in Welsh mythology. Mirkhond, in his history of the kings of Persia, says that Saum, the chief officer of Minucheher, gave his son Zaul into the keeping of a hermit named Simurgh, who dwelt in a cell among the mountains. But in another part of the history he makes Esfendiar, the son of Gushtasp, taunt Rustam, Zaul's son, in the following manner : " I have heard from those of former times that Zaul was the offspring of evil spirits, b}^ whom he was exposed in his infancy on the bank of a river ; there the Simurgh seized him and took him to her nest as food for her young ; Vjut even they were so alarmed at his hideous countenance that they would not devour him. The Simurgh, too, regarding him atten
tively and perceiving his repulsive features, suffered him to
remain in a corner of her nest and eat up the fragments of their food. When he grew up she cast him out on the bank of the Helmund, the inhabitants of which place, on beholding his for
bidding flexure, took him for some demon sent to destroy the
human race.""^ The Simurgh is famous in oriental iiction as an enormous bird with a human voice, answering to the Roc of the
Arabian Nights. It is also called Anka, and it is related that some Thamudites dwelling at Al Rass, who despised and at last killed their prophet, Handha, or Khantala, were annoyed by the Anka, which lodged in the mountain above them and used to snatch away their children when other prey was wanting."^ The

winged Sphinx, whom earlier tradition calls Phix, and who sat on the Phicean hill propounding riddles and devouring the people of Thebes, until CEdipus made a happj^ guess and caused her downfall, represents the same family as the Harpies, and Stymphalides, the Simurgh, Anka, and Roc ; but while Rapha and his descendant, Samlah, appear in the former, the Phix denotes the kindred line of Paseach. The traditions regarding this family point to their occupation at one time of part of Egypt, to their expulsion from it in the two lines of Chelub and Shuach, the former being represented by Hammurabi, who established himself on the throne of Babylon, and the latter by the Ras, or people of Ma Reshah.^^ Samlah, the son of Masrekah and gi-andson of Rapha, or Hammurabi, being allied with the Ethnanite worshippers of Baal Peor, whom the Greeks called the Pallantidae, and being himself the descendant of Achashtari, or Castor, the head of the Dioscuri, overthrew the Beerothite dynasty of Hadad, Yudisthira, or Theseus, and established himself on the throne of Gebalene. There he dwelt among the mountains, and strengthened himself by an alliance with the Zerethite tribe, taking to wife a daughter of Ardon, the eponym of the Assyrian Rutennu. Continuing the sanguinary rites of Beer, or Busiris, and sending forth warlike bands to procure captives for his holocausts, he was compared to a ravenous bird devouring human flesh. By some avenger, called in the Greek story Hercules, he was at length killed by impalement, a fitting recompense for his horrid cruelties. His subjects calling themselves by his name as Samahliaus, or Gambulians, fled for refuge to the marshes south of Babylonia, and fixed 'their abode in the water beyond the reach of their enemies. From their lake dwellings they still,
however, sallied forth to get victims for their gods, so that they
were no longer represented l)y the Simurgh in his lofty nest among the hills, but by the water haunting Stymphalides, well trained by Mars, with beaks and talons of iron, and furnished with darts of the same metal for the slaughter of the human victims devoured by them. The Symbolon Limen of the Tauri, where dwelt the Symbolian tribe of that family, was a harbour

with a lighthouse, where an ever burning fire invited passing ships to enter to the destruction of their crews, for the Tauri
sacrificed all shipwrecked persons to their gods. And such fires, burning on the marshy borders of lakes and rivers in Chaldea, in Asia Minor, in Thrace and Switzerland, and in the New World as well, oft tempted travellers seeking hospitality to venture on the treacherous ground that lay between the light and them, until the gliding canoe of the lake dweller was by their side and the Stymphalian dart laid them low, victims for the slaughter. Out
of this story of revolting treachery, often repeated in the world's
history, has grown the ignis fatuus, Will o' the Wisp, or Jack a
Lantern, the Japanese kitsune-bi, or fire of the fox, which flickers
before the eye of the belated wayfarer in the fens, leading him
on to his evil fate.

CHAPTER V.
The Kings that Reigned in Edom (Continued).
The Chelubite Achashtarites had but a short reign in Gehalene, for Saul of Rehoboth by the river restored the Beerothite empire. That Saul was a Beerothite Hittite is attested by many facts. The name Saulius belonged to the European Scyths, denoting a brother of Anacharsis and descendant of Spargapithes, while the similar name Scylas pertained to a son of Ariapithes and grandson of Idanthyrsus, his brother being Octamasadas. ^ Ariapithes and Spargapithes ai-e Rehobothite names; Idanthyrsus is a corruption of Hadadezer ; and Octamasadas is Eshtemoag. The Hadadezer whom David conquered was a son of Reliob, and his country of Hamath Zobah was the land of Rehob.- The slayers of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, were Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon, a Beerothite.^ But Pliny, in a remarkable
and much disputed passage, establishes the descent of Saul from Hadad. " Saulaces, the descendant of iEetes, who reigned in
Colchis, found in the laiid of the Suanes virgin soil, from which he extracted much gold and silver. We read of the golden
arches of his palace, its silver columns and pillars which he gained when he conquered Sesostris, king of Egypt, so proud a monarch that every 3'ear he chose one of his subject kings by lot and yoked him to his car to celebrate anew his triumph." * In addition to this passage, we have already found Saul appearing in profane history as the Persian Zaul. The ancestry given him by Firdusi and Mirkhond is all astray, for Saum was not his father, nor Nariman his grandfather. Gurchasp is the Persian equivalent of Rechab or Rehoboth. Nevertheless, the connection of Zaul with the Simurgh points him out as the Saul who succeeded Samlah, whom the Simurgh sets forth. This Zaul was an

Albino, his hair, eyebrows and lashes being entirely white.^ The Simurc'h brought him up in the mountains until his seventh year, when his father brought him home and exhibited his heir to the people. When he came to manhood king Minucheher made him o-overnor of Nimruz, and, while occupying this position, he married Rodabeh, daughter of Mihrab, king of Cabul. The famous dialogue between Esfendiar and Rustam, the son of Zaul, contains accounts of the miraculous interposition of the Simurgh
on behalf of his family. Zaul refused to accept the faith of
Zoroaster, and in his old age, after the death of Rustam, was taken prisoner by Behmen, Esfendiar's son. All the men of his race were great heroes, and the bulwarks of Iran against her
enemies. In the Mahabharata the maternal uncle of Yudisthira is Sdlya, king of the Madras, an indication that the name Saul was in the family. In the Raja Tarangini there appears Jaloka, a famous king, who at an early age revived the institutions of Yudisthira in Cashmere. He smote the Mlechhas or Amalekites, and paid homage to Rudra, but was also a zealous votary of Siva, the unclean God. Nevertheless, he had a horror of human sacrifice, and when the goddess Kritya, in the disguise of a starvinor woman, asked him for human flesh, he, rather than shed blood, offered her his body to eat.*" Homer preserved the name of Saul as Axylus, the son of Teuthras of Thrace, who dwelt in
Arisba. A similar verbal series is presented in Calchas, the son
of Thestor, and his sister Leucippe. Again Saul is Calais, the
brother of Zetes and son of Boreas, who conquered the Harpies. But firmer ground is reached when it is remembered that the advent of the Achashtarites to Gebalene, in the person of Samlah,
introduced that country into Lydian history, for the Lydians were the Shuchite Achashtarites in the line of Laadah. A^elaus or Agesilaus is called the son of Hercules and Omphale, and the successor of Tmolus on the throne of Lydia, and he is Saul.'' He was the head of the dynasty of the Mermnadae, a name which finds no explanation among ancient writers, although the Myr

midons, or transformed ants of /Egina, the Mariand yni of Bithynia, and other peoples and places of like name, invite comparison. The name that answers to Mermna is the Miriam of the Kenite genealogy. She was the daughter of Jether or Mered, by Bithiah, the daughter of Pharaoh, who seems to have been originally the wife of Jether, but to have been taken from him by Mered.^ Homer knew both mother and daughter, for he tells of the mound* in front of Troy, " which mortals call Batiea, but the immortals, the tomb of quick dancing Myrina," and Apollodorus mistakenly makes Batiea a daughter of Teucer.^ The Arthurian legends liere come to our assistance, giving Coll or Huail, the great law
giver and priest of mysteries, who is the same person as Hoel, king of Armorica, and Coel, duke of Caer Colvin, as the British
version of Saul.^*" Alas ! he has fallen on evil days, for the great Saul of Rehoboth by the river, who measured his strength successfully with the might of Egypt, is " Old King Cole, that merry old soul," of the nursery rhymes. Hoel was the son of a sister of Arthur, by Dubricius, king of Armorica. He had a daughter Helena, who was carried off to Michael's Mount by a savage and deformed giant from Spain, and died in his hands. Coel also was the father of another Helena, w^ho is fabulously represented as the wife of Constantius Chlorus and mother of Constantine the Great, althouo-h Helena is well known to have been a native of Bithynia. Again, the name of Helen is preserved in that of the Gwyllion, or nine prophetic virgins of Seon, pertaining to the rites of Coll or Huail. Davies says concerning the Gwyllion
:
" There was some signal disaster attendant upon the fall of one of
these ladies, hence the bards use the simile in illustrating a hope
less calamity." ^^ Arthur is the Kenite Jered, the father of Gedor,
whose half-sister or cousin was Miriam, and she it is whom the father of Saul married.
The story of Miriam is a remarkable one. Diodo^'us Siculus calls her Myrina, as does Homer, and makes her the Queen of the African Amazons, who dwelt about Lake Tritonis in the Roman

province of Africa. With thirty thousand foot and two thousand horsewomen she captured Cercina, the city of the Atlantides, and put all adult males to death. Then she exterminated the Gorgons, a nation of women like her own, and, entering Egypt, made alliance with Horus, the son of Isis. Afterwards she invaded Arabia, and brought all Syria under her sway. The Cilicians submitted to'her yoke, but the other countries of Asia Minor she conquered, finally establishing her empire on the Caicus, which separates Mysia from Lydia. There Myrina, Cyme, Pitane, Priene, and other cities, commemorated her and her companions. Making an expedition to the island of Lesbos, she founded Mytilene. She also colonized Samothrace, and inaugurated mysteries in that island. But the Thracian Mop.sus, banished by Lycurgus from
his native land, and Sipylus, a Scythian, uniting their troops, fell
upon the country of the Amazons, defeated the female warriors,
and killed their queen.^^ This story is virtually that of Semiramis ; for Xanthus, the Lydian, says that her mother, Atargatis was taken prisoner by jVIopsus and drowned in a lake near Ascalon. where Semiramis was born.^-^ Miriam was not a daughter of Jerigoth or Atargatis, but, belonging to the same family, tradition naturally connected their names. It is probable that Shimron Meron, which, in the tnne of Joshua, was situated not
far from Cana in Galilee, was an epithet of Miriam as well as the name of a city, and that out of this epithet the name Semiramis arose.'* The connection which Macrobius sets forth of Adad and Atargatis is explained by the union of Miriam, who was a niece or second cousin of Jerigoth, with a son of Hadad. The double mention of Mopsus in the Greek tradition is important, as is that of his alliance with Sipylus. Sir Gardner Wilkinson says : " The names of the children of Amnion, as well as of Chemosh, their god, are too near to the Khem and Amun of Egypt to be accidental." '" The same may be said of Moph or Memphis and Moab. Mopsus is the personification of the Moabites, who, under some predecessor of Zippor, the father of Balak, were expelled from Egypt, and, uniting with the similarly banished Amorites, whom their

great ancestor, Shobal, the Egyptian Seb-ra, denoted in the form
Sipylus, began that warfare with the Hittite tribes which dispersed them to the north and east, before Israel entered the land of promise. That the dynasty of Saul fell when the Moabites
returned to Palestine is set forth tiguratively by many Greek writers, who represent the two great sages, Mopsus and Calchas, meeting, according to some in Colophon, according to others in Cilicia, and exhibiting their skill in divination. Mopsus proved
himself the truer prophet, and Calchas, mortified, put an end to
his own life.^*^
The Greek accounts of Saul and his father are numerous and very confused. Theseus, who has been found to illustrate in his history the reign of Hadad, retired to the court of Lycomedes, kino- of Scyros, by whom he is reported to have been put to death. Prior to his exile, his son, Hippolytus, whose mother was Hippolyte or Antiope, queen of the Amazons, was falsely accused by his step-mother, Phaedra, after the manner of the Hebrew Joseph. Theseus cursed his son, whose chariot was overthrown so that he died, although Virgil and Ovid make him live again under the name Virbius, near Marruvium, in the country of the Marsi, where his name is associated with that of Archippus. The people of Troezene, in Argolis, worshipped Hippolytus, and informed Pausanias that he was translated to the skies, where he
forms the constellation called the Charioteer. This must be the Cacab Rucubi of the Assyrians and Chaldeans, a Hebrew celestial Beth Marcaboth. The name Hippolytus is thus a Greek rendering of the original name, the hippos or horse replacing vahah, the horseman or driver of a war chariot. Pausanias mentions Melanippus as a son of Theseus, victorious in the Nemean races, who can be no other than the father of Saul as Marcaboth. The same writer has the story of a Melanippus of unknown parentage who carried off a beautiful maiden, Comaetho, contrary to the will of her parents and his. As she officiated in the temple of Diana, the enraged goddess sent a plague upon the people who had allowed her to be robbed of her priestess, from which they were not delivered until they obeyed the Delphic oracle by annually

262 THE HITTITES.
sacrificing to the goudess a youth and maiden of great beauty. A tale of manly virtue, corresponding to that of Hippolytus, is
told of Peleus, whom Acastus of lolchos, believing him to be guilty, exposed bound upon Mount Pelion to be devoured by wild beasts. He broke his chains and fled, like Theseus, to Scyros, where he married Thetis, the sister of Lycomedes, its king. Other writers say that he took refuge in the Achaean kingdom in Thessaly, and was there united to Philomela, daughter of Actor, the son of Myrmidon. Peleus was the son of ^Eacus and Endeis, daughter of Chiron, in whose time a pestilence wasted the island
of Egina and carried off large numbers of its inhabitants, whereupon ^acus prayed to Jupiter for relief. In a dream he beheld swarms of ants issuing from the root of a tree, which forthwith became men, and in the morning he learned that his kingdom was more populous than ever. This is doubtless a classical invention to explain by tnyrniex, an ant, the name Myrmidones, applied to the earliest inhabitants of ^gina. ^acus like ^geus, is probably a form of Husham, as the Jason who also sets forth his name is made by Medea the father of Mermerus. Peleus settled in Thessaly as king of the Myrmidons there, and his son
was Achilles, who led these Myrmidons to the siege of Troy. Thus Achilles is another Greek name for Saul of Rehoboth ; and the presence of a Course of Achilles in European Scythia, over which, near the time of Herodotus, a Saulius ruled, and the statement that Achilles himself had been king over all the Scyths,
are justified.^^ The fact that Homer, out of one historical
personage, made two such opposite characters as Achilles and
Calchas, is sufficient to show that he must have composed his
immortal epic long after the events it records. In other records the character of Saul, as uniting warlike prowess with zeal for
religious and political reformation, furnishes the materials out of
which, by the aid of different one-sided traditions, the Homeric sage and warrior were evolved. The three religious reformers among the Britons were Menu, Math and Coll.^^ The first of these is doubtless the same as the Indian Manu, author of the Institutes, the Egyptian Menes, the
17 Herodotus, iv. 55 ; conHult Kawlinson's Herodotus, notes in loc. 1* Davies' Druids.



THE KINGS THAT REIGNED IN EDOM. 263
first Pharaoh, and Minos, the law-giver of Crete. In Math or Amathaon appears Hamath, from whom came the Amautas and Amoxoaques of the New World. And Coll, who appears to be the same as the bearded stranger, Morien, that guarded the sacred fire, built Stonehenge, and introduced new rites, while he was also regarded as a public benefactor for superseding the aboriginal oats and rye with wheat and barley, is Saul of Rehoboth. He is represented among Greek Hierophants by Dysaules, which is but another name for Celeus, in whose time barley was first sown in Eleusis, and who founded the Eleusinian mysteries, with which the ancient British mysteries seem to have been identical. Celeus was by Metanira the father of Triptolemus, whose name is akin to that of Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles by Deidamia, daughter of the ever recurring Lycomedes of Scyros. Saul is the ancient Arabian god Sohaii, the Lesghian Saal and Zalla, the Mizjejian Dalle, the Yukahirian Chail or Koil, and the Mexican
Quetzalcoatl. To establish his identity with the greiat culture
hero of the New World it is necessary to consider the meaning of the word Saul. It is virtually the same word as Hazael, which denotes a usurping king in the same Syrian line, and is the Basque hesaula, hezaul, a stake, post, pillar, which the Japanese, having no I, represents by hashira. The German sdule is doubtless a loan word from the Hittite in the Basque form, as is the Hebrew asherah in that of the Japanese, for asherah is generally understood to mean a wooden pillar. The Asherahs are frequently mentioned in the Bible, and have been wrongly translated as groves and the goddess Astarte.^^ They were columns such as the Romans found in Etruria and called by the name cippiis, and such as the Brahmans in India named sthupas or topes, of which the Buddhist kits were the simplest. Pausanias connects the name of Rehob, Rechob, or Rechoboth, the father of Saul, with similar monuments, making mention of that which is called Colona or the mound and the temple of Dionysius Colonata in
Sparta, who was worshipped by the Leucippides.-*^ In the Thupawansa and other Singhalese books which relate the manner in which the Buddhist relics were distributed to be

264 THE HITTITES.
inclosed in topes as objects of adoration, tlie Lichawi princes of Wisala and the princes of Allakappa are made the recipients of some of these treasures.-^ The eponym of the Leucippides, Lichawis, and Allakappas, is Leucippus, whom Diodorns wrongly represents as the son of Naxius or Nahash, and the father of Smardius or Samlah, who, he says, received Theseus when he fled to Naxos with Ariadne, and in whose time Dionysius was born." This passage sets forth the kinship of Nahash and Samlah, the Kapha, and confirms the Persian story of the upbringing of Zaul by the Simurgh, in- the connection of Leucippus, his father Rechoboth, with Smardius. A similar error is found in the Indian genealogies, which give Sumarti as the son of Bharata, whose father is Rishababa.-^ Regal succession has in either case been taken for hereditary descent, and in the Indian list the older Rechab, father of Beeri, the head of the Beerothite or Bharatan race, is confounded with the later Rechoboth. Returning, however," to Quetzalcohuatl, the fair god of the
Mexicans, we find that his name is translated by quetzalli, which
Molina renders 'pluma rica,lar(ja, y re')d(',ii rare large green feather, and coatl, a snake. He is thus the plumed serpent, but
there the explanation ceases, for the serpent had no special part in the rites instituted by him. The head of the Hittite serpent line was Techinnah of the Chelubite line of Achashtarites, the father of Ir Nachash, the Sanscrit Nahusha, from whom came the snake worshipping Nagas of Cashmere, and the American
Natchez. The original signification of quetzalli was a pillar or column of squared timber, which answers to the Basque hezaula and the Japanese hashira. But modern Aztec disguises the word
by prefixing the syllable tla, so that even in Molina's time the wooden column was tla-qitetzalU, which, strange to say, also meant a story or myth. This adventitious tla, which fre([uently
has substantive power, disguises many Aztec words, as for instance tl-ateconi, an axe, which is the Iroquois atoken and the Koriak
adarjcmu. Etymologically, therefore, the name of Quetzal corre.sponds to that of Saul. His genealogy is not given, for like

the British Coll he was regarded as a distinguished stranger coming witli a priestly company Ironi Tlapallan, and returning thither when his work was done, Orizaba being the point of his departure. But, when the name of Quetzalcoatl is introduced
into dynastic lists, it is always associated with that of Camaxtli, the grandfather of Mapach, in whom we have already found the martyr Hamath, whose grandson Jether was called Kudur Mabug, the father of Jered or Ardu-Sin.-"* Like the British Coll or Huail, and the Greek Celeus and Dysaules, who discovered wheat and barley, he went forth on a journey and found Indian corn, with which priceless boon he enriched the Mexican and surrounding peoples.^^- Like the Indian Jaloka, he abolished human
sacrifices, and, resisting all temptations to renew them, lost his throne rather than sanction such barbarities. Coming suddenly upon the scene, like Zaul from the abode of the Sinnirgh, he was, like him, white haired, a tall, well-made man of venerable aspect, though young, full bearded, and clad in a flowing robe of white
sewn with black flowers. In his train came artists, artificers,
men of science, all that could enrich a country and add to its happiness. While he was making progress through the land of the Toltecs, everywhere teaching his new ritual which he professed to have received from the heavens to whom his loud prayers were oflered, the old King Ihuitmal died at Tollan, and
the people of Anahuac called him to the throne.-'^ History is
silent about Ihuitmal, the Aztec version of Samlah or Yumala,
save to tell that he had reigned for thirty yeai's, and that Quetzalcoatl was his successor. At Tollan the royal pontift" fixed his seat, making it " the abode of felicity, of luxury and abundance." Extending his peaceful sway far and wide, peace reigned
in all the land, and the blessings of agriculture turned the desert
into a garden. The Mexican historians love to tell of his markets
containing the produce of the whole earth, of the wondrous tissues woven in his factories, the gold and silver ware fashioned by his
smiths, the gems and mosaics, the inlaid tables, the marvellous
fans, and a thousand other objects that were so common as to be

thought little of in his day. He built four palaces of materials
so precious that the description of them rivals the dreams of fairyland, and beside them four temples, the first of which was called the Temple of Gold, the second of Turquoise and Emerald, the third of Shells, and the fourth of Alabaster. He founded a priesthood and established monastic colleges for their education. Of their ritual he Avas the author, and at the same time, as chief
pontiff, the faithful observer. Everywhere the long-haired priests in their black robes and capuchined heads, like those represented in the Scythian portraits from Kertch, w^ent about proclaiming the new laws, and bringing the people into the paths of peace and virtue, until the Golden Age and Saturnian Reign seemed once more to be realized. These priests celebrated the opening
of the day with instruments of music, and chanted divine songs
as they relieved each other in the temple \vatches. And the wise king, having established his religion and promulgated his laws,
gave his mind to literature and science in his palace, or " hanging
gardens like those of Semiraniis," writing the history of the early w^orld and the Tonalamatl or Book of the Sun, one of the
most ancient of astrological tteatises. Nor does Mexican history fail to note the mines that Pliny mentions in his brief record of
the Colchian Saulaces, or the pillars that, bearing his name, became
objects of adoration.-'^ For twenty years this happy state of things lasted, but vice
and cruel superstition were not dead. The great city of Teotihuacan, under its petty king, had refused to give up its human sacrifices, and Quetzalcoatl was not able to reduce it to obedience.
In other regions the severity of his laws, which seem to connect him with the Locrian Zaleucus, hindered the devil-worshippers
from openly practising their horrid rites and abominable revels, but secretly, under the veil of night, they continued to celebrate
the bloody mysteries of Tetzcatlipoca. The king of Culhuacan bore the name of this sanguinary deity, and, with the king of Otompan, he insisted that the sage of ToUan should restore the ancient rites. Entering Tollan itself and inciting the people with
superstitious fears, lie led them to sacrifice human victims within ear-shot of the wise king. Then Quetzalcoatl. unwilling to shed

blood, retired secretly, carrying away some of his literary treasures, and attended by such a concourse of people that Tollan seemed deserted. Reaching the mountains, he wept over the rebellious city that he had beautified. But new troubles arose, for the enemy pursued him, robbed him of his books, and compelled all artificers and useful persons in his train to return to Tollan. Then, with a few attendants, he gained the plain of Huitzilapan and founded Cholullan, the City of Exile. Ten years he reigned there, building a temple to Camaxtli and repeating on a humbler scale
the glories of Tollan. when Tetzcatlipoca, or one of his successors under the name of Huemac, came with a large army against him. The pontiff-king would not allow^ blood to be shed on his behalf. With four of his disciples he bade farewell to the people of Cholullan, and in a barge descended the rivers to the mouth of
the Coatzacualco, after which no .trace of him could be found. Then Huemac wreaked his vengeance on Cholullan, and brought all the neighbouring country under his sway. In endeavouring to glean history from the field of Mexican
tradition, names present the greatest difficulty, for it seems to have been a point of honour with the Aztec historians to elongate
royal names and to give them significance in a dialect which had
widely departed from ancient Hittite simplicity. The annalists were all astray in making the historical Quetzalcoatl a son of
Camaxtli, or Hamath, for five generations, represented by Rechab, Beeri, Bedad, Hadad and Rehoboth, intervened ; but they were right in representing him as the son of a warlike Amazonian queen whom they call Chimalman, an echo probably of Samlah. The great enemy of the fair god they call Tetzcatlipoca, Telpochtli, and Yaotzin, as well as Huemac. The name of Yaotzin, or the prince of evil, seems to be a travesty of Huetzin, who is said to have occupied the throne of Tollan in the time of Camaxtli, and whom Brasseur connects with Texcaltepocatl, a form of Tetzcatlipoca. Other names belonging to the same race are Yohuallatonac and Matlacxochitl. The line they set forth is evidently the Amalekite, for Huetzin is clearly Husham, and the Telpoch, Tezcaltepoc and Tetzcatlipoc forms are disguises of Eliphaz, like
the Greek Telephus. Teleboas and Delphi. The sacrifice of human victims has been already found to chai-acterize the Amalekites,

who were the chief enemies of the Beerothites, and their murdered Jobab became tlie Delphic Phcvbus, an entirely different being from the Teucrian Apollon. The name Eliphaz was so celebrated among them that it superseded the Temenite and Amalekite names in Assyrian days in the form Ellip, denoting the Albanians of the eastern Caucasus, ancestors of the Ossetes. Strabo describes the human sacrifices in vogue among the Albanians.-'^ Theleba and Thelbis in ancient Albania are Telpoch and Delphi-like versions of Eliphaz, and Dalphon, the son of Hainan, the Agagite or Amalekite, is another. ^^ Such a name also is that of Telephus, the son of Auge, whose mother married Teuthras of Mysia, and whose son Eurypyius led the Ceteans, or Hittites, at Troy. Daulis, near Delphi, was famous in the story of Tereus ; Pteras, another form of Patrae and Patara, built the first temple to Phoebus, which was situated over the Corycian cavern ; 01 en first prophesied there ; and Delphus was the son of Phoebus Apollo and Celaeno, the gi'and-daughter of Lycorus, who was the son of
Corycia. The Greek story of the infancy of Telephus is, that his mother Auge exposed him when born, on Mount Parthenius, where a hind that had lost her young came and suckled the child, so that the shepiierds who witnessed the act called him Telephus,
from elupho.s, a hind. The Welsh legends invert the incidents by
representing Elphin as the delivei-er of the infant bard Taliesin,
whom his )uother had sent to sea in a little ark or coracle, which
drifted into the fish weir that enriched the prince. In Pictish tradition Eliphaz is Alban, son of Isicus, and other Pictish royal names are Aleph, Elpin and Olfinecta.^" When, according to Greek story, Hercules was in Ligurian Gaul reforming the bloodthirsty inhabitants, his j)rogrcss was checked by the giants Alebion and Dercynus, whom he could not overcome until Jupiter showered stones upon them from heaven, which the Stony Plain between Marseilles and the mouths of the Rhone attests,^^ This seems to be a confusion of a Hittite tradition setting forth Amalek's oppo
sition to the introduction of a humane creed, with the story of

divine interposition in Joshua's war with the five kings of the Amorites, when " the Lord cast down fjreat stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah." ^^ The diflferent versions of Saul's history represent him as a great reformer, opposing the sanguinary creed that had been
adopted by at least three branches of the Hittite family, the Achashtarites, as evidenced in the history of Samlah, the Teme
nites, as seen in that of Jobab, and the Ethnanites, as illustrated
by that of Beor. The contest between the votaries of Quetzalcoatl and Tetzcatlipoca continues through the whole of Mexican history
;
in India a similar war between the Buddhists, who must have been recruited from the peace-loving tribes that followed the laws of Saul, and the murderous Sivaites, presents a companion picture ; it appears in the earlier part of Japanese history, and, indeed,
wherever the two Hittite creeds came into contact, the same struggle continued through the ages. The Welsh poets regarded
Coll as a foreigner and his sectaries as fit objects for persecution by the native hierarchy, who slaughtered men on their altars,
and they set him forth as the slayer of the two dusky birds of Gwenddolen, " which were in the daily habit of consuming two
persons for their dinner, and the like number for their supper,"
under the name of Gall Power.^^ He is also Ys Golan, whom Davies would identify with St. Columba, because he is called an
Irish scholar, although his black horse, dress and cap, are the
opposite of the white attire of the Culdees, and better suit the priest of Quetzalcoatl. The Druid Merddin sees him coming and
says to his flock : " Attend, little pig ! it is necessary to depart, to avoid the hunters of the water dM^ellings, if they should attempt to seize us, lest the persecution should come upon us and we should
be seen." In this case the tables are turned, and the laws of Saul are plainly in force against the treacherous lake-dwelling Gambulians, for Ys Golan threatens the Druid with the wrath of the king. In this contest Saul took an active part, not merely as a teacher, but as a warrior. The Homeric Achilles unworthily represents him, but the Indian Jaloka, who by his valour breaks the power of the Mlechhas, or Amalekites, and then conquers the

whole world, while, at the same time, he makes canals, builds temples and palaces, enriches his kingdom, introduces wise laws
and imperial state, cultivates piety, and offers his own body rather
than permit human sacrifice, fairly mirrors the grandest of the kings that reigned in Edom. The Persian Zaul is an Achilles and a Calchas combined to form a character like Ulysses, or Nestor,
and never reaches the dignity of the original. Pliny's brief
record of Saulaces tallies best with Jaloka. As for Quetzalcohuatl it may be said that his story, under Buddhist influences in India
and Japan, lost some of the virility of its prototype, but gained in mysticism and humanity, necessarily presenting a very one
sided picture of the great culture hero, who deserves to take rank among the chief benefactors of mankind. Whence did he derive his humane and elevated creed ? Did Egypt's civilization help him to it ? did it descend to him from the martyr Hamath ? or had the purer faith of the great Apophis, taught to the marvellous
boy by his prime minister Joseph, found its way into his mind and
heart, setting Saul also among the prophets ? We cannot tell. If the Japanese had left any particulars about their white-headed dairi Sirao'ano, we might be wiser ; and if we could be sure that the Kanyakubdja, which Jaloka subdued, and from whence he brouo-ht his institutions and laws, was the land of Egypt, then his casting down the heathen temples and setting up pillars like that of Bethel for the worship of him who dwells in the heavens, would enable us to rank Saul among the saints of ancient days, a worthy namesake of him who fell fighting on Gilboa as Israel's first king,
and of that warrior with spiritual weapons in a holier cause, the
great apostle of the Gentiles.^* In any case, all honour is due to Saul of Rehoboth by the river, whose fame has slumbered through
thousands of years. Jaloka was translated to the skies, and the Aztecs in Cortez's
time still looked for the return of Quetzalcoatl, but " Saul died,
and Baalhanan, the son of Achbor, reigned in his stead." The nauic of Baalhanan at first sight is purely Semitic, being the same
as Hannibal, Baal's favour. There is reason to think that thus early a desire to extend the worship of Bel had led the families
of Achashtari and Ethnan, his chief votaries, to confer upon him
»* Titaingh, Annales, 29 ; Raja Taranjfini, lib. i. si. 117.



THE KINGS THAT REIGNED IN EDOM. 271
the Semitic name Baal, for in the Hebrew record he is always spoken of as Baal and Baal Peor. They were successful in this
attempt to denationalize their deity, for, besides the Midianites, the Semitic speaking Moabites and Amorites adopted his worship,
and some of the latter installed him in the highest place in the Phoenician pantheon. In the name Baalchanan, the title of the god is Semitic, but the following chanan is an ancient form of the Basque gan, to, at, pertaining to, ganako, towards, ganatcea, to attract, and of the Japanese kanai, to agree, be in harmony with kan, admiration, kanji, to admire, esteem. Thus Baalchanan
really means, the lover or follower of Baal, and indicates that the
line to which he belonged was one that had accepted the bloodthirsty and licentious rites of that god, and that stood in mortal opposition to the purer faith of Saul and his ancestor"" Hadad.
There is no difficulty in determining what that line was,for a glance
at the classical atlas furnishes the data. In Albania the traces
of Baalhanan are not very distinct in Abliana and the Alazonus, but in Asia Minor Paphlagonia reproduces his name, and its dis
tricts Blaene, Domanitis and Timonitis, exhibit his relation to the family of Temeni. Even in Britain the Voluntii dwelt with the Damnii Albani. Now, in the history of Husham of the land of Temeni, there appeared a certain Pelegon, or Polyxenus, his grandson, whom the Volsung story celebrates, and who was there declared to be one of the kinos who reio-ned in Edom. He is Baalhanan, the son of Achbor, or Gachbor. The materials which tradition furnishes for constructing in outline the history of father and son are so numerous, that only a small portion of them can
be employed in this sketch.
First of all there is monumental evidence for the existence of Achbor, or Gachbor. In the time of Sennacherib, Akupardu was a town of lUipi, or Albania, and the king of that country was Ispabara.^^ It seems strange that the Temenites should have retained the original name for the city, and have much modified it to denote a royal personage, for Akupar and Ispabar are forms
of the same word. Going back to the early history of Babylonia,
we find a tantalizing fragment, yet valuable, which contains these

words : " Isbibarra, king of Karrak." ^'^ An old Babylonian list ^ives a king Iskipal, l)Ut at present nothing can be made of his connections. Knowing that Ispabara was a Temenite or Albanian name, and that Karrak denotes the Zerka of Moab, named after the Amalekite Zeracli, where Husham reigned, it is impossible to
avoid the conclusion that Isbiljarra, king of Karrak, is the same person as Achbor. While Saul of Rehoboth reigned over Gelialene and all Syria, he, as tributary king in Karrak, represents the Tetzcatlipoca of Culhuacan in the Mexican annals, so that Karrak and Culhuacan are thus identified, although Tetzcatlipoca cannot
designate Achbor save as the Eliphazite. During this time of subjection, Achbor, or some other subject prince who was a votary of Baal, took it upon him to unite the name of Saul with that of his deity. At Abu-Shahrein many inscriptions have been found of a great monarch, whose name has been provisionally read Zur
Sin. George Smith says that he is probabh' closely connected with Gamil-Sin from the great similarit}^ of their legends, and that he was deified after his death. The connection with Gamil
Sin, or Samlah, the nearness of the names Zur and Shahrein to Saul, and the statement that he was a Nipurite, or descendant of
Hepher, in Teutonic phraseology a Nifiung, all tend to establish the oneness of Zur and Saul. One of the inscriptions in which
his name appears reads : "Zur-sin, Bel the Nipurite blessed,
the leader of the house of Bel, the powerful king, king of Ur, King of the four regions, Hea the king,
his delight the of his delight he built."
Another is as follows : "Zur-sin the Nipurite Bel blessed,
the leader of the house of Bel, the powerful man, king of Ur,
King of the four regions." ^'' These cannot have been the work of the man whose whole life was spent in warring against the infamous worship of this Bel, but must have emanated from some friendly and probably subject

king, who, clinging to his own idolatry, yet had sense enough to appreciate the virtues of the reformer. They may have been
written by Achbor, but more likely by a descendant of Samlah, who continued the line of Hammurabi in Babylonia.
The Greek traditions repi'esent Pelegon, or Polyxenus, as a son of the daughter of Husham, and with this the Norse annals and legends agree. In the history of Ramus, the son of Sigmund and Hilda is Sigar, and his daughter Signe is the wife of Hagbart;
but, in the Volsung and Niebelunoren sagen, Sieo-fried, or Sicfurd,
is the son of Sigmund, and marries a sister of the Niflung Gunther. In other legends, however, the heroine whom Siegfried, or his representative, marries, is Sigrun, the daughter of Hogni, or Hilda, the daughter of Hagen, and even as Kriemhild she is made Hagen's niece. It is more than doubtful that Achbor was a Hittite. Esarhaddon conquered Akbaru, king of the Arabian Dupiati, and Kitsu, king of Kaldili, ruling over allied tribes. The name Kaldili is a form of Gilead, which denoted a region beyond Jordan long before the grandson of Manasseh bore it. Gilead, a
purely Celtic word, is also the original of Galatia in Asia Minor,
of Calydon in Grecian ^Etolia, and of the classical appellations
Galatae and Celtae. The Gileadites were a branch of the Midianites, but their history must be left for another treatise. The sons or near descendants of the Midianite Gilead were Peresh and Sheresh ; those of Peresh were Ulam and Rakem ; and the son of Rakem was Bedan.^^ The first of their line who appears in the early Babylonian lists is Ulam, who adds to his name that of his father Peresh, calling himself Ulam Buryas.^^ When the name Ulam occurs again in the list, it is in the form Ulam Girbat, who heads a dynasty containing as the third in succession Meli Sumu, or in Assyrian, Amil Sukamuna. He is followed by Meli Sibarru. Lower down in the list are three names compounded with Bur3-as, showing the connection of the dynasty with that in which Ulam Buryas appears, occupying the fourth place after Hammurabi.'"' Here then we have the Median dynasty of Berosus. So far the name of Bedan has not been found, but in an inscription

discovered by George Smith at Koyunjik, a king Agukakrimi, who traces his descent from Sugamuna, calls himself king of Padan Alman, of the Guti, the Saklaati, and of the four regions.*^ Asshurnazirpal connects the Ulmanyans, who represent the Alman in later history, with Zimira, a trace of the Midianite Zimran, and Shalmanezer unites them with the Sirisians, descended from Sheresh, the uncle of Ulam>- But the name Padan acquired celebrity in more recent times as that of the Patinians, often mentioned by the Assyrian conquerors. One of their kings was Sapalulme, a name which Professor Sayce has compared with that of Seplul, king of the Hittites, with whom the Egyptian Rameses I. made a treaty of peace.'*^ From the similarity of the two names
Professor Saj^ce was led to class the Patinians as a Hittite people. It is to be remembered that Seplul and Sapalulme are an Egyptian and an Assyrian version of a foreign name. Also the latter woi-d is compound like Ulam Buryas, adding the ancestral Ulam to Sapal, as Sapal Ulme. In Celtic history Ulam is well known as Ollamh, denoting a family descended from the Nemedians, Numidiaus, or Midianites, so famous for its learning that the name became the title for a scholar.^* With this family the Temenite Husham became connected by marriage. The Norse genealogies contain the elements of the Kenite, but somewhat confusedly arranged. Their Sigmund is the Sugamuna, or Amil Sukamuna, of the Babylonian record, and he is the Greek Sicyon and Kenite Chusham. In one place he is made the liusband of Hilda, daughter of Griotgard, a name which the romancers amplified into Brynhild and Kriemhild. But elsewhere his wife
is Hjordis, and she is the daughter of Eilimer, son of Hialm Tiere,
king of Cimbria. Skiold, another Cimbrian king, represents the
Saklaati of the Koyunjik inscription, the Scythic Scoloti of Herodotus, whose name Dr. Donaldson supposes to be Asa Galatae.*^ Thus the Gileadite line of Ulam Bui-yas appears to be Cymric, or Sumerian ; in other words, to descend from Zimran, the eldest son of Abraham and Keturah. With this family the Hittite line of

Temeni, or Ainalek, united in the person of Husham, who married a daughter of IJlam and sister of Bedan.'*^ This Hjordis is the
Medea of the Greeks, who Avas no daughter of ^Eetes of Colchis, fairly identified with Hadad, the son of Bedad, but a granddaughter of Peresh the Gileadite, whom, as Perses, the Greeks made a brother of ^etes and the usurper of his kingdom. From her descended that Polyxenus, who is Baalchanan, the son of Achbor. The question to be settled is, was Achbor the son of Husham and the daughter of Ulam, or was he the Midianite husband of their daughter. Now, Sigurd Fijfnisbane is called the son of Sigmund and Hjordis, and their daughter was Aslauga.
He is also called Sigvard, a word plainly identical with Gachbor.
In another Norse list Sio-ar is the son of Sio;mund and Hilda, and
Siofar's daughter, Signe, is the wife of Hagbart, who even better sets forth the Kenite Gachbor. The intervening Sigar seems to be a myth. The Greek genealogists make Pelegon the son of a daughter of Acessamenus, and Polyxenus, the son of a daughter of Augeas. Lamedon again married Xeuxippe, the daughter of Sicyon, and Laomedon, son of Ilus, married Strymo, daughter of Scamander, which is just the Norse name Sigmund, or Sigmunder. The latter form appears in Ramus. The explanation of Lamedon and Laomedon must be found in an ancient Ulam Bedan, although the analogy of Ulam Buryas would lead one to expect Bedan Ulam, or Padan Alman. If the Greeks received the name from the Cymri, or from a Semitic people, equally preposing the nominative to the genitive, Bedan Ulam would be the form, answering in part to Bodonhely in Hungary, an ancient Celtic habitat ; but if, as seems most probable, they received it from the Hittites, who postpone the nominative, the form would be Ulam Bedan, and this through Lampedon would become Lamedon and Laomedon. The two names figure largely in Greek mythology as Lampus and Phaethon, the steeds of Eosphoros or the dawn, Lampetia and Phaethusa, daughters of Helius and sisters of Phaethon ; but
these are intangible personages. Homer knew Phaethon, or Bedan, as Phidon, whom he calls king of Thesprotia.^'^ The Thesprotians were a very ancient

276 THE HITTITES.
people, who originally possessed the oracle of Dodona in Epirus. They were also called Tomuri from Mount Tomarus, which they inhabited. Pindar, appreciating their sacred character as interpreters of the gods, nevertheless speaks disrespectfully of these Cymric druids, calling them men with unwashed feet who made their bed on the ground.*^ Under the Dodonean oaks, sacred to Druidism, these Zimrites prophesied, until the Molotti, or Molossi, superseded them. Now, whence came the Thesprotian name to connect so intimately with the Tomuri, who are Sumerians and Zimrites, and their king Bedan ? Eosper, Hesper, Thesper, are forms of Gachbor, or Achbor, and the Molossi, who superseded his family, are the Amalekites. This seems to place Achbor in the line of Zimran and Gilead. Pausanias says that he searched dili
gently in order to lind some record of a Polycaon, but found little more than that a person of this name was the son of Butes. If this Polycaon, like Pelegon and Polyxenus, represent Baalchanan,
the reference would place him in the line of Bedan. Again, all the names circle about Laomedon and his son Priam, for Lampus and Clytius are sons of the former, while Priam has a son Echephron and a daughter Polyxena. Another Echephron was the son of a nameless Hercules, and Psophis, the daughter of Eryx, the son of Butes. Here Eryx represents Rakem, not the son, but the uncle of Bedan. But Oxiporus, who better retains the name of the father of Baalhanan, belongs to the line of Phaethon, who, through Tithonus, descends from Laomedon. As Cephalus he is made the father of Phaethon, to whom Helius and Clymenus are also given for fathers, such is the disorder in which the genealogies are found. In the ancient British annals, where, if of Cymric birth, Achbor should be found, he appears as Caswallon, Cassibelanus, Cadwallader, and his son Baalchanan, dropping the first part of the name, is Conan.*-' They are everywhere conjoined,
but Caswallon, son of Heli, is the Cymric hero, while Conan is the offspring of a foreign marriage. Thus in Merlin's famous prophecy these words occur : " Cadwallader shall call upon Conan
and take Albania into alliance. Then shall tiiere be a slaughter of
foreigners ; then shall the rivers run with blood. Then shall

THE KINGS THAT REIGNED IN EDOM. 277
break forth the fountains of Armorica, and they shall be crowned with the diadem of Brutus. Cambria shall be filled with joy ; and the oaks of Cornwall shall flourish." ^^ In this passage Conan, the son of Caswallon, or Cadwallader, is made to unite the Albans and the Cyrari, or, to go back to ancient nomenclature, the Amalekites and the Sumerians. Persian history has little to say of Achbor, but calls him by a name so similar to the British one that
it suggests a relationship of the two peoples, which the Sumerian names Peresh and Ulam strongly favour. That name is Goshpul Dandan, who ruled over Chin, but. making his submission, was highly esteemed by Feridun.-^^ In some genealogies Feridun, who is the Kenite Ardon, des
cendant of Urukh and Jerigoth, is called the son of Abtin of
Farshad. This impossibility, for Abtin, son of Farshad, is Bedan, grandson of Peresh.. may be explained by the presence of Bedan among the descendants of Ardon, through the marriage of one of his ancestors to a daughter of that monarch. The alliance is attested by the presence of the two names in one genealogy in the book of Judges. There Abdon, the son of Hillel, whom Samuel calls Bedan, is said to have been a Pirathonite, and to have been buried in Pirathon in the mount of the Amalekites.^The Kaldai, who were the leading tribe among the Accadians, moved northward, and gave their ancestral name to the Armenians,
whose chief god was Khaldi, but the Kaldani to this day constitute part of the population of Kurdistan, and side by side with them are the Kurdish Bottani. This places them in relation with
the Zerethites, Cherethites, or Dardanians, among whom Ardon occupied a prominent place, both as the Persian Feridun and the Indian Duryodhana. Strabo confirms this by saying that the Bottiaei of Macedonia came from Crete under the leadership of Botton, for Crete simply means the abode of the Cherethites, with whom the line of Bedan was allied. He also mentions a later Baton who was in command of the Brenci, Peirustae, and other
Pannonian or Celtic tribes, who dwelt in that Illyria in which
the Dardanii made their underground dwellinofs.^^ In British

story Ceredig, or Caradoc, preserved the name of the Zerethite' ancestor, between whose descendants and the Cyuiri there had long reigned peace and intimate friendship. He is often invoked in the Bardic measures as the strong arm of tlie Cymri. Even in Mexico the memorj' of this union was retained, if indeed it did not continue, for the Toltecs, whose name presents the Aztec form of Zereth, found the Ohnecs in the land and united with them. These Olmecs, whose kingdom was at Potonchan, were the posterity of Ulam, the father of Bedan.^* In the Greek story of Phaethon, who disputed the empire with the great Epaphus, the occurrence of the Eridanus, into which river he fell and was drowned, is but a reminiscence of his Zerethite alliance, for the Eridanus, or Jordan, was the river of Ardon. The Greek record fails to give the full Dardanian line 'of monarchs, because the genealogists confounded Ardon, the son or grandson of Urukh and descendant of Asareel, with the ancestral Dardanus or Zereth who named Zartlian. Laomcdon was no Trojan, save by marriage, and his father, the second IIus, was really Ulam who begins the Cymro-Dardanian dynasty. To this dynasty Achbor belonged, for his descendants, the Caspiri of India, dwelt on the Jelum, and
those nearer to the original seat, known as Saspires, occupied
part of Media, the land of the Midianites. The Raja Tarangini represented Jaloka or Saul as the enemy of the Mlechhas and the conqueror of Kanyakubdja. It also sets him forth as the oppressor of the wandering Bauddhas, a people not to be confounded with the later Buddhists. The goddess
Kritya, a personification of the Zerethites, interceded with him on behalf of these Bedauites, being the woman who had asked him for human flesh. Jaloka was followed by a Damodara, who, Melchizedek like, has neither ancestors nor posterity assigned him, and then the stranger kings of Turuchka race, Huchka, Djuchka, and Kanichka, who built Djuchkapui'a, came on the scene. . During their reign Cashmere was in the hands of the Bauddhas, " whose strength increased by their wandering life."^^ The succeeding king was Nagardjuna, who was himself of the Bauddha race and protected these scourges of the land that
" B. de Bourbourg, i. 151, seq. ^ Raja Tarangini, lib. i. si. 171.



THE KINGS THAT REIGNED IN EDOM. 279
corrupted the morals of the people and brought upon them the vengeance of heaven. The Tibetans say that he was born in the country of Beta and was the first Buddhist, and according to the Mongols he reduced to writing the doctrines of Sakyamuni.^^ This is important information. It is doubtful that Turuchka denotes the Zerethites and that the city name Djuchkapura is Achbor. But we have the fact of a race persecuted by Saul gaining the upper hand in the time of Nagardjuna, who, though of this Beta or Bauddha land and race, yet reinstituted the creed of Husham or Sugarauna. In the Mahabharata he is known as Arjuna, and his Zerethite connection is set forth in the statement that he w^as the son of Kritavirya. His subjects, the Haihayas, are the Hushamites much disguised. There was another Arjuna, brother of Yudisthira, who seems to have been a creation of the
poet's imagination, and to whom are ascribed many attributes of
the historical character. Thus he is called Delbhi and Phalguna,
names which are foreign to the Beerothite family, while the first
of them illustrates his Delphic, Albanian, or Amalekite descent; and the second restores his Kenite name Baalchanan. His father Achbor, as in the Greek story, has no mention. Arjuna w^as a giant with a thousand arms, who became lord of the seven dvipas or abodes of men. In his aerial car of gold whose course was
irresistible, "he trod down gods, yakshas, rishis, and oppressed all creatures." Going to Kanyakubdja, he entered the abode of King Jamadagni, whose wife Satyavati respectfully received him; "but
he I'equited this honour by carrying away forcibly the calf of the
sage's sacrificial cow, and breakino- down his loftv trees." Thereupon Parasu Rama, the son of Jamadagni, tilled with indignation, attacked Arjuna and cut off his hundred arms. " Arjuna's sons in return slew the peaceful sage Jamadagni in the absence of Parasu Rama." Whereupon the champion of Kanyakubdja killed Arjuna's sons and their followers, and " twenty-one times swept away all the Kshattriyas from the earth, and formed five lakes of blood in Samantapanchaka." ^" Pococke has shown that Parasu Rama combines the names of the Greek Perseus and the Egyptian
56 Troyer, Raja Tarangmi, tome ii. 425. 57 Muir, Sanscrit Texts.



280 THE HITTITES.
Ranieses.^^ He is undoubtedly right in this double identification, but the history of Egyptian and Hittite warfare must wait until we have considered the story of these warriors in the land of Egypt. It is evident from this Indian legend that Baalchanan was lord of a great empire in Syria, and that, emulating the warlike achievements of Saul, he measured his strength with the Pharaohs. His people also are thus well identified with the Kshattriyas or warrior caste of India, the Dioscurian Castoridae of the Greeks, a name which the superior dignity of the Achashtari father of two tribes had imposed on all the children of Heth.
In other versions of the reign of Baalhanan he is called Harischandra and Jarashandha, which are lengthened forms of Arjuna. Out of these names grew the Greek Alexander, as applied to Paris son of Priam, and the Persian Iscander, whose story has been mixed up with that of the conquering Macedonian. One favourable account of Harischandra makes him the son of Satyavrata or Trisanku, who had been disinherited by his father for carrying oft" the wife of one of his citizens. The name Satyavrata is a feeble echo of Gachbor. When Harischandra began to be lifted up with pride because of his wealth and the glory of his reign, and dared to bandy words with the Brahman Visvamitra, that insulted sage required him, being a Kshattriya, to bestow gifts upon him as a Brahman, which, in plain English, means that he conquered him and compelled him to pay tribute. Then follows what Dr. Muir calls one of the most touching
stories in Indian literature. The relentless Visvamitra takes from his opponent, now humbled in the dust, his wealth and his empire. He strips him of his ornaments, bids him clothe himself with the bark of trees, and sends him forth from the kingdom with his queen and son. The tale relates the agonies endured by Harischandra, as, pursued by his Brahman enemy, he is compelled to
sell his wife, his son, and lastly himself, into slavery, to satisfy his demands. Sent by his cruel master, a low-born Chandala, to steal grave-clothes in a cemetery, he there meets his wife, who has come to bury her dead son. A funeral pile is erected to
burn the boy's body, and the parents are preparing to cast thera

selves upon it and so end their miseries, when Dharma, who had transformed himself into the Chandala, arrives accompanied by the other gods and takes the little company to heaven. The Buddhists have a similar story of Prince Wessantara, son of Sanda, king of Jayatura, whose soul in transmigration became that of Gautama Budha.^^ A synchronism with the record of Arjuna is found in another legend already referred to, in which Sunahsepa is the vicarious victim for Rohita, the son of Harischandra, and in which Jamadagni, whom the sons of Arjuna slew, is represented as
assisting at the intended sacrifice. Very different is the account of Jarashandha. He is regarded as historical, and a massive stone foundation at Kusagarapura, supposed to be the ancient Rajagriha, is still pointed out as
Javasandli-ki-haithalx, the throne of Jarasandha. Yet he is the same person as Harischandra, his son Lahadeva answering to Rohita or Rohitasva, the son of that unhappy monarch, king of Rajagriha, the capital of Magadha; the Kurus or Kauravas were
his protectors, and this identification with the family to which Duryodhana belonged has caused the Indian poets to import into his story Yudisthira, Krishna, and the whole Pandu famil y who long before warred with that Zerethite and his Midianite allies. Jarashandha was a great conqueror. He drove the Bojas to the west and the Matsyas to the south. He held in subjection Vacradanta, king of Carusha, the prince of the Yavanas, Bhagadatta, kino- of the south and west, the kings of Banga and Pundra, of the Surasenas, Bhadracaras, Bodhas, Salwas, Pannaras, Susthalas, Mucutas, Pulindas, Salwayanas, Cuntyas, Panchalas, and Cosalas. But that which fixes his era is his supremacy over
a first named and principal vassal, Sisupula, king of the Chedi. A battle was fought between Jarashandha and the impossible Krishna, for he was long dead, on the Jumna, in which Bala Rama, who is really Parasu Rama, drove Hamsa, an ally of the kins of Mao*adha, into the river in which he was drowned, while
another prince, Dimbica, fell in the contest. At last the defunct Pandus came upon the scene, surprised and killed Jarashandha ; but the Kurus established Kama as his successor on the throne. In all of these names Ar-juna, Haris-chandra, Jara-shandha, the

initial Baal of Baal-chanan's name is replaced by an equivalent term for deity. So in Albania, that land which pre-eminently should exhibit in its geographical nomenclature the names of the Amalekite family, Baalchanan is represented by the river Alazonus or Abas. After the Paphlagonians, Homer mentions " Hodius and Epistrophus, who led the Halizones from Alybe afar where there are mines of silver."^° Herodotus places the Alazonians among the European .Scyths.°^ But to return to Jarashandha. His chief vassal was Sisupula, king of the Chedi. This is unmistakably Seplul, king of the Hittites, with whom Rameses the First made a treaty of peace.^^ The Indian scriptures also mention a Sisupula, who was the greatest enemy of the god Vishnu, and who was intimately connected with another of his great enemies, Virochana, whose name is a version of Baalchanan. Before Bali, the son of Virochana, who had terrified the gods, Vishnu appeared as the dwarf Hari, asking the Asura for as much ground as he could cover with three steps. This modest request being granted, Vishnu assumed his original form, and in three giant strides took possession of all kingdoms. The four names Sisupula, Sisupala, Seplul, and Sapal-ulme of the Patinians, represent Gachbor, whom Mirkhond calls Goshpul, and Firdusi, who makes him a son of Gavah the blacksmith that gained
Feridun the kingdom, calls Shahpui'. As a foreigner, his lordship over the Hittite tribes can only have been through his son Baalchanan.

CHAPTER VI.
The Kings that Reigned in Edom (Continued).
It must already be evident that the characters of Homer's great poem belong to the period of these kings. The actual genealogy of his Trojan monarchs tallies marvellously with that of the Zerethites as given by the Kenite scribes. The Indian
Kurus or Kritas are these same Zerethites, called by the Greeks Dardanians from their towns Zarthan and Zaretaan. These Zerethites were brave warriors, true Curates, the Cherethites of David's army in later days. They are spoken of on Egyptian monuments as the Shardana, being sometimes represented as mercenaries in the pay of the Pharaohs, at others as their bitter enemies.^ But they had a kingdom of their own in the heart of the Hittite settlement east of the Dead Sea, which they had carved out from among their brethren with their good swords. Its centre apparently was Zareth-Shachar, situated near the Dead Sea, on the river Nahaliel, which honoured Jehaleleel or Helel, son of Shachar. But their dominion must have extended to the west of the Dead Sea, including the land of Ziph and that famous city Kirjath Arba, where the Tsocharite Ephron once dwelt. Northward they made the Jordan their river, named after their own
Ardon, giving to its tributary, the Cherith, their tribal name, and erecting cities called Zartan, Zartanah, and Zaretaan, to guard its passages. Pushing southward below the Arnon, they gave their name to Zered, afterwards a station in the homeward journej'ings
of Israel. Round about them were their friends and allies, the
Midianites. Nor are we to suppose that all the Dardanian families
were within the borders of Palestine, for the Cherethites, who served,' and fought against, Egypt, were a seafaring people south of the Philistine coast, by whom perhaps Crete had already been discovered and named, and others of them doubtless kept the

highways of the Euphrates and Tigris, where their ancestors had made their first conquests. This was the old Trojan Hne ; Zereth, its founder Dardanus, and the nameless Shachar, and unhappy Jehaleleel of the everlasting Lelo, the Ilus who gave name to Ilium ; then the three sons, Ziph, Tiria, and Asareel, and Ziphah
the sister's son, Ganub, who were Capys, Tros, Assaracus, and Ganymede, in classical story. Of Assaracus came Hur, the second Arioch of Ellasar, the Urukh of the monuments, whom as Erichthonius the Greeks misplaced, and from him in the first or second generation descended Jesher, Shobab and Ardon, the Kurns of the Mahabharata, with whom beg^an the great war. Allied with the Midianites, they came to the northern borders of Moab when Husham was king in Edom, and established themselves in ZarethShachar and Elealeh. For safety's sake the Temenite monarch of Gebalene was forced to take a Midianite wife in marriage, but, as it brought him no respite, he seems to have tired of his bargain. One brave man stemmed the invading tide that swelled day by day, until he seemed to stand alone with his people against the Midianites and almost all the other Hittite tribes. This was Hadad, the son of Bedad. Advancing into the heart of the enem}^ for Kuru-kshetra, where the great battle between Kurus and Pandus was fought, is no other place than the country about Zareth-Shachar, their stronghold, he smote Midian in that field of Moab, and Ardon, the chief though last mentioned of the Zerethite brethren, whom the Indian epic knows as Duryodhana, fell by the hand of one of Hadad's allies, an unknown Bhima.The Greeks lost sight of Ardon, and after Tros, whom they made the son of Erichthonius, placed Ilus the second. He it was that built a second Ilium, the citadel of which was Pergamus. This
citadel's name reveals a secret which the Babylonian lists have also laid bare in part. The second Ilus was no Dardanian, but Ulam Buryas, or Ulam the son of Peresh, a Gileadite or Caledonian Midianite, who by his own marriage or that of his father, succeeded the vanquished Kurus in the sovereignty of northern Moab. And Pergamus, the citadel, he named in fraternal atfection
after his l)rother Rakcm, for the Hebrew word r((k(im, to varie
gate, embroider, is the Gaelic breacaim, and this Rakem is no less

a person than Breogan, the ancestor of the British Brigantes,
who dwelt side by side in Yorkshire with their relatives of the
senior line that preserved, as Parisii, the name of Peresh.^ After Ilus came Laomedon, or Ulam's son Bedan, who married a dauofhter of the Temenite Husham. Although Bedan was a Midianite, his unhappy story is so linked with that of the Hittites as to claim a passing notice. Bedan as Laomedon or Ulam-Bedan married a daughter of Scamander, Sigmund, Sugainuna, the Temenite Chusham, and thus allied himself with the family of Amalek, whose capital was Zerka, or Karrak, in the south. According to Pausanias this was Xeuxippe, called a daughter of Sicyon; according to other writers, Strymo, daughter of Scamander ; but her parentage is well attested by the name of her daughter Hesione, which agrees with Husham. Laomedon fortified the walls of Tro}' with the aid of some tribes, figuratively designated by the names of Apollon and
Poseidon, but refused to pay them the sum stipulated for the work. Thereupon Apollon sent a pestilence, and Poseidon a sea monster, which ravaged the Dardanian coasts. An oracle was consulted, probably the Delphic, for near Kerak the Jebel el Tarfuyeh would be a very suitable place for the Temenites to erect a sanctuary, and its response commanded that Hesione should be given to the monster. But while Laomedon was making the sacrifice, or, as the legend has it, had chained Hesione to the rocks on the sea shore, Hercules, a convenient name for
any hero, passed that way and oflfered to deliver her, on condition that Laomedon would give him a stud of horses. The condition was accepted, and Hercules killed the dragon, but, anxiety being now removed, the perfidious king of Troy declined to keep his promise, and Hercules sailed away vowing vengeance. After he had completed his time of servitude with Omphale, widow of Tmolus, which seems to identify him with Saul of Rehoboth, Hercules collected an army and made war on Laomedon, which resulted in the death of the Trojan monarch and all his sons, with the exception of Podarces or Priam. A story similar to that of
2 There seem to have been two nations of Brigantes, the one Celtic, descended from this Regem as Breogan ; the other, Iberian, tracing its descent from the Zerethite Berigah. Those in Yorkshire were largely Iberic.



286 THE HITTITES.
Hesione is told of Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus, king of Joppa, and Cassiope or Cassiepea, the hero in this case being Perseus, the Indian Parasu Rama. Thus was the unhappy Phaethon hurled from his seat to fall into the Eridanus. Of his son or cousin Achbor the Trojan genealogists made no record. The Indian writers make Bali the son of Virochana, or of Sutapas, the son of Phena, and Sutapas may be a corruption of Sutapal, the British Cadwal. In the Harivansa it is said that Sisupala of Chedi was a son of Damagosha, and that he and Jarashandha both descended from Vasu, but, although this statement is valuable as uniting the Indian representatives of Achbor and Baalchanan in the same family, it otherwise sheds little light
upon their ancestry.* Yet Sisupala, as Isbibara, king of Karrak, whither, according to the Indian legend of Harischandra, he seems to have fled in disgrace, must have married into his mother's family and have gained a new lien upon Amalekite sovereignty, although holdino: the throne of Karrak in trust for his son Baalchanan, who was also to be recognized as the lawful king of Zareth-Shachar. This Baalhanan, contracted though the Greek name may be, can be no other than the Trojan Priam, the father of a sou Echephron and a daughter Polyxena. Where was his Ilium or Troja ? That it was in the land of Moab IS certain, as is its identity with the Indian Raja Griha. It must also have been situated not far from Zareth-Shachar, now called Sara, the chief abode of the Zerethites or Dardanians, and thus between the Nahaliel or Zerka Main and the Arnon. ZarethShachar may represent the original Dardania of the Homeric story. The Indian and Greek epics associate Raja Griha and Ilium with hot springs. Homer, describing the flight of Hector from Achilles, tells how they passed the pleasure ground and waving fig trees along the road by the walls of Ilium, reaching
the springs Callirhoe, where rises the eddying Scamander, one of which flows with warm water, so that steam as of fire ascends from it, but th(> other even in the heat of summer is cold as snow or ice.^ In January, 1807, Seetzen left the Arnon and made his way northward to look for the celebrated baths of Callirhoe,
* Harivansa, i. 494. 6 Iliad, xxii. 143, seq.



THE KINGS THAT REIGNED IN EDOM. 2b7
which Herod the Great visited when the hand of death was upon him, vainly hoping to find in them the fount of life. Along a rough, rocky path beset with precipices he journeyed, and came at last to the traces of springy land. " The land then began to be covered with sedge and stringy plants, some of them growing to the
height of thirty to forty feet, and testifying to the extraordinary influence of tlie tropical heat acting on a moist soil. In the wild deep gorges he also espied trunkless palms, willows, and tamarisks growing. Thicker and thicker these became as he advanced
northward, until he came to a spring of clear, cold and excellent water, which slaked the thirst caused by his simple breakfast of
bread and salt. Half an hour farther on he encountered a small brook, and still a quarter of an hour farther on, a larger one, which murmured delightfully as it ran onward, shadowed over by mimosfe, to the sea. His course led him on past brook alter brook, till he came to a place where the mountains, which had thus far followed the shore closely, receded, and left an amphi
theati'ical opening—a small fertile plain an hour long, a half hour broad, sown by the Aduan Beduins with wheat, barley and durra. Here he discovered a large brook, the water of which was hot.
This spring forms the outlet, his guides told him, of three springs a half hour's distance from the sea, two of which are so hot as to be unbearable to the hand. The Arabs said, besides, that there were ruins also there bearing the name Sara. Seetzen was
inclined to think that these indicate the site of the " ZarethShahar in the mount of the valley " mentioned in Joshua xiii. 19. In spite of the distance from the spring, the water at the mouth of the brook was so hot that it was disagreeable to wade through it. Some thirty date palms were standing there ; and in the wild luxuriance of the spot, traces could apparently be seen of
the site of the former Callirhoe and its gardens. Here was abundant room for the city."^ In the map of Moab drawn by Captain Warren and Professor Palmer in accordance with the most recent surveys, the hot springs are placed between the wellpreserved ruins of Attarus and the Zerka Mayn, and to the south of Attarus rise streams that flow southward into the Anion. -^

288 THE HITTITKS.
Probably at Attarus, farther removed from the sea than Zareth
Shachar, and m the vicinity of the celebrated hot .springs, the
Ilium of Priam reared its lofty walls, before which an adverse
host assembled for a long siege. It would be tedious to enumerate all the statements of writers which give to the Trojan war its true antiquity and connect it with Egypt, Phoenicia, and As.syria. Mr. Gladstone, in his Juventus Mundi, holds that the siege must
have been long before the year 1209 B. C, when Sidon was demolished by the Philistines, and Pliny says that Troy was taken in the reign of an Egyptian Rameses. ** M. Lenormant places the Dardanians of Troy among the allied Hittites who foucrht against Egypt.^ According to Guigniaut, the ^thiopis of
Actinus the Milesian associated the war of Troy with Ethiopia,
an ancient Greek name for Joppa in Philistia.^*^ Herodotus
received a version of the Trojan war from the Egyptian priests, and so did Dion Chrysostom, who made an oration upon it within the walls of the Mysian city. All that is now known of ancient history is utterly opposed to the existence of a state in the
western extremity of Asia Minor having relations with the great
empires of the east at so distant a period, for, so far down as the time of the Assyrian Assurbanipal, that part of the world was an unknown land. That monarch speaks of " Gyges, king of Lydia,
a district which is across the sea, of which the kings, my fathers,
had not heard speak of its name." ^^ The cause of the Trojan war was the carrying away, from the court of Menelaus, his wife Helen by Paris or Alexander, the son of Priam. She was the daughter of Tyndarus and sister of Castor and Pollux. In British story Helena is the daughter of Hoel and of Coel, the maid Gwyllion of the mysteries. Then Tyndarus, king of Lacedemon, is but another form of Hadadezer, like the Scythian Idanthyrsus, son of Saulius. As for Castor and Pollux, they have no more to do with the story than this, that the families of Achashtari and of Pelet the Achuzamite were probably allies of the Beerothite line to which Saul and Hadad belonged. The Mahabimrata, therefore, is the record of no one

war, but of dynastic strife continuing through several generations between Beerothites and Zerethites, or the Bharatas and the Kritas or Kurus. Helen again is the calf carried away from the house of the sage Jamadagni by the ravisher Arjuna, and the fair woman named Quetzalxochitl taken away from her husband Papantzin by the second Huemac. For this sin of Huemac's disasters fell upon his kingdom ; the wild Chichimecs or Zuzim invaded the land and laid siege to his great cit}^ Spite of heroic
efforts, Tollan fell, Quetzalxoc*hitl perished in the melee, and the empire of the Toltecs came to an end.^^ The name of the Toltec queen is worthy of note, for xochitl means a flower, and she is thus the flower of Quetzal. In the Welsh traditions she is Flur, the Blanchefleur of the story of Sir Tristrem, and the daughter of Mygnach Gorr, king of Brittany, who is Huail, Hoel, Ooel, Coll or Saul in another form. It is said that she had been carried off" by the Gaulish Murchan to give to Caesar, and that Caswallawn rescued her from him and thus brought the enmity of the Romans upon Britain. But Davies shows that in his expedition Caswallawn was accompanied by the British gods, who were hardly in existence in Csesar's day.^^ Conan, the son of Caswallon, also called Kynan, son of Clydno, to denote his Gileadite descent, was the second of the three great lovers of Britain, and cherished a fruitless passion for Morvyth, the daughter of Urien Eheged, but elsewhere he is called Kynan Meriadawc, and made the brother of Helen Luyddawg, who married Maxen Wledig.^* It is
interesting to find the Hebrew Baal represented m the Cymric legend as in Assyrian by Merodach. Their father was Eudav, like the Indian Sutapas, father of Virochana. The third great lover of Britain, who completes the series, was Trystan, the son of Tallwych, names hard to reconcile with the others, but he took from March, the son of Merchiawn, his wife Essylt Vyngwen, or Essylt of the fair tresses, once more the daughter of Saul as Cul vanawyd Prydain, whose Beerothite nationality is set forth in the name of Prydain, who was the son of Aedd the Great. His people were the Gododin or Ottadini who fought the great

battle of Cattraeth. Once more the ravisher is the Spanish giant Dinabuc, who carried off Helena, the daughter of Hoel of Brittany.
Helen, therefore, is an historical personage, well determined as the daughter of Saul of Rehoboth and the wife of Menelaus, Murchan, Maxen Wledig, March or Papantzin, being also in Indian story
under the protection of Jamadagni. There is no difficulty in deciding what person in the Kenite list answers to Menelaus, for Egypt furnishes the indications necessary. There, on the Mediterranean coast, between the western branch of the Nile and the Mareotic lake, on the shore of which Alexandria was afterwards built, was situated the Mene
laite nome, and in it was Canobus, so called, we are told, after the pilot of Menelaus, who died there. But Canobus or Canopus was in existence long before Menelaus, being a Hellenized version of Anubis, who in Hebrew is Anub or Ganub, the son of Goz, and, while an Egyptian god, at the same time a Pharaoh, Ouenephes of Manetho's first dynasty. He seems to have been the founder of the Xoite kingdom, which is generally placed in the Deltft, for the Xoite and Onuphite nomes were contiguous. It was a region of marsh and water broken land, affording a safe retreat from invasion, and to it the blind Anysis and the later Amyrtaeus fled from Ethiopian and Persian enemies.^^ As an original abode of lake dwellers, its inhabitants may compete with the descendants of Samlah of Masrekah for the honour of naming the marsh-loving Gambulians of Chaldea, for one of the heads of the Xoite or Onuphite favnily was Shemuel. The history of this family belongs to Egypt, but is intimately connected with
early Hittite tradition outside of that country. It will be remembered that the great Jehaleleel of the family of Zereth had a daughter Ziphah. She married Coz, the son of Amnion, in Egyptian, Chons, son of Amun and Maut, and her son was Anub or Ganub, the Egyptian Anubis, son of Nephthys. Accordingly, Ganub, as Ganymede in the Greek story, was reported to have been carried away by Tantalus to become the cup-bearer of the gods. Pindar, however, recognised Ganymede as a great Egyptian deity presiding over the Nile.^^ The Tantalus who is

THE KINGS THAT REIGNED IN EDOM. 291
charged with taking him away is really the same as Talus, the sou of OEuopiou, and he is the Tola or Tolag of the Kenite
record.^'' He had six sons, of whom Uzzi was the chief, the others being Rephaiah, Jeriel, Jahmai, Jibsam, and Shemuel. Uzzi or Guzzi is the Itys or Pelops whom Tantalus is said to have served up to the gods, and his son was Izrachiah or Atreus, son of Pelops. From Itzrachiah or Atreus came Michael, Obadiah, or Gobadiah, Joel, Ishiah, and Chamisha, and Michael is Menelaus, generally called the son of Atreus. In Michael, then, the different names of the injured husband, such as Murchan, March, Maxen, and Menelaus, are reconciled, and the story that the giant Dinabuc, a form of Anub, carried Helena, daughter of Hoel, to
Michael's Mount, finds confirmation. The name of Tristan's
father, namely, Tallwych, is that of Tolag, and Tristan is a dis
guised Izrachiah, so that the particulars of his story are altogether untrustworthy. The carrying away of Ganymede by Tantalus to Olympus, indicates that in the time of Tolag, the son of Anub, the Cozites separated from the Hittite family of Zereth, and continued that independent national existence which had been inaugurated by their great father, Amnion. It is also stated by the Greeks that the act of Paris in sailing away with Helen was but a reprisal for the abduction of Ganymede.^^ The descendants of Anub have a history of their own the wildest, most fantastic history that the world contains, for they are the Quiches of Guatemala, and their history is the Popol Vuh.^^ The Quiche language in which it is written may be called Turanian by careless philologists ; but, if the Khitan languages are Turanian, it is not. The particles and parts of speech which the Khitan languages postpone, it preposes, and its vocabulary is more Malay-Polynesian, more Semitic even than anything else, as well as its grammar. The Quiches or Kiches bear themselves the name of Coz ; their ancestral deity is Tanub, a form of Anub, and their original home, Tula, named after his son Tola. In pagan
times they preserved the rite of circumcision. As they represent
" 1 Chron. vii. 1. 18 See Banier, iv. 213. 19 Popol Vuh, Brasseur de Bourbourg.



292 THE HITTITES.
part of the Ammonite dispersion, so their neighbours in Yucatan the Mayas, whose kincrdom was Mayapan, and who worshipped Baklum Chaani, a western Chem or Chemosh, are fugitive Moabites speaking a dialect of the same language. Both of these peoples were tyrannized over by the Olmecs, who dwelt at Potonchan. These descendants of the Gileadite Ulam took forcibly from the Mayas and Quiches their wives and daughters, and so oppressed them that they were compelled to migrate to what seems to have been the country about the mouths of the Nile. In the Maya chronicles the Quiches are called the Tutul Xius, who dwelt in Chichen Itza and also made their home in Chacnabiton.-^
According to their own account, the chief rulers of the Quiches were Hunahpu, Cotuha, and Iztayul, who reflect Anub, Guzzi, and Izrachiah. To these the Maya chronicles add Hunaceel, a monarch in whose time great troubles took place. The Maya story of Can Ek, which unhappily does not contain the name of
the injured monarch, is that of Helen and Essylt. " The king of Chichen, about to be married, had, as was customary, sent the chief nobles of his court to the abode of his father-in-law to bring home his bride. The cortege returned to Chichen to the sound
of musical instruments, amid dancing and all kinds of rejoicing, escorting the young princess with great pomp, seated in a litter and surrounded by noble matrons charged to wait upon her. But this marriage was taking place against her liking, for she loved Can Ek, distinguished for his courage and fine appearance above all the nobles of Chichen, and who on his part had vowed inviolable affection. With her consent he formed the project of carryino- her oft". He assembled his vassals and posted them in a road
through which the procession had to pass. It was night ; the moment the convoy arrived, he fell unexpectedly upon it with
his little troop, dispersing without difficulty the lords and dames
and seizing the princess, with whom he fled to the sea shore. There a little fleet was waiting for him, in which he embarked
with the princess and his friends, making sail for the coast of ZiniVjacan, whence, by the neighbouring rivers of Bacalar, he
gained the interior of Peten."'^^ Now this Peten is the same as

Potonchan, the region of the hated Oluiecs. The following is the confused Maya account of the great war thatseemstohave followed thisaction: "In the eighth, ahau, the governorof Chichen Itza (city) was driven out on account of his plotting against Hunac Eel
;
and this happened to Chac Xib Chac of Chichen Itza, on account of his plotting against Hunac Eel, the governor of Mayapan, the fortress. Four score years and ten years, and it was the tenth year of the eighth ahau, that it was depopulated by Ah Zinteyut Chan with Tzuntecum and Taxcal and Pantemit, Xuchuuet and Ytzcuat and Kakaltecat : these were the names of the seven men of Mayapan. In this eighth ahau they went to the fortress of the ruler of Ulmil on account of his banquet to Ulil, ruler of Itzmal ; they were thirteen divisions of warriors when they were dispersed by Hunac Eel, in order that they might know what was to be given ; in the sixth a?tau it ended, one score years and fourteen." ^^ In the Popol Vuh and other Quiche documents the greatest historical event is the taking of Xibalba, a city that has been
identified with Palenque. Xibalba was the hated land, the very
hell of the Quiches, for they had suffered from its oppression. As it was a foundation of Votan, who came from Valum Votan, its rulers are well identified with the Olmecs of Potonchan, under whose tyranny the Quiches are also said to have groaned. Its fall is the theme of the Quiche epic. The Quiches had been victorious over Xibalba, but had lost their power, and the hated kingdom became strong again under its kings Huncame and Wucubcame, when the Quiche Exbalanque died. His brother, Hunahpu, remglined at Tula, and by his wife Xbakiyalo had two sons, Hunbatz and Hunchowen, whom he taught to be skilful warriors and magicians. After the death of Xbakiyalo, Hunahpu and his bachelor brother, Wucub Hunahpu, are represented as journeying towards Xibalba to play ball with its two kings and
their tributaries, who were Xiquiripat, Cuchumaquic, Ahalpuh, Ahalgana, Chamiabac, Chamiaholora, Ahalmez, Ahaltocob, Xic, Patan, and Oloman. Some of these names at once declare the Zerethite alliance ; Cuchum-aquic as Chusham, Ahalpuh as Eliphaz, Ahalgana as Ba-alchanan, Oloman as Ulam, and Patan
22 The Maya Chronicles, 102.



294 THE HITTITES.
as Bedan. This playing ball was ver}- deadly work, for it cost the two their lives. But in a supernatural way Xquic, the daughter of Cuchumaquic (or Chusham), one of the thii'teen princes of Xibalba, became by the dead Hunahpu the mother of Hunahpu and Exbaianque. Prior to their birth she left Xibalba and cast herself upon the protection of the mother and sons of the dead Hunahpu, who, however, treated her and her children harshly. But these children grew up, endowed with marvellous power and wisdom, every juggling feat ever performed by the mostaccomplishedof oriental wizards being imputed to them. They first showed their skill by changing their half brothers into monkeys, whose appearance was so grotesque that their grandmother Xmucane, though grieving over their transformation, was compelled to laugh at their grimaces, whereupon they- left in dudgeon and betook themselves to the woods. Then the wonderful children cultivated the ground, while, night after night, wild beasts came and destroyed their work. They set watch accordingly, and one night caught a mouse, which they were about to torture in revenge for the injuries committed, when, begging for life, it told them that agriculture was not for such as them ; let them take up the ball-play in which their father and uncle had fallen. The mouse probably denotes the Tsocharites, who dwelt in southern Palestine, on the coast of the Mediterranean, for already mice and rats have been found to relate to these Teucri, and the presence of Tohil or Zockill in the Quiche and Maya pantheons, with other facts, attest an alliance of the Tsocharites with these families. The lads, who remind one of the Epigoni returning to Thebes to avenge their fathers who had fallen in the first siege, hurled the ball towards Xibalba, after bidding farewell to their mother and grandmother. Dr. Tylor thinks he sees a connection between New and Old World legends in the incident recorded as accompanying their departure.-"^ They planted a cane of Indian corn in the middle of the house, which, if it withered, would denote that they had perished in their enterprise, and, if it flourished, that they were alive. Then once on their way, the creatures did their bidding ; the Xans, small stinging
gnats, were their spies, and the birds called Molay carried them

over the rivers. Shut up by the thirteen of Xibalba, who represent the thirteen regiments defeated by Hunaceel, in a place of darkness, they filled it with light. A game of ball took place next day and the brothers were victorious. Again enclosed in a house in which sharp knives of flint revolved, they by magic made them cease their deadly revolutions, and, when commanded to fill four vases with rare flowers in that place of horrors, they called in the aid of the ants Zanpopos, which, spite of the precautions of the royal guards, cut down the choicest blossoms in the garden of the kings and brought them to the prisoners. They then passed the ordeals of the house of ice, the house of tigers> and that of fire, but in the house of the bats Hunahpu lost his head, so that Exbalanque had to give him a new one. Then followed the most astounding prodigies. A funeral pyre was lit, and the brothers threw themselves upon it and were burnt to ashes. The joyous Xibalbans threw the ashes into the river, and five days after two youths of great beauty, but with fishes' tails, disported themselves in the stream and mocked the thirteen councillors. Then they appeared in the streets of the city as old men clothed in tatters, dancing wild dances, burning houses and restoring them, killing each other and coming to life again. Summoned before the princes, they came and repeated their miraculous juggleries, putting many people to death and reviving them. At length, wrought to a frenzy by the miracles, the kings Huncame and Wucubcame demanded to be thus killed and
restored. The brothers, after some hesitation, tore their hearts
from their breasts, cut ofl" their heads, and then refused to resur
rect the slain. Terror seized the court and the princes attempted to flee, but in vain ; all but one perished in the slaughter that ensued, and the Votanide empire of Xibalba came to an end. Such is the weird tale which the descendants of him whom the Greeks called Menelaus tell of his siege of the Cymro Zerethite
city near the banks of the Moabite river Nehaliel.^'* The story of Troy's overthrow includes the history of the last kins: that reigned in Edom, who was Hadar of Pau. His wife was Mehetabel, the daughter of Hatred, the daughter of Mezahab. The wife of Hadar was the daughter of the Egyptian queen

called Mytera on the monuments, in the Greek lists Nitocris, and in Greek legendary history Danae. The father of Hatred was Methosuphis, Menthesuphis, or Har-em-hebi, the golden Horus, the last of the Hycsos' line, but not the last of Hittite descent on an Egyptian throne. Hatred became the wife of Tahath the Second, generally known as Thothmes, and by this union the two chief kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt were united.-^ Hehetabel, the daughter of Tahath and Hatred, may be represented by the Egyptian Hautemva, who is said to have been the widow of Thothmes IV., and the mother of Amenophis III., named Hemnon. The confounding of Hadar, the husband of H ehetabel, and father or stepfather of Hemnon, with Itzrachiah, the father of Hichael, inasmuch as either would make a Greek Atreus, was probably the origin of the name Atridae applied to Agamemnon and Henelaus. The two alliances of the Beerothite family of Saul with Egypt, namely, the marriage of his daughter to Hichael of the Xoite kingdom, where Hetelis seems to be his memorial, and that of his son Hadar to Mehetabel, daughter of Thothmes II., were undertaken, it is clear, for the purpose of strengthening
that family for its contest with the might of the Zerethites and their numerous allies. The resemblance of fphe name Hadar to Hadad, and the fact that the Kenite list in Chronicles calls him by the latter name, together with the evidence already collected, that the history of the kings reigning in Edom is that of a continual struggle between the humane Beerothites and their
Amalekite and Zerethite enemies, would justify the placing of this last monarch in the line of Saul. But there is other evidence for so doing, and that is contained in an epic, less lofty in style
and briefer than some that have shed light on early Hittite
history, but well worthy the attention of the scholar. This epic is the Gododin of the Welsh bard, Aneurin.'-^" That there have been late Aneurins cannot be doubted, but the bard who wrote the Gododin, as a contemporary of the heroes whose deeds he relates, must be exceeding]}' ancient, and worthy of the mystery enshrouding his life. His poems have been tinkered by many hands, and, as they are explained by commentators, are often
^'' 1 Chron. vii. 20 ; Sharpf^'s Hi.story of Egypt, i. 46.

THE KINGS THAT REIGNED IN EDOM. 297
quite unintelligible, for they are made to relate to contests between the Britons and the Saxons, a people that have no real mention in the work, unless the Amalekite Chusham or Sugamuna's posterity can be called such. Aneurin is said to have been the son of Caw ab Geraint, lord of Cwm Cawlwyd, or the region of the Ottadini, or Gododini, in Northumberland.^^ Though himself a man of Gododin, or a Hadadite, he does not allow tribal prejudice to sway his judgment, but gives such meed of praise at times to enemies, that the commentators have frequently classed
these as allies of the Gododin. The Gododin then has been read as the story of a contest between the Cymri under Urien Rheged, and the Saxons under an unnamed leader, supposed to be Hengist, or Ida. At the great battle of Cattraeth five hundred thousand warriors met in conflict, and only three chieftains escaped slaughter on the side of the Cymri. Aneurin himself was taken prisoner, and, after lanp'uishinsf for some time in a loathsome dungeon, was released by Cenau, son of Llywarch. Now, if Aneurin was of the Gododin, he was no Cymro, but one of their bitterest foes. Cattraeth does not exist in Britain, but it answers to Zareth-Shachar and the Kuru-kshetra of the Bharatan war. The whole story of the war between Zereth and Beeroth, as told in all the narratives, is that of two warlike expeditions of the latter into the country of the former, the first of which was singularly disastrous to the Beerothite host, while in the second they gained a complete victory. This is very evident in the Quiche version which has just been considered. When Aneurin and the other bards who deal with this contest are read without reference to the history of the Saxon invasion, the same duality appears, a defeat to weep over and a conquest to make the heart glad. There is no word of Hengist in the original poems, but the makers of early British history introduce him and his slaughter of the Bi-itish chiefs to extplain the first expedition that ended in massacre. The great hero of the Gododin, and poems dealing with the same events, is
Eidiol, also called Eidol, Edol, and Eldol, who in the mysteries is always associated with Coll, Corr, or Saul, as Eiddilic Corr, or Gwyddeliu Corr. He is thus well identified with Hadar, who

298 THE HITTITES.
must have been a son or grandson of Saul of Rehoboth. The bard Cuhelyn tells of the first expedition and the cause of its overthrow. "Darkening was the sullen wrath of the wolf, naturally addicted to the law of steel, his accustomed rule of
decision. At the time when the brave Eidiol was presiding in the circle, a man eminently distinguished for wisdom: then the chief, having malice in his designs against the Britons, made wuth them a pretended compact. A proclamation was issued, inviting equal numbers to a conference at a banquet of mead." Now, it is to be observed that those who were with Eidiol were not Cymri, but " Brython," or Britons, Bharatas, Beerothites ; the Cymri never called themselves Britons, but applied that name to the Picts, of
whom were the Ottadini, or Gododin. This inimical blaidd, or wolf, who is either Achbor or Baalchanan, pretending a desire for' a peaceful conference, invited the warriors of Beeroth to a banquet of wine, as the kings of Xibalba received into that city the elder Hunahpu and his brother, only to slay them. Sweet strains arose from " the minister of Buddud, possessing the talent to rehearse the gentle song of praise, chanting his music like a golden hymn on the area of battle : but it was the battle of sudden assault, of the dreadful bursting shriek, the mysterious purpose of the chief, who exclaimed, with a curse, 'I will rtish
forth,' with an execration, ' I will command, I will bind the sovereign.' " Then followed the massacre, when Eidiol, according to tradition, seizing a stake near at hand, swept
it around him with terrific efifect, breaking heads, legs, and arms, and killing seventy men before he made good his escape from the scene of treachery. This was the disastrous battle of Cattraeth, that seems to have been fought when the Britons were intoxicated with the enemy's wine, and when the chiefs
were separated from their retinues. Eidiol's bard, who is called
the minister of Buddud, [links that hero with the ancestral Bedad.23 Aneurin says, concerning the feast, "Adorned with his wreath, the chief announced that upon his arrival, unattended by his host and in the presence of the maid, he would give the mead ;
biit he would strike the front of his shield if he heard the din of
2« The quotations are from the version of Davies in his British Druids.



THE KINGS THAT REIGNED IN EDOM. 299
war, and to those whom he pursued he would give no quarter. He had devised a better stratagem. Here his party did not shrink, though they had fled before the army of Gododin. The water-dweller boldly invites us to a mixed assembly where neither spear nor shield was to be admitted The haughty chief excludes men of a humble station The man of Gododin, upon his return before the tents of Madawc, has reported but one man in a hundred who escaped from the hand of the water-dweller," Again he says, " The heroes who went to Cattraeth were renowned. Three and three score and three hundred were they, wearing gold chains. Of those who hastened to the excess of liquor, three only escaped from the confident
stabbing. The man of Gododin reports that after the gashing assault, there was none found more ardent than Llywy." This Llywy is the maid before mentioned. Michael is referred to as
one saved from the slaughter by Eidiol : " True it was as the songs report. No steeds overtook March! ew. The governor (Eidiol) extended his spear before the swordsman in his thickstrewed path. Then, as when a reaping comes in doubtful weather, did the splendid knight cause the blood to flow." The bard gives praise to Baalchanan, the enemy of his race : " As for Cynon of the gentle breast, the governor of the feast, he sat not inactive upon his throne. Those whom he pierced were not pierced again. Keen was the point of his lance. Heavy was the stroke which had fallen in the first assault, but he who administered the liquor
put an end to their outrage. Effectual was his valour in behalf of Elphin." The men of Cattraeth were scalpers, for Aneurin sings a lament " for the piercing of the skilful and most learned man, for the fair corpse which fell upon the sod, for the cutting of his hair from his head." Taliesin, the friend of Elphin, representing the Albanian Amalekites, to whose race Baalchanan belonged, sang the praises of Aneurin's foes, but, while the latter was in prison, he gained information from the Trojan bard, to which he thus refers : " I am not violent nor querulous ; I will not avenge myself on the petulant ; nor will I laugh in derision. This scofif shall drop under foot, where my limbs are inflamed in the subterranean house by the iron chain which passes over my two knees. Yet of the mead and of the horn and of the assembly



800 THE HITTITES.
of Cattraeth, I, Aneurin, will sing what is known to Taliesin, who imparts to me his thoughts." Helen is again referred to, when the poet tells of the arrangement of the guests at the feast : " And with speed were they distinguished into tribes, whilst the lady and her paramour were stowing their parties, an armed man and a man unarmed by turns It is an imperative duty to sing the illustrious patriots who came on the message of the mountain chief, sovereign of the natives, and the daughter of the lofty Eudav, the same who selected the unarmed, and dressed in purple those who were destined to be slaughtered The placid Eidiol felt the heat of the splendid Sun when the maid
was treated with outrage. His associates join in the fray, determined to stand or fall." Now, the daughter of Eudav was Helen Luyddawg, wrongly called the sister of Kynan Meriadawc, or Baal-Chanan, and Eidiol was her brother Hadar. This is the dark side of the picture. Aneurin thus depicts
the bricrht one : " We are called ! The sea and the borders are in
contlict. Spears are mutually rushing, spears of those whom we cherished. There is need of sharp weapons. Gashing is the
sword. Before the hostile band flaming in steel there is a prosperous leader, even he who supported the steeds and the bloody harness on the red stained Cattraeth. We are called to the bright glory of conflict, led on by the hand of the meritorious,
the iron clad chief, the sovereign, who is the theme of the Godo
din, the sovereign who deplores our divisions. Before Eidiol, the energetic, there is a flame ; it will not be blown aside. Men of approved worth has he stationed in command. The firm covering guard has he placed in the van. He it was who vigorously
descended upon the scattered foe. When the cry arose, he supported the main weight. Of the retinue of the mountain chief, none escaped but those defenceless ones whom his arm
protected. I beheld a spectacle from the high land of the Done, when they were descending with the sacrifice round the omen fire. I saw what was usual in a town closely shut up, and disorderly men were pierced with agony. I saw men in complete order approaching with a shout, and carrying the head of the
freckled intruder. May the ravens devour it
!
" The bard
Taliesin was evidently a Cymro, for he prays that the Cymri may



THE KIXGS THAT REIGNED IN EDOM. 301
be delivered from the oppression of the Gwyddyl, the Brython, and the Rhomani. At first he was the friend of the Amalekite Elphin, who had brought him up, and he procured his benefactor's deliverance from the prison in which Maelgwn had confined him. Afterwards he transferred his services to Maelgwn and to Urien Rheged, who fought at Cattraeth on the side of the Gododin. Of the former he says : " It was Maelgwn whom I saw with piercing weapons before the master of the fair herd. The host of Maelgwn, exulting, advanced : and severely did the embattled warriors
pierce in the bloody inclosure. The grey stones they remove.
Soon is Elgan and his retinue discovered—for his slaughter, alas ! how great the vengeance that ensued. Through and through, wide and pointed, they came, advancing and surrounding the only wise Bran, sou of Elgan." The identity of Elgan with the Cynon of Aneurin is attested by the statement that Bran was his son, for Bran, or Brian, is made the nephew of Cadwalla, the father of Conan Meriadawc. This is a mistake, for he was his grandson, but the connection is sufficient to prove the
correctness of the identification. The reader of ancient British
traditions must, therefore, discriminate between the CymroAlbanian line of Caswallon and Conan, and the Gododin of Coll and Eidiol, with the latter of whom Maelgwn was confederate. The prose version of the conflict is given by Geofii-ey of Monmouth. He tells how Hengist invited the British chiefs, who had come in arms against him, to a banquet, at which he treacherously slew four hundred and sixty of their number. But
Eldol, consul of Gloucester, finding a stake, laid it about him with great effect, and succeeded in making his escape. Some time after, Eldol, in company with Aurelius Ambrosius, attacked and defeated Hengist, who fled to his sanctuary, Caer Conan. However, he came forth once more and engaged in combat with Eldol, who, " seizing on his helmet, by main force dragged him in among the
Britons, and then in transports of joy cried out with a loud voice,
' God has fulfilled my desire ! My brave soldiers, down, down with your enemies the Ambrons.' " So Hengist was taken and beheaded, and a mound raised over his body.^'^ The name of Hengist is in none of the ancient documents from which Geoffrey
29 Geoffrey's British History, viii. G.



302 THE HITTITES.
got his history, and the name of Caer Conan snflficiently indicates that it was not the Saxon invader, but the son of Caswallon, who, as Conan Meriadawc, answers to the Kenite Baalchanan, that fell by Eldol's hand. The Cymric historians have multiplied Caswallon and Conan into many Cad wallas, Cadwalladers, Cassibelauns, and Conans and Kynans. Before leaving the British
traditions of this great contest, it is worth observing that they
state the number of the divisions of the Trojans. According to
Homer, these were sixteen, according to Dictys Cretensis, fifteen, according to Dares of Phrygia, fourteen, including the Ethiopians under Perses and Memnon.^'^ But the Maya and Quiche accounts,
so entirely dissimilar as to mark their independence, agree in making them thirteen ; and the British Aneurin further reduces the number in the song entitled " Truan y w gennyf," where he says : " But fixed was the decree of fate when they arrived, that
vexatious multitude—with sorrow I recount their bands—eleven
complete battalions. Now there is precipitate flight and lamenta
tion upon the road."^^ Ossian's song of Temora, in which the usurping Cairbar invites Oscar, with his three hundred com
panions to a feast at which, after a preconcerted signal, similar to
that described in the Gododin, he kills his guest, but himself falls by Oscar's hand, is probably a Gaelic echo of the Cymric story, the name Cairbar being that by which the Gael would naturally denote Gachbor, the father of Baalchanan.^In Persian story Hadar is represented by Gudarz, who is called the son of Kishwad. He was sent by the Persian king Kai Khusrau against the Turkish Afrasiab, and was overthrown " Seventy persons of the family and household of Gudarz were
plunged into destruction ; this hero, after a thousand wiles, was scarcely able to extricate himself with a few of his sons from the
scene of slaughter." But, returning with a larger force, Gudarz
engaged anew in conflict with the Turks, killing their leader, Piran Wisah, with his own hand, and utterly routing the forces of the enemy, of whom two hundred thousand men fell before his victorious troops. He also cut ofl" the head of Afrasiab, as Eldol

decapitated the supposed Hengist, when there was a fear of his being spared. As a reward for his valour the countries of Isfahan, Jirjan and Kuhistan were assigned him by Kai Khusrau, who represents an Egyptian Pharaoh about the time of Methosuphis.^^ This Persian connection is valuable as illustrating the Egyptian alliance of Hadar, who must have been the viceroy of Thothmes III. in Palestine. In Egypt his family were the namers of Abydos, a transplanted Avith, and Tentyris, a corruption, like Tyndarus and Idanthyrsus, of Hadadezer, which were situated between Coptos and Thebes. At Tentyris was the temple of Hathor, and at Abydos, the Memnonium. Hadar, therefore, was a subordinate Pharaoh, and, through his wife, Mehetabel, the Mautemva of the monuments, was reckoned among the Thothmes. In one of the chambers of the ancient Theban palaces Mautemva is represented with the attributes of Hathor giving birth to Amenophis III., or Memnon. The Hathor whom the queen personifies is called the
mistress of Mafkat, the land of copper, by which name the Sinai tic peninsula was known, and her temple was at Surabit el Khadim in that country. She is also represented as the messenger of the Egyptian gods, who goes forth smiting their enemies. It is plain that Mehetabel, the daughter of Thothmes II. and Matred, is herself the original Hathor, taking that name from her husband, Hadar, an Egyptian Ra Hathorsi, who was the smiter of Egypt's Hittite foes in the land of Moab, and to whom, as of Kenite race, Arabia Petraea and its mines belons^ed. These are also the mines discovered by Saul of Rehoboth. The monumental history of Egypt connects these mines with the twelfth dynasty of Manetho, or rather with the Osortasens of the tablet of Abydos, who have been supposed to represent part of that dynasty. From the Osortasens the Amenophids traced their descent, thus uniting Memnon with the miner.s. Again Osiris, from whom the Osirtasens, or Osortasens, are supposed to have derived their name, and who was a comparatively late Egyptian divinity, was lord of Ebot, or Abydos. According to Plutarch, he travelled through the
world teaching men agriculture and the arts of civilization, peacefully bringing the nations under his beneficent sway. All these
indications point to the occupation of an upper Egyptian kingdom

by Saul and his successors, and show that Hadar, by his marriage with Mehetabel, united the Amenemhe, or Ammonite, dynasty of Thebes, and the Thothmes, or ancient Egyptian line, with the Osortasens of Abydos. His father, Saul, may thus be identified
with Osortasen III., the founder of the fortress of Semneh named after Hadar's son Shimon, the Osymandyas of Diodorus, whose son Amnon is the Memnon and Agamemnon of ancient tradition.^* The Persian story calls Shimon by the name Esfendiar, and makes him the father of Behmen, but by an unpardonable corruption of
the original record, styles him the son of Gushtasp and sets him forth as the enemy of Rustam, the son of Zaul. Nevertheless,
the Persian account is valuable, as showing that Shimon, or
Esfendiar, died before his father, whose successor was his grandson Amnon, thus identifying him with prince Schaemdjom, called
the son of Rameses 11.^^ The connection of Hadar with Egyptian monarchy makes it evident that, great as was the conquest of the Cymro-Zerethite
capital on the Nahaliel, it was not the chief exploit of the Beero
thite hero. Although his father-in-law, Thothmes II., had married the heiress of the Theban-Hittite line, he had not come into the possession of Thebes itself, which was held by a king claiming descent from Mezahab. In Greek story his name is Creon ; in one Indian version he is Kama, and is regarded as a successor of Jarashandha ; and in another his people are the Srinjayas descended from Vitahavya, or Mezahab.^^ In the Great Harris Papyrus, Rameses III. describes the anarchy that reigned in
Eo-ypt prior to his time : " The land of Egypt was in a state of ruin. Every man did as he liked. There was no head to them for many years, who might preside over other matters. The land
of Egypt belonged to the princes in the districts. One killed the other through envy of power. Other events took place thereafter in years of distress. One Syrian chief had made himself a prince among them. He brought the whole land into subjection under his sole rule. He assembled his companions, plundered the
treasures of the inhabitants. They made the gods like human
34 1 Chron. iv, 20. 36 De Lanoye, Rameses the Great, New York, 236.
3« It will yet a|)i)ear that tlie names Creon and Kama denote the Ekronite auxiliaries or mercenaries of the Ammono-Hittite line. The study of the Hittitea in Egypt will more fully exjiiain the position of Hadar.

beings. Offerings were no longer presented in the interior of the temples. The images of the gods were thrown down and remained on the ground. The gods appointed their son, the issue of their limbs, to be prince of the whole land on their seat, the great son of Ra, Ra Seti Nekht. He was Khepera Sutech in his tempest. He arranged the whole land which had re\'olted. He executed the criminals who were in the land Mera. He purified the great tlirone of Egypt. He designated me as crown prince on the seat of 8eb." '^~' It was during this period of general upheaval that Thothmes sent his sons toofether with Hadar, and Labaris, the
builder of the labyrinth, who reigned at or near Heracleopolis, and whose Kenite name was Ophrah, or Leophrah. against the Zuzimite holders of Thebes. The Thebans had a body of Philis
tines in their pay, and, with the aid of these Japhetic warriors,
defeated the allies signally, killing four of the sons of Thothmes
and the chief leaders of the expedition, with the exception of Hadar. This is the historical event which, under manifold disguises, has been set forth by many Greek writers as the Seven against Thebes. In it Hadar appears as Adrastus. the son of
Talaus, who was saved bj^ the swiftness of his horse. Ten years
later, Adrastus led the sons of the slain heroes against the obnoxious city. This time Vcmj were victorious, and, taking Thebes,
razed its walls to the ground. The Greek story relates that Adrastus lost his son in this eno-aoement, who, as his name was Shimon, may have been the Schaemdjom claimed by Rameses. It appears that these two entirely distinct warlike expeditions,
the siege of Thebes and the capture of the Zerethite capital in Moab, have been confounded with each other in the traditions
which the Hittites delivered to many peoples. It does not seem
that there was any disastrous assault upon the Zerethite city,
such as the Welsh story of Cattraeth indicates, but the deadly
repulse at Thebes is thus transferred into the narrative. The names of Plisthenes and Polynices again have been imported into tlie genealogy of Atreus and Agamemnon, and into that of the Theban line, from the Trojan story of Priam, or Baalchanan; and Hadar, the grandfather of Amnon, who is the Egyptian Memnon and Argive Agamemnon, has been confounded with

Izrachiah, the father of Michael, who represents truly the Greek Menelaus. But, while Atreus, who by his descent from Tantalus, is proved to be Izrachiah, grandson of Tolag, is made to do duty for Hadar as the father of Agamemnon, that hero's individuality is restored in Adrastus, the son of Talaus, which latter name may be derived from Talut, the Arabic form of Saul. According to Homer, Adrastus was dead before the Trojan war, for in mention
ing the possessions of Agamemnon, he specifies Sicyon, " where Adrastus formerly reigned." In the Odyssey also he represents Memnon as a Trojan ally and enemy of the Greeks, while in reality he was either the same person as Agamemnon, or his son Amnon, if the Greek generalissimo be Shimon, the Egyptian Osymandias. The Indian story of Troy's overthrow is confounded with the battle of Megiddo, in which Thothroes III. defeated the Hittites, for Jarashandha is made the king of Magadha. Megiddo was possessed by the Maachathites, a junior branch of the Achuzamites, or Zuzims, united with the Horite line of Jezreel. From among all the varying accounts of Hadar's life this can be gleaned, that he was the greatest warrior of his age, leading the Egyptian forces and the Hittites of his own Beerothite family to victory against his brother Hittites of Thebes and Zareth Shachar; that he was a Pharaoh, dividing the empire of Egypt with the Thothmes, among whom he is reckoned, and bringing a great part of Palestine under his sway ; and that he was the avenger of the honour of his family and of his brother-in-law Michael, from whom Baalchanan, the son of Achbor, had taken his sister Helen.
It is hard to say where Pau, or Pagu, his capital, was. It juay have been the island Bageh, opposite Philae on the Nile, where the second Amenophis has left a statue and a temple, or we may look for it in the land of Gel)alene. where, between Sihon and the Dead Sea, Fugua lies.^^ His Palestinian conijuests did not pass to
his successors. Zippor, the Moabite, with those Ammonite allies whonj he had aided against the Zerethites, an<l an Amorite host,
soon after entered the land which he and his ancestors, Saul and Hadad, had fought so hard to gain, and history has no more t<> tell of the kings that reigned in Edom.^*

CHAPTER VII.
The Hittites in Egypt.
The first colonists of Egypt were the Hamitic Mizraites, who gave to the land its Bible name, Mizraim. Traditions of this family may survive among the African tribes descended from it, but they have no place in the general history of civilization. The
first historical race in that country, according to ancient writers, was that of the Auritae, whom the Egyptian monuments call Hor shesu, or the servants of Horus, placing them in the earliest
or golden age.^ These were the Horites, whose genealogies are very fully given in the 36th chapter of Genesis and in some por
tions of the first book of Chronicles. The ancestor of this race was Hor, or Hur, who gave his name to the range of mountains extending from the Dead Sea to the -^lanitic gulf of the Red Sea.
His son, or grandson, was Shobal, the father of Kirjath Jearim, an Amorite region. That he left the mountain range and took up his abode in Egypt is very doubtful, but his name was carried into that country, there to denote as Seb-ra the ancestral gVxl of those who regarded themselves as the rightful holders of Egyptian sovereignty. Nor does the name of his eldest son appear among the Pharaohs, for that son was Reaiah, the Roeh, also called Aliah, Allan, and Alvan. He is the Elioun of Sanchoniatho's Phoenician history, for that author gained his information from a son of Thabion, who was the first hierophant of the Phoenicians, and Thabion is Zibeon the Horite, after whom, by another change of the initial letter, the Gibeonites of Kirjath Jearim w^ere called. ^ The son of Zibeon, either Ajah or Anah, naturally ascribed the highest place to him whom the Horites regarded as the first in importance of their race. In Egypt, Roeh, or Reaiah, became Ra,
the sun and chief of all the divinities. His son Jahath exercised sovereignty, however, occupying the second place in the first

dynasty under the name Athothis. He is said to have been a physician and to have built a palace at Memphis, where he was doubtless succeeded by his son Achumai, the Khem of Egyptian worship, after whom Chemmis in the Thebaid was called, and the original of the Moabite Chemosh." Etam was apparently the son of Achumai. As a god he was called Atmu, or Re Athom, and as a monarch Manetho designates him Timaeus, placing the invasion of the Shepherds in his reign. " We had once a king called Timaeus, under whom, from some cause unknown to me, the Deity was unfavourable to us, and there came unexpectedly from the eastern parts a race of men of obscure extraction, who confidently invaded the country and easily got possession of it by force without a battle. Having subdued those who commanded in it, they proceeded savagely to burn the cities, and razed the temples of
the gods, inhumanly treating all the natives, murdering some of them and carrying the wives and children of others into slavery. In the end they also established one of themselves as a king, whose name was Salatis ; and he took up his abode in Memphis, exacting tribute from both the Upper and the Lower Country, and leaving garrisons in the most suitable places. He especially strengthened the parts towai'ds the east, foreseeing that on the part of the Assyrians, who were then powerful, there would be a desire to invade their kingdom. Finding, therefore, in the Sethroite nome a city very conveniently placed, lying eastward
of the Bubastic river, and called from some old religious doctrine,
Avaris, he built it up and made it very strong with walls, settling
there also a great number of heavy-armed soldiers to the amount of 240,000 men for a guard. Hither he used to come in the summer season, partly to distribute the rations of corn and pay the
troops, partly to exercise them carefully b}" musterings and
reviews, in order to inspire fear into foreign nations." * The son of Etam was Jezreel, and it was with his history that the Osirian rites were connected rather than with that of Saul
the Beerothite. His name is used in the Hebrew scriptures as a .synonym for corn, and he appears to have been the first monarch to devote attention to agriculture.^ As Saul did the same, the
•< 1 Chron. iv. 2. < JoHt'iihus against Ajtion, i. 14. •• Hosea ii. 22.



THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 309
histories of these two great culture heroes have been confounded.
But Jezreel is the Osiris whom Typhon killed and cut to pieces, the discerption of his body into fourteen parts denoting, under a figure, the dismemberment of his kingdom by the invading Hittite chiefs. From him descended the line of the Thothmes, whom the Kenite record enumerates in succession as Shuthelah, Bered, Tahath I., Eladah; and Tahath 11.^ It is now known that the true reading of the word formerly called Thoth is Tahuti, and this is the Kenite Tahath ; the final ones of Thothmes means child or offspring." At Chemmis first the expatriated Horites found a
refuge, and afterwards, when the Hittites extended their dominion southward, they sought shelter on the Ethiopian border. The marriage of the second Tahath with Mezahab's daughter Matred brought about the restoration of the ancient line of Pharaohs, called in the Bible the kings " which knew not Joseph." ^ This was not the only Horite family of monarchs driven into exile by the Hycsos. The first king of Egypt was Menes, and he is the Manahath who appears in the Kenite lists as the second son of
Shobal. As a deity he was called Month -ra, a name which Osburn has compared with that of the Horite.^ According to Manetho, he founded the first or Thinite dynasty at This in Upper Egypt, near Abydos. This is an error, for the most ancient monarchy in Egypt was that of Zoan, or Tanis, in the Delta, not far from the borders of Palestine, and near that Mendes which commemorated Manahath. Zoan was built seven years after Hebron in Palestine, and bore the name of a grandson of Manahath, called in the English version Zaavan, but the Hebrew form of which is of the same character as Zoan.^° The father of Zaavan was Ezer, and his brothers were Bilhan and Akan, the latter being the Vedic Agni and the Agenor of Phoenicia.^^ While some traditions associate Etam, or Getam, with Achumai, the grandson of Reaiah, there are others which connect him with the family of Manahath.

Such in particular is the Greek story of Cadmus the Ph(enician, who is represented as a son of Agenor. To the same family also belonged Zibeon. the eponym of Gibeon. His sons were Ajah and Anah ; the son of Anah was Dishon ; and from him came Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran, tribes so extensively connected with ancient history that it is inexpedient for the present to set forth their record.^- From Zibeon, or Zibegon, however, descended the Sebekatefs of Upper Egypt. The only Horite line that has importance in the Bible story of Egypt is that in which the Tahaths appear and which traced its descent, either from Reaiah through Achumai, or from Manahath through Akan. Theophilus calls the first king of Egypt Nechaoth, and seems to place him near the time of the invasion of Chedorlaomer.^^ This Nechaoth is the Horite Manachath. who must, however, have been earlier than the Elamite raid, for Harphre, who is made the son of Month and Ritho in the Egyptian pantheon, is the Hareph, or Chareph, father of the house of Gader, whom the Kenite scribe counts to the Manahethites, and he was the father of Chedorlaomer.^* Hareph was the son of Chepher and son-inlaw of Manahath, but his son Laomer took his grandfather's name calling himself Kudur Nankhundi. The contemporar}^ of Hareph would be the Horite Ezer, and the contemporary of Chedorlaomer, his son Zaavan, from whom Zoan received its name. Zoan, or Zaavan, therefore, was no doubt the Pharaoh whom Abram found in the city of the same name. It is very likely that the alliance between Hareph and an Egyptian princess was the means of introducing Hittite deities into the valley of the Nile, for one of the most venerated of Egyptian divinities was Khepera Sutekh, whose name is no other than that of Chepher, combined with the
Hittite title of divinity. This alliance also brought into Egypt the Kenite Mered, whom the Egyptian inscriptions know as Prince Merhet, the son-in-law of Cheops. Cheops, Suphis, or Chufu, as
he is variously called, did not belong to the ancient Horite line of Pharaohs. He was an intruder of the Hittite race, being Ziph,
the eldest son of Jehaleleel the Zerethite. Leaving his brother

Asaree] upon the Zerethite throne on the Euphrates, and, accom
panied by his other brotlier Tiria and his sister Ziphah, he entered Egypt and established himself apparently at Memphis. There
he enslaved the native Mizraites, compelling them to build at Gizeh, near at hand, the great pyramid and the stone causeway to it, which Herodotus looked upon as quite as wonderful an achievement. He was thus the inaugurator of those megalithic structures for which Egypt afterwards became famous. To his ancest<jr Zereth he attributed, under the name Tosorthrus. or Sesorthus, the invention of building with hewn stones. This Tosorthrus appears in Manetho's third Memphite dynasty, and the Tyreis and Souphis who follow him denote Tiria and Ziph himself.^^ In a list of Lower Egyptian kings, prepared by Eratosthenes and preserved by Syncellus, the ancestral name of Zereth appears as Curudes, immediately after that of Menes. This custom of
inserting the names of ancestors in the lists of the Pharaohs enormously increased the number of spurious monarchs, who never saw Egypt save in the persons of their descendants. So far did this practice extend that Manetho's fifth dynasty of Elephantine kings, in the latter part of which one or two Kenite names may be detected, begins with Usecheres, or Usercheres, who is Ashchur, the father of Tekoa, whose bones had long since been laid in Babylonian Cutha, and he is followed by Sephres, his second son Chepher. On the eastern bank of the Nile the place called Troja, opposite Memphis, was, with the more easterly Troicus mons, a
memorial of Tiria, and in the great river Nile his father, Jehale
leel, was commemorated as, at a later period, in the Nahaliel of Moab. From the people of Ziph the Egyptians picked up the Linus that astonished Herodotus, the refrain of ya laylee, ya layl, which Sir Gardner Wilkinson heard sung by the Copts of modern
days, who little dreamt that they, were unconsciou.sly bewailing Helel, the fallen son of Shachar.^*^ In Graeco-Egyptian tradition Ziph was Typhon, the monster from whose presence the gods fled, and his sister Ziphah was
Nephthj's, the sister of Typhon, a name that has already been explained. Nephthys was the mother of Anubis, who is the

Kenitc Anul>, or Ganub, son of Coz, so that Ziphah must have
been the wife of Coz. This Coz is well identified with the deity Chonso, called the son of Amun and Maut, and Amun is no other person than Amnion, or Ben Ammi, the son of Lot. Amun is called Amun-ra, a name which indicates relationship with the
solar or Horite family of Ra, and this relationship can only have been through his wife Maut. It would seem, therefore, that Amnion, whose maternal grandmother was probably an Egyptian princess, had preceded the Hittites in their occupation of the Delta, where he allied himself with the ruling Horite race. His son Coz, a thoroughly historical personage, for he is the Choos to whom Eusebius gives the second place in Manetho's second
Thinite dynasty, established the worship of animals in Egypt, of
the goat at Mendes, where the sovereignt}^ of his father Ammon had its commencement, and of the bulls called Apis at Memphis,
and Mnevis at On, or Heliopolis. Lepsius found a shield bearing the name Kekeou in a tomb near the pyramids of Gizeh, which he supposed might belong to Choos. or Kaiechos, as another Manethonic list calls him.^" The absence of the final n is hurtful
to this identification, for that letter appears in Kaiechos, Choos,
Coz, and Chonso, as well as in the articled form of the latter, Pachons. It was from the latter form that the Greeks and Romans derived their Bacchus, also called lacchus, who was the son of Ammon and Amalthea, according to Diodorus. The son of Bacchus was (Enopion, king of Chios, and he is Anub of the Kenite list, and the Egyptian god Anubis, son of Nephthys. It is probably more than a coincidence that the Greek (Enopion, the maker or drinker of wine, should designate the same person as the Semitic Anub, or Ganub, meaning grapes, and that he as Ganymede should be called the cup bearer of the god.s. As a Pharaoh, he is Ouenephes, the fourth king of Manetho's first dynasty, who is said to have tuilt pyramids at Cochome, and in whose reign there was a great famine in Egypt. He is also mentioned in the fragments of the Turin papyrus, in which Annoub replaces the Anon, or Bnon, whom Manetho makes the immediate successor of Saites, the leader of the loth and l7th Shepherd dynasties. The home of this Ammonite family was probably

THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 313
Onuphis, in the Delta, whence they spread to Metelis and Canopus, and still farther to the west, constituting the unhistorical Xoite line, which Manetho names as a fourteenth dynasty, but without specifying any of its members. The son and successor of Anub was Tola, or Tolag, who is the Tlas of Manetho's second dynasty, and the Greek Talus, son of CEnopion. His descendants, Uzzi, or Guzzi, Izrachiah and Michael, have already been considered in the connection of the Greek Menelaus and the British Michael's mount with Helen, the author of the Trojan war. Some branches of the
Ammonite stock accompanied the Hittites in their migrations, and many traces of Anub and his descendants are to be found, not only in the legends of the Khitan, but also in their geographical and tribal nomenclature. But most of the children of Ziphah adhered to their sub-Semitic speech and followed that southern Asiatic route in migration which led them to Malacca, and thence, by the Malay archipelago, to the New World, where, in Guatimala, they founded a new Quiche kingdom and emulated in their monuments the structures which had been erected in Egypt by the forefathers whose memory they kept and have communicated to the world in their fantastic traditions. The Ammonite connection of Ziph by marriage is of great chronological value, as it proves that Jehaleleel, his father, who was at the same time the father of Ziphah and Asareel, must have been contemporary with Ammon, and thus posterior to the raid of Chedorlaomer. It follows of necessity that Arioch of Ellasar was not the son of Asareel, but some earlier member of the Zerethite family, and that Jehaleleel was coeval with the latter portion of the life of Abraham. His son Ziph and daughter Ziphah would thus belong to the time of Isaac, in whose day the great pyramid of Cheops was erected ; for, although Ammon and Isaac were contemporaries, Jacob and Esau were not born until the patriarch had attained his sixtieth year. The story of Esau
affords material for the chronology of the two gi-eat nations of Palestine and Egypt, inasmuch as his wife Aholibamah was the granddaughter of Zibeon the Horite, and his wife Judith, or Adah was the daughter of Beeri, the head of the Hittite line of Beeroth, and the granddaughter of Elon the Temenite or Amalekite. Mered,
again, as the son of Ezra, was in the same generation as Beeri, the



~^14 THK HITTITES.
son of Ezra's brother Rechab, so that his inarriage with Bithiah, the (laughter of Ziph, fulfils all chronological conditions. The entrance of Ziph, or Typhon, into Egypt marks the beginning of Hittite sovereignty in that land. It does not appear that his family retained the empire which he had gained for any length of time, for the Greek legend of Sisyphus, the son of ^olus, represents him as incessantly rolling a huge stone to the top of a hill, only to see it slip from his grasp and descend to the bottom. His kingdom apparently fell, soon after his death, into the hands of Anub, his sister's son, the second Souphis of Manetho, and the Kneph Chufu of the pyramid inscriptions, who was in turn dislodged by his sister Zobebah. The Egyptians regarded the sway of Cheops and his successors as one of unparalleled oppression and cruelty, although in later times his name of Typhon was replaced by that of Apophis, to denote the great enemy of the native Egyptian race. In the Babylonian list Zabu is succeeded by Apil Sin and Sin Muballit, after whom comes Hammurabi.
Ziph must, therefore, have retained his possessions in the east, leaving his son as viceroy. The Babylonian Apil Sin may be the same as Cephren, Chabryis, or Shafre, of the Egyptian lists and monuments, who is made by some a brother, by others a son of Cheops. The Hebraeo-Kenite name capable of such apparently diverse renderings would be Heber or Cheber, which as Hebel would answer to Apil, and as Cheber to Chabryis and Cephren. There is in the Kenite list a Heber wrongly attributed to the family of the Israelite Asher, the editor of the genealogies having confounded that patriarch's descendants with the royal line of
Assyria.^^ He is called the father of Japhlet, or Yaphlet, a name
not indeed identical with Muballit, the son of Apil, but which appears to denote the same person, for in the Synchronous Historj'^ of Assyria and Babylonia we meet with the following explanatory pa.ssage which justifies us in regarding the prefixed
m as mi or ma, the honorific Hittite sufiix : " In the time of Assur-Yupalladh, king of Assyria, Cara-Murdas, king of GanDuniyas, son of Mupallidhat-Serua, the daughter of As.sur-Yupalladh, men of the Cassi revolted against and slew him."^'* This
'" 1 Chron. vii. 31. '» R«-cords of the Past, iii. 29.



THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 315
passage indicates that YiipalJadh, or Yaphlet, was the true name of the eastern monarch, and by calling his daughter Mupallidhat an evident compound of Yupalladh, asserts the identity of Muballit, son of Apil, and the Kenite Yaphlet, son of Heber. In addition to this, Serah appears as a woman's name ifi the same Kenite list, answering, not indeed to the daughter of Yupalladh, for she was the aunt of his father Apil, or Heber, but to the form Serua, indicating the existence of such a name in the family.
Confirmation is thus obtained of the truth of the suggestion already made that the line of Zereth acquired regal power in Assyria, a power which, it may be, never left their hands until the great empire was overthrown. An explanation is also found for the statement of Manetho that the Shepherd Salatis fortified Avaris on the north-eastern border of Egypt as a protection against the arms of the Assyrians, " who were then powerful." The next Hittite invasion of the land of the Pharaohs is that most memorable in Egyptian history, and of which echoes are to be heard all over the world. Its leader was Jahdai, son of Gazez> who was the son of Haran, of Ephah, of Achuzam, the eldest born of Ashchur and Naarah. Great as the fame of Haran, or Charan, at once an Ouranos and a Cronus, became in laAer days, there is no record of Zuzimite sovereignty before the time of Jahdai. Smitten by Chedorlaomer in Ham beyond Jordan, they were again invaded by the conquering sons of Zereth, and, with their brethren, the Achashtarite Rephaim of Ashteroth Kai-naim and Emim of Shaveh, were forced to look out for new homes. What could be more inviting than the valley of the Nile,
improved and beautified by the labours of the first Horite Pharaohs, the Ammonites, and the Hittite lines of Ziph and Mered, with the aid of their Mizraite slaves ? It was a divided land Hittite and Horite, Ammonite and Moabite striving for supremacy, and not far from its borders lay the fortified camp of the Philistines of Gerar, a hardy Japhetic race, powerful allies for him who could win their friendship. The Zuzims acquired that
alliance. In the time of Isaac the Philistine Abimelech, or
Padishah, came to Beersheba to see the patriarch, not unattended. Phichol, the chief captain of his army, was in his train, and with him came Achuzzath, whose name corresponds to no other in the Sacred

Record, save that of Achuzam, the Hittite.-'' Achuzzath, the companion of the Philistine, was thus a Zuzimite whose friendship prepared the way for that alhance which placed Jahdai on an Egyptian throne and enabled Philitis to pasture his flocks on
the Nile j^kstures, richer by far than the fields of Gerar and
Beersheba. The invaders took their name from their leader, who gave to the senior Zuzim tribe that title of Yahdaites which it has ever since borne. " It happened," says the First Sallier Papyrus, " that the land of Egypt fell into the hands of the Aadtous, and then there were no native Pharaohs left in the whole country. The Aadtous held the strong City of the Sun, and their king resided at Avaris."^^ In Arabian story these strangers, or
Aadtous, are the Adites, the greatest of the Arab tribes, who, under the leadership of Shedad, the son of Ad, took possession of the land of Egypt, and brought the rest of the world into subjection.-- Some writers trace Ad's descent from Aws, the son of Aram, the son of Shem, while others make his father Amalek, but Tabari says the Adites were Akhahami, by which we must understand Achuzamites, or Zuzims.^^ The Egyptian word Hycsos, supposed to mean .shepherd kings, is a corruption of the Achuzamite name, theitinal r;i being d'-opped under the impression that it marked a Semitic plural. In Indian story, as the Ramayana records it, the Adites are the Ayodyas of Oude, a race of con'[{uerors.-^ Manetho says the invaders took possession of Egypt without a battle. The army of Jahdai must liavc struck terror to the hearts of the petty Pharaohs and caused them to submit tamely to the new domination. One sovereign alone showed courage, and she was a (|ueen, Zobebah, the daughter of the Ammonite Coz, and sister of Anub. According to tradition, she was no longer in her first youth when Jahdai sought her in
marriage, but she refused to accept him save on condition that the child born of her should inherit the throne. In the lists of Manetho she is called Usaphais, Biophis, and Binothris, and it is recorded that in her reign women were granted the prerogative

of royalty. Jahdai accepted the condition, thus disinheriting the six sons borne to him by his previous wives. These sons were Regem, Jotham,Geshan,Pelet, Ephah and Shaaph.--' The Ramayana tells the story of the dispossessed princes, but very incorrectly,
for it calls their father Dasaratlia, although rightly making him king of Oude, and styles the four sons Rama, Bharat, Lakshman, and Satrugna. Of these, Lakshman answers to the Arabian Lokman, son of Ad, and he is the Regem of the Kenite list and actual hero of the story, whose place the Ramayana gives to Rama. The son, again, in whose favour Rama, Lakshman, and Satrugna are disinherited, is in the Indian -epic Bharat, the Pelet
of the genealogy, who was one of the dispossessed princes. Rama represents the Hittite Harum, son of Regem, and Satrugna
is an Indian version of Jezreel, or Yetsregel, whose daughter Pelet married. The Buddhist version of this legend calls the king of
the Solar race Amba, or Okkaka the third, and says that by his wife Hasta he had four sons, Ulkamukha, Kalanduka, Hastanika, and Purasunica, or Sirinipura.-'^ Of these, Ulkamukha, a kind of Lokman or Regem, is the only one that answers to the record. In his old age the king married again, and his new queen insisted that her son Janta should be his successor, whereupon Amba was compelled to dismiss his four older sons, who went away and founded the race of the Ambatta Sakyas, preserving the purity of that race by marrying their sisters. The names Amba and Ambatta are probably corruptions of Anub, since the daughter of Anub married Harum, the son of Regem. This Regem belongs to the Accadian history of Chaldea, in which he is called Sar Rukin, or Sarcjon of Agade. He is represented in Indian storv by Krishna, as well as by Lakshman and Ulkamukha, and his brother Pelet is Krishna's brother Baladeva.-'' While, however Resrem established himself in Chaldea, and Pelet founded a kingdom at Beth Pelet in southern Palestine, the other brothers would seem to have dwelt with their father Jahdai in Egypt. Geshau, or Geshem, certainly did, for he named the land of Goshen so
celebrated in the history of Israel.

Jahdai's reign was a short one, and, according to some tradi
tions, one of cruelty terribly avenged. He died before his son
was born, and the brief Kenite record states that the child's mother, Zobebah. " called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with sorrow. "-^ It is rather a strange coincidence that the Abb6 Banier interprets the name of the goddess Cybele by the
Hebrew cliebel—enfanter avec donleur —the very expression that the sacred narrative employs in regard to the birth of Jabez, for the Phrygian Cybele, or Cybebe, as she is often called, is the same as the Ammonite Zobebah, and Jabez is the heir for whose sake Reerem and his brethren were disinherited.-^ In the Phrygian story, Cybebe, an old queen reigning in her own right, is the
lover of Atys, a beautiful youth who is put to death before her eyes. Lamenting his death, she roams throughout the earth, like lo, the mother of Epaphus, and at last brings forth her child Sabus, or Sabazius, whose name is intimately connected with the worship of Bacchus. Jahdai has a very full record in Egyptian lists. According to Lenormant, his name appears on the monuments as Ati, whose throne was disputed by Teta and Userkara, and whose son was the glorious Pepi Merira. This makes him the same as the Othoes of Manetho's sixth Memphite dynasty, who was killed by his life guards, and was followed by Phios. Nor can he be any other than Achthoes, the only Pharaoh whose name is given in the ninth Heracleopolitan dynasty, the most atrocious of monarchs, who did much mischief to the people of Egypt, and, falling into madness, was devoured by a crocodile. Once more, Diodorus places before Moeris, or Merira, one Actisanes, an Ethiopian, who cut off the noses and ears of offenders and banished them to Rhinocolura on the borders of Syria. But Jahdai continued the line of Ammon, which Coz probably had commenced, as the first Amenemes, or son of Amun. These Amenemes appear in Manetho's twelfth Diospoiitan or Theban dynasty, for Thebes was No Ammon, a foundation of the Ammonites.^*^ The second Amenemes was killed by his own guards of
28 1 Chron. iv. 9. » Banier's Mytholog>', ii. 562, English translation ; the quotation is from the

the bed-chamber, and was followed by the great Sesostris, who ruled over all the nations. The guards of the bed-chamber were eunuchs, and such evirati were almost unknown in Egypt, hence the statement of Manetho that they were such, and the peculiar features of the legend of Cybele and Atys, which will not bear
transcription here, point to the introduction into the Nile valley of the barbarous Oriental custom, the origin of which is ascribed
to Semiramis, and which exists in the harems of eastern lands to
the present day. The creatures whom he had constituted his guards avenged their wrongs upon their master's person, and the story of this deed carried down through the ages became that of the
Lydian A.tys, son of Crcesus, who was killed by those whose dutv it was to defend him, and that of Actaeon, so well told by Ovid, the hunter transformed by Diana into a stag, and killed by his own hounds. Ovid got his information from an historical source, for the names of the dogs and the regions whence they came are full of meaning.^^ Homer knew the ghastly tale, for, in his Odyssey, he makes Antinous threaten to send Irus, the beggar, who wishes to drive away Ulysses, in a ship to King Echetus
of Epirus, who cuts off the noses and ears of people, and, inflicting other unmentionable injuries upon them, throws them to his dogs to*eat raw. Echetus is thus Actisanes and Achthoes, and his Epirus was the strong city of the Hycsos, Avaris in the Seth
roite name.^"^
Such was the father of Jabez, an inhuman monster, according to popular tradition, which no doubt exaggerated his vices. The Arabian writers tell of the pride and wickedness of the Adites, of the vain efforts made by the prophet Hud to wean them from their evil ways, and of a black cloud of judgment that burst upon
them, carrying universal desolation. It involved Walid, who is
the Kenite Pelet, in ruin, but Lokman, or Regem, escaped.^^
Jabez was born in a time of strife, typified in after ages by the
march of the armed Galli, the priests of Cybele, in Galatian Pessinus, in many parts of Greece, and even in Rome, by the clash
ing of cymbals, the shrill notes of pipes, and the beating of the

timbrels of the Corybantes, by the mad race of worshippers amid wild shrieks and frantic yells, and the melee in which the knife
bearinflf sacrificers lacerated their own bodies. Zobebah was not left alone. What aid the dispossessed princes rendered cannot yet be told, nor how her brother Aniib in his kingdom in the Delta was affected by his sister's woes; but a brave warrior of the Amu,
as the Eu3'ptians called the Bible Emim, fought her battles and conquered ali her enemies. This true friend of Cybele, the Phrygian tradition calls Marsyas the Lydian. A Lydian indeed he was, the very son of Laadah, the original Lydus and the Salatis of Manetho. As Lydus, however, Laadah was no son of Atys, as the Greeks re])ort. His father was Shelah, the Shuhite of the family of the gi eat Achashtari ; but he had joined his fortunes with those of the Zuzimite Jahdai in his expedition to Egypt, and thus came to be ranked in Lydian history among the kings of its first dynasty, the Atyadae, Lydian Jahdai tes, Aadtous, Adites, Ayodyas, whom, in respect for the elder line of Achuzam, the historians of Lydia placed at the head of the monarchs ' of their race. And his son Reshah, better known as Mareshah, oi* Reshah the illustrious, became the friend of the widowed queen,
and a true father to her illustrious son, warring with skill and courage against the turbulent conspirators, and bringing the land
into order and subjection.^* * What accounts we have of Ma Reshah represent him in his relations with Zobebah as the model
of chivalry and lofty honour, at a time when qualities of an opposite character were most in vogue. As Marsyas, he was the faithful friend of Cybele, accompanying her in all her wanderings and providing for her safet}'. The story of his musical contest with Apollo, his victory over that god, the subsequent
triumph of the lord of the lyre, and the flaying alive of the van
quished Marsyas, are allegorical representations of the overthrow
of the Egyptian line of Horus by Ma Reshah, of its restoration in after years, when his posterity were driven from Egypt and his name was erased from the monuments erected in his honour. The Shah Nameh calls him Arish and erroneously makes him a son of Kai Kobad, but Mirkhond simply refers to him as an officer of that monarch. The Persian name is valuable, as it connects
3<- 1 Chron. iv. 21 ; ii. 42.



THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 321
the Lydian hero with the river of Egypt which formed the boundary between that country and Palestine, and the name of which was Arish, or El Arish. Out of El Arish, which, as the mighty Arish, was a synonym for Ma Reshah, the illustrious Reshah, the Greeks made Larissa, and the Assyrians, Larsa, But, without the adjectives el and ma, the Persian form is the
original of the Greek Ares, the Koriak Arioski, and the Iroquois Areskoui, all of which words denote the god of war, and the Latin Mars is the same with the prefix as in Mareshah. Even the Peruvians had a tradition of this great warrior, whom they called Marasco Pachacuti, who " reigned forty years and lived double that space of time. This prince conquered the barbarians recently come to Peru in a bloody combat, and strengthened the garrisons as far as the banks of the Rimac and Huanuco. Zealous in religion, he opposed the progress of idolatry, and published several
decrees favourable to the worship of his predecessors."^^ Irish history recognizes the valour of Ma Reshah under the name
Milesius, whom it calls, not indeed the son but the near relative of Lughaidh, or Laadah, and the father of Heber, who is Mareshah's son Hebron. His posterity were the Clana Rughraidhe, the most ancient occupants of Uladh, or Ulster. And Milesius himself, who fought unnumbered battles in Scythia, Egypt and Spain, " was, as the chronicles of Ireland give his character, a prince of the greatest honour and generosity, and for courage, conduct and military bravery, the world never saw his equal
since the creation." ^^ He is also the Rothesay of the Scottish chronicle who first brought the Scots to Albion, giving his name to the island on which he landed and calling the others the Hebrides ; nor can his father Laadah be other than the mythical Captain
Lutork who settled in Ross-shire.^" The history of the Welsh Britons gives honour to Laadah as Lud, the founder of London, and Lot, the brother-in-law of Arthur, but consigns Mu Reshah to infamy as their sons Androgens and Modred, while recognizinotheir valour and military skill. This disparagement of the Achashtarite hero by the Welsh is to be accounted for by the fact

that the}'- received their Hittite historj^ from Zerethite Silures, Temenite Damnii Albani, and Hepherite Ottadeni and Demetae, tribes that were anciently at war with those of Achuzam and
Achashtari. All writers on Egyptian history mention Ma Reshah. He is the Moei'is of Herodotus, who places him before Sesostris, and ascribes to him the excavation of the great lake above Memphis, which bore his name. After the death of the cruel Actisanes, sufficiently identified with Jahdai, Marrus became king, according to Diodorus. That author, however, confounds him with Mendes, the avithor of the Labyrinth, and credits him with no conquests.
Eratosthenes gives his name four times in his list of Upper Egyptian Pharaohs, placing him as Mares before Anoyphes, or Anub, as Myrtaeus after Nitocris, as Meres philosophus before Choma Ephta, and as Maris before Siphoas Hermes. In Manetho's twelfth dynasty he appears out of place as Ameres following the Pharaoh of the Labyrinth. But on the monuments he is first
Maire Pepi, or Pepi Merira, the successor of Ati of the sixth dynasty, and secondly a contemporary of Amenemes IIL, with whose name Lake Moeris is associated. In an imperfectly translated inscription on a sarcophagus from the pyramid of Pepi at Sakkara, which contained the mummy of a young man, the name Merenra occurs, and on the pyramid itself there is a statement
that he who erected it had come to avenge his father. Aqpording to Brugsch Pasha, this Merenra, whose surname was Haremsaf was the son of Pepi Merira and Merra-ankmas, his queen, who descended from Khua and his wife Nebet. The brother of Haremsaf Merenra was Noferkara.^^ This genealogy, if correct
in all its particulars, would make doubtful the identity of Pepi Merira and Mareshah. Khua and Nebet are unmistakably Khons and Nephthys, or Coz and Ziphah, but Merra-ankmas cannot be Zobebah, who was their daughter. Haremsaf is most likely Harum, whose posterity in the Kenite genealogy is counted to the family of Coz, but^ tradition in<iicates that this was owing to the marriage of Harum to a daughter of Anub. We shall yet see that Harum did concjuer part of Egypt, and that he was a descendant of Jahdai. The use of the name Pepi prior to the reign

of Jabez, or Apophis, is itself a mystery, although the story of Cybele displays it as the title of the murdei'ed Atys, who was also called Papas. Papaeus was the name of the Scythian Jupiter. ^^ It may be, therefore, that the title descended from Ephah, the son of Achuzam and father of Haran, whose grandson was Jahdai. Jabez is the most glorious character in Hittite history. His name may be read in two ways, as Yaabets, or, following the Septuagint, as Igabes. In Egyptian inscriptions he is generally
called Aahpepi, but in the inscription of the officer Aahmes his
name is correctly given as Aahpeti.^'^ The Egyptian language
could not express more accurately the word recorded by the
Kenite scribe, for it is destitute of the letter z. In Manetho's
sixth dynasty he is called Phiops, the third after Othoes ; and it
is recorded that, beginning to reign in his sixth year, he continued to the age of a hundred. Eratosthenes styles him Apappus, and says that he reigned a hundred years within an hour. He also must be the Sesostris of Manetho's twelfth dynasty, who imme
diately follows that Amenemes whom his eunuchs slew, and who is most fitly represented on the monuments by Amenemes III., the greatest of that line. He is said to have subdued all Asia
and part of Europe, and to have been four cubits, three palms, two fingers in height. But his true place is among the Hycsos or Shepherd Kings, variously constituting the fifteenth and seven
teenth dynasties. There his father Jahdai appears as the leader Saites, the Arabian Sheddad, son of Ad, these Saites and Sheddad being but sibilated forms of that father's name. His uncle Anoob follows, and in one list his relative Acharchel, the son of Harum, precedes, while in another he follows, Aphobis, or Aphophis, as Ai'chles. There is no evidence that Acharchel exercised independent sovereignty in Egypt, so that his 49 years may 'be added to the 61 of Aphobis, to represent the long reign of the latter, and the whole 103 years which Eusebius accords to the Shepherd dynasty may be assigned to Aphophis, instead of the 14 with which he
credits him. The unanimous testimony of ancient writers is that Israel entered Egypt in the seventeenth year of Apophis, and, as Joseph was exalted nine years before that time, the youthful mon

arch, before whom the inspired interpreter stood to tell his dreams,
had been but eight years on the throne.*^ The strono- arm of Ma Reshah and the valour of his Lydian warriors had brought peace to the land. It is not likely that the petty kingdoms were absorbed into one stable empire, for such has rarely been the Hittite rule. Far south in Syene, or Assouan, the Horite monarchy of Zoan was revived. At Abydos the Hepherites of the
line of Beeroth kept their court. The Xoite kingdom in the Delta, over which reigned kings of the family of Anub, was undisturbed. West of the Nile, about lake Moeris, the region of the Amu or Emim constituted the patrimony of king Ma Reshah.
Pelusium was in the hands of the Philistines ; On, in that of the
Japhetic Jerachmeelites descended from Onam ; and at Philae, near Syene, the Kenezzite posterity of Bela, son of Beor, continued
to practise their horrid rites. But the king of kings, emperor,
lord paramount, over all these little royalties was the child Jabez, and his right hand was the warrior Ma Reshah. If we rely upon ancient testimony and find that Jabez was a king from the day of his birth, we see Joseph appeanng before a child in his eighth year. The use of the third person in the address of the chief
butler to Pharaoh, when he said," me Ag' restored unto mine office, and him he hanged," may be simply court etiquette, but again it may point to one different from the youthful monarch, and exer
cisino- sovereignty in his name, in other words, to Ma Reshah, or
Moeris.*^ If this be the case, we may presume that since his act of judgment upon the two officials he had died, and that Joseph
became his successor as the royal adviser and vicero3^ At any rate, we know, from Joseph's calling himself "a father to Pha)-aoh," though he was but thirty years of age when he stood before him, that Jabez must have been at best a youth ; and the fact that Joseph was exalted to the highest position under the king, would
seem to indicate the previous death, or withdrawal from office, of
the Lydian regent. The most important fact in the life of Apophis, and indeed in the history of the ancient world, was his adoption of the pure faith of his prime minister, Joseph. The royal youth, the ingenu

ousness of whose years was yet uncorrupted by the degrading superstitions of his race, perceived that Joseph's God was able to bestow upon his servant wisdom far surpassing that of the priests of Amun and Kheper and Ra. He believed the prophetic interpretation given of his dreams, and acted promptly in accordance with it. The Kenite chronicler says : " Jabez was more honourable than his brethren. And Jabez called on the God of
Israel, saying, that thou would est bless me indeed and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil that it may not grieve me ! And God
granted him that which he requested.""*^ The First Sallier Papyrus, in what is unhappily a much mutilated fi*agment, tells the same story from a foreign inimical standpoint. " It came to pass that the land of Egypt was held by the Aadtous ; there was no sovran master on the day when this came to pass. Then king Sekenen-Ra was ruler in the southern region, the Aadtous in the
district of Amu, their chief. King Apapi, in the city Avaris. The whole land did homage to him with their 'handiwork, paying tribute alike from all good produce of Tameri. King Apapi took to himself Sutech for lord, refusing to serve any other god in the whole land. He built for him a temple of goodly and enduring workmanship. King Apapi appointed festivals, days for makingsacrifice to Sutech, with all rites that are performed in the temple of Ra Harmachis." ** The remainder of the fragment relates the story of a message sent by Apapi to Sekenen Ra in the south, and of the dismay of that king and all his court when they heard it> but the import of the message is doubtful. It is evident, however, that Jabez overthrew idolatry and established throughout Egypt the worship of the one God. This God he called Sutech, which is not a Hittite word, but a form of the Semitic Shaddai, the almighty, the name by which God revealed himself to Abraham and to Jacob, and in whose name Jacob was blessed by his father IsaaC*^ It afterwai ds became, as a loan word, the Hittite
generic term for divinity. The legendary history of Persia confirms the story of the conversion of Jabez, whom it calls Kai

Kobad. A dialectic form of Jabez was Igabes, or more perfectly Igabetz, which became the Greek Aiguptos and Coptos, whence Caphtorim and Cappadocia. Mirkhond makes the absurd statement that Elias, Joshua, Samuel, and Ezekiel, were invested with prophetic dignity in the reign of Kai Kobad, and adds : " He is
also said to have embraced their faith, and to have used all possible exertion to exalt the precepts of the glorious law." The same author mentions his long life and prosperity in the following words : " His authority was then still more cemented by the different classes of the military again solemnly renewing their
allegiance ; in short, during his reign he so widely expanded the
carpets of justice and grace, and the fame of his equity was so extensively diffused, that most of the empires of the world were governed according to his ordinances, regulations, concessions and prohibitions. Notwithstanding such a height of power, this prince continually paid to Heaven his grateful adoration for the distinguished favours and blessings conferred on him ; he always
maintained his subjects in the region of security and the sanctuary of tranquility ; and passed a hundred, or, according to others, one hundred and twenty years, in the possession of transcendant majesty and sovereignty." The Tarikh Maajem says : " When the revolution of his fortune was nearly completed, and the days of his life drew near their destined period ; when he began to think of departing from this sojourn to the abiding place of futurity, and the idea of meeting the Supreme Creator became uppermost in his mind ; that he then, as is the custom of the righteous and of those destined for happiness, bitterly lamented the actions of
his past life and the abuse of the days now gone by ; he folded
his hands in the mantle of eternal grace, and fled to the Lord for refuge ; he prayed to the Almighty for the aid of resignation in the trying hour, and with contrite submission implored mercy and forgiveness :

" I have derived no lasting good from iny existence ; " My actions and words were alike all vanity : " When I had the power of acting, I knew not what was good : " Now that I know what is good, I no longer have the power."*^ In the mythology of the Greeks and Romans, Jabez is repre

sented by Japetus, ^gyptus, and Epaphus, the son of lo, but nothing that may serve to illustrate his reign can be gathered from the accounts of these shadowy personages. In the story of
Bellerophon, which has one important point of contact with that of Joseph, he appears as Jobates, king of Lycia, and father-in-law of Proetus of Argos, in an unenviable light, the enemy for a time of his guest. It is very probable that Proetus, who represents Bered, the son of the Horite Shuthelah, was the son-in-law of Jabez, for his great grandson Tahath, or Thothmes II., married the daughter of Mezahab, the great grandson of that monarch. In Persian story Ferud and Kai Khusrau are made the grandsons, or great grandsons, of Kai Kobad.'*" The officer Aahmes in his inscription tells how his services were regularly transferred from Aahpeti to Thothmes I., who, as the first Tahath, was the son of Bered and grandson of Jabez throuo'h his dauohter, whom the Greeks call Autea, or Sthenoboea. Bellerophon again was the grandson of Sisyphus, Chufn, or Ziph, whom, as Zaub, the Pei'sian historians place immediately before Kai Kobad, and to whom they attribute virtues which there is otherwise no reason to think that monarch possessed. The Indian Scriptures have no trustworthy record of Jabez. The story of the conquering Jayapida of Cashmere, youngest son of the cruel Vappiya, who subdued Kanyakubja and all other lands, excavated a large lake, patronized
and cultivated learning, and in his old age perished miserably for contemning the Brahmans, if intended to represent him, is a cruel travesty of the original.*^ He is also the ancient Vivas vat, the son of Aditi and descendant of Ikshvaku, son of Manu, who is Coz, son of Ammon ; hence Vivasvat is Manu Vivasvata. But Kasyapa, Marichi, Nabhaga and Krishna, with Ikshvaku's king
dom of Ayodhya, are so mixed up in the traditions that nothing can be gathered from them, but that our hero's wife was Sarauyu, and one of his successors was Manu Savarna, or Hebron, son of Ma Reshah.^^ The Mexicans knew Jabez as the venerable chief Opochtli, better known as the god Huitzil Opochtli, who was held in special honour by the Aztecs, and for whom Montezuma I.

built a sanctuary ; but the information their historians have
transmitteil regarding him is vague in the extreme.^° In looking to the Egyptian monuments for the desired knowledge concerning Jabez, much caution must be exercised to secure that there is no mistake in identifying him with Amenemes III., whose monumental record furnishes the chief materials for illustrating his history. There is no doubt that the mother of the great Pharaoh was an Ammonitess, for Egyptian mythology and Greek tradition concur in making Coz the son of Amraon. The Bible name of Thebes is No Amnion, and Amun had a special sanctuary there. Chief among the Theban Pharaohs were the Amenemes or Amun-mesu, children of Amnion ; and the second
of these by his peculiar fate has been identified with Jahdai. The word Thebes itself, being the T'Apet of the Egyptians,
cori'esponds to Jabez, the city in which dwelt the Kenite scribes who provided in their lists the clue to Egyptian chronology. Yet the unanimous testimony of antiquity, received by the best Egyptian scholars of the present day and confirmed by such documents as the First Sallier Papyrus, identifies the royal convert of Joseph with the Hycsos king Apophis, the Apappus Maximus of Eratosthenes, who, reigning a hundred years, is shown to be the same as the Piiiops of Manetho's sixth dynasty, and, therefore, the Pepi, son of Ati,of the corresponding monuments. There is
no inconsistency in a Pharaoh calling himself, or being called by
his scribes, by two different names, especially if he traced his
descent from two distinct royal families. Jabez was on the side of his father a Hittite, to the native Egyptians a member of an intruding and hated race. But on his mother's side he was an Ammonite, thus belonging to a family that had been two generations longer than the Achuzamite Hittites in the possession of regal
authority in the land of the Pharaohs. His great ancestor,
allied with the native line of Horite kings, had attained the eminence of divinity under the name Amun Pia, and the person of the god's progeny was sacred in the sight of the people. Nothing, therefore, could be more natural than that Jabez should assume in his purely Egyptian monuments, intended chiefly for native eyes, the great name of Amun, and that the same should

be given to his unhappy father as entering by marriage into the divinely royal family, thus saving him from the contempt which
would attach to his Hittite designation.
Mr. R S. Poole was the lirst to indicate that most of the early dynasties of Manetho were not succes.sive, but contemporaneous, so that sometimes no fewer than five of these dynasties were on petty thrones together. °^ Professor Rawlinson, a careful student of ancient history, finds that when the Shepherd Kings occupied Egypt there were four other djmasties in that land, Xoite,
Heracleopolite, Theban, and Elephantine.^' In the Theban list he places Amenemes II., who has been identiHed with Jahdai, over against Anoob or Bnon, the brother of Zobebah, his wife, and Amenemes III. over against Apophis. This is almost an accidental
coincidence, but it is a startling one. No record tells that the famous city of Thebes was in the hands of native Pharaohs in the time of Apophis, who was lord of the whole land and commanded the obedience of the only Pharaoh left, namely, Ra Sekenen of Syeue. Manetho gives Amenemes III. a reign of only eight years, which is significant, for in his eighth year Jabez renounced the worship of heathen gods and called on Shaddai, the God of Israel. But Sir Gardner Wilkinson has shown that inscriptions
have been found as late as the ^itli year of his reign. That the
Xoite kingdom existed under the successors of Anub, but tributary to the empire, can hardly be doubted, and the Heracleopolite kingdom was that of Ma Reshah and his sons, for it included lake Moeris. Professor Rawlinson extols the powerful monarchs of this twelfth Theban dynasty, saying that they extended their authority from the borders of Ethiopia to the neighbourhood of Memi)his ;
that they occupied the Sinaitic peninsula, and carried their arms into Arabia and Ethiopia. Lepsius read the name of Amenemes III. on the walls of the Labyrinth and on the stones of the pyramid of Moeris; he found it in the rock grotto near the copper mines in Arabia Petraea ; and, far up the Nile at Semneh, copied the inscriptions which in that monarch's time recorded the height of the river.^^ At Benihassan and El Bersheh in Central

Egypt, the tombs whose paintings afford such an insight into Egyptian life pertain chiefly to the peaceful days of the twelfth dynasty, a golden age for the oft harassed dwellers on the Nile. Nor is there any evidence that Amenemes III. was not lord of all the Delta as well, away eastward to that Arish which bore the name of Ma Reshah. Comparing the achievements of Pepi, the son of Ati, with those of Amenemes, it appears that his monuments have been found in all parts of Egypt from Syene in the south to Tanis or Zoan in the north. He made expeditions towards the cataracts, repelling the Wa Wa negroes, and subduing Bedouin tribes. Passing into Arabia Petraea, he punished the enemies that had molested the miners there. He opened the route across the desert from Gheneh near Tentyra to Kosseir on the Red Sea, making caravan stations along it and causino- wells
to be dug for the benefit of travellers. Wherever the name
.of Amenemes III. is to be found there also that of Pepi Merira may be discovered, or that of Apepi, who is the same illustrious
Pharaoh. If it be objected that some of these inscriptions and the structures on which they appear are ruder, more archaic than others, it may be answered that this is just what might be expected in a reign of one hundred years and in so early a stage in the world's history. Popular tradition in Egypt, and such tradition is valuable when it regards geographical names, associates the name of Joseph with Amenemes III., by calling the canal,
which connects lake Moeris with the Nile, Bahr Jusuf.^* What Sir Gardner Wilkinson wrote many years ago is still true, despite the large additions that have been since made to our knowledge of ancient Egypt. " It would certainly be more agreeable to the writer as well as to the reader of Egyptian
history if the dates of the accession of each king and the events of his reign could be described as established facts, without the necessity of qualifying them by a doubt; but this cannot be done ; and if it is necessary to break the thread of the history by conjectures, the uncertain nature of our authorities must plead an excuseIndeed, we may be well contented to have any approach towards the determination of events that happened in so remote an

age." ^^ With the information we at present possess, information which has been gathered from the monuments to ilhistrate and also to correct the lists of Manetho, but always in reference
to that author, there are difficulties in the way of reconciling Pepi Merira of the sixth dynasty with Amenemes III. of the twelfth. Chief among these is the fact that the Tablet of
Abydos, which sets forth the ancestors of Rameses II., seems to regard the three Osortasens as more ancient than Amenemes III. This tablet, however, was intended to show the relation of
Rameses to four distinct royal families, those, namely, of Amenemes, Osorta.sen, Thothmes, and Amenhotep. These four families are clearly distinguished in the Kenite genealogies. In the Hall of Ancestors at Karnak, the contemporary of Osortasen III. is Laobra, and he is the Kenite Leophrah or Ophrah, son of that Meonothai with whom the Mentahotep or Amenhotep name originated. He was also the grandfather of Seti Menephthah, regent for the second Rameses. This being the case, Osortasen III. cannot possibly have been earlier than Amenemes III., if the latter represent the Pharaoh of Joseph. Manetho places the great famine of Egypt in the reign of Ouenephes or Anub of the first dynasty. Now as Anub was no doubt on the throne of Onuphis in the Delta when his nephew Jabez was reigning as a youth at Memphis, this famine will perfectly coincide with that which brought Israel into Egypt. It was to guard against such
famines, arising from irregularity in the overflow of the Nile, at
one time excessive, so as to drown the crop, at others insufficient,
so as not to irrigate the cultivated land, that the great lake Moeris was built. This lake drained ofl" superfluous waters, or by
outflow in time of drought provided the necessary irrigation. Hence Lepsius has concluded that Joseph must have been in Egypt at a time when the great work of Amenemes III. had been
suflered to fall into decay, thus rendering a famine possible. ^"^ It
is a mere hypothesis of the illustrious German scholar, and a hypothesis without foundation of fact. The famine furnished the suggestion that such a reservoir as lake Moeris was necessary, and its connection with the nanie of Amenemes III. goes far towards making that monarch the Pharaoh of Joseph.
55 Rawlinson's Herodotus, App. Bk. ii. ch. 8. 56 Egypt, Ethiopia and Sinai, 481.



332 THE HITTITES.
Who were the Osortasens ? There is a document of great value called the Instructions of Kina: Amenemhat I. to his son Usertesen I., of which there are several copies.^" In it the old king speaks
of his earlier years as a time f)f war and rebellions, but gives him
self credit for l)eing the benefactor of his people. In addressing
Usertasen, he says, "From a subject I have raised thee," and "Behold ! what made thee king is what I made be." This is not
the lanouaoe of a Pharaoh to his son, f(jr by their birth the children of Egyptian monarchs w^ere not only royal personages, but divine. In Usertasen or Osortasen we must, therefore, recognize an adopted son or .son-in-law of Amenemes. Amenemes, being a son of Ammon, can be no other than Coz, and Greek legendary history, which knows him as lacchus and Bacchus, furnishes the desired connection of Osortasen. Theseus, w^ho has been identified with Hadad, the son of Bedad, visited Crete and there became enamoured of Ariadne, the daughter of Minos and Pasiphae, whom he carried to Naxos and there deserted, whereupon Bacchus took her in mari-iage and she bore to him a son, OEnopion. This much mixed up story confuses Minos or Ammon with his son Ooz, who married the Zerethite or Cretan Ziphah, called Pasiphae in the tradition, and atjain makino- Coz as Bacchus, the father of Anub or CEnopion bj' Ariadne, causes him to marry his own daughter. The Kenite genealogy makes no mention of any other da\ighter of Coz than Zobebah, and it does not appear that she had married previous to her union with Jahdai. We must, therefore, suppose the existence of a second daughter named Avith or Aphidnae, the wife of Hadad, whom theEgyptians called Osortasen^
a disguised inversion of Hadadezer. And, first of all, the presence of the family of Beeroth in Egypt and in the time of Coz is vouched for by the name of Boethos in Manetho's second dynasty, immediately preceding that of Kaiechos or Choos. It is stated that in the time of this Boethos a great opening of the ground took
place at Bubastis, in which many perscms perished. This is an echo of the same calamity to which Diodorus refers in his Naxian history, which represents Butes the son of Boreas throwing himself into a well. The Romans preserved the name of Bedad as Mettus Curtius, who sprang full armed into the yawning chasm in the
'^ Records of the Past, ii. 9.



THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 333
Forum. The name of Boethos on the monuments is Butau, and his successor is Hatet'a.^^ But the simple form of Hadad's name in Egyptian is Teta, and he it was that disputed the empire with Ati, Othoes, or Jahdai. It is worthy of note that Teta was accepted as the legitimate king by the compilers of the Tablet of Sakkara, and of the Second Tablet of Abydos, for Abydos was the principal or original Avith in which Hadad the son of Bedad held his court. Still more convincing is the fact that the name of Teta is found on the steles of Amenemes I. and Osortasen I.^^ A surname of the Osortasens which descended to some Thothmes is Ra Cheper ka, in which the word Cheper denotes the same divinity as Khepera Sutech, who is Chepher, the ancestor of the Beerothite and Hamathite families. The Beerothite origin of the
Osortasens, among whom the great Sesostris figures, was probably the cause of the statement in the Paschal Chronicle, that Sesostris,
having conquei'ed the Scythians, sent a colony of 15,000 of them
into Persia, where they were known as Parthidians.*^*^ It is hard to understand why Coz set aside his son Anub and recognized Hadad as his colleague and successor; yet opposition to his wife's family must have had much to do with this conduct. The Greek story of the Minotaur which devoured human beings and was called the offspring of Pasiphae, seems to point to the fact that enmity arose between Coz and his brother-in-law Ziph, the Zerethite builder of the great pyramid, and that Anub, and perhaps his mother Ziphah, sympathized with that tyrant, whereupon the warrior Hadad, as the Greek Theseus, glad to oppose the
enemies of his Beerothite family, took service under Coz and overthrew tl*ft Zerethites in Egypt as well as in Palestine, being thus the slayer of the Minotaur and the destroyer of Typhon. As Osortasen I. his forty-fourth year is found on the monuments. Durinof manv of these vears he was co-reo'ent with Amenemc^ I. or Coz, and the second year of Amenemes II. or Jahdai corresponds with his last. But Amenemes II. is said to have reigned
after this, thirty-three years, which is inconsistent Avith all
traditions. The second Osortasen has but three years assigned

him, which are said to be contemporaiy with the three last years of Amenemes II. The monuments ot" these latter monarchs were found in the desert near Kosseir, on the Red Sea, opposite to Tentyris and Abydos.^^ Osortasen II. must thus represent Rehob
or Rehoboth, the son of Hadad and father of Saul, for he is the third Osortasen whom Thothmes III. at Semneh, and .Thothmes IV. at Amada, worshipped as a god. Lieblein's researches into Egyptian chronology have established the most intimate chronological, but otherwise indefinite, relations between Pepi Merira and the first Osortasen and the third Amenemes. Already it has been indicated that Teta, who was Pepi's predecessor, has his name on steles of Amenemes I. and Osortasen I. But Chroti, a contem
porary of Pepi, is also on a stele of the first Osortasen.^^ Chroti also is found with Mentuhotep, with whom the Antefs, generally placed in the time of the Twelth Dynasty, are connected, and Antef-anx is the wife of Pepi.^^ As Pepi is called Merira, so Amenemes III. bears the name Mara or Maura, and on one of his steles a contemporary Satisi is mentioned as a son of Osortasen I. or Ra Cheper ka.^* It is evident that the monuments of Pepi and of Amenemes III. must be attributed to Jabez, thus illustratinor the
reign of the greatest of the Pharaohs.

CHAPTER VIII.
The Hittites in Egypt. —(Continued).
EwALD recognizes the story of Jabez as one of great antiquity although he does not solve its mystery nor rise above the Jewish tradition that the lad who called upon the God of Israel was a wise doctor of laws/ His long reign made him outlive his son Mesha and his grandson Ziph, so that his immediate successor was the son of Ziph, named Mezahab, who in Manetho's sixth dynasty is called Menthesuphis. In that dynasty he immediately follows
Phiops of the hundred years, and is succeeded by Nitocris, a queen. So in the twelfth dynasty, the last Amenemes precedes Scemiophris,
called his sister. Herodotus tells a romancing story of this queen
Nitocris, to the effect that some of his subjects having killed the
king, her brother, and appointed her his successor, she invited the conspirators to a banquet in an underground chamber, into which, by a secret channel, she let the waters of the Nile, thus drowning them all ; after which she smothered herself in a room full of ashes.2 That Mezahab was put to death seems to be borne out by tradition, but that his daughter Hatred avenged him in the manner indicated, and that she committed suicide, there seems
to be no other reason for believing. To return to the son of Jabez, named Mesha : he is the Amos or Amosis of Manetho's eighteenth dynasty, and his name has been read on the monuments as Aahmes. It is, however, capable of being read Mesaah, which is the true
form, as even the Amosis of Manetho indicates, the prosthetic a being placed there so as to prevent the Jews claiming the Pharaoh as their prophet Moses. In a remarkable passage in the Catalogue of the kings of Armenia, it is stated that Meesak was a relative of the Armenian Aram, and that another king of that country named Kegham, banished Paiapis, prince of Cappadocia, and left Meesak

336 THE HITTITES.
as his deputy on the throni.^ In another Armenian history the line of Haic and Aram contains the name of Mezahab disguised as Manavaz.* Mesha, or Meshag, was the eponym of the Cappadocian Moschi, who gained their name of Cappadocians or Caphtorim from Jabez or Igabets. It is not likely that Jabez lost his throne,
but it is certain that his son Mesha did not follow' in his father's
footsteps, for we read that he left an inscription in the twenty
second year of his vice-regal sway at Masarah, near Cairo, stating that stones had been taken from the quarries there for the temples of the Memphite Ptah and the Theban Amun.^ Mesha had the government of Nubia, and to strengthen himself in that region
married an Ethiopian princess, black but comely, called Nofre-t-ari. But an insurrection broke out in the north, the centre of which was Tanis or Zoan, which most writers have regarded as the act of the Shepherd Kings. It was quelled, we are told, by Aahmes, and the Shepherds were expelled, but for this there is no adequate authority. For in the first place the two documents supposed to relate to Aahmes set forth Neb-pehti-ra, who is Ziph the son of Mesha, the initial Neb representing Ziph as Nebet and Nephthys represent Ziphah, and the following Pehti being an abbreviation of
Aahpeti, his grandfather's name. The officer Aahmes Pennishem states that he followed the king Neb-pehti-ra and his successors Ra-tser-ka, Ra-tser-kheper, Ra-aa-kheper, and Ra-aa-en-kheper, but he also states that he was contemporary with Aapehti or Jabez. " I never left the king out of sight from the king of Upper and Lower
Egypt, Ra Aapehti, the justified, to the king of Upper and Lower
Egypt, Ra Aakheperu, the justified. I was living in the daj^s of the reio-n of the king, ending under the king of Upper arid Lower Egypt, Ra Menkheper, the ever living." ^ The last of these kings is said to be Thothmes III. The other document is the inscription of Aahmes, son of Abana, a captain general of marines. He tells that he was born at Eilethyia, some distance to the south of Thebes, and that his father was an officer of king Sekenen Ra, belonging to

the line of ancient Egyptian monarchs mentioned in the first Sallier papyrus. Aahmes, however, was the officer first of Ziph or NebPehti-Ra, and accompanied him, not his namesake Aahmes or Mesha, to Tanis, where he fought against an unnamed enemy. After taking Tanis, the officer of marines tells of the siege of Sharhana, supposed to be Sharuhen in Palestine, and of the return to Nubia. Aahmes continued to serve Sorkara, Aa-Cheper-kara, and some later Pharaoh, under whom he fought the Rutennu and Naharina of Mesopotamia.'^ Neb-Pehti-Ra has generally been
identified with Aahmes, but his name plainly declares his relation to Aahpeti or Jabez, and his personality as his grandson Ziph. Again there is no mention of the Shepherd Kings in these inscriptions, or in any document bearing the name of Aahmes. Apion, the Alexandrian adversary of the Jews, made the assertion that Ames drove the Hycsos from Avaris, but Manetho, as quoted by Josephus, calls their conqueror Thummosis, son of Alisphragmuthosis.^ Dr. Wiedemann, in a communication to the Society of
Biblical Archaeology, cites the names, as he thinks, of several Hycsos kings, nearly all of which contain the word Nub.^ The Egyptian nub means gold, and is the equivalent of the Semitic zaJiab, which appears in the name of Mezahab, the son of Ziph, so that neb is more likely to represent the latter. One Hycsos name, Ra-nub-neb, unites the tv/o forms, and others are Ra-nub, Ra-ennub, Ra-nub-maa, Ra-nub-maa-nefer, Ra-nub-peh. These all relate to Ziph, the son of Mesha, and to his son Mezahab. The connection of the two names Ziph and Mezahab, which are not conjoined in the Kenite record, is found in the Metapontine tradition, which makes Metabus the son of Sisyphus. The sanction of this tradition is the vicinity to Metapontum of the Messapian Japygians, who dwelt in Apulia, to the north and east of that city, and whose name combines those of Jabez and Mezahab. Some mystery attaches to Mesha or Aahmes. Already he has
appeared as a restorer of idolatry, and Armenian tradition represents him as superseding his father under the name of Meesak,
for Paiapis, prince of Cappadocia, can be no other than Jabez, the

Pepi of the monuments, and the Phiops and Apophis of Manetho. His descent is traced, not from his father, but from Mentuhotep of the thirteenth dynasty, a dynasty that is supposed to have taken refuge in Ethiopia when the Hycsos settled in Egypt. Dr. Birch was of the opinion that Aahmes fled for similar reasons to the court of these kings, and there married the black queen Ames-nofre-tari, the mother of Amenhotep I. The Nubian or Ethiopian kingdom was really that which Manetho calls the Elephantine. It embraced Syene, Philae, and Kenes, and extended northward to Eileithyia. Its founder was Kenez, who is identified with the Shepherds by his appearance in Manetho's lists of these kings under the name Pachnan, or Apachnas. He follows Anoob or Bnon, and is succeeded by Staan. He is also the Sekenen Ra who is mentioned in the first Sallier papyrus as receiving a message from Jabez. His descent must be traced from Nehabah or Dinhabah, the son of Bela of Beor, whose posterity we left in Chaldea, whence, however, they seem to have migrated along with
other Hittite families into Egypt. Kenez or Sekenen had thus no right to call himself a native Pharaoh, but his presence at
Syene, a southern Zoan,is indicative of his union with the ancient Horite line of Manahath or Menes, whose grandson was Zaavan.
The Greek traditions recognized the Hittite relation.ship of Jabez and Dinhabah by calling them the brothers, .^gyptus and Danaus, and rightly set forth their enmity. But these traditions also
symbolized the union of the families by the marriage of the fifty sons of .^gyptus to the fifty daughters of Danaus ; all of the brides putting their husbands to death, with the exception of Hypermnestra, who spared Lynceus, and thus cemented the
alliance contrary to her father's will. It is in the person of Mesha or Aahmes that this union must be found. The sons of Kenaz, the descendant of Dinhabah, were'Othniel and Seraiah. The latter is the Soris of Manetho's fourth dynasty, who immediately precedes Souphis or Chufu of the great pyramid. The error of Manetho in placing him thus early arose from the fact that Joab, a name nearly approaching Souphis or Cheops, was the son of Seraiali. He is mentioned again in the fifth Elephantine dynasty
as Sisires. There his son Joab finds no mention, for ('heres,
representing Charash the son of Joab, immediately follows his



THE HITTITE^ IX EGYPT. 339
grandfather. Ombos and Korusko are memorials of Joab and his son in the Nubian kingdom. The other son of Kenaz was Othniel or Gothniel, a name that no doubt furnished the oricrinal of the Greek Sthenelus. He is the Staan who follows Pachnan or Apachnas in the Shepherd list. He had no sons, but a daughter Hathath or Chathath, famous in after years as the licentious
goddess Cotys or Cotytto, who was originally a deity of the Edonian Thracians, but whose rites were celebrated in many [jarts
of Greece. She was also as Xochite-catl, the phallic goddess of the Aztecs. "When Mesha or Aahmes married her she must have been a widow, for the father of her son Meonothai or Megonothai was Abiezer, the son of Hammoleketh, who was a sister of Gilead.^** M. Lenormant makes Hatasu, who is this Hathath, the dauohter of Thothmes I., and the regent for her brothers Thothmes II. and III. This must be an error, for Othniel, not Tahath, was her father, and her son Meonothai is the Egyptian Amenhotep. Tabari bears evidence in a confused way to the union of the line of Jabez with that of Othniel. The former he calls Kabous,and styles the Pharaoh of Joseph, tracing his descent fromAmalek son of Lud through Mosab, Maouya, Nemir, Salwas, and Amru.^^ Elsewhere he ma;kes Joseph's Pharaoh Walid's sonRayyan, and derives Walid from Masab of Moouna of Abou Gayar of Aboul Halwas of Leith of Haran of Omar of Amalek.^- Moouna, son of Abou Gayar, is Meonothai son of Abiezer, and Mosab or Masab is Mezahab. As for Walid, he is Pelet the son of Jahdai, and Haran is Jahdai's grandfather. Amenhotep traced his descent not from Aahmes, but from the Sekenen Res to whose line his mother belonged, but one of his ovals bears the name Sebekara, which is probably thatof his father Abiezer. The voice of tradition gives Abiezer to the family of the Babylonian Hammurabi, whose descendant Samlah of Masrekah seems to have married Gilead's sister Hammoleketh, and to have been by her the father of Ishchod, Abiezer and Mahalah. In Greek mythology he is Actor son of Myrmidon, and father of Menoetius, who is also called the son of Phorbas and grandson of Lapithus. This descent connects him with Rapha or
1" 1 Chron. iv. 13, 14 ; vii. 18. 11 Tabari, 261. 12 Tabari, 210.



340 THE HITTITES.
Hammurabi, while the name of his wife Molione is that of his brother Mahalah, and the name of his son Cteatus reproduces that of his historical wife Chathath. The name of the son and successor of Samsuiluna or Samlah in the Babylonian list has been read as Ebisum, but whether it is capable of being rendered by anything more nearly approaching Abiezer is hard to say. The descendants of Abiezer and Hathath figure in Egyptian history, their son being Meonothai or Amenhotep, and his, Ophrah, Leophrah or Laobra ; the son of Laobra is Ishi or Ishgi, and from him descend Zocheth and Ben Zocheth. Although Mesha married the widow of Abiezer, he seems to have had no posterity by her, so that the claim of Amenhotep to be his successor was founded on the adoptive relation wliich
Mesha sustained to his step son. He had another wife, however, a fair queen named Aahotep, who, when represented on the monument with Nofre-t-ari, always occupies a subordinate position, and this queen must have been the mother of Ziph or Neb-Ea.
Persian history tells his story, making him correctly the grandson of Kai Kobad, but calling his father Mesha by the unconformable name Kai Kous, better suited to his maternal ancestor Coz. As Siyawesh or Siavesek he is the son of the first wife of Kai Kous, who afterwards marries Soodabeh the daughter of Zual-az-ghar, king of Yemen.^^ Like Joseph, Peleus, Bellerophon,
and Hippolytus, he resists the temptation of his father's second
wife, who falsely accuses him to her husband. Even after passing the ordeal of tire and being justified, Siyawesh, smarting under the imputation, leaves the court and conducts an army against the immortal Afrasiab of Turkestan, chief enemy in all generations of the throne of Iran. The Turkish monarch agrees to what the Persian prince regards as honourable conditions of peace, but his father Kai Kous repudiates the treaty, and orders his son to break
his word. This Siyawesh refuses to do, and, knowing his father's anger, he gives the command of the army to one of his generals and takes up his abode with the Turkish king, whose daughter Ferangiz he marries. Envious of his prosperity, the Turkish nobles calumniate him to Afrasiab, who, relying on the truth of
their statements, commands him to be put to death. He is acoord

ingly executed and his wife Ferangiz flees to a remote part of her father's dominions with her infant son Kai Khusrau. The Greek
legends relating to Ziph are totally different. In one of them,
which is the introduction to the story of the Seven against Thebes, Ziph is (Edipus of the swollen feet, but his descent from Laius of Labdacus of Polydorus of Cadmus, if it contain any truth at all, must set forth his maternal ancestry in the line of the Horite Etam or Getam. His mother, however, is called Jocasta the daughter of Menoeceus,and she is truly his father Mesha's second \vife(>hathath, not the daughter, but the mother of Meonothai. As an oracle
had foretold the death of Laius at the hand of his offspring, the child was exposed, but was preserved by a herdsman, who brought him to Polybus king of Corinth. Arriving at manhood, he went forth to find his parents, and slew his father Laius in a dispute over the right of way. Immediately the Sphinx appeared before Thebes and devoured the people of that city. Creon, the rother
of Jocasta, was on the throne, and offered his widowed sister and the kingdom to the slayer of the monster. (Edipus succeeded in the enterprise and married his own mother. Sir George Cox shows that the companion story to that of (Edipus is the legend of Telephus, king of Mysia.^^ His mother was Auge the daughter
of Aleus of Tegea. and his father, a mythic Hercules. He was exposed on Parthenion and brought up by the Arcadian Corythus, while his mother was carried away to Mysia and sold to king Teuthras of Teuthrania. Thither as a man he went to find her, and, according to one version, was offered his unknown
mother in marriage on condition that he killed Idas, the enemy of Teuthras. He performed this service, but Auge refused to marry him, whereupon Teuthras himself took her to wife, and Telephas married his daughter Argiope. In another tradition, Ziph is the Ethiopian king Cepheus, called by Herodotus the son of Belus, although there was a Cepheus the son of Aleus of Tegea. His wife Cassiepea by pride of her beauty called down the
vengeance of the goddesses, who sent a sea monster to ravage the land and devour the people. The oracle of Ammon being consulted, commanded Cepheus to expose his daughter Andromeda to be destroyed by the dragon. This was done, when Perseus

appeared, slew the monster, and delivered the princess, Cepheus betrothed his daughter to the hero, which roused the anger of his nephew Pliineus, to whom Andromeda had been previously promised. Perseus overcame and carried off his bride, but only after a severe contest with the warriors of Phineus^ which Ovid spiritedly describes. He names the warriors, among whom appear Phorbas, the son of Methion of Syene, Celadon of Mendes, Amphimedon of Libya, Lycabas of Syria, and Ethemon the Nabataean.^^ These are not imaginary characters, but names that were sung first in Italy in Etruscan and Sabine verse. The Messapian Japygians doubtless knew them well, all confused as they were in coming down the ages. Still one more Greek legend must account for the name Telephus, which does not harmonize with Ziph. It is that of the Taphians, who were also
called Teleboans. Apollodorus tells the story. Mestor and Electryon were two sons of Perseus. To Mestor, Lysidice, the daughter of the long defunct Pelops, bore a daughter Hippothoe, who was carried ofi' by Poseidon, and became the mother of Taphius the chief of the Teleboans, a numerous family, so called because they had been taken far from their native land. Electryon had nine sons whose names need not be specified, Mestor and Electryon had reigned together in Mycene, but, by the departure of Taphius to the Teleboan islands, the latter had been left in sole possession of the kingdom. Taphius, however, returned and claimed the throne of his father Mestor. Electryon refused to surrender it, and the Taphians carried ofi' his cattle. The nine sons of the king of Mycene pursued the robbers, but were all killed with the exception of Licymniusi Amphitryon, a nephew of Electryon, being the son of his brother Alceus and Hipponoine the daughter of Menocceus, brought back the cattle from the Elian Polyxenus, with whom they had been left by the Taphians, and afterwards accidentally killed his uncle. Then he made war on the Taphians and overcame them. It is not easy to .see the way clearly through this apparently
contradictory mass of tradition, although there would be no
difficulty in finding it full of solar mythology. A passage of genuine history sheds light upon the path of the pragmatizer.
^ Metamorphoses, iv., v.



THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 343
In the Kenite record we find these valuable words, few, but full of meaning, when divested of their editorial connections : " And the sons of Ephraim, Shuthelah and Bered his son, and Tahath his son, and Eladah his son, and Tahath his son. And Zabad his son, and Shuthelah his son, and Ezer and Elead, whom the men of Gath that were born in that land slew^ because they came down to take away their cattle. And Ephraim their father mourned many days and his brethren came to comfort him. And when he went in to his wife she conceived and bare a son, and he called his name Beriah because it went evil with his house." ^^ Beyond the fact that one of the sons of Ephraim, an Egyptian prince as Joseph's son, was called Shuthelah after another Egyptian prince, the patriarch has nothing to do with the part of the genealogy here recorded. Tahath, the father of the slain, was the man who mourned, and not the supposititious Ephraim of seven generations back. It is the old story of the Seven against Thebes, which was mixed up in many traditions with that of the Beerothite and Zerethite war, popularly known as the siege of
Troy. But the contestants in this case are the petty kingdoms of Egypt formerly kept in subjection by the strong arm of Jabez, on the one hand, and the descendants of that great Theban monarch on the other. The marriage of a daughter of Jabez and a sister of Mesha to Bered the son of Shuthelah, the Cadmonite, gave her son Tahath, the first Thothmes, a claim to universal sovereignty ; and the second union of Mesha with the widow of Abiezer made Meonothai, the first Amenhotep, dispute the right of Ziph, the lawful heir but the son of an inferior wife, to inherit empire. Thus the Kenezzites or Sekenens, represented by Amenhotep, and the Etamites, represented by the Thothmes, became the opponents of the Jabezites or Amenemes in the struggle for sovereignty. The pretenders were apparently aided by the Beerothites under Saul of Rehoboth, or, to use Egyptian
phraseology, by the Osortaseus. Two Hittite dynasties and one
of Horite origin were in league against the Amenemes of Thebes

(Edipus is but one index to the corruption of morals that succeeded the apostacy of the descendants of Jabez. The short record of the death of Tahath's sons carries us into a region which has furnished romantic tales to many lands and ages. Tahath was no Hittite, but his story is so intimately connected with that of the Hittites in Egypt that it cannot be passed by. His ancestor Shutheiah was the son of Jezreel, the son of Etam, and Etam or Getam, the Cadmus of the Greeks and Gautama of the Indians, stands in a double relation to Achumai or Khem, the Indian Yama and Persian Djemscbid, who descended from Keaiah son of Shobal, and to Akan, the Greek Agenor and Indian Agni, grandson of Reaiah's brother Manahath. This explains the worship of Atmoo or Re Athom by the Thothmes, and the Indian connection of Agni and the Divodasas. It was in the time of Etam and his son Jezreel that the Shepherds or Hittites came and drove the Horite family into the south, partitioning its kingdom among them. Etam represents Manetho's king Timaeus, in whose reign the invasion took place, but the Persian Djemschid, slain by Zohak, is Achumai or Khem, his relative, while the true Osiris is Etam's son Jezreel, the sown of God, although the later Hadadezers adopted the Osirian name and located his myth at their Avith or Abydos, for the ancestor of Osiris was the Horite Seb, and Chemmis was associated with his tracjic fate.^'^ A daughter of Etam married Pelet son of Jahdai and bore him a son named Maachah, the ancestor of the Maachathites, afterwards of Megiddo near Jezreel, and this Maachah is the Macedo whom Diodorus makes a son of Osiris. By this marriage Pelet acquired great dignity, so that in Greek story he became Polydeukes or Pollux, twin brother of Castor or Achashtari, in the family of the Dioscuri ; but as lord of the underworld to which Osiris belonged, he was Pluto and Polydegmon, the Indian Paulastya and Egyptian Balot of the mysteries. His wife Hazelelponi was to the Greeks Persephone the daughter of Ceres, for
Ceres itself is l>ut a form of Jezreel like the modern Zeraheen. By this marriage also Pelet became Polydorus, son of Cadmus, and through it his name became associated with the mournful
story of Osiris as Balder son o^ Odin, whom his brother slew.
" Kenrick, vol. i.



THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 845
A volume would not tell the story of the Osirian line, as many
widely separated peoples set it forth in their traditions. Sir George Cox has shown that the cup of Ceres, the basket of the Welsh Gwyddno Garanhir, the jar found by Epiteles at Ithome, the goblet of Djemschid, and the Arthurian Sangreal, mysterious
and never failing, all relate to one thing, and to these he adds the lotus flower, which in Indian mythology is Pedma and in that of the Egyptians is sacred to Nofre Atmoo.^^ The connection is plain when sought for by the Kenite key, for Etam is there in Gwyddno, Ithome, Djemschid, Pedma and Atmoo, while Jezreel
is Ceres, Garanhir, and Greal. And this lost cup, spiritualized by union with Christian tradition and immortalized in the verse of England's greatest living poet, a cup worth traversing the world and braving all its dangers to find, symbolized Horite empire in the land of the Pharaohs, rudely snatched away by Hittite hands, and, to the people longing for the return of their ancient rulers, it was the little kingdom far up the Nile in which dwelt the descendants of Etam's son, biding their time till the strong heir of Heth and Ammon should weaken, and the children of the lotus come to
their own again. Shuthelah. son of Jezreel, and his immediate successors, do
not seem to have resisted the rule of Jabez. If the Persian Dabistan is to be believed when it says that Kai Kobad was aided by the Tartar Hestial, who is Shuthelah, the contrary was the
case.^^ Bered, again, who was Shuthelah's son, is the Greek Proetus, whose double relation to Jabez as the son of Abas and son-in-law of Jobates, shows his alliance with the ruling Pharaoh, as does the Persian story, which makes him a brother of Kai
Khusrau. It is difficult to determine where the posterity of Jezreel dwelt. The god Thoth, who originated with Jahath, son of Reaiah and father of Achumai, and whose name their Tahath better rendered, was originally worshipped at Eshmun or Hermopolis, but this worship probably belonged to a later period, for the memorials of the first Thothmes, who is Tahath son of Bered and the daughter of Jabez, are found far up the Nile at Kerman, opposite the island of Tombos. Thus the Elephantine kingdom of

Syene lay between his province and the Theban capital. Thothmes is said to have warred in Palestine and Mesopotamia, inaugurating the Asiatic conquests of the Egyptians. If he did
so, it must have been as the general of his father-in-law Jabez, still firmly seated on his imperial throne. Mesha and he must have been contemporaries during part of their lives, for the Greek tradition, representing the former as Mestor, makes him a brother of Tahath's son Eladah orElgadah,whom it terms Electryon. From the materials that legendary history afford, it would seem that Jabez and his son married into the old Egyptian line, but whether it was that part of it which reigned in Dongola, or that which was in subjection to the Kenezzites of Elephantine and Syene, is not 3^et determined. One wife of Pepi was Antefanx,
and analogy would place her in the latter division of the family, connecting her name with that of the ancestral Manahath through Zaavan. These marriages, instead of strengthening the
claims of Jabez' descendants, weakened them, for the Hittite rule of matriarchy made Tahath, the son of the great Pharaoh's daughter whom the Greeks called Antea and Sthenoboea, a formidable aspirant to sovereignty. By these unions also Mesha and his son Ziph were drawn into idolatry, and the former was
apparently alienated for a time from his father as well as from his religion. Ziph seems to have been disowned by his father Mesha, and to have been brought up by his grandfather Jabez, who survived him. The latter part of that long reign of a hundred years granted to the son of Zobebah must have been embittered by the idolatry and strife of his descendants, but there is no evidence that he ever relaxed his hold upon the sceptre of Egyptian empire. With his death came the deluge. There is ample authority for making the immediate successor of Jabez his groat-grandson Mezahab, the Menthesuphis who follows Phiops of a hundred years in Manetho's sixth dynasty. The name Mezahab read as a Semitic word means the golden, and has been thus translated in that of the Greek Acrisius, whose descent is traced through Abas and Lynceus to ^gyptus ; and an analogous form is that of the Persian Kai Khusrau, who is derived through Siavesek and Kai Kous from Kai Kobad. Dr. Birch read the name of Mezahab on a statue at Turin as Horemheb,



THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 847
the father of Mutnetem, and the last of his race. 2° Hor Maanub, seeing he called himself the golden Horus, is a preferable form of the name, most of the elements of which are in Ra-nub-maa, who is known to have been a Hycsos king. He is probably the Menephron of Ovid and the Menophres of Hyginus, who charge him with the crime of (Edipus. The addition of ra, the sun, to Manub, the Egyptian equivalent of the Semitic Mezahab, would yield Manubra. He was the father of Nitocris, according to the lists, but on the monuments, as at Abydos and elsewhere, her name may be read as Mykera or Mytera. She is thus the Hatred of the Kenite list, and her name, if Semitic, is derived from
rnatar, rain. In the tablet of Abydos this queen is represented as the wife of Thothmes II., who is the second Tahath and the son of Eladah. The claim of his family to the Egyptian throne was strengthened by this second alliance of a Tahath with the line of Jabez. It is very unlikely that Matred was the mother of Zabad, since he had three sons, Shuthelah, Ezer, and Elead, who died with their father before the walls of Thebes, before Beriah, the youngest son of Tahath, was born. Beriah was the child of Matred, and he is the Perseus of Greek story. The stoiy of his birth is that Danae his mother, the daughter of Acrisius and Eurydice daughter of Lacedemon, was shut up in a brazen tower, because it was foretold that her offspring would be fatal to
Acrisius. But Jupiter visited her in a shower of gold, and her son Perseus was born. Her father then placed Danae and the
child in a coffer and sent it forth to sea, thus intending to destroy them, but the winds and waves drifted the ark to the island of Seriphos, where Dictys received it and took its occupants to his home. Polydectes, brother of Dictys, whom he had dethroned, wished to marry Danae. However, he waited till Perseus was grown up, and then, to get him out of the way, sent him on a mad errand after the head of the Gorgon Medu.sa. Perseus suc
ceeded in his perilous task, and, rapidly returning to Sei'iphos, to find his mother seeking protection at the altar from the pursuit of Polydectes, he turned the Gorgon's face upon that monster, transforming him to stone, set Dictys on the throne thus vacated, and took his mother home to Argos. On the way

home he stopped at Larissa, where Teutamas the king was celebrating games, in which the young hero took part with such success that Acrisius came to see the champion. A misdirected quoit struck the old monarch, and Perseus caused the death of his grandfather, and inherited the kingdom. In this story, Lacedemon, the father of the wife of Acrisius, is probably Elgadah, the son of one Tahath and the father of another. Acrisius, a
corruption of chryseos, golden, is Mezahab, and Danae, visited by the rain of gold, is Hatred. Jupiter and Teutamas of Larissa are equally the second Thothmes, and Perseus is Beriah or Berigah. Even Dictys and Polydectes are Zocheth and Ben Zocheth, grandsons through Ishi or Ishgi, of the Elephantine Laobra.^^ The association of Perseus with the stones illustrating the histories of Mesha and Ziph, is an anachronism of the worst description, which arose out of the great fame of the hero,
causing poets and other story tellers to ascribe to him and to
his posterity all the great events and chief names of the age in which he lived. The Egyptian story of Mezahab, as told by Herodotus, is that
he was assassinated by his nobles and avenged by his .sister Nitocris, who drowned the murderers. The Persian account of Kai Khusrau, son of Siavesek, is a mixture of two opposite
traditions. To avenge his father's murder he engaged in hostilities with the mythical Afrasiab, his chief general being Gudarz,
son of Kishwad, who is really Hadar the Beerothite, an ally of
the enemies of the kings of Thebes. It has already been shown how the two expeditions of Gudarz, the first unfortunate, the second victorious, represent the two sieges of Thebes from the side of its foes. The other chief event in the life of Kai Khusrau is his abdication and disappearance in a foreign land. This is probably historical, for many Indian tribes have a similar legend concerning him. The Pueblo tribes of New Mexico regard Montezuma as the very essence of goodness and the great bene
factor of their race. He was the founder of Acoma and Pecos,
two of their cities, and for a time reigned over the tribes. At
last he departed from them, i)rophesying before he went of a

time of great drought and famine that was to come, and of their enslavement by oppressive invaders. Planting a tree upside down, he told his subjects to keep the sacred fire burning until the tree should fall, when he would return with an army of
white people, destroy their enemies, and restore former prosperity. Dr. Short says : " For generations these strange architects and
faithful priests have waited for the return of their god—looked for him to come with the sun and descend by the column of smoke which rose from the sacred fire. As of old, the Israelitish watcher upon Mount Seir replied to the inquiry " What of the night ? " " The morning cometh," so the Pueblo sentinel mounts the housetop at Pecos and gazes wistfully into the east for the golden appearance, for the rapturous vision of his redeemer, for Montezuma's return ; and though no ray of light meets his
watching eye, his never-failing faith, with cruel deception, replies " The morning cometh." -- Mexican history knows three Montezumas, the well-known historical character, and two of earlier date. The first of these is the Montezuma who reigned over the great city of Chicomoztoc, which some have identified with the " Casas grand es de Montezuma " on the river Gila. He was a harsh and oppressive king who laid heavy burdens on his people and the Aztec Mexicans, so that the latter and many discontented ones among the former left his dominions under the leadership of his son Chalchiuh Tlatonac, whom Opochtli inspired, to find a home elsewhere. Tiie second Montezuma is said to have been gne of the greatest Mexican kings, who, during his reign of twenty-nine years, brought his kingdom to a pitch of prosperity before unknown. His surname was Ilhuicamina, and the name of his father, Chimalpopoca, neither of which show connection with the story of Mezahab. Moreover he is reported to have
died as recently as 1469 A.D. But it is remarkable that he should have set aside his son, whose name even is not mentioned
in the codices, in favour of his grand-children, the offspring of his
daughter Atotoztli, the waterfall, and Tezozomoc, son of Itzco
huatl. This certainly looks like the importation of the Egyptian history of Mezahab, who in the same way preferred the child of his daughter Matred and his son-in-law Thothmes, to his own

son, into late Mexican history. Kai Khusrau also left the throne
of Iran to Lohorasp, a stranger.-^ That Mezahab had other children than Matred is asserted in
the Sanscrit tradition, which is the best illustration of the Kenite
record of the slaughter of Tahath's sons, of the story of the Seven against Thebes, and of the destruction of Electryon's sons by the Taphians, as well as of Aneurin's first battle of Cattraeth, and the disaster of the Persian Gudarz. " Hear, O king, how the renowned Vitahavya, the royal rishi, attained the condition of Brahmanhood venerated by mankind, and so difficult to be acquired. It happened that Divodasa king of Kasi, was attacked by the sons of Vitahavya, and all his family slain by them in battle. The afflicted monarch thereupon resorted to the sage Bharadvaja, who performed for him a sacrifice in consequence of which a son named Pratardana was born to him. Pratardana becoming an accomplished warrior, was sent by his father to take vengeance on the Vitahavyas. They rained upon him showers of arrows and other missiles as clouds pour down upon the Himalaya ; but he destroyed them all and they lay with their bodies besmeared with blood like kinsuka trees cut down." '^* The poet then goes on to tell that when Pratardana wished Bhrigu the sage to surrender Vitahavya, who had lied to him for refuge, he received for answer, " There is no Kshattriya here ; all these are Brahmans." Thus Vitahavya became a Brahman, and Gritsamada was his son and from him came the Srinjayas. But the son of Divodasa was King Mitrayu, a Brahman rishi. ly other stories the avenger of the slaughtered and exterminator of the Kshattriyas is Parasara, son of Saktri, and Parasu Rama, son of Jamadagni. The latter is Beriah as the descendant on his father's side of Yama and Agni, or Achumai and Akan, and as the first Rameses. The name Mitrayu given to the son of Divodasa, a name which denotes the same person as Pratardana, Parasara, and Parasu Rama, is important, for, besides connnecting Matred with this hero, it identifies him with the Persian Mithras. Unhappily the Zend Avesta, which celebrates Mithra, is one of the most obscure of ancient books. In the Mihr Yasht of the

Khordali Avesta we read : " Praise to Mithra who possesses M^de pastures, who has a thousand ears, ten thousand eyes, the Yazata with named name and Eama-kastra. Ahura Mazda spake to the holy Zarathrusta : When I created Mithra who possesses \vide
pastures, holy, I created him as worthy of honour, as praiseworthy as I myself, Ahura Mazda." -^ The religion of Zoroaster was introduced into Persia in the reign of Gushtasp, according
to the historians, and the Zend Avesta bears all the marks of a manufactured creed intended to unite the rival Horite and Hittite peoples. Most of the Hittites were sun worshippers and many of them are such to-day. While this sun worship was retained in the new creed it was associated with that of fire, in other words, of the ancestral Horite Akan who is Agni and Ignis. The chief god Ahura Mazda, who was the first Ameshaspenta, may be fairly identified with the legendary Lohurasp, father of Gushtasp, and who resigned the crown in his favour. He is thus a second Kai Khusrau, a Har em hebi oi- golden Horus, a Mezahab and a fire deity Montezuma. Mithra, proceeding from him through his daughter Ahura, is the son of Matred, namely, Beriah. Spenta Mainyu, connnected with Spenta Armaiti, denotes Esfendiar, falsely called the son of Gushtasp, being the Egyptian Simentu and Kenite Shimon, son of Hadar and Mehe
tabel, W'hom Spenta Armaiti represents, for she is another daughter of Ahura Mazda. Another great Ameshaspenta is Vohumano or Behmen, and he is the historical Bahmen son of Esfendiar ; in the Kenite genealogy, Ammon son of Shimon. Hadar again is Drvaspa in the Khordah Avesta, Darab, absurdly made the son of Bahmen instead of his grandfather, in Mirkhond's
history, and the original of the Persian Darius. His war is obscurely mentioned in the following prayer : " Grant me O good
most profitable Drvaspa this favour that I may smite the murdering Turanian Frangra.syana behind the sea Chaechasta, the deep abounding in waters, I, the son of the daughter of Syavarshana, the man slain by violence, and of Aghrae-ratha the descendant of Nam." The murdering Frangra-syana is possibly Baalhanan, the chief enemy of Hadar. The nmch disguised Tahath of the Zend Avesta and of Persian tradition is Yistaspa

and Gushtasp, for the final asp and aspa is an euphonic suffix. Another character who has an important place in the Persian scriptures is Yima, the historical Jemschid, the Egyptian Khem and Kenite Achumai. Thus the Zoroastrian system was one that mediated between two peoples and their religions, flattering both
by recognizing the divinity, not simply of ancestors, but also of the living princely representatives of each. Mithras, whom many writers have compared with the Greek Perseus, is recog
nized as the mediator. He is depicted in the act of killing the bull Aboudad, just as the Thothmes and Rameses are set forth as trampling upon the snake Apophis. Aboudad the sacred bull is the Egyptian Apis, the worship of which was abolished by Jabez,
but reinstituted by his successor. The destruction of these symbols of the mighty Pharaoh denoted indeed hatred of him and of his holy ci'eed, but it also had a good side, for it symbolized the supersedence of the prevailing idolatry in the form of image and animal worship by the cult of fire as the emblem of supreme
divinity. We are now in a position to understand the historical connec
tion of the short Kenite account of the slaughter of the sons of Tahath. According to that account it happened before the birth of Beriah, so that if the Sanscrit stories which make him the avenger of his slain brethren be true, the expedition of the Epigoni must have been more than ten years after the first assault on Thebes. Also as Hadar of Edom married a daughter of Matred and sister of Beriah, he was no doubt the contemporaiy of that monarch, and his father or grandfather Saul of Rehoboth
is more likely to have been, as Osortasen III., the ally of Tahath 's sons. Jabez was dead, and Mezahab, his great-grandson, followed him on the throne of Thebes as Amenemes IV. But the new king had been brought up an idolater, and, to conciliate the
native Egyptians, added to his golden name that of the ancestral god Horus, calling himself Hormanub. This concession did not satisfy the ancient line represented by Tahath, nor the mixed Horite and Kenezzite royal family, of which Leophrah was the head, being the son of Meonothai, whose mother Hathath had been married by Mesha, the grandfather of Mezahab. Still another opponent was Saul, who, having secured the empire of



THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 353
Gebalene, and reconquered from the Pharaohs the whole of Arabia Petraea, wished to add to his dominions the throne of Abydos, on which his ancestor Hadad was first seated. On the tablet of Karnak, Laobra appears, as the contemporary of Osortasen III. These three kings, Tahath of Nubia, Leophrah of Syene, and Saul of Abydos, resolved to take Thebes from the heir of Jabez. Tahath sent his son Zabad and his three grandsons Shuthelah, Ezer, and Elead, to the war, but did not 20 himself, although the Greek traditions make him as Tydeus, one of
the seven. These traditions do not mention Ezer and Elead, but represent Zabad by Capaneus, the father of Sthenelus. Yet Sthenelus was not one of the Greek seven, unless Eteoclus be his disguise and that of Shuthelach. Leophrah or Ophrah appears in the Greek story as Amphiaraus, a descendant of Melampus ; for Aljiezer, the grandfather of Ophrah, was of the family of Rapha. In the Greek, Welsh, and confused Persian accounts, Hadar is m.ade the leader of the expedition as Adrastus, Eidiol, and Gudarz, and the Greek story sets forth Amphiaraus as the killer of Talaus, the father of Adrastus, in a former feud. Yet his father Saul cannot have conquered Lower Egypt until after
the death of Jabez, and that he did conquer it is certain, for his sepulchral pyramid was built at Dashur near Memphis. He is. at the same time the Egyptian Sesotris ; as Osortasen III. an. object of worship to Thothmes III. and IV. ; and the Saulaces of Pliny who is reported to have overcome Sesostris. The exigencies of chronology seem to make it imperative to disregard the general voice of tradition and to substitute Saul for his son Hadar in the first history of the Theban war. A passage in Pausanius favours this substitution. He says that Hippocoon, by whom Jabez seems to be designated, and his sons, having leagued themselves with the faction of Icarius, the Ekronites of ,
Philistia, so called from their ancestor Eker, became greatly more powerful than Tyndareus, and compelled him to take refuge with Aphareus in Messenia ; and that he had children in Thai
amis, a town of Messenia ; and that he was restored to his kingdom by Hercules.'-'' This statement confirms the monumental illustration of the contemporaneousness of Osortasen III. and

Laobra, for as Ophrah he is Aphareus, whose kingdom of Messenia was named after his father Megonothai, and included Talmis above Syene, the Thalamis of Pausanias. The vanity of the Spartan genealogists led them to derive Eker the son of Ram and grandson of Jerachmeel, Jabez the Great, and Saul the Hadadezrite, from one father (Ebalus, whose name has historical connection only with the first of them. Eker, the eponym of Ekron in Philistia, is famous in ancient history. He was a Japhetic hero, the son of Ram, from whom the names of Rome and Brahma came.'-'' As Geker, for the
initial letter is ayin, he is the Greek Cecrops and the oriental Susravas and Sugriva. The only geographical term that connects in Palestine with the names Eker or Gekerand Ekron or Gekron is the Maaleh Akrabbim, or hill of the scorpions, at the foot of the Dead Sea.-^ Gekrab is the same word as the Greek skorpios and Latin scorpio, and the formidable scorpion men depicted by the ancient Chaldeans were the descendants of Eker, who called
themselves Gekrabbi.-'-* But the commoner name of this people was Ekronites, although Homer calls them the barbarous-voiced Carians.^*' Their connection with the family of Jabez appears in the adoption by them of his mother Zobebah as tutelary goddess of Ekron under the name Baal-Zebub, which is no doubt a semitized version of her designation.^^ Bryant has shown that Baal-Zebub was a feminine divinity and the same as Achor of Gyrene.^'- Eker was apparently a dweller in Egypt, for Manetho
places him, as Necherophes, at the head of his third, 1)ut first Memphite, dynasty. He is thus the Uchoreus of Diodorus, for to him that author attributes the building of Memphis. ^'^ Herodotus makes Psammetichus the first Pharaoh to employ Carian mercenaries, and speaks of the fear with which their brazen
armour inspired the Egyptians.^* It is said that a quarter in

Memphis was assigned to them called Caro Memphis. But the Carians or Ekronites, also called Buzites, from Buz, a descendant of Eker, were Egyptian mercenaries from the beginning of the reign of Jahdai.^° Whether he led them out of Gerar into Egypt, or found them in that country, they were his allies, and the strength of the Theban kingdom. They are the white men in armour with whom Montezuma promised to return and restore the glories of the Aztec empire, so that when the Spaniards appeared on the Mexican coast the natives deemed them to be the retinue of their ancient divine king. Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite of the kindred of Ram, and the friend of Job, was one of these Carians, and Bargylia in Caria bore his
father's name.^^ In the time of Jabez this Elihu must have lived, for he shared his faith, being a devout centurion and one that feared God. Unhappily the Kenite genealogy of the Buzites does not contain his name, so that he must have been the son of a younger son. The mailed champions who were in front of the enemy's host in the Gododin were these Japhetic warriors. And they were the faction of Icarius that made Hippocoon stronger than Tyndareus. As they had served Jabez, so they were the protectors of his descendant Mezahab. When the seven came against Thebes, it was these men of Gath born in the land
of Egypt, Philistines, Carians, Greeks, who met the armies of the three kings. Zabad son of Tahath and his three sons were brave warriors, but the descendants of the men of Gerar whom Phichol had trained to arms and made the tirst standing army in the
world's history, were more than a match for them and their host. The four Thothmetic princes fell, and the father of Zabad was a childless man. Thus he was Divodasa bereft of his children by
the Srinjayas, called sons of Vitahavya, but really the Sharonites descended from Eker. And in the Taphian story, his father Elgadah or Electryon stands for him, a man equally made desolate by the descendants of Taphius. It is a coincidence that one of these descendants is Chersidamas, and that Gritsamada is the son of Vitahavya, and that the Hercules of Strasburg was Krutsanara, which means a valiant man. In the engagement,

Caphtorim and Philistim were victorious over those who came to take away their cattle. But the word miknehem does not simply mean cattle ; it means possessions, wealth, territory, just
as the Basque ahere, animal, becomes aberatz, rich, riches, and the Latin j^ecits gives pecunia. For the three kings came to
Thehes to deprive the line of Jahez of that city, their last possession, and drive the Ammono Hittite stock out of the land of Egypt. Although Mezahab was victorious over his three rivals -by the
help of his Philistine warriors, he was unable to regain the empire of Jabez. Saul as Osortasen III. held all Lower Egypt, with the exception of the Xoite kingdom in the Delta, in which the descendants of Anub still leigned, and from Abydos and Tentyris in the south he menaced the Jahdaites of Coptos and Thebes. The aged Tahath in Nubia, grieving over his slain, yet jealous of Saul's power, made peace with Mezahab, and received in marriage his daughter Matred, who became the mother of his son Beriah and of a daughter Mehetabel. Saul died, according to Greek tradition, by the hand of Amphiaraus or Ophrah, and his empire fell to pieces. His son Hadar was compelled to flee from Abydos, perhaps for a time to Xois, where his brother-in-law Michael
reio-ned, but afterwards, emerging from ob.scurity, he began the
victorious career that has already been illustrated. The period
between the death of Jabez and the acce.-ssion of Beriah was one of anarchy. Mezahab bound himself to leave the crown of Thebes to his daughter's son, but his own .son, Gritsamada, Chersidamas or Crechtasena,son of Megavahana, whose name does not appear on
the Kenite lists, refused to ratify the bargain when Mezahab died or went into exile, so that the struggle between the races began
afresh. In the former contest, Laobra son of Meonothai of the
Kenezzite or Sekenen family, was an ally of Tahath. As his father was the first Amenhotep or Menephtah, he must have been
the second of that name. It is not clear what his personal
relation to the Jabezite and Tahathite lines was, but it is known that he claimed a quasi descent from the former by the marriage of Mesha to his widowed grandmother Hathath, and that his c-randsoD Zoheth was afterwards united to a daughter of Beriah named Sherah. Th#name of Laobra or Leophrah is famous in Irish story as Labradh Loingseach. His Kenezzite descent is



THE HITTITES IX EGYPT. 357
given in Ugaine More, the name of his great-grandfather, but his ofrandfather Laoohaire Lorck is hard tu account for, although the true father Meonothai is restored in Maion, which is said to have been Labradh's original name. His reputed father Oilioll Aine may be a corruption of Othniel, the son of Kenaz and father of Hathath. Cobhthach Caolmbreag assassinated his own brother Laoghaire and his brother's son Oilioll. The child Maion he compelled to eat part of the hearts of his father and grandfather and to swallow a living mouse, by which he thought to destroy him. The boy, through these barbarities, lost the use of speech, whereupon the tyrant dismissed him,
deeming him harmless. He was carried to Fearmorck in Mun.ster, where King Scoriat entertained him. Afterwards he passed into Fi-aiice or Armenia, and took service under the king, so distinguishing himself that the world rang with his praise. Moriat, the beautiful daughter of Scoriat of Munster, sent the harper Craftine to him with rich gifts, and this action awoke in Maion or Labradh the desire to reconquer his grandfather's kingdom. Arming his Gaulish or Armenian soldiers with broad green battle axes, he took shipping and landed at Wexford, whence he advanced to meet the enemy of his line. He came upon Cobhthach unprepared, defeated, and put him to death. Then he married Moriat and had a prosperous reign of eighteen years. However, it is told that he had enormous ears like those of a horse, to conceal which he allowed his hair to grow long, and on account of vrhich he put to death every barber who polled him. At length a young man who performed this office, being spared on account of his mother's entreaties and on condition that he would never divulge the secret, whispered it into a hollow tree. Of this tree Craftine innocently made a new harp, which, when played before the king, incessantly repeated these words,
" Labradh has horse's ears." The king, i-ecognizing the voice of heaven in the harp's tones, repented and uncovered his long ears."" The same story is told of Midas of Phrygia, but the Irish one is certainly not borrowed from the Phrygian. After reigning
eighteen years, Labradh was slain by Meilge the son of Cobh
thach, whom he had put to death.

3o8 THE HITTITES.
The name Laobra or Leophrah is a compound of Ophrah and al, powerful, similar in structure to Laomer or the might}- Omer. As a local name it occurs in Palestine as Ophrah and Beth Leophrah, being counted to the Abiezrites through the union of Hathath, Ophrah's grandmother, with Abiezer the Rapha.^^ ' As the initial letter of Ophrah is ayin the name may be read Ophrah !ind Gophrah, Leophrah and Legophrah. Thus it is the same word as Lakabri in an inscription of Sennacherib, and as Leucophrys,
the name of a place in the island of Tenedos.^^ Conon tells the story of the hatchet of Tennes, which, like the statues of Jupiter Labradeus or Labrandeus carrying a double-headed battle axe, recalls the green partisans with which Labradh armed his followers. The second wife of Cycnus king of the Troad complained to that monarch of the conduct of her step-children Tennes and Hemithea, and Cycnus, to please his wife, shut them
up in the traditional coffer and set them adrift upon the sea. The ark was carried to an island bearing the name of Leucophrys,
but as the people received the prince and princess as their sovereigns, it was renamed Tenedos in honor of Tennes. Cycnus repented his treatment of his children and came in a ship to Tenedos to recall them. The vessel arrived in port and was made fast to the pier, but before his father could disembark, Tennes
severed the cable with his axe. Hence, he who breaks ofi" an affair abruptly is said to use the hatchet of Tennes."*^ Whatever historical truth there may be here of a quarrel between Kenaz and his son Othniel, these are the names that Cycnus and Tennes stand for, and Leucophrys is Leophrah, the man with the axe. The Lombards were Germanized Leophraites whose own tradition connects their name with the word halhert and not with Longobardi or long beards. Pope Stephen knew their name, and in an epistle to Pepin blamed him for having anything to do with a race from wiiom the lepers originated."*^ Leophrah as Labaris was, according to Manetho, the author of the Labyrinth, which can hardly be the structure on Lake Moeris identified with it by Lepsius, as it bears the name of Amenemes IIL or Jabez.

Cretan labyrinth is said to have been at Cnossus or Gnossus, which Ulysses in the Odyssey describes as the vast city where Minos reigned.*^ This is Konosso or Kenez in Upper Egypt, where the Kenezzite Pharaohs reigned, of whom Leophrah was one, and where there are extensive remains.'*^ In British story the ally
of Eidiol or Hadar is Aurelius Ambrosias, just as Amphiaraus and Adrastus, and Aphareus and Tyndareus, are allied in Greek story, and as we know from the monuments, that Saul or Osortasen III. and Laobra dwelt too^ether.** The great work of Ambrosius, accomplished by the supernatural aid of Merlin, was the brinpinof of the Giant's Dance from Mount Killaraus in Ireland to Mount Ambrius in Britain. Stonehenge is popularly connected with this ancient story from the banks of the Nile. The fate of Ophrah is doubtful. As Labradh he was assassinated by his successor. As Ambrosius the same fate befell him at the hands of the Saxon Eopa ; and as Amphiaraus, the ground opened beneath him when warring against Thebes and he was engulfed. The names Eopa and Cobhthach, and the relationship of the latter to Labradh, seem to indicate that his enemies were the Charashim, sons of Joab, whose father Seraiah was the brother of Leophrah's great-grandfather Othniel, and whose centre was Korusko south of Konosso. The explanation of the fable of the horse's or ass's ears is to be found in Egypt. It will be remembered that the cognizance of the Hittites was the hare, the long-eared animal. Kenrick refers to a deity that seems to have symbolized the race, saying :
" The divinity represented, a sitting figure with long ears and a head similar to that of a tapir, often occurs on monuments, especially in Nubia. The phonetic name was discovered to be Set or Seth. It was observed that the character had been
chiselled out whenever it occurred in the name of a king. This
appearance of hostility, which Champollian first remarked in the Museum at Turin, and found universal in Egypt, led him to conclude that it could be no other than Typhon, the principle of Evil, one of whose Egyptian names was Seth, and thus the name
*'- Odyssey, xix. 178. *3 Laobra is on the Tablet of Karnak, Sharjje's History of Egypt, i. 12. ** Geoffrey's British History.



'360 THE HITTITES.
of the king was read Sethei, and the effaced figure was supposed to be an ass, which was an emblem of Typhon." ^-^ The king into whose name this long-eared element entered is Seti Menephthah, and the first of that name was the grandson of Leophrah. It would appear that the kings of Elephantine, on account of some alliance wnth the Horite family at Syene, had striven to suppress the knowledge of their Hittite descent from Ethnan and Bela, and to have themselves recognized as descendants of the
most ancient line of kings, but in spite of their efforts the murder would out, and the long ears of Seth declared their parentage.
At the death of Leophrah his family fell into obscurity, his son Ishi or Ishgi being merely known as a stranger king whose tomb at Thebes is in a valley apart from the other Pharaohs. His name has been read Skliai, Eesa, Oaiee and Ai. This Ishi had two sons, Zoheth and Benzoheth, and Zoheth is the name wliich the Egyptians represented by Seti, just as they repre
sented Tahatii by Thoth. A truer form would be Saite or Sahid. In Greek story Zocheth is Dictys, and Benzocheth, Polydectes, whose descent is summarily given, for they are called the sons of
Magnes, the son of Pierius. Thus their father and gran;lfather
are omitted, and they are referred to Megonothai, the fiist Anienhotep or Menephthah, and from him to Beor, who, as Busiris, was among the earliest Egyptian monarchs. In Persian
story Zocheth is altogether out of place as Zohak, the slayer of Djemschid, who, along with Afrasiab, divided the hate of the
historians of Iran. As Afrasiab is called the son of Pecheng, he
no doubt represents Ophrah of the Kenezzites, Sekenens, or Apachnids, among whose descendants Bechen Aten or Atin re Bakhan appears. The Chaldean legend of Izdubar, who is accompanied by Zaidu, his son, sets forth 0])hrah and Zoh(;th.''''
Chronologically they are altogether out of place, as is the pres
ence of the Greek Zethus in the companion tradition to that of Izdubar, but as the Chaldean heroes are represented as killing Hubaba or Jobab, who dispossessed the Ethnanite Dinhaba, son of Bela of Beor, the vengeance of the Ethnanitcs was placed by the romancer in the hands of the most illustrious persons of that

tribe, in spite of the fact that they Uved many generations later. In Italy Izdubar, as god of pestilence, was Februus, who was connected with or the same being as Lupercus, being associated with Pan, as Izdubar in the Chaldean legend is with Heabani. But he was also Liparus, called the son of Auson, instead of his father. This Auson was the eponym of the Ausones or Osci, also called Aurunci, but Liparus is said to have died at Surrentum in Campania.

APPENDIX I.
The Ancient Hittite Language.
This language is now known, and known only from the inscriptions transliterated and translated in this work. But the
history of the Hittite people has shown that the XJgric or Finnic
family of languages constitutes one branch of its descendantsAnother branch is the Basque or Baskic, embracing, besides the
language of the Pyrenees so-called, th;. Pictish, Celt-Iberian. Etruscan, Phrygian, and Lycian, all dead tongues at this day. A third class is that of the languages of the Caucasus, some of which
present the peculiar pronominal characteristics of the Basque.
Leaving out of sight the little studied non-Aryan languages of India and the Parthian, only known through inscriptions on coins,
the unclassified languages of northern Asia constitute the next group of descendants in which the Japanese alone is classical.
The last and by far the largest division of the Khitan languages is the American, including almost, if not all, the postponing forms
of speech on the continent. Some of these, and notably the
Iroquois, present the so-called polysynthesis which is found in the Basque and in some of the dialects of the Caucasus and of Siberia. In the ancient Hittite inscriptions from Hamath, Carchemish, Marasia and Cappadocia, there is no polysynthesis, no amalgamation of the verb substantive with subjective and objective pro
nouns, direct and indirect, such as appears in Basque, Caucasian,
and Iroquois. The language they set forth is as simple in point
of structure as is the Japanese. The inference is that polysynthesis is no radical quality of language, no characteristic demanding
classification, but an accident of a peculiar nature to account for
if one can. Language is the expression of thought as well as a help to thought. Grammar is logic in expression, and diversities in
grammar indicate diversity of logical process. A sharply defined line cannot be drawn between languages in this connection, but



366 THE HITTITES.
the}' can nevertheless be thoroughly classified. The radical diversity is one of thought. Ideas are concrete or abstract, and
while the concrete idea is the picture in the mind of an object or
an action, the abstract is that of a relation. The Semitic and Sub-Semitic, the Celtic, and generally speaking, the Indo-European mind, was analytical, and placed the abstract idea before the concrete. Thus the Englishman says : " I will give it to him." In
this sentence personality is abstract, so is futurity with volition, and of the same nature is the dative to. Taking the preposition as the type of this form of thought,it may be said that English is
a prepositional language. So are the Semitic and Celtic languages. Sanscrit has many postpositions and postpositional forms arising out of the lengthened contact of the Brahman with the Kshattriya> but it has also many prepositional forms, and the sister tongues of Asia and Europe are prepositional. But the Khitan languages in general terms may be said never to make use of prepositions or prepositional forms. The concrete was the first idea to strike the intelligence of the Hittites, and they postponed the relative term. To call the Malay-Polynesians by the name Turanian, to class the American Mayas and Quiches with the Aztecs.and the Algonquins with the Iroquois, is an ofience against logic, an evidence of blindness to the commonest principles of language on the part of the
perpetrators. The Hittite language claims kindred with the Akkadian or old Turanian speech of Chaldea and Babylonia in grannnatical forms and in vocabulary, but the two do not coincide. The Akkadian has been ranked in the Ugric or Finnic family, while the Hittite of Hamath and Carchemish pertains to the unclassified group of languages which the author has called the Khitan. In point of vocabulary the Akkadian is full of roots common to it and the Celtic, resulting from the union of Sumer and Akkad. These
roots rarely appear in the Hittite and its direct descendants, but in the Toltec dialects of Peru they are found. Now, the Zerethites were the intimate allies of the Sumerians in Babylonia and southern Palestine. The Sumerian or Celtic infiuence was nowhere sufficiently strong to change the radical current of Turanian thought, but Semitic influence in Assyria and elsewhere completely metamorphosed the speech of some Hittite tribes, making



THE ANCIENT HITTITE LANGUAGE. 367
it akin to that of the Malay-Polynesians, and in point of structure totally un-Turanian. Some Semitic words appear in the Hittite of the monuments, but there is no trace of this Seraitizing of
Hittite thought. Little can be said at this stage of Hittite phonetics. The
language was expressed by syllables, not by letters, and these syllables seem to have been open, consisting either of a long vowel or of a vowel preceded by a consonant. The aspirate h and semi
vowel y are indistinguishable. The liquids^, m,7i, rare all present, although in many descendants of the Hittite some of them are wanting, for Japanese has no I, Iroquois no m, Aztec no i: The
labials h and p have no separate signs, and the sounds of /, v and vj, which appear in the Lat-Indian syllabary, have no place in
Hittite phonetics. The dentals d and t are not clearly differentiated, although new texts may enable us to assign d values to certain dental symbols, for in Asia Minor and in Etruria a distinction is drawn between the two sounds. The sibilants seem to have been similar to those of the Japanese, including the Italian
ci, which in transliterated Japanese is represented by ^hi, chi,ji. The last letter of the English alphabet was a compound one in Hittite as in Japanese, being the equivalent of the Japanese ds, ts: it is represented by t and s forms in combination. The phonetic
values of the many hieroglyphics representing guttural syllables
appear to be reducible to three, ke or ki, ka,, and ko or ku. Even to a greater extent than in Basque and Japanese, k and g were interchangeable sounds in Hittite. Looking at the Hittite noun, anyone who has been accustomed to declension would naturally call it declinable. In origin there
is probably no difference between the oblique forms of the Hittite nouns and those in Sanscrit, Greek, and Latin ; but in the case of the latter there has been such syncope as renders it a difficult task
to restore the original suffixes by which the root was modified. In
Hittite proper, and in its descendants, there is no such difficulty; the particles remain intact, and the word can be decomposed into its elements of root, number and relation. The mark of plurality is ne, which has been read ni in the Cappadocian cuneiform tablets, and which in Aztec has become in. Thus the Aztec Cit,
Citli, a hare, becomes in the plural Citin, answering to the form



368 THE HITTITES.
Khitan of the Chinese historians and to the Ketane of the Hittite inscriptions. In Hittite as in Japanese, and in such dead Khitan languages as the Etruscan, the sign of plurality is often omitted.
All other inflections of the noun are produced by suffixing separable postpositions. Such an one is sa, the genitive suffix answering to the old Japanese tsu, now entirely superseded by no and f/a, which are the prevailing forms in all the Khitan languages. The Japanese tsu appears in the inscription on the stone bowl, replacing the commoner sa. The common dative postposition which also forms the infinitive of verbs is ne. With dative and locative powers it is found in all the Khitan languages. In the Hamath
Votive Inscriptions its place is taken by ke, which should perhaps have the meaning for. But elsewhere ka has the meaning of the Basque ka and Japanese ka-ra, by, from. In one inscription ta
appears as a postposition, being the Basque di, dik, from, out of.
In most cases the genitive particle is dispensed with in Hittite,
the postposition of the governing word to its regimen sufficiently
indicating their relation. Thus Keta mata is sufficient to denote
" the king of the Hittites." But if for politeness' sake the mata
is prefixed, the particles must follow the regimen to denote its
o'overnment. as in Mata Ketanesa. The only pronouns yet found in Hittite are the first personal
ne, I, and the third sOj, he, and the relative, which may be read nene. The Cappadocian tablet form is anna, the Etruscan none, and the Basque non, now meaning ivhere, seams to have been originally
this relative.
Hittite adjectives have no special quality. Some are formed
from nouns by the suffix ka, as alka, the powerful, literally " of
power "; but others are discordant, like oneniesa, efieminate, zuzena^ equitable, lawful. They generally precede the noun they qualify, so that .some of them are really substantives governed in the
genitive of position ])y the word that follows. Thus ziizena saki may be read " a prince of rightfulness" as well as "a rightful
prince." Otherwis(i Hittite adjectives are not declined. The Hittite vei'V) is simple in the extreme. It seems to have
been originally a verb substantive, expressed by the single particle ke or ka. This was used alone as ka, is, or it is, or with a personal
pronoun subjoined, as ka-ne, I a,m, ka-sa, he is. But the pronoun



THE ANCIENT HITTITE LANGUAGE. 369
could be separated from the verb and made to precede it, as in ne ri-atohago ka, I am the door-bar of authority. This primitive verb had the power of converting any part of speech into a verb.
Thus ha means a place ; but ha-ke is a verb, places, or is placing. The Japanese has a large number of verbs similarly formed, with the auxiliary shi, suru. The cumbrous conjugations of the Basque which are found in Etruscan, Celt Iberian, and Phrygian, have grown out of this simple Hittite beginning. Similar complicated forms are found in some of the Khitan lanofuagfes of Asia and America, but the Aztec-Sonora family maintains the simple Hittite verb substantive ka in its primitive integrity, Yet as early as the time of Kapini of Ras, other elements were made use of in the formation of verbs, elements that are found in Basque and Japanese. One of these, ne, seems to have been originally a
mark of the infinitive, but in kane-ne, he is agreeing, el-ne, he
comes, ba-ne, he places, this final ne plays the part of ka. Another
is tsu, as in ka-tsu, he conquers, or is above, and Tna-tsu, he gives,
which also arrogates to itself the quality of the verb substantive with a participle. In appearance these verb-formers are simply postpositions, but it is premature, while Hittite texts are so few
and brief, to attempt to decide their origin. The only sign of past
time in the inscriptions is a final ta in Hamath ii., and in the
Merash Lion Inscription ; such an indication of the past tense is found in Japanese, but not in Basque, hence its identification is doubtful.
Hittite syntax is purely Turanian, its characteristic being that the governing word follows its regimen. To this, as has been
shown, the preceding adjective is no exception, since it may be
regarded as a noun in the genitive to the following substantive.
Sanscrit suffered largely from Hittite influences in point of syntax, and so to a much lesser extent did Latin. The marvel is that Greek, which grew up among Hittite and Semitic dialects,
waa so little afiected by the former.

APPENDIX III.
Grammatical Analysis of Hittite Texts.
Stone Bowl Inscription : Asher, in Hittite generally called Sagane, denotes Assyria.
tsu, a late genitive replacing an original sa ; is an old
Japanese genitive. alka, an adjective formed from al, power, by ka, probably
a genitive particle. niata, the equivalent of the Japanese mi-kado, the honour
able door. Sennakseriba, the Assyrian Sennacherib. sankatzu, succeeding, is probably formed of an old verb, to come, represented by the Basque jin, and atze, behind, after.
ka, in Japanese ko, a son. Assaragotane, the Assyrian Esarhaddon. ne, the postposition to, governing Assaragotane.
Seninakseriha, a variant of Sennakseriba, both being perhaps intended to represent Sennaxerib.
arte, the Basque verb artii, artzen, to hold, is here infinite without sign. kaku or gagu, the B. gogo, mind, memory.
kara, the B. ekarri, to bring, carry, is here in the 3rd sing.,
pres. ind., agreeing with Tarako, its subject. mo'pi, Etruscan word for two.
hebane, a loan word from the Semitic, used as an adjective,
stone.
sara, a bowl, B. save, Jap. zaru, a basket : in plural with
out sign.
sesena, B. zuzen, right, equitable, standard : adj. qualifying maneh. mane, a Semitic measure : is plural without sign.
tsuka, same as B. itcheki, holding : verb in participial use.
(25)



386 THE HITTITES.
Stone Bowl Inscription—(Continued): hashane, B. uts, pure, hena, true : adj. qualifying salara
or silara. salara, B. zillar, silver : the two woi'ds hashane salara are not in grammatical connection, but are used ellip
tically as in the language of trade. mata : its use before Maishga is ungrammatieal but grammar yields to etiquette, which requires the mention of royalty before that of the people. Maishga, the Moschi, in the plural without sign.
Tarako, the Moschian king, subject of the sentence.
Sarara, his city, in apposition to kula.
hula, a city, see Inscriptions, ch. v. : in the ace. to takekala,
takekala is probably the B. tohi-zale, inclined to the place,
inhabiting.
Hamath I
:
basanesa, imperfect, should be nahasanesa, genitive plural of the B. nahusi, dominus. sari, B. sari, governs the preceding in the gen. ke, simplest form of the substantive verb : is placed in 1st
sing. pres. ind. by
me, personal pronoun, I,
ri, Jap., authority : see Inscrip. ch. vi.
to-hago, door-bar, see ch. vi. : governs ri in gen. by position.
itsuka, Jap., tsugo, all: adj. qualifying Kera.
Kera, Syria, noun in the genitive to the following.
saki, Jap. saki, B. zagi, princeps. tenia, Jap. tama, gift, governed by the following
kara, B. ekarri. ,mata niatanesa, king of kings : the inflection is necessary on account of the preposition of mata, the governing word. sata kara, zait ekarri, B. to bring a guard : is in infinitive to tema kara and governs mata.
sutoha, an altar, see ch. vi. : in apposition to tema.
niatsiihil, to sacrifice, literally, to give death, see ch. vi. Katanesa, of the Hittites, governed by preceding mata. Pisa, the Assyrian Pisiris, in apposition to mata.



GRAMMATICAL -ANALYSIS OF HITTITE TEXTS. 387
Hamath I

(Continued)
:
II Maka, epithet of Baal, governed by
ne, the postposition, to, in.
non, Etruscan relative, who, which : Pisa is the antecedent.
hake, composed of ba, J place, and ke the verb-substantive,
, is placing : the immediate subject is the relative non, the regimen direct is gagu, the mind, heart, and the indirect, II Maka. Hamath II, line 2 :
tenia kata : Jap. has a verb taniukeru, past taniuketa : this looks like a past tense of an old verb ka.ra, but
the texts are too few to decide that it is such.
tala sain . sain is the B. zain, guard, protection, answer
ing to the sata or zaitu, to protect, of H. i. The verb
tata is the B. bidali, to seek, find, obtain, and the Jap.
atari, to obtain. Compare the B. estali, to cover,
protect. This clause is in the inf. to temakata.
Baal ke ; here ke must be the B. ka, by, J. kara, by, from. It is doubtful whether the meaning is " to obtain protec
tion from Baal " or " an altar to sacrifice for Baal."
Hamath IV
:
temata seems to be a shorter verb of giving in the past
tense, answering to the Jap. tamai, taniota, now only
used to denote gifts to inferiors.
Hamath III -.
Kaleba, Caleb, king of Chalcis, governed by makaka.
makaka, kills, see ch. vii. At first sight the final ka might
be taken for the auxiliary, and it may be such, but in line 2 the noun is of the same form.
keha, the chief, qualifying Kaba. Kaha, a Hittite murderer of Caleb, the subject of makaka. Hamata, Hamath, the Japanese Yamato, governed by
ka, the postposition, here used locatively, in. Kenetnla, Khintiel, king of Hamath, called Eniel by the
Assyrians : the object of atsuta. Kapesaka, Khupuscia or Thapsacus : mata united with Antsu should follow, governing Kapesaka in the gen.,
but by courtesy it precedes.



388 THE HITTITES.
Hamath III—(Continued)
:
Antsu, Yanzu, king of Khupuscia, in apposition to mata.
atsiUa, verb, to inform, in 3rd sing. pres. ind., governing
Kenetala : see. ch. vii. raakaka sa, of the murder, makaka being a noun in the
genitive to the particle sa, the indirect regime of
atsuta. haka, B. hango, hago, Jap. ika, iko, from that, thereafter. Kalaka ne, to Chalcis: instead of saying that he gives Chalcis to Assyria, he says that he gives the Assyrian
to Chalcis.
ha, used as a verb. 3rd sing. pres. ind., literally, he places : in
Etruscan the verb imi, imini, to place, is often used as here in the sense of intending, designing.
Sagane, the common Hittite name of Assyria : see eh. vii.
matsiine, the B. eman, ematen, anciently ematzen, to give ; governing Sagane directly, and indirectly Kalaka.
aginha, an army : see cli. vii. ne, the postposition, to. altoka, reinforcement, literally, extension of power, from al, B. power and B. edegin, Jap. todoku, to extend.
katsu, Jap. conquer, see ch. vii : 3rd sing. pres. ind... with
subject saki, etc., and regimen Kaba. Daviasakasanesa, some of the characters are doubtful, and in Hamath v. the reading is Damasakanesa, which is preferable : it means, of the Damascenes, and is governed in the genitive by saki.
Hamath V
:
sa, third personal pronoun in apposition to Kenetala,
governed by ka, the locative postposition. Retesine, the Rezin of the Bible and the Assyrian inscrip
tions, the subject of
tanefxi, places trust : .see ch. viii., 3rd sing. pres. ind.
nagoha, places together, adds to ; see ch. viii., 3rd sing.,
pres. ind.
kanene, agrees, is in accord, see ch. viii., 3rd sing., pres. ind.
Feka, the Pekah of the Bible and Pakaha of the Assyrians, the subject of ka7iene.



GRAMMATICAL ANALYSIS OF HITTITE TEXTS. 389
Hamath N—(Continued)
:
Memalika ko, Remaliah's son : ko governs Remalika in gen.
of position.
Batuel, Bethel : this is not Hittite order ; a postposition must be understood after Bethel. mata Pitane Dahaka: mata is supposed to be with Dahaka, the name of the Patinian king, governing Pitane in the
gen. of position.
haka, late, defunct, qualifying Kalaba : see ch. viii.
babe, the B. and Etruscan pabetiv, to help, in the inf. to kanene. Kapesa ne, in Khupuscia, should be Kapesaka ne.
elne, to come, in inf. to neqai : see ch. viii. tama, Jap. atama, head, governs aginba in gen. and is obj.
of negai. negai ke ne, desiring am I, B. nahi, Jap. negai. Kalahasa, Kalaba is followed by the gen. particle sa. il atatsuka, the death striker, murderer, governs Kalaba in
the gen : see ch. viii.
elne, comes, here 3rd sing. pres. ind.
zuzitu, B. to destroy, governed in inf. by elne. atakaka, neighbour, governs Antsu in gen : see ch. viii. Ankatatsukasa, of the Ankatatsuites : here the modern B.
plural ac replaces the old ne, and is followed by the
genitive particle sa. Makaba, the king or chief of Ankatatsu, governing the preceding in the gen. kamala, molester, governed by the following zuzitu : see
ch. viii.
Batsu Tahasakasa, comTp^ve Ankatatsukasa : as Tahasakasa bears the sign of the genitive, Batsu which governs it
may precede.
hane, to place, ba with the infinitive sign ne, governed by
elne.
ilsa maka, il death, sa gen. particle,77iaA;a,stroke,governed
by bane,
takesa, hostile, adj. from Jap. teki, an enemy, B. etsai : it
may be a genitive, hence the za7'i is a lord of enmity.



390 THE HITTITES.
Hamath V

(Continued) :
zari is conjectural, the characters being obscure: it should
be followed by the postposition ne, to. Jerabis III
:
tsula, a fragment of some preceding word, untranslatable. sahaka governs Kata in the gen. as Katanesa ; it may be
B. 5;^</ia/<;o,outsider, foreigner, or Jap. ^iT/a/vU, opponent,

Matake, the opponent or sahaka, whose name Matake united with m^ata, king, governs Komuka in the gen. with sa. Salamanesera, Shalmanezer, governs the whole sentence through nebasine.
nebasine, a verb formed from nabitsi, master : it is 3rd sing.
pres. ind. in spite of inf. termination ne, which takes
the place of tstv, thus avoiding a double sibilant. It governs soMketsii Salaka.
sanketsu, see Stone Bowl. Salaka, the Saruc, or Assaracus of the Greeks, son of Shalmanezer. Sasgane Saniassinesa, see ch. ix : the city governs the
people in gen. plu. kikulaku, J. kiku and raku, falls from obedience, 3rd sing.
pres. in(l. :.see ch. ix. Komana Kamesinesa, same construction as Sasgane, etc.
Sagara ka alku ba, places power in Sagara, for places in the power of Sagara.
korosu, J. kills, 3rd sing. pres. ind.: see ch. ix.
ri tori, holder of power, J. erretor B. : see ch. ix. Properly ri tori should precede korosu : this form therefore is
rhetorical.

THE HITTITES:
THEIR INSCRIPTIONS AND THEIR HISTORY.
CHAPTER IX.
The Hittites in Egypt (Continued).
ZoHETH had the good fortune to marry Sherah, the daughter of Beriah. She is said to have built Beth Horon, the nether and the upper, and Uzzen Sherah. The Hebrew word, to build up, is used to denote the founding of a family as well as of a house
or city, but ever since the days of Cain, who built a city and called it after his son Enoch, the custom of commemorating the birth of an illustrious child, by imposing its name on a town continued to obtain, so that Beth Horon and Uzzen Sherah may be taken to represent at least two of the sons of Zoheth and Sherah. They are the Horus and Achencherses who immediately follow Amenophis in Eusebius's version of Manetho's eighteenth dynasty. To the name of Achencherses the note is appended : " Under him Moses led the Jews in their Exodus from Egypt." The wives of Seti Menephthah were Twea and Tsire, the last being the Sherah of the Kenite record. Josephus calls her Acencheres, but wrongly places her after Horus, although two masculine Acencheres are placed after her. Uzzen Sherah as Achencherses, Acencheres, Cencheres, Concharis, and in the Irish annals Cingcris, is always connected with the Exodus of Israel or some singular calamity that befell Egypt. In Greek tradition he was Cenchrias son of Poseidon, and Cenchreae, the port of Corinth on the Saronic gulf, commemorated him, while the gulf itself, like the Italian Surrentum and the Aurunci, bore the name of his elder brother Horon or Choron. But the most familiar Greek form of his name was Cinyras, who by various

writers is made the father or grandfather of Adonis, or is identified with him. Adonis is the god Atin-re of the 'Stranger Kings of Tell el Aniarna in Egypt, among whom Eesa or Ishi appears, and as a man represents his ancestor Othniel. He was worshipped at Byblus in Phoenicia and in many parts of Greece, his rites being celebrated by priests who shaved their heads after
the fasl)ion of the Egyptian priests of Isis. Lucian says that the
ceremonies lasted two days.^ On the first all the people went into mourning, coffins were plaeeil before every door, and pro
cessions tilled the streets in which the images of Venus and Adonis were carried to the sound of mournful music and the
loud wailing of their votaries. Many of these carried boxes or vases in which they had reared half-grown herbs, emblematic of the immature age of the god, and these gardens of Adonis tney carried at the close of the day to the neighbouring sea or stream, into which they cast them amid great lamentation, to perish. But the second day was one of rejoicing, in which they celebrated the resurrection of Adonis from the dead. The story of the death of Adonis is that he was a prince beloved by Venus, who,
in spite of her entreaties, exposed himself in the chase, until at length, having wounded a wild boar of unusual strength and ferocity, the animal turaed upon and slew him. This is supposed to have happened at the Adonis river in Phcrnicia, which in the words of Milton :
" Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood, Of Thammuz, yearly wounded."
The wild boar is a fable, for the fate of Adonis was always
associated with water. Not only was the river artificially
coloured by his piiests so as to appear to flow with blood, but, as
has been told, the emblematic gardens were thrown into the water to die. Lucian also says that a head formed of papyrus, or a vessel of papyrus containing a letter, was annually thrown into the sea at Alexandria in Egypt and floated to Byblus, and by its arrival there informed the women of Byblus that Adonis was found. Athenaeus and iElian describe a fish called Adonis which was equally at home in the sea and on land, spending half

THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 3
its time on the shore, and the naturalist thought it was so called
because Adonis, the son of Cinyras, was in love with two
goddesses, one of the land, the other of the sea.^ In another place ^lian mentions a large lish found in the Red Sea which the Arabians called Perseus.^ Now Cynurus was a son of the Greek
Perseus, so that all these particulars relate to the overthrow of the Pharaoh of the Exodus in the Red Sea.* The spectacle of the Egyptians whom Israel saw dead upon the sea shore long dwelt in the memory of the coast tribes, and, when they saw the singular fishes basking on the rocks or sandy beach from which the waters had receded, it was but natural to name them after
the lord of the submerged host. There is much confusion in the Greek accounts of Cinyras and Adonis. ApoUodorus places at the head of his genealogy Cephalus, followed by Tithonus, Phaethon, Astinous and Sandochus the father of Cinyras, whose sons were Oxiporus and Adonis, and whose three daughters died in Egypt.^ Tithonus is also made a son of Laomedon, whose name as Ulam Bedan is repeated in that of Phaethon. There is evidence of a union of the family of Leophrah and that of Bedan the Zimrite in the Assyrian record of the Patinians, some of whose kings are called Lubarna ; and in the geographical nomenclature of Palestine, where the
transported Canaanitic Beth Horon the upper, was in the vicinity of the tomb of Bedan the Pirathonite. Astinous is, therefore, a disguise of the name of Ishgi, who must have married a daughter of Bedan. His wife's name on the monuments is Taia, of whom M. Lenormant says : " This queen was not an Egyptian ; the monuments represent her with light hair, blue eyes and rosy cheeks, like the women of northern climates. An inscription preserved at the Cairo Museum mentions her father and mother by names which are not Egyptian, and not even belonging to any foreign royal family." ^ Sandochus the son of Astinous is Zoheth. Professor Sayce has exhibited the Cilician connections of this name, and the Cilicians, be it remembered, are the Charashim

•whose valley in Moab Josephus calls that of the Cilices.^ Sandes was a Cilician god, and Sandochus is said to have gone to Cilicia from Syria and to have founded Celenderis there. On the Assyrian monuments two Cilician kings are mentioned, bearing the names Sanda-sarvi and Sandu-arri.^ Stephanus of Byzantium states that Adana and Sarus founded the city Adana, and that they were gods, along with Ostasus, Sandes, Cronus, Rhea, Japhetus and Olymbrus. These are chiefly Etlinanite names, Adana being Ethnan or Othniel ; Sarus, Seraiah ; Ostasus, Isghi in an Astinous-like form; Sandes, Zoheth; and Ol^mibrus, Leophrah. The change of Zoheth to Sandes, Sandacus, Xanthus, Zacynthus, is analogous to that which transformed Hod into Hind and Bedad into Pandu and Pandion. Pausanias associates Zacynthus with Eryx and Archon, who is Rakem the uncle of Bedan.^ The Irish annals also connect his father Ishgi with that Zimrite, making him as Ith the son of Breogan, and representing Taia the wife of Ishgi by Tea the grand-daughter of Ith and wife of Heremon.^" The Latin version mediates between Rakem and Bedan by calling Ishgi or Acestes the founder of Segestae near Eryx in Sicily, and representing him as the son of Egesta and the river-god Crinisus ; while Egesta is the daughter of the Trojan Hippotas who sent her away to Sicily, lest the monster who ravaged Ilium in the time of Laomedon should do her an injury.^^ Butes is called the son of Eryx, so that a marriage of Bedan with
the daughter of his uncle Rakem may reconcile all the accounts, and this is confirmed by the statement of Pausanias that Lamedon of Sicyon married Pheno the daughter of Clytius, which Clytius as denoting the Gileadite family can have been no other than his uncle Rakem.^^ Apollodorus gives to Sandochus in marriage Thanacea, or, as some editions read, Pharnace, the daughter of Megessareus or Megessaras, names which it is hard to connect with history, unless Megessaras be an amplification of the name Sherah, and Thanacea

a corruption of Tahath, thus inverting the nomenclature of the Kenite and monumental lists. She was the mother of 'Cinyras, who married Methnrme, daughter of Pygmalion of Cyprus, and was by her the father of Qxiporus and Adonis. Panyasis, according to Apollodorus, had" a different story which made Adonis the son of Thoas king of Assyria and his own daughter Myrrha.
Tliis is the story that Ovid has versified, but he replaces Thoas with Cinyras. From many sources Sir Isaac Newton reconstructed a story of Cinyras by which he attempted to explain the fall of Vulcan from heaven.^^ Thoas married Calycopis, daughter of Othreus king of Phrygia, and acquired the name of Cinyras from his dexterity in playing on the lyre. Bacchus, having entered his home and intoxicated the king, injurecthim in
his marital relations, but as a solatium made him lord of Byblus and Cyprus, where he grew enormously rich and lived to the time of the Trojan War. Adonis was the son of Calycopis. Here is a plain confusion of Zoheth's union with Sherah and that of Hadar with her cousin Mehetabel, for Othreus is Hadar. Much might be reported of Cinyras, but the contradictory stories would only
confuse, and their contents are not to edification. He is not the father of Adonis, but the same person, for Cinyras was a name of
that divinity.^* Thoas, who is called his father by Panyasis and others, denotes not Tahath but Zoheth, and is thus the same person as Sandochus. His mother Sherah is a Pharaoh's daughter, but Mehetabel, her cousin, whose father was Thothmes II., is the saviour of Moses. As Myrrha Sherah appears to have been the accomplice or victim in an act of the vilest incest, recalling the story of the daughters of Lot. The Greek traditions are only too true. M: Lenormant says of Rameses II. : " This Sun-king of
Egypt increased the royal harem to an unprecedented extent. During the sixty-seven years of his reign he had 170 children, 59 of them sons. Considering himself superior to all moral laws, he even went so far as to marry one of his own daughters, the princess Bent-Anat." ^^ Mr. Osburn quotes an inscription in which a Pharaoh, whom he calls Thothmosis, is styled the brother

6 THE HITTITES.
of his mother, and between this Thothmosis and his fathoi" and grandfather Mesphres Thothmosis he places the name Acencheres.^* The same horrible story is told of the Indian Prajapati and his daughter Sarawati, who, represented by a river, was said to flow with blood ; it is repeated in Irish tradition, which makes Aongus Tuirmheach the father and grandfather of Fiachadh Fearmara ; and in the British legend of Vortigern.^^ Professor Max Midler has identified the Vedic Saranyu with the Greek Erinys, those avengers of evil deeds who came to represent the remorse of an
accusing conscience.^^ The two Horons are their originals, Horon the Tachatton and Horon the Elyon or Gelyon, whence came Aurunca and Suessa Aurunca of the Italian Aurunci, the Hiranya Aksha#.nd Hiranya Casyapa of Indian mythology. Sons of the injured Zoheth, they were the natural avengers of his honour and their mother's shame. In the evils that befell Uzzen Sherah or Acencheres, and for his sake fell upon all the land of Egypt, the ancient world saw the hand of divine retribution and gave to it the name of those most wronged. Leaving the history of Zoheth and his sons for later consideration, we must retrace our steps and take up the main Egyptian line after the death or abdication of Mezahab. Tahath or Thothmes II., who married his daugher Matred and introduced the Zoroastrian creed of which Mithra was the centre, does not seem to have done any memorable deeds beyond commencing some buildings in Ethiopia which were completed by his successors. We have seen that Saul or Osortasen III. and Leophrah or Amenhotep II. were his contemporaries, the latter at Elephantine and the former at Abydos and in Lower Egypt. When Saul died and Ophrah met his fate, there was a time of anarchy. The CymroZerethite dynasty, which had powerful allies in Chaldea and Mesopotamia, took possession of all Southern Palestine and Arabia Petraea, and probably made common cause with the representatives of the Ammonian line in Thebes. In Lycopolis or Siout in Central Egypt the name of a king Rekamai has been

found, who represents what was in the time of Jabez the viceregal family of Mareshah. The son of Mareshah was Chebron or Hebron, who as Chebron or Chebros follows Amosis or Meshai with whom he was really contemporary, in the beginning of Manetho's eighteenth dynasty. A son of Chebron was Rekem, who may be the Rekamai of Lycopolis, supposed to be a Shepherd king. The descendants of Rekem in succession were Shammai, Maon or Magon, and Beth Zur. The latter name in Hittite was Zur-vuna, and in geographical nomenclature was Saravene in Northern Commagene. It was probably the original of the divine name Serapis, whose fanes in Greece Pausanias connects with the Argive ^gyptus and with Alcon son of Hippocoon, who is Rekem. The Serapium in Lower Egypt marks another stage in the fortunes of Mareshah 's family, and their final stand in Egypt was made at the Serbonian marsh that extends almost to the river of Egypt called Arish after Mareshah himself. Lycon or Lycopolis ma^ have received its name from Rekem, and the facts that Zur-vuna was in Egypt and that the Deltite kingdom of the Anubite Ammonites continued, are indicative of the support that the obstinate Thebans received, not only in repelling the
three kings, but in retaking the short-lived empire of Saul. Typhon had not yet taken refuge in the Serbonian bog. It was the southern Pharaohs who fled, as .Tosephus tells us from Manetho. His account is that Amenophis collected the lepers and impure people of the land (probably the Aadtousor Jahdaites whose name is translated, the impure), and set them to work in
the quarries, at the same time granting at their request the city
of Avaris as their residence. There a priest of On or Heliopolis united th^m and other tribes in Egypt and Canaan in a confederacy. This Osarsiph, who may possibly be Zur-vuna, gave his people new laws opposed altogether to those of the Egyptians, requiring them to destroy the sacred animals, and have no fellow^
ship with any tribes beyond the bounds of their confederation. Marching southward to the number of 200,000, they ravaged the country, setting towns on fire, profaning the temples, and making the priests cook the sacred animals with the wooden idols, after which they stripped them and drove them out of the land. Amenophis sent his son Sethos, surnamed Rameses, to a friend of

his in Ethiopia, and marched against Osarsiph's host with 300,000 of the most warlike of the Egyptians. But his courage failed him, and he retreated into Ethiopia without an engagement. " For the king of Ethiopia was under an obligation to him, on which account he received him, and took care of all the multitude that was with him, while the country supplied all that was necessary for the food of the men." Concerning the anarchy
and historical difficulties of this period, M. Lenormant writes
:
" Everything shows us a time of trouble, of continual revolution,
and of civil discord. No doubt part of the disturbances, of which the monuments bear traces, must have been contemporary with Har-em-Hebi, and have lasted during the whole of his official
reign. In that period, we repeat, there are obscurities still impenetrable in the present state of knowledge, and which new discoveries alone can dissipate." -"
The Greek traditions confirm the statement of Josephus. Tyndsnteus, who was now Hadar, fled from Tentyra and Abydos to the representative of the line of Aphareus or Ophrah, and had an asylum granted him in Talmis, opposite which a new Dendur soon arose. And Danae, with the infant Perseus, and perhaps the aged Tahath his father, found their way also to the court of Dictys. Thus the Elephantine kingdom became the refuge of two monarchs, and its king Ishi, a third Amenhotep or Amenophis, might Justly arrogate to himself the title of King of Egypt. The same account is given in the Indian scriptures of the flight of the royal line before the Kshattriyas or Achash
tarites, and of the birth of Parasara, Parasu Rama and Urva, the
avengers of the slain in after years, in exile and deep distress.^^
Here, however, the real difficulty begins. Manetho's list of the
eighteenth dynasty is terribly confused, yet he recognizes only one Thothmosis and one Rameses, while modern workers among the monuments find four Thothmes and three Rameses. Mr. Sharpe proves by monumental evidence that Thothmes II. married Queen Mytera or Nitocris, the successor of Menthesuphis, in the language of the contemporary Kenite scribes.

Horus, father of Mutretem or Mutiietem, and M. Lenormant says that Rameses I. was the grandson on the mother's side of Hai^enihebi.2'^ According to Mr. Sharpe, that grandson was Thothmes III.-^ According to Sir Gardner Wilkinson, Rameses I. traced his descent from Amenophis I., or the Kennezite Meonothai son of Hathath and Abiezer.^* The name Rameses, the son of the Sun, does
not occur in the Kenite list at all. It is probably a religious title tirst made use of by Tahath or Thothmes II. as the reviver of the old Horite line of Ra, which desisended to his son Beriah and to
Uzzensherah, the offspring of that monarch. It is possible that the second Tahath married into the family of Meonothai, and thus counted his descent from the Amenophids, but the honour which he accorded to Amun shows that he allied himself with the Jabezites or Amenemes. It follows, however, that Thothmes III. and Rameses II. are one and the same person, and that the forty-seven years of the former are included in the sixty of the latterEusebius gives to Rameses a reign of sixty-eight years. A6cording to Josephus, the expulsion of the Shepherds took place in the reign of Thothmosis, but the Bible statement that the captive Jews built for Pharaoh the cities Pithom and Raamses connects him with the latter name, for the Tahaths were the descendants of Etam, Atmos, or Pi. Atum, after whom Pithom was called.^^ The name Rameses, although not a personal name, and thus valueless in the comparative study of traditions, is useful as indicating the point at which the old line of Ra regained Egyptian sovereignty, and completely confirms the Bible story of Egyptian rule and Israelite oppression. There were only two supreme Pharaohs on the throne between the fall of the Hycsos and the Exodus, the old king who died, and the young successor who perished in the waters of the Red Sea. The old king was the Greek Perseus, the Indian Parasu Rama, and the Egyptian Thothmes III. and Rameses II. He was thus Beriah of the Kenite record, who united two dynasties, being the son of Tahath II., the native Pharaoh, and of Matred the daughter of Mezahab, the last of the Hycsos-Ammonian line.

The monuments show that Mehetabel, the daughter of Tahath II. and Matred, was much older than Beriah, thus discrediting the romantic Greek legend of Danae which makes Perseus her first-born. With her parents she found refuge from the tumultuary Hittites and Carians, who were ravaging Egypt to the very borders of Nubia, in the kingdom of Ishgi. Although this son of the great Leophrah had married a daughter of BedaU) who even then it may be was acting as regent for his kinsman, the youthful Baalhanan, and was thus associated with the ally of the Egyptian spoilers, he courteously received the fugitives. The descendants of Jabez and his son Mesha were sacred in his eyes, for he called himself the first prophet of Ames and Isis, or of Mesha and Hathath. Also the southern land which constituted the kingdom of the Tahaths seems to have been left under his government, when the second of that name went to Thebes to claim the empire that had been guaranteed to him with
his Theban spouse, for one of his officers, Necht-Ames, is termed " superintendent of the double storehouse of all the gods in Takahti and the god Ames in Xenti." At the court of Ishgi another refugee from cruel enemies obtained shelter, Hadar the son of Saul, and he succeeded in gaining Mehetabel for his brideHe thus became a fourth Thothmes, for the infant Beriah was
the third, and as such his consort's name is Mautemva, or, if the boat-like hieroglyphic at the foot of her cartouche be read hari, the boat of the sun, Mautembari. Her Ammonite descent is clear, for, assuming royalty as regent for her aged father and infant brother, she wrote upon her monuments, " King Thothmes, she has made this work for her father Amun." Hence she is also called by the Theban name Amun-nou-het. Still another name borne by her is Thermuthis, which is the Egyptian Toer Maut or great mother, out of which the Greeks made Andromache and Andromeda. Homer could not if he had tried been guilty of a greater paradox than that which converted the chief enemy of the Trojans into their protector Hector, the husband of Andromache, for these are Hadar and Mehetabel. That Hadar's queen was as warlike as himself cannot be averred, although her monuments represent her dressed as a man and engaging in foreign conquests, for these representations may be attributions to the ({ueen regent

of the acts of her warlike husband. It wa.s indeed Adrastus who led the Epigoni back against Thebes. Prior to this conquest, however, we learn from the stories of Ixion, Zohak, and Dictys, that a struggle had taken place in the Elephantine kingdom. The two sons of Ishgi, probably no older than the youthful Beriah, if indeed they had attained his years, were the puppets of adverse factions, of which that of Zoheth favoured the heir of the Theban throne, while that of Ben Zoheth, whom the Egyptians called Zaiath-Khirrii, and the Assyrian*?, Sandu-arri, was
opposed to, and desired to injure, him. The latter is the Polydectes who sought to force Danae to marry him. Taking his father Ishgi's name, he is the Ixion who entrapped his fatherin-law Deioneus into a fire pit to his destruction, and sought to win the affections of the wife of the Pharaoh who, according to Tzetzes, expiated him, and for these offences was bound upon the wheel. The descent of Ixion is from Phlegyas or Bela, or from Peision or Pachnan, and his wife Dia agrees with Taia, the wife of Ishgi. But that Ishgi's son Benzoheth was the criminal appears from the Persian story, in which Zohak served his father or father-in-law Mirtas the Tasi as Ixion served Deioneus, being himself Biurasp, a descendant of Beor.^^ It seems probable that
the aged Tahath fell in the contest that ensued, being the Jamadagni, peaceful sage, whom Parasurama avenged equally with Siphthah or Zabad, and his three sons, that fell before Thebes. The Polydectite faction was subdued, and Zaiath-Khirrii driven out of Egypt to swell the Hittite horde in Canaan. Hadar and his royal consort took Thebes, where she set up two obelisks in memory of her father Thothmes, one of which still stands amid the ruins of Karnak. Seated at last upon the throne of her grandfather Mezahab, she had her brother Beriah crowned as Rameses II., the second son of the Sun and guardian of the Mithriac faith, and as Thothmes III. the heir of the ancient Egyptian line of Tahath. But while the young king was the son of the Sun and of Thoth, she did not allow him to forget his maternal ancestry, calling him Mei Amun, the beloved of AmmonFor fifteen years at least Mehetabel kept the empire for her brother, not only pushing her border northward and limiting

the region overrun by the Hittites and Philistines, but Crossing over into Arabia and enriching lierself with the spoils of Yemen. At Senmeh and Amada in Nubia, her husband Hadar, as Thothmes IV., erected monuments, in which he rendered adoration to his father Saul as Osortasen III. 'There he conquered the negroes. But in the north he left his name upon the Sphinx, that Hittite monument at Gizeh, as a sign that the empire of the Jachdaites was at an end. Of his career of conquest there is no record beside, save that the Zerethite Rutennu of Mesopotamia paid him tribute, and this means much. It means that Caphtorim and Philistim were driven out of Egypt, hovering, nevertheless, like hungry lions, upon her north-eastern borders ; that the alliance made between Saul and Michael of the Xoite kingdom by the marriage of Helen to that Anubite prince was ratified ; and that the palmy days of Beerothite sovereignty in Gebalene were restored. Hadar was the hero of the eighteenth dynasty, who fought its battles from the Euphrates in the north to distant Yemen and Ethiopia in the south, while his queen, as regent for Beriah, sat upon the Memphite throne. Already he has appeared as the overthrower of the Cymro-Zerethite kingdom on the shores of the Dead Sea. Farther south in Arabia Petraea he recovered the mines opened by his ancestor Hadad, and set up his queen's name with that of her brother Beriah as Thothmes III., consecrating the peninsula to her as Hathor the mistress of Mafkat. Beraiah did not like his sister's tutelage and would willingly have cast it off, yet dared not, for Hadar the Beerothite was the mightier of the two men, and a single word from him would have been enough to bring all his brother Hittites, a numberless and valiant host, into the land they had wrested from the ancestors of the Thothmes long years before. There is a singular
nobility in Hadar's character. Brave as a lion, rich and powerful, he not only endured the ill disguised dislike of the petulant Beriah, whose egregious vanity made him jealous of his brotherin-law's fame, but modestly effaced himself, ascribing all the honour of his warlike achievements and great constructions to his consort and the sovereign for whom she exercised the functions of regent. The second Rameses is said to have reigned
sixty-six years, but his reign must have been longer, for his



THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 13
successor had only been twelve years on the throne when death overtook him. and at this time Moses was eighty years of age. At the birth of Moses, Ramescs exercised regal authority, for his was the edict that the infant sons of the Hebrews should be put to death. Prior to this time the subjugated dwellers in Goshen had been condemned to hard labour as builders of the treasure cities Pithom and Raamses, and on the monuments of Thothmes III. and Rameses II. they are represented at this task, the victims
of cruel oppression. " They are more and mightier than we," said Pharaoh of the children of Israel, and this was probably
true, so far as the native Egyptians whg adhered to his fortunes were concerned, for many of its Amorite families had passed into Palestine, and others in the Arabian desert were waiting, along with the expelled Moabites, for the death of Hadar or the decay
of his power to wrest Canaan from the Hittites.^^ The alliance of Rameses with Hadar the Beerothite, and his descent from the Ammono-Hittite kings of Thebes, did not please the families of Shechem, Gibeon, and Seir. But for the support of Hadar and the Xoite Michael, Rameses would never have gained his throne, nor, gaining, would have been able to keep it. Hadar was at the height of his career, and his wife Mehetabel was still nominally the regent, when the infant Moses was laid in the ark of bulrushes and placed among the papyrus plants on the brink of the Nile. Rameses was still young, for he reigned sixty-eight years after this, young, tall and handsome, every inch a king, but proud, crafty, vicious, and cruel as the grave. He had issued the edict to slay the children ; his officers had approved it, and by
none might it be gainsaid. Yet one there was whose right royal mother heart revolted at the fiendish counsel, and who expostu
lated, but all in vain, with her younger brother, to whom she had
been as a mother while her husband's strong arm had secured
him Egypt's wide dominion, for, so far, there is no record that Rameses had fought a battle in person. Pharaoh's daughter saved the infant Moses and adopted him, for her one son Shimon, the Esfendiar of the Persians, was away at the wars with his father Hadar, an Agamemnon, king of men, dear to the hearts

14 THE HITTITES.
of the Egyptians, who longed to see him on the throne.^^ This Pharaoh's daughter was Mehetabel, and that is why the HebraeoKenite record mentions her name, the only name of a consort given to the kings that reigned in Edom. Josephus calls her Thermuthis or Toer Maut, the great mother, probably the affectionate title she bore among the Egyptians as mother and all to young Rameses and his people. Homer may be pardoned for his historical blunder in makincr Andromache daughter of Eetion, king of Thebes, and mother of Scamandrius, the wife of a Trojan Hector, on account of the beautiful picture he draws of the white armed matron, so full of motherly love and tender solicitude for her husband's welfare. None but she in all the broad land of Egypt would have dared lo brave the tyrant and save the Hebrew child. Other writers mention her, but so confusedly that
their statements add nothing to our knowledge. Artapanus calls her the daughter of Palmanothes, which looks like an inversion of her true name, and the wife of king Chenephres, her name being Merris. According to Bar Hebraeus, she was Trimuthisa, called Damris by the Hebrews, the daughter of Amenophathis and wife of Knaphra^ But the true name of the queen regent and saviour of Moses survives to this day on the Lower Colorado in America, among the Mojeves or Amockhaves, who have a tradition that Mathovelia or Matevil once lived with them in a casa grande, but the casa was broken down, and he dei)arted into the east to a mountain where dead warriors go.^^ It is strange that the lineage of Mezahab, for such are these Mojeves, should hold in honour the granddaughter of the last Jahdaite Pharaoh, seeing that she was the expeller of his Caphtorim from Thebes and Coptos, and that her father Tahath and husband Hadar were alike enemies of the descendants of Jabez. Although Rameses or Beriah was in a sense the lord of all Egypt, there were three monarchies in that land more or less independent of his sway. Michael and his brethren held the eastern part of the Delta ; Ishi and his son Zoheth occupied Elephantine
;
and Hadar and his son Shimon disputed in a measure with their

brother-in-law and uncle the sovereif,'nty of the whole country.
It is yet difficult from the joint testimony of tradition and the monuments to reconstruct the history of the long reign of him who has been regarded as the greatest of the Pharaohs, and whose mummy has so recently been brought to light. Neverthe
less it is clear that his reign consists of three distinct periods. In the first, he was under the guardianship of his sister Mehetabel, and Hadar fought his battles. In the second, he was at times
in friendly, at others, in hostile, relations with her son Shimon, whose death he seems to have compassed. And in the third, he was supported by the valour of his son-in-law Zoheth, the Seti of the monuments. The first of these has been already illustrated. The second calls for information concerning Shimon and his sons. Hadar the father of Shimon was the first Persian Darius, so that Persian history should tell the story of his family. It does so, but with as much confusion as that which reigns in Homer's poem
on the fall of Troy. The cause of this confusion is the change of
relation from enmity to friendship and from friendship to enmity
brought about by the many alliances of rival Hittite and native Egyptian families. Already Hadar as Gudarz has been found in Mirkhond warring on the side of Thebes instead of against it, yet betraying his true position as an Adrastus by the twin circumstances of a sanguinary defeat and subsequent glorious victory. His son Shimon as Esfendiar again is falsely made the son of Gushtasp and the great enemy of the patriarchal Rustam, who, as the son of Zaul, should be his own father. A Persian
tradition reported by ^lian serves to connect the nursling of the Simurgh with his grandson, for it states that Achaemenes was
brought up by an eagle.^^ Plato's scholiasts represent this Achaemenes as the offspring of Perseus and Andromeda, instead of Perses, who is generally made their son. Half the truth is here, for Andromeda, daughter of Cepheus, is Mehetabel as Toer Maut, the descendant of Mezahab and Ziph, the sister of Beriah or Perseus, and the wife of Hadar. Other Greek traditions display similar blunders. Agamemnon, who is Shimon and Achaemenes, is rightly the son of Atreus, but in marrying Clytemnestra, the
21 De Animalibus, xii. 21.



16 THE HITTITES.
daughter of Tyndarus, he is made to ally himself with a daughter of his own line, inasmuch as Tyndarus or Tyndareus is a form of the dynastic name Hadadezer. But the story that Clytemnestra was betrothed to a son of Thyestes, from whom Agamemnon took
her, and that he suffered death at the hands of his unfaithful wife and her paramour, ^Egisthus, son of Thyestes, coupled with that of the enmity of the Persians to the race of Zohak, lets in a flood of light upon the history of Shimon, showing that he mar
ried a princess who stood in some relation to the Kenezzite kingdom at Elephantine, and that Zoheth, son of Ishi and Taia, who
replaced him as the general of Rameses, was the cause of his death. Further Greek traditions make Orestes the sou of Agamemnon, but restore the great enemy of Troy in Tisamenus, the son of Orestes, who with his four sons was driven by the Heraclidse out of Argos into Achaia, and who fell fighting against the lonians, as Esfendiar died by the hand of Rustam. According to Pausanias, the four sons of Tisamenes were Daimenes, Sparton, Telles, and Leontomenes. Persian history gives Esfendiar but one named Behmen, whose surname Ardeshir explains the Greek Oreste's. But the Kenite record presents the true names of the four as Amnon, Rinnah, Benhanan, and Tilon.'*^ Of these Amnon corresponds to Daimenes, Behmen, and Memnon, and Tilon to the Greek Telles. To Diodorus, Shimon was Osymandias, whose tomb at Thebes he describes as the work of Memnon of Syene.^' He tells of the enormous statue of his mother, on whose headpiece three queens were represented, showing that she was the daughter, wife, and mother, of a king. On his own statue were the words, " I am Osymandias, king of kings ; if anyone would know how great I am and where I rest he must destroy these works." Within the lofty chamber of the tomb the king was represented subduing the revolted Bactrians with an army of 400,000 foot and 20,000 horsemen, the army consisting of four divisions commanded by his four sons, and by the side of Osymandias a lion marched. Mr. Xenrick supposes that the Rameseum is the monument of Osymandias, whose name may relate to that of Simandu, called a son of Rameses III., and points out
32 1 Chron. iv. 20. 33 Diod. Sic. i. 2, 5.



THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 17
the similarity between the pictures in it and those described by
Diodorus, in particular the fortress of the so-called Bactrians surrounded by a river, and the king attended by his four sons. The (jlreek accounts of Memnon call him an Ethiopian or a Persian of Susa, the son of Eos and Tithonus, who was governor of Persia for Teutamus the king of Assyria. The Rameseuin also was anciently called the Memnonium, and the great colossus of Thebes which responded with musical tones to the beams of tlie rising sun bore the name of the same hero. Shimon is well determined as Amunoph TIL, for that monarch was the son of Thothmes IV. and Mautemva, the Kenite Hadar and Mehetabel. But how can the name Amunoph or Amenhotep be explained ? The first Amenhotep was Meonothai, son of Hathath the Kenezzite, and the second was his son Leophrah. The third should have been Ishi, the son of Leophrah. The son of Hadar and Mehetabel could not trace his descent from Leophrah, unless the second marriage of Hathath and Mesha was deemed sufficient to give Mesha's descendant Mehetabel a claim to Kenezzite ancestry. The solution seems to be found in the fact that Taia was the wife of both Ishi and Shimon. Now Tith
onus, called the father of Memnon, is also made the father of Phaethon, from whom came Astinous or Ishi, and his son Sandochus or Zoheth, and another Tithonus was the son of the Trojan Laomedon. Tithonus seems to be a myth, and Memnon is given as the husband of the widow of Ishi, and the usurper of that monarch's title as the third Amenhotep. It is his name that appears
upon the vocal statue. He was one of the greatest builders among the Pharaohs, and his monuments are at once the grandest and the most perfectly executed of those that adorn the valley of the Nile. At TJiebes he enlarged the temple of Karnak and built the greater part of that of Luxor. At Syene and Elephantine other temples of beautiful workmanship, bearing his name and that of his consort Taia, mark him as the possessor of the Kenezzite kingdom, which had not passed out of the hands of the sons of Kenaz since the first Sekenen made his submission to Apepi. His own name he conferred upon the fortified city of Semneh beyond the second cataract, and in the temples he there
built were recorded his victories over the negroes, whom he pur

sued beyond distant Napata, and against whose incursions he interposed the fortifications of Soleb, whence Tirhaka in later days carried off the sculptured lions that adorned them. In Semneh also he united with his name that of his uncle Beriah as Thothmes III., in an act of adoration to his great ancestor, the third Osortasen or Saul. At Napata itself he left a temple to mark his conquest. But elsewhere his memorials appear at Silsilis, Eilithyia, and in the Serapeum of Memphis. Nor did he forget his mother's dowry, won by the gallant Hadar back from Cymro-Zimrite foes, the land of Hathor, mistress of Mafkat, whose mines Hadad opened when the world was young, and on which he impressed his royal name. He was a warrior, this king
of men, as Homer calls him, a warrior like all of his race, Beerothite, Bharatan, Parthian, British, and, though the Briton who calls him
self such sails under borrowed colours, they are colours of which he need not be ashamed. It was perhaps no very chivalrous thing to conduct a slave hunt in the Soudan, but it was a more humane thing to bring home prisoners than to return with the scalps and ears of the slain, as many a Hittite army did, in barbarous triumph. Did Beriah as Thothmes III. take Carchemish ? Its name is on Shimon's monument as his conquest. Did he as Rameses II. overthrow the men of Kadesh ? It is recorded as an action of Amenhotep III. It was he, Shimon, Amenhotep III., who pacified Naharaina or Mesopotamia; and there is no foe of Egypt iif the reign of the so-called Rameses II. and Thothmes III., whom the son of Pharaoh's daughter did not meet victoriously. Little he seems to have cared for the vainglorious and gloomy despot who oppressed Israel in Goshen, and held regal state at Memphis, while the strong arms of his sister's husband and son sheltered him from his enemies. At Luxor h^ styled himself " Horus, the strong bull who rules by the sword and destroys all barbarians: he is king of Upper and Lower Egypt, absolute
master, son of the Sun. He strikes down the chiefs of all lands ; no country can stand before his face. He marches and victory is
gained, like Horus, son of'Isis, like the Sun in heaven. He over
turns even their fortresses. He brings to Egypt by his valour
tribute from many countries, he, the lord of Ijoth worlds, son
of the Sun."** This was no empty boast, as many traditions tes

THE HITTITKS IN EGYPT. 19
tify, for the words are those of the Persian Esfendiar, to whom Guslitnsp, who seems to represent Eameses, promised the succession to the kingdom on condition of his subduing all lands. He
succeeded after a career of constant victory, and Gushtasp for reward cast him into prison. When the enemy returned and there was no bulwark of the empire, Esfendiar was taken from
the prison liouse again triumphantly to lead the troops of Iran to conquest. And then, seeing with jealous eye that his son's fame
eclipsed his own, the perfidious monarch sent him against the great warrior Rustam, by whose hand he fell.^^ Let nephew take the place of son, and this is the story of Ramese? and Shimon. But he is Memnon too, the blameless Ethiopian and viceroy of Persia, who subdued all the nations between Susa and Troy, and fell by the hands of Achilles. And he is Agamemnon, the tall Grecian hero
so noble, so graceful, and dignified a warrior as Trojan Priam never saw before, a kingly man, the far ruling Agamemnon, son of Atreus, whom shameless Helen yet judged a good king and a brave soldier. He also met his death in his own house, like Memnon, fabulously slain by Achilles, and Esfendiar by Rustam, for the historical Achilles, and Zaul, father of Rustam, was Saul of Rehoboth, the grandfather of Shimon. The Greek story which makes iEgisthus, son of Thyestes, and Cly temnestra, the assassins of Agamemnon, imputes the crime of Shimon's death to Zoheth, the eldest son of his wife Taia. Shimon must have been the protector and upbringer of Moses, whom his mother Mehetabel had saved from death. Arabian authors call the queen who adopted Moses and accepted his faith Asia, the daughter of Mozahem.^^ Rabbinical writers represent the young Hebrew as a dweller in Ethiopia, which, strange to say, they call Dinhaba, and as the husband there of an Ethiopian queen in
whose service he warred against her rebellious subjects.^^ The
language of St. Stephen is agreeable to this tradition, for it affirms that Moses was mighty in words and in deeds, and that he was full forty years old when it came into his heart to visit his
brethren the children of Israel.^^ The monuments indicate that

20 THE HITTITES.
Mehetabel's regency did not extend to the twentieth year of Beriah, so that she must have bequeathed her adopted son to the care of Shimon, and him the youthful Moses must have accompanied to the court of queen Taia at Elephantine, where his education in the learning of the Egyptians was received, and whence he afterwards followed Shimon and his four sons to many fields of conquest. With them he may have been in Arabia Petraja at the mines, at Kadesh in Palestine, and at Carchemish on the Euphrates, traversing on the way that land of Canaan promised to
the patriarchs, his fathers. At Elephantine also he made a princely convert of the royal line of the Sekenens, the Kenezzite Jephunneh, father of Caleb, another like Jabez, more honourable than his brethren, who gave up rank and fortune with the abomina
tions of Baal Peor, to be an exile for the love of God.^* With such an example as Shimon before him Moses could hardly fail to be a princely man, but there is no evidence that his protector
shared the Hebrew's faith. The gallant Beerothite reigned thirtysix years, and then seems to have been succeeded by his son Aranon, the Behmen of the Persians, and the Pthahmen who is men. tioned with Amenhotep III. at Silsilis. The so-called Stranger
Kings claim alliance with him in their city of Tel-el-Araarna, but their ungainly figures and imbecile features, with the unl)oun(U'd
servility of their attendants, present characteristics most unlike
those of the Osortasens, and indeed those of the Hittite rulers in
general. One of them, called a son of queen Taia, who rejected the title Amenhotep IV. for the name Atin-re-Bakiian, is the most idiotic in appearance, yet he mentions Hadar or Thothrnes IV., and pays divine honours to Shimon or Amenhotep III. He was a worshipper of the solar disc under the name Aten, and this, a-j well as his name Bakhan, connects him with the native Pharaohs of Elephantine, descended from Othniel and his father Kenez, the Pachnan or Apachnas of the lists. The names of these Pharaohs are not in the Kenite record, for Amnon, Rinnah, Ben
hanan, and Tilon, are irreconcilable with them. The joint evidence of tradition and the monuments tends to show that with Pthahmen or Amnon the Egyptian rule of the Beerothites came to an end, and that the family withdrew to a Syrian home, there

to appear in after centuries as Benhadads and Hadadezers. Yet M, Lenormant thought that there was some connection between these Stranger Kings and the Hebrews. " There are curious resemblances between the external forms of Lsraelitish worship in the desert, and those revealed by the monuments of Tell-elAmarna. Some of the sacred furniture, such as the table of shew bread, desdti bed in the book of Exodus as belonging to the Tabernacle, is seen" in the representations of the worship of Aten, but not at any other period."*'' Doubtless Bezaleel and Aholiab, who were placed over the work of the Tabernacle, had exercised their art in Egypt, so that, while guided in the general plan of its
furniture by divine instruction, the details would naturally be according to models with which they were familiar, and such
models would be those of Tell-el-Amarna.*^ Before the death of Shimon, Moses must have refused to be called longer the son of Pharaoh's daughter, and, passing from the security of the Upper Kingdom to the Memphite region, over which Beriah exercised his tyrannical rule, visited his enslaved brethren. It may have
been his project as a warrior to lead them forth from slavery, but
their objection to his interference showed him the fruitlessness of such an attempt, and taught him that the time of redemption was not yet come. Crossing over into Arabia Petraea, where the subjects of Shimon, but Kenites of the family of Hamath, dwelt, he was in safety from the pursuit of the Hebrews' oppressor at Memphis, and at freedom from the irksomeness of court life in the palaces of Thebes. When the Persian historians reach the reign of Behmen, they flounder an,d fall into anachronisms innumerable. Behmen set aside his sonSassan in favour of his daughter Humai,who launched
her infant Darab in the traditional ark. A miller or a fuller took up the child, and he became king, and was followed by a son Dara, after whom came Iskander, or Alexander of Macedon. With Behmen, the guidance of the Persian narrative ceases, and the great men of Beeroth slumber for a time. But a new hero comes upon the field, the Keuezzite Zoheth, who is Zohak, the well hated of the Persian's soul, and the Greek Dictys, whom

Perseus set upon the throne of Seriphus, in the room of the tyrant Polydectes. It may be that the kings of Tell-el-Amarna were the Polydectites, the Beni Zocheth or Zaiath-Khirrii of the Egyptians. The readers of the Egyptian monuments find several Setis ; the Kenite record knows but one. Seti was of shepherd descent, it is agreed, and the lon^ ears of Labradh and Midas adorned his monuments. He is also called Menephtah, a name derived from his ancestor, Meonothai. Had the succession been rightly noted, he would be the fourth Menephtah in regular descent from Meonothai, Leophrah and Ishi. He must have been almost as old a man as Beriah, so that the princess Sherah, eldest daughter of the lattei*, whom he married, must have been very much younger than her husband. Serah, or Tsire, as the readers
of the monuments call her, was not Seti's first wife. Her name was Twea, and her posterity may appear at Tell-el-Amarna But the children of Sherah were the heirs to the Egyptian throne, although Rameses had many sons, of whom two, Rephah and Resheph, are mentioned in the Kenite list.*"^ Many of these sons did not survive their long lived father. Rameses was fortunate
in his generals, who might better be called his allies. His brother-in-law, Hadar, had set him on the throne and vanquished the enemies of the early part of his reign ; his nephew Shimon had made the middle of that reign prosperous ; and then Zoheth,
the Kenezzite, as the son-in-law of the haughty monarch, became the support of his declining years. Many students of Egyptian history make Seti Menephtah the son of Rameses I. and father of Rameses II. although others regard him as only the son-in-law
of the first. Accordiilg to the Kenite list, and the testimony of tradition, the first Rameses was the same person as Thothmes II. who called himself Rameses as the restorer of the ancient line of
Ra or Reaiah, and the institutor of the worship of the sun in its modified Zoroastrian form. He was the father of Rameses II., Thothmes III. or Beriah ; and Hadar was his son-in-law, the true guardian of the throne for the youthful monarch. Seti Menephtah then, the son of Ishi, and son-in-law of Beriah, and only Pharaoh of that name, was one of the greatest and most warlike

of Egyptian monarchs. His first exploit seeins to have been the overthrow of the Beerothite regeiioy, for Abydos, the Avith which
Hadad, the son of Bedad, first made the capital of the Osortasens, he occupied, and in it he erected the great temple of Osiris. He
drove the posterity of Shimon out of Thebes, and built there the magnificent palace of Kurnah, and the Hall of Columns, in Karnak, on the walls of which his actions are recorded. Then intelligence reached him that the Shasu or Shuhites, who still kept the Serbonian marsh towards the river, named Arish after their hero Ma Reshah, had made a descent upon Egypt, and were besieging Zal, near the Bitter Lakes, which was a memorial of
the great Saul or Osortasen III. built as the frontier fortress of the mining country in the Sinaitic peninsula. Seti drove them back into the desert. Afterwards, marching through Canaan, he met with no resistance, but on the contrary the tribes flocked to his standard, proud of the Hittite lord of the Egyptian host. His
great exploit in the Hittite country was the capture of Kadesh, which is said to have been on the Oronfes. This identification is more than doubtful, especially as the people whom Seti found there were not Hittites, but Aimaru or Amorites. There were two places named Kedesh in Palestine proper ; one also called Kishon, to the south-west of the sea of Galilee, and another known as Kedesh Naphtali, between that lake and the sea of Merom. The latter was famous in Canaanitic history, as adjoining Razor and Harosheth, and Safed near it would answer to Shabutana, which the Egyptian accounts place in the vicinity of Kadesh. Josephus calls it a Mediterranean city of the Tyrians, by which he must mean that it. was surrounded by a moat, traces of which are still visible, and thus also it corresponds to the Kadesh of the monuments. Seti made a treaty of peace with Mautnar, King of the Hittites, and restored Kadesh, of which the Amorites had deprived him, to his possession. But the Rutennu or Zerethites were not included in this peace. Driven out of their stronghold on the Nahaliel by
Hadar and his valiant son, they now occupied eastern Syria, and the basin of the Euphrates. There Seti sought them out, and broke still farther their power, compelling Babylon, Singar, and
Ninev^eh to sue for peace. Another Hittite family, which had inaugurated the Akkadian kingdom in the person of Regem, son

of Jachdai, but was known as the tribe of the Remanen or Armenians from his son Harum, and that. seems to have dwelt between Lebanon and Carchemish, he conquered, thus pacifying all the northern nations on the east of Egypt. But on the west the Robu or Rephaim, who had given their name in its Lapp form to Libya, made encroachments, it may be in concert with the Xoites, for the Kenite list of these kings ends with Michael
and his brethren. It is, therefore, probable that Raineses had made an end of Xoite royalty. However, Seti repelled the Libyan invaders, and having thus brought all Egypt for the second time in history under one sceptre, he reconquered the Arabian kingdom of Yemen, which ITadar and his heroic consort had first subdued. The fleet that carried the Egyptian troops to Yemen was unavailable for the more important service required on the Mediterranean. Accordingly Seti carried out that great engineering triumph attributed to Sesostris, performed in later times by the Macedonian Pharaohs, and re-achieved in modern days by French genius and British* capital, the opening of the Suez Canal.
Phoenicians in part manned the navies that coasted along the two seas thus connected, but most of the sailors who served in it were Hittites, well accu.stomed to brave the terrors of the deep, the Shardana and the Takkaro, descendants of Zereth and Tsochar, who, like free born sons of Heth, served Pharaoh when it pleased them, and when it did not, made war upon his people. M. Lenormant says : " The features of Seti are too handsome,
and of a regularity too classical, for the pure blood of Mizraim ; they denote an origin drawn from another people." This people he shows to be the Hittites or Shepherds, whose deity Sutech was worshipped at Tanis or Zoan, where Rameses II. traced his descent from Set Aahpeti, on a red granite tablet erected by his son-in-law Seti, in which he erroneously represents a period of four hundred years as having elapsed since the time of the great Jabez,*^ Two hundred would be nearer the mark. Manetho states that Sethos reigned 55 years, which would make him survive Rameses. Sir Gardner Wilkinson says : " His long reign and life appear to have ended suddenly, for after he had completed his tomb, he ordered an extra chamber to be added to it,
" Manual, i. 241 : Records of the Past, iv. 33.

which was never finished ; and the figures left in outline prove that time was wanting to complete it." ** Did he perish with the successor of Rameses in the Red Sea ? There is a dirge of Men
ephtah that is significant.
" Amen gave thy heart pleasure,
he gave thee a good old age, a lifetime of pleasure followed thee, blessed was thy life, sound thy arm,
strong thy eye to see afar, thou hast been clothed in linen, (or o-one to the gap, to which the dead went in the sun boat) thou hast guided thy horse and chariot of gold with thy hand the whip in thy hand, yoked were the steeds, the Xaru and Nahsi marched before thee, a proof of what thou hadst done, thou hast proceeded to thy boat of cedar wood, a boat made of it before and behind, thou hast approached the beautiful tower which thou thyself made, thy mouth was full of wine, beer, bread and flesh,
were slaughtered cattle, and wine opened ; the sweet song was made before thee, thy head anointer anointed thee with Icami, the chief of thy gardenpools brought crowns, the superintendent of thy fields brought birds,
thy fisherman brought fish, thy galley came from Xaru laden with good things,

ousness, thus confirminor the account of the death of Shimon which the story of Agamemnon tells, for in the latter the son of Thyestes is the murderer.*'' The horrible narrative of Thyestes
mirrors the crime of Rameses rather than those of his son-in-law. Another Greek story of Zoheth calls him Xanthus of Thebes, and makes him fall by the hands of the Messenian Melanthus, through a stratagem of the latter. As Sandochus he is connected with Cilicia, and made the father of Cinyras or Adonis. But as the Greek Xanthus of Psophis and Zacynthus, and as the Latin Acestes of Segestae, no information is added beyond the fact of his maternal relation to the Zimrite Bedan and Rakem. The Mahabharata calls him the majestic royal rishi Sindhudvipa, son of Ambarisha, thus giving Ophrah, his grandfather, a name similar in form to the Greek Amphiaraus and the British Ambrosius. He made a pilgrimage to Prithudaka, where he obtained Brahmanhood, and became a composer of Vedic hymns. The Raja Tarangini lauds him as the virtuous king Siddha, saved
from destruction in the field of Siva, who governed the world sixty years, and, surrounded by his retinue, ascended bodily to heaven.*^ This looks very like the Dirge of Menephtah, the story of a man whose dead body could not be found. His descendants Hiranyakcha and Hiranyakula are the two Horons, and then comes Mihirakula, concerning whom it is reported that, wishing to remove a rock in the river Chandra Kulya, and being divinely informed that it would move at the touch of a virtuous woman, he assembled all the women of his kingdom and found only one, Chandravati, the wife of a potter, who successfully stood the test. Thereupon, in the exaggerated language of Ihe east, he slew thirty million noble dames, with tlieir husbands, brothers and sons. Then he voluntarily cast himself into the fire to find relief from a disea.se that devoured him. The statement that in his time men did not respect the persons of their daughters-in-law is also significant.*^ But Herodotus tells a similar story of Pheron, the successor of Sesostris. The Nile had swollen and overflowed the country, and a wind suddenly coming up caused it to rise in

vast waves. Pheron, enraged, threw his spear with violence at
the stream, for which he was struck with blindness. The oracle of Buto informed him that a chaste woman alone could restore
his sight. Accordingly he made trial of all the women of the land, to no purpose for a time ; but at last he found a virtuous one, whom he married, and the rest he burned in the city Ery
thrabolus."*^ Diodorus, who repeats the narrative, calls Pheron
Sesostris II., and states that the first Sesostris also became blind,
and consequently destroyed himself after a reign of thirty-three
years.^°

CHAPTER X.
The Hittites in Egypt (Concluded).
Turning now to Beriah himself, the monarch for whom Hadar, Shimon, and Zoheth fought, conquered, builded, and governed, we find him to be the Perseus of the Greeks, as his genealogy and early history attest. Herodotus speaks of the Watch Tower of Perseus, which was the Pharos to the west of the Canopic mouth of the Nile. The same historian tells of an enclosure at Chemmis,
sacred to Perseus, and reports the people of that city as claiming the hero for their own, and worshipping him in a temple
bearing his name.^ Diodorus also testifies : " It is said also that Perseus was bom in Egypt, and that the Greeks transferred the birth of that hero, and of Isis even, to Argos, through the fable of lo metamorphosed into a heifer." ^ Strabo again mentions the presence of Perseus in Egypt, and ascribes the name of the Red Sea to his son Erythras.^ Strabo, Pomponius Mela, Pliny, and Solinus agree in placing the adventure of Perseus with the Ceto or sea monster at Joppa, in Palestine.* Even in the time of St. Jerome, there were rocks near the city called in honour of the rescue of Andromeda, " The Place of Deliverance." Josephus says that Joppa " ends in a rough shore, where all the rest of it is straight, but the two ends bend towards each other, where there are deep precipices and great stones that jut out into the sea, and where the chains wherewith Andromeda was bound have left their traces, which attest the antiquity of that fable." All
the actions of Perseus were placed in the heavens, a personification of the constellations which could only obtain currency with the authority of a very powerful monarch. Now, in the Rameseum at Thebes there is a chamber, the ceiling of which represents the
heavens, in which the stars are grouped into figures. One of

these exhibits Rameses II. preparing to throw his javelin at a huge monster, the latter part of whose body narrows into a tail like that of the seal. It bears hieroglyphics which may be read as Meseramaut.^ This mapping out the heavens and mythologizing the stars was the work of the vain king, who caused the
chamber to be made and its ceiling to exhibit his exploits, and
the Toer Maut or great mother whom he professed to deliver from the power of the Ceto was doubtless the daughter of the Hittite or Kheta king Khitasira, whom he added to his harem, and on whom he conferred an Egyptian name. Creuzer pointed out the identity of Perseus and the Persian Mithras, and others have shewn that Mithriac worship prevailed in Ethiopia, whither Perseus is said to have gone.® The Indian Parasu Kama combines the Perseus and Rameses names, and is famous as the slaughterer of the Kshattriyas or Achashtarites, just as Thothmes III." and
Rameses II. were for their victories over the Hittites.^ The name Beriah is not found on the monuments of these two Pharaohs as they have been read, but this is probably because the name has not been expected. Baenra is found on monuments of Menephtah, but w^hether it relates to Rameses or to the subject of the writing is not clear. One passage appears to make Menephtah his son : " Victorious by the valour of Amen was the king of the Upper and Lower Country, Baenra beloved of Amen, the son of the Son of the Sun, Menephtah at peace through truth, giver of life." ^ The title Mei Amun or beloved of Amen, is the peculiar property of Rameses II. Rameses III. evidently deifies his father by the name Barui, when Amen Ra is represented saying to him : " Passed has my valour in thy limbs to destroy the invaded countries. I place Amen and Barui with thee, and Khonsu, Horus in
thy limbs, each god prevails, following in thy service to the perverse lands of the savages."^ Rameses II. often compares him
self to the god Bar, as in the poem of Pentaur.^'^

30 THE HITTITES.
In identifying the Pharaohs, Thothmes III. and Rameses II. one argument is that two long reigns of the oppressors of Israel are inconsistent with the Book of Exodus, w^hich is the only received history for the period to which they are said to belong. Manetho knows only one Thothmes and one Rameses, although he places them more widely apart than does the Kenite list. Their shields, giving not only the name Thothmes or Rameses, but also various titles of honour, are found confusedly, if they be different persons, on many buildings which one or more Thothmes and as many Rameses are together represented as having erected, so that there is hardly a temple or even a pillar of a Thothmes that a Rameses is not supposed to have restored or completed two hundred years after.^^ They overcame the same enemies in the same localities, and have the some products presented to them as tribute
by the .same peoples, under precisely similar circumstances.^'^ They worshipped the .same gods, honoured the same ancestors, and had identical family relationships.^^ Herodotus and Diodorus know neither Thothmes nor Rameses. Tacitus ascribes the tablet expounded by the Egyptian priests in the hearing of Germanicus, to a Rameses ; but modern investigators agree that it is of Thothmes. This very statistical tablet of Karnak mentions the setting up of a stele in Naharaina, and the form of the stele, as represented in the inscription, exactly corresponds to those cut in the rock at Nahr-el-Kelb, bearing the image of Rameses 11.^* Pliny seems to indicate, and Ammianus Marcellinus plainly states,
in his Greek translation of the hieroglyphic inscription, that the
obelisk now in the Piazza del Popolo at Rome, was erected by a
Rameses, while it really bears the name of Thothmes IV.^^ Mr. Henry Salt, an e&vly student of Egyptian monumental history, speaks of Rameses Thothmosis as contemporary with Moses
;
and Mr. Osbum, in a sketch of Egyptian history, suppresses all

the Thothmes.^*^ The first of the two Pharaohs mentioned in the Book of Exodus must be he, of whose reign bricks containing straw are found, and on whose monuments captives with Israel

itish features are represented engaged in brickmaking and build- •
ing. Mr. Kenrick, following Rosellini, calls this monarch Tliothmes III. ; while M. Chabas and Dr. Brugsch, on the authority of two papyri mentioning the Aperiu or Hebrews as this subject people, and of the rock inscription at Hamamat, decide for Rameses 11.^^ Manetho in one place, and Chaeremon, call the Pharaoh in whose reign Israel went out of Egypt either Sethos Rameses, or Amenophis, it being distinctly stated by them that Sethos and Rameses are names of the same person, and that Amenophis was father or son of a Rameses.^'' The majority of recent writers whose opinions are of value, including the Duke of Northumberland, Lepsius, Osburn and Lenormant, give their suffrages to Seti Menephtah, who is Chaeremon's Amenophath, son of the great Rameses.^^ On the side of Thothmes are found
Manetho, in another place, where he is plainly inconsistent with himself, if Thothmes and Rameses are not the same ; Julius Africanus and George Syncellus, and among the moderns. Sir Gardner Wilkinson almost alone.^*^ He says : " The rising of Sothis in the
reign of Thothmes III. now calculated by the learned M. Biot to correspond to between 1464 and 1 424 B.C., shows that my placing
his reign from 1495 to 1456 B.C., only differed from his real date
by about thirty years." "^^ Most writers place the first of the
Rameses about 1320 B.C., which will not at all tally with the Scripture account of the period that follows. The Kenite gene
alogies, illustrated by the monuments, the Hebrew record, and many traditions, present the second Tahath of the old Egyp
tian line as Thothmes II. and Rameses I. ; his son Beriah, as
Thothmes III. and Rameses II. ; and his son-in-law Hadar, as

Thothmes IV. The son of Hadar it exhibits as Amenhotep III., thus usurping the place of Ishi ; while Ishi's son Zoheth, the son-in-law of Rameses II., is Seti Menephtah ; and his nominal son, but really the child of Rameses, is Uzzensherah or Rameses
III., Hek An. When Thothmes III. was delivered from the guardianship of his sister, he proceeded to erase her name from the monuments, and to put his own in its place, and like Rameses II., he omitted all mention of that noble woman in the lists of kings. Seven documents constitute the Annals of Thothmes.^- From these we
gather that, at an early period of his sole reign, the people of Palestine had revolted, Thothmes took command of the army at Gaza and advanced northwards to meet the enemy, who were moving from Kadesh to effect a junction with the people of Megiddo, near the upper waters of the Kishon, where in after years Barak and Deborah overthrew the host of Sisera, and Josiah fell fighting against Pharaoh Necho, and where in the end of days the prophetic battle of Armageddon is to be fought. It is
also the traditional Magadha of Indian story, in which Jarashandha is said to have reigned ovei* the nations. Thothmes
defeated the Hittites of Kadesh, capturing all their chariots and camp equipage, but his prisoners only amounted to 340, and the number of the enemy's slain to 83. The fugitives took refuge in Megiddo, which soon after surrendered. The Egyptian army was largely recruited from the Hittite bands, so that the Rutennu or Zerethites of Nineveh and Asshur were compelled to make their submission. In subsequent campaigns Thothmes passed into Syria, concjuering the revolted people of Aradus in Phoenicia. Then he took Kadesh, supposed to be on the Orontes, by assault. This, however, is the same Kadesh that sent an army against him at Megiddo, nameh% Kadesh Naphtali. He found the Achashtarites of the line of Mehir in Mesopotamia, and these Naharaijia, as he terms them, were brought under his sway* In a poetical composition inscribed on a stele at Karnak, the god Amun addresses the king in language of which the following is an example :
^ Becords of the Past.



THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 33
" I am come— to thee have I given to strike down Syrian princes ; Under thy feet they lie throughout the breadth of their country. Like to the Lord of Light, I made them see thy glory, Blinding their eyes with light, the earthly image of Amen.
" I am come —to thee have I given to strike down Asian people ; Captive now thou hast led the proud Assyrian chieftains : Decked in royal robes I made them see thy glory ; All in glittering arms and fighting, high in thy war car." 23
The enemies overcome by Thothmes were the Nine Bow barbarians, perhaps the Hamathites, whose favorite number was nine, the Annu who named Ono in Philistia, descendants of the Jerachmeelite Onam, the Naharaina of whom the Rephaim and the Thapsacans were the chief, the Amu or Eraim, also called Shasu, being the Shuhites of Ma Reshah, the Taha and Sat undetermined, the Rutennu or Zerethites of Ardon, the people of Taneter, or Beerothites of a northern Tentyris, the Kefa or
Ziphites, the Asi, probably the rebellious Kenezzites, bearing Ishi's name, the Maten or Midianites, the Tahennu, descendants of Tehinnah, Rapha's brother, the dwellers in the isles of the Tena, one of which was Cyprus, called by the Assyrians Yatnan after the Hittite patriarch Ethnan, and the Remenen of Carchemish, descended from Harum, son of Regem, and grandson of Jahdai. The enemies overcome by Thothmes were chiefly the Hittite tribes, to whom may be added the Midianites, and one or two Japhetic peoples on the Mediterranean shore of Palestine. The
Carians of Ekron and other Philistines, with some Hittite tribes, aided the king in his conquests, which cover the same ground as
those of Seti Menephtah. Comparing the conquests of Rameses II. with those of Thothmes III., we find Sir Gardner Wilkinson saying : " The enemies the Egyptians had to contend with were mostly the same in the time of Rameses II. as of Thothmes III." 2* Discrediting the wide extension of empire attributed to Rameses as the great Se.sostris, M. Lenormant writes : " Far from having penetrated to the banks of the Ganges, he never carried his arms in Asia farther than Thothmes III. and Seti, and nearly all his campaigns were confined to northern Syria." ^^ In the early part of his reign there

was war in Ethiopia, the conduct of which was chiefly in the hands of viceroys, although Rameses seems to have been present
on one occasion to encourage his soldiers. Thothmes also gained victories in the same region. Then, as in the reign of Thothmes, all Palestine and Syria revolted and expelled the Egyptian garrisons, Kadesh as before being the centre of rebellion. The great event of Rameses' reign was the battle of Kadesh, which the bard Pentaur sang in strains of fulsome adulation. The king, sep
arated for a short time from his army, was beset by the enemy in force, but succeeded in making head against them, until his troops arrived on the scene of action. At Kadesh, near Shebetun, which is Safed or Sapheta, to the south of Kadesh Naphtali, the Hittites made a stand, for the Amorites had already driven them out of southern Palestine. The Naharina were there, and the Aradite descendants of Jered the Hamathite, and the Masu or Moschi, named after Mesha, son of the great Jabez. There also were the Kairkamasha or men of Carchemish, the Leka for whose relationship Amalek, Bethlechem, and Lecah the Shuhite compete, and the Mashanata, who were expelled Kenezzites, claiming the name of Megonothai. The Patasa descended from Paseach and namers of Thapsacus or Khupuscia, the Mauna or Maonites in the line of Laadah and Ma Reshah, the Dardanians of Zarthan, the Kerkesh or Zerachites of Karrak, the Katesh whose ancestor was Gazez, son of Haran, and father of Jahdai, the Anaukasa of the Rutennu, or Anakim of Arba and Ardon, and the Khilbu or Calebiies of the line of Ephron and Zohar, swelled the host. But Rameses, according to his own account,
overcame the Hittite leaguers, who hastened to make a treaty of peace. Soon afterwards, however, the Hittite suzerain died, and his brother Khitasar fought with the Egyptians. Another campaign took place, ending in a second treaty, and the alliance of the supposed conqueror to the daughter of the Hittite monarch. Nevertheless Rameses pushed his way northward into Plut'nicia, leaving records of his presence on the rocks near Tyre and Beirut. The Travels of an Egyptian, being the account of a journey made by a Mohar or military scribe in the reign of this Pharaoh, show that Egyptian supremacy was maintained in northern Syria, and that Takar Aaar, near Hamath, was a centre of Pharaonic power.



THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 35
The author also mentions Joppa as a place of note, thus in a measure confirming its traditional association with Perseus' story. But
his narrative breathes a feeling of insecurity such as is felt in
many parts of Palestine to-day, clearly indicating that Egyptian
conquest had not suppressed Hittite lawlessness.^^ There is every reason to think that Thothmes' battle of Megiddo and Rameses' battle of Kadesh are parts of the same campaign, represented in the legend of Perseus by the war with the Gorgon Medusa, and in Indian story by the twenty-one slaughters that Parasu Rama
made of the Kshattriyas. According to the Kenite genealogy, two of the sons of Rameses II. were Rephah and Resheph, and Telah was the son of the
latter. It is likely that one of these is the Rhampsinitus of Herodotus and the Remphis of Diodorus. In Herodotus, Rhampsinitus follows Proteus after Pheron, and in Diodorus, Remphis
succeeds Cetes, who may be Seti. But neither of these became
the successor of the oppressor of Israel. That successor was the nominal son of his daughter Sherah and Zoheth, or Seti Menephtah, w^ho was called after his mother Uzzen Sherah, and who ascended the throne under the name of Rameses III., Hekan. He is thus the Achencherses under whom Eusebius says that Moses led the Jews in their Exodus from Egypt. He is also the Nun
coreus, son of Sesoses, whom Pliny identifies with the Pheron of Herodotus and the second Sesostris of Diodorus, saying that he consecrated an obelisk to the Sun after he recovered the sight he liad lost. 2'' In the Phaethon genealogy he appears as Cijiyras or Adonis, son of Sandochus, and, in the story of Perseus, as Cynurus, son of that hero. George Syncellus makes Concharis the last king of Lower Egypt and the successor of Ramesse Vaphres. Africanus has three Achencheres in the eighteenth dynasty, all of whom reigned twelve years, and the same number is assigned to the Acencheres of other lists. No monument of Rameses III. Hekan has been found later than his twelfth year. Astronomy has been called in to settle the date of this Pharaoh, for a monu
ment at Medinet Abu makes the heliacal rising of the star Sothis
to coincide with his twelfth year. According to Syncellus, a
26 Records of the Past, ii. 109. 27 Pliny, xxxvi. 15.



36 THE HITTITES.
Sothiac cycle was completed in the fifth year of Concharis, but Sir Gardner Wilkinson places this event in the reign of Thothines III. Censorinus, who wrote his De Die Natali in the year 238 A.D., says that a Sothic or Canicular cycle had been completed about a hundred years before that date ; and as the cycle was one of 1461 years, it follows that the end of the previous cycle was in 1323 B.C.^ But Sir Gardner Wilkinson quotes M. Biot as making the heliacal rising of Sothis take place between 1464 and 1424 B. C, while M. Lenormant, referring to the same authority, says the coincidence occurred in 1300 B.C. The combined astronomical and historical evidence is not sufficiently proven to
discredit the Hebrew record, the truthfulness of which is attested by the confirmation of monumental records whenever they deal with the same facts, and that record places 480 years between the Exodus and the dedication of the temple at Jerusalem, which took place more than 1000 years before Christ.^^ In the lists and on the monuments the name of Horus is always associated with those of Acencheres and Rameses III. These are the Horons, half brothers and seniors of Uzzen Sherah or Hekan, the Hiranyas and Arunas of the Indians, the Hiranyakcha and Hiranyakula who precede that Mihirakula whose story, as told in the Raja Tarangini, is identical with those of Pheron and Nuncoreus, and is beside the record of the most infamous vice and fiendish
cruelty that the writer of the chronicle has to tell. The Horons have a curious history. Had the Aurunci of Italy left any traditions, besides that which connects them with Liparus and Auson, the namer of the Oscans, their relations with Rameses III. might have been better determined. The Indian traditions place the Aruna Ketus in Ketumala, and the traditions of the Quiches of Guatemala, who represent the Ammonite line of Anub, son of Coz, make Quauhtemalan a foundation of the Cachiquels descended from the grandmother Atit or Hathath, and one of whose chief kings was Zactecauh or Zoheth. All their kinffs were called Tukuches, and two of these, Zactecauh and Gagawitz, went down to the sea to fight the Nonohualcas and Xulpitis. They slew large numbers of these unhappy people and

pursued them into the sea, but a great cloud of dust was raised by magic between the fugitives and the Cachiquels, so that while the former rallied and fell upon their pursuers unperceived, they
were also aided by demons in the air, under the feet of the Cachi([uels, rising and falling upon them, till the pursuers fled, gaining solid ground as best they might and leaving many of their number stretched upon the watery field of battle. " This terrible defeat left a cruel impression on the tribes." ^° The remnant assembled on mount Oloman and decided to leave the scene of disaster and seek a home elsewhere. Traversinof land and ^ea and regions of intense cold, with the Quiches and Tzutohils, wnth whom they lost their language on the way, they came to Urran and Rabinal, and established there the kino-dom of Guatemala. Gagawitz plainly represents Uzzen Sherah, for he threw himself into a volcano to make it cease destroying the land and people,
and, succeeding in quenching its fires by the sacrifice of himself,
was restored to life, when festivals were instituted to commemorate his resurrection. But the story represents him as the murderer of Zactecauh, whom, as he was taking a great leap in imitation of Gagawitz, the latter pushed into an abyss that served him for a sepulchre. The strange legend gives in its own way the overthrow in the Red Sea and the consequent alliance of the Kenezzites in part with the Ammonites of the Delta, and with some of the Tsocharites, which is attested by the presence of Horonaim or the two Horons between the countries of Moab and Ammon. Some Kenezzites, including prince Jephunneh, were in the train of Israel. But there must have been a second Exodus from Egypt, led probably by the Horon?, who, from the connection of the Arunas with Ketumala, and of the Urran valleys with Guatemala, appear to have been worshippers of Atin Re, which god represents their ancestor Othniel or Godoniel. It is the form Godoniel that gives Ketumala and Quauhtemalan or GuatemalaAtin Re was represented as the sun with rays proceeding from it that terminated in human hands. Now, the most remarkable god of the Mayas and Quiches was Kinieh-Kakmo, the son of the Sun, who was represented in the act of sacrificing, touching one

of the sun's rays with his finger as if to draw a spark from it with which to kindle the wood of the altar. ^^ Among the Cachiquels, Kinieh was called Ouenech. But in southern California there is a tribe of Acagchemens belonging in point of language to the Aztec-Sonora familj'^, who worship a god Chinig-Chinich, a reduplicate form of Kinieh or Ouenech, although they say that their true god is Sirout, and that Chinig-Chinich was imposed upon them by invaders from the east. The more northern Shoshones, who are occidental Zuzim, apply his name to the tobacco they burn in his honour, thus combining religion with pleasure, and this name as Kinnikinnik is used to denote the Gornus sericea or silky cornel, the leaves of which the Indians are supposed to mix with their tobacco.'^ Thus Sekenen Ra, Apachnas, Kenaz the father of Othniel, for he is this Kinieh, Ouenech, and Chinig-Chinich, besides being known to almost all Indian tribes as a very inferior and adulterated kind of tobacco^ has the honour of appearing on the labels of superior brands encircled by the revenue stamp of the United States. The worship of the Hittite gods is surely near its end when ChinigChinich furnishes old king Cole with material for his pipe. What a commentary, ludicrous though it be, is this on the words of the prophet Jeremiah : " A voice of crying shall be from Horon
aini, spoiling and great destruction. . . For in the going down
of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction. Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness. . . O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer

thy plants are gone over the .sea, they reach even to the sea of

SO unnaturally that it must have been the result of artificial compression. They were Flatheads, and claim kindred with the Chinuks of north-western America, whose name is that of the ancestral Chinig. But their language is akin to that of the Asiatic Koriaks and Tchuktchis, whose deity Gnai Gonozeh is Chinig Chinich, somewhat disguised, yet recognizable. According to Abernethy, the Koriaks flattened the heads of their children in the same way as the Chinuks.^^ Among the latter it is a sign
of nobility, and they will not allow their slaves or neighbouring
subject tribes to adopt the practice.^^ They are skilful carvers
in stone,and their grotesque aboriginal designs, chiefly on pipes, are much sought after by antiquarians. In Peru the Chinchas were Flatheads.^" But the most interesting American nation that practised this barbarous and unsightly art, although it has now fallen out of use, is that of the Choctaws, who are American Tshekto, or, as the Asiatic people who call themselves by that name are usually
designated, Tchuktchis. ,The artist traveller Catlin expresses the desire which he did not realize, to institute a comparison between the Choctaws and the Chinuks, arising out of their common possession of the deformed skull.^^ The story he tells of the Choctaw deluge is more like the Quiche account of the disaster that drove the Cachiquels into exile. " There was total darkness for a great time over the whole of the earth ; the Choctaw doctors or mystery men looked out for daylight for a long time, until at last they despaired of ever seeing it, and the whole nation were very unhappy. At last a light was discovered in the north, ftnd there was great rejoicing, until it was found to be great mountains of water rolling in, which destroyed them all, except a few families who had expected it, and built a great raft on which they were saved." ^^ The Chinuks, Chinchas, and Choctaws are undoubtedly of the same race as the Cachiquels of Guatemala, but while the
latter lost their languaofe, becominof semitized, the former did not.
Their migration route was northern, and largely continental, while that of the Mayas, Quiches, and Cachiquels, was southern,

insular, and oceanic. The Chinuk language contains in abund
ance the tl click so characteristic of the Aztec, and which is also
found in some Lesghian dialects of the Caucasus. Strabo places the long headed Siginni in the region of the Caucasus, and there Pliny and Mela situate the Macrocephali, but while the first
named writer finds th6m in the east of that range, the two latter assign them to the west. Hippocrates expressly states that the
Macrocephali flattened their children's heads. *° The Avars are said to have been Flatheads, and their name connects them with the Iberians or Georgians, and with the Lesghian tribe Avar.*^ Flatteaed skulls havp. been found in that Scythic region, the Crimea. The Huns artificially changed the shape of the head, and Attila is represented as one in whom the natural feature had. been thus distorted. Among the South Sea Islanders, the Kanakas of the Hawaiian group are Flatheads. The weight of evidence gives to the Kenezzites, descended from the first king that reigned in Edom, and deriving from Ethnan the youngest son of Ashchur and Helah, the honour or disgrace of inventing this barbarous custom, of which the Elephantine kingdom of Egypt was probably the birthplace. From them it may have been communicated to other tribes, for it is represented in the sculptures of the Mayas of Yucatan. Rameses Hekan was not responsible for the circumstances of his birth, but he was for allowing statements of these to appear on the monuments, both Rames.side and Thothmian. Morality
must hate been at a frightfully low ebb, some indication of which is found in a British Museum papyrus of the time of Rameses containing caricatures which are said to be " licentious in the extreme." *^ The companion stories of Pheron and the Indian Mihirakula tell the same tale. A great decadence in the
arts accompanied the fall in morals, barbaric structures and coarse sculptures taking the place of the great achievements of
Hadar and his son Shimon. In the latter part of the reign of Rameses II., exactions far exceeding the power of the people to comply with were laid upon them, and formed the subject of cor

respondence between two great functionaries of the kingdom,*^ The reign of his son was characterized by plots, the authors of
which suffered severely.** But whether in person, or by deputy, Hekan was a warrior. The palace at Medinet Abou in Thebes recounts his victories. The Lebu and Takkaro, who were Hittite Rephaim and Tsochari, the latter of whom possessed
a fleet, made incursions in the north-west, and these he repelled for a time, but they returned to the attack, and with them the
Philistines, rightly identified with the Pelasgi, and the Hittites of Syria and Mesopotamia made common cause. Rameses again advanced to meet the enemy and overthrew the Hittites, it is supposed, at the Orontes. Then, descending to the coast of the Mediterranean, he encountered the Philistines and the Mashuash, evidently preparing to take up their abode in Egypt, for they were accompanied by their wives and children in rough ox-carts. The Mashuash were probably the Moschi of Mesha, the Caphtorim allied with the Philistines. Rameses carried their camp
by assault, with the slaughter of over 12,000 of the enemy. Another invasion by sea and land was led by the Takkaro or Tsocharites, and with them came the Libyans or Rephaim, the Sardinians, Dardanians, or Zerethites, the Tyrrhenians or descendants of the Maachathite Tirhanah, and the Sicilians or Ascaloniaus of Philistia. They were defeated on both elements. Minor wars took place in Syria and in Yemen, and all the strengtli of Egypt had to be exerted, not to make foreign conquests, but simply to keep the enemy from occupying its sacred shores. Then after Rameses Hekan had reigned about twelve years, the divinely commissioned Moses stood before him to ask freedom for his oppressed fellow Israelites. If Seti, the nominal father of Hekan, was alive at the time, he must have known Moses, but, being the murderer of Shimon, he would not be likely to favour that monarch's friend, and the adopted son of that queen whose name he had helped Mei Amun to erase from the monuments; nor would Pharaoh give heed to the prophet who sought to deprive liim of his most peaceable and useful subjects, for Jannes and Jambres, his magicians, cast discredit upon the

Divine legation of Moses, and with lying wonders mocked the miracles that attested it.*' These two practisers of the black art are mentioned by the Rabbins and by some heathen writers, but little dependence is to be placed on the stories told of them. Pliny, who states that magic originated with Zoroaster, and names as some of his successors in it Apusorus and Zaratus of Media, Marmarus and Arabantiphocus of Babylonia, and Tarmoendas of Assj'ria, also classes as adepts in sorcery Moses, Jannes and Jotapea the Jews, of whom the latter probably is Joseph.** Jambres in British history is Ambrose Merlin, or Merddin, who is to be distinguished from Aurelius Ambrosius, the Kenite Ophrah. This Ambrose Merlin was a magician, the son of a daughter of the king of Dimetia, born without a father, and he prophesied in a most enigmatic way before Vortigern, the king whose crime was the same as that of the second Rameses.*^ The . Greeks confounded the two Ambroses of British story in their one* Amphiaraus, whom they make a soothsayer as well as a warrior.
As the soothsayer, he had an oracle at Oropus in Attica, where those who looked for responses found them by lying upon a skin spread on the ground, in Celtic fashion.*^ He was the grandson of Antiphates, and great-grandson of Melampus or Rapha. This genealogy seems to be justified by his connection with Oropus, and by the fact that Ambrose Merlin was the worshipper of the two man-devouring birds of Gwenddolen, and a water dweller. As for Antiphates, he is the Netophath of the Kenite lists, who is connected with Beth Lechem as descending with that house from Salma. Netophath is placed far back in history, for the Egyptian Nuhotep who represents him was the father of Nahrai, a prince that has left a monument at Benihassan, on which is de
picted the arrival of a foreign family, once supposed to be that of Jacob, in the reign of Osortasen II.*^ Now Osortasen II. was a son of Hadad, who can only have reigned during the interregnum immediately following the death of Jahdai or Amenemes II., so that Netophath is thus made the contemporary of Coz, which he

THE HITTITES IJf EGYPT. 43
might well be as a grandson of Chedorlaomer. According to Mr. Osburn, the son of Nahrai was Prince Hamshe, and his was Sukenes, the last of his race to receive monumental mention.
Homer classes Antipha.tes, whom he calls the son of Lamus and king of the Laestrygones in his Odyssey, with man-eating monsters, such as the Solymi or Salmaites are said to have been. But he also mentions the prophet of that name, calling him the son of Melampus and father of Oileus, from whom came Amphiaraus.'*^ There must have been an alliance by marriage between the family of Kapha and that of Netophath, but the latter could not be the son-in-law of the former. The genealogy of the Neto
phathites is not given, or at any rate has not been found in the Kenite record, but in the time of David and among his chief captains were men of that family who had renounced their cannibal propensities. Such were Maharai the Netophathite, and Heleb or Heled the son of Baanah, a Neto[)hathite.^^ Now Baanah is a Beerothiie name, and another of David's captains,
who were almost all foreigners, was Nahari the Beerothite. This
is natural, for the Beerothites, descended from Hamath, were relatives of the Netophathites, descended from his brother Chedorlaomer, who is called by the Arabs a man of Thamud. The two names Maharai and Nahari are really divergent forms of one, and agree with Prince Nahrai, or as Lepsius calls him, Neherasi-Numhotep of Beniliassan. Nor could anything be more harmonious to historic truth than the exaltation of a Netophathite in the reign of the Beerothite Osortasen II. Ambrose Merddin again as son of a daughter of the King of Dimetia or Dyved exhibits his relationship with the Osortasens of Avith or Abydos, which, when transported to Syria, became Tibhath. Jambres
then was no mean man, but one of royal descent, in whose veins flowed the blood of Prince Nahrai the Netophathite, and that of
Kapha the Nairi, two families that tradition associates with bloodthirsty rites, and that the special traditions concerning Ambrose Merddin represent as the perpetuators of these when they had been abandoned by the rest of the world. It is probable that Jannes was also a Hittite, for Josephus mentions Jannas or
50 Odyssey, x. 106, xv. 242. 51 2 Sam. xxiii. 28, 29 ; 1 Chron. xi. 30.



44 THE. HITTITES.
Janias as a Hycsos king who reigned after Apophis or Jabez. These Hittite sorcerers must have come from some country outside of Egypt to the court of Rameses, so that there may be some
truth in the rabbinical stories which associate them with Balaam
or his family, for he flourished forty years later, inasmuch as Balaam's father bore the Hittite name Beor. That false prophet came from Pethor, a Hittite city, as the Assyrian monuments tell, which was situated by the river of the land of Ben Ammi or Ammon, not the land of the children of his people, as our English version has it. It is more than likely that the two magicians were princely hostages at Pharaoh's court, for it was the custom of the two Rameses to take the sons of the conquered kings as hostages, and such seems to have been the position of Ambrose at the court of Vortigern. In comparing the Indian story of Jarashanda, king of Magadha, with the accounts of Thothmes' battle of Megiddoand Rameses' siege and battle of Kadesh, many
coincidences present themselves. In the latter especially, men
tion is made of the drowning of two Hittite chiefs of Khilbu and Tonira, and in Jarashandha's story the chiefs thus perishing are Hamsa and Dimbika. Hamsa recalls the Netophathite Hamshe, son of Nahrai, and although he cannot be the same person, the family name may denote a later Netophathite, whose son Jambres may have been. In the Greek story of Amphiaraus he is said to have been swallowed up in an opening of the ground made by Jove to receive his favorite prophet. The Red Sea formed the opening that engulfed the water dweller. British tradition has preserved a confused account of the plagues of Egypt in the story that it rained blood for three days, and vast swarms of flies appeared, followed by frightful mortality among the people, in the reign of Rivallo, son of Cunedagius, for Cunedagius is the Greek Sandochus, father of Cinyras, and Rivallo is Rephah the legitimate son of Beriah, who as a resurrected Adonis, followed Uzzen Sherah on the throne of Egypt. ^^ The women who mourned one day for Adonis with their coflSns before every door, and their little gardens that they cast into the sea, on the next rejoiced, because Adonis was found. So Gagawitz threw himself into the crater and saved the Cachiquels,

but after a time came forth a living man once more. Some say that the Pharaoh of the Exodus, this Achencheres, did not perish. There is, however, no record of him after the twelfth year of his reign. Tabari says he repented in the depths and cried, " I believe in the God of Israel." But he believed too late, and sank beneath the wave that overwhelmed his host. It was a terrible calamity for Egypt, but a boon to one man, and that was the disinherited Rephah. " The King is dead : long live the King," was the hail thatggreeted him who had seen no hope of sitting, the rightful heir, upon the throne of the Pharaohs. The accession of Rephah may be taken to represent the finding of Adonis, for Herodotus, who calls him Rhampsinitus, says that he descended to Hades, and there gambled with Ceres, alternately winning and losing, and that on his return to the region of the living he brought back a golden napkin,^^ The Egyptians also instituted a
festival in honor of his return. Herodotus describes part of the ceremony attending this festival as the blindfolding a priest by
his fellows, who led him out of Memphis and left him to find his way to the temple of Ceres, twenty furlongs distant, his journey thither and back again being accomplished by the aid of two wolves. Rhampsinitus was no conqueror but the possessor of vast wealth, in connection with which an almost world-wide story is told. The nameless architect of the king's treasury, wishing to
make free with its contents, placed a stone in the outside wall in such a way that it could easily be removed by anyone knowing the secret, and, dying before he was able to avail himself of his act, communicated the knowledge of it to his sons. By this means they plundered the treasury, which when the king perceived he had traps set, and in one of them caught one of the brothers. But the other at his brother's request had cut off his head, so that the body could not be recognized. The king caused the body to be hung on the palace wall under guard, in hope that some relative of the dead man would be led to an exhibition of sorrow
by the sight of it. Moved by his mother's entreaties the surviv
ing robber, disguised as a wine seller, drove some asses laden with
wine-skins past the palace, when, as if by accident, one of the skins burst, and the wine began to escape. The guards being

furnished with drinking vessels, caught the spilling wine, and at length the robber left them in a drunken sleep, at the same time carrying off his brother's body. The amazed king set his daughter to catch the thief, but he left a dead man's arm, that he had fastened under his cloak, in her hands, and fled. Then Rhampsinitus
admiring the man's cleverness, offered publicly a reward if he
would reveal himself. He came and received the king's daughter in marriage, for he excelled the Egyptians, who excelled all the rest of the world in wisdom.^* ^ The Greek counterpart of this leuend is told by Pausanias Agamedes and Trophonius, sons of Erginus. descended from Phryxus, were the architects of the treasury of Hyrieus, king of Arcadia. They inserted the removable stone and plundered the treasury. Hyrieus, however, caught Agamedes in a trap, but
Trophonius, fearing detection, cut off his brother's head. Afterwards he was swallowed up by an opening of the earth in the grove of Lebadea.^^ Sir George Cox has set forth the identity of these stories with the Gaelic tale of The Shifty Lad and the Indian story of Gata and Karpara.^^ Karpara made a hole in the king's treasury, which contained the monarch's daughter as well as his riches, but, staying too long in the room to which he had thus gained access, was caught and hanged. His body was then exposed in order to catch his confederate, but Gata outwitted the guards, gained his brother's remains, which he burned, and carried off the princess to another country. Ajamidha of Sanscrit mythology, who should answer to the Greek Agamedes, is a descendant of Bharata, his father being Suhotra, and his grandfather Bhumanyu, while his sons Jahnu, Vrajana and Rupin became heads of the Kusikas.*^ Here Vrajana is Erginus, but he is also the Pandu Arjuna; and his ancestor Bhumanyu is Bhima or Bhimasena, another Pandu, the trio being completed by Yudishthira, of whose name Suhotra is a variation. But Bhumanyu or Bhima is the Persian Behmen, the Vohumano of the Zend Avesta, and he is the Beerothite Amnon, son of Shimon. Bhima was

THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 47
caught in the folds of the serpent Nahusha, but released through the mediation of Yudishthira. These plunderers of the treasures
of Rephah are, therefore, descendants of Amnon, the Beerotliite, whose son was Shemida or Shemidag, the Agaraedes of the story and the Sanscrit Ajamidha, and his sons were Achian, Shechem, Likchi and Anigam.^*^ Thus the family of Beeroth is carried down two generations later, and a Hittite Shechem is associated with Baal Berith instead of a Horite of that name. While Ahian is the Sanscrit Jahnu, his brother Likchi is the Sanscrit Riksha, who is Jahnu's brother. As for Erginus, he has no direct connection with the other persons named, but as denoting Rakem,
the Gileadite, he represents the alliance between the Beerothites and Gileadites constituted by the marriage of Shimon to Bedan's daughter Taia. The Greek story viewed Shemidah from the standpoint of the Gileadite genealogy, deriving him from Erginus of Clymenus of Phryxus, or Rakem of Ulam of Peresh. The Sanscrit accounts of Ajamidha, whom they also call Sumantu and Asvamedha, associate him always with Bharata. In western migration the Beerothite family appears as an element in the population of eastern Sicily, while the Gileadites of Rakem occupied the north-western part of that island. The
Beerothites are there associated with the Palici, whose leader
Ducetius shows them to have been the Tsochethite descendants of Belag the Ethnanite, the latter name giving the original of the volcanic mountain ^tna. But Adranus and Amenanus are made fathers of these Palici, and Symoethus and Enna and Engyum are connected with them, setting forth Hadar, Amnon, Shemidah,
Ahian and Anigam. The Hittite occupation of Sicily would require a monograph of no small extent, so that it can but be mentioned in these pages. Retracing our steps to the scene of history contemporary with the Kenite record, we find a kingdom of Amnanu in Chaldea connected with Urukh or Warka in ancient times, which Assurbanipal in later days places in Elam as Dur Amnani.^° Amenanus, Amnanu, Amnani are rare forms in mythological and geographical nomenclature, the tendency being to drop the reduplicate n. The ancient Amnanu is men

tioned by a King Sin-Gasit, whom Sir Henry Rawlinson calls Sinsada. His inscriptions, one of which is but partially inter
preted, are as follow :
1. " Sin-Gasit, son of Belat-Sunat King of Uruk, builder of Bit- Anna." 2. " Sin-Gasit, the powerful man, king of Uruk King of Amnanu, the palace of his royalty built." 3. " To Sarturda, his god, and Belat-Sunat his mother, Sin-Gasit, King of Uruk, King of Amnanu,

giving delight and pleasure." ^^
Looking for other kings of Uruk, through whom Sin-Gasit and his mother Belat-Sunat may connect with the Beerothite family, those named Ismi-dagan and Gungunu present themselves In Greek, Shemidah or Shemidag is Agamedes, in Sanscrit
Ajamidha, hence one expects to meet a cuneiform Ismidng as its
equivalent, for the languages of the cuneiform inscriptions strongly aspirate the letter ayin, making Lagamar of Laomer and Laguda of Laadah. The final an of Ismi-dagan has been added
to the original name to give it significance as " Dagon hears." It is likely that Gungunu is a reduplicate form of Ahian as Achian> which the Sanscrit better renders as Jahnu and the Greek as.^gina. Ismi-dagan is referred to by Tiglath Pileser I., who says : " BitKhamri, the temple of my lord Vul, which Shansi-Vul, high priest of Ashur, son of Ismi-dagan, high priest of Ashur, had founded, became ruined." He also mentions " Shamsi-Vul, my ancestor." ^^ An inscription of Ismi-dagan reads :
" Ismi-dagan, nourisher of Nipur, the supreme over Ur, the light of Eridu,
«• Records of the Past, iii. 18. « Records of the Past. v. 23, 24.



THE HirTITES IN EGYPT. 49
Lord of Uruk, the powerful king, King of Karrak, King of Sumir and Akkad, the relative, the delight of Nana."
Gungunu's two inscriptions follow :
1. " To Samas, the ruler tuda Ur, leader of Bit-Nirkinugal, Ningal ra tuda his kings for the preservation of Gungunu, the powerful man. King of Ur, for the establishing of Anu,
for the restoring of Ur, for Ur within Ur, the son of Ismi-dagan, King of Sumir and Akkad,
Bit-Hiliani built, Bit-Ginablungani built,
for his preservation he built."
2. " For the establishing of Anu,
for the delight of Ur, for Ur within Ur, The son of Ismi-dagan, King of Sumir and Akkad." ^^
Ismi-dagan as nourisher of Nipur exhibits his descent in the line of Hepher, and as the light of Eridu or Jered of the same family, confirms the relationship. Uruk and Karrak, however, can only have been his through the conquests of his ancestors, and' in no other way can he have been King of Akkad, since the Akkadians were Chaldean Jachdaites. But his rule over Sumir or Zimri might come in a legitimate way through the marriage of his grandfather Shimon to the Zimrite Taia, daughter of Bedan,
the Greek Laomedon. In a list of so called Cassite Kings of Babylonia, several Etirus appear among the Ulams and Buryases who represent the Zimrite names Peresh and Ulam.^^ The un
translated Tuda of Gungunu's first inscription recalls the Egyptian Teta as a name of Hadad, together with the Assyro-Hittite
Dadi and the Graeco-Phoenician Adodus, king of the gods, denot
ing the same ancestral hero. But how came Ismi-dagan or Shemidag to be as Agamedes the plunderer of the treasury of Rhampsinitus ? The story cannot be taken literally, for, although princes were often the superintendents of great constructions in Egypt,
there is no evidence that Shemidah was such, nor is it likely that occupying such a position, he would have been found guilty of

robbei-y. His family was one of great builders, and his grandfather Shimon specially excelled in the execution of magnificent
architectural designs. In this way the Beerothite line came to
be identified with architecture and architects. But Shimon and
his father Hadar had been the builders of the Pharaonic empire, ruled over by the second and third Rameses, and in it they had left themselves a corner, extending probably from the point of
the Sinaitic peninsula to the kingdom of the Kudurs in Edom, and this must have been the loose stone through which their descendant Shemidah was able to take to himself some of Egypt's treasures. The name Shemidag, with the prefix of the Coptic article, formed the Egyptian Psametik which the Greeks called Psammeticus, a name early known in Egypt, for a Psametik Munx was a priest of Cheops.^* To Shemidag as a descendant of Saul, the Persian Zaul, the story of Rodabeh properly belongs,
instead of to that ancestor, for the Greek story of Cinderella unites Rhodopis and Psammetichus. In Persian story, she is the daughter of Mihrab, a Greek Merops or Rapha, and it seems pro
bable that Shemidah did effect an alliance with the line of Hammurabbi, whom his confederate Trophonius of Lebadea would denote. This early Psammetichus unhappily finds no mention' in the obscure annals of Egypt for the period immediately following the Exodus. Greek tradition calls Shemidag by the name Thymoetes, the last of the line of Theseus and the son of Oxynias, which latter name may denote his grandfather Shimon, He is called the King
of Athens, and it is said that, on his refusal to meet the Theban Xanthus in single combat, the Athenians banished him. But a narration of Conon represents two sons of Hector, who had been banished to Lydia, returning to the Troad and taking possession of Mount Ida, where Eneas the son of Anchises dwelt, and driving that hero out. These sons of Hector were named Oxynius and Scamander. Conon says they regarded the country about Ida as their patrimony.^^ The original Ida was Edom and the Idumean mountain range, and the Idaei Dacytli who inhabited it may be easily recognized as the Edomites of Joktheel. After the time of

THE HITTITES IN EGYPT. 51
the Argive Tisamenus, whom the Heraclidae are said to have overthrown, the story of the line of Shimon becomes shadowy. Shemidah is represented by Cometes, called a son of Tisamenus, instead of his grandson through Amnon, but he is said to have passed into Asia, and that is all recorded concerning him. It
seems, however, that. Amnon or his son left Egypt and established himself in Hadar's reahn of Gebalene, or in that portion of it unoccupied by the Amorites and Moabites, and afterwards extended his empire over part of the basin of the Euphrates. Thus he would be the chief competitor with the Egyptian monarch for the empire of the civilized world. His possession of Arabia Patraea, in which during the wanderings of Israel, Kenites and Amalekites, alike subject to him, dwelt, gave him a free passage to the Egyptian border on the east, and it is very probable that he made efforts to regain the sovereignty of the Nile valley in which his ancestors had left enduring memorials. M. Lenormant thouglit the Egyptian monuments afford proof that Assyria and Mesopotamia recognized Egyptian suzerainty down to the second half of the twelfth century B.C. That some quarrelsomeHittite or Amorite king in these regions may have flattered Pharaoh's vanity by presents and a nominal recognition of his greatness in
order to gain assistance against the arms of his fellows is not unlikely, but that the Egyptian arms penetrated these countries, or that there was any real submission of them to the crown of Memphis, is doubtful in the extreme. The Egyptian title was of equal value with that of the kings of Great Britain and Ireland to France, and of those of Austria to Jerusalem.
The name of Achian son of Shemidah was given to the island Egina. Two things attest this : the name of Myrmidons given
to its inhabitants, and the worship of Diana under the title Britomart. The word Myrmidon has already been found to designate the followers of Achilles or Saul of Rehoboth, and to have arisen out of a union of that hero or his father with Miriam of the
family of Ezra, the Semiramis of tradition. In Britomart, also
called Dictynna, a Tsocheth like name, the feminine counterpart of Baal Berith of Shechem appears, and that Shechem is the second son of Shemidah, Achian being the first. In an ancient
invocation, supposed to be in Hebrew, but really in the Iberic

language, the Efrai of Taliesin, that bard mentions Britomart as Brith, who is the Brid or Bridget of Irish mythology, and calls Baal Berith her brother, as if she were the better known of the two. The invocation is translatable by the Basque language.
" O Brithi, Brith oi Brithi, companion of Brith, Nu oes, nu edi Give heed to me, hear me ; Brithi Brith anhai Brithi, brother of Brith,
Sych edi, edi eu roi." Do thou hear, hear this measure.^^
But in the line of Saum and Zaul the Persian historians place, although with no regard to chronologj^ their great hero Rustam, and he is the Chushan Rishathaim of the book of Judges, who became the first enslaver of Israel in the land of Canaan. This Rishathaim or Rustam is the Aristomenes of Messenia, who, according to Pausanias, was made as great a hero in the Messenic
war of the poet Rhianus Benaeus as Achilles is in the Iliad. The name of the poet Rhianus recalls that of Rinnah, a son of Shimon, and Benaeus may be the Beerothite name Baanah ; but the tradition that Aristomenes descended from Pyrrhus the son of Achilles, links him with the Beerothite family. It is remarkable that this family should be celebrated in so many epics, Hadad being the hero of the Indian Mahabharata, Saul of the Greek Iliad, Hadar of the Welsh Gododin, and Rishathaim of the Persian Shah Nameh and the Greek Messeniacs. There must have been great chivalry and warlike powers in a race that so many widely separated poets united to honour in their verse. In the Hindoo genealogies Rishathaim appears as Rishtishena or Arshtishena, a descendant of Jahnu. Unhappily the Greek traditions Eginetan and Messenian, and the Indian, furnish no definite information concerning Shemidah and his sons. The Mahabharata represents their time as one of strife and of humili
ation for the Beerothites. " And the hosts of their enemies also smote the Bharatas. Shaking the earth with an army of four
kinds of forces, the Panchalya chief assailed him (Samvarana, son of Jahnu's brother Riksha), having rapidly conquered the earth, and vanquished him with ten complete hosts. Then King Sam
varana with his wives, ministers, sons and friends, fled from tha^

great cause of alarm ; and dwelt in the thickets of the great river Sindhu, in the country bordering on the stream and near a mountain. There the Bharatas abode for a lorig time, takingrefuge in a fortress. As they were dwelling there for a thousand years, the venerable rishi Vasishtha came to them. Going out to meet him on his arrival, and making obeisance, the Bharatas all presented him with the arghya offering, showing every honour tothe glorious rishi. When he was seated the king himself (Samvarana) solicited him, ' Be thou our priest ; let us strive to regain my kingdom.' Vasishtha consented to attach himself to the Bharatas, and, as we have heard, invested the descendant of Puru with the sovereignty of the entire Kshattriya race to be a horn over the whole earth. He occupied the splendid city formerly inhabited by Bharata, and made all kings again tributary
to himself." ^'" The fragments of early Chaldean history preserved by Berosus mark the advent (jf the 'Beerothite family to the lower waters of the Euphrates and Tigris as one of the most important events in the history of that region, but like the Sanscrit writers he confounds it with the stoiy of the flood of Xisuthrus or Satyavrata, thus giving to it an absurd antiquity. In the time of Ammenon, the Chaldean, says Berosus, appeared the Musarus Cannes, the Annedotus from the Erythraean sea, whose shape was that of a fish blended with that of a man, and afterwards from the same region came another being of similar form named Odacon. This fish man occurs frequently in Assyrian sculptures, as at Khorsabad and Nimroud, sometimes as a complete human figure in a standing position wrapt about with fishy emblems, at others as a composite figure swimming in the sea.*^^ The sequence of the Kenite Amnon, Shemidag, and Ahian as illustrated by the monumental Amnanu, Ismi-dagan and Gungunu, and the legendary Ammenon, Dagon, and Cannes, plainly connects the traditions of the latter with the time when the Beerothite family removed out of Egypt into Babylonia. This being the case, a place is found for the Indian Vishnu, who is proved the same per

son as Jahnu of the Bharatan genealogy .^^ As Manu Satyavrata was offering a libation by the riv^er, a Saphari fish came into his hands, and besought him not to cast it back to the monsters which devoured their kindred in that stream. The sage placed the fish in a water pot, but it was soon too large for that ; then
he transferred it to larger vessels, to a pond, to lakes of various dimensions ; but these were all too small for the growing fish, which at last filled the sea, when Manu recognized it as an incarnation of Vishnu, and paid homage to the god. This is but a form of the story of the dwarf incarnation in which Vishnu as the dwarf Hari easily got from Bali the right to as much ground as he could cover in three strides, whereupon he assumed his true form, and stepping out took possession of the world.'^*^ These legends agree with other fragments of the Beerothite history of the period subsequent to the Exodus of Israel, in showing the
feeble state of that race, its protection in this condition by the dominant powers, Egyptian and Cymro-Hittite, also perhaps by Amorites and Moabites, and its rapid expansion, by virtue of the military skill and prowess that distinguished its leaders, into the
ruling nation of the east. All. the fish stories, which embrace Atargatis or Derceto, Semiramis, Adad, and Oannes or Vishnu, have grown out of the final dag of Shemidag's name, which in some Semitic tongues denotes a fish equally with nun.''^ Some of the Khitan languages have preserved this word, such as the Yeniseian, which call a fish tig, tyk, apparently the same as the Lesghian tshua, Circassian tzey, and Georgian tshekomi, but
others have changed the initial d to r or I, as the Circassian in arge, the Basque in arraga and the Yukahirian in olloga. In British mythology Ahian is Gwion the little. Ceridwen kept him to tend her magic cauldron, and one day when she was out collecting herbs for it, by some accident three drops of the caul
dron's contents fell on her servitor's fingers. The heat of the

The latter is the original Dag, man- fish, or Dagon, and the Chaldean story is that of an early Aryan culture in his line. ^o Muir's Sanscrit Texts, i. 205, seq. ^1 See note 69, however.

water made liiiu put his fingers into his mouth, when immediately the future was revealed to him, and he saw that unless he
escaped from Cei'idwen, his life was in danger. "With extreme terror he fled towards his native country." On Cerid wen's
return she saw that her whole year's labour was lost. " It is Gwion the little who has robbed me," she cried, and flew in pursuit of him. Afraid of being overtaken, Gwion changed himself into a hare, but she became a greyhound and ran him down to the river ; then he became a fish, while she as an otter swam after him. Next he was a bird and she a hawk, and at last in despair he metamorphosed himself into a single grain in a pile of wheat 5 but as a black high-crested hen she scratched him out and devoured him. Yet even thus he triumphed, for he was born to
her as a child so lovely that she had no heart to kill him ; but, unwilling to keep the thief, she laid him in the well worn coracle and sent him ofl" to sea.''^ It is not easy to understand the whole
of this allegory, but the gist of it is that the Beerothites, who,
during their residence in Egypt from the time of Hadad, the first Osortasen, down to that of Shimon the third Amenhotep, had become versed in all the wisdom and science of the Egyptians carried away this knowledge to the banks of the Euphrates con
trary to the desire of the Pharaohs. Taking advantage of Egypt's weakness after the Red Sea overthrow, Shemidah, or it may be his father Amnon, led a Beerothite exodus, which robbed the Nile valley of its bravest defenders and most skilful work
men, and established a rival civilization in the east. That Amnon sat upon a Chaldean throne there is as yet no evidence, but his
son Shemidah called the land after his father, Amnanu, and as Ismi-dagan became the first of a line of oriental kings, from
whom the proud Tiglath Pileser did not disdain to own himself descended. Thus ends the national life of the Hittites in the land of the Pharaohs. It is not astonishing to find all over the world art, appliances,
rites, and traditions that point back to Egypt as their birth place. It was not the cradle of humanity, but it was the school of the nations into which descended, or into contact with which came,

obscure traces of ancient culture, within a brief space of four
centuries, centuries in many respects the most eventful that the
world's progress has witnessed. " Out of Egypt have I called my Son '' is true of Israel and of the Messiah of the chosen people, and it is also true of all earth's nationsJ^ There the Horite Phoe
nician learned his art, and acquired the training of the merchant
;
the Jerahmeelite Brahman found models for his pride, and enriched himself with fancied sacred lore ; the Philistine or Pelas
gian, ancestor of many peoples, gained skill in cyclopean architec
ture and practised the arts of war ; and the Zirarite and Midianite Celt learned to sing the songs of other days. But among all the dwellers in the land of bondage there were none that left such an impress as did the sons of the father of Tekoa, the grandest architects, the most skilful improvers of the country's resources, the
bravest warriors, with the exception of their Philistine guards, the greatest reformers of worship and morals, and the most just and paternal monarchs whom Egypt has ever seen. That the pure religion introduced by the Hebrew captive Joseph had much to do with Hittite excellence in Egypt cannot be denied, but to produce the grand results which mark not only the reign of his
apt pupil Aahpeti, but those also of all the alien Beerothites, from Hadad down to Shimon, there must have been such a capacity for culture of every kind in these Hittite monarchs and their people as the world has rarely beheld. The palmy days of
Egypt were those of the Amenemes and Osortasens, Hittites all
;
those of the Rameses were only saved from total decline by the help of their descendants. And if there appeared in the two en
slavers of Israel strength of will and vigor of intellect, it was their inheritance from the queen of the race which they expatriated, Matred the daughter of Mezahab.

CHAPTER XL
The Hittites at the Tigris and Euphrates.
We have seen Hittite monarchy commencing with Ashchur,
the father of the race, at Cutha or Tiggaba, near Babylon, His
seven sons, who were as many kings, went forth on a career of
conquest, which in its details there are no materials to illustrate. Whether a spirit of adventure led them westward, or they were driven by the hostility of the Shemites or dissensions among
themselves, four of the tribes left the birth place of their race, and in the fourth generation from Ashchur, occupied the eastern bank of the Jordan and the border land of the Sinaitic Peninsula and Greater Arabia. It is probable that the Ethnanites and Temenites came to the latter region across the Arabian Desert, in company with the Jerachmeelites and Joktanites, with whom, as well as with the later Nabateans and Midianites, the Arabian writers associate them. The sons of Achuzam and Achashtari, on the other hand, must have ascended the banks of the Euphrates, and cro.ssing the wide desert that lies between it and Palmyra, have reached Damascus, thence to move southward into the fertile lands of Bashan, Gilead, and Northern Moab. Three tribes remained in part at least in the east, the children of Hepher, Zereth, and Zohar. Simultaneously they seem to have erected three kingdoms of Sippara, Ellasar, and Shinar, along the course
of the Euphrates, between the unhistorical Hamites of the Persian Gulf and the Aramaeans of Northern Mesopotamia. A generation had hardly passed when war took place between Hareph, the son of Hepher, and the sons of Zereth and Zohar. The two grandsons of Helah made an attack upon Naarah's descendant who had married a daughter of Manahath, the first Egyptian king, and trusting in this union of Sippara with Mendes and Zoan, had perhaps treated his cousins with new found haughtiness. At any rate Ellasar and Shinar proved too strong for the
heir of Hepher in spite of his Horite alliance. They drove him



58 THE HITTITES.
out of Sippara which the Zerethites occupied. Hareph, the Harphre of the Egyptians, who made him the sou of Month and Ritho, and the Cerpheres of Manetho's third dynasty, but the Surippak of the Chaldeans, was forced to place the Shat-el-Arab
between him and the sons of his father's brethren. On the east
ern side of the broad river he found the Elaniites, a quiet, unhistorical Semitic people, whom love of peace had probably led
into the land they called Elam, after their ancestor. These Elam
ites furnished the basis of a monarchy. With offers of protec
tion, Hareph bought their confidence and their service, and free from molestation, was able to mature his plans of revenge on his kinsmen. In his new home the exile from Sippara found the horse, and made use of that animal as a valuable aid in war, training his subjects to horsemanship, until Beth Gader or Kanai Kidori, the beautiful household, as he named them, became known
as the Gandharas and air-piercing Centaurs, half man, half horse, who inspired terror in the hearts of those who were unaccustomed to the novel sight of a horse and his rider. Hareph, who may be the Urbabi mentioned on an inscription of Dungi the son of Urukh, was the father of two famous sons, of whom Hamath seems to have been the legitimate heir to the throne, a>< the Arabians called his brother Chedorlaomer a man of Thamud. This Hamath, however, was put to death, and from the fact that one of his sons occupied the throne of Elam, it would appear that Chedorlaomer was a usurper and perhaps the assassin. He was honoured as an Elamite god under the name Sumudu, as was his son Rechab under the title Ragiba, and his brother as Lagomer.^ But Laomer or Lagomer, the Kudur, did not call himself by that name on his monuments evidently. His mother was the daughter of the great Manahath, the Menes of Egypt, and he adopted his maternal grandfather's name, calling himself Kudur Nanhundi. To the Assyrian Assurbanipal, history is indebted for a record of this monarch. He says :
" Kudur Nanhundi the Elamite, who the worship of the great gods did not fear,
who in an evil resolve to his own force trusted,

THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 59
on the temples of Akkad his hands he had laid,
and he oppressed Akkad ....
the days were full .... for 2 Tier 7 soss and 15 years under the Elamites."^
This period was 1635 years, at the end of which Assurbanipal conquered Elam and brought back the image of the goddess Nana which Kudur Nanhundi had taken from Babylonia. The Assyrian monarch was wrong in representing Chedorlaomer as the oppressor of Akkad and the robber of its temples, for as yet Akkad was not. The worshippers of Nana were the Zerethites, Urukh and his son Dungi. It was reserved for Chedorlaomer to inflict upon Zereth and Zohar the vengeance which his father Hareph had in mind to visit upon those who had expelled him from Sippara and Surippak. Crossing the river he fell upon
Arioch, the Erichthonius of the Trojan line, in his cities of Ellasar and Sippara, and made him tributary. Advancing northward he found Amraphel, the grandson of Zohar, in Shinar, and
brought him also into subjection. Where he found the Goim who named Galilee, is harder to decide. They were the true Japhetic Achaeans, who were first named Aegialeans or Galileans, but unhappily they have little or no ancient history of their own. It is
possible that Architeles, son of Achaeus, may be a disguise of
Thargal, but almost all their prehistoric names belong to Hittite history in Canaan and Egypt. Especially is their story mixed up, through similarity of name, with that of the Hushamites, who seem to have occupied Achaia before them, and whom meeting as Ossetes on the Euxine, the Greek geographers regarded as an Achaean remnant from Trojan days. They were a maritime people in Accho and Achzib on the Mediterranean coast, which cities Asher was not able to deprive them of when Israel conquered Canaan. Before reaching Galilee they may have been fluviatile, and the transporters of Chedorlaomer's army up the
Euphrates ; but this is mere conjecture, taking for the present the place of historical evidence which is wanting. The Goim were probably allies of the Elamite monarch rather than his subjects, but when he went forth upon his great foray, the kings of

EUasar and Shinar accompanied him as vassals, yet well content, no doubt, to aid him as the ravager of the West. The details of that expedition have already been before us. All that remains to be added is that the presence of the Goim in Chedorlaomer's army, speaking the same Pelasgic tongue as the Philistines, would hinder his attacking the Abimelech of Gerar or being attacked by his warlike host ; and that the descent of the Elamite king from Manahath would secure the neutrality of Zaavan, his grandson, in whose honour Zoan was built, or of his brother Akan, who was probably his successor. The fate of the confederate kings is undetermined. So far there are no data for deciding whether they fell before the avenging arms of the valiant Hebrew and his Amorite allies, or found their way to the Euphrates, and thence regained their homes. There is no monumental record of Amraphel, but the Ute story of Sokus Waiunats which awaits confirmation in the region of mythology and folk lore, indicates that his cruelties were avenged
on his person. His son Machpelah, or the illustrious Chapelah, may have held Shinar after him, but in his time the Zoharite kingdom must have been absorbed, for Ephroft its heir came, the first of a band of Hittite conquerors, into the country west of Jordan, driving the three Amorites towards the Mediterranean coast, where Eshcol and Aner preserved two of their names. There are, however, many reasons for believing that a considerable Zoharite element entered into the ruling family of Assyria. One of these is the constant union of Zereth with Zohar, as the Egyptian Shairetana and Takkaro, and as the Trojan Dardanians
and Teucrians. It was from Tsochar that the Tigris derived its name, as well as the Zagros mountains, which constituted the eastern boundary of Assyria, and this Tigris or Diklath became the Tiglath which formed an element in the names of at least five Assyrian monarcbs. The history of Arioch presents difllculties. His name does not appear in the Kenite record, which furnishes no intermediate links between Zereth and Jehaleleel. The youngest son of the latter was Asareel, whose name as Asar the mighty, might be rendered Elasar or the powerful Asar, but his time is well determined by the fact that his elder sister Ziphah was the consort of the son of Ammon. It is thus impos



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 61
sible that any descendant of his could have been the ally of
Chedorlaomer. Now the Urukh of whom we possess inscriptions built a temple to Sarili, who is Asareel, and calls himself king of Sumir and Akkad, neither of which was in existence in the time
of Chedorlaomer. It follows that there must have been an older Urukh, the grandson of Zereth, whose father may have been an Asareel or Elasar, the same whom the Greeks calling Erichthonius, make the brother of Ilus. But he cannot even have been the brother of Jehaleleel, who was the contemporary of Ammon, and must be placed in the previous generation as the brother of
Shachar. Nevertheless the Zerethite family which Arioch represented kept the throne of Chaldea and became more powerful than the Elamite kings. After the death of Chedorlaomer, his
son Salma, the father of Beth Lechem, was set aside, and the rightful heir of Hamath was recognized as his successor. This was Ezra or Gezra, the head of the Gezrites and the Tamudite Hezer of the Arabians. His name has been read on a monument
as Simti Silhak, in which the first word appears to denote his father Hamath as Sumudu, and the second, his own name in a very corrupt form. The connection is found in the name of his son, who restores the family designation Beth Gader as Kudur Mabuk. Here, however, although the line of Kudur is given, the
personal name is concealed, for Mabuk is a feminine title connected with the goddess Atargatis, who was worshipped at Mabog, Bambyce, or Hierapolis in Syria. Two princesses are mentioned in the Kenite list as wives of one of the sons of Ezra, but whether of Jether or of Mered is hard to determine ; these are Hodiah, a daughter of Caleb the Zoharite, grandson of Ephron, and Bithiah, daughter of the Zerethite Ziph. The mother of Jered, the father of Gedor, who was the heir of Jether, is called Jehudijah, and she should be the Mabuk of the inscription. In Professor Palmer's report of exploration in Moab, he mentions a visit to El Yehudiyeh, near Fugua, which may be the Pau of Hadar. He describes it as a black rock, about twelve feet long, " of which the Arabs have a legend that it is a woman turned into stone for profanely denying the certainty of death." The Arabic name and that of the mother of Jered are identical.^ In Greek gene

62 THE HITTITES.
alogies Erythrius, who is Jered and the Rathures of Manetho's fifth dynasty, is called a son of Athamas, the Kenite Etham or Etam, and the Egyptian Atmu or Athom. The British Arthur, who is the same personage, is called a son of Uther Pendragon. Uther denotes his father Jether, but the surname Pendragon calls for explanation. In Irish history Jether, as Eathoir, is associated with Feniusa Farsa as joint administrator of the primitive University of Magh Seanair, a statement by no means so absurd as it may seem, for the Kenite scribes were the educators of the ancient world and gave instruction in letters to the students gathered in Zoan, Memphis, and Thebes. Eathoir is made the father of a Gadel, but this Gadel, who fades out of history, is wrongly distinguished from Gadelas the grandson of Feniusa, Gadel or Gadelas, whom the Scottish Chronicle calls Gathelus,
son of Cecrops, is in the Kenite genealogy the third son of Jether, namely, Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah, and ancestor of the
Gaoidheals or Gaels, who, however, were not true Celts or Galatae» but Ugrians of the Ugrians. The triple connection of Jether with Athamas, Pendragon, and Feniusa, finds explanation in the Kenite account of the family of the father of Etam, in which appears Penuel the father of Gedor."* Now Gedor was a purely Hepherite family, and Etam as a Horite in the line of Manahath, had no right to the title of father to that family, save through
the marriage of his daughter to a Kenite. Such a Kenite was Jether, and his son being Jered, also the father of Gedor, it follows that Penuel was the father of the wife of the former and
the mother of the latter. The Welsh traditions of Arthur's mother, althoug confused, furnish valuable identifications ; for, while they call her Eigyr or Igerna, which is the name of Ezra the father of Jether, they represent her as the wife of Gorlois of Cornwall, who is Jezreel the son of Etam. As Penuel was a Horite, and will not re-appear in the history, it may be well to
indicate what the Greek traditions say of his genealogy. The Scholiast in Apollonius Rhodius calls him Phoenix the son of Agenor and Cassiepea, but reduplicates him as Phineus, who was
the son of Phcenix, along with Cilix, Doriclus and Atyranius.
* 1 Chron, iv. 4.



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 68
His children by Cleopatra were Parthenius and Crambis, and by Idaea, the daughter of Dardanus, Thymus and MariandynusNow it is clear that the Scholiast or his informant had in his possession an oral or written version of the very genealogy that is contained in the book of Chronicles, for he mixes up the families of Etam and Ezra through the alliance of the daughter of the Etamite Penuel with the Ezraite Jether, Agenor is the Horite Akan, father of Etam, as Agenor is the father of Cadmus ;
Atymnius and Doriclus are Etam and Jezreel or Yetsregel ; Idaea is Jehudijah ; and Thymus and Mariandynus are Eshtemoa and Miriam. In Norse mythology the wife of Jether or Odur is Freyja of the Vanir, who is also called Vanadis. " Odur left his
wife in order to travel into very remote countries. Since that time Freyja continually weeps, and her tears are drops of pure gold." ^ She is thus Bhavani, parent of the Rudras and Maruts as of Vena descended from Agni and Manu. The story of her father is always a melancholy one. As Pentheus, the grandson of Cadmus, he climbed into a tree top to witness unseen the Dionysiac orgies, but the Bacchantes espied him and tore him to pieces. As Phineus, son of Agenor, he was struck with blindness by the gods, and then tormented by the Harpies, As Phineus, brother of Cepheus of Joppa, he was petrified by the Gorgon's head in the hands of Perseus. In Hindu story he is the magician Punchkin who imprisoned many princes and princesses in a great
tower, till the son of one of these princesses, named Balna, travelling over the world, found the green parrot on whose life that of Punchkin depended, and, tearing it limb from limb before him, caused the magician to perish in the same way. Unhappily,
Apuleius in his Golden Ass, begins the story of Psyche, who should be the daughter of Penuel, in the trite form, " erant in
quadam civitate rex et regina, there were in a certain city a king and a queen," instead of informing us who the king* and queen were.^ She was married to a monster who turned out to be Cupid, but through curiosity she lost him. To the Scadinavian Vanadis answers the Undine of Fouque, the water maiden who

married a mortal on condition that he should never speak angrily to her in the neighbourhood of her relations, for thus they would regain power over her. And she is Bheki, the frog princess of Sanscrit story, who cautioned her husband never to show her a drop of water ; and Vach the wife of Indra. But her father Penuel is Pani the deceiver, who stole away Indra's cows. Tlie origin of all these various legends, representing the union of
members of two different races and their subsequent separation, is the marriage of Jether to the Horite Jehudijah, daughter of Penuel, who seems at some time to have left him for her father's house, whence Jether did not succeed in bringing her, until he had inflicted mortal injury on his father-in-law. To explain the connection of the two words Jehudijah and Bog or Mabog, it is nece.ssary to premise that the former is Semitic, which is more than probable, as the Egyptian was a sub-Seinitic language, and
the Ilorites were appai-ently its authors. In Phoenicia also the same Horites spoke a purely Semitic tongue. In this case Jehudijah can be traced to the root jadah, meaning to cast forth; to utter, to praise. A similar root is the Japanese (modern Ham
athite) hokashi, to cast forth or away ; but as most Japanese
words commencing with the aspirate have replaced an original labial by that letter, hokashi is the same as the obscure hokushi,
meaning to tell fortunes, soothsay, prognosticate. The ancient Hittite word translating Jehudijah must thus have been the equivalent of the Sanscrit Vach, the voice, so that the primitive meaning of buk or hog was the utterance or oracle, and with the
prefix ma, meaning illustrious, honourable, great, it became, as Mabuk and Mabog, and the Mexican Mapach, the sublime oracle. It is natural to think that the bee of the Syrian Baalbec and Egyptian Atarbechis was the same term, and that these woi-ds signified the oracle of Baal, the oracle of Athor, or more literally the utterance of the respective deities. It is remarkable that Penuel, whose own name has the blasphemous meaning of, the face of God, a name which being transported to Phoenicia by his descendants, the Greeks translated as Theouprosopon, should
have had a daughter called, the oracle ; and it may indicate that Penuel arrogated to himself the divinity of which his daughter was to be the voice.



THE HITTITKS AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 65
The story of Jether as Mabuk is told in the Manyoshiu, a collection of Japanese poems said to have been composed between the fifth and ninth centuries A.D. The hero of the story is Urashima, whose name furnishes a synonym for bokushi in the root ura, denoting oracular utterance, as in ura-nai, to foretell,
divine, prognosticate, and in ura-kata,- the prognostication or fortune told. The following shima is probably an old form of
the verb shimeshi, to declare, publish. In Japanese history,
Urashinia, the fisherman, caught a large turtle in his nets which turned to a beautiful woman, and they went away together to the
island of Furaisan.'^ A turtle in Japanese is kame, and a god, kami. The opening of the casket in the Manyoshiu story links it with that of Psyche, to whom Venus gave a box to take to Proserpina, which box Psyche opened, when vapours issued from
it that landed her in sleep and forgetfulness. This is the Japan
ese version of the oft told tale :
" When the days of spring were hazy, I went forth upon the beach of Suminoe, And as I watched the fishing-boats rock to and fro, I bethought me of the tale of old : How the son of Urashima of Midzunoe, Proud of his skill in catching the katsuwo and tai, For seven days not even coming home, Rowed on beyond the bounds of the ocean, Where with a daughter of the god of the sea He chanced to meet as he rowed onwards. When with mutual endearments their love had been crowned, They plighted their troths and went to the immortal land, Where hand in hand both entered Into a stately mansion within the precinct .Of the palace of the god of the sea. There to remain for everlasting. Never growing old, nor ever dying. But this was the speech which was addressed to his spouse By the foolish man of this world : ' For a little while I would return home. And speak to my father and my mother : To-morrow I will come back.
'
When he had said so, this was the speech of his spouse : ' If thou art to return again to the immortal land , And live with me as now, Open not this casket at all.'

Much did she impress this on him. But he, having returned to Suminoe, Though he looked for his house, No house could he see ; Though he looked for his native village. No village could he see. ' This is strange,' said he : thereupon this was his thought
:
' In the space of three years since I came forth from my home, Can the house have vanished, without even the fence being left ? If I opened this casket and saw, Should my house exist as before ? ' Opening a little the jew el casket, A white cloud came forth from it And spread away towards the immortal land

He ran, he shouted, he waved his sleeves, He rolled upon the earth and ground his feet together. Meanwhile of a sudden his vigor decayed and departed : His body that had been young grew wrinkled ; His hair too that had been black grew white ; Also his breath became feebler night by night
;
Afterwards at last his life departed, And of the son of Urashima of Midzunoe The last resting place I can see." *
This quaint legend fui-nishes in the latter part the original of
Washington Irving's Rip van Winkle, and of the story of the pious monk, Petrus Forschegrund, who, going into the sombre north
em woods to meditate on God's blessed eternity, saw the scenery transformed with golden sunlight and summer zephyrs, with rippling streams and flower bedecked meadows, with palms and myrtles and birds of paradise ; but, returning tg his monas
tery, strange sights and voices greeted him, and, as he fell beneath
the weight of old age, he learned that his short hour of bliss had been a hundred years of time. The water maiden or sea goddess in British story is Guinevere or Guanhumara, the faithless wife of King Arthur, for she is Gwenhwyvar, the lady of the summit of the water. In one tradition she prefers Lancelot, the son of Ban of Banwick, to her spouse ; in another, Modred, her husband's nephew. In the first case Ban is the Indian Pani and Kenite Penuel ; in the second Modred represents Mered the brother of Jether and uncle of Jered or Arthur. But while Mered took away what was not his own, for such is often the meaning of lakach, which the English version simply renders by " took," it

was not Jehudijah or Mabog, but Bithiah of whom he deprived another. Mr. Osborn finds Pehnak as an Egyptian royal scribe contemporary with prince Mourhet or Mered, whose portrait from the monuments adorns his work ; and Lieblein mentions a Pehenuka, father of an otherwise unknown Ata.* These are Egyptian Penuels. It is evident that the Egyptian alliance, originally formed by the marriage of Hareph to the daughter of Manahath, was followed by the entrance of some of his descendants into Egypt. There they found the native Pharaohs already in a subordinate position, for the Zerethite Ziph had established himself in Memphis, and was constructing the great pyramid in the neighbouring
necropolis of Gizeh. Mered made a friend of this intruder and took his daughter Bithiah to wife, while Jether allied himself with the Horite Penuel by marrying his daughter Jehudijah. But Jether had no intention of fattening on the flesh-pots of Egypt. He carried his bride away from her home on the Mediterranean shore of the delta, to his distant kingdom of Elam in the east, attended by his wild Centaurs or men of Gedor, and there in her honour he called himself no longer Jether, but Kudur
Mabuk, Gedor of the excellent Oracle. He has left a brief inscription that has already been given. The memorial of Ardu
Sin is all too brief for the Erythras who named the Red Sea, the terrible Rudra of the Hindus, and the kingly Arthur of the Round Table. His presence in Egyptian dynastic lists as Rathures seems to indicate that his horsemen were not unknown in the land of the Pharaohs, but to the polished dwellers of the Nile they were the cowboys of ancient days, and their princely leader was the two-headed dog Orthos, sprung from Typhon and Echidna that guarded the flocks of Geryon, in the Iberian island of Erythea. Nay, worse than this, Jered figured in their story as the Centaur Eurytion, a rough boor, who, invited to the marriage festivities of Pirithous and Hippodamia, drank to intoxication, and grievously insulted the bride, so that the Lapithae hurried him away from the feast, cut off" his nose and ears, and sent him packing to his lawless domain, there to cherish deep hatred in his heart against these quondam hosts.

scrit scriptures redeem the King of Elam and his people from reproach, for the Rudras with their relatives, the Maruts of Mered, and Indra or Jether, the great progenitor of the former,
are the principal deities of the oldest Veda. They are not idola
trous* objects, thinks the eminent translator of the Rig Veda, but personifications of the eternal powers of nature through which the pious Brahman worshipped God. What the Brahman thought them to be when he picked up their story from Indian Gandharas and Mahrattas we cannot tell ; but, as he worshipped his ancestor Brahma, so did these tribes worship theirs, and such originally was all heathen cultus, the worehip and service of the creature
rather than the Creator who is blessed forever.
•' Father of the Maruts, may thy felicity extend to us : exclude us not from the light of the sun. Thou Rudra are the chiefest of beings in glorj'. Thou wielder of the thunderbolt, art the mightiest of the mighty. Where, Rudra, is thy joy dispensing hand ? Firm, with strong limbs, assuming manj' forms, he shines with golden ornaments."
Of Mered's descendants, the ancient poet sings as of a charge of the fierce Mahratta cavalry :
*' They make the rocks to tremble ; they tear asunder the kings of the forest, like Hermes in his rage. Lances gleam, Maruts, upon your shoulders, anklets on your feet, golden cuirasses on your breasts, and pure waters shine on your chariots : lightnings blazing with fire glow in your hands, and golden tiaras are towering on your heads." i"
Another hymn unites those who once dwelt in Syrian Aradus and Marathus with their brethren of Hamath :
" When ye thus from afar cast forth your measure, like a blast of fire, through whose wisdom is it, through whose design ? To whom do you go, to whom, ye shakers of the earth ? May your weapons be firm to attack, strong also to withstand ! May yours be the more glorious strength, not that of the deceitful mortal ! When you overthrow what is firm, O ye men, and whirl about what is heavy, ye pass through the trees of the earth, through the clefts of the rocks. No real foe of yours is known in heaven, nor in earth, ye devourers of enemies ! May
strength be yours, together with your race, O Rudras, to defy even now. They make the rocks to tremble, they tear asunder the kings of the forest. Come on, Maruts, like madmen, ye gods, with your whole tribe. Ye have harnessed the spotted deer to your chariots, a red deer draws as leader. Even the earth listened at your approach, and men were frightened. O Rudras, we quickly desire your help for our race. Come now to us with help, as of yore, thus for the sake of the frightened Kanva." '^

Kudur Mabuk and his son Ardu Sin were lords of Martu, the western land supposed to mean Syria, and of Yamut-bal or Elam, bearing the name of Hamath, the father of Ezra and Recliab.^^ With Jether and Mered their second cousin, Beeri, the head of the Beerothite line and father-in-law of Esau, was contemporary, and in Jered's time lived the unfortunate Bedad. This Bedad was contemporary with Jobab and Husham, the Temenite kings of Edom, who supplanted the Ethnanite Bela, son of Beor, the first to exercise sovereignty in Gebalene, so that the southern parts of Palestine cannot have constituted the Martu over which the Elamites ruled. Yet the Niebelungen Lied, ©r song of the men of Nipur, of whom Gunther was the chief, has been found to represent the descendants of Ezra in opposition to those of
Rechab and in a position of superiority to the Temenite Husham, who probably acknowledged the sway first wielded by Chedorlaomer over the trans-Jordanic ti-ibes. But a mightier power M'as rising in the east. At Ellasar and Sippara on the lower Euphrates, Arioch the Zerethite had been a vassal of the Elamite. Of his descendant Jehaleleel or Helel, son of Shachar, we know
little. In a list of Babylonian kings, his predecessor is calleci Sumuabi, a name that suggests nothing. He is himself called Sumulailu, which leads one to doubt that Sumu is the correct
reading in either case. He is said to have reigned for thirty -five
years, and the Basque story of Lelo, the Graeco-Egyptian Linus, and the fragment of ancient poetry on the fall of Helel, son of

Shachar, preserved by the prophet Isaiah, alike indicate his unhappy end. He is probably the Alorus whom Berosus makes the first Babylonian king, for by the common chancre of I to r, his name descended not only as Alalia, but also as Aleria, and his descendants were known as Alarodians, Illyrians, Ilergetes,
Ilercaones, and Silures. Yet he has no history either as ^olus the pious, dear to the immortal gods, or as Hellen the mythic ancestor of the Greeks, or eVen as Helius the drowned in the Eridanus. The nearest approach to history is the story of Halirrothius, which by no means vindicates the character of the son of the morning. He is called the son of Poseidon, and is said to have wronged Alcippe, the daughter of Ares, whereupon the offended father killed him, and the high court of Areopagus was
instituted to try the manslayer. But Poseidon was no relative of Jehaleleel's, and Ma Reshah, the true Ares or Mars, was not upon the scene, so that this corrupted narrative sheds no light upon the mysterious fate of the victim of Zara and Tota.^'^ But two of his sons restored the glory of the Zerethite line, Ziph the
eldest, and Asareel the youngest. In the Babylonian list the former appears as the successor of Sumulailu under the name Zabu, with a reign of fourteen years. As the Egyptian Suphis,
he is said by Manetho to have exercised sovereignty sixty-three years in Memphis. His reign marks the beginning of that wide extension of Zerethite empire that has been witnessed in part in the story of the kings who reigned in Edom. The marriage of his sister Ziphah to Coz, the daughter of Ammon, gave Ziph the introduction to, Egypt, of which he took foul advantage. His alliance there with the Hepherite Mered did not serve his descendants long, for the Amenemes and Osortasens drove Sisyphus out, and vainly did he launch his Cherethite hosts against these bulwarks of the Nile valley, generation after generation ; oft on
the brink of conquest, the stone that was to carry all opposition
before it slipped from his grasp, and the Ziphite had to begin his work anew.
^3 Nor does British history, to which the Silures contributed, place us on solid ground, as far as the Silurian ancestor is concerned. He is the Leir whom Shakspeare has immortalized, the father of three daughters, of whom Cordelia, the best of them, alone reflects the original story as in her name disguising Asareel, while her husband Aganippus, in his, presents that of Anub or Ganub, the son of Jehaleleel's daughter, Ziphah. Karitia also, the seat of Aganippus, is Jahaleleel's own region of Zereth.



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 71
According to an inscription of Nabonidus, Zabu occupied Sippara, the ancient seat of the Nipurites of Elam, and built there the temples of Samas and Anunit, which the Babylonian king restored,^* He was succeeded by a descendant Heber, who
in the Babylonian list is called Apil-sin, and in a Chaldean astrological treatise, Ibil-Sin, King of Ur. After Heber came Japhlet his son, called in the list Sin-Muballit ; and, in the Synchronous History of Assyria and Babylonia, where he is made an Assyrian monarch, he is Assur-Yupalladh. The Kenite genealogy places Asher and Beriah before Heber, and, in the Synchronous History, Assur Yupalladh is preceded by Assur-bil-nisisu and BuzurAssur.^^ The Assyrian and Babylonian lists present the same faults as the Egyptian, repeating royal names, making contemporaneous dynasties successive, and exhausting one dynasty before introducing another, without reference to the point of time at which a member of the latter superseded a king of the former. The Greeks unfortunately kept the Zerethite geneal
ogies more carelessly than any others, so that their legends throw
little light upon the path of history. The chief guides in seeking to reconstruct the family line of Ziph or Zabu from Grecian sources, are the names Opheltes and Peneleus, by which they represent the Kenite Japhlet and his second son Bimhal. Pausanias has a Peneleus, son of Opheltes, who succeeded the Theban Thersander, and whose grandson was Damasichthon, the father of Ptolemy and grandfather of Xantbus. Another Opheltes was the son of Lycurgus of Nemea, whose father was Pheres, the son of Cretheus, son of -^olus. Here, undoubtedly, amid much confusion, Beriah, the father of the Kenite Heber, is recognized in
Pheres as a Zerethite in the line of Jehaleleel. Apollodorus has a Peneleus, son of Hippalmus, among the Argonauts, and he, in Diodorus, is Peneleus of Hippalcimus, of Iton, of Boeotus, of Arne, of -(Eolus. Now Iton, Boeotus and Arne have nothing to do with the genealogy, but Peneleus and Hippalcimus rightly go back to -^olus or Jehaleleel. Opheltius and Ophelestes are Trojan names in Homer, and Opheltas belonged to a Thessalian king. Ephialtes and Hippolytus were giants that fought against Jupiter, and

72 THE HITTITES.
another Ephialtes was one of the Aloidae. Hippolochus, a discruised Yupalladh, was a son of Bellerophon, descended from Sisyphus, but Halmus the son of that arch-deceiver represents Helem, Japhlet's younger brother. The connection rests on the authority of the Babylonian list, which places Apil-Sin and Sin Muballit after Zabu, and on that of the Synchronous History, which makes Mupallidhat Serua the daughter of Assur Yupalladh, taken together with the facts that the Kenite list in which Japhlet or Yaphlet appears is headed by an Asher, and that Serah as the name of a woman occurs in the beginning of it. Then comes in the testimony of Greek tradition, connecting the names Opheltes and Peneleus, and referring them to the .^olian line of Jehaleleel. Both the Synchronous History and the Kenite list require the introduction of two monarchs between Zabu and Apil-Sin, or Ziph and Heber, but while the former calls these Assur-bil-nisisu and Buzui^-Assur, the latter terms them Asher and Beriah. A§ the latter Egyptian Aahpeti was succeeded by his great-grandson Methosuphis, so Ziph, to whom Manetho ascribes a long reign, may have outlived his son Asher and grand
son Beriah, who acted as his deputies or viceroys in the east. Assur-bil-nisisu is recognized as the first Assyrian king ; he must therefore have been driven out of Sippara, in which his father
Zabu reigned, into the north-east, there to refound the empire
first established by Asshur, son of Shem, In it the two rivers Zab received the ancestral name of Ziph; and many other memorials of ancient Zerethite empire were transported to this new home of the race. There the Egyptian monarchs found the Assuru, and near them their kindred of the Rutennu, descended
from Asareel. One successor of Yupalladh is recorded in the Assyrian annals as reported by Mr. George Smith, namely, Bil
Pasku, who is called " the origin of royalty," and he is Pasach,
the eldest son of Japhlet, a competitor with the Nairi Paaeach, after whom Thapsacus was named. His brother Bimhal would seem to have followed him, but as Assyrian names are at present read, it is hardly worth while to tax 'the reader's patience with comparisons of his name with that which is variously called
Binlikhish, Bilnirari, Bellush, Bel Tanagbal,and Ivalush. These
strange variations arise from the uncertainty whether a character



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 73
should be read as a phonograph or as an ideograph. Between Yupalladh and Bellush, Professor Rawlinson inserts Bel-SumiliKapi, who may be Shomer, the brother of Japhlet, or his son Jechubbah. All of the family of Asher do not seem to have gone northward, for his grandson Malchiel is called the father of Birzavith, which is the Chaldean Borsippa. The Synchronous History makes Assur-bil-nisisu contemporary with Cara-Indas of Babylonia, or Gan-Duniyas, and Buzur-Assur with Burna-Buryas of the same. Now Burna-Buryas in the lists follows Ulam
Buryas, or Ulam son of Peresh, the Gileadite or Zimrite, with two reigns between them. Burna-Buryas is Akkadian, and is read in Assyrian Kidin-bel-matati, the Bel-matati representing the Akkadian Buryas, but another king whose Assyrian name is Kidin-Bel is in Akkadian Bat-mu-ul-lil-la.^^ There is reason therefore to think that Burna should be Bedan, and that Bedan being the son of Ulam, Bedan-Buryas should follow Ulam-Buryas. This would place Buzur-Assur somewhat late in history, or in the time of Saul of Rehoboth. Assur-Yupalladh again had a daughter Mupallidhat Serua, whose son, a Babylonian king called
Cara-Murdas, was killed by his people, the Cassi, whereupon the Assyrians set a son of Burna-Buryas on the vacant throne. The missing names of the Assyrian avenger and the son of BurnaBuryas have been conjecturally restored, but it is better to ab
stain from conjecture until fuller evidence is forthcoming. The facts indicate that Burna-Buryas belonged to a younger generation than Assur-Yupalladh, and therefore suggest that BuzurAssur represents his son Pasach rather than one of his predecessors. Mupallidhat Serua must be a Greek Hippolyte. One of these was the Amazon, wife of Theseus, and mother of Hippolytus whom Phaedra slandered ; and the other was the wife of Acastus, who slandered Peleus, the father of Achilles, in a similar way. Both of these traditions connect the Beerothite family with a Hippolyte, for Theseus is Hadad, and Achilles the son of Peleus is Saul of Rehoboth. Butes of Boreas again, who is Bedad the
son of Beeri, carried off Pancratis, the daughter of Aloeus, and
sister of Ephialtes, thus strengthening the evidence for a union of the Zerethite Asherites and the royal line of Beeroth.

74 THE HITTITES.
Continuing the search for the prominent name Japhlet, or Yupalladh, it is found in Canaan as Japhleti, not, however, in the tribe of Asher, but in that of Benjamin, where Cherith and many other names denoted Zerethite occupation at the time when Zereth Shachar was at the height of its prosperity." In the Moabite region, where these Zerethites exercised for a time almost undivided sway, the name became Diblath, and down in the Sinaitic peninsula it was reduced to Tophel.^® In an inscription
of Sennacherib a river of Assyria is called the Tibilti, in honour of the ancient king who had reigned over its Gordyeans, or Carduchi.^^ But in the centre of the Caucasus dwelt in old Assyrian days and dwell now, the Iberians, of Kartu-el, who bear the name of Japhlet's father Heber, but whom the Assyrian monarchs did not call Iberians, although such is the name they still arrogate to themselves. The Assyrians termed these Iberians Tabalu or Tubalai, and the prophet Ezekiel associates them with Rosh and Meshech as the people of Tubal .^ At the present time the
Iberian capital is Tibelisi, or Tiflis. The American Zerethites, western Dardanians, whose lack of the liquid r compelled them to call themselves Toltecs, preserved the name of Japhlet as a title
of honour, Topiltzin, the prince, which was borne by the first
Toltec king as distinguished from mere chiefs of tribes, Nau
hyotl."^^ Following the analogy of Nahuatl in transliteration, this king's name would be 'Navyar, so that it furnishes a nunnated Heber, the name of the father of that Japhlet who was really the first to assume the royal title. In Aztec the word
piltic means a man of gentle birth, a nobleman. It is possible that the very different looking Japanese word samurai, which has the same mean'ng, is of the same origin. The Japhleti of the
Georgians, designating a division of their country, is now Imeretia,
the labial j^h being changed to ni, and the I being replaced by its corresponding liquid r. Imeretia is to Japhleti as samurai is to Tubalai. In Italy Tiphlat, or Diblath, was known as Tiburtus, the namer of the Tiber, whose descent from Amphiaraus was

THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 75
assumed by the Romans from a misunderstood tradition of the Etruscans, whose Heber was unknown to them ; and he is the same as Tiberinus, the king of Alba Longa, in whose family the names Capys, Capetus, Procas, Amulius, and Aventinus represent the Zerethite Ziph, Zophah, Berigah, Amal, and Jephunneh. The union of this line with Alba began in the Caucasus, where Iberians and Albanians dwelt side by side ; it continued on the eastern
coast of the Adriatic, where lllyria lay to the north of Albania
;
and extended even to Britain, where Zerethite Picts counted Alban among their ancestors, and shared tRe land with the
Damnii Albani. It is not easy to indicate the process by which Pasach, the
Pasku of the Assyrians, became in later times Pukud, Pact, and Pict. It may have been brought about by an unconscious harmonizing of tribal terminology with the famous names Zereth, Japhlet, Ashvath, Birzavith, and this is more natural than to
attribute i*^. to the tendency of children and uneducated people to add a final t to such words as cliff and skiff. For almost everywhere outside of Greece and the Grecian Islands the posterity of
Pasach, son of Japhlet, were called Picts, while those of Paseach, son of Eshton, retained the Basque name. In the case of the
latter there were no related names ending in t or th, calling for
harmonious modification of those which originally terminated
with other sounds. In Zerethite nomenclature Jehaleleel presents analogy, for the descendants of the monarch so named were called Alarud, or Alarodians, and Ilerda and Lerida were named after him, as well as Iluro. Even the Arabian deity Alilat displays the same tendency. Herodotus mentions two nations of Pactyans, one of which was conterminous with the Armenian Alarodians, and whose habitat is marked by Vasseda on the borders of Iberia and Colchis ; the other was in the Punjaub.^^ The former Pactyans may thus be identified with the Iberians, or Tubalai. But
those of India must have gained their seat in the Punjaub from some other part of the Assyrian empire. The prophet Jeremiah associates the Pekod with Merathaim and Babylon. ^^ Tiglath Pileser II. also places them in Babylonia as the Puqudu who dwelt
22 Herodot. iii. 93, 102. 23 Jereni. 1. 21.



76 THE HITTITES.
in Lahiru, Idibirina, Hiliminu, and Pillutu, bordering on Elam.^* Sargon calls them the nasikat of Pukud and makes them allies of the Marsanians.^^ Sennacherib mentions the Bukudu and sets them between the Lakhiru and the Gambuli, the last of whom lived in the marshes near the Persian Gulf.** It is fortunate that
Tiglath Pileser has preserved the names of their cities, for Pillutu and Hilimmu identify Pukud with Pasach through his father Japhlet and uncle Helem, while Lahiru not only presents the Illyrian form of Jehaleleel, but enables us to point out the Indian home of the Pactyans as Lahore in the Punjaub. Not far to the east of the classical Lahora flowed the river Zaradrus, a memorial of the ancestral Zereth. At some future time it may be possible
to tell the period when the Zerethites divided into a northern, a
central, and a southern family, and to account for the dispersion
and enmity to Assyria of tribes so intimately associated with the foundation of that monarchy. At present all that is certainly known is that such a separation took place; that it was subse(juent to the reign of Heber, or Apil Sin, who calls himself king of Ur, and probably to those of Japhlet and Pasach, since their names were claimed alike by the Zerethites of the Caucasus and of Babylonia ; and that while the central division was the strength of the Assyrian kingdom proper, being represented by the Kurds of to-day, the northern and southern off-shoots were hostile to that monarchy.
It would be interesting to know the precise relation of Japhlet and his family to the Beerothite line. Already the daughter of Japhlet, or Yupalladh, has appeared in relation to that line as Hippolyte, wife of Acastus, who slandered Peleus, the father of that Achilles who is well identified with Saul of Rehoboth. Again she is Hippolyte the Amazon, wife of Theseus and mother of Hippolytus, the charioteer, who was slandered in the same
way by Phaedra; and Theseus and Hippolytus are Greek representatives of Hadad and Rehoboth. Once more the connection appears in Butes, son of Boreas, who is Hadad's
father Bedad, the son of Beeri, that carried off Pancratis,
2* Records of the Past, v. J 02. 25 Records of the Past, vii. 43. 2« Records of the Past, i. 26, 47.



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 77
the sister of Ephialtes. The confirmation of these traditions is found in the Mexican story of Quetzalcoatl, who is also Saul of Rehoboth. As a Toltec monarch, although an intruder and not of the royal Toltec line, he nevertheless bore the Toltec title
Topiltzin, first borne by Japhlet, and is called Topiltzin Acxitl Quetzalcoatl.^^ The medial Acxitl is probably an Aztec version of Assur, as Japhlet called himself Assur Yupalladh. Reckoning by generations from the time of Ziph, and allowing the three names, Asher, Berigah, and Heber, to intervene between him and Japhlet, Rehob or Rehoboth will be his contemporary, for Jether, the nephew of Rechab, married Ziph's daughter Bithiah, and between Rechab and Rehob are Beeri, Bedad and Hadad. This reckoning, however, is most precarious, for generations are of very unequal lengths. Nevertheless, there is nothing improbable in the union of Rehob with a daughter of Japhlet, which would entitle their descendant Saul to bear the name Tiphlat, or
Topiltzin. In the inscriptions of, or in honour of, Zur-Sin, who
has been taken to represent Saul, there is one, the last word of which has not been translated :

" Ningal, mother of Ur, delight of the heart
of the great god of Dur, he built tubelini."^^ The Ur in which Zur-Sin was honoured is the city of which Apil Sin, the father of Yupalladh, was king. If Zur-sin, or Saul,
built Tubelini, it must have been to commemoi'ate his ancestress, the daughter of Japhlet, from whom the Tubalai received their name. It may thus be Tophel in Arabia Petraea, or Diblath in the land of Moab. Tubelini is the same word as Dublin, the ancient name of which was Eblana ; and Merlin, in his famous prophecy, mentions a British Kaer Dubalem, out of which a fox was to issue to destroy the lion of Gloucester, or Glevum.^^ The following from the Synchronous History of Assyria and Baby
lonia is to be reconciled with the traditional connection of Japhlet and Rehob :

" In the time of Assur Yupalladh, king of Assyria, Cara-Murdas,

Zimrite or Sumir family, which was allied with the Zerethites and with the Temenites of Karrak. Yet no such names appear among the Zimrites, Temenites, or Ethnanites, as Cara Indas and Cara-Murdus, or Hardas. As for the Cassi, Kassu, or Coss-aeans, they may have been Hushamites, seeing that Husham may be read Chusham, or Ammonites of the family of Coz. Now the only early monarch that ruled over either or both of these, and whose name at all answers to Cara-Indas, is Hadad, who might be called Indas by the application of the phonetic law that made his father Bedad a Pandu, or Pandion. This being the case, the preceding Cara answers to Ezer, so that Cara-Indas is an inversion of Hadad-ezer, who otherwise does not appear in the ancient records of Babylonia. After his death Samlah reigned in Edom
and Jabez in Egypt. Professor Sayce is right in calling his suc
cessor Cara-Murdas. One of the chief places of the Dimetae, who inhabited Dyved or Demetia in South Wales, was Maridunum, or Caer Marthen. The name is old, for it occurs in the Eugubine inscriptions as Kara Maratuno, denoting what is now
Martinengo, south-east of Bergamo, in northern Italy.^^ In Grecian story Murdas is called Myrtilus, and it is related that he
betrayed CEnomaus, whose charioteer he was, for the love of his daughter Hippodamia, but Pelops took her from him and threw him into the sea, just as Lycomedes of Scyros threw Theseus.

THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 79
Plutarch, however, has a Marathon who accompanied the Tyndaridae in the quest of Helen. The name Myrtilus is derived from mijrtos, the myrtle ; accordingly, the tomb of Hippolytus was placed under a myrtle, and to account for the transparent
dots characteristic of the leaves of the myrtle family, it is reported that Phaedra, in her agitation on beholding Hippolytus, pierced
them with her bodkin.^- Again he is Immaradus, called a son of Euraolpus, together with Ismarus. Eumolpus and Ismarus have already been identified with Beth Kapha and his descendant Samlah. Immaradus, who fell in battle with the Athenians, is,
therefore, the unhappy Murdas, who leaves Saul in the care of Samlah. The Persian historians represent Zaul as tributary king over Nimruz, or Nimrod. Between the Colchian ^etes, in whom Hadad has been found, and his descendant Saulaces, the Argonautic writers place Absyrtus, whose body was cut to pieces by his sister Medea as she fled with Jason over the Black Sea. An
equally tragic story is that of Rechab, called Leucippus, and wrongly made a son of the (Enomaus whose daughter was sought by Myrtilus. In love with Daphne, he disguised himself as a woman that he might follow her in the chase, but, being detected at the river Ladon, the companions of the fair huntress despatched him with their darts. Diodorus makes the Naxian Leucippus the father of Smardius and places before him in
Naxos, though in different families, Otus and Ephialtes, who fol
low Agassamenus, the successor of Biites, son of Boreas. Taking out Agassamenus or Chusham, there remain in regular order Beeri, Bedad, Hadad contemporary with Japhlet, Rehob and Murdas. This seems to be the historical order, so that Rehob must have been the husband of Mupallidhat Serua, the daughter of Assur Yupalladh, and the father of her son Cara-Murdas, whose evil fate overtook him in Egypt, his murderers being the Cassi,
or Cozites, under some successor of Anub, the (Enomaus of the
Greek story. As representing the Beerothite family in Babylonia, the name Zur-Sin, king of the four regions, who built Tubelini, should follow that of Cara-Murdas. Of Hadar, the successor of Zur-Sin, or Saul, no inscriptions have yet been published in which

his name can be detected, but in a so-called Cassite list there are
several Babylonian kings whose names, if Semitic, are read Etiru, if Turanian, Numgirabi. This Cassite list is headed with the
name Ulam-Girbat, which marks its contents as partly Zimrite, or Sumerian, for XJlam was the almost exclusive property of the Zimrites. But Shimon, the son of Hadarand Mehetabel, married Taia, the daughter of Bedan, who has been compared with BurnaBuryas as being the son of Ulam, or Ulam-Buryas. The inser
tion of ancestoi"s of intruding lines was a common practice on the banks of the Euphrates, as well as on those of the Nile, so that Etiru, although no descendant or connection of the Zimrites, might easily appear in the dynasty and denote Hadar. His successor, Etiru-Samas, may be Shimon, son of Hadar, but the following Etiru-Bel Matati looks very like Hadar's consort and Shimon's mother, Meheta-Bel. The successor of Shimon was Amnon, who.^e name first appears denoting a country or people
as Amnanu in the inscriptions of Sin-Gasit, of Urukh. In this form Sin-Gasit, or in that proposed by Sir Henry Rawlinson, Sinsada, the name cannot be reconciled with the Kenite genealogy, yet, as the son of a queen, whose name is doubtfully read BelatSunat, and as the builder and nourisher of Bitanna, as well as the king of Amnanu, the person so called can hardly be other than Amnon himself, the son of Shimon and Taia, Bedan's daughter. More solid ground is reached in the inscriptions of Ismi-dao-an and his son Gungunu, which have been found to set forth Shemidag, the son of Amnon, and his son Achian. At this point the guidance of the Kenite list fails, and tradition must associate with the Beerothite line Chushan Rishathaim, the
Mesopotamian enslaver of Israel.

CHAPTER XII.
The Hittites at the Tigris and Euphrates (Continued).
ReturnIiVG to the Zerethite family in its Babylonian connec
tions, the oldest name on the monuments is that of Urukh, a second Arioch of Ellasar, Several brief inscriptions of this king have been found at Muoheir, Erech, Larsa, Nipur, and Zerghul.
They are individually uninteresting, but afford the information that he was king of Ur and of Sumir and Accad, and that he built and restored the temples of the Moon, Bit Timgal, and Bit Sareser in Ur, of the Sun in Larsa, of Bit Anna in Erech, of Bel in Nipur,
and of Sarili in Zirgulla. It is by the last of these that his con
nection with Asareel, the youngest son of Jehaleleel, is indicated : "To Sarili, his king Urukh, king of Ur, in Zirgulla built."^ Ovid has preserved some particulars of Urukh's history. He calls him Orchamus, the seventh from Belus, and makes him a Persian king, giving him Eurynome for wife and Leucothoe for daughter. The circumstance celebrated by the poet is the love of Apollo for Leucothoe, and the consequent unhappy fate of the maiden, who
was buried alive by her father's orders.^ Pausanias describes Eurynome as a woman in the upper, and a fish in the lower part of her body, thus identifying her with Derceto, or Atargatis, who
is Jerigoth.^ As the namer of the Kenite Tirathites, or Tirgathi, she must belong to the family of Ezra, being the daughter of that
Kenite patriarch, or of his son Jether. As for Urukh, he is simply called Hur in the Kenite genealogy, which is much confused by the introduction of the impossible Caleb, son of Hezron.^ So frequently does this Caleb enter into the genealogy,
that it seems as if it should be translated, the dog, expressing the contempt of the editor for the Gentile kings and princes whose
1 Records of the Past, iii. 10. ^ Metamorphoses, iv. 3 Pausanias, viii. 41, * 1 ChroD. ii. 18

82 THE HITTITES.
families he chronicles. As Hur, he is the first born of Ephrath, or Ephratah, who is the Greek Aphrodite and Norse Frodi, the goddess of love and mother of Eros. This Ephratah belonged to the family of Bethlehem, the father of which was Salma, the son of Chedorlaomer, and grandson of Hareph.^ Asareel, therefore, must have been the husband of Ephrath. It has already been shown that the Tirgathi included the line of Arba and Anak, the former of whom is Arpoxais, called the son of the Scythian Targitaus. In Latin story Capys, or Ziph, is falsely made the son of Assaracus, or Asareel, but the true descent is found in Anchises, or Anak, who is the son of Capys. A reason for the confusion is illustrated in the story of Ovid, who terms the kingdom of Orchamus that of Saba. Ziph having left Babylonia for Egypt, his younger brother became his virtual successor, and, it may be, the very Assur from whom Ziph's descendant, Assur Yupalladh, took his title. The connection of Asareel with Salma of Bethlehem is shown in the tradition that Saracon was the son of Salamis, the daughter of Asopus. Pausanias inverts the order and represents Salamis, the mother of Asopus, as calling the island which afterwards bore her name, Cychraius. He connects the island with Telamon, or Talmai.the third son of Anak, and at the same place mentions a gigantic skeleton found in Lydia, which some attributed to Anax, but others to Geryon, the son of Chrysaor and Callirhoe, and others again to Hyllus." Here Hyllus
and Callirhoe alike denote Jehaleleel, and Geryon is Asareel. There is not much visible resemblance in the two words Asareel and Geryon, but the process by which the one was changed into the other is exemplified in the cognate word Jezreel, which is the Zeraheen of the Arabs and the Gerineum of the Crusaders. Geryon, whose father Chrysaor is probably a repetition of his own name, kept his herds in Iberia, or Erythea, or Acarnania, and had for their safekeeping a herdsman, Eurytion, and the dog Oi-thos the progeny of Typhon. Now as Eurytion and Orthos represent Jether and Jered, it would seem that Asareel had acquired supremacy over the Elamite Gedors. Acarnan, who also
represents Asareel, and who is also called Acarnas, was the son
5 1 Chron. ii. 50. 1 Paua. i. 36.



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 83
of Alcmaeon and Callirhoe, thus uniting the lines of Lechem or Bethlechem and Jehaleleel, which could only be by his marriage with Ephratah. In the Teutonic story of Gudrun, that princess becomes as the wife of King Jonakr the mother of Saurli, Hamdir, and Erp, thus whimsically associating Asareel with Hamath and Hareph. In Greek tradition Callirhoe is the wife of Tros Chr5'saor, Geryon, and Alcmaeon, which is a symbolical way of
connecting these names with that of Jehaleleel. Returning to Ephratah, or Aphrodite, the mother of Hur, or Urukh, we find her connection with the latter set forth, not merely as the mother of Eros or Cupid, but also by her being called the daughter of Aphros and Eurynome. or according to Epimenidcs, of Cronus and Eronyme, as well as by her epithets Erycina and Argynnis, and her Assyrian name Architis, quoted by Macrobius. All of these names have reference to the wife of her son Hur, namely, Jerigoth, called, as the wife of Orchamus, by the name Eurynome and identified with Atargatis or Derceto, the Syrian Aphrodite. Through her again Asareel is made the ancestor of the family of the Venuses in the Indian mythology, which gives to her as Durga the name Karali. Her son Eros is counted to BethLechem, in the statement that Orus was the son of Lycaon. But in Sanchoniatho she is called Beruth and made the consort of Elioun and the mother of the Phoenician Uranus. The name of Asareel is inverted to name the cannibal Laestrygones, whose ancestor was Lamus or Lechem, and in whose number Antiphates or Netophath appears. Now Netophath is of Salma, and among the sons of Sarpedon, or Hareph, there is an Antiphates. Asareel is represented in Pausanias by Lycurgus, who was a son with Cepheus of Aleus of Tegea. According to this author, he did nothing of importance beyond cutting off a warrior named Arethus, a fact mentioned in the Iliad. His sons Ancaeus and Epochus died, and he was succeeded by Echemus, son of iKropus, of Cepheus, of Aleus. Here again Ziph is the father of Arba, who was the grandfather of Achiman, yet Agapenor, the son of Ancaeus and grandson of Lycurgus, built a temple to Aphrodite in the Cyprian Paphos. By a similar inversion Asareel is called Lycotherses of Illyria, who married Agave, daughter of Cadmus.
And he is another Lycurgus, the father of Opheltes, but Apollo

dorus makes Eurynome the wife of Lycurgus, son of Aleus. Amid the confusion that reigns in all these traditions, there is evidence
that Asareel is the Sarili of Urukh's inscription, and that he is the father of Hur, the first born of Ephratah. Urukh built a temple to Belat, his lady, who may be Ephratah, his mother. His son Dungi calls his lady Ninmarki, the first
part of which, nin, a fish, may translate the Circassian arge Basque arraya, Yukahirian olloga, as the chief element in the
name of Jerigoth, which entitled her to be made a fish efoddess. But Dungi's own name is doubtful in the inscriptions, and does not appear in the Kenite list, although Dione, a name of Venus or Aphrodite, may have arisen out of it. The three sons of Jerigoth were Jesher, Shobab, and Ardon, the first of whom gave name to the Geshurites, who at one time occupied the southern border of Canaan, but in the days of Joshua dwelt with the Maachathites to the north of Gilead and Bashan. Ardon again was the namer of the Rutennu of Mesopotamia and Assyria, and at the same time the Duryodhana of the Mahabharata, who was the determined enemy of Yudisthira, or Hadad, the son of Bedad. In the time of Joshua, when all southern Palestine was in the
hands of Amorites and Philistines, three Hittite princes of this line of Asareel held Hebron. These were Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai." They were doubtless Geshurites, for the only other Talmai was a king of Gcsshur, and father of Maacah, the mother of Absalom.' That rebellious son of David named one of his daughters after his mother, and she became the wife of Rehoboam. This old woman, for she was queen dowager in the reign of her grandson Asa, introduced into Judah the worship of the Zerethite goddess Miphletzeth, the Muballidhat Serua, daughter of Yupalladh, whom the Beerothite Rehob married, and for this was removed from being queen by the reforming monarch of the Jews.^ The father of the three princes of Hebron was Anak, the son of Arba, and between Arba and Jesher in ascending order, must be placed Jair and Segub, whose father had married into the Gileadite family descended from Zimran.'" There had been,

THE HITTIIES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 85
however, an earlier alliance of this kind, for Urukh calls himself king of Sumir and Akkad, as does his son Dungi. Zimran mayhave placed himself and his servants under the rule of Urukh, whom he cannot have preceded by many years. In an inscription on a signet cylinder these words are read :

" To Urukh, the powerful man, king of Ur, Hassimir, viceroy of Isbaggi-Bel, thy servant." ^^ The name Isbaggi is that of one of Abraham's sons by Keturah, namely Ishbak, who seems thus to have been Urukh's contemporary and tributary.^^ It remains to be explained how Urukh and Dungi arrogated to themselves the title of kings of Akkad. The first king of Akkad or Agade was Sargon. He tells the story of his infancy in the following words :

" Sargina, the powerful king, king of Agade am I.
My mother was enceinte, my father knew not of it.
My father's brother oppressed the country. In the city of Azupirani, which by the side
of the Euphrates is situated, she conceived me
;
my mother was enceinte and in a grove brought me forth she placed me in a cradle of wicker, with bitumen my exit she closed, and launched me , on the river, which away from her carried me. The river to Akki the Abal floated me. Akki the Abal in tenderness of bowels lifted me
;
Akki the Abal as his child brought me up ; Akki the Abal as his husbandman placed me, and in my husbandry Ishtar prospered me."^^ A similar story is told by ^lian of Tilgamus, a Chaldean name, answering perfectly to the Assyrian Sargon. Sacchoris, king of Babylon, being informed by an oracle that a son of his daughter would take possession of his kingdom, shut her up in close confinement in a tower, to which, however, some obscure
man gained access and won the prisoner's affection. When her son was born, the custodians, fearing the wrath of the king, threw
11 Records of the Past, iii. 10. ^ Genesis xxv. 2. " Records of the Past, v. 3, 56.



86 THE HITTITES.
him out of a window in the tower and he would have perished had not an eagle received the child on its outspread winors. The
sagacious and benevolent bird deposited the infant in a garden, the owner of w hich took care of the eagle's charsfe and called the boy Tilgamus. When the child came to manhood he took possession of the kingdom of Babylon." In Greek story the incidents of Sargon's account of his infancy are transferred to Perseus and his mother Danae, and somewhat similar is the legend of • Auge and her son Telephus. But in Welsh tradition the infancy of Taliesin answei-s perfectly to that of Sargon, for he was
exposed by his mother in a coracle which was drifted to the fishing weir of Gwyddno Garanhir, a petty king of Cardigan, whose son Elfin became the protector of the child. But Taliesin, although his name agrees with that of Tilgamus, was no con
queror save in bardic contests. It is a coincidence, also, that Acca Larentia, the wife of Faustulus, who was the herdsman of King Numitor, was the foster mother of the twins, Romulus and Remus, whom Amulius, the brother of Numitor and usurper of his kingdom, had exposed in a basket on the Tiber. The basket drifted into shore, and a she wolf suckled the children, as in the story of Telephus a hind is said to have done. Then Faustulus brought the twins home to Acca. Coming to years of manhood they were recognized by their grandfather Numitor, whom they restored to the kingdom, from which they expelled the perfidious
Amulius. The Latin story contains part of the tradition of Orchamus and his daughter Leucothoe, for when Amulius exposed the children in the Til>er, he at the same time caused their mother Rhea Sylvia to be buried alive. The nominal connection of the stories of Sargon and Romulus is found in Sargon's Son called Naram-Sin or Rim-Agu, but who in the Kenite list is Harum. Still another story is that of Telegonus, whose name corresponds to that of Tilgamus. He was born to Odysseus of Ithaca by Circe, the enchantress of the island iEaea, and was
there deserted by his father. But Circe also bore two other sons named Agrius and Latinus. Once more our hero is the namer of the Telchins, wonder workers of Rhodes, who counted among them Megalesius, Ormenus, Nikon, and Simon, with Actaeus
their leader.
'^ De Animalibus, xii. 21.



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 87
All of these stories centre in Regem, the eldest son of Jahdai, who is a wise Odysseus born long before his time, an Actaeus father of Telchin, as was Odysseus of Telegonus, and an Akkad who stands at the head of the Akkadian line ; for the cuneiform
languages accentuate the aspirate of Jahdai or Jachdai, which the Egyptian and Arabic drop in Aadtous and Adite. Sacchoris, the
father of the deserted wife, is Seir or Segir, the Horite, and Akki the Abal, Acca Larentia, Auge, mother of Telephus, and iEaea^ the abode of Circe, take their name from his father Ajah, the son of Zibeon and descendant of the Horite dux Ebal.^^ The children of Seir were Lotan, who is the Latinus united with Telegonus, and Timna or Timnag. The Horites spoke a Semitic language and taught the same to Sargon of Agade. Now the meaning of Timna, according to Gesenius, is " restrained from intercourse with men," and certainly Gesenius never dreamt of connecting one whom he deemed an obscure Canaanitic woman with the story of Sacchoris and Tilgamus. This Timna became the concubine of Eliphaz, the eldest son of Esau and the mother of a junior Arpalek.^*' This must have been subsequent to her desertion by Jahdai. But this second union explains the connection of Telephus and Auge,' and the adoption of Taliesin by Elphin. We must regard the tale of Sargon as a true one, and all similar
stories as imperfect copies of the original. It appears, therefore, that Jahdai, who belonged to the Zuzim or Achuzamites, dwelling in what afterwards was the land of Ammon, while a young man travelled as an adventurer to a certain city on the Euphrates called Azupirani, where Seir or Segir the Horite reigned ; that he met Timna, the daughter of that king and sister of Lotan, and by her had a son named Rekem, whom he perfidiously deserted ; and that after his departure, Ajah, the grandfather of Timna, protected her child. Subsequently Timna accepted the suit of Eliphaz, wh©se father Esau had married Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, Ajah's brother. When Sargon says that his father's brother oppressed the land we are unable to follow him, for the Kenite list does not m'ention his brother. Thus Sargon or Sar-Ru3'kin is Regem the son of Jachdai, Telegonus the son
15 Gen. xxxvi. 20, 24. i« Gen. xxxvi. 12, 22.



as THE HITTITES.
of Odysseus, Telchin the son of Actaeus, and Tilganms. the
grandson of Saeclioris. Such is the story of the infancy of him who revolutionized for a time the history of the east and made his influence felt in Egypt. Few names are more widely extended in the traditions of the world than that of Regem. To the Arabs he is known as Lokraan ; to the Armenians and Georgians as Thargamos ; to the Hindus as Lakshman, Ulkhamukha, and Crishna. In their annals of Sicyon the Greeks repeated his name as Telchin and Thelxion ; in Italy he was Tarquin the Lucumo. Teutonic song preserves his memory as Regin the smith, and Irish history as Luighne of the line of Heromon. Even in America the Iroquois Book of Rites acknowledges the primacy of Tekarihoken ; and the pagans of Guatemala adore Hurakan. Alread\' in connection with the story of Jabez the tale of the Dispossessed Princes has been set forth. When Jahdai married •the Ammonian Zobebah and thus became the second Amenemes, it was underst<x>d that the crown of Memphis should descend only to their joint offspring. Thus the infant Jabez gained the succession, and Regem with his brothers Jotham, Geshnn, Pelet, Ephah, and Shaaph were excluded. Regem was in the Babylonian kingdom of Seir the Horite, but Geshan and Pelet seem to have accompanied their father to his new kingdom and to have settled on the north-eastern border of Egypt, Geshan in the land of Goshen named after him, and Pelet in Beth Palet to the north of the Arish or river of Egypt. Between these two domains lay the wilderness of Etam, to which part of the native royal family of Egypt had withdmwn, and with them Pelet made alliance, marrying either a daughter of Jezreel or his sister Zelelponi, who is the Greek Persephone, daughter of Ceres, whom Pluto carried away to his realm of darkness. From this union sprang Maachah, the head of the Maachathites, who dwelt for a time with the Geshurites in-southern Palestine, but afterwards were driven to Jezreel and Megiddo, south of Carmel, and finally sought refuge from the Amorites in the north of Bashan.^" The whole family of Jahdai was regarded as Plutonian, and its members were the gods of the under world. Jahdai himself was Hades ; Regem was Orcus or Uragum ; Jotham, Aidoneus ; Geshan, Agesander ;
i^ 1 Chron. ii. 4S, makes Maachah a woman !



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 89
Pelet, Pluto, Plutus, Polydectes, and Polydeginon, So also in Egypt, Balot was the Elysium ; and in Assyria Bit-Hedi, the abode of the dead. This imagery will be found throughout the world, indicating that the Aadtous of the Egyptians were the inventors of the Funereal Ritual of that people and of the religious system which it illustrates. The Arabs were better acquainted with the name of Pelet than with that of any other Adite king, except Regem or Lokman. Pelet they called Walid, but their accounts of him are fabulous in the extreme and contradictory. Walid is sometimes called a son of Ad, at others of Amaiek, and it is related that before the time of Joseph he conquered Lower Egypt and was. the first to assume the name of Pharaoh. After a few generations his posterity was ex|)elled by the native Egyptians and finally destroyed by Israel.^^ Riyan, the son of this Walid, was converted by Joseph to the worship of the true God. He was a most accomplished prince, for he conversed with his spiritual instructor and prime minister in no fewer than seventy languages. Some Arabian writers maintain that the same Pharaoh lived till the time of Moses, a case of longevity worthy of the Shah Nameh and Raja Tarangini, but the general opinion is that Al Walid, the Adite, before whom the Hebrew prophet wrought signs and wonders, was the son of Masab, the son of Riyan. Riyan may stand for Regem, or for his son Harum, but Masab, called the son of Kabus, is undoubtedly Mezahab. " Abulfeda says that Masab being one hundred and seventy years old, and having no child, while he kept the herds (a strange occupation for a king), saw a cow calve, and heard her say at the same time, O, Masab, be not grieved, for thou shalt have a wicked son, who will be at length cast into hell. And he accordingly had this Walid, who afterwards coming to be king of Egypt, proved to be an impious tyrant." In the Crishna legends Pelet occupies a subordinate position as Baladeva, the faithful brother of that hero. In the Ramayana he is put in the place of Jabez as Bharat, by whose elevation Rama, Lakshman, and Satrugna were dispossessed ; but he is represented as a generous brother, hastening after Rama and vainly seeking to induce him to accept the crown. In the Greek and Latin versions of Hittite tradition
1* Sale's Koraiv



90 THE HITTITES.
Pelet rises to the highest dignity, one of the twin brethren typifi
ing the whole Hittite race as the Dioscuri, for he is Polydeukes or Pollux, worthy to be ranked with Castor or the great Achashtari. Castor was slain by the sons of Aphareus, but the mighty Pollux avenged his brother's death and brought him to an intermittent life by sharing his immortality with him. This fable must relate to the wars of Seti Menephtah. or Zoheth, grandson of Ophrah, with the Achashtarite line of Ma Reshah on the Arish and Serbonian bog, and with the Maachathites farther
north in -Beth Palet, and may refer to the conditions of their league against the Egyptian power, as involving alternate command of the allied armies, generously consented to by the descendants of Pelet in spite of some signal weakening of the might of Rosh. The Sanscrit records also recognize the quasi divinity of Pelet as Pulastya, the strong Yakcha, father of Kuvera,
who takes the place of Plutus as the god of riches, for Kuvera is Sheber, the eldest son of Maachah.^® Unhappily the Greeks have preserved little or nothing of the history of Polydorus, son of Cadmus, or Getam, his father-in-law, who is said to have married Nycteis, a disguise of his son Maachah, the Macedo, son of Osiris of Diodorus, and to have been the father of an impossible Labdacus. But northern Europe knows him well as Baldur, son of Odin :
" Baldiir the white Sun-god has departed, Beautiful as summer's dawn was he, Loved of gods and men, the royal hearted
Baldur, the white Sun god, has deiMirted
"
He was the brother of Asa Thor, and came with the rest of the Aesir from Asgard in the far east. Nothing could harm Baldur the good, the invulnerable son of Odin, it was thought, so that the Aesir amused themselves hurling their darts at his body and striking at him with sword, lance and battle-axe. But the mis
tletoe, that belonged neither to earth, sea, nor sky, had taken no oath to leave him unmolested ; and the blind Hodur with no thought of evil in his mind, obeyed the guiding hand of the tempter Loki, and launched the apparently feeble missile full at
his brother's breast, who fell to the ground pierced through and

through. Hermoder then undertook his perilous journey to Helheim to bring his brother back, but Hela held her own. Here Herraod, or Hermoder, is a historical personage, Harum the son of Regeni ; yet Pelet's wonderful story is wrapped in mystery which the light of future Egyptian studies may yet dispel. Once more Pelet is Pirithous, noblest of men and truest friend, who, hearing of the exploits of Theseus, invaded his land. The Athen
ian monarch came to repel the foe that already was carrying off his herds, but when Pirithous beheld him in all his manly beauty he forebore to fight, and stretching forth his hand cried :
'' Be
judge thyself; what satisfaction dost thou require?" "Thy friendship," answered Theseus, full of equal admiration ; and the heroes swore eternal fidelity. Together they fought the Centaurs, whom in the Teutonic tale Hodur represents, and in pleasant companionship they pursued the Calydonian boar, or the Gileadites of Zimri, who had foresworn allegiance to Akkad, and had ranged themselves on the side of the Zerethites and the Gedors of Elam. But the happy days of friendship came to an end when Pirithous sought to carry off' Persephone, for though his faithful friend Theseus, who had stuck by him to the last, was delivered by Hercules from the bondage of the under world, that hero failed to rescue the Athenian's second self, for the earth quaked beneath
his feet as he extended his hand to the prisoner on the enchanted rock, and Pirithous was left there for ever. No one has a bad word for Pelet, but in every quarter his praises are sung. There must have been something singularly attractive in a character
that receives such universal praise. Achashtari, or Castor, is but
a shadowy vision in the distant past, but Pelet, or Pollux, is true
flesh and blood, and that of earth's very best. Returning to Regem, we find him in Buddhist story as Ulkamukha, the son of king Amba, or Okkaka, and his queen Hasta, who with his three brothers was set aside that Janta, the son of a young low-caste woman, might be set upon the throne. In the Ramayana he is really represented by Rama, the eldest son of Dasaratha, king of Oude, or Ayodya, who is Harum, the son of Regem, but his nominal representative is Lakshman. The three brothers, Rama, Lakshman, and Satrugna, were disinherited in favour of Bharat, whose mother had gained ascendancy over

the king. This pre-eminence of Bharat agrees with the Arabian
exaltation of Walid, and seeuis to indicate a viceixsyalty of Pelet under Jabez, which the magnanimous Bharat ottered to resign to his elder brother ; but Rama and Lakshman went forth to seek their fortunes elsewhere, as did Ulkamukha and his brothers in the Buddhist tradition. The}' allied themselves with the Bharatas, but, as the chief supporter of Yudisthira, Regem appe&is under the name of Krishna, a Yadu, the son of Aditi, and father of Dharma. He was a fatal child, like Tilgamus and Romulus, and like the former was brought forth in a prison into which Kansa,
a tyrant, had thrown his sister Devaki. He was reared b}- Nniida in the land of cows, and became a mighty warrior, the overthrower of numberless enemies, and the right arm of the Bharatas. Like
Achilles, he was vulnei-able in the heel, and in that part of his body, as he was one day reposing, a huntsman shot him so tliat h<* died. In the Arabian traditions Lokman was the only A<lite of note who escaped when divine judgment fell on the nation for its idolatry. The prophet Hud had vainly sought the reformation of the people ; a few only believed him. Then drought
afflicted the land, and the Adites, instead of turning to God, sent
three envoys, of whom Lokman wa? one, to otter sacrifice at Mecca and pray for rain. One of the three ascended the mountain of the Amalekites and sacrificed the victims, when three clouds of varying size and blackness appeared overhead, and a voice from heaven
cried : " Choose for thy nation." The envoy chose the largest and darkest, when descending as a whirlwind it swept him away, and hastening to the Adite land involved the tribe in ruin. But those who had believed Hud lived, and Lokman ruled over them for a long time, after which they were changed into monkeys. Some say that he reigned a thousand years, after which Yarub, the son of Kahtan, conquered the Adites. Lokman was a great civilizer. In Mareb, the capital of Sheba, he made his capital, and the land alternately desolated by droughts and inundated by mountain torrents, he turned into a garden, by building the dyke of Arini, a great reservoir which received^he surplus waters and gave them forth in time of drought. He was called Dhu Unuscour, or the man of the vultures, and his vultures bore the name of Lubad. Here is what the Quiches of Guatemala say of the Adite calamity
:



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 93
" Such were the wooden men and pith women, such the children they generated, and whose descendants so multiplied that they sufficed to people the world. But fathers and children, from lack
of intelligence, did not employ the tongues they had received to
praise the benefit of their creation, and never dreamt of raising
their eyes to glorify Hurakan. Then they were carried away
with a flood. A rain of resin and pitch fell from heaven. A bird called Xecotcowatch tore out their eyes ; another called Camalotz cut off" their heads ; and a beast named Cotzbalam ground their bones. Such was the end of these ungrateful men ; for they had
failed to render thanks to their mother and their father, to the face of the Heart of Heaven, whose name is Hurakan. And because of them the earth was darkened and it rained night and day. And men went and came beside themselves, as if stricken with madness ; they sought to ascend to the roofs, and the houses crumbled beneath them ; they sought to climb the trees, and the trees shook them off far from them. And when they went to caverns and grottos for refuge, inmiediately these shut them in.
Such was their punishment and their destruction. But the creators preserved a small number of them as a memorial of the
wooden men they had made ; these are the little beings that we call monkeys, and that dwell in our forests to-day." ^o In the Ramayana the hero Kama is said to have been attended by an army of monkeys, under the guidance and command of Hanuman, the monkey king. Another monkey story is that of the Arimi, who mocked Jupiter when he asked their aid against the Titans, whereupon the offended deity changed them into apes. Some writers place the scene of this transformation off* the coast of Campania
in Italy, where were the Pithecus-ae, or Monkey islands ; others situate it in Asia Minor. But Strabo explains it when he says that the Tyrrhenians call apes arimi. If this name was in use among the Hittites to denote animals of the monkey tribe in ancient days, it must have changed its signification, for the Georgian iremi and Basque orein now denote a deer. In JPeruvian, however, llama, which seems to be the same word, means bea5t in general ; and in the same Quichua language an explanation is found of the name Cercopes, applied to the apes that

infested Lydia in the time of Omphale and Hercules, for carachupaSy which must have originally been a name for a monkey now means that commoner creature of arboreal habits, the squirrelIt being granted that arim was a Hittite word for ape, the names of Naram Sin, son of Sargon ; Harum, son of Regem ; Rama brother of Lakshman ; and Arim, the dyke of Lokman, show how it came to be applied to a people. It is indeed the Armenian name, for Armenaeus in Moses of Chorene is the son of Haic, and grapdson of Thargamos.-* The Buddhist and Brahmanical stories of the dispossessed princes are in general narratives of fact, although incorrect in names and details. The same account is given in the Kagyur of the Tibetans : " To Ikshwaku succeeds his son, whose descendants (one hundred) afterwards successively reign at Potala, the last of
whom was Ikshwaku Videhalca. He has four sons. After the death of his first wife he marries again. He obtains the daughter of a king, under the condition that he shall give his throne to the
son that shall be born of that princess. By the contrivance of
the chief officers to make room for the young prince to the suc
ce.ssion, he ordere the expulsion of his four sons". The princes set out to seek their fortune, and the narrative proceeds much in the same way as in the Singhalese legend. The descendants of Videhaka, to the number of 55,000, reigned at Kapilawastu." -^ The Singhalese legend here mentioned is that called the Buddhist story, and it tells how the princes came upon a famous ascetic, called Kapila, engaged in devotion in a forest near a lake, where,
owing to his piety, there was no strife, so that the timid hare found rest in it, and the destroyer was miraculously compelled to cease destroying. There the dispossessed princes built a city and
called it after the sage Kapila. There also, to preserve the purity
of their race, they married their sisters, a practice that prevailed in some Buddhist countries and in Peru. The name Kapila is important, for it is the same as Abal applied to that Akki who brought up Sargon. It is the name of the Horite Ebal, which,
beginning with the letter ayin, is called Gaibal in the Septuagint, and from it the region of Gebalene, in which Seir or Mount* Hor

THE HIxftTES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 95
was situated, derived its name. If, however, Sargon's account of his infancy be true, and there is no reason to doubt it, Gebalene must have extended across the desert to the Euphrates, for on that river his bark was launched, and on its bank Akki the Abal found him. Ikshwaku is well determined as Coz the Ammonite "and first Amenemes. In the Ramayana it is said ; " Ikshvaku was the son of Manu, and to him the prosperous earth was formerly given by his father. Know that this Ikshvaku was the former king in Ayodhya." ^^ In the Singhalese story he is represented by Okkaka, the gourd, and his son Amba takes the place of the Brahmanical Nabhaga to denote Anub, son of Coz. But the Tibetan account of the dispossessed princes rightly puts
Videhaka in the place of Amba as their father. The Arabian and Quiche traditions of a great destruction of the Adites must refer to their expulsion from Egypt and subsequent dispersion. But the story of the dyke of Arim, although associated with the ruins of a great reservoir between two mountains in southern Arabia, is evidently a reminiscence of the great lake Moeris, constructed in Egypt under Jabez, or Amenemes III., when the pawer of the Aadtous was at its height. The name Sedd Mareb given to it probably contains a corruption of that of the Egyptian Moeris Lubad, the name of Lokman's vultures, and Yarub, that of the conqueror of his Adites after his death, are both forms of Rapha, who married Sargon's widow and followed him on the throne, and the Quiche bird Camalotz is his successor Samlah of Masrekah, the Persian Simurgh, and original of the Stymphalides.
These particulars call for a fuller in.sight into the history of Regem. Tradition informs us that Reorem or Sarsfon of Ao^ade married a daughter of Urukh. Diodorus says that Lapithus, who is Rapha, married Orsinome, the daughter of Eurynome and widow of Arsinous. Now Eurynome was the wife of Orchamus and the mother of Leucothoe, and she has been identified as a fish goddess with Jerigoth or Derceto. Turning from tradition, which represents Regem as Arsinous, to the Kenite list, the daughter of Hur and Jerigoth appears as Azubah or Gazubah. In Greek tradition she is made as Cassiepea, the daughter of an Arabus instead of

96 THE HITTITES. •
his wife. But in the Babylonian list this princess immediately follows Sargon. In Assyrian her name is read Bauellit, but in Akkadian it is Azagbau.'^* Mr. George Smith calls her Ellatgula, and says : " Ellatgula was a queen ; she probably succeeded Naram-Sin, and was the last of the dynasty of Sargon. Nothing is known of her reign, and at its close Hammurabi, a foreign prince who was perhaps related to her by marriage, succeeded to the throne.""^^ The three forms, Bauellit, Ellatgula and Azagbau
represent part of the difficulty that lies in the way of him who would connect the ancient history of the east with that of the rest of the world. Nevertheless the Kenite and Babylonian lists agree with Greek tradition in making Sargon the husband of Azubah, a Zerethite princess of the line of Asareel, who, through her mother, was also connected with the Elamite Gedors. In Indian tradition Krishna is the husband of tl:e Gopias.
It is now clear how Urukh called himself king of Akkad, for by this union Sargon became for a time hfs tributary, and it
doubtless pleased the Zerethite to call himself sovereign of a family tlmt, in the person of Jahdai, sat upon Egypt's throne. Yet it is remarkable that Sargon s name is Assyrian, while that of his consort is Akkadian. His mother's influence, and that of
her family, the Ebalian Horites, must have been responsible for
this Semitizing influence, and it may appear in the story of Tarquin, originally called Lucumo, whose ambitious wife Tanaquil incited him to assume the manners of the Tuscans and aim at royalty. Tanaquil is Tinniag, his mother, rather than his wife, yet the memory of Azubah or Gazubah must have been fragrant in the estimation of Sargon 's descendants, who, while they named the great centre of Hittite authority Carchemish or Ka-Rekemish, the enclosure of Regem, after him. gave the natne of his spouse to Sazabe, the fortified camp of the imperial army. Azubah was the mother of Sargon's son Naratn-Sin or Rim-Sin, who is the Kenite Harum, for in some traditions concerning this son he is connected, not with Regem, but with Hur, his mother's
father. As Orion, for instance, he is called the son of Hyrieus and as Hermes he is said to have been brought up by the Horao
« Proc. Soc. Bib. Arch., Jan. 11, 1881, p. 37. «6 Records of the Past, v. 64.



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 97
The Semitic influence exerted by the Horite mother of Regem
can only have lasted during his lifetime, for after his early death the Zerethite Jether, Shobab, and Ardon, brothers perhaps of Azubah, must have restored the Hittite language and customs in the Akkadian kingdom. The following are the inscriptions of Sargon, the first being a
continuation of the story of the infanc}' :

1. " Forty-five years the kingdom I took.
The people of the dark races I ruled.
I
. . . . over difficult countries,

The second inscription consists of ten paragraphs, each of which is headed by an account of the moon's position and the favourableness of the omen. Omitting these astrological nothings, it reads :

2. " Sargon at this position to Elam marched and the Elamites destroyed.
Their overthrow he accomplished, their limbs he cut off. An omen for Sargina who to Syria marched and the Syrians destroyed ; the four races his hand conquered.

The encampment he broke through. Subarti in its strength its people to the sword he subdued, and Sargina their seats caused to occupy, and
their men he fought against, their overthrow he accomplished, their great army the spoil he collected, into Akkad he caused to
enter." ^ These unsatisfactory documents set forth Sargon as a great • warrior and conqueror, and lead one to suspect that he was a tyrant as well and came to a tyrant's end. They are the inscriptions of a selfish and vain-glorious man. His chief wars were with the Gedors of Elam or Subarti, wars in which he had the

THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 99
aid of Hadad the. son of Bedad, and his brother Pelet, for, as Krishna, his allies were Yudisthira and Baladeva, but he says not a word about these gallant warriors. Unless the statement that he conquered the whole of Babylonia includes the overthrow of the three sons of Urukh, his brothers-in-law, one of whom was the Duryodhana of the Mahabharata, the great contest between the Bharatas and Kurus is unmentioned. It is allowed in the
Indian epic that Krishna, being related to both parties,- at first was undecided, now favouring one side and now the other, but in the end he joined the Bharatas, and, fighting for them, was killed by a savage Bhil. It is ci«ar that he did not subdue Gebalene, for after the fall of Husham that country was held by the strong hand of Hadad. But it seems that he carried his arms into Galilee, whose Chesulloth is his Kazalla, for Kastubila of Kazalla answers to Castabolum of Cilicia in the country of the later Kue, the Goim of Galilee, the Acheeans or ^gialeans of Ihe Greeks. Thus the Japhetic allies of Chedorlaomer on the sea of the setting sun felt the power of the Akkadian king. Tradition adds very little to the story of Regem. As the Indian Krishna he is a profligate, strong and handsome, but with no moral excellence. As Lakshman in the Ramayana he is but a foil to
the merits of Rama, called his brother, but who is really his son Harum. As Tarquinius Priscus he is a great conqueror and nothing more. In the Greek Telchin he appears as the patron of art and mystery ; and in Telegonus he is the slayer of his father Odysseus. The Teutonic legends give him as Regin the Smith a very subordinate position, and even as the Scandinavian Regnar Lodtvrok he is a barbarian with a spice of savage poetry in him. The mediaeval tale of Valentine and Orson contrasts his rudeness
with the culture of his polished brother Pelet. From the terror
which the warlike exploits of Regem inspired sprang the fable of the Gorgons. The capital of the Chorasmii, who dwelt in or to the north of Hyrcania, and are well identified with the men of Carchemish in eastward migration, was Gorgo, or more probably Gorgum, which is now Urghenz. The mortal Medusa, whom Stheno and Euryale surrendered to Perseus, denotes the Midianite alliance, and Euryale represents the posterity of Aharhel, the grandson of Regem through Harum. The Gorgon name comes



100 THE HITTITES.
from Ka Regem, to which was added ish, the enclosure, thus constituting Carchemish the centre of Hittite authority, the conquest of which was the great achievement of the reign of Perseus, or the second Rameses. With this namer of dragons, krakens, and other monsters, the reptile tribe is always connected. Snakes swarmed around the Gorgon's head ; Krishna slew the thousand headed serpent, but another emerged just before his death from the throat of his brother Baladeva ; Fafnir the dragon is the brother of Regin the Smith ; and Regnar Lodbrok, slayer of the serpent that encircled the bower of Thora, also married Aslauga, daughter of Fafnisbana, and died ii^ a dungeon full of vipers that killed him with their venom. An explanation of this appears in the early history of Japan, which states that Zinmou, the first king of Japan, was the son of Tamayori, the daughter of Riozin or the dragon god ; but other authorities make this prince^p the daughter of the king of the Loo Choo Archipelago, the native name of which is Riukiu. " In ancient times the kings of the Loo Choo islands at their inauguration wore a crown in the shape of a dragon, a mark of distinction reserved for them and
their family."^^ In Japan also, as in China, a dragon is the emblem of imperial power. With Regem or Sargon this use of the dragon must have originated, and on the walls of his city of Akkad first floated the awe-inspiring banners bearing the strange device that afterwards waved over Carchemish, the dragon's hold, and thence accompanied the Hittite exiles to many distant
lands. The son of Regem and Azubah was Harum, the father of Aharhel or Hercules. In Italy the glory of Tarquin eclipsejii his, for he is the mild and obscure son Aruns. In Greece he is the god Hermes or Mercury, a master thief and the messenger of the gods, brought up by the Horae, who represent the family of Ur or Urukh, rather than the Ebalian Horites. And he is Orion, the sriant whom some traditions make the son of Poseidon and Euryale ; but Euryale, besides being a Gorgon, denotes his son
Aharhel. In another story he, as Hermes, assisted at his own birth, for that god with Zeus and Poseidon strolled one day into Hyria in BcBotia, where the aged Hyrieus hospitably entertained

them. His beloved wife was dead and he had no child, so the gods took the hide of his only ox which he had killed for their benefit, and buried it in the ground, where it underwent marvellous transformation and came forth a boy whom Hyrieus called Orion. Here Hyria and Hyrieus, like the Horae, denote Hur the father of Azubah. When the giant grew up he married Side, the pomegranate, of unknown parentage, who is probably the same as Merope, the daughter of (Enopion, whom he met and loved in Chios. (Enopion and Orion quarrelled, however, and the blameless king: made the sriant drunk and then blinded him. To get back his sight he waded over the sea to Hephaestus at Lemnos, and the god of fire, unable to heal the blind man" gave
him Kedalion for his guide, who led him to the gates of day. There the sun arose upon the sightless eyeballs and the giant saw once more. He went back to Chios to find CEnopion, but could not, for they had hidden him under ground, which probably means that he slept his last sleep in an Egyptian pyramid. Many are the legends of Orion's death. Artemis slew him with her darts ; Apollon induced her to shoot at his black head, which alone was visible as he waded in the sea, and which she did not recognize to be a part of him whom she loved ; .and she and Latona sent a scorpion that stung him to death, because he boasted that he could kill anything that sprang from the earth. His connection •with the family of (Enopion, son of Bacchus of
Chios, is clear, for " Coz begat Anub and Zobebah and the families of Aharhel the son of Harum."^^ He died in Egypt, for Brugsch Pasha found his tomb at Sakkara, on which his name is written Haremsaf Merenra; and the same authority traces his descent from Khua and his wife Nebet on the mother's side. But Pepi Merira, as Jahdai is called, was no father of Harum, for Regem intervened. Haremsaf is identified with the constellation Orion and with Harmachis, but his mummy is not that of a giant. On the pyramid which contained this sarcophagus of Haremsaf is written : " Thou hast made me to live, thou hast united thy bones, thou hast brought back what has swum away from thee ; thou hast regained what has been divided from thee, for I am Horus,
the avenger of his father.
2« 1 Chron. iv. 8.



102 THE HITTITES,
" I have struck for thee ; thou hast been struck. I have avenged my father, my father the Osiris H. M., from the one doing ill to him. I have come to thee."^^ Did he come into the land of Egypt from the Akkadian kingdom to avenge the death of his grandfather Jahdai, slain by
assassins before his son Jabez was born ? It seems very like, for his son Acharchel is numbered among the Hycsos or Shepherd Kings, and must have been a viceroy of the great Aahpeti. That he went into Egypt there is no doubt, for his inscriptions testify
to his conquests in that land. But first as Rim-agu he professed to descend from Kudur Mabuk or Jether, calling himself his son. The descent was through his mother Azubah, the daughter of Jerigoth, the daughter of Jether. This was his title to Elam which his father Regem had conquered. Hence we find " Rim
agu, ruler of the lordship of Nipur, tnizkin of ancient Eridu,"*" showing that Jered even was old in his day. He also calls him
self the nourisher of Ur, king of Larsa, and king of Sumir and Akkad, as well as the head ruler of the house of Nergal, the
renowned man, and the builder of Harris-galla, to prevent invasion. Nergal is certainly his son Acharchel, and it is probable that Harris-galla was named after him. His great conquest was that of Karrak, the capital of the Amalekite Husham in the land of Moab. It was Rama then and not Krishna, Harum and not Regem, who fought with Midian, Amalek, and the Zerethites in the field of Moab and overthrew their supremacy for a while at Kuruk.shetra. He does not mention Ardon or Duryodhana, but the land of Geshur named after Jesher, Ardon's elder brother, fell into his power : " Kissure he occupied and his powerful soldiers Bel gave him in numbers." =*^ Again he is Naram-Sin, the son of Sargon, who went to Maganna, which is the most ancient cuneiform name of Egypt. " An omen for Naram-Sin who at this position to Apirak marched and ipltisu Ris-Vul, king of Apirak and Apirak his hand conquered

:
" Naram-Sin, king of the four races, conqueror of Apirak and
Magan." There is no need for identifying Apirak with Karrak, as Mr. George Smith proposed to do. It was the border kingdom
of Egypt, the Avaris where tlie Hycsos had their fortified camp situated near the Pelusiac mouth of the Nile, and, as a kingdom, extending to the Arish or river of Egypt. Ris-Vul, its king whom Naram-Sin does not say that he conquered, was Ma Reshah, the Egyptian Moeris or Mares, and the Phrygian Marsyas, friend of Cybebe and guardian of the youthful Sabazius. Who the enemies were whom Harum met there and in Maganna or Egypt proper may yet be known. Ovid's dogs that tore Actaeon are many ; from Sparta,. which means of Etam and Jezreel ; from Crete, the Zerethite descendants of Suphis or Ziph ; from Cyprus, the line of Chepher in Mered's descendants ; from Guossus, the Kenezzites of Pachnan and Staan, the Shepherds ; from Sicyon, the Chushamites of Amalek ; and from Arcadia, the Jerachmeelites of On ; all these dogs tore the empire of Egypt among them.^^ The untranslated Iplusu before Ris-Vul suggests, Ibil or Apil-Sin,
the descendant of Zabu or Ziph, the Cretan or Zerethite, as a usurper of the realm of Ma Reshah, which was known in later ages as the coast of the Cherethites. But the descendants of
Anub seem to be pointed out in tradition as the chief enemies of Harum as Orion. Anub indeed appears in the list of Shepherd Kings, but so does the inimical Pachnan, Apachnas, or Kenaz.
His son Tolag is associated in tradition with Cres the king of Crete, and seems to have been an outcast from the Ammonian fold. So far as the joint testimony of Babylonian and Egyptian monuments goes, Harum was the avenger of his grandfather Jahdai and the restorer of the land of Egypt to tranquility and prosperity. Manetho recognizes his connection with the Pharaonic
32 Records of the Past, v. 62. 33 Metamorphoses, iii.

line, but erroneously makes his Armais the same person as the Greek Danaus and the opponent of Egyptus. On the contrary, Harum appears as the opponent of the Dinhavites, whom the strength of his arm helped to drive southward into Elephantine. Harum is the hero of an epic, the Ramayana, which tells the story of his exploits. Confounding him with his father Regem, it makes him the chief of the dispossessed princes, and turns his father into his companion Lakshman, after whom Luckuow in Oude was named. The name of Dasaratha is given to Jahdai. It is not a fictitious name, but one pertaining to the Zerethites, for in Illyria and with the Dardanii dwelt the people whom
Pliny calls Dassaretae, and Strabo, Dasaretii. In form the word recalls the Egyptian Tosorthus, so that it is probably the ancestral Zereth in one of its protean disguises. Harum was a Zerethite through his mother Azubah, but Jahdai his grandfather had no connection with that family. Dasaratha is called the king of Kosala, which must denote Geshur, the Kisure occupied by RimSin, rather than Kazalla which Sargou took from the Goim of Galilee. This Kozala is said to have been conterminous with Oude or Ayodya. In India, however, the true Geshur is Gvijerat, but its reception of that name took place many ages after Rama.
Regem, then, though living a fictitious life as Lakshman, was
dead when the story of Rama begins, for that prince is repre
sented as under the care of the Zerethites, and notably of Jesher the elder brother of his mother Azubah. While he was still young, the great sage Visvamitra, an intangible personage living through the centuries, came to Ayodya to get help against the tumultuary giants that continually interrupted the sacrifices on the banks of the Sone. Rama accompanied him and brought the
giants into subjection, so that the sacrifice was safely performed. This is the Egyptian campaign. While on this expedition he learned that the king of Mithila off'ered his daughter in marriage
to the prince who should succeed in stringing an enormous bow that had descended from a giant ancestor. This is the Greek story of CEnomaus, who promised Hippodamia to the man who should escape from his spear in a chariot race. Pausanias and ApoUodorus enumerate the many suitors who fell at his hand, and among them name Eurymachus and Euryalus, who are



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 105
Harum as Harmachis and his son Aharhel, for (Enomaus is another version of CEnopion. Mithila again is Metelis between Onuphis and Canopus in the Xoite kingdom. As Orion has Side for his bride, and a daughter of CEnopion who, though called Merope, is the same woman, so Rama wins by his strength in snapping the bow in twain, Sita the daughter of Mithila's king. After the wedding Rama was to ascend the throne of Ayodya, but the mother of Bharat insists that her son shall reign and his brothers go into banishment. So Rama goes forth, a knight errant, performing everywhere deeds of chivalry. But, taking advantage of his absence, Ravana, the dark and gigantic
king of Lanka in Ceylon, carries off the hero's bride. Rama
starts in pursuit of the ravisher. On his way to the south he finds two kings, Bali and Sugriva, engaged in war. ' He takes the part of Sugriva and subdues Bali, in w^hom we see the Kenezzite descendants of Bela, son of Beor. Then Hanuman,
Sugriva's son, joins him with his monkey host and carries Rama and his followers safely over Adam's bridge into the kingdom of Ravana. The giant falls in battle and the hero wins back his bride. The Cecropian name Sugriva, which gives the Hebrew^ Gficrabbi and such words as scorpion, scarabaeus, and crab, belongs to the Japhetic Geker, head of the Ekronites or Gekronites who named Maaleh Acrabbim, and were the scorpion men of Chaldean antiquity. The legend that a scorpion stung Orion to death doubtless finds its explanation in the connection of Anub
with this family of Japhetic mercenaries. The old Greek traditions make Cecrops, the first Athenian king, a native of Sais in Egypt, which was close to Xois in the Delta. The worship of Zobebah in Ekron as Baal Zebub, who as Zeus Apomyius, or the driver away of flies, received honours in Elis and elsewhere in Greece, but the wood for whose sacrifice had to be brought from the banks of the Acheron, shows that her brother Anub must have been in league with the Ekronite family.

Harum or Arimus as the chief of the monkeys. Thus the story of Rama defines the nature of the Egyptian struggle as one between the Kenezzites or Sekenens of Elephantine and the Ammono-Jahdaite family, of which the youthful Jabez was now the head. The Singhalese have a strange story about Harum. Priya, daughter of Amba the Okkaka, was stricken with white leprosy, on account of which she was carried out of the city of Kapilaand established in a large cave dug in the forest near a river, with provisions and fuel and other things necessary. Rama the king of Benares, being smitten with the same disease, withdrew from
his kingdom, intending to die in some cavern, atid by accident
strayed into the forest in which Priya lived her lonely life. But the king, overtaken by hunger, ate voraciously of the fruit, and even of the leaves, bark and root of a tree, which made him free
from the disease and " pure as a statue of gold." Life now became valuable, and to preserve it from the tigers that roamed abroad and made night hideous with their roaring, he made a ladder and climbed into a lofty kolom tree with a hollow trunk There he dwelt, supporting himself with the remains of the forest animals slain by the tigers. One morning a tiger scented the
princess in her cave and scratched the earth vigorously to get at her, whereupon she screamed and the tiger fled. Rama heard the cry from his tree, and descending, introduced himself and
offered to release the captive. When she declined to come forth on account of her disease, he brought her the healing medicine from the tree that had cured him ; at once she was restored to health, and, leaving the cave, took up her abode in the kolom tree. There thirty-two children were born to them before Rama's son found his father's abode and besought him to return to his kingdom of Benares. But Rama was pleased to stay where he was, so his son caused a city to be built in the forest which was called Koli after the kolom tree in which the exiled pair had lived so long. When, however, the thirty-two sons of Rama sought in marriage the thirty-two princesses of Kapilawastu, their mother's nieces, her brothers refused to allow their daughters to marry tree men and grossly insulted the Koli
family. Nevertheless, the sons of Rama carried off the princesses

on one occasion when the}'' went out of the city ostensibly to
bathe, and the kings of Kapilawastu had to swallow their indignation as best they were able.^^ This legend is valuable, not only as linking Harum with a daughter of Anub, in Rama, husband of Amba's daughter Priya, but also in explaining the wooden men and pith women of the Quiche story of Hurakan, which shows double connection with the Arabian story of the Adites in the account of their destruction and of the transforma
tion of the survivors into monkeys. The Quiches, it is to be remembered, are the descendants of Coz through his son Anub or Hunab. The same association of the Adites with wood appears in the legend of Cybele, who changed her murdered lover Atys into a pine tree,^^ The explanation is philological, and appears in the Khitan words for tree and wood ; Lesghian, hueta ; Circassian, adj ; Basque, haitz ; Yeniseian, atsch ; Koriak, utut, uttuii ; Kamtchatdale, uuda, utha ; Choctaw, iti ; and Aztec, quahuit. Thus the Jahdaites are wooden men or the men of the
tree. Harum's memorials are everywhere. He is the Lydian king Hermon, who is said to have founded Adramyttium, and after whom the river Hermus was called. The Arabian dyke of Arim and gardens of Irem bear his name. The monkey and Typhonian Arirrii of Asia Minor and Italy were originally his descendants. The Greeks made Kapha his father instead of his mother's second husband, and, calling him Hermion son of Europs, represented him as the builder of Hermione. As the head of the Armenian line after Thargamos, so highly was he esteemed and so many achievements were related of him that he had to be repeated as Armenaeus, Aramaeus, Harma, and Aramus, and his exploits were divided among these mythic ancestors of the royal family of Armenia.^^ In Irish history he is well defined as Heremon the father of Irial, but wrongly called the son of Milesius or Ma Reshah. Yet Heber, called his brother, is probably Hebron, Ma Reshah's son. The story of the two TuUias appears in the Irish narrative with variations. In the Latin

story Servius Tullius married his ambitious daughter to the peaceful Aruns and his gentle one to the aspiring Lucius Tarquinius. But, like drawing to like through love of power, the ambitious and turbulent ones put their. mild tempered consorts to
death, killed Servius, and filled the kingdom with strife and bloodshed. The Irish story is briefly summed up by the rhyming' chronicler whose muse does not breathe Ossianic fire :

" The royal princes, Heber and Heremon, With mutual consent and kind affection. The isle divided ; and they reigrned in peace, Till the ambition of a woman's heart, The wife of Heber, urged them on to war. By jmde o'ercome she thirsted to enjoy. And to be called the Queen of the Three Vales, The most delightful lands in all the isle. She vowed, and raging passionately, swore That she would never sleep on Irish ground Till she was mistress of those fruitful plains. A battle followed on Geisiol's fatal field,
Where Heber Fionn fell a sacrifice • To the ambition of a haughty wife."*
Heremon reigned fourteen years over all Ireland, fought unnumbered battles and drove out the Picts, Brigantes, and Tuatha de « Danans. His being made the son of that incomparable warrior Milesius or MaReshah,andhis appearing as Hernion and Arimus with Meles in Lydian history, as well as the mention of his name in the Persian annals as Aramin, brother of Arish, show that Naram-Sin did not conquer Ris-Vul of Apirak or Avaris, but united his forces with those of Zobebah's faithful friend and warrior against the insurgent Zerethites, Kenites, Kenezzites,
Amalekites, and the Horite princes of Egypt

CHAPTER XIII.
The Hittites at the Tigris and Euphrates (Concluded).
The history of Babylonia is somewhat intricate in the time of Harura. At the death of his father Eegem, the widow of that monarch and mother of Harum married Beth-Rapha, the eldest son of the Achashtarite Eshton, who through her established a claim to the kingdom of her father Urukh. No monument expressly states this fact, but many traditions imply it. The clue is given in the assertion of Diodorus that Lapithus, who has been shown to be this Kapha, married Orsinome or the widow of Arsinous, who was the daughter of Eurynome ; and Eurynome is Atargatis or Jerigoth, the wife of Hur or Urukh, and mother of Azubah. In the Babylonian list, Azagbau- immediately follows Sargon and immediately precedes Hammurabi ; hence Mr. George Smith supposed that, while Azagbau was the last of the line of Sargon, Hammurabi was related to her by marriage. In Arabian tradition Lokman has a vulture Lubad which recalls the Simurgh, descended as Samlah from Kapha, and whose name reproduces Lapithus. It is the Harpy also, and Tarapyha, the chief god of the Esthonians, whose form was that of a gigantic bird.^ This vulture Lubad is the same as Yarub, called the son of Kahtan, instead of Eshton, who overthrew the line of Lokman. As Europs, he erroneously precedes Telchin in the Sicyonian list of royal names, and as erroneously yet suggestively is made the father of Hermion. The story of Hammurabi or Beth-Kapha has
already been sufficiently illustrated. The chief event of his
reign was a victory over his step-son Harum :

" Month Sabadu 22nd day in the year when Hammurabi the king in the service of Ann and Bel triumphantly marched, and the lord of Elam and King Kim-agu he overthrew." *
I Malte Brun, Geog. vol. vi. * Records of the Past, v. 70.



110 THE HITTITES.
This king made Dindiir or Babili, that is Babylon, his capital, and there set up the worship of Baal Peor under the name of Merodach, thus allying himself with Beor's descendants, the Hittite kings of Elephantine in Egypt. Only ten years of his reign are recorded, but it must have been one of extraordinary activity in warlike expeditions, building, and improvement of the
country. The following inscription illustrates the work performed by him :

" Hammurabi the powerful king, king of Babylon, the king renowned through the four races, conqueror of the enemies of Maruduk, the ruler, the delight of the heart am I. When Anu and Bel the people of Sumir and Akkad to my dominion gave, powerful adversaries into my hand they delivered. The river Hammurabi the delight of men, flowing waters giving pleasure to the people of Sumir and Akkad I excavated. The whole of its banks to its course I restored
;
the entire channel I filled, perennial waters
for the people of Sumir and Akkad I established. The people of Sumir and Akkad their chief men I gathered, authority and possessions I established to them, delight and pleasure I spread out to them, in luxurious seats I seated them. Then I, Hammurabi, the powerful kinp;
blessed by the great gods, with the powerful forces which Maruduk gave me, a great wall with much earth,
its top like a mountain raised,
along the river Hammurabi the delight of men I made."-* This ancestor of the Lapps, and divine Ra\ya of all the northern
Ugrians, was a man of much spirit, and, in some respects, of great enlightenment ; but the proofs of his zeal in establishing one of
the most detestable idolatries and in promoting human sacrifices
are so indubitable, that his name must descend as that of an

enemy of mankind, in spite of all the blandishments by which he sought to win over the captive people of Sumir and Akkad to his sway. Of his successor Samsu Iluna, already set forth as Samlah of Masrekah among the kings that" reigned in Edom, nothing of any consequence is recorded. In Irish history, on the other hand, Orbha, called by mistake a son of Heber Fionn, and made a successor of Heremon, is dismissed in a single line, it
being simply stated that he and three of his brothers were killed by Heremon's son Irial. But Samlah is called Conmaol, and made another son of Heber. He killed Eithrial the son of Irial, and governed Ireland thirty years, being the first absolute monarch of the line of Heber. He was engaged all these years in contests with the descendants of Heremon, and at length lost his life by the hands of Heber the son of Tighermhas, who placed his father on the throne. The Irish annals mention a son of Conmaol, namely, Eochaidh Faobharglas, who made Albin tributary, and had troubles with the Heremonians, by whom he was killed after a reign of twenty years. Eochaidh in the Kenite list is Ishhod or Aishhod, the son of Hammoleketh or the Queen, who was the sister of Gilead.^ By the union of Samlah with this queen, the line of Sumir or Zimri was allied with that of Kapha.
In the lists of Ctesias his name may be found as Ascatades, while that of his youngest brother, Mahalah or Maehalah, is represented by Mancalius, and that of Machalah's eldest son Heman, by Amyntes. The second of the three brothers was Abiezer or Abigezer, whom the Arabs call Abou Gayar, rightly making him the father of Maouna or Meonothai.^ The old alliance with the
Ethnanites, Belaites, or Kenezzites, was ratified by his marriage with Hathath the daughter of Othniel, by whom he became the father of Meonothai, the first Amenhotep. Ophrah the son of Meonothai gave his name to a region in Canaan known as Ophrah of the Abiezrites. Gideon, the judge of Israel, was an Abiezrite, but whether by residence or by descent remains to be
determined. It is remarkable that the inscriptions relating to Samsu-iluna make no mention of this queen, and that the Irish annals are silent regarding her. In Lydian history she is called
* 1 Chron, vii. 18. s Tabari, 210.



112 THE HITTITES.
Omphale the daughter of Jardaues. Herodotus says that the Assyrians called Urania by the name Mylitta, but it is hard to determine the place of this queen in the cuneiform records.*' Moleketh should be a purely Babylonian divinity, for the male form of the name Melcartus was adored at the corresponding Byblus in Phoenicia. The Greeks preserved her name as Ino Leucothea and gave her a son Melicerta, but made her husband Athamas or the Kenite Etam, a relation which they intensified by calling her the daughter of Cadmus, who is the same Etam or Getam. Now there is no evidence that she was in any way connected with the Horite family of Etam ; but Mount Carmel, where her husband Samlah, the Lydian Tmolus or Carmanorius, was worshipped as Carmelus, was in the neighbourhood of Jezreel named after the son of EtamJ Similar confusion reigns in the story of Meleager, who is another Melicerta and Melcartus. His mother Althaea may be taken as an Alytta form of Mylitta, but his father GCneus is a myth, and Calydon, of which he was king, bears the name of Gilead the brother of Moleketh. As the wife of Samlah was Moleketh, he must have been known as Moloch, a god whose bloody sacrifices agree with the sanguinary rites that originated the stories of the Simurgh and Stymphalides. Thus the Ugrian Jumala and Ammonian Moloch are the same deity. Ctesias' mention of Ascatades, Mancaleus, and Amyntes as oriental monarchs in the line of Ninus and Belus, shows that, while Abiezer found a throne in Elephantine, his elder brother Ishhod and his younger brother Machalah reigned in Babylon, and that the latter was followed by his eldest son Heman, who is celebrated along with his brothers, Chalcol and Darda or Dardag as only inferior to Solomon in point of wisdom.^ There is a strong temptation to identify Ishhod with Sin-Gasit, the Sin-Sada of Sir Henry Rawlinson, seeing that he had for mother BelatSunat, but the fact that he was the king of Amnanu, a name that does not appear until five generations after Abiezer, opposes the connection of the two names. In the Babylonian list Samsuiluna is followed by Ebisum, Ammi-satana, Kimtum-kittum or
« Herodot. i. 131. 7 It will yet appear that her son Mahalah was related to the Getamites. " 1 Kinjrs IV. 31.



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 113
Amini-saduga, and Samsu-satana. Buddhist tradition preserves the names, but in great confusion, for Upachara or Abiezer is made the father of Chetiya or Ishhod, the builder of Hastipura and the first liar, and he again is made the father of Muchala or
Machalah, who reigned in righteousness.^ The descendants of Abiezer are also well defined as the people of Abhisara, whom the Raja Tarangini always unites with those of Darva in the south of Cashmere. The classical geographers and Arrian mention the country of Abisarus situated in the same direction, thus giving to the king the name of his people. In so-called Indian mythology the Abiezrites are the Apsaras-as, or water nymphs, to whom Urvasi, the wife of Paruravas, the Indian Orpheus or Rawa,
belonged. Vasishtha was born from the soul of Urvasi, sat down
by the Apsaras, and led the tribes of the Tritsus. In India the sons of Hammoleketh find solid ground, for Vasishtha is Ishhod, and the Tritsus are the descendants of Dardag, the youngest son of Mahol or Machalah, while their connection with the Apsaras and Urvasi completes their identification with the family of Beth Rapha.^" In the west all the names of this family cluster about the Libya Palus in the Roman province of Africa, from Gemellae or Samlah to Tritonis or Dardag. Mr. Robert Brown, jr., has set forth the connection of Po Seidon, who is Eshton, the father of Rapha, with the water-loving Tritons that represent the Sanscrit Tritsus.^^ In Sanscrit story, Ishhod, whom Homer knew simply as that Melchizedek-like person, the old Aesyetes, is a personage of great importance. Yet it is hard to glean history from it, as
it sets forth a caste of priestly poets and wise men rather than
the life of an individual. The Rig Veda contains the following passage regarding the Vasishthas :-
" The white robed priests, with hair knots on the right stimu
lating to devotion, have filled me with delight. Rising from the
sacrificial grass I call to the men, ' Let not the Vasishthas stand too far off to suQCOur me.' By their libation they brought Indra hither from afar across the Vaisanta, away from the powerful draught. Indra preferred the Vasishthas to the soma offered by

Pasadyumna, the son of Vayata. So, too, with them he crossed the river ; so, too, With them he slew Bheda ; so, too, in the battle of the ten kings, Indra delivered Sudas through your prayer, O Vasishthas. Through gratification, caused by the prayer of your
fathers, O men, ye do not obstruct the undecaying axle since at the recitation of the Sakvari verses, with a loud voice ye have infused energy into Indra, O Vasishthas. Distressed when sur
rounded in the fight by the ten kings, they looked up like thirsty men to the sky. Indra heard Vasishtha when he uttered praise and opened up a wide space for the Tritsus. Like staves for.
driving cattle, the contemptible fiharatas were lopped all round. Vasishtha marched in front and then the tribes of the Tritsus were deployed. Three are the noble creatures whom light precedes. Three fires attend the dawn. All these the Vasishthas know. Their lustre is like the full radiance of the sun ; their
greatness is like the depth of the ocean ; like the swiftness of the wind your hymn, O Vasishthas, can be followed by no one else."^* The mention of the Bharatas in this hymn, as the enemies of Indra and of the Vasishthas and Tritsus, shows that the contest referred to is the one occupying the reign of Snmlah of Masrekah, for then only were the men of Gedor, whose deity was Jether or Indra, in league with the house of Rapha against the Beerothites. The white robed priests are the Druids thus attired, who accompanied to battle Gwenddoleu, the lord of the cannibal birds, and afterwards cursed the name of Gall Power, who put an end to their ravages. The very name Druid or Derwydd originated with Darda, the son of Mahalah. But what is still more interesting is the fact vouched for by several traditions, that the
Orphic family, to which Darda belonged, was one that gave birth to the most celebrated early poets claimed by the Greeks, including Homer, Hesiod, and Tyrtaeus. On their mother's side,
Ishhod, Abiezer, and Mahalah, were Zimrites. The name of their ancestor, Zimran, is derived from the Hebrew . root, zamar, to sing, fit name for a family of poets, and this in Gaelic became amh'ra, amhran, & poem or song. These Zimri, Sumerians, or Amhrans, were the Homeridae, who made their home in the island of Chios, but dwelt also in Smyrna, a Cimmerian city,
!• Muir's Sanncrit Texts.



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 115
that more perfectly retains the name of Zimran. There Homer is said to have been born, the son of Meles and Critheis, at the time when Theseus, the son of Eumelus, reigned over the city.
Hesiod is, in some traditions, made a relative of Homer, or a member of the same family, and his uncommon name marks Him as pertaining to the lino in which Ishhod appears, and as inheriting the traditions of the poetic Vasishtha. Of Tyrtaeus, the Aphidnian, who encouraged the Spartan army in its contest with Aristomenes of Messenia. no particulars have descended, but his name and office stamp him as one of the Tritsus, a Dardag •descended from Mahol. By poets of the same race the Kalewala and Kalewipoeg must have been written. And it seems that the 88th and 89th Psalms were translations and adaptations of poems originally composed by the Orphic family, that included Heman and Ethan, or compositions by members of that family who had become converts to the Hebrew faith. The Semitic root sachal has the meaning of putting across as well as of instructing, so that the mysterious word Maschil, prefixed to many psalms, may denote a translation. The bards were not free from misfortune, for Meholah, the father of the wise Heman, Chalcol, and Dardag, gave his name to Abel Meholah in the plain of Samaria and north-west of Abiezer.^^ This, like Abel Mizraim, in the south, was a place of mourning, the mourning of Meholah. A tragic
story must have given rise to this name, and this story is the one with which the name of Tmolus is associated by Clytophon, and which was given in connection with the history of Samlah. A somewhat similar narrative is that of Milo of Epirus, who gave Laodamia, the last of the Epirote royal family, her death wound in the temple of Diana, whither she had fled as to an asylum. He was seized with madness and, tearing out his own bowels, died in agony ; and plagues fell upon the whole land. Meilanion again and Atalanta, while hunting in Calydon, profaned the sacred enclosure of Jove, and were for this transformed into lions. Meilanion seems to be the same person as Meleager of Calydon whose history is linked with that of Atalanta. His mother, Althaea, burned the billet of wood on which his life depended, and he perished under her curse. The story of Meilanion and
13 Judges vii. 22,



116 THE HITTITES.
Atalanta answers perfectly to that of Melanippus, son of Ares
and Tritia, and Comaetho, the daughter of Pterelaus, the temple
of Diana or Artemis taking the place of the enclosure of Jove.
A curse fell on the country, the guilty parties were immolated, and human sacrifices instituted to avert the anger of the goddess. Oth§r persons named Melanippus were the sons of Hicetaon, Astacus, and Agrius. Meilichos, and other rivers similarly named, attend Melanippus and the characters identified with his tragic
story, recalling the Nahar Malcha of Babylonia. The statement of Apollodorus that Comaetho was the
daughter of Pterelaus, taken along with the story of Melanippus in Pausanias, sheds light on Chaldean history, although it leaves
us in doubt as to the precise calamity that called for the mourning of Meholah. Pterelaus and Kurigalzu of the Babylonian records are the same name, originating in the word that furnishes the Babylonian ge9graphical term, Zerghul. That
word is Jezreel, or, as it may be read, Yezregel. Now Jezreel was the son of Etam, and he is the Athamas who is made the father of Meleager by Ino Leucothea, and, as Getam, the Cadmus
who is the father of that princess. Atalanta, connected with Meilanion and Meleager and Camulus, was the daughter of Schoenus, the son of Athamas. Meilanion again is the son of Amphidamas or Abi Etam. Even Milo was the son of Diotimus. It thus appears that the Cadmonites of Etam had established themselves in Babylonia, and that the first Kurigalzu of the lists and monuments was Jezreelj the son of Etam. This family must, therefore, have left its seat in the wilderness of Etam, on
the north-eastern border of Egypt, accompanying the allied Peletites to their wars on the banksof the Euphrates; and Milisihu, son of Kurigulzu, must be Meholah, the son-in-law of Jezreel or Yetsregel." The synchronism of the lines of Etam and Kapha is hard to establish, for the latter married Regem's widow, while Pelet, the brother of Regem, married Zelelponi, the daughter of Etam. Thus Jezreel or Yetsregel is the Indian Satrugna, the contemporary of Regem and Pelet, while Mahalah seems to be some generations later. Yet Abiezer married Hathath, the daughter of Othniel the Keuezzite, and after his death she was
'« Records of the Past, v, 79.



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 117
united to Mesha the sou of Jabez. With Jabez, Samlah must have been contemporary, for, among the Kings of Edom or Gebalene, he alone occurs between Hadad and Saul, and Saul, as Osortasen III., can only have taken possession of Lower Egypt
at the death of the great worshipper of Sutekh. It is certain that Mahalah was allied with the family of Etam, . for he only can be the Amyclas who occupies one of the most prominent
places in the Spartan genealogies."^^ He is made the father of Harpalus, and grandfather of Deritus. But in Greece the homes of the aboriginal members of his family were traditionally, perhaps actually, Thessaly and Euboea. In the former, Hestiaeotis was named after Ishhod and inhabited by Perrhoebians. In Euboea which bore the name Ellopia, Histiaea was situated, and from that city Amphiclus is said to have migrated to Chios, there to
reign after the sons of CEnopion.^"^ Ishhod's name is also given
as that of the Arcadian Hicetas, whose father, Aristocrates, was guilty of the same outrage as Tmolus, his victim being the virgin priestess of Artemis Hymnia. He was stoned to death
for this crime, and a second Aristocrates, the son of Hicetas, met
the same fate.^^ The name Aristocrates seems foreign to the history, but Hymnia connects with it in Heman, the eldest son
of Mahalah. It is also evident that the w(Jrds Hestiaeotis,
Histiaea, Hicetas, are related to Hestia or Vesta, rendering it
probable that the Vestals were instituted by Ishhod, the Sanscrit Vasishtha, and that the crime which led to the mourning of Meholah, was committed against a member of this new sisterhood. Such Vestals celebrated the rites of the Babylonian Mylitta or Sacti, who is Moleketh. They kept alive the sacred fire which was the only emblem of divinity in their round temples. Now the land of fire in the Zend Avesta is Sughda or Sogdiana, and Sughda is the Algonquin skute, fire. But the
Algonquin dialects, by the use of prepositions and other grammatical as well as lexical peculiarities, are separated from the Khitan languages proper, although they in all respects show connection with the Maya-Quiche group of Central America, whose
15 The Spartoi, or men sown by Cadmus, are the Jezreelim, or sown of God. 1® Pausanias. 1' Pausanias.



118 THE HITTITES.
peculiarities, by the traditions of the Quiches, are proved to be the result of Semitic influence. The languages of the Old World, with which the preposing dialects of the New have the closest affinities, are those of the Malay Archipelago, and the very name Malacca is a memorial of Moleketh, the larger part of whose family in eastward migration followed the southern littoral and oceanic route taken by the descendants of Coz. The statement of Pausanias, that Amphiclus reigned in Chios after the sons of CEnopion, points to an ancient connection of the two
families. The original Hittite word for fire seems to have been 8U, which is the present Basque and Lesghian form, but the Yeniseian is chott, the Iroquois otaia and ojista, the Shoshonese ahawat, and the Peruvian Sapibocono cuAti, which resembles the Algonquin skute. The Vestals allowed the sacred fire to die away at the end of the year, but, if extinguished at any other time, it portended evil to the city or state in which the worship was observed. The story of Althaea consuming the billet on which Meleager's life depended seems to have some connection with this law. The sisters of Meleager were transformed, on account of their mourning for his death, into meleagrldes, guinea fowls or turkeys. The Algonquin Delawares or Lenni Lenape have a sub-tribe called Unalachtigo or the Turkey clan. Meleager and Unalachtigo are related to the Malayan marak, a peacock, and to nialk, a common Malayo Polynesian name for a fowl. The oceanic route of the Lenni Lenape, Illinois, and other Algonquins, who call themselves ilenni or men, is well marked in
Borneo and the adjacent islands Vjy the presence of the Illinoans.
These semitized and oceanic Hitlites seriously complicate the problem of Khitan migration, and should properly have a treatise
for themselves. Many of their divinities and of their traditions,
especially those glorifying the rabbit or hare, are the same as those of the northern and continental Hittites of pure speech, but others are borrowed like their language, or have grown up,
as has their conception of an insular heaven, out of their altered
conditions of life. In character, occupations and arts, there is a
radical distinction between the two Hittite streams which so marvellously converged in the New World. Seinin, the eleventh Japanese emperor, placed his daughter



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 119
under the name of Saikou at the head of a college of Vestals instituted by him.^^ The Natchez, who, like the Japanese and the Hurons, regarded their king or head chief as the son of the Sun, are said to have had in ancient times a body of Vestals who kept up a perpetual fire in a round or oval temple.^^ That they did, in common with all the Mobilian tribes, maintain such
a fire in such a temple is incontestible, but confirmatory evidence
of the existence of a class of virgin priestesses is wanting. Charlevoix and Chateaubriand have, however, placed on record the fact that, by command of the Sun, the women of the Natchez
were compelled at least once in their lives to prostitute themselves, as Herodotus says the Babylonian women did in honour of Mylitta.2" There were Vestals also in Mexico, part of whose duty it was to replenish the perpetual incense burner in the
temple. Failing to keep their vow of chastity their fate was
death. They seem first to have come into existence in the reign of Nauhyotl in Tollan. Wishing to supersede the worship of Quetzalcoatl, he established that of Matlalcueye, an aquatic goddess called the lady of the frogs, to whom human victims
were offered. It is not stated that a company of Vestals was instituted in her honour, but a subsequent part of Mexican history attests that fact and points to the infamies of the Babylonian Mylitta : " The Tlamacazqui, violating the laws of continence under which they were bound, proved foremost in vice, and the Vestals, guardians of the sacred fire, became generally
the first victims of their brutality. Matters came to such a pass
that the princess Cihuaquaquil, chief priestess of the goddess of the waters (Matlalcueye), having left Tollan on a pilgrimage to
the temple of Ce Acatl at Cholullan, allowed herself to be sought publicly, even in the sanctuary, by the Tlachiach Texpolcaltzin, pontiff of Quetzalcohuatl, and bound like her by inviolable vows to sacerdotal continence." ^i Her son, Ichcatl, became the head of a hereditary priesthood. This seems to be a very ancient story, for the goddess Matlalcueye, and the hereditary priest

120 THE HITTITES.
Ichcatl, look not unlike Molecheth and Ishhod, while the conduct
of the priest and priestess corresponds with that set forth in the
traditions illustrating the mourning of Meholah,and the universal
licence it exemplities agrees with the abominations of Babylon. The Peruvians also had Vestals who were called the brides of the Sun. In one convent in Cuzco there were a thousand virgins of royal blood. Their vows were perpetual, and if they broke them they were buried alive, yet if any had a child it was saved and devoted to the priesthood. Their chief work was the preparation of certain kinds of food for the Inca and his court and of royal and sacredotal raiment. It is not stated that they maintained the annual fire, although it is very probable that they did so, for the manner of lighting that fire at the vernal equinox by concentrating the suns' rays, collected by a concave burnished metal mirror upon a heap of dry cotton, corresponds with that which Plutarch attributes to Numa Pompilius."- The Peruvians, like the Mexicans, ottered human victims to the Sun. In Italy, Numa Pompilius has the honour assigned him of establishing the worship of Vesta by the virgins, but another name connected
with them is that of Caecilius Metellus, who is .said to have
precipitated himself, on Che occasion of the burning of their
temple, into the flames to save the sacred relics. So the Natchez preserved the names of certain women who, in a similar con
flagration, cast their children into the fire to appease the anger
of the god.** The name of Caecilius Metellus is suspiciou.sly like Chalcol of Mahalah. Sir Henry Rawlinson finds Khalkhalla, the complete form of Chalcol, as a name of the Assyrian
god Ninip.2* Returning to the Akkadian family whom Hammurabi had deprived of the kingdom, we find a contemporary of Naram-Sin or Harum in Sin-Idinna, the son of Gasin, who, according to Mr. George Smith, is by the character of his legends closely connected with Rim-Agu.25 The father, Gasin, is Geshan the brother of Regem, but his posterity is not mentioned in the Keuite list

Ges^ian was the name of Goshen iu Egypt, and of a region similarly designated in southern Palestine."^ Sin-Idinna, then, ^ust have been a son of the lord of Goshen who joined the
fortunes of his uncle Regem in the east. He calls himself the nourisher of Ur, King of Larsa, and of Sumir and Akkad. Like Hammurabi, he excavated a river which he called Kibigana, and built Bit Parra. He also celebrated the festivals of Ur and Samas in Bit Parra and Bit Nergal. The name of his river, Kibigana, is that of the Amorite family, Gibeon or Gibegon, the head of which, an Ebalian, was Zibeon or Zibegon, the father of that Ajah or Akki the Abal who took care of young Sargon, when his grand-daughter, Timna, deserted the child. Esau was connected with the same family, having married the daughter of Zibeon's second son, Anah, namely Aholibamah.^^ The story of Esau's family is found in many lands, on account of his relation by marriage with the Hittite, Horite, and Ishmaelite stocks. The mention of Bit Nergal as a place where Ur was worshipped brings forward the name of the son of Harum, Rim-Agu, or Naram Sin, who was Acharchel, the original Hercules. The
difficulties in the way of tracing the history of Aharhel are
numerous. Transferred to different countries and transliterated in different languages, the name Acharchel was confounded with those of Yetsregel and Asareel. In languages such as the Egyptian, which make no disfjnction between I and r, and in others that, like the Japanese, have no I, or, like the Choctaw and Aztec, have no r, it is confounded with Chalcol and Karkar. In Greece the tendency was to attri bute to Hercules the acts of every great warrior of the early days of the world's history, attributing to him among others those of his father Harum. In India, on the other hand, Rama was the favourite, absorbing
into his romantic career the exploits of his father, Regem, and his son, Aharhel. One thing that is certainly known regarding this hero is that he was counted among the Hycsos of Egypt, for in the two versions of Manetho's Shepherd Kings he appears in immediate proximity to Apophis, in one case preceding, and, in the other, following that monarch. The reconciliation of the
2*> Joshua X. 41. 27 Genesis xxxvi. 2, 18.



122 THE HITTITES.
discrepancy is to be found in the fact that this Archies lived in the reign of Jabez, but, as the latter was on the throne when he was born, his name preceded that of his second cousin, and, as he survived the hero, his name followed that of Archies. Manetho calls his ninth and tenth dynasties Heracleopolitan, but only mentions one name of a Pharaoh, that of Achthoes, who
has been sufficiently identified with the Hittite Jachdai. There
were two Egyptian cities called Heracleopolis, one surnamed Magna, to the south of Lake Moeris ; the other called Parva and Sethrum on the Mediterraneam coast near Avaris and Pelusium. Avaris wtis the Epirus of Homer where the cruel King Echetus cut off men's noses and ears. It marked the western boundary of the Lydian sub-kingdom of Mareshah, while the Arish limited it on the east. At the Arish was Rhinocolura, or the nose-docked, a city in which Diodorus says that Actisanes, whom Strabo calls some Ethiopian, settled the malefactors whose noses he had cut off, trusting that shame of their personal appearance would prevent their return to Egypt. It would appear, there
fore, that Aharhel exercised sovereignty over the region in the Sethroitic nome in which his great grandfather, Jachdai, had
first established himself, the right of Regem as the eldest son of Jachdai being thus acknowledged. To the west of this domain was the Xoite kingdom founded by Coz, or his son Anub, Aharhel's maternal grandfather. And, in whichever Heracleopolis, the SOD of Harum made his abode, he was in the immediate vicinity of the family of Ma Resha, represented equally by the Arish in the north-east, and by Lake Moeris in Central Egypt. That there was, therefore, an actual Lydian d3'nasty of the Heraclidae is most probable. One would have expected the name of Acharchel to appear in the Armenian lists in connection with Armenac, but Armenian history branches off into the story of the dominant Egyptian line of Paiapis, Meesak and Manavazus.^ The Irish annals are clearest upon this line. They make the
mistake of representing Harum or Heremon as a son of Milesius,. who is Ma Reshah, and the husband of Tea, daughter of Lughaidh, who is Lagadnh or Laadah, Ma Reshah's father, but these errors do not obscure the actual fact of a connection
» Kings of Aimenia, 12, 20.



THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 123
between the Lydian family and that of Harum and Aharhel. They are right, however, in calling the son of Heremon, Irial or Irial Faidh. He is said to have been a learned prince and a prophet who could foretell things to come. He overthrew Orbha and his brothers, who had basely taken away the lives of two of his elder brothers that died without issue. In his reign the land
was cleared for cultivation, rivers were opened up, and seven
royal palaces built. He gained four great victories ; the first was the battle of Ard Inmath at Teabtha, where Stirne, son of Duibh, son of Fomhoir, was slain ; the second battle was Teanm
huighe, where Eichtghe, the leader of the Fomhoraice, fell ; the third was Loch Muighe which witnessed the death of, Lugrot, the son of Moghfeibhis ; and in the fourth at Cuill Murtho he overcame the four sons of Heber. Eithrial, who succeeded Irial,
being his son, who cleared more land, wrote history, was remarkable for his valour and military accomplishments, and was killed
by Conmaol, is probably, almost certainly, a repetition of Irial.^^ The Greek story of the historical Hercules is altogether astray when it makes him a descendant of Perseus, as the son of Amphitryon and Alcmena. If that parentage suits any hero worthy the Herculean name it must be Shimon, the Sem Hercules perhaps of the Egyptians, the son of Hadar the Beerothite and Mehetabel the sister of Beriah, in which case Amphitryon will be a corruption of the word Mithra, derived from the name of Matred, Mehetabel's mother, and Electryon, the name of Alcmena's father, will go back to Elgadah the father of Tahath II., Hatred's husband. Eurystheus, the son of Sthenelus, to whom Hercules was subject, should be Beriah himself, but
Sthenelus, the name of his father, is a Greek transliteration of Otbniel or Gothniel of the Elephantine kingdom, whose successor, Seti Menephthah, drove out the family of Shimon. There is one name, however, connected with the story of the infancy of Hercules that does not belong to the time of Shimon, and that is Iphicles, by which his twin brother of mortal parentage is called. When Juno sent two serpents to devour the children, and Iphicles alarmed the household with his cries, the infant Hercules

took one in each hand and strangled the monsters. This fabulous trait associates him with Krishna, who, when the demon Putana sought to kill the babe with her poisonous breast, drained her of life. Creuzer and Guigniaut have pointed out distinct connections of Hermes and Hercules in mythology, but these are apart from the traditional account of the latter hero. Diodorus, however, states that when Osiris went forth on his warlike
expeditions, he left to Isis as her counsellor, Hermes, the wisest
and most faithful of his friends, and, as the general of her troops,
his relative, Hercules.'* The two names were associated as Hermeracles, to denote the pillars of stone generally called by that of Hermes. The Latin Mercurius, taken to represent the Greek Hermes, really denoted his son, the Mehercules, invoked in Roman oaths, whose name became Mehercures or Mercury, for the initial Me is the honorific particle, meaning honourable and sublime. Mehercul answers also to the Chaldean Nergal, and explains such names as the Palestinian Maralah or Margalah, the Caucasian Marul, Mergul, and Mingrelia, and the Ligurian Merula. In the Synchronous History of Assyria and Babylonia the names of father and son are combined to form the geographical term Arman-Agarsal.*^ Elsewhere Agarsal appears alone
or with Istar, as in Car-Istar- Agarsal. The early dates of these names, and the mention of Bit Nergal in the inscriptions of RimAgu and Sin Idinna, indicate that Aharhel exercised sovereignty
in Babylonia, but the links that should associate him with Harum as Naram Sin and Rim Agu have.not yet come to light. There is a Kurigalzu, who may represent him, but he calls himself the son of Burna-Buryas which Aharhel can hardly have been. His worship of Bel and Merodach is inconsistent with the prophetic character claimed for him in the Irish annals. Yet he was King of Sumir and Akkad and of the four races.^* After him a break occurs in Babylonian history. Ctesias places him early among his Assyrian Kings as Aralius, the son of Arius. In Persian history he is supplanted by Saul or Zaul, the son of Saum, the son of Nariman, which Nariman is Naram-Sin, and

THE HITTITES AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 125
the same as the Persian Aramin, brother of Kai Kous and Arish.
The story of Aharhel receives some light from Lydian tradition which mentions the dynasty of the Heraclidae, taken in connec
tion with the Greek account of the historical Heraclidae, who reconquered Peloponnesus. According to Herodotus the first Heraclid monarch of Lydia was Agron, son of Ninus, of Belus, of Alcaeus, of Hercules.^* This is confusion worse confounded, for the Assyrian Ninus and Belus belong to the Ethnanites, and the mythic Alcaeus is made Hercules' grandfather. Yet Agron is a name of much importance, for it introduces an Aryan or Japhetic element into Hittite history. Agron is the same word as the Hebrew Ekron, denoting the city of the Philistines named after Eker or Geker, who also gave his name to Acrabbi or Gecrabbi. Hence the Memphite Necherophis of Manetho, and Uchoreus, of Diodorus, the Athenian Cecrops, the Lydian Agron, and Indian Sugriva, are this ancient Eker, father of the Carians, known also as Agrius, Car, Carus, Carnus, and Caranus. Already his family has appeared in connection with the Cozites as borrowing from them the deity Baal Zebub, who, as the god of flies, was also worshipped in Gyrene named after Ekron, and in the Grecian Elis and'Epirus, each of which possessed a river Acheron."^^ Eker himself was a generation older than Chedorlaomer, and was thus the contemporary of Abram's early years. No history gives a complete record of his family, but that family is well
identified with the Buzites, to whom Barachel, the father of Elihu, Job's friend, belonged.^^ He was of the kindred of Ram, for Ram was the father of Maaz, Jamin, and Eker, and the son of the ancestral Jerachmeel.^'^ Nine generations from Eker are given in the Kenite record, the chief names in which are Buz the
first and Abihail or Abichail the eighth, who is the father of Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jachan, Zia and Heber.^^ Wherever in ancient geographical nomenclature Geker, Buz, and Abichail are found, there also Acharchel appears, and the

connected Harum. It is evident, therefore, that Acharchel must have married into the Carian line that furnished the Caphtorim of Jabez with their men of war, but the point in the genealogy at which this union took place is not intimated. Harmon or Arimus was a Lydian king, but Greek and Indian traditions concur in giving him a daughter of Anub for a wife, and she seems to have been the mother of Acharchel. That hero must himself have espoused a Carian maiden, doubtless through his mother's influence, for she was of Japhetic descent and belonged to the kindred of Ram in the line of Jamin. Among the many consorts given to Hercules the most important is the mother of
Hyllus, for that prince was the leader of the Heraclidae. The common report is that Deianira, the daughter of (Eneus of Calydon, was his mother, but Apollonius of Rhodes mentions another Hyllus, son of Hercules, whose mother was Melite, the daughter of ^Egeus. But Hercules also married Megara, daughter of Creon, King of Thebes, whom he afterwards gave to lolaus, the son of his brother Iphicles. Hyllus again married lole, the daughter of Eurytus. Iphicles was no brother of Acharchel, but a Buzite, the Abichail whose seven sons close the Kenite genealogy, and no such name as lolaus occurs among his sons. There is, however, a Joel, answering to lolaus and Hyllus, whose posterity dwelt with the Buzites in Gilead, according to
the Kenite record, and he must be the son of Acharchel. If Acharchel was the brother-in-law of Abichail or Iphicles, his wife was a daughter of Churi. No such name as CEneus occurs in the genealogies, but his Calydon is given in the name Gilead,
and Michael furnishes a Megara. What tradition disguises, geographical nomenclature furnishes, uniting Byzantium, whose founder was Byzas, with Chalcedon as colonies of Megara, for Chalcedon is Gilead with the accentuated ayin as Gilgad. In Lydian history the two families of the Heraclidae and the
Mermnadae are represented as in opposition. The latter is the same as the Myrmidon family of Aegina and Thessaly, represented in the Kenite record by the Beerothite line of Saul, Hadar, and Shimon. So in the story of the Heraclidae proper there is opposition from the family of Tisamenus, which has been identified with that of Shimon. This contest was waged in



THE HITTITE AT THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES. 127
Egypt chiefly, for it was that in which Thebes finally fell into the hands of the Epigoni, with whom Adraatus or Hadar was associated. Creou, as King of Thebes, which bore the name of Calydnus from an ancient monarch, namely Gilead, must have been the author of that part of the hundred-gated city called Karnak, and a joint ruler with the Ammono Hittite King. The Ekronite Praetorian guards do indeed appear to have held sway during the troublous times following the death of Jabez, but
Acharchel was, in all probability, not alive at that time. The
names of Iphicles, Megara, and Calydon, associated with that of Hercules are simply indications that he married into the Carian or Ekronite line in which these names appear, and do not fix the epoch o£ his marriage. But tradition places Hercules under Eurystheus the son of Sthenelus. Othniel or Gothniel, who is
this Sthenelus, had no such son, but his brother, Seraiah, had a grandson, Harash or Charash, who gave his name to Harosheth, supposed to have lain to the west of Hazor and Kadesh in northern Galilee, but whose earliest memorial was probably Korusko on the confines of Nubia. This Harash was the contemporary of the first Amenhotop or Meonothai, who, as Menoecius, is wrongly made the father of Creon in Greek story, and was, therefore, in the same generation with Ziph the grandson of Jabez. If he, as Harosheth, be the Eurystheus of the Greeks, it is evident that an important part of Egyptian history has yet to be told pertaining to the troublous period after the death of Jabez. Eurystheus persecuted the children of Hercules, and was killed with his five sons by Hyllus. This must have taken place in Egypt, and soon afterwards the Heraclidae, as part of Caphtorim, must have been expelled along with the Ekronite Philistines. While some of the latter took possession of Ekron, the main body seems to have passed into Gilead and Bashan, where the Heraclid line of Joel also established itself. It is said of the Buzites that " they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan and in her towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon upon their borders," or " upon their exodus." ^^ They
must, therefore, have occupied two distinct regions ; the land of
Gilead, and all the sea coast north of Philistia up to the region
39 1 Chron. v. 16.



128 . THE HITTITES.
of the Dorians and Achaeans. With the former division the Heraclidae made common cause, extending their joint dominion from Aroer in the south of Moab to the Euphrates. What country the Heraclidae sought to regain is undetermined, but, as their ancestor Sargon was the first Akkadian king, it was probably his ancient domain in Babylonia, over which the Beerothite Ismidagan or Shemidag ruled, towards which their efforts were
directed. It is evident, however, that the invasion of that region took place neither in the time of the Heraclid Hyllus nor in that of the so-called Argive Tisamenus, for Joel and Shimon seem to
have found their graves in Egypt. Orestes, who is called the father of Tisamenus, is apparently the same person as Eurystheus, so that the families of Seraiah and Beeroth must have united in Shimon through his marriage with a daughter of Harash, as well as with the widow of Ishi. It must be left to the Assyriologists to show if any of the posterity of Acharchel sat on a Babylonian throne. It only remains to mention the Sumerian line which was not
Hittite but Celtic, bqjb the relations of which with the Hittites were of the most intimate nature. The oldest king of this family seems to be the one called by the Babylonian Nabonidus, who preserved one of his inscriptions. Saga Saltiyas.*" He is pro
bably Gilead the brother of Moleketh. His inscription was found by the later Babylonian at Bit Ulmas, which commemorates Ulam, his grandson. His connection with the Zerethites is shown by his restoration of temples " which were from the time of Zabu in ancient days." After him should come his son Peresh, who may be Burna Buryas, although this monarch is generally placed after Ulam-Buryas, and the initial Burna is hard to account for. But Ulam-Buryas is certainly Ulam the son of Peresh, and father of Bedan.*^ The time of Gilead is well determined by his sister Moleketh, the wife of Samlah, but his predecessors of the line of Zimran must have been in alliance with the Amalekites and Zerethites some generations before, as the Midianites were the great enemies of Hadad, the son of Bedad. The Kenite record of this family ceases with Bedan,

and does not furnish the intermediate links between Gilead and Zimran. Manasseh the son of Joseph appears to have married into the line of Abraham and Keturah, for Zimrite nomenclature reigns among his immediate descendants. Mirkhond says that the mother of Gurshasf, the brother or son of Zaub, was a
daughter of the Israelite Benjamin.^^ The only daughter of that patriarch mentioned in Scripture is Maachah, who is made the wife of Machir, the son of Manasseh.^^ Zaub and Gurshasf look very like Joab the Kenezzite and his son Charash, for the Persian
delights in final labials which are no part of the original words. There is no reconciling the two statements, but Benjamin, doubtless, had other daughters than the one whom Machir married. To follow the fortunes of Hittites and Zimrites on the banks of
the Tigris and Euphrates would be a long, arduous, and prosaic task, for the golden age of common song and story among the nations came to an end when the Pharaohs drove the poets out of the land in which the Kenite scribes collected the genealogies of the mighty dead ; and history henceforth became the story
of dispersion.

CHAPTER XIV.
The Hittites in Palestine and the Neighbouring Countries BEFORE THE RiSE OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.
During the time that Jahdai and his descendants reigned in Egypt, Canaan became almost altogether Hittite. The Horite Phoenicians kept the northern Mediterranean coast, and, to the south of them, Japhetic tribes, known later as Achaeans, Dorians and Pelasgians, held the shore down to Gaza. Then came a debatable land from Gaza to Pelusium, known as the coast of the Cherethites, not to be distinguished from the Geshurites who were of old the inhabitants of the land, for Jesher belonged to the junior division of the Zerethite nation. It was a debatable land, as the Hepherite Gezrites were there with a western Gedor, near the waters of Gaza, and the Peltite or Maachathite branch of the Jachdaites, with Beth Palet and Madmannah, and the family of MaReshah, with the Arish and Beth Tappuah, called after a son of Hebron. All of these were Hittites. East of these tribes towards Kerak in Moab extended the Amalekites of Temeni, who under Jobab and Husham ruled in Gebalene, until the Rechabite Hamathites, that, under Beeri, Esau's father-in-law, came into notice, in the third generation sent forth the warrior Hadad to overthrow their authority, and wrest from their hands the mineral treasures of the Sinaitic peninsula. Hebron, that ancient pty, built seven years before the Egyptian Zoan, saw many changes. At first it was an Amorite foundation, and bore in the time of Abraham the name of Mamre. We are not told what it was called when Ephron the Zocharite dwelt there, nor do we know how long he remained in occupation of it. During the time of Zerethite supremacy in Southern Palestine, while Baalhanan was on the throne of Gebalene, it was taken possession of by Arba the Geshurite and called Kirjath Arba. At what
point of time the posterity of MaReshah entered upon its occupa
tion is hard to decide. If it was after the overthrow of the



THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 131
Zerethites, they can have possessed it for but a short time, for the Amorites drove the Hittites northward not long before the exodus of Israel, and when Joshua entered Canaan it was in the hands of the Ainorite king, Hoham. But the descendants of Arba dwelt near at hand in the plains of Hebron, and fell before the arms of the children of Judah.^ It is probable that the men of MaReshah, or Rosh, changed the name of the city to Hebron at an earlier period, and that the old name was restored by Israel,'whose friends the lords of Rosh had been in Egypt, for Hebron was the son of MaReshah and viceroy of the great Aahpeti. Round about it were memorials of the Rosh in Tappuah, Maon and Beth-Zur, indicating the fact that settlements of the family had been exten
sively planted in southern Palestine.
One Canaanitic city is invested with the mysterious, the city
of Jerusalem. It is reported by the orientals that the Persian
Feridun built the city in the year 1729, B.C., which, according to the Hebrew Scriptures, would be shortly before the death of Isaac.^ Feridun is probably the same person as the Indian Duryodhana, or Ardon, the son of Hur and Jerigoth, and it is very likely that he occupied himself in adding to a city esteemed sacred, and which afterwards fell to the descendants of his elder brother Jesher. But there is evidence that the royal line of Jerusalem, or Salem, continued to reign until the time of Israel's
conquest. Melchizedek, who was king and priest in the days of Abraham, is called by Cedrenus and others the son of Sidos, but he is also said to have been a son of Heraclas and Astaroth.^ The Jebusites, to whose race he belonged, have no eponym given them,
but, from their position in the generations of the sons of Noah, they appear to ha\«e been the descendants of the tirst historical son of Sidon. When Joshua entered Canaan, the Amorite king of Jerusalem was Adoni Zedek, whose name replaces Melchi, the king, by Adoni, the lord, and has Zedek in common with that of
the ancient priest monarch.* As he is called an Amorite, his con
nection with the Sidonian, or Horite, line is established, thus

confirming the Sidonian ancestry of Melchizedek, which is also vouched for by the name of God employed by that king in blessing Abram, for Elioun, the Highest, is the name of the chief divinity in Sanchoniatho's Phoenician History.^ But there is a
later king, who is not, indeed, called the king of Jerusalem, but who was brought there to die after his thumbs and great toes had been cut oflf, a just recompense for thus mutilating seventy kings that gathered their food under his table ; and his name is Adoni Bezek.^ There seem to have been two places called Bezek, the one in Samaria and the other south of Jerusalem/ In the latter place the men of Judah and Simeon overcame Adoni Bezek, and the Canaanites and Perizzites that accompanied him. Their bringing the captive king to Jerusalem suggests that he was
formerly ruler over that city, for it was not the practice of the
Israelites to bring their royal prisoners to any central locality to
suffer death. If he was such, the poetic justice would be complete. The Jebusites retained possession of the citadel of Jerusalem till the time of David, who drove them out with hard fighting. Already their taunt has been referred to, and the Pisechim and Giverira, whom they challenged David to drive out, have been explained to be worshippers of heathen deities rather than the lame and the blind, whom the king of Israel could have no reason
for hating. With the prefix of the article ha the Pisechim give a plural form of Paseach as Hubisega, a great god of the Akkadians. Paseach means the lame or limping, and this word, by a change common in the Semitic languages, such as the Chaldee and Arabic as compared with the Hebrew, became Pateach. He was thus the deformed Pthah, the Vulcan of Memphis, whose images Cambyses derided and which Herodotus likened to the Pataeci, pigmy bow-legged figures placed on the prows of Phoenician ships. Sir Gardner Wilkinson has collected many etymologies given by Bochart and others for the word Pataeci, but none of the etymologists seem to have dreamt of deriving the t form from one in 8.^ Yet the learned Egyptologist allows that the deformed figure

THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 133
of Pthah gave rise to the story of the lameness of the Greek Hephaestus, who, like Pthah, was Vulcan, the god of fire. The deformed mannikin became to the Greeks a kind of rnissing link, so that his name as Pitheeus was given to the ape. Pithecus also and Pataecion equally denoted a trickster. When the Egyptians refer to the*family, or the foundation of Paseach at Thapsacus or Khupuscia, they call it Patasu ; and the Greeks termed the abode of the Paseachites in Mysia Pedasus. The Hebrew Paseach, therefore, is the Egyptian Pthah, the Phcenician Pataecus, and
the Greek Pithecus, while, with the article, Hapisech is the Akkadian Hubisega, and the Greek Hephaestus, the limping fire god. How did he find his way into Jerusalem and become a
chief divinity of the Jebusites ? It must have been at a time when the family of Beth Kapha, or Hammurabi, the brother of Paseach, was powerful in the .land, and that was when Samlah was kinof of Gebalene. Then the Jebusites. who in the time of
Isaac must still have professed the true faith, for Rebekah went to Jerusalem to enquire of the Lord concerning the children that she was to bear, having abandoned the worship of the Most High God, adopted that of Hapisech and the Giverim that probably represent the Cabiri, who were the attendants of Pthah.^ The word Bezek, save in sound, is quite different from Paseach, but
its meaning, lightning, is more dignified than the limper, and
would not be inappropriate to a fire god. It is, therefore, possible that Bezek was a complimentary appellation of Vulcan, retaining at the same time a sound generally resembling that of the Hittite deity's name. Hephaestus and the Cabiri might well be hated of David's soul. Pthah was adored at Memphis, where the Hycsos ruled before Thebes rose -to fame, and where the Praetorian guards of the line of Eker had a quarter of their own.^" That quarter bore the name Sakkara, which now denotes the Memphite necropolis. The Sakkarans were the men of Gekron, or Geker, whose ancestor was known to the Greeks as Cecrops, to the Indians as Sugriva. Now Pthah bore the epithet Sokari, which came to Paseach through an alliance with the Sakkarans. This is further vouched for by

134 THE HITTITES.
the Indian story of the young Brahman Visakha. He wandered one day into the beautiful garden grounds of the Naga Susravas, and by the side of a lake which adorned them, saw two fair young
women eating, in the midst of the greatest profusion of fruit, the tender tgps and grains of the grasses that grew on the banks.
To them he respectfully offered ground rice and wat^r, of which they partook, referring him to their father for an explanation of their conduct. Visakha sought the Naga and learned that he and his people were under the sway of certain fasting Brahmans, who,
so long as they abstained from eating new rice, had the power to hinder others from touching the abundant produce of the fields and orchards, which they could no more partake of " than a dead man could enjoy the water of a river." Visakha found out the guardian Brahmatchari, with a single tuft of hair on the top of
his head, and, after much waiting, managed to smuggle some new rice into the vessel in which he was cooking his dinner. At once the embargo was taken off the fruitful grounds, and, as a reward, Susravas gave his daughter Chaudralekha in marriage to his deliverer. But the king of Cashmere, Nara, son of Vibhichana and grandson of Havana, who was also called Kinnara, was in love with Chandralekha, and sought to take her from her husband. Unable to withstand the king, Visakha fled with his wife to the
protection of his father-in-law. Susravas. rising in his might, burst as a storm upon Nara, involving him and his Kinnaras in
utter destruction, while his sister Ramani, airiving too late to
help her brother, buried the villages of the impious monarch under a shower of stones.^^ This remarkable story points to a change of creed, introduced by Pascach as Visakha, and to his alliance with the family of Eker;set forth by Susravas. The connection of Nara with Ravana and the Kinnaras seems to make him of the Kapha family of Abiezer, who married the Kenezzite Hathath. Pthah Sokari has often been compared with the Indian Budha Sukra ; they are the same person.^^ The Sanscrit tradi
tion is as confused as the Greek story of the Dardanians, but it contains all the elenients. Tara, the wife of Brihaspati, was carried off by Soma, and to them was born Budha. The son of

Budha and Ila, the daughter of Manu, who was also his son Sudyumna, was Pururavas, This Pururavas has been thoroughly identified with Kapha the brother of Paseach, but the Sanscrit writings still further confuse the genealogy by making Vasishtha, or Ishhod, of Kapha's family, the father of Sukra and of an Anagha, who occupies an important place in the line of Paseach.^^ In Greek mythology Paseach is Bias, the brother of Melampus. It was the wish of Bias to marry Pero, daughter of Neleus, that led Melampus to undertake the expedition to Phylace, to bring back from thence the cows that had anciently belonged to Tyro, the mother of Neleus, which Iphiclus kept. The brothers are said to have shared the throne of Argos and Mycenae with Acrisius the son of Abas, but, as Kapha was the contemporary of Regem, or Sargon of Agade, it is evident that tradition has imputed to the founders of the Rephaim and Paseachite families that which was true only of their descendants.
The contradictions of Greek tradition are well illustrated in
the story of Bias. He is called the son of Amythaon, who was the brother of Pelias and Neleus, but, while he marries Pero, the daughter of Neleus, Pelias marries his daughter Anaxibia. The name Anaxabia, however, brings light into the Paseachite genealogy, although the Kenites did not preserve it in that form. In early Egyptian history there appears among prophetic and priestly names that of Anxhapis. It is the name of a man, not of a woman as is Anaxibia. Anxhapis was the son of Imhotep, a person of
note, celebrated in the Festal Dirge of the Egyptians. " I have heard the words of Imhotep and Hartatef,
It is said in their sayings
;
After all what is prosp6rity ?
Their fenced walls are dilapidated. Their houses are as that which has never existed. No man comes from thence. Who tells of their sayings,
Who tells of their affairs, Who encourages our hearts. Ye go to the place whence they return not.'
13 Muir, Sanscrit Texts. 1* Records of the Past, iv. 117.



136 THE HITTITES.
Imhotep was the son of Pthah, so that he conies between Anxhapis and Paseach, or Bias, called the father of Anaxibia. There was another writer among the Egyptians called Pthah Hotep, who compiled a book of Moral Precepts in the reign of Assa Tatkara of the fifth dynasty.^^ His name shows that the family of Pthah was associated by the Egyptians with ethical compositions. In Eratosthenes' table of Upper Egyptian kings, one called Choma Ephta follows Meres Philosophus, and is succeeded by Anchunius Ochy ; and, lower down, after Maris, who seems to be a repetition of Meres, comes Siphoas Hermes, Cicero calls the Egyptian Vulcan not Pthah but Opas, and Pliny says that the son of Vulcan was ^thiops.^^ Bryant connects these names with the city on the Tigris called Opis, and Sir Henry Rawlinson, recognizing
the site of that city on the Physcus, a tributary of the Tigris, derives the word Physcus from the Assyrian Hupuska.^'^ The island of Rhodes was called Ophiussa; it contained a Physcus portus, and Physcus of Caria was under its jurisdiction. The Opici inhabited Vescia in Campania, and the neighbouring island Pithecusa was famous for its mountain, Epopeus. According to Macrobius, Cecrops was the first to introduce the worship of Opis into Greece. ^^ For once Bryant has found the truth in his laboured etymologizing. He connects with these names the place called Oboth, which was a stage in the wanderings of Israel some
distance to the south-east of the Dead Sea, on the borders of the two Arabias, Petraea and Felix. ^^ This is where Ptolemy places the Ausitae, and the prophet Jeremiah represents the Edomites as dwelling in the land of Vz.^ The name of Uz, son of Aram, has led many Biblical critics to look for the home of Job in the Hauran east of Bashan, but there was another Uz, the son of Dishan the Horite, who gave his name to the country east of Mount Hor, or the Idumean range.^^ Oboth is a compound of the word Ob, denoting first a bottle, but, secondarily and chiefly,

a soothsayer, magician, necromancer, one that has a familiar spirit.
It is the root also of the name Job, from which it differs only in Hebrew by the insertion of the letter yod. When Elihu, the son
of Barachel the Buzite, said he was ready to burst like new bottles, or ohoth, he may have been in all seriousness making a play upon the name of the afflicted Job whom he pretended to answer. Bryant has not associated the patriarch with the name Oboth, but he has rightly shown the signification of that name to be python, daemon, and has indicated the divine enactments forbidding the Israelites to have recourse to Ob, and the fact that the witch of Endor was an Ob, or Pythoness. The name is of frequent occurrence in the Old Testament. Few things could be more unexpected than the relationship of the Vulcan of many lands with the patriarch Job. The tradition which, taken from the Syriac, is appended to the Septuagint version of the Book of Job, identifies him with Jobab, the son of Zerah of Bozrah, and this mischievous piece of fable has had the effect of obscuring the whole history of the kings that reigned in Edom, and of turning
the pious Hittite sage into an Edomite. It is, however, interesting to find that the Seventy translated the name of Job's third daughter, Kerenhappuch, by Amalthaias-keras, or the Horn of Amalthaea, which is the same as the Cornucopiae of the Latins, a word that, in form if not in signification, more perfectly renders
the original. This horn of plenty was given by Jupiter to the nymph Adrastea, when he had broken it from the head of the goat Amalthaea which had suckled him, and filled it with a profusion of good things. The name Amalthaea belongs to Mylitta, or Moleketh, but it seems to have become in some way the property of the line of Paseach, for it denotes a Sibyl of Cyme in Asia Minor, who was also called Demophile and Herophile, and who by her own account came from " a country sacred to the ipighty Ops."^^ Another Sibyl was Demo, who belonged to Cumae, a city of the Opici in Campania ; and another, Sabbe, whom the Hebrews beyond Philistia say was the daughter of Berosus and Erymanthe.^^ There was also a Samian Sibyl, and a Phrygian, who prophesied at Ancyra. Cyme, Cumae, and Samos

were all named after Shema, or Shemaiah, a member of the family of Paseaeh. Trading on the reputation of Job as a prophet, his descendants, when they fell away into idolatry, pretended to have inherited his spirit, and so disgraced the name of their ancestor that it came to be synonymous with necromancy, just as that of his great father Paseaeh has descended, through the Phoenician Pataeci, to the modern fetish. The Hapisechim of Jerusalem were . thus Obim, or necromancers. In Sanscrit tradition Job is known as Kapi or Kavi who is united with Paseaeh, as Puskarin, and with the Sankritis who represent Sukra or Eker.-* Through the alliance of the Kavyas with the latter family they became Brahmans of Kshattriya race. These Kavyas or Kavis were men of great wisdom, priests and composers of hymns, and the name Kavi denotes a poet inspired by divinity. The Mahabharata contains a remarkable story in which Kavi figures as the father of Sukra Usana, head of the Asuras. The Suras under Brihaspati, son of Angiras, fought with the A.suras, but with the disadvantage that, while Kavi
could resuscitate his slain, Brihaspati could not. Therefore the Suras sent Katcha, the eldest son of Brihaspati, to Sukra, son of
Kavi, to learn Jiis secret. Katcha was well received by the son of Kavi and won the affection of his daughter, Devayani, but the Danavas, who hated Brihaspati and feared lest Katcha should acquire the wisdom of Sukra, killed him and threw him to the jackals, Sukra, at the request of his daughter, restored him to life, but a second time the Danavas put him to death,
and, cutting his lx)dy into pieces, threw them into the sea. Once more the Kavi revived Katcha. The third time, however, the Danavas made away with the Sura prince by burning his body to ashes and making Sukra drink the beverage into which they threw them. Then Katcha, when revived by Sukra's magic> answered the sage from the recesses of his own person. There was no way to restore the son of Brihaspati to the world but by he sacrifice of himself. Sukra made this sacrifice, and Katcha
Came forth from the rent body of his teacher, a being of celestial beauty and endowed with all the dead sage's knowledge. Katcha
had learned his lesson well, and, at once forgetting the hostile

mission on which he had come, in gratitude for Sukra's self
devotion, restored the son of Kavi to life and honour.'^'' The story is apparently full of contradictions, but its important
feature is the placing of Kavi in the same relation as Budha towards Sukra or the Brahrnanical family of Eker. In the legends of the first Budha, the son of Pururavas called Ayus seems to take the place of Kavi. As a Hittite word, Job is the Basque auba, the mouth, but the commoner form is ao or aho, and the Iroquois is osa, but in Yenisian, which is Siberian
Iroquois, the word for mouth is hobii, choboi, and hohui. It is remarkable that the Latin os and Iroquois osa should be found
to designate the same member. Job is said to have been the greatest of all the men of the East, a statement that at once lifts him out of obscurity and demands his recognition among the princes of the time of Jabez.-^ His father, Paseach, was the contemporary of Regem, whose widow was married by his -brother Rapha. If Regem's
reign came to an end at the same time as that of his father, Jachdai, Jabez would be on the throne during Paseach's lifetime.
Paseach himself was, in all probability, a worshipper of the true God, for as the first Budha he seems to have set that example of peacefulness which Gautama or Siddharta followed in the sixth century before Christ. He belongs, therefore, to the same category as the later Saul of Rehoboth, but whether like him he was influenced by the practice of Jabez and his prime minister
Joseph, or by the teaching of some true king of Salem, the city with which his name was afterwards associated, cannot yet be decided. The honour which Pthah received in Egypt must have originated in Hycsos' days, at the timeVhen his brother Rapha adopted the abominations of Baal Peor and allied himself with Bela's descendants, the Kenezzites of the Elephantine kingdom. The story of Visakha in the Raja Tarangini represents him in a figurative way as a missionary to the Japhetic Ekronites, who were the guardians of the throne of the Amenemes. In Irish history he is known as Fiachadh, a name somewhat resembling the Greek He Phaestus, but his son Job is passed over, and
25 Mahabharata, Adhiparva. 26 Job i. 3.

Aongus is made his successor.-^ Fiachadh is improperly made a
descendant of Irial, and his father is called Smiorgfioll, a name which recalls the Simurgh of the Persians. When Buddhism was revived in India in the sixth century, B.C., it was invested
with the historical incidents that pertained to the original Budha, Pthah, or Paseach. Among the ancestors of Buddha were ranked Chetiya, Upachara, and Muchala, who represent Vasishtha, Apsaras, and the father of the Tritsus, in Brahmanical tradition. But their ancestor Eshton, of the Kenite list, who ia the father of Paseach, is the same person as Sudhodana, the father of Buddha.-® As in the story of Visakha the great enemy was Nara, so in that of Buddha the demon Mara strives to destroy the sage. There se6ms to have been a revival of Buddhism in the west as well as in the east, preceding that of Gautama Buddha by fifty years or more. Three names that are well authenticated as thope of philosophers, who flourished between the middle of the seventh and the end of the sixth century, B.C., are associated with statements that belong properly to the original teacher whose names under different disguises they bore.^^ One of these is Bias of Priene, whose name is identical with that of the brother of Melampus. He
was a just judge and reputed the chief of the seven sages. Another is Pittacus, of Mytilene, in Lesbos, who overthrew Melanchrus, the tyrant of that island, and gained a victory by .stratagem over the Athenian commander Phrynon, whom he caught in a net. Alcaeus, the poet, with whom he fought against Melanchrus, afterwards turned against him, reviling his quondam friend as physcon, the fat and sarapous, the splay-footed. But the chief name is that of Pythagoras. Already he has appeared in connection with Hittite history as the owner of the slave Zamolxis, and as the son of Mnesarchus, two names that set forth Samlah of Masrekah. He was a native of Samos, and his daughter Damo, who inherited her father's wisdom, recalls Demo the Sibyl of Cumae. What is more startling is the statement of Diogenes Laertius that Pythagoras carried geometry to

perfection after Moeris had discovered the elements of the science ; for it has been indicated that Eratosthenes places Choma Ephtha after Meres Philosophus. His sayings were regarded as the
oracles of God. He prohibited the taking away of life, offered unbloody sacrifices, and taught the doctrine of metempsychosis, in all of which respects he resembled Buddha. The traditions of the Huron-Iroquois tribes are not numerous, but they shed some light upon the history of Paseach and his son Job. According to Charlevoix the primitive Huron divinity was a woman, Atahentsik, who, being thrown from the sky, was
received on the back of a turtle. Her grandchildren, the sons of her nameless daughter, were Jouskeka and Thawitsaron. Jouskeka killed his brother and received from his grandmother the government of the world.^^ This Jouskeka, or Jouskeha as he is sometimes called, is as near as the Hurons can come to Paseach or Hubisega, as they are destitute of labials. They call themselves Yendots or Wyandotts, which is the same word as the Basque yende, meaning people,although the Basque lexicographers derive it from the Latin gens.^^ The Achashtarite origin of the Hurons is well vouched for by the name Ahatsistari, the fearless man, which is almost hereditary in the line of Huron chiefs.^^
They also adore the chief person in the jurrior Achashtarite line, namely, Ma Reshah, the namer of the Arish, whom they call Areskoui and recognize as the god of war. But the good genius of the Hurons is the evil one of the Iroquois, who term him Tawiskano, Tawiscara, Saiewiskerat, and also Tehotennhiaron.^^ Tawiscara is the Puskara of the Sanscrit traditions. He persistently opposed the work of Tharonhiawakon, the holder of the heavens, who represents Beth Zur, the namer of Saravene, and the Zervan or Zerouane of Persian story. This Beth Zur was of the line of Ma Reshah, the Iroquois Agreskoui, from whom, no •doubt, came the much disputed name, Iroquois, which is just the word meaning man, variously set forth according to the diflferent dialects as onkwe, lukwe, rokwe. As Tharonhiawakon he was

the maker of the lakes, rivers, and streams, and these, for the benefit of mankind, he made without impediment of any kind, but the mischievous Tawiscara, a veritable Puck, destroyed his
brother's work by placinor rocks in the water, creating falls and rapids that hindered all progress. Tharonhiawakon found him
out in his evil deeds, and a conflict took place in which he was victorious, for the unhappy Tawiscara had only a blade of grass to defend himself with, while the river-maker fought with a stag's horn. From the blood that issued from the wounds of Tawiscara, kannhia or flint was formed, and from this metamorphosis he received the name of Tehotennhiaron, the letters nn^'ia standing for kannhia. These flints became the Mohawk tribe whose name is Kanienke.^* It is evident, therefore, that this tradition, which makes Tawiscara an evil genius, was not originally a Mohawk one. The Mohawk 'dialect is most nearly related to the Huron. The Buddha or Quetzalcoatl of the Iroquois was not Tawiscara, however, but Hiawatha. He appeared mysteriously in the realm of Atotarho, King of the Onondagas, a warrior and a tyrant. Nothing is said of his family, save that Atotarho had put some of them to death. According to one account, the daughter of Hiawatha met her death through a scheme of the Onondaga king, but another states that she was killed by an enormous bird that crushed her to atoms. This great bird, at the sight of which Hiawatha warned his daughter to prepare for her coming doom, is now well known, for it is no other than the Harpy, the Stymphalis, the Simurgh, the vulture Lubad, the man-eater of Gwenddoleu ; but the Iroquois chronicler errs in connecting it with Atotarho. Hiawatha had endeavoured to get the Onondagas to consent to a great scheme of universal brotherhood, involving the total abolition of warfare, but his assemblies were always dispersed by the sudden apparition of the terrible Atotarho. After the death of his daughter, the peace-loving chief sailed in his white canoe to the land of the Caniengas or Mohawks, and there succeeded in gaining over Dekanawidah, who is supposed not to have been a genuine Canienga. Hiawatha was adopted into the Canienga tribe, and was ever afterwards
recognized as its representative. Then Odatsehte of the Oneidas

joined the league, and the three chiefs waited upon Atotarho, but he still refused to have anything to do with the bond of peace. The Cayugas were next sought out, and their leader, Akahenyonk, entered the league. Atotarho could no longer
withstand the pressure brought to bear upon him, and, as a chief place was given to him in the confederacy, he became as eager to extend its influence as he had formerly been to oppose it. By his means the powerful Senecas, or more properly Sonontowanes, were added to the league under their two chiefs, Kanyadariyo and Shadekaronyes. The league being formed, at the head of it was placed Tekarihoken, reported to be a Canienga, but recog
nized as the representative of the most ancient Iroquois family, while the name of Dekanawidah disappeared from view. Mr. Horatio Hale, who has collected some Iroquois traditions, and to
whom the world is indebted for the text and translation of the Iroquois Book of Rites, first committed to writing about a century ago, is of the opinion that Hiawatha and the great League belong to the fifteenth century. While the language of
the Book of Rites may justify such a date, and the actual names contained in it may be found to correspond with those of living chiefs, the fact of the League's foundation goes back to the time when Chaldean kings of Hittite birth called themselves lords of Kiprat Arba or the four races, a title preserved in the Laur
Cantons or four quarters of the Basque legends, and in the Peruvian lordship of the four regions of the earth. The Egyptian records show that the Hittites were united in Palestine as a con
federacy of tribes under a leader whom they call a grand Duke, but whom the Hittites themselves no doubt designated a King
of Kings.^^ The key to the Iroquois riddle is the Canienga name. The Caniengas, or as the Abbd Cuoq calls them Kanienke, are American Yeniseians, whose mounds in Asia rival those of the
Ohio and Mississippi. From the Yenisei to the tributaries of the Obi this remnant of a once powerful nation dwells, speaking a well defined Khitan language, and calling themselves individually Khitts. Those who inhabit Inbazk and Turuchansk call themselves collectively Kenniyeng, which is the Kanienke name.^®

Other tribes are Assan, Kottuen, and Arin or Aral. In the times of the classical geographers the flint men were known in the Caucasus as the Heniochi, and it was reported that their
ancestors were the charioteers of the Dioscuri.^^ To the present day Anzuch is the name of a Lesghian tribe, and the Circassians call all the Lesghians Hannoatshe, while the Mizjejians term them Sueli. In Sanscrit story the wise king Janaka, who confutes the Brahmans and is contemporary with Vasishtha, appears as the ancestor of the Heniochi, and he seems to be the same person as Jahnu, descendant of Ayus. The ninefold Angiras, also, is connected with Kavi, being taken together with him out
of the ashes of the fire. But the most lordly representative is Ganga, the Ganges. When this river flowed down from the mane of Siva, it overspread the sacred place in which Jahnu was exercising himself in devotion. Irritated by this want of
respect, the sage drank up the entire river, and it was only after
the earnest entreaties of the gods and rishis had been addressed to him, that he allowed the imprisoned stream to flow forth from his ears. Hence the Ganges is called Jahnavi, the daughter of Jahnu. The Angiras also were drinkers up of rivers.^ In Eratosthenes' list of Upper Egyptian Kings, Anchunius Ochy follows Choma Ephta. In Grecian legendary history Anaxagoras, called the son of Argeius and grandson of Megapenthes, shared the throne of Argos with Bias and Melampus. In Buddhist story Hansa is the king of birds, and when Gautama cut off his hair on becoming a recluse, it .soared into the heavens and
assumed the form of a hansa.3» The Arabs are said to call the ibis of the Nile Abu Hansa. This introduces the Arabian Anka which ranks with the Harpy and the Simurgh as the devourer of the people of Al Has. Some writers say that Schoaib, the son of Mikail, or descendant of Hanoch, was the prophet who preached to the people of Al Rass, and that, on their failing to believe him, the efirth opened and swallowed them up. Others make the prophet Handha ebn Safwan, whom the Rassites disregarded and in consequence were devoured by the Anka.*° In Irish history

the son of Fiachadh is Aongus, a ^reat warrior who defeated in thirty battles the Scots, Picts, and Firbolgs^^ The story of Heugist the Saxon, as told by the British chroniclers has already
been found to lie in a lapful of very ancient traditions. Dr. Latham, quoting largely from Kemble, says : " The account of Hengist's and Horsa's landing has elements which are fictional rather than historical. Thus when we find Hengist and Horsa approaching the coast of Kent in three keels, and Aelli effecting a landinsr in Sussex with the same number, we are reminded of the Gothic tradition which carries a migration of Ostrogoths,
Visigoths, and Gepidae, also in three vessels to the mouth of the
Vistula. The murder of the British chieftains by Hengist is told totidem verbis by Widukind and others, of the old Saxons in Thuringia. Geoffrey of Monmouth relates also how Hengist obtained from the Britons as much land as could be enclosed by an ox -hide ; then cutting the hide into thongs, enclosed a much larger space than the granters intended, on which he erected
Thong Castle ; a tale too familiar to need illustration, and which runs throughout the my thus of many nations. Among the Old Saxons the tradition is in reality the same, though recorded with
a slight variety of detail. In their story a lapfull of earth is purchased at a dear rate from a Thuringian ; the companions of the Saxon jeer him for his imprudent bargain ; but he sows the purchased earth upon a large space of ground, which he claims, and by the aid of his comrades ultimately wrests it from the Thuringians." *^ Dr. Latham also shows that the so-called Jutes who came over with the Saxon invaders were no Germans but the people of Vectis or the Isle of Wight. Now Hengist was
the son of Vihtgils, of Vitta, of Vecta, of Odin ; what is this but Aongus of Fiachadh, and the Indian Janaka, King of Videha, and the Iroquois Kanienke, derived from the blood of Tawiskara.^^ The man whose name explains these genealogies is in the Kenite list Hanoch or Chanoch, called the son of Reuben.** Reuben had a son of that name, but he was not the father of

Joel.*^ In Norse story Hanoch is Yngvi the head of the Ynglin
gians, whose festival of Yule was held at Rugen on the Baltic.** There were two Joels, one the son of Hanoch, who was the father of Shemaiah and grandfather of Gog ; the other, the son of Acharchel and father of Shema. But Hiawatha, the man of peace and chief of the Caniengas, is Job in the topographical form Oboth, the father of Hanoch and son of Paseach. Further proof of the identity of Tawiscara, the ancestor of the Kanienke, and Paseach, is found in the coincidence of two American traditions. Cusick, the author of The History of the Six Nations, relates that when the Iroquois in their migrations came to the Ohio, they found an enormous grape-vine trailing across the river from bank to bank. By means of this natural bridge a large number of the people made their way to the other side, but the vine suddenly broke, so that many were unable to cross. Those who remained behind became the enemies of those who had pa.ssed over.*^ With this may be compared the story told to Catlin by the Mandan chiefs. " The Mandans (Seepohskah) were the first people created in the world, and they originally lived inside of the earth ; they raised many vines, and one of them had grown up through a hole in the earth overhead, and one of their young men climbed up it until he came out on the top of the ground on the bank of the river where the Mandan village stands. He looked around and admired the beautiful country and prairies about him, saw many buffaloes, killed one with his bow and arrows, and found that its meat was good to eat He returned and related what he had seen ; when a number of others went up the vine with him and witnessed the same things. Amongst those who went up were two very pretty young women, who were favourites of the chief's because they were virgins ; and amongst those who were trying to get up was a very large and fat woman, who was ordered by the chief not to go up, but whose curiosity led her to try it as soon as she got a secret opportunity, when there was no one present. When she got part of the way up the vine broke under the great weight of

her body and let her down. She was very much hurt by the fall but did not die. The Mandans were very sorry about this ; and she was disgraced for being the cause of a very great calamity, which she had brought upon them, and which could never be averted ; for no more could ever ascend, nor could those descend who had got up ; but they built the Mandan village where it formerly stood, a great ways below on the river ; and the remainder of the people live underground to this day." *^ Catlin remarked the light complexion, the blue and grey eyes, of many Mandans, and imagined that he had found the lost crew of the Welsh Madoc. He also mentions their round skin coracles, blue glass beads of their own manufacture, and the identity in pattern of the pottery which he saw the Mandan women make with that found in the mounds. The true name of the Mandan stock seems to have been Wahtana, which is a variation of Eshton, the name of the father of Paseach. Among the Esthonians of the Baltic the name of Paseach is not prominent, but one of their divisions is Ungannia, representing Hanoch.*^ The Mandan name Seepohskah, said to mean the pheasant, is the Circassian Schapsuch answering to the Hittite Khupuscia, the Basque Guipuscoa, and the Akkadian god, Hubisega. The Iroquois and Mandan tales are of the same origin as the well known Jack of the Bean Stalk. But this legend is generally associated with the name of Hanoch. Thus the great abyss of Norse mythology is the Ginnunga-gap, and this is the fatal chasm in the realm of the Phrygian Midas, which closed only when Anchurus, his son, like the Roman Mettus Curtius, leaped into it and gave rise to the weeping of Annacus. Again it is linked with Ancaeus, the Samian, to whom a prophet intimates that he shall not drink of the fruitage of his vineyard, a prophecy which he answers by
raising a cup of new wine to his lips, when he is told that a wild boar is ravaging his vines ; leaving the cup untasted, he goes to meet the enemy and falls a victim to his tusks. From this incident arose the proverb :
" There's many a slip ' Twixt the cup and the lip."

As Oeneus of Calydon, the father of Deianira, wife of Hercules and mother of Hyllus, he is still the same as the Samian Ancaeus, for he also is a planter
of vines, but, neglecting to honour Artemis after a rich harvest, the Calydonian boar destroys all the labour of his hands. Once more he is Gunadhya who has written a poem of unparalleled ength with his own blood. It is in the Pisacha dialect, however, and King Satavahana will not give the price asked for it. Then Gunadhya ascends a mountain and begins burning his composition, surrounded by all the beasts of the forest, who shed tears
of rapture as they listen to the beautiful verses. Satavahana, falling sick asks for game, but none can be had as all the animals
are listening to the story of the poet. Thereupon, like the second Tarquin, he is compelled to pay the original price for the seventh part that remains. In the case of the Cumaean Sibyl, two thirds of her composition was love's labour lost. So far as the meaning of these stories can be penetrated they seem to
contain the record of two distinct events, the separation of elements once united, and a fall from prosperity to adversity.
The latter, which is also illustrated by the Buddhist story of Wessantara, a predecessor of Gautama, and by the Sanscrit legend of Harischandra, refers to Job the father of Hanoch ; and there is every reason to believe that the separation of tribes once united, and the union of the disunited by the self-sacrifice of one
man, as in the case of Anchurus, refer to the same patriarch. The Iroquois legend of Hiawatha places at the head of the confederacy Tekarihoken, " who represents the noblest lineage of the Iroquois stock." This is undoubtedly a disguised Regem or Sargon of Agade, no Mohawk, therefore, but an Akkadian, Jachdaite, or Adite, belonging to the Zuzimite family of Achuzam, the first born of Ashchur, the Hittite father. The name Tekarihoken, which in the plural becomes Tehadirihoken, is compounded of kaHho, a wild beast, which makes kontiriho



THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 149
in the plural. The chief so called is the same as the Riozin or dragon god of the Japanese. He is Regem the originator of the name Ka-Resrem-ish or Carchemish, which became the Hittite metropolis and seat of the Hittite Kings of Kings. The confusion of his name with the Caniengas or Mohawks arose out of the union of his descendant Aharhel with a daughter of Hanoch, the Paseachite, and out of the double union of these two families with the Buzites, descended from the Japhetic Eker, from which
latter union originated all the traditions of white men preserved by the Regemites and Paseachites in many lands, and from which also may tave been derived the fairer complexion and IndoEuropean features which Catlin and others have observed in some American Indian tribes. The Onoiidagas, whose name comes from onontes, a mountain, are the Hamathites, but the Hamathites of the line of Rechab and Beeri, for their chief is Atotarho, the great warrior, the same as Hadadezer and the Sanscrit Yudisthira, who, aiming at universal authority, nevertheless allied himself with Krishna or Regem against the Zerethite Kurus and their Midianite allies. The Senecas or Sonontowane are but another Hamathite line, the initial s being of Elamite origin, for in Elani Hamath became Sumudu ; and as the Iroquois have lost m, with the other labials, two ns have to do duty for that letter. But the Elamite Hamathites were of the two lines of Ezra and Salma, so they have two representatives, of whom one, Kanadariyu, is an Iroquois Gedor in the Gandhara, Centaur and Gunther form of the name. Shadekaronyes, the other Seneca chief, is harder to account for, but the name is well identified with the Gedor line, being the same as
Satakarni, a name that occurs thrice in the Indian list of Andhra kings, whose name connects them with Indra or Jether. The family of Gedor was at first in league with the Zerethites, but afterwards seems to have joined the sons of Naarah. Three of the allied chiefs must for the present dispense with recognition. These are Dekanawidah, the Mohawk or Canienga, Odatsehte the Oneida, an Iroquois Odysseus, and Akahenyonk, the Cayuga. The name of Dekanawidah resembles that of the Andhra King Skandhaswati. He may thus possibly be the head of the Netophathites of the family of Chedorlaomer, a Greek Antiphates,



150 THE HITTITES.
and historical Egyptian Numhotep. Supposing this to be the case, we can assert the contemporaneousness of Regem, Hadad, Gedor, the son of Jered, Netophath, and Job, the son of Paseach, who are Tekarihoken, Atotarho, Kanadariyu, Dekanawidah, and Hiawatha, although the latter must have been the younger,
belonging virtually to the next generation. The so-called League of the Iroquois, founded by these men about the time that Joseph was sold into Egypt, was the original Amphictyonic League of the Greeks. Amphictyon, its founder, is indeed called a son of Deucalion, but the feminine form Amphictyone is always connected with the name of Phthius. In the league were found
Thessalians or Zocharites, Phthiotes or Paseachites, Malians or Mahalaites, Perrhaebians or Rephaim, CEteans or Jahdaites, Phoceans or Japhetic Buzites, Dolopes or Eliphazites, and other
tribes, some of Hittite, others of purely Hellenic origin ; but it is very unlikely that all of these constituted the primitive League which seems to have embraced only the four tribes descended from Ashchur and Naarah, although there seems to be evidence that the Zocharites and the Aryan Ekronites had
representation in its councils. While Carchemish was regarded in the time of Hittite domination in Syria and Mesopotamia as the centre of the confederacy, it does not appear that the ruler of that city had any extensive
region under his immediate control. In this respect Khupuscia, or Thapsacus, was superior to Carchemish, its king being called the king of the Nairi and, sometimes, the king of the Hittites.'*" The Nairi occupied all northern Mesopotamia and overspread its limits into Syria and Armenia. Thus Paseach's line acquired great reputation, displacing in point of authority that of his elder brother Kapha. The name of Hanoch survived among the Nairi, or Mehirites, as Yanzu, designating more than one king of Khupuscia" The Nairi of the New World were the Mexican Nahuatl and the Nicaraguans. The story of their advent in seven vessels is obscure, but it is stated that they brought with them a deity enveloped in sacred wrappings, some Buddhist relic probably, who

was known as Opu, or the invisible.^^ Opu, however, is not an Aztec word, nor do we know what reason the chronicler had to
translate it by the invisible. It is the Ob, Opis, Opus, of the Hebrews and Greeks, the latter of whom Pindar sets forth in his ninth Olympic, with Opuntian Locris and the Oilean Ajax, as the son of Zeus and Protogenia, Deucalion's daughter.^^ There was a Protogenia, daughter of Calydon, who, as Gilead the Buzite, is more likely to have been the relative of Job than the long departed Zochar. Homer seems to have known the patriarch by fame in his land of Uz, for he represents Jupiter as turning away from Troy to look upon those most just men, the milk-fed Abii, and
the Mysians and Thracians.^^ Indian writers ascribe his virtues
to his son Hanoch, calling J anaka the father of his people, although the afflicted sage, disguised as Suvarna, Janaka's father, is made a distributer of gold to the poor. Janaka was constantly engaged in meditating upon the life to come, which gave him a tranquil mind. " And these words were repeated by the king of Mithila, when he beheld the city enveloped in fire, ' nothing of mine is
burnt here,' so said the king to himself."
" Though worldly pelf I own no more, Of wealth I have a boundless store ; While Mithila the flames devour, My goods can all defy their power." 55
The life of the philosopher Anaxagoras appears to contain elements that belong to Hanoch, who has already been identified with the Argive monarch of that name, or rather to his father,
Job. He was told that his disregard of earthly things indicated a want of love for his country, when, pointing to heaven, he
replied : " I have the greatest affection for it." When told of the death of his children whom he buried with his own hands he answered : " I knew that I was the father of mortals." The account of his trial for impiety and his appearance before his judges, worn to a shadow and stricken with disease that moved
all hearts to pity, even his release at the request of Pericles and

his death at Lampsacus, are strange coincidences with Job's story, for he was a man of Paseach, and Barachel, the Buzite, was his friend. One touching request of the philosopher was his last
;
when the governors of Lampsacus asked what they could do for him ; " Let the children play every year during the month of my death." ^^ It will be difficult to separate from the stories of Paseach and Hanoch the facts that pertain to the life of the greater son
of the one and father of the other.

CHAPTER XV.
The Hittites in Palestine and the Neighbouring Countries before the Rise of the Assyrian Empire (Continued).
The Iroquois tradition, which is connected with the life history of that indomitable race, and which there is, therefore, no reason to doubt, represents Job as suffering from tyranny, and that the tyranny of Hadad in Gebalene. Now, Job's home was there in the very heart of ITadad's kingdom, but the story of the bird that killed Hiawatha's daughter belongs to Samlah's time. In his youth the hermit of Uz must have been a man of great activity and of powers of organization. It is not unlikely that, with the aid of the Hepherite Netophath, he organized a league of the Hittite peoples with a view to uni 7ersal brotherhood, so thoroughly congenial to a heart that beat with the warmest sympathy for want and suffering. One naturally asks whence did he derive his
pure faith ? Did it belong to him only in late years, the result
of the great religious movement that took place in the reign of the Egyptian Jabez ; did it come through the alliance of his family with godly Midianites ; or was it the effect of the teaching of some later Melchizedek, in that Jerusalem which preserved his father's memory as that of a heathen god in after days ? There is reason to think that his affliction came upon him in what would now be middle-age, and that he could not have been indebted to the teach
ing of Josepli's Pharaoh for his creed. He, therefore, represents
an early protest against growing idolatry and superstitious rites of the foulest and most murderous kind, then in vogue in Babylonia and Egypt. His enemies were not Hittites nor Amorites, but Chasdim descended from Abraham's brother Nahor, and Sabaeans of the family of Cush. His three friends were Hittites like himself, representing three branches of the race. There was Eliphaz, the Temanite, a son perhaps of Husham, who had been king in Gebalene, the namer, it may be, of the Jebel el Tarfuyeh



154 THE HITTITES.
near Zerkeh, which, as an ancient Delphi purged for a time from idolatry, was the meeting place of the League. And with him sat Bildad the Shuhite, belonging to the branch of the Achashtarite family in which MaReshah ranked highest, the nearest, therefore to Job in tribal kinship. And the third, Zophar the Naamathite, was of the race of Zochar, for the Naamathites were descended from Naam, the son of Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, whose father was Ephron the Hittite. It is strange that of the three lines of Hepher which contributed so largely to the League,
no member came to condole with the afflicted patriarch, and that the Achuzamites of Egypt and Akkad stood aloof from him. But there was a young man present, whose father must have been Job's friend, a man of foreign race and alien blood, whether he came from the Maaleh Acrabbim, south of the Dead Sea, or from Pharaoh's guard-house at the mines of Sinai, Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, a warrior, doubtless, like all his race and a descendant of the great king Cecrops. That the League was formed by this time is evidenced by the representation of five distinct families in the company, composed of the Chelubite sage and his four friends. They may have been members with him of the great Council. The 29th chapter of Job shows the high position which he held in Gebalene, and intimates that he was a warrior as well as a righteous judge and a man of great benevolence, for he " brake the jaws of the wicked and plucked the spoil out of his teeth ;" he chose out also the way of the people, " and dwelt as a king in the army." ^ But in the following chapter the work that he had done in consolidating the tribes and reclaiming them from a life of rapine, barbarism, and misery is well set forth in contrast with the treatment which he received at the hands of those for whose welfare the best years of his life had been spent. " For want and famine they were solitary, fleeing into the wilderness, in former time desolate and waste. Who cut up mallows by the bushes and juniper roots for their meat They were driven forth from among men ; they cried after them as after a thief ; to dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth and in the rocks. Among the bushes they brayed ; under the nettles they were gathered together. They
1 Job xxix. 17, 25,



THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 155
were children of fools, yea, children of base men ; they were viler than the earth. And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword." ^ Such were the younger men that had the patriarch in derision, whose fathers he would have disdained to have set with the dogs of his flock. This evidence is very striking. The wars of Chederlaomer, of Bela, and Jobab, and Husham, and Hadad, had demoralized the Hittites of Gebalene. A numerous people, they were without organization. Tribe fought against tribe, and rising nations, less numerous but more united, were already beginning to make them a prey. The most of the tribes were, doubtless, the vagabonds that Job describes them as being when he undertook their cause. He had united them, given them peace and a strong government, so that a judge was on the earth again and prosperity abounded. The inwardness of Job's grief is apparent. A prophet of the true God, a lover of peace, a preacher
of unity and the benefits of a well regulated national life, he had had hard work to gain acceptance for his reforms. In the prosperity that followed the reception of his counsels he had, no doubt, told the people to behold the divine blessing, heaven's justification of his advice and efforts. And now he, the doer of it all, the man above all others who, speaking humanly, Providence should bless, is suddenly smitten, not only by the Chasdim and Sabaeans, mere human foes, but by heaven's elements, fire, and hurricane, and loathsome disease. What wonder, when his own wife said to him " Curse God and die," that those whom he had weaned from Baal Peor and Tammuz, seeing in their teacher one,
" Whom unmerciful disaster Followed fast and followed faster,
"
should regard his sufferings as the judgments of the gods whom he had dethroned, and deride their chief earthly benefactor as a false prophet and a fit victim of the anger of outraged deity !
Even the four friends, who had not lost their faith in God, could not understand the succession of strokes, save as acts of punish
ment for sin committed, for history, down to their time, presented no parallel case ; and, long since their time, the world has been slow to comprehend, or rather to apprehend, the great problem
=* Job XXX. 3-9.



166 THE HITTITES.
of the permission of evil, physical as well as spiritual, in the earth, a cause of suffering to God and man, and thus to those who are God's men as well as to the rest of humanity. Job saw his God dishonoured and his great work nigh to dissolution. The chief councillors among the kings stood aloof from his sick-bed ; Regem and Hadad, and Gedor, and Netophath, and Pelet, were unrepresented even by members of their tribes. The League was a rope of sand. Add the story of Hiawatha to that of Job, and some idea may be formed of the poignancy of the great statesman's anguish. Could he but have seen himself down the ages as an Ob or Fetish man, the chief represe;itative of that devil worship his soul abhorred, he would have had yet greater cause to lament the day on which he was born. It was his revived greatness that brought this change about, and made him an object of superstitious adoration. The Lesghian Andi seem to be the only people among the northern Khitan who made him their supreme god under the name of Zob, but the Latin Jove is likely the same word, picked up from the Hittite Opici of Campania. That doubtful honour was conferred more largely upon his father Paseach and his son Hanoch. as the Circassian Pkhah, the Lesghian Betschet, the Mordwin Paas and Shkipaas.the MavskokiEfikisa.and the Peruvian Apachic; and as the Circassian Antsha, Basque Jainko, and Koriak Angan. Zophar the Naamathite, the son of Nacham, or Nagam, who was the father of Keilah, or Kagilah the Garmite, is mentioned by Apollonius of Rhodes, who calls him Nasammon Caphareus.^ Apollonius makes a nymph Acacallis, who is Kagilah,. the mother by Apollo of Garamas, who is Garmi, the son of Kagilah ; and this Garamas is the father of Nasammon Caphareus, or Zophar, the son of Nacham. The Abb6 Santa Maria picked up some remarkable genealogies in Senegambia relating to the history of the ancient world, which contain elements of truth mingled with much fable or confusion of fact. In one of his Egyptian dynasties he has the name Kaphranahom, but, unhappily, it is in the midst of elements having no connection with the Zocharite
line.* It is useful, however, as showing the constant association

of Zophar and Naham as in Nasammon Caphareus, and indicates that Capernaum, or Capharnaum, preserved the name of the friend of the patriarch, as the Carian Bargylia became a memorial of
Barachel the Buzite. Apollonius finds his Acacallis, Garamas, and Nasammon Caphareus in Cyrene, which is full of traces of the tribe of Zochar, but which was also a genuine Greek colony founded by the Ekronites or Buzites. The story of this colony told by the father of history, in which Battus represents a Buz,
and Arcesilaus, a related Aharhel, is in entire consistency with
the union of the three lines set forth in the fifth chapter of First
Chronicles ; but to follow out every trail indicated in the march
of early Hittite history would be to tell the story of all the
ancient world.^ Job, in all probability, removed from Oboth in the land of Uz to Memphis in Egypt, where his father was honoured as Pthah, and himself, perhaps, as Hapi the god of the Nile. His family was one of river namers. In northern Syria, Paseach's name was given to the Orontes as the ThapsacuS; and the Assyrian Physcus, on which Opis was situated, honoured him. Hanoch or Chanoch named the Ganges, the Yenisei, and the Canienga or Mohawk river in the State of New York. So Job replaced the Nahaliel or Nile name derived from Jehaleleel with his own as Hapi. Far away in Siberia it was transported to name the Obi, and in the New World the Ohio was originally the beautiful mouth. The removal to Egypt took place in the reign of Jabez, who gathered around his court a galaxy of noble men. In Memphis proper or in the military suburb of Sakkara, Aharhel the son of Harum married Job's grand-daughter, the daughter of his son Hanoch and sister of the elder Joel, from whom descended in successive generations Shemaiah, Gog, Shimei, Micah, Reaiah, Baal and Beerah.^ But the son of Aharhel was
the younger Joel named after his maternal uncle, a true Hyllus, son of Hercules, and his son was Shema the father of Azaz and the grandfather of Bela.'^ These twin lines of Paseach and Regem were, with the Buzites of Eker, the wise men of the
5 Herodot. iv. 154 ; 1 Chron. v. 6 1 Chron. v. 4. 7 1 Chron. v. 8.



158 THE HITTITES.
Hycsos line, and the soldiers who gave it victory for a century over all its foes. By the commingling of the two stories, known among the Greeks as the Trojan War and The Seven against Thebes, in British tradition, the posterity of Hanoch became the Saxon Hengist, enemy of Hadar or Eidiol, confused with Conan Meriadawc, or Baalchanan the holder of sovereignty in Gebalene. When Philistim and Caphtorim were at length driven out of the land of the Pharaohs, the three races, leaving a body of Ekronites in Philistia and the plains of Sharon to the north of it, made their way to Bashan, the old home of the Paseachites, and there began the foundation of that Hittite sovereignty which Carchemish and Thapsacus presided over in Mesopotamia and Syria. There is one fact associated with this abode of the tribes
that the historian can hardly record without regret ; it is that Og or Gog, for the name begins with an ay in, the King of Bashan who fell by the arms of Joshua, was of the line of Paseach and Job, for in no other connection does the name occur, and the testimony is clear that he who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei was of the remnant of the Rephaim. Yet this Og can hardly have been the Gog of the genealogy, who, unless some generations containing names of no historical importance have been suppressed, is the fourth in descent from Job. Gog may, however, be the first Lydian Gyges, the contemporary and friend of Magnes, who is Meon or Megon the great-grandson of Hebron the son of Mareshah, and the father of Beth Zur. The traditions of Job, or, to use the Iroquois name, Hiawatha, must have survived among these men of Bashan constituting the strength of the Hittite tribes, as by them they were led to seek continually the revival and extension of their confederacy. For the history of the Hittites in Canaan and the neighbouring countries prior to the conquest of Joshua, the Egyptian monuments are the chief authority. Without their aid, tradition could only furnish vague conjecture. Unhappily, however, there are no Egyptian records of conquest in Palestine giving definite
information before the reign of Israel's oppressor, the third Thothmes and second Rameses. In an inscription of Una, a high officer of Teta and Pepi Merenra, the Amu of the Herusha are spoken of as an inimical and conquered people, but the region



THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 159
occupied by them is not indicated. The conjunction of the names Amu and Herusha suggests the Ma Reshethites of the Emim, who were no doubt enemies of Hadad ; but their being mentioned along with the land of Khent or Kenuz and with the
negroes, makes the identification doubtful.^ The first inscription that records northern warfare is that of Aahmes the son of Bana. His father, Bana, son of Reant, had been an officer of Sekenen Ra of the ancient line of Jaaken, who alone disputed sovereignty with the great Aahpeti. Aahmes entered the service of Neb-Pehti-Ra, who should from his name be Ziph the grandson of Jabez or Aahpeti, but who is generally made the same as Aahmes or Mesha, the father of Ziph. He also served under Amenophis I. or Meonothai, the adopted son of Mesha, and under Thothmes I. or the first Tahath, who was Mesha's nephew, being the son of Bered and a daughter of Jabez. All of these so-called kings were vicegerents under Jabez who survived them. It follows that the war in which Aahmes took part was not carried on against the Hycsos, inasmuch as Jabez was himself the chief Hycsos Pharaoh. He fought in Nubia and apparently against the revolting Kenezzites of that region, but his chief campaign was at Avaris where warfare was carried on by land and by water. The name of the enemy who had taken possession of Avaris is not mentioned, but as a later campaign was made in Mesopotamia against the Rutennu, and as Shaihana, supposed to be Sharuhen in southern Palestine, was a city to which the expelled from Avaris were followed, a city that lay within the domain of the Geshurites, the inference is that the Zerethites or Cherethites were the offenders, an inference justified by the maritime superiority of that people.^ The Zerethites had been expelled from Egypt shortly after the reign of Ziph or Cheops, and their fortunes had been shared by part of the family of the Kenite Ezra or Gezra, which had been allied with them through the union of Ezra's son, .Mered, to Bithia the daughter of Cheops. Thus the Geshurites descended from the Cherethite Jesher, the Gezrites of Ezra, and the Amale kites, were the chief occupants of southern Palestine during the Hycsos or Achuza

160 THE HITTITES.
mite rule in Egyyt. Sisyphus made another attempt to ascend the hill of Egyptian sovereignty. In the language of the
Hittites this attempt would be represented as a rolling of the ball towards the goal of the enemy, for much of their historical imagery is taken from the national game played still in the Pyrenees, on the plains of Siberia, in Japan, and all over the North American continent, and popularly known as Lacrosse. The Quiche traditions frequently set forth warlike contests as
games of ball. The Z(*rethites then had summoned the players, including the descendants of Zabu and Apil Sin, the Asherites or Assuru of Assyria, the men of Ardon or the Rutennu of Mesopotamia, their brethren, the Geshurites of the south, the Midianites or Zimrites preparing to ascend the throne of Gebalene, the Gezrites of Kenite birth, and the Amalekites whose supremacy as the first of the nations was gone ; and with these they tossed the ball of defiance towards the Hycsos goal of Avaris. Between
the Arish and Avaris lay the men of Rosh, descendants of Mareshah and 8ons of Hebron, and near at hand were the Heraclidae descended from Regem, the Maachathites of Pelet, and the Goshenites of Geshan. These defenders of Egypt could not withstand the shock of the men of the north ; they were driven back before the players of the game of death, and reached Avaris, the stronghold of the empire, only in time to find the
Cherethite fleet in occupation of the city. Thus the stone was rolled up, and the ball planted in the enemy's goal. But Sisyphus was to meet Sisyphus. Another Ziph, a second Typhon, grandson of Aahpeti, stemmed the invading tide by land and sea, and the pestilence was.driven out of Avaris and back to its Palestinian home. The revenge game was well played, and the Hycsos ball went triumphantly through and through the goals of Cherethite ambition and sovereignty. This was probably the time when the Rosh, smarting under recent defeat, captured Kirjath Arba and called it Hebron after the son of their eponym, when Tappuah, Maon, and Beth Zur, were colonized or garrisoned by them, and when they planted Mareshah in the vicinity of Sharuhen, with Kubeibeh near at hand to mark the ancient friendship between that hero and Zobebah the mother of Jabez, their Pharaoh. The Captain General of marines followed the



THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 161
"victorious Egyptian armies northward into Mesopotamia, and helped to smite the Cherethite Rutennu in that distant land. This appears to have been the chief disturbing event in the long reign of Jabez. In it also may be seen the beginning of the long struggle between barbaric cruelty and superstition and the principles of enlightenment and humanity, which marked the life of Saul of Rehoboth, after whose death the Zerethite became triumphant, and, under the son of Achbor, stained all the altars of Palestine with the blood of human victims. The Dardanian war that followed was more than a quarrel over a faithless woman ; it was a contest between light and darkness, a religious war fraught with the most momentous consequences to the human race. Had Sisyphus, lord of Assyria, Babylonia, and Palestine, succeeded in rolling his stone up the pyramids and in planting it
there, had the tribes of Tollan driven their ball through the Chichimec goal, the world would have fallen under the domination of the most bloodthirsty race that ever disgraced humanity, and have been bound in the chains of the vilest .superstition
that ever fettered the soul of man. Thanks to young Ziph and the long-suffering Saul and the gallant warrior Hadar, the Zerethite power of darkness was repelled, again and again, in its attempts at Egyptian conquest, and was banished from the soil of Palestine. But the atrocities committed by the great Assyrian conquerors in after days prove that the murderous spirit was not
extinct in the Cherethite. Aahmes, the marine, connects the name of Thothmes I., who is Tahath, son of Bered, and grandson of Jabez through his mother whom the Greeks call Sthenoboea and the Persians Sendabeh, with the conquest of Mesopotamia and overthrow of the Rutennu; and his calling Neb-Pehti the justified shows that Ziph had died before this final overthrow took place. Another Aahmes surnamed Pennishem had been a follower of Ziph in his northern campaign and of Thothmes in Mesopotamia, where he took twenty-one hands of warriors killed by him, for which he was rewarded with gold armlets, collars, bracelets, an ornamented sword, and two gold war axes.^'' Under the second

daughter of Mezahab, he fought against the Shasu or Shuhites, the race to which Ma Reshah belonged. These, however, must be the Shuhites who remained behind in tlie land of Moab and in Jashubi-Lehem, the linen workers, potters and gardeners of these countries. These Shuhites probably shared the fortunes of the Zerethites, for their home was in Mesopotamia, south of the Nairi, and in Babylonia, in early Assyrian days. They were in two divisions, the elder branch, descended from Er the father of Leeah, being the Lakai of the Assyrian inscriptions, and the junior, comprising the posterity of Ashbea, Jokim, Chozebah, Joash, and Saraph, being the Sukhi or Shuhites proper, of the same documents. They are often connected with the Amalekites, with whom they may have made common cause against the Egyptians in the Sinaitic peninsula. They appear to have been
a feeble folk, for Aahmes Pennishem took so many prisoners of the Shasu that he did not care to reckon them. But he received a silver war axe, with more bracelets and collars, for his conduct
in the Shuhite campaign. These cultivated Shuhites, the first to excel in the useful arts, became the savage and intractable Sacae of later generations. Thothmes II. fought no doubt the battles of Mezahab, his father-in-law, and in the same service must Amenophis II. or Ophrah have made the campaign recorded bj'^ him in the temple of Amada in Nubia. The campaign was in the land of Asshur, from which he brought the bodies of seven slain kings, one of which was set up at HHapata to let the negroes see the prowess of their monarch, but the other six were suspended on the walls of Thebes, an evidence that the line of Jabez was still in power in the city of No-Amnion. Then came a period of anarchy in Egypt. Mezahab died or disappeared, but the Hycsos would not acknowledge Tahath as their king. With Ophrah of Elephantine and Saul of Abydos, the husband of Matred fought against the Thebans, but suffered disaster at the hands of the gallant Philistines and the Heraclidae and descendants of Paseach, who bore arms with them. Saul tranquilized Gebalene for a time, but who can tell what hordes from western Palestine poured in upon Lower Egypt during the period that the struggle lasted in the south ? Certain it is that the
Zerethites won Back their possessions in Palestine, and set up

their strongholds on the eastern shores of the Dead Sea, They retook Hebron and called it Kirjath Arba. But there is no record, save that which Josephus preserves from Manetho, which gives any information concerning the tumultuary army that invaded Upper Egypt and drove the kings of that country into Ethiopia. Josephus calls their leader Osarsiph, a priest of Heliopolis, and identifies him with Moses. It has been already suggested that the name may be a corruption of Zur-vuna or Beth Zur, the descendant of Ma Reshah, which, if it were estab
lished, would make the army of iconoclasts the raisers of the
siege of Thebes instead of an invading host from Palestine. When Saul died, the Zerethites and Zimrites got the upper hand in Moab and Canaan. The Hittite tribes were in a measure
subject to Baalchanan, his successor, as king of Gebalene, but they owed immediate allegiance, not to that prince, but to his father Achbor, known in Babylonian history as Isbi-barra, king of
Karrak, in Egyptian as Sapalala, or Seplul, grand duke of the Kheta, and in India as Sisupula, king of Chedi. Indian history makes him subject to Jarashandha, who is Baalchanan. From
indications given in British tradition, as well as by his residence at Karrak, Achbor is authenticated as a Temanite or Amalekite,. in the language of Merlin, an Albanian. While Achbor presided
over the council of the allied Hittite chiefs, and his son, Baalchanan, exercised depotism in Gebalene, a young warrior arose in. southern Egypt, whose career has been already sketched, Hadar,
the son of Saul. Summoning his faithful and warlike Beerothites, he went to the help of Thothmes, whose daughter, Mehetabel, he married, and gained over to the side of that monarch his brotherin-law, Michael of Xois. Tha Kenezzites under Ophrah, or his son Ishgi, swelled the army of Thothmes, who, with three kings in his train, once more besieged Thebes, and this time successfully. Philistim and Caphtorim capitulated and then, step by step, they were driven northward by the ever victorious Hadar, hardly recoofnized on the monuments as Thothmes IV. Then Thothmes II. assumed, as the head of a new Egyptian dynasty, the title of Rameses I. As such it is stated at Kafnak that he was the first
to seek out the Hittites in the valley of the Orontes, where he
made a treaty of peace with their king, Seplul, or Achbor. The

Orontes is a mistake, and cannot possibly be the place or river
called Hanruta. In the case of Rameses L, if it denote a river, it is probably the Arnon in Moab, some of the southern streams of which are not far from Zerkeh and Kerak, where Achbor held state, within easy distance of the Jebel el Tarfuyeh, or original
Delphi. There is no record of any fighting on this occasion. Philistim and Caphtorim were quite enough to keep Rameses engaged, so that the treaty between him and Seplul, brought about throuffh the good offices of Hadar and Michael, and of the Kenezzite Ishgi who took home to Elephantine the fair-haired
and blue-eyed Zimrite princess Taia, was formed for the purpose of keeping the Hycsos Hittites and their Japhetic defenders in check. The Zerethites remembered how the line of Jabez had driven their ancestors of the family of Cheops from the throne of Memphis, how Ziph, or Neb-Pehti, had repelled them in their attempt to regain the valley of the Nile, and how the descendants of MaReshah had overspread southern Palestine and made their colonial metropolis in Hebron. There was, therefore, no love lost between these Zerethites and the expelled from Egypt, who now lay between them and the land of the Pharaohs, all the way from Hazerim in the wilderness to Gaza, in which country they had wreaked their vengeance on the Kenezzites who had helped to drive them out by exterminating their relatives the Avim. This act of vengeance on the worshi|»pers of Baal Peor would constitute another reason for enmity between these two branches of the Hittite race.
Rameses I. died, and the reign of young Rameses IL, otherwise Thothmes III., began, and Hadar as Thothmes IV. fought the battles of the enslaver of Israel^ aided by his wife, Mehetabel, the Queen Regent. Were it not for tradition it would be impossible to construct the history of Hittite Palestine from the Egyptian monuments, for Rameses IL industriously ijhiselled out the name of his sister and her husband on the monuments they erected, and ascribed their warlike achievements to his boastful self.^^ The great event of Hadar's life was the Zerethite, or Dardanian, war, wjiich placed him on the throne of Gebalene, commonly known as the Siege of Troy ; which, as told by Homer,
11 Rawlinson's Herodotus, app. bk. ii. ch. 8.



THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 165
grotesquely mixes up persons, places, and dates, in immortal verse. Yet the ground-work is well vouched for by many widely separated traditions in Greece, India, Britain, and in the New World.
As a result of the pacification that took place when Rameses made his treaty with Seplul, or Achbor, his son Baalchanan king of
Gebalene, visited Michael, the brother-in-law of Hadar, in his Xoite kingdom, and requited his host's hospitality by carrying awaj'' his bride, whom the widely divergent Greek and British traditions concur in calling Helen. Baalchanan, the Parisian, as a descendant of Peresh the Gileadite, and an Alexander, as the Harischandra of the Indian writers, thus combined in himself the persons of Priam and his son. This outrage called Michael and Hadar to arms, and with Hadar went his son Shimon, the Agamemnon of the Greeks. So far as can be gathered from tradition, for no published Egyptian text gives the history of this war, Hadar and Michael were aided by the Philistines and the expelled Caphtorim, including the Amraono-Hittite line of Jabez soon to be known as Moschi and Cappadociq,ns, the direct Achuzamite line of Acharchel or men of Carchemish, the Rosh of MaReshah, the Paseachites descended from Job, and the Maachathites of Pelet's son, Maachah. Hadar's victory had the effect of driving all the Zerethites, with the exception of those who dwelt on the borders of Egypt, and who, if Homer's Catalogue of the Ships is to be relied on, fought as Cretans against their Dardanian brethren, out of southern Palestine. Another exception is Anak, the son of Arba, who held out in the city of Hebron. The Geshurites took refuge for a time in the Hauran, but most of the Zerethites betook themselves to Assyria, where their family was still supreme.
Hadar reigned in Edom, its last king, for during his reign, or at
its close, a band of invaders, whose home is hard to determine, entered the land of Moab. They are called Hornets in the translations of the Hebrew Scriptures, because that is the Hebrew meaning of their name, but the word variously rendered Zorite, Zorathite, Zareathite, denotes the people who founded Zorah, on
the borders of Philistia.^^ They were Horites, or Amorites, descended from Reaiah and Manahath, the principal sons of the ances

166 THE HITTITES.
tral Shobal, and allied with the family of Bethlehem, descended from Manahath's grandson, Chedorlaomer. The traditions which bring the Phoenicians from the islands and Arabian shores of
the Persian Gulf relate probably to these allied Horites, traces of whose presence are found in the geographical nomenclature of that region. Pressed upon by other tribes, Ishmaehite and Midianite, they made their way northward, and came in countless swarms into the land vacated by the Zerethites. But they did not come alone ; the Moabite and the Ammonite accompanied them. Michael was the last of the Xoite dynasty, and if we are to credit the Maya legends, the Moabites were his subjects in the Delta. Whether they were expelled by Rameses, or were transported by Hadar to the land they had helped him to acquire or voluntarily left their home in the Delta for a pleasanter abode among the rivers that flow into the Dead Sea and the Jordan, we cannot tell. But they came, the Ammonites to the old dwelling place of the Zuzim . in Ham, and the Moabites, separating from their tyrannical brethren to begin a national life, in the land so well identified with their name ; while, all around them, swarmed the Amorite Zorathites. Moab and Amnion were strong enough to resist the attempts of the Hornets to displace them, but Zippor, king of Moab, could not prevent the southern Amorites depriving him of part of his territory. Moses has preserved the Amorite
war-song that celebrates this conquest
:
" Come into Heshbon, Let the city of Sihon be built and prepared
;
For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon
;
It hath consumed Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of Arnon. Woe to thee, Moab
!
Thou art undone, people of Chemosh
;
He hath given his sons that escaped and his daughters Into captivity unto Sihon, the Amorite king. We have shot at them
;
Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, We have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba." ^^
IS Numb. xxi. 27.



THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 167
The name of Heshbon is associated with that of Bishban, a son of Dishon. the Horite.^* Another band of Amorites entered Gilead and Bashan, but they do not seem to have exercised royalty there, for, when Israel conquered Canaan, their king was Og, or Gog, of the family of Paseach. They must, however, have contributed largely to the population and soldiery of the Paseachite kingdom,
as O2 is called the king of the Amorites.^"'' Crossing the Jordan into Canaan, the Amorites swept all before them to the borders of the Philistines, and even planted Zorah and Eshtaol in the midst of that warlike people. They drove the Hittites out of Beeroth, Hebron and Lachish, and perhaps from Jarmuth, although it is more probable that it was a Jerahmeelite city. The solitary Amorite king of Jerusalem, whom the sacred character of his city had invested with respect and granted immunity from conquest, hailed the restoration of Horite dominion, and in recompense for his welcome was recognized as the head of
the Amorite confederacy of kings. Then the Hittites suffered. Threescore and ten kings gathered the crumbs that fell from Adoni Bezek's table, mutilated men, whose miserable imprisonment enhanced the warlike reputation of the Amorite monarch ; and most of these, if not all, were Hittites. The Anakim alone remained in the neighbourhood of Hebron, in which the Amorite Hoham reigned, and the rest of the Hittites were to be found north of Samaria. But there was a remnant, and, by no means a small one, of those who had long held Egyptian sovereignty, on the north-western or Libyan border of Egypt, among whom many tribes of Midian were found, and these were the ancestors of the Berber tribes of northern Africa. The centres of the Egyptian wars with the Hittites in the time of the great Rameses were Kadesh Naphtali above the Sea of Galilee, and Megiddo on the river Kishon. Both of these were Achuzamite foundations, the former being named after the ancestral Gazez, the father of Jachdai, and
the latter, after Maachah, Jachdai's grandson. They were thus associated with the leading Hittite tribe, which afterwards made Carchemish the seat of its authority. Yet Kadesh was a name intimately connected with the Amalekites, in whose tribe the
" Gen. xxxvi. 26. 15 Josh. ii. 10.



168 THE HITTITES.
kingship or presidency of the Hittite confederacy was at this
time vested.^'^ The son and successor of Seplul as head of the Confederacy was, according to the Egyptian monuments, Marasara, and he was followed in succession by his two sons, Mautenara and Khitasara.^^ It has been already stated that Seplul, the Kenite Gachbor and Babylonian Isbi-barra, was an Amalekite. A text of Sennacherib, which mentions Ispabara, king of Illipi or Albania, and his city, Akupardu, confirms this ftict. But that same
text links with Akupardu another city, called Marugarti.^'* There is only one other geographical name belonging to the Hittites men
tioned in the Assyrian inscriptions that comes as near as Marugarti does to Marasara, and that is Mairsuru, which is probably the same place, for, although Shalmanezer assigns it to Kharru and not to Albania, the Cyrus river, which bears the name Kharru, constituted Albania's southern boundary.^® It seems that Mair
suru comes nearest to the original name, for among the Alani, who were descendants of Elon the Amalekite, appears a king Beorgerj whom Cassiodorus mentions as an invader of northern Italy.20 But for a remarkable fragment of ancient history preserved by Herodotus, we should have had to look in vain for definite traces of Khitasara, Marasara's son. Herodotus calls him
Cytissorus, but makes him the son of Phrixus the Colchian, a name that only connects with the Amalekite family in the person of Peresh the Gilea<lite, through whose descendants Baalchanan, son of Achbor, inherited the Dardanian throne.*^^ Strabo quotes Ephorus to the effect that this son of Phrixus, whose name he abbreviates to Cytorus, was the eponym of Cytorum in Paphlagonia, a place mentioned by Homer in his enumeration of the Trojan forces,^^ The Temenite, or Amalekite, origin of the Paphlagonians has been already indicated. Few statements better display the remoteness of Homer from the events he professes to relate than those regarding the Paphlagonians. The very name

Paphlagonia is a corruption of the name of that Baalehanan out of whom he makes Priam and Alexander Paris ; but not content with this, he repeats the perfidious Dardanian as Pylaemenes, the Paphlagonian leader, and makes him possess Cytorus, a place named after a hero who can have been but a child in Baalchanan's time. Still further does the poet make the Amalekites do the duty of a stage army in giving them, as Alazonians from Alybe, Hodius and Epistrophus for their commanders. Valuable as the poems of Homer are for suggestions, they are utterly untrust
worthy as narratives of fact. Professor Rawlinson thus translates the tradition which Herodotus records concerning Cytissorus. " On his (Xerxes) arrival at Alus in Achaea, his guides, wishing to inform him of everything, told him the tale known to the dwellers in those
parts concerning the temple of the Laphystian Jupiter—how that Athamas the son of ^olus took counsel with Ino and plotted the death of Phrixus ; and how that afterwards the
Achaeans, warned by an oracle, laid a forfeit upon his posterity,
forbidding the eldest of the race ever to enter into the courthouse (which they call the people's house) and keeping watch themselves to see the law obeyed. If one comes within the doors, he can never go out again except to be sacrificed. Further, they told him, how that many persons, when on the point of being slain, are seized with such fear that they flee away and take refuge in some other country ; and that these if they come back long afterwards, and are found to be the persons who entered the court-house, are led forth covered with chaplets, and
in a grand procession, and are sacrificed. This forfeit is paid by
the descendants of Cytissorus the son of Phrixus, because, when the Achaeans in obedience to an oracle made Athamas the son of ^olus their sin-ofFering and were about to slay him, Cytissorus came from Aea in Colchis and rescued Athamas, by which deed he brought the anger of the god upon his own posterity."^^ This extraordinary story belongs clearly to the Amalekites, who> through their King Husham, acquired in addition to their other names that of Os, Ossetes, Huzites, or Achaeans, and their Alus is a reminiscence of Elon. The Laphystian Jupiter must, there

fore, take his name from the Amalekite Eliphaz, and his temple connected with a court-house or house of the people must be the same place as the original Delphi of the Amphictyonic League on the Jebel el Tarfuyeh in Moab. There also was what the Iroquois call The Long House, which gave name to the whole confederacy, who are Hodenosaunee or the People of the Long House.2* The connection of Athamas, Ino Leucothea, Phrixus,
and Cytissorus, is, however, obscure. Athamas is Etam, the father of Jezreel, who is associated with the rest simply by the marriage of Mahalah, the third son of Moleketh, or Ino Leucothea, to a member of his family, probably a daughter of Jezreel. Phrixus, again, is Peresh, the son of Gilead, and thus the nephew of Moleketh. As for Cytissorus or Khitasara, who is long posterior to the others, a wife of his grandfather, Achbor, was in all probability a grand-daughter of Peresh, through whom her eldest son, Baalchanan, inherited the Cymro-Dardanian throne. Pausanias mentions the Laphystian Jupiter in Amphictyonic connection, and states that when Athamas was about to sacrifice Phrixus and Helle, the sons of this god sent a ram with a golden
fleece which carried them away.^ The story refers to an aboli
tion of the human sacrifices that had been instituted in the time of Samlah of Masrekah, in connection with the act of impiety that led to the mourning of Meholah ; and to their reinstitution at some period subsequent to the rule of Khitasara over the Hittite confederacy. It would appear, therefore, that, whatever
sanguinary rites were observed by individual Hittite families,
such as the Zerethites, the Rephaim and the Kenezzites, these were not sanctioned nor practised by the League, since the time that Job and his coadjutors established it down to the time of the death of Khitasara, the last Hittite suzerain mentioned by the Egyptians. The next head of the League, whose name history records, is Jabin, who held court at Hazor. His name and surroundings in Hazor connect him with the tribe of Zochar, which in his person first emerges from obscurity.

enslaver of Israel comprise thdse attributed to Thothrnes III., Rameses II., Amenophis III., and Seti Menephtah ; the first two being names of Beriah, and the others denoting Shimon and Zoheth. These invaders of Palestine were at peace with the Amorites who occupied .the south country, for we read of no opposition offered by them to the progress of the Egyptian armies. Rameses was himself an Amorite and bore the name of Ra, ancestral and divine among the Horites. Under the name of
Thothmes III. he records his victories over the Hittites in two
regions, Memddo and Kadesh ; but the latter he rejjarded as the
Hittite capital.-'' It must, therefore, have been the stronghold of the suzerain whose name he does not give, but who was either Marasara, son of Seplul, or his eldest son Mautenara. In Megiddo the descendants of Pelet dwelt with the allied Jezreelites.
The Kenite list oifly mentions the third generation from Pelet in the lines of Shaaph and Sheva, sons of Maachah, their sons being Madmannah and Machbenah.^'' There is geographical evidence that these Maachathites once dwelt in Moab, for Madmen in that, country is a reminiscence of Madmannah, as well as Methymna in Lesbos. Dimnah and Dimon represent the same name, for the initial -ma is the Hittite honorific prefijc ; in the same way Machbenah is rendered by Cabbon. The men of Maachath or Megiddo became famous in India as the Magadhas, and in Siberia the elder sons Sheber and Tirchanah named Sibir and Turuchansk. Kadesh has been identified with Kadesh Naphtali. When Seti Menephtah invaded Palestine, he found this city in the possession of the Amorites. How they obtained it we cannot tell. It may have been by force of arms, but it is more probable that when Beriah took the city he placed it in charge of an Amorite garrison, thus expelling Mautenara the Hittite king
from his capital. Seti was a Hittite and was far from being ashamed of his parentage. He saw that no good could come to Egypt by harassing the tribes of his own blood and speech, and accordingly sought to make peace with them. But there could be no peace while the hated Amorite dwelt in the Hittite sanctuary. Seti commanded the Amorites to evacuate Kadesh, which

they refused to do. Then a fierce contest took place, in which
Kadesh was at last carried by assault, the Amorites driven out,
and Mautenara restored to the seat of empire. A treaty was afterwards concluded, in terras of which Mautenara promised not
to engage in hostilities against the Egyptians. Rameses II. fought a battle at Kadesh which is set forth in the Third Sallier Papyrus written by the roj^al scribe, Pentaour, and in the battle pieces of that Pharaoh at Thebes and Ipsamboul. It is described at full length, the object being to glorify the valour of Rameses, and, therefore, presents many particulars which do not appear in the other documents. It took place in Rameses' fifth year which
was probably the fifth of his sole reign after the death of hia sister Mehetabel.^^ Thothmes III. fought his battle of Kadesh in the twenty-third year of his reign including his minority, and
it was his first action. It* we identify Thothmes III. with
Rameses II., this will give Mehetabel a regenc3'^of eighteen years» Her sixteenth year has been found recorded at the Wady Magliara and on the great obelisk at Karnak.'^^ Mautenara was King of the Hittite Confederacy in this war, which must, therefore, precede the treaty of peace which Set! Menephtah made with him, and which there is no evidence that he failed to keep, Seti's pacification did not last long, for Mautenara died, and his brother, Khitasara, became the Hittite suzerain. He resumed warfare, which lasted fourteen years and came to an end by a treaty of peace, the text of which has been preserved in a somewhat imperfect state, and by an alliance of Rameses with a daughter of the Hittite emperor.^
The story of Rameses' battle and siege of Kadesh should be
studied as a companion picture to that set forth in the eleventh chapter of Joshua, which contains the account of a war with the same Hittite Confederacy a century later. If Kadesh be regarded as a city on the Orontes, the Hittites must have reconquered northern Palestine in the interval, for Joshua found them as far south as
Samaria. But there is no evidence that these Hittites were ever

-driven into the north, before the leader of Israel's host broke their power at the waters of Merora. Even after this crushing •defeat they did not withdraw to any great distance, for early in the times of the Judges they reappeared under a second Jabin at Harosheth, not far from the springs of the Jordan.^^ The Kadesh of Thothmes III., Seti Menephtah, and Rameses II., is, therefore, Kadesh afterwards called Naphtali, south of Hazor, to the west of Jordan, and about midway between Lake Merom and the Sea of Galilee. The Third Sallier Papyrus places Kadesh in the vicinity of Shabutuna, and the land of the Amairo or Amorites. The former is Safed, south of Kadesh Naphtali, and the land of the Amorites through which the Egyptian army probably marched into the north was the country east of Jordan. There is no evidence for an Amorite colony on the Orontes. The names of King Mautenara's allies are somewhat differently read by the
Egyptologists, and. most of these place the allies in Syria and Mesopotamia by the error common to almost all readers of ancient historical documents, that of identifying a shifting people with the most famous locality bearing their name. Thus the Zerethites of Zarthan, mentioned on Egyptian iTionuments, have been called Dardanians from Troy and Sardinians from Sardinia and Cretans from Crete, instead of being regarded as the Palestinian parent-stock by which these three regions were colonized. Mautenara was King of the Kheta or Hittites, and most of his
so-called allies were his confederate Hittite lords. The first people mentioned among his followers are the Naharain. These were the descendants of Mehir of the family of the Achashtarite Chelub, in the three families of Beth Rapha, Paseach, and Tehinnah, the father of Ir Nahash, among whom Paseach occupied in Assyrian days the chief position. But in Pentaour's list of
the warriors, Patasa or Pidasa represents Paseach. It is doubtful that the Nairi had yet reached Mesopotamia, or that the Paseachites, so lately out of Egypt, had established themselves in Thapsacus. The valley of Jiphthach-el on the borders of Asher and Zebulon is more likely to have been the abode of the Paseachites. The Nairi or Naharina may also be looked for at Mearah, Mearoth. or, giving value to ayin, Megarah, near Sidon,

174 THE HITTITES.
where Misrephoth represented flammu-Rabi or Beth Rapba, as Masrekah set forth the family of Rekah. Terteni, another Hittite tribe, was a branch of the Zerethites at Zarthan. The Maasu were the Meishga or Moschi, the descendants of Mesha, the son of Jabez, and probably dwelt about Thebez, north-east of Samaria, built by them to commemorate their great city in Egypt. Mauna is a northern Maon and belonged to the family of Ma Reshah. It may have been beyond Jordan in the land of Ham near Ammon, where the Maonites were smitten in the time of Hezekiah by the descendants of a certain Simeon.^^ There was
also a Beth B^ial Meon in Moab. The Leka, originally inhabitants of Lachish, were at this time in Kadesh itself and in the Mount of the Amalekites in Ephraim. The name Amalek or Gama Lek is like the Akkadian form of Beth Rapha, GammuRabi. Kerkesh may have been Chelkath or Helkath in Asher, a place of note, the ethnic relations of which are undetermined. Kairkamasha is plainly C»irchemish, but was it Carchemish far up in nortliern Syria ? If it was, there is evidence in favour of Kadesh being up there also. But the Kairkamasha are mentioned with the Leka, who certainly were not in northern Syria. As in Ephraim there was a mount of the Gama-Lek so was there a mount Gerizim, and its enclosure or city would be an ancient
Gerizim-ish. Katsuatana is yet unidentified. Mashanat was
doubtless in the neighbourhood of Ophrah of the Abiezrites, for Meonothai or Megonothai was the father of the former and the son of Abiezer. Anaukasa may have been Ta Anach near Megiddo, in which case Akarith or Akalith would be Chesulloth. to the south of it. The first belonged to the family of Paseach ; but the second was a city of the Goim of Galilee, who appear to have been called Kati by the Egyptians. Khilbu or Chirabu has been identified with Aleppo which was indeed a Khilbu ; but there was a Helbah or Chelbah in the north of the tribe of Asher, out of which Israel did not succeed in driving the
aborigines, and this suits the case better. Finally, Arethu, if in it Aradus be recognized, was the most northern of the Hittite royal cities. The Hittite army thus presented a confederation
32 1 Chron. iv. 41 ; the English version, which must translate every word, knows the Maonites as " the habitations."



THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 175
consisting of the Achuzamites of Gerizim and Mesha, the Hepherites of Ai'ad, the Temenites of Kadesh and Amalek, the Achashtarites of Mehir and of Maon, the Zerethites of Zarthan, (unless the Terteni be the Tirhanites of Maachah), the Zocharites of Chelbah, and the Ethnanites of Megonothai. Thus all the seven families were represented in the League, which, like that overcome by Joshua, received assistance from the Japhetic Goim
of Galilee.
The names of the warriors mentioned are Hittite, some of them ending like Marasara and Khitasara in the well-known word zari, meaning a captain or leader ; such are Khilip-sara and Sapt-sara. The former was probably the leader of the Calebites descended from Zochar, and the latter the lord of Safed called after Shaphat, who seems to have been a descendant of Aharhel, as-Sybotas is a name belong'ng to the Heraclidae, and Sybota in Epirus is associated with Ekronite and Heraclid names.^^ Two other names, Thargan and Thargannas, cannot be positively identified with Tirchanah the son of Maachah, because the Egyptians did not accentuate the gutturals cheth and ayin. Tilgamus, Telegonus, Telchin, and Tarquin, are names that set forth Regem, so that some later Regem or Rekem may have been thus designated. Still Thargannas might well answer to Tirchanah, and be the name of a man of Megiddo. Thargathasas is unmistakable, representing the Hamathite Tirgathi, and the Jerigoth whose union to the Zerethite Hur or Urukh crave to that tribe the ancestors of the Geshurites and Rutennu, The
name, therefore, may be either Hepherite or Zerethite. Thiatar is
a much disguised Hadadezer, in form like the Iroquois Atotarho, yet it is more correct than Tentyris or Tyndareus. He ought to have been the King of Rehob or Beth Rehob, in the tribe of Asher. Rabbasunna is a late Beth Rapha, the name being governed in the genitive by the word for house or family, in Japanese kanak So, in Esthonia, Lappi-gunda is a tribe of the old Esthonian league. His place should be in Mearah and Misrephoth. Tsuat-sasa ought to be the head of the Mashanat or people of Meonothai, for he is a Zoheth, perhaps Ben-Zoheth, the brother of Seti Menephtah, who as Poly-dectes was inimical

to Perseus and was put oiit of his kingdom. Paisa or Pisa is a Hittite name, the chief element in that of Pisiris or Pisa-sari King of Carchemish, but it was originally Japhetic, being Buz, the son or early descendant of Eker, after whom Pisa in Elis was called. It may, therefore, denote an Ekronite or a jnember of the allied families of Paseach and Aharhel, the latter of whom continued the line of Regem. Samarsa suggests Samlah, and Shimron as his city, and Carmel a Palestinian Camirus where he was worshipped, but this gives a division of the Rephaim, who have already been found farther north in Misrephoth. Garbatusa is like the Girbat in Ulam-Girbat, which would class it with ^imrite nomenclature, but again it answers to Sarepta and the Lycian Sarpedon, who belonged to the family of Beth-Lechem descended from Chareph. As Salma was the father of BethLechem, he may have ruled in Salem near Samaria. Matsrima is more probably IVIatslimaor Meshullam, an Ekronite ally of the
Hittites. Agma occurs in a Pictish inscription as Sakasa Agma.** It also appears in the Irish genealogies of the Tuatha de Danans, continually in connection with Dealbhaoith, an Irish Telephus, as Ogma.^ Thus Ogma is the name of the father, brother, and son of persons called Dealbhaoith. This makes Agma the same as the Kenite Husham, who was probably the father and the son of an Eliphaz. Finally Kamaits may be a Shemidah, connected with Shechem the son of Shemidag or Ismidagan, who renamed the Amorite city and established therein the worship of Baal
Berith.^^ These tentative identifications of the names of Hittite
places and persons will, at any rate, pave the way for their com
plete elucidation. The copy of the Treaty of Peace between Rameses and Khitasara, the new Hittite monarch, which is preserved on the outer wall of the temple at Kamak, is unhappily deficient at the
very place which contains matter of historical interest, that,
namely, which originally set forth the chief families of the Hittite confederacy and their deities.^^ The names that remain are Taaranta, Pairaka, Khisasap, Sarasu, Khirabu, Sarapaina,

Taitat or Zaiath-Klierri, and Tawatana. Of these the first is marked by the modern name Dourahin among the southern springs of the Kishon, and represents the Hittite Tirhanah named
after the second son of Maachah of Pelet, Megiddo being Maachah's memorial, and Tabor, that of Sheber the eldest son, in the same region.^^ Pairaka is probably Beeroth in Naphtali.and
at the same time designates the Rechabites descended from Beeri. The interchange of certain gutturals and dentals was not uncommon among Egyptian dialects, and at any rate the radical is not Beeroth but Beeri.^^ Many Hittite names resemble Khisasap, such as Chozeba, Gazubah, and Achshaph, but none of these perfectly transliterate the Egyptian word. If we suppose Achshaph to have been originally compounded of the Zuzimite name Shaaph or Shagaph, it would, as Achshagaph, answer to
Khisasap. The associations of this name or of its geographical neighbour Achzib, the Ecdippa of the Greeks, are set forth by Diodorus in connection with Rhodes, the island of the Telchins and Heliads, who were Ochimus, Cercaphus, Macareus, Actin,
TeneagCvS, Triopas, and Candales.*° Ochimus married Hegetoria a,nd had a daughter Gydippe, afterwards called Cyrbie, whom Cercaphus took to wife, her children being Lindus, Jalysus and Camirus. There is an extravagant mixing up of historical elements in this genealogy, but they centre geographically about Achzib and Gafmel. The Telchins are the Regemites ; Actin is probably Eshton, the son of Mechir or Macareus ; Triopas, like the Esthonian Tarapyha and Dorpat, is Beth Rapha ; and Teneages is Hanoch, son of Paseach, as Taanach near Megiddo. Ochimus must be Chusham or Husham the Amalekite, and the same as the Egyptian Agma ; Cercaphus is Rechab with a prefix
;
and Candales is a somewhat* inverted Othniel or Gothniel. Cydippe, as a woman, should be Gazuba the daughter of Hur and Jerigoth, married first to Regem and after his death to Rapha, her son being Samlah the Greek Camirus. Gazuba's name is thus common to two regions, that inhabited by the Harumites and Heraclidae descended from Regem, and that of the Rephaim

proper. As Sazabe it denoted in Assyrian days the garrison city of the Hittites dependent upon Carchemish. Sarasu undoubtedly is the same name as the Babylonian Karrak, and, therefore, denotes the Zerachites of Amalek, the Thracians of the Greeks
;
but it is without geographical representation in northern Pales
tine, unless Gergesa to the east of the Sea of Galilee be identified with it. Khirabu or Khilabu is Chelbah, and Sarapaina is Sarepta or Zarephath, which found its way among the Horite Phoenicians through the alliance of Chareph of Beth Gader with the Horite Manahath's daughter. In Taitat or Zaiath-Kherri there is no difficulty in recognizing Ben-Zocheth the brother of Seti Menephtah. As a locality it may denote Tahtim-Hodshi about the waters of Merom. The Egyptian kherri is the Georgian shiri, a son, Lesghian durrha, Basque haitrra. Thus Zaiath-Kherri is the same word as the Assyrian Sandu-arri and Sanda-sarvi, the latter form replacing aurra or haurra with the Circassian arps, Yeniseian dulbo and Aztec tetelpuch, which are the same in origin as the Basque nerabe and Loo Choo worrahi. This Zaiath-Kherri answers to the Iroquois Tehotennhiaron the opponent of Taronhiawagon, who is improperly made the same person as Tawiscara. Seti Menephtah in his invasion of the Hittite country probably met his brother Ben-Zoheth or Zaiath
Kherri, and made use of his influence among the Hittite lords for obtaining a peaceful settlement of difficulties between them and Egypt. At the same time he must have caused the two Beth Horons to be built in Ephraim as refuges for his people, when the caprice of the tyrant Raraeses should deprive them of favour and drive them into exile. The last name is Tawatana, which is elsewhere rendered Thepkana. It possibly denotes Tappuach or Tappuah, a state of considerable "magnitude as Palestinian kingdoms went, the king of which was conquered by Joshua a hundred years after. Tappuah was a grandson of Ma Reshah.*^
The illegible names in the inscription, which are at least six in
number, would complete the representation of the Hittite tribes, who, with the exception of the Zerethites on the Euphrates and Tigris, presented a united front to the enemy. In the reigns of Merenptah and Rameses III, reigns which

coincided in point of time, but which were those of two distinct persons, Horon, the eldest son of Seti Menephtah and Sherah, the daughter of the great Rameses, and Uzzen-Sherah, or Acencheres, the son of Rameses and the same princess, an invasion of Egypt by the Hittites took place. It is generally called The Invasion of Egypt by the Greeks.*^ Some of them were indeed Greeks, the Ekronite founders of Cyrene, but they were accompanied by other Philistine tribes, by many Midianites who became Numidians, and Hittites of Mehir, who became Mauretanians, by Zocha
rites, and Zerethites, and Heraclids, and Amorifces from Eshcol.
It is impossible that their great invasion took place in the time of Rameses III., although they harassed the northern coasts in his time as in the declining years of his father, for had it been made while the Israelites were building Pithom and Raamses they would have obtained their liberty without a miracle. But after the overthrow in the Red Sea, when Merenptah became king
instead of viceroy, and while Israel, therefore, was in the wilderness, the so-called Greeks poured into Egypt, driving Merenptah
into the south and advancing in their victorious career beyond Heliopolis and Memphis into the heart of the country. Merenptah
gathered his forces and inflicted a crushing defeat upon the invaders of Paari, which compelled the remnant to return to their own land.^^ The invading army was under the command of Marmaiu, son of Batta, king of the Libyans, or Lubu. Herodotus in his fourth book gives an account of the colonization of Cyrene by , Battus of Thera, which is chronologically inconsistent with the appearance of a Battus before the time of Merenptah. Battus,. however, was a Japhetic name, being one of the modifications of Buz, ancestral in the Ekronite family. The name of Arcesilaus, son of the Battus of Herodotus, displays the connection of the Heraclidae of Aharhel with the Ekronites, which has been already
sufficiently indicated. The Lubu of the land of Maurui, over whom Marmaiu, son of Batta, reigned, were a branch of the Rephaim, southern Lapps, and their land was named after their ancestor, Mehir, the eponym in Africa of the Moors, as in

Mesopotamia of the Nairi. The auxiliaries came from the laud of Mateni, the Midian, from whose son Epher, according to Josephus, Africa derived its name, and from that of Tahennu, so called after Tehiunah, the father of Ir Nahash, another grandson of Mehir.** The Mashuash who accompanied them may have been the men of Nachash ; the Shekilusha were Sicilians from the Amorite Eshcol on tlieir way to, not from, Sicily ; and the Sharutana, sons of
Zereth, had not yet seen Sardinia. The Luku were Hittite Lycians, for whose parentage Lecah, son of Er the Shuhite, Ama Lek, son of Temeni, and Lechem, son of Salma the Hepherite, may compete ; but the Akauasha, Tursha, and Kahaika, in such a mixed multitude of Philistines, Midianites, Horites, and Hittites,
defy definite identification. These were the peoples who carried civilization all through northern Africa and across the Mediterranean to many coasts of southern Europe. Sallust quotes from the library of king Hiempsal a story of the invasion of Numidia by Hercules and his army of Medes, Persians, and Armenians/^ Movers is not far astray in asserting that the Hycsos, leaving Egypt for the west, became the Numidians and Mauretanians.*^ The Hycsos, typical Turanians, are, however, to be carefully dis
tinguished from the Amorite tribes, that, according to tradition, fled from the arms of Joshua along the same route.*^ Yet there seems to have been a remarkable fusion of peoples and of language in northern Africa, producing the Berber type of humanity and of speech, which has much in common with the Celtic. In point of worship and arts there is much similarity between the former inhabitants of the Canary Islands, or the Guanches, and the Peruvians, so that comparative ethnologists have been led to regard the latter as Guanche colonists, rather
than the guardians of the eastern limits of that widespread Khitan
race, whose western bound was fixed in the Canaries.*^

CHAPTER XVI.
The Hittites in Palestine and the Neighbouring Countries Before the Rise of the Assyrian Empire (Continued).
. Leaving the colonizers of Africa to spread along its Mediterranean shore and drive the descendants of Mizraim and Phut into the interior, we turn to the Hittite Confederacy at Kadesh. It seems to have done more than hold its own against the Amorites, for the family of Paseach, aided by the Heraclidae and Ekronites. had passed over Jordan, and, in the person of Og or Gog, had assumed sovereignty over the Amorites in Bashan and Gilead, while Sihon the Amorite indemnified himself for this loss by depriving Moab of her northern boundaries. The Zerethite sons of Anak lingered about Hebron, and, with some of the Rephaim who appear, like them, to have been favoured by the Philistines, maintained themselves against the Amorite Confederacy, framed on the model of the Hittite with Jerusalem at its head. A collision took place during the obscure period that intervenes between the last Egyptian record of Palestinian warfare and the entrance of Israel into Canaan between the Heraclidae and the desendants of Shimon the Beerothite, but where this took place it is hard to say. It may have been to the north of Bashan, where the kingdom of Hamath Zobah sprang into existence, through whose country the posterity of Regem must needs pass to get to Carchemish, the historical seat of th® family. Soon after leaving Egypt, Moses sent spies into Canaan who brought back a report of the state of the land, of which we possess but a brief summary.^ The spies had entered by the road from the south which passed by Hebron, and had thence made their way northward to Rehob, opposite the springs of Jordan. In the south they found the Amalekites in the occupa

182 THE HITTITES.
tion of part of their ancient domain, separated from the rest of their Hittite brethren, with the exception of the Kenite families of Arabia Petraea. In Hebron they found more Hittites in the three sons of Anak the Geshurite. The Canaanites, whom the spies saw dwelling by the sea and by the coast of Jordan, were the Sidonians, the Phoenicians or Beni Jaakan, and the Girgasites; and in the mountains were the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites.In the enumeration of the tribes, the reporting spies appear to have begun at the north with Sidon and the Phoenicians, next to whom came the Hittites, extending from Rehob to the mountains of Bethel, then the Jebusites in Jerusalem and Bezek, and finally the Amorites in all the south country to the border of the Amalekites. No mention is made of the Philistines and the other Japhetic tribes scattered through the land, nor of the occupation of Jericho by a branch of the family of Jerachmeel, the ancestor of the historical descendants of Japheth. In their wanderings in the wilderness, Israel's only enemies were the Amalekites of the desert under their Agag, and a body of Canaanites, perhaps journeying from the Persian Gulf to seek a western home like the Amorites, whose king was Arad. When they came to the Amorite border, no attempt was made to combine the forces of the trans-Jordanic tribes against them, which
may be regarded as an indication that the kingdoms of that region were mutually hostile. Joshua conquered them in detail, first reducing the Amorite kingdom of Sihon, which lay between Moab and Bashan, and, by a stroke of military genius, hindering future combinations in that quarter. Og or Gog, who was lord of the Amorites of Gilead and Bashan, and who reigned in the ancestral seat, of the Rephaim, Ashteroth Karnaim, was himself no Amorite. His name is Hittite, the Circassian gug, the
heart, Basque gogo^ thought, desire, feeling, which the Japanese has lengthened to Jcokoro, meaning both heart and thought, of which kokochi, a synonym, answers to the Choctaw chukesh. The Lydians, among whom the historical Gyges appears, were Hittites of Laadah ; and Gog, the son of Shemaiah and descendant of Paseach, is the only person of the name mentioned in
* For Beni Jaakan as Phoenicians, see my article on the Phoenicians in the British and Foreign Evangelical Review, July, 1875, p. 425, seq.



THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 183
the Kenite genealogies. It is also expressly stated that Og was of the remnant of the Rephaim.^ Gog of Bashan is a character of much interest. The rabbins tell unnumbered stories about him, each more extravagant than the last.* Gog and Magog is not a mere Bible expression, but is as common in the east as Krethi und Plethi in Germany.^ Two Latin legends relate to Gog. The first is that of Caeculus, son of Vulcan, who built Praeneste in Italy, a city connected with Anagnia, after a lifetime spent in robbery and pillage. Having
no inhabitants for his city, he besought his father, Vulcan, to acknowledge him before the neighbouring people. Suddenly a flame shone all round about him, and the multitude that had assembled to behold the adventurous stranger at once consent to become his subjects. The second legend calls him Cacus, also a son of Vulcan, and a robber like Caeculus. He was a giant of enormous bulk, from whose mouth fire and smoke were emitted. His cavern in the Aventine hill was hung round about with the heads and limbs of his victims, and the whole land was in terror because of his ravages. When Hercules came thither with the oxen of Geryon, Evander hospitably entertained him, but Cacus stole away the hero's herds. Thereupon Hercules attacked the
monster, and, spite of his blasts of fire, strangled him in his arms. Dionysius of Halicarnassus adds that Hercules disbanded part of his troops, and settled them in the land over which Cacus had tyrannized. The same person appears, although out of date, as Cocalus, King of Camici, or, according to Pausanias, of Inycus, in Sicily. To him Daedalus fled, and when Minos came in search of that ingenious but wicked subject, Cocalus scalded him to death in a hot bath. Another form of Gog is Caucon, of whom we know little more than that he was the eponym of the Caucones of Elis and Bithynia. Geographically his name is connected with Samicus and Anigrus, and genealogically with Phlyus, doubtless the same as Phlias, son of Cacus and grandson of Temenus. Pausanias states that Caucon, son of Celaeuus, brought the rites of . the great goddesses to Messenia. The

Gygaea palus of Lydia is connected with Magnesia ; and Nicolas of Damascus says that the Magnesians, having disfigured Magnes, a beautiful youth of their city beloved by Gyges, that monarch took their city. Gyges, again, was a usurper who married the wife of Candaules, the son of Myrsus, and the last of the Heraclidae. His story is variously told. According to Herodotus, Candaules, proud of his wife's beauty, secretly introduced his officer, Gyges, into her bedchamber, which the queen discovered and offered Gyges his choice of death or the assassination of his master. Gyges chose the latter and became king. But Plato says that Gyges was a herdsman, and that, while feeding the flocks of the King of Lydia, a great earthquake took place which made a rent in the ground. Into this chasm he descended and found a brazen horse with an aperture in its side. Looking in, he saw a royal corpse with a ring on its finger. Returning to his brother herdsmen, he found that by turning the ring he could
make himself invisible. With this potent ally he took possession of the queen, murdered the king, and ascended the Lydian throne. Nicolas of Damascus represents Gyges as the descendant of one Dascylus, whom the Lydian Adyattes had assassinated. A prophecy had gone before that vengeance should come in the fifth generation, in which were Sadyattes the king and his officer, Gyges. The latter was sent by the king to bring home his bride, the daughter of Arnossus, King of Mysia. On the way he insulted the young queen and was condemned to die, but, collecting a band of followers, he suddenly fell upon Sadyattes in the bridal chamber and put him to death. In this last, Sadyattes looks like Sandacus, who, according to Apollodorus, married Pharnace, daughter of Megessarus, and built Celenderis in Cilicia, which Bochart supposes to be a corruption of the land of Gilead. Arnossus and Pharnace are forms of Ir Nahash, the son of Tehinnah the Nairi, while Sadyattes, as a Zoheth, would explain the Messenian and Magnesian connection as relating to Meonothai, whose people the Egyptian monuments call Mashanat. Candaules also is probably the rendering of the original name Gothniel which heads the line of Kenezzites to which Meonothai and Zoheth belonged. But they were in no sense Lydians, while Myrsus and Magnes might well stand for the two genuine Lydian

names, Mareshah and Meon. The Maonites also were certainly to the east of Jordan in the time of Gog, having removed from Beth-Baal- Maon in Moab into the country east of Bashan. Gog was plainly a usurper. It is said that he " dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, and reigned in mount Hermon and in Salcah, and in all Bashan unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon, King of Heshbon."^ Edrei or Edregi, supposed to be the Hadrach of Zechariah's prophecy, was a transported name, there being a place so called near Capernaum, which is mentioned in the book of Joshua with Kedesh and Hazor.^ Hermon was certainly named after Harum the father of Aharhel ; and Salcah may be a form of Zerach furnishing the Egyptian Sarasu. The name Ir Nahash, which appears equally in Arnossus, Pharnace, and Praeneste, as well as in the Mysian Lyrnessus united with Pedasus, has no place in the Hebrew record of Palestinian geography. When Nahash appears in the Bible as a proper name it is always connected with Ammon. In Greek story Edrei connects wiMi the nine-headed Hydra of Lerna, which was slain by Hercules at the sprmg Amymone. Lerna is an abbreviation of Lyrnessus denoting Ir Nahash, and Amymone is the Greek version of Jemima, the name of Job's eldest daughter. Pausanias tells how the Hydra was nourished under a plane tree near the fountain of Am3'^mone, and how Philammon instituted the Lernaean mysteries in connection with it. The number nine was sacred to the family of Hamath, but also to that of Tehinnah, for the nine Muses of Parnassus belong to the same story as the nine-headed Hydra of Lerna. As Lerna is to Lyrnessus, so is mount Parnes to Parnassus, for on that mountain were the statues of Jupiter Parnethius and Jupiter Semaleus, uniting the name of Ir Nahash with that of Samlah.^ According to Strabo, the abodes of the Hydra and the Stymphalides were in close proximity. Paseach also connects with the story in Amymone, his granddaughter Jemima. Nahash is famous in Sanscrit story as the great serpent Nahusha, whose identity with Ir Nahash is established by his descent from Ayus
* Josh. xii. 5. ^ Zech. ix. 1 ; Josh. xix. 37. ^ Pausanias.



186 THE HITTITES.
and Pururavas. He was a ffreat kino^ and devotee of the gods, who, by making the sacrifice of a hundred horses, dethroned Indra himself. Then he claimed the celestial throne and Sachi the spouse of the god. None dared openly resist him ; therefore Sachi consented to a union with the presumptuous monarch on condition that he would come to her in a car drawn by Brahmans. The intoxicated Nahusha harnessed the Brahmans to his car and hastened to meet the goddess, but as the sages were not quick enough in their movements, he gave Agastya, the nearest of them, a kick on the head, crying at the same time " sarpa, sarpa," (go, go !) ; on which the Brahman answered " sarpa, sarpa" (snake, snake !) and hurled the king of Pratishthana to the earth, where he crawled a huge serpent for ten thousand years. It was he who hugged the Bharatan Bhima in his folds, and who, letting him go at the request of Yudisthira, was by that hero set free from the curse of Agastya and allowed to ascend to heaven.^ Nahash is the Hebrew word for a serpent and for brass, and is
used by Job to derft)te the draco volans or flying serpent.^° The brazen horse in the story of Gyges connects with this word. Druhyu, a son of Nahusha is a Typhonian monster answering to the Hydra anii Edregi. The Persian story of Ir Nahash calls him Piranwis-ah, and makes him the commander of the armies of Afrasiab, king of Touran. As Zohak and Afrasiab belong to the same family, the latter is Ophrah the Kenezzite.connected, however, with the Rephaim through his grandfather Abiezer, the son of Samlah. It is impossible, therefore, that Ir Nahash can have been Ophrah's general, but he may have acted in that capacity for his ancestor Othniel. Mirkhond makes Siyawesh or Ziph of the line of Jabez marry Ferangiz the daughter of Piranwis-ah. In the Greek history of the Argive line, a Lynceus, otherwise unhistorical, is introduced as the son of .^gyptus and the only one spared among his fifty sons by the daughters of Danaus. The Persian account explains this double relation of Lynceus as Ir Nahash to the families of Jabez and the Kenezzites of Dinhabah. Sir George Cox, however, by a happy stroke of genius unites Lynceus and the Hydra. After stating that the Danaides threw the heads of

THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 187
their slain husbands into the marsh grounds of Lernai, he goes on to say : " But one of the Danaides refused or failed to slay her husband. The name of this son of Aigyptus is Lynkeus, a myth to which Pausanias furnishes a clue hy giving its other form Lyrkeios. But Lyrkeios was the name given to the river Tnachos in the earlier portion of its course, and thus this story would simply mean that although the other streams were quite dried up the waters of the Lyrkeios did not wholly fail."^^ Without discussing Sir George's explanation, his note to this passage may
be added as it stands. " The head of Lynkeus (Lyrkeios), the one stream which is not dried up, answers to the neck of the Lernaian Hydra. So long as streams were supplied from the main source, Herakles had still to struggle with the Hydra. His victory was not achieved until he had severed this neck which Hypermnestra refused to touch. The heads of the slain sons of Aigyptos are the heads which Herakles hewed off from the Hydra's neck : and thus this labour of Herakles resolves itself into the struggle of the sun with the streams of the earth, the conquest of which is of course the setting in of thorough drought." Immediately after the passage in Pausanias to which Sir George Cox refers, the geographer mentions Epidaurus, a place answering to the Palestinian Abiezer and the Indian region of Abisarus, of which he says, Deiphontes and Hyrnethus the Heraclids took possession. But Temenus the head of the Heraclidae had been king over that region, and had given his daughter Hyrnetho in marriage to his kinsman Deiphontes, who was better loved by Temenus and the Argives than were his own sons Cisus, Cerynes, and Phalces. The brothers determined to take Hyrnetho away from Deiphontes, and, as she refused to go with them, they took her by force and drove away with her in a car. Deiphontes and his Epidaurians pursued and killed Cerynes with a dart, but, fearing lest he might wound Hyrnetho to whom Phalces clung, he endeavoured to drag him awaj'-. Phalces, how
ever, so violently pressed his sister that she died in his arms
;
whereupon he disengaged himself from the grasp of Deiphontes and fled in terror, leaving the unhappy Epidaurian to build the Hyrnethium in honour of his dead wife.^^ Another story of

188 THE HITTITES.
Nahash is that of the Megaric Nisus, made the father-in-law of Megareus, who is evidently the same person as Macareus, king of Lesbos, called by Diodorus a son of Crinacus. Like Samson, the strength or fortune of Nisus was in his hair, and, so long: as the purple lock remained uncut, his life and happiness lasted. But when Minos besieged Megara, Scylla, the daughter of the king, fell in love with the Cretan, and, cutting off the lock from her
father's head while he slept, gave it to the invader who thus
obtained the city. Minos, instead of being gratified, was disgusted
with Scylla's treachery, and, tying her by the feet to the stern of his ship, dragged her through the sea till she was drowned. Two Irish stories exhibit relations to that of Hyrnetho. In the time
of Connor, king of Ulster, a prophet foretold injury to the kingdom from the child of Feidhlim, his secretary. Connor, however, would not allow this child to be put to death, but shut her up in an impregnable tower surrounded b}' a strong garrison, appointinor a wise woman named Leabharcham to be her saoler. The princess Deirdre grew to be a woman of singular beauty. Looking out of her window one wintry day she saw the blood of a calf just killed lying on the snow, and a raven feeding upon it, and prayed that she might have a husband " who had a skin as white as the driven snow, hair as shining black as the feathers of a raven, and a blooming red in his cheeks as deep as the calf's blood." Her governess told her that Naois, the son of Visneach,
corresponded to such a picture, and then, at the princess's request, entered into correspondence with Naois. With the aid of his brothers Ainle and Ardan and a hundred and fifty followers, the son of Visneach stormed the castle and carried Deirdre off to Scotland. The king of Scotland sought to deprive Naois of his bride, so that he was compelled to sue Connor for permission to return to Ulster. Connor apparently consented, but as soon as the three sons of Visneach landed, his general Eogan, chief commander of th^ Fearmoighe, treacherously slew them and carried Deirdre to the king. For some time she remained in confinement bewailing her beloved Naois, but Connor' brought her out and bestowed her upon the murderer of her husband. Between Connor and Eogan she was borne in a car towards the castle of the latter, and on the way the cruel king amused himself making



THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 189
coarse jests upon the prisoner, which so incensed her that she threw herself violently to the ground and beat out her brains. The other story is that of Macha, wife of Cruin, the son of Adnainhuin. Connor compelled her, although with child at the
time, to run a race with his horses. She came first to the goal, but immediately gave birth to a son and daughter and died leaving a curse upbn the men of Ulster. " And heaven heard her, for the men of that province were constantly afflicted with the pains of child bearing for many years, from the time of Connor, who then reigned in Ulster, to the succession of Mai, the son of Rochruide."^^ The circumstances of Hyrnetho's death were similar to those of Macha : and the enemies of Siyawesh attempted to destroy the unborn son of Ferangiz. The story of Macha is valuable as shedding light upon a strange custom peculiar to that Chelubite branch of the Achaslitarite race to which Paseach and Ir Nahash belonged. In Beam it is called the Couvade, and consists in the rising of the mother from her bed immediately after the birth of her child, and the father taking her place, there to receive the compliments of the neighbours. Various writers cited by M. Francisque- Michel find the same usage in Biscay and Navarre. M. Chaho has attempted to explain it by the legend of Aitor (Achashtari), the father of the Basques. While in exile upon a mountain a son was born to him, and the mother, fearing for the life of the infant if she remained with him doing nothing, placed him under the father's care and went away to provide for the wants of the family. Since then the Basques have preserved this ceremony in memory
of the privations of their first parents.^* ' Strabo knew of this custom, and says concerning the Iberian women of Spain : " They
cultivate the ground, and after childbirth put their husbailds in
bed in their place and wait upon them."^^ Diodorus Siculus found it in Corsica, where a strange and very difiicult* language was spoken : " They (the Corsicans) observe a ceremony of a most fantastic character at the birth of their children. They pay no attention of any kind to their wives while they are in labour

but the husband goes to bed and lies there a certain number of days as if he were the patient."^^ Apollonius Rhodius notes the custom as pertainin_^ to the Tibareni, neighbours of the Chalybes
on the south-eastern shore of the Black Sea. The passage is thus translated by Mr. Preston :
" Advancing in their course the advent'rous band Were borne along the Tibarenian land. Among that race strange usages they find, Inverting all the customs of mankind
:
When to the light their infant offspring rise, The husbands utter groans and piercing cries ; With many a bandage bind the drooping head, And, helpless, sink upon the sickly bed : The wives for them the choices c food prepare, And baths adapted for the teeming fair."i7
In the travels of Marco Polo this cowvade is attributed to the Zar Dandan or Golden Teeth, who are the Miau-tze of West Yunnan in China, and to the present day " the father of a new-born child, as soon as its mother has become strong enough to leave her couch, gets into bed himself and there receives the congratulations
of his acquaintances."^^ Sir John Lubbock cites the custom as common to the Caribs of Guiana, the Abipones of the Gran Chaco and the Dyaks of Borneo, to whom Dr. Tylor adds the Koravans
of India.^® It is this practice as reported by Marco Polo, which
occasioned Butler's couplet
" Chineses go to bed And lie in in their ladies' stead."
Herodotus relates that a judgment of the same nature as that which fell upon the men of Ulster visited the Scythian invaders of Egypt in the time of Psammetichus, on account of their plundering the temple of Venus Urania at Ascalon.^^ The flifFerent traditions thus set forth indicate, first a connec
tion of the tribe of Ir Nahash with Edrei, which Og possessed in addition to Ashteroth Kamaim, the ancient seat of the Rephaim.

An inscription of Shalinanezer places Adduri in the immediate vicinity of the Nairi kingdom of Dayani, which represents Tehinnah the father of Ir Nahash.^i They also indicate a distinct relation subsisting between the Kenezzites of Elephantine and the family of Ir Nahash, first in Egypt, and afterwards in Palestine, where these Kenezzites wei-e found in the country of Abiezer, the chief town of which was Ophrah or Beth Leophrah. This is further vouched for in geographical nomenclature by Lyrnessa as a name of Tenedos or Leucophrys, the island of Cycnus and Tennes, If, however, the Hycsos city Arnath be the same as Terenuthis, which is to the west of the Delta, a later Egyptian home of the family must be looked for in the south, probably about Berenice, a name common to Ethiopia and Cyrene. An association of the two Nairi lines of Paseach is also displayed, which appears in the Troad, where Pedasus and Lyrnessus were twin cities, and in Syria where the same river bore the two names Orontes and Thapsacus. Pausanias says that a Roman emperor, whom he does not name, turned the Orontes into a new channel for the benefit of his fleet, and in the dry bed of the old channel found an urn of eartK more than eleven cubits high, in which was the body of a man of equal height. An oracle declared that the body was that of an Indian named Orontes.-'^ The representative of the line of Paseach is Gog, the Lydian Gyges, who appears at first in a humble station ; and the reigning king, whether he be Caudaules or Sadyattes, an Othniel or a Zoheth, belongs to the Kenezzite family. The seat of this family was probably Abiezer in central Palestine near the Jordan and the water of Tappuah, belonging to Mareshah. Its king had strengthened his throne by taking in marriage a daughter of the king of Ir Nahash, who for
convenience may be called Pharnace or Berenice, but the question arises whether he took her with or against her will. Gibbon has preserved a remarkable parallel to Herodotus' story of Gyges in that of Rosamund. She was the daughter of Cunimund, king of the Gepidae, and was sought in marriage by Alboin, king of the Lombards. By stratagem and force he gained possession of the fair princess, but the Gepidae and the Romans overcame him, and
21 Records of the Past, iii. 94. 22 Paus. viii. 29.

he was compelled to relinquish his prey. Alboin then called in the aid of the Chagan of the Avars, against whose multitudes the Gepidae could not stand. Cunimund with the bravest of his warriors fell fighting, and Alboin had a drinking cup made of his skull. He carried off Rosamund once more, who appeared to be well satistied as the queen of Lombardy, soon afterwards gained by her warlike husband's valour and military skill. In a palace near Verona he feasted with his warriors, and when the banquet was far advanced had Cunimund's skull filled with wine and sent it to the queen to drink. Rosamund dissembled and touched the
sacred relic with her lips, vowing inward revenge. Helmichis, the king's armour bearer, was her agent. When she had deprived Alboin of all weapons, and lulled him to sleep, he entered with a band of followers and killed the tyrant, whose fall his queen smiled at beholding. The Lombards drove her forth, and with Helmichis, her daughter, and the faithful Gepidae, she sought refuge with Longinus, the Exarch of Ravenna. The Exarch sought her in marriage, and she prepared to make away with Helmichis in order to bring about this union. But while he drank the cup she tendered him, he did not drain it ; there was enough left to serve Rosamund as she had served him, and with his dagger at her breast he compelled the guilty queen to partake of the poisoned draught which ended both their lives.-^ Cunimund, Alboin, Longinus, and probably Rosamund and Helmichis, are historical characters belonging to the second half
of the sixth century, just as many personages in the Niebelungen
Lied pertain to the middle of the fifth ; yet the traditions concerning them are twice-told tales. The Gepidae were of the same lineage as the Franks, and these were Germanized Hittites, as were the Norse Varangians and British Bernicians. Nennius deduces the Bernicians, from whom the Deirans were separated in the time of Soemil, perhaps Samlah, having been previously one people, from Beornec, son of Beldeg, or Baldur, son of Woden ; and states that from Beornec in the eighth generation came a queen Bearnoch.^* Between these, however, he brings in Ingwi and Eoppa of the line of Paseach, and Theodric a Hadadezer.

THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 193
These were the same as the Franks of Europe, descendants of Ir Nahash, Berenice, Parnassus. The Gepidae, however, although closely related, were not the same people, but a Germanized remnant of the Cappadocians, or Jabezites, called in southern Italy Messapian lapyges. It is clear now why the Sanscrit documents make Gritsamada, who was the brother of Nahusha, the son of Vitahavya or Mezahab, and, at the same time, call Vitahavya's descendants the Srinjayas. By a union, represented in Persian story as the marriage of Siyawesh and Ferangiz, the line of Ir Nahash, Srinjaya, or Ferangi, was leagued with that of Jabez, so that Cappadocia owned a Tyana and a Parnassus. But the Gepidae, if they told the story of Rosamund, derived it not from their own, but from Prankish traditions. The Lombards again, of whom Alboin her husband was king, were the halbardiers descended from Leophrah, the Olymbrius of the Cilicians, the Zeus Labrandens of Caria bearing an axe, the Labradh of Irish story with his green-headed partisans ; and to their line belonged Godoniel and Zoheth, or Candales and Sadyattes. They also were
Germanized Hittites. It is not alleged that any of these peoples, Gepidae, Franks, Lombards, were of pure Hittite blood. The rule
of the Hittite confederacy, as shown in the institutions of the Iroquois league, was to strengthen the Long House by admitting any tribes that were willing to enter the League and conform to its usages; and the introduction in this way of 'large bodies of
people, from time to time, must account for the enormous extension throughout the habitable world of Hittite names, customs, and traditions. The story of Rosamund is thus an old tale of enmity between the men of Ir Nahash and the Kenezzites, carrying us back through the traditions of the Lydian Gyges and the mere
mention of Og of Bashan, as the lord of an Edrei that did not rightly belong to him, to that obscure portion of Hittite history that lies between the reign of the third Rameses and the entrance of Israel into Canaan.
This story leaves us in doubt as to the true character of the princess or queen through whom Og claimed Edrei, and as to his treatment of her. Of the traditions referred to, the Greek one
of Hyrnetho, the Persian of Ferangis, and the Irish, relate to an Egyptian alliance between the families of Jabez and Ir Nahash

194 THE HITTITES.
which was distasteful to the Kenezzites of Elephantine, All these accounts coincide in representing the Kenezzites as killing the husband and acting cruelly towards the wife ; and in some
way, not yet very clear, the practice of the couvade originated in her history. As the Coptic language turned Paseach into Pthah, so it converted Nahash into Neith. This Neith, tutelary goddess of Sais, corresponds to the Greek Athene and Roman Minerva. The oldest accounts of the birth of Minerva make her motherless, a child of Jupiter. The monarch of the gods, learning that his spouse Metis was about to bring forth a daughter excellent in wisdom, and a son who should rule the universe, swallowed her, like the Lydian Gambles, to prevent this catastrophe. But the pains of maternity came upon the deity, who only found relief when Vulcan cleft his skull, and Minerva full-armed sprang from it. The child-bearing Jupiter was a common subject of the artists of that Hittite people, the Etruscans. Tiie favourite tree of Minerva was the olive. It is not a mere coincidence that Minerva was worshipped at Epidaurus, where was the Hyrnethium surrounded on all sides by wild olive trees, which Deiphontes consecrated to the memory of his murdered Hyrnetho and forbade any one to touch. No less a personage than Jupiter was the first to keep the couvade, but that the great Zeus was the Ziph, Siyawesh, or Deiphontes, whose child-bearing wife came to a tragic end
through the crtielty of the Kenezzites, is more than one would be
disposed to assert. This Egyptian legend being separated from the mass of tradition, there remains that of the second Pharnace. Under that name she was the wife of a Sandochus, and, as a daughter of the king of Arnossus, she was the bride of Sadyattes, both of these representing a Zoheth, or Sandes, in the Kenezzite line of Leophrah. Here we have the original of the Lombard story. In Auranitis, to the east of Bashan and to the north of Amnion, dwelt a descendant of Ir Nahash, the son of Tehinnah, who had extended his conquests into Bashan, founding in that country the city of Edrei. He was conquered, however, by the Kenezzite Zoheth, who took his daughter in marriage and became, if indeed
that had not already been his position, the head of the Hittite confederacy. Og, or Gog, a descendant of Job and Paseach, was in the service of Zoheth, and was, like liis race, a man of great



THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 195
stature, of personal courage, and manly beauty. He was related to the family of the conquered and slain king of Auranitis, and,
therefore, to the queen by a common descent from their ancestor Eshton. It is true that Zoheth might claim the kingdom of the Rephaim through Abiezer, a Kapha ; but when Abiezer married Hathath, the Kenezzite princess, he virtually renounced his birthright and became an adopted member of the Kenezzite family. The Lydiau traditions, while acquitting Zoheth of the brutality attributed to his representative in the story of Rosamund, yet make him guilty of dishonourable conduct towards his queen. If this were not sufficient to alienate her from him, the remembrance
of indignities inflicted upon an earlier Pharnace in Egypt by the race to which he belonged would fill up the cup of indignation,
and lead her to invoke the interference of her kinsman Gog. It was he who called in the Amorites, by some jugglery, like Caeculus, gaining the ascendancy over these invaders ; and with their aid he overthrew the dominion of the Kenezzites in Bashan, slew Zoheth, and appropriated his queen. Then, having married Pharnace, he thereby became king of Praeneste, or, as Latin tra
dition inverts the story, the Hernici ruled in Anagnia ; for the Hernici were the men of Ir Nahash, and the Anagnians were Gog's people, the descendants of Hanoch. Of Pharnace's fate we know nothing, but Gog, after a career of conquest and rapine, was,
like Cacus, slain by an Israelite Hercules, Joshua, the son of Nun, whose chief friend was not indeed Evander, but Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, a member of that Kenezzite family whose head Gog had treacherously murdered. How the story of the death of Cacus found its way to Italy is a question hard to answer, but it must have travelled from the East with a race, Kenite or Kenez
zite, friendly to the Israelites and, at any rate, inimical to the
Etruscans, of whom the Paseachites, or Japuscer, constituted a division. Probably the Qscans, Ausones, or Aurunci, carried the tale. With the victory of Zoheth the empire of Nahusha fell
;
with that of Gog, the so-called Lydian Heraclidae, who were not really such, were superseded ; and, coincident with his overthrow, was the rise to supremacy over the Hittite tribes of the race of Zochar in the person of king Jabin of Hazor. Joshua did not attack the Ammonites nor the men of Ir

Nahash-, who were doubtless confederate with them ; but he defeated the Moabites and their Midianite allies, slaying the five princes of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba, together with the false prophet Balaam, the son of Beor, from the land of the Ammonites. On ' the west side of Jordan his first conquest was Jericho, a Japhetic, or as the Sanscrit writers would say, a Brahman city. In Greek story it is probably represented by the first Orchomenus inhabited by the Phlegyans and Eteocles, the Jerachmeelite Bela or Belag and Jediael or Jedigael, who were destroyed by incessant storms and fearful earthquakes, save a few that fled to Phocis. After the fall of Jericho and the connected Ai, one of the chief members of the Amorite or Hornet Confederation, Gibeon, fell away to Israel, with its dependent cities, thus weakening greatly the forces of the Amorites. Five kings, of whom Adoni Zedek was the leader, mustered their forces,, but by a famous night march Joshua came unexpectedly upon them and put them to total rout. The story of Cacus makes the Israelite leader a Latin Hercules, and that of the Campi Lapidei confirms the identification, showing that the people from whom the Romans gained their information were favourable to Israel.
iEschylus first told the story of the Stony Fields which the geographers place between Marseilles and the Rhone. There, Albion and Bergion, or Alebion and Dercynus, if we follow Apollodorus, met Hercules in his career of western conquest. The hero's weapons failed him and he invoked the aid of Jupiter, who rained stones from heaven and destroyed the Ligurian giants.. Diodorus tells of the conquests of this Hercules in Sicily, and mentions among the famous captains overcome by him. Gaugates, Cygaeus, Leucaspis, Pedicrates, Buphonus, and Crytidas, of whom Gaugates and Cygaeus seem to represent Gog, and Buphonus, Jabin of Canaan. The kings of Makkedah and Libnah, and Horam, king of Gezer, whom Joshua discomfited in the south, were, in all probability, Amorites, as were the five confederate kings. In that same south country Joshua afterward cut off the Auakim, evidently a generic term, for it applies to the Zerethite remnant named after Anak, the son of Arba and descendant of Jesher, and also to the Philistines, a Japhetic people.
When Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai were slain, their families

appear to have taken refuge in the kingdom of Geshur, alongside of that of Maachah, and to the north of Bashan. This seems not to have been accomplished until after Joshua's death, at the time when Adoni Bezek, a tyrannical and cruel Amorite king, was taken with his city of Bezek and executed for his crimes. The Philistines, like the Ammonites, were spared because of the ancient friendship that subsisted between them and the Israelites in their Egyptian home. At last the Hittites declared war. The head of their Confederacy was Jabin king of Hazor ; " for Hazor beforetime w^as the head of all these kingdoms."^^ Hazor was situated to the north of Kadesh Naphtali, and like the Latin castrum which as chatsor it resembles, means a castle. This is in Hebrew, however, not in Hittite. Its representative in Pontus was Gaziura, the ancient
residence of the Pontic kings ; in Venetia, Hadria ; and in Japan, Katsura, the abode of Sui Sei the" second emperor of that country. In Japanese the word is supposed to mean the Dolichus hirsutus, a plant of the bean family, which is a somewhat improbable name for a city. Its king was Jabin, a modified Jephunneh, belonging to the same family as Jephunneh, son of Abraham's contemporary Ephron, that namely of Zochar. This family has no royal record since the time when Ephron ruled in Hebron. From that time the Zocharites became physicians, but
whether in Egypt or in Palestine or both is hard to say. The
Odyssey, indeed, makes the Egyptian physicians more skilful than others because they were of the race of Paeon, but no
distinct traces of the family have been found in the land of the Pharaohs.2^ Their great African home was Gyrene, to which they must have migrated through northern Egypt and Libya. As the Takkaro they were a warlike maritime people associated. with the Shardana or Zerethites in raids upon the Egyptian
coast.2'' In Gyrene, Hippon was one of their earliest settlements, and it was a royal name, for, according to Solinus, the Phoenician Elissa or Dido purchased from Japon, king of Libya, the ground on which she erected Garthage.^^ After Hippon, settlements of

198 THE HITTITES.
Zocharites were founded in Apollonia, which commemorated Ephron, in Teuchira, and in Augila far inland, the centre of the Nasamones and Garamantes, descended from Nacham and Garmi. The Zocharites thus constituted an important element in the Hittite population of northern Africa. They have also been traced to southern Assyria, in which country they appear to have shared royalty with their brethren the Zerethites. But early in Egyptian days, a body of the descendants of Zochar established itself along with the related Hamathites in the north of Palestine, between Capernaum, named after Zophar the Naamathite, and the springs of the Jordan at Paneas. The bond that linked the physicians and the scribes was the union of Jether, the son of the Hamathite Ezra, to Jehudijah, the daughter of Caleb the Zocharjte, a princess whose name was translated into Hittite as Mabug or
the Excellent Oracle. In the days of Hittite supremacy in the south, the families had dwelt in what afterwards came to be Judea, where Socho, Gedor, and Zanoah were indications of Hamathite occupation, while Keilah and Naamah marked the presence of the Zocharites. As early, however, as the reign of the first enslaver of Israel, they had been driven into the north, for the author of the Travels of an Egyptian, in his reign, makes
mention of places bearing their characteristic names in that quarter. " Didst thou not then go to the country of Kheta ? Hast thou not seen the land of Aup ? Knowest thou not Khatuma, Ikatai, likewise; how is it? The Tsor of Sesortris,
the city of Khaleb in its vicinity ; how goes it with its ford ? Hast thou not made an expedition to Qodesh and Tubukkhi ? Hast thou not gone to the Shasus with the auxiliary body ? « « » « « Come, set off to return to Pakaikna. Where is the road of Aksaph in the environs of the city ? Come then to the mountain of Ousor : its top, how is it ? Where is the mountain of Ikama ? Who can master it ? What way has the Mohar gone to Hazor ? How about its ford ? Let me go to Hamath, to Takar, to Takar-Aar, the all-assembling place of the Mohars
;
come then on the road that leads there ! Make me to see Jah. How has one got to Matamim ? Do not repel us by thy teachings ; make us to know them."^® Hazor, then, was in existence

THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 199
in the time of Rameses II., and Hamath and Zochar were intimately connected, for Takar corresponds to Takkaro, the name of the Zocharites or Teucri. Khaleb, Qodesh, Tubakkhi, Aksaph and Matamim, denote Helbah, Kedesh, Tappuach, Achshaph and Madon. The land of Aup must be that of Job, whence came his descendant Gog, and may thus be the Bible Tob or Ish Tob in the east of Bashan. In this northern region Jephunneh was commemorated in Jabneel, but Paneas, sacred to him as the god Pan, was his chief record. Pan was the lord of Hyle in Greece, which was a transported Huleh from the springs of Jordan named after Elah, Jephunneh's grandson and the father of Uknaz. " How beautiful was the evening scene of rocks, trees, blue mountains and the extended plain with the thread of the Hhasbani winding through it on the western side
!
There were also herds of cattle coming in.and a shepherd boy playing his rural pipes. What a scene for Poussin ! I offered to
buy the Pandean pipe (of several reeds joined laterally) from the boy, wishing to have it for my own, obtained at the mythological home of Pan himself

" Pan primus calamos cera conjungere plures
Instituit,"
but the lad asked an exhorbitant price for it and strode away. Then I rushed up to make use of the fading twilight for catching at least a glimpse of the Greek inscriptions and Pan's grotto
from which the river issues, not in infantile weakness, but boldly
strikingf an echo ao-ainst the sides of the natural cavity. " Great
Pan is dead ! " as the superstitious peasants of Thessaly said, when they imagined they heard the echo formed into words, sixteen hundred years ago ; and while musing on the rise and fall of the
Classic idolatry, a bat flew past me out of the grotto, but I saw no moles for the old idols to be thrown to. Pan was the mythological deity presiding over caverns, woods and streams from whom this place received its denomination of Panion or Paneas in Greek, or Panium in Latin ; and the word Paneas becomes
Banias in Arabic, as it is at this day."^*^ This was the ancient Thessaly and the original home of Pan, who was also Paeon, Apollon's son, and the father of -^sculapius, whom Chelbah or

Khaleb held in honour. Apollon's line had been long in servitude to Admetus, feeding that monarch's flocks in their own Thessaly, but now, in the person of Jabin, king of Hazor, the sons of
Zochar lifted up their heads, and made their capital no mere
assembling place for Mohars or scribes, but for the lords of all the
tribes of Heth. Unhappily the book of Joshua furnishes the name of but one other Hittite monarch at this time, that of Jobab, king of Madon. This name is identical with that of the Temenite son of Zerah, who reigned in Edom after Bela, and whose descendants had been Hittite emperors or army leaders from the time of Achbor to that of Khitasara ; but no such name as Madon occurs in connection with the Temenites. No one knows anything of Madon, and it is elsewhere unraentioned, save in the following chapter of Joshua where its name occurs between those of Lasharon and Hazor.^^ The Egyptian Mohar, however, places a Matamim somewhere near Takar and Hamath, which Hamath is not to be looked for in Syria, but to be identified with Hamath Dor in Naphtali. This Egyptian form recalls Mattanah, or Mattanim, which was a stage in Israel's wanderings to the north of the Arnon, and thus in the
midst of the region for which the Hittite tribes contended.^^ Pausanias says that Mothone in Messenia was anciently called Pedasus, but that its name was changed to Mothone in honour of the diiughter of (Eneus, son of Parthaon.^ This is the same
(EneiiS as the one that represents Hanoch the Paseachite, and after him the (Enussae islands were named. He goes on to say that the Lacedemonians gave .Mothone to the Nauplienses, belonging to the most ancient Egyptians who left Egypt with Danaus in the third generation, and who received their name from Nauplius, the son of Amymone. The Bias river with Aepea and Pylos in the same region of south-western Messenia bear out this Paseachite connection of Mothone. Now Hercules married the dauffhter of (Eneus, or Hanoch, by whom he had a son Hyllus, or Joel. The Greek genealogists place Cleodaeus and Aristomachus, two generations, between Hyllus and Temenus, who are the Joel and

Shenia of the Kenite list. But the son of Temenus is Cieus or Casus, and his son is Phlias, answering to the Kenite Azaz or Gazaz, son of Shema, and Bela or Belag, son of Gazaz. To Cisus another son is given, namely Medon the father of Lacidas and grandfather of Meltas, who were virtually deprived of regal authority.^* Homer mentions a Medon who with Podarces fought at the head of the Phthii, and calls him a natural son of Oileus, the father of Ajax, these two being Joel and his grandson Azaz. The poet adds that Medon had killed the brother of Eriopis his step-mother, on which account he had fled to Phylace.^^ The only other Medon of any importance who occurs in legendary Grecian history is the son of Codrus, who, after his father had sacrificed himself for the welfare of Athens, going out as a woodman to meet his death at the hands of the hostile Dorians, became the first perpetual Archon and the head of the Medontidae. His period is one marked by great migrations, which are represented by the departure from Attica of his brother Neleus, who expatriated himself, being indignant that a lame man should be chosen before him. Codrus traced his descent from Neleus, the father of Nestor but it was properly on the mother's side, for Bias had married Pero, the daughter of Neleus. The separation of the latter Neleus from Medon may thus indicate a severance of the Heraclid, from the Nairi family, but the connection is obscure. The rule of the Medontidae ceased with Hippomenes, who had shut up his offending daughter with a wild horse which killed her, and dragged her
accomplice to death behind his chariot. For these acts of cruelty his descendants were deprived of the archonship.^^ Methana in Argolis was sacred to Hermes and Hercules ; the Troezene with which it is connected is thus a record of Regem, and the allied Hermione, as a foundation of Hermion, son of Europs,' sets forth Harum as the step-son of Rapha. As the Oilean Medon was a Locrian, so in ancient British history his counterpart Maddan is the son of Locrin and Gwendolaena.^^ The exile of Medon mentioned by Homer in connection with Ajax, who is Azaz, introduces the ancestry of the philosopher Pythagoras. The son of Azaz

or Gazaz was Bela or Belag, and he is Phlias, the son of Casus, son of Temenus, and probably the same person as Phalx called Teraenus' son and the father of Rhegnidas. In the time of Rhegnidas, says Pausanias, the faction of Hippasus, being unwilling to submit to him, fled to Samos, where Hippasus became the father of Euphron, from whom, through Mnesarchus came Pythagoras.^ But Diogenes Laertius derives Pythagoras, through Mnesarchus and Marmacus, from the same Hippasus, and makes the latter the son of Euthyphron instead of the father of Euphron, giving Cleonymus, an exile from Phlias, as Euthyphron's father.^' Cleonymus, or Clysonemus, again is represented as the "son of Amphidamas and grandson of Lycurgus, being thus made a brother of Milanion/" In British story Maddan is the father of Malim, who was murdered by his brother Mempricius after Maddan's death. The character of Mempricius is painted in the blackest colours as a tyrant and debaucher. He was eaten up by wolves, and left the throne to his son Ebraucus. The mystery is hard to
penetrate, for we are deserted by the Kenite lists, but this is clear that the names of Madon and Jobab stand in some historical relation to the mourning of Meholah, for Milanion of Amphidamas has been found in connection with the daughter of Jezreel, who is Corineus (like Zeraheen), the father of the British Gwendolen. Gwendolen herself bears the name of Samlah, Mahalah's father, who is Gwenddoleu of the cannibal birds. Mempricius, or Meuprit, and the Medontid Hippomenes represent a family upon which a curse rested on account of a barbarous punishment which one of its members inflicted on Mahalah and the accomplice of his crime. Every indication marks that family as belonging to the Heraclidae, but not in the main line represented by Bela, the Phlias of the Greeks.

CHAPTER XVII.
The Hittites in Palestine and the Neighbouring Countries Before the Rise oe the Assyrian Empire (Concluded).
Although the Buzites of Eker were not Hittites, but a Japhetic people, they stood in such intimate relationship to the Heraclidae and the Paseachites that some knowledge of their history is absolutely necessary for purposes of synchronism. Next to Buz, the most prominent member of their race was Abihail or Abichail, and his name is variously rendered, accord
ing as value is given to the aspirate or not, by Iphicles, Phigalus, (Ebalus, Naubolus, Nauplius, the two last being nunnated like Niflung and Nergal.^ Among the Phaeacians of Corcyra who represent the Buzites in the Odyssey, Abihail appears as Naubolu^, Michael as Anchialus, Gilead as Clytoneus. Nauplius, who was an Argonaut, is called the son of Clytoneus, but also of Poseidon and Amymone, who is Jemima the daughter of Job. CEneus again, who is Hanoch, the son of Job, is made a king of
Calydon, named after the same Gilead. And Iphicles is represented as the twin brother of Hercules, who married the daughter of Hanoch or (Eneus. Between Gilead and Abihail, however, the Kenite list inserts Jaroach and Churi. The Laconian genealogies make confusion worse confounded, for Michael as Amyclas is the father of Hyacinthus, or Jachan, and Argalus ; Cynortas follows Argalus, and (Ebalus the son of Cynortas marries Gorgo
phone the daughter of Perseus. Other accounts represent Qlbalus as the son of Argulius, or of Telon and the nymph
Sebethis. Now Sebethis belongs, as a name, to this family, being the Kenite Shaphat, and being geographically connected as Safed in Palestine, and Sybota in Epirus. The Sebethus river in Campania also is in the midst of Buzite names, and is specially

associated with Neapolis, which indeed, means the new city, as Nablous is supposed to have done in Palestine ; but, as the latter is an adaptation of the ancient Ebal, so is the former of an
ancient Abihail. If it be true that Abihail is the (Ebalus who married a daughter of Perseus, he may at the same time be the Iphicles who was born on the same day as Hercules, for Hercules
in this case will be Shimon, son of Hadar, the Sem Hercules of the Egyptians. In this case, Tahath, or the first Rameses would
seem to have gained over for a time, at least, the once faithful Praetorians of the dynasty of Jabez to his cause, which explains
the sudden collapse of its fortunes and the exile of Caphtorim. But all were not thus reduced, for Meshullam, the second son of Abihail is the Masraim who fought at Kadesh against Rameses. He is called the brother of Khitasara, which he can only have been by marriage or by courtesy. Still another name for Abihail is Cypselus connecting with Corinth and Arcadia. Pausanias describes the ancient coffer with undecipherable characters in boustrophedon order in which Cypselus was preserved from the wrath of the Bacchiadae ; but he also tells how Cypselus married his daughter to the Heraclid Cresphontes, and how, when the oligarchs killed Cresphontes and all his children but one, because he was more friendly with the poor than with the rich, Cypselus took care of his grandson j:Epytus and so advanced him that the Heraclidae came to be called the >^pytidae.2 From iEpytus descended Sybotas, a Shaphat, through Glaucus, Isthmius and Dotadas. But Glaucus, who sacrificed to Machaon, the son of ^sculapius, and Isthmius his son who raised a temple to Gorgasus and Nicomachus, look suspiciously like the Zocharite Keilah the Garmite and Eshtemoa the Maachathite, sons of Nacham, introduced, through some alliance, into the genealogy. The Kenite account is that Joel the first and Shapham the next and Jaanai and Shaphat dwelt in the land of Bashan unto Salcah.^ If the Hebrew word ha Tosh, the first, were brought into connection with Shapham, it would furnish Cresphontes. Sphettus, the name of an Attic

deme, also denotes a son of Troezen. Sopeithes is the Indian form of the name as preserved by the classical geographers, who
place the people, so called after their king, near the Cathaei.* The line of Shaphat apparently belonged to the Heraclidae, and
Cresphontes may find its explanation in the place called by the Assyrian Samas-Rimmon Kar-Sibutai, which is suspiciously like the modern Khorsabad,'' Were the initial Kar prefixed to Shapham, as it here is to Shaphat, the desired Cresphontes would result, and Shaphat would be placed in the second or third generation after the Hittite Khitasara, and his aid Masraim or Meshullam, thus bringing him down to the time of Joshua's conquest. If, however, an ^pytus intervene, Shaphat will be much later, and iEpytus, like Hippotas and Hippomenes, may represent Jobab of Madon. Shapham and his sons Jaanai or Jagnai and Shaphat open up
a wide field of historical tradition. In Indian story Shapham is Asvina, and the two Asvins his sons are Jishnu and Subhaga. Whether they received their names from already existing divinities who gave names to the Assyrian months, or were the namers of the months, can hardly be determined at this stage of enquiry, but it is certain that Shapham answers to the month Sivanu or the twins, and Shaphat to Sabadhu. The equestrian Asvins were in the Greek mythology Despoina and Arion, and Pausanias makes Despoina the same as Per-sephone, daughter of Demeter and Poseidon Hippotes. The Phigalenses or people of Abichail represented Demeter or Ceres with the head of a horse. In the Zend Avesta, Cresphontes or Shapham is Keresaspa, the brother of Urvakhshya and son of Sam, a descendant ef Trita. It is related of him that, carrying the club Gaesug, he went to fight the poisonous serpent Sruvara, that with green venom killed horses and men. As the serpent lay stretched out on the bank of a river, Keresaspa mistook it for the solid earth and lit a fire on its back wherewith to cook his dinner. Then it plunged into the stream, disconcerting the hero for the time, but he afterwards slew it and the golden-heeled demon Zairi-pashna.® In Sanscrit

story the advocate of the Asvins is Chyavana, a son of Bhrigu who sprang from the fire with Kavi and Angiras. It was when Indra refused to drink Soma with the Asvins that Chyavana sent the monster Mada to swallow up the gods. The history of the Shaphathites is very obscure, but their connections come out more clearly in Mexico than elsewhere, inasmuch as it contained a colony of that people, from whom the traditions of the Zapotecs were learned by the Spaniards. The Zapotecs and Mixtecatl or Mixtecs were twin tribes, deriving their origin from two great trees which sprang into existence suddenly by the side of a river at the mouth of the pass of Apoala. They inhabited Yanquitlan and the shores of the lake of Rualo. Their Buddha-like teacher, white and bearded, wearing a pointed capuchin over his head and carrying a cross in his hand, was named Wixipecocha. He was, like Buddha, represented in a sitting position listening
to the confession of a kneeling woman. His doctrine was one of self-abnegation, of withdrawal from all the pleasures of sense, and of the practice of penitence and mortification. In Wixipecocha plainly appears Paseach, the original Pthah or Buddha, in the Hubisegan or Khupuscian form of his name ; and the lake Rualo took its name, doubtless, from Rahula, called the son of Buddha, but who is the Kenite Aharhel. The priesthood of Yopaa seems to have been connected with his creed, as well as that exercised by a succession of Wiyataos, who were kings and priests in the cavern city of Yopaa. The Mixtecs also worshipped Petela, perhaps at Mictla, where there was a mass of
ecclesiastical building called " the supreme fortress of Pezelao,"
who was the same as the Mictlan-teuctli or god of the dead among the Mexicans proper.^ Pausanias is right in connecting Cresphontes and Cypselus, for Shaphat, the ancestor of the Zapotecs, is shown by their brief history to have descended from Abihail, as Apoalo and Pezelao, while Mixtecatl or Mictla repre
sents Michael, his eldest son; and Petela, his relative Abdiel. The name of Yopaa may be that of Job connecting with Aharhel in Rualo, through Hanoch in Yancui-tlan, or it may denote Jobab of Madon as of this line. What renders the latter probable is that Zaachilla is the chief royal name among the Zapotecs, and
7 B. de Bourbourg, Nations Civilis^es, Tome iii. ch. 1.



THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 207
it is the same as Keilah or Kagilah, the Zocharite ancestor of
Jabin, king of Hazor. The Zapotecs and Mixtecs were the offspring of the two trees of Apoalo. There is no tradition associating Apulia in southern Italy with apples, although Athenaeus mentions a kind of apple called phaulian. But in the poems of the Welsh Merddin is one called the Avallenau, or the apple trees, wherein he mysteriously describes the trees which Gwenddoleu exhibited to him under the care of the divine maid Olwen.** These trees with their white blossoms were in danger from the men in black, who represent the priests of Saul of Rehoboth. They were also sacred to Gwenddolen, the lady of the white bow, whom Geoffrey makes the mother of Maddan. It may be, therefore, that Maddan and Merddin are one and the same personage, representing a branch of the Heraclidae that had given up the peaceful and monotheistic
traditions of Paseach and Job in favour of the idolatrous and barbarous rites of Samlah, or Gwendolen. Is not the vale of Avallenau that of Avilion, famous in the story of Arthur ? In Norse mythology the apples are in the possession of Iduna the wife of Bragi, but she is stolen away by the giant Thjassi through the treachery of the tempter Loki. By the absence of the apples the dwellers in Asgard languish and are threatened with extinction, when Loki reluctantly brings Iduna back and the gigantic bird
Thjassi is put to death.^ Bragi the singer is the same as the Sanscrit Bhrigu, father of Chyavana. In America the Natchez or Naktche were called the Epelois, or Apple people ; but the Apalachians of Florida were the true owners of this name. The Hitchitis and Mikasukis are classed with them by Mr. Gatschet.^^ One of their towns was Pattali, answering to the Mixtec Petela and the Kenite Abdiel. In Arrian's Periplus of the Black Sea he mentions the Apsili and Abasci of Caucasus as near neighbours, and not far off the Machelones and Heniochi under their king Anchialus. The various stories in which the apple figures, including that of the Hesperides, seem to resolve themselves into contests for the friendship of the Ekronites to whom Abihail belonged,

208 THE HITTITES.
these being captains of brave warriors, whose services were capable
of deciding the destinies of opposing forces on the battle field. They had been the guardians of the throne of Jabez, and, after the expulsion of the Caphtorim to Palestine, they adhered to the fortunes of the Paseachites and the Heraclidae. They may be traced throughout the whole area of Hittite migration, as, for instance, in northern India, where they were the Passalae and the namers of Peucela in the Punjab. This union of a Japhetic race with the fortunes of a Hittite people is a fact of great importance in ethnological research. Their connection with the family of Aharhel, son of Harum and grandson of Regem or Sargon, explains the appearance of the name Sagara as that of kings of Carchemish, and of Sagal, or Sangala, as the capital of the Cathaei in the Punjab, for this name is a version of that of Eker or Geker, the head of the race of Buz and Abihail. Besides being the same as Sukra and Sokkari, names associated with Buddha and Pthah, it also means an apple, being the Basque sagar with that signification. As two incidents in Joshua's victorious career have found illustration in the story of the Latin Hercules, it is natural to expect that the same story should make mention of Jabin, king of Hazor. It does, but with historical inaccuracy, for Evander, who is Jabin, is represented as the friend of Hercules and the enemy of Cacus. That Jabin and Grog were enemies is very likely, and the former may have rejoiced when the giant of Bashan fell
;
but, when Joshua crossed the Jordan and prepared to conquer all Canaan, he could not but rise in defence of his home and people. If Virgil is to be believed, Evander had fought under the walls of Praeneste and had slain its king Herilus, but now the time of his exile from Arcadia, the home of Pan, had come, or rather the time of the exile of his race, for Jabin, king of Hazor, was smitten with the sword and his city burned with fire. Evander is vouched for as Jabin by the name of his mother Carmenta, which denotes the senior Zocharite line of Garmi, of whom Keilah, or Kagilah, was the father. Several generations must have interposed between Garmi and Jabin, for Zophar the Naamathite, a Zephyrus from whom the Epizephyrian Locrians were named who founded Hipponum and Medma in Bruttium, was a friend of Job. The
sister of Naham also was the wife of Jether, the son of Ezra, or



THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 209
of his brother Mered. In the annals of Central America, Kagilah
is called Cuculcan, and in Celtic tradition he is named Cuchullin,
Congcullion, and Cuthullin. But in Mexican history he is the first Acolhua, the head of the Acolhua Tepanecs, who early entered Mexico and took possession of Huexotla, a Mexican Hazor, which became their capital.^^ Ossian unites the name of Cuchullin with the story of Deirdre and Naois, which, however, he tells in a way
quite different from that of the Irish historian. His Deirdre is Darthula, the daughter of Colla, who is beloved by Cairbar, the murderer of Cormac king of Ireland, but also by Nathos, the Irish Naois. This Nathos is the son of Usnoth, lord of Etha, and Slissama, the daughter of Semo and sister of Cuthullin. When Cuthullin, who was regent for Cormac, fell in putting down an
insurrection, Nathos took his place as commander of the Irish army. He carried off Darthula, but a storm drove him with his bride and his two brothers, Althos and Ardan, on to that part of the Ulster coast which was held by Cairbar. The three brothers were killed in battle and Darthula died on the body of Nathos. Cuthullin again, whose castle is Tura, must be the same person as Cathulla king of Inistore, whose palace was Carric-Thura, in which he was besieged by Frothal, king of Sora, until Fingal delivered him, Cathulla, however, is called the son of Sarno and the brother of Comala ; and in his time Fingal defeated Caracul,
who is certainly not Caracalla.^^ jjj Irjgh history, Fionn, son of Cumhal, and grandson of Trein More, the same person as Ossian's Fingal, is made the son-in-law of King Cormac. His first wife Graine was taken away from him by Diarmuid O'Duibhne, but when this took place Cormac gave him his second daughter Ailbhe in her stead. In Ossian, Comala, daughter of Sarno, was beloved by Fingal, but Roscranna, Cormac's daughter, is made his wife. It is abundantly evident that Fingal and all his race were opposed to the civilized powers represented by Erragon, Lathmon, Swaran of Lochlin, and Berrathon, who set forth the families of Regem and Beeroth. Yet his friendship with the Rephaim and descent from Samlah as Cumhal is not borne out by Irish tradition, in which Eochaidh, son of Conmaol, or Ishod, son of Samlah, is the

murderer of Cearmna and Sobhairce, or Grarmi and Zophar. Scottish history is in its legendary region largely Zerethite and Zocharite, containing in its genealogies such names as Dardanus, Evenus, Gormachus, and Domachus. or Zereth, Jabin, Garmi, and Eshtemoag. The last king of the first period of Scottish history, who is said to have fallen in battle against the Romans, was an Evenus, the fourth of that name and son of Fin Gormachus, after whose death the Scots took refuge in Scandinavia, or Lochlin.^* Lochlin is itself very like Lugalginna, the Accadian name of Sargon of Agade.^* The second period begins like the first with a Fergus, but his son was the fifth Evenus, and he was under the tutelage of his maternal grandfather Graeme. Uven and Girom appear each only once in the Pictish Chronicles, but there are several names compounded with Fen. Similar to the last is the
Eddaic Fenrir, the wolf or Calebite, and to his line, as enemies of the iEsir, belong the dog Garm or Garmer, Surtur of Muspellheim, and Loki. These, representing the Jephunnites, Garmites, Zerethites, and Amalekites, are yet, according to Scandinavian prophecy, to break forth upon the dwellers in Valhalla and involve
the universe in conflagration.^^ Thus the demons of Norse mythology are the heroes of Ossianic verse. The history of Japan ought to contain the record of this family, and it probably does, but the introduction of Chinese
characters into Japan has given to proper names in particular a vagueness that almost defies comparison with those of other histories. Everywhere, moreover, the Zocharites held a dependent position. Within the northern Hittite area, there does not seem iM have existed an independent Zocharite kingdom. In Trojan :story, the ruling family is Dardanian, not Teucrian. In Assyria the Tiglaths are a mere section of the Ashers. In Libya and 'Gyrene they were dominated by the Rephaim, and governed by •.the Buzites. So in Japan they are almost merged in the Hamathites, or j)eople of Yamato. The first king of Japan was Zinmou, also called Sano, and he was the youngest son of Fiko-no-kisa, whose mother was the sea goddess Toyo Tama, whom Fiko-fofo

or Urashima of Midzunoe lost by his curiosity. The bereaved monarch has been well identified with Kudur Mabug, or Jether
the son of Ezra; and his son Fiko-no-kisa, if the eldest of his
three sons, should be Jered or Ardu-Sin of Elam. But there is reason to think that the Japanese line is that of the Hamathites proper, and that the youngest son of Jether, namely, Jekuthiel,
is this Fiko-no-kisa, and that his son Zanoah is Zinmou or Sano.i^ The original Zanoah was in Judah near Keilah and other Zocharite places, but when moved into the north the name seems to have been changed to Zaanaim, a different word, for the
Kenites dwelt there, and in its vicinity was Hamath-Dor. It wa& thus near Hazor and Kadesh. The name Japan is nunnated in Japanese, being Niphon, but the Chinese knew the country which the Japanese call Yamato as Jipen. The honorific title of Zinmou was Ya7nato-no Iwa are Jiko-no Tnikoto, but in Chinese Jy pen phan yu yan tsun. Gofon appears to have been the name of the Seoguns, or generalissimos of the Japanese monarchs, .so that the line of Jephunneh played the same role in Japan as in Ireland, where Fionn, son of Cumhal, was the commander of the famous militia. The two accounts, separated by so great a
distance, go back to Hamath in Syria, and the earlier HamathDor in Naphtali. When, therefore, we find a Jabin on the throne of Hazor, the Katsoura where the second Japanese emperor established himself, it must be concluded, either that the name of the legitimate sovereign of the northern Hittites is suppressed, as being that of a faineant, or that Jabin was an usurper of royal
authority.. In Peru the Zocharites are well represented, for the Yupanquis come in earlier into \he list of sovereigns and are more numerous than the Amautas or Hamaths. Several Huascars are scattered among them, so that Oscar is represented, but Ossian, his father, is not to be found. Yet Osin is a Japanese name, denoting an emperor of note, the sixteenth since the commence
ment of sovereignty. He was the son of Tsou-ai, who fell fighting against the Oso of Tsukuzi, and of his warlike wife, Singou Kwogou, who carried out successfully the campaign he had begun, bringing many lands under her sway. Osin was a posthumous child, and a king from his birth. He was born with

a wen on his arm of the shape of a buckler, which gave him the name of Fonda. He dwelt at Karuno Sima, brought many colonists into the country, built great stables (which may have been the Augean ones that Hercules cleansed), instituted the judicial ordeal of boiling water, encouraged the great philosopher Wonin from Fiaksai, and after his death was honored as a god,. when eight white standards fell from the skies upon his temple.^^
His sons signalized their joint reign by an amiablb contest of renunciation of empire in favour of each other, which was ended by Ratsugo putting an end to his life for his brother's sake. Then Nintok or Osazagi, aided by the counsels of Wonin, became the father of his people, one of the most excellent monarchs that ever sat on the throne of Japan. Some new light may be shed by the story of Osin on the history of Husham of the land of Temeni, and the mysterious Sigurd or Siegfried who is connected with him, but no Fingall, save by matriarchy, can be made his
father.
With Jabin of Hazor, the Zocharite generalissimo of the
Hittites, Jobab of Madon, an exiled Heraclid, was confederate. The king of Shimron Meron, whose name connects with the waters of Merom, with Miriam the Hamathite princess, and with Saul of Rehoboth, as a Myrmidon, joined their forces. Not only
Hittites, but all the tribes of Canaan were called to make a stand against the intrusion of Israel, including the Japhetic Dorians from Dor, the Goim or Achaeans of Gilgal, and the Ekronites or Buzites from Lasharon. Some Kenites, who had retained the ancestral name of Hepher, rendered assistance. The Tappuans or Tappuchans of the family of MaReshah mustered to the fray, with the Amalekites of Kedesh, the Maachathites of Megiddo, the Paseachites of Taanach, and the men of Jokneam of Carmel, perhaps of the race of Samlah. Other levies came from Aphek, Achshaph, and Tirzah, places whose ethnical relations are undetermined, and from an equally obscure Chinneroth to the south of the sea of Galilee. Many a time the Hittites had assembled to protect their homes against Egyptians, Amorites, and hostile tribes of their own race, and had successfully rolled back the tide of war. But they had never yet encountered an army strong

in the faith of an over-ruling Providence and imtued with deep and earnest religious enthusiasm, such as that which faced them by the waters of Merom. The trained bands of Jabin could not withstand the shock of the footmen, before whom chariot and horseman, as well as heavy armed Greek and light Maachathite slinger, were driven like chaff before the whirlwind. The lord of Hazor was overthrown, his confederate kings slain all around him ; and, while the remains of as gallant a host as yet had
mustered on the fields of Palestine fled into the north country,
which was henceforth to be their home, Israel, fleet of foot, pursued and cut them down before and even beyond the walls of Sidon. Henceforth, as a people, the Hittites have no Palestinian record. The Amorites had doubtless filled up the measure of
their iniquity long before, but now that of the Hittites was full. They had owned noble characters, kings of men and reformers of religion, worthy of any nation under heaven. Such were Paseach and his better son Job, but Og of Bashan shews how the mighty had fallen. Such also, Saul of Rehoboth and Hadar, but Shimon or Agamemnon must sacrifice human victims, and Shemidag or Ismidagan reinstitute idolatry. And as great as any, or greater, was Jabez, more honourable than his brethren, whose generation had not passed before the altars of unclean gods received the
gifts of his posterity. Canaan was a polluted land, every civilized corner of which had echoed with the screams of the slain, when on its thousand altars human lives were offered with revolting
cruelty to the spirits of devils that had once been among the vilest of men. Those who accuse Israel of murder do not know of what they are talking, are ignorant of the records of those awful years that preceded Joshua's glorious march from Beersheba to Dan ; and would themselves be among the first to counsel the extermination of the royal Thugs who filled all the air with horrid apprehension, and blasphemed the God of love whom they represented and worshipped as a murderer. It is no wonder if history fails to record the men of the age of the conquest; there were none worth recording, save as a Cacus, a being of plunder and bloodshed. The Hittites began a new life in Syria, where Hamath became their great religious centre, but nearer the borders of Palestine the Zocharites built a second Hazor to replace that which Joshua



214 THE HITTITES.
had burned. The Beerothites, who had dwelt in part from Shechem to Rehob, and a branch of whom, in the elder line of Shemidah, had reigned in Babylonia, withdrew from both these
regions, the first division to found the kingdom of Hamath Zobah, east of Damascus, with its interminable line of Benhadads or Hadadezers, and the second to set up empire for a while in Mesopotamia about that old Rehoboth by the river from which Saul had emerged to become king of Gebalene and the third Osortasen of Egyptian Abydos. Of the Kenezzites nothing is recorded duringr the wars of Israel. It would seem as if the protecting arm of their kinsman Caleb the son of Jephunneh had been about them, for besides their settlements in and about Ophrah of the Abiezrites, the line of Seraiah held Kir Haraseth in Moab and the more famous Harosheth in northern Palestine, in the midst of the Goim. Caleb did not war against his kinsmen, but drove out the Anakim, killing Anak's three sons, one of whom as vEneas, son of Anchises, and descendant of Dardanus, Virgil represents as fleeing for refuge to the court of Evander. If Ahiman be this iEneas, he may indeed have fled to Hazor, but it would only be to witness Jabin's overthrow, and to make his way back rapidly to the strongholds about Hebron. There is no evident reason for the enmity of Caleb the Kenezite and the Zerethites of Arba and Anak. They were descendants of the same great mother Helah, and do not seem to have come into conflict since the ancient days, when Ethnan set up his Titanic rule in Babylonia, and was driven into Gebalene by the father of Shachar. They may also have met in Egypt, when Ziph, building his pyramid, found Beor an intruder and chased him forth again. Caleb conquered the last of the Zerethites and dwelt in Hebron, one of the only two men that had come out of the house of bondage, and he no Israelite, but a Hittite proselyte of the ancient
faith of Jabez. The Hittites left in the land, with whom Israel, falling away from the faith and virtue of Joshua's conquering
host, contracted alliances equally as with the Canaanites, were probably the Kenezzites of Harosheth, the Achashtarites of Taanach and the Zuzims of Megiddo. The Kenites also who dwelt apart at Zaanaim may have lost their pure creed, and have come to be numbered among the Hittite idolaters. Joshua was dead, and

Caleb, and Eleazar the son of Aaron, in whose stead his son Phinehas held the high priest's office. The old anarchy had returned to Canaan, every man doing that which was right in his own eyes. A watchful eye observed this from the stronghold at Rehoboth by the Euphrates. Chushan Rishathaim, the Rustam Dastan of the Persians, whom they make the son of Zaul, instead of his descendant after many generations, perceived his oppor
tunity, and swooping down like the Simurgh of his ancestor's
story upon the distracted and God-forsaken land, became Israel's
first oppressor, since his ancestress Mehetabel saved the infant Moses. In Sanscrit story he is Rishtishena, or Arshtishena, a descendant of Jahnu or Achian, and the father of Devapi and Santanu who contended for the crown. The Raja Tarangini calls him Srechthasena, the son of Megavahana, and the father of Hiranya and Toramana, who contended in like manner. He was lord of the whole earth, and was disposed to mercy. But his father Megavahana's story exhibits a strange mixture of
traditions ; for he is said to have twice offered his life on behalf
of victims condemned to die, and to have spared the lives of all creatures, but for him also the sea opened up a passage, rearing into walls on either side, while he and his army passed through to Lanka or Ceylon, and back again. The stories of Moses and Joshua at the Red Sea and the Jordan are mingled with traditions of Saul of Rehoboth, and the name of Jabin of Hazor. In Greek story, Aristodemus the Heraclid is, like Rishtishena and Srechthasena, the father of two sons, Eurysthenes and Procles, who in a similar way contended for the kingdom. Rustam's sons were Nimruz and Farimars. After eight years of oppression, during which many Hittite troops must have been
brought into the land of Israel, Othniel, the nephew of Caleb the
Kenezzite, with the aid of his kinsmen in Ophrah and Harosheth, overpowered the Beerothites, and, ruling in the fear of God, gave the land rest for forty years. Afterwards, Moab conquered
Israel at the same time that the Philistines warred asrainst them
in tlie west. From Eglon, king of Moab, the Japhetic Ehud, son of Gera, a descendant of Jamin the son of Ram and brother of Eker, according to Greek phraseology, a Minyan of Orchomenus, delivered the enslaved Hebrews ; and another foreigner Shamgar,



216 THE HITTITES.
the son of Anath, made a slaughter of the Philistines. His name is not Semitic, but his nationality is undetermined, unless, wonderful to relate, the Elamite god, Sumugur Sara, or the leader Sumugur, declare it. Assurbanipal names this divinity immediately after Ragiba, or Rechab, the ancestor of the Beerothites, but as Lagomer or Laomer was also an Elamite god, Sumugur may have been of the family of Beth Lechem.^^ His story must survive in many lands. After Shamgar's time, Israel, alternately enslaved and delivered by Hittite and Japhetic warriors, once more apostatized, and became a prey to the enemy. A century and more had passed since Joshua met the first Jabin at the waters of Merom. His posterity was still on the throne of Hittite dominion, for a second Jabin reigned in the new Hazor, which Hitter identifies with El Hazuri, to the east of
lake Merom.^" It lay, therefore, outside of Israel's domain. This
Ja])in was no mere army leader, but the head of the Hittite confederacy, under whom Sisera served as commander in chief of the allied armies. The Charashim descended from the Kenezzite Seraiah, who had been left unmolested by the Israelites, made their submission to Jabin; and their king Sisera, when, with his aid the lord of Hazor had brought the Hebrews into subjection, became the general of the army of occupation at Harosheth in Naphtali, which also sustained some relation to the Goim or Achaeans. Jabin's force was an enormous one ; he could bring into the field nine hundred iron chariots, valuable allies in warfare on the plains about Hazor, but less formidable to an enemy posted on uneven ground broken by the spurs of Carmel and the tributaries of the river Kishon.^*' No mention is made of the tribes composing the army of Sisera ; with the exception of his own Charashim or Cilicians, they lay outside of the boundaries of Canaan. The Kenites of Zaanaim were at peace with Jabin through their kinsmen of Hamath, from whom they had separated themselves, but,as regards Israel, they remained neutral. But the Zocharites of Jabin must have been there in force, by whatever

name they were called, Teucri, Paeones, Chalybes, Nasamones,
Garamantes, Enchelians. And in Harosheth also there must have been a strong Kenite contingent from Hamath and Aradus and Marathus. From Zobali the warlike Beerothites sent a host ; and from Geshiir many Zerethite soldiers came, eager to avenge the Anakim that fell at Hebron. And Maachah near at hand, looking longingly to the old home at Megiddo where its chivalry had encountered the Egyptian Pharaohs, was not slow in heeding the call to take back the heritage of its fathers. A woman judged Israel while Jabin reigned, Deborah, the wife of Lapidoth, whose name is only rescued from oblivion by that of his prophetic spouse. For twenty years the Hittite sovereign " mightily oppressed the
children of Israel," and then, when they cried to God, His spirit came upon Deborah, and she called Barak the son of Abinoam,
a man of N«,phtali, to take the men of his tribe and of Zebulon, and go forth against the enslaver of His people. Ten thousand men of the two tribes composed the patriot army that ascended Mount Tabor and proclaimed the independence of Israel. Sisera cannot have contemplated serious opposition from the revolters, whom he thought to overawe by a great display of military .strength. He was drawn, therefore, to Kishon and beyond the great plain of Jezreel, where he might have manoeuvred his nine hundred chariots, into the valley ground between Taanach and Megiddo. The onset of Barak's ten thousand, when the chariots
were entangled, showed the great captain's fatal error, but too late
to save the Hittite host. All the might of Egypt on that field
had barely won a victory from the Hittites of ancient days, but, on this occasion, ten thousand valiant men of Israel involved Sisera's great army in total overthrow. Like many others in his
train, the lord of Harosheth left his useless chariot and fled on foot, only to die an inglorious death by the hand of a woman of his own race. This was the beginning of a war that resulted in Israel breaking the Hittite yoke, and bringing the supremacy of Jabin to an end. A new enemy appeared. Hadad the son of Bedad was the first to meet Midian in the field of Moab and put a curb on their
career of savage conquest. Then they retired to Babylonia and strengthened themselves by Zerethite and other Hittite

alliances, until, in the person of Bedan, the Greek Laomedon, they placed themselves on the Zerethite throne on the shore of the Dead Sea. The next generation saw Baalchanan, uniting in himself the three families of the Midianite Zimran, and the Hittite Zereth and Amalek, the proud monarch of Gebalene. Hadar and his confederates met him and his Midianite host on Moab's plains ; and a second time the might of Midian was broken. The Zerethites fled to other regions, some back to Babylonia and Assyria, others northward to Geshur, and a gallant remnant to Kirjath Arba in Canaan. The Midianites had no national ties ; the blood of their father Abraham did not bind them to the enslaved sons of Isaac in Goshen, nor to the wandering progeny of Ishmael in Arabia. The Japhetic brethren of their mother Keturah had disowned them ; and the bonds that linked their fortunes to those of the Hittites were but temporary. The Hittite moifarchs of the east, while reigning over the Zimrites, had recognized their super
iority, calling themselves kings of Sumir first and of Accad afterwards. When the Moabite and Amorite entered upon the possession of northern Gebalene, the Cabul of the Persian historians, the
Midianite did not depart, but lent his sword to the conquerors, and woi*shipped with them at the shrine of Baal Peor. There Moses found the Celtic siren Cozbi and her fair companions enticing his warriors away from their great work of conquest and life of godliness by the charms of forbidden love. Once more
on Moab's field Midian rose to do battle, but all m vain, for Israel was strong and valorous, not yet unnerved by the barbarian
luxury and licentiousness" of the people of the land. Terrible was Midian's punishment ; every male child, every married woman was put to the sword, besides the warriors that fell in the fight. Now, however, circumstances are changed. The Israelites are the idolaters and the weak. Midian has moved northward into Karkor, east of Gilead, and has become stronger if not more righteous. The Amalekites, that ubiquitous people, are with the Midianite, and with them also are the sons of the east, the Cadmonites descended from the Horite Etam or Getam, a Greek Cadmus and Indian Gautama, and Mexican Guatimo-Tzin, or Guatimo the Prince, as well. The latter had lived in the plain
of Jezreel, named after Etam's son, from whom came the Sparti

or sown, a translation of Jezreel, the sown of God. So Midian and Amalek are bringing Etam back to his ancient home, and they lie like grasshoppers for multitude over all the plain of JezreeL The divinely appointed deliverer is a man of Israel's true
faith, but not of Israel's blood. He is of Ophrah of Abiezer, a man of Hittite race, who, through Ophrah, traces his descent from the Rephaim and the Kenezzites, from Babylonian and Egyptian kings. He casts down the altar of Baal in Ophrah, and summons the people to follow him ; but only three hundred are permitted to go on the perilous enterprise. In the beginning of the middle watch, when the invader's camp is still, the three hundred blow
their trumpets, dash their pitchers to pieces, and with torch in one hand and, in the other, the sword of the Lord and of Gideon, they fall upon the hastily-awakened multitude, killing as they pursue. All Israel is roused to action as the allies seek safety in flight, and,
keeping the fords and bridges of Jordan, they cut the fugitives down. A hundred and twenty thousand warriors fall, and Zebah and Zalmunna pay for the ravage with their lives. So Gideon ruled Israel in peace, and after his death his son Abimelech exercised sway in Shechem, where the Beerothite god Baal Berith was worshipped, and where a mixed Hittite and Amorite population seems to have dwelt. He was killed while besieging Thebez by a woman, who threw a piece of a millstone on his head. So
the Greeks relate that Pyrrhus king of Epirus, forcing his way into Argos, was killed by a heavy tile that a woman threw down upon him. Hieronymus Cardan denies this fact in the case of Pyrrhus, so that the old Palestinian tradition may have been incorporated with the history of the Epirote king. Shechem was afterwards called Neapolis from mount Ebal, and this name was transported to the Hittite country of Campania to denote the ancient city of Naples. In the Italian Neapolis a bull with a human face was worshipped under the name of Hebon. This is the Japanese god Ghiwon, which Klaproth calls a bull-headed
deity. But in Sir Edward Belcher's Voyage of the Samarang there is an illustration of this god as worshipped by the people of the Meia-co-shimahs, dependencies of the Loo Choo kingdom, which has the body of an ox joined to a human head. Sir Edward supposes this to represent the Egyptian Apis and the golden calf

of Israelii The Iroquois Hawonio, and Dacotah Hopeneche seem to be names of the same god, who is a deified Jephunneh, Faunus, or Pan, the god of rural regions and of cloven hoofs, half man, half animal, but to whom the Assyrians, Greeks, and Romans gave but two feet instead of the Japanese four. But besides this memorial of the rule of the Jabins, the Neapolitans had a strange ceremony called the Lampadephoria, instituted by one Diotimus.
The history of this institution is obscure, but it consisted in running races with lamps or torches shaded from the wind, and as the races were always run in the quarter of the Potters, whose wares were broken on the occasion, the Lampadephoria may be regarded as a reminiscence of Gideon's famous victory. The god of the Rephaim, namely Jumala, was worshipped in Neapolis as Eumelus ; and it is not unlikely that the connected Sibyl of Cumae called Herophile stood in some definite relation to Gideon as Jerubbaal.^ Among the judges of Israel after Gideon and his son Abimelech there appears Ibzan of Bethlehem, whose name is not Hebrew
;
he may have been a descendant of Lechem, son of Salma the Hepherite.^ But Abdon, or Bedan, the son of Hillel, and a Pirathonite, whose home and burial place were in the mount of the Amalekites, presents a curious genealogy. It goes back to the time of Bedan, the son of Ulam, the Zimrite, who became, as Laomedon, the king of the Zerethites through a marriage of his father into the family of Ardon the Zerethite, son of Ur and Jeri
goth. The Pei*sian historians invert the true order, making Abtin the father of Feridun, and Iraj or Ur, his son. This Ardon or Feridun is the Duryodhana of the Mahabharata. Bedan's line again, either through his daughter or that of his uncle Rakem, was connected with the Amalekites, so that Baalchanan became the heir of Bedan and his successor on the Zerethite throne, being recognized, at the same time, as an Amalekite or Temenite. Bedan's descendants were known to the Assyrians as the Patin
ians and are generally classed with the Hittites. As the Bithynians of Asia Minor they were separated from the neighbouring

Paphlagonians by the river Parthenius. Among the Samnites, who were really, as their tribes show, Damnites or Temenites, some Bedauites or Pitanatae dwelt, who are said to have come from Laconia. The Celtic area from Pannonia west and northward is full of records of the Bedanites. This hybrid family must have maintained itself from the time of the conquest of Canaan in the mount of the Amalekites until it came to be regarded as part of Israel, and gave Abdon or Bedan to be a judge in the land. The other judges of Israel appear to have been Israelites proper ; but the marvellous thing is that Saul, the first king over that people, is said to have been a man of Jemini, and that his descent from Benjamin cannot be traced. This, however, does not concern Hittite history, save in this, that the name of Saul was the original property of the Beerothites, among whom it became an honoured one as that of the king of Gebalene who kept court at Rehoboth on the Euphrates and at Abydos in the land of Egypt. The Philistines were now the enemies of Israel ; and the Hittites, ceasing to make any attempt to regain Palestine, were spreading abroad and consolidating their empire in Syria and Mesopotamia. The Amalekites and a remnant of the Kenites were still in the south country towards Egypt and Sinai. Saul defeated their king Agag ; and David afterwards completed the destruction of his people.^* But the Kenites were allowed to move northwards into Judah, alongside of the Japhetic Jerachmeelites. When David was an exile in Gath, he professed to King Achish that he had smitten these two families friendly to the Hebrews. He also stated that he had invaded the border of the Cherethites, evidencing that some of the maritime Zerethites kept the coast below Philistia, which they had held with varying success from early Egyptian days.'^^ From these Cherethites came part of David's body-guard ; the other division consisting of Japhetic Pelethites of Ionian descent, whose ancestor was Peleth the great gmndson of Onam, the namer of On in Egypt and Ono in Palestine. ^^ Many Hittites were among David's chief captains, in addition to Uriah whom the king so grievously wronged. Such were Nahari the Beerothite, an ancient Briton, Eliphelet the Maachathite, Heleb

222 THE HITTITES.
and Maharai the Netophathites, Benaiah the Pirathonite, Igal of Zobah, Helez the Paltite, Uzzia the Ashterathite, Hepher the Mecherathite, Joshaphat the Mithnite, Shama and Jehiel the Aroerites, and the chief of all his host, Jashobeam the Hachmonite, or Tachmonite, a descendant of the Zerethite Achiman slain in the country about Hebron by Caleb the Kenezzite.-^ Other captains may have belonged to the same warlike and faithful race,
but their nationality is doubtful. In David's time there were at least seven Hittite kingdoms of
note to the north and east of Palestine. With one of these he was at peace, having married Maachah, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur.^ From Geshur also, in all probability, came the Tachmonite, who was the chief of David's host. When Saul's faction
was defeated, the Philistines and Moabites brought to quietness, and the Jebusites driven out of Jerusalem, the warlike king of Israel turned his steps northward. There he found Hadadezer the son of Rehob on the throne of Hamath Zobah, possessed of two great treasure cities, Tibhath and Berothai.. The Syrians of Damascus came to help the men of Zobah against the Hebrew invader, but David's warriors prevailed.^ The treasures of gold and brass were taken away, garrisons were placed in Damascus and in Zobah, and the Syrians became the servants of the crown of Israel. Toi the king of Hamath, between whom and Hadadezer the old enmities had been rekindled, gave in his submission to the conqueror, and sent hira costly presents by the hand of his son Joram.^** After this the Ammonites barbarously treated David's envoys who had come with a message of mingled congratulation and condolence, and, having offended the greatest monarch of the earth in his day, they prepared for war. Hanun, son of Nahash, their new king, gathered the forces of the north together with promise of reward. From Hamath Zobah and Beth Rehob, from Tob and from Maachah the hirelings came to Rabbah of Ammon, but Joab overcame the Hittites, and the Ammonites fled before Abishai, David's geueral.^^ These Hittite

kingdoms are called Aram or Syrian, a term that must refer to their original population and not to their rulers, who were all Hittites. When Hadadezer saw that the confederates were
defeated, he called to his aid the so-called Syrians or Aramaeans beyond the river, who were the Hittite Nairi of Mesopotamia. These crossed over to the help of their compatriots and mustered at Helara, or Elam, in Zobah, under Shophach the captain of the host of Hadadezer.^^ Then when David, gathering all Israel together, went forth to meet this formidable array, there was
fought one of the decisive battles of history. Israel was victorious, with seven hundred captured war chariots, and forty thousand horsemen of the enemy among the slain, for no account was taken of the footmen. So the Hittites became the servants of David and of his son Solomon after him. Only the little king
dom of Geshur afforded a retreat to the rebel Absalom. As to the constituents of these Hittite kingdoms, the substratum was Aramaic and unhistorical in all of them. The Hepherites had the kingdom of Hamath proper in the main line, and the three kingdoms of Zobah, Beth Rehob, and Damascus in that of the second Rechabite or Beerothite division, four out of seven. The junior or Peltite line of the Achuzamites or Zuzim reigned in Maachah ; the junior or Asareel line of the Zerethites, in Geshur
;
and the Paseachite branch of the Chelubite Achashtarites, in Tob. The latter, however, must have been but a remnant, most of their brethren occupying Mesopotamia. Changes had taken place, therefore, since the days of Chushan Rishathaim, for his Beerothites had been expelled from Mesopotamia by the Nairi or Mehirites, and the Zocharites of Hazor, under their Jabins, had left the sea of Merom for a more northern home. With them the Cilicians of Harosheth had departed. Some unchronicled migration had removed the Kenezzites of Ophrah and Abiezer, and the Temenites whose home had been Kadesh. In the west also, between Phoenicia and Philistia, there must have been a manning of vessels to creep along the Syrian shore and colonize with Dorians, Achaeans, Pelasgians, and lonians, the islands of the Levant and the coasts of Asia Minor ; and in these vessels went bards, who whiled away the time with songs of the olden days,

224 THE HITTITES.
the scenes of which were Palestine and Egypt, Babylonia and Gebalene, full of the Hittite heroes who were the great men of the world's youth, but songs soon to be so distorted as to lose in
other lands all their historical significance. The Bible is not yet done with the Hittite, even as far as David's reign is concerned. When Absalom came back from the court of Talmai, son of Ammihud, King of Geshur, and drove his aged father from the throne, the faithful ones that accompanied the monarch's fallen fortunes were not Israelites. ^^ Foremost among the loyal and true were the Cherethites, brave sons of Zereth, mercenaries it is true, but mercenaries with hearts that loved the warrior king and that would not be tempted with Absalom's gold, and Japheth, the elder brother, came not a whit
behind Ham's noblest offspring, for the Ionian Pelethites kept step with the Cherethite march, and the Gittites of Philistia, men of Gath, blue-eyed, fair-haired Goths as they were beneath a Syrian sun, passed on under the leadership of Ittai, an ancient Ida, before the king, and refused to do otherwise for all that
king's entreaties. In the later years of Solomon's reign, Damascus became an independent Hittite kingdom under Rezon, son of Eliadah, who had been an officer of Hadadezer of Zobah, and
did injury to Israel's interests in the north.'^* This kingdom
became strong under Hezion, Tabrimmon, and a succession of Benhadads. The other northern kingdoms revolted soon after, for Solomon had unwittingly provided them with the means for defying his power. As a merchant-man, he may have shewn wisdom in importing from Egypt chariots and horses for the
Kings of Syria, and for all the kings of the Hittites,^* but, as an emperor over many kingdoms, he would have acted more wisely in discouraging their armaments, and turning their attention to peaceful pursuits. In the time of Ahab and Jehoram of Israel, Benhadad of Syria Damascus did great damage to the kingdom, and besieged Samaria at length, bringing dire famine into the royal city. But the Syrians heard a noise of chariots and horses
and a great host, and fear fell on them that Israel had hired the

THE HITTITES IN PALESTINE AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 225
kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians, to war against them ; so they fled, and Samaria was saved.*® But Hazael, as pure a Hittite as any, murdered his master Benhadad, and became the head of a new dynasty, and fought with Israel in Gilead. He was the conqueror of his age, taking all the country beyond Jordan, and Gath of the Philistines, and only abstaining from the siege of Jerusalem on the payment of large tribute money from King Jehoash,^^ But Jehoahaz of Israel and all his people were the servants of Hazael and his son Benhadad, who worthily as warriors sustained the reputation of the family
of Beeroth. A Saviour, however, arose for the Israelites in the proud and gallant yet idolatrous Joash, who beat Benhadad three times, though with few men and poor equipment, and took back
all the cities of the kingdom of Saraaria.^^ Still greater was his son, the second Jeroboam, who recovered the Hittite kingdoms of Damascus and Hamath, which had been lost to Israel since the days of Solomon ; but these lands did not long remain in the
possession of his race.^^ Menahem, the usurper, came in contact with the Hittites, crossing the wilderness to Thapsacus, the capital of the Nairi in Mesopotamia. He took the city when it refused to open its gates to him, and behaved with barbarous
ferocity towards its inhabitants.^*^ Then the new Assyrian empire arose under the Babylonian Phul, and Israel could hope
for no more Hittite conquests. The last Hittite monarch whom the Bible mentions is Rezin of Damascus who allied himself with Pekah of Israel in an attempt to dethrone Ahaz of Judah.*^ The Jewish king sought the aid of Tiglath Pileser of Assyria who took Rezin and put him to death, thus ending Hittite rule in southern Syria. Sargon brought Hittites from Hamath and Ava into Samaria to replace the Israelites whom he had carried into the east.^^ After the destruction of Jerusalem also by Nebuchadnezzar, certain men made an insurrection and slew

CHAPTER XVIII.
The HiTTiTES in contact with the Assyrian Empire.
Evidence has been already adduced to show that the earliest monarchs of Assyria who have left records were Hittites of the line o£ Zereth and of the family of Ziph, the eldest son of Jehaleleel. The Assyrian name is found in the Kenite Asher, who heads the list which contains Heber, the Shafra that follows Chufu in Egypt, and the Ibil-Sin that succeeds Sabu in Babylonia.^ But the name which presents a sure connection is that of the Assyrian Assur Yupalladh, the Kenite Japhlet, son of Heber and great-grandson of Asher. The Synchronous History of Assyria and Babylonia makes him the contemporary of CaraMurdaS the Babylonian, who was the son of his daughter Mupallidhat-Serua and of the Rehob that named Rehoboth (m the Euphrates. This Rehob was the son of Cara-Indas, or Hadadezer. The Synchronous History places before Yupalladh the names Buzur Assur and Assur-Bil-Nisisu in ascending series
;
but the Kenite genealogy places, in the same order, Heber, Berigah, and Asher. At present the discrepancy cannot be
reconciled. Professor Rawlinson places, after Assur Yupalladh, one Bel-Sumili-Kapi, who probably represents Shomer, the brother of Japhlet, the father of Ahi, Rohgah, Jehubbah, and Aram.2 Contemporary with this monarch, or immediately after
him, should be placed Bil-Pasqu, whom an inscription in the
British Museum calls " the origin of royalty."^ He is Pasach the eldest son of Japhlet, and the brother of Bimhal and Ashvath^ from the last of whom Aswad took its name. The record following is a mere list of names, Bellush, Budiel, and Iva-lush,
1 For these names see Smith's Early History of Babylonia, Records of the Past, vols. iii. and v. ; Sayce's Synchronous History of Assyria and Babylonia, Records of the Past, vol. iii. ; and Pinches' List of Babylonian Kings, Proc. Soc. Bib. Arch. Dec. 7, 1880, p. 21, and Jan'y 11, 1881, p. 37. * 1 Chron. vii. 34. 8 .Lenormant's Manual, i. 507.



228 THE HITTITES.
representing a dynasty, if the names be correctly rendered, which superseded that of Asher. Shalmanezer or Shallim-manu-uzur follows, and he is evidently a Hittite of the line of Chedorlaomer, who was the father of Salma, the head of the house of Lechem or Beth Lechem, but whose descent on the mother's side from the Horite Manahath introduced Manu into the Assyrian nomen
clature. With his successor, who is variously called TuklatSamdan, Tiglathi-Nin, and Tukulti-Ninip, history recommences, for he is said to have been the conqueror of Babylonia and Chaldea ; and Sennacherib states that he reigned GOO years before him, or about 1,300 B.C., at the time when the second Jabin was oppressing the Israelites. The name of this Assyrian monarch suggests the entrance of the Zocharites into the ruling family of Nineveh, for, as Tigris is to Diklath, so is Zochar or Tsochar to Tiglath, and both words recall the Deucalion, Thessaly, Taxila, Dascylitis forms of Zochar. His successor was Bil-KudurUzur, whose name is Hepherite, and might belong to the line of Salma, son of Kudur-Nanhundi or Chedorlaomer, or to that of Ezra, whose son Jether was Kudur-Mabug. In his reign the Babylonians rebelled under Binbaliddin, who, after driving out the Assyrian army, invaded Assyria, put Bil-Kudur-Uzur to death and carried away trophies of his conquest. Professor Sayce calls Binbaliddin, Rimmon-Pal-Iddina, which would connect him with the family of Harum the father of Acharchel, for Harum is the Rimmon of the Assyrians, the Rim-Agu, as well as the Naram-Sin, of the early history of Babylonia. Rimmon is the Semitic word for a pomegranate, as Side is the Greek ; and this explains the marriage of Orion and Side, and of the Indian Rama and Sita. Arman-Agarsal or Harum-Acharchel figures in a previous part of the Synchronous History, and Agarsal is mentioned in a subsequent paragraph as a city of Babylonia. The king who followed Kudur-Uzur is called Adarpalashir, Adar-Pileser, Nin-Pala-Zira, and Ninip-Pal-Zara. He fought a great battle under Ellasar and repelled the Babylonians. The name that elsewhere is associated with both elements of that of Ninip-Pileser is Tiglath ; thus we find Tiglath-Ninip, and TiglathPileser. It is not likely that any mistake has been made in bringing the Zocharites into the Assyrian royal family. They



THE HITTITES IN CONTACT WITH THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE. 229
divided Assyria with the Zerethites, filling the south with their names, as Zereth filled the north. The very word for man in Assyrian was Zicaru, like the Circassian Zugcher, people. Now the Zocharites had no name Niuip, Nin, Adar ; but a name of Ninip is Nin-kattin-barzil, the man with the iron coat, answering to the Hittite Amraphel. Arbela or Beth-Arbel was a famous place in Assyria, and Ctesias has an Arabelus among his later Assyrian kings ; these represent the elliptical form of Amraphel. As monarchs of Assyria, however, speaking the Semitic language of the unhistorieal descendants of Asshur, the Hittite conquerors would naturally translate their names. Such a puzzling translation occurs even in the family of Saul of Israel, a son of Jonathan being called Merrib-baal and Mephibo-sheth. In the next king, Assur-Dayan, the Zerethite family of Asher returned to sovereignty. He invaded Babylonia, on the throne of which Zamama-Suma-Iddin was seated, and captured his cities Zaba, Irriya, and Agarsal. He is greatly eulogized by the first
Tiglath Pileser. Little is known of his successor Mutakkil-Nebo, whose name shews that the Ethnanite Di Nhaba was not forgotten in Assyria, although Babylonia was more celebrated for the worship of the son of Baal Peor. But his son Assur-Ris-Ilim fought with Nebo-Kudur-Uzur of Babylonia, and overthrew him. The name of the Babylonian is significant. Its Kudur-Uzur proclaims him a man of Gedor, of the family of Ezra the Hamathite ; but the Nebo, appearing almost simultaneously in Assyria and Babylonia, suggests that the Ethnanites had betaken themselves to the east, and that the two kingdoms were contend
ing for their alliance. Here, therefore, is the point at which the fugitives or emigrants from Elephantine, whose migration story is told by the Cachiquels of Guatimala, must have lost their Hittite speech, and have picked up the worship of Tohil or Tockill, the Tiglath of the Assyrians. The next monarch of Assyria is Tiglath Pileser the First, whose long inscription takes us out of the narrow field between the southern courses of the Tigris and Euphrates into the purely
Hittite area in the north and west.* The date of his inscription is supposed to be 1130, B.C., when Samuel the prophet and
* Records of the Past, v. 7.



230 THE HITTITES.
Samson judged Israel. The king of Babylonia in his time was Merodach-Iddin-Akhi, who successfully invaded Assyria and carried off the spoil of the city Hekali, pait of which Sennacherib
recovered 418 years afterwards. Tiglath Pileser retaliated and captured Babylon, Opis, and other cities. The name Merodach has been found to mean the son of Beor, being thus equivalent to Baal Peor ; the Ethnanites, therefore, were on the Babylonian throne. While Iddin, as a constitutent in Babylonian royal names, reproduces the Atin-re or god of the solar disc worshipped at Tel Amarna in Egypt, rather than the ancestral Ethnan, and thus indicates that the Babylonian monarchs of this line had come out of the land of the Pharaohs, it seems that the tradition of Beius and Ninus, as the first rulers in the east, arose with them out of a misconception of three facts in ancient history. The first fact was that Ethnan, the son of Ashchur, really made a beginning of royalty in Babylonia, out of which his posterity were soon
driven ; the second, that Bela, son of Beor, actually reigned in the neighbouring country of Gebalene ; and the third, that Hammurabi, the son of Eshton, who founded Babylon, took Baal Peor, or Merodach, for his god, although he belonged to a
totally different branch of the Hittite family. The first purely
Hittite country to engage the attention of Tiglath Pileser was
one that plays a prominent part in Hittite history. It is better to speak of the object of his attention as a people than as a
country, for in his time populations were shifting ; yet he calls the region in which this people dwelt the country of Comukha. There is no doubt that the Comukhans were the Commagenians, but there is also no doubt that these Commagenians had not reached northern Syria. Tiglath Pileser found them on the Tigris, which they crossed to escape from him, establishing them
selves in the city of Sherisha, which must be Strabo's Sareisa of the Gordyseans or Carduchi. The Commagenians of Syria had
Samosata for their capital ; it may, therefore, be inferred that
their original name was Sama or Samag. Their earliest appearance in geographical history would be at Lake Samachonites or Merom, under mount Hermon. The Kenite genealogies present many competitors for the honour of conferring this name. Shammai, in the family of Ezra, was the ancestor of the Hamathite



THE HITTITES IN CONTACT WITH THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE. 231
Shimeathites, with whom the posterity of Miriam or the Meronothites and namers of Merom were intimately connected.^ In the line of Ma Reshah appear Shammai, son of Rekem and father of Maon, and Shema father of Raham." The Paseachites had a Shemaiah and a Shiraei on either side of Gog ; and Sheraa was
the son of Joel the son of Aharhel.'^ Several of these names end with the letter ayin, so that they may be pronounced Shemag. A survey of the Hittlte colonies narrows the enquiry to the families of Paseach and Aharhel, so intimately united in the
genealogies. The island of Samos was possessed by the Carians
or Ekronites, relatives and allies of both these families ; but Samothrace is linked through the stories of Jasion father of Plutus, Harmonia, and Hercules, with that of Aharhel the Achuzamite. Cyme in ^olis of Asia Minor determines nothing,
for while its name Cyme Phriconis associates it with Larisa, its proximity to Hermus, Caicus, Myrina, and other places with
Hittite names belonging to many different families, deprives it of
any definite relation to one ; nevertheless it was most likely a foundation of the Ras. Cumae of Campania has Paseachite and Heraclid connections, and the same may be said of many places similarly named. The centre of the Paseachite family for several centuries was Thapsacus on the Euphrates, and there is no evidence that it ever made establishments in the neighbourhood of Commagene. But Commagene in northern Syria was in close proximity to Carchemish, the Hittite capital, in which the posterity of Regem, Aharhel's grandfather, dwelt. It is probable, therefore, that Shemag, son of- Joel, and grandson of Aharhel, was the eponym of Commagene. The Muskayans or Moschi had taken possession of part of this primitive Commagene on the northern borders of Assyria and Mesopotamia. Tiglath Pileser defeated them, and then attacked the Commagenians. Sir Henry Rawlinson calls one of the Commagenian kings Kili-Teru, son of Kali-Teru, son of Zarupin-Zihusun ; Professor Sayce styles him Cili-Anteru, son of Cali-Anteru, son of Saru-pin-sihusuni ; Mr. Fox Talbot's title is

232 THE HITTITES.
Tirikali fil Tirikali ; and that of Dr. Hincks, Kiliantiru, eldest son of Campinei-yusan. These are grave discrepancies. From a Hittite standpoint the higher criticism would favour Mi-. Talbot's reading, but such criticism can never lawfully override the work of the philologist. A stronghold of Commagene was Urrakluiras, which certainly contains Acharchel's name. Opposite to the island of Samos was the promontory Trogilium, which answers to Tirikali, and not far off were Heraclea and Euromus. The king of Urrakluiras was Shedi-Teru, son of Khasutkh, according to Sir Henry Rawlinson, Sadi-Anteru son of Khattukhi, according to Professor Sayce ; Dr. Hincks terms him Sadiyantim son of Khathukhi, and Mr. Fox Talbot, Tiridates son of Kuthakin. He
belonged to the country of Panari. So far as names go, the evidence is in favour of making this king a descendant of Penuel, who, by the marriage of his daughter, became the father of Gedor. He was no Hittite but a Cadmonite of the family of Getam or Etam, whose fortunes were linked largely with those of the Hittites. His brother was Ezer the father of Chushah, the head of the Chushathites.^ Penuel explains Panari ; Chushah, Khasutkh ; and Ezer, Teru or Anteru : for the na.sal pronunciation of the initial ayin of Ezer would cause it to be rendered by foreigners as Agra or Nagra, as in India, and by Adra and Andra as in Assyria and in Greek speaking countries. There must, therefore, have been a fusion of part of the Cadmonite family with that of the Heraclidae. Through the country of Aruma, an embryo Armenia taking its name from Harum, Tiglath Pileser went to one called by the different translators already named
Miltis, Eshtish, or Yem, and afterwards to Subair, an extensive region, and Alza and Purukhuz. Subair was the country about the Chaboras, named after Heber or Cheber the Zerethite, and Purukhuz bore the name of his father Berigah, the ancestor of the Phrygians. This branch of the family of Asher had been expelled from Assyria, whose empire it had founded, and occupied the central part of northern Mesopotamia. As a Zerethite
people, the Phrygians retained the name of Gordius for their kings, and, as the Zerethites were from antiquity the allies of the Midianites, their Phrygian descendants alternated Gordius with
« 1 Chron. iv. 4.

Midas. Two tribes of the Kheti, the Kaskaya and Hurunaya, had taken possession of part of Subair or Mesopotamian Iberia, and had seduced the Iberians from the worship of their ancestor Ashiir, but they submitted on the approach of the Assyrian monarch. Here the name Kheti is reserved for the senior Hittite line, that of Achuzam, from whom Haran and Gazez descended. They dwelt in Charran and Gauzanitis, between the Bellas and the upper waters of the Chaboras. Once more Tiglath Pileser ravaged Commagene, and thence passed into the country of Kharia and to the far-spreading tribes of the Akhe. He met the warriors of these people in Azutapis, which is apparently Thospitis in southern Armenia. The Kharians were not the Japhetic sons of Eker and Buz, for their cities Suira, Shelgu, Arzanibru and Ayu correspond to Shual, Shelesh, Harnepher, and Ahi, names of descendants of Berigah the Zerethite.^ But no Kharian ancestor appears in their line ; and there are indications which point to the incorporation of these Asherite families with the descendants of Korah, the eldest son of Hebron, and grandson of Ma Reshah. Hittite settlements had already been made in Media, for the Assyrian king relates that, after subduing the people of Adavas, Tsaravas and Ammavas in Aruma or Armenia, he crossed the lower Zab, named after Ziph the ancient Zerethite, and brought Muraddan and Tsaradavas, near Atsania and Atuva, into his power. The people of Muraddan must be the same as the Amardi or Morundae about Martianus Lacus, and probably represent part of the posterity of the Kenite Mered. But the other names ending in va, vas and davas recall the topographical nomenclature of Dacia with its endless davas and dovas. Tiglath Pileser mentions also the countries of Gilkhi and Khirikhi, but gives no information as to their site. More solid ground is reached when he enumerates the kings of the Nairi, to conquer some of whom at least he was compelled to cross the Euphrates. These Nairi, as the descendants of Mehir the father of Eshton, should include the three families of Rapha, Paseach, and Techinnah, but other Hittite tribes seem to have been numbered with them. Tseni, king of Dayani or Tehinnah is the only monarch named, so that he may

have been • the head of the Nairi Confederacy at the time. Paseach is unmentioned, unless Khimua represent a city named after his descendant Shemaiah. Beth Rapha as Khani-Rabbi appears apart from the Nairi but along with the king of Dayani, and Milidia is said to belong to that people, a place which must have been named after Moloketh the wife of Samlah rather than after their son Mahalah. Paiteri probably denotes Abiezer. The line of Amalek stands out prominently in Albaya, Hugina, and Pilakinna. Aturgina is an oriental Tirchanah ; Tunubi, a Dinhabah ; Huzula perhaps a Hazor; and Tuhali, a Zohar. In Nazabia a Mezahab may be found, although such a name would rather be sought among the Moschi. Yet the Moschi were in part counted to the Nairi, for their city Sururia appears in the list. Kidari or Kindari is a transplanted Gedor ; Abaeni, a Jephunneh, Jabin, or abbreviated Jabneel ; and Andiabi, a
Netophath. The unidentified eight are Araassihuni, Kirini, Adaeni, Huiram, Pigikanni, Kulimazzini, Unzamuni and Numme. The last of these may be the Zocharite Naam, or the Beerothite Aniam, but one would expect to see Nacham for the former and Anigam for the latter. This fact remains, that before the time of Saul king of Israel, there was in north-western Mesopotamia and in the neighbouring region of Syria a confederacy of twenty

three Hittite kings under the presidency of a descendant of Mehir
the Achaslitarite. Tiglath Pileser next mentions Karkamis or Carchemish as a city of the Khatte, making his conquests extend from the land of the Tsukha or Shuhites in the south, northward to that city, but he does not say that it was among his captures. How long Carchemish had been founded we have no means of knowing, but it certainly was not in existence in the old days of Egyptian and Hittite warfare. At this time it was regarded as a Hittite Ultima Thule. Somewhere in northern Syria, probably in what afterwards became Commagene and Cyrrhestica, the Assyrian monarch found the Comani and the Muzri. Between them, for the record is not clear, they possessed Elammi, Tala, Kharutsa, Arin, Khunutsa, and Kapshuna. The names Khunutsa and Kharutsa seem to set forth the Kenezzites of Charosheth, once under the command of Sisera. As for the Comani, they were an

advanced guard of the Beerothites, bearing the name of Shimon, the son of Hadar ; and Arin and Tala were places named in honor ofr Rinnah and Tilon, two of Shimon's sons. The name Muzri may have been applied to both nations as exiles from the
land of Mizriam. It is interesting to find Tiglath Pileser rebuilding the temple founded by Ismidagon or Shemidag, Shimon's grandson, and fighting in the north with his descendants, the Comani. The strong Hittite kingdoms in central and southern Syria he left undisturbed, feeling he had acquired sufficient glory
by penetrating the deep forests and difficult mountain chains of northern Mesopotamia and southern Armenia, which no king of Assyria had ever reached before him. His lord Asliur impelled him to set about the great undertaking to conquer the powerful kings who dwelt upon the upper ocean, an enterprise in which he partially succeeded ; for, tell it not in Gath, his upper ocean was lake Van. Even in his day, the habitable world was small

Assur-Bil-Kala was the next Assyrian monarch, of whom there are two fragmentary records, one of which states his conquest of Babylonia, and the other that of the Western Land, which certainly was not Palestine.^'' Samas-Rimmon, his brother and successor, did nothing of any importance, but his name is
significant, both of its elements being found in the senior Hittite family as Harum and Shemag.^^ Assur-Rabu-Amar came to the throne in evil days, but unhappily there are no particulars of his catastrophe. The Hittites threw off" the Assyrian yoke, and about the year 1070 B.C., while Saul was king over Israel, they defeated his army and regained their independence.^^ A new Assyrian dynasty is supposed to have begun with Belkatirassu, the Beletarus of the Greeks, who was followed by five kings of whom nothing is known but the names.^^ But with the sixth, Vul-Nirari, the Eponyra Canon begins and informs us, through calculation, that he reigned from 95G to 936 B.C. The history of
Assyria is, therefore, a blank from the early part of the reign of Saul in Israel, down to those of Jeroboam and Asa in the divided

kingdom.^* From the Hebrew Scriptures, however, we have learned that the Nairi made common cause with the Hittite kings of Syria against David, and met with a signal defeat ; and that Solomon reigned from Thapsacus to Gaza.^^ Tiglath Ninip followed Vul-Nirari, and made warlike expeditions in Armenia towards the sources of the Tigris against the Hittite tribes, of which there is but a bare record.^* His successor, Assur-AkhBal has left two inscriptions, of which one only mentions his conquests. He subdued the Nairi, Kirkhi, and Subari of Mesopotamia, together with the land of Nireb. The Nairi are well known ; the Subari are the Zerethite Heberites or Iberians about the Chaboras ; the Kirkhi are probably the Korachites of Ma Reshali, who incorporated some Iberian tribes ; and the men of Nireb are the people who named Kirjath Arba, and who dwelt at this time below the Chaboras. He brought under his sway the Achashtarite Shuhites and Laki in southern Mesopotamia and Babylonia, and is the first to mention Urardi, the land of the Alarodians, descended from the Zerethite Jehaleleel, who had thus in some of their branches left Assyria and betaken themselves to the mountains of Armenia. In northern Syria he carried off Lubarna, king of the Patinians, and reduced the lands of Zamia and Bit-Adini, the former of which may be Commagene under its native name Shema, while the latter seems to have been an Aramaean conquest of the Ras." The history of this monarch's successor, Assur-Nazir-Pal, has been fully considered in connec
tion with the Lion Inscription of Merash, which indicates, better than any Assyrian monument could, the extension of the Hittites in his time. It shows Habini as a king of kings over the nation of the Ras and neighbouring peoples, from the centre of Armenia westward into Cappadocia, Saravene or Beth Zur being his kingdom proper. To the south of his dominions lay the realm of Commagene under a strong monarch, whom he calls Hapisati, but whom the Assyrian king names Kundaspi, In Carchemish at the same time dwelt Sangara, calling himself king of Syria '> and in Thapsacus or Khupuscia the king of the Nairi was

THE HITTITES IN CONTACT WITH THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE. 237
another king of kings. Kasyari or Geshur had become a powerful kingdom under Labduri, the son of Dubuzi, having moved northwards from Mesopotamia towards Armenia. The great opponent of Assur-Nazir-Pal however, was Akhuni son of Adini, who possessed Bit-Adini, and was the general of the armies of Habini of Ras. Over the Hittites or Khatti, who seem to have been near the Orontes, Lubarna was king, with a capital called Kunalua. The two names Kunalua and Lubarna indicate that the Kenezzite line of Gothniel and Leophrah had usurped the throne of the Achuzamites, and had brought the
Patinians, or posterity of the Zimrite Bedan, under their sway. The fate of a word like Gothniel is to lose one of its medial con
sonants, and, as these are both dentals, the first is most likely to disappear. In several cases, however, by transposition both
are preserved, as in Khintiel, the name of a king of the Shuhite Laki, and in the Greek Candaules. The Greek Sthenelus presents the most complete rendering of Gothniel. In Mexico the equivalent of Kunalua is Sinaloa. Its tribes speak the Cahita language and are the Yaquis, Mayos, and Tehuecos.^^ The Mayos
are hard to identify, but the Tehuecs are the Zochethites, and the Yaquis, the men of Ishi. The wide extension of the two Kenezzite families of the Charashim or Cilicians and of the Zochethites must date from the time of this conquering Lubarna,
who incorporated, at least in his own division of the stock, a
large foreign element, Achuzamite and Midianite. Thus the great victories of Assur-Nazir-Pal were gained, not without much hard fighting, over Hittite states that reached from Babylonia, through all Mesopotamia, northward to the Moschic region south of the Caucasus, and from the eastern borders of Armenia, westward to the centre of Cappadocia, as well as over all Syria. The inscription of Habini of Ras shows that the Assyrian monarch was looked up to by the Hittite nations as an arbiter or judge ; and he seems to have kept them under tribute by force of arms.^^ In the time of his son Shalmanezer, Cacia was king of the Nairi in Khupuscia. He rebelled, and the Assyrian burned his

city and a hundred that were dependent upon it. This was not hard work, for the Hittite cities were generally built of wood upon a natural or artificial mound. The Armenians liad a king bearing the ancestral name Arame. His city, Sugunia, was burnt and fourteen dependent ones with it. Katazilu of Comraagene, and Mutallu of Gamgume or Zuzim, who had regained his independence, submitted to Shalmanezer ; but other Hittite monarchs strove to reorganize the old confederacy. These were Sangara, king of Carchemish, a descendant, probably, of the Japhetic Eker, and the Hittite suzerain ; Akhuni son of Adini, who ruled in western Armenia ; Khanu of the Samahlians, who occupied the country to the north of Adini and Ras on both sides of the Euphrates, including Melitene and Analiba or Khanirabbi
;
Pikhirim of Cilicia, at length in the country with which the
name of the Charashim is most identified ; and two allied peoples, the Midianite Patinians under Sapalulme and the Midianite Yazbukians, descendants of Ishbak, under Buranate. Shalmanezer defeated the confederates and took cruel vengeance upon them. The gallant Akhuni son of Adini made many a stand, but was at last taken at the upper waters of the Euphrates. As Tul Barsip was his capital, it is probable that he was a Zerethite of the family of Asher, whose grandson was Malchiel, the father of
Birzavith. He certainly exhibited the indomitable valour of the Cherethite. Shalmanezer, having subdued the northern Hittites, turned his attention to those of central and southern Syria, whom
the Assyrian kings had so far left undisturbed. Hamath, another centre of many petty kingdoms, first felt his power, and Irkhulena, the descendant of Joram and Toi, was robbed of his treasures, and condemned to gaze upon his blazing cities. The Assyrian king was met by a host contributed by eleven kings, of whom Irkhulena of Hamath, and Rimmon Hidri or Benhadad of Damascus were the only Hittites, the others being Ahab of Israel, who sent 10,000 men, Matin-Baal of Arvad in Phoenicia, Bahsa of Ammon, Gindibriah of Arabia, Adoni Baal of the Sizanians, and the kings of Egypt, of Goim or Syrian Achaia, of the Irkanatians, probably Jerachmeclites moving northward, and of the Usanatians. These forces Shalmanezer vanquished, and prepared the way for further conquests in the south. The Black



THE HITTITES IN CONTACT WITH THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE. 239
Obelisk inscription informs us that the empire of Habini at Marasia fell before the same monarch, so that in his reign, about 900 B.C., the westward wanderings of the Lydians towards the Mediterranean coast must have commenced. To the north of the Samahlians of Melitene, Shalmanezer found the Tabalu, men of Diblath or Japhleti, another Zerethite remnant, often identified with the Tibareni of the Black Sea. These were a branch of the Iberians in the three families Pasach, Bimhal, and Ashvath, and contributed largely to the population of the Caucasus, leaving also, as the Avars, many traces of their presence in Europe. In Media, Shalmanezer found the Zimri or Zimrites, the Amadai or Midianites, and the Parsuai, supposed to be Parthians. It is more
likely that they were the Persians, descendants, like the Celtic
Parisii, of Peresh the Gileadite. Lubarna had re-established himself on the Patinian throne, but the sons of Bedan rose against him
and put him to death, elevating Surri, probably a Patinian prince. Him Shalmanezer impaled with his followers, and placed Sasitur of Uzza over the Patinians in Cinalua.^*^ Shalmanezer's son Assur-Dayan rebelled against his father, and another son, Samas Rimmon, who succeeded to the throne, has preserved a list of the Assyrian cities that took part in the rebellion. Of these, Assur, Zab, Araphka, Dur-baladh represent the Zerethites, and Arbela, Tel-Abni, and Khuzirina, the men of Zochar. Samas Rimmon quelled the rebellion, and then proceeded against the unhappy Nairi, whose kings he subdued to the number of twenty-eight. Their cities or peoples are entirely difierent from those named by Tiglath Pileser, nor can they be
satisfactorily connected with the Hittite lists of Chronicles. Here and there a familiar name appears, such as Suma, king of the Cinucai, who is a Shema of the Chanochites ; but while the Arimai, Khundurai, Huilai, Singuriai, give Harum, Gedor, Joel,
and Zochar, their rulers Bisirain, Zarisu, Aspastatauk, and Sirasu, do not stand in any necessary genealogical relation to them. Dirnacus again is an Irnachash, but how does -he come to be the king of the Marruai ? Tatai seems to be a Hadad, but can the Ginginai be descendants of Anigam ? In addition to the lords mentioned, the list includes Sirasvi of the Babarurai, Amakhar of
20 Records of the Past, iii. 83 ; v. 29.



240 THE HITTITES.
Kharmis-andi, Zarisu of the Parsaniyai, Sanisu of the Cipabarutacai, Ardara of Ustassi, Parusta of the Ciraarusai, Amamas of Cingistilin Zakhari, Khassikhu of the Matsirausai, Mamanis of the Luksai, Zabel of the Dimamai, Gista of the Abdanai, Adadanu of the Asatai, Ursi of the Ginkhukhtai, Bara of the Ginzinai,
Arna of the Cindutansai, Zaban of Zuza- rural, Irtizati of the Ginkhidai, Bazzuta of the Taurlai, Sua of the Nanikirai, and the nameless kings of the Satiriai and the Arta-sirari. Such is the thankless list of the kings of the Nairi, which would require a monograph of no small bulk for its elucidation. If Samas Rimmon
could not reconcile his list with that of Tiglath Pileser, how shall
the nineteenth Christian century effect tlieir reconcilation ? Samas Rimmon was by no means such a conqueror as his father. His borders extended from the Shuhites about Babylonia northward to near Carchemish, and eastward into Media ; but he seems to have swelled his victories in Mesopotamia and southern Armenia over the Nairi to the utmost extent, in order to atone
for the absence of more distant tributaries. Dadi of Khupuskda paid him tribute, but there is no mention of the kings of Syria
and Asia Minor among his subject princes.^^ Of Vul-or Rimmon-Nirari who followed Samas-Rimmon we have but general statements without detail. He claimed dominion over all Syria and Palestine, and actually marched to Damascus, where he received the submission of Marih, a successor of Hazael. He did not make any concjuests in Asia Minor, his time being largely taken up in suppressing revolts in Armenia. Chief among the Hittite peoples mentioned by him are the Albanians on their way to the Caucasus, the men of Kharkhar, or Iberians of Georgia, not yet among their mountains, and those of Allapur or AUabria, named after the Kenite Leophrah, in Media, or it may be also in Armenia, for they are mentioned along with the people
of Van.2"^ The Hittite inscriptions of Sagara of Carchemish shed light upon the obscure period that follows. The Assyrian power was declining rapidly. The assertion of Rimmon-Nirari that he ruled over Syria and Palestine is not borne out by history. There is no record of any Marih king of Damascus. From 857 B.C.,
21 Records of the Past, i. 11. 22 Lenormant's Manual, i. 382.



THE HITTITES IN CONTACT WITH THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE. 241
when he began to reign, until 839 when Hazael of Syria died, the
Hittite empire of the south was strong, and kept Israel in cruel bondage. Had there been an Assyrian monarch strong enough to cope with Hazael, his aid would certainly have been invoked by Jehoahaz. When Hazael died, the valiant Joash and his
mightier son.the second Jeroboam, restored Israel's fallen fortunes.
They drove the Syrians, or Syro-Hittites, out of the land on both sides of Jordan, and Jeroboam took possession of the kingdoms of Damascus and Hamath, recovering the greater part of the ancient empire of Solomon and David. Then it was that Jonah the prophet of Gath Hepher, who had foretold these conquests, protected by the now famous name of Israel, went to Nineveh and prophesied its destruction. ^^ A degenerate Shalmanezer was on
the Assyrian throne, and, for a time, he and his people were moved by the prophet's warning and repented of their evil ways. The story of Jonah's flight by sea from Joppa to Tarsus, of his being cast overboard and saved by a great fish, was notorious among the Greeks who still inhabited the sea coast of Palestine
from Accho to the south of Philistia, and, being carried by them to their subsequent settlements in Lesbos and Corinth, was there transformed into the legend of the poet Arion, who, sailing from Tarentum to Corinth, or from Corinth to Methymna in Lesbos, was compelled by covetous seamen to leap into the sea, when a dolphin received him and carried him in safety to Taenarum in
Laconia. Regarded as a Philistine story, it is significant that the eastern promontory corresponding to Taenarum is that of Onugnathus, or i)he jaw bone of the ass, a reminiscence of the
exploits of Samson.^"*
Returning to the history of Assyria, the chief information is
that afforded in the fragmentary inscriptions of Sagara of Carchemish, which show that, towards the end of Jeroboam's reign, Shalmanezer made an attempt to regain his lost power over the Hittite tribes, and sent his son Salaka or Assarac into Commagene to install a Hittite prince favourable to Assyrian supremacy, and
to incite the Hittite tributaries of Carchemish to rebel against
23 Jonah ; 2 Kings xiv. 25. 2* Herodot. i. 23, 24 ; Judges xv. 15 ; The many places on the y:editerranean coast of Palestine, called Khan lounas, have no relation to the prophet Jonah, but a re ancient abodes of the Onites or lonians, whom Stephanus places in Gaza. '16)



242 THE HITTITES.
Sagara. This caused an outbreak of violence on the part of
Hittite populations that had received Assyrian governors, and Sagara, placing himself at the head of the confederacy once more organized, entered Commagene and drove away Assarac and his forces. Then he made alliance with Phalok, the revolting king of Babylonia, and with Assur, who was probably a younger brother of Assarac, eager to deprive his elder of the Assyrian crown. Shalmanezer died during the contest, and Assarac his heir was besieged by the confederates in Nineveh. Despairing of escape,
he set fire to the city and perished in the conflagration that destroyed the mistress of the world. Phalok, the Bible Phul, , united the Assyrian and Babylonian empires under his sceptre, but appointed Assur as his viceroy over the conquered country. Then, from the shores of the Caspian to the Mediterranean coast and the centre of Cappadocia, and from Thapsacus to the Caucasus, Sagara ruled as king of kings over the united and victorious
Hittites. Elated with their success, they forgot their Israelite enemy in the south, whose yoke Thapsacus had broken in the general upheaval. Zechariah the son of Jeroboam had been cut
ofi" by his officer Shallum after a reign of half a year, and the assassin had been but a month on the throne when Menahem, who was governor over the Hittite conquests of Israel at Tirzah, came with speed to Samaria, and rewarded him as he had served his master. Menahem then placed the crown on his own head, but was at once summoned away by the Hittite revolt. Busy in other quarters, the confederate kings were unable to help Thapsacus, the head of the Nairi kingdoms. The king of Isra^el took the city and ravaged the adjoining country, but, on the advance of the Babylonian Phalok and his Hittite confederates, he was compelled
to retire, losing all his northern possessions and saving his kingdom of Samaria only by the payment of a thousand talents of silver, wherewith the destroyer of Nineveh doubtless rewarded
his allies who made but little account of gold.^^ At this time another Hittite state comes into prominence, that namely of Elam or Susiana, over which reigned Sutruk-Nakhunta, one of whose successors Kudur-Nakhunte restored the name by which Chedorlaomer was knpwn, showing that from the time of that ancient
25 2 KingB XV. 16, 19.



THE HITTITES IN CONTACT WITH THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE. 243
monarch the kingdom of Elam had remained in the possession of his family. If we identify the Lakhmians or Mondars of Irak witli the Susian posterity of Lechem and Manahath, the descendants of Chedorlaomer held sway over the country about the Shatel-Arab down to the seventh Christian century.^® The period of Hittite independence lasted little more than forty years. After the death of Phalok in 747 B.C., the Assyrians reasserted themselves, and in 744 Tiglath Pileser II. became king. He was probably a son of that Assur whom Phalok had made vice-king of Assyria. He re-established supremacy over the Nairi in Mesopotamia, placing his border for the time at the Euphrates. Then he invaded Babylonia and Chaldea, which were full of Hittite and Midianite tribes, the very name Kaldi being that of Gilead the Zimrite. The only kings mentioned by him are Nabu-Usabsi and Chinzirus. The name Nabu-Usabsi suggests a Kenezzite origin from Di Nhaba, which is confirmed by Chinzirus, an oriental Cinyras and Acencheres or Uzzen-Sherah. Yet Nabu-Usabsi reigned in Sarrabanu of Bit Silani, which seems to have commemorated Saraph the son of Shelah the Shuhite. In the wide region traversed by him, Tiglath Pileser found the Pukudu or southern Picts, afterwards to be Indian Pactyans, in their cities Lahiru, Idibirina, Hilimmu, and Pillutu, which kept alive the memory of Jehaleleel, Heber, Helem, and Japhlet, the Zerethites. There al.so he met with the chief tribes of the Shuhites, Lehitau, and Marusu, or Laadah and Mareshah ; of the Temenites, Damunu and Amlatu, or Temeni and Amalek ; with the Birtu, Parthians, or Beerothites, the Gurumu or Garmites, and a mixed multitude of Hagarenes, Nabataeans, and Ekronite Ubulu, named after Abihail. All these he brought under his sway. In the north he reduced all Syria and the Hittite kingdoms as far as the Caucasus, numbering among his subjects Pisiris of Carchemish, Eniel (properly Khintiel) of Hamath, Rezin of Damascus, Kustaspi of Commagene Sulumal of Melitene, Panammu of Samhalai, Tarhulara of Gamgumai or Zuzim, Uassurmi of Tubalai, Dadilu of Kaskai, Urimmi of Husannai, and Urpalla of Tuhanai, who were Hittites, together with some Phoenician and Japhetic princes. In effecting the
reduction of Syria he had to encounter the opposition of the kings

of Hamath and Damascus, and of Pekah the king of Israel. Two of the Hamathite inscriptions have briefly told the story of their revolt. Ostensibly it arose out of the murder of the king of
Chalcis by a renegade Hittite chief, whom Rezin defeated, after he had invoked the aid of Assyria to support him in his act of
usurpation in Chalcis. Elated with this success, the king of Hamath engraved an account of the mustering of the Hittite forces to avenge the death of Caleb of Chalcis. The chief conspirators were the suzei'ain, Pisiris of Carchemish, Yanzu of Thapsacus, Khintiel of Hamath, and Rezin of Damascus, with Pekah of Israel and the king of the Patinians. Tiglath Pileser overthrew the confederates and put Rezin to death, thus bringing the kingdom of Damascus to an end." Shalmanezer, who followed Tiglath Pileser, appears to have retained the conquests of his predecessor, for the only event of his reign that is known is his siege of Samaria, in the midst of which he died, leaving the throne to his officer Sargon.^ One of the first acts of Sargon was the capture of Samaria in the ninth year of King Hoshea, and the transportation of 27,280 Israelites of rank into Mesopotamia. Then he treated Hamath, under its king Ilubid, in the same fashion. The next victim was Pisiris king of Carchemish, whom he expelled from
his city, the inhabitants of which he transported to Assyria. Of the original conspirators, Yanzu of Thapsacus was the only one allowed to retain his kingdom under tribute. Thus in the year 716 the Hittite confederacy came to an end ; but the Hittites were still strong in Armenia and Asia Minor. Comraagene followed the fate of the neighbouring kingdoms ; Mutallu its last monarch, " fled alone and his trace was no more seen." Ursaha of Armenia, however, brought under his standard Bagadatti of
Militene, and the great ones of Karalla, Zikirtu, and Van. Assurlih was king of Karalla, a name so like Asareel as to leave one in doubt whether Karalla denotes the Heraclid race or a branch of the Zerethites. Zikirtu and Van, or Zochar and Jephunneh, had Aza for king, a friend of the Assyrians. Him the conspirators slew, but when Sargon replaced him by his brother

Ullusun, that patriotic Hittite joined the Armenian league against Assyrian tyranny. Itti of AUapur, towards or in northern Media, also made common cause with the revolters ; and some of the Nairi united with them. They were defeated in detail, and the league broken. Ullusun made his peace with Sargon ; the men of AUapur and Karalla were scattered ; and TJrsaha was driven into the mountains a fugitive. He is the romantic char
acter, the hero of this period of Hittite history. For two years he maintained the unequal contest, and then, hearing that his last ally, Urzana of Musasir, had been overcome and his god Haldia captured by Sargon, " he despaired on account of the victories of Assur, and he with his own hand, with the dagger
of his belt he pierced his entrails as to a wild beast." Another Hittite enemy of Sargon was Mita the Moschian. He appears to have dwelt in Cappadocia, for some of his raids were upon the territory of the Kui or Goim of south-eastern Cilicia. Sargon never conquered the Moschi, but Mita at length, satisfied of the
might of Assyria, paid him tribute ; and this tribute continued, as the inscription on the Stone Bowl of Babylon shows, down to the time of Sargon's grandson Esarhaddon. The Albanians or men of Ellip were submissive to his yoke till their king Dalta died. Then his two sons, Nibie and Ispabara, contended for the crown ; the former being supported by Sutruk-Nakhunte of Elam, and the latter by Sargon. Ispabara triumphed, and Nibie was taken in his town of Mareobisti. Of Hittite monarchies in the north there remained, besides those of the Moschi and Albanians, of AUapur and Van, Tabal, Khamman and Gamgum. Ambaris was king of Tabal and of Beth Buritis in Colchis. He had joined the insurgents under Ursaha, but he was punished for this some time after the fall of that warlike rebel and the submission of his confederates. Sargon depopulated his country and removed his people to Assyria. Tarhunazi ruled over Khamman and Melitene, a good evidence that the Ras or Lydians had withdrawn from that region. This land of Khamman appears to have been named from Comana of Pontus rather than from that of Cappadocia, as, when Sargon besieged him, the town in which he took refuge was Tell-Garimmi, whose name is an echo of the Garmi that came of the family of Jephunneh, from whom Pontus



246 THE HITTITES.
got its name. Tarhunazi was taken in chains to Assyria, with all his family and 5,000 of his people. The position of Gamgum
is hard to determine, though Professor Sayce places it in northeastern Cilicia, therefore in the country vacated by the Eas. Mutallu, its king, had dethroned his father Tnrhulara, who appealed to Sargon. The Assyrian, nothing loath, marched to Varkasi, which may be Merash or Marasia, and dethroned Mutallu. carrying away his spoil and removing his family to Assyria. Along with the Gamgumian princes, he took the family of the land of Bet-Pahalla, or the Japhetic line of Abihail, still
true to the fortunes of the Zuzimites, as in ancient days. Thus Sargon rulied almost to the centre of Asia Minor, so that what independent Hittite states existed in that country must have been west of the Halys. Chief among these kingdoms must have been that of the Ras in Lydia, which afterwards dominated the great peninsula. • The men of Sumir and Akkad were still in the south under Merodach Baladan of Babylonia, and Humbanigas of Elam. These kings stirred up the tribes everywhere against Sargon,
but too late. Had they made their atteuipt before the northern Hittites were subdued and scattered abroad, they might have hoped for success ; now their solitary ally in the north was Mita the Moschian, who had not yet made his submission. The Gambulian lake dwellers came forth to war, and were first conquered. The Pukud were affrighted and surrendered, as did the Eshtemoites descended from Zochar, the Ibuliya and Patiyail or Abihailites and Abdielites descended from Buz, the men of Rat, Ur, Kullab, and Larsa, who worshipped the god Laguda, Laadah or Lagadah, the father of Mareshah, and representatives
of almost all the Hittite tribes. In the south, as in the north, their dream of independence came to an end while within reach of the long arm of Assyria's warrior king. Sargon 's final conquest was that of Uperi, the king of Dilmun on the Persian Gulf, a Zerethite probably of the family of Talmai of Geshur, The news of this last victory brought Mita's tribute to Sargon into Elam ; and the kings of Yahnagi in the island of Yatnan or Cyprus, fearing lest the Assyrian monarch should cross the sea to them as he had done to reach Dilmun, brought him presents



THE HITTJTES IN CONTACT WITH THE ASSYEIAN EMPIRE. 247
to Babylon, and kissed his feet. The various names of Cyprus are Hittite, but denoting different families. The Greek name Cyprus is that of Chepher, whose posterity, the people of Aradus and Marathus, were probably the first to colonize it. The Assyrian Yatnan is the name of Ethnan, the ancestor of the piratical
Cilicians; and Yahnagi pertains to the line of Paseach, being derived from his grandson Hanoch.^^ A large Japhetic element followed, among whom, if tradition can be trusted, the Goim, Kue, or Achseans, occupied a prominent position. Judging from the names of its kings given by Esarhaddon, it must have been hellenized in speech in his time, and the process probably began
before that of Sargon.^*' Sennacherib had no trouble with any of the northern Hittites but the Albanians. Ispabarra was compelled to flee, and most of his kingdom was annexed to Assyria. Some rebellious Kuans and Cilicians were subdued and brought to Chaldea to work in
brickfields, like the Israelites in Egypt. The Medes, whom Sennacherib regarded as a very distant people, paid tribute and accepted his yoke. These Medes, whose kings are classed by the prophet Jeremiah with those of Zimri and of Elam, were the Midianites, the only historical people of that name. Among the Nipur mountains, which probably represent the Zagros range in eastern Assyria, the conqueror found the Tocharri, once rulers of
Assyria, now a race of wild men, who had fixed their dwellings like the nests of eagles on the high summits and crags. Yet he took their cities, Sharum, Ezama, Kipsu, Kalbuda, Kua and Kana, names that tell unmistakably who the Tocharri were. Near at hand beyond the mountains were the Kassi or Cossaei, descendants of Coz and his son Anub separated from Ammon. With them were the Yatsubi-Galla, dwelling in Kilamzahk. These may have been the men of Jashubi-Lehem, descendants of Shuah the Ashterathite, who had dwelt in the vicinity of Moab. Both of these peoples Sennacherib transported to other seats. Afterwards in Media, where they dwelt even in the time of the classical geographers, he encountered the rebellious Dahae or Zohethites
^ Yet the name of Telamon connected with Cyprus suggests Anak rather than Hanoch. 30 Records of the Past, vii. 25.



248 THE HITTITES.
under their king Maniah, whose city was Ukku. The capital and thirty-three dependent cities fell before the Assyrian monarch, and again the work of transportation went on, until the Hittite tribes were everywhere broken into fragments. Another rebellion broke out in Babylonia and Elam headed by the Chaldean Suzub and Umman-Minan the Elamite, The Hittites of the south rushed to war, Damunu, Khindaru, Pukudu, Gambuli, Lahiru, Malaku, Lakabri, Illipi, Yashan, Pasiru, Ubudu, BethKutlan, Beth-Adini, Beth-Amukkan, Dummuku, Kipri, Gurumn, Lihutahu, and others too numerous to mention, together with the
allied Gileadites, Abihailites and Ishmaelites, or Kalatu, and Parzush, Ubuli and Nabatu and Hagaranu. The Hittite tribes bear the names of Temeni, Gedor, Pasach, Samlah, Jehaleleel, Amalek, Legophrah, Eliphaz, Husham, Abiezer, Obadiah, Jekuthiel, Ethnan, Megon, Shemag, Cheber, Garmi, Laadah. Sennacherib overcame the tumultuous host, and for a time the south had
rest. Of his conquests in Palestine this is not the place to speak,
but, as affecting the Hittites in Asia Minor and Hellas, it is worthy of note that his wars with the Philistines and other Japhetic tribes of the sea coast must have caused large immigra
tions into these regions.'^ The Hittites were not yet subdued. When Esarhaddon heard how his brothers had put his father to death, he was leading a campaign in Pontus. It was January, and a great snow-storm darkened the sky, but he pushed on towards Nineveh. As he passed through the country of the Khani -Rabbi in north-eastern Cappadocia or Armenia Minor, the warriors of these sons of the Rephaim assembled and opposed his course with their arrows. The avenger broke through them, however, and made good his march to Nineveh. In Cilicia or south of that country m Syria, one Sanduarri or Ben-Zoheth, king of Kundi and Sitzu, allied himself with the king of Sidon against the new monarch of Assyria ; but to use his own language " like a bird from out of the mountains I took him and I cut off his head." In Colchis also rebellion broke out. Trusting to their mountains, the men of Khilakki and Duhuka or of the twin Kenezzite lines of Charash and Zocheth, refused to submit to the yoke of Assyria. Esar

THE HITTITES IN CONTACT WITH THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE. 249
haddon took twenty-one of their cities, carried off their spoil, and placed the yoke of his empire heavily upon them. Somewhere in the same region he met Tiuspa, the roving warrior of the Cimmerians or Zimri, "whose own country was remote, in the province of Khubusna," and destroyed him and all his army with the sword. It is not known where Khubusna was, but the probability is that it was in Northern Media ; and this seems to have been the beginning of those Cimmerian expeditions which afterwards ravaged Asia Minor and gave to Galatia its Celtic or Gileadite population. The Assyrian monarch does not state when he was at the extreme north-westena border of Cappadocia. He went there, however, and crushed the people of Barnaki, called in classical geography Parnassus, who dwelt in Telassar, probably the Sar-alium of the Greeks. In the south also he sought out the
Hittites, and spoiled the city of Beth-Dakkuri, " which is in Chaldea but in enmity with Babylon." He burned the king of this Semitized Zochar named Shems-Ibni, because he refused to worship Merodach and spoiled the Babylonians. But he made use of the Gambulians as a barrier against Elam, for " Belbasha son of Bunani, king of the Gambulians, who at the distance of twelve kasbu among the waters and the marshes like fishes had placed their dwellings " brought him tribute and kissed his feet. Finally the ten kings of Cyprus, of mingled Hittite, Greek and Phoenician blood, submitted to the yoke of Assyria. These were Ekistuz of Edihal, Pisuagura of Kittie, Kius of Sillumi, Itu-Dagon of Pappa, Erili of Sillu, Damasus of Kuri, Rumitzu of Tamisus, Damusi of Amti-Khadasta, Unassagura of Lidini, and Butzu of Upri. Of these, Ekistuz of Edihal was probably a descendant of the Jerachmeelite Jediael, but the others might all, so far as
names go, have been of Hittite descent.^^ In 667 B.C., Assurbanipal succeeded his father. His chief campaigns were in Egypt, Arabia, and Chaldea. Mugallu king of Tubal, and Sandasarvi of Cilicia, submitted to him, and he received a daughter of each in marriage. The kings of Minni and Ararat in Armenia also made their peace in a similar way. Yet there appears to have been fighting in Cilicia and Armenia prior to these reconcilations. Otherwise the northern Hittite

regions were quiescent, the bold spirits being dead or on their way to distant lands were they could breathe freely. The Ras had reached the western sea ; Sardis was built, and the Lydian kingdom organized. But they were not fated to be there long alone. Tiuspa was dead, but the Cimmerians lived, and, where Sumir was, Akkad was not far off. The rovers had made their way straight through Asia Minor, plundering on the way, and then, when they thought they had reached the outpost of civilization, the treasures of the new empire of the west greeted their eyes. Gyges was on the throne, a second Gog, perhaps of the same Paseachite line as the first, for the Paseachites had dwelt in Baal Meon where the Lydians were first called Maeonians. Gyges knew very well who the Assyrians were, although Assurbanipal says that his forefathers had not heard the name of Lydia. The Lydian king sent ambassadors asking for help against the invaders of his kingdom, pretending that the god Asshur had revealed to him in a dream that he should seek the friendship of the king of Assyria. Accordingly Assurbanipal sent him aid, and an Assyrian army fought with the Lydians against the Zimrite spoilers, driving them northward towards the Black Sea. Gyges probably feared that he had made a mistake in letting the Assyrians know of his existence, for, when the Cimmerians and his auxiliaries had departed, he sent troops to help Psammetichus of Egypt to drive the Assyrians out of that country. Assur
banipal complains bitterly of this act of ingratitude, and states that he gave the Cimmerians permission to renew their ravages, of which permission they took such advantage that the Lydian king was shut up in the citadel of Sardis. Gyges was killed, and his son hastened to make his submission to the Assyrian king. who ordered the Cimmerians to retire from Lydia. The Hittites of the south rose in favour of Saulmugina, Assurbanipal's brother, who had stirred up the Semitic peoples of Syria, the Goim, and the Egyptians against him, and who was confederate with Elam. The conqueror of Egypt conquered the rebels, and threw his brother into a fiery furnace. In Elam he found the southern Ras at Rasi and Kabrina, and the posterity of Heman, son of Mahalah and grandson of Samlah, at HamanU. There also were the Beerothites at Dur-Amnani and Dur-Amnanima, at Samunu,



THE HITTITES IN CONTACT WITH THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE. 251
and Shushan. All of these he overthrew. The marsh-loving Gambulians he took from their watery retreat and carried them to Assyria, where they would find no lakes to disport in. Then he carried away the Elaraite gods, Susinak, Sumudu, Lagomer, Partikira, Aramankasibar, Uduran, Sapak, Ragiba, Sumugursara, Karsa, Kirsamas, Sudunu, Aipaksina, Bilala, Panintiniri, Silagara, Napsa, Nabirtu, and Kindakarbu. It is not easy to identify all these deified ancestors, which almost all pagan gods were, but Sumudu is probably Hamath rather than Shemidag ; Lagomer is Laomer ; Ragiba, Rechab ; Sumugur-sara, Shamgar the Zari; Sudunu, Eshton ; Karsa, Korach, grandson of MaReshah ; Kirsamas, Regem as Karegeinish ; Uduran, Hadar of Pau ; Ammankasibar, Manachath the Horite. The reign of the southern Hittites was thus apparently at an end, although, as has been stated ali'eady, there are indications that the posterity of Chedorlaomer
dwelt as a princely family, with occasional royal authority, down
into the Christian centuries. Strabo quotes Aristobulus to the effect that Assurbanipal, or, as he calls him, Sardanapalus, was
buried at Anchiale in Cilicia, and that a stone figure of the
conqueror, in the attitude of one snapping his fingers, was erected
on his tomb, with an inscription in Assyrian characters: "Sardanapalus, son of Anacyndaraxes, in one day set up Anchiale and Tarsus Eat, drink and be merry, for everything else is not worth that."'^^ M. Lenormant shews that Anacyndaraxes is anakunadasharru Asshur, or "I, the great king of Assyria," a common statement of the Assyrian monarchs. The tradition is
given for what it is worth.^* Assurbanipal died 647 B.C. and was followed by his son • Assured ill lani in whose time Assyrian monarchy came to an end. His period is one of great obscurity owing to the absence of
historical monuments with which to check the traditions of the
Greek historians.^^ Its history is further complicated by the confounding of the events connected with the first fall of Nineveh before Phalok and Sagara with those of the second fall before Nebuchadnezzar. We know that Nebuchadnezzar in the

252 THE HITTITES.
year 606 B.C., took Nineveh, and established himself as lord over all the Assyrian empire. His name, Nabu-Kudui'-Ussur, and that of his father Nabu-Pal-Ussur, or Nabopolassar, together with the special worship they paid to Nebo and Merodach in the temple of Saggathu, mark him a descendant of the Kenezzite royal family in alliance with the Gedors of Chaldea and Elam. This family, which left Egypt some time after the Exodus of Israel, does not come prominently into view in Babylonian history till about 1300 B.C., when Rimmon-Pal-Idinna sat on the throne of
Babylon. All of his successors bear the characteristic Kenezzite or Ethnanite names, Merodach, Bel, Nebo, Idinna, setting forth the son of Beor, Bela, Di Nhaba, and Atin-re or Othniel, with the exception of Sibir, and Kinziru the son of Amukkan, the last of whom, however, represents Uzzensherah, while Amukkan, his father bears part of the name of Megon-othai. These Kenezzites had been allied with the family of Kapha or Hammurabi the founder of Babylon from time immemorial, and the alliance had been confirmed in Egyptian days by the marriage of Abiezer, the son of Samlah, to Hathath, the heiress of Othniel. When the posterity of Ethnan returned to Babylonia, they established themselves in Ava or Aeiopolis on the Euphrates, so named after the son of Ethnan and eponym of the Avim. There they received Dardag, the son of Mahalah, into the number of their divinities. When Sargon transplanted the Babylonians of Babylonia, Cutha, and Ava, into Samaria, the Avites carried with them the worship of Nibhaz and Tartak or Nebo and Dardag, the Cuthites, that of Nergal or Acharchel, and the Babylonians.that of Succoth-Benoth.^ The Kenezzites, Ethanites, or Avites speedily displaced the Heraclidae, or family of ArmanAgarsal and the Rephaim on the throne of Babylonia, causing the former to retire into the north, and sending the latter southwards to the Gambulian marshes. They then effected alliances with the Kudurs of Elam, introducing their royal title into the nomenclature of the Babylonian family. As we have seen, the population of Babylonia, Chaldea, and Elam was by no means purely Hittite. Its substratum was Semitic and unhistorical. Chaldea derived its name from the Kaldai, called a leading tribe of
3« 2 Kings xvii. 30, 31.



THE HITTITES IN CONTACT WITH THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE. 253
Akkad, but who were really the same as their allies the Sumir or Zimrites, for they were men of Gilead descended from Zimran. At some unknown period, or periods, these primitive Celts crossed the Shat el Arab into Susiana, whence they afterwards sent a colony into southern Media, and reestablished the ancient name of Elam in both of these countries as that of the Elymaei,
or descendants of Ulam the Gileadite. The senior branch of the
Ulamites, known as the sons of Peresh, separated from the Elymaei of Susiana, and, moving eastward, occupied the country known as Persis. Where these Celts, who gave their name to the Persian empire, came under pure Aryan influences is not easy to decide. This, at any rate, is not the place to enter upon
the extensive field of Aryan migrations. There were Japhetic tribes in Babylonia, Chaldea, and Elam, who accompanied the fortunes of the Zuzimite Hittites, being the descendants of Eker and Buz. Some of these as Busae constituted one of the leading Median tribes. The same people, as Ubuli or Ubulu, descendants of Abihail, were in Chaldea and Elam ; and as Sagartians, bearing the name Geker or Sagara, they were counted as a Persian tribe. That there were other Japhetic peoples among the tribes east of the Tigris is proved by the statements of the Assyrian monarchs, who tell how they transported them from the sea coast of Syria and Palestine. Among these must be counted the descendants of Maaz or Magaz, the son of Ram and brother of Eker. From him came the Magi, who were to Media what the Brahmans were to India, a ruling priestly caste. The name Brahman or Brachman
originated doubtless in Egypt, where the Coptic article pi transformed such words as romi, a man, into piromi and similar forms. There the name Jerachmeel, which the Arabs called Arkam, rejecting the final el, became Brachmeel and Brachma. To this Brachman race Geker and Magaz belonged, the former being a warrior and the latter a priestly line that succeeded for a time in dominating some of the Hittite tribes among which they dwelt. The Japhetic families were tenacious of their language ; the Hittites and Midianites were not. Accordingly in Armenia, Persia, and India, the Jerachmeelites of Eker and Maaz imposed their tongue upon the Hittite and Midianite tribes, and even carried Japhetic speech into Bokhara, its north-eastern limit.



254 THE HITTITES.
Almost all the Hittite families had representation in Babylonia, Chaldea, and Elam ; and many Ishmaelite tribes occupied these countries with them. When Nebuchadnezzar succeeded his father Nabopolassar as viceroy of Babylon he thought of the traditions of his race, and recalled the great exploit of his ancestor Phalok, Looking abroad, he saw that there was no Assyrian nation, but a mixed multitude bearing that name and speaking the Assyrian language, yet preserving, in its individual elements, the creeds and conditions of ancient non-Assyrian days. He saw the Hittite nationality, which Sargon thought he had extinguished when he drove Pisiris and his people from Carchemish, when he depopulated Hamath and Damascus and transported the northern tribes to distant parts of the Assyrian empire, still extant in the Caucasus, in parts of
Armenia, and especially in the large tract east of Assyria from the Araxes and the Caspian down to the Persian Gulf. The Hittites were not dead ; they had merely changed their ground from west to east, and there they had amalgamated in a measure with the Midianite hordes, whose ancestors had fought in Moab and on the plain of Jezreel. Could he but unite the Hittites of the north with those who acknowledged his sway in the south, Assyria would be crushed between these two millstones, as it had been in the days of Phalok and Sagara. But where was the Sagara ? It is in attempting to answer this question that the
historian finds himself baffled by the confusion of the two stories of Nineveh's fall. The Babylonian kings have left no historical records, and no Hittite documents have been brought to light which can clear up the mystery. According to Ctesias, the ally of Nebuchadnezzar was Cyaxares the Mede, in whom we recognize a Sagara. Now it was Sagara of Carchemish who aided Phalok in destroying Nineveh a hundred and eighty years before, and the name of the Assyrian king whom Nebuchadnezzar and Cyaxares overthrew is called Assarac, which is the same as the Salaka of Sagara's inscription. Nevertheless, the name Sagara was so common a one among the Japhetic rulers of the Hittites, that there is no improbability in its repetition in a Babylonian alliance
against Assyria. It is most unlikely, however, that this Cyaxares or Sagara was the third of a dynasty of Median kings reigning



THE HITTITES IN CONTACT WITH THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE. 255
in Ecbatana, for Esarhaddon, who overran Media, only found there Sidirparna and Eparna, two chiefs of fortresses, and three chiefs of cities named Uppiz, Zanasan, and Ramatiah, who ruled respectively in Partakka, Pardukka, and Uraka-Zabarna. If any dynasty really existed exercising royal authority, it must have been in Hyrcania to the south-east of the Caspian, where the Regemite name was restored and a Chorasraia revived the memory of the fallen Carchemish on the Euphrates. When Pisiris was driven out of Carchemish, and Matallu of Commagene his neighbour, not long afterwards, wandered away into the mountains and left no trace of his presence, what is more natural than that they should strive to put the broad sea between them and the destroyer of their homes and people, and that they should give to that sea the names of their great father and mother Regem and Gazubah, as the Hyrcanian and the Caspian. In Hyrcania, the mother after whom Sazabe of Carchemish was named had another memorial in the royal town Casape. Here also Carchemish and Commagene kept company still, for Comisene was the southern boundary of Hyrcania. Such was the rallying point of the northern Hittite clans, but not the only one. In Armenia the Zocharites, formerly of Van, dwelt among the mountains, brethren of the Tocharri of the Zagros range, and they were the nuclejis of an Armenian kingdom. And between the divided Hittite states lay Zimri and the Medes, ever ready to go where there was fighting to be done and plunder to be gained. Under the banner of the Hyrcanian Sagara the northern men of the east advanced, a countless host, to make common cause with their brethren of Babylonia ; and between the two millstones Assyria was crushed
and forever.

CHAPTER XIX.
The Aryan Struggle for Supremacy over the Hittites of Western Asia.
Prior to the second fall of Nineveh there had been no Japhetic empire. The only historical line descended from Japheth was that of Jerachmeel, who, with his son Ram and grandson Jamin, gave the names Erechtheus, Romulus, Brachma, Rom and Mannus, which characterize the traditions of the Aryans.* Some of the Jerachmeelites were the Arkam, wandering tribes in Arabia ; others, the Cyrenians of Northern Africa, who early lorded it over the Hittite and Midianite colonists. Their chief domain was the Mediterranean coast of Palestine in Philistia and northward to the border of Phoenicia. But they were scattered about in small communities in various parts of Syria and Palestine and Egypt, and early found their way into Babylonia and Assyria in company with the Hittites. These eastern Aryans were chiefly, as has been indicated, of the poster
ity of Geker, the youngest son of Ram, and of his oldest brother Maaz. But the Onites, or lonians as the Greeks called them, who descended from a half-brother of Ram, and who named the transJordanic Ataroths after their mother Atarah, were among the
earliest colonists of Chaldea.^ The ancestral Onam or Oannes appears in the most ancient page of Chaldean history, as a wise being with the body of a fish who taught letters and science and the art of building cities.' The fish fable finds its explanation in the name of Onam's second son Jadag, who became Odacon or Dagon the fish-god of Ashdod. The Onites, therefore, must have contributed to the Aryan population of the east ; but they are not to be confounded with the Yavanas of the Egyptians and

Hindus who were Hittite Jephunnites.* The reputation of the Jerachmeelites for learning was doubtless well founded. The
Sanscrit scriptures are full of their superiority in this respect,
and, going back as these records do to the earliest historic scenes
in Babylonia, Palestine, and Egypt, tbey present a faithful picture of the relation in which the white race stood to those of
alien blood. To some of the Hittite tribes in particular they were guides, philosophers, and highly esteemed friends ; and in course of time, they were looked up to with superstitious reverence as
beings of a superior order. While some of them, especially the Gekerites, were brave warriors, and furnished the chief defence of the early Egyptian throne, they generally posed as priests and lawgivers, allowing the Kshattriyas or Indian Dioscuri to fight
their battles and receive their blessing. They wrote Vedic
hymns in honour of the ancestral gods of the Hittites in their own sacred language, and permitted Hittite monarchs and sages who had acquired proficiency in that old Pelasgic tongue to
contribute to the poetic collections.^ Nor did they obtrude
their own ancestors on the notice of their Hamitic patrons to any
extent. But, in after centuries, the Brahman forgot the origin of the Vedic deities and regarded them as the special property of his
race.
On and Pharbaethus, the latter originating the story of Prometheus, were Jerachmeelite settlements, petty kingdoms in Lower Egypt, of which there were probably several more.^ During the troublous times after the reign of Jabez, a short-lived Gekerite dynasty reigned in Thebes, marked in Greek story by the name of Creon. Men of Jemini, or of the race of Jamin, the second son of Ram, helped the Israelites against their oppressors ;
and it seems that Saul king of Israel was of that Japhetic family.^ The first Jerachmeelites, however, to encroach upon
the prerogative of Hittite royalty, seem to have been the descendants of Geker, Buz, and Abihail, among the Achuzamites of Carchemish and Commagene. Sagara and Pisiris, or Pisi the zariy are Geker and Buz ; and the Commagenian Kundaspi,

258 THE HITTITES.
Kustaspi and Mutallu are not Hittite. Two kings of the related Gamgumi, Zamzummim or Achuzamites, also bore the name Mutallu. The supremacy of Carehemish and Commagene and of Khupuscia or Thapsacus was no doubt largely due to the strength afforded these kingdoms by the presence of the Japhetic element in them ; for the families of Aharhel and Paseach were the ones most closely allied with that of Buz. The same Japhetic element appeared in Armenia, where the Minni, Jamini, or Minyans dwelt side by side with the Zocharites of Van, and
hellenized the Hittite Zochar into Tigranes. So far no attempt had been made by the Aryans to set up an empire or to supersede the names of Hittite ancestors in geographical and tribal nomen
clature with their own. It was neither lack of strength nor of intellect that made them thus unobtrusive. They seem to have
regarded it as their mission to civilize the Hittites ; but there is
little evidence of this in what remains of Hittite art or in the
traditions of the Hittite people. Yet one is loth to think that the ancestors of the most active and enlightened peoples of the world were in the east a pack of idle impostors, trading for their support upon the credulity of the people as they are represented in Sanscrit story. If they were such, the Assyrian kings may be thanked for shaking them out of their lazy fervour and com
pelling them to take part in the activities of life. The exile of Pisiris to Hyrcania was the circumstance that led to the development of Aryan ambition. During the century that elapsed between the fall of Hittite authority at Carehemish and the reign of Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon, the expatriated king and his successors had ample time to mature plans for the recovery of lost empire and for revenge on their Assyrian foes. They found themselves surrounded by tribes hostile to Nineveh, but all of
them, whether Hittite or Median, destitute of organization. The old league had not succeeded in effecting any continuous union of the Hittite states, which were mutually jealous and resented
the assumption of superiority on the part of any one tribe or family. It was useless, therefore, to reestablish the Zuzimite precedence. The Hittite name was no longer one to conjure by ; but there were younger nations, linked by ancient friendship to one at least of the Hittite families, the Medes namely and the

Persians, both descended from the Midianites, whose legions had aided Zereth on the field of Moab, and whose names of Sumir and Kaldi, Ulam and Buryas, recalled the memory of ancient empire. Proud of the Japhetic descent of their mother Keturah, they had sought in vain recognition from their Jerachmeelite kinsmen. Let this recognition be granted, none would be more faithful than
they to their Aryan rulers ; and, with such a nucleus of nationality, it would not be hard to bring the Hittites into a modern kingdom of Sumir and Akkad. Such was the dream of the successors of Pisiris, a dream that was soon to be realized in fact. The Kenite lists furnish no genealogies of the Midianites
later than the third generation, with the exception of that of Zimran which ends with Bedan the great-grandson of Gilead.
The other families were, therefore, unhistorical, in this sense, that no ancient dynasty of kings proceeded from them. Nevertheless, besides the five sons of Midian who gave name to the whole race, who are called Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah, we find mention in the Bible of Midianite princes in the books of Numbers and Judges.^ In Numbers the five princes contemporary with Joshua are Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. In Judges the four leaders put to death by Gideon and his allies were Oreb, Zeeb, Zebah, and Zalmunna. Their names are valuable as aiding the effort to trace the wanderings and connections of the Midianites, but they present no means for determining the history of their owners in other records. In Irish history, which knows the Midianites as the Nemedians who named Midhe or Meath with its capital Tara, the Nemedian genealogies are full of foreign names.^ Celtic Scotland and
Wales furnish in their traditions no early line of Celtic monarchs. The ruling "families whose names they have handed down were, with rare exceptions, Hittite. So the Median history of Ctesias, which begins with Arbaces, from six to eight generations before Cyaxares, according to the different quotations made from his
lost work, is a list of names Hittite and Gekerite, among which Medidus alone makes a doubtful assertion of Median independence. Arbaces, the head of the dynasty, is a Zerethite Arbag
^ Numbers xxxi. 8 : Judges vii. 25 ; viii. 5. * Keating.



260 THE HITTITES.
and Artynes is an Ardon of the same line ; Phraortes is Beerothite or Parthian ; Deioces and Astyages are Zochethite ; and Cyaxares marks the rise of Aryan influence as a Sagara or Geker. The ancient language of Media was neither Celtic nor Pelasgic, but Ugrian or Hittite. Its leading tribe in point of numbers, which gave name to the whole country, was that of the Matiani. But its ancient capital was Rhagae, and its northern boundary the river Araxes, names that belong to the Ras, descended from Ma Reshah, who united with the Midianites in Media, as the
Milesians and Nemedians are said to have united in Ireland.^*^ Herodotus mentions the tribes that constituted the Median nation. These were the Busae, Paretaceni, Struchates, Arizanti, Budii, and Magi.^^ Of these the Busae were the Buzites descended from Geker, of whom came Sagara and Pisiris.or Pisi the zari; they were Japhetic, therefore, and so probably were the Magi, although this is not determined. The Paretaceni and Budii were Beerothites, or early Parthians. The Struchates were in all likelihood
Tirgathi or Arachotians, still in the west. The Arizanti, however, are harder to classify, so many competitors are there for the name of Regem or Rekem. Rekem is the name of a Midianite prince overcome by Joshua, and of a grandson of Ma Reshah ; while Rakem denotes a son of Peresh the Gileadite, and Regem is the eponym of Hyrcania. The presence of Cyaxares among the Median kings, and of several Sagaras among those of Carchemish, suggest the Hyrcanians or transported men of Carchemish as the Arizanti, but other things favour the descendants of Ma Reshah. The Median religion was a corrupt form of Zoroastrianism.
It has been seen that this creed originated in Egypt with the union of the two rival lines of the Ammono-Hittite Mezahab, and the Horite Tahath or Thothmes. The Mithriac cult was adopted by the Moschi or Cappodocians representing the family of Jabez, Mesha, and Mezahab, by the Beerothites or Parthians to whom Hadar the son-in-law of Thothmes introduced it, by such of the Kenezzites as did not follow the disc*worshipping heretic Bechenaten of Tell-el Amarna, and by the Gekerite Brahmans

whose early writings celebrate Mitra with Varuna. The creed to which this worship pertained was a mediating one so far as the Horite and Ammono-Hittite religions were concerned, but it was one of antagonism to other Hittite systems. Ormuzd, or AhuraMazda, its chief divinity, was the enemy of the demon Ahriman, or Angra-Mainyus, and the evil spirits classitied with him appear
to represent the chief advocates of the worship of Baal Peor or Merodach in Palestine and Chaldea. In Media, however, this religion underwent a chancre. The Medes or Midianites had been ardent votaries of Baal Peor when they dwelt in Moab, and, as they carried his worship in later days into Gaul and Ireland, it is not likely that they had given it up in Media. If the Japhetic pontiff kings of Hyrcania and Comisene, the Sagaras and Kustaspis, were to gain the aid of the Medes against Assyria, it
could only be done by a religious revolution. They must surrender their more humane creed, or convert the Medes to it, or what was more feasible than either plan, they might introduce a new theology that mediated. This last plan was adopted, and the agents in preparing the new system and in propagating it were the Magi. These seem to have been the priestly, and
therefore not historical descendants of Ram, the Sanscrit Brahma, the children of his first born Maaz or Magaz, whose name invites comparison with the Mauzzim or Maguzzim of Daniel's prophecy .^'^ Among the oriental Has, who were widely scattered over Media, Armenia, and Susiana, they found a deity of note, the Beth-Zur of the Kenite list, who had been worshipped in Egypt as Serapis, and in Babylonia as a masculine form of Zarpanit, who had given his name to Saravene in south-eastern Cappadocia, and who, as Zervan, was honoured by the Medes. He was, as the son of Maon, the Baal Meon whose sanctuary, Beth Baal Meon, was quite near to Mount Peor in Moab. There doubtless the Midianites had adopted his worship. So highly honoured was his race by them, that two of their princes in the time of Joshua bore Rassite names pertaining to it, namely, Rekem and Zur. Here, then, was a lever wherewith to raise Midian and Ras against the Assyrian, a bond wherewith to unite the religions that had been for ages in deadly antagonism. There were no objections to
12 Dan. xi. 38.



262 THE HITTITES.
Zervan. This oriental Tharonhiawakon, or the House of Heaven, had made no enemies. His great grand-father Ma Reshah, an Ares and a Mars, a Marsus and a Marsyas, though a groat warrior, received honours from many hostile tribes of Heth
;
and even the Assyrian Sargon respected the older Laadah or Laguda in his Babylonian and Chaldean sanctuaries. So Zervan, young in comparison with most deities, became the ancestral god as the unlimited overarching sky, from whom emanated or were evolved first of all the twin deities Orrauzd and Ahriman, and, through them, all beings and objects that exist. Thus philosophy began to replace history in religion so far as the Magi and other pretenders to wisdom were concerned, but the vulgar were left to worship what god or gods they pleased, inasmuch as they were equally, whether good or bad, emanations from one substance. It is the presence of this Zervan in the Median creed that makes doubtful the identification of the Arizanti with the Regemites of Hyrcania, and would rather associate them with the Rassite Rekemites, who named Rhagiana and dwelt in Rhagae or Arsacia. The Midianites themselves are left without representa
tion among the tribes, unless the Budii or Vitii be given to them, as descendants of Midian's son Abidah, rather than to the Beerothites, as descendants of Bedad. The name of the second Zoroaster who originated this flexible and comprehensive religion has not been preserved. He was a Magus, and his Japhetic brethren became the apostles of the new faith. When it first began to be propagated we cannot tell, save that it was within the century that intervened between ihe exodus from Carchemish and the fall of Nineveh. The Magi were successful. The warlike men of Ras rejoiced to hear that their tribal divinity was the king of all the gods, and the Medes, who had adopted Zervan, shared their appreciation of the honour. The other Hittite tribes were satisfied with the recognition of their contending deities as emanations from a common divine source, and accepted Zervan as the new mediator. Under Japhetic leaders, represented by Cyaxares in the tradition of Ctesias, the warriors of the Median kingdom, constituted on the basis of the Zervanian creed, marched to Nineveh and united with the Babylonian hordes collected by Nebuchadnezzer to effect its final overthrow.



THE ARYAN STRUGGLE FOR SUPREMACY OVER THE HITTITES. 263
The capital of the Median kingdom, which according to Herodotus was built by Deioces, a predecessor of Oyaxares, was called Affbatana or Ecbatana. In the book of Ezra it is named Achmetha.^^ Herodotus mentions a Syrian Agbatana where Cambyses died as an oracle had testified.^* Stephanus of Byzantium also says that the Syrian Agbatana was called Epiphania, which Mr. Blakesley, quoted by Professor Eawlinson, shows was a name of Hamath. It is with Hamath as a word, not as a place, that Gesenius connects the Achmetha of Ezra.^^ But Pliny says that on mount Carmel there was a town of the same name, which was anciently called Acbatana.^^ Carmel was a great sanctuary of Baal, but Hamath was even more famous in this respect, as the
inscribed altar stones of Pisiris testify. The Mardi or Amardi dwelt in Media, and they were of the family of Hamath, as were the Median Paretaceni or Beerothites. At Hamath in Syria the emperors of Carchemish had been in the habit of worshipping, so that it would be perfectly natural to find them reviving the name of their ancient sanctuary and making it the capital of the new nation. As the language of Media was Hittite, it would also be
most desirable to retain the services of the Kenite scribes, whose efforts, when gained over to the new religion, would be largely
successful in seconding those of the Magi as propagandists. During the seventy- three years that elapsed between the fall of Nineveh and the capture of Babylon, the Aryans made their
infiuencfc felt over the Hittite and Celtic tribes. Yet it is to be remembered that the dynasty of the Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar was Hittite, uniting the Elamite Gedors with the Kenezzites. The question therefore arises, Was not the name of the Median capital as well as the exaltation of Zervan a bait by which Cyaxares and his Magi sought to draw to themselves the Hamathite and Rassite tribes that dwelt in Chaldea and Elam ? During this interval the Medes became strong and extended their sway over the whole of the western area which the Hittites had formerly occupied. The native Zerethites or Carduchi of northern Assyria, deprived of their powerful and oppressive

kings, transferred their allegiance to those of Media. The Armenian chiefs gladly recognized their sway ; and the tribes of Pontus and Cappadocia rejoiced in their new-found freedom. But a competitor for empire was the Lydian kingdom of western Asia Minor. In Sardis the king Alyattes, a late Laadah, kept royal state, and his arms extended over the whole country towards the river Halys which formed the western boundary of Pontus and Cappadocia. Some vagabond tribes, Celtic or Hittite, disliking the Median rule, had taken refuge with the king of Lydia, who refused to extradite them at the request of Cyaxares. We do not know the whole particulars of the history, but subsequent events seem to show that the new Aryan rulers were aware of the existence of colonists of their own race on the Lydian sea board, and that the war \vhich followed the refusal of Alyattes, in which Hittite fought against Hittite, was undertaken more for the purpose of establishing Japhetic rule in the west than for getting back a few escaped slaves. The war ended, however, when a sudden eclipse of the sun took place, a pheno
menon terrifying to both parties alike ; and, through the mediation of the Babylonian Labynetus and the Cilician Syennesis, a peace wa,s arranged, by which the Halys was made the boundary of the respective empires, and Astyages the son of Cyaxares received Aryenis, Alyattes' daughter, in marriage. When Cyaxares died about 595 B.C., two years after the eclipse, Astyages succeeded him. His name casts a shade of doubt over the story, for it is, like Deioces, a form of the Persian Zahak
as Asi Dahaka, the biting serpent, and in history represents Zoheth of the Kenezzite family. It is a name that should belong to Babylonia, where Nebo and Merodach were chief deities and where the temple of Saggathu reared its towers to the skies. It may be that Cyaxares, by giving his son this non-Aryan name, thought to attach to his fortunes the Kenezzites of the Babylonian empire, the Cilicians of kindred blood, and the wild Dahae of the east, whose ancestors had fought under the banners of Seti Menephtah ; but this is a mere supposition. Astyages was a tyrant, according to all accounts but that of Xenophon, and succeeded in alienating the inhabitants of Persis in the south and those of Armenia in the west. The story of his grandson Cyrus is well

known. This son of his daughter Mandane and the Achaemenian Cambyses he ordered to be ])ut to death when the Magi interpreted his dream of a vine growing out of his daughter that overshadowed all Asia as a prophecy that her son should deprive him of the kingdom. A somewhat similar dream appears in Irish history, the dreamer being Eachtach, the concubine of Art and mother of Cormac Ulfada, who beheld a tree springing from her neck, whose branches overspread the whole kingdom of Ireland.^'' Harpagus the officer of Astyages delivered the infant to a herdsman to be exposed on a mountain, but the herdsman brought up the child and called him Agradates. Agradates became a right royal youth, and so lorded it even over young Median nobles that he was brought before the king to be punished. Astyages recognized his grandson and brought him up in his palace. This latter
part of the story is the same as that told of J*ravarasena the son of Toramana in the Raja Tarangini. Hiranya son of Srechthasena, a name that has been identified with the Persian Rustam, cast his co-regent brother Toramana into prison for aiming at sole dominion. The wife of the prisoner, Anjana, a name not unlike Mandane, bore a son Pravarasena who was brought up by the wife of a potter. This boy was elected king by his playmates, and in this position was recognized by his mother's brother Jayendra. After the death of Vicramaditya, the emperor of all India, and of Matrigupta, his lieutenant in Cashmere, Pravarasena became king and overthrew the kingdom of Saurashtra or Gujerat.^^ Agradates was allowed by Astyages to visit his father Cambyses in Persis. There he united the Persian tribes and, incited by Harpagus and aided by the Armenian Tigranes, he rose in revolt against Astyages, dethroned him, and superseded the Median empire by the Persian, at the same time changing his name to Cyrus. His subsequent achievements were the overthrow of the Lydian Croesus and conquest of all Asia Minor, the annexation to his empire of all the countries between the Zagros mountains and the Punjab, the capture of Babylon and extinction
of royalty in BalDylonia, the liberation of the Jews, and his campaign against the Massagetae, in which he is said to have fallen.

266 THE HITTITES.
The historical traditions of the Persians are Hittite ; their name is Zimrite or Celtic ; their language was and is Indo-European. According to the records preserved by the Greeks, Persian monarchy began with Cyrus ; but the book of Esther represents the captive Jews, whom Cyrus restored to their own land, as suffering oppression and in danger of extinction from Ha man the Amalekite in the reign of Ahasuerus or Achashverosh, the royal husband of Esther the Jewess.^^ The whole story of the rise of the Persian empire is involved in such contradictions, that, with
out further data, it would be unwise to attempt that reconciliation of historical statements and traditions in which so many acute and learned investigators have failed. Turning, however, to the Hittite element in the history, the striking fact appears of a contest between the new Persian creed and that of the Medes. The Persians professed to restore a pure Zoroastrianism in opposition to the eclectic Zervanism of the Median kingdom. This meant the revival of the old antagonism between Ormuzd and Ahriman,
and a definite refusal to conciliate the Kenezzites of Babylonia and the north. Nevertheless this religious animosity was accompanied with proselytisrii,for theZerethites and theZimrite Persians, who were originally worshippers of Baal Peor, became the fast allies of the new king. What the Median Magi had thought to effect by a change of religion, Cyrus accomplished by the union
of widely different historical traditions, which were probably at
first collected into a Persian epic that furnished Firdusi with the elements of his poem the Shah Nameh. In this epic the great theme was the contest between Zohak and Afrasiab or Zoheth and Ophrah, as incarnations of the principle of evil, on the one
hand, and a beneficent race, whose royal and princely genealogies consisted of excerpts from the traditions of the Zerethites, Achuzamites, MaReshethites, and Beerothites. Thus it happened that Feridun the great Zerethite hero, the Duryodhana of the Hindus, the Ardon of the Kenite list, who was the son of Hur and Jerigoth, became the great hero of the Persians. The Persians proper or Pereshites had indeed so regarded him from ancient days, when the family of Peresh, Ulam, and Bedan, through their connection with Ardon, sat upon the Zimrite throne in Babylonia and

Gebalene. But the Achuzamites and, especially, the MaReshethites and Beerothites had been the determined enemies of the allied Zerethites and Zimrites, as the Mahabharata, the Gododin, and other ancient documents, testify. All this, however, was forgotten
;
and Kai Kobad or Jabez, the first of the Cappadocians, was ingeniously made a descendant of Iraj, Feridun's son, while Ma Reshah and Harum became his sons under the names of Arish and Aramin, and the Beerothites were glorified in Zaul and Rustam. Hadad the son of Bedad and other historic names that would have roused suspicion, from the notoriety of their antagonism to the Zerethite and Zimrite tribes, were carefully suppressed ; and, while popular current traditions were incorporated in the poem,
they were so unified, at the expense of historic truth, as to present the story of one Aryan family that had been in former days the masters of the world. The ingenious interpolation of the Aryan Lohorasp and Gushtasp between Kai Khusrau and Esfendiar gave a Japhetic flavour to the whole history, and favoured the pretensions of later Hystaspes to dominion over the Perso-Hittite tribes. And, to flatter the Persians who had no place assigned them in the poetic record, the king took to himself the name, not indeed of Peresh but, of his brother Sheresh, the priestly Chryses of the Greeks, whose daughter Chryseis was taken from Agamemnon, who in return took Briseis from Achilles ; as Cyrus he thus became the royal pontiff" of the Persians.
The Zerethite line to which Cyrus allied himself was that which descended from Asareel through Hur and Jerigoth. From Hur and his Kenite spouse the Aryans and Arachoti, who afterwards dwelt in Aria west of the Indus, received their names. There the Casirotae kept up the name of Jesher or Geshur, afterwards to be transferred to Gujerat in the east and to the Jaxartes in the north. There also two families of Anak the son of Arba, those of Sheshai and Ahiman, dwelt, in Sacastene and on the Etymander. This purely Zerethite stock gave the spurious Aryan name to the whole Japhetic race, and from its most famous offshoot, that of Achiinan, Cyrus deduced his descent. That there was a Japhetic Achaemenes is very probable, as Darius calls the father of Teispes, from whom he and Cyrus equally descended, by that
name.^*^ But Achaemenes or Achiman was originally Hittite. It

is no mere coincidence that an Arbag or Arbaces heads the line of Media, and an Achaemenes that of Persia. Ogamhan appears in the Irish genealogies of the Milesians.^^ He was the Achoron Achaman of the Guanches who were the aborigines of the Canar}'^ Islands, and from him the oldest Guanche tribe was called that of the Achimenceys.^ In Japan he is Hachiman, the god of war
;
in Mexico Hueman the last king of the Toltecs ; and in Peru, the land of the Incas, Huaman.^ In the Iliad, Acamas is a leader of the Dardanians and a son of Antenor, and he fights along- with .^neas the son of Anchises ; or he is a Thracian sou of Eyssorus, or Jesher.2* When further we consider the tribe to which Achaemenes and Cj'^rus belonged, we find it is that of the Pasargadae, whose name resembles most that of the Sarragitu who were in Babylonia in the time of Tiglath Pileser 11.-^ These again are the Arachoti, among whom the Etymandri dwelt. Next in point of rank to the Pasargadae, according to Herodotus, came the Maraphii and the Maspii. The latter are the same as the Mesabatae, and represent the eastern Messapians or descendants of Mezahab, who carried the name of Menthesuphis into the New World as Montezuma. But the Maraphii may have been Meropes or Hammurabians ; or the same as the Assyrian Nirbu, who were descendants of Arba the father of Anak, the eponym of Arrapachitis in Assyria, and the original Arbaces. The fact that th later classical geographers replace the Maraphii by the Rapsi
favours the latter identification. The Sajjartians, whom Herodotus makes shepherds, and the Panthialaeans, whom he calls cultivators of the soil, appear to have been Japhetic tribes, the first bearing the name of Geker or Sagara, and the second, that of Abdiel descended from him. In India the kingdom of Saurashtra, Syrastrene, or Gujerat, was contiguous to Patalene ; and among the Affghans, who inhabit ancient Aria, the tribal name Abdolli occurs along with Safi, Hyber, Ohigi, Sur, and Jasini, which resemble the Buzite Abdiel, Sheba, Heber, Ziag, Jorai and Jachan. Yet their generic name of Pushtan or Puchto favours a descent

from the oriental Pactyans or Bakhdi of Bactria. It was by the influence of these Japhetic tribes that the language and manners of the confederate Hittites and Celts were aryanized. Other Persian tribes were the Derusiae, Germanii, Dahae, Mardi, and Dropici. The Mardi of Mardyene bordering on Susiana were the Hamathites of the line of Mered ; we know too little of the Germanii or Carmanians to assert that they were oriental Garmites or Garamaei of the line of Zochar ; nor can it be positively asserted that the Dropici were a branch of the Rephaim, although the history of Cashmere always associates the Darvas and the Abhisaras, the latter of whom, as Abiezrites, descended from Kapha. The Derusiae bear a Thracian-like name answering to the i^malekite Zerah or Tserach, and may denote the branch of the Temenites to which Haman belonged ; and the Dahae of Taocene must have been friendly Zohethites, whom the Persian hatred of Zohak had
not alienated.
It is evident that many tribes, which the classical atlas places in India or on its borders, were much nearer to Persis and Media m the time of Cyrus. The prophet Isaiah, speaking of the tribes that were summoned to the overthrow of Babylon, derives some of them from the Yom Kesuphoth, or Caspian sea, and mentions among these the Boged and Shoded, cr Bakhdhi and Sughdha of the Zend Avesta, and Bactrians and Sogdians of the Greeks, the former of whom descended from the Zerethite Pasach, and the latter, from Ishhod the son of Samlah of the Rephaim.^^ Only those Hittite tribes which dwelt near the centres of Ayran
influence in Media or Hyrcania and in Persis can have lost their ancient tongue and customs. Even within that restricted area the denationalizing process seems to have been very imperfect, for when the Parthians rose to power in the middle of the third century, B.C., they appeared as a purely Hittite people in
physical character, speech, and habits. Many tribes moved eastward to escape from Persian exactions, and their migrations probably began from the very commencement of Persian empire. The inscriptions of Darius show that there were many leaders disaffected towards his person and government, whose followers after their fall would naturally move eastward in the track of
2« Isaiah xxi. 1, 2.



270 THE HITTITES.
the dark races. ^^ Some of the seeolonies were led by Aryans ;
others by their own Hittite chiefs. Of the former, one of the earliest to take to the east was the senior Hittite tribe which arrogated to itself the Hittite or Khita name, and which in the Punjab the Greeks, in the time of Alexander, called the nation of
the Cathaei. The first division of this tribe pressed upon by later immifjrants crossed the upper waters of the Ganges and established itself in Oude, a reminiscence of Jahdai, and commemorated his son Rearem in Lucknow. But their successors of the same race dropped the ancestral names and did honour to their Aryan leaders by calling their capital Sangala. The dethronement of Sagara or Cyaxares from his seat in Media, and his retirement to his original home in Hyrcania, as Ctesias relates, was
the first act that prompted the withdrawal of the original Hittite suzerains from Persia. Then in the reign of Darius two men, with armies at their disposal, claimed to be descendants of Cyaxares.and fought against the royal troops. One was Phraortes, who professed to be Xathrites of the race of Cyaxares ; the otl^er was Sitratachmes a Sagartian, who also said that he was of the lace of Cyaxares. Media, Parthia, Hyrcania, and Sagartia took part with the pretenders, of whom the last was certainly an Aryan, the name Sitratachmes denoting this as well as the fact that he was of Sagartia.^** There is no record of any migration
after the defeat of the two rebels, but, with a wandering people such as the Hittites were, nothing could be more natural than that they and their Japhetic lords should betake themselves to a free country. In India the Brahman name seems to have come into use to denote the Japhetic stock descended from Jerachmeel and his son Ram, the original Brahma. The Magi and Sagartians, priests and warriors descended from the brothers Magaz and Geker, united under the common name, and continued to exercise a strong influence over their Hittite and Midianite companions. Among the latter were the Prasii, a powerful nation of the same
parentage as the Persians proper and the Parisii of Gaul and
Britain. Brahman rule cannot have lasted long in India. If we
accept the year 543, B.C. as that of the death of Gautama Buddha,

and allow that such a person actually lived in India, there must have been Hittite and Brahman settlements in that country prior to the time of Cyrus, for Gautama beloncred to the Sakya or Shuchite branch of the Kshattriya race, and the Brahmans were in the land in his day. It was not, however, till about 300 B.C., that the Emperor Asoka adopted the Buddhist creed, and in doing so compelled the Brahmans to separate themselves from the Buddhist Hittites. Prior to that time they seem to have been
scattered over the country, in some places as rulers, in others occupying a subordinate civil, but supreme religious position as priests and holy sages. The acceptance of Buddhism by the Hittite princes was a protest against ancestor worship, a disclaimer
of the Brahmanical caste and priestly pretentions, and thus a signal of hostility between the Aryan and the Turanian. But all the Hittites did not become Buddhists. The Ethnanite or
Kenezzite family, m the line of the Charashim at least, and doubtless in that of Zoheth also, was Sivaite, their Siva an incarnation of Baal Peor,and virtually the same unclean god, being Joab, the father of the Charashim. Among the Bharatas or Beerothites also there were Vishnavites, whose Vishnu was Achian, the son of Shemidag, the same as Baal Berith, who had been worshipped at Shechem in Palestine. The Brahmans made
common cause with these idolaters, and thus created a trinity formerly unknown of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, which some writers, ignorant of its origin in political expediency, have compared with that of revelation. The Buddhism which this new
Brahmanical system opposed w^as, in its essential feature of humanity, nothing new, being as far as that is concerned a successful revival of the old systems of Paseach and Job and of Saul of Rehoboth, which the Pythagoreans of Magna Graecia endeavoured to restore in the west. But it does not appear that the old systems included the atheism of Indian Buddhism. Job was a worshipper of the one God, and there is reason to believe that his father Paseach and the later Saul had a similar faith. Yet Pythagoras and Gautama Buddha nmst have derived from a common source in Hittite antiquity their doctrine of metempsychosis. Buddhist atheism had its origin in the knowledge of history. Gautama Buddha, possessing probably the very Kenite



272 THE HITTITES.
genealogies preserved in Chronicles, perceived that the gods of polytheism were deified ancestors, and he naturally asked the question, If these ancestors became gods, why may their descendants not attain the same position, seeing that they are the ancestors yet to be ? Hence the doctrine that any human being may, by heaping up merit through successive stages of existence, attain to the position of a supreme Buddha, which is the nearest thing to a god that the Buddhist system allows. Brahmanism, which, with the assistance of the Vishnavites and Sivaites, ultimately drove Buddhism out of India, did not follow the Hittites in their northern migrations through Tartary and Thibet towards Siberia. In the Malay archipelago, however, through which the Hittites of changed speech passed towards America, the Brahmans pursued them, and imposed their peculiar idolatry on the wanderers. Yet even there, Siva received more worship than any other god of the Brahman pantheon, and he was a native Hittite divinity. Buddhism on the other hand pursued the Hittites into Siberia, almost all the inscriptions of that country referring to Buddhist temples; and thence, into Corea and Japan. No full-fledged Buddhism is found in America
but traces of its influence appear in Mexican history, and it may be that the Mound Builders and the Neutral Nation of Iroquois
history were affected by its teachings. The area of the aryanized Hittites in the east is bounded by the limits of Bengal, named after Abichail the Gekerite or Gangarid, and in the north by Bokhara in Tartary, the Ultima Thule of ancient Japhetic speech
in Asia.^" West of Media and Persia, the Armenians and Kurds, origin ally of pjire Hittite blood, were modified by admixture with Japhetic tribes. The Kurds, Gordyaei, Carduchi, or Cherethites had inhabited the mountains of northern Assyria from remote antiquity. They constituted the chief element in the victorious Assyrian armies, and seem to have possessed Praetorian power. If they proved unfaithful or were overcome, the Assyrian empire fell. To the present day they are as warlike as ever, among the

bravest and most trusted soldiers of the Porte. It was to gain
them over to his interests and the interests of Aryanism, that Cyrus or his predecessors pretended descent from their hero Ardon or Feridun ; and by their help and that of the allied Medes, some of whose descendants as Kaldani and Bottani still dwell among them, he succeeded in conquering the world. Semitic
Assyrian influences had largely modified their speech, thus separating them from their brethren who preserved the Hittite language in its integrity. Under Persian rule their speech underwent new transformation, so much so as to cause them to be ranked by ethnologists in the Asiatic division of the IndoEuropean family. In Armenia many Hittite tribes had dwelt, but before the rise of the Median empire most of these had betaken themselves to the shores of the Caspian and the Black Sea and to the range of Caucasus, hoping thus to escape from the exactions of the world's rulers. Such were the Albanians and Ossetes of Temenite descent, the Iberic Georgians, a mingled Zerethite and MaReshethite people, and the Colchians, who combined elements belonging to the Kenezzite Charashim and the
Paseachites. Of these the Ossetes, descended from Husham the Temenite, exhibit the most decided traces of Aryan culture. The tribes that remained in Armenia were the Zocharite men of Van, and some of the posterity of Harum the father of Acharche] , from whom the country received its name. The Vannic kingdom was in existence in the time of Cyrus under a king Tigranes,. who preserved the old Zocharite name. But along with these Hittite tribes dwelt the Minni . or Jemini, the Minyans of the Greeks, identified alike with Armenia and with the ancient Orchomenos, which marks them as a Jerachmeelite people. These Japhetic Jemini were in three great divisions, the Belaites of whom came the Shaharaim or Sarraatians and many other European families, the Jediaelite ^tolians and Italians, and the Becherites of Bokhara in the east and Bucharest in the west.^'' The Minyan family that settled in Armenia appears to have been that of Jediael, the Andalus son of Japhet of the Arabian historians, the iEtolus son of Endymion of the Greeks. His Minni made common cause with the men of Yan, as their brethren the
*> 1 Chron. vii. 6.

274 THE HITTITES.
Gekerites had done with the Achuzamites of Carchetnish, and as the Mai^azites, with them and the Medes. As a nation the Van
nites or Huns were little influenced by their Japhetic allies. In Armenia and Pontus some of them became civilized and accompanied their friends to other seats in Asia Minor and Europe. As Ophionenses they dwelt among them in ^tolia, and, to the northeast of that Greek country, occupied a great part of Thessaly named after their ancestor Zochar. But the great body of the Zocharites known in different regions as Tochari, Orpelians, Chalybes, Vanni, and Huns, hovered about the region of the two seas, the Black and the Caspian, ready to throw themselves into the east or the west as fancy might dictate or the. hope of plunder might allure. One thing they picked up from the Japhetic Minni,
and that was the name Jediael, which on their lips became Attila, the designation of the Scourge of God. The Abb^ Cuoq has shown that Attila is an Iroquois name, descending in many families from grandfather to grandson, and that it denotes the raccoon as a common noun. Its various forms in the Iroquois
dialect are Atila, Atira, Latilan, Tiron, and Ratiron. He also compares the Iroquois Ratakhes the runner with the Gothic or Vandalic Radagaisus and Rhadagast^^ In Latin Jediael is also an animal name as vitulus, a calf or a seal. A great deal of curious history lies about the name of this man of Jemimi, as the Arab Wathil, the Greek iEtolus, the Latin Italus, and the Teu
tonic Etzel ; but to follow up all such connections of the Hittites
would be to write the history of more than half the world. The Greek legends confound Jediael with Tola the son of Anub, or Talus son of CEnopion, whose connections with the Hittites were even more intimate than those of the Minyan leader. The aryanizing of Asia Minor was brought about by two separate influences, one proceeding from the Persian courf in Susa or Ecbatana, the other from Japhetic colonies on the sea coast and in the interior of the country. The population of the peninsula was not purely Hittite apart from these colonies. As in other places, so in Asia Minor, Sumir kept company with Akkad, the Celt with the Iberian. The chief Zimrite region was Bithynia,

where the Bedanites or Patinians revived their national life not far from their old allies the Dardanians, and where kings named Prusias ruled over the descendants of Peresh or Buryas. In that country, and scattered throughout Phrygia, another Zerethite region, dwelt Cimmerians, Galatians, and Midianites. These Cimmerians had founded Smyrna, and the Midianites of the line of Ephah, the famous city of Ephesus in the very heart of the Lydian kingdom. In Phrygia £heir kings ruled alternately with those of Zerethite blood, a Midas following a Gordius, and a Gordius a Midas. Those who occupied Galatia in the third century B.C. seem to have been unsuccessful invaders of Greece, who had been com
pelled to retire to their Asiatic home. These Galatians kept their Celtic speech down to the time of St. Jerome, about 400 A.D. Probably the most conservative Hittites of Asia Minor were the Cilicians, who continued under the sway of their native kings down to the beginning of the Christian era. When St. Paul visited Lycaonia, so named after Beth-Lechem, the people of that country had a language peculiar to themselves, which the Phrygian inscriptions, belonging to the period of Persian occupation, show to have been Hittite.^^ As the vernacular of Cilicia was of the same character, it is probable that the apostle understood it, and that his companion St. Barnabas from the Hittite country of..Cyprus was also acquainted with the widespread but then perishing tongue. The utter indifference of the Greeks and Romans to all matters ethnological, save as these concerned themselves, has left us almost entirely destitute of data for determining the nature of the aboriginal speech of the nations of Asia Minor
and the time of its cessation. There* is no evidence that any of these nations adopted the Persian language. Prior to the time of Alexander, therefore, the peoples of Pontus, Cappadocia, and Cilicia, of Paphlagonia, Phrygia, and Lycia, of Mysia and Lydia must have spoken dialects of the Hittite language, which the inscription on the Stone Bowl from Babylon and those found ini Phrygia and Lycia show to have been archaic Basque approaching in form the Etruscan. In Pisidia, Pamphyllia, and Caria, and along the coasts of Lydia and Mysia, a Pelasgic tongue allied to the Greek was in use. And in parts of Bithynia, Galatia, and
32 Acts xiv. 11.



276 THE HITTITES.
Phrygia proper the Celtic dialects, Cymric and Gaelic, were current. After Alexander opened up the eastern world this primitive state of things underwent a change. In all the Hittite area Greek became the language of the cities and towns, with the exception of the eastern part of Cappadocia which fell under Armenian influences, and the corresponding region of Pontus, whigh retained its Hittite affinities with the peoples of the neighbouring Caucasus. Elsewhere in Asia Minor the Hittite language was banished to
rural districts, and there, for all that is known to the contrary, it
may have continued to exist far into the Christian centuries. The hellenizing process begun in the time of Alexander must have been the cause of many migrations into Europe, although such migrations must have taken place many centuries earlier, owing to Assyrian, Lydian, Cimmerian, and Persian encroachments on that personal liberty of which the Hittite was most tenacious. We
must look, therefore, to other lands and other influences for the extinction in the west of the Hittite language* and nationality.

CHAPTER XX.
The Western Dispersion of the Hittites.
When Herodotus the Carian wrote his history in the middle of the fifth century B.C., he was able to indicate two great Hittite miorration routes, and to give much information regarding the peoples whom he found upon them. He also indicates another in Africa which has been already mentioned, although it should be added that, while the Canary Islands formed its western terminus, it was also continued across the Mediterranean to the southern shores of western Europe to which it brought a mingled Iberian and Celtic population, some considerable time before the same
elements descended into Italy, Gaul, and Spain, from the north. The two routes which Herodotus points out are the Thracian and the Scythic ; of these the Thracian was probably the more ancient. It is impossible to tell when the first Greek settlements were
made in Hellas, on account of the transference of traditions from
site to site, those pertainhig to Egypt, Palestine, and other eastern countries, being located in the European seats in which the Greeks
at last built up a national existence. As difficult is it to tell when
the Hittite who preceded the Greek first established himself in Delphi and Thebes, in Athens and Mycene. We know, however^ that when Darius the son of Hystaspes entered Europe, towards the end of the sixth century B.C., he found the Thracians and Scythians there in large numbers, and the latter so strong that
he was compelled to retire before them. It is evident, therefore, that some of the Hittites must have passed into Europe when the government of Asia Minor was divided between the Assyrians and the Lydians. The latter people left Saravene and Melitene in eastern Cappadocia, soon after the reign of Ashur-Nazir-Pal, probably about the year 900 B.C., and moved westward towards the Mediterranean. It is not likely that they found the intervening region unoccupied, for Hittite fugitives everywhere
became the world's pioneers, their love of liberty leading them to



278 THE HITTITES.
seek new and unfrequented regions, where for a tirae they could
live the nomad hunter's life, merely clearing- as much land as would suffice to let in the air to drive away the flies from about their dwellings, and to produce the crop of grain and vegetables which would keep them in daily bread. They did not move by nations but by communities consisting of the representatives of
various tribes, so that their ti-ack is hard to follow. Among the oldest exiles from Asia Minor may be placed the Hittite aborigines of Peloponnesus, whom later immigrants drove out of Thrace, then out of Macedonia and southern Illyria, and afterwards from Epirus, Thessaly, and the southern states of northern
Greece. These were of many different tribes. The Ethnanites were scattered from Athens in the east to Lepreum in Triphyllia in the west ; the Temenites dwelt throughout Achaia, and southward to the Alphaeus ; the Hepherite family of Lechem seem to have been the original dwellers in Arcadia ; and the descendants of the Paseachite and Heraclid Joels possessed El is, and sent colonies into Messenia. In Megara, Corinth, and Argos, the Rephaim and Regemites were found, and the men of Ir Nahash, the nephew of Raphah. With these Hittite families were mingled the Etamites of Horite descent whose centres were Sparta and Ithome ; and the Buzites ^nd Gekerites generally, with the Orchomenian Minyans, and the Japhetic Goim, exercised lordship over them and their Hittite congeners. The next •colonists in point of antiquity were those of northern Greece,
which contained the two great regions of Thessaly and Epirus, named after the Hittite ancestors Zochar and Hepher. Leucadia and Cephallenia in the extreme west were colonized by exiled Rassites, Leucadia being named after Laadah or Lagadah, and Cephallenia after his grandson Chebron. Acarnania was largely a Japhetic settlement of the Ekronites or descendants of Geker,
and iEtolia was so called from Jediael the son of his brother Jamin, although it contained Hittite and Midianite settlements. Doris also seems to have been purely Japhetic, being colonized from the Palestinian Dor, no doubt by sea. But the three regions of the Locri with Phocis and Boeotia were meeting places of many tribes, Etamite,Hittite and Jerachmeelite, where Thebes commemo
rated Jabez, Delphi, the "femenite Eliphaz, and Parnassus, the

Mehirite Ir Nachash. The neighbouring island of Euboea was divided between the Kenezzite Charashim and the Ishhod of Samlah of Masrekah. West of Macedonia, the Dardanii and Illyrii dwelt, two names
denoting one people, the Zerethites and those called after Zereth's
descendant, Jehaleleel. Cavii from Ziph, Jehaleel's son, also dwelt there, with Temenite Albani, and Hamathite Parthihi. Macedonia was brimfull of Hittite tribes, the very Macedonian name being that of the Maachathites which was preserved also in that of the Mygdones. Chalcidice and Elymea were Midianite, but Emathia, Pieria, Pelagonia, Paeonia, Orbelia, were settlements of the Hamathites, Beorians, Baalchananites, Jephunnites, and Amraphelites. The Paeones were a remnant of the Teucri. The Thracians then were the latest of this succession of Hittite colonists. Herodotus calls them the most powerful people in the world except the Indians. Their name came from the Temenite Zerach, from whom probably the Tliracian Trausi and Dersaei were derived. The Edoni were Ethnanites, and the Sithones descendants of Eshton ; the Brygi were European Phrygians, descended from the Zerethite Berigah. and the Cicones, Chushamites. The Sapaei were Ziphites and the Satrae bore the name of Achashtari ; but the Crobyzi, Coeletae, and Triballi seem to
have been Celtic or Midianite, and the Bessi and Bisaltae, off-shoots from the Japhetic lines of Buz and Abichail. After the time of Herodotus, the regions to the north of Trace, namely Moesia and Dacia, were filled with MaReshethite and Moschic tribes, among which were mingled Paseachites about Tibiscus, Iberian Zerethites at Bersovia, Burridensii or Beerothites, and Arpli or Rephaim. That the Getae who accompanied these peoples were Hittites is doubtful, for the Goths first appeared in that country, whose name may be connected with the Philistine Gath. It was the men of Gath who slew the sons of Tahath or the second Thothmes at the siege of Thebes, and these were the Buzites in the line of Abihail, the Greek (Ebalus.^ Apulum was a great stronghold of the Dacians, and there are other indications that this Japhetic
people was scattered among the Hittite tribes. From about the time of Herodotus, a Gothic language must have been evolved out
1 1 Chron. vii. 21.



280 THE HITTITES.
of the old Pelasfjic speech of Philistia and Caria, and this language the Goths imposed upon many Hittite tribes, some of which are known in history as the Lombards, Burgundians, Franks, and Gepidae, who were original Leophrites, Regemites, Irnahashites, and Jabezites. In the north of Dacia, the Thracian stream met that which came from the Caucasus and the country north of that range between the Caspian and the Black Seas, and flowed westward along the northern shores of the latter. All the rivers in these two regions bore Hittite names; the Isteror Danube uniting Achashtari with Dinhaba, and the Marisus, Moschius, Tibiscus, Savus, and Porata honouring Mareshah, Meshag, Pasach, Ziph, and Beroth, while the Hypanis, Naparis, Ararus, Borysthenes, Tiarantus,and Tyras commemorate Jephunneh, Hepher, Jehaleleel, Rishathaim, Tirhanah, and Zerach. Everywhere over the world
the Hittites may be traced as the namers of rivers. Before the time of the patriarch Abraham they began this practice in
Babylonia, Palestine, and Egypt, and, far down in the Christian centuries, they continued it, giving to the streams of the New
World, down into Chili, the ancient names that their forefathers imposed upon the rivers of Europe and Asia. The tribes to the north of the Black Sea which Herodotus calls Scythic were not all Hittite. His Sauromatae or Sarmatians were descendants of the Jerachmeelite Shaharaim, and thus a purely Japhetic people.^ The Budini again, with deep blue eyes
and bright red hair, were Midianite or Celtic Bedanites, Patinians, or Bithynians of the same Persic race as those who named Batthina in Persis.^ His Scyths proper, however, were the Beerothites westward bound, whose wanderings were not to cease till in Albion they left the name of Briton. He calls them Scyths or Borysthenites as the inhabitants of Olbia or Borysthenes. This name was probably formed out of that of Rishathaim or Rustam, the last great monarch of their golden age. Herodotus gives seven generations of these Scythians, beginning with Spargapithes, the form of whose name suggests that, as Parthians, these Borysthenites had been for a time under Persian influences. The essential part of the word is Rechab. His son Lycus bears the Beerothite
2 1 Chron. viii. 8. 3 Herodot. iv. 108.



THE WESTERN DISPERSION OF THE HITTITES. 281
name Likhi, but GnuTus, that of his grandson, has no special
connection with the family. Saulius, however, the son of Gnurus, recalls Saul of Rehoboth, and his son Idan thyrsus appears in a Tyndarid and Tentyrid form of Hadadezer. Ariapithes, the son of Idanthyrsus, gives Rehob instead of Rechab, with the Persian termination. His three sons were Scylas, a second Saul, Octamasadiis, an Eshtemoag, which was indeed a Zocharite name but belonged also to the Hamathites of Ezra, and Oricus a designation of no ethnic import. The Scythians, from whom Herodotus got the story of Targitaus and his three sons as ancestors of all the Scyths, must have been Zerethites of the very family from which Cyrus claimed descent, for this Targitaus is either Jerigoth or a Tirgathi descended from her, and interposing between her and Jesher, Shobab, and Ardon. The eldest son Leipoxais, the head of the Auchatae, is, however, an Elihhaz, from whom, through Chusham of the land of Temeni, came the Chushathites or Ossetes. Arpoxais, the progenitor of the Catiari and Traspians, is Arbag who was a great man among the Anakim, and the Catiari are the Gesshurites to whose line he belonged. He is the only genuine
descendant of Targitaus. The third son Colaxais, father of the
Paralatae, is a puzzle, for his is the Cilician and Colchian name belonging to the Kenezzite Charashim, while the Paralatae or royal Scythians should be the descendants of Aharhel who continued the line of Regem and Harum. The two families may have become connected in Upper Egypt, but no record of snch connection has yet been found. The Scythic Issedones, whom Aristeas of Proconnesus found in the far north, were no doubt a branch of the Esthonians, descended from Eshton the father of Beth Rapha. The Callipedae, dwelling on the Hypanis, seem identified, through their river, with Caleb the son of Jephunneh as Zocharites, and thus with the Chalybes of Pontus. Next to them were the Alazoniaus, a people known to Homer who brings them to Troy from Alybe under Hodius and Epistrophus. The Alazonus river was in Albania ; and it has been shown that this word Alazon is a form q^ Baalchanan answering to it as the Sanscrit Arjuna answers to Phalguna. The Alazonians, therefore, were, equally with the Auchatae, descendants of Leipoxais or Eliphaz. An American off-shoot of the same people named the



282 THE HITTITES.
Allegheny mountains. They were the constant companions of the Jephunnites, so much so that some of the ancient geographers make them as Pelagones the same people as the Paeones.* They were a branch of the Alans, who, with the Huns or Jephunnites and the Iberians or Avars, became for many years the scoui'ges of Europe. Northward of the Alazones dwelt the Neuri, beyond whom lay a terra incognita. These were the descendants of the Egyptian Naharina and the Assyrian Nairi, and of the same race as the Maurui or Moors, who, while those dwelt above the Black Sea, were threading their way along the Mediterranean coast of Africa. Eshton was embraced under this nvame and his sons Rapha, Paseach, and Techinnah the father of Ir Nachash. The Neuri reached Italy and constituted part of the Etruscan population as the Naharcer of the Eugubine Tables. They changed their doubtful medial guttural into a labial when the}^ founded Novaria in Cisalpine Gaul, and when they took possession of a part of northern Spain and called it Navarra. But the Ugrianized portion of this family, claiming kindred, through language as well as by name and blood, .with the Esthonians and the Lapps, called themselves Majiars ; and they, in the ninth century A.D., from some eastern region descended upon the plains of Hungary, where like the Basques in the Pyrenees they hold their own to this day. Unfortunately Herodotus does not give the native names of other Scythian tribes, but calls them Ploughers, Husbandmen, Maneaters, and Black robes! He has said enough, however, to indicate without any doubt the fact that the so-called Scythians were Hittites with a few intermingled Celtic and Japhetic tribes. The customs of the Scythians as described by him are those of many of the Siberian and American aborigines. Such are the burial of their kings and great chiefs under huge mounds, the scalping of their slain enemies, the use of the vapour bath, and the setting up
a stuffed horse-hide on stakes beside a warrior's grave. The cloak generally black and the capuchin like head-dress attached to it, as figured in tombs at Kertch and elsewhere in the Scythian
area, correspond with the Hittite attire set forth in carvings in Asia Minor, and agree with the dress of the ancient Mexican priests as described by native authors. The trowsers depicted on

THE WESTERN DISPERSION OF THE HITTITES. 283
the Kertch figures must have been borrowed from the Celts, from whom those Persians who were not Celts adopted them. Sir Henry Rawlinson remarks that the Scythic manner of stringing a bow by passing the arc under the left leg below the knee and thus depressing it is common to the Bhils, Huzarehs, Kurds and other orientals. The orientals he names are Hittites by
descent.^' The regions that stand next in geographical relation to Dacia and European Scythia are Pannonia and Illyricum, but while the latter bears a purely Hittite name and is well attested as the
abode of a mixed Iberian and Celtic people, it does not exhibit
traces of occupation by the principal Hittite tribes that possessed Italy, all of which were in that country in the time of Herodotus. The story of the Etruscans brings them from Lydia by sea to the Tyrrhenian coast, and that of the Messapian Japygians of Apulia is that they came in the same way from the island of Crete.^ But according to Latin tradition the Umbrians were among the oldest inhabitants of Italy and predecessors of the Etruscans
;
they are also said to have dwelt originally far north in Cisalpine Gaul, out of which they were driven by the Boii, Senones, and more recent Celtic colonists. The recently translated Umbrian
tables of the Eugubine series state that they were engraved in the three hundredth year of the Umbrian era, and as their date is 177 B.C., it follows that that era was 477 B.C.^ This is
certainly recent, but it suffices to take us back to the shadowy Roman period of Cincinnatus and the Fabii. The knowledge which Herodotus possessed concerning the Umbrians, beside whom the Etruscans settled, was vague, for he represents two unknown rivers, the Alpis and Carpis, as rising in their country and flowing into the Danube. If by the Alpis he means the Colapis, a tributary of the Save, his Umbrians must have been in the north of Illyricum. Be this as it may, it is evident that the Umbrians, whom their tables, which are inscribed with a purely Celtic language most allied to Erse Gaelic, prove to have been a

284 THE HITTITES.
Celtic or Midianite people, came into Italy overland. The traditions of the Cymri bring them from Deffrobani in the land of Hav, which is well identified with Taphrae or Perekop in the Crimea. Whether they came there through the passes of the Caucasus or coasted round the Black Sea when expelled from Aisia Minor, or, leaving Media, went all the way round the Caspian, we cannot tell. But the Cimmerians were certainly
there, together with the Hittite Scythians, and in the time of Herodotus the Budini were still in that ancient seat, while other tribes, the Crobyzi, Sensii, and Triballi were farther to the south
and west. The next region occupied by these Celtic tribes was Pannonia or Hungary which was almost purely Celtic for centuries. Mutenum, the Coletiaui, the Hercuuiates, Perso. Ulmum, Bodonhely, setting forth Midian, Gilead, Rakem, Peresh, Ulam, Bedan, are a few indications of that Celtic population of Pannonia for which the classical geographers vouch.^ The very name Pannonia is one that has suffered from phonetic decay, being a corruption of Padonia. These Celts, not unaccompanied
by Hittites, crossed the Carnic Alps into Histria or eastern Venetia, and made their way to the broad region between the Padus or Bodencus, which they named after Bedan, and the Tiber. There, about the year 477 B.C., they set up a kingdom which the Romans called Umbrian but also Sappinian, and which the Etruscans called that of the Amra and of the Ugabemini : but the Umbrians themselves entitle it the kingdom of the Ijovein, whence the name of their capital Iguvium.® The Sabines seem to have belonged to the same race. Other Celtic tribes held a great part of Cisalpine Gaul and Venetia, with parts of Rhaetia and Noricum. These, from time to time, submitted to the lord of the Ijovein in Iguvium, who by a large army maintained his authority over them. When the Eugubine Tables were written in 177 B.C. king Herti had just concluded a war against his revolted colonists, many of whom had exchanged Umbrian for Etruscan rulers, and who, with the Umbrian and Etruscan states, soon fell under the immediate power of the Romans. At the time that the Celts established themselves in Pannonia

THE WESTERN DISPERSION OF THE HITTITES, 285
and Italy, the eastern coast of the Adriatic was inhabited chiefly by two powerful Hittite tribes, the Liburnians in the north, and below them, extending over the greater part of the country, the Illyrians. The Liburnians were the men of Leophrah, who, as the AUapur, had dwelt in that Armenia whence came the Alarodians of Herodotus.^" They had tyrannized over the Patinians and Zuzim in Syria, and had imposed their kings named Lubarna upon them. Their
record in Asia Minor is small, being restricted in the west to Labranda in Caria, and Leucophrys or Tenedos, with part of the
Mj'sian coast Ij'ing opposite to that island. They seem, however, to have accompanied the Carians in some of their migrations, for Lepreum in Elis, and Aliphera, near by in Arcadia, were two of their memorials. But the main body formed a Hittite advanced guard which reached the head of the Polatic Gulf of the Adriatic. There the Absyrtides, the chief of which was Absorus, and Monetium retained the memory of Leophrah's grandfather Abiezer and his father Meonothai and the Daesitiates set forth Zoheth, The Liburqians, favoured by the many islands that shut in their coast, became expert seamen and developed into
pirates who were for a long time the terror of the natives of the
opposite Italian shore. On it they made many settlements, chiefly represented by the Zoheth name as in Venetia, where the Atestini are called by the Umbrian king Herti the Daet-om, and further south where the Teateas of Sabinum and Apulia appear. But they played a more important part in Italian colonization when they planted on tlie western coast the Osci or Ausones and the Aurunci, took possession of the Liparae islands and
strongly established themselves in Sicily. Then they moved northwards to Portus Herculis Labronis or Liburni south of Pisae in Etruria, and from thence to Liguria of which they were
probably among the earliest colonists, for their Libarna was far
inland beyond the Apennines and their Statielli or, as the
Umbrian record calls them, Sihit-ir and An-Sihit-ir, representing doubtless Zoheth and Benzoheth, were the chief people or peoples of Liguria. Many other regions were occupied by the piratical Liburnians, who finally proceeded to the extreme south-west of Gaul where they founded Lapurdum now

Bayonne, and where in the Labourd their descendants may be found to the present day as the Lapurtanian Basques. Strange to say lapur in Basque means a robber. The Illyrians had as evil a reputation as the Liburnians. Bearing the name of Jehaleleel they numbered among them the cave-dwelling Dardanii called after his ancestor Zereth. The Illyrians were not Ziphites apparently but the descendants of Tiria and Asareel. The former were represented by the Derrii, and the latter, by the people of Ancus and Arba, but especially by the Dalmatians between Delrainium and the sea, whose great father was Talmai the son of Anak, the son of Arba. These Zerethites took possession of Sardinia and planted colonies in
Italy, including the places called by the Romans Solaria and Ad Solaria in northern Etruria ajid on the Ligurian coast, but which the Etruscan Eugubine Tables call Ilerda. It is probable that they named the Rhodanus or Rhone, and that they renamed the Padus, calling it Eridanus after the ancestral Ardon. They must, therefore, have had colonies in eastern Gaul. Out of these, however, they were driven to the Pyrenees where they were known as Sardones, where lluro was one of their foundations, and whence the tribes of the llergetes and Ilercaones
passed into Spain. They were also represented in the latter country by the Arevaci, the Oretani, and the Segobrigenses setting forth Arba, Ardon, and Segub, and by other tribes including the Turdetani, the Toltecs of the west. South of Dalmatia,
where the Adriatic coasts narrow its channel, the Albani had their habitation, and the kilted mountaineers who call themselves Skipetar dwell in that Albania to the present day speaking a language half Greek, half Hittite. Some of them wereEpidamni,aname of which the epi is superfluous, for their British brethren were simply Damnii Albani. Epidamnus too was called Dyrrachium from Zerach, and above it lay Petra named after Zerach's father Bozrah. The Albani seem to have been men of the sea like the Liburnians and Illyrians ; they must also have been in the van of Hittite migration from Paphlagonia in Asia Minor and from Albania in the Caucasus, for they appear in Elis as the namers of the Alpheus, in Arcadia about Thelphusa, and at Delphi in Phocis. They were also among the most

western of the Dacian tribes as the Albocensii. But the chief
reason for regarding them as early colonists of Italy is that,
although a coast people by nature, they occupied an inland
position in that peninsula, being shut out from the sea on every side by later intruders. How their name of Temenite was changed to Samnite may not be easily told, but there is no doubt that the Samnites were the Temenite Albanians, Their Alban name survived in AUifae, but the distinguishing name that henceforth follows them in history is that of Pentri, given to one of their tribes to replace the Petras of Achaia and
Albania, a name already associated with the Temenites in the story of Pandareus, whose legend is that of Tereus or Zerach. The Caraceni, another Samnite tribe, commemorated Zerach, and Abellinum was the record of Baalhanan. The Phaebatae in Albania of Illyricum preserved the memory of Jobab as a Delphic Phoebus ; in Samnium, Bovianum was called after him. At an early period these Samnites sent colonies into Liguria which reproduced the nomenclature of central Italy. Livy calls the mountain region of the Apennines in which the Ligurian Temenites dwelt, and which is now called Diamante, by the name Suismontium.^^ These Temenites were Epanterii, with a capital at Bobium, and many Albas round about them. In many parts of the south of France their traces are found, and in northern Spain
they constitute the Alavan division of the Basques: but their principal colonies were to the north of Italy and in Gaul. The Umbrian Eugubine tables call the Epanterii of Liguria the
Fondli, or, in the plural, Fondlire, a name which carries at once
to Vindelicia, which anciently included those parts of Bavaria and Wurtemburg that lie to the south of the Danube, and to the Vandals. Confusion is likely to result, however, in tracing the Vandal name, which arises almost as naturally out of Jediael as out of Botsrah, and certainly with far more apparent resemblance. The Samnites in the peninsula were hemmed in by those Hittite tribes Which had allied themselves in Egypt and Palestine with the Japhetic Gekerites. These had possessed the Saronic sea coast in Palestine, and in Asia Minor occupied Caria and part of Pamphyllia. That they early sent colonies into Greece is

apparent from the position of their colonies in the extreme west
in Elis and the Epirotic coast The three districts in northern Greece called Locris seem also to have been indebted to these tribes for part of their popul^ion. The word Locris is of doubt
ful ethnic character. In British history it is made Locrin, and denotes the eponym of one of the three great divisions of the
ancient British population, the others being Albanact and Kamber'i2 The Loeffrians, descended from him, seem to have belonged to the same race as the people of Lochlyn or Scandinavia.
The Palestinian name that answers to these is Lasharon and this, with initial and final augments, is Halicarnassus of Caria.^^ No special Hittite series of names accompanies this geographical and
tribal designation, which seems to have been applied to otf-shoots from various tribes that placed themselves under the government of the Gekerites who once owned Lasharon and carried that name with them to other landa Wherever the name appears it carries with it the record of an Aryan influence, by which Hittites were converted into Greek, Latin, and Teutonic tribes. To the east of Samnium, and extending far beyond it to the south, lay Apulia with a chief city Luceria. There the Japhetic descendants of Abihail had come to power, and with them their brethren of the same Buzite family, the Pediculi or men of Abdigel whose record in Elis was Epitalium. Under their sway were Hittite Daunians, Feucetians, and Messapian Japygians. The latter call for some attention. They were the descendants of that Ammono-Hittite stock over which Jabez and Mezahab had ruled in Egypt, and were thus the Caphtorim who had gone out of that land with the Philistines into Canaan. Nothing more is heard of these Caphtorim until the Assyrians make mention of them under a new name, that of Moschi, derived from Meshag, the son of Jabez and grandfather of Mezahab. In Asia Minor, however, they got back the Cappadocian name. To the Greeks the Cappadocians were known as the White Syrians, which shows that they must have owned a large proportion of Aryan blood ; Philistine and Caphtorim must, therefore, have kept company.^* No people of

THE WESTERN DISPEBSION OF THE HITTITES. 289
Asia Minor was subjected to harder treatment than the Cappadocians, for they lay in the westward track of migrating nations and of eastern conquerors. The pressure exercised upon them from Lydia, on the one hand, and Assyria and Media, on the other, was probably the cause of a great migration to the sea coast of western Cilicia or Pamphyllia, and a water transit from thence to the shores of Europe. Herodotus and other writers, who followed his statement, derive the Messapians from Crete at a point of time not long subsequent to the Trojan war. Crete, however, although it contained other colonists besides the Zerethites who gave to it its name, exhibits no traces of the Caphtorim. Herodotus says that those who became Messapian Japyges were originally Polichnetes and Praesians, but the latter names have no historical connection with the former. On the other hand it is certain that the Cappadocians were Caphtorim. The first migration, therefore, was from Asia Minor, and not from Crete, but it was under Carian or Gekerite leadership and this may have originated the Cretan story. There was a Messapius mountain in Boeotia, and from that country, of which Thebes was the capital, Strabo makes Messapus lea^ the Messapians to Italy. In Pausanias, Methapus is an Athenian author of mysteries. Most geographers place the Greek Messapii in Ozolian Locris ; and there is an obscure mention of a Messapeae in Peloponnesus. The story of the foundation of Metapontum by Metabus, the son of Sisyphus, is not to be separated from those relating to the Messapians, for Metapontum with its harvest of gold is but a form of Mezahab the golden Horus and the father of Matred, the Greek Danae of the shower of gold. Professor Rawlinson would bring the Messapians from Peloponnesus, but it is hard to find any traces of them there.^^ Adjoining the Locri Ozolae in ^tolia, however, the Apodoti dwelt, whose name, together with the tradition that Apis of ancient royal fame was a stranger from ^tolia, the proximity of the Locrian Messapians, and of a Halicyrna and a Uria in the south of -^tolia, favours their identification with the Japygians who founded Hyria or Uria in Apulia. But another competitor for the honour of sending the Japygians to Italy is the Illyrian Albania. The Albanians do not

call themselves by that name, which belonged to former occupants of their country. They are Skipetar, a word said to mean mountaineers, but which so resembles Caphtor that their Cappadocian origin is determined by it and confirmed by the name of their city Mezzovo. The date of the arrival of the Messapian Japygiana in Apulia must be found not later than the beginning of the sixth century, B.C., for the Eleatic School of Philosophy was founded in the midst of a kindred population in Lucania belonging to the same migration, in 536, That they came from Locris or ^tolia, from Albania of the Skipetar, or from the more northern parts of Illyricum where in the time of the classical geographers the lapodes dwelt, is very doubtful. These Jabezite or Cappadocian colonies were probably subsequent to that which, from Asia Minor and Cappadocia direct, in the troublous times of contest between the Lydians and the Medes, set sail under the leadership of the Apulians for the Italian coast. The Messapian Japyges and their Apulian protectors may thus be regarded as
among the earliest of Italian colonists. As preserving the names of the greatest and the last of the Hittite Pharaohs, more romantic
interest attaches to the Messapian Japyges than to any other Hittite people. Herodotus relates the story of Aristaeus of the island of Proconnesus in the sea of Marmora. Aristaeus was a poet of a noble family in Proconnesus who suddenly dropped dead in a baker's shop, to the great alarm of the tradesman. When his
friends came to give him burial his body had disappeared, and a man from Cyzicus averred that he had met Aristaeus at the time he was reported to have died, and had spoken to him. Seven years after, the poet made his appearance at Proconnesus, and composed his work called the Arimaspeia, in which he gave an account of his northward wanderings among the Arimaspians, the Issedones, and the gold guarding griffins. Once more he vanished, and three hundred and forty years later, he went to the Metapontines and commanded them to erect an altar to Apollo and a statue to himself, which they did.^^ Herodotus says that the Arimaspi were so called from two Scythic words arima, one and spu, eye, as they were a one-eyed people. Their relation to the gold guarding griffins and Metapontum shews that they were a

THE WESTERN DISPERSION OF THE HITTITES. 291
northern branch of the Messapians, still adhering to the Egyptian form of Mezahab's name as Har-em-hebi or Hor-em-neb, the golden Horus. The Germanized Menapii and Gepidae were the
same people. South-west of the Apulians the Lucanians were situated These were the Regemites, another branch of the family of Achuzam, whose descendant Aharhel was lionoured in Heraclea, while Joel the son of that hero was the eponym of Elea, the seat of an early school of philosophy, in which some of the sublime teachings of Paseach and his son Job, the maternal ancestors of Joel, were revived. These Regemites or Lucanians had been completely hellenized by the Gekerites, whose Aciris, Acheronia, Pyxus, and Pandosia, repeat the geographical nomenclature of the Epirotic coast. South of Lucania again was Bruttium, not
named after Beeroth, but, by the change of I to r, after Pelet, the brother of Regem. The Bruttians, therefore, were the Maachathites of Italy, commemorating Sheber in Sybaris, Tirhanah, in Terina and Tauriana, and Madmannah, in Medma. The hellenic descendants of Geker and Buz and Abihail dwelt among them as among the Lucanians and Japygians, transforming a land that might have been a western Cathay into a Magna Graecia. Of the same mixed Hittite and Japhetic race were the Campanians to the west of the Samnites, as their Acerrae, Herculaneum, and Cumae attest. Through all of these regions members of other
Hittite families were settled, some of whom like the Zocharites who founded Hipponium in Bruttium, had crossed over from the African coast. Campania and Latium contained representatives of almost all the seven Hittite tribes, many of which had not been
anciently subjected to Japhetic influences, so that Hittite or, as it
may be called in Italy, Etruscan speech long survived among them. The Romans professed to be the descendants of the Dardanian JEnea,s, which their very name of Roman contradicts ; yet the widespread tradition must have had some origin in fact. The fact can only be that in Latium some of the Dardanians and Illyrians, whom we found on the east of the Adriatic, had made settlements prior to those of the Romans or coincident with them.
Alba Longa, the original seat of Roman authority, bears a. Temenite name, unless we suppose it to be a form of Arba, for the

father of the mythic JEneas as Anchises represents Anak the son of Arba, a true Dardauian. The Zerethites are best represented in Italy by the Frentani in Ortona and Anxanum, the Frentanian name being, like the Persian Feridun, a form of Ardon. The names of the kings of Alba Longa belong to many different Hittite families, and do not exhibit the prominence of any one stock in Latium. But Rome, with its mythic Romulus and Remus, declares plainly that its founders were of the race of Jerahmeel and Ram, and shews that, at an early period of Italian colonization, the Aryan asserted his supremacy as the Brahman of the western world. Little can be said of the Sabine cantons or, speaking more correctly, of those east of Sabinum. The Marsi were no doubt MaReshethites, but their Marrubium really belonged to the Beerothite family as a disguised Mercaboth. The Peligni were really Samnite, like the Pelagones and Paphlagonians, so that they had no right to Imaeus, an Italian Hamath, to Sulmo, a related Salma of Beth-Lechem, or to Corfinium which, like Cerfennia on Lake Fucinus, was a European Saravene or Beth Zur that the Marsi must have introduced. More important is Etruria. The majority of authorities is in favour of the descent of the Etrurians from the Lydians, and there is nothing to disprove this testimony. Their ancient name is said to have been Rasena, which must be the Ras of the Assyrian inscriptions and of the Hittite one of Merash with the sign of the old Hittite plural en. When, however, the nomenclature of the twelve Etruscan States and their dependencies is analyzed, it becomes evident that many Hittite tribes besides the Ras contributed to their population. The Umbrian Eugubine Tables classify the Etruscans as the Tuscer, Naharcer, and Japuscer, among whom we do not find the Ras, for the Naharcer and Japuscer are both Nairi tribes, answering to the Navarrese and Guipuscoans of the Pyrenees, while the Tuscer may represent the widespread name of Zocheth in its Persian Zohak form. The replacement of final t or th by k is a very common process even at the present day. The uneducated French Canadian errs in this way continually, turning patate into patak and omelette into omelak. How the Ras failed to be noticed by
the Umbrian Herti is not easy to say, for they did constitute an



THE WESTERN DISPERSION OF THE HITTITES. 293
important, and probably the original, element in Etruria. In north-eastern Etruria there were three cities called Arretium, in Etruscan, Aretiag. So in Chaldea the name Ras was modified to Rat, and their identity established by Rat being made one of the abodes of the god Lagudah, who is Lagadah, the father of Ma Reshah. The same nomenclature appears in northern Venetia, where Artegnia was a faithful colony of Arretium, and in Rhaetia, which Livy and other writers have connected with the Etruscans, where the chief of Artebanesa or the house of the Ras, proved unfaithful.^'^ The termination van, the Circassian vuna, a dwelling, answering to the Hebrew heth, has so far appeared in connection with Zur the descendant of MaReshah, as Zervan and Saravene. In Phrygia, however, it is joined to Ras as Ardaban, and among the Narisci of southern Germany it appears as Ratispona or Ratisbon. The Assyrian month Marchesvan seems to have been compounded of the same elements. The ruling family in Arretium was that of the Cilnii. This is a thoroughly Shuhite word derived from Shelah the son of Shuah and father of Laadah, In Chaldea it appears as Bit
Silani, and in Greek it became Silenus.^^ Marsyas was a Silenus, not an object of contempt but, a being endowed with superior wisdom. The chief of the Cilnii was Maecenas, and his name was probably that of Maon, pronounced with regard to the power of the medial ayin as Magon. It was the fate of the Ras to be germanized on their way northward. After they left Rhaetia and Noricum they met the Gothic wave from the east and became Narisci and Marsacii, losing their old language but carrying their
glorious Hittite traditions into the heart of Germany to enrich its folk-lore with mdhrchen for many a Grimm. Liguria is a remarkable region viewed ethuologically. One
of the best guides to it is the Eugubine Tables, for much of their story concerns Liguria. Its name is the old Locrian one th^t has appeared in Greece and in Bruttium, and must have come
from the Japhetic lords of the Hittites who constituted its chief population. These Japhetic lords must have dwelt at Genoa, which was named after the Gekerite Guni.^^ In the region of

294 THE HITTITES.
the Apulian Pediculi, who are the Abdigelites that came of the same family as Abihail, throuiih Abdiel or Abdigel the son of Guni, we find Cannae and Canusium, Vergellus, and Bardnli. Genoa was inimical to the Umbrians and Etruscans at the time when their armies united to subdue their revolting colonies in Liguria, Venetia, and Cisalpine Gaul. The cause of the Umbrian revolt was the election of a generalissimo over the Perscler, as the Umbrian tables call them, who were the Umbrian army of occupation in the regions indicated. It being the turn of the
Venetian tribe of the Asseriates to elect the general, they chose
one Parfa, who was distasteful to the other tribes. These tribes accordingly seceded under their former commander Appei and ravaged a great part of Venetia and Cisalpine Gaul. The
Perscler or Perscli were, so far as can be judged, a very ancient warlike community or force, first embodied from among the Jerachmeelite or Philistine tribes by Barachel the Buzite for service in Egypt.
This was prior to the lime of Job, for Elihu the son of this Barachel was the patriarch's friend. Comparative geography shows that Achi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, belonged to the line of Barachel. These warriors followed the fortunes
of the Hittites, who excelled them in civilization and the arts of
life, but who were well satisfied to live under the protection of the strong and valorous sons of Japheth. In India they existed in the fifth century under the name of Abdiel being the White Huns, Abtelites or Enthalites who then occupied the Punjab.-*' In Asia Minor, Barachel was commemorated by the city Bargylia. From this point, therefore, the Bargylians or Barachelites must
have set out as mercenary warriors into Europe, to sell their services to any monarchs wealthy enough to pay for them. They had many settlements in Italy, one of the chief being Fregellae in Latium, where they were allied with the Volsci of kindred blood, and with the .^qui who were probably the posterity of Achi son of Abdiel. In Cisalpine Gaul they possessed Brixellum
south of the Po, and Vercellae to the north of that river, above Liguria. These cities were probably camps, for the Eugubine Tables, in enumerating the Perscler, associate them with the Hittite and Celtic tribes within whose territory they were

quartered. Geoffrey of Monmouth knew the history of these warriors, which he tells after a strange fashion. He says that Gurgiunt Brabtruc King of Britain and son of Belinus, after he had conquered the Dacians, met the Barclenses under their leader Partholoim seeking for a habitation, and that he sent guides who led the wanderers to Ireland, an uninhabited country which they occupied.-^ The Irish historians agree that the Partholanians were
the first inhabitants of Ireland, but give no trustworthy account of them, save that one of the chief descendants of Partholan was Adhla, probably Abdiel, and that they were akin to the Nemedians or Midianites. They are apparently the same as the Firgailians, who were always under arms to protect the Fir-Bolg and the Fir-Dhomhnoin at their work.^^ This agrees with the con
nection of Fregellae and the Volsci. That the Japhetic Perscler or Barachelites did establish themselves in Britain, occupying Bute and other western Scottish isles as a prelude to their rule on the mainland, cannot be denied. We need not, therefore, look elsewhere for the Teutonic Britons who changed the language of
Celt and Pict. Apart from Genoa and the Perscler, the population of Liguria was almost entirely Hittite, and more Albanian than Iberian, The Epanterii, whose capital the Eugubine Tables make Bobium, answer to the Pentri of Samnium with their Bovianum and reappear in Ireland as the Vinderius and Buvinda rivers in the country of the Damnii, who in Scotland were Damnii Albani or Teroenites of Eliphaz. The four Albas of Liguria are not all connected with the Temenites, for that of the Ingauni probably belonged to the Paseachite family of Hanoch, and that called Docilia to the Zocharites, who named the Apennines as well as the Aventine, and Tigulia, which the Eugubine Tables call Tunnogura. The latter were Tungri on their way to northern Gaul, Hittites bereft of their language and nationality. The Ethnanites were represented by Libarna, answering to Liburnus in Samnium and to Laberus in Ireland on the Buvinda or Boyne. But the Sihitir and Ansihitir of the Umbrian Tables, whom the classical geographers give only as the Statielli, were tribes named after
21 Geoffrey's British History, iii. 12. 22 Keating.



296 THE HITTITES.
Zoheth and Ben Zoheth, the grandsons of Leophrah, Two other tribes mentioned by the Urabrian Herti are the Hostatir and Anostatir. The first denotes the people of Asta, who are the Jahdaites, but in America the Aztecs ; the Anostatir are some members of the same family holding a similar relation to the senior line to that which the Ansihitir sustain to the Sihitir. There are
traces of the Jachdai-arri or sons of Jaehdai in the east. The only
Celtic tribe of note in Liguria was that of the Vedianti or
Vedicanti, whose capital Pedona carried the memory of Bedan into the west. Cisalpine Gaul contained mixed Celtic and Hittite
populations, and the same was the case with Venetia. Of the latter the Brixentes, first of Brixia or Brescia and afterwards of Rhaetia, are noteworthy, seeing that they were Phrygians of
Iberic descent, soon to become Brigantes in Vindelicia, thence to pass into England and Ireland under the same name, and to occupy in the former country one of the most prominent positions taken by an ancient British race. About the mouths of the Po the Fossiones Philistinae shew that the men of Gath had found their
way to Italy. To the north of these Adria testified to the presence of the Beerothites, Bharatas, or Britons, whom king Herti calls Peret-om. This is not the place to which an ancient writer takes them, for he says that when Tsintsan Hadadezer fled from David of Israel he took refuge in Italy and built Pazzuolo or Sorento in Campania.^^ The name Tsintsan presents curious analogies with the Chushan of Chushan Rishathaim, and the Dastan that is appended to the name of the Persian Rustam. The old reign of Sumir and Akkad must have lasted for two or three centuries in northern Italy ; but not only from external Rome, from among these peoples themselves in the persons of the
Japhetic Perscler, the Genoese, the Philistines of the trenches,
arose elements that speedily changed the ancient state of things and inaugurated the Germanic as well as the Latin Aryanism that now prevail.
The alliance of the Celts with the Japhetic pioneers known as
the Perscler is significant, for in ancient times these Philistines
had been the friends of the Hittite and the enemies of the Celt.
The first indication that history gives of the union of the Aryan

with the hybrid Midianite is that which announced the rise of Median empire. Until then the Hittite had been looked up to as a king among men ; he had been tried in the balance and been found wanting. The Median and Persian periods were periods of Celtic supremacy under Aryan leadership. The only Hittite empire contemporary with them was the Lydian, and that did not
long survive the establishment of Persian royalty. The seat of Hittite authority was then transferred to Etrurif,, where a powerful confederacy maintained itself for a time, not in undisputed empire but side by side with a more extensive Celtic dominion, that of Umbria, and threatened on the south with an extinction that came at last from the rising power of Aryan Rome. In Illyria a mingled Hittite and Celtic population lived independent
of foreign jurisdiction, much after the manner of the Caucasian tribes. About 230, B.C., these lUyrians measured their strength with Rome under their queen Teuta, but were defeated, owing to the treachery of their Greek allies. Nevertheless a century
passed before the Romans made Illyria one of their provinces.
Many Hittite states, apparently without political cohesion, existed in southern Gaul, from the Maritime Alps to the Atlantic
coast ; and in Spain there seem to have been several confederations of Hittite and Celto-Hittite cities for the conquest of which the Carthaginians and Romans contended from 235, B.C. The name given to the Spanish Hittites is the Iberic. They were,
therefore, the descendants of those Zerethites whose ancestor Asher had imposed upon Assyria its name, and bore the name of his grandson Heber, the Apil-Sin of the lists and monuments. While some of the Iberians had taken refuge in the Caucasus, their main body had occupied Phrygia, replacing the name of Heber with that of his father Berigah. If, as is most likely, they came to Spain from the Illyrian coast, they must have been expelled from that coast by their brethren of the junior line of Asareel who named Dalmatia, and who, in Asia Minor, had dwelt at their back as the Isaurians about lakes Caralitis and Trogitis. In other parts of Europe the Iberians were known as the Brigantes, always being accompanied, however, by Iberic terms, as in Britain where Eboracum or York was their capital. The
traces of Iberic or Hittite peoples are found in geographical and

tribal nomenclature and in archaeological .remains throughout Gaul, but in the north the Celt preponderated, and the Hittite was compelled to amalgamate or was driv'en across the sea to the British islands or into the north-east to join the Ugrians of the
Baltic coast.
On the borders of the lakes of northern Italy and of Switzerland, as well as in those of Scotland and Ireland, the remains of water dwellings, similar to those of Prasias in Thrace and of the Gambulians in Chaldea, have been discovered. The Mexicans
built such wooden cities on pile foundations in their lakes ; and on the Orinoco in South America they may be found to this day. An antiquity has been accorded to the Swiss lake dwellers of two thousand years before the Christian era, which suffices to show how unsafe it is to place credence in what is called
archaeological science.^* An examination of Lake Prasias, where the water-loving Thracians were under the eye of Herodotus, and of the Gambulian marshes whence, three centuries before, Assurbanipal had dragged the men of Sapibel, would reveal evidences of antiquity as great as those exhibited in Switzerland
and Itiily. The poems of the British Merddin or Merlin clearly indicate that the practice of building houses in the water arose out of the desire to escape from the superintendence of reform
ing rulers, who sought to abolish human sacrifices ; and, under the names of Gwenddoleu, Alban, and Cymro, he makes the Samlaites, Temenites of Eliphaz, and the Zimrites the upholders of the proscribed creed. There is no evidence that the Cymri or
any other Celtic people took to pile villages ; when they desired
to become builders, their structures, however rude, were of stone
not of wood, and their foundation was necessarily the solid earth. The Greek stories of the Harpies and the Stymphalides, and the Persian one of the Simurgh, still further link the Samlaites, descended from Kapha, with the water dwellings, and the Gambulians of Chaldea may thus be justly regarded as the representatives of that people. The Samlaites must have dwelt near lake Prasias, for the Sithones were there, to whose race Orpheus or

Rapha belonged, but they are not connected with the lake dwellers. The name Prasias indicates nothing, but another name
of the lake, Cercinitis, and its position among the Odomantians, show that the Temenites in the line of Zerach had adopted the practice of the family with which they were anciently associated in Gebalene in the days of Samlah of Masrekah and Saul of Rehoboth. In Switzerland, lake Zurich preserved the Temenite Zerach, and the very name Helvetia is that of Eliphaz. This is proved by a statement of Plutarch that the LigurianAlpini or Ilvates meeting the Helvetians in battle, they were mutually astonished
to find their opponents using the same war-cry.^'' The men of Urba and the Tugeni, representing Rapha and Techinnah, dwelt beside these Temenites, and some Zocharites or Tigurini with a capital Aventicum. The lake dwellers on the Orinoco belong also to the Tamanac family, whose word for king is the same as the Libyan, Battus, and whose account of the creation of men and women by the first pair throwing stones behind them is identical with the story of Deucalion. In Ireland the vater dwellers were the Damnii, and in Scotland the Damnii Albani, who were little known to the ancients, dwelling among lakes and mountains.2^
The British Islands were largely occupied by Hittites, who were accompanied in their migration to the shores of England and Ireland by Celts, and by the Japhetic descendants of Geker whose language was Gothic. There was, therefore, no necessity for introducing a fictitious Hengist and Horsa to account for the germanizing of their population. That the Picts were Iberic
has long been suspected, and the same origin has been assigned to the Silures of South Wales. The Silures were northern Illyrians, whose settlements in Etruria and Liguria the Romans called Solaria. Alongside of these dwelt the men of Dyved or Demetia, a Welsh Tibhath, where the Brython or Briton, a northern Beerothite, made his appearance as the enemy of the Cymri. The Damnonii of Cornwall and Devon, equally with the Damnii of Scotland and Ireland, were Temenites ; and the
Brigantes, who occupied a large region in the centre of the

island, were Iberian Zerethites. The name Pict is harder to
locate. It is true that the British Hi ttites painted and punctured their bodies, as did the Thraciaus, Illyrians, and Iberians of Spain, but the word Pict has nothing to do with that practice. It occurs all through the Hittite area, from the Pactyans of the Punjab to Pictavum in Gaul. At times it appears to denote the Iberian Pasachites, when it is generally accompanied by Bimhal and Ashvath, names of the brothers of Pasach, and by Japhlet, that of their father. At other times it takes the place of the Basque name, which is generally restricted to the descendants of Paseach, the son of Eshton and brother of Rapha ; although the posterity of that ancient reformer are better known by such names as Khupusci, Schapsuch, Guipusci, Seepohskah. The statement of Ammianus Marcellinus that the Picts were divided into Dicaledones and Vecturiones is a very doubtful one, as the
Caledonian name is either Celtic or Japhetic, in the latter case
belonging to the family of Buz.^^ Most of the original tribes of Scotland and Ireland were Hittite. The renowned Milesians of Irish history were MaReshethites, and from them Ross in Scotland obtained its name. The Voluntii of both countries were Peltites. The Ottadeni or Gododin between England and Scotland were, as Aneurin shows, Hadadites of the Beerothite family. And Camelon, the Pictish capital, bore the name of Samlah, the Jumala of the Lapps and Finns. The Arthurian legends prove that the Hamathites had extensive settlements in England
;
Scottish history is full of the Zocharite line of Jephunneh ; and the Irish stories of Labradh and the Tuatha de Danans assert the prominence in the Green Isle of the Ethnanites. When we ask for the monuments of these wide-spread Hittites, the answer is disappointing. The traditions of the race this work has sought to collect in small measure, and to compare with geographical and tribal nomenclature, and with national or tribal customs. In Asia Minor a very few Phrygian and Lycian inscriptions have been found, besides the famous one of Merash. These are engraved not in the old Hittite hieroglyphics, but with conventional characters having an origin similar to, perhaps identical with that of the square Hebrew and European alphabets,

THE WESTERN DISPERSION OF THE HITTITES. 301
but possessing totally different phonetic values, syllabic in character. The attempt that has been made to read them as Indo-European alphabetic characters has signally failed, but the work of translating them by the Hittite syllabary is not yet complete. Enough has been read, however, to shew that they are Basque of an archaic kind, and that the Phrygian pertain to the Persian period, while the Lycian are recent and of the time of Grecian supremacy.^^ Nothing meets the eye except the peculiar language of Albania on the Adriatic until Italy is reached. Of its many non-Italian inscriptions, the Etruscan and Umbrian only have been read. The former are in current characters similar to the Phrygian, and display a more elaborate form of the Basque language, not differing so widely from that now in use in
the Pyrenees as to present any serious difficulties to the interpreter. The only historically important document is that contained in the Eugubine Tables, which are partly Etruscan and partly Umbrian, being the joint record of Herti King of Umbria and one of the Arretian Cilnii of their endeavour to suppress a rebellion of the colonies of both States. The Umbrian Tables are in Roman
characters, and their language is archaic Irish, which it is a mystery that no one discovered before this time. There is also a book written by one Inghirami purporting to contain fac- similes of Etruscan documents, and a Latin commentary, which he found on
his father's estate, having been buried there since the time when Etruria fell wholly into the hands of the Romans. The work was regarded as a forgery almost from the beginning, and the commentary has an undoubted flavour of Livy, but, on the other hand, there are indications, taken in connection with the recent discovery through the Hittite hieroglyphics of the values of the Etruscan characters, that nobody in Inghirami's time possessed the knowledge necessary to forge such a work. A complete re-examination of the book and an indication of what is genuine in it may soon be looked for. Till that appears, it is premature to
make any use of its contents. In Spain a few small inscriptions called Celt Iberian have been found belonging to the period of Roman occupation under Scipio, and a large number of coins
** Texier, Asie Mineure ; Fellows, Lycia.



302 THE HITTITES.
inscribed with Celt Iberian characters.^ Many similar coins have been found in the south of France, testifying to the high civilization of the Iberic states along the Mediterranean. The Celt Iberian characters differ little from tlie Etruscan, and are very
like those on Parthian coins. Inscriptions exist, or have existed, in the Canary Islands, but these the writer has not had opportunity to examine. In Britain several runic inscriptions have come to light, which, until recently, have been attributed to invading Norsemen. Those that have been best studied are the monumental records of the Isle of Man, which, in ancient days, was a great centre of education.^" The letters are more elongated and rune-like than the Etruscan and Celt Iberian, but belong to the same series, and yield formulas and proper names thoroughly Hittite. Their age cannot be determined with any degree of
certainty, owing to the chaotic state of the British, Scottish and Irish history in the light of which they should be read, but some of them seem to antedate the Christian era.^' It is very probable that many of the runic inscriptions of Europe, which have been translated only to prove them historically worthless by the Norse
staff, are not Norse but Hittite, and that important historical discoveries may yet be made by means of them. Even the famous Kingiktorsoak stone from Greenland may be found to honour the Hittite rather than his Norse masters.^^ There is, at any rate, abundant evidence that the Teuton and Scandinavian adopted the Hittite characters, and that these formed the basis of all northern alphabets other than the Roman and the Greek. Some writers maintain that America was peopled in part from the west of Europe. For this so far there is no evidence, but the determination of the Greenland stone as a Hittite monument would
do much to prove the possibility, even the likelihood, of such a
colonization. Of European Hittites retaining their ancient speech the Basques form one division, and the Ugrians the other. The
Akkadian cuneiform inscriptions have been read by the aid of the Ugrian (Finn, Lapp, Mordvin, Vogul, Majyar), but the purely

Hittite inscriptions are most easily rendered through the Basque. The tribes of the Caucasus have preserved this Basque Hittite fairly well, with the exception of the aryanized Ossetes. The Albanians of Illyria have only retained enough of the old tongue to shew that the Hittite was once in the land they occupy. All other European Hittites have been linguistically submerged.

CHAPTER XXI.
The Eastern Migration in Asia.
Cyrus created a Persian empire Aryan in character, but in which there was not a single Aryan province. Its name was derived from the Pereshites, Parsi, or Parisii, a brancli of the Celtic Zimri or Cymri, and its constituents were Celtic and Hittite, with a large unhistorical Semitic substratum. By the time that Persian domination came to an end with the conquests of Alexander of Macedon, the Persian language and institutions had been carried from Asia Minor to Bokhara, but the people had not been unified. Alexander came and went ; the Seleucidae followed him as lords over the former empire of the Persians ; and then, in the middle of the third century B.C., and in the reign of the degenerate Antiochus Theos, a double rent took place, and the Bactrian and Parthian kingdoms came into existence. The first of these was Hellenic in character, although the people over vyhom its Diodoti ruled were Bakhdhi, Pukudu, or Pactyan Hittites. Till about eighty years before Christ the Greek rulers
struggled in the east, and then the Hittites swept them away. But the Parthian kingdom had nothing to do with the Greeks. The Bharatan race, that had contended for the throne of Egypt and given it three Osortasens and the vice-regal Hadar and Shimon, that had placed Hadad and Saul and Hadar on the throne of Gebalene, that had reigned with Ismidagan in Babylonia, and with Chushan Rishathaim in Mesopotamia, and whose Hadadezers had lorded it over Zobah and Damascus down to the time when the second Tiglath Pileser began to destroy the Hittite kingdoms,
reasserted itself after five centuries of obscurity. The Hijttite was not dead*, nor was he aryanized sufficiently to hinder his being influenced by the traditions of the past. The Parthians were the most numerous and warlike of the Hittite tribes of Persia, but they were not the only revolters against Antiochus. The Dahae, Mardi, and Tochari, with many others, made common cause, and



THE EASTKRN MIGRATION IN ASIA. 305
the leader of revolt was not even a Parthian but a Rassite bearing the ancestral name of Arsaces, like the Arish under whose name the Shah Nameh represents Ma Reshah. The next king was Teridates, an inverted Hadadezer, but in honour of his predecessor he kept up the Arsacid name. The Maspii or Mesabatae must have fallen into the league, for Mithridates, whose name is compounded with that of Matred the daughter of Mezahab, was the sixth of the Arsacidae. The Rassites appear again in Artabanus, the house of Ras ; after whom many Hittite monarchs sat upon the Parthian throne and ruled from Asia Minor to India till the year 226 A.D., when Artaxerxes the son of Sassan rose in revolt and made Persia once more an Aryan empire. The Parthians, therefore, were the last upholders of Hittite sovereignty in the west. From what we know of the character of their monarchy there is no reason to lament its fall. It was built up on the old
state system, its ruler being, like those of ancient Hittite days, a king of kings ; and the marvel is that with such a constitution it should have maintained itself for nearly five centuries. The overthrow of the Parthian empire must have set loose upon Asia and afterwards upon Europe those bands of roving warriors known as Alans and Avars and Huns, Lombards, Heruli and Vandals, the descendants of the Temenite Elon, the Zerethite Heber, and the Zocharite Jephunneh, of the Ethnanite Leophrah, the Achuzamite Aharhel, and the Temenite once more in the line of Bozrah. More quietly, the Moschi and Ras passed into Sarmatia and imposed their names of Muscovite and Russian, while horde after horde dashed itself like succeeding waves of the sea against the rising power of the Brahman in India, and, breaking, overflowed into the northern regions of Asia. Long before Alexander visited India as a conqueror the
Hittite and Brahman had found that land of gold. It has been shewn how, back in Median days, the strife of the Aryan organizers of new nationalities led to emigration from the Persian empire. It is not likely that those who then passed into India were the first colonists of that country. Cushite and Shemite had doubtless found refuge there long ages before, but kingly rule and historic empire only began when the Hittite and his Japhetic companions made it their home. There is no trustworthy

306 THE HITTITES.
history of India, for the Raja Tarangini, full as it is of genuine historical matter, is as untrustworthy as regards its arrangement as Geoffrey's History of England or the Psalter of Cashel. There are other works that contain historical information, such as the
two great epics so often alluded to, and the Puranas, but they deal with ancient things, and with events that did not happen on Indian soil. Valuable for the history of the race, they tell nothing of the history of Hindustan. Monuments there are in India, inscribed with strange characters shewing analogy to those
of Parthia, Asia Minor, and Etruria, but of a more ancient type than any of these. Ignorance of their Hittite origin has caused
them to be regarded as ancient forms of the Devanagari letters, which probably they are, and to be read with similar values, the result being a language that is neither Sanscrit, Pali, nor anything
else, but, like the so-called Pelasgic tongue of the Eugubine
Tables, whatever the decipherer chooses to make it. It is no
wonder that these inscriptions afford no historical information, nor that, when they seem to do so, they teem with absurdities
and contradictions, necessarily arising out of readings which, though false, have the merit of consistency. The work of
deciphering these inscriptions as Hittite has only been begun, so that sufficient material for rewriting the history of India has yet to be procured. The kings who have left the inscriptions frequently call themselves kings of the Kita. Others are kings
of the Saki or Shuchites, of Siberia, of the Tsutemames, Indian Zuzims or Chichimecs, of Aramaka, of Tsutaruki, which recalls the Elamite Sutruks, of Futa, of Mekisa, of Marwar and Bushiyama. The oldest inscription deciphered is 140 years later than the nirvana of Buddha or 403 B.C. It simply states that the Kita chose Nebutaki for their king.' Twenty years later Tsumaki of the Sakis proclaims his accession to the throne ; and,
twenty years after that, Kabutaku declares that in his person the Andataka line was superseded by that of the Sakis. There are
several inscriptions relating to the Guptas who reigned over the Tsutarukis. It is vain, however, to attempt at present to give a
history of the Hittites in India.
1 These translations have not yet been published, but the values of many of the Lat characters are set forth in Btruria Capta.



THE EASTERN MIGRATION IN ASIA. 307
If Gautama Buddha really lived, as all traditions assert, in
India, and attained nirvana, or, in other words, died in 543, B.C., at the age of eighty, it is evident that there must have been a Hittite kingdom of Saki or Shuchite origin in that country as early as the end of the seventh century B.C., or about the time when the Assyrian empire fell before Nebuchadnezzar and
Cyaxares. This is not unlikely, for the Shuchites, to whose line Ma Reshah belonged, were a warlike people, tne determined enemies of the Egyptians who called them the Shasu, and of the Assyrian monarchs whose early records are full of contests with and victories over the Sukhi. Once driven out of Assyria and Babylonia, their wanderings eastward became continuous, for no track intermediate between the Tigris and the Indus appears to have borne their name. They and the Massagetae are always spoken of as the most eastern of the Scyths.^ Ancient as they were, for Gautama was of their race, they were posterior to another tribe or family called Andataka, to which probably Nebutaki belonged, seeing that he was twenty years before the Sakis in Mathura. This Nebutaki speaks of himself as the choice of the Kita, which may mark him as a member of the leading or Achuzamite family. After its expulsion from Carchemish the chief Achuzamite line held sway in Hyrcania, and subsequently in Chorasmia, so that its lineal descendant, the kingdom of Oude with a capital Lucknow, must have been more recent, unless we suppose, what is not improbable, that the royal Hittite family,
tired of the Japhetic rule of Sagaras and Pisiris, betook itself to
the Ganges there to exercise independent authority. Probably the oldest kingdom in India was that of Magadha, which seems to have been Bahar to the east of Oude and south of Nepal. There can be no universal emperor say the Hindus but jn Magadha which is the chief of the kingdoms.^ In its old capital Rajagriha, to the south and a little to the east of Patna, are the remains of the Jarasandh ka Baithak or throne of Jarasandha. On that throne in the time of Buddha reigned Bimsara or Vimbasara and his son Ajasat or Asoka, according to the Buddhist traditions. The religious reformer, however, who

308 THE HITTITES.
became the first Buddhist king, and set up inscriptions in the old Hittite character called the Lat Indian, terms himself Tsurama, and indicates that Asoka was his religious name. It is likely that Asoka is the Japanese yasiingi, to preserve peace. He and Gorami, who may have been his brother reigned 240 years after Buddha, and belonged to the line of Tsumeki which commenced 160 years after the death of the Indian sage. No reliance, therefore, can be placed upon the statements of the Buddhist histories. The Indians anticipated by many centuries
the falsehood of some modern philosophies, which has given rise to all sorts of mythic theories, that the idea is everything and the
fact of no importance. The original kingdom of Magadha was one that had been transferred from Megiddo on the Kishon in Palestine to Maachah north-east of Lake Merom, thence to a Massagetic region in northern Affghanistan, and finally to the banks of the Ganges. Here then we find the Massagetae with the Sacae. The Kenite genealogy makes Pelet son of Jachdai the founder of this kingdom which bore the name of his son Maachah; the sons of Maachah given are Sheber, Tirhanah, Shaaph, and Sheva ; and from the two latter came Madmannah and Machbenah. There is a puzzling statement of the Kenite scribe or his
interpreter to the effect that Maachah was the father of Abi Gibeah, or that Sheva was, or that Sheva, besides being the father of Machbenah, was also the father of Gibeah or Gibegah. This Gibeah is the same as Gibeon whose wife was Maachah, and from whom the family of Saul was derived.* Tsumeki, the ancestor of Tsurama or Asoka, calls himself a Saki. He must, therefore, have dethroned the rightful kings of Magadha, who, taking the name of Sheber the eldest born of Maachah, called themselves kings of Sibir and Kita. Such an one was Pala Humara the son of Hoshrori : his descendants named Siberia. Returning to Tsumeki, he is the Susunago of the Mahavansa or History of Ceylon, the only ancient history, besides the Raja Tarangini, that India possesses.^ He is said to have headed his dynasty seventy-two years after Buddha, which is eighty-eight years too early. But between him and Asoka the usurping
* 1 Chron. ii. 49 ; comp, viii. 29. This complicates the genealogy of Saul. * Mahavansa, Introd, xlvii. ^



THE EASTERN MIGRATION IN ASIA. 309
Nandas are placed, and these may be the Andataki kings of the inscriptions, who for a time displaced the Sakis, as the Sakis had displaced the true Magadhas. The Mahavansa, however, places Asoka 224 years after Buddha, which differs by nineteen only from the statement of his inscriptions. The Vishnu Purana makes the kings of Magadha begin with Pradyota, who is the
ancestral Pelet from the borders of Egypt and Palestine, in 2100 B.C. Then after 138 years came the Sisunagas for 360, the Nandas for 100, and the Mauryas for 137.^ As the first of these MauryEis is Chandragupta, and the third Asoka, the chronological value of this history is evident. In a somewhat mutilated inscription from Mathura in Agra, Tsurama calls himself the lord of the world and king of Tsutemame, Futatami, Marwar, and Bushiyama, dating his document 240 years after Buddha.'^ Here then is a Hittite monarch whose sway extended over the greater part of northern India, from beyond Patna in the east to the Indus on the west, and if o43 B.C. be Buddha's true date, contemporary with Seleucus Nicator. The Indian king whom the Greek writers place in the time of Seleucus is Sandracottus who reigned in Palibothra. In defiance of Ptolemy's measurements, which set Palibothra much farther west, it has been regarded as an ancient Patna. Moreover Sandrabates, which as a tribal name may be supposed to connect with a Sandracottus, is placed above Methora or Mathura and thus to the west of the Jumna. Alexander the Great did not advance farther than the extremity of the Punjab, so that he had no opportunity of meeting Tsurama's predecessor. That predecessor is called Fune on the monuments, one of his dates being 242 after Buddha, so that Tsurama, Gorami, and he, must have been contemporaries.^ General Cunningham mentions this king,
calling him Wem or Wen, which are renderings of Yun in Yunkao-ching, the name given by the Chinese to the great Scythic
• Vishnu Purana. f All the inscriptions here given are from vol. iii. of the Archaeological Survey of India or from a paper by Professor Dowson in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, New Series, vol. v.

India, vol. iii. Plate xv. No. 18.



310 THE HITTITES.
conqueror of India who extended his empire far into the east and the south.^ The Chinese historians say that the king of Sogdiana in the beginning of the seventh century A.D. traced his descent from Shaovu Wen of the Yuechi horde, as did ten other
princes. His coins also have been found in large numbers
inscribed in Greek characters OOHMO or Wemo. This Wen or Fune calls himself a descendant of Tsumeki, but Gorami who claims to follow Fune, says that that monarch was the son of Varma and the grandson of Kufuri.^" Now the Raja Tarangini makes the wise king Avanti-Varma the son of Sukha Varma, and the grandson of Utpala.^^ Neither Utpala nor his son Sukha Varma actually reigned in Ceishmere, although they, as regents, exercised almost absolute authority, but Avanti was raised to the throne. Yet the Raja Tarangini mentions neither Tsurama nor Tchandragupta or Sandracottus. Several inscriptions mention a line of kings called Tsutaruki or Sutruk, which the Greek would naturally change to Sandruk as he changed Zoheth to Sundes and Gedor to Centaur and Gandar. In an imperfect inscription from Mathura the line of the Tsutaruk kings is given.^'^ Fune or Wen is mentioned among them as a recanting king, which must mean that he recanted his idolatry and became a Buddhist, for this, and another inscription also from Mathura, state that Fune's father Viripa, which must be a surname of Varma, and his son Watsureba, a surname of Gorami,
were idolators.^^ The first inscription is of late date, for it ends with the statement that Vicram broke in pieces the authority of the Varmas over the Kitan. There is a dated inscription of Vicram, the Vicramaditya of history, in which he states that he ruled in the city of Mathura, that he called his people to exter
minate the Tsutaka Sakis, and to serve his heir Yofumi in the 480th year after Buddha, that is to say in the year 63 B.C.^* The Tsutaruki inscription calls Yofumi by the name Gupta, as Yofumi Gupta, and places him 226 years after the great chief

Tsutaru, which would set Tsutaru 289 years before Christ and make him posterior to Tsurama.^^ The Varmas were apparently usurpers over the Tsutarukis, while the Guptas were their law
ful kings. An inscription of Ta,kadova Gupta states that he was king of the Tsutarukis and successor of Yofumi Gupta.^^ A synchronism is vainly sought for in the son of Gorami named Varma Bikko or the lame. He was not king, his authority coming through his consort Sena, the daughter of Basara or Bagsara of Futa, so that he was gonwari or regent for their son Parta. No dated monument of Bikko or of Parta has been read so far, but as Gorami, the father of the first and grandfather of the second, was contemporary with Tsurama about 300, B.C., their history must lie within the third pre-Christian century. The Raja Tarangini places Nirjita-Varma or Pangu, the lame, and his son Partha in the year 908, A.D. Japanese history reduces this somewhat, making Bourets, who is the same Parta or Partha, ascend the throne in 499 A.D.^^ The agreement between the tales of infamous cruelty told of these monarchs in the Indian and Japanese histories has already been referred to. From the
few inscriptions available, it appears that Parta, son of Varma
Bikko and Sena, called himself king of Futa, which was the kingdom of his maternal grandfather Basara or Bagsara, a claim which was contested by Bagori, probably a son of Bagsara. An inscription from Sravasti says that Parta treacherously attacked the peaceful Bagori king of Futa, whereupon Rataha Yarma who seems at that time to have been the Indian suzerain, sent his generals Kumiri and Metori against Parta and his father. A second Sravasti inscription says: "Rataha, the powerful king: Kumiri and Metori conquered Varma Bikko the father of Parta. "^^ The first inscription from Sravasti reads, " Metori appoints Satakwata : having treacherously attacked Bagori the peaceful
ruler of Futa, as an ofi'set to this victory the rule over the Tsutaruki is taken from Parta." The Japanese history mentions Matori as one who had governed the empire before the time of Bourets, and who after his accession rebelled but was conquered

and put to death. The Raja Tarangini makes no mention of Metori in connection with Partha and his father, but places him, under the name Matri Gupta, in the year 118, A.D., as the lieutenant of the universal monarch Harcha or Vicramaditya over Cashmere to succeed the brothers Hiranya and Toramana. Harcha himself is said to have held his court at Ujein in Malwa, but it is hard to reconcile him with Rataha or Artaha Varma. A long but defective inscription of Rataha Varma says that he took Pala
Humara, the king of Sibir and Kita, prisoner, and describes Rataha himself as the king of the Tsutemame or Achuzamites. It also mentions the death in his time of Sagara king of Aramaka, and refers to Cashmere, but p. break in the inscription makes it impossible to say in what connection. Its date seems to be 312 after Buddha or 231 E.G'" The conquest of Sibir and Kita was made in retaliation for the act of Hoshrori,'king of these regions or peoples, who had, as we learn from another inscription, conquered the Tsutemame. Hoshrori was the father of Pala
Humara.^ Rataha called himself king of Sibir after his conquest, for a third Sravasti inscription reads : " Sataswata saluting Rataha, desires to inform him of the death of Saiakara the father of his servant : Sataswata, the successor ot Satakara of Aramaka, the subject of the father king of Sibir." Sataswata is not the same person as Satakwata, whom Metori placed over Futa instead of Parta, for a Mathura inscription makes the latter the son of Kumiri the companion in arms of Metori.^^
These excerpta from the inscriptions suffice to indicate that Hittite monarchy began in India in the seventh century before Christ, and that, down to the Christian era when the Guptas were reigning, the monarchy was still Hittite. An inscription of Rataha Varma's makes an enigmatic statement regarding the relation between the cycle or era of the Saki and the age of Buddha, causing them to differ by 61 years. Grammatically it reads " the age of Gautama is 61 years more than the era of the Saki," but as Gautama was himself a Sakya or Saki, these 61 years should rather be added to his 543 and make the Saki rule begin in

604, B C.^'- The Sakis were plainly usurpers on the throne of Magadha, which, equally with that of Oude and of Sangala of the Cathaei in the Punjab, pertained to the Achuzamites, who in the inscriptions are called Tsutemames and made the chief people of northern India. The Egyptians had called them Hyksos and Gagama, the Israelites, Zuzim and Zamzummim, and the Assyrians, Gamgumi. In Mexico they became the Chichi mecs, and are now represented by the Shoshones of the Rocky Mountains. Their Japanese name was Tsuchigumi or earth-spiders, and they are set forth in history as enemies of the early monarchs of Japan.2^ The Sakis, whose royal line was that of the Varmas, called themselves kings of the Tsutemames, and fought against the kings of Sibir and Kita, whose name Sibir declares that they were the rightful lords of Magadha. Having conquered these, the Saki kings reigned over northern India till the time of Vicram or Vicramaditya in the first century B.C. He brought the Saki and Variria rule to an end, and established that of the Guptas.
The Gupta line is one that presents difficulties. In itself the word Gupta at once recalls the Persian Kobad, the Cappadocian name, and Jabez or Igabets the original term from which they were derived. The Etruscan Kupido, a masculine proper name occurring on many monuments,and that of a god impropetly represented by the Latin Cupid, is the same. Madhava Gupta and Matri Gupta are names that explain themselves by Mezahab and Matred, who belonged to the family of Jabez. But the inscriptions
agree with history in making the head of the Gupta line in India a certain Tsutaru or Tchandra, who is also the chief of a people called Tsutaruki. Some Susian texts contain the name Sutruk or Sutruk-Nakhunte, son of Halludus and king of the Susians in the time of the Assyrian Sargon. His son was Kudur-Nakhunte who worshipped Lagamar or Laomer, so that the name Sutruk appears to belong to the Hepherites of Beth Lechem.^* No ancient
alliance makes plain the association of the words Tsutaruki and Gu|)ta. Sandracottus or Tchandra Gupta was the contemporary of Seleucus Nicator. The date 289 B.C., which is given in the

314 THE HITTITES.
inscription containing a list of the Tsutarukis, must, therefore,
refer to the year of his death, for Seleucus died 280 B.C., and his contest with Sandracottus was in 310. The mysterious Tsurama also called Asoka may have been contemporary with Sandracottus, although his inscriptions contain the dates 303 and 300 B.C. It is unlikely that two great kings ruled at the same time in northern India, and monumental evidence shews that the Guptas became vassals of the Saki Varmas and remained such till the time of Vicram; while it also declares that Tsurama ruled from Magadha to the Indus and, therefore, over the kingdom of Sandracottus, which lay about the Jumna and other western tributaries of the Ganges. The information furnished by the Greek historians concerning India is scanty in the extreme. The recorders of Alexander's expedition make Taxila the first city of any note which he encountered.-^ This oriental Thessaly was an outpost of the
Zocharites or Tochari, indicating that they were late arrivals in
India. While in the friendly Taxila, an embassy from the Abissares or Abiezrites, who dwelt in Abhisara, which the Raja Tarangini places south of Cashmere, visited the conqueror and tendered the submission of that people. But Porus, king of an unnamed country Ij'ing about the Hydaspes or Jhelum, opposed the progress of the Greek, and was overthrown. It is there that Ptolemy places the Caspiri and the Indian writers, the Sauviras. This, therefore, must have been the region of Sibir and Kita, over which Pala or Para Humara afterwards ruled, and the Porus of Alexander shows that Para was a hereditary title. The Palas or Paras retook Magadha, their ancient home, long afterwards in the Christian centuries. Between the Hydraotes and the Hyphasis, or the Ravi and the Beas, the Cathaei of Sangala made a stand, and with them the Oxydracae and the Malli. The first named were Hittites under the Japhetic sway of the Gekers who had a city of their own in the north-west called Peucela or Abichail. The Malli were perhaps the Mahalaites related to the Abiezrites or Abissares ; and the Oxydracae seem to be the same as the mysterious Tsutaruki or Sutruks. Alexander took Sangala, and afterwards followed up the Oxydracae and Malli, but did not

extend his conquests beyond the Punjab although he had heard of powerful monarchs in the east. Justin says that he was about to proceed against the Cuphites, probably the Guptas, when his army, tired of marching and fighting, declined to go any farther.'^"
Other authorities state that the Indians reported the existence of a great kingdom on the Ganges beyond a desert of twelve days' journey, which could send to the field two thousand war chariots, four thousand armed elephants, twenty thousand cavalry, and two hundred thousand infantry, the king of which is variously called Xambranes and Agrarames.^^ The latter name would suit Tsurama. While Megasthenes resided at the court of Sandracottus as the ambassador of Seleucus, there obtaining the information which the Greeks possessed concerning India,theking of Palibothra told him that if Alexander had pushed on to the Ganges he would probably have defeated Agrammes, who was a barber's son indebted to his good looks for his union with the reigning queen, whom after his marriage he basely put to death, on account of
which and other acts of tyranical cruelty, his army was in a state
of general disaflfection. The barber part of the story is told against Sandracottus or Tchandragupta himself by Indian writers. Their account is that the last of the Nanda kings had by his legitimate wife Ratnavati nine sons, Nandas like himself, and, by a Sudra woman called Mura, Chandra Gupta and his brothers. The latter were called Mauryas after their mother : but a Maurya is the son of a barber and a female slave. After his father's death Chandra Gupta contended with his half-brothers, the Nandas, and received assistance from a Brahman named Janakya or Kutalya, who longed to requite the Nandas for an insult of which they had been guilty towards him. The Brahman overthrew the Nandas, and placed Chandra Gupta on the vacant throne. That the lazy Brahmans were in India at the time of Alexander and Seleucus is witnessed by Megasthenes, who tells how these revered sophists exercised priestly functions and walked among the people in naked dignity, free from all obligations, living gratuitously on the fat of the laud. Janakya seems to be the same person as Sisunaga or Susunago, and the

Tsumeki of the inscriptions. After Megasthenes, another envoy was sent to Allitroehidas the son of Sandracotttis, named Diainachus, and then nothing more is heard of India till the time of Antiochus the Great, who made peace with king Sophagasenus about the year 210 B.C. The other Hittite kingdoms mentioned in the inscriptions are those of Futa, Aramaka, Marwar, Mathura, Bushiyania, and Makisa. Most of these countries, perhaps all of them, were under the sway of Tsurama, and afterwards of Rataha Varma, but Vicram is the first to call himself king of Mathura. The
name of Mathura is very old, for it denotes a city occupied for a time by Krishna, who was driven out of it and compelled to take refuge in Dwaraca.^'* The only ancient name that answers to
Mathura is Hamath Dor. In the classical scheme of geography, Methora on the Jomanes lay to the north of Agra also called Adis-dara ; to the south of it flowed the river Samtus, and below
it dwelt the Mathae. These seem to be oriental Hamathites, whose name is given in Samtus, Mathae, and Methora, while Agra sets forth Ezer, and Adisdara, the Rechabite Hadadezer. The Bharatas were the great Indian race, so honoured by the Hindus that they call the whole of their.country Bharata Varsha; nevertheless the Bharatan name does not appear in any of the incriptions read. Parta or Pharta, however, was the grandson of a king of Futa, where dwelt the Futamame or Futa people, and himself assumed sovereignty in that country. The Vindhya mountains to the north of which Ozene, the present Oojein, is placed in the country of the Mathae, bears the Futa or Pandu name first borne by Bedad the father of Hadad. Oojein itself is probably a memorial' of Achian the son of Shemidag or Ismidagan, the last Beerothite monarch mentioned in the Kenite list. Vicramaditya reigned in that city, and the Palibothrian region connected with Sandracottus and the Guptas was somewhere between it and Mathura. Bushiyama is harder to locate. It should stand in intimate relation with Futa and Mathura, as these contained the people with whom Japanese ancient history deals, and as Bushiyama appears in Japan as Fusi no yama, the highest of its mountains. It is a great pyramid in the island of
28 Mahabharata.



THE EASTERN MIGRATION IN ASIA. J^l7
Niphon on the borders of the provinces of Suruga and Kai, the summit of which is covered with perpetual snow, and which is at the same time the most active of the Japanese volcanoes. In India Bushiyama was probably a Himalayan country. The word yama means a mountain, and the very names Imaus and Emodi, by which the Himalayas were known to the Greeks, were forms of Yama and Yamato, the mountain and the mountain door. The name Bushi probably appears in Becius, the Greek name of a range in the north* of Gedrosia, named by the Hamathite Gedors in eastward migration. Marwar still retains its name, being part of Ajmere. It is inhabited by the Rathore Mahrattas, the Budras of Sanscrit mythology, and the lineal descendants of the British Arthur or Jered the father of Gedor. They regard themselves as the descendants of the Persian Nushirvan or Nauzer, who is no doubt their ancestor Ezer. The rajah of the connected Meywar has the keshkeh or symbol of royalty drawn on his forehead with human blood, a practice repugnant to the Hindu and
characteristic of the Hittite. Mekisa the kingdom of Gorami cannot yet be determined. Aramaka was under Satakara and Sataswata, names that belong to the Andhra kings of India, among whom appear Satakarni and Skandhaswati.^^ Pliny mentions a powerful nation of the Andarae upon the Ganges. The Andhras became the rulers of Magadha shortly before the Christian era. Krishna is said to have been the second king of the Andhra line ; and Sakrisma occurs in an inscription of Rataha as a king of Aramaka.^*^ Now the kingdom of Oude has not
appeared in the inscriptions, which is hardly consistent with its fame in Indian story. Rama was its great hero, and he has been identified with Harum the son of Reofem, who as Lokman or Lakshman is the eponym of Lucknow, and at the same time the ancient Krishna. Ramnagur opposite Benares,andmanyneighbouring places similarly named, suggest that Oude, stretched somewhat beyond its present proportions, was the ancient Arama of the
Aramaka or Aramak, thus representing «the senior line of the Tsutemames or Zuzim. From the time of Tsurama, and even prior to it, since Fune or

Wen is represented as having professed a faith which his father and son alike abjured, Buddhism began to contend with Brahmanism. Although there is no reason to call in question the existence of prince Sidhartta son of Sudho-dana king of Kapila and his queen Mahamaya, who gave up rank and fortune to become the apostle of peace and self-abnegation early in the sixth century before Christ, it has been shown that he preached no new doctrine, but the same that descended to Pythagoras in the western world from Paseach the son of Eshton, an ancient Sudhodana, and the Pthah Soccari of the Egyptians. Sidhartta if a Sakya was not indeed of the same family as Paseach, the Buddha Sukra of the east, for the Sakyas belong to Achashtari's Shuhite horn, and Paseach to the Chelubite, but he was like him a Kshattriya, the member of a caste scarcely less honourable than that of the Brahmans, and whose one occupation was war. The traditions of ancient days, when Pthah of the handsome face, as
the Egyptians called him, and his son, the princely Job of Uz, followed in later days by the Beerothite Saul of Rehoboth, went forth among the Hittite tribes proclaiming human brotherhood and putting down with a strong hand the bloody sacrifices that
defiled the altars of the ancestral gods, were still fresh in the memories of the descendants of those who had sympathized with their lofty mission. The memory of these reformers came to Sidhartta while reflecting upon the uncertainty of earthly
prosperity, and the reality of old age, disease, and death. He did not pretend to be original, but allowed that there had been Buddhas before his day, far back in the past, and that he was going to walk in their steps. He did more than this, for he had before his eyes the Brahman priest, proud as Lucifer in his stoicism, ready at any time to curse and destroy, but priding himself most on his external shew of humility, and acting the mendicant while the treasures of the world were at his feet. He would out-Brahman the Brahman, and change a crown for an almsbowl, and live in all cleanliness and decency such a life as
would shew men how to mortify the flesh and renounce the world. The act of self-denial is always respectable, even when it is quixotic and productive of no results. With Sidhartta the result was the attainment of merit, whereby he would raise himself



THE EASTERN MIGRATION IN ASIA. 319
above the sphere of humanity and become divine. Brahmanism, which was at first mere pagan idolatry, the worship of many Hittite, a few Horite Egyptian, and some Japhetic Jerahmeelite ancestors, who had been men of .power, in anpient days when the world was young, for good or evil, taught Sidhartta the doctrine which their historical theology plainly declared, that many men
of the past were the gods of the present. The Brahman also taught that his own person was divine with its own inherent holiness as god-descended, and through the practice of the
ostentatious virtues in which he delighted. The young prince had come somehow to the heretical conclusion that a Kshattriya was as good as a Brahman, How could he help it; were not full
three -fourths of the Brahman deities Hittites like himself, and who among the Hittites was greater than the Kshattriya ? Out of such reasonings and questionings arose the Buddhist theology, which is virtually a declaration that there is no theology, because there are no gods ; such gods as there are any man may become by the practice of virtue. It is a strange thing that the morality, the humanity, the self-devotion of the former Buddhas were so well remembered, while all forgotten was the great God of Job, and the Lord of Heaven to whom Saul of Rehoboth lifted his heart and hands. The purest morality next to that of the Bible is that of Buddha's code, spite of its absurd enactments regarding
all sorts of life, and not unlike it is that of the Golden Verses of the Pythagoreans. It is no disparagement of the men who could
appreciate such systems to tell the truth, and say that they came down from distant ages. We may laugh at the sanctity of the lives of animalculae, at the transmigration of souls,
and other absurdities ; may reprove the virtue of refined selflove which dwelt in hearts that never went out of themselves, but ever checked new additions to the pile of merit as a clerk, with book in hand, might note the goods that come in to fill his shelves ; we may shudder at the thought of a universe in which men only reign, call them Buddhas, or Pase Buddhas, or whatever else you please ; but when we see all India at war, men, like demons, burning, ravaging, destroying, enslaving, cutting each other's throats, and priding themselves on the pyramids of skulls before their doors and the bunches of scalps dangling by

their sides, we may thank God for Gautama Buddha. As the apostle of peace, young Sidhartta was Paseach and Job and Saul repeated after a thousand years, and takes rank as one of the world's great reformers.
The Hittite elements of India's population were favourable to the revival of the ancient systems, being largely Achuzamite, Hepherite, and Achaahtarite. There were, however, hostile elements among them, but these were of small account compared with the hostility of the Brahman. Wherever Buddhism was preached and the people entered the path of merit, the Brahman's occupation was gone, with his sanctity and his living. It was an appalling thought to the Brahman that he would have to work for his daily bread, that his lifelong holiday masquerading was
coming to an end. He had been so long the real lord of the simple-minded and superstitious Hittites that he could not
realize their dispensing with his valuable services ; yet here was a prince of the warrior caste of the Kshattriyas calling upon his countrymen to end the solemn farce which they and the Brahmans had acted for ages together. From Cashmere to Gujerat,and from the Indus to the Brahmaputra, they spread the
message to resist Buddhism to the death. But in spite of their opposition the new doctrines found their way among the Sakis. The oldest inscription translated, that of Nebutaki, 140 years
after Buddha or 403 B.C., by the very mention of the sage's name shows that this king had adopted the creed of peace. Twenty years later Tsumeki of the Sakis tells the same story, as does Kabutaku after another period of the same duration. Tsutaru was apparently a Buddhist, but Viripa obeyed the Brahmans and set up the old gods. His son Fune or Wen came back into the Buddhist fold, but Watsureba, his successor apostatized like his grandfather, and bitter were the wails of
the Buddhist priests, now grown as idle and worthless as their
Brahman predecessors and antagonists, over these defections, that lost them many valuable gifts. Then it was that Tsurama, king of Magadha, a parricide, a great warrior who had subdued the whole of northern India, caring little apparently for Alexander or Seleucus, repented of his evil deeds, became a patron of Buddhism and changed his name to Yasuka or Asoka,



THE EASTERN MIGRATION IN ASIA. 321
the giver of peace. He set up inscriptions all over the land, of one of which the following is a tentative translation.^ " Hear, I pray, the desire of the mighty Asoka ; pardon do ye
accept. See, violence has divided the kingdom, the violence of
strength ; within cease law and justice ; alike are lord
and king. Leave the assembly of the doers of violence ; avoid the com
pany of the measurers of strength. Hear, I pray, the desire of the new king named Asoka the mighty : to you pardon is ofFered.^^ The violent years are ended : let the unhappy years end now, let them end forever.
The violent years, the violent years, blushing I despise
them ; let there be years of pleasantness.
The violent years, O the violent years, blushing I despise let pleasant years and years of peace remain. As the house lord hearing the housebreaker guards the door so do ye lock Buddha's gate.
Do I pray what the amnesty defines. Hear the desire of the great Asoka of which the writing gives information. Cease to imitate the wicked customs of the unrighteous. Take to yourselves individually the confession which the writing has given.
Do not deliberate (procrastinate) I pray : accept pardon beforehand.
Let all repentant ones accept universal pardon freely.
' Obey the amiable lord : I pray you listen to the desire of the mighty Asoka. See that ye leave the false gods ; for pardon, I pray you, obey the wish of the great Asoka.
Leave the seductive rites of evil, despise their secret sports. He who quits the army of the powerful will obtain protection from him who is the lord.

322 THE HITTITES.
Hear ye who delight in delusive lust, and give up the sweet rites of wickedness, O, do ye forsake these evil rites : Tsurami, the rightful owner
of the kingdom of the Sakis." This inscription makes it plain that Tsurama or Tsurami was
in earnest on behalf of peace, purity, and humanity. Sidhartta's
teaching bore fruit at last after 240 years, and very lovely fruit, had there only been a God behind this blessed gospel of free pardon to every blood stained-wretch and degraded votary of
worse than bestial divinities. The gods had not changed, for Mexico with its human holocausts is yet to come. The iniquity
of Canaan was filled up. Now India's cup is brimming over. Honour to the royal warrior who, repenting his own evil deeds,
and seeking the better life, stems the tide of iniquity, giving to his wide-spread subjects the Buddhist gospel, since he has not
the Christian to bestow. From the time of Tsurama Buddhism became the religion of all northern India, and found its way into Thibet, China, and distant Ceylon. According to Japanese history, it was introduced into Japan about 550 A.D., in the reign of Kinmei, but this is a mistake, for the Japanese were in India and received the new creed before the reign of their king Bourets, the Parta of the monuments and the Partha of the Raja Tarangini.^^ The struggles of Buddishm with Sintoism or pagan idolatry form important chapters of Japanese history for comparison with that of Hittite India. The kings of Saurashtra or Gujerat are supposed to have begun their reign about 167 B.C. by some writers, by others, a hundred years later. They represent the Zerethite line of Jesher which must have accepted Buddhism, if indeed Buddhism was accepted by it, with a very bad grace. The Zerethites were the earliest Hittites expelled from India, for they
are found in the Loo Choo archipelago, in Mexico as its first royal
line, that of the Toltecs, and in Peru, as the Incas. . Everywhere they appear to have been hostile to Buddhism, as they were in ancient days to the humane creeds of Jabez and Saul of Rehoboth. The Brahmans during these dark days for their creed, took refuge in the south, in Gujerat, and with the Guptas who had no love for
32 Titsingh.



THE EASTERN MIGRATION IN ASIA. 323
Budtlhism as a rule, although some of their petty kings adopted it. The Brahmans also drew together and formed a nationality
of their ovfn, losing their character as priests and a Hittite high caste. War was waged outside of India proper by the Sakis. Uniting with the Parthians in warfare against the Greek Bactrian kingdom, which might have proved a refuge for the Brahmans, and a formidable rival of the Magadhan kingdom, they broke it into fragments in the year 127 B.C. One principality remained in the Hindu Koosh north-west of Cashmere which, in the time of Menander 140 B.C., had extended its sway far into India, Against this the Hittite tribes warred incessantly, and, about the time of Vicramaditya, it came to an end, and the Brahman was isolated from his Japhetic brethren. Meanwhile the Guptas had been nursing their wrath against the Varma dynasty of the Sakis. Vicramaditya or, as he calls himself, Vicram arose in Oojein which
properly belonged to the Futas or Bharatas. He is called a Hindu
or Brahman by the historians of India, but, in his proclamation at Mathura calling for the extermination of the Sakis, he names Yofumi Gupta as his successor or heir. This proclamation is dated the 480th year after Buddha or 63 B.C., at the time when the Parthians were contending with the Armenians and the Romans. The reign of the Sakis came to an end, and for a time
Brahmanism was re-established. It is, therefore, more than likely that the Brahmans aided the Guptas in their revolt, and that the Saki overthrow is to be regarded as a Brahman victory. This victory was of short duration. Vicramaditya is said to have been assassinated, and there is no independent record of the reign of Yofumi Gupta, but two inscriptions of his successor Tokadova Gupta contain an injunction to his people the Tsutarukis to enter the Buddhist path.^^ A period of upheaval now set in, of which no trustworthy particulars have come down. Hittite tribes from beyond the Indus and from the banks of the Oxus and Jaxartes, those that Buddhism had expelled into Tartary, those that had become discontented with Armenian and Parthian rule, descended, now that the strong hand was gone, that union was lost and dissensions had weakened the governments, upon the civilization that had developed during the years of

peace ; and these successive waves of Yuechis, Tokhares, and other so called Scythic tribes, which are mentioned as if they were the only Scyths that India had known, built up new kingdoms on the ruins of the old. The Yuechis, to judge by their coins, seem to have brought with them a degenerate Mithriac cult, such as the Magi had instituted in Media. The American Yuches originally of Georgia claim to be children of the sun ; their most ancient town was Kofita and their name for one of their race is Kawita.^ According to Chinese history the Yuechis or Yuettis were in Cabul a century B.C., and a Chinese emperor concluded a treaty of peace with them.^^ Were they not the ancient Jahdaites, represented in America by the Utes of Utah as well as by the Yuches of Georgia, and thus the genuine Guptas or Jabezites,
seeingf also that their art is identical in character with that of the later Guptas ? The Brahmans, although active, had not succeeded in putting an end to Buddhism. In the end of the fourth century A.D. a Chinese Buddhist monk Fahian visited India, the holy place of his religion. He found almost the whole country Buddhist, with Brahman heretics here and there, who were no longer priests but merchants, writers, seamen, working like other people for their living : there was not a Brahman kingdom in all the land.'^ In Java and the adjoining regions, however, the Brahmans propagated their faith." Two later Chinese pilgrims in the sixth and seventh centuries report the decline of Buddhism and the degeneracy of its priesthood ; yet even in the seventh century the Brahman states were few and small. The monastic system was the cause of the overthrow of the religion of peaceIt reproduced the worst features of ancient Brahmanism, and, spite of the gorgeous ceremonial of the religion, lacked the dignity that attached to the Japhetic recipients of charity. The Brahmans also, having betaken themselves to work, and becoming engaged in the activities of life, forced also as students by the success of Buddhism to remould their creed and create new philosophical systems or revise the old, gained by these means a
hold upon the minds of the intelligent and the respect at least of

those who could not appreciate their teachings, but who could compare them with the stupid owlish creatures that ministered in the Buddhist temples and whose everlasting alms-bowl they knew only too well. They did not trouble themselves with the victories of Buddhism in the past, since the violent years to blush
for were no more, and they did not see from what the religion of Gautama had delivered them. Contented to judge the tree by its present crop, they saw that the fruit was very worthless, and cared not how soon the stem that bore it was cut down. A religious war bejran in the south where the Brahmans were strongest, and spread to the north where the Mahrattas, recalling the glory of their ancestors the Maruts of the Brahman pantheon, took up arms against the men of peace. The strife continued until, in the end of the tenth century, the Mahommedans entered the land, soon after w^hich Indian Buddhism became extinct. The Brahman triumphed in the east as in the west, imposing his
language or dialects of it on many tribes of Hittite origin, driving the remnant, that would not leave the land which their race had held for a thousand years, into the mountain and the jungle, and guarding the passes of the Himalayas against the return of the Hittite host that had shaken the dust of India from their feet and had passed into the north, wanderers upon the earth
once more. Independent and Chinese Tartary are full of the geographical
records of the Hittites, but their history in these regions is yet to
write from Chinese and Mongol sources. Khiva tells of Ziphites in the north, Aral and Karakal of the line of Aharhel, and the Mongolian Doerben Oeroet meet us on the way as Hittites over • whom the Mongol even triumphed and whom he reckoned among the tribes of his race. No certain point is reached until we arrive
in Siberia at the head waters of the Yenisei, where a miserable remnant of the Khitts still dwells, and at Sibir. and Turuchansk that commemorate the Sheber and Tirchanah who founded in distant Palestine the original Magadha kingdom. The region about the Yenisei is one of mounds like European Scythia and the valleys of the Ohio and the Mississippi. The Khitan dead were
buried there, and from their tombs many objects of art attesting
an ancient and peculiar civilization, have been taken. On



326 THE HITTITES.
individual stones and on rocks by the river side inscriptions were made by the scribes and artists of other days, that resemble more closely the Sinai tic written rocks and those of America than anything else. Happily they are not only mere pictographs of hunting scenes rudely executed ; many are in characters coarser, freer in style, yet analogous to those which the Hittite has left in
India. They are brief yet intelligible, and their language is hardly different from the archaic Japanese of the Indian inscriptions, nor does it differ materially from the Japanese written language of to-day. But they are Buddhist, so the Kenite must have thrown himself into the Buddhist movement, devoting- his art, as a royal scribe, to the service of the servants of Gautama. How great a wooden civilization reared itself upon and about the mounds we cannot tell, nor have we data on which to erect a commencement for it. The historian must first be the epigrapher and tell what the wandering Hittite has to say about himself. The authors of the inscriptions in the Yenisei mound country were the Raba Kita, also called Kita ga Raba and Rabamame, which mean the Raba of Kita and the Raba people. The inscriptions mention £is a hostile people the Futamame, using to denote them the same term that appears in some of the Lat Indian inscriptions. We have found the Futa in India representing the Bharatan race in Oojein, and have seen the Varma Sakis dethroning the usurping Parta, whose grandfather Bagsara had been king of Futa. They may in migration be the same people as the Pety of the Chinese historians, who regarded the word as one of Chinese
origin meaning northern barbarians. It included as a designation the Khitan, the Hi, and the Mokho, and did not come into use till the seventh century A.D.^ But the Mongolian and Thibetan authors, who mention the Mongols prior to the time of Jenghiz Khan, call them Bide or Bede, and do not seem to have been indebted to the Chinese for the appellation. It is said that a revolution having taken place in Thibet in which the prime minister put the reigning prince to death and seated himself on the throne, the three sons of the murdered man fled to other lands. These were Borratschi, Schivaghotchi, and Biirtii Tschino. According to Japanese story the dynasty of Nintok became
38 Klaproth in Titsingh, Annales, and in the San Kokf.



THE EASTERN MIGRATION IN ASIA. 327
extinct in the person of the cruel Bourets, whom, as Parta of Futa in India, Rataha Varma dethroned. Biirta Tschino the youngest son went to Govangbo, but, mistrusting the Govangbo people, he left them, crossed the sea called Tenggis, and came at last to the srreat water named Baikal. There about the Borchan chalduna mountains he met the Bida. They questioned him as to his origin and he informed them of his direct descent from many illustrious lords of Enedkek or Hindustan as well as from the Thibetan Tuehl. Thereupon the Bida people consulted together, and at last said : " This youth is of noble birth and will make a beginning for us, let us exalt him to be our prince." So
they made him their prince and obeyed his behests.^® The constant association of the Beerothite name with Futa and Bida, and the fact that the name of Hadadezer is found in Japan as Zada Akira, and among the American Iroquois as Atotarho, evidencing a Beerothite element in the Japanese and Iroquois populations, tend to prove that Futa, Pety, and Bida, are the same word as the Kenite Bedad and Sanscrit Pandu, reproducing in Asia the Betah which was counted with Berothai as a chief city of the Hadadezers of Hamath Zobah. Their appearance in Mongol history, in which also the Doerben Oeroet or men of Arba have a place, suggests that the Mongols were a hybrid race, consisting of mingled Hittite and Japhetic (Jerahmeelite) elements, which did not become physicallj^ fused into typical Mongolism until after the time of Kublai Khan. This, however, is but a passing suggestion. These Futa-mame are represented as the enemies of the Raba Kita, a people whose violence was feared by the worshippers of Buddha, who protected the funeral convoys of their chiefs with armed bands when passing through the Futa country to the place of sepulture. The Futa, therefore, must have renounced the
Buddhism professed by their ancestors in India. To determine the Khitan family whom the Raba or Arba Kita represented, the monuments must be consulted. One of these reads as follgws : " The temple attendants of Buddha present a petition, to honour Buddha Anata, to king Sakata. The youthful consort of Sakata had destroyed the foundation of the
round house. The disciples of the law desire the re-erection of
38 Klaproth, Asia Polyglotta, 261.



328 THE HITTITES.
the broken ruin. To proclaim Buddha Anata, the righteous king Sakata convoked the poor and the rich. To him who gives three days labour, Buddha promises to overlook the united deeds of three hundred years. Sakata acquires discipleship the 970th year from the death of Buddha. The Raba people are convinced by reason of (the doctrine of) peace." This important document, which belongs apparently to the early days of Khitan monarchy in Siberia, for no king with dated record older that of Sakata has been found, shows that Buddhism, to which we are indebted for these monuments, was struggling to maintain itself. It also
indicates, along with other inscriptions, that it was the practice
of the Khitan kings of Siberia, as of those in India and Japan to associate with themselves in royalty the taishi or heir apparent who became a Caesar to the monarch's Augustus. Such a taishi was the youthful consort who had destroyed Buddha's round house and him Sakata seems to have survived. In another inscription Sakata is said to have lived more than ninety years and to have been succeeded by his grandson Matome, whom Jidzuta followed. Makuba is given as the name of Sakata's widow. An inscription without date tells of warfare, and of Buddhist priestcraft in making use of the widow of the slain king
to obtain contributions for the support of the disciples of the alms-bowl. " King Kumida overcame and destroyed king Yosuno. Attend to the prayer of the writing, the letters which Matoriki, the wife (widow) of the Irsrd of the kingdom, granted to be engraved. Four peaceful years (she spends) in special retirement, relying on the promise of Buddha that she will meet her lord. The writing announces loss (a calamity) : a high wind
has destroyed the temple. The widow desires contributions to repair the temple of Buddha. Let there be peace." A similar request is made by Batoba, the widow of the warrior Sasu and mother of his successor Nobagu with the usual promise of an indulgence, but in this form, that he who gives five days work will be regarded as having offered six hundred prayers. We have thus the fact of a Raba Khitan dynasty and people holding the upper waters of the Yenisei early in the fifth century of the Christian era. It is also seen that Buddhism prevailed among them and that they were the enemies of the non-Buddhist Futa,



THE EASTERN MIGRATION IN ASIA. 329
to whom, although it is not stated, Kuraida the slayer of king Yosuno, belonged. He may have been a Beerothite Shemidah. The Raba royal names masculine are Sakata, Matome, Jidzuta, Yosuno, Sasu, and Nobagu, and the feminine, Makuba, Matoriki and Batoba.*o Sankata is the name of a king of Cashmere who appears among the Varmas, and Sangata finds a place in the Maurya line which was headed in Magadha by Chandra Gupta but which speedily fell under the power of the Varma Sakis. On a sandstone rail from Buddha Gaya in India the name Sankuta appears as that of a descendant or successor of Gorami.^^ No Raba is known in Hittite history as *a Shuhite ancestor, but
Rapha belonged to the allied Achashtarite line of Cheiub, and his son Ishhod, as the ancestor of the people of Sughdha, or the Sogdians, might furnish the name Sakata. Buddha is called a Sakya, but his father Sudhodana bears the Chelubite name
Eshton. It is likely, therefore, that the Shuhites, being the most extensive of the Achashtarite tribes in the east, gave their name to all of them, and that the comparatively small body of the Hammurabites or Khanirabi, known in India as the Kamarupas, was thus classed with the Saki. Their original abode in India seems to have lain between Sogdiana and the western part of Cashmere, the Darvabhisara of the latter country representing the Abiezrites of Rapha, and the Sogdians of the former, the senior line of Ishhod. This identification of the Raba or Siberian Rephaim with the Sakis of India is in harmony with the Buddhist account of the ancestral monarchs from whom Gautama descended, which includes Chetiya, Upachara, and Muchala, or Ishhod, Abiezer, and Machalah, the sons of Samlah and grandsons of Rapha. The Varma name, for which in one place that of Viripa or Virupa is substituted, will thus be akin to the Sanscrit Bribhu as a name of Ribhu or Orpheus : and the Raba Khita or Rabamame correspond to the Esthonian Lappigunda and the Hammurabi of the cuneiform legends. It must have been a great moral victory that brought the descendants of the

man-devouring Simurgh and Harpy into the peaceful path of Buddhism. *
We can now decide with tolerable certainty that the Raba Kita were driven out of India by Vicramaditya shortly after 63 B.C., when that monarch issued his edict for the extermination of the Sakis, and revived the empire of the Guptas of which the Saki Varmas had deprived them. The Futa cannot have been long in following the worshippers of Buddha, for the same Vicram reigned in their capital Oojein. Taking refuge in Thibet and Tartary, new exiles from India gradually drove them northward,
until, in the beginning of the fifth century, they reached Siberia and there established a civilization, the nearest approaches to which are the Scythic to the north of the Black Sea and that of the American ;nound builders. How long this Yeniseian Raba kingdom lasted we have at present no means of knowing. They were not the first of the Khitan in northern Asia : the Jephunnites or Huns had preceded them. These Jephunnites, the Armenian men of Van, the Aven of the Bible, were known to the Indians as the Yavanas, being recognized as a tribe of Bharata Varsha or Hindustan. In some lists of the inhabitants of Bharata Varsha the Hunas replace the Yavanas, and they are generally thought to be the same people. The name Yephunneh became on certain lips Vun, on others Wun, as the Chinese Yun represents a more ancient Wen. This gradually, through the Greek Gun, assumed the form of Hun. The Huns first appear prominently in Europe in the middle of the fourth century A.D., when they pressed upon the Goths from the east and compelled them at last to seek shelter within the bounds of the Eastern Empire.*- But in Chinese history the Hiun-yu are mentioned in the time of the Shang dynasty, which is said to have reigned between 1766 and 1234 B.C.*^ If at such an ancient period the Chinese came into contact with Huns, it is certain that they were not then natives of what is now China, A more reasonable date is found for the appearance of the Hiong-nou,who were contemporary with theHan dynasty, between 163 B.C. and 196 or 220 A.D. It has already been intimated that part of this dynasty, called that of the

THE EASTERN MIGRATION IN ASIA. 331
Eastern Hans between the years 25 and 220 A.D., exhibits
evidence of having been itself a Hunnic line of invading princes, in its royal names Hoping, Heping, Hingping, and Yungping. When expelled from China, the Hans took refuge eastward in Japan and westward in Armenia, the old home of the Vans. The Japanese annals state that the Hans arrived in their islands about 300 A.D.** It is incontestable that the Jephunnites colonized Japan : the very name Japan, or Niphon its nunnated form, plainly declares the fact. But before entering Japan they almost of necessity passed through Corea. The Coreans were known to the Japanese and neighbouring peoples as the Hans. Their chief tribe or nation was called Kaokiuli, and derived its name from Keilah or Kegilah the Garmite son of Naham,^^ A little confusion arises from the change of r to i in the word Hazor or Chazor which became the property of the Jephunnites in northern Palestine at the time when Israel conquered the country, for as Hazol or Chazol it is not unlike Kegilah and may compete with it for identification with the Indian Kosol and Armenian Cozala. Ip the west the Huns were called the Khazars, and sometimes the Akatir. In Mexico the Corean Kaokiuli were known as the Acolhua Tepanecs.*^ In Pontus of Asia Minor, however, a distinction is drawn between Gazioura or Chazor, and
Gazelonitis or the district of Kegilah.*'^ It is evident that the Jephunnites preceded the Raba Kita of the Yenisei, and their congeners, the Futa or Beerothites of Bedad and Betah in northeastern migration.
There were other tribes of Hittites that formed an earlier
advance into the east. As we cannot tell when the Jephunnites, a remnant of whom Alexander found in Taxila, were driven towards China, nor what was the cause of their migration, so is
it to a large extent with the Zerethites. As Toltecs they are mentioned in Mexican history the first of all the Hittites; Chichimecs, Tepanecs, Zacatecs, Aztecs being later arrivals in Anahuac. They appear again in the Loo Choo islands as an out-post of the Japanese race. In India the Daradas were once a

powerful people. They named the Zaradrus river in the Punjab and possessed Lahora, which was an oriental home of the Illyrians. Delhi was their foundation, a name intimately connected with the migrations of the Zerethites in Thibet, and the original of the Toltec Tollan. There was Kurukshetra or Thaneswar, which reproduced the original battle-lield between the Kurus and Pandus of Gebalene. The Raja Tarangini tells of wars waged by the kings of Cashmere against these Zerethites, and, when Indian history dawns, the Futa or Pandus are found in occupation of a great part of the Kuru country, planting their Agra in the very midst of it. The Zerethites did not submit to Buddhism, and must thus have been the first to seek an abode in which human life was not valued, where they could carry forward the sanguinary rites of their forefathers. In Gujerat, an out of the way region, they left a remnant of their race, while the main body, passing through Thibet and northern China, gained Corea, Japan, and the Loo Choo islands, and finally the shores of America, not alone but in company with a band of Hamathites or Amoxoaques who recorded their deeds. No monumental record of these Zerethites in eastern migration has yet been found : the Mexican annals alone tell their story. Yet in Siberia, Inbazk and Pumpokolsk seem to be records of Bimhal and Pasach, the sons of Japhlet; and the great desert of Kobi, that sent so many invading tribes into China proper, may have received its name, not from the Mongol but, from the descendants of their ancestor Ziph. When the Japanese arrived in their islands they found
them already occupied by a peculiar race whom they called, after the Chinese, Mozin or hairy men, but who are generally known as Ainos. With them the Japanese had long wars which lasted into the eleventh century. Those who inhabited the Island of Yedo were called Atsouma Yebis, a name which seems to connect with Yebis-san-ro, the god of the sea.*^ Yeso is the present habitation of the Ainos and its name is native, as is Nossabou, that of one
of its bays. Among their islands also are found Mosiya, Mozia, Masaotsi, Motofa, Nayakoba, Yefaito. Their account of their origin is that an aged couple came to the sea at Yesasi vainly looking for something to eat. In a dream they were told to stir

THE EASTERN MIGRATION IN ASIA. 333
the sea with a stick or oar. This they did, when a white froth or scum rose on the surface of the water, under which they found multitudes of little herrings called nisin. Satisfied with these
they remained in the island, and had a great family of descendants. The old man received the name of Yebis, and his wife, that of Omba Kami ; and over their tombs temples were erected
in their honour.*^ This tradition is valuable as shewing that Yebis is a native name and not a mere Japanese title for barbarians. The language of the Ainos is distinctively Khitan, resembling some Dacotah and other American dialects, but also showing curious analogies with the Berber speech of northern Africa. It is very likely that they are a mixed race, which has degenerated through ages of privation from a nobler original, and that a laro-e Ammono-Hittite element in the line of Jabez enters into its composition. Their names for man ainuh, gur, and oikyo are not peculiar to them, for hihnah and wineha are Dacotah, eniha, anihuh and onkwe, Iroquois : ccari is Peruvian, heka Lesghian, agu Circassian, ickkiga Loo Chooan, oiakotsh Koriak. The Ainos may, therefore, be regarded as a branch of the Zuzim or Chichimecs, and the leaders in the eastern migrations of the
Hittite tribes. Returning to Siberia which the Raba and Futa tribes of the Khitan inhabited early in the fifth century, we acquire by
inference the story of a migration for which the oriental historians give very diflferent dates. The Chinese say that the Khitan took Liao-tong, which lies north and east of China proper, in the year
907 A.D., and from thence conquered northern China, giving to it a Khitan dynasty and the mediaeval name Cathay introduced to Europe by Marco Polo. That these Khitan were the Raba
Khita seems likely from the fact that the first of their chiefs who became a king of any note in China was Shektetang, whose name is too like that of the Raba Sakata to be a mere coincidence.^^ Japanese history has naturally nothing to say of migration, but places Sagateno in the year 810 A.D., and makes his successor Otomo, a name not unlike the Matome of the inscriptions.^^
« San Kokf, 212. 50 Gutzlafif. 61 Titsingh.



334 THE HITTITES.
Turning, however, to Corean history we read that, in 685 A.D., the Khitan, who had dwelt for some time in Liao-tong, descended as an invading host upon the Corean kingdoms, took possession of northern Corea, and held sway there with changing fortunes till 1216, when they were expelled or subdued.^^ The Chinese historians do not make them disappear from Cathay till 1125. If we accept the Corean date, the Khitan must have been on the borders of China early in the seventh century if not before, so that their stay in Siberia cannot have extended over two centuries at the utmost. There must have been Hittite inscriptions, Siberian in character, in northern China, but, if they have come to light, no public mention has been made of them. The Raba Khita cannot yet be traced in the histories of Corea and Japan as Rabas, but in America they seem to have constituted part of that Dacotah family in which the Scepohskah or American Shapsuch, the Mandans are found, as the Upsarokas or Absarooke, the remotest of the Abissares or Abiezrites. These Indians generally known as the Crows were among the handsomest and most warlike of the American aborigines.*^ The Japanese, and probably the Coreans also, have ancient inscriptions, but they have not been studied in the light of modern discovery, Japanese writers contenting themselves with efforts to set forth the modern
equivalents of the ancient characters, instead of presenting fac
similes of the original documents.^ All, therefore, that can be asserted at present is inference from geographical and tribal names in Asia, taken together with the recurrence of the same in
Mexican history, as to the successive waves of Hittite migration into the east, and the dates at which the older immigrants into Japan became, under pressure of the younger, emigrants towards the American coast. Thus we learn that the Jephunnites, though one of the earliest of the migrating tribes of the Khitan, must have been one of the last to occupy Corea and the Japanese islands, inasmuch as they are now the chief inhabitants of the former, and, with the Hamathites or Yamato, the principal occupants of the latter.

THE EASTERN MIGRATION IN ASIA. 335
mainland of Asia cannot antedate by any lengthened period the rise of Toltec dominion in Mexico, which is said to have begun in 721 A.D., although some accounts take it back to 717.^^ If we allow as long an interval between the beginning of the Mound Builder empire in North America and that of the Toltec monarchy, as elapsed between the period of Sekata in the Yenisei mound country and the establishment of Khitan empire in Liao-tong, China, arid Corea, the beginning of the sixth century will be time enough to bring the northern Hittites to America. There seems to be evidence that the southern or oceanic Hittites of changed speech came to Guatemala and Yucatan at a much earlier period, but, as has already been indicated, the changed conditions of these
semitized Hittites so complicate the story of migration as to call
for separate treatment from the historian. Before proceeding to the western coast of America, Hittite tribes, other thAn those which passed into and through Corea
and Japan, call for attention. Of these five remnants still
remain in Siberia, including the Yeniseians, Yukahirians, Koriaks, Tchuktchis, and Kamtchatdales. All travellers amoncr
these tribes, who have had any knowledge of the so-called aborigines of North America, have been struck with the surprising likeness between the two peoples in personal appearance, habits and arts.^" A comparison of the languages spoken by these tribes of central and eastern Siberia with those of the American Khitan confirms the connection thus established, although few comparative philologists have taken the trouble to make the wide induction necessary for such a comparison. The Yeniseian Koleda and the Iroquois Kanata, each denoting a village, seem
to be distinct words, but when it is discovered that the chief dialectic changes in the Khitan languages consist in the permu
tation of the liquids, the identity of the two words is at once perceived. The present Yeniseians can hardly be the same people
as the Raba Kita of the inscriptions in their country. Their
name of Kenniyeng, and their original extension towards the Obi, seem to mark them as Paseacbites in the line of Chanoch, and the Asiatic relatives of the Kanienke or Mohawks of America.

336 THE HITTITES.
Farther to the east and north, dwell the Yukahiri on the banks of the Jana, Indigirka, and Kolyma. They call themselves Adon or Andon Domni ; their name for man is yada or yadu ; and they have two words denoting people, koonshi and toronnina. Their god is Chail or Koil. In point of language they have many affinities to the Tarahumaras of the Aztec Sonora family of America. The god of the Yukahiri seems to be the same as the Lesghian Saal or Zalla, who is the Kenite Saul and Mexican Quetzal, but they themselves do not belong to his tribe or nation, the Beerothites. They rather represent the Maachathites or Massagetae, as descendants of Tirhanah, the second son of Maachah, and their name of Andon Domni connects with Ma Dmannah rather than with Temeni. The distinctive characteristic of the Yukahiri is that they are good tailors, being expert in skin and bead work, so that the Tungus employ them to make their garments.^^ Still farther to the east dwell the Koriaks and the Tchuktchis, the latter extending to Behring's Strait, which some of them frequently cross for hunting and trading purposes into America.^^ The Tchuktchis represent the widely dispersed Zochethites, and their name Tshekto is the same as that of the American Chacta or Choctaws. The legend of the Crawfish Band found among the Choctaws and some other American (Dacotah) tribes, is that large crawfish dwelt in ancient times in holes near the Choctaws and would not mix with the red men, but retired to their underground dwellings as soon as they appeared in sight ; some Choctaws lay in ambush near their holes, and when the crawfish came out to look abroad, cut off their retreat, upon which the crustaceans surrendered, had their claws clipped, were taught to stand on their tails which soon developed into feet, and were finally admitted into the Choctaw nation.^^ This tradition points to the reception of a foreign
people into the Zochethite tribe, and the crawfish, which is the nearest North American approach to a scorpion, suggests that the Cecropian Jerachmeelites, the scorpion men of Babylonia, were

THE EASTERN MIGRATION IN ASIA. 337
the people tlms admitted. Here then is another historical foundation for the story of the wliite man among American Indian tribes. The Choctaw story of migration through a region of intense cold, seems to indicate that the Tshekto made their way into America by Behring's Strait, rather than by the Aleutian chain or by a long sea voyage. The Schelagi who formed part of the Tchuktchis were their near relations, the Cilicians or Colchians, descended from the Charashim of Joab, the Kenezzite. The so-called Cherokees who call themselves Chilake, and whose language has its chief affinities with the Iroquois, probably represent this family in America. In Mexico they were known as the Chalcas. The Koriaks, on the other hand, worshipped Arioski the god of war, who is the same as the Iroquois Areskoui, and at the same time, as the Greek Ares, and Ma Reshali
the Achashtarite.^'^ In the Koriaks, therefore, the Georgians may be found rather than the Colchians, and their name comes from Korach, the eldest son of Hebron, the son of Ma Reshah. Closely related to them in speech are the Kamtchatdales, who call themselves Itelmen. Their ancestor was Tigil which is also £he name of their chief river. His wife was Sidanka, and the
parents of this first pair were Katchu and Katligith.^^ There is
a strange mixing of traditions in this theogony, for Tigil is Zochar as Taxil, Deucal, Tiglath ; Katchu is Cheth ; and Katli
gith is a Mexican-like form of Jerigoth, the ancestress of Talmai, whence the name Itelmen. The Kamtchatdales must, therefore, be a mixture of Zerethites and Zoharites. Adding to these two stocks that of the Ethnanite Tchuktchis it would appear that the sons -of Naarah had driven those of Helah into the north. The connection of Tigil and Itelmen is, however, very old going back to the time when Teucer son of Telamon soon after the Trojan war founded Salamis in Cyprus. The passage from Kamtchatka to America was by the Aleutian chain ending in Alaska. The great cause of emigration from that point, from northern Siberia and from Japan was the pressure of hostile tribes, a pressure which began with the expulsion of anti-Buddhist tribes from India before the Christian Era, but of which the

tide does not seem to have reached the ocean until the beginning of the sixth century.^"^ This continued without intermission
down to the time of Kublai Khan, far on in the thirteenth century. His great fleet, manned chiefly by Coreans and the tribes of northern China and Siberia, and consisting of four thousand vessels, which he sent to the conquest of Japan was dispersed by storms, and doubtless contributed an element to the population of America ; but the civilized inhabitants of that continent must have gone forth from Japan, as did those who
colonized the Loo Choo and Meia-co-Shimah islands as deliberately banished exiles in large sea-worthy junks well manned
and provisioned, to find an unoccupied land. Since 1782, no fewer than forty-one Japanese junks have been known to be wrecked on the coast of America, twenty-one of them since 18o(). Some were deserted, but in most of them sailors were found who settled in the neighborhood of their wrecks.*^ Such being the case in recent years when the voyagers had no intention of committing themselves to the eastern current, how much more likely is it to have occurred on a large scale in the times of upheaval in
eastern Asia, when the hunted Hittite, tired of weary wanderings, ardently sought a far oft" home in which he might dwell at liberty and in peace. The stories of revolt that occur frequently in the ancient annals of Japan are generally accompanied by tales of expatriation, which could only take place by sea, the very tide of which favoured the exile's cause, and wafted him rapidly to the new world. The Zerethite, it must also be remembered, was a seaman. As the Cherethite his fleet had swept the Mediterranean from Crete to Sardinia, and as the Illyrian Dardanian, he was the dreaded pirate of the Italian and Spanish coasts. In northern Asia, rivers and lakes must have kept up his water training, but when he reached the open sea, the native instinct must have revived, even as the hen nurtured duck takes to the pond, and have led the Toltec across the broad Pacific, while his more timorous brethren followed th'e Aleutian stepping-stones,
or in a single day traversed the icebridge at Behring's Strait. Thus with our eyes towards the world which we call western, but

which to the Hittites was the land of the rising sun, we leave the Asiatic shore in the track of these bold pioneers, turning the back upon the only two Hittite kingdoms that have withstood the ravages of time and the assaults of unnumbered enemies, with the hope that Japan and Corea may emulate in nobler
fields of enterprise the heroic deeds of those great ancestors of theirs, who, when the Semite was a vassal and the Aryan a mercenary warrior or a juggling priest, reigned over all the
nations as kings of men.

CHAPTER XXII.
The Hittites in America.
The histories of Mexico and Peru, and the traditions of the Iroquois and other tribes of North America, have been found to illustrate early Hittite history. The American continent was
originally peopled from two different directions, the one being the north-eastern coasts of Asia, the other, the Malay and Polynesian archipelagos. To decide the question of derivation,
the first question to ask is philological : does the tribe or people
make use of prepositions, and generally prefer the abstract term
to the concrete, in language ? If it does, it is of Malay-Polynesian
origin ; if not, of northern Asiatic. Another question relates to
habits and tradition : is the people maritime or fluviatile, and is its heaven an insular one ? Again if the answer be affirmative, the people is one that has come from Polynesia; if negative, it is of continental origin. Consulting the ethnographic map, it appears that the American tribes of insular derivation have everywhere been displaced, for they are found in the eastern parts of the continent as Algonquins, Mayas and Quiches, West India Islanders, and Mbaya-Abipones. Who displaced them from their original
seats on the western coast ? The answer is—the more warlike tribes of continental origin, that, through many ages, poured southward from the arctic limits of Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. There is no reason for supposing the Algonquins to have been very ancient colonists of America, for remnants of the same oceanic migration still occupy the western coasts, but the traditions of the Mayas and Quiches of Yucatan and Guatemala indicate that they were the primitive tribes of Central America.^ It is
quite possible, as some writers have asserted, that they arrived in the New W^orld before the beginning of the Christian era, bringing with them their strange system of conventional hieroglyphics that has puzzled so many investigators, and which
1 B. de Bourbourg, Nations civilis^es.



THE HITTITES IN AMERICA. 341
betrays relationship to the characters found on Easter Island and to the most ancient Chinese symbols.^ These tribes also brought
with them traditions relating to the ancient period of Hittite supremacy in Egypt, Palestine, and Chaldea. Some of these
traditions have been referred to in these pages, but this is not the
place to consider them in detail.
The first historical American people of continental origin is the great race of the Toltecs, whose monarchy was established in Mexico in the beginning of the eighth Christian century. The Quinames, Olmecs, and Othomis are supposed to have preceded them, but no nations of Quinames and Olmecs are known, and the Othomis have no history to speak of.^ The Toltecs are said to have come to Mexico by sea, but the same account is given of the Nahuatl, while the Chichimecs and the Aculhua Tepaneos are derived from the northern^ land of caverns in New Mexico and Colorado.* That the Toltecs did come by sea, that is by a long
sea voyage from Japan, the Loo Choo Islands, or the Meia-coShimahs, is very probable, but the admission that they did so cuts down the antiquity of the American Hittites of postponing speech by two centuries, for the Chichimecs were posterior by two centuries to the Toltecs. Thus the Chichimecs and Aculhua Tepanecs may have worked their way southwards from Alaska during the eighth and ninth centuries, while the Toltecs were extending their empire over the Maya-Quiche inhabitants of Mexico. But Mr. Becker has shewn that the traditions of the Mexicans bring all their tribes, Toltecs, Chichimecs, AculhuaTepanecs, Nahuatlacs, and Aztecs from Chicomoztoc, the land of the grottos, which is Colorado.^ The Toltecs, therefore, although they came by sea, must have touched land, not in Mexico, but somewhere on the Californian coast, and have thence passed south-eastwards into the region of caverns. The collectors of
native traditions have not sufficiently distinguished the various
tribes of the Khitan, for they call the Toltecs by the Chichimec name, and at times identify them with the Nahuatlacs, and even

342 THE HITTITES.
go SO far as to unite their traditions with those of the Mayas and Quiches. The Toltecs were the Zerethites, some of whose posterity occupy the Loo Choo Islands to this day. The Chichimecs were the Zuzim, the Tsutemame of the Indian inscriptions, and of these the Mexicas and Aztecs were branches. The Nahiiatl were the Nairi Achashtarites, represented in Siberia by the Raha-Kita. And the Aculhua Tepanecs were the Jephunnites, descended from Keilah, whose ancestors founded the Kaoli or Kaokiuli kingdom of Corea. The Hepherites were represented among these tribes by the Amoxoaques or Hamathites who acted as their scribes and learned men. The arrival of these successive Khitan waves drove tlie
American tribes of oceanic origin into the east. The Toltecs found in Mexico and farther to the south a civilization of no mean order,
that of the Maya-Quiche peoples, which in its architectural
remains exhibits affinity to the ancient civilization of the Malay archipelago.^ From that region also they must have introduced maize to the American continent. Mr. Crawford says : "As far as a matter of this nature is capable of demonstration, it may also be conjectured that maize was cultivated in the Indian Islands before the discovery of America,and that the plant is an indigenous product."^ In Mexico proper the Toltecs superseded the Maya
Quiche civilization by their own, the characteristics of which were Japanese, at the same time borrowing many elements of culture from the oceanic aborigines. Undue attention has been paid to these borrowed elements, the result of which has been an obscuring of the relationship of the Mexicans. Following a similar process, the ethnologist might derive the Japanese from China. The Toltec empire came to an end in the middle of the eleventh century, when it was superseded by Chichimec monarchy in the Mexican and Aztec, or Maachathite and Jachdaite, divisions of the Zuzim. Coincident with the fall of the Toltecs in Mexico was the
rise of the Peruvian empire of the Incas.® A great Toltec
civilization, outrivalling that of Mexico, arose in Peru and
extended itself southward into Chili, lasting until the Spanish

conquest. Descendants of the Khitan are found not only in Chili but also in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, exhibiting in the last named region the same degradation that obtains in the Es(iuimaux country in Arctic America. A third, intermediate, centre of culture was New Granada. Its inhabitants were not Toltecs but Chibchas or Muyscas, belonging, therefore, as Moschi and Cappadocians, or Meshechites and Jabezites, to the AmmonoHittite line, which lived in degradation 'in Japanese Yeso as the Yebis. Their great god was Nemqueteba, a disguised Mezahab or Montezuma, and their ancient teacher was the bearded Bochica, who came from Pasco and disappeared at Sogamoso, an occidental Paseach, Pthah, or Budha. Humboldt has shewn that their jfovernment by two monarchs, one of peace, the other of war, was the same as that of the Japanese.^ They had money also
consisting of circular plates of gold, and built temples that contained stone columns. Commodore Perry has also indicated the identity of the Muyscan and Japanese astronomical sy stems.''' The same Japanese analogies will be found throughout the whole of the Khitan area in America. On American ground no antiquarian subject has been more largely discussed than the origin of the Mound Builders. Their mounds have been traced from British Columbia westward to Michigan, but abound in the valleys of the Ohio and the Mississippi. In character they differ little from those of Siberia and European Scythia, the dead whom they contain being buried in the same manner, and the objects that accompany them being of a similar nature. In Wisconsin one of the mounds has the form of an elephant, and in another near Davenport, Iowa, a pipe was found carved in the form of an elephant. The question has, therefore, been asked whether the builders and makers of these were contemporary with the Mastodon in America of which the Iroquois, according to Cusick, had a tradition, or whether they brought their knowledge of the animal from southern Asia.^^ Certainly their ancestors knew the elephant well in India, and made use of

that animal in war. The Khitan sculptures in Mathura and other ancient Indian seats portray the elephant in many forms.^^ It is to be remembered, however, that Mammoths perfectly preserved in the ice have been found in Siberia about the Lena, in the very midst of the Yukahiri and other Khitan peoples, who would thus have an opportunity of reviving their recollection of the gigantic
animals that their more ancient artists loved to represent. The elephant pipe of Davenport has been most unjustly and on purely a 'priori grounds denounced as a fraud, and the same stigma has been attached to the inscribed stones that were found along with it. There have been archaeological frauds in America and
in other parts of the world. Negative criticism is also a very
easy process, involving little knowledge and less labour on the part of the critic, who by crying Fraud ! gains for himself a repu
tation for acuteness. The Davenport inscribed tablets are not frauds, and the same is no doubt true of the elephant pipe. The principal Davenport stone is engraved on both sides, on one of which a hunting scene is depicted, very much in the same way as in the Siberian carvings represented by Spassky.^^ The other sets forth a cremation or sacrificial scene, over which, in three
horizontal columns, are semi-hieroglyphic characters furnishing a new Hittite syllabary, having well determined connections with the Corean alphabet and the Siberian and Mexican graphic systems. The stone was found in 1877 by gentlemen who were unacquainted with the Siberian inscriptions, and at a time prior to any suggestion of Hittite remains in America. The second
stone is called the Calendar stone, and in its outer circle contains
twelve figures much obscured that appear to constitute a zodiac.
The third exhibits the effigy of a chief, around whose head are several characters, those on the left reading, according to Siberian interpretation, Makabala. The name appears in the same form on the cremation tablet, and also as Balamaka, and he is there called the king of Temba. Two other Mound Builder inscriptions, the genuineness of which is vouched for by a comparison of their legends with those of the Siberian stones, are those of the Grave

Creek and Brush Creek Mounds." Their brevity and the absence of punctuation make them hard to decipher. The most important Mound Builder document, from an historical point of view, is
the Daveni)ort effigy stone, for on the right of the chief's head is a date, which apparently follows the Lat Indian and Siberian mode of computation from the death of Gautama Buddha. It has not yet been satisfactorily deciphered. According to Iroquois and Algonquin tradition the Mound Builders were the Allighewi, who named the Allegheny range of mountains.^^ They were, therefore, descendants of those Alazones whose mounds Herodotus saw in European Scythia, and of Homer's Halizones, whom HodiuS and Epistrophus led from Alybe to the defence of Troy. They thus belonged to the Albanian, Ossetic, Alan, Araalekite, or Temenite tribe, which figures in Mexican history in connection with sanguinary rites under the names Tetzcatlipoca, Texcaltepocatl, Telpochtli. In southern migration some of them named the Tallapoosa river in Alabama, and remnants of them are probably to be found among the Maskoki tribes who dwelt in that southern region. Others were apparently driven far into the east by the Algonquins and the Iroquois, for, when the Norse explorers landed on the American coast as far south as Massachussets, they found the Skraellings or Esquimaux there, some of whom as Amalig-mut claim the ancient name of Amalek.^^ It would be an endless task to distinguish, in the numerous
tribes of northern Mexico and the south-eastern States of the American Union, the ancestral stocks of Asia. The former con
stitute a group called that of the Sonora Indians, all of whose affinities are with the ancient Mexicans, and represent offshoots
of many Hittite tribes.^^ In the second group, so well treated by Mr. Gatschet, all that is not Algonquin (Shawano, etc.) is Hittite.^^ The Choctaws are American Tshekto or Zochethites,and the Cherokees or Chilake are the Schelagi of the western world, descendants

of those Cilices whom Josephus places in Moab. The Taensas are probably transported Tohen or Tehinnaites, and their relatives, the Natchez, the descendants of Tehinnah's son Nahash. They should thus be American Nairi and count among them the Pascagoulas or Paseachites, and southern representatives of the RabaKhita of Siberia. The Pawnees or Pani are a remarkable people whose history has been told by Professor Dunbar.^'-^ That they
are of Hittite origin is undoubted, but it is not easy to tell in what
original tribe to place their divisions Cliaui, Kitkehaki, Pitahauerat, Skidi, and Arikara. The names of their chiefs at once exhibit relationship to those of Khita-sara and Pisi-sara. Such a name is Pitale-sharu, which means, a chief of men, Larucukale-sharu, the Sun chief, and Skurarare-sharu, lone chief. The first of these acquired grent reputation for putting an end to the human sacrifices of the Skidi clan. To the north of the Sonora tribes dwell the Pueblos, Yuma, and Paduca Indians. The Pueblo dwellers, of whom the Zuni are the chief, reveie Montezuma, but do not
appear to represent any one distinct Hittite tribe. Their cliff houses would naturally link them with the Kenites, and the word Zuni suggests a connection with the Kenite or Hamathite Zanoah.^" The Yuma Indians appear also to be largely Hamathite, Yuma being an abridged Hamath, and the Coco-Maricopan tribe being a western representative of Rechab as Merkab. A similar word is Maracaybo in South America, but Peru, the land of the Amautas, furnishes Arequipa. Mingled with the American Hamathites were descendants of Mezahab, for the Mojeves, with their god Mathovelia, belong to the same division.^' The Paducas are a remnant and a very considerable one, of the Chichimecs. The present name of the Chichimecs proper is the Shoshones. , With them are the Yutes or Jahdaites of the same race as the Aztecs, the Apaches, who are American Japygians or Jabezites, the Wihinasts, probably Jephunnites or western Huns, and the Comanches, who may be descendants of the Assyrian men of Comani.^^ The principal central and northern tribes of the Khitan are the Dacotahs and the Iroquois. The relations of the latter have

been sufficiently discussed. The Dacotahs bear the Zocheth name, wliich may have been that by which the Circassians call themselves, Adighen.^ But many different families are represented in the many Dacotah tribes. The Seepohskah or Mandans betray in their name a Paseachite origin, and the Absarookes, Upsarokas or
.Crows, an Abiezrite one. The Issatis or Sioux proper are men of Ishhod ; but the Omahas, lowas, Osages, Ottoes, Puncas, Quappas
exhibit a different origin, for, while the rabbit is their great hero,
they call his chief enemy Ishtinnike, in which the name of Eshton, the ancestor of Paseach and Rapha, from whom Ishhod and Abiezer descended is found.^* It appears, therefore, that the so called American nations, Peruvian, Muyscan, Isthmian, Mexican, Sonora, Pueblos, Paduca, Yuma, Mobilian, Dacotah, and Iroquois consist, and have consisted from the beginning, of portions of many
Hittite tribes formed into small confederacies. A little study spent upon the original tribal names, in connection with the laws of phonetic change, will enable the ethnologist to assign to these
tribes their place in Hittite genealogy, but the results of such study would be too voluminous and uninteresting to present to the general reader. There is a large Indian family known as the Tinneh, of which tribes are found from the borders of Mexico to the Esquimaux region in the north. The language and habits of these tribes are similar in many respects to those of the Asiatic Tungus,- but they also have many features in common with the Khitan. They are probably a people of mixed blood.^^ The adoration of the Sun which characterized alike the Japanese, the Corean, and the Tshekto, is found everywhere among the American Khitan.^*' It was perhaps more famous in Peru than elsewhere, but in Mexico the Sun was the oldest deity. The same orb was adored by the Muyscas, by the Natchez, the Chickasas, and the Hurons.^" The Huron and Natchez chiefs profess to be the descendants of the Sun like the Pharaohs of Egypt.2^ The same was the case in Japan and Peru.^^ Dr. Tylor

classes the Puelehes and Araucanians of South America, and the Muskogees or Maskokis and Dacotahs of the Northern continent among Sun worshippers.^^ In the same class he places the Kols and Khonds of India, remnants of ancient Hittite days, and the Ainos of Yeso.^^ From the writings of Dr. Tylor and Sir John Lubbock large numbers of facts might be adduced to prove theoneness of the American and the Asiatic Khitan, but the setting forth of these would be of the nature of an argument which the
author does not care to enter into. The descendants of the great heroes of the world's second infancy are to be found in the New World from the extreme north to the extreme south, some of them clothed and in their right mind, others leading a wandering savage life. How great their capabilities are, our survey of their past greatness sufficiently proves. Nothing that man may achieve lies beyond the powers of a race that has produced a Hadad, a Paseach, a Job, a Jabez, a Saul, a Gautama Buddha, and an Asoka. Yet Ichabod seems long ago to have been written over the Hittite name so far as America is concerned, though a bright future appears before it in Japan.
Physically and intellectually the Khitan are in the van of the American aborigines, and as individuals they may yet play an important part in history, but not as a nation.'^ Their cohesion was ffone before a white man set his foot on the New World, and it was never restored, nor will it ever be. The Khitan are shut in. By slow degrees the white man has been closing in upon them in the last retreat the world provided for the hunted race, until now there is no escape. The red man must amalgamate or perish on North American praiiies and South American pampas, as on the wastes of Siberia. He has had almost all the northern hem
isphere and part of the southern in his possession, and has not been able to keep it. His nation was the strongest of all the
nations of the earth, but internal strife, arising from religious
differences and the state system, weakened it in every field of empire, and made it the prey of the spoiler. Its record is one of blood and the avenging of blood, all the way from Egyptian Syene

and Elephantine to the snows of Lapland, and from Hebron in Palestine westward to the Fortunate Isles and eastward to Mexico. It is a nation that would not be taught by all the severe blows that fell upon it, by all the wise teachers whom Providence raised
up for its instruction. Its nature was that of the beast of prey,
brave and dignified, but cruel and insatiable. Its fall is part of
the world's salvation, its sad tragedy a monument of retributive justice. Quern Deus vult perdere prius dementat.
THE END.
