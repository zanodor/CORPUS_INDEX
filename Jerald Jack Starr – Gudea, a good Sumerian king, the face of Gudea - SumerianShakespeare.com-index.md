Gudea
10-12 minutes
Gudea of Lagash. Enlarge.
His origins are obscure. It's believed he wasn't a native of the city of
Lagash. He became a member of the ruling family of Lagash by marrying
Ninalla, the daughter of the king, Ur-Bau.
It is perhaps significant that he never signed himself as dumu, "son of..."
This suggests that his father was only a minor nobleman and not a ranking
member of the high nobility.

Gudea reigned from 2140 - 2120 B.C., during a time of political instability
for the Sumerians. The Akkadian Empire, which had ruled Sumer for
almost 200 years, had been overrun by
the Gutians, nomadic tribesman from the north. Although the Sumerians
were no longer answerable to their Akkadian overlords, they were now in
jeopardy from the Gutians, who
were starting to encroach on Sumerian territory. One of Gudea's concerns
was guarding
against the frequent border raids of the Gutians, who would
eventually take over the neighboring city-state of Uruk.
Gudea spent much of his time building temples and city walls, and
restoring those which had been destroyed in the constant warfare endemic
to the region. He lived in difficult and dangerous times.
Gudea was sipa zid, "the true shepherd". He was the model of piety and
virtue, working tirelessly for the gods and the welfare of his people. He
was concerned about social justice, and not just the exercise of
power. Gudea was as much a priest as a king. He spoke with the gods in
his dreams. In this way he was told to build the great temple of Ningirsu.
Gudea valued wisdom and learning, and the arts flourished during his
reign. Gudea loved peace,
but he was also a pragmatic realist who could guide his people through
perilous times. He was truly a great leader, one of the first in world
history.
Excerpts from The Building of Ningirsu's Temple, the E-ninnu ( "....."
indicates damaged text):
He is wise, and able to realize things. The ruler gave instructions to his
city as to one man. The land of Lagash became of one accord for him, like
children of one mother. He opened manacles, removed fetters;
established ......, rejected legal complaints, and locked up (?) those guilty
of capital offences (instead of executing them).
He undid the tongue of the goad and the whip, replacing them with wool
from lamb-bearing sheep. No mother shouted at her child. No child
answered its mother back. No slave who ...... was hit on the head by his
master, no misbehaving slave girl was slapped on the face by her
mistress. ... The ruler cleansed the city, he let purifying fire loose over it.
He expelled the persons ritually unclean ...... from the city.

He had everything function as it should in his city. Gudea had built the
E-ninnu, made its powers perfect. He brought butter and cream into its
dairy and provided its ...... with bread. He had debts remitted and made
all hands clear. When his master entered the house, for seven days the
slave woman was allowed to became equal to her mistress and the slave
was allowed to walk side by side with his master. But the ritually
unclean ones could sleep only at the border of his city. He silenced the
evil-speaking tongue and locked up evil.
He paid attention to the justice of Nanshe and Ningirsu. He provided
protection for the orphan against the rich, and provided protection for
the widow against the powerful. He had the daughter become the heir in
the families without a son. A day of justice dawned for him. He
set his foot on the neck of evil ones and malcontents.
The Sumerian kings were the first monarchs in history who were
concerned about the welfare of their subjects. You never hear of Egyptian
pharaohs or Chinese emperors being solicitous about the welfare of the
common people. See The Shepherd Kings.
Gudea: His crown is a
stylized shepherd's hat.
Most Sumerian statues have been decapitated, had their faces disfigured,
or were otherwise vandalized during the many wars that occurred in the
region.

The seal of Gudea: Gudea, with shaven head, is accompanied by a
minor female deity (lamma, guardian spirit). He is led by his personal god,
Ningishzida, into the presence
of Enlil, the chief Sumerian god. Wind pours forth from of the jars held by
Enlil, signifying that he is the god of the winds that bring life giving
rains. The winged leopard (dragon?) is a mythological creature associated
with Ningishzida, The horned helmets, worn even by the animals,
indicates divine status (the more horns the higher the rank). The writing
in the background translates as: "Gudea, Ensi [ruler], of Lagash".
Although Gudea used the title ensi (ruler, governor) rather than the more
exalted title of lugal (king), he was a king in all but name. Unlike other
Sumerian kings, however, did he not use the sign diĝir in his
name (meaning a "god" or "deity") which designated divinity. Gudea
did not represent himself to be a god, but only as a man who was divinely
favored, so it's significant that Gudea is shown bareheaded, without his
crown, and with his hands raised in the "reverence position", as was
required of a mortal man when in the presence of a god. A king like Ur
Namma was shown standing before the god Enlil with his hat on,
signifying that he too is a god (see Ur-Namma Translation).

Gudea foundation cone.
Clay cones (nails, pegs) were inscribed with dedications and driven into
the foundations of a temple. This cone is from the temple of Ningirsu, the
god of war and the patron diety of Lagash. The building of this massive
temple complex was the central event of Gudea's reign. In The Building of
Ningirsu's Temple (the E-Ninnu), Gudea recounts the vast amount of
labor and the many exotic materials from distant lands that were used in
its construction. It may seem like a contradiction that Gudea, who usually
portrayed himself as a man of peace, was building a temple to the god of
war. Unlike other ancient kings, Gudea did not routinely boast
of his military prowess. He was not the kind of king, like Naram-Sin
or Eannatum, who would portray himself marching to victory over the
bodies of his enemies. Surviving records show that he led only one minor
military campaign. There is no mention of the exotic materials from
faraway lands being brought in as tribute from conquered people; rather
the materials seem to have been obtained through trade and
commerce. More than any other Sumerian king, Gudea emphasized his
role as "shepherd", rather than "conquerer". So why did he put so much
effort and so many resources into building a temple to the god of war?
The answer to this question is best seen in the map below:

The Gutians (north, yellow) had already taken over Akkad (west) and
during the reign of Gudea's son, Ur-Ningirsu, they had reached as far
south as the Sumerian city of Uruk, which they destroyed. But the
Gutians never conquered Lagash (red) even though they had it
virtually surrounded. It seems the Gutians went out of their way to avoid
attacking Lagash. This is because Gudea made Lagash militarily strong
enough to preempt any Gutian attack. Thus he was able to provide his
people with twenty years of peace and prosperity while also insuring their
safety, like any good shepherd would do. Although Gudea is usually
portrayed as a gentle, pacifist priest-king, he was also a tough-minded
realist. He knew the time was
not yet ripe for a full scale Sumerian rebellion because the Gutians were
still too strong and the Sumerians were still too weak and divided. This is
why building a temple for the war god was so important.
For Gudea, building and restoring the temple of the war god symbolized
the re-emerging hopes of Sumerian independence, after two centuries of
Akkadian domination and during the ever present danger of attack by the
Gutian barbarians. The battle for Sumerian independence would not occur
until after death of Gudea, at the time of Utu-Hengal and Ur-Namma.
In the meantime, rebuilding the temple fostered Sumerian cultural
identity and promoted a strong "national" spirit. In rebuilding the temple,
Gudea was rebuilding the Sumerian nation, thus leading the way for Ur
Namma and the Neo-Sumerian Revival.

sometimes malevolent. Anzud stole the Tablet of Destiny, where man's
fate is decreed. Under the command of Enlil, the gods tried to recover the
tablet. During the ensuing struggle, Anzud "the white eagle" was killed by
the warrior Ningirsu. Anzud thus became the symbolic animal of
Ningirsu. This is why Anzud's name was associated with the temple of
Ningirsu, as seen in the inscription above.

This beautiful tablet is from Gudea (his name is on the 5th line down). It is dedicated to Ningirsu. It is not clay, but carved stone. The translation is similiar to the one found on the foundation cone. On this tablet, Gudea commemorates his restoration of a defensive wall for the city of Girsu. The necessity of restoring the city's defensives indicates the kind of times Gudea lived in. Enlarge the tablet.

Style: Neo-Sumerian
Medium: Alabaster
Click on any picture on this page to enlarge it in a separate window.
I was idly doing an "image search" on the Internet, trying to find some
pictures that I
could use on this website. I was surprised to find a statue of Gudea I had
never seen before. The statue was carved in white alabaster rather than
the usual dark diorite. Even though it
was just a thumbnail image, on a page with dozens of similar images, I
instantly knew it was Gudea. I clicked on the link to the website and was
surprised (again) to see the statue listed as “a priest” rather than
“Gudea”. The notes on the website said, "While this alabaster head may
not represent Gudea, or even his son..." I've seen a lot of pictures of
Gudea during my research in Sumerian history, so I know what he looks
like. I took another glance at the
white alabaster face and the distinctive shepherd’s hat (the crown of
a Sumerian king)
and I said to myself, “That’s not just a priest, that’s Gudea.”
I immediately knew that the statue was realistic portrait of Gudea, unlike
the other statues, which are rather formal and idealized. This statue is
exactly how I imagined Gudea would look in real life. The face seemed
strangely familiar, as if we had met before.
Once again, as with the Face of Ur-Namma, I was staring into the face of a
Sumerian king across 4,000 years of history. It wasn't the same lifeless
face of the other formal portraits of Gudea the king. It is a realistic portrait
of a living man; a portrait of Gudea, the man himself.
The face is so lifelike, it seemed as if Gudea was staring back at me. I sat
there for awhile, transfixed by his gaze, his large almond eyes filling me
with a sense of serenity and calm.
It was one of Gudea’s foundation cones that I had received as a gift which
first started my interest in Sumerology. The more I learned about Gudea,
the more I admired him. This led me to further investigate Sumerian
history. All my original discoveries about Tablet #36 (The
Great Fatted Bull), the Standard of Ur, the Face of Ur-Namma, Eannatum,
the Kings of Kish, Sumerian war chariots, and many other revelations, had
all started with Gudea. Now, looking into his face, I knew that my

Images of Gudea: Gudea is recognizable mostly by his royal regalia and
the inscriptions written on the statues and by the fact that the statues are
carved in dark diorite stone. This rare stone had to be imported into
Sumer, so it was very expensive. It is very hard, durable, and damage
resistant, and therefore difficult to carve. Because of the high cost of the
stone and the difficulty in carving it, most of the statues are quite
small, less than two feet high. They are called "Little Gudeas", yet
they helped to insure Gudea's immortality long after the monuments of
other great kings had crumbled into dust.

the overall resemblance to the face pictured at the top of the page. See a

Seated Gudea, left profile. Although Sumerian, Akkadian, and
Babylonian kings wore shepherds' hats as a crowns, these crowns were not
all alike. This crown is distinctive to the dynasty of Gudea. It has a
straight-sided brim and the stylized curls of lamb's wool, unlike the
crown of Ur-Namma, for instance, which is smooth with a curved brim.

Seated Gudea, right profile. Note how these profile pictures closely
match the profile pictures on the Barakat website; how the lips and
chin look the same and how the nose is slightly squared off at the tip.
Another feature of Gudea's square chin is that it's quite pronounced
when viewed from the front, but not so prominent when viewed from the
side. See this picture enlarged. These two profile pictures show that Gudea
had a slight over-bite, which matches the profiles on the Barakat statue.

Gudea. The statue is a “snap shot” of Gudea when he was a living man,
4,000 years ago.
Gudea and Ur-Ningirsu are the only real possibilities for the identity of
this statue, for a couple of reasons: First, the crown is distinctive to the
dynasty of Gudea and the city of Lagash. Second, the realistic style of this
statue was developed during the reign of Gudea, and it continued during
the reign of Ur-Ningirsu (see The Face of Ur-Ningirsu). Since this statue
looks exactly like Gudea rather than Ur-Ningirsu, it may safely be said that
it is Gudea. The facial features match in every detail. It can only be Gudea,
to the exclusion of everyone else.
This is clearly the real face behind the other more idealized statues of
Gudea. As such, it is ten times more valuable than all the other statues of
Gudea combined. It's actually priceless.
There are two things noticeably different about this statue compared to
The true face of Gudea about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/44701.html
8 of 13 8/18/2020, 3:11 PM



the other statues of Gudea. First, at 12.5 inches high, it is life-size. The
seated statues of Gudea, which show his whole body, are less than 18
inches high (they’re called “Little Gudeas”). Second, and most
importantly, this statue is a realistic portrait, unlike the other statues of
Gudea which are rather formal and idealized, typical of royal portraiture
in the ancient world.
This point is best illustrated by the two statues pictured above. The statue
on top is very idealized. The nose is thin and straight and symmetrical.
The nose on the bust of Gudea is less refined, it’s wider, more irregularly
shaped, like the real nose on an actual man. This kind of “photo realism”
was also applied to the rest of the face. Every effort was made to accurately
portray the exact contours of the face, the way the lips are set and the
shape of the chin. It seems that the statue was made to show Gudea as he
looked in person, without abstraction and without idealization, with the
exception of the “joined eyebrows”, which is a symbol of beauty. Even so,
the eyebrows are less stylized than another image of Gudea, and therefore
more realistic.
It’s been suggested that Gudea's square chin symbolized his strength of
character. Because of the realism of this statue, we now know for
certain that the square chin was actually one of his distinguishing facial
features, along with the fact that the chin appears to be rather weak and
recessive when view from the side. This kind of realism is unprecedented
in a royal statue. Royal portraits were usually meant to show the king as
being stronger and more imposing than he actually appeared in life.
The eyes are another telling feature. The eyes of the other statues, though
prominent, are “unseeing”, with the blank uncomprehending gaze of many
stone statues. The eyes on the bust of Gudea are different, they are very
The true face of Gudea about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/44701.html
9 of 13 8/18/2020, 3:11 PM



lifelike. It seems as though they can actually “see” what’s in front of them.
In other words, the statue is looking at you, not the other way around.
This is the hallmark of a realistic portrait in a sculptured face. This kind of
realism is shown on just one other Sumerian statue:
Even with his heavy-lidded asymmetrical eyes, it
seems as if Ur-Namma is staring back at you.
Some statues are realistic, some are lifelike. The best among them are
"living". These statues of Ur-Namma and Gudea are living portraits of
reigning kings. They are the only ancient kings to portray themselves the
way they actually appeared in life.
A slight tilt of the head adds a natural look to the statue that isn't seen in
other royal statues, ancient or modern. The eyes are slightly
asymmetrical, like the eyes of most people, making the statue more
realistic. The eyes of the other statues of Gudea are symmetrical. The left
and right eyes are the same size and shape, and therefore unrealistic and
The true face of Gudea about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/44701.html
10 of 13 8/18/2020, 3:11 PM



"unseeing"
(though Gudea's eyes aren't anywhere near as asymmetrical as Ur
Namma's). I believe
the eyes on this statue of Gudea are the correct size and shape, but the
eyelids are set
slightly wide to give Gudea this intense gaze.
This statue is clearly a complex portrait of Gudea and not just an idealized
portrayal of his facial features. I would suggest it shows us exactly
what Gudea looked like. This is the true face of Gudea when he was a
living man and a reigning king. It's obviously modeled from life,
with Gudea himself sitting for the portrait. The statue may represent
Gudea in his later years, portraying some of the strain of his twenty year
rule. Here you will see the serene and pious face of a priest, which is the
usual interpretation of Gudea. More important, you will also see
the face of a hardheaded realist, one who was shrewd enough and tough
enough to reign during difficult and dangerous times. For a brief
biography of him, see "Gudea Translation".
This statue makes Gudea the first human being in all of history where we
know exactly what he looked like. Not "kind of, sort of" what he looked
like, but exactly.
As the first recognizable human being in all of history, this statue of Gudea
is the most important statue in the world today.
Gudea, during the artistic renaissance that flourished during his reign,
was the first to invent realistic human portraiture. Heretofore, sculpted
human portraits (i.e., royal portraits, since expensive statues weren't made
for peasants) were done in a stylized, generic sort of way. They were
idealized, and not meant to be realistic, recognizable portraits of
individual men.
The idealization of a ruler's facial features to the point of making
him unrecognizable was not a practice that was restricted to the
Sumerians. It was done throughout history, all over the world, until the
present day (and the invention of photography). Royal statuary and
portraiture is all about "The King", and not "the man". It isn't meant
to portray the individual features (or flaws) of the king (or emperor, or
pharaoh); rather it is meant to show him as strong and handsome, wise
and powerful, a godlike being. This, for instance, is the reason
The true face of Gudea about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/44701.html
11 of 13 8/18/2020, 3:11 PM



why all Egyptian pharaohs look alike. Although there may have been some
small attempt to portray a pharaoh's individual features, pharaonic
images are always "symbolic" rather than "representational". They are
meant to project the power and majesty of the pharaoh, with
little regard for the man's personal appearance (which in real life may
have been somewhat less than awe-inspiring). An Egyptian pharaoh is
recognizable mostly by his royal regalia and by the hieroglyphic
inscriptions, and not by his facial features. All of us have seen the face of
Tutankhamen, but we still don't know what he looked like. None of us
would recognize him, even if he walked into the room.
I had earlier stated that Ur-Namma was the first recognizable man and
king in all of history. For a while this was true, but now the title must go to
Gudea because the reign of Gudea (2140 ‐ 2120 B.C.) predates the reign of
Ur-Namma (2112 - 2095 B.C.). Although there is only a slight difference in
the dates for the statues, this sculpture of Gudea is indeed the first
realistic portrait of any man (or king) in all of history. Never before had
the world seen such realistic sculptures of human beings, and it's
somewhat surprising that the Sumerians, who usually depicted the human
face so "generically", even crudely, should lead the world in
realistic portraits of human faces. There was nothing comparable to these
statues in China, Greece, Egypt, or anywhere else in the ancient
world. The statues of Gudea and Ur-Namma are comparable only to each
other, which is perhaps unsurprising. Gudea and Ur-Namma were
contemporaries. They knew each other. They lived only 40 miles apart.
It would be difficult to over-emphasize the importance of these statues.
They are not just masterpieces of the Sumerian civilization, they are
masterpieces for all of humankind. It is a miracle of history that both of
these masterpieces, one of stone and the other of metal,
somehow survived the millennia. As a result, we have these priceless
“photographs” of the two most interesting and important kings in ancient
history, two very different types of kings; one a warrior, the other a priest.
Ur-Namma was the “mighty man” and Gudea was the
“righteous shepherd”.
A little more than a hundred years after their deaths, Sumerian civilization
was destroyed and then completely forgotten. Over time, the statues were
buried beneath the ruins of

several collapsed civilizations. It would be more than fifteen centuries
later, during the time of the ancient Greeks (around 500 B.C.) before
people once again saw lifelike human faces sculpted in metal and stone.
It would then be another twenty-five centures before Gudea and Ur
Namma were "resurrected", to once again be seen exactly as they appeared
in life.
