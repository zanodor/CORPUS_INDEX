Piers Vitebsky's stud y of religion and psychology in tribal India focusses upon a unique form of dialogue between the living and the dead , co nducted throu gh the medium of a shaman in trance. T he dead so metimes nurture their livin g descendants, yet at o th er tim es th ey inflict up on th em the very illnesses from whi ch th ey died. T hrou gh intimate dialo gue, the So ra use the occasion of death to ex plore their closest emoti o nal a tta chments in all their a mbi va lence . Dr Vitebsky a na lyses th e actors' words and relation ships over seve ral years and develops a typo logy of moods a mo ng the dead a nd of kinds of memo ry amo ng the livin g. In compa rin g Sora sham a ni sm with the treatment of bereavement in psychoana lysis and psyc hothe rapy, he hi gblights a co ntras t in their assumptions which has fa rreaching co nseq uences for the social a nd professional sco pe of the two kinds of practice.

Preface
] lived for four years on the Indian subcontinent between 1976 and 1983 . This book is based on eighteen months which I spent among the Sora, mostly during 1976-7 and 1979, and the ethnographic present refers mostly to the second of these periods. I also made brief return visits in 1984 and 1992 . I am indebted for substantial financial support at various times to the Social Science Research Counci l of the UK for an initial postgraduate studentship; to Girton College, Cambridge, for a Margaret Smith Research Fellowship; to the Perrott-Warwick Fund for Psychical Research; and to my parents. I also received supplementary assistance from the Governing Body of the School of Oriental and African Studies; the Emslie Horniman Fund of the Royal Anthropological Institute; and the South Asia Language and Area Center of the University of Chicago. Many people have read part or all of the manuscript and many more have given me hospitality or encouraged me in other ways.

Most of all, my debt is to the numerous Sora who after initial doubts welcomed me into their homes and their lives and cared for me during long periods when I was heavily dependent on them . This book is about their relationships with each other and, given the intimate nature of the ma tters discussed, it seemed best to protect the anonymity of the main characters even though some of these are among my greatest Sora friends and benefactors. There is another book to be written about my own relationship with these people; but I hope that enough will emerge in the pages which follow to go some way towards explaining why my time among the Sora was a powerful formative period in my life, the lessons of which I am only gradually beginning to understand. I can do no more than dedicate this book to the Sora whom I knew, their ancestors and their descendants, along with my own family . I worked exclusively in the Sora language. I deliberately did not take any written sources on the language with me into the field and it was not until quite late that I had an opportunity to learn something of the Oriya, Telugu and Hindi which are partly known by some Soras. This approach gave me a very slow start since I arrived in Soraland quite inarticulate. But it also gave me a much richer reward in the later stages of my fieldwork. For someone who enjoys languages, there can be few more fascina ting experiences than working out the semantics of a language from the constant exploration of consistencies and variations in actual usage. Sora culture is an oral one. Villages, families and even some persons have their own distinctive dialects or ways of speaking: for example, it was often said that I had clearly learned to speak Sora in the company ofInama because of my extreme emphasis on glottal stops. Not surprisingly, there is no standard orthography among
PreFace XIX
those who have occasion to write the lang uage down (whet her in the Oriya, Telugu or inte rn at ion al phonetic script) , namely lin guists, missionaries and some So ra s themselves if they write le tters home while working in Assa m. T hough phon'ologists mi ght wish for many more diacritics than I have given here and the use of the s/lIl'a, for the sa ke of other readers (whom I very much want to remember certa in Sora terms) I have used only Ii (pronounced ' ny' as in Span ish) and I , similar to the Russian bl or the T urki sh back vowel. I have also distinguished ng from ngg, correspo nding respectively to the sounds in the E ngli sh words 'singer' and ' linge r'. ' Word s from other Indian languages a re spelt according to generally accepted standard s. The dia logues quoted are verbatill1 transla tions of tape reco rdin gs and are laid out like the script ofa drama. Elsewhere a speaker's actual words, or the literal translation of a Sora term , a re given in inverted commas. Where I supply my own paraphrase of a speaker's words I make this clear. Square brackets are used for stage directions or other material supplied by me to make the meaning clearer. In dialogues and figures throughout the book names and remarks of dead speakers are printed in italics. Personal names are stressed as follows: two-syllabled usually as in Sindi ; threesyllabled on the third syllable, as in Mengalll , Indiri , Jamano (never on the second syllable, as one might be tempted to do on the analogy orItalian or Spanish). To remember this, one has only to think of people calling to each other from one hillside to another, their voices whooping upward: 'E! Mengalu!' 'E! Pirino!' Sora life has a strong sense of gender, though sexual roles are less sharply polarised than in much of India: men can fetch water for the house, while women can plough with buffalos. Where no specific person is mea nt , I have usually avoided clumsy English circumlocutions such as ' he or she' and used the pronouns 'he ' for laypersons and 'she' for shamans, since the most important shamans are usually women. My 1992 visit, made while this book was going to press, showed that Sora society is changing rapidly. The children with whom I played earlier are now young adults and many are becoming Baptists. For those young people, there are no more dialogues with the dead and the ethnographic present of this book which I was still able to share with those over thirty is already something which belongs to an older generation.

Dialogues between the living and the
dead
The encounter
The Sora are an aboriginal ' tribe' who live in the forested hills around the borders of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh, towards the eastern seaboard of India (figure 1.1; see also chapter 2). In every Sora village, almost every day, living people conduct dialogues with the dead , who speak to them through the mouth ofa shaman in trance . The following is a typical example, which will reappear in context in chapter 7 (lines 251-62). A little girl who died recently has returned to speak with her young mother. Her mother is too overcome with grief to respond and the talking is done on her behalf by an older woman, the child's aunt. Here and in dialogues throughout the book, names and remarks of dead speakers are in italics.

[petulantly] Why aren 'l you showing me my nose-rings? They were so tiny. If I'd found them of course I'd show them to you. [a pause; the aunt continues] Oh my love, my darling, don't cause your own illness in others. Can you say that your mother and father didn't sacrifice for you?

At first sight, 'mortality' suggests the organic and fleshly na ture of humans, our predisposition to fall ill , to decay and to create our own replacements through sexuality. But the Sora will also force us to ask what it is that dies and what it means to be dead . The interpretation which Tshall offer is that for them, death is not a negation or absence of life. Rather, 'life' and 'death ' a re both phases ofa person 's total existence and close relations between persons are maintained across the line dividing these two states.
Dialog ues belll'eell Ih e lil'ing alld Ih e dead 5
In di a logues between livin g and dea d , speake rs persuade, cajole, tea se, remind , deceive, plead with each othe r. Dialogues represent a mutu al quest for awareness abo ut the other perso n's state of mind . At the same time, they a re the niedium through which each person 's being is co nsta ntly moulded. Livin g and dead peop le ca use each other to do thin gs through dialogues at the same time as they are themselves changed by these encounters. Each person is an agent, but at the same time is acted upon a nd does not simply return to his or her previous sta te. Since thi s kind of mutual moulding or perso ns passes throu gh their loss and separation from each other, thi s book is also about the special place which death has for the So ra in their fee lin gs of love and resentment , grief and anger. Finally, since life and death are set within the pa ssage of time and against the birth of new generations, this book is also about social co ntinuity and hope. What is a dead person? A perso n who di es becomes a SOllllll1 (pronounced with a long 0).' This word designates both an entity and a state. There is no article in the Sora language; but following Sora usage one can sa y of a dead person either that he has 'become a [particular] sonum' or that he has ' become sonum' (in both cases sonum-en gar/dIe). Virtually all illnesses and deaths a re said by the Sora to be caused in some way by sonums. In attacking the living, the dead seek to transfer to them certain experiences which they themselves underwent at the moment of their deaths. They do this by 'ea ting the soul' (puradan jum-) of the living victim in order to absorb him , thereby causing in him a kind of symptom or of dea th which is analogous to that which was undergone by the attacker himself (cf. the last few lines of text 1.1, above). However, the dead do not only attack the living and harm them: they also nourish and protect them. It is the interplay of these two contradictory attitudes, respectively aggressive and nurturing, which lies at the heart of Sora thinking a bout their dead. Sora hold their dialogues sometimes in the open by a path, stream or cremation ground, sometimes in the shadowy interior of the house . The shaman, who is frequently though not always a woman, sits at the centre of a group of people. Sora say that her soul leaves her body and goes to a separate domestic life, with husband and children, in the Underworld (kll1orai desa). While she is in a dissociated state of trance, her body is available for a succession of the dead who speak, one at a time, through her mouth . According to the mood of the dialogue and the degree of their involvement, their living interlocutors may squat on their haunches and huddle intently around her arguing vehemently with the dead, weep and embrace her, or else come and go at the edge of the proceedings and interpose a careless remark. A sequence of dialogues can last up to several

hours and range from casual gossip to ext remes of emo tion which I cou ld never learn to observe while remaining unmoved. But dialogues with the dead are not a ll tears: they often include moments of good humour and of obscene joking amidst uproariou s la ughter. A dialogue is a lways associated with the performance or promise of a sacrifi ce by the living to the dead . Though in one sense the dead have power, at the same time they exist in a state of emotional a nd material deprivation. Dialogues are thus not only a communication but also a feed in g. They are held on certa in occasions: at the divination to find out the cause of a patient's illness; in some of the subsequent hea lings; at certain seasonal harvest rites; and at the various stages of each person's funeral rites. In a large village of 500 people a dialogue may take place from about five times a week to about ten times a day, according to seaso n. Dialogues contain a quest for a verdict or for an increase in certainty. During divinations, living people seek the cause of a patient's illness; where a healing requires a trance, they seek confirmation that their sacrifice has been successful; while at a funeral they seek understanding about the cause of the victim's death . Whether on behalf of a recently decea sed person or of a currently ill one, dialogues with the dead are largely discussions of the

motivation and operation of these attempts to eat the livin g. Through the offering ofa sacrificial anima l as a subst itute (apalladll) for a patient, they are a lso a means of forestalling the co nsu mmation of these attempts . T he people who take part in a dialogue are genera ll y a wider or narrower circle of relatives. Under these circum stances, various groupings a nd regroupings among the li ving and the dead find themselves in constantly recurring contact: family conversat ion s, jokes and qua rrels continue after some of their participants have crossed the dividing lin e between life and death. It will become increasingly clear in later chapters how the occasions which precipitate these dialogues are not simply co ncerned with reso lving a situation of the moment. Rather, these co nversation s are ep isodes in lon g- running discussions which may bear ultimately on quite different and much la rger matters.
An outline of the argument
I have orga ni sed this book around a se ri es of dialogues between the livin g and the dead . These dia logues involve characters whom the reader will meet in chapter 2 and whose relationships we shall then follow through the book, both while all of these persons are alive and after some of them have died and become sonums. Part I gives a general outline of Sora ideas of the person in life and death . Part II analyses a funeral dialogue in which the living discuss with a recently-dead person the mea ning of his dea th and how it will affect their relationship with each other in the future . Part III analyses the dialogue at a healing rite, in which a family converses with nineteen dead perso ns who have been close to them at different times in the pa st. Each dead person is now seen to be in a distinct cosmological position along the trajectory of his or her ove rall existence. By analysing the evolution of moods in both the living and the dead , I show how a person's private feelings are linked to the unfolding texture of continuing society over a broad sweep of time. Finally, I compare the metaphysics and practices of Sora shamanism with those underlying contemporary psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, and relate each of these to the societies which they serve. To study how a group of unfamiliar people talk about some of their deepest feelings is not to diminish these feelings in our own eyes, but to try to make them at least a little more accessible. Anywhere in the world, regardless of their metaphysics, we may expect people to love and resent each other, the bereaved to grieve and the sick to fear for themselves. But another language or culture is not simply a filter which we can remove in order to understand other people's experiences as our own. Concepts of



8 Dialogues Ivith the dead
emotion '[serve] complex communication, moral and cu ltura l purposes rather than si mply [being] labels for intern al states whose nature or essence is presumed to be universa l' (Lutz 1988 : 5). Nonetheless, havin g been obliged to express myself day in day out in the Sora lan guage and hav ing become emotiona ll y involved with the people aro und me, I believe that we can begin to experience as familiar the apparently stra nge things said in these dialogues. Part ly, this is because we can understa nd so methin g of their systems of classification, in particular their cla ssification of sonl1ms: emotion, to quote Lutz again, is a bout 'seeing things in certain ways' (1988: 2 17). These ways of seeing a re patterned within culture and ca n be analysed. However, empathy does not depend on understanding the mea nin gs a nd relationshjps of concepts alone. Though my analysis will grow out of an unfamiliar cosmology in which, for example, babies are made by a female blacksmith in the Sun, in the end it can be valid only to the extent that it can help us to reflect on our own mortality and our own feelin gs of love and anger, loss and continuity. In transcribing tapes with the aid of notes and my memory, I shall describe tones of voice and styles of delivery as 'ungracious', 'frantic' , 'tender' or 'sarcastic' and in later chapters shall move towards a typology of such moods. This analysis of the emotional tone of dialogues will depend not simply on what was said at the time, but on my understanding of the connections between words and other gestures, actions and events, as well as of the place of these words in the sequences of episodes which make up the relationships of the persons concerned over many years. This is the understanding which Carrithers calls narrativity , the understanding of 'complex nets of ever-new deeds and changing attitudes' by which humans 'perceive any given action not only as a response to the immediate circumstances or current imputed mental state of an interlocutor or of oneself but also as part of an unfolding story' (Carrithers 1990: 269).
Just as we come to know the characters in this book only through the unfolding of theil' relations with other characters, so the empathy the anthropologist or the reader may achjeve with the feelings of the Sora, however limited, is based on an awareness of this narrative . It is therefore far richer than whatever is implied by any notion of empathy with a supposed mental state of the moment , such as 'love' or 'anger'. Michelle Rosaldo suggested that what distinguishes feeling from thought is 'the engagement of the actor's self, ... the apprehension that "I am involved'" (M . Z. Rosaldo 1984: 143). Even at the distance of being a reader, this involvement is with other persons and implies a sense of time. In

Thus J take feelings to be interpersona l and socia l as well as in terna l and private; and I sha ll conclude, partly with the help of id eas of ca usa lity which are so forcefu l fo r the Sora themselves, that they have, not just an immed iate present, but also a past and a future. Rather than seein g dialogues as bein g abo ut life and death , then , I shall interpret them as being about relationships betweeil persons over time. Death is only a phase of a person's tota l conscious existe nce. The Sora person who begins to emerge from chapter 3 onwards is therefore I~~t the sta rting point of So ra metaphysics, but a hard -won and always provIsional achievem ent. It is not the same kind of bein g as the sharply bounded ent ity commonly ima gined in the West, which as it grows in ma turity reaches a height of individuation and is then subject to sudden a nnihilation (or transportation to an inaccessible, tran scendent rea lm) . Rather, the longer the Sora person lives the more he becomes involved with other perso ns , as his relationships with those others bea r upon his own being in more and more complex ways . Instead of being a bounded entity, the person can also be interpreted in this light as having a core, or focus of concentration, which at its outer edges diffuses into other persons. Persons partake ofeach other's destiny and are understood , even defined , largely in terms of each other. Virtually everything significant in a person's fate, his viability as well as his vulnerability , is interpreted through his involvement with other persons living or dead. The Sora thus appear to see a complex web of agency between persons, in which agents, even while they act on others, are themselves changed by the interaction. Within this web of mutual agency, death plays a central role . The word 'sonum' represents the most enigmatic stage of personhood, both for the Sora and for their interpreter. I do not try to tran slate this word until late in the book, but mea nwhile set the word free in order to see how it behaves. The essence of loss on bereavement is not annihilation of the loved one, but separation from the loved one. People who remain attached to each other are pulled apart into separate realms of existence, which the Sora represent as separate kinds of space, or rather, as separate modes within the same space. The common landscape which is occupied by both the living a nd the dead emphasises the ontological gulf which exjsts between them: even when one visits that very point on the landscape where one knows that a dead person resides, one no longer interacts with them in the same way as one did
when that person was alive. Sonums are enigmatic not only because they are inaccessible. The

problem of loss is one ofseparation com bin ed with, or even conceived as, a con tinuin g interaction which is somehow qualitatively tran sform ed . Afte r death, the consciousness becomes a powerful but cont rad ictory causal principle, nourishing its livin g kin through the soul -force it puts into their grow in g crops, but at the sa me time precipitating illness and death amo ng them. This id ea of causality is not simple and its implications will be developed throughout the book. In one aspect, the dead give to the livin g their continued sustenance and their very ex istence, yet in another th ey diminish their being as they impinge on them and consume them. The Sora express thi s causal relationship through an elaborate classifica tion of sonums. Chapter 4 prese nts the fundamental contrast between the two cross-cutting aspects of a dead person. On the one hand , he is an Ancestor-Sonum, retaining his role within the lineage and something of hi s personality and nurturing his descendants . On the other hand , he is a member of one of several collectivities which I call 'Experience' sonums. This contains many people who have died in a simi lar way to himself. In this latter aspect, his personality and lineage role are submerged in favour of an emphasis on the experience of pain which he has suffered and on the aggressiveness with which he tries to perpetuate this suffering among those he has left behind . Thus, to put it at its simplest, someone killed by a leopard becomes a member of the collectivity called Leopard-Sonum and then sends leopards to attack his descendants in order to cause their deaths in turn. Different categories of sonum are located in different features of the landscape. As a living person moves around this landscape, he may encounter sonums and become involved with them. But this happens, not at random , but as a development of his long-term relationships with various dead persons. Though his encounters with sonums may cause illness, they do not constitute a medical history so much as a history of his states of mind in relation to other persons. An illness in a living person is a reflection ofa mood or attitude in a dead person, and the rite which heals a sick person is also a rite to acknowledge the claims of the sonum who has attacked him. The living person's awareness of the dead is an integral part of the symptoms and of the definition of his illnesses, so that his medical history amounts to an important part of his biography. It is the shaman who enables this awareness to be developed through verbal articulacy. By her techniques of trance and formalised verse, she creates the setting for living and dead to confront each other and to speak, each for themselves, in ordinary language. Word-play constitutes the main Sora art-form and words for speaking are often used where one might

In part II ('Responding to a new death'), I ana lyse the dIalogue and the sung verse at a man's funeral. Chapter 5 shows how a group of persons use dialogue at a n inquest to bring themselves lllto a state of shared consciousness with the deceased. This consciousness encompasses a paradoxical mixture offeelings. Thinking about the dec.eased is linked to an awareness of his suffering, a suffering whIch contlllues lllto the present. On the one hand , the living share his suffering out of compassion (abasu)'/I/J). But at the sa me time they fear (batollg- ) the dead person whom they love, since he will later become an aggressor himself and repeat the form of hi s
death on them. For the dead man himself, the funeral is a crucial rite of transformation. In chapter 6, the hving Ancestor-Men impersonate his Ancestors a.nd struggle to 'redeem' him through so ng from the Experience sonum whIch represents the form of his death , in order to lead him into their own company. This redemption of the deceased is not fully successful at first and in the early years he frequently reverts to the form of his Experience and repeats his death on others . The transformation is partly cosmologica l, as the Ancestors move him from one location on the landscape to another; partly ontological, as they turn him from one kind of sonum into another; and partly social, as he is led from the anti-society of his fello:" Experience-victims into the company of his patrilineal Ancestors. ThIS transformation from Experience-member to Ancestor passes through the transitional category of Earth-Sonum, the imagery of which centres on wholeness and retention of form. Earth-Sonums are located in springs and the dead who reside at each site contribute to the soul-force of the crops which grow around that site. Earth-Sonum is an Experience, causing illness and dea th oBut it does so through swelling of the body, the blockage of its orifices and the prevention of childbirth. This very same imagery when applied to the kin-group allows Earth-Sonum to function also as a rallying point for the redeemed dead, since by this same imagery of wholeness It reunites the dispersed members of a lineage segment. Part III (,Operating the calculus of all previous deaths') opens out the discussion to a broader time-scale. Every sonum, at any given moment, has its own cosmological location and its own relationship to each of its mourners. Chapter 7 presents a dialogue in which members of one family converse with the sonums of nineteen of their dead and the state of each one

of these dead persons is revealed. Throughout the remaining chapters, I progressively develop the sociological dimension of the dead person's evo lution . Which one among the range of available alternative Eart hSonum sites he resides in, reflects his status as a future Ancestor for various kin -groups whom he thereby endorses or rejects. The ambiguous status of married women is particularly intense , caught as they are bearing ch ild ren for their husband's lineage against the interests of their father's lineages. Crucia l cases of inheritance can hinge on whether a married woman sett les after death in the Earth site of her hu sba nd 's or her father's Ancestors . Throughout these chapters, I exam ine how the Living and the dead combine to work through their uncertainties abo ut reside nce and affi liation , in dialogues which show that such 'structura l' conflicts are closely linked to long-term shifts in the psychological process of mourning. Two clu sters of relationships are drawn out of this dialogue for closer study at the beginning of chapter 8, which constitutes the heart of the book. In the first case, a dead girl vigorously affirms her devotion to her surviving husband against all the devices which her hostile brothers can summon up to tear them apart. The second case shows a web of relationships which links suicide and attempted suicide among the living to a chain of marriage, childbirth and perverse changes of residence among the dead . This web implicates numerous living persons as they struggle to assert their claims to disputed property and to manage their lives. These two case studies reveal a tangled intertwining of lineage, property, inheritance, love, jea lousy and anger, in which the conflicts of interest involved ensure that living interlocutors will not always hear from the dead what they want to hear. Some of the sonums who speak are almost devoid of personality and leave their living interlocutors indifferent, while others, like the little girl at the beginning of the book, have great emotional power over those whom they address and cause them extreme distress. This chapter analyses the emotional tone of each encounter between dead sonum and living mourner. The analysis correlates unsettled moods in a dead person with a tendency to revert readily to his Experience mode, since the Sora see him as still unhappily trapped in the Experience of his own death; while as he becomes more settled, he will be more inclined to remain in his Ancestor mode. Thus by asking which sonums remain unredeemed and why, we see that there is a correspondence between a dead person's cosmological position and his state of mind . In interpreting this , I build here on the earlier discussion in chapter 4 of how a living person's medical history represents a history of his relationships with others who are now dead. A sonum's effect on you depends on that sonum's own state of mind , but it also equally reflects how you feel a bout the deceased . Sora sonums

make you who you a re through inheritance; yet at the same time they invade your house, raid your body and then go back to their hid eouts to ea t and sleep with other so nums. They wander at large, at their own volition , yet they are at"so shared between a number of living interlocutors and ch a nge their nature over time only through the med ium of dia logue with groupS of these persons. Our interpretation of what a sonum is, is intim ate ly bound up with how we try to translate the word into our own lan gua ge. Phenomena in some way resembling sonums are encountered throughout the world. One possible approach to their interpre tation might be first to translate the word into a widely accepted E nglish eq uivalent and then to discuss the workings of the present particular examp le in comparison with others from elsewhere. Among such equivalents, co mmonly used ones include 'spirit' , 'God' or 'god', ' deity' and 'power'. However, the use in anthropology of such terms may block the reader's und ersta nding by prejudging the nature of what one has set out to investigate. A term such as 'spirit' seems to presuppose some degree of consensus and yet at the same time is treated as a ' black box' immune to internal analysis . Owing to the inbuilt materialist bias of much of this work , this consensus is one not so much of understanding as of that kind of distancing which leads to the more intractible formulations of the supposed dichotomy between 'primitive' and 'rational' thinking. Even within theology, where terms like 'spirit' and 'god' are more readily comprehended , there are difficulties. 'God' with a capital 'G' is closely tied to the idea of monotheism and can perhaps be used only when a similar idea is presupposed for the reli gion under discussion , as was done for instance by Evans-Pritchard for the Nuer (1956) or on a worldwide scale by Schmidt (1926- 55); while 'god' with a small 'g' implies a possible multiplicity of such gods so that by contrast to 'God ' we risk suggesting their falsehood or inferiority. For many modern readers faced with the concept so num , such glosses do not support the et hnography in any sense which makes them feel that they could with equal ease have been born to live out their life as a member of Sora society , pervaded as it is day in day out, for instance, by 'spirits' . For such a reader , spirits are something eccentric and marginal and probably are not even 'real'. As Leach asked, speaking no doubt for many others, ' how should we interpret ethnographical statements about palpable untruth? ... Why do all these people believe in something which is untrue?' (1967: 44). If the reader is told that for the Sora, sonums are the main agents and even principle of causality in human affairs, how can he understand this in any way which does not distance him irretrievably from those people's experience? At this stage of the book I propose a gloss for 'sonum' which engages



14 Dialogues Il'ith the dead
with certain key properties which have emerged from our analysis. One of these is the way in which sonum s make a journey through a time which is not homogenous but is shaped by people's feelings. A further property is the association of a sonum with the biographies of living persons, since a sonum is a relational concept: the state of mind ofa sonum affects the state of mind (and body) of the living person. The sequential , causal relation ship between these states suggests that we are dealing with an aspect of memory. The reason why the redemption of the deceased is a slow and painful process is that the living person is unable to free himself from the memory of what things were like before this transforma tion. An illness then appears as a resurgence of this old memory. A healing, called in Sora a 'banishing-rite', seeks to repress this old memory and uses dialogue to confirm its more recen t form. For the rest of the book I translate the word 'sonum' as 'a Memory', with a capital 'M' , as distinct from the ordinary use of the word 'memory' . The consonances and dissonances of putting these two terms side by side bring out clearly why sonums can seem at the same time so close to my feelings yet so foreign to my metaphysics. A sonum has the locus of its existence outside the minds of any of the people whom it affects. A Western 'memory', on the other hand , is still seen as located firmly in the mind even when it is said to be 'eating up' its rememberer. A Sora Memory of a dead person remains outside the mind of the rememberer, who is at least partly a confluence made up of such Memories rather than an entity who could contain them. The use of the term 'Memory' instead of'sonum' for the remainder of the book will again and again throw into relief this contrast in metaphysics. A sonum is my Memory of someone else, so that my present state is affected not only by my own past state, but also by that of another person. So in addition to the onward movement of time there is also a transferral of perspective, a shift from the subjective viewpoint of the deceased to that of his successor. Chapter 8 concludes by pinpointing the mechanism of this transferral in the grammar of the Sora verb, as a dying person shifts his perspective from being the victim of someone else's aggressive action to being the perpetrator of his own . The Experience mode of being dead makes an analogy between persons based on shared suffering and is associated with transitive verbs. The living person embarks on his path towards death in the passive: he is 'grabbed', 'seized', 'raped' , 'eaten up'. He emerges some time after death as a grammatically active, causal agent who perpetrates on others the force of those same verbs whose action he suffered earlier. He is now doing the 'grabbing' and 'seizing' . Having been the patient of someone else's violence, he has become the agent of his own. The

process of public divination , with its shared con sciou sness, unmas ks the age ncy of the attackin g sonum which is otherwise hidden by the form of the Sora pa ssive verb . Only through divination does it becom e possible, not only to sa y thal the patient is being attacked , but to say by whom. It is thi s whi ch ex terio rises the pati ent's inn er fee lings and ma kes them part of the 'objective' world outside.
This viciou s cycle is broken only when the dead person 's redemption becomes complete and he becomes an Ancestor who does not revert to his Experience mode. In his Ancestor mode , he sets up a different kind of analogy with a livin g person . This is expressed by a verb in the middle voice, whereby he creates an identifica tion between himself and the new ba by who is to be his namesake. Here, there is a transmission without aggression and the repetition is one not of action but of being, not ofa form of suffering but of social identity.
The Sora person who passes through various stages of being alive and dead is thus not an entity to which memory-traces cling on the outside like barnacles . He emerges not so much as having a firm core or an essence, as being a changeable confluence of attributes and traces of memories and events, a coming together of other people's perceptions and actions as much as of his own.
Just as the person came into being through his cumulative interaction with others, so I use my translation of a sonum as a Memory in order to interpret the sonum's gradual decline and dissolution as a process of being forgotten. In chapter 9 we see the person dissolving again after death into his various constituents, of which his Experience and Ancestor aspects have been only the first to emerge clearly. The dead person's choice between rival Earth-Sonum sites is an essential stage in the disputed transmission of his material property; for a woman, in addition, it is a final statement about the validity of her marriage. One by one, the qualities or attributes of the deceased fall away from him and are returned to the living, who then have less and less reason to talk with him. The last constituent to be returned is the person 's name, which returns to one child among his descendants in a festival which echoes the format of the funeral but inverts its imagery by suffusing it with joy. There remains a final, vestigial residue of the deceased which continues its trajectory ever onwards, away from the awareness of the living. Eventually, this attenuated Memory dies a second death in the Underworld, at which point it becomes a butterfly beyond the reach of any communication with the living. This occurs around the time when the deceased is passing out of living memory, a Memory who has no-one left alive to remember him.

Chapter 10 concludes the book by asking how we can best understand Sora ideas of death, loss and continuity by looking at our own ways of remembering, grieving and looking forward to the future . Within the overall diversity of modern industria l society, there is a growing dissatisfaction with what many people see as an increasingly alienated relationship to death, as religion flows out of people's lives and leaves the field largely to
psychology. Though Sora insights into the human co ndition are profound, I argue that to adapt them for use in contemporary psychotherapy is more problematic than we might wish: though they are good answers, they do not correspond directly to the same questions. The psychological effect of dialogues with the dead is deeply rooted in the total patterning of Sora society, in which the person grows and falls away again, all in term s of other persons. Consciousness is not the starting point of a Sora perso n's interaction with other persons but a result, as though one did not have full consciousness without this interaction . The lives of the Sora people whom we have met show how the Sora practice of funeral and dialogue cannot assuage every grief. However, it does provide a framework of structural time which nurses the evolution ofa mourner's feelings and relates this to a public acknowledgement of these feelings, along with the feelings of many others. This acknowledgement is possible because of the exteriority of the Sora Memory, which is not contained within the diffuse living person but is stored in features of the common landscape. Psychotherapy and psychoanalysis lack the Sora concepts of communal space and time, as well as the interaction with exterior Memories which exist outside their rememberer. The theoretical foundation of most modern secular bereavement counselling within these idioms lies in a seminal paper by Freud called ' Mourning and melancholia ' (1957[1917]). Freud's paper yields a model of the process of bereavement which is parallel to that implicit in Sora thinking, yet one which inverts the fundamental Sora presupposition about the continued autonomous, exterior existence of Memories. The psychological and social consequences turn out to be more far-reaching than the mere fact of logical inversion would suggest. If the dead person does not 'really' exist, then to treat with him beyond a certain time must be judged pathological. Yet for the Sora, the deceased does continue to exist. While they use the categories of Ancestor and Experience to distinguish the more from the less desirable, there is nothing 'pathological' about the Experiences. These are mapped across the common landscape and the process of conventionalisation represented by the Experiences reminds the mourner that the loss which to him seems unique

and terrible, is ana logo us in very specific ways to numerous other losses which have happened before and will happen aga in . By placing the sufferer in the midst of a public divination, the gro up converts hi s private perception info a common one and locates the sou rce of his suffering outs id e the circl e which they all share. The very fact that other livin g rememberers have slightly different personal memories of the deceased only confirms the reality of his ex iste nce as the point at which their separate memories all overlap . The experiencing subject, the individua l perceiver, is subordinated at every turn to somet hin g grea ter than himself. This is co llective and, through the manner in which it encompasses dispute, is ultimately co nsensual. Where Freud and bereavement co un se lling offer us a mere psychology of death, the Sora offer a total interpretation of death. Their view of death is larger because for them death itse lf is not a negation of life but a continuation of it with a change in the quality of fac'e-to-face interaction. This is why the dead are so articulate. Once one party to a relationship dies , certain inhibitions are lifted and the unspeakable can become the spoken. But when we seek the source of what it is which is spoken, we cannot a ttribute this solely to the individual speakers or to the shamans through whom their messages pass. We are driven back to the community as a whole. In an attempt to clarify the shaman's role, I compare her not only to the psychoanalyst but also to Dostoyevsky as an author of the 'polyphonic novel', in which the characters speak, supposedly independently of the author, with a 'pllll'ality of voices' . In some essentials the comparison turns out to be close; but it also shows that the shaman has a different relationship to space and time, while the contradictory voices within and around her are those of litigants ra ther than, as in Dostoyevsky, of ideologies. The speakers have a fa r higher degree of autonomy than do the characters of Dostoyevsky, and the sa me living and dead persons communicate with each other on different occasions through a range of different shamans. The complex web of perso ns' lives means that Soras can be seen as the authors of both their own and of each other's personhood . They discuss their feelings, not so much through nouns for inner states of emotion such as 'love' or 'anger', as through verbs which link states of consciousness such as Memories . These verbs represent the dynamic strand of interpersonal relations among both the dead and the living. What one might like to call inner feelings are brought to the very edge of the Sora person, to the point at which they encounter other persons and a re dialogised.

A note on 'shamans' and other intermediaries T he Sora word which I have translated as 'shaman' is kurall. T he re are two kinds of shaman, the ' funeral' (sallatung) kind , and the 'divination' (tedulIg) kind 'vvho also perform healings. Funeral shamans are more ' im portant' (muda) and are largely women , while divining and hea lin g shamans, who are more ' lowly' (osellg) , are somet imes women but often also men. In a large village there may be two or three of the former and a dozen 01: more of the latter. Divinations and most hea ling rites are a sma ll affair and a shama n perform s a lone. But at fun eral s, which a re more momentous occasions held in stages over three years, several may sit together. In one village with a strong line of succession Thave seen four young peo ple (three women and one ma n) who sat sid e by side with a n old, nearly blind woman who was their teacher. Each acted independently as the mouthpiece for a different stream of dead people while their living interlocutors moved from one to another of them amidst the hubbub. The dead , just like the living, sometimes also conducted their own subsidiary conversations as the shamans through whom they spoke turned their heads away from the living
towards each other. On the morning of a journey to the Underworld the shaman fasts , though she may drink alcohol and smoke tobacco. An assistant often lights a lamp which will be kept burning throughout the shaman's journey in the darkness below. The shaman sits down with her eyes closed and her legs stretched straight out in front of her, a posture not used at any other time since one usually sits on the floor squatting. Then , perhaps beating a steady pulse with a stick or knife, or else swishing grain around a winnowing fan , she sings a song calling on a succession of former shamans who a re now dead and are called her rauda so nums . The journey which she is about to undertake is an impossible one for ordinary people who will eventually make it once only, when they die, and with no hope of returning to their bodies. The earth and the Unde rworld are linked by a huge tree, down which the shaman must clamber. Sora also say that the path includes dizzyi ng precipices on the way down to the ' murky-sun country, cockcrow-light country (mongol-yung desa. tartar-im desa)' . In order to make this journey, the shaman's soul ' becomes' a monkey . And so, in a ~n~ or quave ring voice according to her age, she sings words like the followll1g 111 a special tune to her predecessors (text 1.2):

After some minutes of this singing, her voice peters out and her head flops down on to her breast . Her soul has now reached her husband and children in the Underworld . Bystanders, who have proba bly paid no pa rticular attention to the invocation , now rush forward in a commotion to unclench her body which has locked itself rigid . They bend her knees and lay her legs down straight again on the ground, bend her elbows, unclench her fingers and then return them , limp , to rest on her knees. Even in frail little old ladies, this clenching can defy two or three strong men for some seco nds. When her body has been loosened , the shaman sits motionless for a while. Then with a sharp intake of breath her ha nd passes over her mouth and the sonum of her immediate predecessor, her closest rauda , begins to si ng her own tune in reply and to speak as mistress of ceremonies. The ra ud a then leads on a succession of the dead , each of whom demands a drink on arrival a nd maybe a smoke too. The dialogue now begins . Shamans of either sex acquire their ability to perform by marrying a special kind ofsonum, called tlda , in the Underworld (see chapter 3). Men, if they are to become shamans in either tradition , generally acquire their vocation in adult life; but women start to become shamans at a very early age, usually around seven or eight years old .

that it a mo unts to a kind of drea min g to order: unlike the body o f a sleeper, the sha ma n's vacated body is not left idle but is put to use on clients' behalf. In terms of a compara tive typology of shamani sm vel'sus spirit possession (e.g. de He usch 198 1) the kUl'an is per haps hard to place in that whil e her so ul is sa id to travel during trance to the Underworld , she does not send back messages about her own doings there but simply acts as a cha nnel through which the dead speak for th emse lves. In th e revised edition of hi s epo nymous survey of 'shamani sm' , E liade devoted some space to th e So ra (1964: 421 - 7, usin g Elwin (1955) as hi s source). In talking a bout the IWl'an 's journey to the Underworld , the Sora do indeed use ima gery , such as a ladder or tree linking cosmological leve ls, which corresponds closely to that widely documented by Eliade and considered by him to be among the cla ssic defining features of 'shamanism' (E li ade 1964). However, the interest of the Sora lies not in the typological status of their practice, intriguing though this may be. In this book I shall focus not on the shaman but on her clients, not on her own experience but on the way she helps lay persons to live their own lives . In doing this, I shall reverse a widespread approach which leads Eliade, for example, to see 'shamanism' as a 'mysticism', ' at the disposal of a particular elite' (1964: 8). Given the shaman's need for an audience even to unclench her body and the fact that a trance takes place only in order to summon the ancestors of that same audience, her experience can have meaning only to the extent that it is in some sense shared by laymen. The format of dialogue ensures that lay people share in the shaman's activity but that they do so from their own perspective, which is a complementary one. Moreover, in making the extension from dream to trance, the Sora are showing us quite clearly that for them specialisation is a question of degree: the shaman's activity and experience are a specialised form of those of any other member of the society. In cha pter 4 and throughout this book, I shall link this question of degrees of specialisation to the ordinary conversational tone of dialogues with the dead. For the moment , I suggest that we think of the kUl'an's practice not as ' shamanism' but as 's hamanship '. I take this term from Atkinson, who defines it as ' the art or skill of performing as a shaman' (1989 : 17). Writing of the Wana of Sulawesi, she uses this term in the context of competition between performers who 'must strive to achieve ... recognition of their shamanic claims' (Atkinson 1989: 17). Though the Sora recognise better and worse shamans (one shaman I knew was known for the rest of his life as 'Oops!' [Gege] because a crab he was hiding for a conjuring trick popped out of his pocket before its cue), their vocation is

not seriou sly in doubt. But there is another helpful resonance to the E ngli sh word 's hamanship '. L ike craftsmanship or musicianship , this is a ta lent or inclinat ion as much as a n act ivity a nd is spread variously a mong pe rso ns, who practise it to varying degrees . Many people know and can even reproduce the words of a shaman's invocation but are simply unable to make them work as performances, that is, to act out their implications fully. Most people a re ab le to perform various rites, for example to protect cattle or trees from so rcery, and every man ca n make minor offerings to his own patrilineal ancestors. Villages genera lly also have a hereditary male buy a, who conducts harvest festival s for the village Kidtung, a creator so num and villa ge guardian (this corresponds broadly to a widespread Indian pattern of a so ber pries thood co ntrasted with a performance based o n trance, e.g. Dumont 19 59; Berrema n 1964; Babb 1975). There is also a hereditary siga, the village funeral pyre-li ghter. Though such peo ple do not marry in the Underworld or go into trance, they all receive their abilities by succession and with the aid of the sonums of their predecessors. Anyone performing any of these actions is at that time called kuran, the noun which I have already glossed in its pal' excellence vocational sense as 'shaman '. Most importantly for my own fieldwork, each patrilineage has several men and women called 'Ancestor-Men' (ida i-mal') and 'Ancestor-Women' (idai-boj) . Ancestor-Women are women who were born into the lineage a nd still live in it, and are therefore either unma rried girls or else widows or divorcees who have returned from elsewhere. It is they who strip, wa sh and dress a corpse, male or female. Whatever the relationship, 'now there's no embarrassment' (nami garoj tid) . It is they who pour water on the ashes to 'cool' the deceased when the pyre ha s died down ; and it is one of these Ancestor-Women who keeps the la mp burning to light the funeral shaman's way in the Underworld . Ancestor-Men are also members of the linea ge, me n of suitable talent and temperament, who for several hours sing, dance a nd mime the various stages and procedures of the funeral. Like the shamans in trance, Ancestor-Women and Ancestor-Men fast , consuming only alcohol a nd tobacco for one day (during the 'stone-planting' sta ge ofa funeral) or three days (during the kmja, the a nnual festival of the dead and harvest-commemoration) . In this wa y, somewhat like the shaman, they move 'close' (a 'dam) to the sonums: 'they become the Ancestors, so to speak' (idaienji gadtlteji amrid). At the end, before they can safely eat any of the sacrificed meat, they likewise pass through a careful 'making healthy' (ab -suka-) rite to bring them back among the living. I was grateful for the existence of the role of Ancestor-Man as a half-way

T he problem wa s not so much that sha man s were unwilling. So,:a have ways of keeping o ther known ethn ic groups at arm's length, but my presence there was so unprecede nted that anyt hin g mi ght pe rhaps have been possible. Shama ns themselves did eventua ll y encourage me to work as their assistant rather than sim ply to observe and record. (My friend Kantino saw another way for me to get involved: 'Why don 't you marry the shama n - it would be a perfect match. She' ll go into tra nce, you' ll write it down! ' [Kuranbojen orl/llga - tamte. Anin m erte, amen idoltem. My inabili ty to become a full sha man was due to a combination of my own difficulties with language and faith , as well as to my la ck of loca l co ntext.

Like any Sora, my experiences were made possible, and my own biography developed , by talking to the dead as well as to the living.

The Sora people
A 'tribe' in Hindu India
The Sora (also sometimes written So:ra:, Saora, Savara, etc.) number around 452,000 1 and are officially designated a 'scheduled tribe'. This is a heterogeneous administrative category derived from a combination of nineteenth-century ethnology and the pigeon-holing imperative of the census. It is used for around 40 million people in India (38 million in 1971: Raza and Ahmad 1990: 6) who are anomalous for reasons of language or occupation, or else marginal geographically or economically. Many, though not all, of these 'tribals' are assumed to be aboriginal and to predate the arrival in India of Aryan and Dravidian populations; they are also widely thought to be somehow not fully Hindu . The Sora fit most, if not all, of these criteria . They have long been at the outer edge of various kingdoms and other administrative divisions. They live largely by shifting cultivation (slash-and-burn agriculture) and relate to the world of markets as purveyors of shifting-cultivation crops and wild forest produce. Above all, their linguistic connections lie ultimately with southeast Asia. Linguists classify the Sora language as belonging to the Munda group, which includes some other Indian 'tribal' languages such as Mundari, Ho, Santal and Bondo; while they consider this group itself to be a branch of the Austroasiatic family which includes Mon-Khmer languages such as Cambodian, as well as many of the languages of the interior of the Malay peninsula and of the Montagnard peoples of Vietnam (Pinnow 1959; Zide 1966).2 Though there are historical uncertainties, this suggests that such peoples form an ancient stratum of the population across tropical Asia who in each country have been surrounded and dispossessed by larger, settled rice-growing popula tions. Certainly, some Sora faces look southeast Asian and the flavour of Sora

culture often seems reminiscent of the linguistically related peopl es described by Howell (1984) , Benjamin (1967) or Co ndomina s (1965, 1974). Yet at the sa me time, contact with surrounding popula tions is longsta nding and comp lex a nd many aspects of So ra culture a lso seem close to village H indui sm as described by Whitehead (1 92 1), Babb (197 5) or Herren schmidt (1989). As one walks or cycles out of the mountainous So ra heart land into the plains beyond, it is imposs ible to say quite where the fl avour of Sora culture end s. The ethnic environment of the Sora is cos mopolitan . To the northea st live the 'Hindu' Oriya population who speak a language of the Indo-Aryan family and to the south live the 'Hindu' Telugu , belonging to the Dravidian family. To the northwest live the Khond or Kond who , though they speak a Dravidian language, are also considered ' tribal' and whose culture is in many ways similar to Sora. The Sora sometimes think of themselves as adiv(lsi, a pan-Indian term for ' tribal ' which sometimes has radical political overtones, though my impression is that they learned this term in the tea gardens of Assam, where they sometimes go to earn cash and work alongside members of other central Indian 'tribes'. The Sora in this study also refer to themselves as 'Hindu' (indu) in opposition to the enclaves of missionised Christian (kir/un) Sora in their midst. The Sora perceive themselves as falling into several main divisions . The Sora groups in the plains, such as the Sarda (,clean') and Kapu (,cultivator') Sora, live by various occupations and resemble their casteHindu neighbours more or less closely. These groups remain virtually unstudied . The Sora with whom I lived call themselves the Lanjia Sora and are also known variously as Lamba-Lanjia , Jedu ('wild'), Mone, and Arsi (,monkey'). The approximate distribution of the Lanjia Sora is shown on figure 2.1 (though this entire region is heavily infiltrated by a number of castes and representatives of government agencies). The word 'Sora' in this book refers to these Lanjia Sora, who by any criterion can be considered the most isolated and 'tribal' of any Sora group. They straddle the mountainous border between Ganjam District and Koraput District in Orissa , an area to this day made inhospitable to visitors by virulent malaria . I lived mostly in the Sora villages within a few miles of Puttasing, a settlement on the Koraput side which contains some assorted officials but is inhabited mainly by Pano (Dom) , a Christianised group of Oriya Harijans who live throughout tribal Orissa by trading with the tribals and lending them money at high interest. Lanjia Sora territory comprises a series of mountains rising to 3,000 ft. It is bounded to the north by the Khond hills and on the other three sides by

plains o r rive r valleys. A t the foot of the hills lie the lowns ofGunlipur a nd Parlakhemundi (Parlakimidi), co ntaining a diversity of Oriya and Telu gu casles as well as Sarda a nd Kap u Soras. For lo ng the seats ofTelliga rajas, the towns now act as admini st ra tive headq uarters a nd the main commercia l focusses o f the area . To the So ra they are a world of police and cl erks armed with guns a nd bteracy , of metal-workers, bu s-sta nds, cemen t hou ses and loud speakers blaring film music over bazaars where the flare of kerosene lamps a fter dark falls on piles of plastic trinkets and bales of cloth brightl y co lo ured with sy nthet ic dyes. This is a world which most So ra find both rep ul sive a nd fa scinating, but overall deeply intimidating. The pa th out of Gunupur towards the Lanjia Sora hills leads through fields of paddy a nd irri gated vegetables by the river Vamsadhara and past a village of Sard a Sora s. From these one cro sses the desolate fla t area where Gunupur cuts its firewood. Once fores ted, thi s is now furrowed with deeply

eroded gullies of red earth. Abo ut six miles on, after a little climbing through a fairly bare land scape, one wa lks into laltar (in Sora: Ya ltab), a village conta inin g Soras who accord in g to perspective may be ca lled ei ther Sarda or La nji a and who live side by sid e with a number of administrative officers and se ttlers of various castes. Thi s is the scene of the weekly market through which a large quantity of Sora produce leaves the hills beyond , bound for the plains. After a further six miles, up two steep passes and past severa l wholly Lanjia Sora villages, one comes to Puttasing (in Sora : G udangsin g, ' Level Village') , a sma ller sett lemen t almost exclusively of some 400 Pa no a long with a few Pa ik traders and some gove rnment employees, but no Soras. Here, surrounded by a small er area of eroded firewood copp ice (the Sora go far into the forest for their wood), a re the la st sma ll police stat ion , dispensary , post office, a nd primary school. A simila r picture hold s for the route from Parlakimidi via Gumma to the gove rnment outpost of Serango (in Sora: Serung). This is more developed as there is a surfaced road along which buses ply, thou gh the road to Puttasing is due to be surfaced likewise. There are other similar outposts on all sides along paths reaching past weekly markets at the foot of hills almost into the centre of Sora territory . Between these outposts the mountainous hea rtland , populated exclusively by Soras, is not more than a few miles across . During the years I have known the area, non-Sora immigration into these outposts appears to have increased noticeably. As one draws away from Gunupur, certain contrasts appear between the Sora and the peoples of the plain. Many of the Oriya and Telugu castes, and even the Sarda Soras, have comparatively long-limbed, dark, often almost ebony-skinned bodies and their men ha ve a strong beard growth and hairy legs 'like a bear' (saluan amrid) . By contrast, the Lanjia Sora have shorter bodies, sometimes with a light reddi sh-brown skin, rounder faces, often with distinctly southeast Asian fea tures, no bea rd growth and very little body hair. Among both men and women, the chest is usually bare when they are among their own kind. For men , the ankle-length lungi, dhoti or trousers of the plains give way to a cream-coloured homespun co tton loincloth exposing thin muscular thighs and buttocks or increasingly these days, to market-bought khaki shorts. Whereas women in the plains wear saris, often brightly coloured, Sora women wear a knee-length wraparound skirt, which is either homespun in cream or market-bought in black. Instead of the vivid colours of plastic and nylon, virtually all artefacts in Sora homes have the colour of the earth, stone or dried vegetation from which they were made. Sora women wea r none of the masca ra or other cosmetics of the pla ins, though the faces of both women

and to a lesser exten t men have perm a nent ta ltoos , dyed with the juice of an indigo -coloured berry. The bri ghtest colours are those of their jewellery in bra ss, silver, aluminium, gold and co loured glass, all made in the plains by Hindu castes usin g a technology of fire which remains a mystery to the Sora; brass waterpots, though only in wealthier homes; and the red patterned bands in vegetable dye, used deliberately sparin gly on the borders of homespun loincloths and skirts. Even in the markets the Sora choose cloth of kha ki , black, whi te or da rk bl ue and the merchan ts ca tel' for them accordingly . The Sora comme nt on the limited use of bright colour in their earth and vegetation-tinted world: red (je) is the colour of blood and fire, and a dream of the red borders on clothing presages bloodshed or a violent death . Freer use of bright colours is associated with the plains: to wear flowers or coloured cloth on one's person is to invite an attack by Ruga-boj ('Smallpox-Woman'), a sonum of the plains whom they identify with the goddess Durga or Thakurani. I was first inspired to study the Sora through reading Elwin's account of them in his book The religion of an Indian tribe (1955). It was this work which made the Sora widely known among both anthropologists and students of comparative religion (cf. Eliade 1964). The importance of religion in Sora life is obvious to any observer and Sora rites and 'spirits' already feature prominently in the earlier accounts by Fawcett (1888), Thurston (1909) and Sitapati (1938-43). Elwin's account of Sora religion has since been widely paraphrased in India (in Bose (1972) and in many popular magazine articles). It is clear that Elwin was fascinated and moved by the Sora . His book is long and at first sight appears exhaustive, but is ultimately disappointing. Dumont (1959: 60- 74) and Turner (1967) each wrote substantial review articles. Both lamented the accumulation of description which, since it lacks order, tantalises and ultimately overwhelms the reader. Though they each responded to the exciting nature of Elwin's material, each with a different emphasis pinpointed the source of his own disappointment. Dumont tried to puzzle out the place of the Sora within India as a whole, while Turner tried to find a connection between Sora rites and social structure. Dumont has presented his overview of India in his book Homo hierarchicus (1980 [1966]). This portrays India as a whole made up of subordinate parts (the various 'castes'), tightly interlocked in a mutual dependence which is at one and the same time functional (via their specialised occupations), political (through the system's organising principle of hierarchy) and above all religious, in that the high status of the
The Sora people 29
Brahmin depends on an intrinsic, hereditary ritual purity, and the lower statu s of othe rs on a corresponding degree of uncl ea nness. Thou gh thi s model ha s not been supplanted by a nythin g of equal weight, it raises many problems and has bee n widely criticised . For exa mple Parry (1974 , 1979) drew atten tion to a wid espread co untervailin g principle of ega litariani sm; and while the model is apparently designed to account for low castes, it is unable to accommod a te the tribal s, who constitute an important , distinctive and highly varied section of the Indian population . Dumont pays scant attention to tribal et hnography and hi s main discussion of it, coincidentally, is probably in his review (19 59: 60- 74) of Elwin's book. He was frustrated at his inability to place the Sora clearly within his hierarchical and monolithic model of India. On the one hand , he concludes that the Sora are 'autonomous' (Dumont 1959: 61) and ' not Hindus' because they 'do not imitate the Hindus in the recognition of impurity. They do not submit directly to the scheme of Hindu values' (Dumont 1959: 61). Yet on the other hand , they cannot be considered 'a bsolutely alien to Hinduism' since 'the relation of the SaOl-as [sic] with their spirits is achieved through marriage of their shamans with some of the Hindu dead, considered of higher rank and greater power than their own' (Dumont 1959: 66). I do not propose to discuss the Soras' relation to Hinduism at length in this book, reserving tlus for a later work.) Rather than finding an inside-outside model of tribal-Hindu relations, the reader who knows other parts of India will notice a variety of ways in which the Sora sometimes ignore ideas and images from mainstream Indian culture, sometimes take them over and recombine them in original ways. Beneath the immediate phenomenon of dialogues with the dead we seem to be witnessing another ancient and continuing dialogue between the Sora and their wider Indian environment. From Dumont's perspective, looking from the summit downwards, there would be no place for this kind of debate since the ethnographic situation of the moment could be little more than a failed model. But what Dumont presents amounts to only one indigenous model , that of the Brahmins, and it is only one actor's viewpoint among several possible ones. For the Sora, this limitation would be ironic since they prefer if anything to play with certain ksatriya values . This kind of play is open-ended and invites continuous re-evaluation of its object. The Sora do not try to 'inlitate' the outside world but respond to it with a more or less self-conscious commentary which sometimes amounts to parody, as with Pubic-Haired Sompa, the ambiguously Sora-Hindu foundress of shamanism who will appear in the next chapter.



30 Dialogues 11'ith the dead
For Turner the Africanist, the interest of the Sora wa s quite different. He was frustrated at Elwin's lack of sociological data which would have allowed him to grasp the relationship of the rites descr ibed to the Sora patrilineage. In his introduction, Elwin had written baldly: 'The most remarkable thing about the orga nisation of Saora society is its lack of organization' (Elwin 19 55: 50), and the remainin g 500 pa ges, rather oddly, discuss a religion based on ancestors with virtually no reference to kinship. There is simply no concept of the lineage and little explicit data with which the reader could construct such a concept. Nonetheless, by detective work from Elwin's raw descriptions Turner was able to draw some inferences about the uneasy position of married women between lineages and also about the foundation of shamanship in fantasy incest (Turner 1967: 192-4). These interpretations, as far as he was able to take them, will generally be borne out in the present book. Turner also sensed the possible solidarity, cutting across the lineage, of groups of cross-cousins (1967: 193, though cross-cousins do not as he suggested form residential groupS).4 There is another serious problem in Elwin's book which was not noted by reviewers but is central to the concern of the present work . Despite his own Anglican background (Elwin 1964) and his undeniable theological and literary sensitivity, Elwin translates 'sonum' indiscriminately as 'god', 'deity' and 'spirit' (Elwin 1955 : e.g. xxi, xxiii), a casualness which led Turner at one point into a fruitless speculation about the differences between 'spirits' and 'gods' as agents of affliction (Turner 1967: 186).5 As much as the absence of sociological perspective, it is this which renders The religion of an Indian tribe an ultimately baffling account of a religion. What is the point of sonums? The reader emerges from Elwin's account unable to understand what a sonum is, or why for the Sora they exist and are tolerated. The picture given is a gloomy one in which the dead oppress the living unremittingly . I shall argue that the two questions of sociology and theology are not separate: a sonum's power is derived at the same time both from its theological attributes and from its position in social organisation. Seen in this way, sonums also playa constructive role. So far as the fact of death will allow - a profoundly theological consideration - they give to the living as much as they take from them. Historically, the evidence suggests that the Sora have been squeezed into their present enclave from a much wider area. Many villages along the coast from the Mahanadi valley well into Andhra Pradesh have Sora names but few if any 'Sora' inhabitants. The Sora did not appear to practise human sacrifice and so did not attract the righteous British campaigns which were waged against the neighbouring Khond (Campbell 1864; Macpherson
The Sora people 31
1865; Padel 1987). Nonetheless th e Puttasing area was brought und er government rule in 1864-6 by an expedit ion ary force which executed and transported Sora resistance leaders a nd esta bllshed a permanent Pollce presence (Se na pati and Sa hu 1966: 72) . Thereafter, the area has been sLlspended in permanent marginality between various distant cen tres (Elwin 1955 : preface; Bell 1945) . F or much of the colonial period, this entire region lay at the far north ernmost tip of the vast Madras Presidency. But the Sora live on the very boundary between the north and sOLlth Indian culture areas and this is now appropriately reflected in their division between two of India's modern states. If they go down the mountain one way, they enter the Indo-Aryan world of the Oriya -speaking state of Orissa ; if they go down the other side , they find themselves in the Telugu-speaking, Dravidian state of Andhra Pradesh. 6 Even within the state of Orissa which now encompasses most of their territory, the Sora people live on either side of the border between the di stricts of Ganjam and Koraput . On the Ganjam side they were ruled in the British period through Oriya middlemen of Paik (Warrior) caste and ksatriya varna; and on the Koraput side through Sora village Headmen (gomang , also meaning 'rich man'), who were appointed by the British and collected revenue for the raja of Jeypore . Since the 1950s, the office of Headman has been officially suspended (though in practice it remains powerful) and the area governed through local councils '(pancayat). The Soras' awareness of the outside world is considerable, though uneven (my friends were convinced that I could not safely invite them to my country since I would be unable to restrain my fellow-countrymen from eating them). The Sora have been pushed to the edges of a world, the other parts of which have a greater bureaucratic, economic and cultural complexity than they have themselves . They interact with this world in highly specific and limited ways. The Sora see themselves as surrounded by a range of life forms, from monkeys, pythons and plants to rajas and policemen. Each of these has its own jati (race or species). But there are possibilities of merging and equivalence between these. Animals' souls are a substitute for human souls in sacrifice; dead Soras become part of the soul of their living descendants'crops; shamans in trance become monkeys when they clamber down to the Underworld; the Lanjia (also Arsi , 'monkey') Sora as a whole are monkeys because they are a jungle people whose men wear loincloths with a long tail; and Sora shamans marry ksatriya sonums in the Underworld and themselves become ksatriya after death . In the same way, the lineage is exogamous and Lanjia Soras in the hills also sometimes marry other kinds of Sora from the plains; while terms

like Jedu and Sarda are not absolute but relative , implying respectively uphill and downhill , of the jungle and of the cultivated landsca pe. Since around the 1920s many young Sora have gone to pick tea in Assam , some 600- 900 miles away , usually for a year a t a time, and thi s is also a common way of escaping for a while from an embarra ssin g situation at home. In recent years they have also worked on road building projects in the North -Ea stern Frontier Agency (N E FA) area . Here and in Assam they meet members of many other tribes , learn some Hindi as a lingua./i'anca and live, according to their own account, in a strange, casteless frontier society. Mengalu , whom we shall meet below, was bombed during the last war while working as a labourer for the British in Burma. This migrant labour helps to integrate the Sora into the Indian cash economy . So too does their extensive sale of produce to local Panos and traders of other castes who come up from the plains to the weekly markets . Sora villa ges and households have trading rela tionships and long-running debts with specific Panos, who also exert effective control over the pancayats and act as interpreters and go-betweens in the Soras' dealings with government employees. These relationships are characterised by mutual insult and distaste, at the same time as having something of a jajmGni flavour of mutual dependence. The Sora incur debts especially for the buffalos which they sacrifice to their dead and which they say cannot be bred in the Sora hills. The moneylenders manage these debts at high rates of interest in such a way that they can rarely be paid off, while the Sora sell their produce at low prices in a climate of intimidation which is often crudely physical. In addition, while local traders manage their Sora partners shrewdly with a long-term perspective, some government officers who are sent against their will to this remote area on 'punishment posting' extort huge sums during their short stay on a hit-and-run basis. Sora wealth is based on a manipulation of these outside forces which is often played defensively, as well as on the ownership of the region's limited paddy land, which yields much higher profits than the slash-and-burn plots on which most of the population rely.7 The Headmen and their close lineal relatives control much of this paddy land and other Soras often criticise them for the exploitation of their fellow-villagers, most of whom are their own relatives. But a strong Headman's clique is also able to resist the intense pressures of outsiders seeking political control and financial gain within the communities (I have discussed the topics in these paragraphs at length in Vitebsky 1978a, 1978b). Clearly, the Soras' political position with regard to neighbouring ethnic
The Sora people 33
groupS is not a strong one. But Sora c ulture is not a stripped -down culture of pove rt y, in which shamanism is Iitlle more than a compensation for helplessness; nor does it prese nt a picture of deviance and squ alor, as in F reeman 's vivid account (1979) of low life a mong low ca stes elsewhere in Ori ssa. Our fo cus on dialog ues with the dea d will lead us to see in la ter chapters how th e Sora use the politics of ethnicity in order to give to the livin g the power to compel sonums to revea l the vital relationships of causality i;l the most intimate areas of their own lives. But the ima ge ry of Brahmanical purity , so prominent in sanskriti sa tion models, features here only slightly: instead , the Sora look to forms of power appropriate to ksatriyas . In the most obvious sense, this is the brute power of the police and the military , deriving their authority from raja s and the state. The shaman's rauda-helpers are ' policemen' who can handcuff other sonums and lead them to a dialogue. But this is also power in the more insidiously coercive sense of literacy , the power to command by naming and writing. This power belongs not only to the police system but also to the techniques of the komo (Oriya karan, a caste of Kayastha scribes who are likewise ksatriya). When the rauda-helper arrives, she reassures the shaman's clients that whichever sonum is causing the trouble, 'I'll write his name, I'll inscribe his name.' Once 1 attended a divination for a sick baby in which the shaman's rauda-helper announced from the Underworld that an tlda sonum wanted the baby to bear his own name in addition to an ancestral name, as is usual. Thjs was a strange Oriya name and when the trance was over nobody could remember what it was - including the shaman , on the grounds that his soul had been absent while the rauda was speaking. After waiting a while to see what they would do , 1 suddenly 'remembered' the name by glancing down at my notes and the shaman said , teasingly, that they knew they could rely on me.
Main personalities
Just as the contrast between the Sora and others is one of degree, so the journey from the plains into the Sora heartland reveals a transition which is gradual but nonetheless perceptible. One has a sense both ofcontinuity and of entering another world. Towards the Sora heartland a distinctive landscape emerges of steep stony hills interspersed with more level areas in the valleys, some of pocket-handkerchief size, others large plains running into each other in shallow steps over one or two miles. The hills are covered with remnants of forest, patches of which are cut down for shifting cultivation, while the valley floors have been terraced into paddy-fields which sometimes climb

hig h up out of the va ll ey and reach into clefts in the hill s behind meticulou sly co nstructed stone retainin g wall s up to forty feet hi g h. From a high vantage point at certain seasons th e landscape resemb les glaciers of paddy or straw-coloured stubble flowin g round th e base of green wooded mountain s. The So ra draw a living from thi s landscape by huntin g, ga therin g, shifting a nd settled cultivation. Sora villages are located mostly a long the line where a fores ted slope meets the more leve l paddy-land , and a lways near a water supply. They are ge nera ll y ha if a mile or a mile apart, and may co nta in from approximately 50 to 500 people. Villages on valley floors a re la rge r than those on hill s, thou gh the latter a re a lmost always simil ar ly sited by some sma ll area of terraced paddy-fields. The locat ion a nd style of villages varies co nsiderab ly. I lived successively in three villages, with frequent visits to others. My first village, Rebjingtal , was a large village of about 400 people in eig ht lineages , facing a broad expanse of paddy terraces steppi ng downwards from the village. This village commands the gap at which the path coming up from Gunupur finally sp ills on to the plateau which gives access to the heartland of Sora territory. Just beh ind Rebjingtallies Puttasing, the settlement of ad mini strators and Pano traders, so that the village is extremely accessible to settlers and travellers. The Headma n lineage is large and strong, with their houses close by the road. They have tightly woven but double-edged political and economic relations with the traders of Puttasing. Further off the road and slightly uphill are the less powerful, sometimes poor , lin eages. Their rel ations with the Headman group are often disadvantageo us to them, but in other ways, since they a re less preyed upon by casual passers- by, the atmos phere in these parts seems more relaxed. The second village, which I shall not na me, lies high on a still -forested hilltop . Access is only via steep and thorny paths. There is very little paddy land up there a nd the population is small (about 100, in three lineages) with tattered clothing and a rough air. Other villages consider this village to be lethally infested with sorcery and my friends in Rebjingta l begged me for my own sake not to move there or if I must, at least not to take with me tapes containing their voices. It turned out that sorcery was indeed virulent and that it was related to occasional notorious outbreaks of murder. I suspected that these could also be linked to the acute shortage of land which leads to the area's highest rate of mig ration to Assam , as well as to several early conversions to Baptism. The case studies in the present work are taken from the third village, which I shall call Alinsing ('Wine-Village' : to simplify the place- name I

have writte n this '-sin g' in stea d of'-slIIg' ). T hi s is a large vi ll age on one side ofa va lley (l oor, with a rich , powerful Headma n and some twelve or fifteen lineages, according to one's reckoning. It includ es a section ca lled ' Lower Vill age' (lqj/a-Gorjallg) and an offs hoot about half a mil e away on the other sid e of the valley , here ca ll ed Tongseng ('Dancing Party'). Tongseng wa s form ed several generation s ago when a man of the Headman lin eage set up hou se there. His desce ndants have now multiplied to so me twenty-five hou seho lds, led by Jamano , a wealthy old man of firm cha racte r. M a ny of the events ana lysed in thi s book will reveal the growin g distance between the people of Tongseng a nd the main part of their own lineage back in Alinsing. The surro undings of Alinsing, Lower Village a nd Tongse ng are shown in chapter 4 in fi gure 4.3 a nd the combined population of these villages is around 800. In the midday heat a village is often deserted, apart from an occas io nal very old person, as everyone else has joined up into work parties and go ne off with a ll their children to the jungle or fields. In the evening and early morning, by contrast, the village is full of life. In the darkness before daw n, while the women pound grain and tend bubbling pots of millet or sorghum porridge and the children are still sprawled across the floor in sleep, the men are already walking around, wrapped in bl a nkets and calling to each other. Every m a n then sets out on a tour of the forest to collect the wine which ha s dripped out overnight from his toddy trees into a suspended pot. The sap of the alin (fishtail palm, Caryo/a U/'ens) is kept flowing by incisions made at the inflorescence of the tree . It is fermented by airborne yeasts to produce a foamin g toddy which is rich in vitamin s a nd mildly alcoholic. Except in the rainy season (July- September) when the trees stop yielding, this is harvested two or three times a day. A man's trees may be widely scattered and the nurturing of the trees a nd the gathering and drinking of wine in regul a r informal groups is the ma in focus of socia I and political life. Wine is also widely drunk by women and sometimes children .s The drinking site is a circle offlat sto nes set up as seats around a heart h . The location is at the same time sheltered and open: it may be in a clearing, or on a n outcrop backing on to a cliff a nd with a commanding view. The first man to arrive will light the fire, squinting through the acrid new smoke. Around you in the distance you can hea r the sound of bamboo flutes , all playin g, at the sa me pitch , variants of the same pentatonic melody and crossing and re-crossing each other up and down the scale. A flute comes closer and a ma n bursts in on you with a grin: 'Ai! [an ex pression of surprise] Are you thereT, and a clay pot of wine crooked over his arm on a rope of creeper bark. One by one as the men appear, they pour their wine

into a large pot set over the fire. People adjust the wood, skim off froth and in sects with a leaf and test the temperalure , shoutin g 'Warm it up some more!' or ' Quick , take it om'. When the drink is at just the right lukewarm temperature, one of the men dips in a gourd lad le and passes it to his neighbour on the right who drinks it, refills it and passes it on again. Someone may produce a snack of sa lt crystals, dried meat, or chilli. As more arrive, the conversation becomes more animated :
- Ai! Is that what he sa id? - Who did? - My shit! - Why? - No, I didn't!
There is no indirect speech construction, so that gossip comes in a form which purports to be a l'erbalil11 report: "'Why won't you come?", I said. " Because you didn't give me the grain you owed me" , she said . "Grain my shit! Didn't I give you two basketfuls the other day?" I said .. .' Opinions are moulded, areas of consensus are formed , plans are made for the day's work, for the organisation of rites and the direction of political strategies. By now the sun has risen and as the pot empties, the men set off to the village in single file , carrying additional pots for their women to drink at home and still talking vehemently . The file always stops for a moment before reaching the village: 'aiiumen dele - let's have a pee.' The circle will meet again at dusk and sometimes at midday. Women passing by will join in a circle but will not be regular attenders. Women 's occasions to talk in large groups without men are when they are collecting water at wells and springs morning and evening. A drinking circle may contain two men or a dozen. Each village has several of these, the composition of which shifts according to changes in friendship, convenience of access or fecundity of toddy trees. The core of the group will generally be a set of brothers. Other lineage members (also called 'brother') and sometimes in-laws and cousins from another lineage may also join. Any of these may split off and join up again throughout the season. Anyone passing by, even from a distant village, will be invited to join, as the standard question on a path 'Where are you going?' is answered by 'For a drink - come along.'9 A drinking circle is thus a group of men with strong patrilineal implications but sufficiently open-ended to acknowledge intimacy with any other category of person. Actual political relations encompass large

inequa lities in land, labour and productivity as well as in connections within the community and outsid e. The idea l of equa l sharin g as an expression of intim acy runs deep through the workings of any social group, whether th e actua l economic and politica l power between person s is equa l or not. Meat from sacrifices is di stributed among the lineage or branch involved, and parcels are sent to those who were unable to attend; further portions are given to visiting in-laws and cous ins and find their way as snacks to the drinking circles . Wild game, however sma ll , is shared among the entire hunting party. A find of grubs or ants is taken home to the family or out to the even ing's drinking circle. Not to do this is to be ranglw , 'greedy', or a 'carefu lly-lookin g person' , g(jg(jlllar , judgements of so litude and self-absorption which can shade into accusat ions of sorcery. Of co urse, people are torn every day between this obliga lion to share and their desire to keep things for themse lves. Thus in the parched and sweltering st illness before the monsoon, the forest loses its leaves a nd the toddy trees start to go dry or turn bitter (often , it is said, through the jealous sorcery of those whose trees have already stopped yielding). The la rger drinking circles break up and those whose trees are still productive save the precious juice only for their closest friends. Now hopeful passers-by ask about wine and are told 'We aren't getting any either - our trees have been bewitched', or 'There was a little but it's just run out - it wasn't any good anyway.' People met on the path who ask 'Where are you going?' are fobbed off with the uninviting answer 'To empty my bowels.' I remember once during this season how I set out up a mountain in the midday heat with just one other man, and how Dangdang waved us off in front of a gro up of people, saying 'See you tomorrow .' Fifteen minutes la ter, at the summit, he crossed our path with a chuckle bearing a small potful of wine which the three of us then drank with selfish enjoyment. The acceptance of such adroit and necessa ry social hypocrisy is counterbalanced by a darker awareness of the difficulty of knowing what others ' really ' (jadi) think and feel. One feels 'suspicion' (dalgad) when on the lookout for bukai, Ion 101'0 and .folda (,deceit' or 'trickery'). In certa in contexts, one's loyalties will lie with a lineage or other grouping in an obvious and uncomplicated way. However, loyalty is often not so simple. All men , and most women unless they have married in from very far away, have known each other all their lives. People are linked by such a variety of cross-cutting ties, both structural and emotional, that the alignments of oppositions and friendships shift rapidly and kaleidoscopically . There is a keen sense that in the midst of intimacy the most important psychic processes in others , namely how they feel about us, are hidden from us: ' I

speak nice-tasting words, but how can you know what's inl11 Ysoul?', as one friend put it to me . Thus, the outward display of affection can signify either itse lf o r its opposite - or most likely, some opaque mixture of the two. The potential for this uncerta inty tends to increase with closeness. It is among brothers, who li ve in and out of each ot her's houses a nd who will share their fa ther's property equally , tha t so rce ry is most likely. Perhaps the least ambivalent relati o nship is a good marriage of lon g stand in g, where a wife has moved sufficie ntl y close to her husba nd that her brothe rs are no lon ger a ble to tug her away from him . The descendants of a woman's husband and of her brothe r or sister ca ll each other 'cousin ' (marollgger, feminin e marol/set) , a nd for three generations they are also supposed to address each other as ' broth er ' and 'sister' and avoid interm a rri age. If a woman's husband and brothers overcome the mutua l jea lousy im plicit in their re lationship , then their children may indeed help eac h other and for a
while enjoy some of the close ness of siblingship without the rivalry of real siblings.
In writing now I am torn between the desire to tell the reader about all sorts of people I have known, and the need to develop a systema tic and specific exposition of how I came to understand these people's dialogues with their dead . I should have liked to talk about Inama (himself now dead), the first Sora to invite me for a drink and then take the risk of letting me into his home. La ter on, when I had already moved to my second village, I caught hepatitis a nd disappeared to a distant hospital without being able to tell anyone where I had gone. On the night I returned to Soraland three months later, it was to Inama tha t I went first. I shall never forget how he and his brother Lakkia hugged me for long minutes, then said that I was rumoured to have been murdered in a quarrel over a woman in some remote village. Inama said that he had never believed I was dead and had once dreamed that he saw me coming along the path and had actually got up in the night to have a look. On another occasion he to ld me how he had dreamed that I had gone down to Gunupur town barefoot and wearing my Sora earrings and loincloth , that I had been ridiculed there by the merchants and officials, and that he had woken weeping 'out of pity' for my humiliation.
I should have liked, also , to be able to dwell on my memory of Lakkia bathing his dangerously sick child in a pot of warm water with intense tenderness in his eyes and in every movement of his ha nds; and to talk of the many forthright young women holding out against domineering fathers or brothers for the men of their choice - ofDoimani, a young woman who as a

chil d had cl imbed ove r everyt hin g and everyone ' like a monkey ', accord ing to [nama , and who as a woman had suc h spirit that for a long time no boy dared to ask her to marry him ; and of her fri end Gosandi , a littl e girl of about eig ht with a husky voice and a coo l a ppraising ga ze through the smoke of he r ciga r, who was trainin g to be a funeral shaman. I remembe r M ejeru , an eld er ly and skinny man, bald with a frin ge at the back a nd a cau lifiower nose, a grea t dancer, sin ger a nd joker. One day on a hillside we came across some wild fruit which had been gathered by some o ld women and then left in baskets unattended. Mejeru placed some large stones in the ba skets undern ea th the fruit a nd wa ited gigglin g behind a tree for the puzzled look o n the women's faces when they returned and tried to lift their baskets. I remember these o ld women and many like them with their wrinkled bod ies a nd gross , throwaway humour ; a nd Sirdoro, a n o ld Headman who in the 1940s had ensl a ved fifty of hi s fellow villagers for debt and who used to be carried a lon g the stony mountain pa th s on a litter like a petty raja , a man who by a ll accounts mu st have been ex tremely cruel ('he was begotte n by a leopard o r a viper ') but who appeared to me now only as an ineffectua l old rogue (,gradually he mellowed: it's in hi s so ul but he has n't the power '). I remember too how Inama and his brothers sent their children to live with me when I first had a house of my own beca use ' it's not good to live a lone'; and I remember other children throughout my stay who would seek me out when I was sitting somewhere in solitude and ask me if my soul was sad because of the people I'd left behind at home. I was comforted by this a nd by the constant solicitude over cuts and thorns in my feet and enq uiries about whether I rea lly did not mind certain kinds of food; a nd by the open invitations which a llowed me eventually to dispense with running a house of my own and to walk anywhere across Sora territory (where there are no shops or cafes) without baggage, money (which people would not accept) or a ny plan for the nig ht. I shall not, however, be able to do justice to most of these people here. Given that my argument will often be in terms of such intan gibles as mood, nua nce a nd tone of voice, I ha ve decid ed to build it firml y on a limited number of specific cases, eve nts and texts . I have been furth er constrained by the loss a t the very end of my fieldwork of a large number of tapes which were in a bag stolen at a Madras bus-stand (and no doubt immedi ately overlaid with film music for cut-price resale). Accordingly, I shall build this book aro und the lives of three men in Alinsing whom I knew well a nd whose affa irs intertwine and are documented in detail in the surviving ta pes.

a nd with hi s memory, hi s improvisa tory flair and hi s humour he is the natural lea der of the dancing and chantin g whether for hi s own lineage or for the entire village. Mengalu is a t once the life and so ul of the party a nd a loner, capa bl e ofspending days at a time in so litude on the hill side , herdin g a few cows or co llecting roots. He is also ambitious, but in a disorganised way which ha s never allowed him to prosper. He has four wives in two houses, with six surviving children , but the family wears no go ld and have a somewhat down-at-heel air. He is also unfortunate. About ten years before I arrived (i. e. in the late I 960s), he gave way to an enviou s impulse in an act for which he has been paying ever since. His father's brothers, Urung and Poke, had acquired some land jointly. When Poke died without heirs his other land was shared between Mengalu's and Raduno's line, but thi s land was inherited by Raduno alone on the grounds that hi s father had bee n the only other partner in it. However, Mengalu was trying to build himself up through polygamy and needed more land . Besides this , he had several sons who would need to inherit his land while Raduno had only two daughters . It appears that Mengalu hired a professional sorcery-assassin from another village to kill Raduno and his dependants by the standard technique of burying a pot containing their discarded toothbrushing sticks, excrement, soil from their footprints, etc., along with the remains of a tortured black chicken trussed up in thread and a head of rice similarly twisted and bound . Such a pot is supposedly buried at night on a hillside to the accompaniment of sung dialogues (kata) and a pantomime enacted by the professional assassin and his clients (both exclusively male roles and called 'sorceryman', tonaj-mar) and remains effective so long as it is not dug up. But Mengalu was indiscreet, rumours spread and Raduno intimidated the assassin into confessing and digging up the pot, which was displayed in the village with great publicity and embarrassment for Mengalu. This is one of the cases, perhaps rare, in which sorcery is actually done by a sorcerer rather than merely imagined by the victims, and I personally believe that Mengalu has never done it again . But though he is not the only such suspect in the village , we shall see that there is scarcely a death in Alinsing over which the possibility of his sorcery is not at least aired. Ironically, Mengalu and Raduno are now the best of friends again. Partly, though their personalities are very different, they were friends in childhood and still feel a liking for each other. Rad uno , who is several years younger, has a fond memory from his childhood of how Mengalu returned from Burma and washed him with the first soap ever seen in the area. But also , a degree of cooperation is inevitable among closely related lineage

Saga/o
Sagalo is a sweet and gentle yo uth whose father has been dead for some years. In early 1977 hi s 'orpha n-house' (kundra-s/I1g) a lso conta ined hi s widowed mother (a sister of Mengalu) who has not rema rri ed, hi s unmarried elder siste r a nd his little brothe r Mando . They are a poor family in a sma ll and poor linea ge (actually the Buya linea ge, custodians o f the village Kidtung so num and supposedly the original settlers) an d so are without padd y- fields or substantial political influence. When I first knew him , Sagalo was preparing to perform a funeral stone-planting for his third-generation cousin (marongger) , a ma n from Rungrungba village called Sunia. Such a funeral is supplementary to the one which will a lready have been performed in Rungrungba by Sunia 's own lineage, a nd is by no means obligatory (cf. chapter 3) . But Sunia had been a man of influence and though the connection was an old one, Sagalo was anxious to reta in it, despite the expense of the funeral. It was open to Menga lu to be a close ally of this fatherless family since he was a mother's brother living in the same village. But in 1977 this was not the case. Sagalo's little brother M a ndo had bee n suffering for a year from a painful di sease which twisted his body and shortly after my arrival he died . The following morning I a ttended the inquest (abgijte), in which the ghost of the deceased is questioned about the circumstances and causes of his death . It was the first time I had attended an inquest since knowing enough of the la nguage and the people to follow something of wha t was going on. Listening now to the tape-reco rding, I see from preliminary conversations among bysta nders that it was already inev itable th a t the trance should give a verdict ofMengalu's sorcery (for this kind of process in detail , see chapter 5). The rea so n given for the sorcery was tha t Sagalo had sed uced the girlfriend of Mengalu's son Sargia. In reve nge Mengalu was supposed to have performed so rcery against him . But since the so ul of the youth Sagalo was strong and resilient, the sorcery ricochetted off it on to the more delicate one of the little boy and killed him instead .

During the inquest the grief of the boy 's mot her and sister was combined with a towerin g rage aga inst Menga lu (who chose to be absent, Ju st as he will do during ano ther inquest in chapter 5). Saga lo sat silent and , I a m sure, wretched with remorse . So the stone-pla nting originally pla nned as a diploma tic co urtesy for a distant cross-cousin beca me a dou ble funeral and something a lto ge ther more tragic as two stones were planted and tw~ buffalos sacrificed, one for the distant, elde rl y Sunl a and one for Saga lo s
beloved little brother Mando. By the time I returned in ea rl y 1979, Saga lo's life had improved. The disputed girlfriend had married elsew here outside the village and Saga ~ o had married Panderi , a woman from Lower Village. They seemed deeply 111 love a nd very happy together. She was a strong-minded woman fr om a well-placed family . Her brothers had arra nged a suitabl e formal marriage (pangsal) for her with someone else a nd had sea led the contract by dl'lnklllg the suitor's wine. But Panderi refused the proposed groom and bought herself out of the contract by paying him the necessary fine out of her own resources . After living with another ma n for a while, she had eventu ally come to Sagalo by the poor person's form of marriage, mutua l free choice or ' love ma rri age' (dari). Panderi 's brothers objected to this ma tch on the grounds of his poverty and reinforced their case by pointing to his di sta nt relationship, that of a third-generation cross-co usin (here, a descendant of a sister of their lineage), with whom marriage should not be allowed . But the third generation is the last point at which a cross-cousin relationship is recognised. As with Sunia, who stood in an identical relationship to Sagalo, it is somewhat open by this stage how far one cultivates or ignores the connection. Panderi defied her brothers and the birth in 1978 of her baby boy, Sagalo's lineal descendant, seemed to indicate the final defea t of the still rumbling opposition of her brothe rs. By this time too, only two years after Mando's dea th , good relations with Mengalu had been restored . Mengalu was a frequent visitor to his sister's hou se a nd helped her and his young nephew in various ways in their dea lings with the world . This apparently com fortable resolution of ea rlier hostilities will be dramatically tested in chapters 7 and 8, as we see the impact on all concerned ofPanderi's sudden tragic death.

T he people here belon g ent irely to one branch of the A lin sing Headman lin eage whose ancestor moved out of A lin sin g seve ra l generation s ago. He is the natural lea der of Tongseng, combinin g se ni ority with strength of character, d ignity and wea lth . He runs a large househo ld in a g rand style, where plenty of go ld is worn . To do th is, it is necessary to have the labour of severa l wom en li ving at home, a pattern cha rac teristic of wealthy, prominent men. Jamano has had several wives who have now died, but also retains severa l of ILis sisters and grown-up dau ghte rs, women who either do not marry or who reverse the usual virilocal pattern a nd bring poor husba nds home as their dependants . In either case, such women bear children who do not belong to ot her men's lineages but who swe ll the ra nks of the women's own nata l lineage . Women's motives for doing this a re mi xed: so me are unwilling to leave the co mfo rt a nd co mpa ny of a ho use with many women (thi s is the main reason , too , why a man' s second wife is often welcomed by the first) , but others a re held pri so ne r by a dominant male. As someone once explained to me about Jam a no:
How did 1a ma no get rich? Through his unmarri ed sisters. His father was a n unimportant man. In those days Guranda was th e ri ch one, because of all his sisters! 1a mano's sister Kusumai was bea utiful. A man from Basara village came to ask for her. Kusumai wanted him but th e others wouldn ' t drink bis wine , they smashed the pot and bea t him. They wouldn't give him a knife to work with [on their la nd , i.e. as bride-service by a yo un g man for hi s father-in-law). We gave him o ne and later they scolded us very fiercely: 'You give away your d a ught er then, you feed the Basara man! ' Then th e men of Basara kidnapped bel', but 1amano raised a big party and went to ge t her back. They bro ught her back agai nst her will. Later, th e ma n of Ganuren vill age kidnapped her. Our men then went to Ga nuren, beat up their Headman and brought her back aga in. But Kusumai wasn't in love with the Ganuren m an a nyway, the way she had been with tbe Basara man , a nd she pined to death soon a fter - thou gh they say the Basara people killed her o ff with sorcery . 1amano tri ed to hang o n to he r sister 1enggi too but she to ok no notice (a 'dere) a nd just went ofr with her lo ver [i .e. in a dari marr iage).

The formation of the Sora person
Gradual transformations in the journey from birth to death and beyond In the last chapter I presented a group of my friends on their landscape. This chapter will begin to explore the Soras' own account of their interpersonal relationships by examining their understanding of how a person is formed. The idea of formation or shaping is expressed by an imagery of craftsmanship which surrounds the start of a child's life. Western psychologies tend to presuppose an intrinsic essence of the person which then 'grows', 'develops', 'unfolds' or 'matures' as it is 'socialised' into the company of others. But despite the existence of Sora words for human consciousness at various stages of being alive and dead, what we shall see here and in later chapters is not simply a person who is a unitary entity which embarks on a process of development during which it confronts other, similar entities. Rather, the person appears more as a confluence whjch comes together only on the basis of its relationship to other beings who are themselves equally changing. Just as persons and other entities radiate something of themselves out to others, so they seem to be hard to bring and hold together: their constituent elements tend to drift away again and go towards the formation of other entities. The Sora account presupposes that some part or aspect of the person persists after an event called 'death' (k-er-enid, the noun from kenid-, 'die') and that it then assumes a powerful effect upon the living. The dead are thus causal agents, but what they exert cannot simply be called an 'influence', since they themselves are also changed by their encounters with the living. During the course of his existence the person is considered to pass through
several stages. Though some rites of passage are prominent, no chang~ is immediate and definitive. Rather, the new state takes hold only gradually against the persistence of the previous state. I shall outline these changes

briefly under the following head in gs: birth and childhood ; adolescence and marriage ; and from firsl dea th on ea rth to second dea th in the Underworld.
Birth alld childhood
Birth is the outcome of a comp licated process in which Sora say that the baby is formed by the sonum of the Sun (UYllllg-Sl/l1 , 'S un -S onum') and then grad ua ll y sepa rated from the mother's body (see below). The birth itself is only the first step towards separation and the dependence on the umbilica l cord is echoed through breast-feeding which la sts for around three years. Soon after birth, a patrilineal ancestor of the same sex causes a fever(aslI) in the baby and in a subsequent divination promises the baby hi s or her name. The Ancestor-Men tie a fin ger- ring, sa id to have been saved from that ancestor's funeral, round the baby's wrist (ab~ii-ell -, ' [cau sat ive particleJ-tie-ring'). The ancestor und er takes to protect the baby from attacks by other sonums and in return receives a sacrifice of a chick en . This is a promi se of a buffalo at a big name-giving ceremony (ab -iillll-Oll , '[causative particleJ-name-child') to be staged two or three years later when the child is fully weaned . At that point the ancestor will definitively give his name to the child and the Ancestor-Men will untie the ring. This is also around the age at which the child becomes enough ofa person to talk , and thus to appear as a sonum at its own funeral. Ifin the meantime the baby dies, as so many do, it does not receive a full funeral. The ancestor then seeks out ahother baby among her or his descendants to whom to give the name, since this must reappear somewhere among the living. Further stages in the evolution of the child's personhood are expressed in various ways over the following years . A few days after birth its hair is shaved (apart from a little tuft at the back) ' for the Sun', and its head will be kept shaved or short throughout childhood. As a toddler, its nose and ears will be pierced (pad-) for rings which, at least for girls' ear-rings, will continually be increased in number and size throughout their lives. Before adolescence, someone will tattoo the child's face (lang-lang-bob, 'p rickprick-head'). Boys in particular are giving this up, since it is an embarrassment in their increasing contact with non-Soras . But among older people one can still hear remarks like 'How come she died so suddenly? I saw her only the other day and her tattoo was still clear.'

Around this time, girls cease shaving their heads so that their hair begins to grow to the full, woman's length. Only shamans and their high-caste Ilda-spouses observe any menstrual taboos. Boys nowadays also cease

Many old er men remain shorn for life exce pt for the tuft a t the back which they say is a Telu gu Bra hmin style, but most younger men adopt the conve ntional 'Oriya' or ' Hindi -film ' hairc ut o f the plain s.

Tee nagers form friendships and sexual relationships wid ely , though the power of 'embarrassment' (garoj) imposes some discretion. Sexual rela tions with linea ge members are forbidden, but there is an ambi guity about c ross-cousins (fa ther's sister 's or mother's brothe r's children) and pat'allel cou sin s outside the lineage (i.e. mother's sister's children). All of these are ca lled /liar-anger, male; mar-ol/sel, female, and often addressed as ' brother' and 'sister' . People often say that these too are forbidden up to the third generation , but in practice there are many such liaisons and marriages , especially as the connection fades further into the past (for example, Sagalo has married his third -generation cross-cousin). Young people form and develop liaisons especially during reciprocal work parties (aI/sir) , when men and women may suddenly down tools and chase and tickle (gatarsi-) each other, and at the funeral stone-plantings (gum'), which bring together groups from different villages to drink and dance. Most people have a history of several affairs (dari) before they settle with the partner with whom they raise a family. Setting up house together is recognised as a declaration of intended permanency but in the early years there are many breakups. Most marriages originate in this free-choice way. Dari marriage is not marked by any ceremony and need involve no dowry or bride-price. But the desire of a girl's parents or brothers to interfere or hold on to her can be intense, especially if the family is wealthy. This tendency is compounded by the simultaneous availability of a pattern of arranged marriage (pang-sal, ' taking wine'), involving bride-price and favoured by the better-off. There is no word meaning ' marriage ' as such , covering both these ways in which a man and a woman may come to live together. Panderi's history (see the previous chapter and especially chapter 7) is typical in counterposing her brothers' intention of an arranged marriage with her variollS affairs and eventual dari marriage to Sagalo . The same patterns can be seen in 1amano's attempts, recounted at the end of the last chapter, to control his sisters' love-lives. Even where it is marked by a ce remony, marriage has a tentative or

From first tieath 011 earth to secollti death ill the Ulldenvo"'t/
As soon as someone dies, whatever the hour of day or night, the women of the house start to lament. If available, guns are fired . An orchestra of drums and oboes is assembled to play the 'death beat' (kerenid-deb) . All the men of the lineage within earshot abandon whatever they are doing and gather together to chop down a tree and build a pyre on the lineage's cremation ground. Meanwhile the Ancestor-Women strip the body, wash it in 'cooling' turmeric water and dress it in good , clean clothes. A man from the village's pyre-lighter (siga) lineage lights and tends the pyre. The following morning, the Ancestor-Women pour water on the ashes 'to cool the soul' . Then they bury the ashes on the crema tion-site while the funeral shaman leads the dead person's soul into that person's house. There she enters trance and his soul passes into her body and is interrogated by bystanders about the circumsta nces and causes of hi s death. This is the first of two inquests (described in chapter 8) . Some weeks or months later (usually after the harvest , since this is expensive), the heirs carry out the ma in step in the funeral sequence. They sacrifice buffalos for the deceased to eat and plough with in the Underworld ; they also plant an upright memorial stone at the lineage's stone-planting site, to join the many stones stacked up there, leaning against each other, from previous funerals. On that day the living stage a second inquest in which they again discuss the circumstances of his death with the deceased . This is analysed in detail in

cha pte r 5. Durin g the followin g three yea rs the deceased is commemora ted collectively at ce rta in season s alon g with othe r rece ntl y-dead people . These occasions a re al so a gri c ultura l fes tiva ls a nd the sac rifices a nd tra nces are staged collectively by the whole villa ge : the lajab (a rice-tran splanting commemora tion) and , more spectacularl y, the karja (h a rvest commemoration a nd a nnu a l fes tival o f the dea d , described in cha pte r 9) . T he ka rj a is staged in Feb rua ry or Ma rch whe n all outstandin g ston e-pl a ntin gs a re complete, at the first full moon after the main grain harvests. A fter a period , the dead person is ready to ha nd on hi s na me to a new baby. Thi s often ha ppens soon after the stone-p lantin g but it ma y some times be delayed for seve ral generations, that is for fifty years or even a hundred. The reason s are partly demographic and partly to do with the evolution of the dead person 's own supposed ex perience a nd a ttitudes after death. At dialogues held during these various stages of the fun eral seque nce, the deceased reveals details about hi s condition in the realm of the dead . It is this condition, and the changes which take place within it , which determine how the deceased will affect the living . After having named a child, the ancestor gradually appears less and less during trances until finally the living learn from other dead spea kers that he has died again and received a further stone-planting in the Underworld . Nothing more is known about him after this , though it is said that he has turned into a butterfly.
S un-Woman as blacksmith and embryologist: heat, form and the development of consciousness A consciousness is called puradan ('soul') when alive, Iwlm(/n (' ghost') for the few days or weeks between death and stone-planting, and from the stone-planting onwards, sonum . By chapter 9 it will be clear that the transmission of an ancestor' s name to a ba by is only one of several elements which show that though this is not a reincarnation, there is a powerful cyclical aspect to the identity of the Sora person . Sora thinking about the origins of the person is concerned with the acquisition of form rather than with creation ex nillilo. This goes with a metaphysic in which the new is seen as a re-formation and partial repetition. There appears to be no noun meaning ' form' in general. The associated verbs, however, all of which are applied to babies as well as to craftmanship, clearly presuppose the prior existence and the mutability of the material which is now taking form:
'/%rm [something}'
gc/(Ie- ' mould' (as a potter, or blacksmith pouring molten metal into mould)
pOlllpomsabda
'/0 become', tI-, gadtl
Th e /orl1lation 0/ the Sora person 51
' forge' , ' hammer' (as a bl acksmith on a n anvil) ' fa shi o n' , ' ma ke' , ' fi x' (ge nera l, but es peciall y as a ca rpente r)
't o be /orllled'
literally ' peel' , ' strip onese lf (used in the middle voi ce : see chapter 8)
T he Sora view of the formation of a child takes place within thi s technologica l im age ry. The confined spa ce (kampllng , mea ning both ' womb ' and 'stomac h') within which the foetu s is form ed out of blood is a lso a bla cksmith 's mould (kul1Ipi , a cog nate word?) in whi ch Sun -Sonum (UYlIng-sl/n) casts the fo etus out of molten metal. Who is the Sun? In her dominant aspect as Sun -Woman (Uyung- boj) , the Sun is a Telugu woman of low caste. She al so command s a number of underlin gs who are bla cksmith s, python s and T elu gu cattle-herders (see chapte r 4). H er focal image is of me talworkin g. On appropriate occa sions, a sha man in trance sin gin g in th e Sun's persona will address a patient as gadi-on lien pOlIJpom-on IJen , 'my moulded child my forged child ', and many nearsynonyms. There is thus a homology between the mother's womb and the Sun 's forge and it is under these still-molten conditions that the baby will begin to be separated from the mother. Heat is the precondition for plasticity or the moulding of something amorphous into something which has form . But though heat allows formation and separation, under continuing conditions of heat the separated form cannot be held stable: form which has been acquired must be retained through the cessation of heat. It is for this reason that a newborn baby fresh from the Sun's forge is protected and its form confirmed by cooling rites. These include the use of hard (i.e. cooled) metal objects and the application of cooling 'medicines' (regal11 , especially turmeric, sangsang) to the umbilical stump of the baby and the vagina of the mother. The shaving of the baby' s head a few days later reinforces thi s definition of its boundary. lfthese procedures are not done adequately the baby 's very existence as a separate entity is threatened with dissolution. The first stage in the formation of a new person is thus a long and delicate process. The fact that it has a high failure rate (through miscarriage, stillbirth and infant mortality) is accounted for by the Sora through the imagery of the process itself. A child may suffer a failure of separation at any stage in its formation up to around the time of the naming ceremony and sometimes even far beyond (I have heard this motif used in a lament sung for the death of a teenager). If this happens, the cI'lild ha s been re-absorbed into the Sun , who sent a python to swallow it up. The Sora do not use the expression , but it is tempting to say that the child is returned to

the meltin g-pot. Thou gh the child once born can be attack ed by any oth er sonum too , the only possible cau se of mi scarria ges and failures to conceive is the Sun when she withhold s or reverses her form a tive fun c tion . The corresponding healin gs a re hi ghl y specific and refer to named as pec ts of Sun -Woman and her python (th ese are included in th e li st of sonUll1 S in appendix I). F or example , in th e ca se of an infe rtile woman , the python may be inside her , swallowin g th e foe tu s almost before it is conceived (Ural-sll11 , ' Bud -Drop-Sonum '); in miscarria ges , a fter swallowing the fo etu s the python vomits it prematurely (Mo-gaj-slIl1 , ' Eclipse-MoonSonum ') instead of at the properly-timed , viable moment of normal birth; after the birth, the python may drain the mother's breast of milk and starve the baby by puttin g its own tail in stead of the nipple into the baby's mouth (Ajora-slI11 , ' Stream-Sonum'). Each of these aspects of the Sun ha s its own story or other rationale, some of which will be discussed in chapter 4. The Sora can say nothing explicitly about the origin of a human consciousness. This consciousness is called purodall ('soul ') and seems to be formed in the womb along with the body. In one sense, a child 's soul , like its body, grows and becomes stronger with time . This is why little Mando succumbed to the crossfire ofMengalu's sorcery after it had bounced off the more robust soul of his teenage brother Sagalo (chapter 2). Consciousness is essentially fluid and in one sense it takes on form and identity by filling a bounded space. I could find no single Sora word covering all English senses of ,boundary' (cf. usal , 'skin'; maneng, 'edge') , but it is clear that a person's boundary is important, at least when it is conceptualised in terms of the person's body. In living animals, humans and even plants, soul animates the body. It is contained in the blood and is said to be like the shadow or photograph of the body, in other words, it takes the same form and occupies the same space as the body. Absence of form is expressed by the word Iw~ja , used as an adjective or adverb, and meaning not only 'without form' but also '(at) random; without reason, discrimination or specification; aimless(-Iy)', etc. Space is essentially ka'ja, except where some significance is read into it. Then it provides a framework within which beings can take form. However, Sora do not seem to conceive of personhood exclusively or even mainly in terms ofa bounded entity. At the same time as talking about the blood which occupies the whole of the body, Sora also say that soul is concentrated at the centre of the person, in the liver. (Some people also say that the ' heart' and 'brain' play some role, which they are unable to specify. These organs are known from the butchering of animals). Thus sickness is caused when a sonum starts to 'eat' the victim's soul , and it is said of a sick
Tli e Iof/lWliOIl of Ihe So ra persoll 53
pa ti ent both th a t he ' ha s no blood ' (a lIIiiial1len agasa) and that the a ttac kin g sonum is ea tin g hi s liver. So the preoccupa tion with the mainte nance of a person 's bound a ry may a lso be see n as a conce rn with th e difficulty of holding a n entity 's con stituent elements at a centre or fo ca l po int. In this se nse , we ma y tran sla te ka'ja not so mu ch as ' vvith o ut a clea r outline' but rath er as 'not in a state offocu s or conce ntration in the middle'. Thi s is so especially whe n one think s, not of the person ' s body but of hi s will , motivation or a gency. Sora d escribe the impul se ofsonums as a force, power or ene rgy (renabli, from rabli-, to be abl e) and say that it can be conducted and stored in space. When I took Sora friends to a city , they had no difficulty in understandin g electric lights, accumulators a nd telephones - to th e extent that these operate in the same way a s sonum , whi ch is seen as similarly dynamic and subject to stora ge in containers, tran smi ss ion alon g threads and path s, and leapin g across gaps . But in Sora practice, consciousness is far more than electricity . The impetus which it represent s ca nnot be switched off since it has its own will and agency with which , as sonum , it engages and affects the living. A consciousness becomes sonum after death and stone-planting. Now it no longer animates a body as soul, nor does it retain the same relatively high degree of individuation: it is less clear 'who' each sonum is, as categories ofsonums merge and refract according to a logic which does not apply to the living. But consciousness is still subject to focussing and concentration. Conspicuous features of the landscape, such as rocks, trees or heavenly bodies, are the residences of certain sonums (chapter 4). Shamans may a lso contain sonums in sealed pots , wall -paintings and their own bodies during trance;and they may conduct them across 'formless' space along threads and the ladders used to link the sun, earth and Underworld. But the relationship of soul to sonum is not simply that the one will change into the other after death . There is also a reciprocal web of mutual dependence. Sonums are nourished by soul, whether of the living humans whom they 'eat' when they attack them or of the domestic animals, grain and alcohol offered to them during sacrifices as a substitute (apanadu) for a sick patient. Living Sora in turn are also nourished by soul. This is not the soul of sacrificed animals (which is consumed by sonums, leaving their flesh behind - conveniently - for the living) . Rather, it is the soul of grain. Something of the consciousness of their ancestors is infused back into the grain grown by their descendants on the land which those ancestors used to cultivate. The way in which Sora say that this takes place will be discussed extensively in later chapters. Having crossed the dividing line from death and re-entered living (ameng) plants, this consciousness derived from



54 Dialog lles IPith the dead
sonums is again called pumdall ('soul'). Thus the mutual dependence of the consciousness of the living and of th e dead is rooted in a basic image of kinship which entails a notion not only of returning, but also of rec iprocal nouri shm e nt.
Naming the baby: childbearing and the husband's lineage There is a conflict between the theory of embryo formation and the ideology of patrilineal kinship. It is true that the Sora do sometimes use 'seed' (jabmof) and ' blood' (l11iiial11) to refer to shared kinship. But these words are used only loosely to refer to the idea of some sort of kinship: to say that two people are of the 'same' seed or blood can refer to anything from membership of a lineage to membership of the Sora people as opposed to Oriyas or white people. Tnama and his brothers, when they placed more porridge than I could manage in my bowl , would reassure me that they would finish offwhat I left uneaten from the same bowl, since we were of'the same blood, the same seed (abo 'nin a millam, abo 'nin ajabmof)'. A baby is made from fusion of semen and vaginal fluid; these are called respectively asong-kadand asong-t{j, meaning literally 'exuviae of the penis' and 'exuviae of the vagina'. The word asong on its own is the common word (probably originally a euphemism) for faeces and it is used to make the terms for secretions from other parts of the body and from certain other processes, as follows:
asong-l11u nose-exuviae i.e . nasal mucus asong-mad eye-exuviae sleep-dust asong-Iud ear-exuviae ear-wax asong-kad penis-exuviae semen asong-t{j vagina-exuviae vaginal fluid asong-set! wine-exuviae sediment, lees asong-Iang iron-ex uviae slag
These suggest that asong should be glossed as 'fluid or semi-fluid (i.e. formless) exuviae given off and relinquished by a bounded entity or at the outer edge of a concentra tion' . The child is thus made of substances which during the process of conception and birth derive, in an equivalent manner, from both mother and father. Though in conceiving, the mother 'takesfruit -child' (pallg-gur-on-), the root kud-, 'beget, give birth', is used equally of both parents, while the noun formed from it, kerud-kud, is used as a more or less precise synonym of the patrilineage. In other words, these images do not in themselves permit the unambiguous separa tion of male and female roles in making a baby.
The forlllatioll of th e Sora persoll 55
We ca n rela te this to the tenta tive na ture of the early stages of a marriage. In providing a mould for their sex ual fluids, the mother is the custod ian of something which will become sepa rate from both parents, but in different ways. A husband's patrilineal claim to his wife is weak and becomes stronge r only with the growt h of their children. As a father , he will simil ar ly need to separate his baby from hi s wife's body . His grain grows on plots which he cultivates and it contains the so ul of hi s lineal ancestors who inhabit those sites. His baby is at first nourished exclusively with milk derived from its mother's body. But after weaning it will never again drink milk , human or animal. Instead the child will feed on porridge mad e from the father 's g rain , thus building up its commitment to his ancestors. It will be remembered that weanin g, significa ntly , coincides rou ghly with th e baby's permanent acquisition around the age of three ofa name belonging to one of its father's ancestors. For the child, this is straightforward and it will grow up unambiguously a member of its father's lineage (except where the mother is living with her parents and the baby is effectively fatherless, in which case it will join its mother's paternal lineage). The mother's lineage membership, however, can remain ambiguous indefinitely. After marriage a woman gradually transfers her loyalties to her husband's ancestors in a way which matches the change in her source of nourishment . Her own father and brothers counterbalance this gradual transference of her loyalty, especially where a marriage is made against their wishes. This is either realised or implied in a number of ways, and will emerge in a dramatic and tragic way for Sagalo and his wife Panderi in chapter 7. For example, throughout her married life a woman continues to manage independently her own personal wealth (keruru, containing jewellery, clothes or grain) which is derived entirely From her father's family. Her grain is kept separately from her husband's grain and can never be cooked and eaten by the household , all of whose food is provided by the husband . Meanwhile the wife can lend her grain out at interest and may even lend it (though in this case interest-free [rea]) to her husband. Her father's family may give her Further substantial amounts after harvests and whenever she visits them. Eventually she may be able to buy her own paddy land Which she and her husband will work together along with his fields, though the crop will be hers alone to dispose of. A woman's keruru is inherited by her children. If she has only daughters, they receive everything; if she has sons as well , they take the land and grain while her daughters receive her jewellery and personal effects. Thus we can see how some ofa woman's keruru is derived ultimately from her own mother's family in a process which crosses from lineage to lineage every time its

holder marries. We shall see below how women's names are transmitted along exactly the sa me traj ectory . This cont rast s sharpl y with the way in which me n's na mes and belon gin gs are tran smitted indefinitely down the sa me lin eage. T he amb iguity o f a wife's position between two lin eages emerges exp licitly in funerals. A man is given a funera l by hi s lineage a nd from then on is en um erated by their A ncestor-Men, a long with all their other ma le ancestors, und er the headin g 'fa thers, brothers' (w(lngji, bui'iangji, cf. chapter 6, text 6. 1). Unmarried wome n, like men , receive only one sto ne-plantin g, from the lineage into which they were born . A married woman, howeve r, receives two. The first is performed by her husband . But in addition , the lineage into whi ch she was born will then come in a so lemn procession to her husba nd 's crema tion-site and ' ta ke the bones' (pang~jang, i. e. take some of the ashes) to their own cremation-site where they will stage a second, full-scale stone-planting of their own and incorporate her into their own Ancestors (see chapter 8, after the dea th of Panderi). Thus, married women are enumerated twice, by two sets of Ances tor-Men, in identical funerals conducted in duplicate by both their brothers' and their husbands' lineages. In both these funerals they are listed under the significantly undifferentiated heading ' mothers, sisters' (yangji, bujmaiji, cf. chapter 6, lines 213, 225) . So even though wives receive their first funeral from their'husband's lineage and become part of their ancestor cult, they do so in a sense which is laden with paradox since the lineage into which they were born has not relinquished them in its turn . Thus , if a wife dies in childbirth, especially during her first pregnancy, the diagnosis is often that her own natal ancestors have reclaimed her, out of resentment because she is bea ring children for others whose food she now feeds on (examples among Mengalu's relatives will be given in chapter 6). Perhaps the clearest expression of the resistance to her marriage by a woman's natal lineage is the nature of the shaman's own marriage to an I1da sonum in the Underworld. A shaman has two kinds of sonum-familiars. The first are the sonums of her predecessors, previous Sora shamans who are now dead . These are called rauda and are the subject of the invocation given in text 1.2. Usually the most recent rauda was the shaman's own teacher while alive and it is she who speaks during trances while escorting the dead from the Underworld. But these are not the sonums whom shamans marry. The latter, called tlda, belong to the high Paik caste. The Paik were the local caste to whom administration was entrusted in the British period, and their ksatriya varna includes not only rajas, but many local traders and policeman. Ildas have

This is a relationship within which sex ua l relations or marriage are widely disapproved among the living, In chapter I', I argued that the shaman's experience is only a specia li sed or intensified form of the experience of any la y person, I believe this is true here, too, and that the shaman's cross-cousin marriage represents the fu lfilment ofa culturally powerful fantasy about marriage between brother a nd sister.

There were two sisters, Pubic-Haired Sompa and Mascara-Eyed Ridi, Ridi was the younger and appears in the story only as a shadowy counterpart of Sompa, Some say they were Sora, some that they were raji, that is, ksalriya, Sompa had so much pubic ha ir thal she had to keep it coiled up under her skirt, hence her full epithet in song: ' Pubic-Ha ired Sompa, Sompa of the coiled pubic tresses' (Kurulij SOlllpa. Saekul' SOlllpa), Some say her groin and thighs were covered with hair 'like a bear' , When they had grown up they sought love rs but no-one among their own people wanted to make love to them (or her: most of the details of the story seem to centre on Sompa), either because they were repelled by the pubic hair or else because they were embarrassed at the elaborate gold jewellery and fine clothes they wore, makin g them 'like raji-women like rich women' (raji-boj allll'id gOlllallg-boj allll'id) , So they were feeling extremely lustful but unfulfilled and the veins in their heads were throbbing 'bi/ bl/ bl/' with sexual desire, Later they abandoned their gold a nd fine clothes, which were then destroyed by termites, and they wore ordinary clothes . In their wanderings in search of lovers they came to a village in the plains inhabited by Sarda Soras, who are paradoxically both despised and felt to be of higher status, and who practise cross-cousin marriage. There there was a dance. The style of drumming and dancing, which differs from that of our Soras, is described: the dance involves a wide-stepping movement, at which Sompa's pubic tresses spilled out and so she aga in failed to secure a lover. The sisters returned home to their brothers, saying 'Hey! brothers! the veins in our heads a re bursting: will the sun drown will the moon drown if we make love to you?' So they slept with their own brothers and their souls were cooled. Later when they found that they were pregnant, they also slept once with their brothers' two Sarda servants, saying 'Now you've slept with us, say it's your child.' Thus they 'p ut the responsibility on' (abdusa/eji) th e two Sardas, Eventually the two girls died and after their deaths, they caused other unmarried girls to fall into trance, Whatever the sisters' ethnic origin may have been originally, they are now I'aji.

In th e myth, the public ad mi ssion of sex ual interco urse is linked to the cross-cousin -marrying Sarda servants. But this is only a cover for the essen tial and deeply satisfy ing act of interco urse with the girl s' own brothers , the act which a lso caused their pregnancies. It is not hard from this to see the shama n's i1d a -hu sba nd as representing her own brother and the lineage of their ksatriya hu sba nd s in the Underworld as represent in g the shama ns' own lineages above ground . The implications of this are different for male and female shamans, a nd thi s is reflected in the relative empha sis put on Sompa and Ridi. All shamans trace their descent through a lin e of predecessors and teachers which culminates, according to their tradition, in one or other of these sisters. Mascara -Eyed Ridi is the founder of the lesse r (oseng) tradition of diagnosis and hea lin g, many of whose practitioners a re men . These deal each with hi s own speciali st repertoire ofsonums and may be co nsulted by clients from quite far away. Though divination requires trance, many healings for minor sonums do not , so that not all these men use trance at all. Men learn only as adults. Thus shamanism does not come to a boy in childhood or adolescence nor does it place any strain later upon his marriage, which in any case a lways includes the possibility of polygyny even in this world. Pubic-Haired Sompa, on the other hand, stands at the head of the 'main' or 'important' (muda) tradition , that of the 'funeral' (sanatung) shamans. These shamans work jointly for all the lineages of their own village but for no-o ne else. They are almost exclusively women and where a man takes over for a generation this is supposedly beca use the sonum familiars were unable to find a suitable woman . One example of this is Uda , the shaman through whom the sonul11s will speak in chapter 5. A woman usually marries in the Underworld before puberty , at a formative age a good ten years before she ma rries among the living. This is especially the case in Sompa's funeral tradition , on which the myth puts most of its emphasis. When she later marries above ground, both the woman and her living husband feel the tension . If she is in the divinationand-healing tradition of Ridi, she often continues to practise after marriage; but if she is in the more intense funeral tradition her husband usually finds it unbearable to share her with a dream-husband of elevated status (there is no polyandry anyway amon g the living) , and exerts a strong pressure on her to give up. If on marrying she moves to another village she is obliged to give up in any case, since she is in 'in-law country' (kuiial' desa) and there is a constraint of ,embarrassment' (garo)) on performing funerals for her husband's kin and acting as a mouthpiece for his ancestors. Several

of the fema le funeral shamans known to me had never married above gro und , and some of the others had conspic uou sly unstable or peculiar marriages. A few seemed to be transvestites or hermaphrod ites. I wa s a lso told that in some villages female funeral shama ns do not marry at a ll. T hus, women who are sexua ll y active within marriage are genera ll y excl ud ed from the funeral tradition. A woman who does marry will take up the work aga in only in old age, especia ll y after her husband dies, in wh ich case she may eit her ret urn to her natal village or stay on in her husband's village. So apart from a few adult men of a ll ages, the crucia l sequence of funeral rites, on which so much of So ra life depend s, is largely in the hand s of unmarried teenage girls and old women . The latter a re either sisters of the me n with whom they reside, or else wives whose loyalty to their natal lineage has faded to the point where they have effect ively been assimilated to the stat us of sisters in their hu sba nd 's linea ge. Lineage affiliation for women is very much a question of how far brothers let their sisters go to other men and how far their sisters are ab le to ma ke this move. The ultimate indication of where any woman's loyalty has finally come to rest, is where she bestows her name in a future ge neration . Every person has at least one 'proper' (sa 'kai) name besides various nicknames (goibel'i11111 , often affectionately rude, e.g. Gat'gal', 'Cadger'; Asongl'oi, 'Fly-Shit'). Though new proper names can be coined and lidas sometimes give their own names to babies , all old names will sooner or later be given to one baby among the ran ge of the previous holder's heirs. For reasons of demography , one ba by may sometimes bear the names of several ancestors and it will be shown in later chapters how in a dispute over inheritance more than one baby may claim the name of the sa me ancestor. The pa ttern of transmission is different for male and female names. Since the possession of an ancestor's name is an important part of one's total person and sometimes also a determinant of material inheritance, there are many irregularities and disputes, some of which will be examined in part Ill. Normally a dea d man will give his name to a direct patrilineal descendant and a man who dies without sons will give his name to a descendant of hi s brother. This means that a lineage ha s a common reservoir of male names held, as it were, in trust by ancestors and handed back continually as new sons are born. The simplest model of this, since so many grandparents die before seeing their grandchildren, is A, son of B, so n of A , son of B. I A girl child usually receives the name of a woman who has married in to the lineage, typically the name of her own father's mother. But since that woman in turn will have brought her name from the lineage in which she



62 Dialogues Il'ith the dead
was born , the lineage has no reservoir of fema le names since these a re transferred across lin eages every time its holder marries. This is how the movement of a woman's name is the same in principle as that of her personal wealth , discussed earlier. F ig ure 3.2 shows the main kind s of movement for a woman's name which I have traced repeatedly in genea logies. For many wives, the emotionally and st ructura lly a mbi guou s climate of
the ea rly years or marria ge persists for a long time. If in middle age she is able to climb into the loft herself to fetc h gra in (see chap te r 4), in stead of ca lling her husba nd or one of hi s daug hte rs or siste rs, people consider this a conspicuous sign of a close (tllnYlIn) marria ge. Even after her death, her transfer to her husba nd 's lineage is known to be complete only whe n the

In (i) the woman dies without bearing sons to another lineage, that is, with no sons at all or bearing them in the na me, not oCa husband's, but of her brother's or fa ther's house (Jama no's daughter, Ra na ta ng'ssister, will do this in chapter 5).

A clo se marriage, then , is o ne in which the wife's divided loyalty ha s been reso lved and she ha s thrown in her lot fully with her husba nd. Exa mpl es will be given later of one ma rri age which lacks warmth (that of Ja ma no a nd Onsam in chapter 5) and one of great devotion (that ofPanderi a nd Saga lo in chapter 8) . In each case, there are implica tion s for the retrospective assessme nt of the woman's own perso nhood as well as for the evolving personhood of her livin g children.
Destiny a nd susceptibility to other persons Earlier I said that nothing seems to be said or known about the origin ofa child's consciousness. One may postulate in the Sora person a certain core which is subject to the imagery of blacksmithing or craftsmanship: someone accused of bad behaviour can say 'It's not my fault: Sun-Woman forged me like that [i.e. in the womb)' (Hen dusa tid: Uyung-bojen edte pomingte). Yet this idea is oflimited scope. Already at tllis stage, formation in the womb is susceptible to other sonums and persons beyond the parents: pregnant women avoid certain places, actions or foods, and especially contact with a recent death by a highly contagious sonum. Over and above any anxiety to protect themselves, they do this to prevent the event from becoming a part of the child in the womb and affecting its ultimate fate. It is widely said that everyo ne's fate is already decided a t the moment of birth, but that we can have no means of knowing this. Sun-Woman, of course, knows: 'Thi s one will be killed by a leopard, that one by a fall , that one with a cough .. .'. Some say that she has built it into the baby's formation as a predisposition to a certain fate ; others, that the sonums themselves race to the scene of a birth to stake a claim to the baby (Hen ate, gamteji, ''' mine'' , they say') . This suggests that at conception there may be no intrinsic prior relationship between the foetus and the form of its eventual destiny or even its personality. Just as it begins to receive a name soon after birth, so somewhere during gestation and birth it encounters the first experience or event on the path leading through the varied experiences of life to its particular death . The discussion above of the sources of its nourishment gives a preliminary idea of how a baby becomes involved at a very early stage with



64 Dialogues lI'i,II ,lie dead
a variety of other agents. Even the mammalian function of breastfeeding is already drawn into a tension between parental lineages, while one of the baby's very first experiences of'illness' underlines a relationshjp with one of its father's ancestors. This relationship is acknowledged by attaching the ancestor's name to the baby, who then receives a measure of protection from hi s intended namesake (ai1tmnamar) against other sonums. As the child grows older, the range of its obligations, friendships, loves and hates will become ever more complex . The way Sora talk about this shows tha t from birth, and maybe even as early as at conception , the ba by's consciousness is moulded in response to a kind of experience which is at variance with any model of inheritance based on ideas of the patrilineage. There are various words for inheritance implying a form of transmission which, even though we shall see how these are sometimes disputed, at least in principle follows the contours of the linea ge. To ' inherit' material property is dane -, while physical characteristics are said to pad- , 'pierce, penetrate, pass through' from one person to another, i.e . across boundaries or from one focal centre of personhood to another. This is the usual word for stitching leaves, cloth , etc., and is commonly used also for the transmission of facial resemblance and 'physical' characteristics generally (e.g. chapter 7, line 231). It implies an orderly social, we might even say quasi-biological, heredity. However, there are other aspects of a person which are also transmitted down the generations and to which the word pad- does not apply. These aspects are unhappy ones connected with kinds of illness and death: previous victims return to cause similar dea ths among those whom they have left behind. These kinds of experience, when they are transmitted , are said to gorod-, 'wa nder, leap, move contagiously'. But at the same time, the dead transmit their own illnesses to those closest to them: friends, acquaintances and lovers, and particularly descendants. A briefexample may be given to illustrate how heredity, influences on the foetus, influences at the birth and subsequent adult experiences are all brought to bear as possibilities in interpreting a single person's life:
A certain man is widely cited to illustrate the workings of contagion : he sometimes has violent raging fits in which he beats his wife, brother and others. This is usually said to be because as an adult he helped to carry the corpse of a murder victim before the decontamination ('blocking') rites against a murder were performed (cf. chapter 7, lines 208-11) . The victim's unchannelled (ka'ja) blood entered him and now causes these fits. Out of obstinacy, this man still refuses to undergo the rite and is expected to die a violent death himself. However, I later heard, contrary
Tile forl7/a'ion of' ,lie Sora person 65
to this , that he had also been a sad istic child and had once beaten a buffalo to death and given hi s younger brother a ser ious head injury with a sto ne. Meanwhile his aged mother, defensively , is at pains to insist (I) tha t there was no such violence among hi s forebears; alld (2) tha t she had avo id ed all such influences during her pregnancy; alld (3) that she had rubbed him well with turmeric after his birth to coo l him.
The Sora thu s exp lain a person's mortality, vulnerability and much of hi s character in terms of his relationships to others, but especially to those who are now dead. Some of these susta in the person, while others try to pull the person's consciousness away from his centre in order to 'eat' (jlllll - ) it. To the extent that the person is defined by these others, he is thereby given hi s very being. Yet at the sa me time he is diminished to the extent that they impinge on him in a certain overwhelming and consuming way. Effectively nothing in a person's fate which can be talked about at all, is interpreted only as innate: the events of his illness and death are always interpreted in terms of his involvement with other persons. There is a distinction between transmission from the dead as generational succession and the transmission of bad experiences. This distinction throws upon the latter much of the burden in the explanation of the unhappiness inherent in human frailty and lies at the heart of the complex Sora classification of sonums. It underlies the funeral's slow struggle to eliminate that bad experience and restore the deceased to an idiom of pure Ancestorhood. The irony, which will emerge in the following chapters, is that the bad-experience aspect is also an unavoidable part of the person's total social identity since this, too, is based on his interaction with other persons.

Interpreting and persuading the dead
Ancestor and Experience: mapping two distinct modes of being dead
AIlcestOl'-SOllIlI1lS (I1/(/ the Experiellce SOlll111lS
In their classification of sonums, the Sora make a fundamental distinction. They distinguish between those aspects of the dead whereby they pass on a social identity, from those in which they inflict the forms of their own deaths. In the first case, the dead protect and nourish their descendants , in the second they consume and absorb them. The use of the generic term sonum always implies the possibility of specifying which sonum is meant. A sick person asks , 'Which sonum is stroking me? (iten a sonul11 sll11ling?), and a recently-dead person is asked 'Which sonum took you? (ilen a sonul11 pangal11le?).' The question 'which sonum?' may yield an answer simultaneously in two kinds of terms . The first is a set of specific persons, for example ' the sonum of my father' , ' the sonum of my grandmother'. These are called idai-slln : 'Ancestor-sonum ', or often just idai, ' Ancestor'. The other is a set of ca tegories which are both cosmological and related partly through medical symptoms to forms of death . These have names like 'Sun-Sonum', 'Leopard-Sonum' or 'Convulsion-Sonum' (respectively Uyung-sll11 . KlI1a-SlIl1 and Kani-sll11). There is no collective word in Sora for the various categories of this set. Sora conceive of their action in terms of incidents and events during the course of people's lives. I shall therefore gloss them collectively throughout this book as 'Experience' sonums (with a capital 'E'). Where sonums are discussed as causes of illness and death (both of which can generally have no other kind of cause), the full explanation of such events requires that these two sets of terms be combined in order to explain both the motive for the attack and its form. A person may say something
Illt erpretillg alld persuadillg tlte dead 67
like 'It was my fa ther, acting through Sun -So num .' T hus the dead little girl who spoke at the beginnin g of chapte r I (tex t 1.1) was killed by a previou s victim of Madu-slln ('Leprosy-Son um '). T hrou gh the form of her own dea th , she has become associated with thi s sonum in her turn a nd is now li kely to attack her livin g relatives in thi s sa me way. The interpl ay betwee n the Ancestor and the Expe ri ence aspects ofsonum is com pl ex. However, throu ghout all the paradoxes and resolution s of lhis interp la y, this conceptual distinct ion rema ins clear. It is refl ected, for instance, in the geography of the dead (figure 4 .1). Both horizonta ll y and vertically, the space of the Ancestors lies in the inhabited house and village . Horizontally, Ancestor space is di stin gui shed on the land sca pe from Experie nce space as domestic to wild , or village to jungle. Vertically, it lies within the house and down towards the Underworld (kll1orai desa) , which is the normal abode of the dead wh en they are conceived as Ancestors. A rather pallid replica of social life among the living, complete with hou ses and villages, is supposed to exist there. The main passages from there to the world of the living pass through the grain-pounding mortar set into the floor of each house as well as through the collective cremation-sites and stone-planting sites of each lineage in the street outside. Experience space, by contrast, is mapped on to the landscape outside the village a t ground level and a bove, from clumps of trees, rocks and pa ths up to the sun. These locations are focusses of meaning whereby the concept of the Experiences

Allcesto,,-SOf//mIS alld the house: how the Ih'illg participate ill jill/erals
An Ancestor is a dead person. Each such person retains hi s or her own name and separate identity within the framework of the linea ge . An idai is not necessa rily one's ancestor in the literal , restricted sense of the English word : rather, one's idais are one's own dead . They therefore include numerous young people such as one's own dead children (cf. text 1. 1); wives of one's lineage, who are also Ancestors to their natal lineages; sisters who, ifmarried, will simultaneously be Ancesto rs to their husband's lineage too ; and to a certa in extent a male cross-cousin, if one has given him a duplicate funeral (as Sagalo did for Sunia in chapter 2) . There are thus varyin g degrees of Ancestorhood which may be recognised on a particular occasion by an entire lineage, a group of brothers, or a single household . In order to understa nd this, let us look more closely at the household and its relations with other households. A village usually contains several patrilineages (biJ·inda). The imagery of the lineage's interna l structure is arboreal, with 't runks' or 'branches' (aneb), ' twigs' (sipa) and ' leaves' (ala) . For the sake of simplicity I shall sometimes use the word 'line' to specify the descendants of anyone man under di scussion. The lineage's male core is descended from a single male ancestor who is listed by every member in the rites of their personal ancestor cult, since he is equally the ancestor of a ll . While this ancestor may be three, four or occasionally more genera tions away, more recent ancestors are listed on most occasions only by their own lines , that is by their own direct descendants . Spatially, the lineage is fixed. Each linea ge possesses its own cremation ground (kl11lalod) and group of upright memorial stones (g-ml-ll-ar, 's tone-planting site') to which a new stone is added at each funeral (gll-{I/', 'stone-planting') conducted by the lineage. One must marry a member of
/11 l erprel illg (flld perslladillg lli e dead 69
anot her lin eage and women usua ll y move into th eir hu sba nd 's hom e on marria ge, so that the male co re of the lin eage stays put while women co me and go . Since the villa ge conta in s seve ral lineages, one may marry equally inside or outside the vill age. T he re is constant contact among villa ges throu ghout the a rea . De legations vi sit ot her villa ges for fun eral s, whil e right s to the use of la nd a re widely scattered : a hou sehold may cultivate plots up to an ho ur's walk away from home a nd can expect hospitality from in-laws, cross-co usins or fri end s in many villages on the way. The final ' leaf of the lin eage is the hou sehold . Gene ra ll y it co nta in s a nuclea r family o f husba nd , wife (or, for som e, wives) a nd children. Each son as he marries fOllnd s a sepa ra te household , tak in g with him a complete rep li ca of hi s father 's a ncestor-cult (later to include hi s father a nd mother too when they die), while the yo un ges t son genera ll y brings hi s wife to hi s parents' hOll se and rema ins in it after their death.' Within the long lang, the part of the villa ge inhabited by one lin eage, several houses are often joined toge ther in rows , each with a sepa rate entrance giving on to a common verandah (pil1da). A house consists of one sin gle-storeyed room , constructed of so lid sto ne walls plasterd with reddi sh mud. These walls stop some way below the thatch roof, which does not rest on them but is supported on a framework of wooden pillars (sundallg) , beams and rafters. Conversations can be conducted between houses over the party wall , so that a row of hou ses in some ways resembles a longhouse. Just inside the door is an area in which one can stand upright and where the heavy wooden grain-pounding mortar (anal) is set flush into the cowdungfinished floor. Beyond this the remainder of the interior is divided horizo ntally in two by a loft (maran) set at chest height and made of stout planks. The loft contains large baskets of grain (unless the house is very poor a nd lives entirely in debt) . Apart from the door, light enters only through a gap between the thatch and the top of the wall. At the fa r end, under the loft , is the hearth (kuda), the smoke of which similarly pa sses through thi s ga p. Down here, often screened from the door area by a low interior wall , is the dark and shadowy area where the family ea ts and sleeps by the light of the fire . This area is for squatting or sitting, not standing, and one must walk crouching or like a crab. Women keep the floors swept clean and the walls are draped with tools , cloth , and gourd and clay bottles suspended on nails and hooks. On the advice of shamans, people may make wall-paintings (idlal) dedicated to sonums and hang up other offerings such as a sonum-pot (sonum-dang) containing grain. Many parts of the house are more or less direct symbols of the lineage or of its twigs and leaves. The main pillar (sllndang) supporting the roof



70 Dialog ues lFitli tlie dead
represents the continu ity of patrilineal kin ship in the past and future. For exa.mp le, before drinking a lcoho l indo ors, the man of the house may spnnkle a few drops at the foot of it with a few words of offering to his predecessors. For a man to say 'I have my main pillar' (iiellll1uda-sul1 den daku) is convent ion a l 'deep-la ng uage' Uaru-ber) for ' I have li ving so ns.' Anothe r important part of the house is the loft. The gra in stored here belongs to the male householder's patrilineal ancestors and though in -marrying women cook this gra in , they must not climb up to fetch it - a prohibition which is relaxed only after menopause, or earli er if a marriage IS very Il1tlmate. Until then , the g rain can be fetched only by males o r by daughters and sisters of the house. The mortar (ana!), which is set into the floor near the door, is the passage from the house to the land of the Ancestors in the Underworld . Here is pounded the grain which nourishes the members of the house and which as we shall see later co ntain s a vital element of those Ancestors' sou l. In addition, the pounding motion of the pestle (ol1dring) in the mortar has a thinly veiled connotation of sexual intercourse. The door (sanang) is also an entrance for Ancestors. At certain mO~lents of the funerary cycle great play is made of opening and barring their passage through both the mortar and the door. Outside the house, Ancestor space broadens to encompass larger groups of pa trilineal rela tives at different levels of segmenta tion of the kin-group: from the house for the nuclear family, to the terraces of three or four closely-related houses, to the cremation-site and stone-planting site for the lineage as a whole. Immediate Ancestors of the household are fyd inside the house a nd at threshing-floors out on the hillsides at various seasonal rites (abdur) which are associ a ted with stages of the growth and harvest ofcrops. In addition, they may be fed inside the house (s/'lI1gp/r, 'house-rite') when they cause a non-fatal fever (asu) in members of their own households
particularly in a small child to whom they wish to give their name. But th~ main context in which the dead are addressed as Ancestors is at the several stages of their own funerals.
Funerals bring together the entire lineage among both the living and the dead. The relationship between ancestor and descend a nt is one of succession in the widest sense . What is at stake here is not only material inheritance, important though this sometimes is, but also an element of transmitted social identity. The way a living person participates in a funeral is therefore a close reflection of the role he expects the deceased to play in his future life . A general outline of the stages of the funeral wa s given in chapter 3. Here, I shall focus on the central rite of the stone-planting in order to discuss various ways of rela ting to the deceased . For the moment, I
Illt erpre tillg alld persuadillg tlie dead 7 1
shall d iscuss only the role of men in the funeral s of other me n. Because of the ambiguous position of wom en between lin eages (chapter 3), their fun e ral s are more comp lex and ca n be di sc ussed on ly in la ter chapters. Men sacrifice ·a buffalo under one of three rubrics which ex press the degree both of th eir claim to be the heirs of th e deceased and of their obligation to incorporate him into their lives as an A nces tor. Just as in the hea lin g for an illness, this buffalo is a 'substitute' for the donor. This is vividly expressed in the Sora idiom for giv in g someth in g in one's own nam e. Whe n Jamano died (chapte r 5), I wa s one of the many peopl e who ga ve him a buffalo. These were round ed up togethe r th e day before the stone-planting but during the ni g ht they all escaped from their pen . In the morning I was told 'They've found some of them, but they haven ' t yet found the one with your face (l1/uka 11((/1/ ate ).'
'Planting tlie stone' (gu-m). Only the most direct heirs do this. For adults, these will be their sons, assisted by their unmarried daughters; for children , their parents . Except for the lineage's sto ne-plant in g site and cremation-ground, all property is conceived of as being owned by individu a ls. Immovab le property (land, hou se-s ites, usefu l trees) as well as catt le are owned and inherited largely by males. Other possessions like jewellery and tools a re usually inheri ted by children of the same sex as the previous owner, sharing equally. The most substantial property is usually a man 's paddy land or his rights to the use of a shiftingcultivation site. AU of these are divided equally among his sons, but they do this only after staging his stone-planting and taking on his uncleared debts (teng-, literally carrying them publicly on their head). As well as a buffalo such heirs provide the stone and in some villages they may also 'sacrifice' an egg or eat a 'crema ted ' rice-flour effigy of the deceased. This seems to signify their exclusive right to hi s name for one of their future babies (see chapters 7- 9). Through these actions they will 'induct' (amgan -) the deceased into their house or houses in which he has a right of residence as an Ancestor in this full sense. 'Hilling a buffalo' ( id-bong) . This is done by other linea ge mem bel'S 'out of pity because it 's our brother/sister (abasu)'lI11 bui1ang/ tonan lell gamle)' . They give a buffalo but do not sacrifice eggs or share in eating an effigy . They therefore do not carry the dead person's debts nor do they inherit a share of his property or the possibility of his name for one of their descendants . In this sense , the deceased is not inducted into their houses as a full Ancestor. But the continuing unity of the lineage as a whole is acknowledged, since all Ancestors of all its branches are

enumerated at the stone-planting when anyone of the lineage's members dies (chapter 6). Within this total li st there are degrees of co llatera lity , all of which participate by hitting a buffalo; if the line of direct heirs sho uld later die out, everyth in g should normally revert to the nearest of these. 'Dancing a bt!ffa/o' ( tongseng-bong). This is done by an affine (parent-in -law, brother-in -law, or child -in -Iaw). If they have come from another village the party of the affinal lineage camp and cook outside the village, then enter with a flamboyant war dance to a beat called gan-desa (,entering-territory', but also with overtones of ' invading'). Dancing a buffalo is the affinal act pal' excellence. I once witnessed a furious argument when an unwanted suitor of the dead man's daughter turned up from anot her village with his suppo rters a nd made ready to kill a buffalo on the outskirts of the stone-planting ' for hi s father-in-law to be'. He was discovered and prevented in time and hi s buffalo was locked up for safety till the end of the day. But had he succeeded in performing the

act of a son-in -law , his claim to the girl would supposed ly have been
strengthened. Whi le the host lineage stays put plantin g the stone and enumera ting a ll their own Ancestors around the stone-planting site (chapter 6) , the affina l buffalo-dancers come and go as they dance around the village. Simi la rly , the affines do not take home the sonum of the deceased or induct him into their houses. They normally have no right to inh er it his belongings or his name, nor does the deceased have a corresponding right to make them ill and demand sacrifices from them . But this can change if someone decides to 'take the bones' of his male cross-cousin back to hi s own site and stage a seco nd funeral , thereby incorporat in g him for a while at least as an Ancestor. This is what Sagalo did for Sunia , and some of the implications will emerge in c hapter 8.
An Ancestor is in principle benign, protective and so licitous for the welfare of his descendants, who as hi s rep lacements are an entity whom it is in his interest to preserve - thou gh eve n here he is sensitive to his amour propre and can cause fever if annoyed. Ancestors are the source of all that has come to us by inheritance , and their claim on us is based on a piquant combination of moral obligation (even if often viewed as a nuisance) and sympathy for the pathetic condition which is the lot of the dead.
Experiellce SOlllmlS alld the lalldscape: fo"",s of i11lless alld death
It is not in the form of Ancestors that the dead kill their descendants, but as bearers of the symptoms by which they themselves died: they perpetuate in others the forms of their own deaths . They have this capacity by virtue of being representatives of one or other of a range of what I have called
Experience son um s. This kind of collective sonum is a cosmological concept yet it has an active consciousness of its own, animated, so to speak, by its individual members. Through making the living share in the experience for which it stands, it seeks to assimilate them by an annihilation of their own identity . According to the specific imagery of the sonum concerned, this attempt at assimila tion may be expressed by a verb of gra bbing, eating, swallowing, or even sexual embrace. However, all such words imply a total overwhelming by the a ttacker of the victim, who thereby' fuses' or ' merges' (l1Iaj-) in to the Experience. A full discussion of the vocabulary and grammar of these verbs is given towards the end of chapter 8, where it will form a crucial part of my interpretation of what sonums are. Meanwhile, the full range of Experience sonums is given in figure 4.2.

they are all Leopard -So num '). Po ints of Experience space ca n be located a nyw here in the non-A ncestor space th at lies beyond the vill age boundary horizonta lly , as well as upward s in the S un . A Leopard -So num site is usua ll y loca ted in a rock, Ea rthSo num in a spring, while Sun -Sonum is loca ted in the sun itse lf. Eve ry location outside the villa ge which is distinctive enough to be referred to in conversation has a name, which can usually be etymologised . Thus any walk through the jungle can be specified as a sequence of points almost eve ry few yards: 'Sweet Mango', 'Cows' Co nfusion ', ' Peacock's DancingGround', 'Bees' Home', 'Wind in the Sa l Trees' (respectively Sindiul , Garegetangen, Tarongse ngmar , Borsll1g, Sargiaringen). The sa me kind s of descriptive, usually compound word s serve equally to designate villa ges (Alinsll1g, 'Wine Village', spelled throughout this book Alinsing; Manengul, 'Furthest Mango '; Sogad, 'dove'; Kumbt.llstng, 'Rat's Home'); sites of Experiences; and locations which have no such special significance. Thus any place which can be sufficiently isolated perceptually and conceptually to be labelled , has the potential to contain consciousness in the form of sonum. This potential is not always realised : for example, nothing actually happens at Garegetangen except that cows stray, or perhaps did on one particular occasion, but it is always possible for stronger meanings to build up at such sites. As Experience sites, they are then gathered into classes through some common attribute. For example, Sweet Mango and Wind in the Sal Trees are the sites of water-sources, and therefore (for reasons which will emerge in chapter 6 and beyond) of specific instances of the
category Earth-Sonum. The sites into which Experiences recruit their victims are analogies of the villages of the living and as well as their ordinary names are also called, e.g. ' Leopard -Village' or ' Leopa rd-House' (Ktna-sll1g) , ' Sun-House' (UyungSll1g), etc. (-slI1g serves as the compounding form of both SI 'lI1g, 'house', and go/jang, ' villa ge'). Since each such point represents a form of illness and death, the Sora landscape is a gigantic three-dimensional mnemonic device. This functions in a manner like the aI's memoriae ('art of memory ') by which classical Greek and Roman orators memorised the points to be made in their speeches by mentally walking round a landscape or building and retrieving ideas deposited there previously (Yates 1966: for an extraordinary parallel as a mental 'illness', see Luria 1968). The information yielded by this landscape is on the one hand a set of Experiences which explain

ce rtain kind s of eve nts, on the oth er hand li s ts of nam es of peop le known to have died in these ways a nd to have ' me rged ' or ' fu sed' (II/aj-) int o the sites of these Ex peri ences. Sora frequently refer to th e connect ions be tween Experience sites and person s in eve ryday conversat ion , as well as eve ry time they perform a rite in co nn ection with a site .
Encountering, welcoming and dismissing sonums While a person 's s uscept ibility to demands for fo od from an A nces to r pure and simple is cast clea rl y in terms of kin ship and is co unte rbalanced by the ima ge of nourishment , hi s susceptibility to attacks by an Experience is cas t largely in term s of even ts in his li fe and act io ns which brin g him within the range of those Experie nces. These include apparentl y random co ntac ts li ke pa ss in g nea r their reside nces or e nco unterin g one of their scouts who 'wander' (go rod-) across the terra in . Certainly , the son um 's connection with a new victim is ba sed not on any kind of kinship ri ght but on notions of encounter or moments of heightened susceptibi li ty . But even so, each Experience sonum contains a reshuffled selection of everybody's Ancestors from various lineages. The ringleader (l11uda) a t least of such attacks usually has a close kinship or other emotional connection with the current victim while the other Experience-members are 'shadow-men-at-his-back' (/ub-dung-marenji) who back him up and share in the spoils (if the victim dies, these are his own soul; if he recovers, then that of the sacrificed animal). Thus one generally communicates throughout one's life with the same ra nge of dead people who at one moment act as one's nurturing Ancestor, at another assa il one as representatives of an Experi ence. The idea of encounter is linked to the way in which people move on the landscape. Figure 4.3 gives the main sites connected with Experience sonum s for Alinsing, the village ill which Menga lu and Sagalo live . It will be seen that sites fall into three types, which I ha ve called residences (the inhabi ted 'houses' or 'villages ' [s/'/Ilg) of the Experiences, marked on the map by squares); outposts (triangles); and sacrificial sites (circles) . Most of these are referred to by their place names. Thus Sindiul, 'Sweet Man go ' , is the name ofa location , in which there is a spring of the same name, in which there is the residence of an Earth-Sonum, called in full Sindiul-a-Labo-slIl1, 'Sweet-Mango Earth-Sonum'; similarly, Sangkaroren (etymology uncertain) is a place in which happen to be located side-by-side two different residences . There is a spring containing an Earth-Sonum (called SangkarOl'en Earth-Sonum) and on the nearby path is the residential site of the Ra'tud-Sonum for the entire village of Alinsing. Residences, as we have seen, store the Experience's victims and in so doing harbour the potential for further recruitment. Susceptibility to an

Experience ari ses from a combination of predi sposition and 'encountering' (olong- ). Direct contac t with the site ma y precipitate an attack. But this is not the only possible means, since members of the Experience use th e site as a base from which they move out to seek new recruits among relatives and fri end s. Different categories of reside ntial Ex perience mayor ma y not have outposts to ass ist them in this. Son urn s do not actually resid e at outposts, but outposts are linked in various ways to a reside nce and recruit victim s on its behalf. As an example , let us look at Ra ' tud -Sonum (Ra'tud -s lm) , oneof whose conspicuou s properties is to a ttack people on paths. Every village has one Ra'tud -House at an important path -junction and a number of outposts on other paths all around , which are frequented by its members (the ' Ra ' tud -people ', Ra 'tud-lIIarallji) . These outposts act ra ther like booby-traps, a nd to succumb fatally to any of them will lead to residence at the main site . There is no separate term for outposts but in some cases they are called 'Police Station' , tana, because they are used to 'seize' or 'arrest' (i1am -) passers-by . . Encountering goes beyond fixed outposts and includes mobile patrols and other agents. Ra'tud-People wander continually along paths and may be encountered on anyone of these; Leopard-Sonum may use actual leopards to attack one; and so on. The idea of encounter shades into ideas of actions and forms of behaviour which attract the attentions of an Experience. Smallpox (Ruga-boj, 'Speckle-Woman') is a caste-Hindu sonum of the plains, identified by the Sora with Durga, and is attracted by the wearing of flowers or brightly coloured clothes, which is not normal Sora taste . Excreting near the spring of an Earth -House will offend the sonum's sense of cleanliness and cause blockage or swelling of one's excretory passage. Uttering the name of an Experience in vain is to invite trouble - though everyone does so constantly since 'Leopard' and 'Ra'tud' are among the commonest everyday swear-words: 'You Leopard-Man (lona-mar)!' , said either affectionately or in real anger, like 'You silly bugger!' in English; or 'Ra '- TUUUD!!', said most memorably when someone opened the door of his house after an absence of only a few hours to find a huge , heaving termite hill growing through the middle of his floor. Sacrificial sites are referred to as ' where we do the rite (lVante p trtebe), to heal a patient of such-and-such a sonum . These are the points at which the living aim to head off an encounter. Here, sonums are fed with alcohol and an animal's soul, but only in order to be dismissed . While residences and outposts are spread across the landscape at some distance from the village, that is in fully wild space, sacrificial sites are mostly strung out along the paths leading out of the village, taking over at roughly the outermost edge

'sub-Experiences', have no residential sites of their own and are fed at the edge of the villa ge at sites which seem to have no inherent significance but which are simply distinct from each other. The point here is to banish the sub-Experience from the villa ge to Ex perience space. This is part of the process by which the Sora continually try to hold apart the Ancestor and Experience aspects of their dead , by 'inducting' (al1l -gclI1-, '[causative particle) -enter') the former into the house and ' banishin g' (al1l -dllng-, '[causative particle) -leave') the latter by leading it out of the house. As well as the person of the pa tient , the space which is protected is tha t of the house. In one sense, each direct Ancestor was formally inducted at his or her stone-planting and indeed has a right of overlordship in the house. In another se nse , the Ancestor was passed through the stone into the Underworld and so does not so much reside in the house, as repeatedly re-enter it on various occasions. Even here, the Ancestor's direct presence makes the living uneasy and they hasten to restrict his movement. At the annual harvest-commemoration and at other seasonal rites, Ancestors are invited in for the festival and sent back afterwards through the mortar to the Underworld . On other occasions, Ancestors may enter a house or follow someone home demanding food by causing a fever. The residents feed them inside the house with a chicken and then similarly send them back. Sometimes an Ancestor is fed in the house and is then given a closed pot hung on the wall for months or years where he is fed with the soul of some grain which is put inside the pot and changed from time to time. He may also be given a small wall-painting. Thus though in one sense it owns the house, under no circumstances is any sonum, even an Ancestor, left there at large. Hit is there at all, it will make itself known in a way which will force the household to take action. They will then either make it go away, close it up in a pot, or frame it inside a wall-painting. In their Experience aspect, of course, the dead are not invited into the house at all, but it is known that they have entered or followed someone home when they are diagnosed in illness. They are then dismissed in a healing (pnplr) , in this context called a banishing rite (am -rlung-plr , '[causative particle) -Ieave-rite'). When the dead come like this as members of an Experience, they are initially gathered up inside the house with an invocatory chant and usually some alcohol, raw grain and the live animal. The participants then lead the sonum along with the materials out of the house to the sacrificial site where they will perform the main chants and kill , cook and eat the animal. The dismissal of the sonum is contained in the words and actions of the rite. In the case of highly contagious Experiences, such as Leopard or Convulsion, there are taboos about lingering at the site

afterwards, taking mea t home, or even looking bac kwards. But otherwise the mea l is a leisurely picnic and meat is taken back for those who did not attend .
From medical history to biography
It should not be thought from aU this that the Sora rega rd their land scape or live their lives in ex treme fear. They go everywhere constantly, walking, sitting, laughing, drinking, much as people elsewhere will have a picnic within inches of the lorry lane of a motorway or a hi gh-tension cable. But an encounter should be seen as something much more than the equivalent of stumbling on an uninsulated electric cable or a dump of poisonous chemical waste. An Experience attacks someone through the personal rela tionship which exists between them. Even the most everyday affliction is therefore never an accident, with the English word's connotation of randomness. There is no discussion of symptoms in illness or death , without discussion of the motivation of members of an Experience which can be linked to those symptoms. Conversely, illness is one side of a coin stamped on the other side with the positive relationship of Ancestor to descendant. The landscape is one, not of fear, but of a keen awareness of mutual dependence.
The scope of the Experiences' action on the living is therefore more far-reaching than that of mere symptoms, in a narrow 'medical' sense. The Sora live hard. Illness and sudden death are a constant element in Sora life. External medical facilities are scarce and are used erratically and uncolllprehendingly. Infant mortality is high: many women have given birth about ten times and lost half of these children. I rarely met anyone who had lived beyond fifty-five or at the most sixty (so far as I could judge by working through genealogies, since no-one knows their age); and I have often seen even robust teenagers and young adults collapse unexpectedly and die within hours . Virtually all Sora appear to suffer frolll all of the following endemic conditions (in medical categories): hookworm with anaemia, roundworm, viral hepatitis, ringworm, amoebic dysentery, bacillary dysentery, vivax malaria , falciparum malaria (sometimes with blackwater fever) and tuberculosis: while wounds , received from working with axes and knives in the forest and from walking barefoot over thorns and sharp stones, sometimes turn septic. Fevers are frequent and people of all ages may continue to work strenuously and cheerfully in a state in which most of today's Westerners (and middle-class Indians) would not even attempt to sit up in bed. 2
Most people carry most of these 'diseases' in their bodies most of the



82 Dialog ues ll'ith the dead
time. Yet they are ' ill ' only sometimes. T he role of perception and interpretation is clea rly crucia l. In interpretin g illness and death, Sora thinking balances the se nsation s and mood s which we might ca ll symptoms against an exp lanatory framework which states that they are caused by the son um s of the dead, who ha ve them selves suffered from similar cond iti ons. In every case, not only shou ld the phenomenology of the illness be accounted for , it should also be convincin gly united with a motive ba sed on personal relations between the present sufferer and a predecessor who is now causin g this experience. The process of tracing this link is comp lex and can sometimes seem tortuous. Detailed case-stud ies of this during inquests will be given in chapters 5 and 8; but meanwhile I shall give some simple examp les of this kind of rea soning here:
- Shortly after an eld erly woman has died with Eart h-Sonum symptoms, her devoted husband also dies in a similar way. She took him out of love to join her because she was lonely without him .
- A man falls ill with Ra'tud symptoms. His dead father, who himse lf died ofRa'tud, says that as a sonum he met his son on the path yesterday and asked for some of the wine he was carrying, but was refused. He has caused the illness as a punishment. The son promises not to think mean and greedy (ranglw) thoughts next time he is carrying a pot of wine, makes the appropriate Ra 'tud sacrifice to his father and his Ra'tud cronies, and recovers.
- A boy and girl were in love, but her brother was jealous and made her life wretched, so she hanged herself. At her stone-planting, she asked who was drumming so beautifully in the background. It was her lover, so she called him to drink wine from the gourd from which she - in the body of the shaman - had just been drinking, saying ' I loved you desperately while I was alive, but now this is the only way I can occasionally be with you.' Shortly afterwards, the boy went out and hanged himself. She had taken him into the Sun, by the contagion of suicide which was in the drink.
How is it that the seven categories of landscape-based Experiences (figure 4.2), some of them referring to specific and even rare forms of dea th, are able between them to yield a convincing interpretation for every illness which occurs? The answer lies partly in the fact that a full interpretation must enrich mere phenomenology with conscious motivation. But it lies
Int erpretillg alld perslladillg the dead 83
a lso within the constitut ion of the Experiences them se lves. These Experiences are ultimately flexible enough so that between them they stand for a ll possible kinds of symptoms, signs and omens in death, as we ll as for complicated and conflict in g interpretations of motive in terms of personal relation s. Such a sma ll set of resid ential Expe riences do not do this as monolithic categor ies, but mould themselves to the particulars of lived experience through their command of subordinate levels of meanin g which match these particulars more closely. Each Experience contains a number of distinct ca usa l powers or agents. People see these as elements which on their own command only the specific symptoms or states which they ca use, but which combine with each other (and with the total li st of known victim s) to form the total cha ra cter of the superordinate Experience. For example , it will be remembered from chapter 3 that Sun -Sonum is primarily a female who commands the technique of the blacksmith in order to forge embryos out of molten metal. As such , however, the Sun is composed of several elements. Some of these are male, some female , some of indeterminate sex, and various relationships between them are brought to the fore in different rites and myths. Some of the most important aspects are:
Uyung-boj 'Sun-Woman ' The dominant aspect; in all ways she determines the actual formation of the baby, while the other aspects are her 'em issaries' (pisirian) or 'bonded labourers' (kambari).
Mo'mo'-yung 'Dumb-Sun'
A male, imbecile blacksmith who simply hammers embryos under her direction and has no initiative of his own; he announces his presence during a trance by grunting inarticulately.
Duri-sll11 'Lumbago-Son um' Identified when Sun-Woman uses Dumb-Sun to strike a person on the loins with his hammer to cause back pains (see case-study in Chapter 7).
Lur~jadan 'Python-Snake' The Sun and Moon were brothers ('Sun-Sonum', Uyung-slll1 and 'Moo n-Sonum ', Anggaj-slll1). But the Sun's hot little children filled the sky and scorched the earth. To help humans, the Moon hid his own children (the stars) in a chest and rubbed his mouth with the red gum of the ame tree. Then he told the Sun that he had swallowed his own children and urged the Sun to do likewise. When the Sun had swallowed



84 Dialogues Ivith the dead
all the baby Sun s, the Moon released the sta rs again. F uriou s at having been tricked , the Sun periodically send s a python to pursue and swa llow the Moon. This ca uses eclipses, but also menstrual disorders and miscarriages, in which the foetu s is similarly 'swa llowed ' by thi s python.
I shall call these subordinate ca tegor ies of the Experiences their sub-Experiences. The sub-Experiences do not contain any dead people, but are merely aspects of the superordinate Experiences which do. Appendix I gives a li st of all the so nums I saw people dealin g with in Alinsing (many more such so num s can be found in other villages and in the writings of Elwin and Sitapati). It will be seen there that there are over one hundred of these sub-Experiences and that I have bee n able to fit almost all of these easily under the seven superordinate headings of the Experiences. On the one hand, sub-Experiences correspond fairly directly to a medical or quasimedical symptom or other equivalent sign of their activity. On the other, the association of each sub-Experience with one or other of the residential Experiences, which is explicitly recognised by the Sora, is based on a continuity of imagery between these two levels. The Sun's overall imagery of heat, redness and the processes inside the womb leads through the blacksmith's hammer to the pains of lumbago, and through red tree-sap and eclipses to menstrual disorders and miscarriages. Another aspect of the Sun, for instance, focusses on leprosy and lesions as a kind of burn (Madu-slI11, 'Leprosy-Sonum'). Thus every superordinate Experience has a cluster of properties, each of which is taken up in a narrower, more specific way by one of its various sub-Experiences. So each one of these constituent sub-Experiences expresses only a small part of the Experience's full nature and mobilises only a small part of its entire armoury. The sub-Experiences thus face Janus-like in two directions. With one face they point towards the relatively abstract residential Experiences from which they derive their potential to act and to the identity of which they in turn contribute. With the other face they point towards the physical signs and symptoms in the realm of perception which they are deemed to cause. It is their relative descriptive accuracy at this level which gives them verisimilitude, while the continuity of imagery with the residential categories allows this conviction to be carried over to the realm of motiva tion among the Experience's dead residents. Sub-Experiences do not have the degree of complexity which would warrant their own space to store dead victims. The perpetuation of sub-Experiences across time comes not from having people as their carriers but only from the dependence ofeach one on a larger, more complex category which does do this.
Int erpreting and persuading the dead 85
In this li g ht the residential Expe ri ences appear as hi ghl y simplified a nd co nde nsed summari es: simplilled in the sense of carryin g out a concept ua l red uction of their primary perceptual data of sym ptom s, signs and moods ; condensed , in ' that in order to act they must ge nera lly unpack their compressed latent properties and set one specific aspect of these to work. The sub-Ex peri ences are not themselves summaries but co nstituen t elements of tho se summaries, who se re la tionships are conceptua li sed in te rms of ba sic human social relation ships: myth and kinship (the Sun a nd Moon were brothe rs) and ro ya l or burea ucratic authority (Sun-Woman's command over her slave Dumb-S un and her agent Python -Snake). Why then does a particular dead perso n affect a particular livin g person, on a particular occasion and in a particular form? An answer to thi s question will emerge gradually as this book proceeds. Though the a rena of sonUl11S includes wha t one might ca ll medical diagnosis, their interpreta tive power reaches far beyond what this would imply. This is nicely illustrated by Rumble-Tummy-Sonum (Kurkur-pung-slIl1), a minor condition caused by Leopard-Sonum (Kll1a-slIl1) . Following my terminology above for sonum sites, we can say that Leopard -So num is a residential Experience, composed of several subordinate, non-residential sub-Experiences. It has one residence outside each village, plus several more outposts and sacrificial sites, all located at termite hills . As a cause of death it can attack directly by sending an actual leopard against one (an agent or mobile patrol). Omens presaging this involve clawing or nibbling sensations and include finding one's clothes eaten by termites . Another sign is finding oneself in a sudden silence in the midday heat in the tniddle of the jungle, surrounded by biting gnats. LeopardSonum's sub-Experiences draw on specific narrower aspects of the totality of leopardhood . Prickling sensations on the skin may be caused by Bena , the original mythical human leopard-victim. He is associated with Grandfather-Man (lojo -mar), a person who is very aged and therefore causes blindness. This is like the blindness of the panic one experiences on suddenly coming face to face with a leopard . Rumble-Tummy-Sonum is the agent responsible when one's tummy rumbles like a leopard's growl. Healings for these Leopard sub-Experiences involve chanting the names of all known victims of the village's local Leopard residence. The sacrifice is generally performed not at the site of this residence itself but at a sacrificial site which is usually a termite hill, in accordance with the imagery of nibbling. The shaman also uses a grass which resembles the leopard's furry tail, as well as other objects, tunes and words which reinforce the Leopard theme by contrast with those used for the other residential Experiences, at

the same time as und erlinin g the narrower di stinction s between th e various named Leopa rd sub-Experiences. The deceased Leopard -victim who is interested in you can thu s choose from a range of ways of impinging upon you , as is clear from the following (text 4.1):
Text 4.i HO lv Kantino 's father was killed by a leopard Kantino is speaking to me as we walk along:
My father was leoparded (killale) just alon g thi s path ... There were seve n men, it was getting dark , towa rd s evening. My fath er was th e second in the file, be hind anoth er man. Thi s man came weeping to wh e re we were, calling ' Kantino!' - 'Hoi!' r said. - 'A leopard has tak en your father ', he sa id , ' at Sargiaringen [,Wind -inthe-Sal-Trees ', a hillside); we went huntin g a monkey up there .'
Another man breaks in , pointing to another hill :
My aunt was leoparded just over there, on that slope.
Kantino continues:
I went to the police station and gave a report. Later r found his legs and head and cremated them.
Though his father has received a funeral (a specially complicated one, as befits a Leopard-victim) and become an Ancestor, nevertheless he may still send a leopard to attack Kantino. But even short of this, Kantino is liable to the effects of Rumble-Tummy-Sonum:
rfmy tummy rumbles r say 'Leopard-Sonum is stroking (SI/1'1-) me, it's my father.' [At such moments) he's residing where he was leoparded [i.e. in Leopard-House in the jungle) and hasn't merged (lI1aj-) with the Ancestors. No, I'm not frightened , but I feel sad, because he hasn' t become (gadil-) an Ancestor.
Despite its often close reference to symptoms, then, a sub-Experience is much more than a label for a medical condition. Even such a trivial symptom as a rumbling tummy may be a reminder of a relationship between the patient and an earlier leopard-victim. Perhaps it should be seen as a label for a wider psychic condition and we should say that it is the sonum which helps to define, clarify or articulate the symptom. Everyone sometimes has tummy-rumbles, but only for Kantino and others in a similar position are they a phenomenon which is likely to be noticed and responded to as a sonum (and perhaps even for him, not on every occasion). In giving Kantino a tummy-rumble, his father is setting up or confirming an analogy between them. A minor condition like this is a tentative advance by a dead person towards the victim, the first potential

death may strike at any time. But many conditions are chronic, flaring up at some times and lying dormant at others; and people's tolerance also seems to vary. On mornings during some slack seasons for work , when the climate and diet are good , life is easy and there is pl enty of time to chat, processions of families from all over the village converge on the string of dismi ssal sites along the main path leadin g out of Alinsing. There, independently of each other but within earshot, their shamans chant over them the different signature tunes of various sub-Experiences . But waiting for the monsoon in the sweltering heat of May and June, just as the thirst-quenching and nourishing wine-trees begin to fail , people must hack down tangled vegetation, burn branches, hoe and sow the hillsides from dawn till nightfall. My impression then was that people were exhausted and I was often very alarmed at the poor health of people close to me as they were laid low with repeated attacks of malaria and dysentery. Yet few healings were held: people were too busy, either to consider themselves ill or else to follow this through with a healing.
A condition in an Experience mode is thus not simply an 'illness' but also a mood: it is a reminder from someone one has known, made at a moment when one is disposed to acknowledge it. A person will be subject throughout his life to more or less forceful reminders from the many people w~om he h.as known and who are now dead. He will experience many mmor b.odlly disorders for which he does not bother to seek any explanatIOn. But those for which he does seek an explanation form a history of these relationships and their shifting moods. In some cases the patient will have a predisposition, like Kantino's for forms of LeopardSonum, based on inheritance, kinship, emotion, physical weakness, etc. In other cases he will unintentionally set up a rela tionship, e.g. by trespassing near the site ofa sonum. All of these are constant potentials, each of which may. only occasionally be actualised. Most are shrugged off after a healing sacrIfice; some are memorable as a serious crisis survived (as Doimani told me a bout a serious illness in her teens, soon after both her parents had died : 'My soul resisted - No!, I said, Don't take me! [purada-i1en asarre - aii11 agamlai. pangdonging.1'); and others, Jjke Jamano's illness in chapter 5,
become part of a long-running saga of chronic ill-health leading ultima tely to death .
Thus the thrust of the Sora word plrplr, a healing rite, does not seem to lie only in the notion of healing the patient. Certainly, the patient and his supporters hope that the undesirable condition will cease as a direct result of the rite, and often urge the sonums to make the patient well again (text 7.1). But the object of its verb, plr-, is not the patient but the sonum itself:
Int erpreting and persuading the dead 89
kUf{lS11l1 plrtai, 'I pi1'- Leopard -Sonum' , in the active, said by the shaman; or lonaSl111 plrtellai, 'I get som eone to plr- Leopard -Sonum for me', in the middle, sa id by Ka ntino when heca lls a sham an (for the gramm a r of verbs, see chapter 8) . This suggests that the mea ning of plr- also includes a sense of 'acknowledging' , and that of the noun pnplr is not only a ' hea ling' but also an 'ac knowledgement' . This accords with a stron g imagery of feeding and nourishin g sonums, expressed by words like posi- and 10- which are also used of feedin g domestic pets (and , dispara gingly , uxorilocal husbands). I shall from time to time remind the reader that the So ra word for 'healing' the patient also implies 'acknowledging' the claims of the perso n who is causing the illness.) Thi s is desirable in order to help to shift our attention away from our own dominant medical idiom. Sora practice is not an inadequate form of medicine, nor is it some sort of pre-medicine which ha s not yet succeeded in becoming fully medicalised or scientised. Its premises and aims are different. Each illness is a reminder of a relationship and each is temporarily satisfied, or blocked off, by the performance of an acknowledgement which addresses itself to that relationship. A person's involvement with sonums is not merely a medical history because it is a constantly developing exploration of aspects and possibilities in his own life. His person is defined largely in terms of other persons, just as, circularly, they are defined in terms of others including him. Through acting these relationships out in dialogue he develops parts of his own personality, seen as the potential for experience and action. His 'medical history' is thus at the same time a measure of his genealogical status (for example, a woman's Ancestors would be 'ashamed' to attack her husband since he has not incorporated them into his own Ancestors) and a reflection of his shifting emotional states. Indeed, it may be called the core of his biography. Within this mosaic of relationships, however, it is the relationship which brings about that person's death which will come to dominate all others as a final assessment of his life. The process by which this assessment is reached will be analysed in detail in the following chapter, when Jamano finally succumbs to his ill-health, dies, and is interrogated at his inquest about the causes of his death.
Speaking for oneself: formal debates and ordinary conversations The mutual involvement of Sora persons clearly has a more intense theoretical basis than anything most readers are used to. This involvement is especially evident in the sense of a person's mortality and the interplay of the living and the dead. The concept of 'acknowledging' implies use of the discursive medium of language. Language is of course not the only medium

through whjch Sora people exp ress and exp lore their involvement with their dead. T hey use their bod ies in ma ny ways to acknow ledge , reflect or resist thi s involvement as they dance, weep or la ugh. A sick person 's body, lik e his so ul , is represented by th at of an an ima l which is then separated from hjm when it is sacrificed. From th e stone-pl a ntin g onward s, as the deceased begin s hi s long journey towa rd s a partial triumph over hi s death , the li ving accompany every stage of hi s funeral with a vigoro us stamping dance, with its mixed con notation s of war dance, sexua l interco urse and regrowth . On these occasions, men, women and older children dance with babies and toddlers tied in slin gs on their hips . With their little faces pressed sid eways against the older person's bare flesh as they are jigged up a nd down , thi s must be one of the most vivid early memories of every Sora person . Ancestor-Women a nd Ancestor-Men , and shamans in trance, are even more involved with the dead . Each time they perform , they ' beco me' the dead and sha re their sensu a I depriva tion by fasting a nd avoiding sex beforehand. If they do not do this they risk being trapped , una ble to return from the Underworld. But language has a special place as a medium which can be allusive and discursive, synthetic and analytic. When one party to any relationship dies, it is their conversation which is isolated from the tangle of their various interpersonal contacts and developed over the years which follow. But this conversation does not simply take place, casually, like any other. It is set within a framework of rites performed by an array of specialists in highly formalised verse. Before presenting the dialogue in the next chapter, I should like to guide the reader's understa ndin g of it by contrasting it with two significant properties of the verse which surrounds it. For each of these properties, I shall argue that verse conventionalises the situation of the moment by emphasising what it ha s in common with other, similar occasions in the past; while the prose of conversation allows speakers to dwell on what is unique. The first property of verse is that it ca rries to its extreme a pervasive tendency in all Sora speech, a tendency to speak in grammatica lly parallel phrases or doublets: edate-gudate, ' he weeps he wails'. Sora call these doublets takud-ber, 'finishing-off speech' and they can encompass either single words or lengthy phrases.4 The reader will notice numerous examples of doublets in the conversations in later chapters, though these a re not easy to translate elegantly. 'Leave abandon that house that home,' says a woman to Sagalo's wife who is in the wrong place among the dead , ' that place that location, that seat that site, leave it abandon it' (chapter 7, line 286). 1amano is urged after his death to strengthen his so n's forcefulness in
interpreting and persuading the dead 9 1
public affa irs: 'If you put the word s into his mo uth if yo u pour the word s in to his mouth , he won't be fri ghtened he wo n' t be nervous', and himself boasts about hi s own record while a live: 'The Po lice Officer-in-C harge may come the Inspector may come, important men may come bi g shots may come ... my fa ce is as good as his my visage is as good as hi s, even though he knows G overnment language Oriya lang uage' (chapter 5, lines 155-6). Verse (which is a lways sung or chanted) is composed entirely of such doublets, as in the invocation sung by the shaman in cha pter I (text 1. 2):
cla sping hand s, grandmothers ... clasping feet , grandmothers ...
your monkey's four-footed walk, your ape's four-footed walk ,
grandmother grandmother
The use of doublets here goes beyond a conversational device and a mounts to a total technique. ' Hands' is paired with ' feet' , 'monkey' with 'ape', a nd so on. 5 Though at first sight such juxtaposition s seem to enrich their images, on closer examination it can be seen that they constrict the semantic field and the scope of implicit reference of each of their elements and their potential to combine in other, less predictable ways. Finishing-off speech bundles together everything it touches . In verse, there is not a single word which is not contained within a parallel phrase or clause, while in ordinary speech these pairings form only small nuggets within a flow of language which has a looser, more flexible overall texture. The second property of verse is the way it is used in long stanzas to summarise the positions of various persons in opposed or complementary roles. Dialogues are often antagonistic and their subject matter is often judicial. Later chapters will show how among other things they serve to resolve certain kinds of what one might call legal di sputes, for example over inheritance. At tense moments when speakers are particularly anxious to impose their point of view, the dialogues can turn briefly into simultaneous monologues in which people talk past each other (e.g. chapter 7, lines 171 and 285-6). At the stone-planting and the kalj a, the ordinary dialogue betwee n living and dead laymen in everyday langua ge is paralleled by an exchange in verse sung by specialists. The Ancestor-Men form into two teams. For several hours they mime, dance and sing a song which is called both kata, 'myth', 'story' or 'pa ntomime' and rudi, 'debate' or 'a rgument' . One team impersonates the deceased while the other impersonates a succession of the main living mourners who are also present in person nearby. They then sing



92 Dialog ues Il'ilh Ihe dead
their way through a series of exchanges between, say, a dead woman and her husband and the dead woman and her children; or else between a dead child and its mother, its father a nd its siblin gs. These exchanges resemble not so much dialogues as lengthy speeches made by each sid e in turn. Rlidi is a lso the usual word for an argument among the livin g. It is a judicial term which borrows its imagery from the courts in the towns and from the bisa/'a (from Oriya and ultimately Sa nskrit) , the now-defunct village council. For examp le, a /'udi sometimes breaks out in the street with an allegation of theft of buffalos, money, go ld ornaments or women. Bystanders soon line up on two sides and then mak e indi gnant speeches, so metimes listening to each other, but often haranguing each other simultaneously. A rudi , then, can be either a public slanging match between the living, or else a formalised debate between the livin g and the dead in which what each side ha s to say is pre-empted and sung by speciali sts. In either case, the interaction is limited by the adversa rial format of set speeches. In the sung exchanges, the verse performances have a rhythmic and musical flow which precludes the replies or interruptions which are the essence of conversa tion, and cannot respond very directly to the contingent reactions of addressee or bystanders. In the same way, when ordinary speakers become excited, their speech tends to fall into a wider pattern of doublets which does not invite the intercalation of responses moment by moment but serves as a verbal battering-ram. While the song of the Ancestor-Men offers a debate between positions, dialogue between the living and the dead offers a conversation between persons. Stripped of the accoutrements of the law court, of the lining up of parties across the street, of opposed monologues, the format ofan ordinary dialogue allows it to reflect the specificity of each situation. After the special singing of the shaman's invocation and her rauda's response, after the Ancestor-Men's sung debate, amid all these specialists' bodily techniques of trance and fasting, in front of the bounded, consecrated space laid out on the ground for offerings, comes the essential core of the occasion. But this is set in a language which is utterly ordinary and even banal. In talking with the dead , one speaks for oneself, in the language of one's own everyday life. Unless it were clear from the content or one had background information, it would be difficult from a transcript alone to know whether a given dialogue was between the living and the dead or entirely among the living. What marks off conversation from sung verse, then , is the fact that it is less tightly bundled into doublets . It therefore allows a more specific and flexible discussion and allows, even compels, living and dead laypersons to respond to each other directly. It thus offers a deeper possibility of
Inl e/'p/'eling and pe/'sllading Ihe dead 93
comp ro mi se or resolution and it s psychological impli cat io ns are much more far-reaching. The relationship between sung exchange and spoken dialogue can be illu strated from one typical occas ion . The team of Ancestor-Men representing the dead man at l'li s funeral were singin g to the team representing his widow. For a lon g time the song passed throu gh th e convent ional sentim ents which a recently deceased man might express towards his wife. But sudden ly the singers started to comment on the widow's tears: how come she was crying now, when only a short time before her hu sband's death she had been neglecting him and her children and meet ing anot her man secre tl y in the forest?
sangsang d([ btl n([lIl lI/'padle Iijle
your turmeric-rubbed thigh you spread out and ga ve
miiiol da btl nal1l a/'padle lijle
your oil-rubbed thigh you opened out and gave
At this point the widow ran away and hid , while her lover became very angry with the singers and threatened to beat them up. 'But since it was a kala wha t could he do (do kalan asen ian lume)?'. The affair, of course, had long been an open secret. These lines were a public warning that when the song was finished and the trance began, the wife and her lover would not be able to avoid discussing their affair with the dead man himself in the discursive, penetrating format of ordinary conversation, where no specialist could do their work for them. Starting with the next chapter, we shall see how such reproaches and embarrassments lie at the heart of dialogues between the living and the dead. The formal songs sung by the Ancestor-Men do no more than sketch in the outlines of your situation. They sing their piece without reference to you and then move off elsewhere; the shaman invokes her rauda and her own persona then disappears; the rauda replies with her promise to lead on the dead and then her persona too disappears from the shaman's vacant body. All the supporting formal structures of verse and music are withdrawn and you are finally left face to face with your sonums to speak with them on your own behalf. It is the stages of this encounter which we shall witness and interpret throughout the remainder of this book.



PART II
RESPONDING TO A NEW DEATH



A family lived in isolation in the jungle. One day the mother died a nd since he did not understand what death wa s, the father just abandoned her corpse. But every day when he left his children and went out to find food, her ghost (leu/man) returned and swept the house and cooked . When the husband came home in the evening he asked his children who had done this work. They replied that it was their mother, but he said 'Ah children, how can it be, don't say that, it makes me sad .' But since they insisted that this was so, he stayed behind one day to see for himself. His wife did indeed come and start to work. He was overwhelmed with joy and rushed up to her and threw his arms around her. But as soon as he clasped her, she turned to ashes in his embrace . Only then did he understand that he had to cremate her and plant a stone for her.

Transcription of a dialogue from the inquest on Jamano
The dialogues in this chapter constitute text 5.1.
Deteriorating relations between Jamano and Mengalu
This chapter will analyse the inquest held on the day after Jamano died, in which the dead man is interrogated about the causes of his own death. The inquest after death represents a special, more elaborate form of the divination which seeks to find out the cause of a living person's illness . I showed in the last chapter how the interpretation of bodily, more or less 'medical', states among the living is bound up with their thoughts and feelings about dead people. Though many states of malaise cannot be ignored, people also use interpretation in deciding how far they regard themselves as ill. For example, Kantino's susceptibility to RumbleTummy-Sonum is related to his readiness to ascribe meaning to his internal rumblings . I thereFore suggested that the nature of sonums at least partly creates the symptoms by which they make their mark. By giving form to bodily states, sonums turn them into expressions of personal relations. Though people may say they get better as a result ofa healing, the same dead person is likely to attack again on another occasion anyway, or even another dead person using the same Experience and similar symptoms. In addition, second opinions for the 'same' condition, as well as new diagnoses for what are perceived as new conditions, may suggest further relationships between the patient and other dead persons. Following the implica tions of the Soras' own vocabulary for their response to an illness, I suggested tha t as well as 'healings' of the sick person, such ri tes should also be understood as 'acknowledgements', since they are also a response to an initiative originating with the dead. We can relate this to decisive moments in a person's biography (always remembering that the meaning of this word stretches far beyond the span of

hi s ' lifetime'). I have tried to represent a person's hi story of illness and dea th in fi g ure 5. 1. The diagram is cycli ca l and fall s into three circuits: a sick (asu) perso n who recove rs quickly ret urns around circuit A to a state of being ' hea lthy' (suka) ; so meo ne who is chroni ca lly ill (bill/bil1l) passes ro und circ uit B, as he goes from shaman to sham a n a nd healin g to healing; finally , whe n al l hea lin gs fail , everyone mu st eventually pass once around circuit C. The two points where divination is needed correspond respectively to the two traditions of sham a ns ske tch ed in chapter 3: the lesser divina tion -and-healing tradition of Mascara -Eyed Ridi , and the main funeral tradition of Pubic-Haired Sompa , which includes the inques t in this chapter. Ju st as the dia gnosis of an illness chooses between a range of sub-Experiences, so the verdict of an inquest invo lves makin g a choice of one among the range of residential Experiences and linking this to motivation among the previous victims of that Experience. But since the dead person will now become a causative agent for the form of his own death , the verdict tells the living not only what happened to him but also what to expect from him in the future.

person 's post-mortem verdic t a re therefore more fa r-reaching th a n those of a dia gnosis, since they directl y a ffect th ose left behind . T hi s verdict ca n be comp lica ted by the elaborate socia l life which the dead lead amo ng themselves, visitin g each other at their variou s residenti a l sites, havin g a ffairs a nd marryin g each other , ge tting drunk , and gangin g up aga in st the livin g. The res ult is an extremely wid e sco pe for interpretation , since in principle, a ny person living or dea d cou ld conceivably be judged respo nsible directly or indirectly for an y illness or dea th in a nyone known to them. In practice, of course, dia gnosis is not so wide- ra ngin g and ce rta inly never random . In chapter 2 I introduced the rea der to Jamano , hi s son Ranatang, his brother Uda and his more di stant lineage-brother M enga lu with whom Jam a no had a lon g- running di spute over land . Their genea logica l relationsh ips were shown in fi gure 2.2. In February 1979 I return ed to Alinsing valley (see figure 4.3) after nea rly two years' absence . I wa s taken directly to the house of Ranatang in Tongseng, the offshoot of Alinsing founded on the other side of the valley by a segment of the Headman ]jneage of the main village itself. On that day, Ranatang was hosting a double name-giving for two infants aged about three . One of these was hi s own chi ld , the other the child of his unmarried sister, one of Jamano's daughters who had stayed at home as described at the end of chapter 2. I was warmly greeted by all present. Among the people who packed the house making preparations were Ranatang himself, a strong, handsome and self-confident young man ; his father's brother Uda, a divination shaman who had recently also become a funeral shaman after the death of the old lady who had previously done this work; and Ranatang's father Jamano himself, now a scrawny and very sick man, coughing frequently and with a welcoming smile which seemed already tired of this world. The only exception to this cheerful mood wa s Mengalu, who seemed surly and withdrawn and very different from his ebu llient self as I remembered him two years earlier, especia lly before I watched the death by sorcery of Sagalo's little brother being laid at his door. In particular, I noted at the time that Mengalu seemed to have yielded the role of leader of the lineage's Ancestor-Men to Mejeru , the only other man whose knowledge of the movements and words approached Mengalu's, a playful but modest and retiring man who I felt would not normally seek to lead the group. Quite early in the proceedings, Mengalu left and crossed back to Alinsing to sing in another rite there on behalf of his nephew Sagalo with whom he was now close again. Later I learned that Mengalu had not contributed grain towards that day's name-giving feast. These moves by Mengalu over the name-giving in Tongseng are not to be

interpreted as a denial of his membership of th e Headman lin eage as such , for he remains a devoted exponent of its id entity in rites; rather, it is a de nial that he shares thi s lineage membership with Jamano and Ranatan g. The feeUn g wa s mutual , as wa s shown on a ni ght a few weeks later in A pril when Ranatang's ten-da y-old baby died. Thi s baby had been refu sing the breast since birth and had undergone healing rites for various sonums (mo stly sub-Experiences of the Sun such as her python) whi ch attack infants. I wa s sleeping in Ranatan g's house at the time . Normally when someone di es a tree is cut down as near as possible to the lineage's cremation site, which for the people of Tongseng is right across the valley in the main village of Alinsing . But on this occa sion a tree at the edge of Tongseng itself wa s cut down and this wa s done only by the men of Tongseng. They then dragged it by the light of flaming torches alon g a twi stin g path (the 'funeral route', a special lon g detour to confuse the ghost [Iwllllan] and prevent it from finding its way home), down over the boulders of the stream, and up again on the other bank to the lineage's cremation site on the edge of Alinsing. I believe that this was calculated to exclude the main part of the lineage living in Alinsing, since normally as soon as the guns are fired and the women of the bereaved household start their lament , every man who will himself be burned on the same site is expected to get up and join in felling the tree and building the pyre. As we stumbled across the stream-bed carrying the huge tree and the tiny corpse, Ranatang remarked to me that it was high time they had their own cremation site back in Tongseng. Many people in Tongseng repeated this sentiment, both throughout the time surrounding the baby's death and a few months later when Jamano himself died. It was only when we reached the cremation site that we met up with the people of the main part of the lineage from AUnsing, along with the pyre-lighters (siga) who work for the entire village. As for Mengalu, I do not remember if he was there and can find no reference to it in my notes. Certainly if he had not been, it would have been conspicuous. The following morning, when the pyre had died down, the AncestorWomen of the lineage cooled the soul of the dead baby by dousing the ashes with water contributed by every household of the lineage, and as usual buried them in a pit on the site of the cremation . There was no talk of Mengalu's house having failed to contribute water, but he was conspicuous by his absence later in the day at the abbreviated, simplified version of the stone-planting which is performed for unnamed babies (jumkub , 'feeding the ashes' or maybe 'eating the ashes'). Mengalu was reported (by Ranatang) to have refused to lead the lineage's Ancestor-Men in their chant at the baby's funeral , with the words

J amano's death and the first inquest at his crema tion It was against this background , in August 1979 , that Jamano died. Ha ving been ill for a long time, he had passed through a succession of differin g diagnoses and healings which had failed to improve his condition . I was absent at the time of his death and cremation, and so missed the first inquest the following day. This was conducted by the funeral shaman Kumbri, an old woman who had married into Alinsing from another village but was not closely connected with the Uneage of Jamano and Mengalu. When I returned a fortnight later just in time for the stoneplanting, I learned from gossip that the preliminary inquest had revealed the cause of death as Ra'tud -Sonu.n. " .s an Experience, this wa s consistent with his conspicuous symptom of coughing blood , but as with any Experience this left open the question of motivation. This, according to gossip, had been supplied by Mengalu ' s sorcery . 1cannot be sure how much this view was articulated within the preliminary inquest which I missed , conducted through the shaman Kumbri. But since the later, stone-planting inquest to be analysed below was conducted through the dead man 's brother Uda , 1 suspect that the first inquest will have introduced the theme of Mengalu's guilt less definitively than we shall now see it developed.

Ranata ng later produced the following examp les of Mengalu 's suspicious and unfeeling behaviour at the time of 1amano's cremation a nd first inq uest: a t the time of cutting wood for the pyre he was very slow in com ing to join the others; while they were sta nding beside the burning pyre he turned to a noth er man and sa id: 'Let's go and prepare some wine' (yirai, agadsa/enai) and 'seemed to be lau ghin g' (mang/e amrid) ; at the inquest, the other membe rs of the lineage came and 'spoke weepingly' (eda/e %l/g/eji) with the dead 1amano. Though Mengalu did at first attend he did not wait to speak to the dead man but went and slept in a nea rby house 'as thou gh he
wasn't sorry' (a'sil/tae all1rid).
Some of these could be interpretations of innocent behaviour by Ranatang's overwrought imagination , while some, like going off to lie alone elsewhere, could be the product of Mengalu's own intense nervousness. His behaviour at the best of times is histrionic and unpredictable, and he clearly reinforces people's suspicions about him by doing the wrong thing in a crisis. Other reports were circulating about actions and words of Mengalu's which, if he had indeed done and said them, were extremely foolish. Though he is just the kind of man who might take a perverse pleasure in playing with fire in this way, the tape-recorded conversations transcribed below suggest that they may equally well have been invented or heavily embellished. It was also being said that only a short while before 1amano's death Mengalu had placed his hand upon 1amano's head (not a normal gesture) and said 'When you die J shall sing your stone-planting for you'; and that earlier, at some stage of the quarrel over the land , he had said 'I'll bind you and later in the middle of the night you'll squawk like a chicken' (rajingtall1 do tiki amen kansim en amrid tungar dina kekerblj gam/e u/ete). This was taken as an unmistakeable threat of sorcery. More was involved, however, than personal animosity or even a dispute over a plot of land. We have seen how three months earlier, at the baby's death, there had been much talk among Ranatang's people about the need for a separate cremation site and stone-planting site - in other words, to split off from the main Headman lineage in Alinsing. 1amano's funeral afforded the opportunity for a first move in this direction. A strange innovative compromise was reached, which I had never seen before: 1amano was cremated at the usual cremation site in Alinsing and a stone was planted at the lineage stone-planting site. But on the day of the



106 Dialogues wilh Ihe dead
stone-planting o nl y one of the twe nty-one buffalos given was killed there, while the other twenty were killed a nd a ll the important dancing and sun g dialogue (kala) took place in To ngseng round a shrine which was built in a field in front of Jamano's hou se. For this , a Pa no had been im ported to make it in cement and whitewash in the sty le of the H indu plains , a nd instea d of being buried in the cremation site, Jamano's ashes were carried across the fields a nd immured in thi s. T hi s was sa id to make him very 'di sting ui shed' (pill/eng). The new , separa ti st shrine was thus treated exactly as if it were a stone-plantin g site - which it ma y well now beco me. Though I did overhear some criticisms, the A ncesto r-Men of the main lineage in Alinsing acquiesced in this to the ex te nt of attending and sin gin g. Menga lu 's membership of this g roup was inco nsistent. For in sta nce, a few days before the sto ne- planting Ranatang in a ugurated the shrine in an idiosyncratic ex pression of grief by sacrificin g several chickens and sprinkling th e ir blood there as a promise of the buffalos to come on the day itself. On that occa sion , Mengalu wa s not among the Ancestor-Men who performed. Over the two days of the stone-planting itself, however , he wa s back as the leader of the Ancestor-Men , though he was extremely tense. During the pauses in the chanting, Mengalu stood rigid and solitary, watching the dancers going round the shrine while the other Ancestor-Men nearby tried to act normally by drinking and joking together. During the sung dialogue, as he and his co llea gues sang in Jamano 's persona ,

But now , for a ll our old friendship , I co uld not have a ny p ro per conversa tion s with Menga lu .

I was the reby sha rin g, if on ly in a thea trica l and honorary se nse, with Ranatang in the action s ofa so n and heir. This wa s not the on ly time that my friend ship with M enga lu ca used me trouble. But as the dialogue below makes clea r, a t thi s sta ge the view held by Ranatang a nd hi s supporters had an impet us of its own rega rdless of anyth ing M enga lu mi ght have been feelin g.
T he second inquest at Jamano's stone-planting Among other things, this divination will confirm and amplify the verdict reached earlier in the first inquest, after Jamano's cremat ion. Just inside the doorway of the darkened , crowded house, two shamans are sitting side by side with their legs stretched out over the mortar. Kumbri conducted the earlier inquest alone but will today play only a minor role . Most of the sonums will speak through Uda , the dead man's younger brother. As the sounds of drums and oboes advance and retreat outside with groups of dancers, the shamans prepare for trance. For several minutes they sing in unison, invoking a chain of helping rauda sonums stretching back to Pubic-Haired Sompa. Then, still in unison , their bodies lock rigid and are unclenched by bystanders.
The raudas implicale Mengalu as sorcerer (lines 22-32):
Post-mortem dialogue embodies a quest by the living for certainty from the lips of the dead . The dead can speak to the living only after the shaman's main rauda-predecessor has spoken as mistress of ceremonies and se t the tone for the conversations to follow . As former shamans, raudas supposedly stand impartially above deception and vested interest. Hence they will say, 'whatever is hidden , whatever is kept silent, whatever is buried [we
shall reveal it]' (line 23) . Where a serious case of sorcery is involved, those who speak may include 110t only the dead, but also the disembodied soul (puradan) or consciousness of the sorcerer himself. Where, as so often, sorcery accusa tions run between men who are lineage brothers and therefore participate in each

In this case you then have to fi ght it out in public with thi s refraction of your own person a lity whi ch obstinately in sists on drawing su spicion to , or even confessin g, what you have come alon g in the flesh expressly to deny. Whatever M engalu may have believed about the workin gs of thi s, he could not brin g himse lf to attend on thi s occas ion. In the same way, at the death of little Mando ex actly two years earlie r, M e ngalu had not attend ed the inquest the following day but had sent his four wives and all their children to work in the hills for the entire day and disappeared him self too. By the second inquest on the dead child, on the day of the stone-plantin g itself, he did attend but his task had become much more difficult. It was only with the dialogue at the first karja the following spring that the sense of his guilt began to fade in people's gossip . It seems already inevitable that the ensuing drama should be acted out in terms of the hostility between Mengalu and 1amano. But this was not enough for a total interpretation of Jamano's death. As explained in chapter 4, a verdict is ultimately explained also in terms of an Experience and of an Ancestor who has shared this Experience. Both of these are additional to Mengalu's involvement and we shall be able to follow the speakers step by step as they esta blish connections between the roles of sorcerer and of the various dead persons with whom he has colluded.
Jamano arrives allrl is lesled/or a Irue slale 0/ consciousness (lines 33- 64): The above Lines were followed by the voice of 1amano's long-dead father, who denied having had any hand in his son's death , but suggested that 1amano's deceased wife Onsam was implicated , a point which will be developed later. He was followed by Jamano himself, speaking through Uda . Jamano stayed for two or three hours, during which he discussed several topics with implica tions for the future lives of his interlocutors. But I shall here present only the first ten minutes during which he discusses the immediate causes of his death. In harmony with the truthfulness of the raudas, the dead too should be



110 Dialoglles with the dead
placed in a state of consciousness where they will speak the truth and will neither indulge in 'deceit' (bllkai or jolda , common among attackin g sOl1ums) nor , as is more usual with the recently dead , suffer from ' false awareness' or ' lack of self-awareness' (ondrullg). Thus Jamano wi ll be told to ' speak out' , oblillga (Ii nes 33, 91 , 105) and to do so 'stra ight' , rojtad (35 , 93) , 'honest ly' , sa 'kai (38 , 93) , 'properly' , bangsale (94) ; while possible reasons for hesitation are spe lt out only in order to be dismissed: 'don ' t be afra id ' , batongdongal11 (33). In line 93 they urge him not to 'concea l' (soso -) or 'cover up' (daltad-) the truth because he may be reluctant to st ir up trouble between two branches of the lineage. Jamal1o's response to these urgings a re not taken for granted but are tested: the word for this test is tungjillg (42). From lines 38 to 64 inclu sive, every remark addressed to the dead man is concerned with this: question s requiring specific answers are fired at him one after another , and hi s first , early bid for co nfirmation and approval is cut short with a response equivalent to 'we ask the questions , not you' (39,40): they require far more of him before they will allow the atmosphere of interrogation to relax. At line 56 he tries to expand into anecdotal detail, but they are still interested only in the question of truth, and force him to keep to the point.
The sOl1um of Jama no arrives. All the women immediately fill the house with uncoordinated lamenting songs, while the men rush around to prepare things. As the pandemonium dies down a little, the conversation becomes audible:

The interrogation is sojienedonce autlien ticity has been established (lines 65- 104):
The tone of the conversation now starts to cha nge . Up till now, in their anxiety to test the authenticity of hi s presence, Jamano's interlocutors have been ruthlessly insisting that he should tell them facts about his last hours of the sort which are already known and agreed by them. The first sig n of softening comes at line 67, where a voice finishes off his sentence for him



11 2 Dialogues Ivith the dead
with a piece of information which he then echoes as hi s next remark (68) . They are now prepared to help him by supplyin g the answers to their own questions and he is at la st allowed to make anecdota l detours and to lead the conversat ion himself (70). So the question in line 72 echoes Jamano's remark, the indi sputable fact that he vomited ; as a question , it a llows him to repeat himse lf, which prompts further details from the audience (74, 75, 77). Where these are cast in the form ofa question, they are more rheto ri ca l than interrogat ive, and the tone of susp icio n in lines 38 to 64 ha s been softened (75 , 77) . From now on , the living will begin to s upply the facts abnut hi s last movements, words and even feelings (87). The very same kind of ques tion which ea rlier had been used as a test (,Whom did you meet?', 'What did you say to each other?'), ha s now become a vehicle for the living to tell their own versions: the questions, where they are st ill interrogative, tend to beco me lead in g questions . Thus the woman who speaks lines 81,83, 85 and 87 has presumably already been given a purportedly verbatil1l account by Sangganen of what Jamano had said to her just before he died, and is determined to go over the details, with him in agreement. Where he may have been at a loss in line 86, the way in which she cuts in with line 87 suggests that they regard the work of the test as complete and that adequate verisimilitude has been established.

The verdict is developed in an atmosphere of shared consciousness between victim and mou/'l1ers (lines 105-27) :
This roasting imagery , in which the victim is skewered through the anus ' like a squirrel', is conventional for Ra 'tud. 1amano's sarcastic reference to an earlier, failed diagnosis helps to authenticate this, the true one. This verdict so far contains two elements: Ra'tud-Sonum, explaining the symptoms, and Mengalu's sorcery, explaining the motive. Each of these is now progressively developed and a link, at first tenuous, is forged between
them. At the same time, the interlocutors' earlier mood of interrogation is
The inqllesl 011 Jail/OlIO I 15
finally replaced by one of pity and compassion. Through the graphic ima gery of the ex peri ence of being killed by Ra 'tud-Sonum, we a lso see the beg inning of a subtle conflation between 1amano's s upposed perception of the event and that of hi s interlocutors, between the 'subjective' and 'object ive' perspectives. In line 56, 1amano first mentioned hi s own feelings of di stress in th e mo st un specific terms, then in line 71 , with the symptom of vomiting, which the leadin g question in line 72 showed to be the publicly accepted fact that he had vOlllited blood. When the topic of sy mptom s was take n up again, in line 87 , it wa s in th e terms with which 1amano was credited with having described hi s own inner feelings. The symptoms were not referred to again in external terms , but the image wa s immediately developed in hi s own word s into the unmistakeabl e imagery of Ra ' tud which , though experienced by him , is also accepted by everyone as part of the world which they all share: sujlillgji 'they're prodding me' (102, 104), pada/'Ie 'is racked ' (102), 1I101lingji 'they're roasting me' (104). Lines 109 If will show tha t from now on the thread of continuity from the objective vomiting to the subjective experiencing of Ra'tud has become complete and beyond doubt: 1amano's interlocutors, too, feel his agony to the extent of supplying gratuitous details themselves (109 , 111 - 13). This shared consciousness , as it may perhaps best be called, of victimhood, corresponds to the dynamics of the situation. With 1amano's death by Ra'tud, his relatives themselves become vulnerable as potential victims of his new-found Ra'tud mode of being. Meanwhile the theme of sorcery remains bound up with all of this, especially for Ranatang. There is a tension between his implicit certainty about the sorcerer's identity and his quest for confirmation of this certainty from his father. 1amano's dogged refusal to be explicit (see line 16) only stokes up Ranatang's rage as his questioning becomes increasingly frantic (91, 105, 123 , 126) .

Extract ./i'om tlie remainder o.l tlie dialogue: tlie scope o.l tlie final verdict (lilies 154--6) :
The dialogue at an inquest does not confine itse lf to the causes of death. At this point the conversation moved on to a succession of topics. First, another potential quarrel (and potential so rcery suspicion), involving so meone in the room , was aired and smoothed ove r. Then Jama no dwelled for some time on his own prominent status and spent a whole hour on a delailed tally of the money which people owed him , with the story behind each loan. These debts, which will now be administered by Ranatang, were thereby made public knowledge and accepted or disputed by his interlocutors. For example, Raduno, who did not have regular dealings with Jamano and did not attend, seemed amazed to hear from me afterwards that he owed money to the dead man; but much later he told me that he had since remembered an old debt of precisely the sum mentioned . Finally the conversation returned to the means of Jamano's death, but this time focussing on the hitherto obscure role of Mo'mo', who had acted as ringleader of the Ra'tud-People. Mengalu's sorcery and Mo'mo"s Ra'tud symptoms had by now both been strongly developed. But why was Mo'mo' interested in causing Jamano's death? It now turned out that he had acted on the instruction of Jamano's dead wife Onsam. The division of responsibility between these people and Mengalu is complex and throws great light on the kind of links which the Sora make between the phenomenology of illness and its interpretation in terms of human motivation . The diagnosis shou ld combine both a motive and a shared experience of a form of death . Mengalu's sorcery provides the motive, while Mo'mo"s role as Ra'tud ringleader explains the symptoms. However, the link between Mengalu and Mo'mo' remains unexplained. IfMo'mo' had had his own motive for killing Jamano by means of the symptoms at his command, the case would have been a simple one. But in many cases, the symptoms surrounding a death do not correspond with those at the command of the dead person whom for other reasons the deceased will name as the agent of death. In such cases, as with Jamano's wife here, it emerges that the person with the motive has acted through the agency of an Experience which she herself has not undergone and whose symptoms she

there fore does not comm a nd direc tly: she 'se ll s' (t enl-) the vIc tIm to a member of th e other E xpe ri ence or ' hires ' (balii -) the Ex peri ence- member to attack her intended victim. Similarly, when a death is motivated by a living sorcerer, he 'ensorce ll s' (abtaj-) a nd ' bind s' (jing-) the vi ctim by ma kin g a pact with a dea d person. T he latte r then acts through her own Experi ence or incites som eone else a mon g the dead to do so. Jama no 's case is thu s one of th e more elaborate ones , brin ging into play a chain of severa l links. By the end of th e afternoon the asse mbled compan y had established the followin g ex pl a nation , clarifyin g elements whic h I suspect had bee n partially aired in the preliminary inquest. M e nga lu had obtained Jamano's exuviae and with them performed actions and uttered word s of sorcery. These induced or encouraged Jamano 's dead wife , On sam , to act. Thou gh she resides in an Earth -Sonum , her marria ge with her hu sband ha d not bee n very clo se (t//1IY//II) , so that she wa s unable to ' take' him unaided to join her. In thi s context I was told by way of contrast about other elderly people in close marriages, especially men, who pine to death rapidly after losing a beloved spouse. This is often diagnosed at their inquests as the result of the action of the predeceased wife who is lonely in the Underworld. So the implication of the reference to Onsam seems to be that her husband did not miss her enough, and that she found a way to force him to join her. To do this, she 'sold' him to Mo'mo ' , who is her lineage brother and thus still close to her in the Underworld . Through the circumstances of his own death, Mo'mo' is one of the ringleaders of Ra 'tud-Sonum. Perhaps addi tionally motiva ted (I could not be sure of this) by the common tension between a woman's husband and her brother, he then led his Ra ' tud companions in their fatal assault on Jamano. The symptoms and motive for Jamano's death were thus joined in a chain containing several links. The primary agent among the dead , Mo ' mo ', is most plausible in terms of Experience but least motivated . He is incited to act by Onsam , who thou gh not plausible in terms of Experience has a t least some degree of motiva tion . Finally, the impetus ori gina tes with a sorce rer , Mengalu , who since he is alive is outside the idiom of Experience but whose motive is very strong indeed. The motive of the first is superseded in explanatory power by that of the second , which in turn is superseded by that of the third. The verdict of Ra'tud-Sonum amounts to more than the mere fact of Jamano's membership ofRa 'tud , which is after all a very common cause of death . It takes account of many elements and amounts to a summary of his life and works. It acknowledges a lack of passion in his marri a ge, to the extent that his dead wife turns to her own lineage-brother for support.

All in all , the dead man and his living interlocutors have worked to gether to build up an intimate and subtle portrait of a personality, derived from the sum of his social interactions. Precisely because it is publicly composed , this portrait reaches into the future and so serves as a vehicle for working out the complex Sora idea s about continuity between persons. Ranatang is well equipped temperamentally to inherit not only Jamano's property and loans, but also his role as leader and protector. In such a strong household , too, the sisters and daughters are likely to continue to be reluctant to leave home for marriage, and will thus continue to contribute to its further prosperity. Uda , in my judgement a weaker personality, will now ride on



120 Dialogues with the dead
Ranatang's back as he previously did on Jamano's , but will be a stronger asset with his role as a funeral shaman now firmly estab li shed. He has long practised as a divination shaman and has only recently acquired the different set of raudas who now enable him to sit at a funeral. This is the first time he has actually performed. Several factors suggest why he may have become a funeral shaman and done so at this moment. His settlement, Tongseng, was aiming to become independent of the main village of Alinsing and every village should have its own funeral shaman; the on ly other funeral shaman in that settlement (an in-marrying old woman) had died recently; and Uda was particularly concerned about the interpretation of his brother's death , which had been expected for a lon g time. Meanwhile, Mengalu's tragedy continues to unfold as the consequences of an early moral error push him yet one step further a long the scapegoat's path to perdition. When T revisited him in 1984, Mengalu was seriously ill and people were saying behind his back that his sorcery sonums had turned on him because he could not feed them with an adequate stream of victims (yil'tudle, 'the fire has turned on him '). Every time tha t Jamano is diagnosed as the cause of a sickness among his descendants, it will be a reminder of any or all of these elements of his own biography and in the biographies of those around him.

Redeeming the dead and protecting the living
Jamano's funeral continued: cosmic rescue by his Ancestors At the conclusion of the divination which took place on the day of Jamano's stone-planting, a verdict was reached regarding the relationship between the deceased and the ultimate motivator of the attack, incorporating on the way all those through whom this relationship was considered to pass. The terms in which the dialogue is cast have differentiated Jamano into two aspects. In the first of these, he is a member of an Experience, in the second, an Ancestor to the descendants who perform his funeral. He has 'become Ra'tud' (Ra'tuden gaddle) yet he remains father, grandfather, husband or uncle to those he left behind. The former aspect is necessa rily unpleasant for him and hostile and aggressive to us; the latter is relatively pleasant for him and benign towards us. What does this hard -won distinction mean for those left a live? The present chapter will begin the examination of how his dual nature moulds future relations between the dead man and his survivors. It will become apparent that the long-term aim is to make him into a pure Ancestor and thereby eliminate entirely his Experience aspect. But the reader who remembers the discussion in chapter 4 of the mutual incompatibility of Ancestor space and Experience space will not be surprised to be told that this cannot be accomplished in one step. Establishing the causes of death is only the first of several moves made with Jamano's future condition in mind. Apart from the inquest and the actua l planting of the stone, a number of other important acts were performed on the day of his stone-planting. Twenty-one buffalos were sacrificed by various lineage members and affines, an unusually large number which reflected Jamano's importance; for severa l hours the Ancestor-Men formed two teams and sang a kata dialogue representing

Desp ite the tensions amo ng the central characters, those peopl e who were less close ly invo lved ate, drank a nd danced a lot and had a good time as a lways a t fun e ral s. So me of them p robab ly flirted and took a step towards future mar ri ages. For Jamano him se lf, the day was a c rucial rite of transition. Eve n whil e the inquest was go ing o n in side the ho use, o lltsid e the Ancestor-Men were struggling to free him from his membe rship of Ra ' tud -Sonum. The Sora word for this resc uin g is landi-. This is a n act ive, transitive verb and its object is not the Experi ence Ra ' tud but the dead person. The Experiences exist as given categories, as their mappi ng across the land sca pe shows: wha t matters is where people move among them. The root l(fl/- mean s 'change', while the mea ning of the root di- is uncerta in ; the word l(fndi- is used in a doublet with uJ'{/i-, in which the root ur- mea ns ' un tie '. The overall semantic c1ima te of the pair is thus clearly one of transfonna tion a nd relea se of the dead person. For reasons to be given in the co mmentary to lines 40- 6 below, I sha ll translate landi- as ' redeem'. Thi s redemption is effected by the words chanted by the Ancestor-Men in their solemn monotone. They sing in the collective person a of a ll the Ancestors of the entire linea ge and this is the only kind of song I have seen where the singers fuss about correct and careful performance. I shall give extracts frqm two of the eig ht such cha nts which as one of Jamano's Ancestor-Men I took part in sin gin g on that day . The first (text 6. 1) is in the persona of the ma le Ancestors, while the second (text 6.2) , which gives some additional imagery, is in the persona of the female Ancestors. Some poetic words have been left as untra nslata ble since my Sora friends themselves were unable to gloss them . Eve n more than with the prose texts in other chapters, one could here comment endless ly on obscure ima ge ry. However, I sha ll keep comments to the minimum necessary for a reasonable degree of comprehension in passing or in order to draw attention to points which will be taken up elsew here.

The Ancestors now start to sin g of the mea ns they will e mploy to rescue lamano. They will ransom him , or buy him back, from the Expe ri e nce . In this sense the redemption expressed by the verb tandi- exactly reverses the act of sellin g (i em -) which linked him to Onsam , who 'so ld ' him to the Ra't ud - people; while its doublet Ul'di-, ' unti e', re verses the verb used of Mengalu ' s sorcery: jing -, ' bind'. The translation ' redeem ' for tandi- is intend ed to capture not only the e leme nt of sa lvation in a theological sense but a lso that of commercial tra nsaction drawn from contact with merc hants at the weekly marke ts (eve n the buffalos sacrificed to so num s have to be bou g ht in the markets). The coins used are round , flat seed s from plants the names of which Sora also use in 'deep- lang uage' (e .g. in front of Pano trade rs who do not have a n intima te knowledge of Sora) to mea n ' mon ey ' :

Though monkeys do die, they are co nside red lon g- lived on account of their wrinkled, leat hery buttock s and their white hair. Also , they a re the only animals who can become shamans and go into trance, just as human shamans become mon keys when they make their descent into the realm of the dead .

To what extent has the dead man been changed on the day of his stone-planting? At first sight the answer seems paradoxical. On the one hand, by words like these, sung throughout the day, he has been not just redeemed, but transformed. On the other hand, as with any Sora transition, much of the change which has taken place is not definitive, but reversible: despite his redemption, he will continue to afflict the living with the form of his own suffering. How is this so? We can perhaps approach this by first considering another, relatively simple aspect of today's transformation, one which by now is indeed irreversible. The two stages of the inquest on Jamano show the importance of the verbal articulacy of the deceased. Even on the day of the first inquest, but certainly from today, the day of the stone-planting, Jamano is no longer a ghost (fatlman). The story at the head of part II says that the dead woman remained a ghost until her husband understood the need for a proper funeral procedure of cremation and stone-planting. But she was unable to tell him this for herself. Fresh from the shock of dying, coated with ash from the pyre, a ghost does not understand what has happened to her and continues to return home where
Redeeming the dead alld protecting the living 129
she can sometimes be heard rummaging around the cooking pots looking for food. Out of doors, too , her rela tives sometimes catch glimpses of her in the forest. It is their sad duty to explain to her that she no longer belongs in her own home, or at least not in this form. Her confusion is associated by the Sora wi th the ondrung (false awareness) for which the last chapter shows Jamano was still being tested at his stone-planting inquest. The significance of the ghost stage becomes clearer from the way a ghost interacts with the living. Ghosts have bloodshot eyes which are not at the fron t bu tat the back of their heads, so tha t if you suspect tha t the person you have met is a ghost, the way to find out is to lift up their hair at the back and see if the real eyes are underneath . They can cause fits by 'swallowing up' (molesid-) people, and children in particular are terrified of walking past a cremation site in the days immediately following a cremation. The fits which a ghost causes can be treated, not through the ela bora te verbal format of a healing rite, but at best only with plant medicines. A ghost is terrifying and dangerous precisely because it is inarticulate and incapable of negotiation through dialogue. Perhaps Jamano had already ceased being a ghost when the first inquest was held the morning after he was cremated. Certainly, the inquest presupposes a high degree of articulacy, so that people sometimes say that the ghost state ceases immediately on cremation and that a dead person is incorporated from that moment into the Experience sonum responsible for his death. But at the first inquest there are some indications that the deceased is in some respects still a ghost: there is no dancing to accompany the drumming, and when he arrives he is given only water to drink (see chapter 8), rather than wine as befits a proper sonum. These uncertainties have been resolved by the day of his stone-planting. So today's song is more a declara tion of intent than a fully accomplished action. Rather than setting the seal on his transformation, the song of redemption initiates new possibilities in the evolution of the deceased and in living people's relationships with him. Ifwe consider how this had earlier worked for the dead people who caused Jamano's death, we see that they have long ceased to be ghosts . But despite the transformations and redemptions to which they were subjected at their own funerals, Onsam and Mo'mo' were still able and willing to use an Experience to cause Jamano's death. This will now be equally the case with Jamano's own potential to cause illness and death in others. For all the confident and assertive tone of the Ancestor-Men's chant, the transition which they aim to effect remains painfully provisional, sometimes for several years. This leaves the living constantly vulnerable. The newly-redeemed state of the



130 Dia/ogues Il'ilh Ihe dead
deceased is very precarious and he often returns to his original death Exper ience. T hi s is known because he is revealed in diagnoses for hi s sick descendants as having attacked them in this form . The word for doing this isgorod-, which is also the ordinary word for ' wander'. In the context of the movement of the dead between two cosmo logica l locations, the Sora illustrate this by a smooth waving of the hand from side to side, as though the word a lso meant ' oscillate'. This is perhaps the closest So ra comes to expressing in a sin gle word the paradox of the simultaneou s existence of a dead person in two incompatibl e places. In the context ofsonums, the verb gol'Oc/- cove rs the ent ire field of moveme nt by which so nums defy the wishes of the living. One ca n say equally tha t 'Jamano wanders [between states), (JaI11C/1/O gor odl e) or that 'Ra'tud -So num wanders [from one victim to th e next]' (Ra'lud-stlll gorodl e).
Let us first exa mine the latter usa ge, which shows the dynamic force of the state in which the dead person is caught up. This usage amounts to saying that the Experience sonums are infectious or contagious, in that they perpetuate themselves on to new victims. This is said not so much of Earth and Ra'tud as of the rarer or more shocking forms of death - Leopard, Convulsion, Sun (i.e. suicide and accidental death) , Smallpox and Sorcery (the last one is common, though it acts in collaboration with one of the others). These, the more acutely contagious Experience sonums, are capable of moving relentlessly from one member ofa family to another and often among friends, acquaintances and lovers. The contagion 'enters' (gclI1 -) the body of a potential victim and must be removed by a shaman. Sometimes, though not always, it takes what one might call a material or quasi-material form (anoki). For example, for Leopard and Sorcery, this is usually a black hairy caterpillar which people can see being extracted during healings; for Sun it is the blood of the previous victim seeking to enter a body, or sometimes jagged splinters of pig bone; while for Smallpox it is the speck led (rige) seeds of the gra m plant (rogo) which SmallpoxWoman (Ruga-boj) flings against the victim's body to sow them , where they sprout as pustules. However, Sora usage does not recognise a distinction between the 'material' and the 'immaterial'. Their imagery is sensory : whatever the cause, whether more orIess contagious, you may 'feel' (1/1'1 -) a 'power' (renabli) working upon yourself just as well as you can feel a caterpillar, as the attacking sonum 'strokes' (Sl/l1-) you as a preliminary to 'seizing' (Fiam-) or 'ta king' (pang-) you. This may be accompanied by a dramatic narrative experience, such as Jamano's of being pounced on and beaten up . Similarly, when someone lies seriously ill he is exhorted, ' If they're offering you food [i.e. of the dead], don't take it, don't eat it!' (cf.
Redeelllillg Ih e dead alld proleclillg Ih e lil'illg 131
chapter 5, lin e 77) and ifhe recovers he may recount his struggle to resi st the temptation to eat. Such dangerous, contagious movement shou ld be prevented. So parallel to the stone-plaliting with its redemption of the deceased , a rite may be performed to ' block' the Experience from perpetuating itse lf on to the living. This is not done for the majority of act ual deaths (which are ca used by Ra ' tud and Eart h) but only for those which occur through an Experience which is highly contagious, the insta nces of which (apart from the admixture of sorcery) are not numerically frequent. The word for this , dallg-, again a spat ial word , is that co mmonly used of obstructing a path , damming a strea m , etc. Here its gra mm at ica l object is not the deceased, as

in redeemin g, but the Experience itse lf. We may note the simila rity between these blockin g rites and the fending offin rites of healin g. In both cases, the dangerou s so num is led out of the house and discharged into Experience space. A hea ling rite is performed each time a person is stroked by a sonum, in order to forestall hi s being taken. A blocking rite is done once only , as a pre-emptive move immediately after a death . In anticipation of any future attacks, it covers the full range of potential livin g victims. For example, a dea th by Sun or Smallpox threatens a whole village, one by Leopard, Convulsion or Sorcery usually only the hou sehold and other intimates of the deceased. But the sense in which an Experience 'wanders' is a limited one. Ultima tely , Experiences act only through personal agents. The reason why an illness wa nders between people is that the deceased himself ha s wandered from his state of Ancestorhood back to his death -Ex perience: 'Jamano wanders', Jal11ano gorodte. The emphasis here is not on the property of contagiousness, which to a greater or lesser degree characterises all the Experiences since all are perpetuated and repeated . Rather, it is on the instability of the deceased person 's own redeemed state. This instability is regressive, so that the best translation of this second use of gorod- might be 'revert'. The Ancestor-Men have clearly stated the dead person's proper and desirable destination, yet the deceased has great difficulty in reaching it and staying there.
Social order among the dead: Earth-Sonum as a transitional stage between Experience and Ancestor Jamano remains confused, or perhaps uncommitted, regarding the transformation which has been wrought upon him today. In ontological terms, he seems to find it difficult to be changed from one kind of sonum to another and to hold himself in that new state because of the complexity of this transformation . Cosmologically, this uncertainty in his state of mind corresponds to the extent of the gulf between his starting point and his destination. The Sora express movement across this gulf as a journey over cosmological space, but the ultimate nature of his transforma tion is a social one. The Experience which killed Jamano sundered him from his kin . As will become increasingly clear in later chapters, the process of redemption in the funeral cycle undoes the work of the Experience only in order to reconstitute in the Underworld a continuation of the social order which existed among the living. In rescuing Jamano, the Ancestors are substituting themselves for the attacker. Just as the Ra ' tud-Men (Ra'tud-marenji), led by Mo 'mo ', had earlier taken Jamano into their own Experience, so the Ancestors now take
f
Redeeming th e dead and protecting the living 133
him into their own co llectivity. Regardless of the various forms of their ow n deaths , they are in this context Exper ience-free. Thus in the redemp tion so ng sun g in the persona of Jamano 's female Ances tors, his wife Onsam was listed even ' though she had incited her brother Mo'mo' to kill him . Sim il arly, the attackers' ringleader Mo'mo' would nonetheless have been en umerated among Jamano's Ancestors if he had been a member of the deceased's lineage (a s Mo'mo' just happens not to be). For them, as now for Jamano him se lf, the choice between being an Ancestor and being a member of a n Experience is only a choice between modes of being: each dead person can ex ist in different modes at different moments. Jamano is thus subject to two kinds of agency, each of which is linked to two quite different groups of persons. These two groups are analogous, both in their power of agency and in the fact that their members have their own mutual relationships and hi sto rical reasons for being with eac h other. But the mem bership of these two groups does not necessarily overlap and their inner social texture is quite different: the Experience group where Jamano was lonely among wretched company, and the comforting society of his rescuing Ancestors. The Ancestors, on whose behalf I sang along with three or four other Ancestor-Men , represent the lineage with its constant reservoir of male names which we listed exhaustively at each stage of the funeral sequence. Within this overall list, the ordering of names in the chant reflects the current articulation of the lineage into branches and twigs . These names are eventually returned to living descendants and their original holders die a second death and disappear. An Experience sonum, on the other hand, contains a number of people who have shared a similar form of death. These, too, are articulated into chains of predecessors and successors, according to the stories behind each person's recruitment. The current attacker at any moment is one of the most recent recruits who acts as a ringleader while the earlier victims support him as shadow-men. Over time, as the latest victims become ringleaders themselves, the oldest shadow-men eventually disappear without trace just like the oldest Ancestors. So in theory , if an observer returned at any time in the future, the residential Experiences would be the same except that the particular people involved (that is, the lists of names) would be quite different. Unlike a lineage, an Experience's list of names is non-repeatable because it contains an agglomeration of persons whose coming together is partly contingent. The residential Experience is thus a self-perpetuating corporate group like the lineage, except that rather than begetting new members, it recruits them on the grounds of a shared form of death . The Experiences are a crude perversion or parody of the lineages which they perpetually strive to subvert. Redemption aims to restore in the

T he lea p betwee n the two modes of bein g a nd betwee n th e two kind s o f social group comes a bout throug h the interm ediary category or Ea rth So num. T hi s will require so me prelimina ry exa min a tion here, since thi s ca tegory will becolll e more and more promin ent in later cha pters. On the one ha nd , Ea rth -Sonum is an Ex peri ence cau sin g illness a nd death , jus t like Sun-Sonum , Leopa rd -Sonulll or Ra' tud -Sonulll. On the o ther ha nd , it brings togeth er groups of pa trilineal kin sfolk after their redemption , in a way which Illakes it close to the concept of A ncestorhood . It is in this sense of Earth -S on um tha t the dead nourish th eir descenda nts throu gh the soul-force which they put into growin g crops. There are thu s two ways of coming to resid e in Earth -S onul1l. One way is to die with appropriate symptoms, which for reason s to be ex plained below usually involve a swelling of the body or a blocka ge of its orifices. Thi s happen s only to some people. The othe r way, wl'lich ha ppen s to everyone , is to be led there by one's Ancestors as part of one's redemption. I Earth-Sonum has several properties which make possible this dual role. In the first place, it lies at the lowest point in the cosmos of any Experience and is the nearest to the Underworld where the dead reside in their capacity as Ancestors . It is thus the Experience furthest removed from the Sun and , indeed , it explicitly reverses the Sun's imagery of amorphousness and molten ma terial. The imagery of Earth-Sonum encompasses coolness, wholeness, integrity a nd the retention and concentration of form , an imagery which can be applied to both the person and the group . But to reside in Earth-Sonum is still not fully equivalent to being in the state of Ancestorhood. Earth-Sonum can also be an Experience causing illness and death. The swellings and blockages which it causes, such as constipation or death in childbirth , are part of that very imagery of wholeness and retention. Moreover, the groups of persons whom it reuni tes after dea th are not the entire lineages of Ancestors which were enumerated in chapter 6: there are many different Earth-Sonum sites spread out across the landscape and each one of them brings together only one of the many disjointed fragments of the lineage. So just as there are oppositions between kin-groups, so the hig hly articulated internal structure of the category Earth-Sonum contains within itself the potential for opposition and conflict between different exemplars of the category. Nonetheless, residence in Earth-Sonum is an essential staging-post on the journey to full Ancestorhood. This can be clearly seen if we contrast it to its polar opposite in cosmological terms , Sun-Sonum. In figure 6.1 I have



136 Dialogues with the dead
tried to show the full vertical range of so num space. It develops fi gure 4. 1, which showed how Ancestor space reaches from the village downwards while Experience space exte nd s from the jungle upwa rd s. Apart from th e Sun , a ll other Experience sites lie horizonta lly on the same level as we ourselves live (cf. fi gure 4.3). Some of these a re sli ghtly raised in rocks or trees, while others, such as Ra'tud sites on paths and cro ssroads, usually lie flat on the ground . The Eart h-So num sites, located in the springs and water so urces which a llow huma n settlement and cultiva tion , are the only sites which dip below ground level. They lie at the furthest ex treme from the Sun but reach down towards the Underworld. Jamano 's rescue from his Ra ' tud site involves a downward movement towards the Underworld a nd is just one phase of the downward journey made by all person s during the course of their existence, from th e Sun to the Underworld . This progression moves through three levels and stages: in the Sun before birth, on the ground durin g life, and underground after death . The polar opposition between Earth-Sonum and Sun-Sonum is clearly reflected in their imagery. Earth-Sonum consolidates and concentrates a person's being. Instead of the Sun's dissolution and amorphousness, Earth-Sonum builds on the imagery of integrity and wholeness. The location ofEarth-Sonum in springs is associated with coolness rather than heat, water as opposed to fire . Instead of Sun-Sonum's dirt and bodily leavings (chapter 3), Earth-Sonum emphasises cleanliness through the affirmation of the body's outline during washing. This was done for the first time at birth with turmeric (a cooling 'Earth' medicine) and remains an important, enjoyable and sociable operation carried out every day of one's life. Extending this imagery, we can note that unlike the low Blacksmith castes of the Sun, when Earth-People are conceived as Hindus they belong to the ksatriya Paik caste (in Sora, Aleng or Yoi) , whose women wash frequently , 'a lways look freshly groomed ' a nd a re bedecked with flowers in their hair. There is a similar contrast between Earth-Sonum and Sun-Sonum as causes of illness and dea th . As was explained in chapter 3, the foetus is forged in the heat of the Sun's smithy but must be cooled when it enters the realm of the living in order to separate it fully from the microcosm of Sun-Woman's forge in the womb of its mother. Sun-Woman's python retrieves the baby if this separation is inadequate. Throughout life, Sun illnesses cluster round a set of sub-Experiences to do with scorching and melting, such as open sores, while the Sun is also the residence for the victims of accidents, murder or suicide, as well as for blacksmiths and
Redeelllillg the dead and protecting the living 137
ma lformed persons such as the dumb and the lame (see chapter 4 to understand ho w for the Sora verbal articul acy is as important as wholeness of body for a fullne ss of being in the broadest sense) . All of these death s are associated with 'heat, uncerta inty of form or lack of articulacy. At the moment of dea th a perso n passes once more tlHo ugh a heat which di sso lves and reorders hi s person. It seems to me significa nt that, just as a baby is born unab le to speak, so the fire of the fune ra l pyre once aga in disorients the fres hl y deceased person and produces the in a rticulacy o f the ghost (/([{ll1Ian) a nd the confusion of ondrung (,false awareness').2 A person who dies a Slln -dea th reverses the norm a l downward trajectory and the gulf which opens up between hi s redeemed and unredeemed states is the wides t possibl e. This is reflected in the special procedures for a Slln-victim's stone-planting. The A ncesto r-Men 's chant of redemption is not enough to rescue him. They also create a path across the open space between earth and sky by firing a stream of a rrows into the sky to create a ladder. M ea nwhile , indoors, the funeral shaman ties a thread from the pitch of the roof to the mortar beneath and fastens a metal bracelet or swo rd to the bottom of this thread . Sitting on the mortar for her trance, she then coaxes the deceased down the thread, through the metal object, and into her body. An Ancestor-Woman sets the thread alight a t the bottom so that it burns upwards. Sora say that this destroys the dead person's return pa th and leaves him the path through the mortar to the Underworld as the only available route out of the house. As a cause of illness and death, Earth-Sonum's imagery of wholeness a nd retention explicitly reverses this imagery of dissolution and release. The sy mptoms of an Earth attack are the blockage of bodily orifices and the co nstriction of bodily emissions: a general swelling or bloating (pungpung) of the body, especially of the stomach or, for men , the scrotum; the ina bility to urinate or the pa ssing of blood in urine; constipation ; and for women, death in childbirth . Attractive male oboists who play with their puffed cheeks near springs are also susceptible to rape by female Earth-Sonum
dwellers. I shall give some examples of deaths caused directly by Earth -Sonum. The persons involved are all close relations ofMengalu and are shown on a genealogy in figure 6.2, where they are numbered for ease of reference . Though I shall refer to some of these people later, it is not necessary for the reader to note their identi ties in detail since what matters here is simply the sense of a chain of recruitment, analogous to the generations of a lineage, which is common to all the Experience sonums.

Rumbana (I), a middle-aged man, bought the land containing thi s site from someone in another village and started to work it. He habitu a lly tethered his ca ttle near the spring and their dung and urine seeped into the water. As a consequence he died of an inflated scrotum caused by the insulted Earth-Sonum.
He was the first victim in Alinsing. Soon afterwards, his fellow lineage-member Bumbuden died , also in middl e-age. Bumbuden (5) did not own or work the site but often herded his cattle on a nearby hillside . Being thirsty there, he stole the wine from trees belonging to another village as it hung in pots waiting to be collected. So the men of that village put some earth from his footprints into a pot with some sorcery-medicine and sealed up the pot's mouth, thereby sealing in his breath, urine and faeces . 'It was as if they had tied up his penis and plugged up his anus' (a lo 'ojenjile}i amrid do a sambin tlldable}i amrid). In the inquest it emerged that they had hired (bail'i-) his recently-deceased lineage-brother Rumbana to produce these Earth symptoms and that Rumbana had then taken him to reside with him in Hollow Water Earth site.

This site is worked by Mengalu and so me of hi s linea ge- brothers. It is notorious for ca usin g deat h in childbirth . His au nt Mabmati (6) died in thi s way and en te red this Ea rth -Sonum . Subseq uentl y she ' took' her niece Ra 'gi (9) , a young unmarried girl. Ra ' gi had become pregnant for the first time after an embarrassing liaison and her mother, Daiani, administered a botched a bortion which resulted in the death not only of the fo etus but a lso of Ra'gi. Since her own death Ra'gi ha s caused the death of her close linea ge-siste r Gadi (7) during he r first pregnancy and Gadi has since taken her own younger sister Pui 'jan (8) in the sa me way. Ra'gi also took in old age her mother, Daiani (4) , because the latte r had unintentionally caused her dea th. At so me point, also, Ra' gi took Nedraki (2) who in turn took Sa ndi (3) . The chain of recrui tme nt among Rere Earth si te victims is shown in figure 6.3, where the analo gy of an Experience to a lineage can be clearly
seen . There are many non-fatal attacks by all these people against others. In the terms of cha pter 4, these are remi nders from the dead to the living, who respond to them with rites of healing (and of acknowledgement). On one occasion while I was there, Mengalu suffered pain in urinating. This was diagnosed as being caused by Ra'gi and he recovered after getting a shaman to lead her out of his house in a banishing-rite along the path towards Rere Earth site. It was the association of excretion with childbirth which allowed Mengalu's urinary problem to be explained by the action of his predeceased sister. The song sung by the shaman included the following words:

Informants explained this and similar texts by saying that an EarthSonum blocks the birth of a child by pushing the baby back up the birth canal to prevent its emergence. This imagery contrasts strikingly with that of the Sun who as blacksmith-embryologist creates the conditions of heat whereby cores split, boundaries melt and one entity can separate out into two . In a normal birth the sealing of boundaries is achieved after the birth by washing and applying cool medicines and songs to both mother and child separately. Here , by contrast, the sealing seems to have been applied in advance to the mother-plus-child as a unit in order to prevent the birth.

The Ancestors residin g in the Ea rth -Sonum ca n be hostile to such bodily sepa ration s and seek to repress them. The residents of an Earth -Sonum will never attack the child bea ring wives of the men who cultivate its site, that is, the wives of their own kinsmen. They attack only their daughters and sisters, that is, women who were born into their own kin-group but who are noW producing babies on behalf of other lineages . A woman 's natal Ea rth -Sonum is at its most virulent during her first la bour, when the transfer of her loyalty to another lineage is a t its most delicate and provisional. Where they block this labour , her Ancestors seem to be fi ghting to prese rve the integrity of their own group through the analogy of the body of their daughter. The reader may remember the impulse of the male-centred household to accumulate wives and retain sisters and that thi s desire is fulfilled only slightly in life above ground but wholly in the shamans' incestuous marriages in the Underworld (chapter 3) . As part ofa woman's gradual separation from her father's house, the physical bond between herself and her chi ld changes into a lineal bond between the child and its father. The mother produces the child through the Sun's heat, while the father then converts this act of physical division into one of generational succession for himself and his group. He does this by means of grain containing something of his own Ancestors (and chapter 3 showed how a wife's natal kin often fight back in the same idiom , by continuing to give her some of their own grain). A person who is ' in' an Earth site is also in the 'soul' (puradan) of all grain which grows out of that Earth. That person enters (gclI1 -) his descendants' house every time a harvest is taken in from the threshing floor and stored in the loft. Like previous Ancestors, then, 1amano has now 'become' (gach/-) the grain of his descendants . This grain will be pounded in the mortar, cooked on the hearth and swallowed daily in each of their houses. At his stone-planting, the words of the Ancestor-Men at which Mengalu broke down in tears were (sung in 1amano's persona):
I have become lineage food I have become lineage grain I have become Underworld-journey rice
I have become branch food I have become branch grain I have become straight-path rice
1amano's redemption, then , has two stages or aspects. In the first place, he is rescued from his Experience, Ra'tud-Sonum, and led into the state of Ancestorhood. There, he will be united with all the Ancestors of his entire lineage. But in the second place and partly overlapping with this, as an Ancestor he resides in one Earth site among the several which are available to him, as a member of that Earth-Sonum. Every spring and water source contains a named Earth-Sonum which



142 Dialogues with the dead
accumulates groups of Ancestors associated with living persons who cu ltivate land near that site. To say that someone is in Eart h-So num is to invite the question 'Which one?', meaning 'Wh ich particular spring, which specific exemplar of the overall category?' Each of these sites represents rights to a range of pieces of land which lie in the site's vicinity or are watered from it. This may be the right either to return in later years to the same shifting-cultivation plot or else to convert the plot into terraced paddy-fields. Named Earth sites are thus relevant to the direct heirs of the man who first clears or claims a plot. This is why even among those few close relations of Mengalu in figure 6.2 above, we can already see two separate Earth-Sonums at work, Hollow Water and Rere. The song for the rite (pl/plr) which acknowledged Ra 'gi and healed Mengalu mentions two more and later chapters will show that there are several others within his branch of his lineage, for example Sweet Mango. The total range of a lineage's Earth sites accounts residentially for all its Ancestors and yields a topography of the Underworld which is probably unique to that lineage. Earth-Sonums, then, contain only fragments ofpatrilineages. So despite its imagery of wholeness and integrity, the category of Earth-Sonum is founded on differentiation and the potential for conflict. Its wholeness is still only partial because the dead make choices between Earth sites which can be seen as alternatives or rivals . The differentiation between subgroups of Ancestors even within one patrilineage, looks forward to the eventual splitting of that lineage. In addition, the extent of a married woman's assimilation to her husband's group can be judged only when she herself dies and announces after her death that she has gone to reside with her husband's Ancestors in one of their Earth sites, rather than in a site associated with her own brothers. These tensions will emerge ever more prominently in the following chapters, as we draw away from the immediate context of the stone-planting towards the long-term pattern of relationships of the living with the dead and with each other. In the early stages, the conflict is mainly between a dead person's Experience and Ancestor aspects, that is, it is primarily an ontological dilemma mapped on to a cosmological paradox. Later, the emphasis will move to a conflict between possible Earth sites, one which lies near, though as yet not quite at, the Ancestor aspect of his location and being.
The kaleidoscope of feelings between the living and the dead
There is a further dimension to the dead person's transformation, one which runs consistently throughout both the contrast between Experience and Ancestor and the clashes of interest between rival Earth sites. This is
Redeeming the dead and protecting the li l'ing 143
the psychological dimension, that of the feelings or states of mind of all the persons concerned . Sora appear almost to give primacy to this psychologi ca l dimension, in that feelings often seem to be the ultimate ar biters in conflicts which one might otherwise be tempted to ca ll struct ura l. In developing my discussion of feelings during the following chapters, I sha ll shift the emp hasis progressively from the feelings of the dead as these are co nveyed during trances, to those of the living mourners who speak with
them, in order ultimately to interpret the interdependence of these two voices.
Our first approach to analysing feelings has bee n within the interplay of the dead person 's Experience and Ancestor aspects. By the time of the stone-p lantin g, the So ra fun eral seq uence ha s a lrea dy differentiated the decea sed into these two aspects, with the intention of altering the balance between them a nd even tually eliminating the form er. The inquests on the day after cremation and on the day of the sto ne-planting arrive at a verdict about the Experience which the deceased now shares with his attackers. The song of redemption in the stone-planting rescues him from this Experience and leads him into the state of being an Ancestor in the Underworld as well as a resident of an Earth-Sonum site. For the more contagious of the Experiences, this redemption is further reinforced by the blocking rite which aims to prevent him from ' wandering' back to his Experience and thereby causing its repetition among the living. Since neither the redemption nor the blocking will be totally successful at once, the transformation begun at this time is gradually reinforced by healings, or acknowledgements, each time the deceased brings himself to the a ttention of the living by making them ill. After an attack in his undesirable Experience aspect, he is given a ba nishing-rite; at other times, in his relatively desirable Ancestor aspect, he is welcomed and fed inside the house - though always on a tight leash. Though the deceased comes mainly in one aspect at any given manifestation, both his aspects continue to exist for some time as simultaneous possibilities. Why does his redemption not stick at first and how does it eventually come to do so? The people who crowded round the shamans to learn the causes of lamano's death responded to this information with a mixture of pity (abasuYlm), grief (sinta) and outrage (the verb barabda-). However, they expressed these feelings not only for lamano's sake, but also for their own because they shared his sense of victimhood. This awareness of their own vulnerability applies equally to Ra'tud-Sonum as a means and sorcery as a motive. Regarding Mengalu's sorcery, they remark: 'If it's sorcery, if it's witchcraft, that explains why

144 Dialog ues witli tlie dead
your brother's throat is ill and does n' t get better however many sacrifices we do' (chapter 5, line 199), and 'Are we all going to be consumed by this sorcery?, (chapter 5, line 127). Regarding Ra'tud, they understand how Mo'mo' was earlier a victim ofRa'tud and has now become an agent of that Experience. They know that he wa s liable to act upon anyone who fell into his orbit through opportunity and motive and realise that their own Jamano is now himself in the same state. So their pity for Jamano is mingled with apprehension on their own behalf. To this extent they are not, yet, as much victims as he is; but they are all potentially his future victim s. Their vulnerability is only one side of their double susceptibility to the dead , who also nurture them. This impingement cannot be avoided: it is an intrinsic characteristic of people whom one knew while they were alive that they will have this effect on one after their death. As the double usage of the verb gorod-, 'wander', shows, the entities which perpetuate themselves are not so much the Experiences as dead people themselves. The Sora do not insist that every person who dies must of necessity cause further similar deaths. Though all are likely to do so and to make such attempts, some cause several deaths, others none . It is not in the transmission of his Experience that the deceased finds ultimate fulfilment, since a person who has caused one death may still feel the need to cause many more, as Ra'gi continues to do . Rather, it is through the gradual replacement of this destructive and hostile kind of self-perpetuation by another kind, that of protecting and nourishing one's descendants and heirs as their Ancestor . The concepts Experience and Ancestor are simply alternative vehicles for this perpetuation of the person. Their crucial difference is that as members of an Experience, persons perpetuate themselves by causing suffering, while as Ancestors they guarantee a complex social continuity between persons and across time, in which their inclination to attack eventually disappears. So what the living try to steer is the way in which the deceased will affect them, and this attempt is made collectively by those on whose heads his effect, whichever form it takes, will inevitably fall. Through their techniques of redemption and banishing, the survivors seek to modify the effect of Jamano's past over their own future . We are now in a better position to address the question, raised in chapter 4, of why a particular dead person afflicts a particular living person, on a particular occasion, in a particular form. A person's sonum is his mode of continuing to exist not only in death, but also among the living. Kantino's father reminds Kantino of their continuing closeness by sending him a tummy-rumble; Ra'gi brings herself to her brother Mengalu's attention by blocking his urine and thereby perpetuates something of herself in him,
Redeellling tlie dead and protecting tlie living 145
through the livin g out of hi s own life. Th e dead person moves around a chart of sonum space and send s back to the living messa ges, the nature a nd impact of which depend on his location of the moment. Wherever it is, the sonum has the power- indeed , in the Sora vi ew, the necessary property - of a ffecting th e living in a way which corresponds to hi s own stale. Thi s state in turn is knowable because he speaks with them as an autonomous con scious entity which , though materially insubstantial , is a personality of the same order as themselves. Any living person, or group of people who fall together in som e contex t, lives constantly with a repertoire of such sonums. The members of such a group will all experience each of these sonums and to some extent agree on its properties . Indeed , it is this trend towards consensus, so evident in the interrogation of Jamano , which makes the sonum real in a sense similar to that of any other recognised entity in the 'objective' world. As well as its cosmological location, each sonum has its own relations with other sonums, relations with other Living people and potential effects on each of them . These properties are subject to change and manipulation. The relationships expressed by means of sonums can be very diverse, and those revealed in Jamano's case are only one possible configuration . In that example, the potential for Jamano's self-perpetuation through his Experience ofRa'tud means that ifhe attacks his descendants in that form, what will be stirred up is the hostility between his son Ranatang, who has inherited the quarrel, and the supposed sorcerer Mengalu; while if Jamano later comes to reside in Sweet Mango Earth site (the ostensible pretext for his quarrel with Mengalu and a place which Mengalu loves) then his son Ranatang's claim to the disputed land there may be strengthened. Despite any consensus, the story is also likely to have many conflicting sub-plots. Among the dead, on the one hand, each person is sometimes a pure Ancestor, sometimes in an Earth site, sometimes in his original death-Experience, sometimes in an Experience with which he has no necessary connection but to which he has gone temporarily for some purpose of the moment: to join others in an attack, to 'hire' others to do his dirty work, for sex or simply for a drink or a dance. Among the living, on the other hand, there are the mutual relationships of the interlocutors, each affected by the death in a different way and brought during the dialogue into a unanimity which is temporary, artificial and probably never total. In addition, there are the possibly contradictory interpretations in rival inquests performed by people who have occasion to summon the same dead person, sometimes a cross-cousin but usually a married woman caught between two lineages. A case study in chapters 7 and 8 will combine both of



146 Dialogues Ivilh Ihe dead
these, as a courtesy stone-planting staged earlier by Sagalo for his distant cousin (chapter 2) provides a vital link in the interpretation of hi s youn g wife's sudden death . The existence of a progressive movement between various stages of the state of being dead suggests that for our interpretation of dialogue an apprecia tion of the Sora perception of time will be crucial. So far we have seen only the beginning ofth.is process around the moment ofdeath and the first stages of the funeral . Part III will develop a longer perspective over the years and generations following each death . It begins in the following chapter by transcribing a dialogue in which we hear nineteen sonums caught on one particular day in their movement across time. As we hear each sonum speaking to several living persons crowding around the shaman, we shall be able to note the variations in emotional tone between one sonum and another and even within one and the same sonum as it addresses different speakers. These variations will form the foundation of my analysis in the following chapters of time, continuity and feelings.

OPERATING THE CALCULUS OF ALL PREVIOUS DEATHS

Transcription of a dialogue with nineteen dead persons
The dialogues in this chapter constitute text 7. 1.
The transcription presented in this chapter and analysed in the following one took place the day after the dialogue presented in chapter 5, though the occasion is not related. It is taken from a rite staged to heal a small , unnamed baby in Sagalo's lineage . This baby was suffering from diarrhoea and backache caused by Lumbago-Sonum (Du/'i-slm), a sub-Experience of the Sun. Some of the personalities involved will be new. But so tightly woven are the relationships between members of different lineages, that the affairs of this lineage will quickly be seen to intermesh with those of others, especially of Mengalu's branch of the Headman lineage. It is mid-morning on an overcast day at the tail end of the rainy season. A number of people are scattered under a huge wild mango tree by the side of a dusty path leading out of the village. A preliminary summoning of the Ancestors, with a short trance, took place inside the baby's house last night, and this morning these Ancestors have been led out of the house in the banishing-rite format to the village's Lumbago-sacrifice site where the present, more substantial trance takes place. Now the shaman Rondang (an old woman whose nickname means 'Bag of Bones') is sitting on the ground in front of an old winnowing-fan made of basketry. On this are laid out the special apparatus appropriate to Lumbago-Sonum, such as the creeping waterside plant 'Lumbago-Medicine' (dUl'i-/'e) and the toy bow which will fire the caustic ('hot') kernels of the wild cashew (oloj) into the air and over the patient. The edges of the bare space under the tree are littered with remnants of old winnowing-fans from the one hundred or so Lumbago healings which I estimate are done at this site every year: since this is a banishing-rite, the

refuse would be contaminatin g if taken home again. The air is quiet , the people unhurried. F rom time to time a few drops of rain patter on to the leaves of the I~an go tree. People take sw igs from a little pot of aba, the distilled liquor which is the main drink of the cold rainy season and will be offered to each dead person on arr ival. Most of those present are women , draped as always with babies and young children. A few of these women hover around Rondang while the rest watch over the rice boiling above fire-trenches dug in the ground and wait for the men to bring the meat from where they are butchering the buffalo nea rby. The Ancestors of the lineage have ga nged up together to demand a sacrifice from the baby's hou sehold. In doing this, they are not perpetuating their own illnesses (which would of course be very varied) ; rather, they have 'hired ' the Sun to produce symptoms on their behalf. The aspect of the Sun which is available for hire in this way is called Duri-s/111 ('Lumbago /ho bbled/twisted/ cri ppled-Sonum '). The symptoms of Iumbago are ca used by Sun-Woman's slave, the blacksmith Dumb-S un (Mo 'mo'yul1g) , who strikes the patient with his hammer. This can be combined with other symptoms, too , and in fact the dialogue lays equal emphasis on the baby's diarrhoea. The relevant, simplified genealogy ofSagalo's lineage, which is small and impoverished, is given in figure 7.1. The two main branches are related through a distant common ancestor but the histories of their land holdings have now diverged to the point where each branch is associated with a different range of Earth sites. I have summarised the two branches respectively as being associated with the Bat's Nest (Kal1lursll1g) and the Sangkaroren groups of Earth sites. The conversations with the sonums are, as always, conducted largely by women. Most of the time I was the only man present, though there were always several more women present besides those who did most of the talking. However, whether male or female, the interlocutors are largely people who have come to meet ' their' sonums, that is, people close to them. Three households are closely involved today . The occasion is staged by Ikaram , the father of the sick baby and a member of the branch associated wth Sangkaroren Earth site. He is not actually present but spends his time with the men of the lineage who are killing, cutting up and sharing out the buffalo nearby . Those women who are not closely involved in the case are doing the cooking over there too. The mother of the baby, Ikaram's wife Rungkudi, remains with the shaman throughout but does not speak very much or very forcefully since she is in the village of her in-laws, speaking to their Ancestors. Being a young wife, she still feels constrained by



15 2 Dialog ues willt lite dead
'embarrrassment ' (garo}). The baby is still closely attached to her , so that the dialogue sometimes seems to imply that she herself is the patient (e. g. as 'daughter-in-law' in lines 2, 67, 87). Apart from the baby who is today's patient, Rungkudi has two other children, one alive and one dead . Her daughter Amboni (sonum No. 16 below) died of a scarring disease and it is their conversation here which was used to open chapter I of this book. H er teenage son Sarsuno, though alive, has just made a suicide attempt and we shall also meet the sonum of his lineage-brother Palda, the previous suicide victim who encouraged him in this attempt (sonum No. 10). The other two households involved, those of Sagalo and Sindi, both belong to the branch of the lineage associated with Bat's Nest Earth site . Sagalo is known to use from chapter 2. A good-natured young man , he lives with his widowed mother, who is Mengalu's sister. Two years ago , it will be remembered, Sagalo paid a terrible price for a teenage affair with the girl-friend ofMengalu's son Sargia. Mengalu had unleashed this sorcery on Sagalo in angry response to the latter's sexual poaching and it had ricochetted from him on to the defenceless soul of his little brother Mando, who was killed by it. The reader may also remember that the impoverished Sagalo then married the strong-willed and passionate Panderi. In choosing an 'elopement' (dari) with Sagalo, she defied both the restraints imposed by her distant cross-cousin relationship with Sagalo and her brothers' plans for an arranged marriage elsewhere. They were very much in love and by the time of my return in early 1979 they had a one-year-old baby boy. However, four months before today's dialogue, Sagalo suffered a further, most terrible loss. On 1 May 1979 Panderi carried their baby home from a journey and, within a short time, collapsed without warning and died. The verdict of the inquest was that her soul had been eaten by the Ra'tudSonum of one of the villages on the way. But at her inquest the following day, Panderi took great pains to emphasise that the intended victim was the baby himself and that she had been killed only by accident as she was bending over to protect him. We shall hear her repeating this message in the dialogue given here and her inquest will be analysed in the following chapter. Sindi, the last householder involved, is an elderly lady with an acerbic wit. After being widowed, she has stayed on with her own household among her husband's lineage, raising their five children. The eldest, Rutujen, is a grown man in love with a girl from a wealthy home in the Headman lineage whose father will not let her go to live with him. The youngest, Oindo, is still a little boy. Her three middle children have all died within the past few years. One of them, also named Oindo (sonum No . II),

died as a child and passed on hi s name to hi s younger brother who wa s born afterwa rd s; Maianti (No. 17) died as a n adol escent girl ; while her eldes t son Palda (No . 10) is the youth who committed suicide and who having himself 'gone into the' Sun ' has recently tried to persuade Rungkudi's son Sarsuno to kill himself and join him th ere. As a senior woman Sindi acts as the main interlocutor throu ghout the dialogue. It is common for older women to do this. Men tend to join in more on major occasions or if the situation touches them deeply. The male householder's linea ge Ancestors are generally greeted (olong-) by a group of his sisters and wives who offer them refreshment and emotional response. So just as she changes the source of her nourishment, a woman who marries changes from greeting the Ancestors of her father and brothers to greeting those of her husband. The tone in which sisters greet their own Ancestors is relaxed and familiar. That of young wives greeting their husband's Ancestors is reserved and respectful. But llluch of the talking, including that on behalf of a young wife like Rungkudi , is done by older women whose tone is fearless often to the point of being abusive. Such women may be either sisters of the lineage who have never left home or who have returned after being widowed or divorced, or else wives like Sindi who have borne children and gradually become closely identified with their husband's lineage. Interlocutors like Sindi speak only partly for the sake of others. Though much of the time she will speak on behalf of others with their sonums, for a long period we shall see her occupied with her own as the sonums of her husband and three children converse with her (sonums Nos. 10, II , 12 and 17). It never seemed to me that these women's role as interlocutor betrayed a position of weakness. It is not the more insecure or marginal women like the young wife Rungkudi who speak like this, but the women who are most firmly esta bbshed within their residential group. The selection of such women thus resembles that of the funeral shamans through whom the other side of the dialogue passes. Men as well as women say that women are better able to olong- the dead. This is a word which means 'greet', 'speak to' , 'interact with', as in the common inteljection olong-ing roi, 'hey, listen!', 'pay attention!' (literally 'olong- me a moment') . It seems they are saying that women are more articulate than men and that the practice of holding dialogues is largely a women's system. It may be that since women move between lineages and villages, their biographies and their vision of life involve a greater degree of adaptation and negotiation and therefore calls forth from them a greater degree of dialogic commentary. For some twenty minutes now Rondang has squatted alone on her



154 Dialogues with the dead
haunches and bea ten her drum steadily, summoning T umbago-Sonum and its collaborating Ancestors by singing in its characteristic signature tune. Now she sits for the trance, legs stretched out and eyes closed . Some women including Sindi leave off their other activities and move closer in anticipation . After a few mjnutes of sin gin g the tune which summons her rauda -familiar , Rondang's soul departs, her arms and legs are locked rigid and her fingers a nd toes are clenched tight. Wi th some effort, the bystanders unclench her , she sits at ease and the sonums are free to come. First the rauda , the sonum of her dead predecessor, a rrives and promises all assistance. Thereafter in succession over three hours with hardly a minute's break come nineteen dead people, followed by Herdswoman (Codu -boj) and Dumb-S un (Mo '1110 'yung) , both sub-Experiences of the Sun closely associated with Lumbago . Finally, to round off the trance the rauda comes again. The preliminary and closing speeches of the rauda, as well as those of Herdswoman and Dumb-Sun, are not included here as these would require copious extra commentary without furthering the present discussion . Instead, attention is focussed exclusively on the Ancestors themselves. Male sonums appear before female ones, as always, and to a greater genealogical depth . The order of their appearance is mapped on to the genealogy in figure 7.1. It can be seen that though not every Ancestor speaks, each twig or branch of the lineage is generally exhausted before the dialogue moves on to another - a pattern which echoes the ordering of names in the Ancestors' song of redemption in chapter 6. In translating, I have taken pains to preserve shifts in the tone of the original, since much of the significance of the text for later analysis will depend on just these distinctions between insult and tenderness, with all the mixed emotions which accompany familiarity. Conversation with the first nine sonums is largely banter about trivia, though in our analysis of moods in the next chapter we shall see that this is important in setting the scene for the very serious conversations which will follow from No . 10 onwards. For ease of reference, the sonums who speak are summarised in figure 7.2, along with their main living interlocutors. The sonums marked with an asterisk are particularly significant and their circumstances will be discussed at length in the following chapter:

Various voices, a baby crying in the distance, a pause: they run out of things to say. Eventually conversation of a desultory sort is resumed , of which some lines are given here:

Don't they do all the sacrifices, divinations, healings on her behalf? So are they going to turn their backs on her then?
Indupur departs after a few more remarks.
The next four sonums continued to engage Sindi in sarcastic backchat. First Pansia (6a) returned to complain that he was insulted the previous time and to demand a drink. Then came Poiro (7), Gumesara (8) and Ourugad (9). Durugad boasted about all the rites he used to perform when he was alive. Sindi pointed out drily that it had still failed to save him in the end.
10 Palda
With the arrival of Palda, the mood of the conversation changes dramatically. The abusive tone in which he speaks to his mother has an intensity and viciousness which are far removed from the casual, familiar



162 Dialogues Il'ith the dead
rudeness of her previous exchanges with the other son urns . I had first heard him speak three years previously, through the funeral shaman Rijanti, a few months after his death. I did not know him when he was alive and it is not easy to distinguish his personali ty then from the insolence now req uired by his ro le as an unrepentant incestuous suicide who is sti ll trying to perpetuate the form of his own death in others. The Sora theory of the ca usality of suicides invo lves chains of earlier and subsequent victims and these are shown for Pa lda's case in figure 7.3. Earlier, Pa ld a had committed incest with a girl of the most unequivocally disapproved type of maronsel cousin , a mother's sister's daughter. Believing that she would tell everybody, he hanged himself out of embarrassment (garoj). But though this forms the precipitating cause of his suicide, on another leve l the cause will include incitement and assistance from a previous suicide victim. In Palda's case these were furnished by Rumbana. Rumbana was a young man of the Headman lineage. He was the only child of today's shaman Rondang and her husband Tabaro. He hanged himself shortly after returning from a year's migrant labour in Assam. The cause of his suicide on one level was that he had spent savi ngs entrusted to him by other Soras in Assam for safe carriage home. But on the other level, while in Assam he had been present at a murder and had brought the Sun-death contagion home to Alinsing, a contagion which was not successfully neutralised by the blocking rite which the entire village underwent after his death. His first victim was a little boy who hanged himself because his parents proposed to send him away to a school. His second was Palda. In between he brought about a failed suicide attempt by his lineage-brother Sargia (Mengalu's son and, incidentally, the youth on

whose beha lf Mengalu is said to have used sorcery against Saga lo in chapter 2). Now Pa lda himself has begun to take over the role of chief inciter (muda , ringleader) to suicide. The dialogue will discuss in detail hi s recent attempt o'n the life of Rungkudi's son, his lineage-brother Sarsuno. Many elements in Palda's messa ge are unwelcome to his mother, who resists them accordingly . As well as his attempt to kill Sarsuno , she resists reports of the marriage in the Underworld between his crony, the earlier suicide Rumbana, and her own daughter Maianti. Maianti and Rumbana have now begotten a sonum baby in the Underworld, another piece of news which Sindi does not appear to welcome. The implications of this marriage will be analysed in the next chapter. For the moment it can be said that it highlights and maybe prolongs Palda's largely unredeemed state as a resident of Sun-Sonum . Furthermore, though by his redemption song he was of course led into one of his own lineage's Earth sites (into Bat's Nest), he repeatedly makes the point that to the extent that he resides in Earth at all he does so in the company of his new 'brother- in-law' Rumbana, in the Earth site of the latter's lineage in Jagatumba . Thus, despite their separate redemptions by their respective lineage Ancestors into separate Earth sites, even in their redeemed moments their mutual bond as fellow Sun-People keeps them together. Palda's entry is a masterpiece of needling. Where other sonums ask for an alcoholic drink, he demands pan, a blood-red mixture which is not used by Soras but is chewn and spat out by the people of the plains, including the low-caste Blacksmiths associated with the Sun.

Palda now turns his attention to Rungkudi, whose son Sarsuno he ha s recently brought close to suicide. Rungkudi lacks Sindi 's assurance and caustic wit at the best of times. Today everyone of her three children is either dead or under direct threat. She respo nds indignantly, with no backchat.

But you climbed up into the loft atdead of night: whose fault is that? 1 was sleeping outside on the veranda ... you'd been funny all day not wanting to go to work . . .
Palda now instructs them in the details of the rite by which he can be induced to leave Sarsuno alone. Here I think he is playing with the two levels of his own unresolved condition. The rite described is a banishing-rite (amdungp/r). This echoes the pre-emptive rite to block the spread of the contagion of a Sun-death, in which the animal is dragged out of the village on a rope to a random site, the blood is drunk raw and the rope cut into segments. But at the same time he combines this dismissal from the village of the bad, pent-up blood with the specific direction of his new residential Earth site Jagatumba (line I 74,.reinforced in line 180). Though she agrees to do this, Sindi still refuses to acknowledge his change of residence and amends this - consciously or unconsciously? - to Bat's Nest, the name of his own branch's site where she thinks he should be (181) .

The dynamics of Sindi's family life now begin to emerge more clearly. Having made himself thoroughly objectionable, Palda introduces his dead younger brother Oindo as the contrasting favourite son. Whatever their personalities may have been while alive, Oindo's role, like Palda's, is now set. He is portrayed as loyal and responsible and as the person who as a sonum saved Sarsuno from Palda's incitement to suicide. Attention is now focussed on the anticipation of Oindo's arrival and of Palda's hoped-for departure. In an attempt to hasten this, Sindi even acknowledges Palda's residence in Jagatumba Earth site (190) though with a bad grace and in a dismissive way which Palda will not allow to pass (191) .

And unplugged my arse in the process. Drained me and ruined me with the expenses [i .e. Police bribes, etc.).

The topic of Sarsuno has been worked through and, in contrast to Palda, Oindo has been confirmed as both authoritative and sympathetic towards Sindi.

By now it is clear that the sonums of Sindi's own immediate family a re among the central characters in today 's drama. A few more male sonums, however, from Saga lo 's lin e are still waitin g their turn to speak. Only brief extracts are given here:
13 Disamor
Jamano's stone- planting was held yesterday in Tongseng. The night before that, a very shrivelled o ld man had died and been cremated in Alinsin g. His first inques t therefore took place on the sa me morning as Jamano's stone-planting, described in chapters 5- 6. In this inquest it emerged, as a kind of grim joke, that the Ra 'tud-People responsible for Jamano's death had also killed this old man in order to present him to Jamano 'as their buffalo' along with the twenty-one other, real buffalos which he received . Disamor was one of those Ra'tud-People and here he jokes about how he and his Ra'tud companions took the old man.

/9 Panderi
At some point, in anticipation ofPanderi 's arrival, her husband Sagalo ha s left the food preparations and come over to join us. Yet, just like Rungkudi when brought voice to voice with little Amboni, Sagalo too is unable to speak for himself. He sits tearfui and wretched , while his aunt Sindi speaks on his behalf. The circumstances of Panderi's death were outlined at the beginning of this chapter. She has been dead for about four months and the iss ues at stake in thi s dialogue very clearly still revolve around the valjdity of their marriage . It is emphasised on both sides how firmly integrated as a daughter-in-law Panderi had already become in Sagalo's lineage (lines 271-4; 283 ff); she explici tly repudia tes the cross-cousin rela tionship with Sagalo which made their marriage questiona ble in the eyes of her brothers (285); and she emphasises that it was not she but their baby who was the real target of the attack (275- 6, 285). An interpretation of the meaning of these points will be offered in the following chapter.

However, Panderi's redemption remains problematic. Despite the stoneplanting performed by Sagalo, in which his Ancestors led her into their own Earth site (286), she has not been fully released into their care by her original death-Experience (293). Sindi, on behalf of the lineage into which she and Panderi have both married, encourages her to be resolute (294). But Panderi's pitiful and helpless tone throughout makes it clear that, despite her best intentions, this move is still beyond her ability .

Panderi was the last dead person to speak. After her, Herdsman-Sonum (GOdU-SIl17) spoke in a distinctive patois, supposedly of low-caste Telugu herdsmen. Then Dumb-Sun (Mo'mo 'yung) gave his inarticulate gruntings. Finally, Rondang's rauda-familiar herself appeared and sang and spoke for a few minutes . Rondang spat into her palms, rubbed her eyes, opened them and stretched herself. She had returned from her other home in the Underworld .

Memories and rememberers: states of mind among the dead and the living
Emotional tone and degrees of redemption
The text given in chapter 7 is a typical Sora dialogue with th e dead. It is clear that some of the sonums who come have great emotional power over those who gather to meet them; and that , in formal terms , this power is somehow linked to the degree to which each dead person's redemption has been made to stick or is being resisted by the dead themselves. The deceased person may be a more or less will ing party to this resistance. While Panderi would willingly embrace redemption but is hindered by other sonums who now make up the Ra'tud side of her nature, Palda by contrast revels in his unredeemed state, as befits both his perverse personality and the more dangerous nature of his Sun Experience. Clearly, too, the increasing stability of a sonum's redeemed state is related to the passage of time itself. The past few chapters have shown how a dead person is perpetuated among the living. This perpetuation is seen in terms of a gradual progression between two idioms, Experience-membershi p and Ancestorhood. Ini tially, the dea th-Experience fills the entire scope of his being and leaves room for nothing else. Almost immediately, the Ancestors redeem him and there begins a struggle to hold illm to this new state. He reverts spontaneously to cause illness; healing rites send him back. Perhaps through the very act itself of causing dea ths (this is not quite clear) or else simply by the passing of time, the impulse to revert weakens and eventually fades away altogether. He is now a pure Ancestor residing in an Earth site. In the turmoil of actual events there can be an intricate play between the idioms of Ancestor and Experience. Thus Panderi's death-Experience itself hinders her attempts to reach her husband's Earth site and become an Ancestor in his house, willie Palda's camaraderie with his fellow Sun
lVlemo l'ies (lnd I'emembel'el's 177
res ident Rumbana even perverts hi s choice of Ea rth -site resid ence . As we shall see, Ihi s makes him effectively a n 'A ncestor' to anot her lin eage a nd actua ll y disturbs the regul ar movement of names and property within and between lineages. This kind of play is made possible by the fl ex ibility of the correspondence between structural time a nd li ved time. A ll changes in the Sora life-cycle start from a moment. If the initi a l moment is not given by nature, as in birth or death, it is created as in the stone-p lanting a nd la ter stages of the funeral sequence. But this moment is not the point at which the transition occurs definitively, but that at which the possibility for its fulfilment begins. Each stage must reckon with reversions to the previous state . While these a re ever-decrea sing, they can not be disrega rded . The decisiveness of the created moments gives a clea r framework of structura l time across which the eddies and counter-currents of fee lin g flow , with a different kind of time-pa ttern of its own . So num s like Palda are problem atic precisely because their recalcitrance creates such a n extreme discrepancy between these two kinds of time. As a heuristic measure, the sonums we have met in the dialogue above may be distinguished broad ly into Old, Middle-Distance and Rece nt sonums. These categories are not a bsolute, nor are they directly labelled in Sora terminology. They reflect no more than predominant tendencies: just as the dead wander back a nd forth between states, so our categories and dead people's membership of them cannot be hard and fast. These categories correspond not so much to time alone, as to shifts in emotional a ttitudes which correspond somewhat loosely to the passage of time, so that these categories could also be called 'Undisturbing' , 'Neutral' and 'Distressing' sonums. Those in the first category have been dea d many years. They no longer attack in the form of their original death-Ex perience; though they are known to be in Earth sites, they visit us only in the form of pure Ancestors or in ways closely associated with this such as through Lumbago-Sonum (Dul'i-SII11 , as in this dialogue). They no longer have any close personal emotional involvement with the living. The second category, who in general have died some years ago, have lost much of their power to distress though not yet their personalities. These are inclined sometimes to attack through their originaldeath-Experience and sometimes to behave as Ancestors. Finally, Distressing sO;lums may ca~se grief a mong the living and attack frequently in the form of their original death-Experience. The first sonums to arrive in any trance are always unequivocally Old sonums (of whom the males survive for many more years than the females). In text 7.1. this category may be said to include sonums Nos . I to 9. In cosmological terms Old sonums are Ancestors in the fullest sense. They

have taken up residence definitively in a particular Earth site and are very unljkely to revert to their original dea th-Experience (indeed , these are often already forgo tten by th e living). They show a striking uniformity in the tone and content of their conversation and a re barely distingui shable in personality . The circumstances of their death s are no longer discussed and they converse on the same kind of non -topics which Sindi, for all her accomplishment in backchat, often appears to find fundamentally uninteresting. These so nums are treated facetiously , even rudely, and dismissed quickly . They turn up ostensibly to receive what is theirs by right and to oversee their own legacies (see e.g. Indupur's claim on Sandi, lines 141 If). They justify this relationship by the fact of having passed on their names, and through their role in promoting crop growth. As Ancestors, the Old sonums are fundamental to the structure of Sora society. Their appearance early in the trance sets the scene in several ways for what will follow . Like the rauda-familiars, they can point to the direction which the trance will take when the serious discussion begins (cf. lamano's father's speech, before lamano's own appearance, in chapter 5). Like the raudas, too, they also serve to establish the otherness of the world from which they have all come. lust before their arrival, the shaman has sung an invoca tion describing her journey to the Underworld . Her imagery has established this otherness in terms of spatial inaccessibility. Now the Old sonums play further with spatial paradox by reminding us that even on the surface of the earth, their space overlaps with ours and yet is different (previous chapter, lines 70 ff),just as in terms of time, within this very same space, the seasons in their world are out of step with ours (lines 5- 11,73-4). This portrayal of the difference between the worlds not only validates the journey between them but also contributes to the transcendent authority of the dialogue which this journey has made possible, an authority which will be so important when the more recent sonums follow. Middle-Distance and Recent (or, respectively, Neutral and Distressing) sonums provide the substance of the conversations for which the Old sonums have merely set the scene. These sonums are still at various stages between a frequent reversion to their original death-Experience and the state of irreversible residence in an Earth site which will make them into Old sonums. Though these stages are not absolute and a sonum's behaviour may vary with the occasion and the identity of the interlocutors present, we may distinguish Middle-Distance from Recent sonums in that the former no longer cause the living the same intense anguish. Thus we can say of Middle-Distance sonums that (as with Old sonums) the living mourners have no intense unfinished business with them. With the more
Memories and rell7elllberers 179
di stant among these sonums (Nos. 13- 15, 18), their personalities have beco me reduced through conventionalisation and they co me to be identified only by superficia: attributes which lead ultimately to caricature. Thus No. 15 (Sara'ka) acts out a di stinctive speech habit and in addition repeats (a s he does every time he appears) hi s ludicrous personal hi sto ry. These Middle-Distance sonums are already not much more than Old sonums with a little garnish of stylised local colour still clinging to them. Sonums Nos. 10-12 and 17, on the other hand , while still being Middle-Distance, lie much closer to the heart of their current inte rlocutor Sindi since they are her own husband and children. In themselves they do not seem to distress her now. But her insulting banter with her husband , for instance, is not distant as it often wa s with the earlier Old sonums but perhaps tinged with some affection and at least highly specific in tone and content. She is here facing the sonums of personalities who cannot be fully conventionalised away until she herself is dead and her conversations with them give a convincing picture of what those relationships were probably like when they were all alive. Three sonums can be placed unhesitatingly in the Recent, Distressing category: the suicide Palda, the scar-ravaged little girl Amboni, and the young wife Panderi. In terms of time, Panderi (No . 19) has been dead only three months and has not yet received the first of her three annual harvest-commemorations; Palda (No. 10) has been dead for around three years; while Amboni (No. 16) has died within the previous year. Emotionally, they come in direct response to the presence of a mourner whom they have the power to disturb . In such cases the bereaved person may sometimes try to greet the deceased and even to embrace the shaman through whom the sonum speaks; but often he or she will weep silently on the outskirts of the group and it is left to a more confident and collected interlocutor to speak with the sonum on the mourner's behalf. These three conversations stand out sharply in the intensity of their impact. The topics discussed are highly varied and specific, and they plumb emotional depths of a quite different order from the other sonums. Indeed I still find it difficult, several years later, to listen to their tapes with a dry eye. All are unsettled not only cosmologically but emotionally: Palda deliberately nasty, little Amboni pathetic, though her dangerousness is just an unavoidable part of her condition, and Panderi who though she does not speak in a threatening tone is still trapped against her will inside the form of her own death. I do not have enough information to examine Amboni'scase, but shall examine the background to Panderi's and Palda's appearances.

Conversations with two partially redeemed sonums
Pallde";'s message to Saga /o : lo ve agaillst all odds
On the ni ght that Pa nderi died, I wa s sleepi ng in Ra na tang's hou se in T on gseng, ha lf a mile across the va lley from where she lived in Alin sin g. During the ni ght there came the sound of drumming a nd lamentin g from A linsing a nd the sky was red with the fl a re o f a pyre . I wa s consciou s of th e others' tense wakefuln ess in the da rk for some tim e before someone broke the silence to ask , 'Are th ey si nging langga or langgi?' (i.e. ' beloved ' in the ma sculine or feminine form). However, before first light they knew from gossip not only who had died but were also saying that she had hanged he rself after a quarrel with Sagalo - and , moreover, that she had tried to do so once before but had been cut down in time. At first light we crossed over to Alinsing, where the pyre on Sa galo 's cremation site had not yet died down . A friend from Alinsing told me, 'She had been going around with only her external (bayira) soul , her real soul had been lost since she went to Pangrung yesterday . Yesterday a sonum grabbed her, Ra'tud .' Others added specifically tha t this was the Ra'tud -Sonum of Rungrungba village, on the way to Pangrung. But members of her natal lineage in Lower Village, who had always resented her marriage to Sagalo, were standing round the pyre muttering that it must have been suicide or murder to be so sudden. It turned out that they had already raided Sagalo's house and sna tched back Panderi's personal jewellery, grain and clothing (her keruru) with a promise to return it to her child if it should survive . This was a calculated spite since the baby was only a year old and such unweaned children usually perish since no other woman will wet-nurse them. Unlike Jamano 's case, there were here two preconceived verdicts in circulation before the first inquest. Neither of these verdicts involved sorcery but each did reflect one of two conflicting views of what the cause and even the perceptible symptoms might have been. These views directly reflected the opposed interests of Panderi's husband and brothers, both of whom were to perform a separate funeral and inquest. That involving Ra ' tud was based on the fact that the dead woman had returned from a long journey carrying her baby along a path which passed through many known Ra ' tud sites; characteristically of Ra ' tud she had then collapsed suddenly during the evening, in addition making horrible noises reminiscent of the dog Kambutung with which Ra'tud-Sonum hunts down its victims. Besides, it was argued , she had initially collapsed outside the house and called out for help, whereupon certain named witnesses had carried her inside, so how could it have been a concealed murder or suicide? The
Memories alld rel11emberers 181
second verdict, on the other hand , refl ected her bro thers' ho stilit y towards her ma rria ge. Their view was suppo rted in addition by her supposed previous suicide a ttempt a fter an earlier qua rrel wi th Saga lo . When the Ancestor-W omen of Saga lo 's lineage had cooled her ashes with wa ter, her brothers' group too k some o f these in a bone-carrying process ion to their own cremation site a nd buried them there, just as the remai nder had been buried on Sagalo 's cremation site. The inquests in her husband 's and her bro thers' houses were to be performed in that order on successive days by the same old woman , Rijanti , who thou gh now blind and barely able to walk acted as the ma in funeral shaman for both Alinsin g and Lower Villa ge. She had ma rried into the Headman linea ge of Alinsin g from another vill age bu t had stayed on after being widowed . She wa s not obviousl y involved with either of the opposed households for whom she was to perform. The following morning the first of these inquests took place in Sagalo 's house. Some representatives of Panderi's brothers came and sat stonyfaced on the verandah outside, from where they could hear through the open door everything that was said within. Raw rice grains were contributed by all the households in Sagalo's lineage, with the addition of his mother's brother Mengalu. This was in May 1979, during Mengalu's period of great closeness to Sagalo, whom he protected as his 'orphaned nephew' . Three months earlier, it will be recalled from the beginning of chapter 5, Mengalu had chosen to sing at a separate event with the Ancestor-Men of Sagalo's lineage rather than with his own at the naming ofRanatang's baby, even though that baby was ofMengalu 's own lineage. On the present occasion Mengalu had likewise lent his seniority to support Sagalo vehemently in his unsuccessful battle to prevent Panderi's brothers from confiscating her personal effects . But I could not help remembering the last time I had attended an inquest in this same house two years earlier (chapter 2). Then Mengalu had been revealed as the one who had murdered Sagalo's little brother by sorcery - a verdict which we saw in chapter 5 was to be echoed a few months after today's proceedings, a t the inquest on Jamano. The format and tone of the inquest on the morning after death are similar to those of the later stone-planting inquest, as presented in chapter 5. There are the same injunctions to the deceased not to conceal the truth and the same techniques for building from a shared perception of the symptoms towards a goal in terms of motive. Yet at the same time, the first inquest proceeds with a more elaborate display of tentativeness. The dead woman was fed with water rather than alcohol since rather than a true sonum she is

still partly a co nfu sed ghost (/wlman) hot from the pyre and consequently at even greater ri sk of ondrung (,false awareness'). In the first inquest, therefore, an additional preliminary test is done before the actual trance in order to give the company a lea d towards the likely ca use of death , a lthough the verdict of this need not be bindingon the dialogues which follow. The shaman places two gra in s of rice between two leaves from a bael tree and passes them through the fl ame of her la mp. This lamp is associated with the idea of clarity of perception in the quest for truth in the shadowy Underworld. A verse is sun g nam ing one so num a t a time which may be either a specific dead person or an Experience and the leaves are opened and examined to see whether the two grains have stuck to the same lea f (indicating a negative proba bility) or to separate lea ves (positive) . On the present occasion, after working systematically through the names of various dead perso ns, the shaman moved on to specific Ra ' tud sites . After this procedure had been followed with a grim determination for about an hour, she came at the thirty-second test to the Ra'tud -Sonum of Rungrungba village. On separating the leaves it was found that the two grains had disappeared completely, which I was told indicated a very high probability indeed that this sonum was responsible. At this point the tests with leaves ceased and Panderi's brothers' people entered the house and took part in the remainder of the proceedings. Once the trance began, there came at first a succession of eight dead people who stayed only long enough to name themselves and enjoy a drink of wine. These included some Ra'tud -People who were from Rungrungba village but were not related in any way to Panderi or her husband. Then came the suicide Palda , who confusingly lent support to the alternative verdict by claiming to have induced Panderi to follow his own example and hang herself. He was followed , however, by the slavering hunting dog of Ra'tud , whose behaviour Panderi was supposed to have imitated in her death-throes. In the body of the frail old shaman I found this a chilling performance. Then came the Ra'tud-Man from Rungrungba who claimed responsibility as the ringleader in the attack . This was none other than Sunia, who as Sagalo's distant cross-cousin had been commemorated two years earlier in the same double stone-planting ceremony as had Sagalo's little brother Mando. Mengalu, despite his own role in Mando's death , asked him indignantly why he had done this terrible thing when they ('we', used without a trace of irony despite Mengalu's position at that earlier time) had treated him well by giving him an honorary stone-planting, even though this was not strictly required by his cross-cousin status.

Though they had been snatched by her brothers, the day mi ght come when they would be demanded back if the baby survived. At one point she was accused by her brothers' people of concealing the fact tha t she had bee n driven to suicide, and there were threa ts of calling another shaman to force her to corrobora te thi s view. But Panderi herself supplied the unmi stakable imagery of Ra ' tud , for exa mple, 'They prick me with a goad like a buffalo' (cf. cha pter 5, lines 102, 104). She confirmed that the ringleader in the attack had been Sunia and as a parting shot advised her younger sister, who was present, to marry Sagalo in her stead. The following day, Rijanti sat for the duplicate first inquest in Panderi 's brothers' hou se. I was unable to attend, and so cannot give a detailed account. Anything said in the earlier inquest could have been contested and it was not inevitable that she would either confirm her cause of dea th or repeat the advice to her sister. In thi s light I am inclined to interpret the appearance in the first inquest of the suicide Palda as being just enough to keep suicide a live issue. In the event, even though she was surrounded the second time by interlocutors from the other side of the dispute, the original verdict ofRa'tud was upheld and all her messages were repea ted. This was confirmed aga in at her first stone-planting given by Sagalo a month later and in the su bsequent stone-planting given by her brothers. All talk of suicide seems then to have ceased . The rationale for this verdict is so mewhat different from that for Jamano's case, where the role of the attacker was fragmented into three: the unmotivated person who shared Jam ano's Experience; the wife who did not share hi s Experience but was at least partially motivated; and the highly motiva ted sorcerer who was not yet dead and so was associated with a particula r Experience only to the extent that he had made a pact. In the present case there is no such fragmentation: the ultimate impetus for the



184 Dialogues Illith the dead
attack lies with someone who is him self a member of the Experi ence through which the attack is routed. Why did Sunia use his Experience, Ra'tud -Sonum, to attack Sagalo's baby and in the process kill Panderi? The So ra interpre tation goes beyond a simple conjunction of his own Expe ri ence and motive. It uses two analogies or displacements which I was able to discern in Sora discussions at the time. One of these concerns the attacker: Sunia was acting on behalf ofPanderi's own brothe rs. The other co ncerns the victim: it was the little baby boy who was the inte nded victim and Panderijust go t in the way while protect ing her baby . In the process, she was killed and the baby survived . Let us take the first di splacement first, in which the attacker Sunia is see n as standing for the victim's own brothers. Sunia resides in the Ra'tud site of his own villa ge Rungrungba . Each villa ge has its own Ra'tud residenti a l site, which ca uses the dea ths of a large number of people from tha t vill age (such as 1amano in Alinsing) as well as of a few stray travellers from other villages, like Panderi today. In recent memory, the Ra'tud site of Rungrungba has absorbed five other Alinsing people. In every case, some sort of personal connection was found to justify the attack. However, none of these victims from her own village was said to be implicated in Panderi's death. Instead, attention was focussed entirely on the connection between her husband Sagalo and his cross-cousin Sunia. What endowed Sunia with the potential to cause a death in Sagalo's household was the fact that Sagalo had given him a stone·planting. The ambiguity of this action can be understood if we refer back to the ways in which a man can participate in another man 's funeral. In chapter 4 it was shown tha t lineage members and affines (in-laws) are clearly distinguished by their behaviour; and that the basic way of participating in the funeral of a cross-cousin is to treat him as an affine by 'dancing a buffalo', in other words, to act as an outsider to his lineage. Yet if properly kept up a cross-cousin relationship can be very close, especially if cousins live near each other and frequently exchange labour and hospitality. My mother's brother's or father's sister's people were indeed in -laws to my parents; but their descendants, my cross-cousins, are discouraged as marriage partners for the next three generations and are often addressed as 'brother' and 'sister'. A cross-cousin's death therefore faces me with a choice: it is only if! am less close that I treat him as an in-law and so 'dance a buffalo' to his lineage's stone-planting; if closer, I may ' take his bones' and give him a duplicate stone-planting on my site, as Sagalo has done for Sunia. Even if! give my cross-cousin a second stone-planting he will not , like a married woman , be enumerated later among my Ancestors. Nor normally
Mel1lories alld rel1lel1lberers 185
will his name be given to one of my desce nd a nts. A male cross-cousin will simpl y res ide in one of hi s own lineage's Eart h-Sonum sites and give hi s name to one of their descendants . But though optional second sto neplantings are genera ll y given to cross-cousins for the sake of affection , here too there may be a strategic intention. To stage the primary stone-p lantin g ra ther than mere ly to participa te in one staged by someone else, is of course to assert one's right to be the heir of the deceased and to retrieve hi s name for one's own children . To take so me of his bones home in order to plant a second sto ne is the next best thin g: it brings within the range of quasi-consanguinity someo ne who would otherwise remain outside it as a n affine. If my cousin 's closest brothe rs la ter die out, I may ma ke a bid to be his heir aga inst hi s more distant co llatera ls. In this case I must first induce him in dialogues to change hi s res idence to one of my own Earth -So num sites, as the first stage in the transferral of what we may call more ma terial rights. Thus, though a decea sed ma le is not at first listed among the Ancestors of two lineages, by revealing in dialogues that he has changed the site of his Earth residence, he can effectively change his lineage : the rights first to his name and eventually to hi s property are thereby gradually transferred. The case discussed in the next section will include precisely such a move, as a more recent link between affines overrides an older collateral one within the lineage - largely on the grounds that it is more persuasive in terms of personal affection. The Sora interpretation of the present case takes advantage of Sagalo's relationship to Sunia in order to sa y something about Sagalo's marriage to Panderi. Sagalo's cross-cousin relationship to Sunia is analogous to the relationship between Sagalo and Panderi's brothers (figure 8.1). It was the latter relationship , as much as Sagalo's poverty , which her brothers cited to justify their hostility to the ma rriage . A cross-cousin relationship is supposed to last for three generations following the marriage which brings it into being and to lapse (masuna -) in the fourth . Tn the present case, Sagalo belon gs to the last generation in his line to whom this relationship will apply. Panderi's brothers do not wish to see this relationship ignored. The case thus emerges as one of a cross-cousin relationship which refuses to fade away before its time despite the anxiety of Sagalo and Panderi to discontinue it prematurely. As Panderi herself was to put it later, quoting what she had said at the moment of her own death, ' ... Ah husband Ah spouse, ... now that we've stopped being sisters, now that we've given up being cousins .. .' (chapter 7, line 285). What I have called the second displacement develops this through the substitution of the victim: it was not Panderi whom Sunia intended to



186 Dialogues with the dead
destroy , but her baby . Panderi insists repeatedly that the baby wa s the targe t and tha t she sacrificed her life to save him. Similarly, while her pyre was still bl azing, I hea rd that her brothers had already plundered her personal belongin gs from the wretched Sagalo 's house in the scarcely veiled expec tation that the baby would not be nursed by a nother woman and would not survive to claim them back. The bi rth of this baby, and of a boy at that , for Sagalo 's lineage represents the vindication of Panderi's marriage to him. So long as that ba by remains alive, he will continue to vindicate it. Sa galo has been quick to understand this and has already taken the very unusual step of taking him to a Christian missionary orphanage in order to make sure that he will be kept alive on baby food. This is two days ' journey away on the coast, far out of Sora territory, but he visits his baby frequently and thinks about him constantly . We have also heard Panderi encourage her younger sister to marry Sagalo . If there is to be polygyny, the first wife's normal companion as her co-wife is her younger sister (aliboj) and so this marriage would assert the continuing validity of Sagalo's first marriage to Panderi herself. It would also repeat Panderi's defiance of her brothers; provide another

mother for her son in later yea rs; and make it possible for Panderi to take her own name away from her brothers' linea ge and give it to a future daughter of Saga lo by her sister. (When I return ed in 1984, all these thin gs had ind eed come a bout. Saga lo had ma rried Panderi 's sister and retrieved hi s son , now five years old, from the orphana ge. He and the sister also now had a ba by daughter - called , as I expected , Panderi.) What emotiona l state, so soon after he r death , do the words which appear to come from Pa nderi aim to induce in th e two riva l living pa rties? Both are suffering from the loss of a woma n to whom they were strongly attached. But wrule her husband is bein g comforted, her brothers are being rebuked fo r thei r possessiveness. It is as if Panderi were saying to them , ' You thought tha t by wishing the ba by dead you could get your sister back. But you were defeated by my devotion to the marriage. By your wish , you have now lost me utterly - and you will lose your other sister to the same man.' For Sagalo, by contrast, the message points towards a certain continuing companionship. Sagalo's growing confidence about the survival of his son, or his satisfaction at Panderi's replacement by her sister, will be reflected in the growing permanence of Panderi's redemption as she ceases to wander as a Recent, Distressing sonum and remains mo re and more an Ancestor residing definitively in Sagalo's particular Earth site. Four months after her death, this positive future is still not yet assured . Panderi still finds it difficult to escape from her Ra'tud Experience (lines 286- 94) . But she is a determined woman and the passion with which she juxtaposes her protectiveness towards the baby with her love for Sagalo (e.g. line 285) suggests to me that her act of self-sacrifice for their baby's sake is intended to be taken by the bereaved Sagalo as the supreme expression of that love.
A complex a"d lI1/1velcome message for Si"di from her lIasty SOli Palda
While Panderi's redemption remains unstable against her will, Palda's case is quite the opposite: he revels in his Experience rather than seeking to escape from it and he abandons his 'correct' (rojtad) Earth site for a perverse one. This is despite the fact that he has been dead for three years to Panderi's four months. If his mother Sindi resists a message which he continues to push, we must ask who would welcome it. The number of interested parties is large and the occasions over the years when their views could be expressed are numerous. But so far as I was able to understand it, Palda and his mother are caught up in a bigger game, in which their affairs are merely a sideshow. This ramifies out from the ambiguous inheritance of Rumbana , the earlier suicide who induced Palda to take his own life. Figure

8. 2 shows the main peopl e involved. Rumbana' s central role can be clea rl y see n. As he often tells us, Palda has aba ndoned Bat's Nest (one of hi s own lineage's Earth sites) and gone to res id e with hi s fri end Rumbana in Jagatumba Earth site. This choice of res id ence build s on a previou s connection , the fact that as a previous suicide it wa s Rumbana who induced Palda to kill him self. The connection ha s now been further reinforced in several ways. All the dead members of Paid a 's hou sehold have moved to Rumbana 's Earth site; while in the Underworld Rumbana has even married Palda's dea d sister Maianti and through her begotten a sonUl11 baby. Clearly , then , Palda 's irregular movements follow in the wake of Rumbana' s. After his redemption , Rumbana had ori ginally gone to Hollow Water Earth-site, as was appropriate. But as the genealogy shows in figure 8.2, the site in which Rumbana now resides, Jagatumba , is not one cultivated by his own Ancestors, but one belonging to his grandmother's brothers. Thus, through their crops, Rumbana's soul is now feeding households not in his father 's lineage but in the natal lineage of his grandmother, an in-marrying woman. To do this is to imply that the latter may claim to be his heirs. Why did Rumbana move? Let us examine the circumstances surrounding his death. It seems that Rumbana was widely loved in the village a nd that everybody had been deeply shocked by his death. For a long time his girl-friend could not bring herself to leave his parents' home or to find another man; his father Tabaro has given him four of the annual karjas instead of the usual three and still walks around 'like an empty shell (ku/taben, an empty grain basket made of stitched leaves and floppier than one made of basket-weave); his soul has already died (a puradan andrellg keid/e)' . Rumbana died unmarried and with him an entire branch of the Headman lineage died back (tad-) as far as Old Tabaro (generation - 3). Of the present Tabaro's three brothers and half-brothers ( - I), two died childless while the third when he dies will leave only a daughter, Gadi . All their considerable land was therefore due to come to Rumbana who indeed was already farming it with his aged parents. Where a man has sons , they will always be the ones to perform his stone-planting, so that inheritance presents no problems in principle. Where for some reason the stone-planter is in no position to inherit, uncertainties arise. The stone of the suicide Rumbana was planted by his father Tabaro but his inheritance will pass to other collateral relatives whose role in the stone-planting was only secondary. The ultimate



190 Dialogues lVith the dead
resolution of rival claims between these parties must wait upon Tabaro's own funeral; but meanwhile the claims and their justifications are being advanced and enhanced in numerous dialogues like the present one. There are three claims on Rumbana's estate. Two of these are from collateral branches within his lineage and one is from hi s cross-cousins, the descendants of Indiri's brothers. His fellow lineage-members participated in his stone-planting by each ' hitting a buffalo' . But though he is a linea ge Ancestor to all, they did not incorporate him as a full household Ancestor whom , for instance, they would expect to accompany them in the event of segmentation. Meanwhile his cross-cousins (who also live in the same village) 'danced a buffalo' from their part of the village to the stoneplanting site of his lineage. Each of these claims will be considered in turn. The reader will need to refer frequently to figure 8.2, where it will be seen that there are three bearers of the name Rumbana . As well as the young man whose suicide is at the centre of the present discussion, there is old Rumbana, the long dead man who gave him his name; and baby Rumbana , the current living holder of the name. It should also not be forgotten that although the living and dead characters involved converse on many occasions and through many shamans, the dialogue analysed here has passed through the mouth of Rondang who is the suicide Rumbana's mother.
I. Rumbana's closest relations are Tabaro's half-brother lani, his daughter Gadi who lives with him and through her his grandson, baby Rumbana . Gadi is a daughter who has stayed at home. Her lover, the impoverished Rutujen, is Sindi's son and the brother of Rumbana's fellow-suicide Palda . Their baby sons (of whom baby Rumbana is the only one still alive) were born in lani's house and received the names of lani's, not Rutujen's, Ancestors (cf. the naming of Ranatang's sister's baby at the beginning of chapter 5). The surviving baby is the closest heir genealogically and his claim has at one point been endorsed by the dead Rumbana when he passed on his name. On the other hand, the baby's claim is weakened by the fact that it passes through a woman and that he is a mere baby in a branch which apart from her contains only two old, tired men to fight his case.
2. The descendants of Andaraj and Mu'tuku: if lani's claim on behalf of his daughter and baby grandson were to fail, these more distant lineage members (led by Mengalu) would be the obvious heirs. Indeed, given the weakness of the link through Gadi, some of them may regard this as a foregone conclusion. Nonetheless, these claims have been fortified by the placing of some of their own Ancestors in Hollow Water Earth site. Old

Rumbana (generation -2) was the first person in the village to work land at Hollow Water, so that the rights to those plots belong only to those deemed to be hi.s heirs. Thus it was appropriate that he should reside there after death (for the story, see chapter 6). But since then , one Ancestor in eac h of these other two branches, (respeclively T itino and Bumbuden) has also come to resid e in Hollow Water (I do not know Titino's story; Bumbuden's story was also given in chapter 6). The web of claims is tightened by yet other connections. For exa mpl e, when Indomoro died childless, he also moved into Hollow Water, hi s widow married Mengalu and their next child was named Indomoro after him. The way is thus already open in principle for the claims of men in these two branches to the land at Hollow Water , claims which wh en the time comes will probably be supported by the intervention of their own Ancestors who already reside there .
3. Rumbana's cross-cousins, the descendants of Indiri's brothers: Rumbana's ostensible reason for moving to lagatumba Earth was that he wished to be with his grandmother Indiri. As a married woman with sons, Indiri's residence in her brothers' Earth site is itself irregular. As figure 8.2 shows, she is the destination of this entire migration among the dead. She was a woman from a fairly poor line which had numerous descendants, married into a line rich in land but short of descendants. So far as I can reconstruct it from this distance in time, the story appears to be as follows:
Indiri was Old Rumbana's second wife and the mother of his two younger sons. She died some time after all four of his sons had ma tured and the course of their lives appeared to be set. According to custom, her husband organised her first, main stone-planting while her brothers took her bones to their own site for her second funeral. But at some point after her death, she announced that she had gone to reside, not in one of her husband's Earth sites, but in one of her brothers', at lagatumba. This must have been soon after her death, since such moves seem to be made only then. I do not know what her sonum is supposed to have said at the time. But in making her move, she probably capitalised on the following points:
- firstly , she had no female descendants in her husband's line to whom she could transmit her name (Gadi was already too old to be named); - and secondly, it was already clear that the future of her husband's line was in jeopardy since his four sons between them had produced only one surviving boy (who was later to kill himself: the problematic Rumbana) .



192 Dialogues lI'ilh Ihe dead
We cannot now know whether additional factors were involved , for example a lack of intimacy such as was diagnosed between Jamano and his wife.
When her son Pandia subsequently died without an heir, his full brother Tabaro arranged his stone-planting, to which Indiri's lineage 'danced a buffalo ' as his cross-cousins. Because of the stone-plantin g, Pandia's property reverted partly to his half-brother Jani but mostly to his full brother Tabaro and through the latter was due to pass exclusively to Rumbana. Nevertheless, Indiri somehow recruited Pandia to join her in Jagatumba and the seeds were sown of a possible future situation: if Tabaro and Rumbana failed to produce further heirs (as in fact has happened), a strong case could be made out to those of his land-holdings which had originally been Pandia 's property.
Meanwhile the dead Indiri has been consolidating her position in Jagatumba . She offered her name to her own brother's great-granddaughter. I was present at this name-promising ceremony (abjien) in 1977. When I returned in 1979 the baby had died before the final name-giving (abFi/l11On) and I heard Indiri in dialogues insistently demanding another child to name and being told, much to her annoyance, that no woman in that lineage was pregnant. When Rumbana committed suicide in the summer of 1975 and went into the Sun, it was of course his paternal Ancestors, not his grandmother's, who went up there brandishing their weapons and brought him back. From there he accordingly entered Hollow Water Earth site where he remained for a while. Nevertheless, he too subsequently went to reside in Jagatumba. At the time of the present text, in September 1979, his move to this new residence remains his main message.
It is this message which is reinforced by his friend Palda in the dialogue and is associated with some bizarre-seeming goings-on in the domestic affairs of the Underworld. These goings-on are an underground parallel to a struggle between people above ground. They effectively provide the main forum for the working through of the latter. What we see in Sindi's encounter with her own sonums, for all that it touches her deeply, is little more than a sideshow. Gadi is the lover of Sindi's son Rutujen and the mother of his baby son. The messages coming from the various sonums through Rondang's mouth seem to pull the disputed land away from Gadi and Rutujen in favour ofIndiri's natal lineage. This is a further meaning of the prolongation of Palda's state of suicide and a reason why Palda's message is greeted so sourly by his and Rutujen's mother, Sindi .

In such a complex web of motive and feelin g, implica ting so ma ny people and spa nning generations, one could never be sure of all the stra nd s of one's interpretation , nor could one seriously 'verify' them with the people concerned. But the overall process seems to me to be similar to Panderi's case: here too analogies are created betwee n the situation s of different people. In the prese nt case the process of makin g analogies works in two stages: the first parallels the love-a ffair above ground between Gadi and Rutujen with a marriage in the Underworld between Rumbana and Maianti; the second goes on to parallel th e babies born of each of these unIons. The love of Gadi and Rutujen presents a serious obstacle to the claim of Indiri 's lineage. In most respects, the latter's hold on Rumbana's branch seems already secure, as this has been developed through shifts in Earth -site residence. Pandia and Rumbana have left their nonnative sites and moved to Jagatumba . Tabaro adores his dead son so much that it is almost beyond doubt that he too will go after his death to be with him in Jagatumba (as probably will Tabaro's wife, today's shaman Rondang, who was born into a distant lineage which is now extinct and so has nowhere else to go). However, there is a leak in Indiri's otherwise watertight case. By producing sons who are arguably the proper heirs, Gadi is making Rumbana's branch 're-sprout' (tambob-) and is threatening to take his entire inheritance with her. Serious attempts have already been made to legitimate these children as descendants within the lineage. The Kartia who died childless in generation -2 gave his name to one child who has since died; while his brother Old Rumbana took the rather uncommon step of giving his name to Gadi's other child even though he had one namesake already living, the Rumbana who was later to kill himself. (His intention, I understand, was to transmit his fields at Hollow Water, opened up with his first wife, exclusively to his descendants by that wife to the exclusion of his children by Indiri . This is a common distinction made between sets of half-siblings , here unhappily overtaken by his subsequent lack of descendants through Indiri.) Gadi is determined to set up house with Rutujen, and is thus likely to bear him more children, increasing the strength of their competition. If she moves to his house as his wife, the children become 'his' heirs and her chance of taking any substantial wealth with her would be very slim against her more obviously legitimate lineage-brothers led by Mengalu . Though her personal inclination is to do this, she is aware of these implications. On the other hand, Rutujen could move into her house as a 'kept husband' (lo-Iab). This is a common arrangement by which wealthy houses without



194 Dialogues Ivith the dead
male heirs welcome suito rs with poor prospects at home. H owever, Rutujen is still hes it a nt to do thi s sin ce it is demea ning a nd would leave him vulnera ble to sarca stic rema rks from the men of hi s wife's linea ge who would have been passed ove r as coll a tera ls. Ga di 's reluctance to press hi m to do thi s is promp ted by a des ire not to hu mili a te him, so th at they continue to live apa rt in an unresol ved an d un sa ti sfyin g domestic limbo . We ca n summari se the line-up for and aga inst Rutujen's ma rria ge to Gadi as follows: On Gadi 's sid e, her fath er Jani supports it , though to protect her cla im to Rumbana 's property he insists th a t Rutujen should move in with Gadi a nd not vice versa. Rutujen's ta rdiness in doing so is reinforced by the awkwa rdness of Jani 's presence, however beni gn, in the same house: the presence of parents- in -law evokes a range of embarrassments and avoid ances . Though most married women have no choice but to endure this, men generally avoid living with it. It is expected that Rutujen will be able to move in more easily after Jani 's death . Old Rumbana , by virtue of their baby's name, should be committed to lending his support from the Underworld to this move (though on another occasion, as part of another manoeuvre, he gave his name to yet another Rumbana, a son of Mengalu who is now dead .) Similarly, on Rutujen's side, his mother Sindi is pleased that his children may grow up in a wealthy house and prosper there . The other branches of Rutujen's lineage (and no doubt their Ancestors) are probably happy with this since, if his children should gain control of the land and subsequently die out, they could themselves be in a position to make a claim of the cross-cousin sort. The marriage is opposed by Mengalu and his lineage-brothers and by Indiri's lineage. It is the latter who are involved in the present discussion. The only way they can try to safeguard their hold on the inheritance is to ensure that even if it goes to Gadi and Rutujen , it will still come to themselves if there is a subsequent dying back among Gadi 's descendants. To do this, they must cut Rutujen's branch off from its collaterals (see figure 7.1) who would otherwise oppose them. This is best done by somehow infiltrating Rutujen's immediate family. It is Palda's suicide which has provided the opportunity to do this. This death had causes on two levels: his embarrassment over his incest, and incitement by Rumbana as a previous suicide. Rumbana was the village's Sun-death ringleader at the time and so the most likely inciter who could be diagnosed. But he can also now play the role of agent-provocateur: the fact that his new recruit is Rutujen's brother allows an edifice of interpretation to be built upon this recruit's death which reaches right into the heart of Rutujen's affairs.

F irstl y, as we have seen, their perverse ca maraderie ba sed on a sha red residence in Sun-Sonum ha s been ex tend ed even into their redeemed sta te in an Ea rth-Sonum , so that Pald a has a bandoned his own a nces tra l site and become the first member of his lineage to join the mi gration to R umba na's site Jagatumba . Subsequently , thi s fellowship is converted into a brotherin-law rela tionship . Palda 's younge r sister M aianti is al read y dead , a n unwed tee na ge girl alone in the Underworld. She then ma rri es Rumbana a nd becomes the second member of her family to reside with him in Jagatumba. Her dead brother Oindo and father Borjanu follow her. Borjanu's move cuts off the entire family from the rest of their lineage. Thi s marria ge is an analogy of that between Gadi and Rutujen a bove ground , but it is more than just this: it competes with it. The culmination of this analogy is the birth in the Underworld of a sonum-ba by who rival s Gadi's and Rutujen's own living son. The family in the Underworld not only rivals the one a bove ground , it actually disputes its claims and argues in the opposite direction . The message which comes from all Sindi's sonums who confirm Maianti 's marriage and baby, is that the suicide Rumbana himself does not wish his property to pass through his lineage-sister to Rutujen and their children . Rather, he will take Rutujen's dead sister and use her to create heirs for himself. The only child he has so far begotten in the Underworld is a girl , which I would perhaps interpret as meaning that this move is still tentative; but as with Gadi and Rutujen, more children are expected to follow . The fact that these sonum-babies cannot inherit land in the world of the living does not detract from the force of this message. The total patterning of such moves amounts to a system of law which is based on declared intention and is thus comparable to the making of wills. Of the possible living heirs, Gadi's children by Rutujen are being explicitly excluded. By his own residence and his recruitment of all of Rutujen's close dead relatives, Rumbana is firmly supporting the case of Indiri's brothers' lineage. However unwelcome , this message is no surprise to Sindi since it is currently being echoed or contradicted elsewhere in the village , in other dialogues staged by various households using the same or different shamans. The formidable opposition ranged against her can also be seen in terms of a poor family 's struggle as they try to marry into a wealthy one .
A metaphysical crux: translating sonums as private 'Memories' in a public arena

amb iguiti es in their relations with other people. I can not assert that this must always be the case for everyone who dies: many are inherited in a n unproblematic way, enter the most appropriate Eart h-Sonum site and stay there. Yet our three ambiguous cases are not likely to be merely because of the youth of the people concerned, or because one of them is a married woman . Owing to the potentially fissile nature of the lineage, even men like Jamano who die as elderly adults with substantial descent lines can be involved in such st ruct ural wrangles. However , what is so striking about Sora life is the way in which these ambiguities about property and structure are linked to emotional ambivalences and in which the two are so intimately interwoven that they can be discussed and resolved only together. In the present three instances, Palda's nastiness is linked to a complex series of strategies of inheritance; Amboni accuses her desolate mother of having transmitted to her a hereditary contagion from her own natal lineage (line 258) from which the girl's father's lineage have power to redeem her; while Panderi declares her love for Sagalo by belittling their cross-cousin relationship and trying to enter her father-in-law's Earth site rather than remaining in the Ra'tud site which has come to stand for her own brothers (line 286). In one and the same idiom there is a blend of intensely private feeling and of a negotia ted collective acknowledgement of how certain things stand in the disposition of the material and social world. How can sonums be at one and the same time so intimate and so public? Can we coordinate our account of a system of psychotherapy with an account of law and of the structural processes of the lineage system within which it operates? We can see this public aspect most clearly from a glance at the legal functions of dialogue. Perhaps its simplest such function is to produce a tally of the assets of the deceased . In chapter 5 Jamano listed in anecdotal detail all the debts which people owed him and which Ranatang would now inherit. Similarly, Panderi listed the jewellery which her brothers had snatched. This is common at funerals . Knowledge which otherwise would die with the person is returned to the public realm - public in the sense both that there are witnesses and that any disagreement should be aired there and then. More complicated are the matters which arise from the vulnenlbility of the descent line to demographic extinction. Genealogies contain many adult men without descendants, so that situations of Rumbana's type are not uncommon . At the same time, houses or lines with thriving descendants also want land on which to set their labour to work. The result is a speCUlative and opportunistic style of interpretation . The fact of Palda's
Melllories alld rClllembcrers 197
death , or the fact that Sagalo once gave SUllia a stone-planting, provides an openin g for the manipulation of further situa tions as they arise . Thi s is like a game of chess in which you are a lways working out possibilities several moves ahead , bLit in which your spec ulation s may be rendered null and void not simply by someone else's move but a lso by the sexua lity, the anger or the sudden death of any of the chesspieces. This opportunism is similar to that in political and lega l games played among literate populations in India (and elsewhere) with documentary weapons. It also resembles those grea t psychological art-forms, the frame-up or the confession under duress, in that it seizes upon a small and indi sp utable detail and builds from it an entire case which mayor may not be true , but which is prillwfacie plausible and persuasive. One remembers' Mengalu's difficulty in denying accusa tions of murder by so rcery: after Jamano 's death , I sometimes wondered whether Mengalu any longer knew himself whether he had killed him or not. As in any other legalistic forum, the discussion moves over time from discord to consensus. But people can at first behave with a bad grace when they do not hear from the sonums exactly what they want to hear: Sindi reacts sourly every time she hears about her daughter's marriage in the Underworld, and both Ranatang and Panderi's brothers threatened to call another shaman when an inquest was not going their way. Thus we can say that competing and incompatible private perceptions are exercised in the public arena until they arrive at a point of compromise such that the dead person's residence of the moment is agreed, and eventually to the point at which further moves no longer occur at all . So far the discussion has followed the lead of the Sora themselves and considered the state of mind mainly of the sonums as they move around space and send us corresponding messages. But clearly this is intimately related to the state of mind of their living interlocutors. Can we now be more specific about the relationship between moods of the dead and moods of the living? From the moment of a death and perhaps even during the terminal illness, the mourner's reaction to the event is moulded through the conventional attributes of the Experience into which the dying person is being assimilated . It is not possible for survivors to contemplate the death of someone who was close to them without being influenced by the terms which themselves provide the framework for that contemplation. The extreme distress which dead people sometimes arouse in those who contemplate them is linked to their being seen as still wholly or largely trapped in their original death-Experience. As Panderi put it (chapter 7,




198 Dialogues Il'ill1 Ih e dead
lines 287- 93), th ough Ances tors strive to redeem her, the Ra'tud -People will no t yet release her to go with them. W hile the Old sonums receive routine disrespect, Recent sonum s may be gree ted with the utmost tend erness. Yet along with thi s, Sindi 's speech to Amboni conce ntra tes ex plicitly on the fea r that she may perpe tu a te her Experience, just as the conversation with Palda , thou gh hardly tend er, fo cusses on his rol e in p recipita tin g Sa rsuno 's recent attempted suicide. T he empathy which their shared state o f mind ma kes the survivors feel with the patient, goes ha nd in ha nd with fear for themselves: often those whom one loved the most while they were alive, o ne fears the most once they are dead . Yet though it causes us pain to recall the Experiences from which our loved ones died, their personalities are not obliterated by this Experience but reta ined as they deliver their messages ea ch in his own styl e. Sindi 's son urns Borj anu , Maianti and the sterling Oindo all corroborate Palda's unwelcome message about his move, his marri age and his baby; but in the tone of their respective exchanges with Sindi they remain noticeably different from each other. This distinctiveness is accentuated by the way in which the sonums dwell repetitively on the details of their stories, such as Panderi 's route home and how she drank her wine, or Sara'ka's encounter with a blacksmith-sorcerer (sonurn No . 15). Indeed the consta nt rehearsal of a story can become the main part of a dead person's presence. The moments at which significant new information can emerge about the circumstances of the dead are usually at the various stages of the funeral sequence, passing through the funeral shaman. In between these landmarks, the dead reiterate their current position and use it to play repea tedly on our feelings in their present form before they a re ready to progress to their next one. Consider the devastating effect on Rungkudi of Amboni's son urn. Though I could not stay in the field long enough to check thi s, on the analogy with other cases I have followed I would expect Amboni some years later to be saying that Rungkudi was a good mother and that no grudges remained . Because of the veri similitude achieved through the cruelty of these early conversations, this later modification will be equally convincing. It will be matched by little Amboni's growing disinclination to perpetua te her sca rs and a greater tendency to make herself known only as an Ancestor and resident of an acceptable Earth site. Sonums respond to us, then, according to the way we feel about them . To Sindi at the moment, her son Palda is a bumptious oaf. But to the living descendants of Indiri's brothers, he is a strategica lly convenient and welcome new 'Ancestor' . Panderi is loving to her husband , reproachful to her brothers. Sonums' moods vary with the person they are speaking to and they are diagnosed as appearing in the form in which one thinks of them.

I shall discuss each of these perspectives a t length , in the present and the following sections respectively. The causal connection, firstly , between my own past and my own present mental sta tes suggests that we are dealing with an aspect of memory. The sonum's new state can take over only gradually because the memory persists of what things were like before the tra nsition. Reversions then appea r as throwbacks or recrudescences of these old memories so that it requires frequent confirmation of our newer feelings to repress them . A rite of acknowledgement reaffirms the redemption in the funeral : 'Don ' t go and stay with Leopard-Sonum', says Kantino to his father (i dong dakune KlI1aslIJ1 amang) .



200 Dialogues with the dead
Who is it, the sonum or the mourner , who still remembers their own previous state of mind? In his work on Dinka religion, Divinity and Experience , Lienhardt has written (1961: 149) about the
difficult question of differences between Dinka and European self-knowledge which I can discu ss only inadequately. The Dinka have no conception which at all closely corresponds to our popular modern conception of the 'mind ', as mediating and, as it were, storing up the experiences of the self. There is for them no such interior entity to appear, on reflection, to stand between the experiencing selfat any given moment and what is or has been an ex terior influence upon the self. So it seems that what we should call in some cases the 'memories' of experiences, and regard therefore as in some way intrinsic and interior to the remembering person and modified in their effect upon him by that interiority, appear to the Dinka as exteriorly acting upon him, as were the sources frol11 which they derived.
Where Lienhardt uses the word 'memory' only in passing, it seems to me that this is perhaps the closest single-word gloss available in English for 'sonum' . This term should be understood in the sense of ' a recollection' (as in the French un souvenir), not in that of the mental function 'memory' (la l1u!l11oire). I shall write 'a Memory' with a capital 'M' in order to keep the possibility of using the word in other, more ordinary senses. It is normal both in Sora and English to say that one 'remembers' (aY-II11-, compounded from an unknown element plus -1111, 'feel') one's dead. It is this very normality which forces our epistemological problem into the open. Though the idea of remembering other, dead people is commonplace in both English and Sora its significance in the two is very different. For us, both popularly and as a technical term in psychology, this kind of memory, like others, is held to be located in the mind of a rememberer and to have no autonomous existence outside. Consider, for example, the following:
Undoubtedly I was made aware of my friendship by the grief that Jean's death was causing me, and little by little I became terribly afraid that since the friendship would have no external object on which to expand itself it might consume me by its fervour and cause my death. Its fire (the rims of my eyel ids were already burning) would, I thought, turn against me, who contain and detain Jean's image and allow it to merge with myself within me. (Genet , Funeral Riles, tl'. B. Frechtman, 1969: 28)
The narrator is being eaten alive by his Memory of a dead person. But with the lack of any 'external object' this sonum, here called an 'image', is explicitly 'contained and detained' within the narrator's own person. Even ifit 'turns against' him, it will do so from within. A similar view, written out by Freud as a technical analysis, will be discussed in detail in the final chapter. For those of us to whom this kind of idiom rings true, calling a sonum a
AIelllories alld rel1lel11berers 20 I
Memory while it roams at large outside the mind of any rememberer engende rs a piquant sense of contradiction, even of oxymoron, since it is clear th at this is no mere literary conceit as for instance in the title of Nabokov's autobiography Speak, Memory (1967). To the extent that we accept this gloss for sonum , we are obliged also to accept that when a So ra goes to a shaman to have a trance performed, she does indeed confront him with the speech of hi s Memories . Notwithstanding his awareness of a theatrical element (see chapter 10), then , there is no meaning to be had in denying his sense of the reality of this encounter. Thus 'the Memory ofPanderi ' refers to her sonum as it converses with her living rememberers, such as Sagalo and Sindi - or her brothers, as she snubs them and expresses her yearning for Sagalo who embraces her through the shaman and feeds her with wine. Tllis is of course not the same as to talk about these people's 'memories' (with a small 'm') (Sora: an-aYlll1-en) of her. This transla tion can be read back through this book to yield propositions like 'Palda is a nasty Memory to his mother'; 'Kantino's father resides in Leopard-Memory'; 'All illnesses and deaths are caused by Memories'; and 'The rauda leads the Memories one by one to speak with their rememberers. ' It is through this play between their interior and exterior properties that Memories are able to be both deeply intimate and publicly negotiable. A sonum is my Memory of a person whom I loved (or not, as the case may be); it is also someone who can turn in conversation to address anyone of a dozen assembled rememberers in a manner specific to each of them and at the same time common to all; in addition, it is someone who resides in a feature of the public landscape. Because Western memories of the dead remain within the mind of the rememberer and have a small om', they are seen as 'subjective' phenomena and therefore have a degree of plurality and social irresponsibility which is quite opposed to Sora thinking. There, on the contrary, a Memory constitutes part of what corresponds for them to our 'objective reality'. Subjective and objective (for which Sora has no words) do not form a dichotomy separated by a gulf, but rather lie along a continuum or perhaps overlap, so that several degrees can be distinguished. There are those phenomena such as dreams which are perceptible only to their experiencer (though even here, the dreams of shamans have a public dimension); and those such as omens which are perceptible to others too but of concern primarily to their main experiencer. The former category perhaps corresponds most fully to our 'subjective', the latter already rather less so even though they are still applicable only to certain people. Encounters with Memories lie near our 'o bjective' pole. By the very act of perceiving a

Memory you are forced to act out in public your mutual relationship and to coordinate this with other people's similar relationships. When you talk with your Memory, this relationship is a complementary one to which you both come, simultaneously, each from your own perspective. But as your relationship moves on in time, you do not simply playa complementary role but become a successor to your Memory. If it is an Ancestor-Memory, you become his descendant; if an Experience, you relive in your own right, from the same perspective, the first person's original experience of death (figure 8.4, above). There is an analogy between this and the succession of inheritance and naming through Ancestor-Memories. Like inheritance, this transference too is made possible by the encounter of two persons within the flow of time. The two perceptions take place not simultaneously, as with complementary roles, but in succession. The event which is perceived the second time is a repetition of the previous event, but the fil'St sufferer's subjective perception has been transferred to you. Your present state is now the outcome not of your own, but of your attacker's past.
Verb forms: how the dead transfer their own states of mind to the living
Voices ;11 the Sora verb
One's property and name, just like one's mode of death, are inherited through the medium of inheriting a state of mind. All these transfers are mediated through dialogues with Memories. The transfer itself takes place by a principle of repetition or succession in which a new person comes to replace a previous one. Yet within the structure of time revealed by this transferral, there is a further shift: as the victim of an Experience is redeemed into Ancestorhood, what he comes to transfer to his descendants is modified from a form of death to other, more desira ble parts of his social person. The first kind of succession, that of illness and death, is discussed in a distinctive language of violent encounter. Panderi's first remark on her arrival in chapter 7 was 'I got eaten up I got drunk up (literally 'It ate me up it drank me up, ajumingle againgle)' (line 269, repeated at 273);' and later 'they ate me up fresh-and-alive (ronglapada jumlingji)' (285) and '[the Ra'tud-People] won't release me won't let me go! (a'nomdaing iienji len a 'nomdrengingji len)' (293). Similarly, Jamano said 'they're prodding me ... they're roasting me (sujlingji ... mollingji)' (chapter 5, line 104). In all these expressions, the experiencer is a passive victim on whom other, active persons are perpetrating their violence. Even when being redeemed, the person remains passive: for example, in chapter 7, line 287,
Memories and remell1berers 203
Panderi says '[Ancesto rs] redeem me (Iandilillgji)" just as in chapter 6 the Ancestors had sung about Jama no ' Let us lead him toward s us let us bring him by the arm towards us (aorungnaiba alonglongnaiba)' (line 53 and elsewhere). How does 0ne make the transition from the pa ssive to the active mode of ex periencin g, from being eaten to eating, from being redeemed to becoming oneself one of the redeemers? One kind of answer can be sought within the grammar itself of these verbs. Here what grammarians would call passivity and activity are represented in a distinctive and powerful way . By calling it powerful , I am not proposing the kind of extreme Whorfian view (Whorf 1956) which would suggest that the thinking of Sora theology and psychology is entirely dependent on the grammar of the verbs through which it is expressed. Indeed, as the quotation from Lienhardt showed, in some fundamental respect Sora thinking resembles that of the Dinka of the Sudan, who presumably have a very different language structure. Likewise, the mutual permeation of Austroasiatic (i.e. Sora) with Dravidian and Aryan linguistic influences is extensive and the Sora use their language to think thoughts which are sometimes quite 'Hindu'. Rather, the argument of this section aims to demonstrate that Sora practice exploits opportunities in the grammar they have in the service of objectifying their Memories and making them public. By analysing this use, I hope that we shall be better able to grasp the dynamics of the transference of different aspects of
personhood . There is a strong sense in which all Sora verbs look forward to a predicate for their fulfilment. The impulse of a verb is either taken up in a construction of motion or destination which I would call intransitive but still active; or else turned back on itself (intransitive because reflexive or middle); or if transitive, it comes to rest or embed itself in an object. Sora grammar is not so alien here from Indo-European. Three voices can be distinguished which I shall gloss as 'active', 'middle' and 'passive'.2 Of these, active verbs are mostly transitive (except for verbs of motion), middle verbs intransitive or reflexive, while passive verbs are formed from the active with a suffix derived from the personal pronoun which represents the object. In what follows, I shall show how the active and passive voices are associated with the Experience Memories and their modes of death, while . the middle voice is used to express the central act of the redeemed Ancestors, that of giving their name to a descendant.

The action of Memories in their Experience aspect can be expressed only in ordinary language such as this; yet by contrast their action has the extraordinary property that the impetus of the verb passes right through the object and out the other side undiminished, continuing indefinitely into the future in quest of further objects. Each object, after experiencing the action of this verb, becomes its new subject (see figure 8.7). In the case of the chain of suicides in chapter 7 (figure 7.3), the effect of this is as shown in figure 8.8. This special kind of transitivity, of which the linguistic sense is

only a weak version , is the essence of the Sora view of the continuity across time of the forms of events represented by the Experience-Memories. Since this sense of transitivity generalises experience by spreading it around many experiencers, it raises problems for our grammatical categories of 'subject' and 'object' . For the Indo-European languages at least, and widely elsewhere, it is conventional to speak of the 'subject' and 'object' of a transitive verb. When the verb is shifted from the 'active' to the 'passive' voice, the object becomes the subject: thus 'the Memory eats the person' becomes 'the person is eaten by the Memory'. However, the terms 'subject' and 'object' are misleading and the situation is better represented by the terms 'agent' and 'patient'. In this, the agent is the person who initiates or performs the action, the patient the one on whom it is performed. The advantage for our present purposes of this formulation over one in terms of subject and object, is that the patient remains the patient of the action regardless of whether he is the 'object' of an active verb or the 'subject' of a passive one. A simple transitive sentence thus contains the elements shown in figure 8.9.

To explain the transmission of an id entical Experience from victim to attacker , T shall show how the perception of the transitive verb is transformed within the patient's own consciousness so that he becomes the new agent of that same verb and seeks to transfer his former passivity on to a new patient. The lin guistic expression of this process is given a di stinctive twist by the absence of a genuinely passive form despite the need for a passive meaning: there is no construction equiva lent to 'I am being eaten by so-and-so'. As we sha ll see, this gives a certa in property to the sense of victimhood: morphologically, the patient can never be the grammatica l subject of a passive verb but only the object of an act ive one. This means that someone else - an agent - must be the subject. What makes this active verb equiva lent to a passive is that the patient is emphasised largely at the expense of the agent who is played down or omitted .) Words in this morphological class come in three semantic types:
1. verbs with no agent, but a possible patient, such as words of weather, e.g. logel-I -e, 'it nights', i.e. 'night falls ', ganur- I-e, 'it rains'. These a re formed from an active third person singular which may be called 'impersonal' , since it is impossible to specify any agent by asking who or what is raining or becoming night. Such verbs can either stand alone without a patient (since the events they denote take place regardless of any perceivers), or else they can take as a patient the person who perceives them: logel-I-ing, 'It benights me, 1 am overtaken by night' , ganur-I-ing, 'it rains me, 1 get rained on'. In the latter case they amount to type 2 below. 2. verbs with no agent where a patient is essentia l, such as words of personal sensation, e.g. asu-I-ing, 'I am ill, it hurts me .' These are similarly formed and it is similarly impossible to specify any agent. However, they cannot stand without a patient since the event denoted is dependent on the perceiver in a way which is significantly different from the type above. 3. active verbs with a patient where an agent may also be specified: as in 2, these actions are discussed through the perspective of the patient. But in addition, an agent is implicit, e.g.jum-I-ing , '(someone) eats me', i.e . 'I am eaten' (cf. figure 8.6 above). This type is extremely common in Sora, with a singular or plural agent. In some forms, especially in the singular, a third-person agent marker may be entirely absent4 but the patient is always c1ear:jum-l-ing, '(it) eats me' (where the agent marker -e is elided);jum-I-ing-ji (where the -ji signifies a plural agent) , 't hey eat me' (cf. Jamano's mol-I-ing-ji, 'they roast me') .

Though this is the neares t So ra gets to a passive, it remain s active in a significa nt morphological sense. What we have here is a transiti ve ver b in which the age nt is present but is left unclea r or unspecifi ed in favour of a hi ghly specific ·patient. This patient is the perso n who reports the even t. A more accurate trans la tion ofjum-l-ing would therefore be '(a gent un specified , suppressed or implied) ea ts me'. So instead of our initia l formul a for the simple transitive sentence given in fi gure 8.9 above, we now have the formul a shown in figure 8.10.

It is this avoidance of specifying the agent which allows technically active verbs to give a passive sense. The function of divination is to unma sk this latent agent. At first, the sick person says jum-I-ing or jum-l-ing-ji, '(agent or agents unspecified) are eating me', which is the only possible Sora equivalent to 'I am being eaten.' It is in the very act of confirming this when it saysjum-I-ai, 'I am eating' (or i1am-l-ai, 'I am seizing' and many other aggressive verbs), that the attacking Memory identifies itself. Only now does the patient have the knowledge to say, for instance, ' Ra'tud-Memory is ea ting me.'

The roles of agent and patient implied in active transitive verbs lend themselves to the aggressive vocabulary of encounters between livin g persons a nd the dangerous Memories which we have called Experiences. But the Ancestor-Memories show that there is another way of linking predecessors and successors, one in which a Memory creates an analogy without aggression. I shall discuss the expression of this through the verb abi1l1nlenai, 'I name (someone) after myself.' This is what 1 have called a ' middle' verb. Verbs in this class cover a range of what may be called middle and reflexive uses, meaning to do something for oneself, to oneself, etc. The form of such verbs is shown in figure 8.11 (using so-, 'hide', since 'I eat myself is not normal Sora usage) .

Their essential feature for the present discussion is tha t such verbs do not seek an external patient in the straightforward active sense because they contain part if not a ll of their own predicate within.' Examples are:
ACTIVE MIDDLE
lIIaj-lai I mix (substances) lIIaj-l ellai I mix (in with a crowd) dakll-Iai I put, keep dakll-I ellai I stay (i.e. keep myself) I1-lai I peel (fruit) II-lelia; I become (something else, i.e. change my skin) aMilln-lai I name (i.e. give a name to)abiilll1-lellai I give my own name to
Middle verbs of this sort have a double patient. 6 The first of these is fully internal or reflexive, i.e. 'myself'. It can be seen here how the Sora middle construction gives a similar kind of identification which in many IndoEuropean languages is provided by a 'complement' in the same 'case' as the 'subject'. The second patient is more external. It may be represented by an adverbial phrase of position in space (s/ 'mg Imgen dakutenai, 'I stay in the house', Uyung-slll1en amang majlenai, (said by, e.g. a suicide) 'I merge within Sun-Memory'. Alternatively, this external patient may be a noun which is always brought into some kind of identification with the agent: 'I mix myself (with something hither~o separate)" ' I become (something from which I was previously different)" e.g. kman Tltenai, 'I become a leopard' (this could be said by a were-leopard , said to be rare among the Sora though common among the Khond). It is thus not so external after all. Such verbs create an analogy between the agent and something outside himself, in such a way that they become somehow less separate from each other. In the context of relations between the living and their Memories, the key verb here is abi'illnlenai, 'I cause to bear my name.' The root al1l1n ' name' plus the causative particle ab- or -b- give the active form abfillnlai (a-b -l1l1n-l-ai), 'I name (i.e. cause to bear a name)' , used for example with the patient /emsoden, 'a dog'.

a child to bear my own name.'7 Here the interest of the agent in the patient amo unts to an exp licit identification. Yet there is no passivity on the part of the receiver. In the sentence 'I name a child after myself ' the child , though an 'object' in conventional grammar, is not a patient in our sense of suffering or undergoing an experience . Rather, he has been identified with the agent in a way which makes him like the grammarian 's 'complement'. The pe.:pe(tiatlon ofa name forms a close a na logy to that of membership of an Experience Memory. Compare figure 8. 12 below with figure 8.7 above. In figure 8.12 there is transmission, or transitivity, without passivity.

Our grammatical review of the way in which a dead person perpetuates himself among the living may be summarised as follows: there are two modes of transmission of properties from dead to living persons. Both operate by creating an analogy between the first person and the second and both have an impetus which in principle continues ad infinitum . But in the two cases there is a difference in the kind of analogy and in the way that it operates:
I. The categories of the Experiences are rooted in human frailty and their classification is based on a phenomenology of suffering. Analogy here serves as a principle of causality. It is seen as a negative principle because of the unhappy events and conditions which it causes, yet an unavoidable one. It is counter-social and its choice ofpaths is summed up by the verbgorod-, 'wander' or 'leap'. This transmission of suffering through activity, as its grammar implies, is aggressive and involves a transitivity of events. 2. The category Ancestor is rooted in social continuity. It esta blishes itself as a transformation of the Experiences by means ofa redemption in the funeral and a transition through Earth-Memory. This restores something of the social element which was destroyed by each person's death-Experience. Analogy here serves as a principle of succession, a principle which is seen as positive because it maintains and perpetuates

the kin -group . Its path is disciplined, as a judici ously select ive movement along the a va ilable routes of kinship . This form of tra nsm ission is equiva lent gra mmatica lly no t to transitivity but to a middle with a co mplement , sin ce the repetition is one not of action but o f bein g: it is a transference not of events but o f some degree of identity.
T he gra mmatica l difference between these two forms of tra nsmission is that with transitive verbs, the Memory is caught up in the swing of the active/ passive pendulum . One ca nnot normally transmit one's name until one has settled permanently into a redeemed state, which involves freeing oneself altogether from active transitive verbs, with their aggressive vocabulary , and remaining instea d entirely within the scope of verbs having a middle form . (This does not of course mean that fully redeemed Ancestors do not 'ea t' sacrifices, 'see' their descendants, etc., only that this kind of active verb is no longer the vehicle for their self-perpetua tion) . We are now able to locate the precise point at which a dead person is able to switch from being passive victim to active attacker, as well as to describe the very process of this switching. As one might expect from the elaborate cosmological background , this point turns out not only to be one of mood and time but also to have its locus in space. The residential sites on the landscape are the very points at which the dead change their moods and switch back and forth between desirable and undesirable ways of
perpetuating themselves. Figure 8.13 gives the most important verbs prevailing at various stages in the relationship between Memories and their living rememberers. These cover the moments of attack, of recovery or else of death and absorption, and of redemption and eventual renaming. I have laid the verbs out so that we can follow this process across time, while holding constant the point of view of one and the same consciousness as it passes through the various stages of being a Memory. These verbs are arranged into five columns, from active on the left to 'passive' on the right. The vocabulary in most classes is larger than the selection given here, though this includes the
commonest words.s

4 'passive' impersonal, end in g -ing. These can have no active form a nd the agen t ca nnot be specified, therefore they can not reappear in column 1. 5 'passive', ending -ing or ing-ji (-ing is a suffi x referring to the patient; the agent is unm arked in the singul ar and marked in the plural by ~ji). These have the possibility of specifyin g the agent a nd thus of personalisation; these verbs can thereby be activised and then correspond exactly to those in column I.
Chronologically, the person moves from top to bottom of the diagram; in term s of the evolution of hi s con sciousness or sta te of mind , from right to left. These sequences show a clear progression from the fully pa ss ive, in the sense that the agent can be specified (co lumn 5), to the ' imperson a l' (column 4) which is ' passive' in form but with no possibility of specifying the agent, to the middle (column 3). At this point the Memory rests, being neither patient nor agent. These are verbs of being, of state. It seems no accident, therefore, that it is at this stage that he is conceptualised as residing in a site on the land scape. The Memory 's location here in a fixed point in space summarises both his own past and his potential to act on others over time and thereby to make their future resemble this past. His first move in this direction is through the root gorod-, 'wander, revert', an active verb (column 2) which, though like all verbs it seeks a predicate, does not need a patient because it is intransitive and so is satisfied with a construction of motion. But this is only a means to a state of full transitive activity (column I), in which he will necessarily seek a patient. This aggressivity is only the other side of the coin of the Memory's passivity, since he is inclined to attack only because he is still suffering from his original death-Ex perience. The passive verbs which will lead him out of this aggressive perpetuation are tandi- and urdi- , 'redeem' (chapter 6). When redemption is finally accepted and he remains an Ancestor, his only activity will then be to redeem others; while at the same time in the middle voice, he will progress beyond a mere state of shared existence with fellow Experience-members towards the positive gesture of renaming. We earlier replaced the concept of grammatical subject by an emphasis on agent and patient. Now, as we see a single person move from patient to agent, we may return to the term 'subject' and through it to the question of 'subjectivity' . Each person moving across the diagram is the speaker of all the verbs: he is, throughout, a constant perceiving subject. In the early stages, while he is a patient slipping from life to death, the living are concerned to know about his perceptions. Whether in a divination for

illness or in an inquest in which the 'pat ien t' ha s ju st died, it is for hi s sake that the agent is made exp licit. But by the time he him self becomes an agent, people's attent ion is already shiftin g to the perceptions of his new victim. The questioners want to know about the old patient's identity, thoughts and feelings largely to the extent that this will enab le them to act on behalf of the new patient whom he is attacking. The latter, in turn , is now the new perceiving subject. However, within this passive state the divination is also co ncerned with a shared state of consciousness. The patient is not a lone and it is the very possibility of specifying the agent which ensures that this is so. Let us return to the semantic range of the three kinds of verbs which can appear in the 'passive' form (see p.206). Our types I and 2 gave us a vocabulary of sensations and perceptions in which an agent can never be specified, e.g. g[[nul'ling, 'I am rained on'; {lSuling, 'I am ill '; m[[lIggaling, 'I am tired'; ken idling, 'I die'; ai1U1l1daling, ' I need to urinate'; etc. Rather than calling these ' impersonal', it may perhaps be better said that as verbs of sensation they put their emphasis on the patient (the perceiving subject: 'it's happening to me') rather than on the agent (the grammatical subject: 'it's happening') which does not need to be specified. On the other hand, the passive type 3, jumling, 'I am eaten'; Hamling, 'I am grabbed', keeps the same perceiver but has the potential to externalise the agent. I would characterise this distinction as one between a 'closed' and an 'open' passive. A closed passive focusses purely on the perceiver and his perception and ignores or downplays the question of agency. An open passive, by contrast, is prepared to specify its agent under interrogation as part of a quest for knowledge about causality. Thi s causality is uncovered through dialogue, a procedure which at once brings the patient's perception into the public realm . During a divination the vocabulary of the open passive sort allows the impersonal aspect of transitive verbs to be personalised: 'Who is grabbing me?'. The shared consciousness which is created in the dialogue places the patient and his supporters in a relationship of close identification as fellow victims, actual and potential. By drawing together to identify the attacking agent, the patient and his living supporters locate it outside the circle of their gathering. Whether in a healing or in a funeral (where the 'patient' is already dead but has not yet become an agent), they attempt to confirm this exteriority. But at the same time, this location of the source of his suffering outside the sufferer himself converts his priva te perception into a public one. Since many people have their own separate relations with the Memory in question, this process requires a compromise, certainly, but also yields a
J\1elllOries alld relll elllberers 215
co nfirmation of the reality of their experience and of its calise. It is the lise of la nd scape wh ich allows Memories to ex ist both as shared perceptions a nd - between the times when they are currently act ive in the life of any rememberer - independent ly. It is this, too, which allows the Memory to a lter the dynamics of his involvement with ot hers by making the change from passive to active while holding constant the idiom ofRa ' tud, Leopard or Sun . The land scape is not merely a repository for the storage of names of people, nor even of the knowledge of what happened to them. It also contains the potential for the repetition over time of the events which that knowledge is about . Thus the difference between points in space not only allows the Sora to conceptualise the differences between kinds of eve nts by ho ldin g them apart, but also se rves to perpetuate those differences indefinitely into the future. Much of modern Western metaphysics, from social science to quantum physics a nd catastrophe theory (Thom: 197 5), is preoccupied with explaining changes in the form of entities or events, on the assumption that this is a problem . Sora thinking seems concerned on the contrary to account for the problem of their constancy. This constancy is explained through chains of human carriers whose feelings move in and out of tune with each other and who are thereby constitutive ofeach other's biographies.

Forgetting the dead
The progressive dissolution of the person after death
Through this book 1 have argued that the So ra person should be understood , not so much as having an essence of personhood, but as being a changeable confluence of attributes and traces of events. His formation is gradual and it would be hard to specify the point at which the person matures to his most complete or individuated state. The decHne and disappearance of the person, which will be traced to their conclusion in this chapter, form an equally gradual and complex process. While the Experience categories like Leopard-Memory and Sun-Memory presum ably exist indefinitely, the persons who pass through them on their way to becoming Ancestor-Memories are very much creatures of time. So if sonums are Memories and their mourners rememberers, what is the nature of forgetting? The formal stages ofthe funeral process appear to take three years, but this is not the end of the person. Memories are sa id to 'fade' (masuna-). But just as their nature wa s initially formulated in the public arena , so they will fade in the same way. In tracing this process, we sha ll move from the more intimate atmosphere which was so important in establishing thedead person's nature as a Memory , towards the socia l, economic and legal processes whose outcomes persist lon g after all emotional involvement has ceased. The dead inhabit a world which is real but.wh ich is different from ours. The dialogues in chapters 5 and 7 give an elaborate picture of the continuation of normal social life after death . Further marriages and changes of residence occur among the dead for the same kind of reasons as they do among the living and are reported to the living and discussed with them . This discussion covers who among the dead is drinking with whom, who is Hving with or visiting whom, even the banalities of hoeing,
Fo rge llillg th e dead 2 17
harvest ing a nd baby-sittin g. At the sa me time this wo rld of the dea d is not sim ply a continu ation of the world of the living, but a topsy-turvy parody of it. T he seasons are reversed, as well as ni ght and day ; people also say that the dea d keep doves as ch ickens and pythons as cows, and that they hun t living humans as game an ima ls. It is because the two world s are no t only ana logous but also so much at cross-purposes that they impin ge on each other in a way that is a lwa ys problematic for the living. The trees 1 need to fell to clear the gro und at my hoeing season are at the same tim e my Ancestor's bea npoles during hi s ripening seaso n (chapter 7, lines 70 ff); the dead drink the soul of our alcohol and leave it tasteless (chapter 7, lines 136~7) ; they have their own agriculture, yet are perpetually hun gry and demanding; a nd above all , they feed on us and 'take' us to join them. Yet if we in turn impin ge too intimately on their world , we a re unable to ret urn: a sick man who accepts the food of the dead is bound to die (chapter 5, line 77); by working or drinking in the vicinity of an Earth site or wa shing in its water we lay ourselves open to absorption by that Earth (cf. Old Rumbana in chapter 6, see p.138). As the previous chapter has shown, the very process of remembering is itself slanted to our disadvantage from the beginning, since by their own activity the dead always place us in the passive. Yet the living are not obliged to suffer all this as victims without hope. The internal structure of the concept Memory itself offers us the way out. Our task in facing the Experience aspect of our dead is to deflect the impetus of this aggressive form of their self-perpetua tion into their benign self-perpetuation as Ancestors , to persuade them to convert their active verbs of eating into the middle verb of renaming. This aggressive impetus does not encompass the whole of the dead perso n, but is more a temporary mode of his being. A dead person is composed of several elements, attributes or qualities (1 am not sure which to call them) , so th a t in his passa ge across time he describes a multiple trajectory, like a burst of stars from a firework . After his death , various of these attributes are remem bered with a different intensity and forgotten at different rates. Thi s corresponds to a variation in the way in which their impetus, which can never be simply annihilated, is transmitted to new persons . I can identify at least six such elements:
(i) his membership of the Experience which originally caused hi s death: this amounts to an initial , immediate assessment of his biography, coloured by the suffering of his dea tho To the extent that this is nega tive, it is transformed during the stone-planting by redeeming the deceased



2 18 Dialog ues Ivith the dead
and turning him into an Ancestor. The transformation is not completely successful at first. The dea d person co ntinues to revert and to tran smit hi s original co ndition to others. His rede mption is reinforced each time he is bani shed in a hea ling rite. Over time, these reversions become fewer and less virulent, but by the time he is full y redeemed he is likely to have caused the death of further persons. The impetus of the Experience is transmitted to other person s as shown in fi gures 8.7 and 8.8.
(ii) his state of bein g an Ancestor: this is a positive analogy to hi s dea th-Experi ence. A n Ancestor has a privileged a nd fairly beni gn relationship with his direct descendants. The impetus of his Ancestor role is spread ove r an ever-widening circle of descendants who share thi s Ancestor in common . It thus governs (iii)- (v) below.
The tension between Experience and Ancestor, which is so prominent in the early days following a dea th, expresses the power of dea th to sunder its victim from the society of the living. Yet the goal of redemption has already been declared at the stone-planting and from the point of view of the deceased, the rites of acknowledgement addressed to him when he causes an illness amount to a reassertion and reinforcement of tllis redemption . !his redemption reintegrates him into a wider lineal society which Incorporates the living and the dead into one continuous flow. By the time he has become an Old Memory many years later, a dead person 's de.ath-Experience is of Ijttle interest or is even unknown. But long before thIS, as chapters 7 and 8 showed, there is a further concern with another opposition, that between Earth sites which are viewed as mutually exclusive alternatives. Even where redemption is taken for granted, this can remain an area of keen dispute . The disputed or ambiguous Earth affiliations in those chapters also involved the inheritance of material property and the renaming of descendants, which were seen to be closely intertwined . Within the state of Ancestorhood, further attributes of the deceased also include the folJowing, which will be discussed late r in tills chapter.
(iii) his residence in an Earth-Memory: here the deceased is united with a sub-group of fellow-kinsmen in the ground from which they feed their descendants: which Earth-Memory a person chooses to reside in is problematic for all married women and sometimes for men . The impetus of Earth-Memory membership can still a lso be expressed in the Experience idiom, if the dead person causes death with symptoms of swelling and blockage; otherwise, this is another positive analogy to his death-Experience which comes to approximate closely to Ancestorhood as the impetus is shifted to the transmission of property and name. In
Forge lling the dead 2 19
either case, the impetu s is weakened over time as the Memory becomes diffu sed over a n ever-widening ra nge of descendants.
(iv) hi s material property: this is similarly transmitted and diluted in an eve r-w idening circle with each generat ion . Its relevance is overtaken each time by the death of its new owner, when it forms part of a newly con stituted body of inheritabl e material and effectively ofa new person. The material dispersed in this way includes the land which was associated with hi s res idence in an Earth site.
(v) hi s name; this emerges as the outcome of the previous two attributes, though the problems with Rumbana's inheritance in chapter 8 show how it can a lso be ma nipulated in an attempt to force that outcome. The emergence of the name suggests that the transmi ssion of the previous two a ttributes has been acco mpLished. But in addition, since its impetus is supposedly transmitted to one single person, it denies the dispersion implicit in the inheritance of Earth sites and property. In some sense, then, it re-concentrates something of the scattered personhood of the deceased.
Is this a ll there is to a person after he dies? As we trace the destination of each of these aspects, we shall still be left with an irreducible residue:
(vi) his presumed subjective consciousness: this is the aspect of the deceased which eventually dies a second death in the Underworld and turns into a butterfly (discussed at the end of this chapter).
The completion of inheritance and the waning of Earth-Memory sites The complex dual nature of Earth-Memory was first explored in chapter 6. There I presented it as a cosmological intermediary which brings together the cross-cutting categories of Experience and Ancestor. Although it can act as an Experience to cause death, it does so through an imagery of retention and wholeness, the same imagery which also allows it to become a rallying point for redeemed kinsmen who have otherwise been dispersed by their various death-Experiences. It is thus an essential staging post on the way to the state of Ancestorhood. Earth sites are focusses of agricultural activity, partly domesticated clearings in jungle space. It is this mutual superimposition of the two kinds of space (chapter 4) which may be sa id to de-Experientialise the concept of Earth and to Ancestorise it. In the short run Earth-Memory functions as a full Experience: in this sense it focusses its unwelcome attention particularly on childbearing sisters who through the normal workings of exogamy



220 Dialogues Ivith the dead
have give n themselves elsewhere. In the lon g run , however, this imagery co ncerns itse lf more with the placing of males in the progressive evo lution of the lineage. Eart h used in this way becomes an idiom for the perpetuation ofa man's property. In this sense, it can only draw away from any reference to the symptoms and ci rcumstances of the deceased while alive or around the time of his death. Earth-Memory thus becomes a concept which is cut loose from the moorings of the dead person's actual experience an d thus ultimately not an 'Experience' at all. However, the lineal unity which Earth-Memory helps to create will not la st forever. From an even longer perspective, an Ea rth site will be overtaken by the natural breaking up both of the lineage and of the sites associated with it. Co nsid er first of all the historica l pattern of Sora land use. The stockpiling of Ancestors in sites would seem to suggest that those sites are precious, as indeed they are under today's conditions of acute land shortage and declining fertility. But at the same time, the stories of migrations and expansions which I collected for several lineages all talk of moving steadily uphill under press ure from Oriya and Telugu settlers in the plains. The latter stories seem to imply a frontier into which one expands wherever possible. Land once claimed has not always been abandoned afterwards, especially where it can be converted into paddy fields, but the role of Ancestors is strongest where that land is recently claimed. I For example in the middle of the valley-floor at Alinsing, which has been completely cultivated as permanent paddy-fields for six or more generations, is the Earth site in a spring called Barang. Though it is said to have belonged once to a lineage who are considered the original inhabitants of Alinsing, today it contains no dead people and attacks no living people. The field in which the spring actually rises now belongs to Mengalu and Raduno, but they disclaim any connection with the Earth-Memory in the spring. It has simply 'faded ' (masulIa-) or become irrelevant as the frontier of cultivation was pushed uphill towards the edge of the valley where (as a glance at figure 4.3 will show) the active Earth sites are now concentrated. Though it can be used as a ' Police Station' (lana) by members of any Earth site at the edge of the valley in order to 'arrest' (i1am-) bathers, they act in the name of their own sites and nothing can happen in the name of Barang itself. In the terminology of chapter 4, it was once a residence but is now just an outpost. While the named site remains, 'now there's no Memory there' (nami sonumen agasa) . We may say that like an old volcano, the site exists but is extinct. There are as many Earth sites dotted across the landscape as there are springs and water holes, and many more than I have been able to show on figure 4.3. Any of these may become a residence after death for any man
'P

who works a paddy-field which is watered from that site or a sh iftin gcu ltivation slope in the vicinity , so that they can serve as title-deeds for his descendants to substan tiate disputed claims to such plots. Every man who works land near the site has residing in each of those sites one or more direct male Ancestors, as well as wives and sisters . The names of all of these (though married sisters may be disputed by others) shou ld emerge only among his own descendants or among those of a lineage-brother whose share, and structura l position, is equ ival ent to his own. The particular exemplars or Earth sites are opposed to each other. Or rather, it would be better to say at first simply that they are distinguished from each other since it is the events in peoples' lives which pitch Earth sites against each other as rivals. A range of Eart h sites can be spoken of as synonymo us when referring broadly to a linea ge or branch, but they will also be distingui shed at closer quarters by the particular members who are placed in each site. They are often referred to in speec h in doublets (chapter 4) and like any pair of terms in a doublet they will be seen in some contexts as synonyms, in others as alternatives between which a choice is to be made (cf. chapter 4, footnote 4). The ways in which these sites are grouped together or opposed to each other ma tch the na ture of current ba ttles and alliances. For a married woman the issue is generally between alternative Earth sites, that of her brothers versus that of her husband , as in Panderi's case. For most men, at least if they are not caught up like Palda in complicated cases across lineages, it is between sites which are at first grouped closely together as pertaining to the same branch of a lineage but which gradually become more separate as these branches grow apart. For example, figure 7.1 showed how the two branches ofSagalo's lineage are already associated with separate clusters of Earth sites. But when Sindi, representing one branch , speaks to Panderi on behalf of Sagalo from the other, we see her using these sites indiscriminately. She urges Panderi to go to her father-in -Iaw's Earth, but gives this as 'Bat's Nest, Bodigan, lelabbab, Kupa' (chapter 7, line 286). These are four separate si tes (not all of them marked on figure 4.3) which are actually worked not by Sagalo's branch but by the branch of Sindi's own husband . However, although the verbal technique of doublets here makes these sites look like synonyms, they need not be close together on the map, and furthermore each individual Ancestor resides in only one of them: in line 131 of chapter 7 Sindi says she has forgotten whether Indupur resides in Sangkaroren or Sal-Tree Water, and he explains that he wOltld have gone to Sal-Tree Water, which he used to cultivate, but that two of his lineage-brothers invited him to drink (and reside) with them over in Sangkaroren. We can see something of the wider pattern which this creates by looking



222 Dialogues lvilll IIIe dead
at the ro le of just one Earth site, Sangkaroren. This site happens to be relevant for both Sagalo's and Mengalu's people, even though they belong to different lineages. Just as each kin -group, and even household, may work land in the vicinity of several Earth sites, so representatives of more than one unrelated kin-group may assemble independently after death in the same Earth site. The effect of this on the ground is shown in simplified form in figure 9.1. There it can be seen that Mengalu works paddy-fields around the spring itself at Sangkaroren while Sagalo's uncle lkaram works a part of the hillside above. The Earth-Memory at the Sangkaroren spring thus contains Ancestors of both of them . But the significance of this Memory is different in each case. This difference is related not to the amount or type of land they work there, but to the timespan over which they have been working it and the associated history of persons. For Ikaram, Sangkaroren is still an active recruiter, either as a cause of death or by redemption from other Experiences. Thus, along with the other Earth sites of his branch such as Laiba, it is one of the residences of his Memories Nos. 1- 6 and 16 in chapter 7. For Mengalu, by contrast, Sangkaroren no longer recruits new members and has not done so since the generation of his grandfather. From his father's generation onwards, his Memories now go to reside in Hollow Water, Rere and Sweet Mango. Why is this? If we look closely at those ofMengalu's male Ancestors who
are in Sangkaroren, we see that all ofthem without exception have returned

two successive namesakes have died young; he IS therefore still waiting for a further baby to name.
I was on ly partially able to confirm the Earth residence of people in generations -3 and -4, from the memories of Mengalu's generation about who was enumerated in rites of healing when they were children. I think this means that in those earlier days it was still possible in their households to think that their dead in Sangkaroren might attack them, because not all their inheriting and renaming had yet been completed . The next generation, now young adults and below, know these names only as Ancestors and expect them to visit their houses and be fed only in this form . For younger people, these Memories are passing out of living memory. For Mengalu's line, Sangkaroren has become obsolete. One of the Ancestors' original motives for residing in the Earth site, to guarantee their descendants' heirship, is no longer necessary since the inheritance is now complete. There is no further point to be made by any new recruits in entering Sangkaroren after death. Instead , the site which now recruits members ofMengalu's family most actively is Sweet Mango. What is now his plot was cleared later and it was only then that this site began to be active as a Memory for his family. Of the first round of its residents only a second Andaraj (generation - I) and Poke have so far renamed, while even these namesakes are still very small children whose chances of surv ival are uncertain. Here, we see what a feeling of commitment to an Earth site can mean. Mengalu's son Rumbana died young in 1979. The verdict was that he had been taken by Ancestors who had ganged up with Ra'tud-Memory. The song of redemption was

It is here that he expects to reside after hi s own dea th and it wa s because of a disputed plot by this sp rin g that Mengalu was accused of Jamano's death. However, Mengalu's dea d child was not allowed to reside there. The suicide Rumbana later cut into the dialogues with remarks like 'He's my namesake, I'm taking him to stay with me in Jagatumba '. We are now in a position to unders tand what a well-aimed blow this change of residence wa s to Mengalu's feelings about both hi s child and his land sca pe. The placin g of the dead has implica tion s not only for relations between affinal lineages. It also affects future lines of development within the lineage itself through the divi sion between these lines of the property for which the named Earth sites stand. Earth-Memories function as potential title-deeds for possible inheritors in a collateral position, should the entire range of front -line inheritors die out. So what matters is not simply to keep each site populated, on behalf of the lineage as a whole, with representatives from any of its branches. Behind the apparent synonymy of a group of Earth-site names lie the seeds of separation and rivalry: where segments begin to split, as Jamano's is in the process of separating from Mengalu's, the quasi-synonymy of their Earth sites will develop into an opposition betweel; alternatives. At that stage, these segments will have become separate lineages. They will then be able to intermarry and their women will be caught between the two groups of sites which will have become incompatible alternatives. Within its imagery of indivisible bounded solidarity , then, the concept of Earth-Memory is already preparing for the lineage's segmentation . Even where a linea ge does not split, an association with an Earth site cannot la st for ever. Sooner or later the actual piece of land and the group for whom it stands are likely to become separated. An Earth site serves to support the share-out of inheritance down all lines until this seems assured through renaming, most commonly after i;lbout two generations . But it is this very renaming which will destroy the increasingly artificial unity for which the Earth site has stood: through accomplishing the renaming, the EarthMemory 'fades' because it has abolished the relevance of its own imagery .
The joy of naming a baby: retrieving a crucial attribute of the deceased What one might at first sight call the funeral rites last for three years. But it is now clear that a dead person's ' funeral' is really closed only with the name-giving ceremony of his successor. The naming ceremony completes a

sequence which bega n with the first inquest the morning afte r the predecessor's cremation, anything between three years and a hundred years earlier. T he naming ceremony (abiilll1-oll, form ed from the eleme nts 'ca use-to-bear-a-name' and 'chil d') uses the same funeral shamans , the same Ancestor-Men and Ancestor-Women , the same tunes and forms as do the stone-planting and harvest-commemoration (/(C/lja).

They drank a nd da nced for three ni ghts while an orchestra of oboes and syncopated drum s passed through a succession of tunes and beats associated with categories and stages of Memory : the cremation-beat, the Underworld-tune, the Sun-tune when the Memory of a suicide arrived . But at the centre of the swirl of revellers, clustered around the shamans, there had always been a still group of weeping rememberers.

Now, at the name-giving, nobody weeps. The songs and dances take place inside the packed house not amidst laments but amidst shrieks of helpless laughter and obscene horseplay (gatarsi, literally ' hand-scratching' , also meaning 'tickling'). Throughout, the theme is prosperity in the future and joy here and now. A prominent theme is that the Ancestor-Men representing the dead namesake enter the house bringing a branch of a particular thorn (kumba/i) which they hang over the door inside the house to block the entry of attacking Memories. This is the protection whjch the dead namegiver is supposed to provide for the new na mesake against even Ius own death -Ex perience. When I sang this once in a team headed by Mengalu for a baby of our lineage, we claimed to have picked the thorn and brought it all the way from Tungganrutung, the original start of their migration six grandfathers ago. There are numerous subsidiary themes: the mock battle during the day in which people throw pots of turmeric water over each other (the cooling medicine used at birth); the evening of pantomime which includes danced and sung enactments of the baby's future marriage, copulation, cultivation, full harvests , and successful battles with moneylenders and officials. Every image in the earl ier stone-planting and harvest-commemorations now appears to have been a promise of this moment. Four examples will illustrate this.

1. RemOl·illg the rillg alld fulfillillg a promise
One of the central acts of the name-giving is the removal of the brass finger-ring which was tied onto a bracelet around the infant's wrist at the name-promising rite (ab-ji-en, 'ca using the ring to be tied') where the newborn chi ld was singled out by the Ancestor soo n after its birth about three years previously. This is supposedly one of the rings which each participating household had given to the previous holder of the name along with their buffalo , grain and wine, and whjch had been used at the dead person's stone-planting and harvest-commemorations. Despite its promi nence, the Sora are able to say very little about the meaning of the ring, and the texts sung do not elaborate. Given the gynaeco logical associations of metal and the fact that the name-giving coincides, at least in structural time, with the end of breastfeeding and the supposed resumption of normal sexual relations between the parents, I suspect that the ring represents a completely closed and solid form for the soft material from which the child has been moulded. This seems to be echoed in the iron plough-tip on which the baby steps when entering the house (chapter 6, line 212).

into flour by the Ancestor-Women or Ancestor-Men. The flour is then mi xed with water into a paste and fashioned , in Alinsing into a lump or cake, in some villages into a human effigy. T his is then charred on a fire (perhaps representing the pyre) and eaten by the males of the same household s. C hildren may al so eat it, but on no account should it be inges ted by the lineage's unma rried daughters or sisters p ast puberty , as this would make them sterile. No -one was able to give any explana tion of this although the taboo was obviously felt deeply by the girls. But it seems }o me to mean that once a girl has swallowed a portion of the soul of her own patrilineal Ancestor, she is held fast by this incestuous act and will be unable to produce children for the lineage of another man. In other words, this representation of cannibalism is strictly confined among the sexually mature to those through one of whom the perpetuation of the deceased person must pass. The grain which was contributed by all inheriting households had been ground into flour in order to be reintegrated into a single ' person'. What the men are eating is not so much a fragmented share in that person, as when they divide his property, but rather an equal share in the potential for another aspect of the person to emerge on the name-giving day, whole and undivided in the line of just one of them .
3. Making references to ,'egetation which branches ji·011l a single rootstock
In the redemption chants at the stone-planting, much vegetation imagery was used and all of it is brought up again and developed today at the name-giving. The reader may remember that riadi and purpuri (chapter 6, line 208) are two kinds of frequently-branching grass which form mats as they spread out in a circle from a centre to which the stems remain traceable. Similarly, banana plants (chapter 6, line 46), as well as being a symbol for fleshy, sappy vigour, are also reproduced by suckers and offshoots which form around the base. Butid (line 201) is a bristly tuber with long filament roots radiating out. Tarab, laia and singkung (lines 43--4) are climbing creepers which wander from tree to tree, far from their original rootstock. They embody many other properties which make them apposite for the context: the bark of singkung is used as a cooling medicine in childbirth and helps easy delivery because the ripe seed cases spring open and the seed pops out. A further related word which happens not to occur in that text is 'tambob-' (from bob, 'head, apex') which is used of trees and shrubs to mean to sprout again after being cut down to the rootstock. When used of a man after his death, it means to have male heirs. This kind of imagery confirms that the dead person's Earth site was not
Forgetting the dead 229
completely equival ent to the state of Ances torhood but was only a mean s towards that state. Despite their empha sis on whol eness and retention , Earth sites still fragm ent the lineage into sub -groupings . Earth-Memory ha s a somewhat inward -turning, ungenerous, inces tuou s imagery and in terms of p la nt life is associated onl y with waterside pl a nts a nd weeds of rice fi elds (cf. text 6.3) , never with the dry land and mostly aerial bra nching creepers and pinnate-lea fed trees which a re used to represent the lineage. The latter express an outward-going vi gou r as they ramify indefinitely at the tips without losing the unity of their rootstock (cf. chapter 6, text 6. 1, lines 201~2, 2 0 8~9 and the Sora 's own use of ,branch ', ' twig' and ' leaf ' for sections of the linea ge) . I am inclined to see this as an ima gery of the reproduction of the group which spreads free of the divisiveness inherent in the sexual reproduction of humans. Here are no separate consciousnesses and identities with their problems of diffused cores and weak boundaries, no exogamy, no experience or Experiences, no passions or grammatical passivity. The new baby stands at the head of a line which should ramify for ever ~ except that unknown to us , Sun-Woman has already prepared a fatal Experience for it, and ifit is a girl the additional wrench of exogamy is probably lying in wait for her. Both exogamy for women and death-Experience for all people tear the person away from the patrilineage. It is probably here that the analogy between them, which seems to me implicit in Sora thinking throughout, comes nearest to being made explicit.
4. Entering the house
From the time of the stone-planting, an Ancestor both is and is not constantly present in the house of his or her descendants. In one sense, Ancestors are always there by virtue of the stone-planting and the passing on of their inheritance. They are in the grain which is stored and eaten there and which recently in -married wives a re not allowed to fetch down from the loft, and they receive little libations of drink at the foot of the main pillar. In another sense, the Ancestor was led out to the stone-planting and passed through the stone into the Underworld. From there his Memory will sometimes wander back of its own accord and make its presence known by following someone home or otherwise entering the house. If it has done this in the form of his death-Experience (or of one of its sub-Experiences), it receives a banishing-rite; if as an Ancestor, it is fed inside the house and allowed to find its own way home or else kept for a while in a pot or wall painting. Thus the terms of residence in the house granted to the Ancestor in these contexts are conditional.

At the name-givin g, however, the Ancestor is exp licitly inducted into the hou se by opening a closed door to the Ancestor-Men who impersonate him . Or rather, they pretend to break down the door, but do so to the great joy of all those inside. The force of this action a t the name-giving ca n best be appreciated by contras ting it with the other occasion on which the dead knock at a closed door, at the kalj a which commemorates the village's dead collectively.2 Towards nightfall on the first eve ning of the kalja the funeral shama ns sit on the cremation-ground of the lineage who are providing the year's representative house. They go into a preliminary trance in which each person who has died in the previou s three years (in Alinsing in 1979 there were twenty-two of these) announces his or her arrival and is greeted with tears and embraces. Everybody then returns to the villa ge a nd the Memories who have been raised come with them. One group of AncestorMen (for the kalja , those of all the village's lineages are pooled) barricade themselves inside the locked house while the others stand outside in the darkness armed with axes, swords and arrows, and sing demanding to be let in. The Ancestor-Men inside sing their reply on behalf of the living householders, widows, children and others. They raise doubts and objections, especially about the authenticity of the petitioner. The whole business takes several hours, since it must be gone through with appropriate wording for each Memory's family. Finally, the Ancestors break down the door and force their way in. They are followed by a riotous crowd of dancers and musicians who have already been drinking for some time elsewhere. At this point the pyre-lighters start dancing on the pitch of the roof outside, shaking the house and tearing a hole in the thatch in order to lower the bamboo ladder into the hole of the mortar. The ladder reaches through the mortar into the Underworld and a pile of grain and pea seeds is poured around its base. The ladder duplicates the Ancestors' path earlier in the evening when they were led from the cremation-ground to the door. Now the Ancestors are able to climb directly up it and enter the bodies of the shamans who sit on the mortar. The main trance takes place here at the foot of the ladder a t intervals during the rest of this and the two successive nights. Yet towards the end of the thii'd night the Ancestors are sent back down the ladder to the Underworld and told not to return until the following year. Outside, their buffalos are being massacred in the dawn light and their souls sent down with the Ancestors. Then the Ancestor-Men chop up the ladder with axes to the accompaniment of frenzied dancing on the shattered fragments. They will destroy this path a second time later in the day when they take these fragments to a cremation site and burn them . The name-giving echoes the kalja by replicating this motif of the
Forgelling the dead 23 1
Ancestors' forced entry, but gives it a new and optimistic twist. T hough there is no ladder, the two parties of Ancestor-Men sing in exactly the same way on either side of the closed door and event ua ll y break in . But this time the entry is perma nent, in the form of the name whi ch during the trance on the mortar will be attached definitively by the Ancestor to the child , through the act of un ty ing the ring . To the extent that the Ancestor is in the name, he or she now resides in the hou se as one co mponent of the baby's person. It is not so much a personal attribute as a social one, that aspect of the person which identifies something of the child 's ancestral origins a nd which the living ca n best apprehend a nd manipulate as a la bel. It contributes towards the formation of so meo ne who, while he is a new person, is defined and circumscribed as such by an elaborate socia l co ntext which enco mpa sses both himse lf a nd hi s predecessor.
The ultimate residue of the person and the final death of Memories Most of the strands which went to make up the deceased have by now been dispersed and diffused among many living persons, while his name has bee n returned undiluted, normally to a single living successor. The return of the Ancestor's name is no reincarnation , nor is the continuity from one namesake to the next cumulative, as in the idea of karma. It is a repetition of the name, implying perhaps a repetition of the person's lineal role but not of his biography or destiny, which would have included the repetition of his encounters with Experiences. Meanwhile the Ancestor continues to exist as a separate person , a Memory who can talk to and protect the second namesake . It is this aspect which will eventually die again in the Underworld , be cremated a second time a nd turn into a butterfly. Who or wha t is the dead person by this last stage? In order to understand the significance of this, a complete phase of time should be seen as embracing not two but three holde rs of a na me. There are a lways two concurrent holders of the name at the centre of the stage, either one living and one dead , or else both dead and with the more recent one seeking a baby to name while the older one waits in the wings only long enough to see him successful. The work of the first holder is done only with the appearance of the third. I have tried to represent this in figure 9.2. The stages shown are not necessarily of equal duration, and it can be see n that the state of being 'alive' (am eng) is only the first out offive stages which I have identified in the person's total known existence. The stages of structural time beginning with Roman numerals correspond in lived time to:

A sim.ilar diagram co uld be drawn to represeflt the ea rlier return of the other attrjbutes of the deceased . The decea sed sheds these one at a time by returning them in so me way to the society of the living while himself co ntinuing along his own path . In each of these progressive separa tions, one of his attributes returns to opera te among other living perso ns whjle his other attributes remain fully dead. F irst he passes on hi s Experience as pa rt of becoming an Ancestor ; as an Ancestor, he then hand s on his property; finally another attribute, this time ILis name, is separated off and returned to the rea lm of the ljvin g. Yet the existence of a second dea th in the Und erworld shows that there remains some ultimate residue which continues its onward trajectory. This residue appears to be the dead person 's subjective consciousness which persists while being progressively stripped of attributes. If there is any resemblance here to the wider Indian religious idea of mo/qa, liberation, this resemblance comes with a quite different valuation. For the dead , their condition is not so much a purification and release as a deprivation and progressive attenuation. It is undoubtedly better to be alive than dead , and life is not a preparation for death . The ordeals ofa shaman's initiation a nd practice involve daily journeys into a state of temporary death . But this is done not as the personal voyage of a mystic or ascetic but as part of the shaman's participation in the affa irs of the living, in their emotions, hea lth and social relations. The living have food, warmth, sex, friendship, a productive economy, and laughter (I have heard the dead crack wry jokes but never heard them laugh). The Underworld contains a bleak pastiche of ljfe above ground. The agriculture of the Underworld fails to feed and the only sustenance which satisfies the dead is the soul (puradan) of people, animals, grain and alcoholic drinks from this world. It is this valuation of death which gives the recently dead their intense desire to interfere in our affairs and leads them to ask repeatedly to handle and wear the personal belongings, tools, clothes and ornaments which they used in life (cf. chapter 5, line 43; chapter 7, lines 251-8). This valuation of death constitutes the essence ofloss both for the living and for the dead , which lies in the very fact that the former will forget the latter. The dead have their own feelings but it is the living from whose perspective the whole system is ultimately conceptualised. It is in their first ,

Everythin g a bout the deceased which has character is retrieved so far as possible and brought back to the realm of the livin g. As the dead drift inexorab ly away from us towards butterflyhood they also become more inaccessible and unknowabl e. At times, the shady lower branches overhanging a stream are sett led with swarms of butterflies. Sora people say that butterfl ies are indestructible, since when they flock to a pot of sweet wine they apparently drown but when pulled out they come to life again a nd flyaway. But they are a lso inarticulate and characterless . Butterfl ies are beyond the rea ch of di a logue a nd they receive no cu lt. A person 's l-Iltimate residue, his lonely co re, cannot even be spoken to. It can never find its way back into the society of the living and must ultima tely die again and lose even the society of the dead . From the subjective viewpoint of the deceased, by far the greater part of his consciousness if not a ll of it recedes beyond the range of the awareness of the living while remaining in a state of self-awareness - except that it no lon ger ha s any experiences of which to be aware. A butterfly is a consciousness which cannot cease to exist, but which has no attributes because notrung can be known about it. Incapable of activity and action, liberated from passivity and passion but also deprived for ever of company, butterflies are Memories without rememberers. This, at last, is the final dea th of the person.

Dialogues with the self? Sora bereavement and the presuppositions of contemporary psychotherapy
How can we understand Sora dialogues with the dead in terms of our own lives, our own memories and forgetting? The feelings oflove, apprehension, jealousy, loneliness and companionable cheer seem recognisable, at times piercingly so . But the way in which these are put together seems strange. In particular, many readers may have difficulty in believing in, or even conceiving, the intense two-way traffic which the Sora say passes constantly between the realms of life and death. The deaths of those around us foreshadow our own and are something which we must all face. But different societies give people very varying means with which to do this. Gorer, in an examination of mourning in Britain, traces a radical change between the Victorian era and his own, a change which he pinpoints around the period of the First World War. After his brother died, he says, people treated him kindly for a while, but soon expected him to resume normal life. Then, he writes,
I refused invitations to cocktail parties, explaining that I was mourning; the people who invited me responded to this statement with shocked embarrassment, as if I had voiced some appalling obscenity .. . educated and sophisticated though they were, [they] mumbled and hurried away. They clearly no longer had any guidance from ritual as to the way to treat a self-confessed mourner; and , I suspect, they were frightened lest I give way Lo my grief, and involve them in a distasteful upsurge of emotion. (GoreI' 1965: 14)
Gorer's sister-in-law was similarly unsupported socially and 'let herself be, almost literally, eaten up with grief' (Gorer 1965: 15). Gorer concludes that 'this lack of accepted ritual and guidance is accompanied by a very considerable amount of maladaptive behaviour' (Gorer 1965: 110). What could constitute 'adaptive' behaviour and how could we recognise it? It is perhaps impossible to say for certain when, if ever, someone has

recovered from loss. Certainly , as a system of psychotherapy , Sora dia logues with the dead a re not inevitably successful. F or example, T a baro ha s already prolonged the funeral cycle of his son Rumbana from the usual three annual kalJa s to four , but still remain s a numbed , empty 'grain ba sket' (kliltaben) . Again , the Sora reli a nce on the a bility of the dea d to express themselves articulately in lan guage is of littl e help to Ra na tang when ILi s baby dies in chapter 5, or indeed to the famil y of any infant (from the Latin in ~ral1s, ' not-speaking'). This problem is compli cated by the difficulty of di stingui shing grief as a feeling from mourning as a process and an activity , since it is the latter which has the more outward, public form and has attracted more attention from anthropologists. The greatest cultural elaboration may not always coincide with the point of deepest feeling (cf. R. Rosaldo 1984: 185ff, 192). Thus, a mere formal description of the funeral of Ranatang's unnamed infant, attenuated as it was on the grounds that the baby did not yet have a full soul , could not do justice to what we saw of the depth of the parents ' feelings. But the evidence presented throughout this book should be more than enough to challenge the popular view still often heard in the West, that people suffer grief less acutely in societies where the mortality rate is higher. This view is also widespread among historians of the Western past (e.g. Aries 1962: 38- 9; Stone 1977: 70, 420, 680, both cited and opposed by Macfarlane, 1979: 106-7; cf. Macfarlane 1981: 250- 1) . But in most cases, the order of the Sora funeral sequence does link public procedures and supposed inner feelings. So long as the dead keep reverting to their Experience aspect, it is clear that their rememberers have not yet been released from the most intense phase of their grief. Subsequently the dead and their mourners enter less intense phases . The pacing of the three-year funeral sequence does not suit all deaths and all mourners, and we have seen cases which remain highly problematic even after their third karja. Indeed, the fact that Memories do not ultimately die their second deaths until around the time that their living rememberers are undergoing their own first deaths, is an implicit statement that one remains affected by all one's Memories for the rest of one's life. The healing of the mourner, whatever this is, lies in the Memory's changes of form but not in the Memory's annihilation. We can advance our view of the adequacy of mourning procedures only if we enlarge our horizon to examine their entire scope within the society they serve. It is precisely because the Sora ideas of the person, of memory, of loss and healing, invite comparison with concepts from the relatively asocial disciplines of psychology and psychiatry, that the need for this



238 Dialogues with the dead
approach becomes so apparent. In proposing the gloss 'Memory' for 'sonum' in chapter 8, I sketched in a contrast between the exteriority of a sonum and the interiority of a Memory as the latter must appear in such secular Western fields of discourse . What kind of bereavement therapy will be genera ted by interpretations of the interior sort in which the Sora style of dialogue is not possible? The modern industrial society of which anthropol ogy is itself a part is extremely varied. Its approaches to death include various interpretations of Christianity; adaptations of Buddhist eschatology (Fremantle and Trungpa 1987); spiritualism and parapsychology (Thouless 1984); secularised death rites (Lane 1981: 82-6; Huntington and Metcalf 1979: 184-211); widely cast theological and anthropological comparisons (respectively Hick 1976; Bloch and Parry 1982); and the sociology of clinical necessity (Hockey 1990). Despite this variety, the upsurge during recent years of interest in death and mourning is certainly related to a widespread sense that procedures in our own society have become inadequate. (Or perhaps this variety is itself a symptom of this inadequacy, which extends to the sheer physical encounter with death. For example, as a British adult I handled and even saw my first corpses only in Sora land.) The concern which underlies Gorer's remark about 'maladaptive' mourning has since grown into a significant movement. The professions of 'bereavement counselling' and 'thanatology' arose through such pioneers as Kubler-Ross in the United States (1969) and Saunders in Britain (Saunders 1959; Saunders and Baines 1983). Numerous professional and self-help books have appeared with titles like Death and the family: the importance of mourning (Pincus, 1976), The courage to grieve (Tate1baum, 1981), Grief counselling and grief therapy: a handbookfor the mental health practitioner (Worden 1982). The emphasis in this literature on 'facing' or 'coping' clearly supports Gorer's point (1965: 110) about a 'lack of accepted ritual and guidance': Facing death (Bertman 1991), Coping with cot death (Murphy 1990), Bere{/\lement: a guide to coping (Golding 1991). This movement has been linked with an interest in death in other cultures, in the hope that these less 'maladaptive' forms of behaviour can somehow be integrated into our own in order to reform the latter. I But our analysis of Sora mourning suggests that, to the extent that we judge them successful, such practices cannot easily be broken up for eclectic appropriation. Nor can our own practice easily be stretched to accommodate them. For a possible reason why this may be so, I should like to turn to a very finely written paper by Freud called Mourning and melancholia (1957, first published in 1917). This paper, whether acknowledged or not, seems to be the source of most subsequent secular Western treatments of bereavement

within the idiom of psychotherapy. It is a theoretical statement from which a model ca n be extracted and laid side by side with one derived from So ra practice. An initial comparison of these models in formal terms will lead us to an enhanced understa nding of the scope of dialogue within Sora society as a whole. My choice of classic Freudian psychoanalysis does not gra nt it any absolute interpretative status (a s in much psychoanalytic anthropology) but merely reflects its position as arguably the Western world's lea ding blueprint for practical intervention in the mourning process. Indeed , the point of comparison would be lost if psychoanalysis were taken as anything more than an ethnoscience from modern industrial society. The fact that this hegemonic literature derives mainly from Freud rather than from, say, lung (e.g. 1959 [1934]), whose collective unconscious is hardly ever mentioned , has its own consequences and merely serves to sharpen the contrast. 2 Freud's model depends on a contrast between 'mourning' and 'melancholia' as two possible responses to bereavement. He presents mourning as a normal condition which is resolved with the passage of time as the mourner's 'libido' withdraws itself from the deceased, who is referred to as the 'loved object'. Melancholia, on the other hand, is a pathological disturbance of this process in which this healing fails to occur: the bereaved person's 'ego' turns in on itself, 'identifies' with the lost object and loses interest in stayin!! alive. In either case the involvement between the two persons is so intense that 'the existence of the lost object is psychically prolonged' (Freud 1957: 245):
this withdrawal oflibido is not a process that can be accomplished in a moment, but must certainly ... be one in which progress is long-drawn-out and gradual ... [FJirst one and then another memory is activated ... If the object does not possess this great significance for the ego - a significance reinforced by a thousand links - then , too, its loss will not be of a kind to cause either mourning or melancholia. (Freud 1957: 256)
In normal mourning,
[rJeality-testing has shown that the loved object no longer exists, and it proceeds to demand that all libido shall be withdrawn from its attachments to that object ... Normally, respect for reality gains the day . Nevertheless its order cannot be obeyed at once .. . [W]hen the work of mourning is completed the ego becomes free and uninhibited again. (Freud 1957: 244-5)
The ego accepts this 'verdict of reality' (Freud 1957: 255) because it gains a narcissistic satisfaction from being alive and does not wish to share the fate of the object that has been 'abolished'. It therefore severs its attachment to that object (Freud 1957: 255).



240 Dialogues lVilh Ihe dead
In melancholia , on the other hand ,
[a]n object-choice, an a llachment of the libido to a particular perso n, had a t one time existed; then, owing to a real slight or disappo intment co min g from this loved person , the object-relationship was shattered ... [T]he Free libido was not displaced on to another object; it was withdrawn into th e ego. There, however, it ... served to establish an identification [em phasis original] of the ego with the abandoned object. Thus the shadow of the object fell upon th e ego, and th e latte r co uld henceFo rth be judged by a special agency, as thou gh it were an object, the fo rsa ken object .. . This substitution of ide ntifica tion for object-love is a n important mechanism in the narci ssistic a ffections. . . (Freud 1957: 248- 9)
Now 'one pa rt of the ego sets itself over aga inst the other, judges it critically and, as it were, takes it as its object' (Freud 1957: 247) . 'The patient . .. reproaches himself, vilifies himse lf and expects to be cast out and punished' (Freud 1957: 246) since '[i]n mourning, it is the world wllich ha s become poor and empty; in melancholia it is the ego itself ' (Freud 1957: 246). The final result is a loss of self-regard so severe that the patient even loses the will to live (Freud 1957: 246). This is related to the bereaved person 's identification with the deceased in a particularly interesting way:
Hostile impulses against parents (a wish that they should die) are repressed at times when compassion for the parents is active - at times of their illness or death. At such times it is a manifestation [of melancholia] to reproach oneself for their death ... or to punish oneself in a hysterical fashion . .. with the same states [of illness] that they have had . (Freud 1957: 240)
The resonances between this and Sora thinking on bereavement are remarkable. Freud's formulation reads almost like a direct translation of that of the Sora into an alternative set of metaphors. There is a comparable intense attachment, based on memory, between the bereaved and the deceased; a comparable gradual, painful withdrawal which eventually leaves the successful mourner ' free' ; an ambivalence between compassion and hostility; a risk of a shared fate through an identification between the two parties; and, where the entire process fails, a comparable loss of the will or ability to live. But underlying this, there is a crucial difference. Freud has no doubt about the nature of reality. It can be 'tested' (Freud 1957: 244) in such a way tha t it returns a 'verdict' (Freud 1957: 255) which has the power' to dema nd that all libido shall be withdrawn from its attachments to that object' (Freud 1957: 255). This verdict is that 'the object no longer exists' (Freud 1957: 255) and the bereaved can either show a ' respect for reality' (Freud 1957: 244) or turn 'away from reality' into 'hallucinatory wishful psychosis' (Freud 1957: 244). The Sora are also sure about the nature of reality and the
Dialogues lvilII (h e self'? 24 1
possibility of testing it. However, their form of reality-testing (lul1gjil/g, chap ter 5, lin e 42) returns the opposite verdict: the deceased does continue to exist. But he does so in a way which modifies the dynamics of hi s relationship to the living since these dynamics are not the sa me as when both parties were still alive. By denying the Mem ory its a uton omo us ex iste nce, Fre ud reverses the Sora model and takes the ini tia tive out of the hand s of the dead. Fo r according to the So ra , the power of the livin g to modify their own psycllic states depends on their own selective respo nse to this initi ative, so as to modify its impact. Thus it is not the Sora mourner who find s it difficult to 'a bandon a libidinal position' (Freud 1957: 244) but the deceased . Indeed , the dead may even be more articulate than the berea ved about their sense of loss (e.g. Panderi in chapter 7, line 185). Similarly, where Freud talks of the mourner 's ' hostile impulses aga in st parents' (or against the deceased generally), the Sora talk of the ho stility of parents and other ancestors towards their descendants. Again, Freud talks of the melancholic's self-reproaches (Freud 1957: 248) and 'insistent communicativeness which finds satisfaction in self-exposure' (Freud 1957: 247). These self-reproaches and this self-exposure similarly invert the Sora process in which the reproaches and exposure come from the dead, as when little Amboni accuses her Mummy of not caring about her enough or when adulterous lovers are faced with the woman 's dead husband at the end of chapter 4. The living respond by self-justification, as Sindi does to Amboni (chapter 7, lines 255, 257) or by counter-reproach (e.g. Sindi to Palda, chapter 7, line 198 and elsewhere). To summarise, then, and using the word 'remember' to covel' all relevant mental processes, we may represent the Freudian and the Sora schemata of bereavement as in figure 10.1. In Freud's model , the barrier between the living and the dead is quite impermeable because reality-testing shows that the dead do not exist. The bereaved person's libido has feelings of involvement, such as love 01' reproach , towards the deceased . In successful mourning which respects reality, this impulse bounces off the barrier and is deflected elsewhere, perhaps onto another loved object. In melancholia , this diversion goes wrong and the libido is withdrawn into the ego through an identification with the deceased , that is, with someone who does not exist. In the Sora model, despite their ontological differences, the entities on both sides of the barrier are real. The impulse which is equivalent to Freud's libido emanates, not from the bereaved person , but from the decea sed. It is with the latter that the initiative lies, too, to set the tone of his relationship with the bereaved. This impulse also has dynamic properties. But since the

barr ier betwee n them is permeable, this dynamism is not such that the impulse is subject to deflection. Rather, throu gh di a logue it receives a response; and both the initial impul se and its answering respon se are made up of two contrastin g strands, corresponding to the Experience and the Ancestor aspects of the deceased. At first, hi s Experience aspect predomi nates as he attacks the living rememberer, who respond s in the sa me idiom of Leopard , Sun , etc., by performing an appropriate healing rite. But even at this stage, the dead person 's Ancestor aspect is la te nt and all'ead y waiting to emerge. As time goes by and his redemption takes gradual effect, hi s Experience aspect fades and this Ancestor aspect comes to take over completely . But all this takes place aga in st an evolving reciproca l relationship between living and dea d . Thou gh the Experience aspect fad es first, in the end even the Ancestor aspect fades as their mutual bond weakens in preparation for the Ancestor's second death and final
disappearance. In Freud's view, dead people are objects existing only in the minds of those who remember them and are manipulated by them passively. Their acknowledged power over their rememberer therefore stems from properties of the latter's own mind. In the Sora view , the dead make the living into passive objects of their own activity. They are autonomously existent and sentient, with the power not only to initiate relationships with living people but also to dominate the tone of such relationships. Any analytical distinction which Freud makes to ease the situation lies within the bereaved person's process of remembering the deceased, not in the properties of the deceased himself. Hence to plunge into melancholia , and perhaps to die of grief or by suicide, is the result of the bereaved person's failure to redirect his own attachment to the deceased. For the Sora, by contrast, the distinction which allows the dynamic development of the situation is a property of the dead themselves, not of the living. So to die of grief or by suicide is the result of the bereaved person's failure to ward off or modify the dead person's attachment to himself. This kind of attachment was illustrated by the role played in Jamano's death by his aggrieved wife Onsam (chapter 5); while for suicide it can be seen in Palda's attempts on the life ofSargia (chapter 7, introduction to Palda's appearance as sonum/ Memory No . 10) and on the life of Sarsuno (chapter 7, lines 169 ff) , as well as in chapter 4, where a boy kills himself at the beckoning of his predeceased girl-friend. Can the contrast between these models explain why Freud's patients suffer from disorders such as narcissism, schizophrenia and psychosis

rather tha n from the effects of huma n co nsciou sness stored in the Sun , the Ea rth, rocks and trees? C lea rly , the 'co nstitu tion of the human ego ' (Freud 1957: 247) revea led by the two syste ms is not the same: in Sora thinking it is not 'one part of the ego' which 'sets itself against the other, judges it critica ll y, and , as it were takes it as its object' (Freud 1957: 247) but a separate entity externa l to the person. Both systems perceive a tension between two states of mind. Fre ud 'abo li shes' the dead , then analyses the livin g and find s this tension entirely within them; the Sora analyse the dead, who experience a tension in their own selves and communicate this tension to the living through dialogue. The discussion in chapter 8 makes it clear that it would be difficult in Sora eve n to frame the proposition that Memories are loca ted within the mind of the rememberer, since it is these sonum s themse lves which show us how the Sora concept of ,mind ' itse lfi s radically different from ours. The difference in the two systems' loca tions of Memories means that the specific Freudian experience is isolated and , as such, must inevitably be judged 'subjective'. As we have seen, the Sora do not impose upon experience the dichotomy of subjective and objective. But if we insist on applying it to living Soras' experiences of the dead, it is clear that whatever their 'subjective' origins and continued sustenance in the inner feelings of individual s, they are at the same time made 'objective'. This is achieved both by the inter-subjective consensus which is established through dialogue (chapter 5) and also through the cognitive map to which experience is referred (chapter 4). This map is one and the same as that of the physical landscape over wnich groups of people walk, work and dispute every day of their lives and which is equally a map of the social order in the broadest sense. It is this common landsca pe which furnishes the means by which both personal experience and the social order are regulated and perpetuated . Thus for Freud , as for the Western secular tradition generally, the structure of experience is ba sed largely on the structure of the experiencing mind ; wnile for the Sora, it is based on that of the outside world - itself also conscious - which that mind experiences. The Sora's outside world of ordered space is set in a time which likewi se has its own ordering - or maybe more than one ordering. There is seasonal time, which determines agriculture, the annual collective stages of the funeral cycle and thus ultimately the ontological evolution of the deceased . And then there is the inner time-scale of the mourner, with its more uneven , jerky rhythm and backward counter-flows. The healing time presupposed in psychotherapy is more shapeless, since it recognises the latter kind of



246 Dialog ues Ivith the dead
time but not the former. The reasons for this , I suggest, lie not only in psychotherapy's contrast between the normal and the pathologica l, but also in its public, con sensu a l context. The kind of mournin g which the psychoanalyst Vo lkan calls ' un complicated' (i .e . analogous to Freud's normal mournin g) goes through recogni sa ble sta ges (Volka n 1981: 25 ) which Volka n ca lls 'self-limited sequenti a l patterns of behaviour' (Volkan 1981 : 37). Here he follows Pollock (1961) , who distingui shed between the acute and chronic stages of reaction , a nd whose 'acute' sta ge is further subdivided into 'shock reaction' , 'acute affective reaction' and 'separation reaction ' (Volkan 198 1: 41-4). Bowlby and Parkes (1970) , despi te minor differences , had similarly distingui shed an initial numbness , a sta ge of yearning for the lost fi gure, a period of di sorganisation, and finally one of greater or lesser reorga nisa tion (discussed in Volka n 1981 : 45- 6). In reviewing these, Volkan accepts Pollock's division into two general stages, which he calls the 'initial stage' and the 'work of mourning, which is, in effect, a longer second stage' (Volkan 1981: 46). The initial stage includes features such as numbness, shock, denial of the death, anger and ' the splitting of ego functions with regard to the perception of the death' (Volkan 1981 : 46) . 'Ifno complications supervene,' he says, 'one can expect the manifestations of grief to disappear within two to six months . . . During this period, signs of the initial stage ... may suddenly disappear and re-appear [my emphasis] again, until the mourner, after acknowledging his anger, settles into the next stage, the prolonged work of mourning with its piecemeal advances.' (Volkan 1981: 46- 7) We can see that, however uncertainly the stages of time are defined, there is a sense of an overarching progression, and within this and against it, a defiant backward-flowing strain of're-appearing' (in Sora, gorod- 'wandering' or 'reverting'). It seems to me that these writers are trying to convey a similar message to that of the Sora, with their progression from 'Experience' to 'Ancestor' and from Recent, Distressing Memories to Old , Undisturbing ones. Both Freud's model and that of the Sora rely for their dynamic element on a distinction, in the one case between mourning and melancholia (or for Volkan 1981, Worden 1982 and others, 'uncomplicated' and 'complicated' reactions) , in the other between Ancestor and Experience. The patient (respectively living or dead) is directed towards one of these to the exclusion of the other. In both cases it may be said that aspects of these two terms can coexist and overlap, as if the seeds of melancholia were latent in every mourner, just as the Ancestor and Experience aspects are present in every dead

person . However , where Fre ud appears to regard these as paths which are at least in principle alternative and mutually excl usive , Sora thinking treats them rather as successive stages . T he transition between these stages is made possible by the structure of the funera l rites and takes place within thi s structure. W hile Sora certainly make a distinction between the desirable and the undesirable and this distinction has normative implica tions, there appears to be nothing which corresponds to the Freudian distinction between the normal and the pathological. It is not simply that Freud assigns terms like self-exposure and the splittin g of roles to the pathological : th ey co ntribute towards the very definition of pathology. By co ntrast, the Sora integrate both their terms, Ancestor and Expe rience, in to a chronologica l process by whi ch the mourner is led straight into the more dangerous half of the dist inct ion a nd eventually out the other side. This difference may be summarised as one between alternative paths (the pa th of mournin g versus that of melancholia) and coexistent, parallel path s (Experience versus Ancestor) , with a progressive shift in emphasis over time . Both sides of the Sora di stinction are prese nt from the beginning. The intensity of the initial grief is allowed its expression and any necessary adjustment in private fee lings takes place within, and by means of, the balancing of these . Yet it is a ma tter of inexorable necessi ty that this should be modified not only over time but through the very ordering of that time, because this ordering is a public one. The rea son why the ordering in the Western model is so relatively undeveloped is that a patient's emotional time is not closely tied in with anyone else's. Starting from this contrast in presuppositions about space, time and the existence of the dead, one can point to significant contrasts in the scope claimed by each sys tem . For both of them , dea th is more than it seems at first sight. Freud's understanding of melancholia in bereavement ramifies into a wider field of loss and neurosis, an association which is made more explicit in Klein' s development of his thought, in which being weaned amounts to an early bereavement in infancy (Klein 1935; 1940). Yet however widely the field of dea th is defined , what Freud offers us is still no more than a psychology of death , while the Sora offer a psychology, a sociology, a cosmology, indeed an everything of death. Why do Sora people find dea th so important, so interesting, so powerfully explanatory? Death is not an absence or negation of life: both are phases of existence. It is this which makes dialogue between living and dead possible and important, and makes its format like a continuation of conversation among the living. Among many other clues, a great part of my evidence has been from word s spoken by Soras to each other and to me.



248 Dialog ues IFith th e dead
The doings and say in gs of others form the main theme of most conversation s; and So ras confess their feelings in phrases a nd motifs which are partly conventional but which at the same time I believe are often relatively un guarded attempts at se lf-revelation. Inama's recounting of hi s dreams about me (chapter 2), whether o r not he 'rea lly ' had them, I take to be a way of saying that he loved me and missed me durin g my a bsence. During one part of Jamano's stone-planting, I overheard Mengalu saying to Tabaro in a weary voice:
Tabaro, [pa use) I've grown old. For us, it 's this journey, it's this stone pulled upright, it 's this merging .. . This stone is what we become , this rite is what we become, and that's it. Tbe liquor we drink , th e rice we ea t - where are we going to go? We just go down that path .. .
These are things which can be said without embarrassment and in front of others, though there are always veils of context and a shared past. Thus , Mengalu is an 'age-mate' (tojleud, 'near-born') of Tabaro who has grown up with him since childhood. Tabaro is the husband of the shaman Rondang (chapter 7) and father of the suicide Rumbana who also tried recently to make Mengalu's son kill himself. Meanwhile, Mengalu and his sons are among the claimants to the dead Rumbana's estate (chapter 8); while at that day's funeral for Jamano Mengalu was under scrutiny because the dead man had already accused him of sorcery. A shared past leads to a fondness for reminiscing. Whenever my first Sora friend Inama hugged me after a long separation, he would spend several minutes recounting our shared experiences, repeating our old conversations as if verbatim: 'Do you remember how we lay in the river in the sunshine, and you said . .. and then I said .. .' Not only affection but where they 'are appropriate' (tam-) anger and hostility, too, can be openly expressed. Aggrieved conversations easily slide into the rudi format of debate or mutual haranguing. But there are many situations in which one cannot speak as one feels. Here, the speech that is uttered may not so much reveal as conceal (soso -). Sora talk of 'inner' (i11l1gen) and 'outer' (bay ira) soul or feeling and are alert for clues to the implicit to an extent which elsewhere might be considered a rare gift. Once, a group of friends asked to hear some white people's music. I had been among them for more than a year and had never once played the tapes which I had brought with me and had expected to be my constant companions. I had made the mistake of bringing intense pieces rather than something lighter: after the first few bars ofa Schubert quartet, during which I was not aware that I had betrayed any emotion, several of them started saying 'It's upsetting you, isn ' t it - why don't you turn it off?'
Dialogues with th e sele 249
So me of what is known or sensed implicitly , becomes part of the flow of goss ip. But some of it cannot be sa id openly in front of the parties who are most concerned. Shama ns do not simply hea l people's illnesses, or even their griefs. The shaman provides a means through which the impli cit can be made exp licit and the un speakab le be bro ught to the point of ha vin g been spoken. F rom time to time, in an attempt to return hospitality , I used to invite gro ups of Soras for an exped ition to the coastal town of Visakhapa tn a m, some 200 miles away , where I had the use of a hostel. On one occasion, half of the group waited in the hos tel while I took the other half to the post office to phone them up. The result wa s even more of an entertainment than I had expected, since they reduced themse lves to helpless laughter by confronting each other with illicit affairs and other embarrassments and indiscretion s (in the end the postmaster politely asked us to lea ve, as we were so noisy) . These were matters which were known to all but which could never before have been raised so directly with the person concerned. Afterwards , they agreed that this had been possible because the phone resembled a shaman in that you do not see the other person's face while you talk with them. The use of telephones was unprecedented , offering a protective screen of a kind not otherwise availa ble or even conceiva ble between living speakers. It is precisely a screen of this sort which lifts inhibitions once one of the speakers is dead . As in the case of the psychoanalyst's patient, the affecting person, or Memory, must be absent. But here this absence is not simply a consequence of the privacy of the consulting room, as when a domineering parent has been left outside in the waiting room . Since dialogues are public, the only way the affecting person can be absent is by being dead. Though the person with whom one is concerned or obsessed still speaks for himself, he has embarked on a path of progressive conventionalisation and simplification. Whatever his new ca usal power as a Memory , he ha s at the same time become diminished psychically: he has become manipulable to a degree to which no living person would consent. So to what extent is a dead person really there when he speaks? Once, when I missed a divination I asked a friend afterwards which Memory had claimed responsibility for the patient's illness. 'It was so-and-so,' he said . When I sounded surprised, he added, 'So he said, but how can we know? It's only words (Edte gamete, do Ivan galambe? Berna sadtang) .' There were many amusing stories circulating which played on the theatricality of dialogue. Once, a young man disappeared in Assam and was presumed dead . Some years after his funeral had been performed back home he turned up, much to the embarrassment of the funeral shaman. In another story an old man doubted that he would receive his buffalos after death and



250 Dialog ues Il'ith the dead
insisted on staging his own funeral while he was still alive. The shaman somehow obliged. Later, this man also insisted on passing on his name to his baby grandson. But since a woman is forbidden to utter her fa ther-in-law's name while he is still alive, the child's mother was reduced to calling her own baby simply 'the old man' (talajba). Another story concerned a meteorite which crashed into a paddy-field near Alinsing. The villagers gave it a stone-planting, at which the meteorite's Ancestors spoke through the shaman and thanked them nicely for lookin g after their child when it had died so far away from its family and friends. People roar with laughter when they recount these events. Yet such stories do not seem to provide grounds for scepticism, nor do they diminish the intensity of the majority of dialogues , which are meant to be taken serious ly . What makes these stories so bizarre is only that they push dialogue up against the limits of context. But where the context is unexceptional, as the remark ' it's only words' shows, this ambiguity is an essential part of dialogue. In asking who it is who speaks, we are also asking who or what a shaman is. Napier, writing about masks, talks of our
conflicting views that resu lt, at least in part, from a need to see mask wearers exclusively as either true incarnators or mere dramatists. Neither our critical faculties nor our modes of description a llow us to envision a context in which both of these dispositions might function at one and the same time. (Napier 1986: xxiv)
This comment may help us to recognise the extent of the enigma which the shaman presents. In the first place, whether she is seen as incarnator or dramatist, the kind of multiple-personality interpretation sometimes applied to a shaman is clearly inadequate. Apart from this approach's implication of pathology, multiple personalities belong to the world of private fantasies and concern largely the person who contains them . But Sora dialogue, with its legalistic overtones and its central regulating role in society, discusses the concerns of others at least as much as those of the shaman. Again, the shaman is more active than any blank, reflective screen or mirror (Lacan 1949; Winnicott 1980a). Even with their partial and guarded emotional involvement with their clients through 'countertransference', the psychoanalyst and psychotherapist have been left behind. Another possible way of understanding the Sora shaman is to compare her with the dramatist or the creator of dramatic novels . An author who has been interpreted in a way which makes him sound somewhat like a Sora shaman is Dostoyevsky. His novels have been called 'polyphonic', since they unfold through a 'plurality of voices' (Bakhtin 1984 [1929]). Dos
Dialogues with the self'? 25 1
toyevsky's characters, writes Bakhtin, are themselves subjects rather than objects wi thin the consciousness of the a uthor: within this work there is no outside viewpoint and so no 'finalising' authorial voice (Bakhtin 1984 [1929]: especially chapter I). The characters arefree from the usual author's synthesis 'which would then cancel out all preceding links as . .. totally superseded' (Bakhtin 1984 [1929]: 26). Lunacharsky vividly summarises this part of Bakhtin's argument:
Dostoyevsky's novels are superbly staged dialogu es ... Dostoyevsky deliberately puts certain vital problems up for discussion before these highly individual 'voices' , trembling with passion and flickering with the flame of fanaticism, while he himself remains a mere spectator of the convu lsive disputes which ensue, a curious lookeron. . . (Lunacharsky 1973: 82)
Here there is a clear parallel with Sora dialogue in the legalistic and moral debate between positions embodied in persons. But is either Dostoyevsky or the Sora shaman really as absent as this? Bakhtin writes that Dostoyevsky (in this translation spelt Dostoevsky)
is profoundly active, but his activity is of a special dialogic sort. It is one thing to be active in relation to a dead thing, to voiceless material that can be molded and formed as one wishes, and another thing to be active ill relalioll 10 someolle else's tillillg, aulonomous cOllsciouslless . .. Dostoevsky frequently interrupts, but he never drowns out the other's voice, never finishes it off 'from himself , that is, out of his own and alien consciousness. (Bakhtin 1984 [1929): 285, italics o rigin al)
The Sora shaman is similarly present, in the sense that she is represented by her rauda-familiar, who likewise intervenes without using her authority to foreclose the discussion. The rauda is a previous shaman, now dead, and it is often possible to detect a continuity between the words of comfort spoken to her clients by the shaman herself before going into trance and those spoken by the rauda on her arrival afterwards. Though the role of shaman is supposedly disinterested, shamans are often deeply involved in the affairs of their clients. One has only to think of Uda in chapter 5, the dead man's brother who leads the grief-stricken Ranatang on to further heights of rage as he incarnates both the boy's dead father and the living Mengalu's confession to his murder by sorcery. And in chapter 7 one can only guess what the old shaman Rondang is feeling as she acts out the nastiness of the youth who has joined her beloved only child Rumbana in suicide, and as her characters frustrate the living Sindi with their unfavourable view of where Rumbana's inheritance is heading. However, to the extent that the Sora shaman can be compared to Dostoyevsky as an author of autonomous creatures, her situation is far more complex.



252 Dialog ues with the dead
Dostoyevsky works primarily in space, ra the r tha n in time: his mode was ' not evolution, but coexistence and interaction '; he had a ' passion for ma ss sce nes' because of hi s impulse to 'concentrate in a single moment the greates t possible qualitative diversity ' . Hence, at such key moments, his drama s unfold with a 'ca ta strophic swi ftness of action ' (Bakhtin 1984 [1929]: 28- 9) . Sora dialogue does not work by means of such decisive moments and denouements, but through reiteration and a form of chan ge which is hesitant and partially reversible. Yet in fa ct it moves forward in a way which Dostoyevsky does not: ' none of[Dostoyevsky's] contradiction s ... ever became dialectical, they were never set in motion along a tempora l path or an evolving sequence' (Bakhtin 1984 [1 929] : 30) . However, this is precisely what does happen with the shaman. She does not , of course, resolve proble ms of the world in a general or existential sense. Indeed, the Sora concept of 'contagion' and of the passing on by the dead of their unhappy experiences, shows a perception that each particular resolution is bought only at the price of other, subsequent unhappiness elsewhere. The difference in the shaman's position in time is related to the contrast between her medium and that of the novelist. However open an author's dialogues may be, the reader will nonetheless reach the last page of the book. The author himself dies and to say that his characters live on in some sense is not to equate them with the Sora dead. The characters in a shaman's dialogue will outlive her more literally because they are not fictional , but real people. Moreover, the living half of these are still able to speak for themselves through their own mouths. As if that were not enough, the separation of the divination and funeral traditions ensures that the same dead person must speak on various occasions through several different shamans. We have heard Panderi speak twice through Rijanti at rival inquests and again through Rondang at a healing rite. The verdict on 1amano's death was developed in two stages through the mouths of the funeral shamans Kumbri and Uda respectively; the terms on which he will attack in the future will become known through yet other shamans of the divination-and-healing traditions, of whom there are several likely to act as his mouthpiece. Similarly, each of the dead persons who speak through Rondang at the healing in chapter 7, is currently somewhere on a trajectory which began with a verdict through a funeral shaman and which may be reinforced or modified at everyone of their appearances through Rondang and the many other divination shamans inside the village and maybe beyond. Here one can see the ground of the difference between the novelist and the shaman. Like Lunacharsky and other Soviet critics, Bakhtin relates the
Dialog ues with th e self"? 253
new-found polyphony of Dostoyevsky to th e contradiction s of ca pi ta li sm, especia lly in Ru ss ia where it 'se t in a lmost ca tas trophicall y . .. upon a n untouched multitude of diverse world s a nd socia l groups whi ch had not been wea kened in their individual isolation , as in the Wes t, by [its] gradual encroachment' . (Bakhtin 1984 [1929]: 20). T he position s, th a t is, whi ch a re embodi ed in Dostoyevsky 's characters are ultimately ideological ones. It is true that the struggles we see in Sora di a logues are not simply betwee n person s, but also between positions and sometimes prin ciples . Thi s view is supported by the formul aic sun g debates whi ch pa ra llel the most important of the dialogues . But what kind of positions are these? The politi cal e nvironment of the Sora is full of conflicts, especially in their relation to the state and the other ethnic groups who at times seem to be its allies or agents. But these positions do not become voices in the dialogue which the Sora hold with their dead . Ra ther , through the shaman s' high-caste familiars, ethnic struggle provides a means which ena bles a very intimate dialogue to take place. The Sora lineage system, procedures of inheritance and sense of personhood are all relatively uncodified a nd provisional. Without case-law and precedent, the way to judge who a re Rumbana 's appropriate heirs or to assess the validity ofPanderi's marriage is to try to persuade these dead persons themselves to support one's own view of the matter: the disposition of their property is related to the resolution of ambiguities in their feelings of attachment to other persons. Yet the forms of Sora consensus show that to contest another person's position is not to dispute that person's sociological or metaphysical presuppositions. The struggles in Sora dialogues are not between ideologies but between persons, cast at least partly as litigants. So if the Sora dead are fictions at all, they are the negotiated and shifting joint fictions of many authors. There are the various living interlocutors, coming together in different combinations and all urging their own viewpoints upon the dead and upon each other. The dead in turn appear to give concordant or discordant responses. What an observer may be inclined to call cases, are merely episodes or moments in the lives of everyone concerned. These bear upon each other either through direct causality or else opportunistically through various relationships of implication and analogy, as in the subordina tion of Palda's affairs and those of his entire family to the exigencies of Rumbana's. But in this respect , the dead are perhaps not much more of a fiction than the living. It might be truer to the Sora's own experience to say that their society makes demands to a greater or lesser extent upon the dramatic creativity and interpersonal alertness of everyone. All persons are both self-authoring and authors of



254 Dialogues with th e dead
each other's lives. The shamans and their raudas may have their own interests, but the widely dispersed process of reaching consensus diffuses authority to the point where the verdicts of dialogues are ultimately au thorless. It is surely this fact which allows the livin g to speak with the dead so easily and in the same kind of ordinary prose which they use with each other. It is perhaps for this rea so n too that the ' objective' existence of Memories depends so little on any representation in the restricted world of material objects. Thus the psychoanalyst Volkan, following Winnicott's discussion of children's teddy bea rs and blankets (Winnicott 1980b), describes what he calls 'linking objects' (e.g. stones, personal fetishes, talismans) in the context of mourning:
[The mourner] invests certain inanimate objects of his own selection with magical qualities. Such ' linking objects' furnish an external locus at which the selfrepresentation can meet with the representation of the lost object [in a form of communication over which the mourner] feels himself to have absolute control. (Volkan 1981: 84--5, cf. 20,106)
Certainly, living Sora do use material objects, such as trees and rocks, memorial stones and wall-paintings, to represent their dead . The dead, in turn , show a great desire to wear their old clothes and jewellery or to handle their old tools. However, the communion between living and dead Sora moves very rapidly from this towards a non-material kind of exteriority. In the Christian and in many other traditions, the upright gravestone with its label is a longstanding focal objectification of the deceased. But for all the attention which it receives at the time, the stone planted at a Sora funeral is a more short-term objectification . It is bunched up against many other similar stones and I found again and again that after a few years, nobody remembers which is which. A psychoanalyst's mourner cannot let go of an object so easily because the consensual world which he inhabits gives little or no validation to any non-material representation: since the latter cannot be pointed to, it is that much harder to insist to others that it exists. But the Sora dead have their existence among the living not so much in material objects but as speakers. The particularity of any material representation of them is lost long before their particularity in speech . Volkan does also identify non-material exterior links, such as a song (Volkan 1981: 106, though he discusses these only briefly). These he calls 'linking phenomena' and they function like a non-material counterpart to his linking objects. It is the fact that one can recognise phenomena like this which enabled me in chapter 8 to gloss the term sonum as 'a Memory', But if what the Sora are doing is using 'linking phenomena', then they are doing
Dialogues Il'ith the self'? 255
so to a deg ree far beyond anything Volkan suggests. Where does th e Sora linkin g phenomenon end: at the autonomous, sentient Memory, who without being a physical obj ect is nonetheless objectively rea l? Or perhaps a t the act of holding a dialogue with tha t Memory? The So ra experience of illness itse lf seems like a linkin g phenomenon , as too does the expe ri ence (which after chapter 8 must be ca lled a passion rather than a n act) of dying itself. These seem more than simply ' linking phenomena' and more like constituents of a total linking, and linked , universe. There is thus a unity between realm s of discourse which in the world-view of industrial society are not easily reconciled. For instance, the 'social sciences' are bedevilled with the incompatibility between the sociological explanation of a phenomenon and its explanation in terms of individual psychology . The material which has been presented suggests strongly that the sociological and psychological aspects of the Sora interpretation of a death, the realms of material inheritance and of emotion, run so closely in parallel as to be indistinguishable. Schieffelin has observed that for the Kaluli of New Guinea , one laments the dead partly in terms of what they would have done for one if they had still been alive. But '[w]here human relationships are stated so strongly in terms of material reciprocity, [they] are not so morally dissociated as they are in the West ... and to state one's desires in terms of sentiment is not the hypocrisy it would be for us' (Schieffelin 1976: 150). Similarly, though in their own language the Sora ' think', 'feel' and 'know' (respectively ogandi-. 1111- and galam-), nevertheless what we call 'intellect', 'emotion' and 'cognition' are for them not necessarily distinct experiential or epistemological realms. In this sense Sora epistemology appears less compartmentalised than some others: the realms which in the West are called theology, aesthetics, psychology, sociology, politics, medicine and law are articulated and regulated in large part tlU'ough the medium of dialogues with sonums, or 'Memories'. Sonums present an interpretative problem for anthropological analysis precisely because for so many questions the Sora regard them as a solution. This entire book can be seen as an extended gloss on the word 'sonum'. Sonums have their own 'logic' which I have tried to tease out. But I have also tried, however inadequately, to enable the reader to imagine what it may be like to feel as a Sora does. I have tried to look beyond the idea of a 'translation of culture', based as it is on analysing categories and concepts, towards what may perhaps be called a 'trans-sentience'. Feeling and thinking are closely, but mysteriously, intertwined . As Michelle Rosaldo put it, ', .. feeling is forever given shape through thought and ... thought is laden with emotional meaning'. (1984: 143). They are not



256 Dialog ues Ivi/h the dead
opposed to each other: rather, emotions can be seen as 'cognitions implicating the immediate, carnal " me" - as thou ghts embodied ' (M. Z . Rosaldo 1984: 138). We can interpret Kantino 's rumbling tummy in chapter 4 in these term s: Leopard -Memory is a conceptual category through which K antino can think a bout hi s dea d fath er. Th e symptom of a rumbling tummy is the embodiment of these thou ghts which articulates hi s feelin gs for hi s father and gives them form. My preferred translation of ' Rumble-Tummy-Sonum ' as ' Rumble-Tum my-M emory' , perhaps preserves the sen se tha t thought and feelin g are somehow both at work here . How ca n a n anthropologist or a reader ma ke the move from a gra sp of patterns of thought to the involvement of his or her 'carnal " me" '? A total trans-sentience seems even more unattainable than a perfect tran sla tion . My own involvement as a fieldwork er led me along what are only th e first steps towards what T should like to call a bi-sentience. This path seems analogous to that in the growth of bilingualism , where one starts to think and even to dream in another language but does so patchily and while referring back frequently to one's first language. This leads to a play of true and false parallels between the two languages, of illusions and insights about those languages. So it is with feelings . Sometimes, during absorbing moments in the field, I seemed to forget that I was not a Sora . I took part in work parties, or cooked, drank and gossiped. While staying with a friend whose child was sick I had a dream which allowed my host to diagnose the Memory which was attacking his little girl. In dreams at other times rauda-familiars, lamp in hand , would beckon me to go with them to the Underworld in order to become a shaman: after one of these dreams I even woke up to find that I had sleep-walked and was standing in the darkened street outside the house. In a hazy mixture of good faith and make-believe which suited both me and my hosts, I fasted , sang and danced as Ranatang's Ancestor-Man. But among all the many details of my activity and talk with them, something would soon arise to remind us that I wa s not actually one of them and to emphasise for both of us the sense of my own otherness. I felt this sense most acutely when a Sora friend died and , like everyone else, I was called over to speak with her or him and continue our friendship. For the reader, any degree of trans-sentience must rely on an even more limited fluency in an unfamiliar way of life, with a correspondingly weaker sense of involvement, than it does for the anthropologist. Yet in practice, it can sometimes seem surprisingly strong and direct. Carrithers cites an account by Firth of the actions and words of a group of people who are
Dialogues Il'i/h the self? 257
trying to ca lm a youn g man whom F irth describes as ' hi ghly agita ted ' (F irth 1985: 39) . Carrith ers ex pla ins the easy intelligibility of this pa ssage on the ground s that it
remind[sJ us of other occa sions o n whic h we have met such a pa tt ern , throu gh personal expe ri e nce or throu gh represe nt a ti o ns o f emotion ... Pa R a ngifuri 's tea rs, th e incohe re nce of his word s, and his ge ne ra l demeanour are di stin ct, vi vid , a nd di scriminable from other patterns such as, sa y, ' riotou s jollity'. Moreover, the pa ttern is not merely visual or a uditor y. Other, constitutivel y social compone nts th e co ntrast be l\veen Pa R a ngifuri 's ordinar y gree ting and this ' perfunc tory' one, the soothing ges tures and enquiri es of th e othe r me n - also contribute to th e passage's conse nsibility. (Carrithers 1990: 266)
The example is skilfully chosen, because at this point in Firth 's narration the a nthropologist and the other actors prese nt are as mystified as the reader a bout the causes of the young man's agitation . This allows Carrithers to point out that 'there is something peculiarly pure about our apprehension of Pa Rangifuri's state: along with the other Tikopia then present . .. we can perceive that something has happened and very roughly identify the character of that something' (Carrithers 1990: 267 , italics original). Such patterns, he says, are 'consensible and intelligible' even whjle being 'unique and irreproducible' (Carrithers 1990: 268). I would add that there can be a varying intensity to this 'consensibility', according to what each person brings to the encounter. Trans-sentience does not depend wholly on a translation of terms, concepts and models, or on the explication of their context and mutual relations. It requires that we should position ourselves more or less wholeheartedly somewhere within the arena of translation through a leap of imagination . In doing this we sense an analogy , actual or potential, between another person's situa tion and our own. We find such analogies constantly whenever we empathise with or 'feel for' other people, however partial these analogies may be and however labile our empathy. Thus an English friend , who knew nothing of Sora ethnography, wept when I showed her the dialogue between Rungkudi and her little girl which opens this book. Anyone mjght find that dialogue moving, but the fact that my friend had young children herself, I believe, allowed her to position herself very clearly. This kind of overlap suggests that the imaginative leap we make need not be a disinterested one indeed, it will not be so if that imagination is to have much force to it. My friend's consensibility was a (mercifully) smaller version of the overlap felt by Renato Rosaldo when his wife Michelle was suddenly killed in a fieldwork accident and in his grief he found himself 'repositioned'

(R. Rosaldo 1984: 182) in a way which wa s not just a temporary fea t of the imagination: he now understood the rage felt by bereaved Ilongot men with an intensity of understanding which had previously eluded him. Thi s approach , with its emphasis on relative intensity (in R. Rosaldo , 'force') leads in a different direction from the discussion of terms in different languages for 'love' , 'a nger', and so on .3 Sora talk little a bout feelin gs as noun s, though some such words do exist, e.g. l1I([noien, sin/an , mea ning res pectively ' happiness', 'sorrow'. What in English are word s of feelings, are used most in a verba l form: sin/a/ai, l11oii'i/ai, bambda/illg, l/1a/sida/illg , aY"11/enai, ' I feel sorry, 1 feel happy , I fee l angry, 1 like, I remember'. The reference of these is interpersonal , rather th a n interna l, since they generally take a construction involving a further person or interpersonal situation: sin/a/am , '1 feel sorry for you', ay ll11/al11 , '1 remember you', bal'abda/ing gal11lellden , 'I am angry because ' . So rather than discuss ' love' or 'anger' as such, 1 have followed the Soras' own lead and considered persons as the agents and patients of verbs, who act and suffer in ways which suggest that they are passing through a gamut of different feelings or emotions. Above all , they talk, in a way which confirms unmistakably that for them, feelings are not simply internal states since the feelings of each person implicate many other persons. 1 have presented these verb roots and forms as they succeed each other in a progression across the sweep of time. A person's supposed feelings after his death move from those in which he acts most aggressively, through verbs of diminished aggression and finally to verbs of nurturing and protecting. To the extent that 1 have been obliged in English to talk at all of feelings as nouns, my use of terms like 'mood' or 'state of mind' is intended to suggest that the Sora seem to regard these feelings as fleeting episodes or modes of being. As we have seen, the Sora do not genera lly attach a label to these moods as such. Yet at the same time we can see how M emories (sonums) constitute a key set of nouns in the rhetoric of feeling , a set which is highly elaborated and frequently invoked and which functions in some senses as an alternative vocabulary of feelings . Every category of Memory also implies certain moods associated with emotional attachment. All of these moods belong somewhere within the orbit of the English word 'love' as well as of other, more or less opposed English words like 'hatred', 'resentment' or 'anger'. For the Sora, such moods are not just states but stages in a dynamic sequence. Any given form of Memory presupposes other forms of Memory from which it has arisen or into which it will metamorphose. As forms of Memory flow , change and blur into each other, so in the course of their dialogues the living and the dead echo,
Dialogues IPi/h the self? 259
reciprocate and modify each others' feelings. T he di scussions of how a livin g person' s biography evo lves through his illnesses (chapter 4), or of the relationship between memory and what I have ca lled Memory (chapter 8), ex plore the nature of the traces which these feelin gs lea ve. T hese traces can be cumul ative: they change the person who feels them and ultimately
perha ps even const itu te that person. If the interpreta tion of dialogue offered in this book is co nvincin g, this should not be taken as an elega nt achi evement of the anthropo logist, nor eve n of the shamans through whom the dialogues pa ss. Rather, it revea ls a who le way of being human in the company of other humans, all of whom are creatures of time. For a deceased person in the West today who is mourned by more than one rememberer, there is comparatively little provision for the mutual interplay of their memories of him . In the case ofa psychoanalyst' s or psychotherapist's patient there may be none at all, whi le for members of a religious congrega tion there may be rather more , thou gh only so far as they are encouraged to talk about the dead on limited occasions. By contrast, each Sora who dies becomes yet another Memory , common to many . If figure 10. 1were to reflect the full scope of this, it would show numerous living rememberers linked in simi lar ways with the same dead person, while each rememberer would be similarly linked to numerous dead people. The rememberers are at the same time witnessing and being affected by the details of each other's relationship to that dead person. The dead, similarly, have their own mutual relationships. Every Sora Memory is thus one node in an endlessly extendible social web which encompasses both the living and the dead . The patterning of this web is continually carried forward and reproduced with the flow of time, while the potential existence of each node pre-exists the dea th of the person around whom it will grow. This is implicit in the Soras' awareness of their own mortality as they talk , whether seriously or banteringly, about the future continuation of their relationships once some of the present company have died ('Will you give me a decent buffalo at my stoneplanting when I'm dead?') . In this book I have tried to show that it is the autonomous and publicly shared nature of sonums which informs both Sora society and the Sora person's awareness of who he or she is within that society . Dialogues with the dead are not about death , but about life: it is only by having a vision of what it is to be dead , that one can have an understanding of what it is to be alive.



Appendix 1
List of sonums recorded in Alinsing (excluding 'Ancestor', idai)
Categories given here were recorded in Alinsing village. In the terminology of chapter 4, the main headings numbered from I to 7 are residential Experiences which cause death and then store their victims in sites on the landscape. The sonums listed under each of these headings are their sub-Experiences which cause illness but do not in themselves cause death or store victims (though in usage these names sometimes serve as synonyms for the main categories under which I have grouped them). The main Experiences remain constant throughout the area studied by me, though other villages would give a slightly different repertoire of sub-Experiences. A discussion of the symptoms associated with each of these categories would make this appendix unnecessarily long and complex.

Notes
Preface I More complicated, a nd perhaps not essential for th e rea der to remember, is th e fact that in certain cases wbere two different consonants meet side by side, th e first is pronounced almost as a glottal stop. Thus Kidlllllg, a kind of creator-being and village guardian, is pronounced more like Ki'llIlIg; garoj lid, 'there's no embarrassment' , is pronounced garoi' lid. Unless other forms of the word reveal it, I am not always confident tbat I can reconstruct the missing consonant and so have sometimes left these glottal stops as they so und .

2 The Sora people Tbe 1981 census gives slightly disparate figures for the Sora as follows: for Orissa , 370,060 (Census ofIndia [1988] : 40) or 360,229 (Census of India [1988] : 859); for Andhra Pradesh, 82,10 I (Census ofIndia (1989]: 24) or 81,849 (Census o fIndia (1989]: 820). Very small numbers are recorded in some other states. In the 1971 census, the totals were for Orissa , 342,757 (Raza and Ahmad 1990: 80) and for Andbra Prades h, 8 1,227 (Raza and Ahmad 1990: 75) . 2 Ramamurti , a Hindu scboolteacber in Pa rlakimidi and th e fatber of Sitapati , prepared a manual (1931) and two dictionaries (1933 , 1938) of the Sora language. During the 1960s and 1970s, Zide and his students studied Sora philology a nd syntax (Biligiri 1965; Stampe 1965- 6; Starosta 1967; Zide and Zide 1973 ; see also some papers in Jenner, Thompson and St a rost a 1976), while I began an examination of Sora semantics and poetics (Vitebsky 1978c). There have been several short notes on the Sora by administrators, missioilaries and visitors during the course of tbis century but the only other works of any substance known to me but not discussed in the present chapter are Petit's thesis (1974) describing Sora material culture and Singh's book (1984), based on his experience as Commissioner for Tribal Welfare in Orissa, on the politics of leadership.

3 Fo r some views of the relat ionships betwee n 'tribal' a nd 'Hindu' , see Bailey 1957, 1959, 1960, 196 1; D umont 1962; Ga rdn er 1982; Sinh a 1962. 4 Among 'co usin s' , tb e Sora distingui sh members of one's ow n lineage from members of other lineages. To take my own generation as the simples t example, my father's brother's child is my ' bro tb er' o r 'sister' . But my fath er's sister has married out into a nother lineage and her children will be members o f that lineage . Similarly, the children of my mother's brother co ntinue to be members o f th e lineage into which she was originally born. All these people a re my l1Iarollgger (male) or lIIarollse! (female). Since we are descended from siblin gs of opposite sexes, this usage co rresponds to the E nglish 'cross-cousin'. The term s lIIarollgger and lIIarollse! a lso cove r the child of my mother's sister, since (unless the two women have ma rri ed into the sa me lineage) this person, too, is a member of a nother lineage . Thus lIIarollgger a nd lIIarollse! are used to cove r a wider field than 'cross-co usin ', since they include what anthropologists sometimes pondero usly call the 'matrilateral para llel cousi n' . These cousin rela ti o nships generally continue down to the third generation. Though, as we shall see, there is a tension between conflicting patterns of behaviour, marria ge and sexual rel a tionships between the cross-cousin kind s of lIIarollgger and marollse! are widely forbidden or discouraged . Relatio ns with the mother's sister's child a re always forbidd e n. All these cousins can a lso be addressed as ' brother' and 'sister'. Throughout most of this book, howeve r, I shall use not the Sora , but the English term 'cross-cousin' wherever this applies. This is because any discussion of cousins largely centres around tensions between a woma n's relationship with her brothers on the one hand , and with her husband on tbe other. 5 Though Elwin was fluent in some India n languages, he did not claim to know Sora more than slighlly. According to the Sora themselves, he worked through interpreters who translated from Sora, Ilia Oriya , to Hindi. 6 Sora in the Puttasing area use a kinship terminology of an essentially ' north India n' type (cf. Chaussin 1978; the terms given in Karve 1968: 424-31 are improba ble) . This is similar in its essentia ls to Oriya or Bengali (Inden a nd Nicholas 1977) in its use of uncle and a unt terms a nd its presupposition that cross-cousin marriage is not practised ; while Suryanarayana's thesis (1977) on kinship a nd marriage among non-Lanjia Sora in the plains of Andhra Pradesh presents a 'south Indian ' system in whic h the terms are not so different but a re arranged so as to support this practice. We shall see in chapter 3 that the La njia Sora play with both these possibilities. Cross-cousin marriage is seen as a privilege, bordering on brother-sister incest, which living Sora mostly fore go but which is common a mong Telugu a nd Oriya high castes as well as among Sora shamans in the Underworld . ·
7 Apart from th~ small kitchen gardens (kolla) immediatefy outside the house, the Sora classify la nd into two ma in categories . One is ba/'llll ('hill', 'slope'), a clea ring in ' fores t' (l1I!ab) of the sort called in English slash-and-burn , shifting cultivation or short-allow (for technical agricultural aspects in various parts of Asia, see e.g. Ruthenberg 1980; Spencer 1966; Conklin 1957, 1963; Vitebsky 1984, 1992; Hagen 1987). Each household clears the trees a nd bushes on a site, burns th em and sows seeds as the rains begin. This is moslly worked by exchange la bour

between house holds a nd is essentially a subsistence agri culture, producing mille t grains with little or no surplus (see Vitebsky 1978a, 1978 b). The other kind of land is saroball , ' pad d y-land ', so metimes strea m-fed but usua ll y rain-fed. This is the form ofland which can yield substantial surpluses . W ea lthier house holds thus have rice as th eir sta ple diet, while the selling or lending of surplus padd y both a mon g Soras an d to th e outside world is probably the bigges t single econo mi c activity.
The supposed ownership of permanent paddy-la nd is lega lly recog ni sed and entered in the Revenue Department's Reco rd of Rights; a n annual tax ('cist') is due on these to th e gove rnment. While an a verage village will contain no more th a n a max imum of 300 ac res of paddy fields, th ere may be as much as 2,000 to 3,000 acres of fores t whic h a re subject to shifting cultivation, of which at a nyo ne time a large proportion is not being c ultiva ted but is lying fallow. All fores t is legally owned by the go vernment, so that all shiftin g cultivation is considered a n illegal encroachment. Howeve r, des pite th e occasional punitive fines a nd increasing general official pressure, the Sora consider shifting cultivation to be indispensable on ideological , recreational, dietetic and economic grounds, so that I do not know of a single household, however wealthy, which does not practise it extensively, while the many poorer households depend on it entirely. 8 The alill (fishtail palm) dries up during the hot seaso n a nd the monsoon which follows. Its place as a source of alcohol is taken by the aba (mohua, Madhllca illdica), the fleshy flowe rs of which drop from their trees during the hot season and are distilled into a spirit which warms the body during the chilly rains. The drink provided by these two trees is an essential part of the daily diet, of social gatherings and of almost all offerings to sonums. Sora conviviality takes for granted a plentiful supply of drink a nd this will often be emphasised in future chapters . Milk is never drunk and water rarely, except as the juice of boiled gruel. As the word 'gruel' would suggest, Sora food is bland . The staple diet consists of millet or, for wealthier people, rice, boiled into this watery, unspiced gruel and eaten with only salt and sometimes chillies. Meat is likewise boiled without seasoning. Other methods of cooking, including the oil-based techniques like frying common elsewhere in India , are not used . 9 As in much of south Asia, 'Where are you going?' is not an innocent request for information. It may sometimes be as bland as the English question ' How are you?' On the other hand, it may engage the other person and draw the encounter into quite different areas. I carried my child on a Buddhist pilgrimage one full-moon night up Adam's Peak in Sri La nka. The steep stone steps up the mountain led to only one place: the summit. Nevertheless, every pilgrim who passed us coming down , as ked one after another 'Where are you going?' For a subtle and amusing discussion of the implications of this question in a T a mil village setting, see Daniel 1984: 64-7 . In Soraland, this is only one of several possible opening remarks: 'Sukka po?', 'Are you well?' (reply: 'SlIkka' , 'well' or 'ASII', 'ill'); 'Lemlam' , 'I regard/ respect you' (reply: ' Lemlam'); or with strangers, 'Wall a gO/jallg 1I(//11?', 'What's your village?' (reply: the village name, or if the other person is attractive, maybe a made-up village name with a suggestive etymology, like Tulemba, which sounds close to 'Let's have sex').

3 The formation of the Sora person Lineages do not ha ve surn a mes, thou gh for th eir dea lings with the administration Sora may adopt titles like 'Head man ' (Gomango, the Oriya form of Gomang) or 'Pries t' (Buya) if these heredit a ry offices a re held within their lineage, otherwise simply 'Sora' . A n ild a sonum ca n in sist thro ugh a sham a n that a baby take th e so num's own Oriya -slyle name. I was a lso told during my brief return visit to Soraland in 1984 that , although I was presumed to be still alive, several babies had bee n named in memory of me since I had left in 1979.
4 Interpreting and persuading the dead I There is ev idence to suggest that villages ma y originally have co nta ined only one lineage. The funera l shaman acts for a n entire village, yet at the sa me time her cross-cousin marri age in the Underworld sugges ts a n exclusive re lationship with her na tal lineage. Similarly, at the karja, the Ancestor-Men of all the lineages, who act sepa rat ely for other stages of th e fun e ra l sequence, are pooled a nd one bereaved house is chosen as the setting for th e entire proceedings (see chapter 9). If this interpreta tion is correct, then the m os t likely ori ginal settlers of the village site are the Buya lineage, who tend the village Kidtung sonum in seasonal growth a nd harvest rites (abdllr) at a site called j ellallg-Io (probably meaning 'Earthbone-place') . 2 Though I am not trained in medicine my assessment is based on the following: avid reading while in the field of Mallsoll 's Tropical Diseases (Manson-Bahr 1972, latest edition 1982); accompanying ma ny sick Soras to hospitals in towns and interpreting for them; and my own experience of contracting many of the conditions named and spending a long time in hospital myself. 3 What could be taken as the literal translation of ' healing', ab-sllka-, 'cause to be healthy', is used only of the rite to reintegra te shamans, Ancestor-Men and Ancestor-Women among the living after they have 'become' the dead Ancestors during their duties at a funeral. 4 These doublets were called ' tag-words' by R amamurti (1931) . There have been studies of comparable 'echo' words in Gta' (Mahapatra 1976; Zide 1976) and of parallelism in traditional Munda ri poetry (Munda 1976) which between them pose but lea ve unanswered the ques tion of whether this is a phenomenon native to the Munda language family , or something characteristic of much ofIndia a nd embracing Dravidian and Indo-Aryan la nguages as well (Zide 1976: 1335; M a hapatra 1976: 830; cf. Trawick 1990: 245). A similar pattern is also widespread in the islands of southeast Asia (Fox 1974; Fox 1988; M etcalf 1989; some literature on a similar phenomenon in other parts of the world is summarised in Jakobson 1966). I have discussed the structure and semantics of this Sora speech pattern in detail elsewhere (Vitebsky 1978c). In other ways, too, the material presented in later chapters will suggest that it is a characteristic pattern in Sora thinking to bundle elements together as synonyms at one time and at others to separate them by discursive means. For example, paired aspects of Sun-Sonum appear synonymous when listed in invocations but are discriminated in myth in terms of kinship or political hierarchy, or in illness in terms of symptom. In the same way, the various Earth-Sonums associated with different branches of a lineage are treated as synonymous when the emphasis is



268 NO les 10 pages 9/- 13 7
on th e lineage's unity a nd as opposed wh en it is on th e lineage's fragmentation (chapters 6, 9). 5 In each couplet , only ce rtain e lemen ts a re paired in this way, while th eir surroundin g fram ewo rk ('clasping', 'grandmothers', 'four-foot ed walk ') is held co nstant a nd unchan ged . Each of th e two elements to the pairs brin gs with it its own se mantic fie ld . Whe n the elements are considered se parately, they offer a co ntrast: hand s are difrerent from , even opposite to, feet; monkeys are di stin ct from apes. But the fact that they are now juxtaposed also invites us to see their similarity, to see them as two limbs or two simians. The po int now is not to di stin gui sh eac h of th e two from each other, but to recognise that simians can climb down to the Underworld , a nd that to do so they hold on to each other hand and foot in a chain which represe nts the unbroken continuity of shamanic succession . In a study of Chinese poetry, Boodberg (1954) called this a 'binocular vision, the superimposition of two sy nta ctical images in order to endow them with so lidity and depth ' (cited in Ja kobso n 1966: 402 and Fox 1974: 482; I have not seen this work). But as I a rgue here, this quality is bought at the price of th e se mantic fre edo m of each element taken separately.
6 Redeeming the dead and protecting the living I Earth-Sonum is a lso a common verdict on those who die in old age without dramatic symptoms . Here, it is considered the most benign possible form of death , suggesting a fulfi lled life (in contrast to a ll ot her Experiences , but particularly the sudden, premature death of a Sun-victim). Those who die by the action of Earth-Sonum receive a full funeral, including redemption songs with appropriate wording. I interpret this as meaning that Earth is not yet a happy loca ti on because one's membership of it is based primarily on a form ofsufrering and death, rather than on the transformation of these. Hence the imagery of rescue, wandering and banishing rites remains the same. However, Sora say that this transforma tion is a relatively easy one, meaning I think that the distance is not great between Ea rth as an Experience and Earth as redemption from Experience. 2 Unlike children who die in infancy or before birth , adult Sun-victims were perhaps fully separated from their mothers but somehow faultily cast and forged. This may be obvious early on, as with crippling; or it may be revealed on ly later in sudden deaths, by the rapid dissolution of their form . I have examined the logic of this imagery elsewhere (Vitebsky 1980) and shall here do no more than summarise. Blacksmiths are associated with the very process of metalworking and are conventionally expected to be lame (lablab), imbecile or otherwise defective, as in Sun-Woma n's blacksmith slaves 'Dumb-Sun' (Mo '1/10 '-Yllllg) and ' Moron-Sun ' (Kika-yullg). Though there are a few Sora blacksmiths, the majority belong to a low Hindu caste ca lled Gansi who visit Sora territory and are considered unclean, dangerous sorcerers (cf. chapter 7, sonum No. 15, lines 247- 50). For suicides (which are without exception by ha nging) and those who die in falls (the majority of accidenta l deaths) , the rope or tree involved is said to bridge the gulf, which is otherwise 'pathless' (ka'ja) , between earth and sky. In addition, for murders and those accidents where blood is actually shed , it is said th at the sudden loss of blood releases the soul so th a t it 'ca nnot find the way' to
+

th e Underworld but in stead ri ses to th e Sun ' like smoke' . (It is to avo id a simila r dispersal of the sou l th a t sac rifi cia l a nimals a re kill ed by a blow on th e head before the throat ca n be slit: the blood should not be released while the animal is a live, otherwi se 'we ca n' t send its soul' to the relevant sonum. This is a lso the reason why wild a nim a ls a re not general ly ofrered to so nums, since they ca nn ot be killed without wounding th em: exceptionally, wh ere a wi ld peacock is ofrered as a sy mbol of roy a l stat us to the dead at the kwja or to the Hindu sma llpox goddess in a seaso nal blocking rite aga inst epidemics, it is chased to ex haustion across the mountains a nd then hit on the he ad with a special club.) As a fin a l jud gment on a pe rso n's life-s tor y, a pos t-mort em Sun verdict is a decidedly nega tive one. This is clea res t in th e case of suicid e, whic h is ge nerally motivated by embarrassment over public knowledge of one's own misdemeanour o r humiliation (usually sex ua l): in line 192 of chapter 7, the moth e r of an unpleasant youth who comm itted sui cide for just this reaso n, ta unts him with th e questions 'Are you telling yourself you just died of Ra ' tud-SonumT But whatever the reasons , a ll Sun-deaths are highly contagious. As with any other Ex peri ence, the redemption fails at first and th e formle ss (ka'ja) blood (mil/am) ro a ms at large seeking persons to invade . When it does enter someone, it causes raging fits (siam) a s well as a predi sposition to a similar death (cf. the end of chapter 3). The precise terms in whic h the Sora ta lk about this will emerge in deta il in chapter 7 (sonums Nos. 10 and II , lines 158- 2 16). As outer limits, Sun and Earth are the poles of the enti re cosmology, encompassing all other Experiences. The following table summarises the main properties or associations of the sonums of Sun a nd Earth, many of which are referred to elsewhere in the text:

8 Memories and rememberers: states of mind among the dead and the living I A-jlllll-illg-te is an alternative form to jlllll-/-ing, ' he/she/ it ate me' . 2 Linguists have been wary of identifying a passive in Sora. Ramamurti dismissed it in a few words, writing, '[t]here are only two voices - active and middle. There is no passive voice in So:ra: [sic].' (1931 : 26; see also his footnote on tha t page). Pinnow (1966), using only Ramamurti as his source, writes as if there were no passive either in form or in function. Biligiri (1965), though he nowhere mentions the word 'passive', nevertheless translates the form in -ing like a passive, in this case blb-/-ing (in his orthography blb-/-ili) , from blb-, 'submerge', here translated as 'I was drowned' . For a fuller discussion of this, see Vitebsky 1982: 240-2 . 3 The full paradigm of such verbs runs as follows: optional initial root presentpronoun of prefix, also tense agent indicating marker agent

Notes to page 206 27 1
The initi a l sepa ra te pronoun o f th e agent is ge ne ra lly omitted unl ess required for empha sis, so th a t if no noun is used to indica te the age nt , th e end ing o r co nt ex t must suffi ce to make clea r who this is. Whe n the patient o f the verb is a noun , this may either be separate (Sl '/Ilgell YIIIl-I-ai, ' I th a tch the ho use', or else infi xed (YIlII-slIlg-l -ai , 1 thatc h-house') . So lon g as noun s a re used for both agent and patient, th ere is no amb iguity. But where th e ve rb links two pronouns, not both of which are in all cases expressed, thi s gives ri se to two kind s of paradigm. The fir st shows a co nstant pa tient with a changing agen t, while th e second keeps the agent constant and changes the pa tient.
Constant patient, changing agent
(alllell) jlllll-I-illg you (singul a r) eat me ( al1ill ) jlllll -I-illg he eats me
( Oll1bell ) O~illlll- I- illg you (plural) ea t me (//lill~ii jlllll -I-illg-ji th ey ea t me
Constant agent, changing patient
(all ill) jlllll-I-illg he (she, it) eats me jum-I-{//Il he eats you (singula r) jlllll-I-e he eats him (her, it) jUIl1-I-ai he eats us (including listener) jlllll-I-e/ell he eats us (excluding listener) jUIl7-I-ebell he eats you (plural) jUln-l-e~ii he ea ts them
It will be remarked that without additional freestanding (and usually omitted) pronouns it is not always possible to express both agent and patient unambiguously: for example,jllll1-l-illg can mean 'you (singular) are eating me' or ' he/ she/it is eating me '. Sometimes both of these can be expressed, but only where suitable markers exist and can be combined (very few such combinations are possible).
Some forms combining both agent and patient markers
(NB Agent markers are in plain type, patient markers in bold) (Iiell) jUII1-I-ai-ji I eat them (allin-ji) jUII7-I-i"g-ji they eat me (all/ell) a-jllll7-l-ai-ji we eat them
(anin-ji) jllll1-l-elell-ji they eat us (excluding listener) (all1en/allill) jlllll-I-illg you (singular)/ he/she/ it eats me
In the first and third of these examples, the suffix of third-person plurality -ji refers to the patient, in the second and fourth example, to the agent. Where ma rkers cannot be combined, as in the fifth example, the patient will always be expressed even at the price of suppressing the agent. So where the agent is in the third person but is not made explicit by either the context or a noun, this can lead to a complete anonymity of the agent and thereby into the passive: it is only one step from (allin)jllll1-l-illg, 'he eats me', tojul1I-l-illg, 'I am eaten'. I shall show at the end of this chapter how divination for sickness starts from the point of view of the patient and moves towards revealing this anonymous agent.

4 See previous footnote 5 Some roots for sema ntic reaso ns have no ex tern al predicate at all and are used only in this middle voice, e.g. Ila-l -ellai, ' I walk', th a t is, verbs of bodily ac tion whic h unlike full y active intransitive verbs such as 'go' do not necessarily require a construction of destina tion (since they emp hasise the action rather than the goal). But most are words which also bave meanings in tb e active. 6 Starosta appears to bave tbis property in mind when he uses th e term 'bitransitive' (as opposed to his 'monotransitive', i. e. my 'active') and says:
the -n- suffi x which is co nsidered the phonological rea lisation of this ca tegory , co uld be considered the re mn a nt of some dummy object, which , a lthough it would have no mea ning of it s own, would nevertheless fill a (VP, Adv) slot , exp la inin g it s intra nsitivi sin g effect (Starosta 1967 : 133). 7 The breakdown of a-b-iilll1-f-e-ll-ai is as follows : {JIIIIII , 'name'; -b-, causative infix ; -f-, prese nt-te nse marker; -e-, for euphony; - 11- , middl e voice marker; -a i, first person age nt T. 8 The following are some additional characteristic words in th e vocabulary used for some of these stages:

9 Forgetting the dead It may be that the relationship betwee n the ca tegories of Eart h and Ancestor has changed (neither Elwin nor Sitapat i di scusses this relationship a t a ll. Few serious attempts have bee n made to study the long-te rm history of shifting cultivation in Indi a: a notable exception is Pratap 1987). Under the conditions which I obser ved , the acu te shorta ge of land now, co upl ed with the absence of any form of official land registration which corres ponded to how land was act ua ll y used, may have encouraged the stock piling of Memories as title-deeds . On th e other han d , the demographic inev itability that th e role of an Earth site must decline for reaso ns of lineage evo lution, is accelerated by ex ternal factors in the state of th e land marke t. Theoretically a given site can be subdivided indefinit ely among heirs, but in pract ice, especially on uneven terrain , it will not tolerate much fragmentation. As we have seen, a household 's association with a site can be eithe r throu gh permanent paddy-fields which are watered from it or throu gh surroundin g shifting-c ultivation sites, eve n thou gh these do not use th e water for irriga tion . Though the government recognises ri ghts only to paddy-fi eld s, the Sora also recognise rights of ownership or usufruct to shifting-cultivation plots, rights which vary from village to village according to local pressure on land . They realise that continued fragment a tion of both kinds of plot is wasteful a nd inconvenient and continually attempt to rationalise their holdings by buying and selling. In addition the generally low margin of surplus means that most households are very vulnerable to vagaries of demography, climate or health. Both to pay for sacrificial buffalos and as a legacy from bad periods they are enmeshed in various forms of long-term debt to each other, to Oriya Panos, and increasingly to money-lenders of the Telugu-spea king Komiti caste in the towns (Vitebsky 1978a, 1978b). Though legally no non-Soras are allowed to buy land in the area, in practice much paddy-land is effectively owned by outside moneylenders through mortgage arrangements which do not show up on paper and are impossible to redeem. Thus rights to land change hands frequently, voluntarily or through fraud, in a variety of forms of outright sale, mortgaging and share-cropping. 2 I saw this festival over several years, each year in several different villages. Specific details can be highly variable . For example, in one village the ladder is replaced by a thread tied from the roof and hanging down to the mortar beneath. The ladder's destruction with an axe is paralleled by the setting alight of the thread so that it burns from the bottom upwards .
10 Dialogues with the self? Sora bereavement and the presuppositions of contemporary psychotherapy It seems tha t we can point to moments in other societies, too, when mourning behaviour apparently becomes less 'adaptive'. Geertz (1959) gives a vivid account of the emotional confusion of the mourners a t a funeral of a child in Java when a breakdown occurred in the expected structure of the proceedings because somebody was trying, for political reasons, to modernise the style. 2 Jung is entirely absent from the index and the bibliography of, for example, Worden 1982, Volkan 1981, Bowlby 1980 and Bollas 1987 (incidentally, the title of Bollas' book, The shadow 0/ fh e objecf, is taken from page 249 of Freud's Molll'lling and melancholia). Jung's archetypes could of course offer a distinctive

and fruitful way of thinking about Sora son ums o r Memories, especially the Experiences. 3 Certa in la nguages a nd th e contexts of their usage may e nco ura ge an acco unt of feeling whic h hove rs around nouns and continually comes back to res t on th em. Margaret Trawick's recen t book, Notes on love in a Tamilfalllily (1990), weaves a subtle web around cr ucia l, overlapping nouns in Tam il a nd Engli sh: 'My idea of love a nd their idea of a npu took deceptively simil a r forms ... I thou ght that th ey loved me. They thought that I felt a npu towards them' (Trawick 1990: 92). Though she focusses on nouns, she seems close to my own position when she writes of 'c ulture ... as an activity . . . done among people, leaving its traces in memory ... [W1h a t is most important is not what we or others are, but what happens between us ... ' (Trawick 1990: 89- 90) .
