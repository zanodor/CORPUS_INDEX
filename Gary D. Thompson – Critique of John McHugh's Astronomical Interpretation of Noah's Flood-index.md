Critique of John McHugh's Astronomical Interpretation of
Noah's FloodIntroduction
During 2000 there was world-wide interest in the ideas of
John J. McHugh that the Biblical flood story is traceable to
the astronomical mythology of the ancient Sumerians i.e., to
the story of the "Sumerian Noah" Ut-napishtim. Mainstream
media carried news items concerning such and the idea was
also discussed on various internet discussion groups. There
were too many problems with the thesis for it to be taken
seriously.
(1) Background - The Source:
The source of the "Noah's Flood" hype was the Master of
Science dissertation completed by McHugh in 1999, for the
Department of Anthropology, Brigham Young University. The
dissertation title is TheDeluge:AMythicalStorythatwas
ProjectedontotheConstellations, and the dissertation is
some 180 pages long. The Harold B. Library catalogue at
Brigham Young University can be accessed at
http://www.lib.byu.edu/byline/ and the Call Number for the
dissertation is XX(2675993.2). As far as I am aware the actual
dissertation has never been made readily available via the
internet. Also, as far as I am aware a projected future
publication by John McHugh never appeared. Circa 2000,
McHugh took part in a NPR radio Program in which he was
guested opposite Ed. Krupp (Griffith Observatory).



(2) Background - John McHugh:
At the time he completed the dissertation McHugh, who is not
a Mormon (he is a Catholic), resided in Utah and was
employed as an archaeologist. He first presented his ideas at
an SBL conference (SBL = Society of Biblical Literature) held
at Creighton University. His particular theory is based on his
own translation of cuneiform texts and the principal
cuneiform sources used (i.e., seen as providing support for
the theory) are the Mul.Apin star catalogue, and the Enuma
Elish creation story, and the eleventh tablet of the Gilgamesh
epic. McHugh alone is responsible for his theory and
supporting evidence - there was no team of researchers as
stated in an ABC news story. The ABC producer of the news
story - in some context - apparently misleadingly described
John McHugh as an archaeoastronomer. Whilst
archaeastronomer is a popular term; there is no such
professional category. However, according to a viewer of the
news story McHugh was introduced as being about a "young
archaeologist from Utah" with a new theory on the Noah
tradition. A notice of the program was posted on the internet.
(3) Background - The Argument:
Unfortunately the local library service in Melton has proved
unwilling to obtain a loan copy of McHugh's dissertation for
me. It would also appear that only a few people have actually
read the dissertation. The reproduction of his dissertation
"Abstract" should suffice as basic information but so far is
nowhere produced. Using second-hand sources (including
media interviews or some persons quoting conversations or
correspondence with McHugh) it is possible to construct a
reasonable outline of his theory (but this method does not
provide clarification of all key points of evidence).
McHugh claims that the events of the Noah's flood story were
originally depicted amongst a set of Sumerian constellation
figures. The Noah's flood story in Genesis was preceded by a
Sumerian constellation tradition depicting Ut-napishtim's
flood. (The Book of Genesis is believed to have received its



main redaction circa 6th-century BCE. Redaction is a form of
editing in which multiple source texts are combined and
altered slightly to make a single coherent document.) McHugh
holds that before the invention of writing the Sumerians were
using a number of constellations as a picture-book to relate
the basic themes later contained in the Noah's flood story. In
the absence of writing the sky became a picture book (i.e.,
visual mnemonic) for the depiction of the Sumerian flood
story. McHugh also believes the Sumerian story of Ut
napishtim's flood to be based on an actual Mesopotamian
flood which occurred circa 6,000 BCE. As McHugh believes
that all of the major themes in the Mesopotamian/Biblical
flood story correspond to constellations computer software
was used to simulate what the sky would have looked like to
the early Sumerians circa 6,000 BCE. (The problems with
Delta-T do not make aspects of planetarium software reliable
when used to go back earlier than circa 2000 BCE.)
A brief statement by McHugh (ANE Digest, V2000, #36) about
his theory: "My hypothesis is fairly simple. I believe that
archaic cultures, that is, cultures that do not use science or
religion to explain their origins, explained and verified [?]
primordial events through pictographic stories depicted in the
constellations. The constellations in these picture stories
function as "astral artifacts" for the stories they depict.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the modern night sky,
where we can witness 46 of the 1st century Roman
constellations (and planets) engaged in primordial acts
depicted in picture stories. It is my belief that the flood was
merely one of these pictographic stories that confirmed a
cosmological [?] event."
A more detailed statement by McHugh (ANE Digest, V2000,
#38) with spelling and punctuation as it appeared: "I can show
that 4 deluge elements appear in every flood story; these
elements correspond to constellations, asterisms, or astral
religions: flood waters = the "flood wave" of the Apsu ("Enki



and the World Order") flood boat = each second millennium
BC flood ship is a MAGUR, a crescent shaped cargo vessel
positioned in the Apsu that has it bow "cut down" in the
Sumerian Gilgamesh and Agga epic (lines 80, 98). This
southern, prowless, crescent-shaped boat was adopted by the
Classical world and renamed Argo (I was vehemently attacked
in the journal "Archaeoastronomy" for suggesting this and my
article was not published) flood hero = Orion; the Assyrian
flood text states that the flood hero is granted everlasting life
"at the mouth of the rivers", which is where the Mesopotamian
equivalent to Orion, SIPA.ZI.AN.NA is positioned, standing at
the origin of Eridanus, which was probably the constellations
Tigris-Euphrates in ancient Sumeria (recall the Eridanus has
two distinct streams). benevolent deity = every flood text
involves a benevolent deity who warns the flood hero of an
impending deluge and implores him to build a boat. In the
ealriest flood stories this god is GU.LA = Ea, the constellation
Aquarius. When the original flood ship, the constellation
MAGUR, descends below the southern horizon in ca. 700 BC
due to precession of the equinoxes, Assyrian cosmologists
were forced to replace it with another constellation that was
positioned within the flood waters of the Apsu. The choices
therefore are: Goatfish, Water-god, fish, Field, Rivers, Ibex.
Everybody knows that the Assyrian flood ship with the
dimensions of an "IKU", "field", which means it was a cube 60
meters on a side. This vfield was definitely known to the
Greco-Roman world because it was straddled by Pisces on the
Calendar of Denderah. This was the first ark."
McHugh believes that ancient people basically named 3
constellations in remembrance of a "great flood" prior to the
invention of writing. The "great flood" event was connected
with a supposed Black Sea "Noah-like flood" identified by
Robert Ballard. He first publicised his idea in December 1996
in The New York Times, shortly before it was published in an
academic journal in 1997. However, aspects of Ballard's
methodology were flawed. While it is agreed that the



sequence of events described occurred, there is debate over
the suddenness, dating and magnitude of the events. A 5-year
cross-disciplinary research project under the sponsorship of
UNESCO and the International Union of Geological Sciences
was conducted 2005–2009. Its conclusion was that the
flooding might have been "quite mild." It also occurred earlier
than initially surmised, circa 7400 BCE.
The core of McHugh's theory seems to rely on several key
positions:
(1) McHugh interprets a particular Sumerian cylinder seal
depicting a crescent shaped ship and some human figures as
a "flood scene" Specifically the cylinder seal depicts a scene
involving a Ship (= Argo) and coming out of the ship is a man
animal (= Centaur) sacrificing a Beast upon an Altar. Smoke (=
the Milky Way) is depicted rising from the Altar. Also depicted
in the scene is a Raven (= Corvus) eating the flesh of a Water
snake (= Hydra). McHugh believes that this scene parallels the
Biblical story of Noah and the Flood. He then tries to marshal
evidence to demonstrate that this believed iconographic
depiction of the story of the flood on the cylinder seal was
also depicted in early Sumerian constellations.
(2) The human figures depicted on the cylinder seal
supposedly represent constellations (both aquatic and other
constellations). McHugh argues that we have a ship
constellation, a sea-monster constellation, a river
constellation, a "water-god" constellation, and a flood-hero
constellation related to illustrating a deluge-myth. He holds
that some of the key constellations for the depiction of the
flood story in the sky are Aquarius, Argo, Capricornus, Orion,
and Pisces. The main "characters" of the story were illustrated
by the constellations Aquarius, Argo and Orion. Aquarius
(Gu.la) depicts the benevolent god Ea (lord of the Apsu) who
warns Ut-napishtim (= the flood hero) of the impending flood
waters (= Apsu). (However, in another description of



McHugh's beliefs Aquarius is held to represent the flood
waters.) The constellation Orion (or mulSIPA.ZI.AN.NA "The
True Shepherd of Anu" in Mesopotamia) depicts the flood
hero Ut-napishtim. (The river constellation Eridanus leads
from the foot of the constellation Orion into the stellar waters
of the Apsu. Such was used by McHugh to identify Orion as
depicting Ut-napishtim who was described as "dwelling far off
at the mouth of the rivers.") McHugh also holds that the
original flood-ship was the constellation Magur (= Argo). It
appears that McHugh relies on Argo as the Sumerian ship
constellation. It seems that McHugh believes that Argo was
the first Ark (= Magur ship). McHugh further holds that the
Magur ship was later adopted by the ancient Greeks as the
ship-constellation Argo. (How McHugh establishes Argo in the
Sumerian sky is not clear from the second-hand sources I am
reliant upon. Some past Assyriologists, such as Carl Bezold,
have made the simplified association of the Babylonian star
name mulNUNki, the star of the city of Eridu (= Canopus
(alpha Carinae)), with the modern constellation Argo.
However, Bezold is not implying that Argo (or a ship) was
constellated in this region in the Babylonian sky.)
(3) Using the Mul.Apin star-list (which comprised material
from circa 1,000 BCE) McHugh apparently connects the star
name mulMA.GUR8 ("the star of the MAGUR-ship") in the Path
of Ea, as being connected to the ark of the flood. He would
identify the Magur "flood boat" with the position of the Greek
constellation Argo (or in the region of Argo). He believes the
original Magur ship-constellation was adopted in Greek
constellation iconography as the (enormous) ship
constellation (that was renamed) Argo (and located by the
Greeks in the same region of the sky). According to McHugh
by 700 BCE (i.e., during the Assyrian period) precessional
changes had noticeably affected the visibility of the southern
stars and so to keep all the flood myth characters depicted in
the visible sky the constellation depicting the Ark was
changed from Magur (or Argo) to the Pegasus-square (i.e.,



Iku). (Thus the reason why only a partial ship has been
constellated by the later Greeks.) According to McHugh the
original Magur ship constellation (Argo) was replaced in the
Assyrian version of the Gilgamesh text (and other Epic texts
of the Assyrian period). The reason for choosing Iku was to
have a ship that was located in the Apsu region. This change
in constellations also led to the change in depiction of the Ark
from a crescent shape to a square. With the change in
constellations from Magur (Argo) to Iku (Pegasus-square) the
iconography of the Ark changed from crescent shaped Magur
ships to coffin or box shaped depictions.
(4) McHugh's theory involves the concept of the "flood waters
of the Apsu" being represented in the sky. The constellations
in this region are: Goat-fish, Water-god, Fish[es], Field, Rivers
(Eridanus has two distinct streams), and Ibex.
To pour water on John McHugh's thesis:
(1) There is no evidence that the Sumerians (or later
Babylonians or Assyrians) depicted the stars that the ancient
Greeks constellated as Argo, as a ship. The Greek
constellation Argo is unknown in Mesopotamian tradition. No
multiple star ship-constellation appears in any known
Mesopotamian star-list. Also, no known Mesopotamian star
list is older than the second millennium. Samuel Kramer's
assertion in his "The Sumerians" (1963) that we have a list of
about 25 stars from Sumer is probably based on Ernst
Weidner's article "Fixsterne" in ReallexikonderAssyriologie.
However, Weidner was wrong and the earliest star-lists
mentioned by him date from the Old Babylonian period. The
English solicitor Robert Brown Junior made several mistaken
identifications of Mesopotamian ship constellations in his
PrimitiveConstellations (2 vols., 1898-99). Though full of
errors, and long outdated, the book is still popularly used. As
example: Theony Condos' book StarMythsoftheGreeksand
Romans(1997) used Brown to connect the origin of the Greek



Argo with the Mesopotamian "Ship of the Canal of Heaven".
Brown's attempts to reconstruct the "Euphratean Planisphere"
pivoted on the circular "astrolabes" and are full of errors. One
of his identified constellations in the outer ring (southern
division of Ea) - for the fifth month Dumuzi - is the "Ship-of
the-Canal-of-Heaven". The identification of such a
constellation is fallacious. (For reliable discussions of
"astrolabes" (more properly "star calendars") see: Albert
Schott, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen
Gesellschaft, 88 (1934) 302-337; and Christopher Walker &
Herman Hunger, Mitteilungen der Deutschen Orient
Gesellschaft zu Berlin, 109 (1977) 27-34.)
It would appear the only Mesopotamian star-list to make a
reference to a ship is Mul.Apin which lists mulMA.GUR8 (and
identified as epsilon Sagittauri denoted as "bark[-star]" in
Mul.Apinby Hermann Hunger and David Pingree (1989).) (The
term mulMA3.GUR8 meaning "the star of the Magur ship" is
given in PlanetariumBabylonicumby Felix Gössmann (1950.)
who makes the different identification of alpha + beta
Capricorni. The latter constellation studies of Erica Reiner and
David Pingree (BabylonianPlanetaryOmens2, 1981), and
Hermann Hunger and David Pingree (Mul.Apin, 1989) often
have different conclusions to it.) There is no indication that
McHugh identifies the original Magur boat with
mulMA[3].GUR8 listed in the Mul.Apin series. It has been
suggested that Nabu (the Babylonian god of wisdom)
corresponded with the stars mulMA2.GUR8 ("The Bark"),
which may be the bark of Ziusudra (in Mesopotamian religion,
a rough counterpart to the biblical Noah as survivor of a god
sent flood). Note: Oddly for McHugh's claims, a
constellation/asterism called Ma.Gur is not referred to in the
"astrolabe" genre. See: Horowitz, Wayne. (2014 (but
actually 2015?)). TheThreeStarsEach:TheAstrolabesand
RelatedTexts.



A reference to a single star as identified by Hunger and
Pingree does not infer a constellation. As two astral names
appear in the one statement the single[two] star designation
for Ma.Gur does not seem to make it a significant star
name/asterism. That Ma.Gur is absent in all star lists earlier
to Mul.Apin (i.e., the "astrolabes") does not seem to trouble
McHugh. He still uses very late texts to consolidate "the
original flood ship, the constellation Ma.Gur." Neither does the
contradictory star identifications for Ma.Gur apparently
trouble McHugh. Also, in early Sumerian myth Ut-napishtim's
ark was a perfect cube.
Circa 2000, Alastair McBeath erroneously promoted the idea
of a Sumerian boat constellation in Argo.
Precesion also plays a part in McHugh's speculations.
According to McHugh, after circa 700 BCE when precession
moved the (supposedly Sumerian) Ma.Gur constellation
(originally representing the "Ark") permanently out of sight
below the horizon in the northern hemisphere the Assyrians
replaced it with the "Pegasus square" which was still visible
and was positioned in the flood waters of the Apsu. It became
the constellation that represented the "Ark." As a consequence
of the replacement the crescent-shaped Magur boat became
the box(cube)-shape of the Pegasus-square. According to
McHugh it was the original prowless, crescent-shaped Magur
boat that was adopted by the classical world as the
constellations Argo.
(2) There is no evidence that the Mesopotamian sky was
widely constellated until the late 2nd millennium BCE (i.e., the
Cassite Period) - when the omina series Enuma Anu Enlil was
being completed circa 1,300 BCE. The purpose of
comprehensively constellating the night sky was to use the
constellations as reference points in the description of
celestial omens. (As example: Enuma Anu Enlil, Tablets 50
51.) Earlier, the stars and constellations were primarily used



as calendrical aids for marking the months of the Babylonian
lunar calendar - at least from the Old Babylonian Period (circa
1,800 to 1,500 BCE). The systematization of important
constellations (and some planets) which rose heliacally in the
twelve months of the Babylonian year were listed in circular
then tabular texts called the "Twelve Times Three". The use of
planets indicates that these texts were perhaps used to
predict heliacal risings for a single year only. (See:
MesopotamianCosmicGeographyby Wayne Horowitz
(1998).)
(3) The iconography of cylinder seals is not a simple subject
for interpretation. To argue a case on the basis of a sole
cylinder seal is questionable to say the least. The appearance
of "Aquarius", "Pisces", and "Capricornus" on Cylinder Seals of
the Sumerian and Akkadian period (circa 3,200-2,000 BCE)
does not equal the identification of these symbols as being
necessarily astral in character and denoting constellations.
This tends to be popularly done though. The written evidence
provides no justification for invoking descriptive astronomy
(i.e., constellation figures) as an aid to the explanation of seal
designs of the Sumerian and Akkadian period. However, such
an approach may be legitimate for seal designs of the Old
Babylonian period. The reason for the difference is we have
evidence of (much) later Babylonian usage of such e.g., great
gods representing the planets and figures symbolizing the
signs of the zodiac. (See: CylinderSealsby Henri Frankfort
(1939). Also, the undisciplined speculations comprising the
book Hamlet'sMill(1969) should not mislead us into believing
there is evidence that Neolithic societies world-wide were
aware of a 12-constellation equal-division zodiac (and also
precession). There is no evidence for a 12-constellation
zodiac of equal divisions in Mesopotamia until circa 500 BCE.
(A lot of these ideas are inherited from the now discredited
Panbabylonism movement of Hugo Winckler and Alfred



Jeremias circa 1900-1914. From the bibliography in Hamlet's
Millit is clear that Hertha von Dechend was influenced by the
ideas of Panbabylonism.)
(4) There is no evidence that the Greek ship-constellation
Argo was borrowed from Mesopotamia. Where Argo is the
Mesopotamians had a number of constellations including
BAN (the Bow) and KAK.SI.KI (the Arrow), NUN.KI (Canopus),
NIN.MAH (Goddess of Motherhood), and GAN.UR (the
Harrow). If any borrowing of the constellation Argo by the
Greeks took place then Egypt seems the more likely origin.
Plutarch identified Argo as the Egyptian constellation "Boat of
Osiris". The stars that the Greeks used to form the
constellation Argo didn't all disappear from Mesopotamian
skies by circa 700 BCE. As McHugh dates the flood to circa
6,000 BCE we are talking in terms of water craft as boats.
Boats did not become ships (i.e., employing use of sails, and
oars instead of paddles) until circa 3,000 BCE (TheSeaCraft
ofPrehistoryby Paul Johnstone (1980). A clay model of the
oldest known sailing vessel (a sailing skiff) was found in a
grave at Eridu, in southern Mesopotamia and dates circa
3,500 BCE (AHistoryofSeafaringby George Bass (1972)).
(5) The celestial boats in Mesopotamian mythology are not
connected with a deluge legend. They serve the mundane
purpose of providing a means of transportation for the
gods/goddesses. Also, more than one celestial ship exists in
Mesopotamian mythology - the gods/goddesses didn't have to
borrow. As example: The god Enki (the planet Saturn) rides
the cosmic waters in the "Great Boat of Heaven" (the Magur
boat).
(6) The Mesopotamian texts preserve a number of different
views of the Apsu. Usually it indicated the waters of the
underworld beneath the earth that contained a freshwater
ocean (the sweet water sea). According to Hamlet'sMillby
Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend (1969) the



Babylonians named the Pisces-Canopus region of the sky "the
sea". The Pegasus-square (Babylonian iku "the field") joined
Pisces which was connected to the depth of the salt sea and
Canopus which was connected to the depth of the sweet
water sea. (The authors do not identify which cuneiform
text(s) make these identifications. However, see "Some lights
on Babylonian Astronomy" by Franz Kugler, (ZfA, Band 25,
Issue 3-4, 1911). He discusses the southern region of the
zodiac being styled the heavenly absu, "ocean.") Where
McHugh has ""the flood wave" of the Apsu" (Enki and the
World Order) Samuel Kramer has "great flood-wave of the sea"
(MythsofEnki,theCraftyGodedited by Samuel Kramer and
John Maier (1989).
(7) McHugh, however, has not proposed a new theory of
Noah's flood. Some 100 years ago the identical ideas were
vigorously promoted by both PanEgyptian and PanBabylonism
enthusiasts (e.g., Gerald Massey and Heinrich Zimmern).
Nearly 120 years ago the English poet, spiritist, and amateur
Egyptologist Gerald Massey in his book TheNaturalGenesis
(2 vols., 1883) believed he had demonstrated that the Noah's
Ark story was written in the stars by the ancient Egyptians.
Like McHugh, Massey makes use of the three water "signs"
Aquarius, Capricornus, and Pisces. The twist is that Massey
used Egyptian mythology to "prove" his case. At the start of
the 19th century the Panbabylonists (who formed a special
part of the Star Myth school) also got into the act but of
course used Mesopotamian mythology. The German
Assyriologist and Panbabylonist Heinrich Zimmern in his book
TheBabylonianandtheHebrewGenesis(1901) argued the
place of the Babylonian flood was in the sky and was
transferred to an earthly scenario.
(8) Ballard is an oceanographer, not an archaeologist or
geologist. For a brief skeptical view of Ballard's
archaeological evidence, by a professional archaeologist, see:



http://www.skepticink.com/lateraltruth/2012/12/19/robert
ballard-goes-out-of-his-depth/
The test for McHugh's theory will be the use of rigorous
evidence and the absence of excessive speculation. The
problem with previous approaches - such as Panbabylonism
is that it had to argue that its tenets were implied in widely
divergent material (as there were never any direct supporting
statements contained in texts). The Noah's Ark in the stars
idea may need baling out.
Background - Possible Influences
A "Bible/Gospel in the Stars" background/precedent is
indicated.
It appears that McHugh's ideas regarding the constellations
mirror those of Frances Rolleston's 'Bible in the stars' book
Mazzaroth(1862). (I do not know if McHugh references
Mazzaroth;orTheconstellationsby Frances Rolleston.)
Rolleston believed that the people who originated the
constellations did so with the intention of preserving some
early parts of Genesis. It is indicated as later being an
influence on the constellations ideas of the English sunspot
specialist Edward Maunder. From the late 1870s Maunder's
approach to the history of the constellations was shaped by
Frances Rolleston's 'Bible in the stars' book Mazzaroth(1862).
Though he later criticised its ideas his articles later in life still
showed a 'Bible in the stars' belief, though somewhat more
restrained. Maunder also believed that the people who
originated the constellations did so with the intention of
preserving some early parts of Genesis. This religious belief
dictated the further belief that the constellations were a set
that originated early. Frances Rolleston (1781-1864) was a
pious unmarried woman of some wealth. However, she mostly
lived with relatives and friends, occasionally renting a cottage.
The genesis of the book dates to the 1820s, and it was
substantially written in the early 1840s, with the help and
encouragement of one of her sisters. There was a lapse of 15



or more years between the completion of Mazzarothand its
publication. Although it was published by Rivington
(Rivington's, London), its publication was subsidized by
Rolleston herself. The final version of Mazzarothis the work
of a woman in her 70s, who had had very poor eyesight since
the age of 30. Rolleston believed that through the ancient
names for the stars (constellations), it was possible to
discover the oldest knowledge transmitted from the Judaic
Christian god of the Bible to humankind: the method of
peoples redemption and the coming of the Jewish messiah.
Rolleston is usually described as a linguist and she claimed to
know Hebrew, Arabic, Chaldee and Syriac. She did know Greek
and Latin. She wrote to one regular correspondent that
wherever the root (of a word) exists in Hebrew, Arabic,
Chaldee and Syriac, there we have a relique of the Noachic
tongue. She spent her life as a mythographer, poet (she was
considered a competent poet), and letter writer. She had a
passion for painting and music
See also Maunder, Edward. (1885). "An Old Monument: or
the Story of the Constellations." (Sunday Magazine, April,
Pages 158-162). (One of his earliest article on the origin of
the constellations and unreliable. Obviously influenced
by the ideas of the classicist and linguist Frances
Rolleston (1781-1864) in her "gospel in the stars" book
Mazzaroth, or The Constellations (4 Volumes, 1862-1865),
which has belief in Biblical literalism. The constellations
are viewed as descending from Noah and illustrating
episodes in Genesis..
Another possible influence on McHugh is ultimately: The
ChaldeanAccountofGenesisby George Smith (1876) which
expanded on "The Chaldean Account of the Deluge." by
George Smith (Transactions of the Society of Biblical
Archaeology, Volume 2, 1873, Pages 213-234). In 1880 an
edition of TheChaldeanAccountofGenesisedited by



Archibald Sayce was published. I think an edition of this book
is referenced by McHugh. As far as I am aware similar types
of evidence are used (i.e., iconography).
Appendix 1: Some Comments/Summaries made by Supporters of
McHugh's Ideas
From ABC NEWS by Michael Guillen,
(http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/MichaelGuillen/Mi
chael_Guillen.html)
"The story of Noah's Ark has timeless attraction. In a recent
Gallup poll, it came in third in the all-time list of things people
want to know more about. John McHugh, a young
archaeologist from Utah, and his colleagues have found
evidence that long before the invention of writing, the original
version of the basic Noah's Ark story was written in the stars
by the Sumerians, a culture that existed before modern
civilization, as early as 6,000 to 7,000 ago. The story was told
by using the constellations. To figure out the tale, researchers
first took into account that Earth wobbles as it spins, which
means that constellations back then appeared elsewhere in
the sky. Then they used computer simulation to figure out
what the sky looked like to early Sumerians. According to the
researchers, the Sumerians imposed on these stars figures
that corresponded to the three main characters in their flood
story. Those constellations are what we call Aquarius, Orion
and Argo. The shape of the ark back then was crescent,
keeping with the real ships of the time. That began to change
around 700 B.C., because as Earth wobbled, Argo began to dip
below the horizon. The ancients needed to pick a substitute in
order to keep the picture story intact. So they picked Pegasus,
which is square-shaped. As a result, we see in depictions of
the ark after that time that they are mostly square-shaped.
This latest discovery doesn’t settle the mystery of the Great
Flood, but it certainly assures us that the story is ancient
history."



Posted to Hastro-L, circa early 2000, by an astronomer (who
had a copy of McHugh's dissertation):
I would like to spend a short while on a matter marginal to my
theme, but of some general interest. If you refer to Figure 6,
you will see the large constellation of Argo the Ship, often
shown in early representations as though atop a mountain.
Coming from the ship is the Centaur, a man-animal, sacrificing
a Beast upon the Altar. We see, too, the Water-snake (Hydra)
with a Raven (Corvus) eating its flesh. There can be no doubt
that here we have, in imagination pictured in the sky, a version
of the story of Noah and the Flood.* The picture is complete
with the Milky Way seeming to rise as smoke from the Altar.
Consider the following quotation, with which we are all
familiar?: 'And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord, and took
of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt
offerings at the altar .... And God said "This is the token of the
covenant which I make between me and you for perpetual
generations. I do set my bow in a cloud, and it shall be a token
of a covenant between me and the Earth."' The Bow of
Sagittarius is fixed pointing to one of the most obvious rifts,
or clouds, in the Milky Way. Of course, this association of the
Southern constellations with the flood story that occurs in
Genesis, and in the Babylonian Book of Gilgamesh, is no new
insight, for when the stars left vacant by changing the course
of Eridanus were later given a name, Columba the Dove was
chosen. * Umapishtim, the Babylonian Noah, 'lived at the
mouth of the River'; c.f. the discussion concerning the course
of the constellation Eridanus."
Critique posted to Hastro-L early 2000, by an astronomer:
"John McHugh's interpretation of at least a subset of the
constellations as remnants of Sumerian star lore that
incorporated the traditional Flood myth relies on the
identification of the archaic Greek constellation Argo as a
much earlier Sumerian ship constellation. To the best of my



knowledge textual evidence does not confirm such an identity
and in fact contradicts it. Although well-known errors in
Mesopotamian star lore have continued to perpetuate the
notion of a Sumerian star ship for more than a hundred years,
reliable explicit evidence for this phantom vessel is not
available. Raiders seeking a lost Ark constellation from Sumer
have, I think, missed the boat. Also, in the context of
constellation function, it is difficult to explain why, in this
particular reconstruction, the figures involved perform as a
reservoir of Deluge lore. More than parallels, resemblances,
etymological linkages are required to demonstrate an idea like
this holds water. On the other hand, the identification of Argo
as the Boat of Osiris, an Egyptian constellation and part [of]
(sic) an altogether different tradition, is, provided by Plutarch.
The absence, at this time, of confirmation from Egyptian texts
leaves the issue unresolved, but Plutarch's record on other
aspects of Egyptian star lore is not bad. He was probably onto
something with the Egyptian Argo, but it wasn't catastrophic
flood."
Appendix 2: 'Heard It All Before'
"But there is another constellation which shows in a more
marked way than either the Centaur or the Altar that the date
when the constellations were invented must have been near
that which I have named. Both Ara and Centaurus look now in
suitable latitudes (about twenty degrees north) as they looked
in higher latitudes (about forty degrees north) 4000 years ago.
For, the reeling motion of our earth has changed the place of
the celestial pole in such a way as only to depress these
constellations southwards without much changing their
position; they are nearly upright when due south now as they
were 4000 years ago, only lower down. But the great ship Argo
has suffered a much more serious displacement. One cannot
now see this ship like a ship at any time or from any place on
the earth's surface. If we travel south till the whole
constellation comes into visibility above the southern horizon
at the proper season (January and February for the midnight



hours) the keel of the ship is aslant, the stern being high
above the waist (the fore part is wanting). If we travel still
further south, we can indeed reach places where the course of
the ship is so widened, and the changes of position so
increased, that she appears along part of her journey on an
even keel, but then she is high above the horizon. Now 4000
years ago she stood on the horizon itself at her southern
culmination, with level keel and upright mast.
In passing I may note that for my own part I imagine that this
great ship represented the Ark, its fore part being originally
the portion of the Centaur now forming the horse, so that the
Centaur was represented as a man (not as a man-horse)
offering a gift on the Altar. Thus in this group of constellations
I recognise the Ark, and Noah going up from the Ark towards
the altar 'which he builded unto the Lord; and took of every
clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt
offerings on the altar.' I consider further that the constellation
figures of the Ship, the Man with an offering, and the Altar,
painted or sculptured in some ancient astrological temple,
came at a later time to be understood as picturing a certain
series of events, interpreted and expanded by a poetical writer
into a complete narrative. Without venturing to insist on so
heterodox a notion, I may remark as an odd coincidence that
probably such a picture or sculpture would have shown the
smoke ascending from the Altar which I have already
described, and in this smoke there would be shown the bow of
Sagittarius; which, interpreted and expanded in the way I have
mentioned, might have accounted for the 'bow set in the
clouds, for a token of a covenant.' It is noteworthy that all the
remaining constellations forming the southern limit of the old
star-domes or charts, were watery ones—the Southern Fish,
over which Aquarius is pouring a quite unnecessary stream of
water, the Great Sea Monster towards which in turn flow the
streams of the River Eridanus. The equator, too, was then
occupied along a great part of its length by the great sea
serpent Hydra, which reared its head above the equator, very



probably indicated then by a water horizon, for nearly all the
signs below it were then watery. At any rate, as the length of
Hydra then lay horizontally above the Ship, whose masts
reached it, we may well believe that this part of the picture of
the heavens showed a sea-horizon and a ship, the great sea
serpent lying along the horizon. On the back of Hydra is the
Raven, which again may be supposed by those who accept the
theory mentioned above to have suggested the raven which
went forth to and fro from the ark. He is close enough to the
rigging of Argo to make an easy journey of it. The dove,
however, must not be confounded with the modern
constellation Columba, though this is placed (suitably
enough) near the Ark. We must suppose the idea of the dove
was suggested by a bird pictured in the rigging of the celestial
ship. The sequence in which the constellations came above
the horizon as the year went round corresponded very
satisfactorily with the theory, fanciful though this seem to
some. First Aquarius pouring streams of water, the three
fishes (Pisces and Piscis australis), and the great sea
monster Cetus, showing how the waters prevailed over the
highest hills, then the Ark sailing on the waters, a little later
the Raven (Corvus), the man descending from the ark and
offering a gift on the Altar, and last the Bow set amid the
clouds." ("Origin of the Constellation-Figures." in Mythsand

There is also: Anonymous. (1888). "The Star Story of the

Richard Proctor.
Appendix 3: The Basis for the Mistakes of Robert Brown Junior



Robert Brown Junior mistook the early circular "three stars
each" texts (commonly called "astrolabes" or "planispheres"
but actually functioning as star calendars (within an astral
omen framework)) as representing the standard
Mesopotamian scheme of constellations. On the basis of
three small fragments of these circular "star calendars" (Sm.
162, Sm. 608, and Sm. 94) he attempted to re-establish what
he believed was a complete standard Babylonian
"planisphere." His speculative and erroneous reconstruction of
such was based on his belief that the "planispheres" set out
an ecliptic based scheme with the 12 stars in the Path of Ea
(outer ring) marking southern constellations, the 12 stars in
the Path of Enlil (inner ring) marking northern constellations,
and the 12 stars in the Path of Anu (middle ring) marking the
12 zodiacal constellations along the ecliptic. On the basis of
his mistaken "planisphere" reconstruction Brown believed the
constellations, including a 12-constellation zodiac scheme, in
something like their present form, originated in Mesopotamia
in the late 3rd millennium BCE. He denied (quite incorrectly)
that anyone in Mesopotamia was inventing the 12
constellation zodiac as late as circa 500 BCE. Brown was
unaware of the star lists of the Mul.Apin series. Mul.Apin
tablet 1 (BM 86378) was not published until 1912 by Leonard
King (CT33, Plates 1-8) and it was perhaps first discussed by
Franz Kugler in his Supplement 1 (1913) to his Sternkunde
undSterndienstinBabel. The first section of Mul.Apin tablet 1
lists considerably more stars in the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea
than are found in the "planispheres." (He was also misled by
the limited listing of stars/constellations in the Paths of Enlil,
Anu, and Ea through Tablet 82-5-22 512.)
Appendix 4: The Origin of the Ship Constellation Argo
The constellation Argo was well attested in the Hellenistic
period. The suggestion that the Argo was made a
constellation in conformity with Egyptian astronomical lore
(i.e., the supposition that the ship of Osiris was set in the
night sky) can be rejected. (Franz Boll in his masterwork



Sphaera(1903) rejected the suggestion.) The ship of Osiris
traversed the underworld, not the night sky. This fact ensures
the ship of Osiris could not have been an Egyptian
constellation. It is likely that the identification of the ship of
Osiris with the Argo is a Greek idea.
