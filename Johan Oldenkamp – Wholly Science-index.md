The Emerald Tablets contain the writings of Thoth the Atlantean,
later known as Hermes Trismegistus. Number 11 of the 13 original
tablets is about the (mirroring) relation between ‘above’ and ‘below’.
The most common description of this proverb is: ‘that which is above
is the same as that which is below, and that which is below is the
same as that which is above’. This book shows the scientific meaning
of this perhaps oldest proverb known to present-day humanity.

Foreword
This is a science book. This book is meant for everyone who values
understanding higher than believing. In this book, I share my under
standing of the core principles behind the creation of the reality we
live in. Before you begin to read this book, probably starting at the
first chapter on the next page, I have one request for you: “Please do
not believe one word of this book.” Please try to fully understand
everything I wrote down. When you encounter something you do not
understand, even after doing your own research, also based on other
sources, then please totally forget about that part of this book. Ap
parently, it was not meant for you (or it might even be complete and
utter nonsense).
Believe in yourself, and in your capability to understand everything
you want to understand. I believe in myself, and I want to fully un
derstand the reality we live in. That is my Holy Quest to wholly un
derstand the Wholeness of Everything. That is also the mission of the
Pateo Academia. Are you a scientist who wants to help spread and
develop Wholly Science? Then please contact me. My e-mail address
is on the second page of this book.
During the past four years, I have invested all my time and money in
developing Wholly Science (for instance, I resigned from my well
paid job as a university professor and I sold my house). In order to
further professionalize the Pateo Academia, additional funding and
appropriate housing is required. Can you help to transform the Pateo
Academia into a world-leading science institute? Then please do con
tact me.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 5
1. Science of Creation
Science without spirituality is dead and without soul. Spirituality
without science, on the other hand, is fantasy and ungrounded.
The universities offer us nothing but dead and soulless theories.
The universities are like the emperor without clothes in the famous
fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. The naked truth is that the
universities offer us fake science.
The churches offer us nothing but ungrounded fairy tales. These
churches include not only all organized religions, but also New Age
and other woolly and vague examples of fake spirituality.
This book shows that grounded spirituality is the beating heart of a
living science. The whole of living science with grounded spirituality
beating in its heart is called Wholly Science.
Wholly Science studies harmony.
This study is based on three pil
lars: numbers, music, and ge
ometry. Each pillar reveals the
universal principles of harmony,
each in its own way. These are
always dynamic principles, since
everything is always moving.
Let us start with the principles of harmonic music. A key principle of
harmonic music is the octave. Octave means the whole of 8 (since
octo is Latin for eight). An octave is a set of eight consecutive tones.
We generally identify these eight tones as Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si,
and then again Do. The ratio between the oscillation frequencies of
the first (and slowest) Do and the second (and fastest) Do is 1:2. The
octave is the first harmonic ratio. The other two harmonic ratios are
the quint and the quart.
All harmonic ratios are always relative proportions of a multiple of 2
and a multiple of 3. That is why Wholly Science calls both numbers



6 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
the universal Harmonic Ratio Base Numbers. Two harmonic vibra
tions always have a ratio of 2a : 3b (where both a and b are always so
called Fibonacci-numbers, as described later on in this book).
1 : 2 Octave 30 : 21
2 : 3 Quint 21 : 31
3 : 4 Quart 31 : 22
A harmonic octave contains four quints and four quarts, as shown in
the figure below. The four upper bows represent the quints, while the
four bows down represent the quarts. Now, we can understand why
the names quint and quart are used. A quint (Latin for fifth) is a har
monic relation between a first and a fifth tone, while a quart (Latin
for fourth) is a harmonic relation between a first and a fourth tone.
The ratios between the successive tones in a harmonic octave is 2
times standard (meaning 23:32, which is 8:9), then once small (35:28,
which is 243:256), then 3 times standard (again 23:32), and finally
once small again (35:28). In the length of the se
quences of the standard ratios, we therefore see
another rhythm based on the universal Ratio Base
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 7
Numbers 2 and 3. This rhythm is clearly visible in the black keys of
the piano or the accordion.
The standard ratios are about 21/3 times larger than the small
ones. Between the successive tones with a standard ratio, there is
enough space for a semitone, right in the middle between both tones.
However, the more than twice smaller space between the tones with
a small ratio offers not enough space for a semitone. That is why a
musical scale contains 8 wholly tones and (2+3=) 5 semitones. On
the keyboard, the wholly tones are white and the semitones black.
Together, these are the (8+5=) 13 (wholly and semi-) tones of har
monic music.
In the figure on the previous page, the note A (or the tone La)
vibrates exactly 432 times (per second). By tuning the musical A to
this frequency of 432 Hertz (abbreviated as Hz), music resonates
with our inner vibrations.
Please note that there is no first vibrational octave, nor a last one.
The frequencies of each following octave are simply doubled com
pared to the previous one. However, when we start with a Do that
vibrates exactly once every second (meaning an oscillation frequency
of 1 Hz), then we arrive at the ninth octave at the frequencies men
tioned in the figure on the previous page.

8 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
Each harmonic octave (meaning ‘whole of 8’) consists not only of 8
wholly tones, but also of 8 harmonic relations (4 quints plus 4
quarts). The frequency ratios mentioned above, originate from Py
thagoras in Ancient Greece. Most ‘music’ currently produced, is not
based on these harmonic ratios, and neither vibrates the tone A on
432 Hz. That is, however, not the only vital knowledge humanity lost
over the ages related to the essence of music, as we will see below.
Why do we use the names of Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, and Si to refer
to the wholly notes? The table below shows that these notes are ab
breviations of Latin words. Each Latin word refers to a level within
the Ray of Creation. We find a very accurate scientific description of
the Ray of Creation in the first chapter of the first book of the Holy
Bible. Wholly Science shows the true meaning of Holy, which is the
same as Wholly. The title of the first chapter of the Book of Genesis
(which is also the First Book of Moses) is The Creation. The content
of that first chapter of the Bible has nothing to do with faith in God.
On the contrary, it enables us to understand the true essence of God
and the Wholly Work of God, which is Creation. We find God as the
initiator of the Ray of Creation, also referred to as the Unmoved
Mover by Aristotle, another (wholly) scientist form Ancient Greece.
We also find God on every other level of the Ray of Creation. To
distinguish between these different creating Gods, each God has a
different name on each level. The abbreviations of these (seven)
names of God are Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, and Si.
Tone Latin English Meaning Day
Do Dominus Lord The Lord 0
Si Sidera Stars all galaxies 1
La Lactea Milk our Milky Way 2
Sol Sol Sun our sun Helios 3
Fa Fāta Fate our solar system 4
Mi Microcosmus Microcosm our planet Terra 5
Re Regina Regent our moon Luna 6
Do Dominus Lord The Lord 7
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 9
The Ray of Creation starts on Day 0 with the intention of the Lord
God (Almighty) to create the whole of reality, mostly called ‘the
world’. This is the tone of Do from Dominus, meaning the Lord.
On Day 1, God separated the light from the darkness. This is the
separation of the light (yang) of all the stars (or Sidera in Latin) from
the darkness (yin) of the rest of the universe (or macrocosm). This is
the tone of Si from Sidera (or all galaxies).
On Day 2, God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.” The ‘waters’
is a reference to a galaxy. The galaxy we can see in the midst of the
firmament is our own galaxy called the Milky Way. This is the tone
of La from Lactea, meaning milk.
On Day 3, God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gath
ered together into one place.” In this level of Creation, ‘water’ refers
to light. The gathering of light into one place is a reference to our sun
Helios. This is the tone of Sol, meaning the sun.
On Day 4, God said, “Let there be lights in the firmament of the
heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs
and for seasons and for days and years.” These lights in the firma
ment that enable us to keep track of time are the visible planets of
our solar system. These planets play a key role in astrology, which
provides us a scientific description of fate. This is the tone of Fa
from Fata, meaning fate.
On Day 5, God said, “Let the waters bring forth swarms of living
creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the firmament of
the heavens.” Again, the ‘waters’ that bring forth living creatures
refer to light, meaning all cosmic energies that support biological
life. The microcosm includes all living creatures on our mother
planet called Terra (Gaia means Mother Terra). Next, the ‘birds’ that
fly above the microcosm of Terra across the firmament of the heav
ens refer to the stars of the macrocosm. This is the tone of Mi as the
abbreviation of the Latin word Microcosmus.
On Day 6, God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our
likeness; and let them reign over the fish of the sea, and over the
birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over the entire planet, and
over every creeping thing that creeps upon the planet.” This is the



10 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
tone of Re of Regina, meaning Regent. Humanity’s role is to reign or
rule over biological live on Terra. At this level of the Ray of Crea
tion, the moon Luna reigns (as a Regent) over the waters of Terra.
On Day 7 we find again the tone of Do from Dominus, meaning
Lord. Or to put this differently, the seventh Day is the Day of the
Lord.
1.1 Seven Days of the Week
The names we use to identify the seven days of the week refer to the
seven heavenly bodies that can be seen with the naked eye from the
surface of Terra. The figure below shows the astrological sign of
each of these seven heavenly bodies.
The ordering of these seven heavenly bodies is based on the orbiting
speed as perceived from the surface of Terra. Please note that the sun
Helios is not really orbiting Terra, since it is actually the other way
round. Also, a full orbit of the moon Luna around Terra (called a
syderic cycle) lasts 27.3 days. The illumination cycle of Luna (called
a synodic cycle) lasts 29.5 days. The average length of both is 28.4
days. The table below shows the perceived orbiting time in natural
days in rounded numbers.
body Luna Mercury Venus Helios Mars Jupiter Saturn
orbit 28 88 225 365 687 4,333 10,760
In all ancient cultures, these seven visible bodies played an important
role. The table below shows the names of these seven heavenly bod
ies in five classical languages, together with English.

Venus Inanna Ishtar Aphroditê Venus Sukra
Sun Utu Shamash Helios Sol Surya
Mars Gugulanna Nergal Ares Mars Mangala
Jupiter Enlil Marduk Zeus Iuppiter Brhaspati
Saturn Ninurta Ninurta Kronos Saturnus Sani
The figure to the left shows these seven bodies
placed in the same ordering in a circle. Next,
seven lines connect each body with the oppo
site bodies on the other side of the circle. We
find this ordering of the seven-pointed star in
days of the week. However, in the current
English names of the seven days of the week,
the relation with these heavenly bodies is not
very clear anymore. By combining it with the French names, this
relation becomes clearer, as shown in the table below. In the order of
the planets in a week, we also find a perfect alternation of yang and
yin. Please note that I consider Mercury to be feminine (yin), based
on the feminine cross at the bottom of the astrological sign of Mer
cury. In the figure with the seven-pointed star, the yin bodies are on
the left hand side, and the yang bodies on the right hand side. In the
middle, we find the sun Helios (also yang).

1.2 Seven Levels of Creation
There is a remarkable symbol that represents the seven levels of crea
tion as described in the first chapter of the Book of Genesis. The fig
ure below shows this symbol. It is called the Enneagram (ennea or
enniá is Greek for nine).
It was Georges Ivanovitch Gurdjieff (1868 – 1949), who brought the
knowledge represented in this symbol out in the open. In order to
make sure only the true seekers of Wholly Science would discover
the knowledge hidden in the Enneagram, Mister Gurdjieff deliber
ately altered some details. That is why my explanation as described
below differs from the ones Piotr Dimianovich Ouspensky (1878
1947) gives in his revealing books.
The explanation of the mysterious symbol of the
Enneagram begins with the two small triangles,
corresponding to the two lower corners of the
dotted triangle within the circle. The small trian
gle pointing upwards represents a male shock
(yang), while the small triangle pointing down
wards represents a female shock (yin). Both
shocks are necessary to overcome the vibrational distances between
the neighboring wholly tones that lack an intermediate semitone.
The female, yin shock is directed inwards, which means incom
ing or positive (+). The ingoing, female shock occurs between the Mi
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 13
and the Fa. The male, yang shock, on the other hand, is directed
outwards, which means outgoing or negative (-). The outgoing, male
shock starts between the Sol and the La, but his effect occurs be
tween the Si and the Do (where this shock is needed to overcome the
vibrational distance between Si and Do).
Day Tone Meaning Number
0 Do Dominus, the Lord 1
1 Si Sidera, all stars 2
2 La Lactea, Milky Way 3
3 Sol Sol, sun Helios 6
4 Fa Fāta, fate, planets 12
5 Mi Microcosm, Terra 24
6 Re Regina, moon Luna 48
At the top level of the Ray of Creation, we find the wholeness or
unity of the tone Do meaning Dominus or the Lord. The number 1
represents this wholly (or Holy) unity. In the first chapter of Genesis,
this corresponds to Day 0 of the Creation.
At the level of Si meaning Sidera (all stars of all galaxies), we
find the creation of the division between the stars and the space in
between these stars. This is the duality between light (yang) and
darkness (yin). The number 2 represents this duality. In the first
chapter of Genesis, this corresponds to Day 1 of the Creation.

∆ male Light Fire electric outgoing yang

∇∇
∇ female Dark Water magnetic ingoing yin +
Light corresponds to the electric energy of Fire (yang), and the Dark
ness with the magnetic energy of Water (yin), as shown in the table
above. Fire and Water are the names of cosmic energies. That is why
the first chapter of Genesis repeatedly mentions both light and water.
At the level of La meaning Lactea or the Milky Way, we find the
creation of the trinity. The number 3 represents this trinity. In the
first chapter of Genesis, this corresponds to Day 2 of the Creation.



14 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
This trinity is shown by the dotted triangle in the circle. The two bot
tom points of the dotted inner triangle correspond to the duality of
male and female. The Do at the apex of this triangle represents the
union of this duality. Similarly, a sine wave (symbolized as ~) unites
an upper and a lower bow. This union of the duality of male and fe
male creates the wholeness. This is a whole-making or healing union,
also referred to as a Holy or Sacred union. The table below shows
some examples of such wholly or holy trinities. Mister Gurdjieff re
ferred to this wholly trinity as the Law of Three.

The Holy Do is always an abstract process, just like walking along
our way or path is a process. That is also the exact meaning of the
Japanese word Do, that we find at the end of the names of many tra
ditional (martial) arts. Fully practicing these fascinating arts always
becomes a way of living. Unlike the Do at the apex of the inner
traingel, which is an abstract process, both the male and female
shock are concrete events required to keep this abstract process go
ing.
The essential disparity between the abstract top of the dotted inner
triangle and both concrete base points (meaning the male and the
female shock) is unfortunately hardly reflected in several classic de
scriptions of the Holy Trinity, as shown in the table below.
Father Holy Spirit Son
Osiris Isis Horus
Brahman Vishnu Shiva
Buddha Dharma Shanga
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 15
At the level of Sol meaning the sun Helios, we find the creation of
the hexad, which is a six-parted unity. The number 6 represents this
hexad. In the first chapter of Genesis, this corresponds to Day 3 of
the Creation.
In the Enneagram, the six solid straight lines represent the hexad.
The direction of these lines is reflected in the fractional series of 7.
For instance, by dividing 1 by 7, we get the infinite repetition of the
ciphers 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, and 7. Because of this remarkable numerical
regularity with 7 as the divisor, Mister Gurdjieff referred to the
hexad as the Law of Seven.
At the level of Sol, the process of Creation includes 6 steps. In the
Enneagram, this creational process is represented by the walking the
path of the six solid straight lines. Each step of this path requires a
different activity and point of focus.

4 – 2 Wanting Motivation
2 – 8 Being Competency
8 – 5 Knowing Transformation
5 – 7 Arranging Organization
7 – 1 Releasing Synergy



16 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
At the level of Fa meaning Fata of fate, we find the creation of the
dozen, which is a twelve-parted unity. The number 12 represents this
dozen. In the first chapter of Genesis, this corresponds to Day 4 of
the Creation.
Astrology shows us that fate is written in the stars. To be more
precise, astrology shows that fate is caused by the movements of the
heavenly bodies through the 12 houses of the Zodiac, each repre
sented by a specific constellation of stars.

The table above shows these constellations of the Zodiac. In general,
each constellation is known by its original Latin name. In the cases
of Scorpio and Capricorn, this original name has been slightly modi
fied by removing the ‘us’ at the end (and adding an ‘o’ or nothing).
Next to both cosmic energies mentioned before (Fire and Water),
the table above shows two more cosmic energies: Earth and Air.
Within the 12 constellations, we find a quartet of trinities: one for
each type of cosmic energy.
Within the Enneagram, there are a dozen crossings of straight, solid
lines with the doted lines of the inner triangle. On each crossing, a

At the level of Mi meaning microcosm, we find the creation of a 24
parted unity. In the first chapter of Genesis, this corresponds to Day
5 of the Creation. Unfortunately, we have no single word to refer to
this wholeness of 24, which is a double dozen, a quartet of hexads, or
an octave of trinities. However, we do find 24 hours within a period
of a natural day. This means that a natural day is an example 24
parted unity, in which the parts are the hours.
At the level of the microcosm, each of the 12 constellations has both
a positive yin face, and a negative yang face. The table below shows
these 24 faces of the microcosm. Each of these 24 faces, is present
within every human. Based on the moment of birth, the duality of
two of these 24 faces dominates human consciousness at this level,
as shown in the table below.
Pythagoras said that (normal) man is two octaves below God. Now
we can see what he meant. God (meaning Sol or Helios) is at 6, while
man is at 24 (of Mi), which is indeed two octaves lower than 6.

At the level of Re meaning Regina or Regent, we find the creation of
a 48-parted unity. In the first chapter of Genesis, this corresponds to
Day 6 of the Creation. Again, we have no single word to refer to this
wholeness of 48, which is a quartet of dozens, an octave of hexads,
or 16 trinities. We find a close example of this 48-parted unity in the
humane genome, which consists of pairs of chromosomes. In total,
there are 24 different human chromosomes. However, two of these
chromosomes are gender chromosomes, and they are not doubled
into a pair in each human’s genome.
The level of Mi from microcosm (ruled by Mother Terra) is the
base level for human existence. At the level of Re from Regina, ruled
by Regent Luna, human existence has dropped below this base level.
We can refer to humans at this sub base level of existence as luna
tics. A lunatic is innerly off balance. By remaining innerly off bal
ance for a longer period, diseases start to surface. The table below
shows the bodily locations of these diseases, based on the moment of
birth. This relation is based on the three decanates (or decans for
short) per Zodiac sign. A decan is the division of the full period of a
Zodiac sign (of 30 degrees of arc) into three equally long periods (of
each 10 degrees of arc). Roughly, we can say that the people who
were born on the day numbers of 21 and higher belong to the first
decan. The second decan corresponds to the day numbers from 1 to
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 19
10. The remaining day numbers (11 up to 20) belong to the third de
can. The table below shows the corresponding disease for each decan
per Zodiac sign.

At the level of Re (ruled by Regent Luna) there are 36 extra decans,
on top of the 12 Zodiac signs (resulting in a total of 48). These 36
extra decans correspond to 36 extra constellations of stars. Please
note that these 36 extra (astrological) constellations of stars are only
visible from the northern hemisphere (in total, astrology distin
guishes 88 different star constellations).
The table above shows these 36 extra astrological constellations,
on top of the 12 astrological constellations that correspond to the 12
signs of the Zodiac (presented at the level of Fa from Fata or Fate).
Each level of the Ray of Creation has its own primary Creator or
governing God. The table below shows this hierarchy of Gods. At the
highest level, we find the initiator of the Ray of Creation. The name I
have given to this Unmoved Mover is Omni, meaning the whole of
everything. Omni is the God of the seventh heaven (Do).
Heaven Tone Governing God Name Faces
7 Do Wholeness Omni 1

5 La the Milky Way’s core Hunab K’u 3
4 Sol the sun Helios 6
3 Fa Jupiter Zeus 12
2 Mi the earth Terra 24
1 Re the moon Luna 48
In the sixth heaven (Si), the reigning God is the Creator of yin (dark
ness) and yang (light). I refer to this God as Tao, representing both
yin and yang. The Mayan name for the reigning God of the fifth
heaven (La) is Hunab K’u, referring to the (beating) heart of the
Milky Way.
In the fourth heaven (Sol), the sun Helios is the primary Creator.
The heavenly bodies surrounding Terra are the rulers in the third
heaven (Fa). The largest of them (apart from Helios) is Jupiter. I
therefore refer to the God on this level as Zeus, which is the name the
Ancient Greeks gave to this giant gas planet.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 21
In the second heaven (Mi), which corresponds to the human base
level, our Mother planet Terra is the primary Creator. Below the hu
man base level, we find the (lunatic) hell of the first ‘heaven’ ruled
by Regent Luna.
1.3 The Geometry of Creation
The geometry at the level of Do from Dominus or The Lord
God, is a perfect circle. The circle represents the oneness,
unity, and wholeness of everything. This is the one and
only circle of level 1.
The geometry at the level of Si from Sidera or Tao, the God
of the Duality, consists of two circles. Each circle’s heart is
at the circumference of the other circle. The
pointy oval in the middle of the geometric shape
is called a vesica. By extending both (membrane)
lines on one side a little longer, the shape of a fish (or pis
ces in Latin) appears. That is why Vesica Piscis is the name
of that ancient symbol.
The geometry at the level of La from Lactea or Hunab
K’u, the God of the Trinity, consists of three circles.
Each circle’s heart is at the crossing of the circumfer
ence of both other circles. The essence of this tri
circular shape is the triangle. The result of connecting
the hearts of these three circles with straight lines is an equilateral
triangle. In the same way, also con
necting the six points where two cir
cumferences cross over each other
(with just three straight lines) results in
an equilateral triangle.



22 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
The geometry at the level of Sol or Helios, the
God of the Hexad, consists of six circles forming
a perfect outer ring. The original circle (of Do) at
level 1 is fully enclosed by the six surrounding
circles, all touching the heart of this first circle.
This is the ring on level 11⁄2, since it is half on top
of the first ring of level 1. Connecting the hearts
of these six outer circles, results in
the shape of the prefect hexagon.
To me, this perfect hexagon is a
fascinating geometric shape. This
two-dimensional form of the hexa
gon is like the shadow of the three
dimensional cube, also called the
hexahedron.
The geometry at the level of Fa from Fata or
fate – the God Zeus – has a new outer ring
of 12 circles, all touching the hearts of a
circle from the previous outer ring (of 6), as
shown in the figure on the left. This new
outer ring is on level 2. In total, there are 19
circles at the geometry of Fa. The shape that
results from cutting all vesica pisces in the
second ring (of level 11⁄2) into half, is the
ancient symbol of the Seal of Solomon,
also known as the Star of David. The two
dimensional shape of
this ancient Seal of
Solomon is like the
shadow of the three
dimensional shape of
the star tetrahedron,
which results from in
tegrating two mirrored
tetrahedrons.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 23
By drawing 12 ‘leafs’ within each of these circles
of the geometry of Fa, and drawing a circle ex
actly around these 19 circles, we get another an
cient symbol. This fascinating symbol is called the
Flower of Life, as shown in the figure to the left.
Ring level number 1 corresponds to the geometry of Do. At the ge
ometry of Sol, we saw a new outer ring (of level number 11⁄2) consist
ing of 6 circles. The following prefect outer ring consists of 12 cir
cles, corresponding to the geometry of Fa (of ring level number 2).

Tone Do Sol Fa ∇
∇∇
∇ Mi Re
Between the tone of Fa and the tone of
Mi, we find the incoming shock. The
figure to the left shows the geometry of
this female shock, having in total 37
circles of which 18 form a new outer
ring (of level 21⁄2).
The geometry at the level of Mi from
microcosm – the Goddess Gaia, or
Mother Terra – has an outer ring of
24 circles (at level 3), as shown in
the figure to the right.
Within this geometry of the 61 cir
cles, we also find a shape of 13 adja
cent circles in three straight lines,



24 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
representing the three orthogonal axis of space (or time). The figure
below on the left accentuates these 13 circles. Connecting the hearts
of all 13 circles result in another fascinating drawing called the Cube
of Metatron. The figure below on the right shows this Cube of Meta
tron. The next paragraph discusses this special cube in more detail.
The geometry at the level of Re from Regina – the Goddess Regent
Luna – has 48 circles in the outer ring (of level 5) of in total 235 cir
cles, as show in the figure below.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 25
In all geometric shapes from the creational level of Sol and down
wards, we find at the outer boundaries the shape of the hexagon. We
find this fascinating shape also in the structure of honeycombs.
Also the Cube of Metatron has this outer shape. The next paragraph
shows how the two-dimensional shadows of all fundamental thee
dimensional shapes are present in the Cube of Metatron. This means
that the hexagon is an essential two-dimensional shape. The hexagon
is the basic, two-dimensional shape of Creation.
1.4 Geometry of Wholeness
There are five three-dimensional shapes consisting of identical sur
faces, sides, and angels. As homage to the Ancient Greek Plato, these
shapes are called Platonic solids. The table below shows these five
perfect, three-dimensional, solid shapes.
Faces : 4 6 8 12 20
Edges : 6 12 12 30 30
Vertices : 4 8 6 20 12
Tetrahedron Hexahedron Octahedron Dodecahedron Icosahedron



26 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
By accenting some of the connecting heart lines of the Cube of Meta
tron, we can find the defining lines of the two-dimensional shadows
of all five Platonic solids. The figure below shows the hexahedron
(or cube), which is the most well-known wholly solid. Both the big
cube and the small one are easy to find.
The ratio of the side lengths of the small cube versus the big cube is
exactly 1: φ (later on, we will discuss this Golden Ratio, symbolized
by φ).
Equally easy, we can find both tetrahedrons in the Cube of Metatron.
Again, we find the same Golden Ratio between the side lengths of
both drawings.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 27
Also the star tetrahedron is present in the Cube of Metatron. Within a
sphere, the star tetrahedron is completely in balance. Another word
for the three-dimensional shape of the star tetrahedron is the Merka
bah. In the figure below, we see on the left hand side the two
dimensional shadow of the female Merkabah (yin), and on the right
hand side the two-dimensional shadow of the male Merkabah (yang),
The figures below depict both octahedrons. Now, the big shape is
exactly twice bigger than the small shape. Most people are familiar
with the upper half of the shape of the octahedron, which is the
pyramid shape.
In order to also show the remaining two Platonic solids, we need to
draw a few auxiliary lines. With the aid of these additional lines, also
the shadows of the decahedron (on the left hand side) and the icosa
hedron (on the right hand side) are visible in the Cube of Metatron,



28 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
as shown in the figures below. In the same way, also the small ver
sions of both Platonic solids can be found.
In this, introductory chapter, we saw the outline of the process of
Creation, that resulted in our present-day, three-dimensional reality.
The next chapters will elaborate on this in more details.

2. Plato Revisited
Plato lived about 24 centuries ago in the region we now call
Greece. Perhaps his best-known legacy is the Allegory of
the Cave.
In Plato’s cave, chained prisoners believe that the projected sha
dows are real forms. They cannot see how the objects held in front of
the fire project black shapes on the cave wall. In their world, only
shadows exist. They only know World No. 3, the Shadow World.
However, the overall reality is much larger than this.
Before the galanty show of the Shadow World, there is World No. 2.
This is the Flow World. Because of the flowing nature of everything
in World No. 2, everything in the projected Shadow World (No. 3.)
also flows. About one century before Plato, Heraclitus summarized
this with his famous words “panta rhei”. The continuous flow in the
second or inner world causes the perpetual movement of the mani
fested shadows in the third or outer world.



30 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
The inner Flow World (No. 2) originates from World No. 1. This is
the Source World. In this core, we find the meaningful code of eve
rything in the overall reality.
With this allegory, Plato tried to show that matter is like a
shadow. Just like a shadow, matter is a (holographic) projection.
Matter is projected energy, and energy is vitalized code.
In order to understand why matter is like a shadow, we first need to
understand the nature of energy. By definition, energy flows. It can
never stand still. The sine wave describes
this continuously flowing movement of en
ergy. The amplitude of this wave represents
the amount of energy, while the wavelength
shows how fast this energy moves. The
shorter the wavelength, the faster is the
movement. The denotation for this energetic
movement is oscillation or vibration.
Please note that we cannot perceive or detect energy directly, just as
Plato explained with his Allegory of the Cave. We can only see
shadows of energy. In this Shadow World, we experience time and
space. The energetic wavelength creates our experience of time,
while the energetic amplitude creates our experience of space.
In general, we experience time as a
one-dimensional movement. For
space however, we distinguish all
three dimension. The picture below
on the left hand side shows the ener
getic movement in two of these di
mensions. In this graphical representation, time becomes circular.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 31
By including also the third dimension, we see that energy moves
spirally (according to our experience of time and space). The picture
above on the right hand side shows this three-dimensional represen
tation of energetic movement.
Let us again place experienced space on the vertical axis, and experi
enced time on the horizontal axis. The picture below shows two en
ergetic movements. The upper one moves twice as fast as the lower
one. After two cycles of the faster wave (and one cycle of the slower
wave), both waves synchronously pass through the zero point from
the same direction.
When we combine both wave patterns into one graph, we see that
these waves also have a shared null point in the middle, together with
ones at the beginning and ending of one wavelength of the slowest
wave. These shared null points are called nodes. The same happens
with a vibrating string between to two fixed points. What we call
matter is in fact an energetic node (a seemingly fixed shadow).
The vibrational ratio between these two waves is 1:2. This is the first
harmonic ratio of the octave. Only with harmonic ratios, regular
nodes emerge. Only when we understand the harmonics of energy,
then we will start to understand the origin of (the illusion of) matter.
The figure below shows another harmonic ratio, which is 2:3, the
ratio of the quint. After three cycles of the faster wave (and two cy



32 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
cles of the slower wave), both waves synchronously pass through the
zero point from the same direction.
Again, both waves have a shared null point in the middle.
The figure below shows the third harmonic ratio, which is 3:4, the
ratio of the quart. After four cycles of the faster wave (and three cy
cles of the slower wave), both waves synchronously pass through the
zero point.
The shared null point in the middle is also present in this third har
monic ratio.
Each of these three harmonic ratios repeatingly create three nodes:
one at the beginning, one in the middle, and one at the end.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 33
The illusion of matter only occurs in the nodes. This is true on each
level, ranging from entities as small as subatomic particles to those
as large as clusters of galaxies. The shells of electrons and the orbits
of planets are nodes in a cosmic symphony of energetic waves. Let
us now investigate this illusion of matter a little further.
2.1 The Illusion of Matter
In trying to understand what matter really is, universities started to
look for the smallest building blocks of these shadows. In the quest
to find these elementary pellets, university scholars first found mole
cules. A molecule is the smallest particle that still possesses all the
characteristic features of the whole.
Next, the division of molecules resulted in even smaller particles,
called atoms. For instance, a water molecule consists of two hydro
gen atoms and one oxygen atom.
For a long time, modern science thought atoms were the most
elementary units. The word atom means ‘indivisible’. This meaning
however, turned out to be inappropriate, since a further division of
atoms resulted in a nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by
orbiting electrons. Later, modern science also discovered antimatter,
consisting of positrons (which are anti-electrons), antiprotons and
antineutrons.
The journey inwards did not stop at the level of protons, neutrons
and electrons. On stepping further down the road of finding the
(hard) core of matter, the division of these three subatomic particles
resulted in quarks. In total, modern science has identified six types



34 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
(or flavors) of quarks, which are called: up, down, strange, charm,
top, and bottom. Each of these also has its negative counterpart,
which are collectively called antiquarks.
Modern science now uses very expensive equipment to smash these
tiny quarks into pieces, hoping that the journey into the heart of mat
ter will stop there. This ongoing exploration, however, is all in vain.
The quest for the smallest particle is a never-ending journey, because
matter does not really exist. Matter is an illusion, because it is actu
ally but a superficial projection of deeper realities. Matter can thus be
considered an illusion, or maya, as is described in the ancient scrip
tures found in India.
By using words like electrons, protons and neutrons (or even quarks)
we think of matter as tiny little pellets. However, this image is mis
leading. An electron, for example, does not exist as a single point,
but travels around the nucleus in a cloud known as an orbital. This
means that an electron is not a tiny little pellet, but an orbiting cloud
with a negative charge.
In order to describe the behaviour of matter down to subatomic
levels, modern science postulated the existence of four non-contact
forces: the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force, the strong
nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force.
The gravitational force describes the attraction of a smaller mass
by a larger mass. In order to mediate this gravitational force, modern
science postulated the existence of particles called gravitons.
The electromagnetic force describes the attraction and repulsion re
sponsible for the structure of atoms and chemical reactions between
atoms. By doing so, the electromagnetic force gives matter strength,
shape, and hardness. In order to mediate this electromagnetic force,
modern science postulated the existence of particles called photons.
The strong nuclear force describes the attraction between the pro
tons and neutrons within a nucleus. In order to mediate this strong
nuclear force, modern science postulated the existence of particles
called gluons.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 35
The weak nuclear force is responsible for the transmutation of
quarks. In order to mediate this weak nuclear force, modern science
postulated the emission and absorption of particles called bosons.
Though gravitons, photons and gluons are postulated as particles,
they have no mass. Modern science invented these hypothetical,
massless particles only to explain the mediation of three of the four
postulated forces. A boson in contrast, has so much mass that it out
weighs 100 protons. All this mass is theoretically required for the
description of the mediation of the weak nuclear force.
Modern science also discovered that all particles also exhibit
wave properties. Because of the wave–particle duality, a particle can
be viewed as a particle or as a wave, but not both simultaneously.
Close examination of the theory of modern science on the nature of
matter shows that it only describes the behavior of matter, and offers
no real explanations for this behavior. This is because modern sci
ence only focuses on the outer world of shadows. It is clearly impos
sible to explain shadows without referring to the origin of these
shadows. Yet modern science neglects or ignores the critical explora
tion of these origins. Ancient science explored the origins of the
physical world within a framework of shadows. Wholly Science
combines the insights of ancient science with the findings of modern
science.
Wholly science starts with understanding the three worlds of
overall reality. Matter only exists in the Shadow World (World No.
3). To explain a shadow, we need to know what projects it. Material
shadows are projected by energetic flows. However, what university
scholars believe to be ‘energy’, is in fact just a shadow of real en
ergy. Energy exists only in the Flow World (World No. 2). Without
understanding the Flow World, science is fiction. That is why I con
sider the theory of postulated forces and particles to be more science
fiction than science fact. Universities have turned science into relig
ion. It excommunicates anyone who does not believe in the so-called
forces of nature and its denominated particles as a blasphemous here
tic.



36 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
The objective of this book is to free mainstream science from its nar
row-minded dogmas. By rediscovering the fundamental insights
known in ancient science, a Wholly Science will emerge.
2.2 Harmonic Numbers
As the previous chapter showed, Wholly Science is the study of the
(harmonic) process of Creation. Holy or Sacred means that it is from
beyond our ‘normal’ world (World No. 3). It originates from the su
pernatural or metaphysical world beyond the common, shadowy
world. When we understand the Whole of Reality including the
worlds before (or beyond) the Shadow World, then we become fa
miliar with the origin of everything that some consider to be Holy or
Sacred.
The Source World is the world of the Lord, the God of the Oneness.
This is the tone Do from Dominus. The Flow World is the world of
Tao, the God of the Duality. This is the tone Si from Sedera. Thirdly,
the Shadow World is the world of Hunab K’u, the God of the Trinity.
This is the tone La from Lactea. The figure below depicts the essence
of each of three concentric circles of reality in an identifying symbol.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 37
Next, we can use the contrast between black and white to stress the
dynamics between yin and yang in these identifying symbols, as
shown in the next figure.
The symbol of oneness represents the inner circle of the Source
World. In the second circle around this core, we find the duality of
yin and yang. In the third and outer shadowy circle, we find the trin
ity in everything that exists (as a temporary shadow). The figure be
low shows the essence of these three concentric circles.
The circle (or the sphere) symbolizes the reality. The square (or the
cube) symbolizes our understanding of this reality. In order to under
stand the essence of oneness in the Source Word, a single thinking



38 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
square is sufficient. However, in order to fully understand the dy
namics of the duality in the Flow Word, we require four thinking
squares, each corresponding to a type of energy (Earth, Water, Air,
and Fire). The following chapter will discuss this in full detail.
Thirdly, in order to fully understand the essence of the trinities in
the Shadow Word, we require nine thinking squares. These are for
instance the ciphers 1 up 9. Numerology shows us that the essence of
everything in the shadowy reality corresponds to one of these nine
ciphers. These are the same ciphers we saw earlier around the ancient
symbol of the Enneagram.
The figure above shows these thinking squares corresponding to the
three concentric circles of reality. The figure below shows these
squares on the same ‘scale’ as the corresponding circles.
Also here, we can use the contrast between black and white to stress
the dynamics between yin and yang in these identifying symbols, as
shown in the next figure.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 39
As stated at the beginning of this book, Wholly Science studies har
mony based on three pillars: numbers, music, and geometry. The
numerical essence of the Source World is 1. Of the Flow World, this
numerical essence is 2. Thirdly, the numerical essence of the Shadow
World is 3. Both the summation as the multiplication of these three
numbers is 6. Perhaps that is the reason why the hexagon is such a
fundamental shape in the process of Creation, as we saw earlier.
The next chapter discusses a fifth
type of energy (Aether), wich origi
nates from the Source World. To
gether with the four types of energy
from the Flow World, these are the
five energies, casting the five ele
ments as their shadows in the outer
ring of reality.
By adding up 4 and 9, we get
13. This is the number of the com
bined wholly and semitones within
the unity of an octave. Under the
bottom line, we find the total of 18.
This number equals a trinity of
hexads (that is: 6 6 6; have you ever
heard of this number before?) or both a yin and a yang Enneagram.
All the numbers mentioned in the above figure, will come back fre
quently in the following chapters.



40 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
3. The Forbidden Apple of Knowledge
The essence of the inner world of ener
gies is that energies always flow. That is
why I call the world of energies the Flow
World. In order to understand the Flow
World, we need to know the characteris
tics of the flow. The Bible’s book of
Genesis refers to the hidden nature of
energetic flow as the Forbidden Apple of
Knowledge. The figure to the right
shows this ‘apple’, which has been kept secret since the beginning.
In the inner part of the apple-shaped movement, the
energy spirals downwards. In the apple’s outer part, the
energy spirals upwards. This is an infinite flow of con
tinuously spiraling energy. All energy spirals up and
down along this apple shape.
Exactly in the middle of the apple, the inward spiraling motion
changes into spiraling outwards. This very center of the energetic
apple is the null point (or zero point). When we assume the perspec
tive of this null point, we perceive the incoming spiral as counter
clockwise, and the outgoing as clockwise. To distinguish between
inwards and outwards spiraling energy, ancient science uses the con
cepts of yin and yang. The inward spiraling (towards the center)
called yin, brings energy in and represents a positive charge. The
outward spiraling (away from the centre) called yang, sends energy
out and represents a negative charge.
To symbolize the yin movement, I
use a white (meaning positive) trian
gle pointed down (meaning inwards).
To symbolize the yang movement, I
use a black (meaning negative) tri
angle pointed up (meaning outwards).
At the end of the inner outward spiraling movement, the energy
reverses into an outer inward spiraling motion towards the outer cen
tre of the apple, which we could refer to as the apple’s equator.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 41
While passing this equator, the energy changes again into an outer
outward spiraling motion. Finally, at the end of the outer outward
spiral, the movement changes back into an inner inward spiral.
The Forbidden Apple of Knowledge shows four different phases
of spiraling energy. Starting at the apple’s top, the first phase is the
inner inward spiraling movement. This matches with what ancient
science refers to as Earth. The ancient-science reference to Air fits
with the inner outward spiraling movement. Next, the outer inward
spiraling phase corresponds to the concept of Water in ancient sci
ence. Fourthly, the concept of Fire in ancient science refers to the
outer outward spiraling phase.
The symbols used by ancient
science (as shown in the figure to
the right) perfectly match the direc
tion of each phase, as the figure
below shows. The horizontal inner lines in the ancient symbols for
Earth and Air indicate that these two symbols represent the inner
phases.






42 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
The spiraling movement of energy has no beginning and no ending.
Energy spirals infinitely. The figure below shows the four phases of
infinitely spiraling energy plotted on the shape of the symbol for in
finity (∞).
Modern science postulates four different forces of nature, as de
scribed in the previous chapter. Ancient science distinguishes be
tween four types of energy. The hypothesis of Wholly Science is that
both are the same. Wholly Science combines modern knowledge
with ancient wisdom. By doing so, the outline for the Grand Unified
Theory of Everything, also referred to as the Grand Unified Theory
(GUT) or simply Theory of Everything (ToE), becomes easily clear.
For more than a century, modern science unsuccessfully tried to con
struct such an overall theory. I hope that modern scientists are able to
upgrade their thinking to the level of Wholly Science.
The inner energy movement of going inwards (Earth) clearly
matches the effect of gravity. Next, electromagnetic radiation
matches with the inner energy movement of going outwards (Air).
Thirdly, the strong nuclear force is oriented towards the centre, just
as the energetic spiral movement of Water is. Fourth and finally, the
weak nuclear force is oriented away from the centre, just as the ener
getic spiral movement of Fire, causing the phenomenon of decay
(meaning disintegration).
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 43
Some modern scientists believe that the electromagnetic force and
the weak nuclear force are both aspects of a single force they called
the electroweak force. In fact both ‘forces’ refer to shadow effects
caused by outward spiraling energies (called yang in ancient sci
ence).
Modern Science Ancient Science Wholly Science
Gravitational Force Earth Inner Inward
Electromagnetic Force Air Inner Outward
Strong Nuclear Force Water Outer Inward
Weak Nuclear Force Fire Outer Outward
This means that the four forces of modern science are not really
forces. They are descriptions of shadow effects of the outer world
(World No. 3). In the same way, the four types of energy described
by modern science phenomena are of the Shadow World, and not of
the Flow World (World No. 2). Kinetic energy, chemical energy,
magnetic energy, and electric energy are shadows of the four phases
of spiraling energy (as summarized in the table below). All these
‘energies’ describe in fact phenomena related to matter. Kinetic en
ergy refers to the ability of matter to move. Chemical energy
emerges from the structural arrangement of atoms or molecules. This
means that nuclear energy is a kind of chemical energy. Next, mag
netic energy describes the attraction and repulsion between particles.
Fourthly, electric energy describes the transfer of charges between
matter.
Modern Science Ancient Science Wholly Science
Kinetic Energy Earth Motion of Matter
Chemical Energy Air Structure of Matter
Magnetic Energy Water Interaction between Matter
Electric Energy Fire Transfer between Matter
Ancient science reveals that all phenomena (in the Shadow World)
result from the continuous interaction between yin and yang. This
dual nature shows itself clearly in both poles of magnetic of electric



44 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
current. For chemical energy, it creates the difference between im
plosion and explosion. In the case of nuclear or atomic energy, this
duality creates the difference between fusion and fission. Fourthly,
the difference between gravitation and levitation is the expression of
yin and yang within kinetic energy.
Modern Science Yin Yang
Kinetic Energy Gravitation Levitation
Chemical Energy Implosion Explosion
Magnetic Energy South Pole North Pole
Electric Energy Positive Pole Negative Pole
The Forbidden Apple of Knowledge shows the correct sequence of
Earth, Air, Water, and Fire. The same sequence is also present in the
Zodiac (as we saw before) and in the Mayan calendar called the
Tzol’kin, as the next chapter on the dynamics of time will show. The
Forbidden Apple of Knowledge also shows that Fire and Air are both
yang energies, and Water and Earth both yin energies. This brings us
again to the Bible, since the prayer that starts with the words ‘our
Father who art in Heaven’ is actually an homage to the yang ener
gies. Our Father refers to Father Helios, the central sun in our solar
system. Father Helios (full of plasma) represents the yang energy of
Fire. Similarly, Heaven refers to the yang energy of Air. This means
that Fire and Air are the two yang energies honored by the prayer of
our Father who art in Heaven.

The Essene Gospel of Peace contains a prayer that starts with the
words ‘our Mother who art in Earth’. As this gospel is not part of the
Bible, few people know of this prayer. Our Mother in this prayer
refers to our mother planet called Terra. To address her, we also use
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 45
the name of Gaia, which literally means ‘Mother Terra’ (as said be
fore). Our Mother Terra consists mostly of water. Without water, no
life is possible on Terra. Therefore, our Mother refers to Water. Next,
Earth simply refers to Earth. This means that Water and Earth are the
two yin energies honored by the prayer of our Mother who art in
Earth.
In the (64) hexagrams (meaning ‘six lines’) of the I Ching (the
ancient Book of Changes), yang is represented by a single long line
(similar to the sign for negative: -), and yin by two short lines (just as
the sign for positive constitutes of two lines: +).
The well-known symbol of Tao (the God of Si) also captures the four
phases of spiraling energy. The white yin and the black yang are per
fectly in balance in this ancient symbol of Tao. The black upper part
in this symbol as shown to the left represents Fire, while
the white lower part represents Water. These are the
larger, outer movements of spiraling energy. Both small
circles represent the smaller inner movement of Air (the
small black circle) and Earth (the small white circle).
The symbol of the Tao shows that the big black drop (Fire) disap
pears in the small white hole (Earth). Next, out of the small black
hole (Air) the big white drop (Water) appears, that gradually turns
over into the big black drop (Fire). The symbol of the Tao therefore
shows the spiraling dynamic of the Forbidden Apple of Knowledge.
Finally, we find another example of the shadows created by the four
phases of spiraling energy in the four states of matter, each corre
sponding to a different heaven, as shown in the table below.

3.1 Dynamics of Time
The projected Shadow World (World No. 3) has three metadimen
sions: space, time, and identity (which is again a trinity). Each of
these metadimensions in itself is also a trinity, and has therefore
three dimensions, as the table below shows.
Space Time Identity Type
Width Day Body ~
Depth Year Soul ∇
∇∇
∇
Height Aeon Spirit ∆
∆∆
∆
All three metadimensions are essential. The interaction between
these three metadimensions creates the experience of reality (in the
Shadow World). Experiencing reality in the Shadow World requires
a conscious identity, a moment in time and a place in space. Without
an identity, space, or time, there is nothing. Therefore, we can define
each of these three metadimensions as a function of both others:
Space = function ( Time , Identity )
Time = function ( Space , Identity )
Identity = function ( Space , Time )
Everything in the Shadow World is a projection from the dynamics
in the Flow World (World No. 2). In order to understand the nature
of space, time, and identity, we need to understand from where these
shadowy phenomena originate. Let us take a closer look at the three
metadimensions of our reality.
Everything in our holographic Shadow World is subjective by nature
since the observing identity is a defining metadimension of that very
same reality. Many people believe that our (shadowy) world will
change from 3D via 4D to 5D, where the D stands for Dimension.
While some actually do think that this means the birth of additional
orthogonal directions, I see these ‘dimensions’ as frequency domains
in which all projections have a similar degree of density. Below, we
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 47
will discuss this in more detail. To me, the ‘D’ therefore stands for
vibrational Density.
We know that everything is a vibration, which means an oscillation
frequency. To measure this vibration, we need space, time, and iden
tity. In order to have a point of reference in our subjective reality,
modern science uses the speed of light. This speed is of course space
divided by time, and light is the identity.
Each identity is a trinity. Each atom is a trinity of protons, neu
trons and electrons. Next, each of these subatomic particles is a trin
ity of three quark orientations (up or down, strange or charm, and top
or bottom). In the same way, each human is a trinity of body, soul,
and spirit. The body corresponds with the level of our common con
sciousness. Underneath this common level, we find the level of our
sub-consciousness, corresponding to our soul. Above the awareness
level of our (common) consciousness, we find the level of our super
consciousness, also known as our spirit.
Just like space and identity,
time also has three defining
dimensions. Time is not
linear like space, but cycli
cal. In fact, time consists of
three cycles: a daily cycle, a
yearly cycle, and a very
large cycle, lasting twelve aeons, as the remaining of this paragraph
will explain.
The four phases of spiraling energy are clearly present in our experi
ence of daily time. Night is the period from midnight until sunrise.
This period matches the energetic phase of Earth. The morning pe
riod from sunrise until noon (or midday) matches the energetic phase
of Air. The period directly after noon is called afternoon and lasts
until sunset. This period matches the energetic phase of Water.
Fourthly, the evening period from sunset until sunrise matches the
energetic phase of Fire.



48 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
Our clock divides the period from midnight until midday into twelve
hours. The first hour starts at midnight and the twelfth ends at mid
day. Meridiem is Latin for mid (meri) day (diem).
These are the twelve hours before (or ante in Latin)
meridiem, abbreviated as ‘am’. The abbreviation of
‘pm’ means post (meaning after) meridiem. The
period from midday until midnight also lasts twelve
hours. In full daily circle, the analog clock goes
round twice. The first round represents the inner spiraling phases of
Earth and Air. Next, the second round corresponds to the outer spi
raling phases of Water and Fire.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 49
Time is a function of space and identity, as stated in the beginning of
this paragraph. In order to determine the time of day, we need to
know both the identity that experiences this time and the location in
space of this identity. The relative position of this identity on the
rotating crust of Mother Terra related to the direction towards Father
Helios determines the time of day for this identity on that location.
The rotation of Mother Terra around her vertical axis causes the ex
perience of the four phases of a natural day. In fact, the sunlight
rhythm rules the experience of time on a daily basis.
Sunlight also rules the yearly experience of time. Let us refer to
the daily period from sunrise until sunset as lightness, and daily pe
riod from sunset until sunrise as darkness. At the day of the winter
solstice, there is maximum darkness and minimum lightness. The
opposite is true for the day of the summer solstice, with a maximum
amount of lightness and a minimum amount of darkness. Exactly in
the middle between both solstices, we find the equinoxes. Both at the
vernal equinox and the autumnal equinox, the length of the lightness
period and the length of the darkness period are precisely equal.



50 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
In a period of one full orbit of the rotating Mother Terra around (the
also rotating) Father Helios we experience four seasons due to this
eternal ‘battle’ between lightness and darkness. These four seasons
(each lasting 13 weeks) fully match with the four phases of spiraling
energy, as shown in the table below.
Energetic Phase Daily Phase Yearly Phase
Earth Night Winter
Air Morning Spring
Water Afternoon Summer
Fire Evening Autumn
As Mother Terra orbits around Father Helios, the background of stars
behind Helios as seen from Terra’s surface, changes each day nearly
one degree of arc. The twelve constellations of the Zodiac result
from dividing the full circle of this background star view into seg
ments of thirty degrees each.
Experienced from the northern hemisphere, the summer solstice
marks the beginning of the period of Cancer. This is the day of
maximum lightness on the northern hemisphere (and maximum
darkness on the southern hemisphere). At noon on that day, the light
from Father Helios shines perpendicular on the Tropic of Cancer.
Seen from this northern circle parallel to the equator, Helios is then
exactly in the zenith position. In the figure below, Helios is at that
moment in time at the left hand side of Terra.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 51
At the opposite day of the annual orbit of Terra around Helios, the
winter solstice marks the beginning of the period of Capricorn. This
is the day of maximum lightness on the southern hemisphere (and
maximum darkness on the northern hemisphere). At noon on that
day, the light from Father Helios shines perpendicular on the Tropic
of Capricorn. Seen from this southern circle parallel to the equator,
Helios is then exactly in the zenith position. In the figure below, He
lios is at that moment in time at the right hand side of Terra.
The ecliptic is the two-dimensional plane of Terra’s orbit around
Helios. Terra’s axis of rotation makes an arc of nearly 231⁄2 degrees
with the ecliptic (23 degrees and 27 minutes, to be precise). The offi
cial name for this axial tilt is the obliquity of the ecliptic. Because of
this tilted axis, the experience of the daily alternation of darkness and
lightness differs for all locations, except those with latitude beyond
the polar circle. On those locations, Helios does not rise in the win
ter, and does not set in the summer.
The twelve constellations also preserve the right sequence of the four
energetic phases, as shown in the table below.
Fire Earth Air Water
Aries Taurus Gemini Cancer
Leo Virgo Libra Scorpio
Sagittarius Capricorn Aquarius Pisces



52 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
Every day again, the ball of Fire called Helios describes a semicircle
in the sky as seen from Terra’s surface. Every morning, Helios rises
in the east, and every evening he sets in the west. We do not precieve
the other half of the full circle movement of Helios, because the other
semicircle is below our horizon.
At the day of both the vernal equinox and the autumnal equinox,
the visible a semicircle of Helios last exactly half a natural day,
which is 12 hours. I refer to this (neutral) semicircle as the zero
semicircle.
Every day after the autumnal equinox, this semicircle very gradu
ally keeps on shrinking. Therefore, both positions of sunrise and sun
set crawl a little more to the south (as seen from the northern hemi
sphere, where most of humanity lives). At the same time, Helios
climbs a little less as high in the sky as the previous day. This shrink
ing semicircle causing darkness to increase and lightness to decrease
is continuing until the winter solstice. From that day, the darkness is
no longer gaining in strength. During a trinity of three natural hours,
the sun Helios describes exactly the same (smallest) semicircle in the
sky. In order to describe this yearly event, we could say that the
Light-bringer or the Messiah (meaning the sun Helios) is dead for
three days. In Latin, this is the solstice, where sol means sun (as said
before) and stice means ‘standstill’.
As we saw earlier, Hunab K’u (being the beating heart of the
Milky Way) is the God on the level of Creation right above the level
of Helios. So we can say that the God Hunab K’u is the Father of
Helios. That means that the Messiah (meaning the sun Helios) is the
sun of God. The sun is the son (of God), and at the same time is He
lios our Father (who art in Heaven).
Both Messiah and Christ mean ‘the anointed one’, which refers to
the (local) ruler. Helios is the ruler of our solar system. This means
that the sun Helios is the Christ, the Messiah, and the son of God.
And his sunlight is the healing plasma energy, which we could also
call the Holy Spirit. Therefore, Helios is the trinity of Father, the Sun
and the Holy Spirit.
In the picture below, the smallest semicircle we see during the
day of the winter solstice, is marked with the minus sign (-), and the
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 53
largest semicircle, appearing on the day of the summer solstice, is
marked with the plus sign (+).
After being dead for three days, on December 25th, the Messiah rises
up from the dead and starts to move higher in the sky every next day
(until the summer solstice). By drawing a straight line from the three
stars (also known as the Three Kings) in the Belt of Orion through
the star Sirius (which the Kings followed), the crossing of that line
with the horizon marked exactly the location of the rising Helios (or
(re-) birth of Christ) on December 25th. The biblical version is just a
personalized version of this celestial dynamics.
Many people mistakenly believe that Terra’s orbit around Helios is a
circle. Neither is it an ellipse, because Helios is not in the center of
this orbit. This orbit actually has the shape of an egg. In the picture
below, the direction of Helios’ movement (with an incredible speed
about 250 kilometers per second) is to right hand side.
The beginning of the new year (on January 1st) Terra is about at
her closest the point to Helios. This orbital position is called the
‘perihelion’. It takes Helios only seven natural days to cross that dis



54 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
tance (147,100,000 kilometers). Six months after perihelion Terra
reached the ‘aphelion’, where her distance to Helios is the largest.
The difference between both distances (peri- and aphelion) is 3.3%.
In total, the yearly dark period (of autumn and winter) is one week
shorter than the yearly light period (of spring and summer). In a leap
year, this difference is six days. The extra day then occurs in the
shortest season (which is the winter).
Our experience of time combines the daily cycle (of morning, after
noon, evening, and night) with the annual cycle (of spring, summer,
winter, and autumn). In this experience of time, a full 360 degrees
circle of the daily cycle takes nearly the same amount of time as a 1
degree of arc progress in the annual cycle.
There is a third cycle of time. Plato referred
to this very long cycle as the Great Year. A 1
degree of arc progress in this Great Year cy
cle takes 72 years. The cause for this long
cycle is the tumbling movement of Terra’s
rotation axis. Currently this axis points north
in the direction of a bright star called Polaris
(or the Pole Star). However, about 13 millen
nia ago the alignment of Terra’s axis of rota
tion was with another bright star called Vega
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 55
in the constellation Lyra.
The rotational direction of the Great Year tumble is the reverse of the
yearly circle. That is why the Great Year tumble is called the Preces
sion of the Equinoxes, meaning a reversed succession of the vernal
and autumnal equinoxes.
1 Great Year = 1 × 25.920 Years =
4 Great Seasons = 4 × 6.480 Years =
12 Aeons = 12 × 2.160 Years
During a full circle of the Great Year, Terra’s axis of rotation bends
over to each of the twelve constellations. Dividing this full circle into
four quarters results in the four Great Seasons of three Aeons (or
ages) each. The Great Winter starts with the Aeon of Taurus, which
is an Earth sign. Next, the Great Spring starts with the Aeon of
Aquarius, which is an Air sign. The Great Summer starts with the
Aeon of Scorpio, which is a Water sign. Fourthly, the Great Autumn
starts with the Aeon of Leo, which is a Fire sign. The figure below
shows the ordering of the twelve aeons in the cycle of a Great Year,
with an emphasis on the signs of the starting aeons per Great Season.



56 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
Before, we saw that the essential sequence of Earth, Air, Water, and
Fire is present in the yearly ordering of the twelve constellations.
Now, we see that this same correct sequence is present in the starting
Aeon of the Great Seasons. Below, we see the very same ordering in
the Mayan calendar called the Tzol’kin, literally meaning the count
ing (tzol) of natural days (kin). The Tzol’kin assigns each natural day
to one of twenty Signs in a fixed sequence, as shown in the table be

3.2 The Clock of Giza
The previous paragraph mentioned the third dimension of time, re
ferred to as the Great Year by Plato. But what is the cause of this
temporal dynamics. The cause for the first dimension of time is the
rotation of Terra around her own (tilted) axis. The cause for the sec
ond dimension of time is Terra’s orbit around Helios. In the third
dimension of time, Terra’s tilted axis wobbles. In this third temporal
dimension, Terra is like tumbling humming top. We find the cause
for this relative very slow wobbling in the orbit of Helios.
In the period of the Great Year, Helios completes a full orbit. In
the middle of this orbital circle there is no superstar. We only find
there empty space. Helios’ orbital movement is a result from Helios’
energetic dance with his bigger brother Sirius (officially called Sirius
A, since this star is accompanied by a white dwarf star, which is offi
cially called Sirius B, known by the Dogon People in northeast Af
rica as Po Tolo). Sirius (A) is nearly the closest star to Helios, and it
is the most brightest one we can see from the surface of Terra.
On January 1st, Terra is exactly in between Helios and Sirius. That is
the reason our year starts on that moment. A half year later, we find
another alignment of Terra, Helios and Sirius. Seen from the surface



58 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
of Terra, Helios and Sirius fully align on July 4th. That is why the
Founding Fathers of the United States of America selected that spe
cific day as the most important national day of celebration.
The number 6 plays a mayor role in
understanding both time and space.
That is why both the 24 hours per day
and the 12 months per year are multi
ples of six. Also the number of years
within the period of a Great Year is a
multiples of six. Dividing 25,920 by 6
gives 4320. This number of 4320 help
us to understand the amount of years
per type of Yuga mentioned in the Hindu philosophy. In total, there
are four types of Yuga. The total length of these four Yuga’s is
4,320,000 years, and the base length of each Yuga is 432,000 years,
as shown in the table below. I think that these numbers are simple
references to the length of one sixth of the Great Year.
Kali Yuga 1 × 432,000 years Iron Great Winter
Dvapara Yuga 2 × 432,000 years Bronze Great Autumn
Treta Yuga 3 × 432,000 years Silver Great Summer
Satya Yuga 4 × 432,000 years Gold Great Spring
Just like the daily time, and the yearly time, also the cycle of the
Great Year has four parts. During the dark half of this cycle, meaning
first the Bronze Age and then the Iron Age, the distance between
Helios and Sirius is relatively great. During the light half of this cy
cle, meaning first the Golden Age and then the Silver Age, the dis
tance between Helios and Sirius is relatively small.
The start of the Silver Age is like the summer solstice in the
yearly time. At that moment in the Great Year, the distance between
Helios and Sirius is the closest, exactly halfway the vesica piscis.
The start of the Iron Age is like the winter solstice in the yearly time.
At that moment in the Great Year, the distance between Helios and
Sirius is the greatest.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 59
The start of the Golden Age is like the vernal equinox in the yearly
time. That is the moment the semicycle of light in the Great Year
starts. The start of the Bronze Age is like the autumnal equinox in the
yearly time. That is the moment the semi-cycle of darkness in the
Great Year starts.
As we saw before, the Golden Age starts with the Aeon of
Aquarius. Therefore, Aquarius symbolizes the rebirth of Light in the
Great Year. At the opposite position, we see the Bronze Age starts
with the Aeon of Leo, symbolizing the rebirth of Darkness in the
Great Year.
Also the Bible shows the rela
tion of the Aeon of Aquarius
and the relation with the light.
In Mark 14 we read: “And he
sent two of his disciples and
said to them, "Go into the city,
and a man carrying a jar of
water will meet you. Follow
him, and wherever he enters,
say to the master of the house,
...”. The man carrying a jar of
water is a reference to Aquar
ius, which is Latin for the water carrier. According to my calculation,
we will (re-) enter the house of Aquarius in the year 2012. In this
house we will celebrate the Passover, which is the literal translation
of the Hebrew word Pasach (or Pesach). What we then have ‘passed
over’ is the semi-cycle of Darkness in which the Pharaohs (meaning:
The Powers That Be) tried to fully control life on this planet.
To provide us in the present-day time with a clock that shows exactly
when we will re-enter the house of Aquarius, the pyramids on the
Giza plateau in Egypt were built. This was done many thousands of
years before the first dynasty of a Pharaoh in Egypt. The Ancient
Egyptians had no knowledge of Sacred Geometry. However, the
Great Pyramid is nowadays a classic example of the application of



60 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
Wholly Geometry. This clearly means that the Ancient Egyptians did
not build the Giza pyramids.
The Ancient Egyptians had no knowledge of the fixed ratio between
the circumference of a circle and its diameter. Nowadays we refer to
this constant as π (Pi), which is transcendental number since its deci
mal representation never ends, never repeats itself, and it cannot be
caught into a scientific determination.
The Pyramid Builders based their unit of measurement on π. This
unit, called the cubit, is exactly π/6 meters. The Pyramid Builders
divided π by the amount of six (meaning the hexad) to honor the sun
Helios, also called Ra. Now we can understand the word Py-Ra-Mid.
Py refers to π, Ra to the God of the Hexad (/6), and Mid is the mid
between Dark and Light.
We can find the proof of the π/6 meters length of a cubit in the
sizes of the Great Pyramid. When we subtract the original height
from the summation of the width and the depth of the Great Pyramid,
the result is exactly 100π. Both the width and the depth of the Great
Pyramid are 440 cubit, and the original height was 280 cubit. These
sizes were selected very thoughtfully, since dividing the summation
of the width and the depth by the original height (resulting in 22/7) is
also a very good approximation of π.
By dividing the hypotenuse (that is the length
from the middle of a base side to the apex) by the
length from the middle of a base side to the mid
dle of the pyramid’s base, then the outcome is φ
(Phi, the Golden Ratio).
The Pyramid Builders also new the exact sizes of the planet Terra.
The height of the Great Pyramid represents the average radius of
Terra’s sphere. The scale they used was 1 : 43,200. With the same
scale the circumference of the Great Pyramid’s square base repre
sents the equatorial circumference Terra. Please note that the current
scaling is no longer precisely this number, since Terra is constantly
growing (which is another fact the universities try to hide from us). I
hope that is clear to you why the Pyramid Builders used a hundred
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 61
times 432 for this scale. It is of course a reference to the precession
cycle, in which one sixth (divining by 6, just like π/6) equals 4320
years (which is ten times 432). Using a scale ten times a big (mean
ing 1 : 4320) would clearly have been overdone.
The base length of 440 cubits was selected for
probably another reason as well. When we subtract
the length of the circle that fits exactly within the
square base of the Great Pyramid from the circle
that fits exactly around the Great Pyramid, then the
result is 299.7912558. This number is almost ex
actly the same as the speed of light (in vacuum), namely 299.792458
(in million meters per second). Did the Pyramid Builders choose 440
cubits to refer to their knowledge of the speed of light?
Please note that the Pyramid Builders used the meter as a base for
measurement. The meter is therefore an ancient unit of measurement
humanity only recently rediscovered. Based on this unit, Terra’s pre
sent-day circumference is about 40 million meters, and the speed of
light is about 300 million meters per second.
Before I will show the Giza Clock, I want to point out the meaning of
the locations of the chambers in the Great Pyramid. Also these loca
tions were thoughtfully chosen by the Pyramid Builders. The cham
bers in the Great Pyramid form a representation of the top three of
the endocrine glands in the human body. The energetic function of
each endocrine glands corresponds to the working of a chakra, as
will be explained in one of the following chapters. The back of the
King’s Chamber corresponds to the pineal gland, which enables us to
see through the illusion of matter in the Shadow World. Apparently,
the Pyramid Builders also knew about the chakra’s end the working
of the endocrine system (many thousands of years ago!).
Now, let us focus on the whole of the Giza plateau. Most people
know about the Great Pyramid, the Great Sphinx and two more
(great) pyramids. However, there are in total also 8 smaller pyramids
accompanying the greater pyramids. The figure below shows a map



62 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
of these 11 pyramids at the west side of the Great Sphinx. The
squares with the inner crosses are all pyramids, and the rectangle
with rounded corners marks the location of the Great Sphinx.
Let us count the smaller pyramids, ei
ther from left to right (meaning from
west to east), or from bottom up
(meaning from south to north). First we
count 3, then 1, and then 4. These are
the first three ciphers of π. Since π is
related to the circle, the Pyramid
Builders used these amounts of smaller
pyramids to indicate that there is a hid
den circle on the Giza plateau.
Lets us draw that hidden circle on the map:
Not only do we find a perfect circle touching the
corners of three pyramids and the bottom of the
Great Sphinx, within that circle exactly fits a
square perfectly inclosing the three greater pyra
mids. The southwest corner where the square
touches the circle is a very important point in
understanding the Clock of Giza. When we draw
a line from that point to the Great Sphinx’s tale,
we see that this line goes straight through the
heart off the smallest greater pyramid. In the
same way does the diagonal from the square go
straight through the heart off the greater pyra
mid in the middle.
To cut a long story short, the line from the southwest corner to the
Great Sphinx’s tale is one of the six constituting lines of the Seal of
Solomon, hidden on the Giza plateau. This seal cuts the circumfer
ence of the circle into six equal parts. The full circle represents the
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 63
Great Year lasting 25,920 years. One sixth of this is, as we saw be
fore, 4320 years.
The position of the Great Sphinx allows us understand the timing
of this clock. The Great Sphinx was built many thousands of years
before the pyramids, so the Pyramid Builders used the Great Sphinx
to indicate the timing. We find this timing in the shafts the Pyramid
Builders created in the Great Pyramid. These shafts all point to stars
with a clear relation with the
precession cycle. The last time,
the alignment of the four shafts
with these four stars was per
fect, was, according to my in
vestigation, 2309 BC. This
means that the semi-cycle of
Darkness started 10,949 BC,
and that the semi-cycle of
Light will start in the year
2012 (AD).
Thanks to the work of Robert Bauval, we can understand that the
three greater pyramids represent the three stars in the Belt of Orion
(these are also the three Biblical Kings, following the bright star of
Sirius). The brightest star in Orion’s Belt is nowadays called Alnitak
(of Alnitah). The Great Pyramid (below) is representing Alnitak
(above). Also the southern shaft from the King’s chamber is designed
to point towards Alnitak (once every 25,920 years). We could say
that via this shaft, the Great Pyramid is pointed towards himself.
Not only the three greater pyramids represent the stars from Orion’s
Belt, the trinities of the smaller pyramids do the very same. Around
10,949 the stars from Orion’s Belt rose horizontally above the hori
zon, in the exact same way as the smaller pyramids are placed on the
Giza plateau near that represented moment in time. Nowadays, the
stars in the Belt of Orion rise vertically above the horizon, in the ex
act same way as the smaller pyramids that are placed east of the
Great Pyramid. If you want, you can watch me explain all this is

3.3 Dynamics of Creation
To the Mayans, the Tzol’kin is a Holy Calendar. This Wholly Calen
dar indeed helps us to see beyond the world of shadows. It assigns
each natural day not only to a Sign (as shown at the end of the previ
ous chapter), but also to a Tone. In total, there are 13 Tones, each
corresponding to a phase in the process of Creation. To symbolize
each Tone, the Mayans simply use dots, and for every fifth dot a line.
The ordering of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire also appears in the se
quence of the 13 Tones. To show this, we need to understand the
energetic function of each spiraling phase, as mentioned in the table
below.
Yin = IN Earth INitiating
Yang = OUT Air OUTlining
Yin = IN Water Filling IN
Yang = OUT Fire Carrying OUT
The first phase of each process of creation is taking initiative to start
this process. The next phase results in an outline of the process and
the intended creation. Filling in the details happens in the third phase.
The fourth and final phase of creating is carrying it out according to
the results of the previous phases.
In total, the sequence of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire repeats itself 3
times in the series of the 13 Tones. The meaning of the number 3 is
wholly, and this number is therefore widely present in all holy (or
Wholly) writings. That is also the correct meaning of the concept of
the Trinity. Trinity simply means that every whole is a unity of three
defining aspects. For example, the world we experience daily (World
No. 3) is a Trinity of space, time, and identity. The Whole Reality is
another Trinity, namely the Whole of the Source World, the Flow
World, and the Shadow World.

The 13 Tones follow an alternating yin yang rhythm, as shown in the
tables in the beginning of this chapter. The figure below shows this
rhythm as a wave pattern. In total, this Wave of Creation consists of
7 yin Tones and 6 yang Tones. The upper (or positive) white (yin)
tones are also referred to as Days, and the lower (or negative) black
(yang) tones as Night. Now we see again the 7 Days of Creation,
with 6 Nights of Creation in between these 7 Days.
The 7 Days of Creation are visible as the growing stages from seed to
fruit. Day 1 is the stage of Seed, the start of the growing process. On
Day 1, it attracts what it needs for growth. Next, the opening of the



66 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
sees occurs at Night 1. On Day 2, the process of germination acti
vates the seed. The germ defines the growth process on Night 2. This
completes the first full cycle of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire.
The second cycle starts on Day 3 when a boom appears above the
soil. Now the process of growing is in the open, so to say. The func
tion of this fifth tone is enacting, resulting in the first spur (or boom).
Further arrangement takes place in Night 3. Next, on Day 4, the
Leaves appear, enabling the synchronization with the environment.
On Night 4, also the second cycle of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire
reaches completion, resulting in harmony.
The third and final full cycle starts on Day 5 when the flowers
appear, meant to mobilize insects for pollination. After this, on Night
5, all ingredients are manifest. This is at Tone 10. We are used to
counting until 10, but the Mayas knew that there are three more
numbers in the total process of Creation. At Day 6 the flowers re
lease their petals, leaving the receptacle. Completion of the third and
final cycle takes place at Night 6.
At Day 7, the receptacle transcends into fruit. Each peace of fruit
is also full of seeds, which brings us back to the beginning of a fol
lowing process of Creation.

The series of the 13 Tones of Creation forms one overall wave. The
intensity of this wave gradually grows and peaks somewhere be
tween Day 5 and Night 5. Then, over the hill, the intensity dimin
ishes again.
The 13 Tones of Creation also rule the stages in a natural human life,

Tone 5 (or Day 3) corresponds to birth of the new creation. As
shown before, this is in fact the start of the second cycle of Earth,
Air, Water, and Fire. The first cycle starts with the attraction force
between both (future) parents, desiring to unite. The third and final
cycle of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire starts with the stage of adult
hood. Also in a natural human life, the intensity is highest around the
fifth Day and Night, and so is the length of the physical body.
The 13 Tones of Creation rule all historic, present and future events
in our world, the World of Shadows, as described in the following
chapter.
Together, these 13 tones also form a lemniscate, as shown in the fig
ure on the following page. Right in the middle, there is tone no. 7
synchronizing both halves of this lemniscate. The first six tones are
focused on vision, while the latter six tones are focused on action. In
this lemniscate, we also find the four energetic phases attached to a
group (or trinity) of 3 consecutive tones. The inner spiraling phases
of Earth and Air create the circle of vision, while the outer spiraling
phases of Water and Fire create the circle of action.

4. Creation of the Shadow World
In the first chapter we saw that the overall process of Creation occurs
in 7 layers, also referred to as ‘Days’. In the previous chapters, we
saw that also each creational step requires 7 Days, including 6 inter
mediate Nights. In total, the Creation of our (shadowy) world re
quires 9 Creational Waves of the 13 Creating Tones each.
The Beginning of the Overall Creation corresponds to the initiating
of the space-time-identity Trinity in the Shadow World. Everything
that has a beginning also has an end. This ending coincides with the
Completion of the Overall Creation. This completion will mean both
the end of the space-time-identity of our current Shadow World (also
known as the Armageddon, referring to the Ending of the World) and
the transcending into the space-time-identity of a new world (of
shadows). At the end of the Old World, the new space-time-identity
will reveal itself. That is precisely the meaning of the word Apoca
lypse, namely revelation or disclosure.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 71
The pace of the 9 Waves of the Overall Creation is fractional. On
each Day 7, the following Wave of Creation starts at 35 percent of
the total length of this Day. Within the remaining 65 percent (which
equals 13/20), the 13 Tones of the next Wave of Creation occur. This
means a 20-fold acceleration of creational time for each following
Wave. To visualize these 9 Waves of 20-fold
accelerating Creation, the Mayans built the
Pyramid of Kukulcán in the town of Chichén
Itzá in the region of Yucatán. This step pyra
mid in the east of the current country of Mex
ico indeed shows exactly 9 levels.
The Mayan calendar, generally referred to as the Long Count Calen
dar, keeps track of this 9 times 20-fold accelerating Creational Time.
For practical reasons, the Long Count Calendar started at the begin
ning of the sixth wave, in 3114 BC. In Mayan writing, this starting
date is 0.0.0.0. Each position counts the Tone of the corresponding
Wave. Taking in account also the fifth Wave, this starting date be
comes 13.0.0.0.0. Taking into account all Waves, the starting date of
the sixth Wave in Mayan writing would be 13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0.

1 0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0 13 × 20 7 Tun
(*A Tun is a period of 360 natural days.)
The challenge with the Long Count Calendar is that the Mayans
stopped using it long time ago. While still using it, the Mayans also



72 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
changed the original tracking of Creational Tones into a system that
gives a unique coding for each day. To do so, they divided the final
position into two positions, the last counting the remaining natural
days (called kin by the Mayans) and the before last counting remain
ing periods of 20 kin.
I call the original calendar that tracks the 9 Waves of each 13
Creational Tones the Tzol’tun, meaning the counting (tzol) of periods
of 360 kin or natural days (tun). The period of a tun, lasting precisely
360 natural days, represents the 360 degrees of arc, meaning a full
circle. To the Mayans, this period of a tun serves as the elementary
unit for tracking Creational Time.
During the eighth Wave each Creational Day and Night lasts ex
actly 1 tun. In the previous Wave, this length is 20 tun. The Mayans
call this length ka’tun. In fact, the Mayans have words for each of the
20-fold longer periods of Day and Night of all previous Waves, as
the table below shows.
Wave Mayan Word Length in Kin Converted
9 18 21⁄2 weeks
8 tun 360 nearly 1 year
7 ka’tun 7.200 19,7 years
6 bak’tun 144.000 3941⁄4 years
5 pic’tun 2.880.000 7884 years
4 calab’tun 57.600.000 157 millennia
3 kinchil’tun 1.152.000.000 3 million years
2 alau’tun 23.040.000.000 63 million years
1 habla’tun 460.800.000.000 11⁄4 billion years
The lengths in natural days of these Creational Days and Nights
show some very remarkable numbers. First, also the Bible refers to
the importance of the number 144.000. Secondly, the period of 18
days equals 432 hours (similar to the natural oscillation frequency in
Hertz meaning cycles per second) or 25.920 minutes (similar to the
length of a full circle of the Precession of the Equinoxes in years).
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 73
The Tzol’tun is in fact a countdown calendar. This calendar points
toward the end of time, which is also the end of space and the end of
identity, since time, space and identity are part of the same Trinity. In
Mayan writing, this End of Times is 13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13. The
big question is when precisely the end of this Day 7 (of the ninth
Wave) will be. Some say this end is on December 21, 2012. Others
follow the Swedish researcher Carl Calleman in this, and assume this
end is on October 28, 2011. However, when we match all known
historic events with the Creational pattern of the Tzol’tun, it becomes
clear that the correct ending date is July 14, 2012. To prove this, the
last part of this chapter matches important historic events with the 13
Tones of the 9 Waves according to this countdown date. The table
below shows the starting date of each of the 9 Waves. Please note
that the start of the ninth and final Creational Wave coincides with
Thanksgiving Day in the USA.

The ongoing Process of Creation keeps speeding up Creational Time.
Since space, time and identity form a Trinity, space and identity are
growing at the same pace. The growth of identity corresponds to the
evolution of consciousness. Each Creational Wave creates a higher
level of consciousness. Since each human being reflects the overall
Creation, we can verify each of these hierarchical levels by investi
gating our own consciousness.
At the first and lowest level of consciousness, we are only aware
of our existence. At this level, the only objectives are survival or



74 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
growth, but never both at the same time. We share this level with all
living creatures, up from the single-celled organism. For example,
our physical body consists of 50 to 100 trillion cells. Accordingly,
the first Creational Wave created the first single cell organisms.
At the second level of consciousness, our instinct tells us what to do.
We share this level with all cold-blooded animals, especially the rep
tiles, since our instincts settle in the reptile brain (officially called
brain stem) in the middle of our heads. Accordingly, the second Cre
ational Wave created the first (and last)
dinosaurs.
At the third level of consciousness, our
feelings guide us. We share this level
with all warm-blooded animals (such
as mammals), especially the apes. Our
feeling originate from the limbic system, which lies on top of the
brain stem. Accordingly, the third Creational Wave created the first
primates.
At the fourth level of consciousness, we follow our reason or
common sense. Reasoning and logic are typical for human beings.
Our reasoning takes place in the neocortex, which lies on top of the
limbic system. Accordingly, the fourth Creational Wave created the
first Homo Sapiens, meaning us.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 75
At the fifth level of consciousness, we honour values. Based on these
values, we develop cultures. Our values originate from our right
hemisphere. Accordingly, the fifth Creational Wave created the first
human cultures on Terra.
At the sixth level of consciousness, we obey
norms and rules, originating from our left hemi
sphere. Accordingly, the sixth Creational Wave
created the first laws, imposed by both govern
ment and religion.
At the seventh level of consciousness, we place ourselves above
the law. We then justify whatever benefits us, and we gladly make an
exception for ourselves. At this level, the ego is the dominating cen
tre of our being. Accordingly, the seventh Creational Wave created
well-organized power groups using every means to benefit them
selves and get around any kind of obstructing legislation.
At the eighth level of consciousness, our inner strength is guiding
our lives. We then intuitively know what to do. Humanity is cur
rently jumping from power-based consciousness up to strength-based
consciousness. At this level, intuition is the centre of our being. Ac
cordingly, the eighth Creational Wave creates a global uprising con
necting people with open minds and hearts.
At the ninth and highest level of consciousness, we are fully
aware of the wholeness of everything. Some refer to this level as
enlightenment. At this level, our loving heart is the centre of our be
ing. Accordingly, enlightened beings co-create in the ninth Cre
ational Wave a new world based on respect, equivalency and grati
tude.
Each higher level of consciousness enables us to experience a larger
world. That is because space (meaning the experienced size of the
world) is a function of time (meaning the experienced pace of Crea
tion) and identity (meaning the level of consciousness), as stated be
fore.
At the first consciousness level of existence, the world is the mi
cro-world of a living cell and its direct environment. The proteins
within the cell play the central role in this world. The ruling principle



76 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
of interaction in this world is that all action equals reaction, which is
the basic concept of causality.
At the second consciousness level of instinct, the world corre
sponds to the (anonymous) group around our own organism. An il
lustrative example of such a group is a school of fish, all responding
in a similar way. The ruling principle of interaction in this world is
collective stimulus response, which is the basic concept of condition
ing.

At the third consciousness level of feeling, the world corresponds to
our family. The ruling principle of interaction in this world is indi
vidual stimulus response, which is the basic concept of motivation.
At the fourth consciousness level of reason, the world corre
sponds to the area we live in. The ruling principle of interaction in
this world is logic, which is the basic concept of classification.
At the fifth consciousness level of values, the world corresponds
to the region we live in. The ruling principle of interaction in this
world is the regional culture, which provides the basis for coherence.
At the sixth consciousness level of norms, the world corresponds
to the state we live in, as a unity of jurisdiction. The ruling principle
of interaction in this world is the law, which provides the basis for
legislation and law enforcement.
At the seventh consciousness level of power, the world becomes
supranational, overruling all national legislations. The ruling princi
ple of interaction in this world is domination. In this world, the
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 77
choice is simply between you dominating others or allowing others
to dominate you.
At the eighth consciousness level of strength, we understand
why everything in the outer world is just a reflection of our inner
world. The ruling principle of interaction in this world is harmony.
By creating inner harmony, we will also experience harmony in the
outer world.
At the ninth consciousness level of wholeness, we understand
that all worlds from the micro-world to the macro-world are all one
and the same. The ruling principle of interaction in this world is co
creation. At this highest level, we remember that we are all part of
the same space-time-identity Trinity.
The remaining of this chapter plots historic events to show the Cre
ational Rhythm of 13 Tones times 9 Waves.
The first Wave of Creation created
organic life on Terra (on Day 7), com
pletely on the principle of action
equals reaction. Please note that ac
cording to modern science, the so
called Big Bang occurred about 13,7
billion years ago, precisely at the start of the stage of Germination.
We could say that on Day 1 the projection of our Shadow World
starting in the Source World. On Night 1, it reached the Flow World,
and on Day 2, the shadows arrived in the third and outer world.



78 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
The second Wave of Creation brought
instinct on Terra. This instinct is why a
school of fish moves like a single or
ganism. All fish in the school react
collectively, exactly at the same the
moment and in the same manner (re
sponse) to, for example, a movement of an attacking shark (stimu
lus). Exactly on Day 3, when the boom cracks through surface of the
soil, the first fish appeared on Terra.
For more than 200 million years, the cold-blooded dinosaurs were
the highest evolved creatures on Terra. After their extinction, warm
blooded mammals took over this position.
The third Wave of Creation created
the capacity to feel. This capacity
(originating from the limbic system)
is clearly present in the hominoids
such as the anthropoid apes. These
life forms learned individually how
the beasts react (respond) to, for example, a hungry tiger (stimulus).
This ability to feel enables a warm-blooded life form to protect and
serve the own family.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 79
In the fourth Wave of Creation, con
sciousness jumped to the level of
reason. Homo Erectus, the first man
like creature on Terra able to reason,
appeared exactly at Day 3. Next, dur
ing the Night 6, suddenly the first
Homo Sapiens arrived at the surface of Terra. How on Earth was this
possible, because genetically Homo Sapiens differs totally from
Homo Erectus? The whole story about the so-called missing link is
utterly ridiculous. The genes of Homo Sapiens are so different from
those of Homo Erectus, that an evolutionary chain of hundred links
lasting more then a millions of years would still not be able to ex
plain this.
A much more plausible explanation is that the Annunaki, coming
from the red dwarf of Nibiru – also part of our solar system (and also
know as Nemesis, Hercolubus, Wormwood, or Planet X) – geneti
cally engineered Homo Erectus into Homo Sapiens. About five thou
sand years ago, the Sumerians wrote down this story on the origin of
humankind in cuneiform on clay tablets. Thanks to Zecharia Sitchin,
we were able to rediscover this ancient story.
This means that Homo Sapiens have been present on the surface
of Terra for period of about 200,000 years. What do we really know
about this period? Our official history books only tell us (a little)



80 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
about what happened from the sixth Wave of Creation on. So what
happened in the remaining 195,000 years human beings are living on
Terra?
The fifth Wave of Creation resulted
in the development of human culture
based on shared values. Each culture
originates from a specific region.
The first human culture was in Le
muria, also called the Land of Mu.
In those days, all continents (as we know them now) were still con
nected. Mu was in fact one very large island surrounded by what we
call now the Pacific Ocean, based on the Latin name Mare Pacifi
cum, meaning ‘peaceful sea’.
Later on in this fifth Wave of Creation, there were two periods of
the culture of Atlantis. Atlantis was also an island, but then much
smaller, at the place where we now have the Atlantic Ocean, at the
West side of current Africa.
The dynamics of the Great Year (meaning the Precession of the
Equinoxes) provides an explanation for the rise and fall of both Le
muria and Atlantis. The Sphinx was built to help humanity remember
the effect of the Aeon of Leo, wiping out Atlantis for the first time.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 81
However, much we do not know about these early human cultures.
We only have the references Plato made in his writings.
Human writing, based on rules,
started exactly at the beginning of the
sixth Wave of Creation. This Wave
created sovereign countries. National
legislation keeps each nation tight
together. Since then, formal rules



82 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
written down in statute books governed people. In the same way and
for the same reason, also organized religion evolved in this sixth
Wave of Creation
The industrial revolution formed the
starting point for the seventh Wave
of Creation. Technology enabled
consciousness to jump to suprana
tional level. Every new Day of this
seventh Creational Wave, new com
munication technology made overcoming physical distance more
easy. On the Day 3, we started to use the electronic telegraph, fol
lowed by the telephone on Day 4. On Day 5, the radio made its way
into our lives, followed by the television on Day 6. Finally, on the
Day 7, the internet merged into our home environment. Since then,
we have a supranational economy (or global village) on Terra, in
which all national economies are closely connected.
Together with the individual jump to power-based consciousness, the
seventh Wave created at the same time supranational power groups.
During this seventh Wave of Creation, these groups (semi openly)
started to join hands. Secret societies joined forces and seized control
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 83
over sovereign countries through the monetary system. The top of
this secret pyramid of these hidden powers calls itself the Illuminati,
a global power group dominated by 13 families (or bloodlines). They
became officially established precisely at the start of Night 1, open
ing the opportunity to seize global power. These Illuminati families
exploited generation after generation the most profitable way to gain
more power, which is warfare. Through manipulation and lies, they
were able to create all major incidents of violence and wars in the
last 250 years including the present ones. To ensure maximum re
turns, they always supplied both sides with both weapons and loans.
Their strategy is simple. Let money control the world, since the Illu
minati control money. At the end of 1933 (at the beginning of the 5th
Night), these families took control over most of our home planet, by
causing the financial collapse.
These dominating families are now so rich and powerful, that
they never appear in any top listing of the (multi) billionaires. How
ever, bloodlines are much more difficult to hide than bank accounts.
These lines show that nearly all presidents of the USA are blood
bond to the Illuminati, including Barrack Hoessein Obama. And also
Adolf Hitler, the leader of the German party of National Socialism,
who started the Second World War in 1939, belonged to one of the
bloodlines of the Illuminati.
To me, the clearest proof of the agenda of the Illuminati is visible
on the back of the US one dollar bill. At the first layer of the pyramid
in The Great Seal, we see in Roman numbers the year 1776. In this
year, the Illuminati founded themselves on May 1st. The International
Workers' Day is in fact the yearly celebration of this date, because
the Illuminati think they are the offspring of the Gods and therefore
own this planet including its workers. The pyramid has exactly 13
layers (under the All-Seeing-Eye), and there are many more refer
ences the 13 in The Great Seal of the United States. These 13 layers
represent the Days and Nights of the seventh Wave of Creation. The
first Night indeed almost precisely starts at the beginning of the year
1776. By putting the ending year of 1776 on the first layer of the
pyramid, and each layer lasting 19.7 years, the designers of this pyra
mid also pointed out that the 13th and final layer ends in 2012.



84 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
Above the All-Seeing-Eye, we find the Latin words ‘Annuit Coeptis’,
meaning ‘Announcement of the Conception’. The actual conception
(of the Pyramid of Power) occurs at the 2nd Day (as we saw before),
which means that this announcement is a clear reference to the 1st
Night, in which the Illuminati were founded
The Illuminati used the Latin words of Novus Ordo Seclorum
under the pyramid to express their goal of a New World Order. This
New World Order of the Illuminati is a global fascist regime, maxi
mally controlling all life on Terra. It is the Big Brother as George
Orwell described in his book ‘Nineteen Eighty-Four’.
Not only the 13 layers on the US one dollar bill represent the 7 Days
and 6 Nights of the Creational Wave. The national flag of the USA
does the same. The 7 red stripes represent the Days, while the 6
white stripes represent the Nights. The Illuminati are very fond of
turning things upside down in order to conceal the truth. That is why
they represented the black Nights with white stripes.
The Illuminati used Roman numbers on the bottom layer of the
pyramid to stress their alliance with the Vatican in the heart of the
Italian capitol Rome. In Italian, this city is called Roma, which is the
reverse of the Italian word for love: amor.
Vatican City in the heart of Rome is a sovereign state, independ
ent of Italy. This is the Illuminati’s centre of religious power. London
City in the heart of London is a sovereign state, independent of the
UK. This is the Illuminati’s centre of financial power. Thirdly,
Washington DC is a sovereign state, independent of the USA. This is
the Illuminati’s centre of military power. These three sovereign states
are the pillars of the Illuminati’s hidden empire.
Due to this hidden coup on Terra, People's Representation turned
into a sham democracy. It contaminated the entire planet with a self
ish ego virus. Humanity started to think, to feel and to perceive based
on selfishness and the need to control others. I want to have a good
life; I do not care about others. This property is mine. Everything
must happen exactly as I want it to happen. These selfish intentions
dominated the consciousness of the people in this seventh Cycle of
Creation. The (hidden) power groups made sure that they applied all
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 85
means available to keep the collective consciousness on this rela
tively low level. They therefore intentionally contaminated our air,
water, food, healthcare, media, education, science, technology and
spirituality with poison or lies (which all produce the same kind of
inner negativity).
The overture to the new millennium was nearly at the same time as
the start the eighth Wave of Creation. The purpose of this Wave is to
encourage the inner jump from power
based consciousness to strength-based
consciousness. During this eighth
Wave, the task of the power groups is
to prevent this jump, by all means.
Their most spectacular measure to do
so was clearly 9/11. Exactly on the right day, namely the first natural
day of Day 2, the 9/11 attacks very precisely prevented the germina
tion of strength-based consciousness as much as possible.
In order for our consciousness to jump to level of inner strength, we
allow our intuition to overrule our ego. At this level, we no longer
need formalised rules, nor auditors and punishers to tell us what to do
or not to do. We intuitively know, feel or perceive what is ethical to
us, and what is not. This is the conscious decision facing each and
every one of us in this eighth Wave of Creation.



86 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
For every free human who had the
courage to jump to strength-based
consciousness, there is also ninth
Wave of Creation. This Wave en
ables awakened humans to become
enlightened. Enlightened people
know, feel and perceive that all life, anywhere in the Cosmos, is one
and Wholly. Enlightenment ends the imaginary duality, so domi
nantly present in all lower levels of consciousness.
The ninth Wave of Creation is the apotheosis. This ancient Greek
word means raising up to the level of the Gods. God simply means
Creator. Enlightened people remember their own ability to Create.
Also the Illuminati are part of God’s Overall Plan. The coup of the
Illuminati fits in perfectly with the objective of the seventh Wave of
Creation, which is the creation of power-based consciousness. In the
eight Wave, the Illuminati also had a role to play. This was creating a
counter weight to enable the rise of strength-based consciousness. In
the ninth and final Wave of Creation, however, their role is over.
This finalizing Wave creates unity in all possible ways.
There is, however, the possibility that humanity gets stuck at the
level of power-based consciousness. That scenario will include a
third World War probably starting between Israel and Iran. The be

ginning of the year 2012 will therefore be the most crucial period
defining the path our reality will take. More and more people see the
Illuminati abused the Arab Uprising in order to gain control over
more oil fields. This is in fact a new way of warfare. Crucial for this
way is using the television for broadcasting propaganda and disin
formation. For example, the footage of the attackers taking over
Tripoli was shot in Qatar. By broadcasting this fake footage, the Il
luminati were able to break the moral of the defenders.
While the Illuminati try to seize full planetary control, Nibiru will
probably return in the coming years. As briefly mentioned above, the
so-called plaques of Egypt as described in the Bible, resulted from
the passing by of Nibiru. This caused the gigantic eruption of the
volcano under the Greek island of Thera (also called Santorini). This
Minoan eruption was one of the largest volcanic events on Earth in
recorded history. Historians date this devastating event between 1630
BC and 1500 BC. If this event took place in 1588 BC, and if it in
deed resulted from the passing by of Niburu, then we can easily cal
culate the year in which Nibiru will reappear, namely 3600 years
after 1588 BC, which is 2013 AD.
There is a harmonic relation between the orbit of Nibiru and the
Precession cycle. Within the period of five Precession cycles, Niburu
orbits Helios exactly 36 times. Maybe the coming passage of Nibiru
is the 36th that completes these five cycles. Maybe that is why the
Mayans talk about the fifth Sun. Please note that all these numbers
are multiples of 6, which is the Cartesian product of both Harmonic
Ratio Base Numbers 2 and 3.
Recently, there was a lot of excitement about what Nasa called
‘C/2010 X1 Elenin’. Please note that Nasa is not a governmental
organization. This private company is known for hiding and manipu
lating astrological data. That is why many people interpret the name
N.A.S.A. as an acronym of ‘Never A Straight Answer’. Let us look
at the facts related to this object.
In 1998, the movie ‘Deep Impact’ is released in which an ama
teur-astronomer called Leo discovers an incoming comet called



88 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
E.L.E. In this movie, the US president is an African-American,
which, in those days, was science fiction as well.
On December 10th, 2010 (which is 13 years later), an amateur
astronomer called Leonid discovered an incoming comet. This comet
gets called after his surname Elenin. Leo is exactly the first half of
Leonid, and E.L.E. are exactly the letters of the first half of Elenin.
Was the movie meant to tell us half of the real story?
The object discovered by Leonid comes towards Terra from the
direction of the constellation Leo. Further more, Leonid is an official
name for an astrological phenomenon. The Leonids are a prolific
meteor shower. These meteors appear to radiate from the constella
tion Leo and tend to peak in November.
The object ‘C/2010 X1 Elenin’ arrived at its closest distance to
the sun Helios (called the perihelion) on September 11th, exactly 10
years after 9/11. In words, this date is Nine Eleven. By reversing and
abbreviating both words, we get ‘Ele Nin’.
To me, it was very strange that Nasa with all her advanced telescopes
did not detect this incoming object. What is the point of being able to
see other galaxies while an object that comes very close to Terra
within a year time remains unnoted?
Nasa’s strange behavior regarding this object caused many peo
ple to think that Elenin is an acronym. These people claim that
E.L.E. stands for ‘Extinction-Level Event’. For the N.I.N. part, there
are more variations like ‘Nibiru Is Near’, ‘Nibiru In November’,
‘Near Impact Nibiru’, or ‘Notable Impact Nemesis’. In the next
chapter, we will come back to the mystery of ‘Elenin’.

4.1 Deliberate Use of Numbers
The Whole Reality consists of three concentric spheres, as described
in the first chapter. The Source World in the centre is the heart of the
Whole Reality. Everything originates from this Source World. The
Source World contains numbers and symbols, referring to numbers.
The world we consider ours is just a slice of the outer sphere of
shadows. Everything we are able to perceive or detect as being real
belongs to that (tiny) slice. To put this in numbers, we could say that
‘our’ world only consists of numbers of the Fibonacci series. Starting
with 0 and 1, each new number in this series is simply the sum of the
two before it. After 0 and 1, the Fibonacci series grows as follows:
1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181 6765
Metaphorically speaking, we could state that only the shadows of
these Fibonacci numbers exist in our world. In this imaginary exam
ple, this means that we are not able to detect the shadow of the num
ber 4. In the same way, we are not able to detect the presence of su



90 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
pernatural or metaphysical phenomena. However, in the total outer
sphere, the shadows of all integers, fractions and even the zero exist,
but all in different slices. This means that even though something is
not detectable in our world, it is probably still real, but then in an
other (shadow) world.
The numbers in the Source World provide the code for life. All life
emerges from a specific set of numbers. In the Shadow World, we
find these numbers in the genetic code of each life form.
Now it might become clear why the Illuminati are so fond of playing
with numbers. As painters sign their paintings, the signature of the
Illuminati is in the numbers.
The Illuminati planned their founding in 1776, right at the begin
ning of Night 1 of the seventh Wave of Creation. This was indeed the
right energetic moment in time to openly start seizing global power.
As mentioned before, they put the demarcation year of 1776 openly
on the US one dollar bill (in Roman numbers). It tells us that Day 1
ends in (about) 1776, which is at the same time the start of Night 1.
This claim is very accurate since the actual date of this transition is
December 27th, 1775. By writing 1776, meaning January 1st, 1776,
there is just a minor difference of only five days, which is a deviation
of just 1 percent. That is also probably the reason the Illuminati used
this 5 from the five days difference for their founding on the first day
of the fifth month (May).
That is not all. There is more to this date. The number 8 refers to
infinity (∞). There are, for example, 8 geographical directions. The
meaning of using three eights is complete infinity, since the meaning
of 3 is completely. Since everything has both a yang side and a yin
side, two of these triple 8’s are required. That is another reason why
the Illuminati put the year 1776 on the US one dollar bill.
888 + 888 = 1776
Their masterpiece (so far) is clearly 9/11. The date of this attack ex
actly corresponds to the beginning of Day 2 in the eight Wave, mak
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 91
ing it the perfect day for blocking as much germination of strength
based consciousness as possible. The date of 9/11 also matches with
the North American emergency telephone number of 9-1-1. This date
therefore triggers associations with fear and panic, and clearly not
with inner strength.
In numerology, which is a system that reveals the numerical root
value of both numbers and words as presented below, the 9 repre
sents the Ruler and 11 is the number of Mastery. With 9/11, the Illu
minati demonstrated their dominating power, hoping for recognition
as ruling master on this planet.
After 911 intermediate days, the Illuminati again demonstrated
their power. On March 11th, 2004, they brought terror to Madrid, the
capital of Spain. The numerical root of this date is 11, and so is the
adding up of 9 plus 1 and 1.
In the Netherlands, the would-be Prime Minister Pim Fortuyn
was killed on May 6th, 2002, just a few days before the elections.
Adding up 5 (May) and 6 gives 11. Even though he was dead, he still
received most of the votes. Just like with the murder of John F. Ken
nedy, the arrested shooter was a scapegoat, blocking the public’s
attention for the real killer and the ones responsible for these assassi
nations.
Exactly 911 days after the murder of Pim Fortuyn, another fa
mous Dutchman was brutally murdered on the streets of Amsterdam.
The assassination of Theo van Gogh was on November 2nd, 2004.
This date of 11/2 corresponds with the Dutch emergency telephone
number of 1-1-2. I clearly see the fingerprints of the Illuminati in all
these terrorizing events. All dates clearly show the number 11.
Literally, Illuminati means ‘Enlightened Ones’, but instead of Light
ness, they openly worship the Darkness. Referring to this Darkness,
the Bible mentions the number of 666, being the Number of the
Beast. Exactly 666 days after the brutal murder of Israeli Prime Min
ister Yitzhak Rabin, on November 4th, 1995, the British Lady Diana
was murdered in Paris, on August 31st, 1997. Rabin’s murder hap
pened in the 11th month and the numerical root of the date of Diana’s



92 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
murder also is 11. The use of 11 is the trademark of the Illuminati, or
should we write this name as I11uminati, with ‘11’ (eleven) instead
of ‘ll’ (double el)? The Twin Towers also represented a gigantic 11.
The Illuminati are responsible not only for these murders, but also
for many and many more. Proud of their power to do so, they sign
their acts of terror with meaningful numbers.
The ultimate goal of the Illuminati is to create a New World Order.
In the seventh Wave of Creation, they seized power, fully according
to the purpose of this Creational Wave, establishing power-based
consciousness. In the eighth Wave of Creation, the Illuminati repre
sent the pyramid’s top
stone of ‘The Powers
That Be’. In the ninth
and final Wave of
Creation, we will re
fer to this pyramid as
‘The Powers That
Were’.
To me, the left part of the Great
Seal of the United States (of
America), as displayed on the
backside of a US one dollar bill,
reveals the bigger picture. Firstly,
the Latin phrase ‘Novus Ordo Se
clorum’, literally meaning a New
Order of the Ages, refers to the
birth of a new space-time-identity.
In that new space-time-identity,
our inner vision, also referred to as
our third eye, will guide us. That is
why after exactly thirteen layers, the top of this pyramid lifts itself
up. Since each of these thirteen layers requires 7200 natural days for
completion, and the first layer was completed in around the start of
1776 according to the Roman numbers written on it, this lifting of
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 93
will occur on July 14th, 2012. God indeed approved (Annuit Coeptis)
this lifting of into a new space-time-identity, since it is the sole pur
pose of the Overall Creation. God, being the Overall Force of Crea
tion, created our Shadow World of increasing space-time-identity to
allow consciousness to experience being limited in space, time and
identity. We can very well compare our world with a three
dimensional computer game. This metaphorical game has nine hier
archical levels. Our (dynamic) state of consciousness determines on
which level we play. Most people play at level 7 and the levels be
low. The purpose of the current eighth Wave of Creation is to enable
humanity to jump up and start also playing at level 8. Next, these
level 8 players will start exploring level 9 from November 24th, 2011
on. Everyone who reaches level 9 before the End of Times will move
on to a totally new game. That is how I interpret the One Dollar
Pyramid.
There is solid proof for this interpretation. That proof is present
in the numbers. As presented in the previous chapters, we can picture
the total creation as a pyramid of 9 layers each consisting of 13 tones
(or stages). In The Great Seal, these numbers are alternated. The
pyramid under the All-Seeing-Eye has 13 levels, and the amount of
Roman numerals at the bottom level is 9. Next, numerology trans
lates letters into ciphers according to the table below.
123 4 5 6789
abc d e fgh i
j k l m n opqr
s t u v wxyz
Adding up the cipher values of the words ‘Annuit Coeptis’ results in
58, and 5 plus 8 gives 13. In total, ‘Annuit Coeptis’ also consists of
13 letters. Adding up the cipher values of the words ‘The Great Seal’
results in 49, and 4 plus 9 gives again 13. The words of ‘of the
United States’ complete this trinity, because adding up the cipher
values of these letters results in 67, and 6 plus 7 again gives 13.
All words around the strange pyramid on the back of the one US
dollar bill all refer to 13. The amount of layers of this pyramid is 13.



94 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
The US flag has 13 stripes. Clearly the designers tried to stress the
importance of the number 13. The number 13 represents the amount
of stages of any process of creation, as explained in the previous
chapters.
On the right side on the Great Seal
of the United States, we find the
Eagle. At the left side, the eagle
holds an olive branch with 13 ber
ries, and 13 arrows on the right.
There are 13 stars above the eagles
head. The ribbon contains 13 let
ters making up the Latin words ‘E
Pluribus Unum’ meaning ‘out of
many, one’. All these hidden mes
sages point in the same direction:
13 becomes 1. That is why the
messages are at the 1 US dollar
bill. The top stone of the Illuminati pyramid of power consists of 13
families. Their goal is to become the one and only power of domi
nance on Terra.
Now let us come back to the phenomenon called ‘Elenin’. The nu
merological value of this name is 32. Next we find exactly the same
numerological value for ‘Leonid’. This means that ‘Leonid Elenin’ is
a code for 64, referring to the nascent oneness. The Illuminati also
strive to realize this oneness, but then in a totalitarian way.
This means that ‘Elenin’ is not an ordinary comet (or officially a
cluster comet), like Nasa claims. Please note that also ‘C/2010 X1’
has the numerological value of 13. I think that ‘Elenin’ is a message
helping humanity to evolve her consciousness to the level of oneness
or wholeness.

4.2 Dynamics of Interacting Energies
Based on Plato’s allegory of the cave, the previous chapters showed
that our world is just a small part of the whole of reality. In the basic
shapes that are present in our Shadow World, we find another refer
ence to Plato. The perfect three-dimensional shapes consisting of
identical surfaces, sides and angels are called Platonic bodies, of
which there are five, as shown again in the table below.
Surfaces : 4 6 8 12 20
Sides : 6 12 12 30 30
Angles : 4 8 6 20 12
Tetrahedron Hexahedron Octahedron Dodecahedron Icosahedron
There is a fifth sort of energy, next to the four sorts already dis
cussed. This fifth sort is the most mysterious of all energies. It is
called Aether (or simply Ether). In the Forbidden Apple of Know
ledge, we find Aether in the central null point. In this null point, the
spiraling energy of the Flow World makes contact with the Source
World.
This means that there are five sorts of energy. There are also five
Platonic bodies, as shown above. Thirdly, ancient science distin
guishes between five elements. The table below shows how these
sorts of energy, Platonic bodies, and elements correspond based on
their different functions.
Energy Function Platonic Solid element
Fire Transforming tetrahedron fire
Earth Stabilising hexahedron earth
Aether Connecting dodecahedron metal
Water Stirring icosahedron water
Air Expanding octahedron wood



96 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
We could say that each Platonic body is the particle appearance in
the Shadow World of the corresponding energetic phase, while the
element corresponds to the wave appearance.
Three of the five elements have the same name as the corresponding
energy. To distinguish between both, the sorts of energy are capital
ised in this book. The other two have different names, because ether
and air are not present as elements in our (shadow) world. All ele
ments share the same function as the energy from which they origi
nate.
The function of Aether is to establish connections. We used the
element of metal to connect ourselves with telephone lines. Now we
use both metal (cord) and Aether (cordless) to interconnect our
selves.
The function of Air is to expand. Air from high-pressure areas is
always expanding towards low-pressure areas. In a similar way, the
element of wood enables the expansion of trunks and branches.
One of the oldest symbols found on our planet, symbolises the play
ful interactions between these five sorts of energy. Nowadays, this
symbol is present in nearly 1 of every 5 national flags! This
symbol is called the pentagram, which is Greek for a model
(gram) of five (penta). Several harmonic ratios are hidden
in the ancient symbol of the pentagram. For example, each
crossing of one side over the other is exactly at the point of the
Golden Ratio, which is the limit of the ratios of successive terms of
the Fibonacci sequence.
There is a very old saying that refers to this symbol. This saying
is that whoever controls the elements, can dominate the world. The
meaning of this saying is that whoever can exploit the never ending
playful interactions between the five sorts of energy, can master any
thing in the Shadow World. That is clearly the reason why this sym
bol is the favorite of the governments on this planet. The Illuminati
like to point the pentagram downwards, to make it resemble a goat
head. They openly worship the Devil impersonated as Baphomet, a
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 97
goat-headed figure. By stretching the pinky and the index finger,
Illuminati members secretly signal their membership to each other.
In order to discover the secret of the pentagram, we need to draw the
surrounding circle as well. The five points where the pentagram
touches the circle correspond to the five sorts of energy.
The small circle at top, as shown to the left,
symbolizes Aether. The pentagram together
with the surrounding circle show that ener
gies interact, in both a yin and a yang way.
The circle represents the round, female
shape of the nourishing yin cycle, while the
straight, male shape of the pentagram repre
sents the controlling yang cycle.
In the generating yin cycle, each element nourishes the following
element. Water nourishes
wood. By watering plants, we
feed them. Wood nourishes
fire. By throwing in another
wood block, we feed the fire.
Fire nourishes earth. Earth
eats ashes, the remains of
fire. Earth nourishes metal.
Metals grow within the earth.
Fifthly, metal nourishes wa
ter. Water condenses most quickly on metal.
In the destroying yang cycle, each element controls the following
element. Metal controls wood. With a metal axe, we can cut a
wooden tree. Wood controls earth. With wooden shelves, we push
the earth back. Earth controls water. Dikes of earth are to stop the
water coming in. Water controls fire. With water, we can extinguish
a fire. Fifthly, fire controls metal. Fire heats up the metal, allowing it
to be bended.
By replacing the elements of ancient science with the words modern
science uses to describe these wave-like shadows, it becomes clear
that our technology is solely based on the controlling yang cycle. We



98 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
produce electrical energy by
spinning magnetic fields. This
spinning results from physical
energy. Both steps correspond to
straight lines of the pentagram.
Next, our combustion engines use
chemical energy to control physi
cal energy. As shown in the pic
ture on the left, this corresponds to a straight line of the controlling
yang cycle. Thirdly, chemicals called pharmaceuticals suppress
physical symptoms of illness. This has nothing to do with healing. It
also corresponds to a straight line of the destroying yang cycle.
The reason why the pentagram is so widely used by the powers that
be, is that it represents the controlling, yang cycle. By stressing the
male yang cycle and suppressing the female yin cycle, we allowed
our (shadow) world to become off balance, lacking harmony on all
levels. Let us re-establish the balance between yin and yang, first
individually internally, and then collectively externally.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 99
Seen from the top (or bottom), the Forbidden Apple of Knowledge
looks like a rotating wheel. The Sanskrit word from Ancient India for
this rotating wheel of energy is chakra. Internally balancing our
selves means allowing our chakra’s to function properly.
Each chakra corresponds to an endocrine gland, as shown in the
above picture. Our chakras transfer incoming energies into corre
sponding hormonal messages.

6 Third Eye Brow Ajna Pineal

In India, women create a red dot between the eyebrows precisely at
the entrance spot of the sixth chakra. This chakra corresponds to the
pineal gland. This gland is physiologically a real eye. With this inner
eye, we are able to perceive outside our common
World of Shadows. Knowledge about the meta
physical function of the pineal gland goes back to
at least Ancient Egypt. Even today, we can find
many examples that refer to this pinecone shaped
gland. To find them, just take a better look at the
artifacts used by the powers that be.
Our Base chakra is facing downwards, allowing the incoming ener
gies from our Mother to spiral upwards into our core. Our Crown
chakra is facing upwards, allowing the incoming energies from our
Father to spiral downwards into our core. Together with the other
chakra’s they form an energetic rainbow bridge between the infrared
energy of Terra and the ultraviolet energy of Helios.



100 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
There are five intermediate chakras in between the vertically-oriented
Base chakra and Crown chakra. Their orientation is horizontal. For
yin persons, who are mostly females, three of these five chakra’s
receive energies (with a + in the front), while the other two send out
energies (with a - in the front). The opposite is true for yang persons,
who are mostly males. That is why yin and yang persons fit together.
Insemination is related to the sacral chakra. The semen is ejected
(-) by yang and received (+) by yin. Next, the chakra of the solar
plexus relates to self-esteem. In order to feel good about ourselves, a
yin person spends money (-), while a yang person earns (+) it. The
middle chakra relates to romance, in which yang persons seduce (-,
outwards oriented), while yin persons desire to be tempted (+, in
wards oriented). The fifth chakra of the throat relates to expression.
The typical yin person commands (-) the typical obedient (+) yang
person what to do. Finally, the sixth chakra of the third eye relates to
intuition. A yin person more easily receives (+) intuitive messages,
while a yang person more easily delivers (+) intuitive messages.
By balancing our inner world, we also help balance the outer world.
The outer World of Shadows is just a mere reflection of the dynam
ics of interacting energies in the Flow World.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 101
By taking into account to the Trinity of the Whole Reality, we can
understand how to influence the events and shapes in our outer
World of Shadows. The process of conscious creation starts with
vitalizing the right code. Next, this vitalized code, which is energy,
will project its shadows in the materialistic part of reality. Without
this understanding, conscious creation is pure magic. That is why
humanity is so fond of stories about magic. The magic disappears
when we can see it as science.
The (magical) process of creation is the reverse of the process of per
ception. Our senses translate physical quantities into energetic quali
ties. Then, in the back of our brain, these energetic qualities are
translated into coded information.
The process of creation starts with selecting the correct code. By
bringing this code into our consciousness, it becomes alive, meaning
energy. Finally, this energy will influence the manifestations we per
ceive in our reality. These three steps of creation are the essence of
all successful approaches to creation, Neuro-Linguistic Programming
(NLP), Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), or Eye Movement
Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR).
The aim of this book it to reconnect our modern day understanding

thagoras, and Plato. However, the very first on our planet who wrote
down references to Wholly Science was Hermes.
The Ancient Greeks considered Hermes to be the
three-times greatest in the passing on of Wholly
Knowledge. They therefore honored him with the
title of Trismegistus, meaning thrice greatest. The
Ancient Egyptians called him Thoth the Atlantean.
Their picture of him is on the left. This mysterious
Thoth or Hermes is the greatest source of inspira
tion for my work. His most famous words are ‘As
above, so below’ (as mentioned at the start of this
book). To me this means, that as the Flow World is,
so is also the Shadow World. Below (being the
Shadow World) is nothing more than a reflection of
above (being the Flow World).
There is another meaningful interpretation of ‘As above, so below’.
By understanding ourselves (meaning below) we also understand the
Whole of Reality (meaning above). The nine levels of consciousness
are present in each human (below), in the same way these levels are
present in the Whole of Reality (above). To me, that is why the An
cient Greek carved the words ‘know thyself’ above the entrance to the
temple at Delphi.
At the moment we were born, our personal energy values (below)
fully reflected the energy values in the Cosmos (above). There are
various methods for gaining more self-knowledge based on this be
low-above correspondence. These methods include the signs and
tones from the Tzol’kin and the monthly constellations from the Zo
diak. Other revealing methods are Nine Star Ki based on the Bagua
(pictured on the left), the Chinese Astrology, and the Enneagram
(pictured on the right). To me, all
five methods are astonishingly
revealing. My advice to you:
Question everything; keep what is
good.
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 103
4.3 The Code of the Source World
The codes of the Source World are ciphers. There are nine basic ci
pher codes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Each cipher has a yin or posi
tive value and a yang or negative value. The ciphers themselves
never move, because there is no motion in the Source World.
In the Flow World, the codes inter
act according to specific functions.
These functions create the dynam
ics in the Flow World. There are
two yin functions (+ and ×), which
create higher numbers, and two
yang functions (− and ÷), which
create lower numbers. Two of these
four functions (+ and −) are inner
functions, which have smaller effects, and the other two are outer
functions (× and ÷), which have bigger effects.
The application of the four functions (adding, subtracting, multi
plying, and dividing) to the cipher codes results in numbers. Each
resulting number consists of one or more ciphers. By repeatingly
adding up the constituting ciphers of a number, we eventually get the
root cipher value of this number. Each number has a numerological
root cipher.
Let us now look at the tables of both multiplication and division.
We start with the base ciphers of 1 and 8, as shown in the table be
low.
1×1= 1 (1)
2×1= 2 (2)
3×1= 3 (3)
4×1= 4 (4)

104 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
The rhythm of both the multiplication and
division table of 1 is simply jumping to the
next cipher (clockwise). The figure to the left
shows this basic rhythm, which goes on infi
nitely. We find the opposite of this rhythm
when we multiply with 8 or divide by 8. That
rhythm simply jumps back to the previous
cipher (counter clockwise).
Since both multiplication and division result in the same sequence,
both 1 and 8 are reciprocal ciphers of themselves. This means that
the reciprocal cipher of 1 is again 1, and the reciprocal cipher of 8 is
again 8.
The figure above also represents the functions of adding 1 or sub
tracting 8. In both cases the resulting movement is clockwise. On the
contrary, the functions of subtracting 1 or adding 8 result in a
counter-clockwise movement.

The reciprocal cipher for 2 is 5, while the
reciprocal cipher for 7 is 4. The tables above
represent the multiplications with 2 and 7,
and the divisions with 5 and 4. Multiplying
by 2 or dividing with 5 results in a clockwise
movement, while multiplying by 7 or divid
ing with 4 results in a counter-clockwise
movement, as shown in the figure to the left.
This figure also represents the clockwise

Multiplying by 4 or dividing with 7 results in
a clockwise movement, while multiplying by
5 or dividing with 2 results in a counter
clockwise movement. The figure to the left
shows both movements. This figure also
represents the clockwise movement created
by adding 4 or subtracting 5, and the counter
clockwise movement created by adding 5 or
subtracting 4. Please note that proving the root value of the fractions
with an infinite series of ciphers is beyond the scope of this book.
Dividing by 7 results in an infinite repeti
tion of a remarkable series of ciphers. The
consecutive order in this series is always the
same. The figure to the right shows this order.
In this series, the ciphers 3, 6, and 9 never
appear. These three ciphers form a special
group. In the same way form the reciprocals 4
and 7 a group together with 1, and form the
reciprocals 2 and 5 a group together with 8.

The group of 3, 6 and 9 is special because the result of any function
with these ciphers as base always is a 3, a 6 or a 9. The table below

in a clockwise movement, while multiplying
by 6 or dividing with 3 results in a counter
clockwise movement. The figure to the left
shows both movements. This figure also

The most special cipher of all is the 9. The result of any multiplica
tion with 9 is always a 9. Just like 1 and 8, the 9 is also its own recip
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 107
rocal. However, any division by 9 not always results in a 9. Dividing
by 9 does not alter the cipher root value, and the same is true for add
ing or subtracting 9. The table above shows the basic multiplications
and divisions with 9 as the base cipher.
The figure to the left shows each of the three
cipher groups as a triangle. The triangle is the
symbol for trinity. Each of these groups is a
trinity in itself. To accentuate that the trinity
of 3, 6 and 9 is special, its triangle has dotted
lines.
All this belong to the basics of cipher
mathematics, in which adding, subtracting,
multiplying, and dividing are the four basic functions, which create
movement in the Flow World. Let us now look at two advanced
functions. The first is doubling. The table below shows the beginning
of the doubling sequence and the cipher root values of each number.
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048
1248751 2 4 8 7 5
In the Shadow World, there are many examples of projections that
result from this doubling series. Firstly, the process of cell division
results in doubling the amount of cells. After 6 divisions, there are 64
cells that together form an independent unity. This cipher root value
also shows this unity, since it is 1. Another example is the digital
programming language based on this doubling series. Combining
binary values (yin or yang) on three positions results in 8 different
trigrams of the I Ching, while combining two trigrams (again yin and
yang) results in 64 hexagrams. Lastly, the chess board also has 8
times 8 makes 64 fields.
The doubling sequence is an infinite repetition of the series of 1, 2, 4,
8, 7, and 5. The opposite is true for the complementary function of



108 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
halving, as shown in the table below. Halving results in an infinite
repetition of the series of 1, 5, 7, 8, 4, and 2.
1 0.5 0.25 0.125 0.0625 0.03125 0.015625 0.0078125
15 7 8 4 2 1 5
The table below puts both series next to each other. The ciphers 1
and 8 appear simultaneously in both series. At the other positions, the
reciprocals pair up.
1248751
1578421
In both series, never a 3, a 6, or a 9 appears. Let us see what happens
when we start doubling with 3. The table below shows the beginning
of this series.
3 6 12 24 48 96 192 384 768 1536 3072 6144
363636 3 6 3 6 3 6
Next, the table below shows the first results when we start halving
with a 6.
6 3 1.5 0.75 0.375 0.1875 0.09375 0.046875 0.0234375
36 3 6 3 6 3 6 3
When we apply the functions of doubling and halving to the excep
tional cipher of 9, each result is always a 9.
9 18 36 72 144 288 576 1152 2304 4608 9216
9999 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 1 0.45 0.225 0.1125 0.05625 0.028125 0.0140625
99 9 9 9 9 9 9
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 109
The figure to the left shows each of these
doubling and halving series. The name I use
for this figure is Source Code. Starting at 1,
the line to 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, back to 1 is the dou
bling series for the common ciphers. When
we reverse the direction of this movement, it
represents the halving series for the common
ciphers, which is 1, 5, 7, 8, 4, 2 back to 1.
In this figure, the dotted line represents the
doubling and halving series for the 3 and the
6. This is not a straight horizontal line be
tween the 3 and the 6, but instead a pyramid
shaped line with the 9 at the apex. That is be
cause these three special ciphers together create a special series. This
series bounces back and forth between the 3 and the 6. This series is
follows: 3 9 6 6 9 3.
In the Whole of Reality, everything is always in balance. That is
why, in the Source World, every cipher has both a positive yin value
and a negative yang value. In total, there are 18 different cipher
codes in the Source World:
{ -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, +6, +7, +8, +9 }
That is why the unit of the Tzol’tun is exactly 18 natural days.
Series Coding Sequence Sum
Doubling (+) -1 +2 -4 +8 -7 +5 +3
Special (0) -3 +9 -6 +6 -9 +6 0
Halving (-) +1 -5 +7 -8 +4 -2 -3
The values of the ciphers in each of the three series (the doubling
series, the halving series, and the special series) continuously alter
nate between being positive and being negative. The table above



110 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
shows the sequences of these three series in which each cipher has a
positive or a negative charge.
Adding up the charged ciphers of the doubling series results in a
positive outcome (+3 for each sequence). Therefore, the value of the
doubling series is positive (+). Adding up the charged ciphers of the
halving series results in a negative outcome (-3 for each sequence).
Therefore, the value of the halving series is negative (-). Thirdly,
adding up the charged ciphers of the special series results in a neutral
outcome (0 for each sequence). Therefore, the value of the halving
series is neutral (0).
The three series constitute the threads of which the skin of the For
bidden Apple of Knowledge is made of. These three type of threads
continuously spiral in and out the null point in the center of this ap
ple. This skin of threads is ultimately flexible, allowing infinite
stretching at the apple’s equator and infinite compression in the ap
ple’s core. In the apple’s skin, the threads are always in the same
order, in which the +1 and the -1 always lay next to each other (and
so do -8 and +8).
Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation 111
Time 1 2 3 4 5 6
Halving (-) +4 -2 +1 -5 +7 -8
Special (0) -3 +9 -6 +6 -9 +6
Doubling (+) +8 -7 +5 -1 +2 -4
Sum +9 0 0 0 0 -9
The figure below shows the temporal changes in the sum values as
represented in the previous table. This graph depicts the apple’s heart
beat.
In the structure of the apple’s skin, three threads form a trinity. An
illustrating example of this trinity lies hidden in the genetic codes of
all organisms found in deoxyribonucleic acid (abbreviated as DNA).
This acid consists of two long polymers of
simple units called nucleotides. These poly
mers are the shadows of the doubling and
halving series. In between these polymers,
there are the projections of the special series. This again shows why
the special series is special, since its
projections do not create material
shadows, like the doubling and the
halving series do.



112 Wholly Science – Understanding the Process of Creation
There are four types of molecules called nucleobases that enable the
adjacent nucleotides of both polymers to connect, each correspond
ing to a different type of energy, as shown in the table below.
Earth Air Water Fire
Guanine (G) Cytosine (C) Adenine (A) Thymine (T)
Just like Earth and Air are the inner compressed phases of spiraling
energy, the connection between guanine and cytosine is stronger,
based on 3 hydrogen bonds. The connection between adenine and
thymine is weaker, because it is based on 2 hydrogen bonds. This
matches with the outer expanded phases of spiraling energy of Water
and Fire. Again, the Harmonic Ratio Base Numbers of 2 and 3 play
an important role.
Both polymers form 2 helixes. Together with the invisible middle
helix there are 3 helixes in DNA, forming a trinity. In the genetic cod
ing itself we find another trinity. The fundamental unit with the
genes consists of 3 consecutive nucleobases. For each of the 3 posi
tions in this genetic trinity, there are 4 possibilities (G, C, A, or T).
Therefore, the total amount of different unit codes are 64 (4×4×4).
Again, we see an example of how a unit (1) corresponds to the
amount of 64, as represented in the doubling or halving cycle in the
Source Code.
Each unit of 3 consecutive nucleobases contains the genetic code
of a single amino acid. The amino acids are the fundamental units for
the creation of proteins, which are the carriers of each cell’s life
force. In human body cells, there are 20 different amino acids. This is
precisely the same amount as the number of different signs in the
Tzol’kin (and the number of discs in the game of international
draughts). At the cellular level, 20 amino acids play the game of life,
and the same do the 20 personal identity types corresponding to the
signs in the Tzol’kin at human level. The root value of 20 is 2, which
in the doubling series is the successor of 1, the root value of 64.
Again, this fully corresponds to the connecting line in the Source
Code.

Let us now look at a deck
of playing cards. Both red
motifs (of diamonds and
hearts) represent the yin
energies, while both black
motifs (of spades and
clubs) represent the yang
energies. Spades corre
sponds to the first ener
getic phase after passing
through the zero point.
That is why the symbol of spades represents the number 1. The sym
bol of hearts represents the number 2, and hearts is indeed the first
energetic phase after passing through the zero point. Clubs corre
sponds to the third energetic phase after passing through the zero
point. That is why the symbol of clubs represents the number 3. The
symbol of diamonds represents the number 4, and diamonds is in
deed the fourth energetic phase after passing through the zero point.
In total, there are 13 playing cards of each of these four motifs
(or colors). Nine of these cards have numbers, each representing one
of the nine ciphers. Next, each of the remaining four cards corre
sponds to one of the four types of energy, as shown in the table be
low.
Earth Air Water Fire
Diamonds Spades Hearts Clubs

5. Concluding Summary
Everything we are able to perceive or detect belongs to the outer ring
of the Whole of Reality. What we consider to be the real reality is in
fact just a shadow. All material manifestations in this third ring are
holographic reflections of movement in the second ring. That is why
everything in the Shadow World always moves. Modern science is
unable to explain these motions, because it limited itself to investi
gating only shadow phenomena.
Ancient Science describes the flowing nature of life energy. The
Forbidden Apple of Knowledge displays the continuous flow of life
energy. The Apple represents the spiraling dynamics in the Flow
World, being the second ring of the Whole of Reality.
In the core of the Whole of Reality, we find only 9 ciphers, each
having two possible charges. Each cipher represents a ratio, since
each value in the Whole of Reality is always relative to other values.
The Apple’s skin is made of threads of these charged ciphers in fixed
sequences. The spiraling motions of these threads project the shad
ows we experience as being real.

Everything in nature has a rhythm.
Nature is constantly dancing, on all
levels. In order to fully understand
this, we need a new scientific para
digm. The old paradigm beliefs that
energy originates from matter. The
new paradigm shows us that matter
originates from energy.
This book applies this new scien
tific paradigm to explain the es
sence of nature. It shows simple
solutions for all the problems of the old science. However, this new
science is not so new at all, since it brings us right back to the legacy
of Pythagoras.
This small book (of only 48 pages) explains how to solve all mayor
planetary problems (such as poverty, violence and pollution). Since
governments and universities are not able to do all this (in fact, they
only make it worse), we better do it our selves. Everybody can un
derstand and apply the fundamental insights of this new science. In
short, it shows us the way to ultimate empowerment.
Just like ‘Wholly Science’, also ‘Understanding Nature’ and ‘The
Bigger Picture’ are available as a free online e-books on the Eng
lish section of Pateo.nl.
