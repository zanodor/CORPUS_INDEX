Indus Script is linguistic hieroglyphic writing कणर्क 'rim
of-jar' rebus करर् 'writer, scribe' kunda singi ‘lathe,
spiny-horn’ rebus ‘fine, ornament gold’
This monograph demonstrates the reason why 1) 'rim-of-jar' hieroglyph Sign 342 and 2) spinyhorned young bull + standard device as field symbols are the most frequently used hieroglyphs/hypertexts in Indus Script Corpora of over 8000 inscriptions. The inscriptions are wealth-accounting ledgers of metalwork, lapidarywork, working with minerals, metals, alloys, molten metal infusions, metal castings, metal ingots, metalware, metal equipment, metal tools, metal weapons, gems and jewels.
The principal critiques and arguments which reject the Indus Script as a 'writing system' based on syllables or phonetics of a language are summarised in the references listed in Annex 5 These critiques and arguments also posit that as a 'non-script', the Indus Script artefacts with 'nonlinguistic' symbols may relate to rituals and tithes offered by adorants. See: Annex 5 Critiques and arguments about Indus Script as a system of non-linguistic symbols
I accept, based on the Meluhha rebus readings of the hieroglyphs and hypertexts that the symbols signify wealth resources, as demonstrated on a panel of four sculptural friezes on Shalamaneser III Black obelisk (827 BCE), showing animals which are hieroglyphs of Indus Script as tributes offered by 'the land of Musri'.
For example, there is a monkey dressed as a woman offered as a tribute. This is an Indus Script hypertext.

connoisseur of jewels and gems. रत्निाटी ratnavāṭī f (Poetry.) A saucer-form dish with diamonds (or other jewels) attached.
This monograph counters these critiques and arguments by presenting evidences of archaeological contexts and of evolution of languages in Ancient India in an Indian sprachbund (language union) or linguistic area.



3
The critiques do not refer to or acknowledge archaeologically attested 'symbols' which relate to economic transactions of wealth-creation and trade transactions involving metalwork and lapidary artifacts such as tools, gems, jewels, etched carnelian, lapis-lazuli, agate beads..
Formation and evolution of Indus Script writing system is related to metalwork trade as seen from the archaeologically attested Susa pot containing metalwork equipment, weapons,metalware and tools.
Context for use of ‘fish’ glyph. This photograph of a fish and the ‘fish’ glyph on Susa pot are comparable to the ‘fish’ glyph on Indus inscriptions. Fish hieroglyph: aya 'fish' rebus: ayas 'alloy metal'. Read on the arguments at: http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2011/11/decoding-fish-andligatured-fish-glyphs.html
A bilingual cylinder seal with an Akkadian text message provides a trade framework which explains the form and function of the Indus Script as a writing system.

That the Meluhhan traders (shown carrying a goat and a liquid measure) are transacting for trade in tin and copper is archaeologically attested by the surprising find that most of the copper of Ancient Near East came from Gujarat and Rajasthan.
Copper from Gujarat used in Mesopotmia, 3rd millennium BCE, evidenced by lead isotope analyses of tin-bronze objects; report by Begemann F. et al. 1. Title: Über das frühe Kupfer Mesopotamiens 2. Author(s): BEGEMANN, F. , SCHMITT-STRECKER, S. Journal: Iranica Antiqua Volume: 44 Date: 2009 Pages: 1-45 DOI: 10.2143/IA.44.0.2034374 2. Abstract :
A lIranica Antiqua
Geographical locations of sites of Mesopotamia from which artifacts were analyzed in this work (After Fig. 1 in Begemann, F. et al, 2009 loc.cit.) The conclusion is:

"Unsere bleiisotopische evidenz legt nahe, das in Mesopotamien fur legierung mit zinn verwendete kupfer urudu-luh-ha stamme aus Indien, was ebenfalls vertraglich ist mit einem import via dilmun." (Trans. Our lead isotope evidence suggests that the urudu-luh-ha copper used in Mesopotamia for tin alloying is from India, which is also contracted with an import via Dilmun.)" (opcit., p.28) 3. A lead isotope study »On the Early copper of Mesopotamia« reports on copper-base artefacts ranging in age from the 4th millennium BC (Uruk period) to the Akkadian at the end of the 3rd millennium BC. Arguments are presented that, in the (tin)bronzes, the lead associated with the tin used for alloying did not contribute to the total in any detectable way. Hence, the lead isotopy traces the copper and cannot address the problem of the provenance of tin. The data suggest as possible source region of the copper a variety of ore occurrences in Anatolia, Iran, Oman, Palestine and, rather unexpectedly (by us), from India. During the earliest period the isotopic signature of ores from Central and North Anatolia is dominant; during the next millennium this region loses its importance and is hardly present any more at all. Instead, southeast Anatolia, central Iran, Oman, Feinan-Timna in the rift valley between Dead Sea and Red Sea, and sources in the Caucasus are now potential suppliers of the copper. Generally, an unambiguous assignment of an artefact to any of the ores is not possible because the isotopic fingerprints of ore occurrences are not unique. In our suite of samples bronze objects become important during ED III (middle of the 3rd millennium BC) but they never make up more than 50 % of the total. They are distinguished in their lead isotopy by very high 206Pb-normalized abundance ratios. As source of such copper we suggest Gujarat/Southern Rajasthan which, on general grounds, has been proposed before to have been the most important supplier of copper in Ancient India. We propose this Indian copper to have been arsenic-poor and to be the uruduluh-ha variety which is one of the two sorts of purified copper mentioned in contemporaneous written texts from Mesopotamia to have been in circulation there concurrently. That the source of tin for the Tin-Bronze revolution came through India is clearly seen in the decipherment of three pure tin ingots with Indus Script insciptions discovered in a shipwreck in Haifa, Israel.
I suggest that the tin (cassiterite ore) was sourced from the largest tin belt of the globe which is in Himalayan river basins of Ancient Far East as seen on the Geological Survey of USA Map. Tin ore was made into tin ingots by artisans of India and traded the ingots specifying the cargo on Indus Script inscriptions written on the tin ingots.

Decipherment of the Meluhha Indus Script inscriptions on these ingots:
ranku-dhatu-muh 'tin mineral ingot'. Ingot 1: ranku 'antelope' rebus: ranku 'tin' dATu 'cross'rebus: dhatu 'mineral ore' Ingot 2:ranku 'liquid measure' rebus: ranku 'tin' dATu 'cross' rebus: dhatu 'mineral ore' Ingot 3:ranku 'liquid measure' rebus:ranku 'tin' dATu 'cross' rebus: dhatu 'mineral ore' muh 'face' rebus:muh 'ingot'
JIJS 17, 2019 (forthcoming) carries a communication: Three tin ingots of Haifa shipwreck with Indus (Sarasvati) hieroglyphs reinforces the Meluhha rebus reading ranku dhatu mũh, ‘tin mineral-ore ingot’.This is an addendum to my article: The Bronze Age Writing System of
Sarasvati Hieroglyphics as Evidenced by Two “Rosetta Stones” By S. Kalyanaraman in: Journal of Indo-Judaic Studies (JIJS) Volume 1: Number 11 (2010), pp. 47-74.)
The rationale for the counters offered are as follows:
1. The script symbols are based on the underlying words of Meluhha parole (speech, as distinct from langue 'language') signified by the pictures which may be called hieroglyphs or hypertexts (compositions including hieroglyphs);
2. the rebus or similar sounding homonym words yield a decipherment that the inscriptions are accounting ledgers of economic or trade or wealth transactions by artisans and seafaring merchants in contact areas of Ancient Near East extending from the Sarasvati and Sindhu river basins which constitute the epicentre of the civilization.
For example, Sign 342 PLUS Sign 15 are composed to create a hypertext which is Sign 12.

PLUS results in Hypertext
Signs 342 and 12 are evolved from pictorial motifs of water-carrier and rim-of-jar as seen from the following examples from Indus Script Corpora.

dula 'two' rebus: dul 'metal casting'
The sign constitutges a hypertext with two hieroglyphs: 1. Hieroglyph: maĩd ʻrude harrow or clod breakerʼ (Marathi) rebus: mẽṛhẽt,med 'iron' (Mu.Ho.) med 'copper' (Slavic) PLUS 2. Hieroglyph: karṇaka कणर्क m. du. the two legs spread out AV. xx , 133 , 3;

Thus, the entire inscription of m1274a conveys the meaning, message: cargo authenticated by scribe of metal castings of bronze, (made by) artisan smelters.

young man. పడుచువాడు . A lover విటుడు . The Meluhha word is pronounced with a nasal tone
of the guttural syllable kho-, in Marathi: खोंड khōṇḍa 'young bull'.
Youth or tenderness is also signified by 'sprout' words which include the phoneme: koḍ
'sprout' rebus: koḍ 'workshop', with many phonetic variants in Meluhha (Indian sprachbund, language union or linguistic area). This Sign 169 is distinguished from a rice-plant hieroglyph
Sign 162 kolmo 'rice plant' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge' Thus, koḍ 'workshop', signifies a workplace for cireperdue metal casting, repairs to implements, metalware etc while the smithy forges ingots and wedges into metalware, metal equipment. Such a forge is signified by the hieroglyph, Sign 162.
Workshops signified by Sign 169 may be on circular working platforms of Sarasvati Civilization sites. See. for e.g. circular platforms of Harappa.

To the south of the "granary" or "great hall" at Harappa is an area with numerous circular working platforms that were built inside small rooms or courtyards. These circular working platforms may have been used for husking grain. One of these circular platforms had what may have been a large wooden mortar placed in the center. https://www.harappa.com/slide/working-platforms-harappa

Sign 342 'rim-of-jar' hieroglyph is read in Meluhha parole (speech) as: kárṇa 'handle of a vessel' (Rgveda).
This Sign 342 on Indus Script inscriptions (over 8000 inscriptions have been found so far, dated from ca. 3300 BCE) signifies authentication of cargo maritime trade transaction by the writer, scribe, करर् |
What is a script? A script is a writing system to convey meaning using words of the language of a scribe and the same language repertoire of words understood for 'meanings' by recipients of the message..
In this definition of a script. Indus Script is a writing system of a spoken language called Meluhha.
Scribes who prepare Indus Script messages are Meluhha speakers.



12
Recipients of the written messages are artisans and seafaring merchants of Meluhha who aar also called mleccha 'copper (workers)'.Meluhha was the parole, spoken version of the language of the scribes and Meluhha artisans and seafarint merchants.
The writing system as a means of communication of messages has been designed to document wealth resources used and wealth-yielding products produced by the artisans who are Meluhha speakers.
The writing system is thus designed for a specific purpose by artisans and traders. The purpose is to proclaim through proclamations as on Dholavira Signboard and Indus Script inscriptions, documenting the wealth produced and/or handled by them as cargo for maritime trade. Thus, Indus Script as a writing system is a wealth-accounting documentation by artisan-merchant guilds who are Meluhha (mleccha) language speakers.
It is an error in understanding to define early scripts as phonetic systems designed to record all phonemes, all syllables unique to a language. Indus Script is a wealth-accounting system recorded by scribes who are also accountants. Such a Meluhha scribe is called in Meluhha language,
The fact that in Meluhha, the word करण means a 'writer, scribe' is confirmed by the
expression (semantic expansion) कर्णिका which means 'a pen , small brush'.
The message conveying such a word करर् is to confirm that the message is authenticated by the scribe who signs off on the message with the symbol of a rim of a vessel or jar.
The pictograph of a rim-of-jar, conveys the Meluhha word कणर्क | When read rebus to derive the
plain text from the cipher text, the word is read as करर् 'certified, authenticated by scribe, writer'.
Pictorial synonyms of 'rim-of-jar' hieroglyph are: 'spread legs' signified by pictographs: 1. a person standing with spread legs; 2. pericarp of lotus; 3. ears ligatured to underlying hieroglyph of symbol (e.g. loa 'ficus glomerata'); 4. posture of an ascetic
Item 1. A person standing with spread legs
Sign 1 (Mahadevan, ASI 1977 Concordance)
Sign 3 draws attention on spread legs by a 'notch' ligatured to Sign 1, creating Sign 3 to convey the word कणिक m. du. the two legs spread out AV. xx , 133 , 3; to be read rebus as
(authenticated, certified, signed-off by) करण m. writer , scribe



13
Item 2. Rim-of-jar
The Meluhha word which conveys the meaning of 'rim-of-jar' shown in the pictograph or Sign 342 is: कणिक m. (ifc. f(आ).) a prominence or handle or projection on the side or sides (of a vessel &c ) In Meluhha pronunciation, the word is pronounced and heard as: kankha or khankha. There are many variant pronunciations in Meluhha (Ancient Indian languages of Sarasvati Civilization) Rebus reading in Meluhha parole is: kāraṇika m. ʻ teacher ʼ MBh., ʻ judge ʼ

3058) French parole ("voice, spoken words" but also "promise". Thus, affixing Sign 342 is an authentication, a promise of the authenticity of the message of cargo transactions recorded in writing. The writer, scribe is also a supercargo of a ship; he is kārṇī m. ʻprime minister,
supercargo of a shipʼ; कारर्ी or कारर्ी क kāraṇī or kāraṇīka a (कारर् S) That causes, conducts, carries on, manages. Applied to the prime minister of a state, the supercargo of a ship &38;c. 2 Useful, serviceable, answering calls or occasions (Marathi)

Indus Script Cipher uses a cypher text to yield the plain text. The cipher is the set of principles which define the form and function of the writing system. The remarkable feature of the Indus Script Corpora of over 8000 inscriptions is that the Cipher or the basic set of principles for 'coding' are standardized across the entire civilization contact area.

Standardization of text messaging and pictorial natifs of the writing system, with uniformity across the civilizational contact area
The standardization is achieved because of the use of Meluhha language which is the lingua franca of the artisans and seafaring merchants of the civilization.
Meluhha language. renders rebus readings (i.e readings of pictorial words and readings of similar-sounding wealth-products and wealth-resources) -- cipher text signifies Meluhha words as logographs; plain text signifies similar sounding Meluhha words as the rebus renderings in Indus Script Cipher.
For example, the picture of an elephant or trunk part of the elephantant is signified by the cipher text (picture) Meluhha words karibha, ibha , 'elephant'.
Similar-sounding words constitute the plain text of Meluhha words -- karba, ib which mean 'iron, ferrite ore'.
This is how, Indus Script cipher conveys meaning of the written document called Indus Script Inscription (which includes pictorial motifs and text (signs, combinations of signs) as messages related to wealth-resources or wealth-products created and transported by the artisans and seafaring merchants, respectively).
The level of standardiztion achieved across a vast domain of more than 2600 sites civilization -stretching from Rakhigarhi to Susa is remarkable. Identical cipher or codes which signify the pictures of logographs to convey in associated words of Meluhha language may be seen from the following two sets of exampes: Set 1 Text messages using identical hieroglyphs or hieroglyph-compositions as hypertexts 2. Pictorial messages using identical combinations of animal heads or animal parts to create composite animals as hypertexts.
1. Standardization of Text messages with identifal hieroglyps or hypertexts
Two text messages are presented from Mohenjo-daro and Harappa to demonstrate the use of 'hypertext' principle of Indus Script cipher, i.e. combining hieroglyphs to create hypertexts. In these cases, an oval shape hieroglyph is a circumscript of Sign 169 'sprout' hieroglyph.

On the two large seals, shown below, one is from Harappa and another from Mohenjo-daro,. At least two signs are : one common: one sign shows a sprout and another shows the spout infixed within an oval-bun-shaped ingot.
'sprout 'bun ingot + sprout'. Both these signs are used on Harppa seal and on Mohenjo-daro seal. Thus, in two large sites, the large seals with text messages use the Indus Script Cipher of hypertexting, i.e combination of signs or hieroglyphs to construct hypertexts. Hieroglyph of bun ingot of oval or rhombus shape is used as a circumscript on Sign 169 (sprout) to yield the hypertext of Sign 389.

2. Standardization of Pictorial motifs with identical combinations of animal heads or animal parts to create composite hypertexts
On the following seals from Mohenjo-daro, Amri and Kalibangan, a standardized writing system based on Indus Script Cipher is seen. This cipher involves combination of animal heads or unique animal parts (e.g. trunk of elephant, horns of zebu, tail as cobrahood, bovine front legs,



30
feline hindlegs) fused into a common body (bovine) to signify three artisanal resources and products produced or processed on by the artisans..

Parenthesis which encloses the bird is a split lozenge or ingot shape: mũh 'a face' in Indus Script Cipher signifies mũh, muhã 'ingot' or muhã 'quantity of metal produced at one time in a native smelting furnace.'
sal 'splinter' rebus: sal 'workshop'. Thus the hypertext composed of four hieroglyphs: bird, ingot, parenthesis, splinter is a Meluhha expression which signifies: workshop (for) magnetite, ferrite ore, steel ingot .

The inscription on Mohenjodaro seal m1169 is thus a repository of technical information about metalwork produced by the artisan guild of smithy/forge and transacted for trade. The metalwork catalogue documents the wealth created and traded by working with 1. magnetite (ferrite) ore in furnaces to produce hard iron (steel); 2 bharata, alloy of copper, pewter, tin; 3. copper, ayas metal alloy; 5. metals engraving/sculpting using cire perdue (lost-wax) technique to produce ingots and metal implements.

Is this person comparable to the Mohenjo-daro priest?
I suggest a better comparison is with the Mari priest on a marble plaque.

Vidale, Massimo, 2007, The collapse melts down: a reply to Farmer, Sproat and Witzel. East and West, 57:333-366. Excerpts from http://www.safarmer.com Steve Farmer, Richard Sproat, and Michael Witzel, The collapse of the Indus-script thesis: The myth of a literate Harappan civilization. EJVS 11-2 (13 Dec. 2004): 19-57. (Hundreds of thousands of downloads since its publication.) See on the violant international debate this article generated Science 2004 (306): 2026-9. On my collaborators, see Richard Sproat (computational linguistics, then at the University of Illinois and now a Senior Staff Research Scientist at Google, Manhattan) and now at Google, Manhattan) and Michael Witzel (Indology, comparative mythology, and linguistics, Harvard University). Abstract of our original 2004 paper, which has spawned hundreds of newspaper articles and violent reactions from Indian nationalists: Archaeologists have long claimed the Indus Valley as one of the four literate centers of the early ancient world, complete with long texts written on perishable materials. We demonstrate the impossibility of the lost-manuscript thesis and show that Indus symbols were not even evolving in linguistic directions after at least 600 years of use. Suggestions as to how Indus symbols were used are noted in nonlinguistic symbol systems in the Near East that served key religious, political, and social functions without
encoding speech or serving as formal memory aids. Evidence is reviewed that the Harappans’ lack of a true script may have been tied to the role played by their symbols in controlling large multilinguistic populations; parallels are drawn to the later resistance of Brahmin elites to the literate encoding of Vedic sources and to similar phenomena in esoteric traditions outside South Asia. Discussion is provided on some of the political and academic forces that helped

sustain the Indus- script myth for over 130 years and on ways in which our findings transform current views of the Indus Valley and of literacy in the ancient world in general.
On spurious recent claims by Rao et al., see next item.- Steve Farmer, Richard Sproat, and Michael Wizel, A refutation of the claimed refutation of the nonlinguistic nature of Indus symbols: Invented data sets in the statistical paper of Rao et al. (Science, 2009). See also the technical plots and discussion, with links to other deadly critiques of Rao et al. by leading computational linguists, at more on Rao. Later claims by Rao et al. in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [PNAS] that Markov models suggest that Indus symbols were supposedly part of an ancient writing system are similarly trivial to debunk: crude structure in the absurdly short groups of Indus symbols (averaging if all relevant materials were included far under 4.5 signs per supposed "text") has been known since the 1920s and is a feature of all symbol systems -- not as Rao et al. oddly claim only those that encode language. (We discussed this long before Rao's work in Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel 2004 [pp. 20ff. and n. 5 and passim] and Sproat and Farmer 2006 [esp. p. 8ff]. Cf. also Richard Sproat's rightly dismissive note on Rao's claims here). The smoke and mirrors in the work of Rao et al., which via press releases generated lots of attention in the pop press (especially in India), is discussed in further detail in an expanded version of a paper we gave at the critical Indus conference held in Kyoto, Japan, on 29-31 May 2009. For an abstract of that paper (expanded version with other conference papers to appear in early 2010), see Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel, The collapse of the Indus-script thesis, five years later: Massive nonliterate urban civilizations of ancient Eurasia. As the title suggests, the paper discusses implications of the nonlinguistic nature of Indus symbols that reach far beyond India, radically altering our views of ancient urban societies in general. It also responds to polemical attacks on our 2004 paper from Indian nationalists and researchers whose careers have heavily depended on the Indusscript myth.
