EDITOR'S NOTE
MANY people today are keenly interested to know what the Jewish Talmud really teaches about Christians, and for an accurate, authentic treatise on this subject, there is no need to go further than the scholarly work of the Rev . Father B. Pranaitis, an able Roman Catholic theologist and Hebraist, formerly on the staff of the Roman Catholic college of the Imperial Academy in old St . Petersburg . His work is in Hebrew and Latin and bears the imprimatur of his ecclesiastical superior.
This is an accurate translation of Father Pranaitis' Latin text, and it is felt that it will be appreciated by those who are interested to know what this great scholar wrote on this important subject from original Talmudic sources. Father Pranaitis was one of those "liquidated"* by the Cheka during the Bolshevist revolution in Russia .
Many readers will recall that we published a book in 1934 entitled, "Are These Things So?" said by many to reveal many things thereto f ore unknown . No reader with an open mind could answer that titlequestion in the negative . We believe that this present work supplies a sequel to our previous book, and that it proves that such things "Are So ." This work has been carefully translated and edited and will stand the test of scholarship, and therefore win the respect of
the American people . The Intelligence Department of the defense forces of every country must supply, accurate information if defeat is to be avoided .
This book is sent forth by one who has dared to turn on the light of publicity in other publications . We shall watch with interest the reactions that will follow its appearance, and venture to suggest that critics be as careful to document their evidence as has been done with the facts presented herein .

AUTHOR'S DEDICATION
YOUR EXCELLENCY
In order to requite in some measure your very great kindness towards me, evidences of which I have experienced so often and in so many ways, I have undertaken to dedicate this little book to you . It is small in size but has been prepared with great care and labor, and I am led by the hope that you will not spurn it ; for it is the first fruits of the labor of one whom you were once so kindly pleased to style the first fruits of your labors as Rector of this Academy . I therefore beg your Excellency to bless this work which I have recently completed, so that it may fulfil the purpose for which it was written . Bless me also that I may soon accomplish greater works for the glory of God and for the honor and advancement of our Alma Mater, over which you have ruled for eight years, and of which you are its greatest ornament .
May these pages be to Your Excellency the proof of my perpetual and sincere love and gratitude.
Your Excellency's devoted disciple, IUSTINUS BONAVENTURA PRANAITIS

ANTIPHONE
"Let our writings be open to all the people . Let them see what our moral code is like! We need not be afraid of this test, for we have a pure heart and a clean spirit . Let the nations investigate the habitations of the children of Israel, and of their own accord convince themselves of what they are really like ! They will then exclaim for certain with Baalam, when he went out to curse Israel : `How beautiful are thy tents 0 Israel : how beautiful thy homes!"
"In its attitude towards non-Jews, the Jewish religion is the most tolerant of all the religions in the world . . . . The precepts of the ancient Rabbis, though inimical to Gentiles, cannot be applied in any way to Christians ." 2
"A whole series of opinions can be quoted from the writings of the highest Rabbinical authorities to prove that these teachers inculcated in their own people a great love and respect for Christians, in order that they might look upon Christians, who believe in the true God, as brothers, and pray for them ." 3

PROLOGUE
M
ANY people who are interested in the Jewish question are wont
l~1 to ask whether or not there is anything in the Talmud which is not beautiful and sublime, and entirely removed from anything
like hatred of Christians . The confusion of opinion about the matter is so great, that to listen to those who argue so wisely about it, you would think that they were discussing a very ancient and remote race of people, and not the people of Israel who live in our midst
according to an unchanging moral code by which the religious and social life of the Jews has been regulated to this day .
This being so, I have undertaken to show what the Talmud really teaches about Christians, and thus satisfy the wishes of those who desire to find out about this doctrine from genuine original sources .
To this end I have translated the best known Talmudic books which refer to the Christians, and have arranged these sources in such order as to bring out clearly the picture of a Christian as represented to the Jews by the Talmud .
Lest I be accused of using a corrupted text of the Talmud or of not having interpreted it correctly, as is generally the case with those who have attempted to disclose secret Jewish teachings, I have placed the Hebrew text opposite the Latin . 5
I have divided the whole into two sections, the first of which treats of the teachings of the Talmud about Christians, and the other, the rules which Jews are obliged to follow when living among Christians .
I preface these with a brief discussion about the Talmud itself in the following chapter .
5 In this book the Hebrew text has been omitted-Translator.

THE TALMUD
THE TALMUD gets its name from the word LAMUD taught, and means The Teaching . By metonymy it is taken to mean the book which contains the Teaching, which teaching is called Talmud, that is, the doctrinal book which alone fully expounds and explains all the knowledge and teaching of the Jewish people .
As to the origin of the Talmud, the Rabbis 6 regard Moses as its first author. They hold that, besides the written law which Moses received from God on Mount Sinai on tables of stone, which is called Torah Schebiktab, he also received interpretations of it, or the oral law, which is called Torah Shebeal Peh . They say that this is the reason why Moses remained so long on the mountain, as God could have given him the written law in one day .' Moses is said to have transmitted this oral law to Joshua ; Joshua
in turn to the seventy Elders ; these Elders to the Prophets, and the
Prophets to the Great Synagogue . It is held that it was later transmitted successively to certain Rabbis until it was no longer possible to retain it orally .
Whatever may be said about this story of the Rabbis, it is sufficiently known to us that before the birth of Christ, schools existed
in Palestine in which sacred literature was taught . The commentaries of the Doctors of the law were noted down on charts and
6 cf. Rabbi Levi in Berakhoth, fol . 5a ; Rabbi Iochanan in Megillah, f .19b.
7 To prove this they appeal to Exodus Ch . XXIV, 12 : "And the Lord
God said to Moses, come up to me into the mountain, and be there : and I
will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have
written ; that thou mayest teach them ." They assert that in this passage the
words "tables of stone" mean the ten commandments, that "a law" means
the Pentateuch, "commandments" mean the Mischnah ; "which I have writ
ten" the Prophets and the Hagiographers ; and "that thou mayest teach
them" the Gernarah. cf . Berakhoth, fol . 5a.



11
lists as an aid to memory, and these, when collected together, formed the beginnings of the Jewish Talmud .
In the second century after Christ, Rabbi Jehuda who, because of the sanctity of his life, was called The Saint, and The Prince, realizing that the learning of the Jews was diminishing, that their oral law was being lost, and that the Jewish people were being dispersed, was the first to consider ways and means of restoring and preserving their oral law . He collected all the lists and charts and from them he made a book which was called the Sepher Mischnaioth, or Mischnah - a Deuterosis, or secondary law . He divided it into six parts, each of which was divided into many chapters . We shall consider these later .
The Mischnah is the foundation and the principal part of the whole Talmud . This book was accepted by the Jews everywhere and was recognized as their authentic code of law . It was expounded in their Academies in Babylon -at Sura, Pumbaditha and Nehardea - and in their Academies in Palestine - at Tiberias, Iamnia and Lydda .
As the interpretations increased with the passing of time, the disputations and decisions of the doctors of the law concerning the Mischnah were written down, and these writings constituted another part of the Talmud called the Gemarah .
These two parts are so disposed throughout the whole Talmud that the Mischnah serves first as a kind of text of the law, and is followed by the Gemarah as an analysis of its various opinions leading to definite decisions .
All the precepts of the Mischnah, however, were not discussed in the Jewish schools . Those whose use was nullified by the destruction of the Temple, and those whose observation was possible only in the Holy Land were not commented upon . Their explanation was left until the coming of Elias and the Messiah . For this reason some parts of the Mischnah are lacking in the Gemarah. In interpreting the Mischnah of Rabbi Jehuda, the schools of Palestine and Babylon followed each their own method, and by thus following their own way gave rise to a twofold Gemarah



12
the Jerusalem and the Babylonian versions . The author of the
Jerusalem version was Rabbi Jochanan, who was head of the synagogue in Jerusalem for eighty years . He wrote thirty-nine chapters of commentaries on the Mischnah which he completed in the year 230 A .D .
The Babylonian Gemarah, however, was not compiled by any one person, nor at any one time . Rabbi Aschi began it in 327 A .D. and labored over it for sixty years . He was followed by Rabbi Maremar about the year 427 A .D ., and it was completed by Rabbi Abina about the year 500 A.D . The Babylonian Gennarah has thirty-six chapters of interpretations .
This twofold Gemarah, added to the Mischnah, makes also a twofold Talmud : the Jerusalem version, which, on account of its brevity and obscurity, is not much used ; and the Babylonian version, which has been held in the highest esteem by Jews of all times . The Gemarah is followed by additions called Tosephoth . s It was thus that Rabbi Chaia first styled his opinions on the Mischnaioth . He and Rabbi Uschaia were the first to explain this book publicly in the schools . Commentaries on the Mischnah which were made by the doctors outside the schools were called Baraietoth, or extraneous opinions .
These Commentaries were further supplemented by other decisions called Piske Tosephoth, short theses and simple principles .
For nearly five hundred years after the Babylonian Talmud was completed, the study of literature was greatly hampered partly due to public calamities and partly owing to dissensions among the scholars. But in the eleventh century others wrote further additions to the Talmud . Chief among these were the Tosephoth of Rabbi Ascher . Besides these there appeared the Perusch of Rabbi Moische ben Maimon, called by the Jews Rambam for short, by the Christians Maimonides, and by Rabbi Schelomo, larchi or Raschi .
s From Tosepheth, or Tosiphta, meaning addition . 9 From Baria, extraneous, or Baraietha, extraneous teaching.



Thus, the Mischnah, Gemarah, Tosephoth, the marginal notes of
Rabbi Ascher, the Piske Tosephoth and the Perusch Hamischnaioth of Maimonides, all collected into one, constitute a vast work which
is called The Talmud . ****

18
included in the regular Talmud . They have been added by later

Since the Talmud was such a voluminous and disordered work, there was need of a compendium which would facilitate its study . To supply this need, therefore, Rabbi Isaac ben Jacob Alphassi, in 1032, published a Shorter Talmud, which he called HalakhothConstitutions . He omitted all lengthy discussions and preserved only those parts which had to do with the practical things of life . Since this work, however, had no order to it, it was not considered of great worth .
The first to issue a well ordered work on Jewish Law was Maimonides, styled the "Eagle of the Synagogue ." In 1180 he produced his celebrated work Mischnah Torah-Repetition of the Law, also called lad Chazakah.the Strong Hand . It contains four parts or volumes and 14 books and includes the whole Talmud . Maimonides also included much philosophical discussion in this work and attempted to establish many laws of his own . Because of this he was excommunicated by his people and condemned to death . He fled to Egypt where he died in the year 1205 .



19
In spite of this, the value of his work increased in time, and for a while an expurgated version was held in the highest esteem by the Jews . A drawback to this work is that it contains many laws which were of no value after the destruction of the Temple .
An edition of the work of Maimonides, expurgated of all his philosophical innovations and of all the old, useless laws, was edited in 1340, in strict accord with the ideas of the Rabbis, by Jacob ben Ascher, to which he gave the name Arbaa Turim-The Four Orders, which are
I. ORACH CHAIIM : The seeds of Life, and treats of the daily life in the home and in the Synagogue.
II . LORE DEAH : which teaches knowledge about foods, purifications and other religious laws .
III . CHOSCHEN HAMMISCHPAT : private judgments about civil and criminal laws .
IV. EBHEN HAEZER : The Rock of Help, which treats of the laws of marriage.
Since Alphasi, Maimonides and Jacob ben Ascher disagreed on many points, which gave rise to different interpretations of the same law, there was great need of a book which would contain short, concise solutions to controversies, and which would supply to the Jewish people a law book worthy of the name .
Joseph Karo, a Rabbi of Palestine (born 1488, died 1577), sup
plied this need by his celebrated commentary on the Arbaa Turim,
which he called Schulchan Arukh - the Prepared Table . Since,
however, the customs of oriental Jews differed greatly from those of western Jews, even the Schulchan Arukh of Joseph Karo did not suffice for Jews everywhere . And for this reason Rabbi Mosche Isserles wrote a commentary on the Schulchan Arukh, entitled Darkhe Mosche, The Way of Moses, which received the same acceptance in the West as the work of Joseph Karo in the East .
At the present time, the Schulchan Arukh is regarded as the obligatory Law Code of the Jews, and they use it principally in



20
their studies ." Many commentaries have been written on each part of this book .
An important point to note is that this work has always been regarded by the Jews as holy. They have always held it, and still hold it, as more important than the Sacred Scriptures . The Talmud itself shows this very clearly
In the tract Babha Metsia, fol . 33a, we read :
"Those who devote themselves to reading the Bible exercise a certain virtue, but not very much ; those who study the Mischnah exercise virtue for which they will receive a reward ; those, however, who take upon themselves to study the Gemarah exercise the highest virtue." Likewise in the tract Sopherim XV, 7, fol . 13b :
"The Sacred Scripture is like water, the Mischnah wine, and the Gemarah aromatic wine ." The following is a well-known and highly praised opinion in the writings of the Rabbis
"My son, give heed to the words of the scribes rather
than to the words of the law ." 12 The reason for this is found in the tract Sanhedrin X, 3, f .88b :
"He who transgresses the words of the scribes sins more gravely than the transgressors of the words of the law." Also when there are differences of opinion between the Law and the doctors, both must be taken as the words of the Lord God . In the tract Erubhin, f . 13b, where it is related that there was a difference of opinion between the two schools of Hillel and Schamai, it is concluded that
"The words of both are the words of the living God ." In the book Mizbeach, 13 cap . V, we find the following opinion
"There is nothing superior to the Holy Talmud ." Contemporary defenders of the Talmud speak of it almost in the same way. 14
"To Jews of today the Talmud has the same value as the works of the
Church Fathers have for Christians . The Schulchan Arukh corresponds to
our Compendium of Theology . 12 cf . Erubhin, f. 21b . 13 cf. Joan. Buxtorf, Recensio operis Talmud, p . 225. 14 cf . Talmud Babli, Tract. Berachoth, Berlin edit., 1842. Pref. p. 8 .



21
What Christians have thought of the Talmud is amply proved by the many edicts and decrees issued about it, by which the supreme rulers in Church and State proscribed it many times and condemned this sacred Secondary Law Code of the Jews to the flames . In 553 the Emperor Justinian forbade the spread of the Tal
mudic books throughout the Roman Empire . 15 In the 13th century "Popes Gregory IX and Innocent IV condemned the books of the Talmud as containing every kind of vileness and blasphemy against Christian truth, and ordered them to be burned because they spread many horrible heresies ." 16 Later they were condemned by many other Roman PontiffsJulius III, Paul IV, Pius IV, Pius V, Gregory XIII, Clement VIII, Alexander VII, Benedict XIV, and by others who issued new editions of the Index of Forbidden Books according to the orders of the Fathers of the Council of Trent, and even in our own time . 17 [As to the attitude of the Catholic Church towards the Jews, see Appendix at the end of this book : "How the Popes Treated the Jews ."]
15 cf. Authenticae Constitutiones, Novella 146 . 16 Cf . Corp. iuris can . VII Decretal, lib. V, Tit .IV, cap .l .
17 In the latest edition of this Index Expurgatorius "by order of Our
Holy Lord Pope Leo XIII now happily governing the Church of Christ,"
issued in 1887, "The Talmud and other Jewish books" are proscribed as fol
lows : "Although in the Index issued by Pope Pius IV, the Jewish Talmud
with all its glossaries, annotations, interpretations and expositions were pro
hibited ; but if published without the name Talmud and without its vile
calumnies against the Christian religion they could be tolerated ; however
Our Holy Lord Pope Clement VIII in his Constitution against impious writ
ings and Jewish books, published in Rome in the year of Our Lord 1592 . . .
proscribed and condemned them : it was not his intention thereby to permit
or tolerate them even under the above conditions ; for he expressly and spe
cially stated and willed, that the impious Talmudic, Cabalistic and other ne
farious books of the Jews be entirely condemned and that they must remain
always condemned and prohibited, and that his Constitution about these
books must be perpetually and inviolably observed ."
The latest attempt to extirpate the Talmudic books was undertaken in
1510 by Emperor Maximilian who, having been urged thereto by the converted
Jew Johannus Pfefferkorn, ordered that Jewish books be confiscated and
handed over to the Universities to be examined . This gave rise to the famous
"Reuchlinian" controversy, from the name of Reuchlin, who was adviser to
the Duke of Wirtenberg, and who defended parts of the Talmud . He was

At the beginning of the 16th century, when the peace of the Church was disturbed by new religions, the Jews began to distribute the Talmud openly, aided by the art of printing then recently invented. The first printed edition of the whole Talmud, containing all its blasphemies against the Christian religion, 18 was published in Venice in the year 1520 . 19 And almost all Jewish books published in that century, which was favorable to them, are complete and genuine .
Towards the end of the 16th century and at the beginning of the 17th, when many famous men undertook diligently to study the Talmud, the Jews, fearing for themselves, began to expugn parts of the Talmud which were openly inimical to Christians . Thus the Talmud which was published at Basle in 1578 has been mutilated in many places .
And at a Synod in Poland, in the year 1631, the Rabbis of Germany and other countries declared that nothing which would annoy the Christians and cause persecution of Israel, should be printed . For this reason there are signs of many things missing in the Jewish books which were published in the following century and thereafter . The Rabbis explain from memory what these things mean, for they possess the genuine books which Christians rarely see .
However, Jewish books were published later with very few mutilations in Holland-where the Jews who were expelled from
upheld by the celebrated humanists, Erasmus of Rotterdam, Ulrich Hutten,
Aegidius of Viterbo, ana others . This controversy raged all over Europe .
After much deliberation the universities of Erfort, Moguntina, Louvain and
Paris, accused Reuchlin of being a Jewish propagandist ; the chief Inquisitor,
Dominus Hoogstraten, however, accused him of depraved heresy and sum
moned him before the law. Finally the case was brought to Rome and the
judges there, in 1516, favored the cause of Reuchlin . The case was closed by
Pope Leo X who ordered both sides to remain silent, and without giving
any definite decision on the matter . Thus, neither was Reuchlin declared to
be innocent, nor the Talmud condemned to the flames .
18 A sample edition, consisting of 12 volumes folio, may be seen in the
Imperial Hall of the Vienna Library, from which many copies have been
made .
19 The Jews are wont to point triumphantly to the fact that it was in the
same year that Martin Luther burned the Bull of Pope Leo X . cf . article
by Em. Deitsch in the Quarterly Review Oct . 1867, entitled "What is the
Talmud"?



23
Spain were kindly received . The Talmud published there in 16441648 is almost similar to the Venetian edition . 20
The latest device invented to deceive the censors was to insert the word haiah (was) with the genuine text, as if to indicate that the matter in question once had its place there . 21 But by so doing they only cleanse the outside of the cup . For in many places they do show what they mean, e x.gr . by the words gam attah, "even now," viz. "this law obliges" ; and aphilu bazzeman hazzeh, "even to this day" viz. "this law holds," and such like .22
We must add a few remarks about that other very well known book of the Jews, called the ZOHAR . According to some Rabbis, Moses, after he had been instructed in the interpretation of the law on Mount Sinai, did not pass this information to Joshua nor he to the Elders, but to Aaron, Aaron to Eleazer, and so on until the oral teachings had been put into book form called the ZOHAR, so called from the name ZEHAR, meaning to shine forth . For it is an illustration of the books of Moses, a commentary on the Pentateuch . The author is said to have been R . Schimeon ben Jochai, a disciple of R . Akibha who, fifty years after the destruction of the Temple, ended his life as a martyr about the year 120 A.D. in Hadrian's war against the Jews . Since, however, names of men appear in this book who lived many centuries after the year indicated, and since neither Rambam (R . Mosche ben Nachman), nor R. Ascher, who died about the year 1248 A.D., make no mention of it, it is more likely that those are nearer the truth who say that the book of Zohar first saw the light about the 13th century . Espe
20 Printed in small characters, in large quarto . It is to be noted that
almost all editions of the Talmud have the same number of folios and the
same disposition of the text . The large or small form depends upon the type .
21 Following is a sample of this : Schulchan Arukh, a part of the ancient
Venetian edition of 1594 says : "As to those who worship the stars and
planets, when there is no war between them and us . they are not to be
set free," etc . In the same place in an edition published at Vilna in 1873 we
read : "As to idolaters of the seven people, during the time when there WAS
no war between them and us . . . they are not to be set free," etc.
22 cf . Choschen ham . 338,10 ; Lore deah, 159, 1, etc.



24
cially is this considered likely since about this time a book was produced which is similar in argument and style to the Chaldaic type
of writing. It consists of three volumes in large octavo .

PART ONE
THE TEACHING OF THE TALMUD
CONCERNING CHRISTIANS
FIRST we shall see what the Talmud teaches about Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity ; and secondly, about his followers, the Christians .
27



28
CHAPTER I .
JESUS CHRIST IN THE TALMUD
Many passages in the Talmudic books treat of the birth, life, death and teachings of Jesus Christ . He is not always referred to by the same name, however, but is diversely called "That Man," "A Certain One," "The Carpenter's Son," "The One Who Was Hanged," etc .
Article I . - CONCERNING THE NAMES OF JESUS CHRIST
1 . The real name of Christ in Hebrew is Jeschua Hanotsri-Jesus the Nazarene . He is called Notsri from the city of Nazareth in which he was brought up. Thus in the Talmud Christians also are called Notsrint-Nazarenes . Since the word Jeschua means "Savior," the name Jesus rarely occurs in Jewish books . 1 It is almost always abbreviated to Jeschu, which is maliciously taken as if it were composed of the initial letters of the three words Immach SCHemo Vezikro-"May his name and memory be blotted out ." 2
'ex . gr. in Maiene ieschua, fol . 66b
2 cf. I . Buxtorf in Abbrev . Jeschu : "The Jews among themselves do not
say Jeschu, but Isschu, so nearly corresponding to the words of this curse .
When talking to a certain Jew about this some years ago he told me that it
not only meant this, but also Jeschu Scheker (liar) Utoebah (and abomina
tion) . Who would not be deeply horrified at this? This Jew lived at Frank
fort and at Hanover and had travelled all over the world . When lie saw
how this horrified me, his faith in Judaism began to weaken, for he was
not adverse to the Christian faith and had often discussed it with me and
Dr . Amando Polano . I also discovered here and there two other secret
words from the Jewish Cabala which have to do with this name . It is well
known that the Israelites are often warned in their sacred writings to shun
the worship of Elohe Nekhar-strange gods or god. What does Elohe
Nekhar really mean? By the numbering method of the Gammatria these
letters equal 316, which taken together make the word Jeschu. This is found



29
2 . In the Talmud Christ is called Otho Isch-`That Man,' i .e . the one who is known to all . In the Tract Abhodah Zarah, 6a, we read : "He is called a Christian who follows the false teachings of that man, who taught them to celebrate the feast on the first day of the Sabbath, that is, to worship on the first day after the Sabbath ."
3 . Elsewhere he is simply called Peloni-"A Certain One ." In Chagigah, 4b, we read "Mary . . . the mother of a certain one, of whom it is related in Schabbath . . ." ( 104b) . That this Mary is none other than the mother of Jesus will be shown later .
4 . Out of contempt, Jesus is also called Naggar bar naggar-'the carpenter son of a carpenter' ;s also Ben charsch etaim-'the son of a wood worker .'
5 . He is also called Talui - `the one who was hanged .' Rabbi Samuel, the son of Meir, in the Hilch . Akum of Maimonides, refers to the fact that it was forbidden to take part in the Christian feats of Christmas and Easter because they were celebrated on account of him who was hanged. And Rabbi Aben Ezra, in a commentary on Genes. ( XXVII, 39) also calls him Talui, whose image the Emperor Constantine reproduced on his banner . " . . . in the days of Constantine, who made a change of religion and placed the figure of the one who was hanged on his banner ."
at the end of the book Abhkath Rokhel . They therefore teach that to dis
honor God by the worship of Elohe Nekhar is the same as to dishonor him
by the worship of Jeschu . Behold the malice of the serpent! Antonius also
found a marginal note in a book about the Jewish faith and religion. In a
Jewish prayer book there is a certain prayer beginning with Alenu . . . For
merly the wording contained certain things which were afterwards deleted
for fear of the Christians, but the space remains vacant to warn children
and adults that something is omitted there . The deleted words were ham
inischtachavim lehebhel varik umitpa'llelim lelo' ioschia "Those who bow
down exhibit vanity and foolishness and adore him who cannot save." This
is generally said about idols, but is secretly meant for Jesus whose name
is here signified by the letters . . . ." s cf. Abhodah Zarah, 50b.



30
Article II . - THE LIFE OF CHRIST
T
HE Talmud teaches that Jesus Christ was illegitimate_ and was conceived during menstruation ; that he had the soul of Esau ; that he was a fool, a conjurer, a seducer ; that he was crucified, buried in hell and set up as an idol ever since by his followers .
1 . ILLEGITIMATE AND CONCEIVED DURING MENSTRUATION
The following is narrated in the Tract Kallah, lb (18b) "Once when the Elders were seated at the Gate, two young men passed by, one of whom had his head covered, the other with his head bare . Rabbi Eliezer remarked that the one in his bare head was illegitimate, a
mamzer. Rabbi Jehoschua said that he was conceived
during menstruation, ben niddah . Rabbi Akibah, however, said that he was both . Whereupon the others asked Rabbi Akibah why he dared to contradict his colleagues . He answered that he could prove what he said . He went therefore to the boy's mother whom he saw sitting in the market place selling vegetables and said to her : `My daughter, if you will answer truthfully what I am going to ask you, I promise that you will be saved in the next life .' She demanded that he would swear to keep his promise, and Rabbi Akibah did so -but with his lips only, for in his heart he invalidated his oath . Then he said : `Tell me, what kind of son is this of yours'? To which she replied : `The day I was married I was having menstruation, and because of this my husband left me . But an evil spirit came and slept with me and from this intercourse my son was born to me .' Thus it was proved that this young man was not only illegitimate but also conceived during the menstruation of his mother . And when his questioners heard this they declared : `Great indeed was Rabbi Akibah when he corrected his Elders' ! And they exclaimed : `Blessed be the Lord God of Israel who revealed his secret to Rabbi Akibah the son of Joseph' "! That the Jews understand this story to refer to Jesus and his
mother, Mary, is clearly demonstrated in their book Toldath Jeschu -'The Generations of Jesus'- where the birth of our Savior is narrated in almost the same words . 4
4 cf . Synag . Jud. Chap . VIII, p .133 .



31
Another story of this kind is narrated in Sanhedrin, 67a "Of all who are guilty of death by the Law, he alone'
is caught by a ruse . How is it done? They light a candle
in an inner room and place witnesses in an adjoining
room outside where they can see him and hear his voice,
but where they cannot be seen by him . Then the one
whom he tried to seduce says to him `Please repeat here
privately what you told me before.' If the seducer re
peats what he said, the other asks him `But how shall we
leave our God who is in heaven and serve idols?' If the
seducer repents, then all is well . But if he says `This is
our duty and it is right for us to do so,' then the wit
nesses outside, who have heard him, bring him before the judge and stone him to death . This is what they did to
the son of Stada in Lud, and they hanged him on the eve
of the Passover. For this son of Stada was the son of
Pandira . For Rabbi Chasda tells us that Pandira was the husband' of Stada, his mother, and he lived during
the time of Paphus the son of Jehuda . But his mother
was stada, Mary of Magdala (a ladies' hairdresser) who, as it is said in Pumbadita, deserted her husband ."
The meaning of this is that this Mary was called Stada, that is,
a prostitute, because, according to what was taught at Pumbadita,
she left her husband and committed adultery . This is also recorded
in the Jerusalem Talmud 7 and by Maimonides . 7
That the mention here is of Mary, the mother of Jesus, is veri
fied in the Tract Chagigah, 4b
"When Rabbi Bibhai was visited once by the Death
Angel (the devil), the latter said to his assistant : `Go
and bring to me Mary the hairdresser' (that is, kill her) .
He went and brought Mary the children's hairdresser
in place of the other Mary ." A marginal note explains this passage as follows :
"This story of Mary the Ladies' hairdresser happened
under the Second Temple . She was the mother of
Peloni, `that man,' as he is called in the tract Schab
bath," (fol . 104b) .
5 namely, a seducer, who tries to seduce another to worship an idol and
to join a false religion . 6 A marginal note says this son of Stada was called after his father, not
his mother, although he was illegitimate .
7 cf. Sanhedrin, chap . VII near the end, and Iebhammoth, the last chap.



32
In Schabbath the passage referred to says
"Rabbi Eliezer said to the Elders : `Did not the son of
Stada practice Egyptian magic by cutting it into his
flesh?' They replied : `He was a fool, and we do not pay
attention to what fools do . The son of Stada, Pandira s
son, e.t"c' as above in Sanhedrin, 67a .
This magic of the son of Stada is explained as follows in the
book Beth Jacobh, fol . 127a :
"The Magi, before they left Egypt, took special care not
to put their magic in writing lest other peoples might
come to learn it . But he devised a new way by which he
inscribed it on his skin, or made cuts in his skin and inserted it there and which, when the wounds healed up,
did not show what they meant ." 8
Buxtorf 9 says
"There is little doubt who this Ben Stada was, or who
the Jews understood him to be . Although the Rabbis in
their additions to the Talmud try to hide their malice
and say that it is not Jesus Christ, their deceit is plainly
evident, and many things prove that they wrote and un
derstood all these things about him . In the first place,
they also call him the son of Pandira . Jesus the Nazar
ene is thus called in other passages" of the Talmud
where express mention is made of Jesus the son o f
Pandira. St . John Damascene"' also, in his Genealogy
of Christ, mentions Panthera and the Son of Panthera .
"Secondly, this Stada is said to be Mary, and this
Mary the mother of Peloni `that certain one,' by which
without doubt Jesus is meant . For in this way they
were accustomed to cover up his name because they
were afraid to mention it . If we had copies of the origi
nal manuscripts they would certainly prove this . And
this also was the name of the mother of Jesus the
Nazarene .
8 This is treated at greater length in the book Toldath Jeschu, where it
speaks of Jesus as a conjurer, as we shall see further on . It is also men
tioned in the Jerusalem Talmud in chap . 12. 9 cf . Lexicon. Jud. in verbo Jeschu. 10 cf. The Jerusalem Talmud, Abhodah Zarah, ch .II, and Schabbath, ch .
XIV, Beth Jacobh, 127a . 11 Lib . 4



"Thirdly, he is called the Seducer of the People . The
Gospels 12 testify that Jesus was called this by the Jews,
and their writings to this day are proof that they still call him by this name . 13 "Fourthly, he is called `the one who was hanged,'
which clearly refers to the crucifixion of Christ, espe
cially since a reference to the time `on the eve of the
Passover' is added, which coincides with the time of the
crucifixion of Jesus . In Sanhedrin (43a) they wrote as
follows 'On the eve of the Passover they hanged Jesus'
"Fifthly, as to what the Jerusalem Talmud says about
the two disciples of the Elders who were sent as wit
nesses to spy on him, and who were afterwards brought
forward as witnesses against him : This refers to the
two `false witnesses' of whom the Evangelists Matthew 14
and Luke 15 make mention .
"Sixthly, concerning what they say about the son of
Stada that he practiced Egyptian magical arts by cutting
into his flesh : the same accusation is made against Christ
in their hostile book Toldoth Jeschu .
"Lastly, the time corresponds . For it is said that this
son of Stada lived in the days of Paphus the son of
Jehuda, who was a contemporary of Rabbi Akibah . Akibah, however, lived at the time of the Ascension of
Christ, and for some time after. Mary is also said to
have lived under the Second Temple . All this clearly
proves that they secretly and blasphemously understand
this son of Stada to be Jesus Christ the son of Mary .
"Other circumstances may seem to contradict this . But
that is nothing new in Jewish writings and is done on
purpose so that Christians may not easily detect their
trickery ." 16
12 cf. Matt. XXVII, 63 13 cf . Sanhedrin, 107b 14 Ch. XXVI, 60-61 15 Ch . XX, 5
16 There are Jews who themselves confess to this . For instance, in the
book Sepher Juchasin (9b) : "The Rabbis have always deceived the Nazarenes
by saying that the Jesus of whom the Talmud speaks is not the Jesus Christ
of the Christians . They permit themselves this falsehood for the sake of
peace" in Rohling, Die Polemik and das Menschenopfer des Rabbinismus,
ut supra .
33



34
2 . Furthermore, "In the secret books, which are not permitted to
fall easily into the hands of Christians, they say that the soul of
Esau came into Christ, that he was therefore evil and that lie was Esau himself ." 11
3 . By some he is called A FOOLL and INSANE In Schabbath, 104b :
"They, [the Elders] said to him [Eliezer] : `He was a
fool, and no one pays attention to fools .' "
4. A CONJURER AND A MAGICIAN In the infamous book Toldoth Jeschu, our Savior is blasphemed
as follows : "And Jesus said : Did not Isaiah and David, my ances
tors, prophesy about me? The Lord said to we, thou art
my son, today I have begotten thee, 18 etc . Likewise in
another place : The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou at my
right hand . 19 Now I ascend to my Father who is in
heaven and will sit at his right hand, which you will see
with your own eyes . But you, Judas, will never reach
that high . 20 Then Jesus pronounced the great name of
God (IHVH) and continued to do so until a wind came
and took him up between earth and sky . Judas also pro
nounced the name of God and he likewise was taken up
by the wind . In this way they both floated around in the
air to the amazement of the onlookers . Then Judas, again
pronouncing the Divine Name, took hold of Jesus and pushed him down to earth . But Jesus tried to do the
same to Judas and thus they fought together . And when
Judas saw he could not win out over the works of Jesus
he pissed on Jesus, and both thus being unclean they
fell to earth ; nor could they use the Divine name again
until they had washed themselves."
Whether those who believe such devilish lies deserve greater
hatred or pity, I cannot say . 21
17 S1'nag . Judaica, p . 217 ; cf . also Buxtorf, Lexicon in verbo Jeschu . la Ps. II, 7 . 19 Ps. CX, 1 . 20 For it is related that Judas was a competitor of Jesus in the working of miracles . 21 Wagenseil, Sota, p . 1049 .



35
In another place in the same book it is related that in the house
of the Sanctuary there was a stone which the Patriarch Jacob
anointed with oil . 22 On this stone were carved the tetragrammatic
letters of the Name (IHVH) ' 23 and if anyone could learn them he
could destroy the world . They therefore decreed that no one must
learn them, and they placed two dogs upon two iron columns before
the Sanctuary so that if anyone should learn them the dogs would
bark at him coming out and he would forget the letters through
fear. Then it is related : "Jesus came and entered, learned the let
ters and wrote them down on parchment . Then he cut into the flesh
of his thigh and inserted them there, and having pronounced the name, the wound healed ." 24
5 . IDOLATER
In the Tract Sanhedrin (103a) the words of Psalm XCI, 10 : 'No plague shall come near thy dwelling,' are explained as follows'
"That thou mayest never have a son or a disciple who
will salt his food so much that he destroys his taste in public, like Jesus the Nazarene ."
To salt one's food too much or to destroy one's taste, is pro
verbially said of one who corrupts his morals or dishonors himself,
or who falls into heresy and idolatry and openly preaches it to
others .
6. SEDUCER
In the same book Sanhedrin (107b) we read
"Mar said : Jesus seduced, corrupted and destroyed
Israel"
7. CRUCIFIED
Finally as punishment for his crimes and impiety, he suffered an
ignominious death by being hanged on a cross on the eve of the
Passover (as we have seen above) .
22 cf . Genesis, XXVIII .
23 No one knows how this august name of God is to be read . It is cer
tain, however, that it was not pronounced Jehovah, although it is thus com
monly pronounced . For the vowels of this tetragrammatum are the vowels
of the name Adonai, and it is thus that the Jews read IHVH . Out of rever
ence, however, it is never written in their books, with the exception of
Sacred Scripture, but only indicated by ", or Haschens, the Name . 24 Buxtorf . Lexicon .



36
8 . BURIED IN HELL
The book Zohar, III, (282), tells us that Jesus died like a beast
and was buried in that "dirt heap . . . where they throw the dead
bodies of dogs and asses, and where the sons of Esau [the Chris
tians] and of Ismael [the Turks], also Jesus and Mahommad, un
circumcized and unclean like dead dogs, are buried ." 25
9 . WORSHIPPED AS GOD AFTER His DEATH BY His FOLLOWERS
George El . Edzard, in his book Avoda Sara, quotes the following words of the commentator on the Hilkoth Akum (V,3) of Maimonides
"In many passages of the Talmud mention is made of
Jesus the Nazarene and of his disciples, and that the
Gentiles believe that there is no other God besides him.
In the book Chizzuk Emunah'26 part I, ch . 36, we read
`The Christians build up an argument from this [Zach
ary XII, 10] and say : Behold how the Prophet testified
that in future ages the Jews would lament and weep because they crucified and killed the Messiah who was
sent to them ; and to prove that he meant Jesus the Naz
arene, possessing both the divine and human nature, they
quote the words : And they looked upon him whom they
transfixed and they wept over him as a mother over her
first born child.' " Maimonides attempts to prove how much Christians err in worshipping Jesus in his book Hilkoth Melakhim (IX,4) : 27
"If all the things he did had prospered, if he had rebuilt
the Sanctuary in its place, and had gathered together the
dispersed tribes of Israel, then he would certainly be the
25 In the book Synag . Judaica, (Ch. III, p .75) is the following : 'He who
cuts himself off [namely, who does not believe blindly in the Rabbinical
teachings] will suffer the tortures of the damned, as is decreed in the Tal
mudic law of punishment in the Tract de Repudiis (Gitt. c.5.) : He who
despises the words of the wise men shall be cast into the dirt heap with the
damned ." I shudder to repeat that they blasphemously narrate that our
Savior Jesus Christ, whose name be forever blessed, suffered this penalty
by being cast into Gehenna, although it is contrary to the traditions and
teaching of the Fathers of the Church . . . 26 cf . Wagens, Sofa, p .69 . 27 Ibidem, p .346.



Messiah . . . . But if so far he has not done so and if he was killed, then it is clear he was not the Messiah whom the Law tells us to expect. He was similar to all the good and upright rulers of the House of David who died, and whom the Holy and Blessed Lord raised up for no other reason but to prove to many, as it is said (in Dan. X1,35) : And some of them who understand shall
fall, to try and to purge them and to make them white,
even till the end of time, because the appointed time is
not yet. Daniel also prophesied about Jesus the Nazarene who thought he was the Christ, and who was put to death by the judgment of the Senate : (Dan .V .14) . . . and the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves
to establish the vision ; but they shall fail. What could be plainer? For all the Prophets said that the Christ would set Israel free, would bring it salvation, restore its dispersed peoples and confirm their laws . But he was the cause of the destruction of Israel and caused the rest of them to be dispersed and humiliated, so that the Law was changed and the greater part of the world was seduced to worship another God . Truly no one can understand the designs of the Creator, nor are his ways our ways . For all that has been built up by Jesus the Nazarene, and by the Turks who came after him, tend only to prepare the way for the coming of Christ the King, and to prepare the whole world equally for the service of the Lord, as it is said : For then I shall give a clean mouth
to all peoples that all may call upon the name of the
Lord, and bow down in unison before him . 28 How is this being accomplished? Already the whole world is filled with the praise of Christ, the Law and the Commandments, and his praises have spread to far distant lands and to peoples whose hearts and bodies are uncircumcized. These discuss with one another about the Law that was destroyed-some saying that the commandments were once true, but have ceased to exist ; others that there is a great mystery about it, that the Messiah-King has come and that their doctrine has revealed it . But when the Christ truly comes and is successful, and is raised up and exalted, then everything will be changed and these things will be shown to be false and vain ."
28 Sophon, 111,9.

10 . AN IDOL
In the Tract Abhodah Zarah, (21a Toseph), we read :
"It is of importance to inquire the reasons why men
nowadays even sell and rent their houses to Gentiles . Some say this is legal because it is said in Tosephta : No
one shall rent his house to a gentile either here [in the
land of Israel] or elsewhere because it is known that he
will bring an idol into it . It is nevertheless allowed to
rent them stables, barns and lodging houses, even though
it is known that they will bring idols into them . The reason is because a distinction can be made between a
place into which an idol will be carried in order to leave
it there permanently, and a place where it will not be
left permanently, in which case it is allowed . And since the gentiles, among whom we now live, do not bring their
idol into their homes to leave it there permanently, but
only for a time-while someone is dead in the house or
when someone is dying, nor do they even perform any religious rites there-it is therefore permitted to sell and
rent them houses ."
Rabbi Ascher, in his Commentary on Abhodah Zarah
(83d) speaks not less clearly on this matter : "Today it is permitted to rent houses to Gentiles because
they bring their idol into them only for a time, when
somebody is sick ." And in the same place he says 'Today
they have a practice of incensing their idol ."'
All this, and much more like it, proves beyond a doubt that when the Rabbis speak of the idols of the Gentiles among whom they lived at that time, when no idols were worshipped, they clearly meant the Christian "idol," namely, the image of Christ on the crucifix and the Holy Communion .
NOTE ABOUT THE CROSS
In Jewish writings there is no directly corresponding word for
the Christian Cross . The cross T on which those condemned to
death were crucified, was called Tau by the Phoenicians and the
Hebrews, and this name and sign for it was afterwards taken over
into the alphabet of the Jews and of the Greeks and Romans . The
Cross honored by the Christians, however, is called by the following names



39
1 . Tsurath Haattalui-the image of him who was hanged ."
2 . Elil-vanity, idol.
3 . Tselem-image . Hence the Crusaders in Jewish books are called Tsalmerim (ein Tsalmer)
4. Scheti Veerebh-warp and woof, which is taken from the textile art .
Kokhabh-star ; on account of the four rays emanating
from it .
6. Pesila-a sculpture, a carven idol .
But wherever it is mentioned it is always in the sense of an idol or of something despicable, as can be seen from the following quotations
In Orach Chaiim, 113,8 : "If a Jew when praying should meet a Christian [Akum] carrying a star [a crucifix] in his hand, even if he has come to a place in his prayer where it is necessary to bow down to worship God in his heart, he must not do so lest he should seem to bow down before an image ." In lore Dea, 150,2 :
"Even if a Jew should get a splinter in his foot in front of an idol, or if he should drop his money before it, he must not stoop down to remove the splinter or to gather up his money lest he should seem to adore it . But he should either sit down or turn his back or his side to the idol and then remove the splinter ." But whenever it is not possible for a Jew to turn away like this, the following rule must be observed (in Lore Dea, 3, Hagah )
"It is not permitted to bow down or to remove one's hat before princes or priests who wear a cross on their dress, as is their custom . Care must be taken, however, not to be noticed in failing to do so . For instance, one can throw some coins on the ground and stoop down to pick
them up before they pass by . In this way it is permitted to bow down or to remove one's hat before them ." A distinction is also made between a cross which is venerated
29 Aben Ezra in Genes. XXVII, 39.



40
and a cross which is worn around the neck as a souvenir or as an
ornament . The former is to be regarded as an idol, but not neces
sarily the latter. In Lore Dea, 141, 1, Hagah, it says
"The image of a cross, before which they bow down, is
to be treated as an idol, and it is not to be used until it
is destroyed. However, a `warp and woof' if hung
around the neck as a souvenir is not to be regarded as
an idol and can be used.'
The sign of the cross made with the hand, by which Christians
are wont to bless themselves, is called in Jewish "the moving of
the fingers here and here" (hinc et hinc) . 30
Article III . - The Teachings of Christ
T
HE Seducer and Idolater could teach nothing but falsehood and heresy which was irrational and impossible to observe .
1 . FALSEHOOD In Abhodah Zarah (6a) it says :
"A Nazarene is one who follows the false teachings of
that man who taught them to worship on the first day of
the Sabbath ."
2 . HERESY
In the same book Abhodah Zar. (Ch . I, 17a Toseph) mention is
made of the heresy of James. A little further on (27b) we learn
that this James was none other than the disciple of Jesus
" . . James Sekhanites, one of the disciples of Jesus, of
whom we spoke in chapter 1 ." But James taught, not his own doctrine, but that of Jesus .
3 . IMPOSSIBLE TO OBSERVE The author of Nizzachon 31 argues as follows on this point
"A written law of the Christians is : If a Jew strike you
on one cheek, turn the other also to him and do not in
any way return the blow . 32 And ch . VI, v . 27 says : Love
your enemies ; do good to them who hate you ; bless them
who curse you and pray for those who do you harm ;
so cf . Kad . Hakkenz, 20a. 81 cf . Wagens. Sota, p . 822 82 A corruption of the text in Luke ch . VI, 29.



41
unto him who strikes you on one cheek offer him the
other. To him who takes away thy cloak do not forbid
him to take thy coat also, etc. The same is found in Mat
thew ch . V, v .39 . But I have never seen any Christian
keep this law, nor did Jesus himself behave as he taught
others to do . For we find in John ch . XVIII, v . 22, that
when someone struck him on the face, he did not turn
the other cheek, but became angry on account of this one
stroke and asked `Why do you strike me'? Likewise in
the Acts of the Apostles, ch . XXIII, v. 3, we read : that
when the High Priest ordered them that stood by to strike him on the mouth, Paul did not turn the other
cheek ; he cursed him saying `God shall smite thee thou
whited wall, etc .' This is contrary to their beliefs and
destroys the foundation upon which their religion rests, for they boast that the law of Jesus is easy to observe .
If Paul himself, who may be called the Dispenser of
Jesus, could not observe the precept of Jesus, who among
the others who believe in him can prove to me that he
can do so?" The author, however, who had the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles under his hand, could not have failed to understand in
what sense Christ commanded his followers to turn the other cheek
to him who would strike them, since in another place he com
manded his followers to cut off a hand or an arm, and to pluck out
an eye if these should scandalize them . No one who has had the
least acquaintance with Holy Scripture ever thought that these com
mands should be taken literally . Only deep malice and ignorance
of the times in which Jesus lived can explain why the Jews, even
to this day, use these passages to detract from the teachings of
Jesus Christ . 33

CHAPTER II
THE CHRISTIANS
T
HERE are three things to be considered in this chapter
1 . The names by which Christians are called in the Talmud . 2. What kind of people the Talmud pictures Christians to be . 3. What the Talmud says about the religious worship of the Christians .
A
Article I . - The Names Given to Christians in the Talmud
S in our languages Christians take their name from Christ, so in
the language of the Talmud Christians are called Noisrim, from
J esus the Nazarene. But Christians are also called by the names
used in the Talmud to designate all non-Jews : Abhodah Zarah, Akum, Obhde Elilim, Minim, Nokhrim, Edom, Amme Haarets, Goim, Apikorosim, Kuthrim .
1 . Abhodah Zarah-Strange worship, idolatry . The Talmudic
Tract on Idolatry is thus entitled : Obhde Abhodah Zarah-Idol
Worshippers . That Abhodah Zarah really means the cult of idols
is clear from the Talmud itself : `Let Nimrod come and testify that
Abraham was not a server of Abhodah Zarah .' But in the days of
Abraham there existed no strange cult either of the Turks or the
Nazarenes, but only the worship of the true God and idolatry . In
Schabbath (ibid . 82a), it says :
"Rabbi Akibah says : How do we know that Abhodah
Zarah, like an unclean woman, contaminates those who
subscribe to it? Because Isaiah says : Thou shalt cast
them away like a menstruation cloth ; and shalt say unto it, Get thee hence ."
In the first part of this verse mention is made of idols made from
gold and silver . The learned Maimonides also clearly demonstrates that the Jews
regarded Christians as Abhodah Zarah . In Perusch (78c) he says : "And be it known that Christian people who follow Jesus, although their teachings vary, are all worshippers of idols (Abhodah Zarah) ."



2 . Akum-This word is made up of the initial letters of the words
Obhde Kokhabkim U Mazzaloth-worshippers of stars and planets .
It was thus that the Jews formerly styled the Gentiles who lacked
all knowledge of the true God . Now, however, the word Akum in
Jewish books, especially in the Schulkhan Arukh, is applied to Christians . This is evident from numerous passages
In the Orach Chaiim (113,8) those who use a cross are called
Akum . In the Lore Dea (148, 5, 12), those who celebrate the feasts of Christmas and New Year, eight days afterwards, are called worshippers of the stars and planets :
"Thus if a gift is sent to the Akum, even in these times, on the eighth day after Christmas, which they call the New Year," etc.
3 . Obhde Elilim - Servers of idols . This name has the same
meaning as Akum . Non-Jews are frequently called by this name .
In the Orach Chaiim, for example (215,5), it says :
"A blessing should not be pronounced over incense which belongs to the servers of idols ." But at the time when the Schulkhan Arukh was written there were
no worshippers of the stars and planets (Akum) ; there were no 'servers of idols' among those who lived with the Jews . Thus, for example, the author of the Commentary on the Schulkhan Arukh (entitled Magen Abraham), Rabbi Calissensis who died in Poland in 1775, in note 8, on No . 244 of the Orach Chaiim (where it is allowed to finish a work on the Sabbath with the help of an Akum)
says : "Here in our city the question is raised about the price of
hiring worshippers of the stars and planets who sweep the public streets when they work on the Sabbath ." 34
4 . Minim-Heretics . In the Talmud those who possess books called the Gospels are heretics . Thus in Schabbath (116a) it says "Rabbi Meir calls the books of the Minim Aven Gilaion [iniquitous volumes] because they call them Gospels ."
5 . Edom-Edomites . Rabbi Aben Ezra, when he speaks about
the Emperor Constantine who changed his religion and placed the
image of him who was hanged on his banner, adds :
"Rome therefore is called the Kingdom of the Edomites ."
And Rabbi Bechai, in his Kad Hakkemach ( f ol . 20a, on Isaiah, ch. LXVI, 17) writes
S4 cf. Ecker, Judensp. p. 17.
43



44
"They are called Edomites who move their fingers 'here
and here"' (who make the sign of the cross) .
Likewise Rabbi Bechai, commenting on the words of Isaiah (loc.
cit.), "those who eat the flesh of swine" adds : "These are the
Edomites ." Rabbi Kimchi, however, calls them "Christians ." And
Rabbi Abarbinel, in his work Maschima Ieschua (36d) says : "The
Nazarenes acre Romans, the sons of Edom."
6. Goi-Race, or people . The Jews also call a man a Goi-a gen
tile ; they call a gentile woman a Goiah. Sometimes, but very rarely,
Israelites are called by this name ." It is mostly applied to non
Jews, or idolaters. In Jewish books which treat of Idolatry, 36 wor
shippers of idols are often called by this single word Goi. For this
reason, in more recent editions of the Talmud 37 the use of the
word Goi is purposely avoided and other words for non-Jews are
substituted.
It is well known that in the Jewish language, the Jews call
Christians among whom they live, Goim . Nor do the Jews deny
this . Sometimes in their popular magazines they say that this word
means nothing harmful or evil ."' But the contrary can be seen in
their books written in the Hebrew language . For instance, in Cho
schen Hammischpat ( 34,22), the name Goi is used in a depraved
sense :
"Traitors and Epicureans and Apostates are worse than
Goim"
7. Nokhrim-strangers, foreigners . This name is used for all
who are not Jews, and therefore for Christians .
8. Amme Haarets-People of the earth, idiots . There are some
who say"' that people of other races are not meant by this, but
only crude and uneducated people . There are passages, however,
which leave no doubt about the matter . In the Holy Scripture,
Book of Esra, ch . X, 2, we read : We have sinned against our God,
and have taken strange wives [nokhrioth] of the people of the
earth That people of the earth denotes idolaters is clear from
Zohar, I, 25a : "The People of the earth-Obhde Abhodah Zarah,
idolaters ."' 0
35 ex.gr. Genes. XII,2 ; Exod. XIX, 6 ; Isaiah, 1,4.
86 cf . Abhodah Zarah, and Hilkoth Akum of Maimonides .
87 cf. The Warsaw edition of 1863 .
88 cf. Israelita, No. 48, 1891 .
89 cf. Franz Delitzsch, Schachmatt den Blutluhnern, 1883, p. 41 .
'0 Buxtorf is therefore correct (Lexicon, col. 1626) by translating Amme
haarets as 'gentiles,' which displeases Prof . Delitzsch .



45
9. Basar Vedam-Flesh and blood ; carnal men who are destined
to perdition and who can have no communion with God . That
Christians are flesh and blood, is proved from the prayer book : "Whoever meets a wise and educated Christian can say :
Blessed art thou 0 Lord, King of the Universe, who dis
penseth of thy wisdom to Flesh and Blood," etc.
Likewise in another prayer, in which they ask God soon to restore
the kingdom of David and to send Elias and the Messiah, etc ., they
ask him to take away their poverty so that they will have no need
to accept gifts from "flesh and blood," nor to trade with them, nor to seek wages from them .41
10 . Apikorosim-Epicureans . All are called by this name who do
not observe God's precepts, as well as all those, even Jews them
selves, who express private judgments in matters of faith .42 How
much more, therefore, Christians!
11 . Kuthim-Samaritans . But since there are no longer any Samar
itans, and since there are many references in recent Jewish books
to Samaritans, who can doubt that this does not mean the Chris
tians ?
Furthermore, in this matter of naming those who are not Jews,
it is to be particularly noted that Jewish writings apply these names indiscriminately and promiscuously when they speak of the same
thing, and almost in the same words . For instance, in the Tract
Abhodah Zarah (25b) the word Goi is employed, but in the Schul
khan Arukh (lore Dea 153,2) Akum is used. Kerithuth (6b) uses
Goim ; Jebhammoth (61a) uses Akum ; Abhodah Zar. (2a) uses
Obhde Elilim ; Thoseph uses Goim and Obhde Ab ., Choschen Ham
(Venetian ed .) uses Kuthi ; (Slav, ed .) Akum . And many more
instances could be quoted. Maimonides in his book on Idolatry indiscriminately calls all the
following idolaters : Goim, Akum, Obhde Kokhabhim, Obhde Eli
lim, etc .
41 cf. Synag . Jud. C. XII, p. 257 and 263 .
42 The Jews of Warsaw showed an example of this when, in 1892, they
denounced the editor of the newspaper Hatseflrah because he dared to say
that everything in the Talmud was not of the same religious value nor of
the same authority .



46
Article II . - What the Talmud Teaches About Christians
0 N the preceding chapter we saw what the Jews think of the
Founder of the Christian religion, and how much they despise
his name . This being so, it would not be expected that they would
have any better opinion about those who follow Jesus the Nazarene .
In fact, nothing more abominable can be imagined than what they
have to say about Christians . They say that they are idolaters, the
worst kind of people, much worse than the Turks, murderers, forni
cators, impure animals, like dirt, unworthy to be called men, beasts
in human form, worthy of the name of beasts, cows, asses, pigs,
dogs, worse than dogs ; that they propagate after the manner of
beasts, that they have a diabolic origin, that their souls come from
the devil and return to the devil in hell after death ; and that even
the body of a dead Christian is nothing different from that of an
animal.
1 . IDOLATERS Since Christians follow the teachings of that man, whom the Jews regard as a Seducer and an Idolater, and since they worship
him as God, it clearly follows that they merit the name of idolaters,
in no way different from those among whom the Jews lived before
the birth of Christ, and whom they taught should be exterminated
by every possible means .
This is best demonstrated by the names they give to Christians,
and by the unmistakable words of Maimonides which prove that all
who bear the name of Christian are idolaters 42 a And anyone who
examines Jewish books which speak of the "Worshippers of the
Stars and Planets," "Epicureans," "Samaritans," etc ., cannot but
conclude that these idolaters are none other than Christians . The
Turks are always called "Ismaelites," never idolaters .
2 . CHRISTIANS WORSE THAN THE TURKS
Maimonides in Hilkhoth Maakhaloth (ch . IX) says :
"It is not permitted to drink the wine of a stranger who
becomes a convert, 93 that is, one who accepts the seven
42 a Vide Infra, ch .TT, p .42
43 There are two kinds of Jewish converts ; some are called Gere
Tsedekh, converts to justice, who embrace the Jewish religion and accept
the whole law of Moses, not for external reasons only, but for the glory of
God and for the sake of true religion ; others are called Gere Toschabh,
convert strangers, who are neither circumcized nor baptized, and who observe
only certain laws, namely those given to the sons of Noah, which are : (1)



precepts of Noah, but it is permitted to gain some benefit
from it . It is allowed to leave wine alone with him, but
not to place it before him . The same is permitted in the
case of all gentiles who are not idolaters, such as the
Turks [Ismaelites] . A Jew, however, is not permitted
to drink their wine, although -he may use it to his own
advantage . All the best known Rabbis agree on this . But
since Christians are idolaters, it is not allowed even to
use their wine to advantage ."
3 . MURDERERS In Abhodah Zarah (22a) it says :
A Jew must not associate himself with gentiles because
they are given to the shedding of blood ."
Likewise in Lore Dea (153,2) "An Israelite must not associate himself with the Akum [Christians] because they are given to the shedding of
blood ." In the Abhodah Zarah (25b) it says :
"The Rabbis taught : If a Goi joins an Israelite on the
road, he [the Jew ] should walk on his right side . 44 Rabbi
Ismael, the son of Rabbi Jochanan the nephew of
Beruka, says : if he carries a sword, let the Jew walk on
his right side. 45 If the Goi carries a stick, the Jew should
walk on his left side . 46 If he is climbing a hill or de
scending a steep incline, the Jew must not go in front
with the Goi behind, but the Jew must go behind and the
Goi in front, nor must he stoop down in front of him
for fear the Goi might crack his skull . And if he should
ask the Jew how far he is going, he should pretend he is
going a long way, as Jacob our Father said to the im
pious Esau : Until I come to my Lord in Seir (Gen .
XXXIII, 14-17), but it adds : Jacob set out for Sukoth ."
Justice ; (2) Praise of God ; (3) Shunning idolatry ; (4) about fornication ;
(5) the shedding of blood ; (6) Rape ; (7) not touching an animal's organ .
Vide, Sanhed, 56a.
44 So that if the Gentile should raise his hand to strike him, the Jew can
more quickly ward off the blow with his right hand.
45 So that the Jew's right hand be nearer to the Gentile's sword, and if
he tries to draw it, the Jew can obstruct his right hand .
46 So that the Jew he nearer the Gentile's right hand which holds the
stick, and so may be able to grasp it quickly with his left hand .
47



48
In Orach Chaiim (20,2) it says : "Do not sell your overcoat (Talith) with the fringes to
an Akum, lest he should join up with a Jew on the road
and kill him . It is also forbidden to exchange or lend
your overcoat with a Gentile, except for a short time
and when there is nothing to be feared from him ."
4 . FORNICATORS In the Abhodah Zarah (15b) it says
"Animals of the masculine sex must not be left in the
barns of the Gentiles with their men, nor animals of the
feminine sex with their women ; much less must animals
of the feminine sex be left with their men, and of the
masculine sex with their women . Nor must sheep be left
to the care of their shepherds ; nor must any intercourse
be had with them ; nor must children be given into their
care to learn to read or to learn a trade ."
In the same tract a little farther on (22a) it is explained why
animals must not be allowed in the barns of Gentiles, and why Jews
are not permitted to have sexual intercourse with them
"Animals must not be allowed to go near the Goim,
because they are suspected of having intercourse with
them . Nor must women cohabit with them because they
are over-sexed ."
In fol . 22b of the same book the reason is given why animals espe
cially of the feminine sex must be kept away from their women
" . . because when Gentile men come to their neighbors'
houses to commit adultery with their wives and do not
find them at home, they fornicate with the sheep in the
barns instead . And sometimes even when their neighbors'
wives are at home, they prefer to fornicate with the
animals ; for they love the sheep of the Israelites more
than their own women ."
It is for the same reason that animals are not to be entrusted to
Goi shepherds, nor children to their educators .
5 . UNCLEAN
The Talmud gives two reasons why the Goim are unclean : be
cause they eat unclean things, and because they themselves have not
been cleansed (from original sin) on Mount Sinai . In Schabbath,
(145b) it says "Why are the Goim unclean? Because they eat abominable things and animals that crawl on their belly ."



49
Likewise in Abhodah Zarah, 22b
"Why are the Goim unclean? Because they were not
present at Mount Sinai . For when the serpent entered
into Eve he infused her with uncleanness . But the Jews
were cleansed from this when they stood on Mount
Sinai ; the Goim, however, who were not on Mount Sinai,
were not cleansed ."
6 . COMPARED TO DUNG
"When ten persons are praying together in one place and
they say Kaddisch, or Kedoschah, anyone, even though
he does not belong there, may respond Amen . There are
some, however, who say that no dung or Akum must
be present ." In lore Dea, (198 48) Hagah, it says
"When Jewish women come out of a bath they must
take care to meet a friend first, and not something un
clean or a Christian . For if so, a woman, if she wants
to keep holy, should go back and bathe again ." It is worthy of note that the following list of unclean things is given in Biur Hetib, a commentary on the Schulchan Arukh
"A woman must wash herself again if she sees any un
clean thing, such as a dog, an ass, or People of the
Earth ; a Christian (Akum) a camel," a pig, a horse,
and a leper ."
7 . NOT LIKE MEN, BUT BEASTS
In Kerithuth (6b p . 78) it says :
"The teaching of the Rabbis is : He who pours oil over
a Goi, and over dead bodies is freed from punishment .
This is true for an animal because it is not a man . 411 But
how can it be said that by pouring oil over a Goi one is
freed from punishment, since a Goi is also a man? But
this is not true, for it is written : Ye are my flock, the flock of my pasture are men (Ezechiel, XXXIV, 31) . You are thus called men, but the Goim are not called
men .
In the Tract Makkoth (7b) he is said to be guilty of killing
"except when, if intending to kill an animal he kills a man by mis
take, or intending to kill a Goi, he kills an Israelite."
T In the Vilna ed . of 1873, camel is omitted, since there are no camels
there ; but People of the Earth, and Akum are included . 48 The same holds for the dead body of any man,



50
In Orach Chaiim (225, 10) it says :
"He who sees beautiful creatures, even though it be an
Akum or an animal, let him say `Blessed art thou Our
Lord God, King of the Universe, who hast placed such
things on the earth!' "
8. THEY DIFFER ONLY IN FORM FROM BEASTS In Midrasch Talpioth (fol . 225d) it says :
"God created them in the form of men for the glory of
Israel. But Akum were created for the sole end of min
istering unto them [the Jews] day and night . Nor can
they ever be relieved from this service . It is becoming
to the son of a king [an Israelite] that animals in their natural form, and animals in the form of human beings
should minister unto him ." We can quote here also what is said in Orach Chaiint, 57,6a :
"If pigs are to be pitied when they suffer from disease,
because their intestines are similar to ours, how much
more should the Akum be pitied when thus afflicted .49
9 . ANIMALS In Zohar, II, (64b) it says : " . . . People who worship idols, and who are called cow
and ass, as it is written : I have a cow and an ass . . ."
Rabbi Bechai, in his book Kad Hakkemach, ch . I, beginning
with the word Geulah-redemption-referring to Psalm 80, v . 13 :
The boar out o f the wood doth waste it, says "The letter ain is dropped [suspended] the same as these worshippers are followers of him who was suspended ." Buxtorf (Lex.) says :
`By wild pig the author here means the Christians who
eat pork and, like pigs, have destroyed the vineyard of
Israel, the City of Jerusalem, and who believe in the
`suspended' Christ. Else the letter ain is dropped in this
word because they, as worshippers of Christ who was
hanged, are also dropped."
Rabbi Edels, in commenting on Kethuboth (110b) says
"The Psalmist compares the Akum to the unclean beast
in the woods ."
49 In Taanith (21b) it says : "How much more the Nokhrirn since they are similar to Israelites ."



51
10. WORSE THAN ANIMALS Rabbi Schelomo larchi (Raschi), famous Jewish commentator, explaining the law of Moses (Deuter. XIV, 21) forbidding the eating of meat of wounded animals, but which must be given to the 'stranger in thy gates,' or which, according to Exodus (XXII, 30) is to be thrown to the dogs, has this to say : " . . . for he is like a dog . Are we to take the word 'dog'
here literally? By no means . For the text in speaking of dead bodies says, Or thou mayest sell it to an alien. This applies much more to the meat of wounded animals, for which it is permitted to accept payment. Why therefore does the Scripture say it may be thrown to 'dogs?' In order to teach you that a dog is to be more respected than the Nokhri."
11 . THEY PROPAGATE LIKE BEASTS
In the Sanhedrin (74b) Tosephoth, it says
"The sexual intercourse of a Goi is like to that of a beast." And in Kethuboth (3b) it says :
"The seed of a Goi is worth the same as that of a beast ." Hence it is to be inferred that Christian marriage is not true marriage .
In Kidduschim (68a), it says
" . . . How do we know this? Rabbi Huna says : You can read : Remain here with the ass, that is, with a people like an ass . Hence it appears that they are not capable of contracting marriage ." And in Eben Haezer (44,8) "If a Jew enters into marriage with an Akum (Christian), or with his servant, the marriage is null . For they are not capable of entering into matrimony . Likewise if
an Akuin or a servant enter into matrimony with a Jew, the marriage is null ." In Zohar (II, 64b) it says "Rabbi Abba says : If only idolaters alone had sexual intercourse, the world would not continue to exist . Hence we are taught that a Jew should not give way to those infamous robbers . For if these propagate in greater numbers, it will be impossible for us to continue to exist
because of them . For they give birth to sucklings the
same as dogs ."

12 . CHILDREN OF THE DEVIL
In Zohar (I,28b) we read
"Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast o f the
field, etc . (Genes . III, 1 .) `More subtle' that is towards
evil ; `than all the beasts' that is, the idolatrous people of
the earth . For they are the children of the ancient ser
pent which seduced Eve." 50
The best argument used by the Jews to prove that Christians
are of the race of the devil is the fact that they are uncircumcized .
The foreskin of non-Jews prevents them from being called the
children of the Most High God . For by circumcision the name of
God-Schaddai- is completed in the flesh of a circumcized Jew .
The form of the letter -Isch is in his nostrils, the letter Daleth in his
(bent) arm, and ain appears in his sexual organ by circumcision .
In non-circumcized gentiles, therefore, such as Christians, there are
only the two letters, Isch and Daleth, which make the word Sched,
which means devil . They are, therefore, children of the Sched,
the devil . 51
13 . THE SOULS OF CHRISTIANS ARE EVIL AND UNCLEAN
The teaching of the Jews is that God created two natures, one
good and the other evil, or one nature with two sides, one clean and
the other unclean . From the unclean side, called Keliphah-rind, or
scabby crust-the souls of Christians are said to have come. In Zohar (I, 131a) it says :
"Idolatrous people, however, since they exist, befoul the
world, because their souls come out of the unclean side ." And in Emek Hammelech (23d) it says
"The souls of the impious come from Keliphah, which
is death and the shadow of death ."
Zohar (I,46b, 47a) goes on to show that this unclean side is the
left side, from which the souls of Christians come :
50 This ancient serpent, the parent of Christians, that is, the devil in the
form of a serpent, is called Sammael (cf. Targum Iobi, XXVIII, 7) . Rabbi
Maimonides writes in More (Bk. II, ch . 30) that Sammael took the form of
a serpent and seduced Eve . He is also called the 'Angel of Death,' and 'the
Head of the assembly of evil ones.' Debbarim Rabba (208c) calls him "Sam
mael the impious one, "the prince of all devils ." Rabbi Bechai (in Mikkets)
calls him "The Impious Sammael, the Prince of Rome."
51 cf. Sanhedrin Jud. p. 88.



"And he created every living thing, that is, the Israelites,
because they are the children of the Most High God, and
their holy souls come out from Him. But where do the
souls of the idolatrous gentiles come from? Rabbi
Eliezer says : from the left side, which makes their souls
unclean . They are therefore all unclean and they pollute
all who come in contact with them ."
14 . AFTER DEATH THEY Go DOWN TO HELL
The Elders teach that Abraham sits at the gate of Gehenna and
prevents any circumcized person from entering there ; but that all
the uncircumcized go down into hell .
In Rosch Haschanach (17a) it says
"Heretics and Epicureans and Traitors go down into hell ."
15 . THE FATE OF DEAD CHRISTIANS
The bodies of Christians after death are called by the odious
name of Pegarim, which is the word used in Holy Scripture for
the dead bodies of the damned and of animals, but never for the
pious dead who are called Metim . Thus the Schulchan Arukh or
ders that a dead Christian must be spoken of in the same way as a
dead animal.
In Lore Dea (377,1) it says : "Condolences must not be offered to anyone on account
of the death of his servants or handmaidens . All that
may be said is `May God restore your lost one, the same
as we say to a man who has lost a cow or an ass ."'
Nor must Christians be avoided for seven days after they have
buried someone, as the law of Moses commands, since they are not
men ; for the burial of an animal does not pollute one .
In Iebhammoth (61a) it says :
"The Nokhrim are not rendered unclean by a burial .
For it is said : Ye are my sheep, the sheep o f my pas
ture ; ye are risen . You are thus called men, but not the Nokhrim ."

Article III. -About Christian Rites and Worship
S
INCE Christians are regarded by the Jews as idolaters, all their forms of worship are idolatrous . Their priests are called priests of Baal ; their temples are called houses of lies and idolatry, and
everything they contain, such as chalices, statues and books, are
regarded as made for the serving of idols ; their prayers, both
private and public, are sinful and offensive to God ; and their fes
tivals are called days of evil .
1 . PRIESTS
The Talmud speaks of priests, the ministers of Christian wor
ship, as idolatrous and belonging to the god Baal . They are also
called Komarim-Soothsayers ; and also Galachi,n, the shaved, be
cause they shave their heads, particularly the monks . In Abhodah Zarah (14b) Toseph, it says
"It is forbidden to sell the books of the prophets to the
soothsayers, since they may use them for their evil wor
ship in their idolatrous temples . Those who do so sin
against the law which forbids us to place an obstacle in
the way of a blind person . It is also forbidden to sell
them to a Christian who is not shaved, for he is sure to
give or sell them to one of them who is shaved ."
2 . CHRISTIAN CHURCHES
A place of Christian worship is called (1) Beth Tiflah, a house
of vanity and foolishness, 52 in place of Beth Tefilah, a house of
prayer ; (2) Beth Abhodah Zarah, a House of Idolatry ; (3) Beth
Hatturaph Schel Letsim, a House of Evil Laughter ."
In Abhodah Zarah (78) the Perusch of Maimonides, it says
"Be it known to you that it is beyond a doubt forbidden
by law to pass through a Christian city in which there is
a house of vanity, that is, a house of idolatry ; much
more to live therein. But we today, as a punishment for
our sins, are subject to them, and are forced to live in
their countries, as it was foretold in Deuteronomy (IV,
28) : And there ye shall serve gods, the work o f men's
hands, o f wood and stone. . . . Thus if it is allowed as
predicted to pass around a Christian city, much more so
must we pass around an idolatrous temple ; nor is it al
lowed us even to look inside and above all to enter in ."
52 Wagenseil (in Sota, p . 497) says that Buxtorf, in translating the word
Tiflah as foolishness or vanity, did not go far enough . For this name which
is applied to a Christian church really means a brothel or whorehouse .
6 3 cf . Sepher Zerubbabel, Constantinople edit .



ass
A Jew is forbidden not only to enter a Christian church, but even to go near it, except under certain circumstances .
In Lore Dea (142,10) it says
"It is forbidden to stand in the shadow of a house of idolatry, whether from the inside or the outside, for a distance of four cubits from the front door. It is not forbidden, however, to stand under the shadow of the
back of a church . Nor is the shadow forbidden us if the church stands in a place where formerly there was a public road, which was taken from the community and the house of idolatry built upon it . For the road is still there. But if the house of idolatry existed before the road, it is not permitted to pass before it . There are some who say that it is forbidden to pass there in any case."
Neither is a Jew allowed to listen to, or admire the beautiful
music of the churches. In Lore Dea (142,15) it says
"It is forbidden to listen to the music of idolatrous worship, and to examine the statues of their idols ; for even by looking at them one can be influenced by the evil of idolatry . But one can look who does not intend to be so affected ." Likewise a Jew is not allowed to have a house near a church ; nor is he allowed to rebuild a house which has been destroyed in
such a place . In Lore Dea (143, 1) it says "If a house near an idolatrous temple belonging to the Akunt falls down, it must not be rebuilt. A Jew must remove it a certain distance away if he wishes to rebuild it . But he must fill up the vacant space between his house and the church with bushes and rubbish so that the space will not be used to extend the idolatrous temple."
Here may be added what a certain Rabbi Kelomimus said about a Christian church (in the book Nizzachon) 54 to the Emperor Henry III, who gave him permission to speak his opinion freely about the Basilica which he had recently built at Spires
"After the Emperor Henry III, a very wicked man, had completed the building of that "Abyss," 55 he sent for
54 cf. Wagensel, Sota, p .498.
55 This is how he calls this famous church . The German word is Thum, and by a play on the word he calls it Tehom, which means abyss .



56
Rabbi Kelominus and said to him : 'I want to ask you,
how does this Basilica which I have built compare with
the magnificence of Solomon's Temple, about which so
many volumes have been written?' He replied : `My
Lord, if you will permit me to speak freely, and if you
will swear to me that you will let me go unharmed, I will
tell you the truth about it.' The Emperor answered : 'I
give you my word as a lover of the truth and as an Em
peror, that no harm shall come to you .' Then the Jew
said : `If you gathered together all you have spent so far,
and added to it all the silver and gold in your treasury,
it would not suffice even to pay the workmen and crafts
men that Solomon employed ; for it is written (Chron.
II, Ch . 2) : And Solomon told out threescore and ten
thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand
to hew in the mountains, and three thousand and six
hundred to oversee them . Eight years were spent in the
building of the Temple, much more than you have spent
in building this Tehom [abyss] . And when Solomon had
finished his Temple, see what the Scripture says about
it : The priests could not stand to minister by reason o f
the cloud ; for the glory o f God had filled the House o f
the Lord (Chron . II, Ch. 5,14) . But if someone loaded
an ass with putrid garbage and led it into this abyss of
yours, no one would notice the difference!' The Emperor Henry then replied : `Were it not that I have sworn
to let you go unharmed, I would order your head cut
off.' "
3 . CHALICES
Chalices used in the Sacrifice of the mass are spoken of as ves
sels in which filth is offered up to the idol . Moses Kozzensis, in
Hilkoth Abhodah Zarah (10b) says :
"A Jew who buys chalices of the Goi, which are broken
and thrown away, is not permitted to sell them again to
them, because their priest of Baal will use them in the
worship of the idol ."
4 . BOOKS The Talmud calls the books of the Christians Minim
heretical books - Siphre Debeth Abidan - Books of the House
of Perdition . 56 The Talmud in particular speaks of the books of the
Gospels . Thus in Schabbath (116a) Toseph
56 This is what Jews call a Christian school .



57
"Rabbi Meir calls heretical books Aaven Gilaion (vol
umes of iniquity) because they call them Gospels ."
And Rabbi Jochanan calls these books Aavon Gilaion, evil books .
The Schulchan Arukh, Crakow edition, gives this name as Aven
Niktabh al Haggilaion-iniquity written in a book .
Buxtorf says : "In the Arukh there is a note Scheker Niktabh
al Gilaion, which means, a lie written in a book ."
All the Talmudists agree that the books of the Christians should
be destroyed. They differ only as to what should be done with the
names of God contained in them . In Schabbath ( 116a) it says
"The Glossaries of our own books and the books of the
heretics are not to be saved from the flames, if they
should catch fire on the Sabbath day . Rabbi Jose, however, says : 'On festival days the divine names should be
torn out of the books of the Christians and hidden away ;
what remains must be given to the flames .' But Rabbi
Tarphon says : `In order that I may be remembered by
my children, if those books should ever fall into my
hands I would burn them together with the divine names
contained therein . For if one is chased by an assassin,
or by a serpent, it would be better to take refuge in a
pagan temple than in one of theirs ; because the Christians knowingly resist the truth, whereas the pagans do
so unknowingly ."
5 . PRAYERS
Christian prayers are called, not Tefillah, but Tiflah . They
change the point and insert Iod, which makes it read to mean sin,
foolishness and transgression .
6. CHRISTIAN FESTIVALS
Christian festivals, especially Sunday, are called Iom Ed-day
of destruction, perdition, misfortune or calamity . They are also
simply called Iom Notsri-Christian Days . The word Ed rightly
interpreted means misfortune or calamity, as appears from the Ge
marah and the Glossaries of Maimonides in Abhodah Zarah (2a)
"The word Edehem means the festivals of the Chris
tians, since it is written (in Deuter. XXXII, 35) : the
day o f their calamity ." Maimonides also says in Abhodah Zarah (78c)
"The word Edehem means the foolishness of their fes
tivals . It is the name for their despicable feast days
which do not merit the name of Moedim, for they are
really vain and evil ."



58
Bartenora also writes
"The word Edeheni is the name for their ignominious
festivals and solemnities ."
The marginal notes of Tosephoth also give this name to Christian
festivals . Thus in Abhodah Zarah (6a)
"The Day of Evil, that is the Christian Day, is forbidden
to us as well as all their other feast days ."
Some Christian festivals are mentioned by name, such as the
feast of Christmas and Easter . Moses Mikkozzi, 57 referring to the above text of Abhodah Zarah, says :
"Rabbi Sammuel declares, in the name of Solomon
larchi, that in particular the festivals of Christmas and
Easter, which are their principal evil days and the foun
dation of their religion, are forbidden to us ." Maimonides, in Hilkoth Akum (ch. IX) has the same :
"Sammuel repeats the words of Rabbi Sal . larchi which
forbid us particularly to celebrate the feasts of Christmas
and Easter, which are celebrated on account of him who was hanged ."
Furthermore, indications of the impiety of the Jews are to be
found in the names which they give to these Christian festivals :
For, in place of using Tav in the word Nithal, they often write Tet
and call it Nital for the Latin word Natalis, the Feast of the Na
tivity. They make it appear as if this word were from the root
Natal which connotes extermination or destruction . Likewise they
refuse to use the word Paschal (Pesach) for the Christian feast of
Easter. They substitute Koph for Phe and insert the letter iod and
call it Ketsach or Kesach. Both pronunciations have an evil mean
ing. Ketsach is from the root Katsah, meaning to amputate or cut
off from, and Kesach is from the root Kesa, meaning wood or a
gallows . This is done because the feast of Easter is celebrated by
Christians in memory of Christ-the one who was hanged-who
was put to death and who rose again from the dead .
57 f . G. Edzard, ut supra .



PART TWO
PRECEPTS OF THE TALMUD
CONCERNING CHRISTIANS
From what has been shown thus far, it is clear that, according to the teaching of the Talmud, Christians are idolaters and hateful to Jews . As a consequence, every Jew who wishes to please God has a duty to observe all the precepts which were given to the Fathers of their race when they lived in the Holy Land concerning the idolatrous gentiles, both those who lived amongst them and those in nearby countries .
A Jew is therefore required (1) To avoid Chris
tians ; (2) To do all he can to exterminate them .
59



CHAPTER I
CHRISTIANS MUST BE AVOIDED
J
EWS are required to avoid all contact with Christians for four reasons : (1) Because they are not worthy to share in the Jewish
way of life ; (2) Because they are unclean ; (3) Because they are
idolaters ; (4) Because they are murderers .
Article I . - Christians Must Be Avoided-Because They Are Unworthy to Share Jewish Customs
A
JEW, by the fact that he belongs to the chosen people and is
circumcized, possesses so great a dignity that no one, not even
an angel, can share equality with him .' In fact, he is considered
almost the equal of God . "He who strikes an Israelite" says Rabbi
Chanina "acts as if he slaps the face of God's Divine Majesty ."'
A Jew is always considered good, in spite of certain sins which he
may commit ; nor can his sins contaminate him, any more than dirt
contaminates the kernel in a nut, but only soils its shell ." A Jew
alone is looked upon as a man ; the whole world is his and all
things should serve him, especially "animals which have the form of men ."' Thus it is plain that they regard all contact with Christians as
contaminating, and as detracting from their dignity . They are
1 cf . Chullin, 91b
2 cf . Sanhedrin, 58b
a cf . Chagigah, 15b
a "Thus on the Sabbath day Jews celebrate with wine, meats, fish and
all the delicacies made for men ; for them it is a full holiday ; they abstain
from all kinds of work and will not lift a finger to do anything that has the
appearance of labor or that involves work of any kind . Thus if there is
need to light a fire in winter, to light or blow out a candle, to cook or heat
food, or to milk cows, they employ poor Christians to do such work . Hence
they glory in the fact that they are masters and Christians are their servants
who must minister to them while they rest at their ease . Christian rulers
should see to it that this should be stopped and that others should not
minister to Jews in this way on their Sabbath and other festivals . And it
must be admitted that we, to the detriment of our Christian liberty, aid
them too much in upholding their superstition to avoid all kinds of work
on the Sabbath ." Buxtorf in Synag. Jud. V. 382.



61
therefore required to keep as far away as possible from all who
live and act as Christians do . 5
1 . A JEW MUST NOT SALUTE A CHRISTIAN
In Gittin (62a) it says "A Jew must not enter the home of a Nokhri on a feast
day to offer him greetings . However, if he meets him
on the street, he may offer him a greeting, but curtly and
with head bowed ."
2 . A JEW MUST NOT RETURN THE GREETING OF A CHRISTIAN
In Lore Dea (148,10) it says "A Jew must not return the greeting of a Christian by
bowing before him . It is good, therefore, to salute him
first and so avoid having to answer him back if the
Akum salutes him first ." 6
Rabbi Kohana says that when a Jew salutes a Christian he
should say "Peace to my Lord," but intend this for his own Rabbi . For the Tosephoth says : "For his heart was turned towards his own
Rabbi ."
3 . A JEW MUST NOT Go BEFORE A CHRISTIAN JUDGE
In Choschen Hammischpat (26,1) it says :
"A Jew is not permitted to bring his case before Akum judges, even if the matter is judged by the decisions of
Jewish law, and even if both parties agree to abide by
such decisions. He who does so is impious and similar
to one who calumniates and blasphemes, and who raises
his hand against the Law given us by Moses, our great
law-giver . Hagah says `The Bethin has the power to
excommunicate such a one until he release his Jewish
brother from the hands of the Gentile ."'
4 . A CHRISTIAN CANNOT BE USED AS A WITNESS
In Choschen Ham . (34,19) it says :
"A Goi or a servant is not capable of acting as a wit
ness ."
5 "They are diligently warned not to have any contact with Christians,
not to play with their children, nor to eat or drink with them, nor to have
anything to do with them socially. And parents tell their children the con
versation of Christians is so horrible and vicious that they conceive an im
placable hatred of Christians from their very cradle ." Ibidem, ch. VII, p . 136 .
6 Urbanity is therefore not the reason why Jews appear so amiable in
bowing down so humbly before Christians .



62
5 . A JEW CANNOT EAT CHRISTIAN FOOD In lore Dea (112,1) it says "The Elders forbade the eating of the bread of the Akum, lest we would seem to be familiar with them."
And in Abhodah Zarah (35b) it says :
"The following things belonging to the Goirn are forbidden : Milk which a Goi takes from a cow, in the absence of a Jew ;' also their bread, etc ."
6. A JEW MUST NEVER ACT IN ANY WAY LIKE A CHRISTIAN In Lore Dea (178,1) it says
"It is not permitted to imitate the customs of the Akum, nor to act like them . Nor is it permitted to wear clothes like the Akum, nor to comb the hair as they do . . . neither must Jews build houses that look like temples of the Akum." Since, however, it is not possible to observe all these rules in every place, the Hagah says that they can be overlooked to a certain extent when, for instance, it is to the advantage of a Jew to do so ; for example, if a Jew would profit by a trade which requires a certain kind of dress .
Article II . - Christians Are to Be Avoided
Because They Are Unclean
I
T is not known how often Jews must wash and purify themselves, nor how much they must study to avoid everything which might render them unclean . The Talmud teaches, however, that Christians are people whose touch alone makes things unclean . In Abhodah Zarah (72b) it says "A certain man was pouring wine from one jar into another by means of a tube, when a Goi came along and touched the tube with his hand . As a result all the wine (in both jars) had to be thrown away ."
Every vessel, therefore, must be washed which comes into the possession of a Jew from a Christian, although it has never been in use . In Lore Dea (120,1) it says
T "For fear he would mix the milk of swine or of some other unclean
animal with it" - Surenhusius Mischnah Ab. Zar. p.6.



"If a Jew buys a vessel for use at table from an Akum, whether it is made of metal, glass or lead, even if it is new, he must wash it in a Mikvah [a large basin], or in a cistern which holds forty quarts of water ."
Article III. - Christians Are to Be Avoided
Because They Are Idolaters
1 . LEST a Jew be the occasion of sin to the idolatrous Chris
tians, according to the precept in Levit. XIX,14 : Do not Pitt a stumbling-block before the blind-he must avoid all contact with
them on the days when they worship their gods . In Abhodah Zarah
(2a) it says :
"For three days before their idolatrous festivals it is not permitted to buy or sell them anything . It is also forbidden to give or take any help from them, to change any money with them, to pay them back any debts or allow them to pay back debts ." In the Abhodah Zarah, 78c (the Perusch of Maimonides, fol .
8) it says "All the festivals of the followers of Jesus are forbidden, and we must conduct ourselves towards them as we would towards idolaters . The first day of the week is their principal feast, and it is therefore forbidden to do any business whatsoever with those who believe in Jesus on their Sabbath . We must observe the same rules on their Sabbath as we do on the feastdays of idolaters, as the Talmud teaches."
2 . A JEW MUST NOT USE ANYTHING WHICH PERTAINS TO THE WORSHIP OF CHRISTIANS In Lore Dea (139,1) it says "It is forbidden to have anything to do with idols and everything that is used in their form of worship, whether they are made by the Aku?n or by Jews ."
. . IT IS FORBIDDEN TO SELL TO CHRISTIANS ANYTHING CONNECTED WITH THEIR IDOLATROUS WORSHIP The Abhodah Zarah (14b, Toseph) says "It is always forbidden to sell incense to an idolatrous priest, for it is evident that when he asks for it he wants
63



64
it for no other purpose but to offer it before his idol .
Anyone, therefore, who would sell it to him sins against
the precept which forbids us to place a stumbling-block
before the blind . It is also forbidden to sell candles to
gentiles for their Feast of Candles . Candles however
may be sold to them on other days . Neither is it per
mitted to sell a chalice to a gentile which a Jew has
bought after a Goi has broken it and thrown it away .
It may only be sold again to a gentile of ter it has been
completely made over . For after it has been broken just
once it can be used still to hold the wine which is offered
in honor of their idol ." Then follows the prohibition as to the selling of books to Christian priests, as we have
seen above . Even the work of binding such books is
forbidden to a Jew . In lore Dea, (139,15) it says :
"It is forbidden to bind the books of the Akum, with
the exception of law books . It may be done, however, if
refusal to do so should cause enmity, but only after
every effort has been made to refuse such work ."
Likewise in lore Dea (151,1, Hagah) "It is not permitted to sell water to an Akum if it is known that it will be made into Baptismal water ."
Mention is also made of many other things which it is forbidden
to sell to Christians, such as : cloth from which priestly vestments
and banners may be made ; paper and ink which may be used for
writing books pertaining to their divine worship . It is forbidden to
sell, or even to rent, houses to Christians which will be used by
them as places of worship . Nowadays, however, Jews trade with
Christians, especially on Christian feast days, and also sell them
houses knowing full well that certain Sacraments will be adminis
tered therein, such as Baptism, Holy Communion and Extreme
Unction . The Talmud can give no reason for this, and in the Ab
hodah Zarah (2a, Toseph) it says : "It is difficult to say by what right Jews nowadays trade
with the Goim on their (evil) feast days . For although
many of them commit all kinds of licentious acts and
perversions on their feast days in honor of saints which
they do not look upon as gods, yet every week they
celebrate the Day of the Nazarene [Sunday] which has
always been forbidden to us ."
Bartenora, however, in his commentary on Abhodah Zarah (1,2, fol . 7b) says :



65
"Since, while we are in captivity, we cannot live without
trading with them, and we depend upon them for our
food and we must fear them, it is only forbidden to
trade with them on their feast days ." Furthermore, it is
permitted nowadays to trade with them even on the
actual day of their feasts, because the Rabbis are con
vinced that they do not worship their idols just because
they trade with us . And what is forbidden in this book
must be taken as applying directly to idolatry ."
Rabbi Tam," however, contends that the Mischnah only forbids
the selling of things to idolaters which will be used by them in the
worship of idols, since they rejoice and worship their idols because
they obtain the things necessary for that worship . He explains it
thus (in Abhodah Zarah, 2a, Toseph)
"No one should wonder at this custom of ours . For, although we look upon them as idolaters, they can only
offer up what they buy for money . Hence, our gain and
their joy is not the reason for this prohibition, for they
have enough money for these things, even if we did not
trade with them ."
4 . THIS PROHIBITION DOES NOT APPLY TO ATHEISTS
In Iore Dea (148,5) it says
"It is only permitted to send a gift to an Akuni on one
of their feast days if it is known that he does not believe
in idols and does not worship them ."
Maimonides has the same in Hilkhoth Akum (IX,2)
"It is also wrong to send a gift to a Goi on their feast
days unless it is certain that he does not believe in the
worship of Christian idols, and does not serve them ."
Article IV. - Christians Are to Be Avoided-Because They Are Evil
T HERE is nothing that Jews are more convinced of than the
harm which Christians can do to the children of Israel . Because
of this, the rulers of the Chosen People have always instructed
them not to accept any help from Christians who will always resort
to murder, and to other crimes, whenever they cannot otherwise
obtain their evil ends . Thus, a Jew must not employ a Christian as
a nurse, or as a teacher for his children, or as a doctor, a barber or
an obstetrician .
8 Although Rabbi Ischmael says it is forbidden to trade with them for
three days before their feast days . 9 One of the authors of the Tosephoth, died in 1170.



66
1 . NOT AS A NURSE In Lore Dea (81,7, Hagah) it says :
"A child. must not be nursed by a Nokhri, if an Israelite
can be had ; for the milk of the Nokhrith hardens the
heart of a child and builds up an evil nature in him ." 2 . NOT AS A TEACHER In Lore Dea (153, 1, Hagah) it says
"A child must not be given to the Akum to learn man
ners, literature or the arts, for they will lead him into
heresy ." 3 . NOT AS A DOCTOR In Lore Dea (155,1) it says : "When a Jew is wounded in any way, even so gravely that he would have to violate the Sabbath in having a
doctor, he must not employ the services of a Christian
(Akum) doctor who is not known to everyone in the
neighborhood ; for we must guard against the spilling of
blood. Even when it is not known if the patient will
live or die, such a doctor must not be allowed to attend
him. If, however, he is sure to die, then such a doctor may attend him, since an extra hour of life is not much
to lose . If the Akum insists that a certain medicine is
good, you may believe him, but be sure not to buy it from
him . There are some who say that this holds only when the Akum offer help free, and that it can be accepted
every time it is paid for . But it can be taken for granted
that they would not harm a Jew just for the sake of a
matter of money ." In Pesachim (25a) it says :
"Rabbi Jochanan says : medical help can be accepted
from all except idolaters, fornicators and murderers ." 4 . NOT AS A BARBER In Lore Dea (156,1) it says "You must not be shaven by an Akum unless your
Jewish friends are with you. There are some who say
that it is not permitted to be shaved by an Akum even
when others are present, unless you can see yourself in
a mirror ." 10
io This does not refer to the shaving of beards, but only of the locks of
hair on the neck. For, a Jew who shaves his beard commits five sins, be
cause of its five (star-shaped) points-cf . Maimonides in Hilkhoth Akum,
XII, 5.



5 . NOT AS AN OBSTETRICIAN
In Abhodah Zarah (26a) it says :
"Our Rabbis have passed it down to us, that a foreign woman must never be allowed to act as midwife at the birth of a child of Israel, because they are given to the shedding of blood. The Elders say, however, that a foreign woman may perform this task provided there are other Jewish women present, but never alone. Rabbi Meir, however, says that it is not allowed even when others are present . For they often crush the soft head of the child with their hand and kill it ; and they can do this without being noticed by those who are present ."

CHAPTER II .
CHRISTIANS MUST BE EXTERMINATED
T
HE followers of "that man," whose name is taken by the Jews to mean "May his name and memory be blotted out," are not
otherwise to be regarded than as people whom it would be good to get rid of . They are called Romans and tyrants who hold captive
the children of Israel, and by their destruction the Jews would be
freed from this Fourth Captivity . Every Jew is therefore bound to
do all he can to destroy that impious kingdom of the Edomites
(Rome) which rules the whole world . Since, however, it is not
always and everywhere possible to effect this extermination of Christians, the Talmud orders that they should be attacked at least
indirectly, namely : by injuring them in every possible way, and by
thus lessening their power, help towards their ultimate destruction .
Wherever it is possible a Jew should kill Christians, and do so
without mercy.
Article I . -HARM MUST BE DONE TO CHRISTIANS
A
TEW is commanded to harm Christians wherever he can, both indirectly by not helping there in any way, and also directly
by wrecking their plans and projects ; neither must he save a Chris
tian who is in danger of death .
I . GOOD MUST NOT BE DONE TO CHRISTIANS In Zohar (1,25b) it says "Those who do good to the Akuni, . . . will not rise from the dead ."
At times it is permitted to do good to Christians, but only in order
to help Israel, namely, for the sake of peace and to hide hatred of
them . Maimonides in Hilkhoth Akum (X,6) says :
"Needy Gentiles may be helped as well as needy Jews, for the sake of peace . . ."



In lore Dea (148,12 Hagah) it says :
"Therefore if you enter a town and find them celebrat
ing a feast, you may pretend to rejoice with them in
order to hide your hatred . Those, however, who care
about the salvation of their souls should keep away
from such celebrations . You should make it known
that it is a hateful thing to rejoice with then, if you
can do so without incurring their enmity ."
1 . IT Is NOT PERMITTED TO PRAISE A CHRISTIAN In Abhodah Zarah (20,a, Toseph) it says "Do not say anything in praise of them, lest it be said How good that Goi is!" 1 In this way they explain the words of Deuteronomy (VII,2) .
and thou shalt show no mercy unto them [Goim], as cited in the
Gemarah . Rabbi S . larchi explains this Bible passage as follows : "Do not pay them any compliments ; for it is forbidden to say : how good that Goi is ." In Lore Dea (151, 14) it says
"No one is allowed to praise them or to say how good
an Akum is . How much less to praise what they do
or to recount anything about them which would re
dound to their glory . If, however, while praising them
you intend to give glory to God, namely, because he
has created comely creatures, then it is allowed to
do so."
2 . A .JEW NOT ALLOWED TO MENTION THE THINGS WHICH
CHRISTIANS USE FOR THEIR IDOLATROUS WORSHIP In Hilkhoth Akum (V,12) it says :
"It is also forbidden to make mention of the Akum ;
for it is written (Exodus XXIII, 13) : . . . and make
no mention o f other gods."
3 . THEIR IDOLS MUST BE SPOKEN OF WITH CONTEMPT In lore Dea (146,15) it says :
"Their idols must be destroyed, or called by con
temptuous names ."
1 Maimonides (in Milk. Akurn X,5) adds : "Moreover, you should seek
opportunity to mix with them and find out about their evil doings."
69



70
Ibidem, (147,5)
"It is permitted to deride idols, and it is forbidden to
say to a Goi : May your God help you, or I hope you will succeed."
Rabbi Bechai, explaining the text of Deuteronomy about hating
idolatry, says
"The Scripture teaches us to hate idols and to call
them by ignominious names . Thus, if the name of a
church is Bethgalia-"house of magnificence," it
should be called Bethkaria-an insignificant house, a
pigs' house, a latrine . For this word karia denotes a
low-down, slum place ."
In numerous places ignominious names are given by the Jews
to Christian things . It will not be out of place to list a few of these
names which they give to things and persons which are held holy
and dear by Christians, as follows
JESUS is ignominiously called Jeschu-which means, May his
name and memory be blotted out . His proper name in Hebrew is
Jeschua, which means Salvation .
MARY, THE MOTHER OF JESUS, is called Charia-dung,
excrement (German Dreck) . In Hebrew her proper name is Miriam .
CHRISTIAN SAINTS, the word for which in Hebrew is Ke
doschim, are called Kededchim (cinaedos) -feminine men (Fair
ies) . Women saints are called Kedeschoth, Whores . SUNDAY is called the day of calamity .
FEAST OF CHRISTMAS is called Nital, denoting extermina
tion .
EASTER is not called by the proper word Pesach (Passover),
but Ketsach, meaning a cutting down ; or Kesach, a Gallows. A CHRISTIAN CHURCH is not called Beth Hattefillah,
House of Prayer, but Beth Hattiflah, a House of Vanity, a House
of Evil.
THE GOSPEL BOOKS are called Aavon Gilaion, Books of
Iniquity .
CHRISTIAN SACRIFICES are called Dung Offerings . In the
Jerusalem Talmud (fol.13b) the following occurs
"He who sees them mezabbelim (excrementing-sacri
ficing) before their idol, let him say (Exod . XXII, 20) : He that sacrificeth unto an idol shall be utterly destroyed."



Rabbi larchi (referring to Num . XXV,3) teaches that the Gentiles actually honor their God by excrementing before him .
ACHRISTIAN GIRL who works for Jews on their Sabbath is called Schaw-wesschicksel, Sabbath Dirt.
4 . A JEW IS NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE GIFTS TO CHRISTIANS In Hilkhoth Akum (X,5) it says : "It is forbidden to give gifts to the Goim . But it is permitted to give them to a convert who lives among the Jews ; for it is said : To the traveller who stops in your cities, give it to him to eat, or sell it to a Gentile, that is sell it, not give it." In I ore Dea (151, 11) it says
"It is forbidden to give free gifts to the Akum with whom a Jew may not treat familiarly ."
The Talmud, however, allows a Jew to give gifts to Gentiles who are known to him and from whom he has hope of getting something in return .
5 . A JEW IS FORBIDDEN TO SELL HIS FARM TO CHRISTIANS In Lore Dea (334,43) it says :
"In 24 cases a Jew must be repudiated, namely . . . 8. Anyone who sells his farm to the Akum must be sent into exile-unless he undertakes to make up for all the harm that follows as a consequence of having the Akum live near the Jews ."
6 . IT IS FORBIDDEN TO TEACH A TRADE TO CHRISTIANS In Lore Dea (154, 2) it says : "It is not permitted to teach any trade to the Akum"
II. HARM MUST BE DONE TO THE WORK OF CHRISTIANS
Since the Goim minister to Jews like beasts of burden, they belong to a Jew together with his life and all his faculties
"The life of a Goi and all his physical powers belong to a Jew ." (A . Rohl . Die Polem. p .20)
It is an axiom of the Rabbis that a Jew may take anything that belongs to Christians for any reason whatsoever, even by fraud ;
nor can such be called robbery since it is merely taking what belongs
to him .
71



72
In Babha Bathra (54b) it says
"All things pertaining to the Goim are like a desert ;
the first person to come along and take them can claim them for his own ."
1 . CHRISTIANS MUST NOT BE TOLD IF THEY PAY Too MUCH TO A JEW In Choschen Hammischpat (183,7) it says
"If you send a messenger to collect money from an
Akum and the Akuan pays too much, the messenger
may keep the difference . But if the messenger does
not know about it, then you may keep it all yourself ."
2 . LOST PROPERTY OF CHRISTIANS MUST NOT BE RETURNED TO THEM In Choschen Ham . (266,1) it says : "A Jew may keep anything he finds which belongs to
the Akum, for it is written : Return to thy brethren
what is lost (Deuter .XXII,3) . For he who returns
lost property [to Christians] sins against the Law by
increasing the power of the transgressors of the Law .
It is praiseworthy, however, to return lost property if
it is done to honor the name of God, namely, if by so doing Christians will praise the Jews and look upon
them as honorable people."
3 . CHRISTIANS MAY BE DEFRAUDED
In Babha Kama (113b) it says "It is permitted to deceive a Goi ." And in Choschen Ham. (156,5 . Hagah) it says
"If a Jew is doing good business with an Akum it is
not allowed to other Jews, in certain places, to come
and do business with the same Akum . In other places,
however, it is different, where another Jew is allowed
to go to the same Akum, lead him on, do business
with him and to deceive him and take his money . For
the wealth of the Akum is to be regarded as common
property and belongs to the first who can get it . There
are some, however, who say that this should not be done ." In Choschen Ham . (183,7 Hagah) it says
"If a Jew is doing business with an Akum and a fel
low Israelite comes along and defrauds the Akum,



either by false measure, weight or number, he must divide his profit with his fellow Israelite, since both
had a part in the deal, and also in order to help him
along ."
4. A JEW MAY PRETEND HE IS A CHRISTIAN TO DECEIVE CHRIS
TIANS
In Lore Dea (157,2 . Hagah) it says
"If a Jew is able to deceive them [idolaters] by pre
tending he is a worshipper of the stars, he may do so." 2
5 . A JEW IS ALLOWED TO PRACTICE USURY ON CHRISTIANS In Abhodah Zarah (54a) it says
"It is allowed to take usury from Apostates' who fall
into idolatry ."
And in Lore Dea (159,1) it says
"It is permitted, according to the Torah, to lend money
town Akumn with usury . Some of the Elders, however,
deny this except in a case of life and death . Nowadays
it is permitted for any reason ."
III . CHRISTIANS TO BE HARMED IN LEGAL MATTERS
1 . A JEW MAY LIE AND PERJURE HIMSELF TO CONDEMN A
CHRISTIAN
In Babha Kama (113a) it says :
"Our teaching is as follows : When a Jew and a Goi
come into court, absolve the Jew, if you can, according
to the laws of Israel . If the Goi wins, tell him that is
what our laws require . If, however, the Jew can be
absolved according to the gentile law, absolve him and
say it is due to our laws . If this cannot be done pro
ceed callously against the Goi, as Rabbi Ischmael ad
vises . Rabbi Akibha, however, holds that you cannot
act fraudulently lest you profane the Name of God,
and have a Jew committed for perjury ."
2 This text is also found in the Vilna edition of 1873.
a The Jews call Baptism Schonted, and an apostate baptized Jew, a
Meschummad.
73



74
A marginal note, however, explains this qualification of Rabbi
Akibha as follows :
"The name of God is not profaned when it is not
known by the Goi that the Jew has lied ." And further on, the Babha Kama (113b) says
"The name of God is not profaned when, for example,
a Jew lies to a Goi by saying : `I gave something to
your father, but he is dead ; you must return it to me,'
as long as the Goi does not know that you are lying."
2 . A JEW MAY PERJURE HIMSELF WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE
In Kallah (lb, p.18) it says
"She (the mother of the mamzer) said to him, `Swear
to me .' And Rabbi Akibha swore with his lips, but in
his heart he invalidated his oath ."'
A similar text is found in Schabbuoth Hagahoth of Rabbi Ascher
(6d) :
"If the magistrate of a city compels Jews to swear
that they will not escape from the city nor take anything out of it, they may swear falsely by saying to
themselves that they will not escape today, nor take
anything out of the city today only ."
IV. C H R I S T I A N S MUST BE HARMED IN THINGS NECESSARY FOR LIFE
Jews must spare no means in fighting the tyrants who hold them
in this Fourth Captivity in order to set themselves free . They must
fight Christians with astuteness and do nothing to prevent evil from
happening to them : their sick must not be cared for, Christian
women in childbirth must not be helped, nor must they be saved
when in danger of death .
1 . A JEW MUST ALWAYS TRY TO DECEIVE CHRISTIANS
In Zohar (I, 160a) it says
"Rabbi Jehuda said to him [Rabbi ~Chezkia] : 'He is
to be praised who is able to free himself from the ene
mies of Israel, and the just are much to be praised
who get free from them and fight against them .' Rabbi
Chezkia asked, `How must we fight against them?'
' cf . supra, p .30



Rabbi Jehuda said, `By wise counsel thou shalt war against them' (Proverbs, ch . 24, 6) . By what kind of war? The kind of war that every son of man must fight against his enemies, which Jacob used against Esau - by deceit and trickery whenever possible . They must be fought against without ceasing, until proper order be restored. Thus it is with satisfaction that I say we should free ourselves from them and rule over them ."
2 . A SICK CHRISTIAN MUST NOT BE AIDED In lore Dea (158,1) it says
"The Akum are not to be cured, even for money, unless it would incur their enmity."
3 . A CHRISTIAN WOMAN IN CHILDBIRTH MUST NOT BE HELPED In Orach Chaiim (330,2) it says :
"No help is to be given to an Akum woman in labor on the sabbath, even in a small way, for the . Sabbath must not be violated."
4. A CHRISTIAN IN DANGER OF DEATH MUST NOT BE HELPED In Choschen Ham. (425,5) it says :
"If you see a heretic, who does not believe in the Torah, fall into a well in which there is a ladder, hurry at once and take it away and say to him `I have to go and take my son down from a roof ; I will bring the ladder back to you at once' or something else . The Kuthaei, however, who are not our enemies, who take care of the sheep of the Israelites, are not to be killed directly, but they must not be saved from death ."
And in lore Dea (158,1) it says
"The Akum who are not enemies of ours must not be killed directly, nevertheless they must not be saved from danger of death . For example, if you see one of them fall into the sea, do not pull him out unless he promises to give you money ."

Non licet misereri eorum ; quia dicitur : (Ne misereberis eorum-'). Idcirco, si quis viderit Akum pereuntem, vel aquis demersum, ne opem •f erat . Si eum morti proximum viderit, ne eripiat morti . Attamen manu sua eum perdere, praecipitem in puteum dare, vel siquid huic simile, nefas est, quia nobiscum bellum non gerit .
Maimonides, in Hilkhoth Akum (X,1) says :
"Do not have any pity for them, for it is said (Deuter. V11,2) : Show no mercy unto them . Therefore, if you see an Akum in difficulty or drowning, do not go to his help . And if he is in danger of death, do not save him from death. But it is not right to kill him by your own hand by shoving them into a well or in some other way, since they are not at war with us."



Article II . - CHRISTIANS ARE TO BE KILLED
LASTLY, the Talmud commands that Christians are to be killed
without mercy . In the Abhodah Zarah (26b) it says :
"Heretics, traitors and apostates are to be thrown into
a well and not rescued." And in Choschen Hammischpat (388,10) it says :
"A spy is to be killed, even in our days, wherever he
is found . He may be killed even before he confesses .
And even if he admits that he only intended to do
harm to somebody, and if the harm which he intended
is not very great, it is sufficient to have him condemned to death . He must be warned, however, not to confess
to this . But if he impudently says `No, I will confess
it!' then he must be killed, and the sooner the better . If there is no time to warn him, it is not necessary to
do so. There are some who say that a traitor is to be
put to death only when it is impossible to get rid of him by mutilating him, that is, by cutting out his
tongue or his eyes, but if this can be done he must not
be killed, since he is not any worse than others who
persecute us ." And in Choschen Hamni . again (388,15) it says
"If it can be proved that someone has betrayed Israel
three times, or has given the money of Israelites to the
Akuni, a way must be found after prudent considera
tion to wipe him off the face of the earth ."
Quinimo, ipsum studium Legis Iudaeorum mortis poenam meretur .
Sanhedrin 59 a :
T11M PM1yt7 'la tIrll' '='I Vta R . lochanan dicit : Goi scrutans ,'IM MITT legem, reus est mortis .
Even a Christian who is found studying the Law of Israel merits death . In Sanhedrin (59a) it says : "Rabbi Jochanan says : A Goi who pries into the Law is guilty of death ."

II. BAPTIZED JEWS ARE TO BE PUT TO DEATH In Hilkhoth Akum (X,2) it says : "These things [supra] are intended for idolaters . But Israelites also, who lapse from their religion and become epicureans, are to be killed, and we must persecute them to the end. For they afflict Israel and turn the people from God."
And in Lore Dea (158,2 Hagah) it says
"Renegades who turn to the pleasures of the Akum,
and who become contaminated with them by worship
ping stars and planets as they do, are to be killed ." Likewise in Choschen, Hamm. (425,5) it says :
"Jews who become epicureans, who take to the wor
ship of stars and planets and sin maliciously ; also
those who eat the flesh of wounded animals, or who
dress in vain clothes, deserve the name of epicureans ;
likewise those who deny the Torah and the Prophets
of Israel - the law is that all those should be killed ;
and those who have the power of life and death should
have them killed ; and if this cannot be done, they
should be led to their death by deceptive methods ."

Rabbi Maimonides, in Hilkhoth Teschubhah (111,8), gives the list of those who are considered as denying the Law "There are three classes of people who deny the Law
of the Torah : (1) Those who say that the Torah was not given by God, at least one verse or one word of it, and who say that it was all the work of Moses ; (2)
Those who reject the explanation of the Torah, namely, the Oral Law of the Mischnah, and do not recognize the authority of the Doctors of the Law, like the followers of Tsadok (Sadducees) and Baithos ; (3) Those who say that God changed the Law for another New Law, and that the Torah no longer has any value, although they do not deny that it was given by God, as the Christians and the Turks believe . All of these
deny the Law of the Torah,"
79



so
III . CHRISTIANS ARE TO BE KILLED BECAUSE THEY ARE TYRANTS
In Zohar (I,25a) it says :
"The People of the Earth are idolaters, and it has been written about them : Let them be wiped off the face of
the earth . Destroy the memory of the Amalekites. They are with us still in this Fourth Captivity, namely, the Princes [of Rome] . . . who are really Amalakites ."
1 . THESE PRINCES ARE TO BE KILLED FIRST For if they are allowed to live, the hope of the liberation of the Jews is in vain, and their prayers for release from this Fourth Captivity are of no avail. In Zohar (I,219b) it says "It is certain that our captivity will last until the princes of the gentiles who worship idols are destroyed ." And again in Zohar (II,19a) it says : "Rabbi Jehuda said : Come and see how it is ; how the princes have assumed power over Israel and the Israelites make no outcry. But their rejoicing is heard when the prince falls . It is written that : the King of the Egyptians died and soon the children of Israel were released from captivity ; they cried out and their voice ascended to God ."
2 . THE PRINCEDOM WHOSE CHIEF CITY IS ROME IS THE ONE TO BE HATED MOST OF . ALL BY THE JEWS
They call it the Kingdom of Esau, and of the Edomites, the Kingdom of Pride, the Wicked Kingdom, Impious Rome . The Turkish Empire is called the Kingdom of the Ismaelites which they do not wish to destroy . The Kingdom of Rome, however, must be exterminated, because when corrupt Rome is destroyed, salvation and freedom will come to God's Chosen People . 5

Rabbi David Kimchi writes as follows in Obadiaan "What the Prophets foretold about the destruction of Edom in the last days was intended for Rome, as Isaiah explains (ch .34,1) : Come near, ye nations, to hear . . . For when Rome is destroyed, Israel shall be redeemed ."
Rabbi Abraham also, in his book Tseror Hamfnor, section Scho tint, says the same :
"Immediately after Rome is destroyed we shall be redeemed ."

IV. LASTLY, ALL CHRISTIANS, INCLUDING THE BEST OF THEM, ARE TO BE KILLED
Abhodah zarah 26 b . Tosephoth

In Abhodah Zarah (26b, Tosephoth) it says : "Even the best of the Goim should be killed" The Schulchan Arukh, after the words of Lore Dea (158,1), that those of the Akum who do no harm to Jews are not to be killed, namely those who do not wage war against Israel, thus explains the word Milchamah - war "But in time of war the Akum are to be killed, for it is written : `The good among the Akum deserve to be

In Sepher Or Israel (177b) it says
"Take the life of the Kliphoth and kill them, and you will please God the same as one who offers incense to Him ."



83
And in lalkut Simoni (245c. n. 772) it says :
"Everyone who sheds the blood of the impious is as
acceptable to God as he who offers a sacrifice to God ."
VI. AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM, THE ONLY SACRIFICE NECESSARY IS THE EXTERMINATION OF CHRISTIANS
In Zohar (III,227b) the Good Pastor says "The only sacrifice required is that we remove the unclean from amongst us ."
Zohar (II, 43a), explaining the precept of Moses about the redemp
tion of the first-born of an ass by offering a lamb, says :
"The ass means the non-Jew, who is to be redeemed
by the offering of a lamb, which is the dispersed sheep
of Israel . But if he refuses to be redeemed, then break his skull . . . . They should be taken out of the book of
the living, for it is said about them : He who sins
against me, I shall take out of the book of life ."
VII . THOSE WHO KILL CHRISTIANS SHALL HAVE A HIGH PLACE IN HEAVEN
In Zohar (I,38b, and 39a) it says :
"In the palaces of the fourth heaven are those who
lamented over Sion and Jerusalem, and all those who
destroyed idolatrous nations . . . and those who killed off people who worship idols are clothed in purple
garments so that they may be recognized and hon
ored ."
VIII. JEWS MUST NEVER CEASE TO EXTERMINATE THE GOIM ; THEY MUST NEVER LEAVE THEM IN PEACE AND NEVER SUBMIT TO THEM In Hilkhoth Akum (X,1) it says
"Do not eat with idolaters, nor permit them to wor
ship their idols ; for it is written : Make no covenant
with them, nor show mercy unto them (Deuter . ch.7,
2) . Either turn them away from their idols or kill
them." Ibidem (X,7)
"In places where Jews are strong, no idolater must be
allowed to remain . . ."



84
IX. ALL JEWS ARE OBLIGED TO UNITE TOGETHER TO DESTROY TRAITORS AMONGST THEM In Choschen Hamm . (338,16) it says : "All the inhabitants of a city are obliged to contribute to the expense of killing a traitor, even those who
have to pay other taxes ." X. NO FESTIVAL, NO MATTER HOW SOLEMN, MUST PREVENT THE BEHEADING OF A CHRISTIAN In Pesachim (49b) it says :
Rabbi Eliezer said : It is permitted to cut off the head
of an `idiot' [one of the People of the Earth] on the feast of the Atonement when it falls on the Sabbath . 6
His disciples said to him : Rabbi, you should rather
say to sacrifice . But he replied : By no means, for it
is necessary to pray while sacrificing, and there is no need of prayers when you behead someone ."
XI. THE ONE OBJECT OF ALL THE ACTIONS AND PRAYERS OF THE JEWS SHOULD BE TO DESTROY THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
Thus the Jews picture their Messiah and Liberator whom they
expect, as a persecutor who will inflict great calamities upon non
Jews . The Talmud lists three great evils which will come upon the
world when the Messiah comes . In Schabbath (118a) it says
"Whoever eats three meals on the Sabbath shall be saved from the three evils from the punishments of
the Messiah, from the pain of hell and from the war
of Magog ; for it is written : Behold, I shall send you Elias the Prophet before the coming o f the `Day' o f the Lord, etc."
X II . IN THEIR PRAYERS THE JEWS SIGH FOR THE COMING OF THE REVENGEFUL MESSIAH, ESPECIALLY ON THE EVE OF THE PASSOVER : "Pour out thy anger upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the kingdoms which do not invoke thy name ; Pour out thy indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them ; Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the Lord ." "
6 No day more holy than this could be imagined .
T cf. Sanhedrin, chap . VII near the end, and Iebhammoth, the last chap .



They also pray as follows :
"How long will thy strength remain captive and thy beauty lie under the hand of the oppressor? 0 God! Show forth thy strength and thy zeal against our enemies ; break their strength and let them be confounded . . ."
And again
"Cut off the hope of the unjust; let all heretics perish
at once ; root out, break up and destroy the Proud Kingdom ; hasten to make all peoples subject in our days."
At that very same time, on Good Friday, that "Prince of the Proud Empire" of Rome, the Pope, prays, and orders everyone in the world to pray for all "heretics" and those who are "lost," as follows
"Let us pray for the perfidious Jews : that the Lord our God may take away the veil from their hearts, that they may acknowledge Jesus Christ our Lord .
"Omnipotent and Eternal God, who dost not even exclude Jewish perfidy from thy mercy : hear our prayers which we offer for the blindness o f that people, that, having recognized the light o f thy truth, which is Christ, they may come out o f their darkness, Through Jesus Christ our Lord . . ."

HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THY TABERNACLES,
O JACOB, AND THY TENTS, 0 ISRAEL!
(Num. 24, 5 )



EPILOGUE
KIND READER : In this work I have quoted from only a
very few of the Talmudic books which refer to the Chris
tians . For the sake of brevity, and to spare your sensitive
soul, I omitted many others which could have been in
cluded. These texts, however, which I have quoted should
be sufficient to demonstrate how false are the statements
of the Jews when they claim that there is nothing in the
Talmud which teaches hatred and enmity for Christians .
If it revolted you, Christian reader, to study the hor
rible blasphemies in this book, do not vent your anger on
me. I did not state in the beginning that I was going to
narrate something pleasant, but merely to show you what
the Talmud really teaches about Christians, and I do not think I could have done so in a more suitable way .
I realize, however, that, since the truth does not please
everyone, there are many who will become my enemies for
thus having borne witness to the truth . And I have been reminded of this, both by the laws of the Talmud itself
which threatens death to "traitors," and more so, by the
warnings of those who have had experience of the actions
which Jews take against those who make known things
which are not favorable to them . They all foretold that I
would perish at the hands of the Jews . In trying to pre
vent me from going ahead with my work, some begged me
to remember the fate of Professor Charini, who was sud
denly killed after he had undertaken to translate the Tal
mud into the vernacular . Others reminded me of the fate
of the monk Didacus of Vilna, a convert from Judaism,
who was cruelly murdered ; others of those who had been
$7



88
persecuted for having revealed secrets of the Jewish re
ligion. Still others warned me of the danger to those dear
to me. "Wszak ciebie zydzi zabija" * was repeated to me
hundreds of times .
The book you now hold in your hand is the best proof
that I did not heed these warnings of my friends . I con
sidered it unworthy of me to keep silent just for the sake
of my own personal safety while the conflict rages between
the two camps of "Semites" and "Anti-Semites," both of
which claim they are fighting for the truth, while I know
that the whole truth is not to be found in either camp . But whatever befalls me because of what I have done,
I shall gladly suffer it . I am prepared to lay down my
life THAT I MAY BEAR WITNESS TO THE TRUTH

APPENDIX*
HOW THE POPES TREATED THE JEWS
Pope Innocent III decreed as follows
"As Cain was a wanderer and an outcast, not to be killed by anyone but marked with the sign of fear on his forehead, so the Jews . . . against whom the voice of the blood of Christ cries out . . . although they are not to be killed they must always be dispersed as wanderers upon the face of the earth ." 1 "Although Christian piety tolerates the Jews . . . whose own fault commits them to perpetual slavery . . . and allows them to continue with us (even though the Moors will not tolerate them), they must not be allowed to remain ungrateful to us in such a way as to repay us with contumely for favors and contempt for our familiarity . They are admitted to our familiarity only through our mercy ; but they are to us dangerous as the insect in the apple, as the serpent in the breast * * * Since, therefore, they have already begun to gnaw like the rat, and to stink like the serpent, it is to our shame that the fire in our breast which is being eaten into by them, does not consume them * * * As they are reprobate slaves of the Lord, in whose death they evilly conspired (at least by the effect of the deed), let them acknowledge themselves as slaves of those whom the death of Christ has made

Under this same Pope, Innocent III, the Fourth Lateran Council, in 1215, adopted canons Nos . 67-70, decreeing the Roman Catholic attitude towards the Jews : 3

The first is financial, containing protective measures for Chris
tians against the rapacity of Jews as userers . Only Jews were per
mitted to lend money at interest .
The second decrees that all Jews be distinguished for all time
from Christians by color of dress and distinctive badge.
The third forbids Jews to have Christians as nurses, tutors, and
domestic servants and forbids Christians to cohabit with Jews and
Jewesst-s. Legal marriage with them was impossible .
The fourth forbids the acceptance of legal testimony of Jews
against Christians and orders preference for the testimony of a
Christian against a Jew . An order is also added that all in authority
in Church and State must watch continually lest converted and
baptized Jews continue to practice the rites of their former faith .
A few years later Pope Innocent III reiterates and confirms
these edicts of the Lateran Council as follows :
"TO THE KING OF FRANCE THAT HE MUST CRUSH THE INSOLENCE OF THE JEWS RESIDING IN HIS KINGDOM,
"Although it be not displeasing to the Lord, but rather
acceptable to Him, that the Jewish Dispersion should
live and serve under Christian princes * * * they greatly
offend in the sight of God's Divine Majesty who prefer
the offspring of the Crucifiers before those who are the heirs of Christ. * * * It has come to our knowledge that
in the kingdom of France Jews have so much liberty that,
under a species of usury - by which they not only extort
interest, but interest from interest -they obtain control
of the goods of the churches and the possessions of the
Christians . * * * Furthermore, although it was decreed
in the Lateran Council that Jews be not permitted to have
Christian servants in their homes, either as tutors for
their children or for domestic service, or for any reason
whatsoever, they still persist in having Christians as
servants and nurses, with whom they commit abomina
tions of a kind which it rather becomes you to punish
than us to explain . And again, although the same Council
laid it down that the testimony of Christians against
Jews is to be admitted, even when the former use Jewish
witnesses against Christians, and decreed that in a case
of this kind anyone who would prefer Jews before Chris
tians is to be condemned as anathema, yet up to the
present time things are so carried on in the kingdom of



France that the testimony of Christians against Jews is
not believed, whereas Jews are admitted as witnesses
against Christians . And at times, when they to whom
Jews have loaned money with usury produce Christian
witnesses about the facts of payment, THE DEED
WHICH THE CHRISTIAN DEBTOR THROUGH
NEGLIGENCE INDISCREETLY LEFT WITH
THEM IS BELIEVED RATHER THAN THE WIT
NESSES WHOM THEY BRING FORWARD . On
Good Friday also, contrary to the law of old, they walk
through the streets and public squares, and meeting
Christians who everywhere according to custom go to
adore the Crucifix, they deride them and strive to prevent
them from this duty of adoration . We warn and exhort
Your Serene Majesty in the Lord (adding the remission
of your sins) that you force the Jews from their pre
sumption * * * and see to it that due punishment be
meted out to all such blasphemers, and that an easy par
don be not given to delinquents .' In 1567, Pope Pius V revoked the small concession, granted to
Jews by Pius IV, enabling them to possess immovable property up
to the value of 1,500 gold ducats . He ordered the Jews to sell all
their properties to Christians . Two years later he ordered all Jews
expelled from the States of the Church :
"By authority of these present Letters, We order that
each and every Jew of both sexes in Our Temporal Do
minions, and in all the cities, lands, places and baronies
subject to them, shall depart completely out of the con
fines thereof within the space of three months after the
present Letters shall have been made public. They shall
be despoiled of all their goods, and be prosecuted accord
ing to the due process of law . They shall become bonds
men of the Roman Church, and shall be subjected to
perpetual servitude . And the said Church shall claim the
same right over them as other dominions over their slaves
and bondsmen . 5
In 1244, Pope Innocent IV also ordered the burning of Jewish
books . He exhorted the King of France as follows "Our dear Son, the Chancellor of Paris, and the Doc
tors, before the clergy and people, publicly burned by fire
' Migne, op .cit ., CCXV, 501 . 5 Bull. Rom. Pont., VII, 741.

the aforesaid books (The Talmud) with all their appendices . We beg and beseech your Celestial Majesty in the Lord Jesus, that, having begun laudably and piously to prosecute those who perpetuate these detestable excesses, that you continue with due severity. And that you command throughout your whole kingdom that the aforesaid books with all their glossaries, already condemned by the Doctors, be committed to the flames . Firmly prohibiting Jews from having Christians as servants and nurses . * * * 6
Pope Gregory IX sent the following to the archbishops of Germany
"The Jews, who are admitted to our acquaintance only through our mercy, should never forget their yoke of perpetual slavery, which they bear through their own fault . In the Council of Toledo it was decreed that Jews of both sexes, and for all time, should be distinguished from others by their mode of dress . We therefore command that each and every one of you to have all the excesses of the Jews completely repressed, lest they should presume to raise their necks from the yoke of servitude in contumely of the Redeemer ; forbidding them to discuss in any way concerning their faith or rites with Christians . In this matter calling to your aid the help of the civil power, inflicting upon Christians, who offer opposition, due ecclesiastical punishment
* * * 11 7
Pope Eugenius IV, in 1442, issued the following decree :
"We decree and order that from now on, and for all time, Christians shall not eat or drink with Jews ; nor admit them to feasts, nor cohabit with them, nor bathe with them . Christians shall not allow Jews to hold civil honors over Christians, or to exercise public offices in the State. Jews cannot be merchants, Tax Collectors, or agents in the buying and selling of the produce and goods
of Christians, nor their Procurators, Computers or Lawyers in matrimonial matters, nor Obstetricians ; nor can
they have association or partnership with Christians . No Christian can leave or bequeath anything in his last Will
6 Bull. Rom . Pont., 1V, 509 . 7 Bull . Rom. Pont., III, 497.



and Testament to Jews or their congregations . Jews are
prohibited from erecting new synagogues . They are
obliged to pay annually a tenth part of their goods and
holdings. Against them Christians can testify, but the
testimony of Jews against Christians in no case is of any
value . All and every single Jew, of whatever sex and
age, must everywhere wear the distinct dress and known
marks by which they can be evidently distinguished from
Christians . They cannot live among Christians, but in a
certain street, separated and segregated from Christians,
and outside which they cannot under any pretext have
houses * * *" 8
In 1555, Pope Paul IV reiterated these restrictions against the
Jews and added some new ones . He ordered Jews to pay an annual
amount for every synagogue, "even those that have been demol
ished," and said : ."Jews can only engage themselves in the work of
street-sweepers and rag-pickers, and cannot be produce merchants
or in things necessary for human use .° For contravening these
regulations Jews are to be punished "as rebels and criminals laesae
majestatis rei (high treason), held as outlaws by all Christian peo
ple, by the judgment of our Vicars, Deputies and Magistrates * * *"
The present attitude of the Roman Catholic Church toward the
Jew, as well as that of Mussolini, is of much interest for the latter
has revived the age-old disabilities of the Church against the Jews .
All Jewish literature is forbidden and no book by a foreign Jew can
be translated into Italian . No play by a foreign Jew can be pro
duced . No Jew is allowed to broadcast over the radio . Jewish pro
fessors are barred from Italian universities and textbooks of 114
Jewish writers have been withdrawn from the schools . Jews have
been expelled from all administrative posts . Marriage is again il
legal between Jews and Christians . A third anti-Semitic newspaper,
Giornalissimo, has joined forces with the already existing anti-Jew
ish Regime Fascista and 11 Tevere.
The Vatican's semiofficial organ, L'Osservatore Romano, of Au
gust 13, 1938, in an article headed "The Jews and the Vatican
Council" (1870) speaks of the Catholic Church's PROTECTIVE
measures for Jews, and then goes on to say :
"But - in order to set things straight - by this it was
not intended that Jews should be allowed to abuse the
hospitality of Christian countries. Along with these pro

tective ordinances, there existed restrictive and precau
tionary decrees with regard to them . The civil power
was in accord with the Church in this, since, as Delassus
says, `they both had the same interest in preventing the
nations from being invaded by the Jewish element and
thereby losing control of society .' But if Christians were
forbidden to force Jews to embrace the Catholic religion,
to disturb their synagogues, their Sabbath and their fes
tivals, the Jews, on the other hand, were forbidden to
hold public office, civil or military ; and this prohibition
extended even to the children of converted Jews . The
precautionary decrees concerned the professions, educa
tion, and business positions." 10
