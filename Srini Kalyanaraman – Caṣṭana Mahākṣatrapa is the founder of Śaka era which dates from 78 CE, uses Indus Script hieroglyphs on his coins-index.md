Caṣṭana Mahākṣatrapa is the founder of Śaka era which dates from 78 CE, uses Indus Script hieroglyphs on his coins
--Caṣṭana is described as Ysā(Zā)motikaputra of Kardamaka dynasty on some coins
[quote]Caṣṭana was the founder of the main Western Kshatrapa dynasty, the Kardamaka dynasty, and was in all probability the founder of the Saka era of the year 78 CE. This not only fits with most of the evidence we have, but, most importantly, it seems logical that the Western Kshatrapa kings of the next 200 years who used the Saka era would have used the era of their founding father. We know of inscriptions of Caṣṭana dated as early as years 6 and 11 and as late as year 52. Thus he must have ruled to at least the year 130. He appears to have begun his rule while Nahapana was sill ruling also, but there must have been a geographic separation between their respective kingdoms.Note that Caṣṭana's silver drachms, while basically resembling those of Nahapana, differ in an important respect. The central devices on the reverse of Nahapana's coins were an arrow and a stylized thunderbolt. Caṣṭana's coins, however, feature a crescented three-arched hill, with a sun and moon above. This central device must have been the dynastic symbol of the Kardamaka dynasty and is featured on the coins of all subsequent Kardamaka kings.[unquote]

Rajno Mahakshatrapa Zamotikaputrasa Chastanasa
The name of Caṣṭana's father is normally rendered as Ghsamotika, but I have shown in a paper in the 2009 issue of The Numismatic Chronicle that this is incorrect. First of all the Brahmi letter is not ghsa but ysa. Second, the letter was not meant to be pronounced as written, but to represent the foreign sound z for which Brahmi had no letter. In fact, Rapson had suggested this in his catalog of Western Kshatrapa coins at the British Museum, and I have recently discovered that Pandit Bhagwanlal Indraji had written a paper in the 1890 Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society in which he argued the same point.

A remarkable and so far unique coin, almost certainly of Caṣṭana, in which the title sri appears (at 9 o'clock) prior to where the king's name must be. The style of the coin, the presence of the 6-arched hill, and the letter cha after the sri all point to this being an issue of Caṣṭana. The Satavahana king Gotamiputra Satakarni had been overstriking coins of Nahapana with his
legend gotamiputra siri satakanisa and this may have
suggested the use of the title sri to Caṣṭana. The discovery of the sri was made by Shailen Bhandare. (Photo courtesy Vishal Parikh.)

The rulers of the Western Satraps were called Mahākhatapa (𑀫𑀳𑀸𑀔𑀢𑀧 , "Great Satrap") in their Brahmi script inscriptions, as here in a dedicatory inscription by Prime Minister Ayama in the name of his ruler Nahapana, Manmodi Caves, circa 100 CE. Nahapana was also attributed the titles of Raño ("King") and Sāmi ("Lord") conjointly.(Burgess, Jas (1883). Archaeological Survey Of Western India. p. 103.) Ptolemy in his 2nd century "Geographia" still called them "Indo-Scythians". The word Kṣatrapa has the same origin as the word satrap and are both descended from Median xšaθrapāvan-, which means viceroy or governor of a provincem and according to John Marshall, the word "kṣatrapa" means the viceroy of the "King of kings". The title of the "Mahakṣatrapa" or the "Great Satrap" was given to the ruling Satrap, and the title of "kṣatrapa" was given to the heir apparent. The western Kshatrapas were also known as Sakas to Indians.(Marshall, John (1936). A guide to Sanchi. Patna: Eastern book House. p. 16.) The title "Kṣaharāta" by which the Western Satraps styled themselves is a derivation of an Old Iranian term *xšaθra-pati-, meaning "lord of the country", and was likely the Saka synonym for the Indian title Kṣatrapa.

Janos 1999, Languages and scripts in Graeco-Bactria and the Saka kingdoms in Harmatta, J, BNPuri and GF Etemadi (eds), History of civilizations of Central Asia,volume II, The development of sedentary and nomadic civilizations: 700 BC to AD 250, Motilal Banarsidas, Delhi, p. 400.)
Bhumaka was the father of the great ruler Nahapana (whose rule is variously dated to 24-70 CE, 66-71 CE, or 119–124 CE), according to one of the latter's coins.

Brahmanical religions: Success!! By Ushabadata, the son of Dinaka and the son-in-law of the king, the Kshaharata, the Kshatrapa Nahapana, who gave three hundred thousand cows, who made gifts of gold and a tirtha on the river Banasa, who gave to the Devas and Brahmanas sixteen villages, who at the pure tirtha Prabhasa gave eight wives to the Brahmanas, and who also fed annually a hundred thousand Brahmanas- there has been given the village of Karajika for the support of the ascetics living in the caves at Valuraka without any distinction of sect or origin, for all who would keep the varsha.— Inscription of Nahapana, Karla Caves.
Coin of Nahapana (whose rule is variously dated to 24-70 CE, 66-71 CE, or 119–124 CE), a direct derivation from Indo-Greek coinage. British Museum. (Alpers, Edward A.; Goswami, Chhaya (2019). Transregional Trade and Traders: Situating Gujarat in the Indian Ocean from Early Times to 1900. Oxford University Press. p. 99.)
The Greco-Prakrit title "RANNIO KSAHARATA" ("ΡΑΝΝΙω ΞΑΗΑΡΑΤΑ(Σ)", Prakrit for "King Kshaharata" rendered in corrupted Greek letters) on the obverse of the coinage of Nahapana.(Cribb, Joe (2013). Indian Ocean In Antiquity. Routledge. p. 310; Alpers, Edward A.; Goswami, Chhaya (2019). Transregional Trade and Traders: Situating Gujarat in the Indian Ocean from Early Times to 1900. Oxford University Press. p. 99. ) It is thought that Nahapana ruled at least 35 years in the region of Karla, Junnar and Nasik, giving him ample time for construction works there. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Satraps
