# Index for The Thirteenth Stone – R. Lewis Freemantle.pdf

The Thirteenth Stone is surely one of the most extraordinary and radical
books ever published. In one explosive 600-page volume the author has
completely rewritten the history of religion and gone far towards
uncovering
the ancient mysteries — all of this springing out of a ground-breaking
decipherment of the enigmatic Dead Sea Scrolls. Lewis makes the bold
claim to have:
♦ Shown the Bible to be a pagan book of the occult
♦ Uncovered the mystery of the Holy Grail
♦ Recovered the lost secrets of Freemasonry and the Knights Templar
♦ Found the key to many of the prophecies of Nostradamus
♦ Discerned a common thread in ancient myths from around the world
♦ Laid bare the substance behind the alchemical concept of the
transmutation of base metals into gold
♦ Discovered the true meaning and purpose of the Great Pyramid
In doing so he has uncovered a real historical conspiracy that will shock
even the most ardent of conspiracy theorists.
Having covered the past almost completely, Lewis points to an
extraordinary future for mankind. All the ancient secrets, he says,
foreshadow the imminent arrival of an entirely new species of human being
and a golden age on earth.
Apart from demolishing many other sacred cows, the author exposes the
major religions of the world as being utterly bankrupt.

Introduction
It has long been suspected by many investigators that the world's major
religions have a common root. They have argued that, unlikely as it may
seem, many thousands of years ago the various tribes and nations of the
earth were philosophically and religiously of one mind. The object of this
book is to investigate these claims and their implications. Logically, if we
are the sum total of all that has gone before, it would follow that a change
in our perception of the past will surely alter our view of the present and
the future.
Some believe that in those earliest times the world experienced a Golden
Age, from which there has been a steady decline. My proposal is that this
deterioration results from evolutionary pressure being applied by the
universal Mind — God. It appears also that, before mankind can overcome
evil and be 'like unto the gods', we must experience darkness at first hand.
Hindu, Greek and Celtic traditions, among others, promote this idea. The
Hindus call the Golden Age the (white) Krita Yuga, in which time of 4800
heavenly years mankind lived in divine perfection as innocents. This was
followed by the (red) Treta Yuga, a period of lesser perfection which lasted
for 3600 heavenly years. Then followed the (yellow) Dwapara Yuga of
2400 heavenly years, during which the rot set in. There finally came the
present (black) iron age, called the Kali Yuga, which it is said will last for
1200 heavenly years. This time of greatest darkness would also be that of
mankind's furthest separation from heaven.
The Greek Hesiod, in Works and Days, presents a similar schema,
beginning with a Golden Age and ending in a black era of iron. Likewise
the Celts had the (white) age of Partholon followed by the (red) age of
Nemed and the (yellow) age of the Tuatha de Danann, the culmination
being the (black) iron period of Mile.
It would seem that as man sank deeper and deeper into matter he brought
the gods down with him. Physical and subsequently materialistic mankind
required material gods — gods made flesh. Accordingly, I shall seriously
question the historicity of religious identities such as Jesus, Buddha and
Indra, who I see as springing up all over the world to fulfil the need for
personal and tangible deities. Curiously enough, in the teachings accredited
to these



2 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
characters, the emphasis seems to be upon an unknowable God
hidden deep within the forces of nature. As though to condemn the
idolater at source, the biblical Psalm 51 reads, at verses 16-17:*
For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in
burnt offerings.
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O
God, thou wilt not despise.
The traditional object of religion has been to make a virtue of
taking the impossible, the implausible and the downright ridiculous
and declaring them to be the miraculous. God and religion cannot
and do not coexist; they are indeed mutually exclusive. Though it
cannot be avoided in some degree, it is not within the scope of this
book to debate the nature of the Creator. What I believe will become
clear is that by closely examining religion in general we do get a
better idea of what the Supreme Being is not. Religion, as a
franchised dispenser of personal idols, is but a symptom of man's
descent from the garden of spiritual knowledge. It will become
apparent from the evidence that the ancient shamans of that more
spiritual time preceding our age of iron, being able to fully anticipate
the nature of the forces that would be working upon us, actively
manufactured what we call history. They created literature such as
Scripture, giving it a surface text which historically and materially is
nonsense, yet which has hidden and preserved deep within it the
eternal spiritual truths, which only the enlightened and initiated
would understand.
There has certainly been no shortage of alchemists, poets and
cabalists who claimed a deeper understanding, not only of the Bible
but of ancient writings from around the globe. And, as though in
confirmation of all this, we find that the main character of the Dead
Sea Scrolls is a teacher who will appear in the Last Days and 'reveal
all the mysteries of Scripture'. But, anacronistically, nothing has sunk
deeper into inert matter than academia, and they will have nothing of
this heretical thinking.
It may be argued that such views could only be held by someone
who cannot distinguish between history and myth. Yet may not this
very insistence upon material evidence and scientific proof be
indicative of our fall into matter? There can be no question that the
* Biblical quotations are taken from the Authorized Version, except where
otherwise indicated.



INTRODUCTION 3
masculine, material left-brain world is a real one, but it is only fifty per
cent of the whole. The feminine, intuitive, poetic, right side deals with an
equally powerful and essential aspect of reality. If masculine science alone
has a grasp of the 'real world', perhaps it can explain why we must live with
the consequences of its atomic bomb and the massive environmental
problems resulting from its gifts to mankind. If you doubt the reality of the
feminine unconscious, think of the nightmares and the insanity that result
from denying her expression. Is it not plausible that our present-day ills are
the direct result of our denying expression to the secret self?
Although we are seeing and participating in every detail of the threats
and dire prognostications of the prophets of old, and are becoming
increasingly aware that 'that dark and dreadful day' is almost upon us, the
fuller picture tells a different story. Certainly, the contents of this book
confront and confound the doomsayers, but we need to know from whence
we have come if we are to understand where we are going. The route taken
and the destination at which the world will one day arrive are
predetermined, and we are each of us free to decide if we will risk the
journey or be left behind. God is no respecter of persons, and a tomorrow
plus or minus you or me will make not one scrap of difference to the out
come of the word that was spoken in the beginning. Truth of the harsh and
uncompromising variety is our only salvation.
Were I asked to briefly summarise the contents of this book I would say
that the evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of the idea that the growing
darkness is a means by which mankind is being and will be pressured into
achieving the final step in its evolution. By bringing the world to a point of
unutterable crisis, God is using the Dark to sharpen the Light, the purpose
being to create an entirely new and much more sophisticated species of
humanity through catastrophic evolution.
I propose that, throughout our evolutionary climb, on each occasion a
higher life form has appeared within a matter of one or two generations as a
result of pressure created by catastrophe. There may well have been gradual
refinements subsequently — until, yet again, catastrophe pushed us up the
next step of the ladder. I believe that this development has not in any way
been random, that it has been driven by intelligence — God
progressively manifesting in our time and space. The last step in our
evolution seems to have occurred about forty thousand years ago and to
have completed our physical make-up; all that now remains is our



4 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
spiritualization — the awakening of the feminine. I see this occur
ring over the next fifty years or so as a result of massive catastrophe
which has been engineered by God. But these new creatures will not
be the first. In the prehistoric period exceptional men and women
foreshadowed this leap of consciousness. They developed sciences
such as mathematics and astronomy and they became shepherds to
the human race. They also claimed the ability to transcend time and
foresee the future. But they were exceptions who are now destined
to become the rule.
It is my conviction that writings such as Scripture are not pri
marily historical, but that the story they tell is prophetic of evol
utionary events that are about to occur. In the case of the Bible, this
more highly evolved species is called 'Israel' or 'the Jews', which
terms have absolutely nothing to do with the religionists known by
those titles. I propose that these biblical names prophetically
describe a new species of humanity which I refer to as Homo novus.
Accordingly, we find the biblical Creator instructing Israel not to
breed with, but to annihilate and utterly destroy, the Gentiles
those lacking this higher spirituality. It will also be shown that pretty
well all the ancient myths and traditions from around the globe
conform to this same story. If it is of any comfort to you, I wish I
were wrong; but I doubt it very much.
Most books are produced for the purpose of buying and selling,
but this one is strictly for writing and reading. It is neither nice nor
comforting; it is offered without scruple and without apology. It has
absolutely no sex appeal, is devoid of instant gratification, offers no
quick-fix solutions and doesn't care if you love it or hate it. It was a
hell of a book to write and it will probably be a devil of a book to
read. The feedback from readers of the first edition suggests that the
easiest way to get through it is just to read it in small measures and
allow the unconscious and intuitive to do the work of deciding the
plausibility of the theories and ideas expounded. It has been written
in plain English by an ordinary man and is aimed at the broadest
possible audience. I have absolutely no hidden agenda. With open
hands and open heart I simply and unconditionally offer you all I
have found in my search for truth, and invite you to join me in an
exciting journey back to the future.

Book I



1 The Chemical Wedding
Ever since the time of the fabled King Arthur, brave young knights have set
out upon the Grail Quest, committing themselves by oath to search until
this most secret and sacred of relics was found. Since that time men have
devoted themselves to solving this enigmatic mystery.
I am neither young nor brave, and my armour is more than a little rusty.
Neither did I ever make a commitment to a Grail Quest. How could I? I
knew nothing of the Grail at the time. Besides, my own preoccupation was
and is much more sedentary. Brave young knights must endure great
physical hardship as they roam from one town to another slaying dragons
and rescuing beautiful princesses. In my own case, my saddle was a
wooden chair and my horse a table, likewise of wood. My obsession was
unromantic; there is no Grail knight to be found here.
The ancient myths and religions, particularly a body of writings known
as the Dead Sea Scrolls, were my fascination. In these caves I slayed no
dragons. As for rescuing beautiful princesses, well... I am still waiting for
one who will rescue me, shut up in my tower.
How is it possible, in this most coldly scientific age, for a man to stand
up and make the most romantic and poetic of claims? 'Fellow knights,
blessed be He, I hold the sacred cup of the Grail, the Philosopher's Stone.'
Once upon a time science and poetry were one, joined together in the
chemical wedding, thinking as one. Now they are divorced and living apart.
If it is no longer possible for one to speak for the other, how can I talk to
you of poetic realities?
There is much in the world that science alone cannot explain. And it is
solely because of the poets' demise that our world now hangs on the edge of
the abyss.
I say this knowing I can demonstrate my point. I will show you that a
poetic truth can shatter reality. My story is one in which everything you
have believed to be true of the past will be shown to be false. All that you
may have imagined of the future will prove to be fantasy. Whatever you
were taught at school as history, I will show you it is nonsense. But before
we mount and depart upon our quest, look to yourself. Are you someone
who deals only



8 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
in matters of consequence? Are you even a little filled with a sense of your
own importance? Ask yourself: do you want to conquer heaven or earth?
If it is earthly treasure you seek, then throw this book away. Perhaps
your retailer will take pity on you and give you a refund. I certainly could
not have you as my Grail companion. The territory is dangerous, and
hideous monsters await the unwary. This quest is only for the bravest of
souls, only for those whose hearts are pledged to Ariadne, the Queen of
Heaven, with whom you must drink the cup. Helenion is the most potent of
drinks; it kills more men than it nourishes, and I would not that your blood
were upon my hands.
But if you hold in your hand a book of verse, come, mount up. You and I
shall see adventure you cannot imagine: becoming drunken with wine at
wayside taverns; sleeping in the corn fields at night with only a white stone
for a pillow and the stars for a blanket; doing good deeds, righting wrongs
and feeding the poor. And then, together, we shall drink from the holy
challis, blessing and thanking God for this cup and its revelation of things
hidden from mortal men.
Our first port of call will be some caves on the edge of the Dead Sea in
Judea. There, hidden among some ancient scrolls, we shall find the keys to
the castle of the Fisher King. It is here in these caves that we must meet
with the beast of untruth. Here, by casting a stone, we shall slay the idol of
the Philistines.
But let me now set aside romantic allegory for, as I have intimated, this
is a real quest for a very real Grail.
One must imagine that the struggle to prevent or delay the publication of
material found in the Dead Sea caves has come about largely because
Israeli and Christian authorities have suspected that sooner or later the truth
would become apparent. But that they or I, or in fact anyone, could have
imagined the scope of the changes to be brought about by the discovery in
1947 of ancient gnostic Christian documents is out of the question.
It is well known that the scientific world often behaves in a manner
unbecoming to it. It is not uncommon to find otherwise respected scholars
behaving selfishly to ensure themselves their share of glory, perhaps even a
mention in the history books. This, in the field of archaeology, has often
caused delays because of unseemly backbiting and infighting. But these
circumstances cannot generally be said to apply to the Scrolls saga.



THE CHEMICAL WEDDING 9
Basically, from the beginning, the Jordanian Government handed over
responsibility for the Scrolls to what was supposed to be an international
team of scholars. As matters transpired, it was not international, and some
of its members lacked the necessary skills, which were available elsewhere.
It seems to have been hijacked from very early on in the affair by the Ecole
Biblique, a French school of the Dominican Order of Roman Catholic
monks. They forbade access to the finds to anyone outside this elect, and
then proceeded to delay the editing process for as long as possible. Some
individual members were absent from their tasks for extensive periods of
time. Had not these texts been an embarrassment for the Roman Church,
there can be little doubt that the individuals concerned would have been
eager to publish.
In normal circumstances the strategy would have proved effective. With
their lack of action, the documents would ultimately have been forgotten,
particularly in a world where biblical archaeology seems to be of
diminishing interest. But these ancient writings have proved tenacious, and
they have remained in the public eye. Ironically, the antics of this official
body have only served to increase the air of mystery surrounding the finds.
Over the years, as the cloak-and-dagger drama of the Scrolls has
unfolded, the Vatican has been noticeably silent. In recent years the
Government of Israel seems to have leapt unobtrusively into partnership
with Rome to act as a co-defender of the faith. Indeed one scholar who
proved extremely persistent — Robert Eisenman — was told in 1986 that
he would never see the remaining material in his lifetime,1 this by an Israeli
official of the Antiquities Authority. I suspect these actions to have been
against the perceived threat of documents which, as we shall see, alter
everything from received religious wisdom to our concept of history. It is,
in fact, hard to imagine how a greater change could be wrought.
There can now be little doubt that the implications of these texts will
eventually force us to completely abandon Christianity and modern
Judaism. Our picture of ancient history is also shown by the Scrolls to be
false, and it too must eventually go. Even the modern land of Israel and the
people we call the Jews seem to have been formed in the shadow of a myth.
As for me, I can only liken myself to that young Arab shepherd who
unwittingly cast a stone and opened a door to the past. Whether it be I or
someone else coming to the conclusions which have been reached in this
book is irrelevant. Either way the results must be the same.



10 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
It may well be that you find yourself offended by what I have found. I
suggest, in this case, that it would be pointless to direct your anger at me.
You would do far better to contemplate the reality with which you have
just collided. The fact is that you are the victim of a battle for power and
territory. Not only the academic world, but society as a whole, has had a
longstanding investment in what you believe.
From the fortresses of academia to the ivory towers of religion, it is well
known to those ensconced within that there is an ocean of difference
between what they know and what we accept as truth. They actually stand
to gain from the friction generated by the diversity of our beliefs. There is
no sense in complaining: you would have done the same in their shoes.
And in case I should mislead you, do not look to me to champion any
cause. I do not distinguish between victor and vanquished. I see only
mankind's futile struggle with reality.
Moreover, it is quite clear that the Bible stories we have understood in
religious terms were in fact descriptions of an anticipated development in
human evolution: the concluding step in humankind's climb to the top of
the tree of life, the spiritualization of the beast.
It will become clear that pre-Christian man understood these things. Our
conception of him as a comparatively primitive creature has only served to
blind us to the obvious. I am satisfied that the evidence herein shows us
that it is we who, having closed our ears to the poetic expression of truth,
have completely misread the directions left to us for our progress on the
path of life. The cosmos as a mechanism of infinite proportions is
constantly moving its location at an alarming rate. In this sense everything
is true but nothing is totally real. Truth is relative to time. To our
antediluvian predecessors, the male and female represented so much more
than simply the physical tools of procreation. They in fact perceived man
and woman as the embodiment of the cosmic forces that shaped them. They
were, in the poetic sense, the gods made flesh, the means by which those
forces were able to come together in our dimension of time and space.
The environment in which Christianity was spawned was one of great
upheaval and change. But it was also a time of priests who prophesied and
cosmic forces that were ever present. By this I do not refer to primitive
superstition. On the contrary, it seems our prehistoric ancestor was far more
sophisticated than we have been



THE CHEMICAL WEDDING 11
led to believe. I speak of what we might term 'the feminine', which in that
time was very much alive and gave us a totally different attitude to life, a
perception diametrically opposed to that of today. It was an era in which
the actual essence of life was totally different to what we know at present.
Not only has there been a divorcing of those two forces, the means of
communication between solar intellect and lunar intuition are now lost to
us. This makes my task a particularly difficult one. How can one transmit
single-minded concepts in a double-minded world? Should I write a poetic
and symbolic epic which touches directly upon your unconscious, or
should I explain things in coldly scientific terms? Either way I would fail in
my task, the required language of the Grail knight having long since been
lost.
There is nothing more damnable than compromise, for as often as not it
embodies the worst of both worlds. Be that as it may, I have seen my task
here as the turning of a key that unlocks every room in the house; how you
furnish it is entirely your own affair. If it does not please you, then you
must go back and continue your residence with the beasts.
Were we able to transport him in time, the ancient shaman who busied
himself with cosmology would have seen our civilization as a logical
progression from the foundation of the Roman empire, which coincided
with the dawn of the Piscean Age. He would tell us that, because of the
watery nature of the stars of Pisces, the feminine spirit was due to be
dominated and subdued by the sun. Imperial, militaristic, commercial Rome
was the embryo of a period in which men would put their entire faith in the
material. He would also have told us that this era would come, show its face
as an aspect of the cosmos, and then pass away without a trace.
Most of our discussion centres around the massive change and upheaval
that took place some two thousand years ago. It was a time when the
universe changed gear, an era of new consciousness, an age in which the
children of earth would be abandoned by the gods and left to their own
resources.
That cosmic gear change is now upon us again: we are at the dawn of the
Age of Aquarius. If this book is to have any sort of dedication, it is to these
new children that I humbly devote it.
To those of you who only see desolation and decay, I propose that you
look again, for I see nothing but hope. It may well be that we must
experience the pain of abandoning the old, but we have before us the dawn
of the new. Because the old gods were false, we



12 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
have come to think of ourselves as being alone. But now is the time
for old men to dream dreams and for children to prophesy. We live
at the dawn of the coming of the New Jerusalem, when the Living
God will govern the earth, a time when man to man shall brother be.
The arguments I shall be setting out are not, in themselves, par
ticularly complex but they do present a conceptual problem. First of
all they fly in the face of much of what is commonly accepted
history. Secondly, their scope is so vast as to boggle the imagination.
Nevertheless a little tenacity will bring a rich reward. I list below
some of the basic arguments.
1. Christ and Jesus are two entirely separate entities.
2. Christ was a purely spirit essence which, previous to the creation
of the Jesus myth, was feminine. She was known as the Queen of
Heaven, often the Triple-Headed Goddess.
3. Historically speaking Jesus the man never existed; he is a myth.
4. The two central figures of the Dead Sea Scrolls — the Star/
Revealer of Mysteries/Righteousness Teacher and the Sceptre/
King of Israel — may be identified with certainty with what is in
fact the two Jesuses of the New Testament. The Sceptre/King is
the Jesus of Matthew, the Star/Teacher is the Jesus of Luke.
5. The entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, is historically speaking
pure myth. Even Genesis (the first book) could not have been
written much earlier than about 200 BCE.*
6. Many of the characters of the Old Testament represent aspects of
the Star and Sceptre of the Scrolls. Adam, Noah, Moses, Samson,
King David and others are myths built upon the Star/Teacher.
Joshua represents the Sceptre/King, and King Solomon and the
apostle Paul are respectively the Wicked Priest and the Liar of the
Scrolls. Even John the Baptist makes his appearance in the Old
Testament as Jonathan, the much beloved friend of King David.
7. The ancient world, as is generally known, was governed by
astronomer priests. Their sciences and their power centred upon a
device which we know in myth as the cosmic tree or Ark of the
Covenant. They claimed that with this device they could enter the
land of the dead (the Underworld) and see the future.
*BCE = before the common era, replacing the older BC; likewise CE replaces AD.



THE CHEMICAL WEDDING 13
8 These ancient magi had spent many thousands of years accumulating
their vast body of sacred knowledge. Long ago their power had been
absolute, but it declined. By the time we reach the dawn of the Piscean
Age (two thousand years ago), they had become a remnant (of Israel)
who were now rapidly becoming a persecuted minority. This was all
part of the progress of cosmic forces in the process of creation.
9. In accord with the will of God, their knowledge was not to be totally
lost. After the time in Pisces we would enter Aquarius, an era when
mankind would return to the old ways. It would be the dawn of another
Golden Age. The children of Aquarius should not have to start all over
again. The priests needed to find a way of conveying their sacred
sciences across the Piscean era (a dark time) to their spiritual children.
One of the major vehicles chosen for this task was the Bible. Much of
general mythology also serves this purpose.
10. Buried within the text of the Bible, using numerology and ciphers, is all
the ancient wisdom of the priests. This hidden gnosis became the
foundation of Templar, Masonic and Rosi-crucian philosophies. The
surface text was produced as the foundation for Judaism and
Christianity. This text was written as history but designed to appeal
especially to the people of the Piscean era, who in a materialistic, male
dominated age would seek material gods.
11. At the dawn of the Aquarian Age God would send a Revealer of
Mysteries whose task it would be to uncover that which had been
hidden. He would die, but would in the process of revelation gather the
New Israel around him. These real Jews would not be an ethnic group or
race: it would comprise the spiritually evolved people of all races. They
would raise up from among them a king from the House of David, that
being a mage (David is a version of the Star/Teacher, the first of these
new magi). He would lead Israel in the war of the apocalypse and then
would govern the world in peace and justice in the Golden Age.
12. The Star and Sceptre of the Scrolls are not historical. In theory, they live
now. As legendary figures representing these two men, Adam, Noah,
Moses, Joshua, David and Jesus did not live in the past but live in the
present. The Bible is purely prophecy.
13. In creating the Jesus myth, the priests manufactured an image. This idol
Jesus is also Dagon of the Old Testament. He is one



14 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
and the same as Jehovah, the violent and insane creator who tossed
Adam and Eve out of the garden because they wanted to eat from the
cosmic tree. This Jesus/Jehovah idol is, in Revelation, given the mark
of the beast (666), and the idol's worshippers are, in Scripture, termed
the Philistines.
14. Having argued that the Bible does not contain a scrap of history, I shall
be forced to ask whence came the Jews and modern Israel. I shall show
that the authors of the Scrolls not only created Christianity but also
established Judaism, for which they provided the Talmud. This, more
than anything, shaped the political destiny of these people.
15. The Roman dispersion of the Israelites from Palestine in 70 CE was
engineered by the priests. A hotch-potch of adherents to Judaism had to
be scattered abroad, where, with the Talmud to guide them, they would
become an isolated nation within nations holding fast to a doctrine of
racial superiority and elitism.
16. These first sectarians initially settled in North Africa and eventually in
Spain. Ultimately they became far too interested in the pursuit of art and
culture to have any real interest in being the chosen of God. The large
majority intermarried with indigenous populations, and today they exist
largely in token.
17. In about 740 CE an admix of tribes known collectively as the Khazars,
living in the area of the Caspian Sea, converted to Judaism en masse for
strictly political reasons. They were eventually dispersed by conquest
and, forgetting their real origins, are now scattered throughout the
world, believing themselves to be the descendants of an historical Israel.
18. The Khazars were primarily merchants, tentmakers and jewellers. They
were a relatively primitive people living in a hostile landscape. These
and other environmental pressures made them an aggressive and
rapacious entity which has thrived within the modern economic system
of the West.
19. Through usury — a trick they learned from the Gentiles — they now
have massive financial power. In itself this is irrelevant. But Scripture
says that the Antichrist will rise up from among them and be declared
the Messiah of modern Israel. Alas, Scripture also says that none shall
buy or sell without the mark of the beast.
20. In their march from humble moneylender to respected international
banker, the Khazar Jews have fomented numerous wars, from which
they have derived immense profit.



THE CHEMICAL WEDDING 15
21. There has been growing suspicion that the Holocaust is a vast
exaggeration. I shall provide conclusive evidence to show that it is a
fraud, and a means by which the modern state of Israel was acquired, in
fulfilment of dark prophecy.
The Grail is the stone of destiny; it holds within it the power to change
the direction of the world. It will be, to many, a rock of offence and a cause
of stumbling. To others it will prove a solid foundation upon which to build
a house of truthfulness. The Grail cup holds within it the blood of Sophia,
the menses of wisdom. These are sweetness in the mouth and bitterness in
the belly. This menstrual wine is tasted by the soul. To the spirit of
perversity it is bitter anguish. To the spirit of understanding it is honeyed
mead. It is tasted only by the human soul because the menstrual wine of
Sophia is the spiritual blood and body of Christ, the essence that long ago
found its habitation in trees. The ancient shamanic priests knew her and
where she might be found; they often entered her and passed through her.
Thus the historian Pliny the Elder, when speaking of the Essenes, tells us
that they far preferred the company of trees (socia palmarum) to the
companionship of women (Natural History, 5:17).
Much earlier, in ancient Egypt, the spiritual ancestors of this warrior
priesthood knew her as the Triple-Headed Goddess. She was man's mother,
his wife and his whore, and finally the hag that threw dirt upon him and
buried him. In this final form she was the earth itself, which became the
Spider Goddess who consumed her mate after coitus.
Likewise, in Islam she was known as Fatima, the Red Moon Cow and the
Tree of Paradise. Accordingly, Mecca became the womb of the earth. Men
proclaimed her the Virgin Pairidaeza, who would give birth to the Desired
Knight, a messenger from God.
Others said she was Mary Magda-Lene, the apostle unto the apostles. She
is the sophistical stone seeded by Mercury, the Vas Hermeticum in which is
planted the filius philosophorum. She is so many things to so many men
because, above all, she is Mind above creating mind below, Mind within us
creating the world around us.
Conclusion
I am far from being the first to say that there has been a Dead Sea Scrolls
conspiracy. In fact, within the world of biblical archaeology 'conspiracy'
and 'cover-up' have been synonymous with the Qumran Scrolls. But why



16 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
should this be? On the face of it, this is not in the interest of academia. The question
can be answered by asking who stands to gain and who to lose. It will be seen that
even the Scrolls material that was published within a few years of their discovery
provides basic keys that facilitate a better understanding of biblical myth and
history. This is the sole reason for that cover-up.
In fact much of the material dealt with in this book has been, from time to time,
the subject of international conspiracy theories. It will become clear that, if such
dastardly plots can be given any credence, the sole conspirator is God.
In this section I have been unable to do much more than expand just a little on
the statements made in the introduction. Fundamentally, we shall see that the
ancient world held to highly sophisticated philosophies in which the Goddess — the
feminine within us all — played a very significant role. I postulate that none of the
ancient wisdom was lost: it went underground. And that underground is the Bible.
There is a mystery here which deepens as the story unravels. It pertains to how,
when the evidence was so profuse and so obvious, we could have been blind to it for
so long. For example, it is well known that the Hebrew 'Mariam' (Mary) means 'sea',
poetically the watery womb of the great Earth Mother. It is equally well known that
many of the New Testament stories depict Jesus and the disciples as having an
involvement with the sea. Furthermore it is common knowledge that the early
Christians identified themselves to one another by wearing the symbol of a fish.
What is more, Nazareth, Nazarene and Nazorean (a term applied to the Essenes) are
clearly derived from 'nazri', 'a shoal of fishes', whose home is the watery deep of the
universal unconscious. It is therefore not without reason that the historian Josephus
tells us that the sign Pisces (the fishes) is of very special significance to the Jews.
Yet again, Mary's ancient namesake in central South America was Mayahuel,
who had four hundred breasts at which she suckled a fish. It seems to me that, this
being only one of countless thousands of similar connections that the Bible has with
myths from throughout the world, this miscellany of mixed mythological metaphors
should have been subjected to scrutiny a long time ago. But it wasn't. Why?

The Tree, the Boat and the Fisher's Net
For countless generations the Bible has been regarded as an historical
document. The Old Testament is indeed one of the very few resources upon
which we have built our knowledge of the ancient world. Its loss would
leave us virtually having to start all over again. But the fact is that in recent
years the historical edifice of Scripture has begun to crumble.
Professor Thomas Thompson, formerly of Marquette University,
Milwaukee, is one of the world's foremost authorities on biblical
archaeology. In 1992 he published Early History of the Israelite People,2
being the conclusions of a fifteen-year study. It was as a direct result of this
publication that he was sacked by the University.
Professor Thompson says there is a complete absence of archaeological
evidence supporting many of the events portrayed in the Old Testament. He
argues that there was no captivity in Egypt, no Exodus and no conquest of
the Promised Land under Joshua; indeed there was no settled community in
Jerusalem and Judea until about the ninth century BCE. This community
could not have formed and established a kingdom till somewhat later.
Excavations have found no evidence of settlement in the area for the period
around 1000 BCE, the supposed time of King David. He also finds that there
is no evidence of the existence of the first Temple, which is accredited to
Solomon. Thus the central theme of Scripture, the King Messiah from the
house of David, is totally undermined. Without David there can be no
Jesus.
Jerusalem was, in the fifth century BCE, an insignificant part of the
Persian empire. Professor Thompson suggests that the Israelite people were
created as a nation by the Persians in about 450 BCE. AS is well known, the
Persians were led by magi; we shall in due course see that it was most
likely they who created what has been believed to be Israel. Thompson
goes on to say there is no link between the Persian settlement and the
biblical Babylonian captivity of Israel in 586 BCE. He suggests that the
population was made up of Judean tribesmen, Philistines, Syrians and
Phoenicians. His conclusion is that the first ten books of the Bible are
fiction.
A discovery such as this does not simply have historical significance; it
also has considerable impact on the present and future.



18 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
To conclude that parts of the Bible are fiction and simply leave it at that is
to undervalue the impact of the Old Testament in our age. To
underestimate the potency of Scripture is to ignore the genius of its authors.
I intend, in this book, to prove that all sixty-six books of the Bible are pure
fiction from an historical point of view. This being so, we must ask why
Scripture was written, and with what intent?
The answer is to be found by investigating the religious beliefs of the
Persian magi, who were primarily cabalists, an ancient form of mysticism
and belief in magic. It was they who made of astronomy, numerology and
other related poetic sciences the foundation of modern mysticism. Their
knowledge was both sacred and secret. It has come down to us in myth,
legend and presumed history.
The many disciplines that have evolved in the last eighty years or so
which are directly concerned with the Bible and its history, though
supposedly scientific, were at the outset primarily driven by piety. Not only
the early archaeologists but many recent scholars have essentially set out
with the desire to confirm Scripture.
With the Bible — up to a point in time — being taken at its word, we
have generally understood the civilizations surrounding Palestine far better
than those of the Bible lands themselves. In Palestinian archaeology, and
the numerous related disciplines that have since evolved, not only did
scholars set out specifically to confirm Scripture, as often as not they were
both educated and financed by organizations that had a vested interest in
the work. Biblical sites were repeatedly said to have been discovered, and
history — often with a leap of faith — was confirmed.
But at this point the pious were already looking over their shoulders. The
discoveries that unearthed the Sumerian civilization should have given
substantial verification to Scripture, but instead they revealed the Genesis
creation epic and a number of biblical characters to be unoriginal and
mythological. Quite clearly they had either been borrowed or survived in an
oral tradition. The uncovering of the Sumerian civilization was, in many
respects, the beginning of the end for the Bible as history.
Time and again we see that the archaeology has been made to fit the
biblical record, a chance fit being greeted by a public celebration which
ignored the failures. In short, we have had to accept a jury chosen to bring
down a specific verdict. Furthermore, the quality of the disciplines and the
competence of the workers in the field have been consistently exaggerated.
As is common, even today, these prominent scholars hide behind a
mystique and use language



THE TREE, THE BOAT AND THE FISHER'S NET 19
comprehensible only among themselves. This I regard as arrogant
exclusivism, which is often used to disguise individual and collective
incompetence. The list of scholars who have attempted to speak out and
who have subsequently suffered is very long.
Professor Thompson's discoveries and declaration come only as
confirmation of much that had long been suspected. As witness to this
conspiracy of silence, my own efforts to obtain a copy of his book, shortly
after it was published, were long and painful. Ultimately I was obliged to
pay about six times the going rate for a book of this type. But the guilty
parties in these situations — which are not restricted to academia but
spread throughout the social structure — are the public, who do not
exercise their right to access information that is supposedly collected on
their behalf. The news media, also, have much to answer for, insofar as
they have ceased to be collectors and distributors of this relevant data and
to act as public watchdogs. When major components of a society cease to
function, that society has no future; it can only collapse. A nonfunctioning
body, even though it may be temporarily enjoying its comatose state, must
die. That there have always been Thompsons in this world in one form or
another does afford hope, but the price these people pay is often very high.
That cost is always set by you, the public. But then, nothing exacts a higher
price than inertia and indifference. The world is presently going through
extraordinary change; if you are to survive it you need to be informed. In
this regard the media are useless.
Thompson's discoveries were, for me, a very timely support for my own
conclusions, even though his publication arrived just as I had come to the
end of preparing the first edition of this book. Accordingly, a brief outline
of the traditional scriptural view of the history of the Temple in Jerusalem
will serve us well at this point. But let me emphasize that I regard it as pure
myth.
According to Scripture — and there is no external support — King
Solomon lived around 1000 BCE. II Chronicles 3: 1 tells us that he built the
Temple on Mount Moriah (Temple Mount), the site having been the
threshing-floor of Oman (Araunah), the Jebusite prince. Moriah and Mary
have a common root, and we shall see that Mary in the New Testament is
the Triple-Headed Goddess. Further, a threshing-floor is a place for
threshing wheat, and I shall show that in Scripture this is symbolic of
wisdom. The Temple was supposedly built to house the Ark of the
Covenant, which contained the two stone tablets of the law. These, we shall
see, are



20 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
the constellation Coma and the sun. Very similar temples to that of
Solomon, as it is described in Scripture, have been found at Hazor,
Megiddo and Tel Tainat.
Having been completed in about 950 BCE (I Kings 6: 38), Solomon's
Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586. At this point the people
go into what is known as the Babylonian captivity. They return about half a
century later and build the second Temple (Ezra 1: 1-4 and 2: 64-69). But
Thompson says that even at this late date there is no sign of settled
occupation in that area. In the biblical account the second Temple was built
by Zerubbabel. It was extremely modest — see Haggai 2: 3 and Ezra 3:12,
where it is reported that many wept while others shouted for joy. It is
notable that we have, in the building process, another mythic Joshua/Jesus
in the reign of Zerubbabel. This theme of a Moses-type builder and Joshua
type king will repeat itself time and again. Here the mythic elements
become extremely interesting, because this Temple was without the Ark of
the Covenant. In its place there was a set of flagstones, which would have
been part of the altar. In 168 BCE Antiochus Epiphanes, the Syrian King,
forced the sacrifice of a pig at the altar. It was this act that brought about
the revolt and rise of the Maccabees (Hasmoneans). The Temple was later
cleansed and rededicated. In I Maccabees 4: 45-46 we read of the altar
stones being replaced and the old stone kept,
until there should come a prophet to give an answer concerning them.
This statement, we shall shortly see, is extremely relevant to our story.
The fundamental principle is that a prophet uncovers a rejected stone and
brings a new revelation.
King Herod began work on the final Temple around 20-19 BCE. It was
probably completed only a few years before the Romans destroyed it. It
now seems likely that, from the time of their arrival in Palestine, the magi
may have built a small temple which was gradually expanded until that
same and only Temple was destroyed in 70 CE.
The present Muslim mosque that stands on Temple Mount is called the
Dome of the Rock. The concept that Mount Moriah is some sort of
epicentre or symbolic womb is prevalent throughout scriptural and non
scriptural sources: Jerusalem seems somehow to symbolize the womb of
the world.



THE TREE, THE BOAT AND THE FISHER'S NET 21
In his dissertation Quad Deterius Potiori Insidiari Soleat (That the Worse
is Wont to Attack the Better) (XXXI), Philo refers to Deuteronomy 32: 13,
where there are two rocks (stones); one (feminine) provides honey and the
other (masculine) provides oil. Philo goes on to say that these are actually
one rock, which is feminine and the source of life and wisdom. Wisdom is,
throughout Scripture, spoken of as feminine; ultimately, in Revelation 21:
2, it becomes the New Jerusalem,
...prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
This previously rejected stone is the sole source of divine knowledge and
of the abandoned bride who is both the Goddess and the thirteenth stone.
This is the rock that raises children unto Abraham and, as the rejected
stone, it is that which Jesus makes the head of the corner. Thus, with
Thompson's unwitting but very welcome support, we shall see that the
pagan and mythic elements of the Bible far outweigh its imagined and
uncorroborated history.
Outside Scripture, Philo's writings offer one of the very few sources
available for the time of the supposed life of Jesus. Philo was a gnostic and
Platonist, and quite clearly also a member of the community of Alexandrian
Essenes. In recent years scholars have noticed a relationship between Philo,
the Epistle to the Hebrews and a number of the Dead Sea texts. A notion
that will crystallize as we progress is that the people who created the
Qumran writings also wrote the Bible, and that sources such as Philo and
Josephus were also produced by these same people, who creatively
provided what we believe is history.
A point I shall constantly repeat, unashamedly and ad nauseam, is that
we are only at the beginning of radical changes to our world. The Bible and
the Dead Sea Scrolls offer us a wealth of understanding of this cyclical
process; we are otherwise alone and without help in this global upheaval.
Our only hope, in this reality of unreality, is to grasp at practical
knowledge. If we are to progress, we must know where we have been
before we can have any inkling as to where we are going. In a world that
has strayed so far from truth and reality, the task is far from easy. As the
one who has written this book I can only extend my sympathy to those who
attempt to read it. But, notwithstanding, the underlying principles °f my
arguments are straightforward, even though the ramifications are shattering.
The simple fact is that Professor Thompson's



22 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
findings open a door for non-specialists, and they free us from a major
misconception. His disclosures are in fact epic in their implications for the
major religions; yet, though it was printed in 1992, his book has to date
been ignored by them. How, it must be asked, can a religious body speak
of God and His truth being enshrined within that body when it ignores even
the truths told to it by lowly mortals? Nature invariably destroys the
structures she cannot change.
In his book (page 403) Thompson makes the point that it is only very
recently that biblical history — the history of Israel — has begun to be
subjected to the same requirements for context and background as are
normally required of other textual sources.
All this may appear academic. I shall press the point much harder as we
progress, so suffice it to say now that, since not long after World War II,
Israel and its neighbours have kept the world sitting on the edge of its seat.
Even today it is developments in that region that are most likely to trigger a
universal nuclear conflagration.
Those events, set in motion when the Bible (history or myth: it doesn't
matter) was launched, are yet to reach their conclusion. Nuclear weapons
do not discriminate between the faithful and the unbelievers, but they are
probably the closest that Jesus freaks will come to experiencing a rapture,
as they are raised up in a cloud of nuclear dust and disappear — forever.
Given this scenario, it should not be imagined for one moment that this
book is concerned with academic frivolity.
Professor Thompson's claim that Moses, Joshua, David and Solomon are
fictions will not come as a surprise to many. His discovery is, nevertheless,
extremely important because it can stem the criticism of the traditionalist
when alternative and more radical approaches are made to what is, after all,
a great enigma. With his demonstration that much of the Old Testament is
not the history it appears to be, investigating Scripture through the science
of myth-ography becomes more respectable. We are now in a position to
make comparisons between biblical myth on the one hand and legend and
tradition in general.
Specific recurring themes in mythology can be tested in Scripture. We
may, for example, examine the possibility that the biblical Rachael and the
Virgin Mary are versions of the Egyptian Isis, the Spider Goddess. Jesus'
concern with trees and stones with magical properties may now be looked
at in relation to the tree of knowledge in Genesis. We may even begin to
make comparisons



THE TREE, THE BOAT AND THE FISHER'S NET 23
between Jesus and Adam, as is done in I Corinthians 15: 45. David may
also attract our attention because of the stone he cast that made him king.
In general mythology there is a common theme as regards a magical tree
which sits upon an all-important stone, the function of which is to hold
back the Great Flood. Thus, like the Spider Queen, we begin to gather the
threads of an immensely complex web.
Plate 1. An Assyrian cylinder seal depicting the
cosmic tree with thirteen stones, the all-seeing eye of Horus
and the part-fish part-man creator Oannes.
In mythology this same stone is one and the same as the Holy Grail.
Wolfram3 tells us it is called 'lapsit exillis'. It being the thirteenth stone, this
phrase contains thirteen letters. It is a word play on 'lapis ex caelis', stone
from heaven, 'lapsit ex caelis', fallen from heaven, and 'lapis elixir', the
Philosopher's Stone.
This allegory is evocative of the story of the Sumerian Gilgamesh, for
whom a star fell from heaven which he was unable to pick up. And this
again has much to do with a sacred tree, one whose fruit is stones. All this
in turn brings to mind a strange statement made by the seer Nostradamus,
who speaks of events which will occur when we have 'the stone in the tree'
(Century 2: 70).
Plate 1 shows the most sacred relique known to man. As mythology it is
spoken of as a great universal tree whose branches reach up to heaven and
whose roots reach into hell. It is the boat of the sun which took Pharaoh
into the land of the dead. It is also sometimes the net cast for the fish that
brings mercurial wisdom. It was in fact a device from which hung a word or
series of musical harmonies which men claimed they could use to call up
the dead, or



24 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
enter a realm where time present, past and future are one — a mechanism
by which it might be possible to see events to come.
It is most commonly found in Hebrew cabalistic literature, in which it
represents the microcosm and macrocosm. It is both a man and the universe
— the universe without and within. The orbs or fruit that hang from it are
known to the cabalist as 'sephiroth'. Traditionally there are ten of these orbs
(chakras) upon the tree. Most important to us are those on the central axis,
which represent sun, earth and moon, Diagram 1 being a standard
diagrammatic form of the cosmic tree of the ancient Semites, of which one
version is illustrated in Plate 1. In this instance, the mythmakers have taken
its general shape as a source by which it may be seen as a tree, a boat and a
fisher's net. Three-dimensionally it is the cube of the New Jerusalem in
Revelation 21.
Diagram 1
All ancient cosmological science centres upon this cosmic device. One
generally finds it with the twelve signs of the zodiac, twelve tribes of Israel
or twelve apostles sitting in various arrangements around the periphery,
some signs being attached to the sephiroth and others to the 'paths' that join
them. My own arrangement may be seen in Diagram 2.



THE TREE, THE BOAT AND THE FISHER'S NET 25
If one is not a devotee of esoterica, these diagrams will appear a little
confusing. Basically, occult philosophy treats of the twelve tribes and
apostles as esoteric symbols for the zodiac and attempts to arrange them
around the tree. The zodiacal signs and the orbs upon it are stones. They
are seed stones in the fruit, and this fruit is itself knowledge (gnosis).
Diagram 2
A twelve-sign zodiac is quite harmless and useless from the shaman's
point of view, his concern being with lunar astronomy. The tree's power
comes in setting a thirteen-sign lunar zodiac around it. It will be seen from
Diagram 3 that the required missing orb which allows this arrangement is in
its throat, below Leo, the head. Hence the sun, earth and moon move up one
orb and leave space for the thirteenth sign in the genitalia of this cosmic
temple. This thirteenth lunar sign is Coma Berenice, which in the zodiac is
the long flowing tresses of Princess Berenice. Essentially, we now have
eleven sephiroth and thirteen zodiacal signs, which are stones. This tree is
the central focus of alchemy; it is the abinjan of creation.



26 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
The word 'coma' in Greek means 'hair'; from it we derive the English
comb'. In its position on the tree it symbolizes genital hair, the tree's
Samson-like power and strength.
All astronomy must by necessity be geocentric; hence, viewed from any
point, the earth is completely surrounded by stars. The sun travels in a great
cycle which it completes in 25,920 years. The stars that sit on its path are
theoretically those upon which the pictures of the twelve major signs of the
zodiac are depicted. With
Diagram 3
one possible exception, mentioned below, none of the star pictures is
suggested by the actual configuration of the heavenly lights as seen from
the earth. The existing signs are purely a matter of esoteric choice. Because
of the importance of these diagrams, I have set the old and new trees side
by side in Diagram 4.
Ancient astronomy not only set pictures on the stars of the ecliptic (the
sun's path), it imposed pictures and legends upon the entire canopy of the
sky. These other secondary signs are called decans; they sit above the major
signs and are allotted to them. There are three to a sign; each sign
comprises 30° of the zodiac, and so the decans divide it into 10° segments.
The best known decan is Crux



THE TREE, THE BOAT AND THE FISHER'S NET 27
Australis, the Southern Cross. This small cluster of stars is really the only
one that suggests the picture it is said to show.
Coma Berenice is in Virgo. It lies to the north of this sign in the heavens,
between Bootes and Leo.
Diagram 4. When an extra sephirah is set in the
throat of the tree, the sun, earth and moon move up
one position and the genital sephirah is vacant.
This sephirah now houses the thirteenth stone.
Ancient astronomy was an extremely secret science, primarily because of
its relationship to the cosmic tree. The manner chosen by the ancients for
transmitting their secrets was to use myths and fairytales. The reader may
appreciate that, though I speak of a scientific device, it is of a feminine and
poetic logic.
The art of the ancient mythmaker was a highly complex one. He did not
see himself as an entertainer: he was concerned, like a secret agent in
wartime, with the transmission of what was, for him, highly classified
information.



28 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
In shaping a myth, his priority was the transmission of technical data.
His object was to reach into the unconscious, to touch the feminine, the
inner man. Here those primary elements would impact upon internal and
universal truths, and thus the legend would receive credence. It was then
that the masculine external would take it and give it form and place in the
world. It was destined to take shape then as believed history and religion.
How do we know that Coma is the thirteenth sign of the zodiac? There
are many sources, but the most obvious and straightforward of them is the
story of the virgin birth in the book of Matthew.
Specifically Christ — not Jesus — was a spirit essence that was seen to
be masculine because Jesus the god of the age was male, this being a
requisite of altered consciousness when the earth entered Pisces. Originally,
Christ took the form of Ariadne, or Ar-achne the Spider Goddess, who
hanged herself from a tree. In Egypt and elsewhere, she was the Triple
Headed Goddess. Primarily, she was Sophia = Wisdom, and in this respect
we shall find we are dealing with internal rather than actual creation.
As we shall see, elements such as the town of Bethlehem and Joseph and
even the manger have astronomical significance. The primary elements
here are that a woman conceives through the Holy Spirit and that she is a
virgin. That she is with child is intended to draw our attention to the
thirteenth lunar sign being in Virgo. Further, this virgin birth theme is
totally unoriginal.
The New Testament story is the perfect myth and has adequately
performed its task. It has reached deep into the soul, and even today
Christian, atheist and scholar alike accept without substantiation that Jesus
was an historical figure. But, from the mythmaker's point of view, the sole
object of the story of the miraculous Bethlehem birth is to tell us that it is to
Virgo in the heavens that we should look for this most important group of
stars.
The brightest star in this sign is in the ear of wheat that she holds in her
left hand — Al Zimack, meaning the branch.4 Its modern Latin name is
Spica. As E. W. Bullinger confirms in Witness of the Stars, there are some
twenty Hebrew words that translate 'branch', only one of them (tsemeck)
being used exclusively for the Messiah, and this word only four times: in
Jeremiah 23: 5, Zechariah 3: 8, Zechariah 6:12 and Isaiah 4: 2.
Jeremiah 33: 15 is a repetition of Jeremiah 23: 5. These terms relate to
the Branch of the house of David, or may be seen to refer to a branch of the
cosmic tree, which is one and the same as the



THE TREE, THE BOAT AND THE FISHER'S NET 29
Qumran Scrolls' Sceptre or Prince of the Congregation. Here we find
reference to Isaiah 11:1, which reads:
And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch
shall grow out of his roots:
Jesse was the Bethlehemite father of King David. These prophetic
sayings are much more easily understood once we know the basic
arrangement of the tree. If we find this device in the Bible then it must have
been written or influenced by shamans of the time. Their great
specialization was astronomy. If my argument can be proved, then the link
between the Egyptian Isis (Au Set, meaning seat/ womb of stone) and the
Virgin Mary is certain.
In prehistoric zodiacs going back some four thousand years, the sign
Coma appeared as a seated maiden nursing a child.5 Bullinger says that the
Hebrew name for this constellation was 'Coma' = 'desired'. Perhaps our
English word 'come' is related. Ultimately the corresponding Greek 'co-me',
meaning 'hair', transferred to the Latin 'coma' and thus the original meaning
was lost. Again Bullinger points out that the ancient Egyptian name for this
constellation was 'Shes-nu' = 'the desired son'. He also quotes Albumazar,
an eighth century Arab astronomer, as saying that the Hebrews know this
child as Ihesu. He then draws attention to traditions, which include the
Zend Avesta, where a new star is to appear in Virgo foretelling the birth of
a mysterious child, who proves to be a fish born from a stone.
The Essenes of Qumran, authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls, were cabalistic
astronomer priests. This is generally agreed among scholars. Any links
between the Teacher (Revealer of Mysteries) — the central character in the
Scrolls — and the zodiac should therefore not surprise us. Furthermore, any
mysteries to be revealed by him must logically be of a cabalistic and
astronomical nature.
It is worth mentioning in passing that it is not the star sign which is
significant, it is the stars. It is these, with their individual influences, which
are said to shape the destiny of man.
My primary argument is that the whole body of writings we know as the
Bible was written with a view to preserving this tree and its secrets. Earlier
we saw this device complete with its twelve mythical tribes of Israel and
thirteen-sign zodiac. It will be recalled that we now have an extra orb on the
central branch, immediately below Leo. The sun, earth and moon then
move up to new positions,



30 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
leaving the genital orb free for Coma, for which the astronomical symbol is
this being the original source of the rose and cross.
Most important to remember in this arrangement is that the new stone is
in the throat of the tree and that it is Joseph, who now represents the new
sun in the new age. The addition of this orb makes room for the thirteenth
sign in the genitalia of the tree.
To this piece of information we need only add the meaning of a few key
words and then we find ourselves able to explain and understand Scripture
as never before.
In the shamanistic language of myth a 'stone' is a star or a constellation
of stars. 'Bread' is the food of the soul, arcane wisdom. Hence Jesus'
temptation by the Devil (Matthew 4: 3) takes on a new meaning. Only a
son of God (a shaman) can turn stones into loaves, thus the Devil's
command that Jesus should make the stones bread can be read as: Use the
stars for wisdom.
Fish or fishing, insofar as the original creators of the physical world were
said to be part man and part fish, represents mercurial science — feminine
wisdom from the watery womb of the world. Where bread is philosophical
knowledge, fish is the science behind it. Hence when Jesus gathers his
apostles — twelve, with him as the thirteenth — he tells them 'Come, and I
will make you fishers of men' (Matthew 4: 19), that is, creators of a new
world. With a new sun in a new age, he bids them open the womb of the
earth that they may father a new humanity with sacred knowledge as their
spermatozoa.
The vine, the grape and the blood of grapes (wine) are symbolic of
essence, the invisible omnipresence which in Scripture is termed Christ.
From the standpoint of those who lived within the system of thinking we
are discussing, Christ as a man was an impossible concept. God and Christ
are pure spirit, of which no image can be made. As earlier mentioned,
Christ in particular (not Jesus) and the Goddess Queen of Heaven represent
one and the same element in the creation process as described in ancient
myth.
The tree is also sometimes seen with a serpent entwined around its base;
it is even sometimes spoken of as a serpent. It is the original tree of
knowledge of good and evil found in Genesis.
In the Garden of Eden the serpentine fish-man tempts Eve with the fruit
of this tree, which is knowledge. Eve in turn tempts Adam, who we shall
later see is one of a series of images of a Jesus-type 'First Man' of the
Golden Age. Later myth calls the male voice-box the Adam's apple, the
'stone' of that first fruit being said



THE TREE, THE BOAT AND THE FISHER'S NET 31
to be stuck in man's throat. The tree is claimed to have the power of speech,
but only when it has the stone/star/sun in its throat. Tradition has it that the
Essenes (Qumranites) were guardians over a secret word which contained
72 letters. This was the unspeakable name of God.
Look now at how Luke 11:11 is transformed from meaningless-ness to
complete clarity:
If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a
stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?
The meaning is now completely reversed. The wise man gives his son
stones for bread and the serpent of wisdom rather than ordinary fish. He
feeds his son's soul, not his body.
In John 6: 48 Jesus says: 'I am that bread of life'. In verse 50 this bread
(wisdom) is from heaven. In verse 51 it is Jesus' flesh. In one sense, we
may say that the Nazarene symbolizes wisdom as it is sent down from
heaven, the stars.
In Deuteronomy 18: 18 God will raise up a prophet to speak His words.
This echoes the Scrolls, in which the Prophet/Teacher reveals the mysteries
of God (the heavens) in the Last Days.
If we apply the language of myth to the story of the woman taken in
adultery in John 8: 4-7, only he who is without sin may cast the first
(thirteenth) stone. The meaning again is completely reversed. The woman
caught in sin is, of course, Coma, with whom the shaman must have
intercourse to enter the land of the dead. He must pass through her womb to
enter that world.
My primary postulate at this point is that the Bible is, in fact, the
antithesis of its traditional conception.
The biblical Psalm 118 is particularly reflective of the Hymns Scroll of
Qumran — one of the Dead Sea Scrolls — which accredits itself to the
Righteousness Teacher. In Psalm 118, like the Teacher, David is chastised
by the Lord but not destroyed. He is also, likewise, compassed about by his
enemies. Again, as with the Teacher, God opened for David the gate of the
Lord in the temple/tree, which the Righteous shall enter. Having opened the
gates of righteousness for him in verse 19, in verse 20 they become the gate
of the Lord for which in verse 21 David gives praise. This gate is then
called the stone which the builders refused, and it is to become the head of
the corner. Later in the New Testament, Jesus identifies with this scripture.
It may be said that the Teacher is to the Scrolls



32 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
as Jesus is to the New Testament. This character is, in fact, a universal
archetype, who is the founder of a world kingdom of perpetual peace and
harmony which he invariably bases upon a rock.
Through the ages this stone has had a substantial influence on mystical
groups like Freemasonry. Earlier the Templars had it as the head of a
beautiful woman, the Caput LVIIIM, head number 58 M.
In Romans 9: 33 it becomes a rock of offence on which believers shall
not be ashamed. In Acts 4: 11 it is identified with Jesus, as a stone set at
naught but become a cornerstone. In Ephesians 2: 20 Jesus is specifically
this cornerstone.
In I Peter 2 we find the basis of a theme which runs through this entire
book. That is that this rock resides both in heaven and on earth; it lives in
the past and the future; it is spiritual, yet profoundly material. Thus we
begin to see the idea of a prophet Jesus whose task it is to teach the ancient
wisdom of the stars.
In this same chapter, Jesus is 'disallowed' of man and chosen of God. His
apostles are lively stones building a spiritual house. They are the
cornerstone in Sion, a chosen generation, a royal priesthood and a holy
nation. They are called by him (Jesus) out of darkness and into light. These
same were in time past 'not a people' but become a people of God. That is
to say they are not a national or ethnic group such as the traditional Israel;
these sons of the carpenter are a nation of priests. From this we may see
that, in Galatians 6: 15-16, Jesus with his spermatozoa/wisdom is a sort of
spiritual creator or First Man. And thus we shall see this stone working not
only in the spiritual realm, but in the machinations of men throughout
history, for which this silent and unnoticed piece of masonry has been a
real foundation and corner.
Numbers 24: 17 reads:
...there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of
Israel...
The star is the sun rising in Jacob/Judah (Leo) in the cosmic tree. This in
turn causes the Sceptre to rise in Ephraim (Israel); this prophecy describes
the rising of the thirteenth sign, as we saw in the diagrams. She is the royal
womb of the Sceptre King. But there is much more to it than this.
It is important that we distinguish immediately the pun or word play
which runs from the book of Numbers to the Scrolls. The Dead Sea
material refers to individuals, whereas in Scripture we



THE TREE, THE BOAT AND THE FISHER'S NET 33
are being shown that, rather than Coma being removed directly from the
genitalia of the tree, it is the removal of the sun stone which causes the
disappearance of the lunar thirteenth sign — if the sun is diminished, the
moon cannot give her light. The sun's return is symbolic of a new star for a
new age.
The Dead Sea Scrolls speak of two men — heroes, not gods — who
appear in the 'Last Days'. The first is the Righteousness Teacher, who is
spoken of as the Star. It is he for whom God sets the task of revealing 'all
the mysteries of Scripture'. This he must logically do by casting the stone
in the tree. If he is to reveal mysteries from Scripture, they must first exist.
One must put before another can take. What we are seeing here is an
example of those so-called hidden mysteries.
With this wisdom the Teacher, in the Last Days, gathers around him the
faithful of God, the remnant of spiritualized Israel, from which there arises
the Sceptre, a king from the line of David who rules the entire world from
Jerusalem = Heru-Salem, the city of the sun which is the tree. These, then,
are the two heroes we find in the Scrolls: a Star gatherer of Israel and a
Sceptre King who leads them to victory over the world. The star rising in
Jacob and the sceptre coming out of Israel then have both a literal and a
poetic meaning. Tracing these two heroes will be one of our primary
concerns. Once we identify them, nearly all the ancient myths will be open
to us.
An earlier version of this same story is found in the Sumerian epic of
Gilgamesh, in which Gilgamesh must raise a star (the sun) which has fallen
to earth. Later this same hero is found as Jason, who with his fifty
companions must capture the golden fleece, the sun. So many of these
stories begin with setting the sun in the tree.
Our heroes sometimes appear together and sometimes alone. In the case
of Samson we have only the Star, in which the growth of his hair — the
genital hair of the tree — gives him strength to destroy the temple of the
Philistines. Here the word-jugglers have used the Aramaic 'shimsha', the
sun, from which they derived Samson's name. The same character is found
in David, the young Shepherd who cast a stone and destroyed the giant
Goliath. All these stories are primarily concerned with conveying a series
of poetic concepts. Moses can also be seen to play the role of the Star when
he, with his serpentine staff, refreshes the people with water which comes
from a rock (Numbers 20: 11). Biblical water is the direct utterances of
God. In Exodus 3: 2-4 God had previously spoken to Moses from a burning
bush, which allegorically is the cosmic



34 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
tree with the sun in its branches. But he only led the people out of
(spiritual) bondage; it was Joshua the Sceptre who led them into the
promised land after Moses had given Israel the Law written upon two
stones, Coma and the new sun.
Our Star/Teacher is the first of the living dead; it is his rising up that
heralds the apocalypse which culminates in the dawn of a Golden Age. In
the story, Jesus is dead, the stone is rolled from his tomb and he is
resurrected. Having rolled it from his tomb he sets it upon the cosmic tree
and he lives again.
In Britain King Arthur (Greek artos = bread) drew his power (sword)
from a stone: none but him, the chosen one, could claim Excalibur. The
once and future king, he must die that he may live. In this instance, Arthur
is the Sceptre and Merlin is the Star.
The Scriptures, as we shall see, have been used as a vehicle or Trojan
horse in which every detail of the science of the temple has been
ingeniously buried. What we have here is the long-lost Philosopher's Stone.
What we see before us in the form of the complete tree is the mythic Holy
Grail.
The link between the Grail and the Philosopher's Stone — sometimes
called the Stone of Destiny — can be found in the meaning of the word
'Grail'. It is derived from the Latin 'gradalis', a platter used in Christian
monasteries for serving fish on Fridays. This is the Welsh 'dyscyl'. The
dyscyl of Rydderch was a platter which would provide every food that
could be wished for. This links the Grail with the Horn of Plenty (the
cornucopia) and the magic cauldron of Cerridwen which symbolize the
vagina of the Goddess and her bountiful womb. As we shall come to see,
the symbolism of fish as wisdom food, the events in the Piscean Age with
which the material is concerned and the pantheon of fish-gods make the
Grail as a fish-platter an important symbol. That it evolved into a golden
cup or Golden Bowl is also significant. Gold is synonymous with the sun,
with which the Grail, or vaginal food (wisdom), rises in the tree from the
Goddess. The cup, as the Grail came to be known, held liquid which was
either wine, which represented spiritual wisdom from the fruit of the tree,
or water, which is symbolic of divine wisdom. Thus the stone that teaches
wisdom and the platter that provides it are one.
This story has been told in a myriad different ways. For example it is said
that the discoverer of the water of life — the true word of God — became
lighter in weight as he drank, and thus ascended to heaven. As he rose up,
the cup from which he drank fell from his



THE TREE, THE BOAT AND THE FISHER'S NET 35
hands. His dogs (uninitiated mankind) then drank in the revelation and rose
up to heaven with him.
The question arises as to the significance of this device to ancient man.
In due course it will seem we have uncovered an ancient conspiracy of
enormous proportions. What then is the significance of the Philosopher's
Stone? What do we have in the Holy Grail, which has become the
foundation of more than one of the world's major religions? The claim of
the ancient shaman is that this tree is a means of travelling into the future,
that it is the source of prophecy, as we shall see.
The Elizabethan John Dee also displayed considerable genius when he
encoded his own operations manual for the temple of stones. Here we have
a glance at what exists beyond the void in the land of the living dead, and
some idea as to the purpose of the secret and sacred cosmic tree. The
following extracts are from John Dee's manuscript 'Ye Book of Al Azif Ye
Arab', edited by George Hay in the Necronomicon,6 the Book of Dead
Names (page 111):
OF YE OLD ONES AND THEIR SPAWN
The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are and the Old Ones shall be. From the
dark stars They came ere Man was born, unseen and loathsome They
descended to primal Earth.
Beneath the oceans They brooded while ages passed, till seas gave up the
land, whereupon They swarmed forth in Their multitudes and darkness ruled
the Earth.
Later:
Wantonly the Old Ones trod the ways of darkness and Their blasphemies
were great upon the Earth.
He is speaking here of the spirits which are the souls of the stars in the
land of the dead.
Beyond the Gate dwell now the Old Ones; not in the spaces known unto
men but in the angles betwixt them. Outside Earth's plane They linger and ever
awaite the time of Their return; for the Earth has known Them and shall know
Them in time yet to come.
And the Old Ones hold foul and formless Azathoth for Their Master...



THE THIRTEENTH STONE 36
Later (page 112):
The soul of Azathoth dwelleth in Yog-Sothoth and He shall beckon unto
the Old Ones when the stars mark the time of Their coming; for Yog-Sothoth
is the Gate through which Those of the Void will reenter. Yog-Sothoth
knowest the mazes of time, for all time is one unto Him. He knowest where
the Old Ones came forth in time long past and where They shall come forth
again when the cycle returneth.
In simple terms, Yog-Sothoth is the womb of the Piscean tree.
The times and seasons set for speaking to the spirits of the living
dead are when the spheres intersect at the proper time of Candlemas
and at Beltane, at Lammas, at Roodmas and at Hallowmas eve.
These are the times of the Ultimate Rite, the times when the veil
between the living and the dead is most easily penetrated.
It continues on page 114:
TO RAISE UP YE STONES
To form ye Gate through which They from ye Outer Void might manifest thou
must set up ye stones in ye elevenfold configuration.
This is the tree with eleven, not ten, sephiroth and consequently thirteen zodiacal
signs (stones). Later:
At ye center of the so completed configuration set ye the Altar of ye Great
Old Ones and seal it with ye symbol of Yog-Sothoth and ye mighty Names of
Azathoth, Cthulhu, Hastur, Shub-Niggurath and Nyarlathotep.
And ye stones shall be ye Gates through which thou shalt call Them forth
from Outside man's time and space.
On page 126 we have:
YE VOICE OF HASTUR
Hear ye the Voice of dread Hastur, hear the mournful sigh of the vortex, the
mad rushing of the Ultimate Wind that Swirls darkly amongst the silent stars.
Hear ye Him that howls serpent-fanged amid the bowels of nether earth.



THE TREE, THE BOAT AND THE FISHER'S NET 37
The following quotation is important. It will be remembered that I showed the
tree complete with eleven rather than ten sephiroth, the 'elevenfold configuration'.
With eleven sephiroth we then have thirteen signs of the zodiac. The extra stone of
the sun makes room for Coma. All superstition regarding the number thirteen no
doubt stems from this source. The thirteenth sign then becomes one of the cardinal
points and also represents the serpent of knowledge. In this quotation the signs are
referred to as globes (page 132):
TO CONJURE OF YE GLOBES
Know ye that the Globes of Yog-Sothoth be thirteen in number, and they be
the powers of the Parasite-hoard which are His servitors and doeth His bidding
in ye world.
Call them forth whenever thou shalt have need of anything and they shall
grant their powers unto ye when ye shall call them with the incantations and
make their sign.
The incantation is the unspeakable name of 72 letters. Further information on the
method of entering between the stones is given on page 130:
TO CALL FORTH YOG-SOTHOTH
When thou would call forth Yog-Sothoth thou must waite until the Sun is in
the Fifth House with Saturn in trine. Then enter within the stones and draw
about thee the Circle of evocation tracing the figures with the mystic scimitar
of Barzai.
Dee provides an apt warning to those who would pass between the fiery stones
unbidden and unclean, who would in foolishness pass through the cosmic tree,
beyond the stars, and into the void where reside the undead. On page 128 he says:
OF LENG IN YE COLD WASTE
Who seeketh Northwards beyond the twilight land of Inquanok shall find
amidst the frozen waste the dark and mighty plateau of thrice-forbidden Leng.
Know ye time-shunned Leng by the ever-burning evil-fires and ye foul
screeching of the scaly Shantak birds which ride the upper air;



38 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
by the howling of ye Na-hag who brood in knighted caverns and haunt men's
dreams with strange madness, and by that grey stone temple beneath the Night
Gaunts lair, wherein is he who wears the Yellow Mask and dwelleth all alone.
But beware O Man, beware, of Those who tread in Darkness the ramparts
of Kadath, for he that beholds Their mitred-heads shall know the claws of
doom.
The question now arises, does it actually work? Can a man enter the realm of the
dead and see the future?
One who does seem to have achieved this is Nostradamus, the seer whose
prophecies were first published well over 400 years ago. In Centuries 1: 2, he refers
to the cosmic temple as a tripod with three pillars, which is exactly how it often
appears:
The wand of power is placed in the midst of the tripod
standing upon its legs. With wand of power in hand, I sprinkle holy water
on the hem
of my garment and my foot. It is set in the middle of the branches, I
tremble, The divine splendour is sitting nearby.
He is here describing the setting of the sun 'in the middle of the branches' of the
cosmic tree.
Nostradamus's prophecies are legend. Here is an example of his skill as a seer. In
Centuries 10:100 he says:
A great empire shall be given to England, She shall be all-powerful for more
than 300 years. Her armies will cross the land and the sea. The Lusitanians
will be discontented.
This was published in 1555, long before the English dreamed of empire. The
Treaty of Union was enacted on 1 May 1707. Unfortunately Nostradamus has
suffered somewhat at the hands of 'criticos ineptus'.
In Centuries 2: 24 Nostradamus says:
Wild and hungry beasts will cross the rivers,
The greater forces on the battlefield will be against Hister.
He will be drawn into an iron cage.
This is when the children of Germany observe no laws.



THE TREE, THE BOAT AND THE FISHER'S NET 39
In cabalistic philosophy the letter 'L' has specific sacred significance,
whereas the letter 'S' is symbolic of a serpent. It is the number 6. By this
method Nostradamus changes Hitler into Hister and identifies him as
serpentine. The rest of this quatrain speaks for itself. We shall hear more
from the prophet in due course. Suffice it to say that, with the correct
apparatus, prophecy is plausible.
In the next section we need to look at some of the historical background
to our subject. The object in this one has been to give an initial
demonstration of the kind of material we are dealing with. It matters not
that magic and prophecy are not a part of our world: it was the foundation
stone of the ancient civilizations, which, in this context, are our sole
concern.
I am not interested in promoting a viewpoint. If we are to understand our
prehistoric ancestors, we must look through their eyes. What we may or
may not subsequently come to believe is a completely separate issue. It is
blind belief alone that keeps men in ignorance. What we shall now begin to
see is that the Bible has more place in a coven than it does in a church. Be
this as it may, we are concerned solely with uncovering a mystery. Nothing
more, nothing less.
Conclusion
Our real starting-point in this instance is the cosmic tree, which has been
shown as incomplete. With its thirteenth sign, its cybernetic steersman, it
was the means by which prophets such as Nostradamus foretold the future.
We have also seen reference to it in Scripture, which we shall see is not in
any way an historical document but entirely concerned with the end of the
Piscean era and the dawn of Aquarius. This tree is one of three primary
elements of our story. I have also spoken of the Star and Sceptre, who
appear respectively as a latter-day prophet and a king of Israel.
These three elements — the cosmic tree, the Teacher and the Sceptre
King — are the three subjects that will concern us in this work. As we
progress we shall see that they are at the centre of almost all the ancient
world's myths. The significance of the Dead Sea Scrolls is that they present
these same elements in a manner that allows us to unravel these traditions.
To say that the Bible has absolutely no historical value amounts to a denial of
much of what we term ancient history: the Scriptures are still one of our
central platforms for understanding pre-Christian man. Convincing people to
abandon the traditional historical picture would require a miracle. Even if
one's evidence were conclusive, there would simply be no point in pressing
the issue.



40 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
A theme that will repeat itself is that of Jesus the Teacher being a creator. As I
have said, he is a spiritual creator. I do not believe that the writers of the Adam and
Eve myth believed for one moment in the actuality of this first man and first
woman. As a version of the Scrolls' Teacher, Adam was a progenitor of a new
humanity by virtue of his wisdom seed. In due course we shall see that, in some
instances, fish-men of mercurial wisdom also play this creator role. The New
Testament stories in which Jesus forges a link with the sea are quite common.
I have said that at the centre of our investigation is the cosmic tree. It is never
referred to in Scripture as such, but we find it there in the form of the Temple, the
Ark of the Covenant, Noah's Ark and the New Jerusalem.
I have introduced initial material, which will have further support, suggesting a
link between Jesus and the Scrolls Teacher. This is another problem of similar
proportion to the argument that the Bible is not history. As far as I am concerned,
the link between Jesus and the Teacher has long since been proved. Not least among
the proponents of this argument was John M. Allegro, a member of the official
Qumran Scrolls Committee. This, again, has changed nothing; thus it is a canoe I
shall paddle no further than necessary.
Another leg upon which my argument stands is that the surface text of the Bible
was merely a vehicle for the cosmic tree.
It may well be said that the Roman Church swims in the blood of the saints.
From the time when imperial Rome transferred its power to the Church, it has
indulged in witch-hunts, inquisitions, crusades and holy wars specifically to rid
itself of its gnostic pagan roots. My proposal says that those who came to believe in
the reality of the gospels were duped. Their predilection to idol worship was used
by the gnostic priests as a means of transferring the tree to the children of Aquarius.
It is a terrible irony of history that Rome butchered pagans in defence of a god
who from birth had a long and distinguished pagan lineage. Previous virgin births
include Dionysus (born in a stable, and later to turn water into wine), Mithras (born
in a stable and resurrected at Easter) and Gautama Buddha (born of Maya). Other
'absolutely divine' conceptions include those of Attis, Indra, Krishna, Zoroaster and
Adonis. The question must be asked: Is there a more terrible and vicious crime than
killing a human being for what he or she believes — particularly when it concerns
matters of the spirit? And particularly if such a man should question such obviously
ridiculous beliefs.
Finally, we have the matter of the reality or otherwise of using this scientific
device, the cosmic tree, as a means of seeing the future. I do not intend to argue the
validity of this question. I can only point to the sheer volume of evidence that we
have at our disposal.



3
The Trojan Horse
It has long been accepted that the pre-Christian world seems to have had a
unity of religious belief far greater than we have today. The people who
produced the material from which we derive a picture of the period prior to
our age were few and far between, and were virtually all of them priests.
Illiteracy ran from the peasant through to the king; the magi priests retained
the roles of scribes and interpreters of the law. They were, furthermore,
held in awe and deep respect, and even the king or chieftain knew better
than to challenge them. The omnipotent astronomer priest had since the
beginning of civilization been lawgiver and master. If we consider the
impact they might have had on illiterate, untutored people, particularly
when they held the power of the tree, we may see that everyone had reason
to fear them.
Until recently we have tended to overlook the highly mythical elements
of the Bible and have regarded it as an historical document. As we shall go
on to see, the New Testament is totally mythological, whereas the Old
Testament seems to contain a small number of historical references which
have been worked over and mythologized.
The major problem with seeing anything at all is that one observes it
from where one is standing; unfortunately history is particularly affected by
this problem. Unlike people of the modern world, ancient man did not see
in a linear fashion. As we saw in the previous section, he did not have his
reality circumscribed by what he could see, smell, touch, taste and hear. For
all that we may dismiss as unscientific the idea that by singing a set of
harmonies a man may leave his body and travel to the future, we must
remember that, despite all our scientific effort, our understanding of the
ancient world is very small. Too often we have taken a purely mythical text
and treated it as historical. Because we find the ruins of a temple in a given
place we automatically assume that most or all the people worshipped at
that shrine. The fact is that the great majority simply would not have been
allowed into the sacred places.
Britain is strewn with stone circles, the most famous of them being
Stonehenge (Saxon: stan hengek, stone gallows), which we know were
centres of Druidic religion. We cannot conclude from



42 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
this any more than that Britain was governed by Druids. I fancy that, for
the majority of the populace at the time, Stonehenge was as much of a
mystery as it is for us.
It is commonly believed that the pre-Christian world was largely
pantheistic. We credit the Hebrews with establishing monotheism. Recent
research makes it apparent that Druidism was not only monotheistic but to
all intents and purposes basically one and the same religion as that of the
Hebrews. This will be proved conclusively as we progress. The Druid had
only to don the bishop's mitre in order to become priest to Christianity.
History tells us that this transition in Britain was remarkably quick and
easy. And let us also remember that even Christianity must be divided in
two. We have first of all the primitive or gnostic version, which much later
became what we might term Romanized Paulism. If we confuse what the
Church believes today with what was taught by the first Christians
(messianists) to reach Rome, we have little hope of understanding its
history at all.
Nearly fifty years after the first of the Dead Sea Scrolls were found, the
name by which the Qumran Christians were known is still a matter for
debate among scholars. They seem to have attached a preconceived label to
each possible title for these people. If, for example, we call them Essenes
then we should picture them with long, flowing beards and white robes
endlessly and in the most eccentric manner wandering the highways and
byways of Judea benignly blessing all and sundry as they passed by with
scrolls tucked neatly under their arms. On the other hand, if we term them
Therapeutae, we may now see them as students of Pythagoras collecting
herbs to make secret potions to cure the king's gout or impotence. If we call
them Zealots then we see them as religious fanatics rather like the modern
extremists now emerging from all the major religions.
This form of compromise factionalizes the order. In this way scholars
have been able to allow for contingencies, including one group who went
off and established Christianity and another who were the Zealots
responsible for the battles with Rome.
We are aware of the name 'Essenes' and of the existence of this group
primarily from the writings of Josephus (Antiquities 13,5,9). He calls them
Essens. Pliny the Elder (Historica Naturalis, circa 70-77 CE) calls them
Hessenes. Philo of Alexandria (Quad Omnis Probus Liber, circa 20 CE)
terms them Essenoi. Other sources are Porphyry, Dio Chrysostom,
Hyppolytus and Eusebius. John Allegro



THE TROJAN HORSE 43
suggests that the name may be derived from the Aramaic root 'sy' (heal);
thus Assaya (corresponding to the Greek Essenoi) = healers.7 We also have
'Asayya' (myrtles), which were ancient trees of healing. Philo provides a
detailed description of the Essene communities. He was himself, like
Josephus, one of their number. Thus the only real history we have of this
shy body of people was written by men who were themselves members of
the community. In column V,8 of the Hymns Scroll,8 the Teacher says:
Thou hast caused me to dwell with the many fishers who spread a net
upon the face of the waters...
The fourth century bishop Epiphanius9 refers to the Dead Sea community
as 'Ossaeans', which I personally prefer. In due course, as I have said, we
shall discuss the cycles of fish-man creation epics which include the
numerous New Testament fishing/fish/fishermen stories. The Babylonian
leader of these fish-men was Oannes, which must be the source for a
substantial group of words like 'ocean' and 'Jonathan'. What the Dead Sea
community was called has proved a useful diversion for scholars; my
opinion is that what they did is far more important. Nevertheless, I suggest,
the root of their name lies in Oannes. The fact is that this all-powerful
priesthood arrogated all law unto themselves. Their task was to be
shepherds to the people and to act as God's sole agents upon earth. Primary
among their claims was that they had been shown 'all things that must come
to pass'.
The first of the great civilizations was Sumer. Even before she arose,
man seems to have developed an amazingly advanced cos-mological
science far beyond what might meet the apparent needs of the time.
The founders of the Sumerian culture were not indigenous: they came
from somewhere else. Subsequently, the basics of developed civilization
appeared. Writing, for example, which is a very complex conception, has
no evolution as such.
The first primitive man who made what might have been an inspired
guess as to the nature of things began a series of events which ultimately
led to his transition from tribal soothsayer to priest king whose word was
divine law. Where the rest of the tribe would have occupied themselves
with food, shelter and procreation, over many generations our shaman was
honing the ultimate human weapon, his mind. By the time of the building of
Sumer,



44 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
the raising of the Pyramid of Cheops in Egypt and the building of
Stonehenge in Britain, the priest had become a benign dictator. His power
set him aside from the common herd. The priest kings have long since
disappeared. They have been replaced by less scrupulous men while most,
without any thought for tomorrow, blithely content themselves with the
same old business of food, shelter and procreation.
The planets follow the sun in a great cycle which, as I have said, takes
25,920 years to complete. During this time the sun appears to be in one
particular part of the zodiac for a period of 2160 years. Roughly speaking,
from 4000 to 2000 BCE the earth was in Taurus, it then moved to Aries for
another two thousand years, and at the time of the spreading of the gospel it
had moved to Pisces, the fishes.
Coincidentally, the birth of modern civilization begins with the dawn of
the Age of Taurus. Interestingly, this development and its manner are very
much in tune with the characteristics credited to the Taurean.
According to our astronomer priests, Pisces was going to be an era of
iron, and a time when the sun would dominate the moon. It would be a
period of masculine material science rather than a balanced age: the coming
world would turn its back on the priest and all his hard-won wisdom. The
tree would be cut down. All this was to happen within a Great Month, a
twelfth part of the 25,920 years in which day and night, light and darkness,
good and evil alternate.
Pisces is to be followed by Aquarius, which is governed by Saturn. This,
according to the astronomer priests, would be the beginning of another
Golden Age.
In this time the tree would once again bear fruit and mankind would
come to live in peace, harmony and justice. The main concern of the
ancient priests was that their spiritual heirs should not have to start from
scratch as they once did. With this in mind, a vehicle was prepared which
would carry all that they had learned through the stormy seas of the Piscean
period. The Bible was built as a Trojan horse which would meet the
religious needs of the people of Pisces. And so it was that the Scriptures
were written, giving the materialistic, male-dominated people of our era a
material male god to worship. At the end of that dark time, God would send
an interpreter of the law who would reveal all that hard-won wisdom to the
children of Aquarius. In John 4: 22 Jesus in the role of the Teacher is heard
to say: 'Ye worship ye know not what'.



THE TROJAN HORSE 45
In Romans 9: 21 Paul says:
Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make
one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
The divinity of Jesus for a long time rested upon the notion of his having
brought a new gospel, a new covenant from God. After the Scrolls were
found, the official committee set up to be responsible for them was
predominantly Catholic and under the direct eye of the Vatican. They found
themselves between a rock and a hard place. If they dated the finds as being
of the same period as Jesus, then, in the role of the Righteousness Teacher,
he was clearly not divine. The corresponding hero of the Scrolls is an
ordinary mortal whom God calls to His service. Furthermore, the Qumran
community consisted of Pythagorean gnostics, which was and obviously
still is anathema for the Church. They practised the occult philosophies,
which Rome was always at pains to stamp out. If, as they did, they dated
the bulk of the documents about 200 years earlier, then Christianity would
be seen to have been established long before Jesus arrived. This deprived
him of the uniqueness of his gospel but would be easier to explain away.
And besides, they hoped that, if they delayed the publication of those
fragments that give these writings a later dating, the world would
eventually get bored and forget what in retrospect would be seen as a storm
in a teacup. Robert Eisenman played a major role in having these later
fragments published. As has been mentioned, he was earlier told that he
would never see them in his lifetime.
What then was happening in Palestine about two thousand years ago?
At this stage I can only provide an educated guess, but it is as good a
working hypothesis as any. Later circumstantial evidence will justify it. The
first thing to be avoided is the idea that there was some kind of cut-off point
at which things changed, such as the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in
70 CE.
As colonizers go, the Romans were not that bad. Basically, if you paid
your tribute and did not hinder their material ambitions, you were free to
worship who and what you pleased. They encouraged indigenous puppet
governments to take care of internal matters. Only in Palestine and Britain,
on the fringes of the empire, did they encounter what would have seemed to
them to be unreasonable resistance.



46 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
It is plausible that Rome may not have had any real desire to conquer
Britain, which for a long time, under the Druids, had been a centre of
European learning. But the Romans were facing problems keeping peace in
Gaul, and the British were providing men and arms for that resistance. The
only way to pacify Gaul was to neutralize Britain, which ultimately they
failed to conquer completely.
A not dissimilar situation existed in Palestine, which was the highway to
the Levant. The goods obtainable there would help to enrich and keep
peaceful the populace of Rome itself. As in Britain, the stubborn priests of
Palestine were forever goading the populace into insurrection. Pliny tells us
there were about four thousand Essenes.10 I conjecture that the relative
absence of these priests from the history of the period speaks volumes
about their prominence. Rome was dealing with fanatical fundamentalists
who had power over the people and would not compromise with her. Once
you had been labelled 'The Great Satan' there was no room for negotiation.
It was for this reason — to strike the priesthood at its roots — that the
Jerusalem Temple was destroyed in 70 CE. The revolt began in 66 CE.
For the Magi priests who had once ruled the world, Rome was the herald
of this new and dark iron age. Resistance against her had been organized
into two separate plans. And I suggest there was some collaboration
between the Druids of Britain and the priests of Palestine, the Essenes. I
shall later show evidence that will indirectly but firmly support this. As part
of my argument I say that, contrary to established belief, the Dead Sea
Scrolls do not report any of this conflict — like the Scriptures, these
writings are concerned with the future. That is why there is no mention of
the Essenes in the New Testament. The Pharisees and Sadducees are latter
day priests in prophecy.
Plan A was military resistance, which would provoke the destruction of
supposed ancient Israel. By the time this objective had eventually been
achieved, plan B would have been brought into effect. It had been prepared
since 200 BCE at the latest.
Events that were to occur some two thousand years later would be used
as the basis. The story of these events would be told as though it were
history. All this was designed to become the foundation of a new religion.
But the story from Genesis through to Revelation would, within its text,
using a system of numerological ciphers, contain all the wisdom of the
ancient world. Further, the



THE TROJAN HORSE 47
New Testament, which like the Old was a Trojan horse, would be prepared,
wherein the story appeared to be current to that time. Within it, provision would be
made for the kind of god who would meet the requirements of the people of the
Piscean Age. This too would tell the story of the two heroes of the Last Days, the
Star and the Sceptre. The Christ, which had previously been a feminine spirit, was
allowed here to take on a masculine appearance through our two heroes. As we
shall see, ludicrous as it may seem, ancient Israel and its Temple were built so that
they might be destroyed. The Essenes planned the dispersion.
The name 'Jesus' is, in the original Greek of the New Testament, derived from
Zeus, the sun god. The sun is a star, and the Star is the Teacher in the Scrolls. Later
we shall see that Jehovah was originally Baal. Furthermore, 'Christ' does not
properly translate as 'Messiah'. Inasmuch as they are human messengers from God,
the term 'Messiah' can be only loosely applied to the Star and Sceptre. It is
important to point out that the Hebrew Scriptures actually refer to three Messiahs: 1:
the Christ or spirit essence, the salvation from within; 2: the priest king from the
house of David who in Scripture is referred to as the 'Sceptre' and also as the
'Branch'; 3: a prophet whom the Scriptures term the 'Star'. Their appearance is in
reverse order. The Scrolls echo this scheme, and the Teacher/Prophet is credited
with the gathering together of the remnant of the faithful of God.
On pages 67-68 of The Dead Sea Scrolls in English, G. Vermes makes the
following comment upon the Teacher:
Though several experts see in him the author of certain of the Scrolls, the
Community Rule for instance, and some of the Hymns, this theory is not
supported by any definite evidence. As a person the Teacher remains
anonymous and appears only through the writings inspired by him, and
through the role which his followers attributed to him as builder of the
Community, guide to truth and knowledge, and discoverer of the mysteries of
God. We know him through the faith of his disciples whose attitude to him
may perhaps best be expressed by quoting the Scrolls:
All those...who have listened to the voice of the Teacher of Righteousness
and have not despised the precepts of Righteousness when they heard them,
they shall rejoice and their hearts shall be strong... God will forgive them and
they shall see His salvation because they took refuge in His holy Name.' (DR
B 11)



48 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
In the second body of the Scriptures there would first, in Matthew,
appear the story of the birth of the Sceptre: he who shall be king. Later, in
Luke, under the same appellation of Jesus, we have the appearance of the
Star, the prophet revealer of all the mysteries, who we see as the star
guiding the magi to Bethlehem in the story in Matthew. The two
appearances are set in reverse order in these writings. There are no lost
years of Jesus, though there are two Jesuses. But we shall return to this
later.
These two bodies of Scripture would be taken to Rome, where they
would be seeded. It is interesting to think that, while Roman troops were
marching to subdue Palestine, Palestinian magi were on their way to
conquer Rome.
The objective was to eventually establish an external religion which had
been popularized and would act as an outer wall. The foundations for this
would be the writings accredited to Paul. It is worth noting that Paul was
originally Saul, which in Hebrew means 'that which is required'. Paul is
Latin, and means 'little'; hence Paul/Saul was the little that was required to
establish the cult of Jesus, and it is almost solely upon the writings of Paul
that Roman and modern Christianity is based.
Within this framework the magi would continue to recruit from each
generation and try to influence matters for as long as they could against an
age which more and more despised them and all they represented. What we
have come to think of as the curse and subsequent persecution of the Jews
as an ethnic group has been, in reality, a persecution of the internal
feminine spirit present in all races and both genders.
Legend has it that in the third decade of our era a group of these early
Christians went to Britain where they received the perpetual gift of the
twelve hides at Glastonbury, and where they founded a gnostic church.
Eventually this movement withdrew to Ireland, where it survived until the
complete Romanization of the Church in that country. At the time of which
I speak, stemming Roman power in Britain and Palestine was essential to
the long-term plan, as we shall come to see. This involved protecting the
actual bloodline, which would later become biblical and from which the
King Messiah from this 'house of David' would eventually arise. One role
which popular Christianity would perform would be that of a fortress within
which this bloodline would be perpetuated and protected till the time came
for it once again to assume the role of shepherd kings.



THE TROJAN HORSE 49
From the Roman point of view, Christianity came along as an alternative
vehicle for waning colonial power. Catholicism remains to this day an
extension of the original imperialism. Its history is not of a theology but of
an imperium.
There can be no doubt that the magi remained in control at the heart of
the empire well into the fifth century because the gathering together of the
books of the Bible was clearly not a matter of spontaneous choice. They are
bound together by a numerological code which can be broken with the
alteration of just one word. These two bodies of writing, the Old and New
Testaments, were put together as one book, which we learn at the end of
the book of Daniel is to be sealed and incomprehensible until the Last Days
— that is to say, until the Teacher comes to break the seals. In the
Revelation of John, the book has its seven seals opened by the
Angel/Teacher/revealer of mysteries, and this signals the beginning of the
apocalypse, the death of the Piscean era and the birth of the Golden Age.
The word 'apocalypse', referring to a major catastrophe or disaster, is from
the Greek 'apokalupsis', which means 'revealing' or 'unveiling'. Thus Jesus
the Teacher is a revealer/ unveiler of the mysteries in the Last Days.
When the Scrolls were discovered it was at first assumed they had been
hurriedly hidden from the invading Roman army. It soon became apparent
that there had been no hurry at all; even the airtight jars that contained the
Qumran finds had been specially prepared. It had also been intended that
the library should remain hidden for a very long time. The purpose of the
texts is twofold. They too contain ciphers which scholars have already
found, but, more importantly, they are a key to Scripture; they also provide
the rules for the founding of the community in the Last Days.
In ancient times a scroll was bound upon a stick on which it was rolled.
Hence a stick can mean a book. We may therefore say that in the Bible and
the Qumran writings we have two sticks.
In I Kings 17 we find the widow, a common mythic type for the Spider
Goddess Queen of Heaven, gathering two sticks; she has little grain with
which to make 'bread'. Later her son dies of sickness and Elijah restores
him. The term 'son of the widow' is not uncommon in myth and is often
applied to Jesus in cabalistic tradition; it describes the Sceptre, who is both
the son and the consort of Ariadne the spider. Accordingly, it is applied to
the Masonic Hiram Abif. After the Teacher has fertilized her, she consumes
him and subsequently bears their son, the king of the Golden Age.



50 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
In Acts 28: 3 Paul gathers together a bundle of sticks (books) out of
which, when it is thrown on the fire (the sun set in the tree), a viper rises.
This serpent, being of the genitalia of the cosmic temple, cannot harm him.
It is the serpent of wisdom.
Be it a universal appearance of a Great Flood epic or the worship of the
Creatress, there has long been an awareness that there is incredible
similarity in myths from around the entire globe. Logic can explain
Goddess worship in that, quite reasonably, in a religious system based on
'as above, so below' the creation would have been attributed to a female.
That the Creator should ever have been seen as male is idiosyncratic and
should arouse our suspicion. That, in our era, we have both considered our
ancestors primitive and at the same time accepted the phenomenon of a
solely male deity should, in itself, make us wonder about our own trad
itions and their widespread pagan roots.
For example, pre-European Australia may be said to have been one of
the most isolated places on earth, yet the Aborigines also have their Great
Flood epic. Here, Kangaroo gathered all the creatures to push back the
waters and create dry land. He then spat out all the diverse tongues that the
people would speak.
Despite the absence of evidence, its accepted historicity has denied us
the opportunity of becoming more familiar with the mythical elements of
the Flood. Before we may hope to find any sort of truth, we must abandon
our preconceptions.
I have yet to find any writing which does not give at least a passing nod
to the historicity of Jesus. The closest one comes to a denial is that there
must have been someone, in the confusion and turmoil that was Galilee at
the time, upon whom the character is based. The case for an historical Jesus
rests fairly and squarely upon the New Testament writings, and this we
shall come to see is no case at all. His life is supposed to have spanned from
the time of Herod the Great to Pontius Pilate, who ordered his execution.
Outside the New Testament there is no record of the supposed census
which brought Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem, nor of the slaughter of in
fants ordered by Herod, nor of Pilate's execution order. The Romans were
very meticulous in keeping records. The answer to the Bethlehem birth is
easily found, for in Hebrew Beth = House, and Lehem or Lechem = Bread;
in old Gaelic, 'Ilech' was a stone — thus 'cromlech', a group of standing
stones. Hence Jesus is born in the house of wisdom which is, of course, the
zodiac. The sun and earth enter a new sign and Jesus is the new-born king
of the new age.



THE TROJAN HORSE 51
General consensus presumes his birth to be set somewhere in the spring
between 4 and 2 BCE. But Herod died in April of 4 BCE, so the birth must
go back even further, to at least 5 or 6 BCE. But there is here a mystery
which over the years has taunted and eluded me. To explain I need to make
a temporary detour.
During the Victorian era it was for a time a fad to investigate what was
termed 'the numerics of Scripture', which apparently was evidence of the
divine inspiration of these writings. But how does it work?
The ancient sacred alphabets of the magi did not use separate symbols
for numbers and letters. For example, if we do the same with the modern
English alphabet, the glyph that forms the sound 'A' also represents the
number 1. In this system B = 2 through to J = 10, K is then 20, on to S =
100, T = 200 etc. In such a system, a series of letters which form a word
can otherwise be read as a series of numbers. Thus, F = 6, O = 60, and X =
600; hence, 666 being the number of the beast, the beast is a fox, a creature
of cunning. This is purely a demonstration of the basic concept.
What these Victorians found in Scripture was pure cabala. Setting all else
aside, scholars have already found a close relationship between the Scrolls
and the New Testament. If we add to this the evidence of numerology in
Scripture, then the case for Jesus and the Teacher being one is self-evident.
A Russian mathematician, Ivan Panin, found that the entire sixty-six
books of both the Old and New Testaments were, verse by verse, chapter
by chapter and book by book, bound together by what he termed numerics.
This numerology proves that whoever wrote Genesis, the first book, had to
know exactly what would go into Revelation, the last. None of the writings
of the Bible could have been produced without total reference to the others.
This demonstrates a very late date for Genesis etc. Panin eventually went
on to edit what he called The Numeric New Testament.11 Using
numerology, he was able to prove the entire text as original — that is to say
that, by confirming the patterns of numbers beneath these writings, he was
able to affirm the integrity of the surface text. We shall deal with this
matter at length in due course.
But let me return to my point. According to scriptural exegesis the birth
date of Jesus was in about the year 4000 of Adam (Biblical/Hebrew
calendar). Ivan Panin sets it at exactly the year 3999 of Adam. The Hebrew
and modern Jewish calendar, running from this starting-point, has as its
current date the year 5757, which



52 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
is 1997. A quick glance at the arithmetic will demonstrate that, according
to Scripture, Jesus was born in the year 239 CE. That is to say that his birth
date is set over 200 years after his supposed death. By this time, the Roman
Church was well established (see Appendix I).
There do seem to have been some problems in the early Church
establishing the time of the birth of Jesus and the start of our era. For this
we can allow a maximum of five years, but this changes nothing. This birth
date is clearly purely cabalistic, and has no relationship to history at all.
Outside the New Testament, our greatest source of information for this
period in Palestine is Josephus, who by his own account was an Essene
(Life, 2). He implies that he was a member of the group for only one year,
but he also says that he was under the tutelage of an ascetic in the desert for
about three years.
Josephus was high born, well educated as a youth, and an exponent of
the law in his teenage years (Life, 2). This seems to indicate an Essene
influence. He was a general and a man of great stature in the war with
Rome, one which was fundamentally religious and led by the Essenes. He
could not, in my opinion, have held his position without strong ties to this
order. Furthermore, these monks seem to have been the only religious
grouping in Palestine at the time. The Pharisees and Sadducees are a part of
the Last Days New Testament picture. The absence of the Essenes from
Scripture is loud and relevant: there is no reference to them in these
writings because, as I have said, the Bible is purely prophecy of the Last
Days.
In Antiquities 18,3,lff. Josephus is made to tell us reverentially of Jesus
the Christ. This reference is now well known to have been a much later
addition by one of his Christian interpreters, probably Bishop Eusebius.
Contrary to the statement in Josephus, the simple fact is that the New
Testament character could not and would not have survived three and a half
days of his ministry in Palestine, let alone three and a half years. The
concept of a Christ made male and flesh simply didn't exist. He would have
generated precisely the same hatred as did Rome with its brazen images.
In concluding this section I would like to leap forward momentarily to
the time of the Crusades. This should serve to give us some idea of the far
reaching implications of the events that occurred in Palestine some two
thousand years ago.
The Crusaders set off at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to wrest
the Holy Land from Islam. They left as Crusaders and many



THE TROJAN HORSE 53
returned as Knights Templar. They formed lodges or temples which held to
a secret occult tradition. They eventually became an extremely wealthy and
powerful order which was in due course suppressed. Many of the chevaliers
and their reputed vast fortune disappeared, most likely to Scotland, where
later they re-emerged as the Order of St John and the Ancient Order of Free
and Accepted Masons. Later still an attempt was made to establish a
Masonic state in Scotland. After this failed, the United States of America
(known to the Templars as La Merika: see Appendix IV), as an independent
republic based on Masonic philosophy, became the next source of hope.
This led to the War of Independence, which was not won by the American
States but lost by the British. There is no evidence, so perhaps we should
assume that another cache of similar documents was hidden elsewhere, and
that the Crusaders also entered the Dead Sea caves and found scrolls from
which they developed the secret doctrine of the Poor Knights of Christ. But
this can only serve as an unfounded assumption, for the Templars are very
closely linked as protectors to the actual house of David.
Freemasons are men who work with stones, and this, I suggest, originally
had a double meaning. They regard the Bible as the repository of all their
secrets, which they admit are now lost to them. But they hold to the idea
that it was masons (workers in stone) who built the Temple of Solomon in
Jerusalem, the city of the sun. This is the temple that Professor Thompson
found to be non-existent. In every instance we find an echo of the future
being set in the past and seen as history.
If we are to comprehend what we have before us, we need temporarily to
ignore or forget what we have come to know as history, for it seems that it
is something we encounter in the future. The crux of my argument is quite
simply that not only the stories of the Bible but many of those in the ancient
myths do not depict past happenings but events that are yet to come. This is
the turn of the tide after millenia of decline from what had been a Golden
Age.
Conclusion
With their absolute power, the ancient magi manufactured what we now know as
history. Their object was to launch their Trojan horse across the Piscean era. The
basis for religion was established in what became the Bible. Their sole object was to
hand over to their spiritual heirs, the children of Aquarius, both the tree and its
operations manual. The prominent



54 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
heroes of the Bible were based upon the two men who lived at the other end of the
age. I have said that history was manufactured; I propose that we were encouraged
to believe our ancestors primitive, and came to do so because of the predominant
masculine arrogance of our era. I have made several references to the suppression
of the feminine by the masculine. This needs clarification.
Quite simply, the brain is divided into two sections. The left hemisphere
(masculine) controls the right side of the body and is largely responsible for what
might be termed the external world. Its primary function is logic. The right
performs exactly the opposite task, it is substantially intuitive. Thus, irrespective of
actual gender, we are all a composition of both. The entry of the earth into Pisces,
whose stars (feminine) are weak and watery, allowed the sun (masculine) to
dominate and oppress this higher self. There was the greatest imbalance. This
happened not only externally, with men oppressing and dominating women, but
also internally, where the feminine poetic and intuitive spiritualizing force would be
beaten into submission. Our age, as was predicted, would be dominated by men and
their external sciences, their logic and their rationalism. Jesus was manufactured to
meet this need. He was the great solar penis of his time.
We will probably never know how much of what we have before us was known
to those who instructed the Scrolls Committee to drag its feet. In my opinion, quite a
lot. It has been said very often, and is worth repeating, that there has been a Scrolls
cover-up, and an obvious conspiracy of silence. But it doesn't matter now: in far less
than a century both they as a dominant group in our species and their wooden god
will be dead. The most important point to ponder is our collective duplicity and self
deceit. This is exemplified in the tradition that Freemasonry's secrets are lost and
locked up in Scripture. This concept is central to lodge ritual and belief. Since the
discovery of the Scrolls, we have had the ancient pre-Masonic and pre-Templar
legend of a Revealer of Mysteries in Scripture. To my knowledge, Freemasonry has
completely missed this confirmation of its tradition. Equally, to my knowledge,
investigators of the Dead Sea material seem to have ignored or not noticed this
amazing coincidence. Furthermore, at the closing of the Lodge, the Wardens inform
the Worshipful Master that they are directing their steps to the west to find that
which was lost, the true secrets of Masonry. Logically, this must include the stone
the builders rejected — the star sign (stone) Coma, which sits in the west wall of the
temple/tree. The unconscious feminine.
It is possible that at some point the reader will conclude that I have a personal
political or religious agenda. This could not be further from the truth. If you are at a
level in your own development where the vast



THE TROJAN HORSE 55
panoply of religious and political lies and sacred illusions is still precious to you,
you would do better to set this book aside. I certainly will not enter into any debate
regarding the veracity of present-day beliefs. I am simply not interested. My sole
concern is with the life to come.
Let me make it abundantly clear. This book is concerned only with tracing and
understanding a phenomenon now taking place: the spiritual evolution of mankind.
This, I contend, sets me and this book above any criticism that I am anti this or anti
that. If we are to begin again — as we must — then, as wise serpents, we need to
shake off the old and put on the new. It should be noted that I do not alter one word
of Scripture, though I do debate its meaning. My greatest heresy is that I set the
entire epic in a totally different timeslot.
If I am to be accused of any sort of racism, it can only be on the basis of my
noting the obvious superiority of a spiritually evolved humanity of the future. If any
of us fail to see this and raise ourselves above our present status of beasts, we shall
consign ourselves to oblivion, and the universe will not shed a single tear. It is now
imperative that we each fight for our survival with both our hearts and our minds.
It is in relation to this urgency that the reader will find this book liberally
peppered with terms like 'Last Days'. This, I insist, is an astronomical reference,
denoting a point of culmination and conclusion. Sadly, these two words have long
since become the property of the lunatic fringe, who have been — to my knowledge
— proclaiming the end of the world since the second century of our era. If we also
take the Scrolls into account, and accept that some of them date back to around 200
BCE, we shall see that this is one more example of the failure of the claimed
inspiration upon which Christianity is based.
It is clear from scriptures such as Hebrews 1:1-2 that the apostles see themselves
as living in the end times. Here it says that God 'hath in these last days spoken unto
us by his Son...' This is obviously yet another nail in the historical Bible's coffin.
Today we have physical evidence of approaching calamity. We do not need the
declamations of the Bible-bashers, nor their insistence that there will be a gnashing
of teeth, to awaken us to cold, hard reality. These portents of doom are now
increasingly being proclaimed by scientists and respected experts in numerous other
disciplines. But, if we place the events of Scripture in a modern setting, texts such
as the one above begin to make extraordinary sense. If we see them as pure and very
accurate prophecy, and if this is what they actually are, we shall have acquired an
extremely useful tool for our survival. Death has no terror equal to that of the stain
of falsehood and dishonour. This grand truth the ancient stones proclaim. Si tatlia
jungere possis sit tibi sciri posse.

Myths, Miracles and Misconceptions
From the beginning it was apparent that the Qumran Scrolls were gnostic
and shamanistic texts, but it seems that almost everyone dealing with them
has tried to do so without soiling his hands with this now disapproved-of
set of philosophies. But before I point the bone, let me admit that initially I
too was guilty of trying to present this material in what I regarded as a
respectable and acceptable manner. It simply cannot be done. The means
by which the information has been buried greatly limits the way in which it
may be uncovered.
We have a tendency either to dismiss out of hand or to be amused by the
world of magic. If I am correct, every shaman in the ancient world from
New Zealand to Britain was able to see the distant future. They wrote us
letters across the ages, telling us of both wonderful and terrible events that
would occur when the new sun arose in Aquarius, prophecies covering the
years to come. They spoke to us in their language, in their way. Every form
of specialization tends to develop its own language or 'in-speak'; we need to
learn that 'in-speak' before we can begin to comprehend our subject.
Documents such as the Scrolls can only be understood with a poet's eye,
for they were written by visionaries, for whom reality is utterly different
from that conceived by the scientific mind.
Mythography did, a long time ago, see the common denominators in
worldwide legend and lore, and often expressed surprise at the appearance
of the same gods among cultures that most likely had no contact with each
other. We have assumed that these gods or heroes were at the centre of
religious belief and were worshipped by our 'primitive and superstitious'
ancestors. Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that our two
heroes, the Star/ Teacher and Sceptre, seem to account for a very large part
of ancient tradition, irrespective of its place of origin. The tree of
knowledge, too, is not restricted to Genesis. This universal temple appears
to be. indeed universal. The Christian cross is an adaptation of it.
Jesus had many characteristics in common with the Persian Mazda,
British King Arthur, Greek Hercules and South American Quetzalcouatl. It
is highly likely that, because of the similarity between the Nazarene and
Quetzalcouatl, Mormonism was founded on the belief that Jesus visited the

scholars have tended to temper these relationships with the old gods on the basis
that the very early Church must have retained a residue of the occult beliefs which
later it was at pains to extirpate.
But for the fact that the Qumran library was the product of pagan magi and that
the Church has always regarded these philosophies as the antithesis of its own
doctrine, the Dead Sea Scrolls would by now have become the most ancient and
sacred relics of Christendom.
In order that it might rid itself of this paganism, countless numbers of innocent
people were destroyed in witch-hunts and crusades. Perhaps there is a very hellish
kind of hell, filled with unimaginable tormenting demons, that these murderers may
eternally call their home.
In the following quotation from the Hymns Scroll, in which the Righteousness
Teacher is speaking, we can clearly see the fundamental hermeticism of these
writings. In Hymn 10 we encounter the universal tree with its enlightening fire (the
sun). From The Dead Sea Scrolls in English:
They shall send out a bud [for ever]*
like a flower [of the fields], and shall cause a shoot to grow
into the boughs of an everlasting Plant. It shall cover the whole [earth] with
its shadow
[and its crown] (shall reach) to the [clouds]; its roots (shall go down) to the
Abyss
[and all the rivers of Eden shall water its branches].
A source of light
shall become an eternal ever-flowing fountain, and in its bright flames
all the [sons of iniquity] shall be consumed...
This tree is the city New Jerusalem, the Ark of the Covenant and the temple of
God. In Matthew 21: 42-44 Jesus says:
Did ye never read in the scriptures? The stone which the builders rejected,
the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is
marvellous in our eyes?
* Brackets indicate lacunae (damaged or missing text) in the original scrolls.



THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from
you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on
whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
This statement compares with a passage at the end of the book of Daniel
(12: 9-10), where it is said that the Bible is to be sealed until the Last Days.
Upon the opening of the books — as in Revelation 5 — the righteous will
understand and will be saved, and the unrighteous will not, and will be
damned.
Three-dimensionally the tree is a cube and Coma is the 'head' of the
corner. The bright flames that consume the sons of iniquity constitute the
new sun which causes Coma/Christ to rise.
In Judges 6:11 the tree is an oak, and an angel sits beneath it. It is
located where Gideon threshes wheat (studies wisdom) by a winepress (of
the spirit) in secret. In verses 19-21 kid and unleavened cakes are prepared,
placed on a rock — obviously close to the oak — whereupon fire springs
up from the stone.
In column VIII of the Community Rule there are to be twelve men of a
council, and it is to be a 'precious corner stone'. Their tasks include the
punishment and destruction of evil.
One may see that those who believe the Teacher will be saved and those
who deny him will be lost. This transforms the concept of salvation from
'believe on me' to believe what I say. Jesus in his role as a god of salvation
disappears; he becomes a messenger bearing God's truth, which is itself the
true redemption.
In a later verse of Hymn 10 we find the following:
But I shall be as one who enters a fortified city...
In Revelation 21 the city had 'a light like unto a stone most precious'.
The verse in the Hymns continues:
For Thou wilt set the foundation on rock
and the framework by the measuring-cord of the sun;
And the tried stones [Thou wilt lay] by the plumb-line [of truth].
In Hymn 11 we learn that the Teacher's edifice is established upon a
rock, and he is placed in the branches of the Council of Holiness. He shines
as a seven-fold light. These are the planets



MYTHS, MIRACLES AND MISCONCEPTIONS 59
which are of significance to the temple and which in Revelation are the seven
branched candlestick. The tree is a working model of the universe in microcosm.
In Zechariah 3: 8 God will bring forth the 'BRANCH'; in verse 9 we have a stone
with seven eyes which removes iniquity in one day. In Revelation 5: 6 the
Teacher/Lamb/Jesus has seven eyes.
In Hymn 14 we have this universal concept summed up:
[For Thou didst set] a plantation
of cypress, pine, and cedar for Thy glory, trees of life beside a mysterious
fountain
hidden among the trees by the water, and they put out a shoot
of the everlasting Plant. But before they did so, they took root
and sent out their roots to the watercourse that its stem might be open to the
living waters
and be one with the everlasting spring.
In Scripture, water symbolizes the words of God. Thus the 'mysterious fountain'
is the Teacher's revelation of God's mysteries. This occurs when he sets the
cornerstone in the tree which draws its life source from these hidden waters, the
unconscious feminine.
As the hymn continues, we see this temple's relationship to that mentioned in
Daniel 4: 10ff., which is in the midst of the earth and which is hewn down, leaving
man to live like a beast.
In the Testament of Levi it is said of the Teacher (16: 3-4);
And a man who reneweth the Law, in the power of the Most High, ye shall
call a deceiver; and at last ye shall rush upon him to slay him, not knowing his
dignity, taking innocent blood through wickedness upon your heads. And your
holy places shall be laid waste because of him.
In Century 2: 51 Nostradamus says:
The blood of the just one shall be required of London, Burnt by fire in three
times twenty plus six. The ancient lady shall be brought down from her place,
And many sectarians [Christians] shall be killed.
These events cannot be too far into the future. In 2: 53 he says:



THE THIRTEENTH STONE
The great plague in the maritime city Shall not cease until the blood of the just
one, Condemned without crime, is avenged. The great lady is outraged...
Nostradamus goes on to tell us that it will appear that the gods
have sent fire from heaven. And all this is because (4: 24):
The faint voice of the holy lady is heard beneath the sacred
ground. A human flame [the sun in the throat] shines for the one with
the divine voice. The earth shall be dyed in blood And the wicked shall
destroy the holy temples.
Jesus the Teacher does not bring peace but a sword. In the Hymns the
Teacher continues:
And all [the beasts] of the forest
fed on its leafy boughs; its stem was trodden by all who passed on the way
and its branches by all the birds. And all the [trees] by the water rose above
it
for they grew in their plantation; but they sent out no root to the
watercourse.
This same concept is found in Luke 13: 19, in which a grain of
mustard seed grows to become a great tree. In the Sybilline Oracles
an exalted man comes from the skies and lays his hands on the
many-fruited tree.
Again, the Teacher says:
And the bud of the shoot of holiness
for the Plant of truth
was hidden and was not esteemed; And being unperceived,
its mystery was sealed.
We then have a covert allusion to the scriptural and non-scriptural myths where it
lies hidden. It goes on to say:



MYTHS, MIRACLES AND MISCONCEPTIONS 61
Thou didst hedge in its fruit, [O God], with the mystery of mighty
Heroes...
The text then goes on to affirm that those who turned their hand against
the everlasting bud were those who would be excluded from the kingdom
of heaven.
In Romans 8: 29 Jesus the Teacher is 'the firstborn among many
brethren', a spiritual creator.
Christians have believed that their doctrine being taught throughout the
world would be a sign of the end. This is based on the prophecy of
Matthew 24, which has a new meaning once we see it in a modern context.
First the Samson-like Teacher destroys the temple/church of which no
stone is left standing, that is to say he lays waste its wisdom by his
revelation of the mysteries.
Then, the many false prophets who came in his (Jesus') name correspond
to this idolatrous institution.
Then we have war and rumour of war, famine and pestilence. Thereupon
his followers are hated of all nations because of him; they are offended.
In Matthew 24: 14 we find that it is after this hero's gospel has been
preached throughout the world that the end comes.
The Hymns Scroll continues:
By my hand Thou hast opened for them
a well-spring and ditches. [that all their channels] may be laid out
according to a certain measuring-cord, and the planting of their trees
according to the plumb-line of the sun, that [their boughs may
become
a beautiful] Branch of glory.
Once again, these last three lines echo Numbers 24: 17, in which a Star
rises in Jacob and a Sceptre comes out of Israel. A stone (the sun) rises in
the throat of the tree, and a king (Sceptre) comes out of Coma's womb.
It is interesting to note that the mother of our Sceptre/Branch, our
English 'virgin', also 'Virgo', is in Latin 'virga', which means 'branch'. In
Revelation 12 this same woman is seen in heaven clothed with the sun and
stars, and she is with child.



62 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
But really we should make sense of what might otherwise seem
capricious. We are being told that those who believe the Teacher are saved
and those who do not are damned.
This appears to be echoed in Genesis, with Adam, Eve and the Serpent.
It seems that man must be confronted by the two spirits of truth and deceit,
and he must choose — a test in the evolutionary process of the human
spirit. In I Thessalonians 5: 2 Jesus the Teacher comes as a thief in the
night. He steals the Bible back from the Church and traditional Israel.
It now becomes possible for us to make complete sense of what have till
now been meaningless prophecies of Nostradamus. We shall deal with
'milk-white' in due course; the clay is a man.
Century 1: 21:
A white clay which is supported by a rock
Will come out of its depths milk-white.
In vain people will be troubled by it and fear to touch it...
The rock is the stone that the Teacher sets in the cosmic tree.
Nostradamus confirms the death of the prophet and affirms the idea of
spiritual evolution. 'The divine voice' is in Revelation 1: 15 a 'voice as the
sound of many waters'. Water is symbolic of God's word; thus he is His
messenger, nothing more.
Century 2: 27:
The divine voice shall be struck by heaven And he will not be able to
go any further. His secret is hidden in his revelation For people who
will go on ahead.
In Century 2: 13 the body with no soul is the idol Jesus, the god who was
worshipped rather than the actual Teacher he represents:
The body with no soul no longer the sacrifice. The day of death is the
day of rebirth. The divine spirit will cause the soul to rejoice, The
eternity of the word shall be seen.
The idol Jesus, as I have said, is based upon the Teacher who must
destroy it and its idolatry. So he must kill his image to be



MYTHS, MIRACLES AND MISCONCEPTIONS 63
born. Hence the day of death is the day of rebirth. The end of Jesus worship is
confirmed in Century 3: 94:
For five hundred years more they will serve him
Who is the idol of his age.
Then suddenly there shall be a great revelation of the light
Which will make people of that time well contented.
Nostradamus says the revelation will come suddenly; in Scripture it is said that
even Jesus does not know the hour of his coming. In 2: 70 the whole matter is
confirmed:
The dart [perhaps comet] of heaven will make its circuit.
Death while speaking...
The stone in the tree and the fierce shall be humbled...
This 'stone in the tree' is that mentioned in Matthew 24: 30: 'And then shall
appear the sign of the son of man in heaven.' This sign is Coma. In Proverbs 9:1 she
is Wisdom, who has built a house hewn from seven stone pillars, the ancient stone
circle.
From the little I can comprehend of Nostradamus, the Teacher is shot in the head
(the dart/comet of heaven) while speaking to a crowd. According to the Scrolls the
killing of this prophet is done by an agent of the Wicked Priest, of whom I shall
speak in due course. In the Commentary on Nahum 2: 12 we read:
Interpreted, this concerns the furious young lion [who executes revenge] on
those who seek smooth things and hangs men alive, [a thing never done]
formerly in Israel. Because of a man hanged alive on [the] tree, He proclaims,
'Behold I am against [you, says the Lord of Hosts'].
This clearly refers to the Sceptre, who is the young lion, exacting revenge for the
death of Jesus the Teacher, who is not hanged upon the tree but dies because of it.
The Lion has clearly found the religionists responsible and slaughters them by
hanging; thus they are accursed of God. It is an ironic act with a double meaning.
They kill the Teacher because of the tree; therefore they must die because of it, and
upon it. After all, along with John the Baptist, these men must be like brothers
which is exactly how Nostradamus refers to them.



64 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
This Teacher comes into the world preceded by a reputation the like of
which has never been known. Is it because he is a hero who must single
handedly take on the world? I think not. We see his task in Century 1: 96:
A man will oversee the destruction Of churches and sects which are
filled with fantasy. He shall harm the stones but not the living, With
great speech he shall fill their ears.
His preceding reputation, which makes him the greatest legendary figure
of all time, is there to give him authority. His task, after all, is not only to
destroy false religion but to signal the apocalypse and act as midwife to the
New Jerusalem. And after his death there is no cult: he is forgotten. His
reward is in heaven. Though, Josephus tells us (Wars 2,8,9), the Essenes
esteemed their Lawgiver-Moses/Teacher as a divine hero.
At the end of Hymn 14 of the Hymns Scroll, this Revealer of Mysteries
gives us a few clues about himself:
...for my father knew me not
and my mother abandoned me to Thee.
Just preceding this:
For Thou hast known me from [the time of] my father,
[and hast chosen me] from the womb. [From the belly of] my mother
Thou hast dealt kindly with me, and from the breast of her who
conceived me
have Thy mercies been with me. [Thy grace was with me] in the lap
of her who reared me,
and from my youth Thou hast illumined me
with the wisdom of Thy judgement.
As with Jesus, so with the Passover: Moses' birth (Exodus 2) comes amid
Pharaoh's slaughter of the male children of the Hebrews. His mother set
him in a basket on a river in allegorical Egypt. Thus it may be said by
Moses 'My mother abandoned me to Thee'. It is noticeable in the above that
the Teacher, like Moses, was raised by a woman other than his mother.
Moses means 'drawer out': he draws out the mysteries from Scripture. In
Egyptian it means 'saved



MYTHS, MIRACLES AND MISCONCEPTIONS 65
of water'. Likewise, 'Messiah' is from Messeh, the Holy Crocodile. The
bullrushes story was lifted straight out of that of the origins of Sargon I of
Babylonia. Like the Teacher, Moses was a scribe of righteousness and a
suffering servant waiting upon the Lord.
Throughout the Hymns we find a man of sinful flesh, not a god, whom
God has called out. Millennia before he is born, his praises are being sung
throughout the world. Apart from the heroes so far mentioned, he is
Adonis, who was a giant world-tree upon which grew grain-wisdom. He is
Bacchus and the Polynesian Maui, who caught the sun in a net and then
raised the fish-shaped north island of New Zealand as a ready-populated
new world. He led the people out of the overcrowded Hawaiiki, and then
found time to appear in Australia as Lightning Man. It's no wonder Jesus'
ministry was so short: he was busy with all his other incarnations.
Our two heroes figure very prominently in many creation epics. To
understand these myths we need to do exactly with them as we have done
with Scripture, which is to set their termination in the present. According to
this formula, the Age of Aquarius is the day of rest of the seven days of
creation. The Star/Teacher then becomes 'First Man' whose seed or
spermatozoa is knowledge. There is then some interaction between him and
the Goddess, Coma. The Sceptre/King is often the son of this pair. To
augment the list of characters we then find roles being played by the sun
and often Saturn/Chronos, the ruling planet of Aquarius. The serpent,
which, as I have said, sits entwined at the base of the tree, also makes reg
ular appearances, as do the things of the sea, the watery womb of the
Goddess. Stones seem to be the means by which men communicated with
her.
Megalithic stone circles were built throughout the ancient world. In
western New South Wales, Australia, for example, one site is so similar to
its counterpart in Britain that it is known as Bathurst Stonehenge. The
object of these megaliths was to tap the energies within this watery womb
of Mother Earth. They sit upon dragon paths which are found in every
corner of the globe.
In Matthew 16: 18 we find a famous pun which has been noted many
times. We only need know that the Greek for 'stone' is 'petra'; from this we
derive the English 'petrify' and 'Peter'. The verse reads:
And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build
my church.



66 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Peter was Simon Peter (Matthew 4: 18). Simon in Hebrew means
'hearing'; hence he is the hearing stone, which upon the tree is Coma. It is
such because it is that from which the gods speak. This apostle was also
called Cephas. This term is applied to the head of the Qumran community,
the cornerstone. In Aramaic 'ketha' is a rock and 'kethir' is a lion (the sun).
In Galatians 2: 9, James, Cephas and John are said to be pillars, perhaps
the pillars of stone we find in circles like Stonehenge. Allegro in The Dead
Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth (page 177) sees in Peter, as the
'standing one', the correlation of the Hebrew 'ammud' ('pillar'), from the
root 'amad' ('stand'), a standing stone. On page 181 he points out that the
verb to 'dip' or 'baptize' in the spoken dialect is 'amad'. Thus John the
Baptist might be said to be the standing stone. John in Greek is Ioannes,
from the earlier-mentioned god Oannes, who was part-fish and part-man.
Simon Peter was Bar-Jona, son of Jona. Another Jona was swallowed by a
'great [wisdom] fish'. Allegro suggests that Bar-Jona is a word play on
'baryona', divination (page 220). He also finds that Jacob has its origins in
the Sumerian IA-A-GUB, meaning 'standing stone' and implying that Israel
is created from a stone.
In Exodus 13: 21-22 we learn:
And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to
lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light;
to go by day and night:
He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire
by night, from before the people.
The Glory cloud was the Shekinah, the Hebrew Sophia. In Exodus 33: 9
Moses is in the tabernacle/tree, the pillar of cloud descends and the Lord
speaks to him. There was no historical wandering in the desert. It is done by
lost souls in the spiritual wasteland at the end of Pisces.
In Exodus 28:10 the names of the tribes of Israel are to be engraved upon
two stones, one being the Star/Teacher, the other the Sceptre/King or the
sun (Joseph) and Coma (Ephraim). Moses came down to the Israelites
having received ten commandments (Exodus 34) written upon these same
two stones.
In Genesis 49 the tribes are given their designations — as I take it to be
— as the signs of the zodiac upon the tree when they are blessed by Jacob.
Logically, they constitute a stone circle. But we



MYTHS, MIRACLES AND MISCONCEPTIONS 67
need not press the point at this juncture, for we are as yet still in the
introductory stages of this essay.
Peter, the rock upon which the Church is to be built, is then a stone one
can hear as it speaks. Simon Peter is surnamed Bar-Jonah, meaning son of
Johanan, which makes him the son of Oannes, or the hearing stone of the
Fisher King. Peter's occupation is that of a fisherman (Matthew 4:18). In
verse 19 Jesus tells Peter and Andrew to follow him and he will make them
fishers of men.
Hard on the heels of this pair come the brothers James and John, who are
also fishermen. They abandon father and boat to follow the Nazarene.
What we are looking at here is the little-known esoteric elements of
Scripture.
Accordingly, in Matthew 7 there begins a brief cycle in which we are
told (verse 8) that 'he that seeketh findeth'. The New Testament is quite
generously peppered with this type of statement. John seems quite fond of
'He that hath an ear, let him hear'. Quite clearly it is intended to draw
attention to the fact that much more is said than what may at first appear.
This reinforces my argument that the Bible was an outer garment of popular
religion represented in Genesis by the two aprons (Old and New
Testaments) which covered the genitalia of the cosmic temple. In Matthew
7: 9-10 we have the earlier-mentioned exhortation that if your son asks for
bread, give him a stone, and if he asks for fish, give him a serpent.
This leads us to the tree that brings forth good fruit and that which brings
forth bad. And from this we go into the story of the wise man who built his
house upon a rock and the fool who built his on sand. They are both one
and the same. One is the Piscean tree with ten orbs, the other is that of
eleven orbs with its cornerstone. But it is the root, the Triple-Headed
Goddess, that is the Bible's primary concern.
Though there is no support for the notion in Scripture, Mary Magdalene
has come to be known as a prostitute. Allegro suggests her name means
'hairdresser', it being a Graecized form of the Hebrew. I propose she is a
sacred prostitute. We find that in the life of Jesus there are three prominent
women. One is Mary his mother. The others help comprise the three
elements of the Triple-Headed Goddess, and thus are one. Basically, they
represent Jesus' mother, his wife and the hag that buries him. Our first clue
is found in Luke 7: 38, where an unnamed woman wipes Jesus' feet with
her hair. Under the circumstances we must see this as significant.
According to Luke she is a 'fallen woman'. Christian tradition has



68 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
come to think of her as being one with Mary Magdalene. Scriptur-ally
speaking, this is incorrect. It was she who first witnessed the empty tomb
when the stone was rolled away. It was also she to whom Jesus first
revealed his resurrection. The third is Mary of Bethany, who is the sister of
Martha and Lazarus.
The women in Jesus' life are few; however, three of them are called
'Mary'. This name appears seven times in the New Testament, thereby
giving it a divine number. Mary of Bethany seems likely to be the wife of
Jesus, whom he marries at the wedding in Cana. Here the bride and groom
are unnamed. Jesus' mother is present and seems aware of her son's ability
to perform miracles even though his time has not yet come. In this instance,
both Mary and her fishy offspring behave more like hosts than guests. In
the role of hostess Mary instructs her son to produce more wine. This
becomes his first miracle, which reduces his magical powers to the level of
divine caterer.
The miracle performed was to turn water into wine, to raise the Christ
from the waters of the womb of life. Thus, with the three Marys, the Triple
Headed Goddess, Jesus can raise the Holy Spirit, which is symbolized as
wine in the marriage feast of the temple/ tree/New Jerusalem. The primary
message in this story is found in the statement made by the governor of the
feast when, in John 2: 10, he says:
Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have
well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until
now.
That is to say that in the marriage feast of the New Jerusalem, the good
wine (the Teacher's revelation of the real Christianity) comes at the end, not
the beginning.
In John 11: 2, contrary to tradition, it is the Bethanian (the wife) who
wiped Jesus' feet with her hair. This story is repeated in John 12: 3. The
mythmakers have, in this instance, confused the roles of these women to
establish they are one. In verse 7 the carpenter's son says of Mary's
anointing him:
Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.
Hence she is the hag that buries him. But here the significance shifts to
Lazarus, who would seem to be a John the Baptist.



MYTHS, MIRACLES AND MISCONCEPTIONS 69
Lazarus in the Gospel of John is the man that Jesus raised from the dead.
He is also a much beloved disciple, though not counted among the twelve.
In John 12: 9 the people have come as much to see Lazarus as to see the
Nazarene. In verse 10 the chief priests are plotting to kill him.
The apostle John also has the status of much beloved. There is no
evidence — mythically speaking — to deny that Lazarus and the apostle
John are one and that they may be John the Baptist.
Lazarus also appears in Luke 16, a beggar who dies and is in the bosom
of Abraham. Here, a rich man in hell requests that Lazarus is sent to
witness to his wealthy family that they may not make the same mistake as
himself.
Seen from the point of view of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Teacher's
arrival among the community of the Baptist might be termed a raising of
John from the dead.
The word plays and puns are endless, yet such is the framework of the
Scriptures and the basic message of Jesus that it has often been remarked
that his philosophy and teachings were at least two thousand years ahead of
their time. But this too seems to be answered here. The fact is, they were.
At the end of Matthew chapter 7 we are told that the people were
astonished at his teaching, and this deserves comment.
If we for a moment forget about hidden meanings, the only extraordinary
aspects of an historical Jesus are his miracles. His radical standpoint was a
gospel of love and forgiveness. While as a philosopher he may have been
rare, he would not have been the first or have been alone, especially in a
Palestine exposed to Greek philosophy and tradition. It is actually his
revelation of mysteries that is astonishing.
If we take this doctrine of fish and trees and stones, and set it in the
future, if we multiply what I have found by at least a thousandfold, then we
certainly have a startling revelation.
As mentioned earlier, I Thessalonians 5: 2 says:
For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as
a thief in the night.
This theme is continued in 2 Peter and Revelation. It seems intended to
convey the idea not only of 'when you least expect it', but also of 'in a way
you least expect it'. Basically, the Teacher steals the inheritance. As part
fish part-man, he comes out of the Piscean



70 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
sea and takes the world by surprise. Having sat silently at the bottom of
this ocean of the unconscious, the merman rises up out of the watery word
of God with a pearl of great price.
Because they are from the sea, pearls have come to be associated with
wisdom, and because they are stone-like jewels it is logical that they should
figure in the sayings of Jesus. In Matthew 7: 6 we are told not to cast pearls
before swine. In Matthew 13: 45-46 the kingdom of heaven is likened to a
pearl of great price which the merchant sold everything to buy. In
Revelation 21: 21 the new Jerusalem — the new tree — has twelve pearls,
which are the gates of the city.
The concept of pearls being stones is global. For example in the tradition
of Japanese Shintoism this jewel plays a special role as a sacred stone
guarded by the virgin daughter of the Mikado. It is the sacred 'tama' which
is hidden away in the holy sanctuary behind the stone gate. 'Mi-tama'
means soul double, the spirit that dwells within, and 'ko-dama' is a tree
spirit. 'Mi' is an honorific prefix which originally had the meaning of
'snake-dragon'. These being his attributes, both the snake and the dragon
are symbolic of the sun. 'Tama-mono' is a precious gift, and tama also
refers to a precious stone.
The Providor Goddess was Uka No Mi-Tama, and the tama pearl
contained the essence of the Great Mother. This particular gem was one of
a number of precious stones — probably thirteen in all — that made up the
lost necklace of Shinshi; being a necklace it most likely contained the stone
of the sun. It is not of little significance that the Shinto Mecca or Rome was
Ise (phonetically similar to 'Jesus'), and the gateway by which one entered it
was called the two rocks of Ise — Coma and the sun. The chief deity at this
site was Ama-terasu, the goddess of the sun. The city also had a grain
(wisdom) goddess, called Toyouke-hime. The Shi Tenno were spirit beasts
who guarded the cardinal points of the temple: the dragon (sun) sat to the
east and the black tortoise (Scorpio) to the north; the red bird (Aquarius)
guarded the south and the white (albino) tiger (a cat) kept watch over the
west — Coma.
Back at the beginning of Matthew 13 Jesus is sitting by the sea. A
multitude gathers, and he boards a ship and speaks to them in parables. In
these early chapters of Matthew we seem bound to the things of the watery
deep. In chapter 12 verse 39 the only sign of the prophet's coming is to be
the sign of Jonah, who was swallowed by a whale, a seagoing mammal or
wisdom fish. In the first



MYTHS, MIRACLES AND MISCONCEPTIONS 71
parable he speaks of the seed that fell on stony ground and that which fell
on fertile soil. In Matthew 13: 5-6 we read:
Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and
forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:
And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they
had no root, they withered away.
The meaning of this statement changes completely when set in the
future. He is obviously speaking here of the tree restored. But, of at least
equal significance, he is referring to the kind of reaction one would expect
at the Teacher's revelations. A very large number of people would initially
be enthusiastic, and then fall away. It is the sun coming up that causes the
withering. The teaching proves too technical. It is ultimately seen to be a
complex science rather than a religion. Along comes the Teacher's
revelation, and many fall enthusiastically upon the stone and just as quickly
are confounded by the complexities.
The seed that falls on fertile ground takes much longer to grow, for, as I
have said, it is a complex science. Many are called but few are chosen. It is
highly significant here that Jesus' revelation is popularized. He is, in fact,
scornful of the Scribes and Pharisees of the time, and actually excludes
them. He would not act towards them in this way, and they would not want
to silence him, unless he threatened their position. In a modern context,
scholars and religious professionals (Scribes and Pharisees) would be, to
say the least, highly miffed at the appearance of this upstart, who clearly is
a threat to them.
The disciples want to know why Jesus speaks in parables. He tells them
that, while it is given to them to know 'the mysteries of the kingdom of
heaven', it is not given to the many. Of him that received in stony ground
without a root, Jesus says in Matthew chapter 13, verse 21:
Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for then
tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is
offended.
The Teacher's revelation is clearly offensive to many. Thus his followers
are persecuted, their faith is tried. And this takes no account of the political
implications of this revelation.



72 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
The next parable is logically that of the wheat and tares, wisdom and
foolishness. At its conclusion, in Matthew 13: 30, we are told that mankind
is to be harvested:
Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I
will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind
them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
At the termination of this cycle there is the story of the grain of mustard
seed, which is the least among seeds, but when grown it is the 'greatest
among herbs' and becomes a great tree. After six days of labour this tree of
life is destined to bear fruit in the sabbatical Age of Aquarius.
The concept being presented is one in which mankind is forced to make a
choice — I shall demonstrate the global aspects as we progress. Then God
decides who shall live and who shall die. It seems a question of separating
the poets from the idolators. Those who are bound to strictly material
religious concepts will obviously regard the revelation of these hidden
mysteries as the ultimate heresy. Those with no religion as such, who see
the world strictly in materialistic terms, will ignore the messenger and
regard him as just another modern religious fanatic in a time of change. But
it is his destiny to be hated and excluded.
This new humanity will be made up of those with poetry in their souls,
whose response will be an intuitive 'Yes, of course: it explains everything'.
In the biblical book of Habbakuk God says that He will work a wonder and
that we will not believe it when told. In other words, the entire process is
one in which God is separating those with left-brained (masculine) minds
from the unified, single-minded realistic poets. This seems to me to be
epitomized in the concept of the six days of creation and the Aquarian day
of rest. This too has been allegorized in the New Testament.
The sabbath is a day given by God to the people as one in which no work
is to be done and the day to be spent in the study of the Law. In this respect
chapter 12 of Matthew begins with an amusing play on words:
At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his
disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to
eat.



MYTHS, MIRACLES AND MISCONCEPTIONS 73
The Pharisees accuse him and his disciples of labouring on the sabbath.
The corn is wisdom, and the Master and his initiates are, by plucking the
corn, fulfilling the sabbath law. In verses 3-4 our hero defends his action by
drawing attention to David, who entered the house of God (the tree) and ate
the shewbread. In verse 7 he says:
But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
David ate the Temple bread at a time of famine. As we shall see, he is
another version of the Teacher, and his consuming the sacred repast is his
learning the mysteries of Scripture as they pertain to the temple/tree. Yet
again, believing the revelation is itself salvation.
In Matthew 10: 26-27 we have yet another allusion that something is
hidden and Jesus is the revealer, the corn god who casts his bread upon the
waters of wisdom. We are told there is nothing covered that shall not be
revealed, and hid that shall not be known. What he teaches his disciples in
secret, they must shout from the rooftops. In verse 34 it is clear that he is to
be at variance with traditional thinking, for he comes not to bring peace but
a sword.
It is then that we see again this evolutionary factor. Son will be set
against mother; any that love their father or mother above him are not
worthy of him. Individuals will be called out to leave the old world behind
and find their loved ones in this new humanity. The dead are to be left to
bury their dead.
In Matthew 14 Jesus has been preaching to the multitude; evening is
come and they must eat. The disciples can muster only five loaves of bread
and two fishes. These are the seven sacred planets. When all have eaten
their fill, the disciples gather twelve baskets of remnant food, which are the
twelve signs of the zodiac. All that remains is the wisdom of the stars.
I would remind the reader that upon the tree there are twelve tribes of
Israel, which are stones, but there is also a thirteenth. Libra/Levi sits upon
the earth; Levi is a tribe but does not have status as such. They are the
priests, who are supported by a levy and minister to the people. So it is that,
though we add Coma to the twelve, we remove Libra, the balance, from the
thirteen and it becomes the hub of two wheels of flaming circles of stones,
which I shall deal with in a later section.



74 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
This miracle of loaves and fishes is repeated in the next chapter, where
the fish are of relatively little significance: there are seven loaves and a
'few' fishes. After all have eaten, seven basketfuls remain, having fed four
thousand men. Seven and four are eleven, and there are eleven orbs on the
tree. The two miracles are one; the tree has seven planets, twelve signs and
eleven sephiroth.
In Matthew 16: 5-6 the disciples have forgotten to take bread, and are
warned by Jesus of the leaven of the Pharisees. The point is driven home to
the disciples in respect of Jesus' bread. He reminds them again of the five
loaves that fed five thousand, 5 + 5 = 10-orbed tree. And the seven loaves
that fed four thousand, 7 + 4 = 11-orbed tree. It is these eleven orbs that are
the keys to the kingdom of heaven in Matthew 16: 19.
In Matthew 14: 25 Jesus walks upon the sea. Thus he is Oannes, an
amphibian man. Only a man who is part fish could walk on water (stand
upon the word of God). When we look at these stories at a deeper level we
shall find an association between this story and that of the miraculous
draught of 153 fishes in the net.
In Job 12: 8 it is said:
...and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
According to II Chronicles 33: 14, Manasseh built a wall on the west
side of the Temple as far as the fish gate, which then is in Taurus.
Therefore it is through Taurus that Oannes is manifest, the Teacher arises.
This gate, along with the bull, is on the west wall of the tree.
In Matthew 16 Jesus is showing frustration with his disciples, who refuse
to understand. We first are told that the only sign given of the coming of the
Teacher is the sign of Jonah, who spent three days in the belly of a whale
— obviously being instructed in the mysteries of fishers and the sea. This
statement is then contradicted in Matthew 24: 30, where the sign given is
that of the Son of man in heaven. But there is no contradiction because,
instructed by the Oannes, he has found the witch star. And the thirteenth
stone is like him, in the Virgin of the night sky.
In Numbers 11: 22 all the fish of the sea are to be gathered to suffice
Israel. The Lord then sets His spirit upon the seventy elders who begin to
prophesy. Two of them (the Star and Baptist) begin to do so within the
camp, which Joshua (the Sceptre) son of Nun says is forbidden. In Hebrew
'nun' means 'fish'.



MYTHS, MIRACLES AND MISCONCEPTIONS 75
In Matthew 18 Jesus tells us that we may only enter the kingdom of
heaven as little children. But again we find the double meaning that we
come upon time and again. Verse 6 reads:
But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it
were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and
that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
The millstone around his neck is the sun, and the depth of the sea is
where he would find the Oannes, or mer-man Merlin, and the magi to
instruct him in the arts of magic, he who in verse 11 has 'come to save that
which was lost' — the cosmic tree.
Many have questioned the impetuous act of Jesus in cursing the fig tree
that gave no fruit, the tree with ten orbs. This is followed with a reference
to Daniel's stone that became a mountain, which Jesus tells his disciples
they have power to cast into the sea. In other words the power to move
mountains is the power to move stones.
Without the tree and its cybernetic thirteenth stone these stories are no
more than poetic licence. But set them in a future context and we have a
marvellous epic come to life. It becomes the living flesh of the never
ending story, a book of high adventure and living hope. The Scriptures
portray a vision from the future, echoing in the past and now reverberating
in the present.
In Matthew 24:14-15 it is said:
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.
When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him
understand:)
This danger is from the pangs and throes of the Great Earth-mother as
she births the Great Messiah and the children of the new age: a balanced
humanity.
At the end of Matthew chapter 22 (verses 43-45) Jesus asks how it is that
the Messiah is the son of David when David in spirit calls him Lord. This
raises a very important question. The central theme of Scripture is a
temporal king from the house of David. In the New Testament, Jesus is that
fulfilment. But he did not claim his earthly crown, and, as history tells us,
the Sceptre did pass from between the nation's feet, or so it seems.



76 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
To further complicate matters, David historically did not exist. Like the
Teacher, and in the fashion of Merlin, he is not a king but a king-maker.
What then is meant by this most central of all Israel's ambitions, that they
should have a monarch from their royal house? This cannot possibly refer
to an actual descendant through a bloodline. If he lived, he did so more
than three thousand years ago. Our evidence shows this to be impossible in
the strictly traditional sense.
David has far more in common with the Teacher than simply the casting
of a stone. He had seven older brothers (the planets) and two sisters (Coma
and the moon). Where the Teacher's mother abandoned him to God, this
stone-thrower in Scripture simply does not have a mother. There is no
mention of who she is.
Like the Teacher, though he loved God and his fellow man, the giant
killer was a constant sinner. Like Jesus, he had a close friend in Jonathan,
with whom he entered into a covenant of God. Both he and the Revealer of
Mysteries left behind them books of psalms, and this point is not
insignificant, for these clearly show the relationship between the two.
In the ancient world it was the priests who chose the king, at first from
among themselves; much later on the priest or Druid was the power behind
the throne, the Overseer.
David means 'beloved'. The beloved of God were the magi. By his
revelation, the latter-day monarch is chosen by the Teacher, who is the first
of the new magi. Thus the Sceptre is the first of the priest kings, from the
house of David, the beloved. The blood sacrifice for the new humanity is
this Jesus-type first man, who is spoken of in the New Testament as the
pascal lamb. The idea of the sacrifice of the first born — the Teacher as the
first of many — is a very powerful one and it runs throughout the Bible.
The Passover festival is established in chapter 12 of Exodus. It celebrates
the bringing out of Egypt of the children of Israel. But basically it is not a
feast that harks back; rather is it a celebration of this initiator leading the
New Israel out of bondage in modern Babylon. Similarly, the Last Supper,
when Jesus is betrayed, is intended primarily to identify him as that
firstborn pascal lamb. In the Scrolls, after his death he is not a divinity. He
is remembered and reverenced as Moses and as the sacrificial white lamb
without blemish eaten at the Passover, which is a prophecy of Scripture
based upon a celebration that will take place in the future.
At the last supper Jesus is circumspect about himself. The bread to be
eaten is unleavened — literally the plain truth, unadulterated



MYTHS, MIRACLES AND MISCONCEPTIONS 77
wisdom. In Matthew 26: 26-28 he tells his disciples to take and eat the
bread which is his body, and drink the wine which is his blood of the new
covenant. Without an alternative meaning, this renders Christianity
cannibalistic. Such would be the case in eating his body and drinking his
blood. My point is that we are, above all, being encouraged to think
symbolically. His body is wisdom and his blood is the spirit of Christ
which generates it. The last supper celebrates the acceptance of his teaching
by Israel.
In Exodus 12 God tells Moses that the children of Israel must smear the
blood of the pascal lamb upon their doorposts. In verse 12 God is to come
that night and strike dead all the firstborn males of the allegorical
Egyptians. He will 'pass-over' those houses that have blood (the blood of
the lamb) smeared on their doorposts. This, superficially, is a complete
nonsense. It suggests that God would not otherwise recognize His people.
This blood is thus the menses of Coma/Christ, the blood of grapes
spiritual wisdom. Thus God will save the wise and smite the fools. This
menstrual emission seems to flow in between ages, at the end of each Great
Month of the Great Year of 25,920 years.
It is at this symbolic point that the forty-year sojourn in the wilderness
begins. In Matthew 2: 16 Herod sees that he is 'mocked of the magi' and
proceeds with the same slaughter of infants in Bethlehem. Thus the birth of
the Sceptre — his manifestation — symbolizes the start of Israel's forty
years in the wilderness. Interestingly, in these circumstances, Mary, Joseph
and Jesus (Coma, the sun and the Sceptre) are leaving for Egypt just as
Moses is about to depart.
In his numerous preceding incarnations in the ancient myths, the Teacher
has been seen variously as a corn god, tree god, fertility god and sun god.
Here in the Last Supper, more than in any other of these allegorical stories,
he is presented as the mage surrounded by his zodiac of apostles dispensing
a miraculous and soul-saving revelation of profound mysteries.
It is at the last supper that Judas's betrayal of Jesus is uncovered. This
traitor is much maligned, but without him the sun god could not die to be
born again.
These stories were created for mass appeal, particularly in Rome. For this
reason, even the role of Pilate is played down. The Romans cannot be
completely blamed for the crucifixion.
On page 185 of The White Goddess,12 Robert Graves says that the
thirteenth tree is the elder, a tree living by the waterside which is



78 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
associated with witches. It keeps its fruit well into December. An old
British superstition says that a child laid in an elderwood cradle would pine
away or might even be pinched black and blue by the fairies — the
traditional wood for cradles is the birch, which is said to drive away evil
spirits. Graves says that in Ireland elder sticks, instead of ashen ones, are
supposed to be used by witches as magic horses. He refers to Langland's
Piers Plowman, in which Judas hangs himself upon an elder tree. In the
lunar calendar, the thirteenth month is given to the elder. The period runs
from 25 November to the winter solstice on 22 December.
The number thirteen has always been a source of fear and superstition.
Even today, in the United States, multi-storeyed buildings do not have a
thirteenth floor. A Friday the thirteenth is supposed to be a day for
accidents and misfortune. And, no doubt, everyone will remember what
happened to Apollo 13. Friday is the day given to Frigga, to whom fish
were sacred, and for whom thirteen was the lucky number for menstruation.
Unperceived but living, the Goddess is thought to be a danger. She resides
in and presides over the realm of the dead, and so is feared: a logical
explanation for fear of this onerous day, but it likely goes back much
further than that.
There is a tradition that Scorpio was the thirteenth sign of the zodiac. We
shall go on to see that this is universal, and seems always to be associated
with dark forces. Like the idea of a true and false Israel, we also find a true
and false thirteenth sign. For instance, in India the man-eagle of the north
was Garuda; his Japanese counterpart was Gario the woman-crane.
If we count the signs around the tree in a figure eight, starting at Leo and
going down the left side to Coma and then up to Cancer and down the right
side, we find Scorpio sits at position number thirteen; and Scorpio, which
sits at the north side of the temple, is associated with death. It is highly
likely that, in the dim and distant past when priests ruled the tribes, these
traditions were woven into the feast days of the populace, which must have
been kept separate from those of the priests. Most likely the traditions and
superstitions had to be seeded, as did the religions. But the truth was a
secret pending the Teacher's revelation. Apart from running the alphabet
around the zodiac, the apostles have many tasks to perform. In the case of
Judas he receives thirty pieces of silver (the moon) for his betrayal.
This indicates a lunar (silver) division of the year into thirteen months.
His betraying the sun for silver brings him down one



MYTHS, MIRACLES AND MISCONCEPTIONS 79
position to that of the moon. Most importantly, when the apostles set out to
replace him, they have two candidates to choose from. Thus without Jesus
and Judas they are down to eleven signs. With two candidates they again
number thirteen.
Had this myth originated in Britain, Jesus would have somehow been
betrayed by a Robin Redbreast who on the extra day of the thirteen-month
year kills the Gold Crest Wren — most likely on Christmas Eve. The sun's
death caused by lunar betrayal.
To conclude this initial, superficial look at the Teacher and the message
he is likely to bring, I refer back to an earlier statement. Not only will there
be a separation of religionists from poets, the non-religious materialists
whose god is money will also be targeted. The Teacher is called 'righteous'
because he upholds the scriptural law, one element of which forbids the
lending of money at interest (Exodus 22: 25 and Deuteronomy 23: 19).
Thus, this Teacher must be critical of the modern financial system. This is
beautifully expressed in Matthew 21: 12, Mark 11: 15 and John 2: 15,
where Jesus overturns the tables of the moneychangers. But he does this in
a modern society where, as with Judas, money is a god; the action in
Scripture thus takes place in the Temple.
The Piscean world has grown up with a miracle-working son of God who
now is more remote than he ever was. When we begin to understand what
we are actually being told, we do not destroy a god: we bring to real life a
man, an ordinary man of flesh and blood who seems to be given a task that
none would envy. Once we dispose of the idol we find someone for whom
it is possible to feel love and compassion. The Scriptures and the Scrolls
give us a hint of how this character is in one respect most fortunate, for he
is chosen of God. Yet his loneliness is manifest. Who but Hercules or Jesus
or any other of his heroic incarnations could perform his task? As both
Hercules and Jesus he must destroy himself to be born. He must empower
King Arthur to draw the sword from the stone. As Gilgamesh he must raise
the star that fell from heaven and do battle with the monster of the land of
the cut-down cedar.
Jesus the miracle-working Righteousness Teacher cures the blind of their
spiritual blindness, and the spiritually lame he causes to walk upright. He
cleanses lepers of doctrines that rot the soul, and the deaf hear the truth.
The spiritually dead find new life in his word, and the poor receive from
him the treasure of the Holy Grail. He raises the sun in the tree and opens
Coma's womb from which, by his word, the world is made new.



80 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
In Matthew 11: 6 he says:
And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.
In verse 25:
I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these
things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.
They are hidden from the masculine academic and revealed to poets.
The influence of these documents has through the centuries been far
reaching. How potent and powerful the minds which first shaped them! It is
all done with cold, hard, powerful purpose. This all goes far beyond a game
of hiding a stone and a tree in a book: behind these stories is stark, harsh
reality. The revelations of the Teacher are a method of separating the wheat
from the chaff: to gather the dinosaurs and destroy them. And all this sits
on the shoulders of one man. He carries the burden entirely alone; single
handed he changes history; he establishes Israel's dominance and
government. These right-brained, left-handed priests are in Exodus 19: 4-6
a 'peculiar treasure':
Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles'
wings, and brought you unto myself.
Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant,
then ye shall be peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is
mine:
And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation...
Conclusion
The Teacher of the Qumran Scrolls has as his source of revelation the cosmic tree.
Nostradamus has shown us that this is a future event. This messenger is a man, not a
god. Inasmuch as we have seen that the miracles attributed to Jesus have a poetic
and cabalistic explanation, we now have some conception of the type of mysteries
to be revealed and can grasp the idea of Jesus being a mythologized Teacher. For
example, rain (water) falls from heaven, and is thus the word of God. The wise man
lives within this divine teaching and is therefore half man and half fish.



MYTHS, MIRACLES AND MISCONCEPTIONS 81
Jesus' walking on water is thus a poetic way of saying he walks in and stands upon
the word of God.
I am now beginning to introduce the theme that what has been interpreted as
religion was really a further step in human evolution. Once again, we are taking
these events out of the past and setting them in the immediate future. Central to this
is the idea that Jesus the Teacher of Righteousness is an ordinary man in an
extraordinary situation. As often as not I shall turn to Scripture for confirmation of
this. For example, in John 14: 12 we find an echo of the Scrolls when Jesus himself
points out that he is only the first of many, and that the apostles will do greater
things than he:
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do
shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto
my Father.
This conveys the idea that the passing of time will increase spiritual power, as in
the blessing of Reuben (Aquarius) in Genesis 49: 3-4:
Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength,
the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: Unstable as water,
thou shalt not excel...
In the Scrolls this process is described as 'the diminishing times of Darkness'.
Since we are at the point of entering Aquarius, I contend that the present time is
the end of the sixth day of creation, and it is logical that there must now be a harvest
with which the new world is seeded.
As I have said, the meaning behind Israel's desire for a king from the house of
David is that the choosing of the king is to be done by magi, as in the ancient
tradition. We shall see that this story is universal. It will become apparent that the
ancient traditions that later became religions are a sort of spiritual intelligence test
set by the Teacher. Passing the test cancels all previous error (sin); thus Jesus' word
becomes the salvation. In this sense, Christ may be seen in relation to Mother
Nature, who is constantly forcing her creations to evolve. Man's survival skills
being invested in his large brain, it is this which evolution must test, not only for
man's individual capacity for survival (the masculine), but for his ability to live with
his fellows and in harmony with nature (the feminine).
Time and again we shall see that Scripture is not primarily concerned with
religion: it deals with spiritual realities. That is to say that religion, as



82 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
a masculine expression of something it doesn't understand, becomes redundant. It is
replaced by an intuitive and voluntary desire to express love of God through respect
for His law.
It will be useful, at this point, to restate some basic findings. The cosmic tree was
a time machine, or direct line to God — the Ark of the Covenant. Through it, He
instructed the priest kings as to His will in the government of the earth. This cosmic
telephone was in the hands of every shamanic priest throughout the entire globe.
Approximately six thousand years ago there began a decline in the power of these
people, who, in our age, would ultimately become the persecuted minority we call
Israel. This was all done in accord with, and to aid, the evolution of man toward
spirituality. The temple was ultimately disassembled. The removal of the thirteenth
stone rendered it as a car without an engine or ship without sails. It then survived as
a philosophical/theosophical concept — nothing more than a mnemonic of God's
previous governorship of the earth. The Bible then was created as a source for
reassembly and operation of this device, its surface text being primarily concerned
with allegory that would draw attention to the stone that the builders rejected. Even
the twelve tribes of Israel were mere allegory for the zodiac, as many have
previously suspected, and they have often attempted to arrange them around the
broken temple.
Insofar as they would give authority to the Teacher whose task it is to reveal all
those hidden mysteries in Scripture, the burial and discovery of the Dead Sea
Scrolls was part of this divine plan. He would arrive in the Last Days, some time in
the immediate future. Mythical heroes such as Jesus and Hercules were built upon
the Teacher's character and role. Even the Great Flood, which science tells us is not
far ahead because of global warming, became a part of this prophet's story when he
was given the role of Noah, Deucalion etc. And all this reduces history to nothing
more than a shadow cast by the future.
It will be seen that these mysteries hidden in Scripture serve a dual purpose. They
preserve the science of the tree for the future priests and, because of the
poetic/feminine manner of their codification, they will both stimulate the
feminine/right brain and create a distinction between those with and those without
potential spirituality.
Present-day man's sensory equipment is designed to inform him on a here-and
now basis. Until very recently all danger to humanity was imminent, as it is with our
primate cousins. Long-term threats to the species such as the splitting of the atom
and subsequent nuclear war were not taken into account by our survival
mechanisms. Threats that may occur in the future cannot be sensed and registered
by our existing instincts.
Thus a forest is cleared to meet our immediate needs for land without



MYTHS, MIRACLES AND MISCONCEPTIONS 83
our being able to perceive the ensuing ecological degradation and its consequent
threat to our survival. Present-day man is neurologically and sensorially an
existentialist. The left brain, like a computer, deals with the 'real world' on the
principle of default. It is both highly selective and primitive in its grasp of actual
reality.
Our newly-evolved humanity will have a sixth sense — an intuitive
understanding derived from the right brain feminine — which will provide the
essential long-term perception survival ingredient necessary in a creature with our
creative and destructive potential. With this sixth sense it will avoid the traps that
were inevitable for us. The required elements already exist within us. It is now a
matter of their integration to establish an eventual perfect whole. This process is
much more adequately described in I Corinthians 13:10-12.
A further confirmation of this concept is found in the story of Ehud (I Chronicles
7: 10; 8: 6). Not only has he a name similar to Jesus, he has a two-edged dagger,
whereas Jesus has a tongue like a two-edged sword. Israel being oppressed by the
Moabites, Ehud slew their king and rallied Benjamin and Ephraim (Gemini and
Coma, or the Messiah and the Goddess) to fight their taskmaster and win peace for
eighty years. Ehud's distinction was that he was left-handed. Furthermore Ehud
means 'union', obviously the uniting of the left and the right, the feminine and
masculine. One must thus wonder if the name Judah (the Jews) was originally in
tended to convey this same meaning, confirming the idea that they are not a race but
a more highly evolved — spiritualized — species.
In this section I have both mentioned the fact that the planets also sit in the tree
and — seemingly without any connection — referred to dragon paths (ley lines). In
Australia these are called songlines, and this is significant. The entire globe was
once criss-crossed by these lines, which were regularly punctuated by standing
stones. The stones were, precisely, acupuncture needles, which balanced what has
been known by some as the orgone force. The stones maintained the health of the
planet and therefore all life upon it. These dragon paths and their megalithic needles
were orientated to tap the energies of the sun (the dragon), the moon and the
planets, which, if properly balanced and paired, have a positive impact. The planets
are related thus:
Venus with Saturn
Saturn with Mars
Mars with Jupiter
Jupiter with Mercury
Mercury with Venus This is the clavis ad thesaurum of Alchemy.

The Stone
Let me stress that this book is not at all concerned with astrology in the
modern sense; our interest is with astronomy. Astrology, like Christianity
and Judaism, is founded upon sufficient truths whereby it has preserved yet
another aspect of the ancient sacred sciences.
If we speak of a thirteenth sign, we should — in astronomical terms
expect to find it upon or near the ecliptic (path of the sun). Coma is not on
this path, but then neither are Aries, Gemini and Scorpio. Banal as it may
seem, it must be said that the pictures of the zodiac serve an entirely
different purpose to the stars themselves, or, more correctly, we may say
that even these are only markers which allow us to anticipate and consider
the position and disposition of the universe at any given time. When we
look into the heavens, we are looking into the mind of God.
Over the years there has been considerable speculation over the possible
existence of a lunar thirteenth sign. I must stress that, while there is an
almost complete dovetailing between the zodiac and the cosmic tree, there
are differences which I shall be pointing out. These exist primarily in
application. Further, our brief look at the strictly astronomical zodiac will
allow us to source more information relevant to the overall thesis. To put
the matter simply, the lunar sign could very likely have only been removed
to avoid the realization that there should also be thirteen of them on the
tree.
Coma is the thirteenth, and that is itself immutable. But astronomically
speaking it is not a part of the area of heaven occupied by the lunar sign.
The area with which we are concerned is between Taurus and Gemini, as
coincidentally is the case upon the tree. This actual location is that of
Auriga the Charioteer, which represents another aspect of this greatest
secret of all time. This is the Throne Chariot — Merkabah — of Hebrew
mysticism. As we progress we shall see that nothing is in fact lost. In what
follows I have used the book Arachne Rising13 by James Vogh as a general
guide. He has, to my satisfaction, determined the location of the lunar sign,
which he calls Arachne.
The clues asserting the astronomical location of the thirteenth sign are
too many to mention. The oft-repeated theme which has been borrowed for
the New Testament story is that of Phaedra



THE STONE 85
making sexual advances to her son Hippolytus while her husband Theseus
was hunting the Minotaur (sometimes a Quinotaur) in Crete. Hippolytus
refused her and she hanged herself, but Theseus banished their son, who
tangled the reins of his chariot in a tree as he made his escape. This is yet
another obvious Star and Sceptre story. The important element is the
hanging of the spider from a thread. This theme of the hanged female
spider/Christ spirit is a very common one representing death and
resurrection.
Vogh comes close to making a connection with Coma on pages 90-91,
where he points out that the gnostic synagogue at Beth Alpha in Palestine,
built in 520 CE, contains a mosaic zodiac in the floor which is out of
proportion, as though there had been a change of mind half-way through
completion. The spacing of the signs allows them an average of less than
30°, whereas Virgo has been allotted 38°. She is with child, and the child
— as has been said repeatedly — is Coma/Christ. The insert at the centre of
the zodiac is a spider. Coma and Auriga are the two wheels — luna and
solar — that drive the zodiac of the mind. That is to say, the astronomical
area to which I refer is that which, astrologically speaking, is responsible
for psychic abilities.
On page 111 there is a graph taken from the birth dates of 127 psychics. I
would far prefer to think of these as fully conscious or single-minded
individuals: 'psychic' is a word that has been overdone, tending to evoke
thoughts of ouija boards and spirits with their heads tucked neatly under
their arms. The graph shows that these births all occur within the area of
Pisces to Cancer, with Arachne providing 18.7 per cent. In a division of
thirteen signs, the average expectation would be 7.7 per cent. The odds
against the actual figure are, Vogh says, 200,000 to 1.1 shall, in due course,
raise the matter of the Teacher being a Taurean, this being evidenced by the
Scrolls. The bull is neighbour to Arachne and, while in a twelve-sign zodiac
the Teacher may be so designated, in a thirteen-sign zodiac he may well
come under the spell of Arachne. This would give him the intuitive ability
to uncover the mysteries in Scripture.
Central to this entire matter is the star Capella in Auriga (in Latin 'capelli'
means 'hair'). Vogh points out that, with ancient observations of the stars,
Capella seems to have attracted the most interest by far. On page 43 he uses
the observations of Professor Alexander Thorn, who found that, aside from
the sun and moon, Celtic/Druid observatories were predominantly focused
upon Capella. This star is Arianrhod of the silver wheel, which is the



86 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
psychic driving force of the zodiac. It is the star that seems to be
responsible for our psychic abilities or lack of them.
As is the case with the Bible, countless volumes of the ancient sciences
have been codified within apparently innocuous material. Robert Graves is
one who discovered this, and he demonstrated it in The White Goddess.
The ancient priests claimed that, by putting together a specific combination
of sounds (calling upon the name of God), they could pass through time to
the future.
With the aid of Robert Graves's deciphering of the tree alphabet, each
tree symbolizing a letter or sound, Vogh has arranged the thirteen-sign
zodiac with the consonants of the Beth Luis Neon, the ancient alphabet of
the Druids (page 56):
Sign Sign Date Tree Alphabet
number begins reference letter
11 Capricorn Dec 24 birch, wild olive B
12 Aquarius Jan 21 rowan L
13 Pisces Feb 18 ash N
1 Aries Mar 18 alder F
2 Taurus April 15 willow S
3 Arachne May 13 hawthorn H
4 Gemini June 10 oak D
5 Cancer July 9 holly T
6 Leo August 5 nut, apple C
7 Virgo Sept 2 vine M
8 Libra Sept 30 ivy G
9 Scorpio Oct 28 reed Ng
10 Sagittarius Nov 25 elder, myrtle R
On page 61 we have the arrangement of the five vowels with the planets
and their trees:
A Venus palm or silver fir
O Jupiter furze
U Saturn heather
E Mars aspen
I Mercury yew
On pages 58-59 Vogh points out that, though accredited to Pythagoras,
the right-angled triangle of proportions 5 : 12 : 13 was used by the Druids
long before him.



THE STONE 87
The arrangement of the 5:12:13 triangle is now as in Diagram 5. This
can be used to predict the exact number of lunations per year
12.36935... — for a period of up to about a thousand years. Such points
make nonsense of the idea that ancient man was primitive.
Diagram 5. A solar-lunar computer based on the
Pythagorean triangle 5:12:13. the length of AX gives
the number of lunar periods in a solar year.
Vogh does not make a direct connection with the sign Coma Berenice,
but curiously he gives the thirteenth sign the symbol . This glyph is
obviously a feminine — closed — version of the swastika, which
symbolizes the masculine sun.
Diagram 6. The solar and lunar zodiacs complete with the five
sacred planets and the alphabet.
It seems to me incomprehensible that Scripture can be so overt in its
astronomical allusions, such as with the twelve tribes and twelve apostles,
and still be thought historical. How is it that academia has



88 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
never publicly raised the matter of the Scrolls' concept of hidden mysteries
in Scripture when the Bible itself tells us it contains these profound
secrets? To precisely what degree are we all idiots led by fools? And to
precisely what degree is there an occult element to life — the hand of God
— which allows us to see at any given time precisely what it pleases?
The book of Daniel concludes (12: 9-10) with the words:
Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the
time of the end.
Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked
shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the
wise shall understand.
In chapter 2 Daniel interprets the king's dream in which he saw a great
image whose countenance was terrible. Its head was of gold and its breast
and arms were of silver. It had a belly and thighs of brass with its legs of
iron and its feet part iron and part clay.
The image signifies the idol Jesus, starting with its Roman foundations
in the head of gold and going on to the present time with its feet of iron and
clay, the age of iron.
In the vision of the king (2: 34), Daniel tells him:
Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which
smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake
them to pieces.
We may note here that the stone smote the image upon its feet, the
present; not upon its head, the past.
Later Daniel tells the king (2: 35) that the stone that smote the image
became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
In chapter 3 the king builds a similar image of fine gold which by its
measure, 60 x 6 cubits, gives this idol the mark of the beast, which in
Revelation 13: 18 has its final form as 666.
This number is one of those elements in Scripture cunningly designed to
fire the imagination. It economically describes an important and essential
element in nature, the solar/masculine principle of external drive, the male
life force. There can be little question that the concept in Revelation finds
its origin in the Hebrew 'sorath', which has a value of 666 and refers to solar
drive. Unless this number is balanced by a feminine/lunar energy, which



THE STONE 89
has not been so in the Piscean Age, 666 becomes negative. Thus, instead of
applying to an inspired leader, it applies to a brutal dictator, a destructive
power. The number 666 stands as a great example of cabalistic economy.
Enshrined in these three digits is an entire complex series of philosophies.
For our purposes, we need only know that 666 is the fire that does not care
if it warms your house or burns it down. It is given to the corresponding
feminine number, 1080, to nurture and control it for the benefit of the
human family. Failure to balance these forces can, in scriptural terms, be
said to bring about the 'wrath of God'. This phrase in the Greek has a value
of 666, as opposed to 1080, the lunar/feminine.
As John Michell points out on page 170 of City of Revelation,14 John
specifically applied this number to a man. In accordance with cabalistic
practice, we take the phrase 'and his number is Six hundred threescore and
six' and find its value. The numerical composition of these words in the
original Greek is:
which is the same as the number of the name 'Jesus Christ'. This is the
thrice-repeated 'image of the beast' in verse 15.
In Revelation 18: 21 the stone appears again and is here likened to a
millstone. The idea of this stone being a millstone grinding corn-creating
wisdom is the foundation of Shakespeare's Hamlet, which is a latter-day
version of the Bible epic we are discussing. The passage in Revelation
reads thus:
And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it
into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon
be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
In Revelation 2: 17 the stone appears again; here it is associated with the
receiving of hidden wisdom:
To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and
will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written,
which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.



90 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
This stone is given along with its twelve companions to the people of
Israel that the Teacher raises up. It has upon it the Teacher's name, as
opposed to that of Jesus.
Scripture says that Israel comprises the spiritual and blood descendants
of Abraham, whom God called out of the city of Ur. The blood element
applies specifically to the Sceptre. In Matthew 3: 9 Jesus says:
And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our
father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up
children unto Abraham.
In the garden of Eden the Serpent of wisdom tempted Eve with the fruit
of the tree, which was knowledge. His role was positive; it was the
Beast/Jesus/Jehovah who feared the increase of knowledge and set the
serpent in a negative role. He makes another appearance in Matthew 4: 3
when he effectively does exactly the same thing: as earlier mentioned, he
says to Jesus:
If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made
bread.
Seek your wisdom in the stars. But this knowledge of the stars is
anathema to the traditionalist, so accordingly in Matthew 5: 17 Jesus says:
Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am
not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
This latter-day Jesus the Teacher appears to traditional believers as a
destroyer, but, as is evident, he fulfils Scripture by revealing mysteries and
altering its meaning. The Law is given by God to Israel, whom the Teacher
in the guise of Moses leads spiritually out of allegorical Egypt, which, like
Sodom and Babylon, is a spiritual pit, not an actual place. Israel is not a
country, nor is it yet a national or ethnic group. It is gathered from all the
peoples of the world, the seekers of righteousness from all nations and all
tribes.
The physical place they eventually occupy permanently is the land we
know now as Israel and which will eventually be much larger than the
present state.
In 70 CE the Hebrews were dispersed. They emerge later as the



THE STONE 91
Ladino-speaking Sephardi of north Africa and southern Europe. 'Sepher' in
Hebrew means 'book'; hence the Sephardi were the people of the book.
They are now a mixed blood minority in modern Israel. The Ashkenazi are
Jews of east European origin; they drifted into Europe from Russia. In
Genesis 10: 3 they appear as the generations of the sons of Noah.
The story of the Great Flood is universal, but there is no evidence of its
occurrence. We shall in due course see that Noah is yet another version of
the Righteousness Teacher who builds a boat (the tree) from which to
escape the Aquarian flood, the result of present ecological degradation.
But where does that leave the present-day state of Israel? The answer
seems to be that it is precisely in the same situation as the Christian
Church.
In The Thirteenth Tribe15 Arthur Koestler says that the Ashkenazi were
originally Russian Khazars who at one time had a very substantial trading
empire. It seems that they converted en masse to Judaism before they
dispersed through Russia and eventually to Europe. Taking the title of the
sub-tribe of Ashkenaz, they have unwittingly given themselves not an
historical but a mythological name. These modern Jews are what the Bible
repeatedly terms 'false Israel'. In these initial sections I can do little more
than introduce threads which will, I trust, be seen later to form parts of a
tapestry.
We have for the past two thousand years been living a myth, the power
of which is absolutely incomprehensible. If my interpretation is correct,
there are no Jews in the world as such. If we follow events in the Scrolls we
learn that the latter-day community has been in existence some twenty
years and is groping for 'The Way'. God then raises up for them the
Righteousness Teacher to lead them in the way of his heart.
The word 'Jews' is in Hebrew 'Jehudim'. Jesus is in Hebrew 'Jeshua'. Jehu
and Jeshu are interchangeable; hence the Jehudim or Jeshudim are the
followers of Jesus the Righteousness Teacher who is the first of the New
Covenanters. The Jews are then a mixture of peoples who are zealots for
the law: a nation within nations of people who have evolved to a higher
level of consciousness, people who are able, phoenix-like, to rise from the
ashes of a world destroyed in order to be born again.
Much has been written about the possibility of a process of evolution of
consciousness that is currently taking place among humankind: we may
have among us a generation that sees the world through



THE THIRTEENTH STONE
totally different eyes, whose values are completely new and whose power
of mind is far greater than has been known before. It would thus seem that
the Teacher's revelations are designed as 'a stone of stumbling and rock of
offence' (I Peter 2: 8). We are asked to believe the unbelievable, to be
shocked into higher consciousness.
In Revelation this stone is set in its proper place in time. In chapter 5: 1
3 we are told:
And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book
written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals.
And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is
worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth, was
able to open the book, neither to look thereon.
Later, in verse 6:
...and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain,
having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God
sent forth into all the earth.
In chapter 6 the lamb proceeds to open the book. It is the revealing of the
mysteries that signals the end of the beginning. In Hebrew 'imera' means
'lamb' and 'imerah' means 'word'. Thus the lamb is the Teacher who
proclaims the new word which was in the beginning (John 1:1).
The thirteenth stone makes its appearance in the story of David and
Goliath in I Samuel 17. 'Goliath' is in Hebrew 'soothsayer'. Verse 49 reads:
And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and
slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead...
In this, yet another 'stone' story, Goliath must be compared with Daniel's
great image. If this giant is the soothsayer idol Jesus, it then follows that the
Philistines are the idol-worshipping Christians of our age. David, the
Star/Teacher, then goes on to be the shepherd king of Israel (specifically,
king of the shepherds/magi) and is followed by Solomon, who builds the
actual temple/tree. Prophetically speaking this temple is both false and
defiled; it is the one that is mythically brought down by Samson.



THE STONE 93
The story of Samson is, historically speaking, one of the most ludicrous
in Scripture, though all these tales invite us to question their reality. He
makes his appearance in Judges 13: 24. As some have remarked, this man
was a berserker — killer of a lion, slayer of a thousand men who with his
bare hands brought down the temple of the Philistines.
Before we look at the obvious Samson connections I would like to draw
attention to Matthew 2: 23:
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a
Nazarene.
Others have commented that Nazareth is never mentioned in the Old
Testament and it was never spoken by the prophets that he should be a
Nazarene. Neither is it possible that Matthew made a mistake, for, as many
have pointed out, if only from the evidence in the negative from Josephus,
the city of Nazareth most likely did not exist in New Testament times. It
has been suggested that there was some confusion over the term 'Nazarite'.
'Nazoreans' is one name that scholars have considered as a possible
designation for the Qumran community. The Qu'ran calls Christians
'Nasara' and 'Nazara', the modern derivation being 'Nasrani'. The Hebrew is
'Nozrim', a derivative of Nazrie ha-Brit', keepers of the Covenant. This is
precisely how the Essenes term themselves in the Scrolls. Nazareth the city
is in the territory of Zebulon, which is Virgo, and from this virgin sea arises
the Sceptre and the wise nazri (fishes). A Nazarite was one who was
separated and called out to refrain from certain human indulgences for
longer or shorter periods of time, such as the cutting of hair (Numbers 6). If
both Jesus and Samson were Nazarites they would let their hair grow, as
must be the case with the tree. It is only when we set this story in future
tense that the claim to prophetic fulfilment makes any sense. But let us
return to Samson, who wants to marry one of the daughters of the
Philistines.
At his pre-wedding feast he sets a riddle for his friends which proves to
be yet another version of the Star-in-Jacob and Sceptre-out-of-Israel
prophecy. It appears at Judges 14:14:
Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth
sweetness.



94 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
'The eater' is the lion/devourer in Leo, the sun, from which arises the
Teacher and the flesh of the law. 'The strong' is the phallus of Israel, from
which there arises the sweetness of the new kingdom.
Samson's next adventure was to tie firebrands to the tails of foxes,
animals known for their cunning, and burn down the corn (wisdom) of the
Philistines. But the deed he is famed for is the bringing down of the temple.
It transpires that his strength is in the hair of his head, and we shall have
to keep this in mind when we examine the albino aspect of our story, which
is a theme found globally in these legends.
The hair of his head is the rising sun, which gives life to Coma in the
genital hair of the tree and with which he brings down the temple with his
subsequent revelation of occult mysteries. In like manner it is given to
Jesus to prophesy in Matthew 24: 2:
...verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon
another, that shall not be thrown down.
He is, in theory, speaking here of the Temple in Jerusalem, of which one
entire wall is still standing. Therefore we may say the prophecy failed. In
reality he is speaking of the Church of Jesus worship which, in the role of
Samson, the Teacher destroys.
Similarly, both Jesus and John the Baptist enter upon the stage with the
cry 'Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens is at hand', which means 'very
soon'. The whole tenor of the preaching of Jesus and John was that there
would be one more generation, forty years, by which time man would feel
the wrath of God. It never happened.
Nineteen hundred years later we are still building churches, Christianity
is still a powerful worldwide religion, and millions of people each year give
themselves to Jesus. No doubt this is one of those profound mysteries
which the Teacher will one day reveal.
There is a story about a king and his magic suit of clothes which makes a
good analogy. It seems some disreputable tailors sold the king a suit which
they said looked exquisite, though he himself could not see it. These magic
clothes, invisible to the wearer, were in fact no clothing at all. Everyone in
the court and throughout the land was told about the regal raiment. On the
day that he paraded through the land, all expressed their amazement at how
handsome the king appeared. Everyone, that is, except a young boy who
had heard nothing about the monarch's magic suit, and who exclaimed that
he saw the king naked.



THE STONE 95
The Bible is, after all, the most studied and analyzed book in history, and
yet it seems there is much that should have been seen a long time ago. Can
it be that some external force has clouded our eyes until the prescribed
time? It seems more than coincidence that the Qumran Scrolls were found
when they were. Also the forces that endeavoured to silence them seem
now like those of an old order resisting a new.
It is only in recent years that any serious and objective Scripture analysis
has begun to take place. Each piece of work makes an opening for the next.
And what of the emergence of the so-called New Age philosophies? Even
politicians now speak of a new era. Where does the idea of Aquarius being
the age of harmony and trust, peace and understanding spring from? Is it
that Daniel's prophecy is now being fulfilled? Is the old understanding
being swept aside to make room for the new? I wonder how many of us
have considered how little we know of reality and how utterly unaware we
are. These things have only gone unseen because our eyes were closed. But
what closed them?
Conclusion
We have seen more evidence of stone/star stories in Scripture. I have again argued
that the Bible as history is nonsense but much more comprehensible if seen in the
future tense.
I have introduced the idea that Israel as a modern state has no direct relationship
with Scripture. Its present inhabitants are Russian Khazars who took Judaism as a
religion prior to their dispersal as a national group. I have, in fact, suggested that as
of now there are no Jews. I am proposing that the idea that Israel is an ethnic group
is wrong: rather it is a spiritually ripe humanity that will become the priests and
shepherds of the future.
Other points stated or implied in this section are:
1. The Bible is such an overtly pagan document that, once one has seen it as such,
one is bound to conclude that the proposition is obvious.
2. Astrology should not be confused with astronomy. The former, which might be
said to fall into the psychological category of religion, is yet another vehicle that
has kept the ancient wisdom alive. But it, too, is a manifestation of the Piscean
Age and as such is, I suggest, nothing more than a soppy and diversionary
delusion.
3. Most importantly, there are subtle differences between the zodiac and the tree.

The Fisher King
The term 'synoptic' is applied to the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke.
The reason for this is that from these we may derive a synopsis of the life
of Jesus. According to scholarship they are so designated because they
agree with each other. To describe Matthew, Mark and Luke in this manner
would indicate a complete lack of scholarship. According to the same
scholarship, that they are not synoptic is well known. Nevertheless,
academia continues to use the term to cover a gaping hole in the New
Testament.
Whatever one's opinion may be in this matter, the term should never
have been applied in the first place. Its corollary may be found in the
sacking and public humiliation of any academic in a Catholic university
who openly questions the Scriptures. Just as the medical fraternity have an
investment in our physical sickness, these scholars have an investment in
our spiritual ignorance. T do not know' or T do not understand' does not
seem to be part of their learned vocabulary. It is difficult to accept the
duplicity of people who claim to know better, particularly when it is
coupled with scholarly arrogance.
Without taking into account the minute detail, the following
inconsistencies become apparent when one compares the 'synoptic' stories.
Of the four gospels, only Matthew and Luke are concerned with the birth
of Jesus. In the early chapters of Matthew, this character is a king, born of
the house of David, visited by priest kings who bring very expensive gifts.
In Matthew 2:11, the Nazarene is born in a house, or is in one when the
magi come to call. There is no mention of a manger. Joseph then takes the
child born to be king into Egypt, along with his mother, because it is
prophesied that God is to call His son out of (allegorical) Egypt. I shall
show later that this 'calling out' represents the spiritual birth of Jesus and
Israel. Egypt and Babylon — the modern world — are mother to this new
child. Biblically, this Egypt is the mother of Israel.
The holy family leaves to escape King Herod, who fears that the child is
a threat to his throne. As the story is told in Matthew, Joseph and Mary are
originally resident in Bethlehem. Upon their return from Egypt they settle
in Nazareth.



THE FISHER KING 97
The character we see in Matthew is a kingly and aristocratic Jesus, who,
in his last words, makes the statement 'My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me'.
Luke is absolutely at odds with this story. But for the fact that this man
has the same name, he describes an entirely different person.
While Matthew speaks of the birth of a king, Luke begins with the birth
of John the Baptist. In the Scrolls, the Last Days Community is in existence
for twenty years (led by John) before the Teacher comes, hence John is
spiritually born before him. In Luke, the virgin is resident in Nazareth when
she conceives of the Holy Ghost. In Luke 1: 48 Mary is of 'low estate'. In
verse 56 she spends three months living with Elizabeth, the mother of John.
While Matthew states that the events occurred when Herod was King, Luke
says Cyrenius was Governor, and thus Joseph and Mary must go to
Bethlehem because of a census. According to Josephus (Antiquities 17,13,5
and 18,1,1ff.), this Cyrenius did not become Governor until 8 CE, at least
ten years too late for Jesus' birth. Another Cyrenius was Governor from 10
to 7 BCE, and he is too early.
In Luke 2: 7, Jesus is born in a manger where he appears to stay until the
family departs. In this instance, there is no star to guide the magi, nor are
there any magi as such. Here they are called shepherds, which is the same
thing. The angel of the Lord appears to them and announces the birth of a
saviour, rather than a king.
Whereas in Matthew, Mary and Joseph depart immediately for Egypt, in
Luke they tarry without fear and eventually depart 'to their own city,
Nazareth'. In Luke, Jesus is no king; he is the son of a poor carpenter and is
later portrayed as a meek, mild-mannered man, not the aristocrat depicted
in Matthew. In Luke, even his dying words differ from those spoken in
Matthew. Here he is the priest who says 'Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do'.
These stories do, of course, have similarities, without which they would
not have a relationship. The differences are part of the mythmaker's art,
drawing our attention to deeper meaning. On the basis of these two very
different characters, the Church has created an idol composed of the
mythical belief that a peasant could one day become king of the world. It is
this very principle which was so typical of the revolution that was to take
place in the Piscean Age. In reality, Matthew and Luke describe the
spiritual birth of the Sceptre, Star and John in the 'Last Days'. These three
heroes are spiritual brothers.



98 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
The book of Matthew begins with a genealogy of Jesus; so too does the
book of Luke. Matthew begins at the beginning of the bloodline and Luke
begins at its end, which makes them difficult to compare. Both trace the
bloodline through Joseph, who specifically is not the father of Jesus; hence
both genealogies are pointless unless we see Joseph as the sun on the tree
and father in both cases. I have set them down here so that they appear in
the same order.
Genealogy in Matthew (chapter 1) Genealogy in Luke (chapter 3)
Joseph husband of Mary Joseph husband of Mary
Jacob Heli
Matthew Matthew
Eleazar Levi
Eliud Melchi
Achim Janna
Sadoc Joseph
These two lineages, of which I have given only the first seven
generations, are clearly of two completely different individuals. They are,
throughout, vastly at odds. Both are patently mythological; nevertheless I
take them to indicate the Star and Sceptre of the Scrolls. That in Matthew is
the bloodline of the Sceptre, the king of the line of David. That in Luke is
of the Star/Teacher, for it goes through Levi, the priests. It is the mythical
line of the Righteousness Teacher who we find as the star of Bethlehem
leading the magi to the birth of the Sceptre King, the object of his
revelation.
Equal significance is given in the New Testament to the genealogy of
John the Baptist. In Mark 1: 9-13 Jesus goes immediately into the
wilderness for forty days after his baptism by John. In John 2: 1-2, three
days after the same baptism, he goes to the wedding at Cana. Other texts at
odds with each other are: Matthew 10: 34 and Acts 10: 36; Luke 2: 14;
Luke 14: 26 and I John 3: 15; Matthew 7: 7-8 and Luke 13: 24; Luke 1: 32
33 and John 18: 36 and 1: 11; Mark 6: 8 and Matthew 10: 9-10. The
contradictions are numerous; they include many from the writings
accredited to Paul, but that is a totally different matter.
We now, in theory, have enough information to put together a general
picture of the major characters. John, a rustic and a simple man, appears
everywhere in tandem with Jesus. In the Old Testament the Baptist appears
as Jonathan, the much beloved



THE FISHER KING 99
friend of David. Their story is far-flung, occurring in many cultures. They
even appear as two brothers who are the sons of Grandmother Spider in
North American Indian mythology. Each day Grandmother Spider's sons
went out hunting and always came back with a kill. One day they
complained to her about their diet. The next day, when they came home,
she had prepared a food they had never tasted before. She told them it was
called 'corn'. When they asked where it came from, she would not tell
them. She only said that the day they learned how it was made she would
have to leave them, and there would come trouble in their land such as had
never been known.
They ate this new food for some days and enjoyed it so much that they
became more and more curious about its origin. So one day they pretended
to go off hunting but hid themselves to spy on their Grandmother.
They waited, and soon they saw her rubbing her hind legs together and
producing the cobs. When they came home at the usual time, she told them,
'By your eagerness to know the origins of corn, you two boys were destined
to bring trouble into the world. And now you must care for yourselves.'
And she left them with their corn (wisdom) which she (Coma) had given
them.
The New Testament is tantalizing in that it begins with the implication
that John is at least as important as Jesus, but he very quickly fades into the
background.
I must admit that John was a very knotty problem in the interpretation of
the gospels, until I saw the obvious.
An Essene document, the Damascus Rule, reads (column I):
And they perceived their iniquity and recognized that they were guilty
men, yet for twenty years they were like blind men groping for the
way.
And God observed their deeds, that they sought Him with a whole
heart, and He raised for them a Teacher of Righteousness to guide
them in the way of His heart.
Let us, then, set the matter in present or future tense where it belongs. A
small community of ascetics is living somewhere in the modern world.
They have a leader, a simple man who loves God, namely John the Baptist.
They have for twenty years been following him. Then the scholar, Jesus the
Teacher, appears to show them the real Law, as opposed to the traditional
interpretation.



100 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
In the New Testament, John appears first, a voice crying in the
wilderness, 'Repent for the kingdom of the heavens is at hand'. Jesus the
Teacher arrives and John the Baptist initiates him into the community of
The Way, the baptism in water, the word of God. As mentioned earlier,
water is a common symbol for the wisdom that flows from His mouth. In
Luke 3: 16 Jesus is to baptize in the Holy Ghost (the spirit of the Spider)
and fire, the sun he raises on the tree. In the following verse he is to gather
the wheat (wisdom) and burn the chaff with the same unquenchable fire of
the sun.
The community grows for forty years and overcomes many problems,
not least of all the persecution of the Teacher, who has now taken over as
the leader. This is the forty years in the wilderness under Moses. But
ultimately they find a leader in the form of the Sceptre/Branch/King, with
whom they fight the great battle of the Last Days. This is Joshua, who leads
the people into the promised land. Jesus and John are the two witnesses
whose bodies lie dead on the street and are called up in Revelation 11.
In Matthew, the genealogy of Jesus is divided into three groups of
specifically fourteen generations. The third in fact contains only thirteen,
unless one separates 'Jesus called Christ' into Jesus = 13 and Christ = 14.
Matthew 1: 17 reads:
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and
from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and
from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.
This genealogy, as I have said, is deficient by one generation in the third
group, a fact of which scholars never speak.
Babylon is just as Sodom and Egypt: a place or world of sin and iniquity.
Chronologically speaking, the three divisions in Matthew cover the
following periods:
1. Before the monarchy 750 years
2. Monarchy 400 years
3. Post-monarchy 575 years
Where Matthew lists forty-one names, Luke's genealogy has seventy
seven. These are divided into eleven sets of seven, which gives the first
indication of an underlying cabalistic scheme. It



THE FISHER KING 101
should not be assumed that these genealogies are haphazard and unrelated,
for they are clearly prepared in reference to each other. The discrepancies
between these two lists are not a recent discovery: as early as c. 220 CE the
Church fathers were trying to find excuses for them and a means of
reconciling them.
The next thing we need to know is that the patriarchs fit on the tree. In
this instance, we have Abraham, who is Taurus, 4000 to 2000 BCE, then
David, who is Aries, 2000 to 0 BCE. The carrying away into Babylon is the
dawn of the Piscean era, in which we have Jesus the fish worshipped and
the tree cut down. The Teacher and the Sceptre come at the end of the
Piscean Age, the entire epic being set forward by two thousand years.
These arrivals are the first and second coming of the Christed man. In
Scripture, the apostles await the imminent return of their saviour and the
establishment of the millennial kingdom; this second Jesus is King Jesus
(the Sceptre), who appears shortly after Jesus the Teacher is killed. These
two Jesuses destroy the Jesus image of a beast and establish the Kingdom
of God. The Teacher brings an end to false religion based on his preceding
image. It is in this role, as an initiator, that he becomes Adam, the first real
man that God created, and is thus found in myth as 'the creator' or the 'self
creating'.
Both the book of Enoch and the book of Jubilees are now accepted as
being of Essene origin; there is also a modicum of acceptance for the book
of Daniel falling into this category.
In Enoch we learn that God, after the creation, set watchers/ angels over
the earth. In a Noah fragment,16 VI, 1-2, we are told that the angels looked
down on earth after mankind had multiplied, and they lusted after the
daughters of men. They decided to take wives from among them and beget
children.
I take this to refer to the iron age of materialism. The name of their
leader is Semjaza, and the result of those unions was that women gave birth
to giants 'who consumed all the acquisitions of men', as might be said to be
the case today. Likewise, on the other side of the world, the Aborigines of
New South Wales called these giant children Bulloo. But most importantly
these angels, who are later called Satans, brought mankind knowledge of
hidden things, which may also be given a modern context.
In Sumerian and Babylonian traditions these creatures are part man and
part fish: the people of Pisces. Their leader is Oannes, leader of fifty
Anunnaki, who later, in the Jason epic, become the fifty Argonauts. This
story will involve us in a brief detour.



102 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
The death of Jesus was upon a tree (Acts 5: 30 and 10: 39) and in
Deuteronomy 21: 23 we see that he who is hung in this manner is accursed
before God. This tree upon which he is crucified is of the cosmic variety;
he dies for it, or because of it.
In Britain, centuries before the advent of the New Testament story, the
god Hu or Hesus was each year hung upon a tree. He shared more than just
his name with Jesus: he was a very early British version of Merlin, who
established the kingdom of the once and future king. He was the bringer of
the knowledge of letters and was a British form of the Teacher.
It seems that, when he first came down to teach men the arts and
sciences, they were so amazed that they fell down and worshipped him.
This made him angry, for he insisted there was only one God and only He
should be worshipped. But they continued, and in his anger he exploded.
Where he was buried there grew a tree which among other things had
hanging from it the Beth Luis Neon — the ancient alphabet of the British.
The cross of the crucifixion is another version of the temple, as I have
said, and tells a very interesting story. With the earth's movement into
Pisces, the spirit essence that the Hebrews called the Messiah (Christ) was
said to have died. To the Greeks it was Pan, the 'All' spirit, that passed
away.
The sign Crux Australis, the Southern Cross, was depicted in the Persian
zodiacs as a dolphin. It was known as Delphinus, which is a wisdom fish
and symbolizes the earlier mentioned Oannes, the fish-man creator of
Babylonian tradition.
Because of precession, the stars do not appear always in the same place;
at the time of the earth's entering Pisces, the Southern Cross was about to
disappear from the northern hemisphere. Thus, the mythmakers punned and
said Christ the Spirit of wisdom had died upon the cross/tree, and the tree
had been hewn down. Christ was then superseded by Jesus, the fish deity of
the Piscean Age, upon that same cross in the night sky.
In the Bethlehem story we have the following elements. (As I have said,
Bethlehem is the house of bread, which is the zodiac.)
Mary is Mariam = Mar = the sea from which the Piscean fish is born.
This sea is a new age and hence virgin. Joseph is from the root SIPA, the
sun in the tree, the fertilizing spirit beaming down upon the womb of life,
Mary the watery (Hebrew: bitter) word of God.
It is said that when the Holy Family escaped into Egypt they stayed at
Heliopolis. Much earlier, this city was known as 'On',



THE FISHER KING 103
meaning 'sun', and thus Heliopolis was the city of the sun. By sheer
coincidence, Joseph the offspring of Jacob married Asenath the daughter of
the high priest of On. The name of this man was Potiphar; he had
purchased Joseph (the sun) and made him 'head over his house'. After a
false accusation by Potiphar's wife (the goddess of the ten-sephiroth tree),
he threw Joseph into prison. His daughter Asenath (goddess of the eleven
sephiroth temple) bore Joseph his two boys, Ephraim and Manasseh.
Ephraim, we have seen, is Coma. Thus the Bible establishes that the chosen
people are descended from priests of the temple of the sun and are born of
allegorical Egypt. We shall return to this point.
Joseph and Jesus have the trade of carpenter; mythically speaking this
refers to a mage who, like a carpenter, creates things from trees. The
Hebrew for carpenter is 'naggar'; it means both 'carpenter' and 'teacher'. The
stable is a home for animals and so too is the zodiac, and in that zodiac we
have Pisces, the two fishes, who are the Star and the Sceptre: the wisdom
fishes.
'Shepherds' is another name for magi, and they follow the thirteenth star,
the Teacher, to the royal birth in an ox stall (the ox being a symbol for
Coma: see Ezekiel 1: 10). And each year we light up the Christmas tree
(with the sun) and place gifts at its root (for the Sceptre/King). This festival
originally celebrated the birth of the sun.
The story of Jesus has a direct lineage from the Sumerian Gil-gamesh,
'He who saw everything', through to the Greek Jason (Hellenized Jesus) and
Hercules. This epic is very important to us, but has so many strands it can
become difficult to explain.
Gilgamesh, whose name means 'the tree', must go into the far distant (in
time) land of the living which is also the land of the cut-down cedar. The
access to it is guarded by the monster Huwawa (sometimes Humbaba). In
the north of this country there is a garden of which the fruits are precious
stones. This I take to be the earth in Pisces and Huwawa to be the idol
Jesus.
Gilgamesh is to meet with the wild man Enkidu, of whose coming he is
warned in a dream. Enkidu is obviously yet another John the Baptist.
In the dream he sees a star fall from heaven and he cannot lift it up. Of
this star it is said: 'His fellows kissed its feet'; 'He bent over it as over a
woman'; and his mother 'put it on a par with him'. We need to remember
that his mother is Queen of Heaven, and she is also his wife (sometimes
mistress). This star is also the 'bow star',



104 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
which sits among the 'Fifty Heroes', the Anunnaki. We shall return to them
in a moment.
Where Jason with his fifty Argonauts sows the dragon's/serpent's teeth
(the serpent/dragon sits at the root of the tree), Gilgamesh is this dragon,
who sets his teeth to the ground. This creature is a universal symbol of the
sun, and thus is synonymous with the mythical heroes who are versions of
the Star/Teacher. In Far Eastern traditions this fire-breathing monster is a
solar deity who is a water producer/water diviner, this element being the
word of God. The teeth are stones/stars and the rising of the serpent's teeth
is the rising of the tree, along with Coma and the Serpent/ Jesus/Fish
Man/Creator/Teacher — the wise, the serpentine star. We should not allow
ourselves to be confused between the Fish/ Idol/Creator/Jesus and the
Star/Fish/Teacher/Creator/Jesus. The fifty argonauts are elements of the
thirteenth stone. In Hebrew, 50 is 'nun', which is also the letter 'N'. And nun
in Hebrew means 'fish'. Joshua the Sceptre was, as mentioned earlier, the
son of the high priest 'Nun', who must be yet another version of the
Teacher. We also encounter the concept in the Old Testament and the
Scrolls in the term 'captain over fifty'.
In John 8: 57 Jesus is questioned:
Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou
seen Abraham?
In the Scrolls, a man over fifty is past his best and cannot serve. Oannes,
who was the Lord of the Satans, fish-men who looked down and saw that
the daughters of men were fair, had fifty An-nun-aki. 'An' being heaven and
'ki' being earth, they are the fifty fish-men behind heaven and earth. We
also find them in Polynesia in the shape of Muri Rangawhenua, literally he
who is behind heaven and earth. This Oannes also appears as Nimrod and
Hunrakan the hurricane god. We find him in Homer's Odyssey as Poseidon.
In Shintoism the first child of the Divine Mother and Father is very much
a Hercules or Moses, and these legends clarify the origin of the Oannes
concept. At age three, Hiruko could not walk or even stand properly. Like
Hercules and Moses, his parents abandoned him by casting him adrift in a
reed boat. This is indicative of our First Man, who begins as half human
and half beast. Hiruko, like the Teacher, is also referred to as a star, and in
time was, curiously



THE FISHER KING 105
enough, identified with Yebisu, which name is very similar to Iesu (Jesus).
Like his biblical counterpart, Yebisu was a patron of fishermen. Setting
him adrift upon the waters of the word of God most likely gave rise to the
part-fish part-man concept. Not being able to stand or walk properly may
also imply that he was a merman — a man of mercurial wisdom whose
home is very properly the sea of the Milky Way. Furthermore, it is
common in creation myths — such as is the case with the Egyptian Ra
to find the sun-god (Star) rising from the primordial waters (of the word of
God).
In India Oannes took the form of the elephant-headed makara, and in
China it received the lion-head of the sun. In Polynesia it became the
tanefa, and thus took its place in the evolution of myth as the dragon, and is
now found in cultures as far-flung as Britain, China and Australia.
The clue we need is given in the above quotation from John, for Jesus is
asked has he yet seen Abraham, who is Taurus. This takes us back to
Samson, who has a 'jaw-bone of an ass' which is astronomically the stars on
the face of the bull, Taurus.
Among the Scrolls is a fragment which I take to be an astrological chart
of the Teacher, who is born in this sign. What is thought to be ancient
worship of this beast, such as of the Egyptian (Apis/ April) bull, the
incarnation of Osiris, leads back to this same point.
In Hamlet's Mill" de Santillana and von Deckhend are correct (page 167)
in making the association between Samson, Heracles and Llew Llaw
Giffes, for whom we find almost exact equivalents in the Chinese Fu-hi and
the Sumerian Ea. Our man is he whose soul was placed elsewhere. He lived
two thousand years after himself. In this aspect he comes down from the
face of the bull, and is thus 'Abraham's son'. But the Latin 'apis' means 'bee',
hence apiary.
The case for Gilgamesh, Jason and Noah being one has long since been
proved; as Noah he appears from the Rainy Hyades in Taurus.
Back with Gilgamesh. An uprooted tree is brought into Innana's garden
(Innana is the Goddess). She hopes to make a throne of it for herself.
Unfortunately a dragon has made its lair in the root of the tree, the Zu bird
has made a nest in the crown, and in its centre (the position of the earth) the
Demoness Lilith (a mythical wife of Adam) has built her house. Gilgamesh
comes to the rescue and frees this temple, which later is cut up. The middle
part is for Innana's throne, and from the root and crown he makes for
himself a wand and a drum which is sometimes seen as a timbrel (sistrum).



106 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
In this story Lilith tears down her house and runs away, leaving the earth
once again to the possession of the Queen of Heaven (Christ), who makes it
her throne. It is worth looking at Gilgamesh as Heracles/Hercules and his
mother/lover the Goddess as Freya/ Frega/Frigg, from which we derive
Friggs Day = Friday. The colloquial 'to frig' is to have intercourse. Frigg is
Venus, and she in turn is the ruling planet of Taurus. The Hebrews took
Friday (Taurus = Abraham's day: the Jews were the children of Abraham)
to be the sixth and completing day of creation, the birth day of the Jesus/
Fish/Teacher, and celebrated the sabbath on Saturn's day (Saturday), Saturn
being the ruling planet of Aquarius, the Golden Age.
Meanwhile the Christians inherited the sun's day with precisely the same
meaning, for it was the rising of the sun in the tree that gave birth to the sun
god Jesus the Teacher who, in this instance, is the phallic fertilizing fish
coming out of the womb of his mother, Mary, the virgin sea of Pisces. He
then fertilizes this sea with his spermatozoa, the stars of the Milky Way in
Taurus, the seed of which he is born. As Hercules, he was the lover of the
fifty temple priestesses. This has survived in Christian tradition where nuns
= fifty are the latter-day virgin priestess brides of Jesus and temple
prostitutes, who sacrifice themselves to the fish, the Venus made flesh. This
same Venus was the sea-goddess born on the banks of Triton lake. Triton
was also a fish-god who finds his form in Dagon, whom we shall shortly
visit.
The Queen of Heaven is found in many forms: Ishtar, Astarte,
Persephone, Kore, Helen, Isis and Mary. It is as Sophia that she is best
known as Wisdom. Though she has many names, there are two recurring
themes in her myths. According to one of these she is sent into the
Underworld, sometimes for three days. That is to say she must die for an
age and rise again. Jesus was dead for three days before his resurrection;
thus, this period may be an allegorical age of two thousand years. This
could also indicate Elijah's three years of initiation, after which 'he can
walk properly'.
We also find the Wisdom Queen playing the harlot in the cities of sin. By
this we see that Wisdom sold herself during the time of Pisces. As the
temple prostitute she is Coma, the vagina and womb the shaman must enter.
Venus was also Pallas Athene. Pallas means strength and lust. Pallas was
a sea beast god who later became Apollo (sun), the dolphin god of Delphi
whose Delphic oracle must have been a wise, speaking dolphin. Our word
'phallus' must originate from this



THE FISHER KING 107
Pallas. Apollo the dolphin, one then sees, is the star rising in Jacob and the
phallic Fish/Sceptre coming out of the fertilized sea, Israel.
Bethlehem is not only a city of Judah but also of Zebulon, which is 'by
the sea' and is, on the tree, Virgo. The mythic world was surrounded by
water, and it will be recalled that Crux Australis was a dolphin; in this
sense Jesus the Star/wisdom fish does not die upon the cross but rises from
it out of Virgo, the womb of the sea.
The sign Virgo holds in her hand an ear of wheat; it will be recalled that
bread symbolizes wisdom. As mentioned earlier, this is the 'Branch', and
the Branch is, in Scripture, the Sceptre. In this sense Jesus comes out of his
mother's womb, fertilizes her and becomes the father of the king of the
Golden Age, his seed being wisdom. Thus the Star is father to the Sceptre.
This theme is echoed at the last supper (Matthew 26: 26-28) when Jesus
offers bread (wisdom) to be eaten as his body, and wine (the Christ/Pan
spirit) as his blood of the New Covenant.
The Covenant was stored in a chest which was the Ark of the Covenant;
Noah/Gilgamesh/Jesus built an ark or boat which carried him through the
flood. The tree, as I have mentioned, may be seen as a boat or Ark of the
Covenant which mythically speaking ties up well with fishermen.
The story of Dagon appears in I Samuel 5, in which this god of the
Philistines is described as having the face and hands of a man and the tail of
a fish. His image may be found in the Hebrew letter nun (fifty), the modern
form of which is J. This is derived from which is clearly a fish-tailed
man. In the story, the Philistines have captured the Ark of the Covenant and
have set it in the temple of Dagon/Jesus. When they return the next day
they find this idol fallen on its face and broken before the Ark. They raise
him up once more, but to no avail: he is again found broken before it. The
Lord then visits the Philistines with 'emerods (haemorrhoids) in their secret
parts' and forces the release of the Ark to the children of Israel. Seen in a
modern context this story is not without humour.
Each Friday, by tradition, Catholics eat fish, which may be said to be
both partaking of the bread/wisdom of Jesus and a cannibalistic act of
devouring and becoming the god — consuming the flesh of Dagon the fish.
After all, we speak of fish as brain food. Jesus was also the sacrificial or
pascal lamb. We have retained in English the term 'dag', which refers to the
wool around the sheep's rectum. This is cut and graded separately because it
is fouled with dung. 'Dag' can also refer to a person who is humorous, a
joker or leg-puller.



108 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
The name Jehovah is written in Hebrew (right to left) The
number value of these letters is respectively 10,5,6,5. Man is said to be
made in God's image. If we set the letters vertically we have the
image of God,
But! It is not possible: God has no image. Yod, the head of the image,
means 'hand' and is also a flame which is the sun, and the sun is the hand of
God in the tree. If we restore the tree to what it was in the dark age we
must take away the sun and replace it with
the Jesus/Fish nun = 50. This gives us which has a value of
50,5,6,5 = 66, which is Dagon, or Daniel's (chapter 3) image of a beast
whose measure was 60 x 6. In John's Revelation, this becomes the number
of the beast, 666. This word translates as 'being', happening now.
Furthermore, the Hebrew for 'mark' as in 'mark of the beast' is 'tau'. Tau is
also the last letter of the alphabet and the equivalent of 't'. The original
symbol for this letter was a cross, the cross upon which the symbol of
human beastiality, Jehovah/Jesus, was crucified. The alphabet is said to be
the means of creation; our understanding this last letter indicates creation's
completion.
It is now safe to say that Oannes, the creator Lord of the Satans, is Jesus
and he in turn is Jehovah. Hence when Christians claim Jesus is God they
could not be more right and could not be more wrong. We now have an
explanation for something which has for a long time puzzled Bible
scholars.
Genesis 11: 7 reads:
Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not
understand one another's speech.
This is very typical of this warrior god, who is given to tantrums and mass
destructions on the slightest whim; who is often seen to be plotting against
his people. This same deity told Adam and Eve they should not eat of the
tree of knowledge, which is guarded by a serpent. Why? The God of Israel
is a God of knowledge.
The serpent tempts Eve, the Queen of Heaven, who gives the fruit to her
husband/son Adam, the Teacher, who thus destroys the dominion of
Jehovah/Jesus, for whom the tree is an Achilles heel. In the above quotation
we see him again concerned that mankind may learn too much. In this sense
he is a dictatorial despot who



THE FISHER KING 109
fears the loss of power and as such must be vulnerable. In Exodus 20: 5 we
learn:
.. .for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God...
In the above quotation from Genesis 11: 7 the plural 'let us go down' has
often been questioned, but now we see that this is
Semjaza/Oannes/Jehovah/Jesus the Lord of the fifty Satans speaking with
his fellows.
In Matthew 3: 10 Jesus the Teacher tells us that 'the axe is laid unto the
root of the trees', Coma is removed, the tree is circum-cized. In Mark 8:24
the blind man cured by the Teacher says, when asked what he sees, that he
sees 'men as trees, walking'. In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve learn
they are trees and thus that they have genitalia in the form of Coma, for
which they make aprons to cover and hide from the Lord. If one assumes
that Adam and Eve had long since learned what their genitalia were for
before they ate of the tree, the story does not make sense, but in this wise it
is perfectly logical. The tree of life and tree of knowledge of Genesis 2 are
one and the same: the Piscean with ten sephiroth and the Aquarian with
eleven. Contrariwise, and illogically, in Revelation 22: 2 the tree of life is
given by God to man. There is no mistaking it, for:
In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the
tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every
month:
The twelve fruits are the signs of the zodiac.
In chapter XXXII of the book of Enoch the tree makes another
appearance. Enoch comes into the Garden of Righteousness and is shown
the great tree of wisdom from which Adam and Eve ate. He is told that they
were thrown out of the garden because they knew great wisdom and
became aware of their nakedness.
Seeing that they were naked can only refer to their seeing that they
themselves were trees and that they must hide the steersman, Coma, their
genitalia, from the warrior god Jehovah/Jesus/ Poseidon, the Lord of the
Piscean Age. In his time the eleven-sephiroth tree of knowledge became the
ten-sephiroth tree of life and sorrow. It is the Teacher's task, as Jesus, to
repair the temple by replacing the missing cornerstone.



110 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Proof positive that the biblical Jesus and the Scrolls Teacher are one
does not require a book of this or any size: it might be written on the back
of a postcard.
In Revelation 22: 8 John falls down to worship at the feet of the angel
that shows him the tree. In verse 9 the angel says:
See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren
the prophets...worship God.
In verse 12 the angel says 'Behold I come quickly'. In verse 13 he
describes himself as 'Alpha and Omega'. In verse 16 he says 'I Jesus', and
then calls himself 'the bright and morning star'. The matter could not be
plainer and more incontrovertible for we have the statement that Jesus is
the Prophet/Teacher/Star in Scripture itself, the Star (sun) rising in the tree
'of them which keep the sayings of this book'. The significance of this lies
in the fact that in this instance we have Jesus himself denying his own
divinity in Scripture. This, in the light of the evidence, clearly links him to
the Star Teacher.
Let me now turn again to John the Baptist, whose name is clearly a
derivative of Oannes the fish-man creator. Robert Graves in The White
Goddess (pages 91-92) is debating 'Johannes the Diviner' as referred to by
Mereddin, who himself was an earlier version of Merlin. His name was
changed in the medieval romances, but from the earliest times he was the
Elijah of British folklore and legend. He was also Gwion, who was a
dweller of the sea, a child of mysterious birth who confounded the bards of
Dyganwy.
In the New Testament story of Jesus' youth (Luke, chapter 2), at the age
of twelve (symbolizing understanding the stars), he displays great wisdom
in the Scriptures. Noah and Midas, among others, display a similar talent at
a very early age. In Luke 24: 27 we find:
And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto
them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
This we can take to be the spiritually young Teacher revealing mysteries.
Graves points out that this universal sage was also Taliesin of the radiant
brow; he was chief of the poets, a Celtic Apollo. But Apollo was also a
dweller in the sea, associated with a sacred dolphin (a wisdom fish). Graves
again points out that in Egypt the early



THE FISHER KING 111
gnostic Christians associated John the Baptist with the Chaldean Oannes
who periodically appeared in the Persian Gulf as Odacon the merman, his
object being to bring a new revelation to a new age. In company with these
sages from the sea, we also find the Celtic Llew Llaw Giffes. Graves gets
himself into a bit of a tangle over line 31 of a Mabinogion poem 'I have
suffered hunger for the son of the virgin'. How can Jesus suffer hunger for
himself? The simple fact is that we are dealing with two Jesuses, a Star and
a Sceptre.
In the New Testament these threads are drawn together when there is
debate over the possibility that either Jesus or John might be Elijah, who, as
Graves tells us, was also a legendary figure from the sea.
The male organ is sometimes found colloquially referred to as a fish; this
is certainly the case in Italian. In English we find the use of specific fish
names. In legendary terms the phallus could be said to be a symbol of
maleness, force, power, creativity and thus a symbol of the sun. If the male
seed is associated in its myriads with the stars, it might be spoken of as the
Milky Way. If we add to this the symbolism of water as being life
sustaining, then its association with the words of God is obvious. Add this
together with the concept of water/wisdom of God coming from the
Goddess/Coma, the womb, then the ocean becomes feminine, the watery
womb of life which is seeded by the Teacher's revelation. His words
become his creating seed. The Goddess gives birth to him and takes him as
her consort. Upon her, he fathers the new world race of wise Israel. But
Apollo the sun must also rise up from the sea for he too, as a star, becomes
one with his son. In mythical terms, it is perfectly logical to present Joseph
as the descendant of the house of David, for that's what he is: his son the
Star/Teacher/David is also his father, for he set him on the tree. Thus he can
be father and son to Jesus without being related to him. The wisdom/seed of
the revelation is sprayed by the phallic solar fish; then the earth's waters
break in the great Aquarian flood and the new generation is born. In this
sense, in stanza 10 of Graves's problematical Mabinogion poem T was in
the Ark with Noah and Alpha' is logical, for Jesus is all of them. It all
revolves around a stone/star from which the Goddess arises and through
which she is seeded, it being her vagina.
We shall later look at Elijah more closely, but as Graves confirms on
page 337 of The White Goddess, his name certainly goes back a long way.
The derivation of Elijah can be traced back to Iahu, who was a weeping
cow (moon) goddess, but that's another story.



112 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
What we see is an entire creation epic based on Jesus the god of Pisces,
the wise fishes, which in turn is based on the Teacher as a wise father,
seeder and creator of a new humanity in the Golden Age. The Alpha and
Omega clearly indicate that Jesus is twain, the Star and Sceptre, a central
theme of ancient myth.
The material we are dealing with operates on far more than one level, its
complexity being such as to defy understanding of how it was constructed
in the first place. We have till now examined the most superficial levels.
For example, it is not unusual to find in one story the same character in two
separate guises in conversation with himself. In the Arthurian cycles we
have some of the most complex of this material, and it is at one point
correct to say that Arthur carries aspects of the Teacher. Yet again it is
equally correct overall to say that on another level the real Teacher is
Merlin the mage and Arthur is the Sceptre, who draws his power from a
stone.
In Scripture, Jesus and Jehovah are one and the same, yet convey
different aspects. But to the mystics who created these stories God could
not have images raised to Him. In John 4: 24 Jesus says:
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth.
In the following verse, the woman he speaks to says:
I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is
come, he will tell us all things.
The distinction then is made between a man who is to reveal truth and an
invented god who is shaped and framed upon him. The word-jugglers made
this creator god Jehovah/Jesus into a part-man wisdom fish who would be
worshipped by Philistines. This same story in Homer's Odyssey becomes
that of the Cyclopean giants, the inference being that they are the masters of
the late Piscean Age. And the reference from Graves demonstrates that the
British manufactured exactly the same story.
The beast in Revelation 13 rises up out of the sea as Oannes/
Jesus/Jehovah/Poseidon. His names are names of blasphemy, which is to
say he is called God. His power is given to him by the dragon which is the
Serpent/Devil. The dragon gave power unto the beast. There was none like
the beast and none could make war with him. He was a god. He overcame
the saints and he had power



THE FISHER KING 113
over all kindreds and nations and tongues. All people whose names are not
written in the book of the Lamb/Teacher are to worship him. In verse 11
we see the rising of the Church, which is a beast, causing the worship of
the first beast Jesus. Like the Teacher he makes fire (the sun) to come
down to earth in the sight of men. He deceives by performing miracles. The
Church orders the making of an image of the beast who was pierced like
Jesus and lived. Those who will not worship the image will be killed, as
they have been over the centuries. Everyone rich and poor is to receive the
mark of the beast, the sign of the cross, in his forehead or right hand. It
concludes in verse 18:
Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number
of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six
hundred threescore and six.
Legend has it that the fruit the serpent gave to Eve was an apple. The
transition from the old 'aval', 'apple', to 'apol', then to Apollo the sun is not
difficult to make. In this sense the Teacher brings down the sun, the fruit
that brings Eve/Coma to rebirth. This dispossesses Jehovah/Jesus, the
creator who rules in the time that man is without the fruit of the tree of
wisdom. This deity is then nothing more than the sun in Pisces, as opposed
to the sun in Aquarius.
At the end of the time when the tree was hewn down, the Teacher comes
and restores all things. For this reason he is the long-sung hero of the
Golden Age. He must do battle with and destroy the beast, and must take on
the entire army of the Philistines, whom he must crush. It may be recalled
that Nostradamus said a man will be sent to destroy churches and sects
altered by fantasy. He destroys him who was the ornament of his age, the
fish-man from the Piscean sea who reincarnates as the sun in Aquarius.
I can think of no passage in Scripture which explains this situation better
than Acts 13: 6—11. We only need know here that 'Bar' means 'son of and
that it then follows that someone called Bar-Jesus is a son of, or devotee of,
that particular god. It reads:
And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain
sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-Jesus:
Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man;
who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.



114 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood
them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.
Then Saul (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes
on him.
And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou
enemy of all Righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of
the Lord?
And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be
blind, not seeing the sun for a season.
As it is, because of the sons of the idol Jesus, we have not seen the
sun on the tree for a season, during the Piscean Age. The sun, you
will recall, is yod the flame, the hand of God which is upon the idol
Jesus when the sun is in the tree.
As for sorcery, it does seem to be a matter of opinion as to pre
cisely what sorcery is. Idolatry is surely the worst kind.
Conclusion
It would seem the epic which ultimately became the Scriptures was being prepared
even as early as the time of Sumer. This has given us a background to what has
been perceived as primitive religion. Even the least aspect of this sun worship, we
might now say, has an intelligible explanation. It is hard to swallow but it does
seem that the old world prepared for us a detailed image which clearly now has no
corresponding reality.
Our argument is now expanding. Having said that the Bible from Genesis onward
has its setting beginning at the dawn of Pisces, two thousand years ago, we now see
that even the Genesis creation is one of the Teacher's epics. Pisces being an age of
water and fishes, the creator is logically seen as a wise fish-man, Jehovah/Jesus,
who is in turn a false god and father to a generation of despoilers of the earth. Thus
he becomes the Beast or Devil who rises from the ocean depth, the abyss. And
again, all this is poetic licence set upon the story of the Star and Sceptre. But in this
instance it is clear that, for all the theories regarding John's number of the beast, 666
proved to be the number of Jesus/Jehovah. It is amusing to note once again that, in
the Italian language, 'fish' is colloquial for the penis. Thus, Roman Catholics can
truly be said to indulge in phallic worship.
But 666 is also one of the prime elements of creation, it figures substantially in
the forming of the cosmic temple/tree. In the next section I shall show that the tree,
the New Jerusalem and stone circles like Stonehenge are one and the same.



THE FISHER KING 115
An element of the evidence presented in this section will be developed as we
progress, namely the matter of the sun in our age being the source of a false god,
which I have referred to in the past tense. The fact of the matter is that this
prophecy applies equally to the future — the events of the Last Days. Here all the
various elements of our story are duplicated and set in opposition to each other,
leaving us to try to distinguish between the true and the false. It is as though the
friction they create is itself the fire from which the phoenix will rise. Thus we see
that this is a means by which creation occurs in both the microcosm and the
macrocosm. But all this leaves us to wonder at the nature of time: whether in fact
there is such a beast.
It is important for us to see that we are dealing here with material that finds its
roots, truth and reality in the unconscious. The 'scientific' approach becomes
irrelevant in these matters. An ancient and well-established form in which the
unseen and unknown feminine is expressed is the spider who weaves the web of
unknowing. An Amerindian story relates this perfectly:
For a very long time all the animal people walked around in the dark bumping
into each other. Each time this happened they would say: 'Oh I'm sorry. You know,
what the world needs is light.' It was the cunning fox who decided to go hunting for
it, and he discovered that the people living on the other side of the world had plenty,
but were not prepared to give any away. Each of the animal people tried to capture
some, but they all failed. For example the eagle, who originally had a fine feathered
head, tried carrying some light back on top of it. Not only did it go out, it burnt all
his head feathers, which is why the American eagle is now a bald eagle.
After all of them had tried and failed they gathered together in the darkness,
bemoaning their condition. In a quiet moment they heard a very small voice say: 'I
will fetch the light for you.' 'Who is that?' they all cried. 'Your Grandmother Spider.'
The animal people laughed and laughed: 'Grandmother, you are far too small.' The
little voice replied: 'I am your grandmother, and the Great Spirit made me so that I
might bring light into your world.'
They decided they had nothing to lose, and Grandmother Spider spun a basket in
which to carry the light. As she set off she spun a thread by which she would be
able to find her way back. The thread was spun from time.
When she returned, her basket was full of light. Today, when the people walk
amid the colour and beauty of the world, they always remember their Grandmother
Spider. For them she is not an object of fear, she is a symbol of love and sacrifice.

Ezekiel's Wheels
Earlier I drew attention to the closing of the book of Daniel. Chapter
12, verse 9 reads:
And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till
the time of the end.
Those things not given to be understood are amplified in chapter 4, verses 10
11, when the king has another dream:
I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was
great.
The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven,
and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:
Later he sees a watcher come down from heaven. Verse 14:
He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches,
shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit:
The effect that this event is to have upon mankind is given in verse
16. It more than adequately describes what man would be in our age
without the governing priests:
Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto
him; and let seven times pass over him.
In Daniel 7: 9 the Teacher is referred to as the Ancient of days:
I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit,
whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool:
his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.
In the following verse we learn specifically of the opening of
the books:



EZEKIEL'S WHEELS 117
A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands
ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him:
the judgement was set, and the books were opened.
The result of this event is given in Daniel 12:10:
Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do
wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall
understand.
The books to be opened are quite clearly the sixty-six books of the Bible, but
our main concern here is with the fiery wheels, which are the source of this
revelation. In John 21 we have the story of the miraculous catch of one
hundred and fifty-three fishes. In verse 9 Jesus has prepared a bed of fiery
coals to cook the fish. What we find is the fiery wheels being referred to in
allegory as a means of doing this, which is the preparation of mercurial
wisdom. This is obtained from those whom John Dee describes as the
inhabitants of the outer void. Nostradamus speaks of trembling with fear as
the god sits nearby (Century 1:2).
In Revelation 4: 6-8 John is taken up in the spirit, and we see another
example of the prophet's experience as he walks through the stones:
And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the
midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes
before and behind.
And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the
third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.
And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were
full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy,
Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.
We also find a description of the four cardinal points on the tree in Ezekiel. This
— the Merkabah — was the throne chariot of the sun. It had the zodiac as its
wheels. The face of a man is Aquarius = South, the lion is Leo = East, the eagle is
Scorpio = North, and the ox is Coma, the West. Chapter 1, verses 4-6 read:



118 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great
cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the
midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.
Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures.
And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.
And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
It continues in chapter 1, verses 9-11:
Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went;
they went every one straight forward.
As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the
face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left
side; they four also had the face of an eagle.
Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of
every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
The 'great cloud' of verse 4 is the pillar of a cloud that led the children of Israel in
their desert wanderings (Exodus 13: 21). Ezekiel's description concludes in verse
13:
As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like
burning coals of fire...
In Ezekiel 5: 1 we have a very strange statement which explains the purpose of
the Nazarite ritual:
And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor,
and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee
balances to weigh, and divide the hair.
The hair is Coma and the scales are Libra, which is the stone of the earth. He
goes on to say that, being divided into three, the hair must be one third burned with
fire in the midst of the city (the tree), another third finely chopped and another
scattered to the wind. Hair has long since been a source of superstition. It is said to
be the abode of spirits, and should be burned when it is cut. Witches are said to
acquire power to cast spells with a lock of someone's hair. Even the word 'spell' has
come down to us from its original meaning, the spelling of a secret word of power
by



EZEKIEL'S WHEELS 119
sound and number upon the tree. And can it be that arachno-phobia (fear of
spiders) points to unconscious awareness of the Goddess Coma, whose
primary manifestation is as Ariadne, the Spider Queen?
It is clear that basic elements of this story go beyond the conscious mind.
Even the puns and superstitions are part of our daily lives. Until
metrication in Britain a dozen was 12 and a baker's dozen was 13. Bread,
as has been said, is wisdom.
Exodus 24: 4 says:
And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in
the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars,
according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
In the previous verse, our Moses/Teacher told the people 'all the words
of the Lord', but that's another matter. We are concerned here with his
building an ancient stone circle. In Ezekiel 10 we encounter a sapphire
stone which appears as a throne; then the man dressed in white linen must
go between the wheels and fill his hands with burning coals. In verses 9-12
the wheels are described. Verse 9 reads:
And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one
wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the
appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.
In this instance each gem has an association with a particular sign of the
zodiac. It continues in verses 10 and 11:
And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a
wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.
When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as
they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it;
they turned not as they went.
The process being described here is that of dividing the tree into two
stone circles, one within the other. This is precisely the process which Plato
terms 'the same and the other'. Ancient megalithic constructions such as
Stonehenge depict in stone the process which Ezekiel describes. Perhaps,
when the heavens are in their proper places, the stone circles which tap
lines of energy that run through



120 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
the earth may, as tradition has it, dance the dance of the stones. And Jesus
the Teacher is the Lord of the Dance. The means by which I arrived at the
arrangement in Diagram 7 was long and laborious. I present it simply on
the principle that it is logical and speaks for itself.
Diagram 7
To form these circles of stones we need only look to the Sphinx, which
guards the Great Pyramid (pyramid means 'fire in the centre'). It has the
head of a woman and the body of a lion; I take this to imply that we should
divide the tree through Leo and Virgo, on to Libra the earth and to Gemini
the twins or two halves.
The Great Pyramid has often been referred to as the Bible in stone,



EZEKIEL'S WHEELS 121
which is exactly what it is. If we see the tree in three-dimensional form and
open the pyramid at the juncture of the King's and Queen's Chambers, Leo
and Virgo, it is apparent that it is a cosmic temple. The place of its missing
capstone may be seen to be the position where Coma should be (Diagram
8).
Diagram 8
Thus we may claim to have found the missing capstone. Ironically, the
source of its reparation, the sun, has been daily in full view since the
pyramid was built. It is amusing to consider that the sole purpose for
building the Pyramid of Cheops was as a platform advertising the absence
of this thirteenth stone. It is from this missing piece of masonry in the
genitalia of the temple that we derive the idea of circumcision. It has been
remarked that the Scrolls make no mention of this ritual, it being the case
that after



122 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
the Teacher comes the tree is complete. In Scripture it is the cosmic temple
and not men that are circumcised.
At some stage in his quest to conquer ignorance, our ancient shaman
discovered that the Creator was a geometer and mathematician. Ancient
man realized that everything in nature worked according to a numerical
scheme. Once he uncovered these universal numbers and measures he was
able to imitate in microcosm the work of the Great Architect of the
Universe. By balancing the wheels and stones of the tree in perfect number,
he set the harmonics that permitted his transition through the stones.
As previously mentioned, the Bible has an underlying scheme of
numerology. By this, I do not refer to anything like what is popularly
associated with modern astrology, tarot cards, flying saucers and things that
go bump in the night.
The people who wrote the Bible were, in their own minds, at war. They
held in their hands the most important scientific discovery man would ever
make. It was to be transported through enemy lines to their spiritual
children. The underlying text of Scripture is therefore written in highly
complex secret code. In many respects modern astrology and numerology
have only served to deter the serious investigator from looking more
closely at these ancient sacred sciences.
The Hebrew/Aramaic of the Old Testament and the Greek Koine of the
New Testament differ from modern written languages in one particular
respect that has already been mentioned: where we use separate symbols
for numbers, they did not. Thus any word in the original written languages
of Scripture may be read both as a word and as a series of numbers. We
saw earlier that the Hebrew letters — Yod, He, Vau, He — spell the
name Jehovah. As
number symbols they are respectively 10,5,6,5. Thus the number of the
name Jehovah is a total of 26. The biblical Greek letters
respectively represent the numbers 10, 8, 200, 70, 400, 200. If we add them
together they total 888. As letters they spell — in biblical Greek — 'Jesus'.
The word translated 'cross' has a value of 777 and, as we have seen, 'Satan'
has a value of 666. These symbolize forces upon the cross/tree which has
the divine number (777). With this system as a basis, the Bible enshrines all
manner of highly complex codes. The simplest of these include the reading
of only the first, middle and last letters of each word as a coherent sentence.
Another method is to relate words which, though they have different
meanings, have the same number value.



EZEKIEL'S WHEELS 123
Freemasonry has as its logo the square and compasses, obviously a
derivative of the star/shield of David. These symbolize the drawing of
architectural designs of the tree hidden in the text of Scripture and other
sacred writings, as may be seen in the following.
In City of Revelation (pages 63-65), John Michell explains the geometry
and sacred numbers of Stonehenge. He says that, of all ancient monuments,
this site can be most certainly identified as an example of the cosmic
temple. The dimensions of the stone circles, he finds, are the same as those
of the New Jerusalem on a reduced scale. The geometry of the ground plan
differs only in one respect from St John's city: that, whereas the city is in
the form of a square, Stonehenge is circular. But in their measurements, the
temple and the city are identical; both arise from one scheme of number
and proportion. Just as we may now trace Christianity back to the earliest
times, it is now possible to see that this ancient megalithic construction was
one of its centres.
Stonehenge consists of two concentric stone circles which contain two
U-shaped structures. Michell uses the measurements given by Professor
Atkinson in Stonehenge and E. H. Stone in The Stones of Stonehenge. The
outer circle comprised thirty pillars of Wiltshire sarsen, of which only
seventeen remain. They supported a continuous ring of thirty lintels which
have now been reduced to six. The inner circle was formerly made up of
some sixty bluestones. The outer cove consists of five detached trilithons.
The inner cove originally consisted of nineteen bluestones, in a semicircle
extended in two arms. The altar stone is a block of green micaceous
sandstone.
According to Atkinson the inner faces of the remaining stones of the
bluestone semicircle are on the circumference of a circle which has a
diameter of 39.5 feet, which Michell takes as 39.6 feet. Atkinson estimates
the diameter of the bluestone circle of some sixty stones to be 75 feet;
Stone calculates 76.5 feet. The figure suggested by Michell is 79.2 feet.
According to Stone's measurements, the outer sarsen circle has an
average gap between the pillars of 3.52 feet. The average length given for
the lintels is three times this measure, 10.56 feet. With thirty such lintels,
the mean circumference of their circle is 30 x 10.56 which is 316.8 feet.
Stone gives the diameter of the great sarsen circle as 100.75 feet, the
circumference 316.5 feet; Michell says that the correct measurement of the
diameter is 100.82 feet and the circumference 316.8 feet. This last figure is
a hundredth part of 6 miles, which happens to be



124 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
the measure around the New Jerusalem. The number 3168 is most
prominent in cabalistic numerology; it is the number by gematria of the
principal holy name in Christianity, Lord
Jesus Christ.
Put in other terms, the perimeter of the cube of the New Jerusalem is
48,000 furlongs, or 31,680,000 feet. If reduced to 316.8 feet, it is the
perimeter of the Stonehenge sarsen circle. Within the square there is
contained the circular wall of 144 cubits, equal to 248 feet in circumference
and 79.2 feet in diameter. This corresponds to the Stonehenge bluestone
circle. The diameter of the inner circle of the New Jerusalem is 39.6 feet,
the same as that of the bluestone semi-circle. Michell goes on to say that, if
the Stonehenge sarsen circle were rearranged in a square of equal
perimeter, it would exactly contain the bluestone circle, and the whole
figure would be identical in form and dimensions with the New Jerusalem
of Revelation 21. The New Jerusalem is therefore a Stonehenge with the
circle squared.
Genesis 31: 45-46 says:
And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. And Jacob said unto
his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap:
and they did eat there upon the heap.
Unless it were bread (wisdom) and water (the words of God) which they
consumed, these verses are obviously complete nonsense and their content
is not otherwise worth relating.
In Genesis 35: 17 Rachael/Arachne is in labour with her son
Benjamin/Gemini. In verse 19 she dies and is buried at Bethlehem (the
house of wisdom), where Jacob sets up another pillar. Thus she is interred
precisely where she will rise up (within the zodiac) when the stone is rolled
away. Rachael was mother to Joseph, of whom it is said in Genesis 49: 24:
...(from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)
As I have said, the Goddess is buried precisely where she is to rise up
with her husband/son, the Sun/Star/Teacher.
In Exodus 28: 9-10 the names of the twelve tribes are to be engraved on
two stones 'according to their birth'. In Joshua 4: 7 Joshua teaches the
response to the question: 'What mean ye by these stones?' He says:



EZEKIEL'S WHEELS 125
Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before
the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of
Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children
of Israel for ever.
That the waters were cut off means that the words of God were cut off.
These same stones at Stonehenge are said to sit upon and tap lines of
energy that flow through the earth in grid patterns (ley lines).
Ancient man began his building projects as early as about 9000 BCE. In
Britain alone there are more than 900 stone circles, and another 800 are
located in West Africa. Easter Island is ringed by massive stone statues
which seem to be designed to deter intruders. It is possible that this island
lay on an ancient trade route and that its inhabitants were an ancient
kingdom of priests.
At the entrance to Chaco Canyon in New Mexico, the Anasazi used the
southeast face of Fafada Butte to produce a very precise calendar of stone.
The inhabitants of this canyon managed a very successful trading
community. They constructed large-scale irrigation systems and hundreds
of miles of roads. One of their buildings, the Pueblo Bonito, was multi
storeyed and comprised some eight hundred rooms.
From what modern man has so far learned of these ancient sites, the
objective seems to have been twofold. By the practice of what the Chinese
term feng-shui, the aim was to tap into the earth's energy flows: ch'i. We
refer to these as ley lines; to some of the Aboriginal Australian tribes this
energy was known as kurunba and in Japan it was called ki. Jerusalem is
obviously one of the points on earth where this force is manifest. Secondly,
ancient calendars repeatedly demonstrate the need to measure very
accurately four points in the year: the summer and winter solstices and the
vernal and autumnal equinoxes. These concerns indicate the need to find
the very precise time and place for the priest to walk through the stones and
into the next dimension.
Standing stones are often credited with the power of prophecy, healing
and fertility. The menhir at Stanton Drew in England is linked with that at
Ka-Ur in Gambia; they are both said to be petrified members of a wedding
party, perhaps the wedding of the New Jerusalem, the sun and Coma. Of
the Rollright Stones near Oxford, the Kingstone and the Whispering
Knights dolmen are said to go each night to a stream to drink. They were
once a king



126 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
and his knights who were turned to stone by a witch. Certainly the only
water stones would drink is that which imbues them with wisdom. Dipped
in the earth, they are baptized in its spirit.
The tree is not simply the lifeless diagram we saw initially. It is a
geodetic grid which describes the flow of energy through the universe and
through its microcosm, the human body. Man is, upon the web, a vibration
of the energy patterns that form the universe in which we live. The tree
harmonizes these two. Common to all creation myths is the idea that God
uttered a word or sound that caused everything to be. The mystical St John
begins his gospel saying:
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God.
I have already mentioned the legend that the Essenes were guardians of a
secret word of 72 letters, which they would not divulge even on pain of
death. This may not be actually true, but truth lies within it.
John goes on to designate Jesus the Teacher as a creator. This has come
to be taken literally. But again, as is common in many myths, the creator's
spermatozoa is wisdom/knowledge from which the earth conceives a new
mankind in her watery womb, and this happens when her eggs, or stones,
are ripe for fertilization, the time between ages when the earth moves from
one constellation to another. It is then that the eggs are laid and the wisdom
fish sprays his wisdom seed upon them.
The Aboriginal people of Western Australia speak of this process in the
Churinga (Dreamtime = Creation), when Lightning Man, who
astrologically is Orion, came and with his lightning brought into being the
Rainbow Snake of Creation. The eggs that the snake laid are the stars of the
Milky Way; subsequently each one became a different tribe of the peoples
of the earth. During the Churinga, people communicated through sacred
stones. These were said to fall from heaven. If a man was murdered he was
hung upon a tree and sacred stones were set in a special configuration.
These would point to his killer, the Sceptre avenging the killing of the
Teacher.
In Revelation 6: 13 the stars fall from heaven; they are the Teacher's
revelation on earth:



EZEKIEL'S WHEELS 127
And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth
her untimely figs...
In the following verse we see this event occur when 'the heaven
departed', that being the end of an age. This is logically the end of Pisces
and beginning of Aquarius. At this time there begins a mass destruction by
fire and flood which ultimately consumes (it is estimated from Scripture)
between two-thirds and three-quarters of mankind. In Genesis 9: 11-13
God gives His word to Noah/Jesus that he will never again strike the earth
with flood and tells him that the rainbow shall be a sign of His covenant
with man.
The rainbow is an arc of prismatic colours appearing in the heavens,
opposite the sun. Each colour can be associated with a tone of the octave
which is then divided by thirteen.
Let us accordingly turn to the story of Joseph and his coat of many
colours, which makes him the many-hued sun, or creator of the rainbow.
His name means 'increaser'. He was the eleventh son of Jacob, who is
himself a standing stone; the sun sits upon the eleventh sephirah on the
tree, which increases the zodiac to thirteen. He was also the first son of
Rachael, who is the biblical Ariadne, the spider. In Genesis 30: 24 it is said:
And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to
me another son.
The son to be added is, of course, Jesus the Teacher who is the son of the
widow spider, fathered upon her by Joseph the sun.
In Genesis 37 it is said that Jacob loved Joseph more than his other boys
and so made him a coat of many colours. This designates him as of brighter
appearance than his brothers, who were jealous and hated him, and planned
his destruction. In the mean time we have been told that Dinah (the moon),
Jacob's only daughter, has been defiled, that is to say her genitalia have
been interfered with, so her position on the tree is to be that of Coma, who
disappears when Joseph the sun is put away. We also learn that Reuben
(Aquarius) has slept with his father's concubine; hence it is he who is to
usurp his father or replace him.
Later the brothers go out without Joseph to feed the flock and he comes
upon them. They plan to kill him, but it is Reuben (Aquarius) who
convinces them they should only throw him into a pit, from which he later
arranges his rescue. Joseph then becomes



128 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
the bright light of Egypt, where he manages the feeding of the people
during the time of famine, which, most likely, comes about for want
of wisdom (bread).
The era being described is Pisces. The brothers (stars) are feeding
the sheep from the tree of life and sorrow, which, without Joseph,
has no power of generation because it is subsequently without
Coma.
In chapter 40 he is in an Egyptian dungeon (deep in Egypt's vag
ina), and there he interprets dreams for Pharaoh's butler and baker.
The butler's dream (verses 9-11) is related thus:
...behold, a vine was before me;
And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and
her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand...
Joseph the sun has been taken from the tree and is in prison in the
allegorical Sodom and Egypt; there are therefore only three branches
or orbs on the centre of the tree, which is now only fit for allegorical
Egyptians (gentiles). In verse 15 he says:
For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews...
The baker then tells his dream (verses 16-17):
...I had three white baskets on my head:
And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for
Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
The interpretation (in verse 19) is:
Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall
hang thee on a tree...
Since Joseph is shut away, the butler has only three stones on the
tree and the baker's wisdom is to be cut off, just as John the Baptist
was to be beheaded and Jesus was to be hung upon a tree. Joseph
goes on to find fame and fortune among the Egyptians, upon whom
he fathers Israel, and is eventually reunited with his family. Sub
sequently the sons of Jacob are given their astrological designations,
such as with Reuben in Genesis 49: 3-4, he being Aquarius:



EZEKIEL'S WHEELS 129
Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my
strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:
Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel...
It is at this point, the dawn of the Golden Age, that under the leadership
of Joshua the Sceptre King the Israelites enter the promised land. The first
place where they make camp in Israel is Gilgal. In Joshua 4:19-20 we find:
And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first
month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua
pitch in Gilgal.
Gilgal means 'wheel'. It is spelt (right to left) If we do with
the letters what the word says, we have the swastika or wheel
of the sun. With its circle of twelve stones Gilgal becomes a holy place, a
sort of Stonehenge which later goes into captivity.
In The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth, John M. Allegro has
uncovered more than a few Bible mysteries. He finds a logical link (pages
196-197) between Gilgal and Golgotha. In such cases, one must remember
that the Old Testament script is written without vowels and is thus open to
coded interpretation. Golgotha means 'skull' (the place of the skull); it is the
site of the crucifixion. Its actual whereabouts is unknown and, historically
speaking, can be dismissed as yet another piece of dramatic New Testament
fiction. It is found in Matthew 27:33, Mark 15: 22 and John 19: 17.
Logically, it is in Bethlehem where Rachael (Arachne), Joseph's mother,
was buried beneath a stone. It will be recalled that I said earlier that
Matthew was concerned with the Sceptre, while Luke was concerned with
the Star. In Luke 23: 33 Jesus is crucified at Calvary. Verse 31 reads:
For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the
dry?
Interpreted, if they hang the Teacher because of the tree of eleven
sephiroth, what would they do in the time (Piscean Age) of the tree of ten
sephiroth?
Where 'Golgotha' means 'skull', 'Calvary' means 'bare skull'. A



130 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
reasonable interpretation would be that, whereas the Sceptre died in the
time of the head (crown) of hair, the Teacher died in the time of the tree
with no hair. Gilgal was the wheel of the sun; Golgotha, its derivative, is
the place of the head of hair.
Conclusion
In this section I have demonstrated that the Bible provides operational instructions
for the tree. I have also, by looking at Joseph, given further evidence of Bible
allegory.
But, much more to the point, by introducing Stonehenge and the Pyramid of
Cheops into the argument, the matter has been given more substance. The reader
may now perceive a greater unity of thought and belief in the ancient world. That
which till now was essentially confined to the Scriptures may be seen on a grander
scale. Where we began with a highly eccentric claim we now have growing
substance. Joseph with his coat of many colours may be, it seems, a means of
finding the secret name of God, which was used to enter the tree.
The mysteries of the ancients have exercised many, both expert researcher and
inspired dreamer. Some of the conclusions reached stand as a testimony to the
fantastically inventive imagination of man. We are far from the conclusion of our
Grail quest, yet we have resolved many problems and found many answers.
Unfortunately our solutions are laced with venom. I am not unaware that this
material is, in many aspects, extremely offensive. But I insist that it is unfair to
punish the musician because the piano is out of tune. It would be a great pity to
dismiss so substantial a step forward because of petty and destructive religious
preconceptions. The sum total of a human being, as opposed to a beast, is his
knowledge and its relationship to bare reality.
That which is truly amazing is the basis for our information. As I have said, the
tree in its diagrammatic form is common knowledge: there is an endless number of
books in which it may be found. All I did was add one extra orb to it. I then gave a
double meaning to three or four biblical words, and the rest was easy and eminently
logical. The limitations are equally obvious, inasmuch as modern language and
presentation greatly limit one's ability to transmit this information. At best, I can
only provide a diagram where the poetic is required. In a book such as this, the
transcendental must be captured by the reader's mind. The Bible was not primarily
intended as a literal document: its truths are poetic, rising from deep within the
hidden self.
Deep down in the unconscious there is a vast silver web, and at its centre



EZEKIEL'S WHEELS 131
sits the spider waiting for her prey. Come too close and madness will entangle you
in that web. But step lightly, listening in the silence to the music and rhythm of the
spheres, and she will take you as her consort, revealing all things. For Wisdom is
her name.
We have nothing to fear in this hidden realm of the unconscious mind: it is fear
itself that is our undoing. In the natural world the only prey taken are the weak. A
phrase we shall encounter in respect of this matter is 'the fearful and unbelieving',
these being destined for destruction. Spiritual strength and the power and ability to
look truth in the face will be the foundations of a world built upon the rock. In this,
we shall discover, lie the future and destiny of mankind. This will be the character
of the Tomorrow People. Without self-deception fathered by fear, men will not
stumble. This, I contend, is the choice that evolution is now thrusting upon us.
It will be seen that the modern world, in which we seek to cosset and shield
ourselves from the privations of nature, is working against us — in putting us off
our guard. Our growing reliance upon machines, which by their coldness announce
that they alone constitute the real world, is a mighty deception. Mother nature, or
Grandmother Spider — call her what you will — can make us prey at any moment.
As we progress it will become increasingly clear that it is in this very urgent
respect that the documents of the ancient world speak to us. They urge us to let go
external reality and grasp it at source within the deepest recesses of our minds. Thus
it will become apparent that we are engaged upon a journey into the most secret
places of the ancient science of alchemy.
It is in respect of this ancient science that I feel bound to urge the reader to
dismiss any idea that our prehistoric ancestors were in any way 'primitive' or
superstitious. It is quite clear that the magi knew that time is only that which
separates the coagulated lumps of light waves we call matter. From the measures of
the ancient temple, it is obvious they were aware of the harmonic of 2C, where C =
144,000. These are truly the one hundred and forty-four thousand redeemed among
men. They also knew that this is The Pulse of the Universe. To be sure, it is in The
Book.
Likewise, the earlier mentioned number 3168, which is the value of 'Lord Jesus
Christ' and a measure of Stonehenge, must have been known to the Essenes. Pliny,
who was a member of the order, uses it as a measure of the earth in Historia
Naturalis.



Book II



8
The Conspiracy Against the Heresy
It will probably be clear to the reader that the keys to the material in this
book came from the Dead Sea Scrolls. Without them, compiling all this
information would have been out of the question as far as I was concerned.
Curiously enough my sources are more the earlier than the later
publications. And even then that material was in circulation for a
considerable time before I was in a position to use it or indeed had any
interest in doing so.
The efforts to delay or prevent publication of the Scrolls were quite
helpful to me because they aroused my suspicions. Attempts at
disinformation were also advantageous, because they were obvious and
served to focus my attention.
The nature of this material is such that, once you have the basic keys, the
rest is really quite straightforward. The Scrolls open every door, precisely
as they are intended to do.
I cannot help but wonder how much those crafty old monks from the
Ecole Biblique really knew and understood. Eisenman and Wise ultimately
published The Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered, the result of a bitter struggle to
release material which, after more than forty years, was still being held
back.
This corpus of material consists largely of fragments, and as a separate
body it is very heavily cabalistic. One of these texts, 'The Birth of Noah' (4
Q 534-536),18 is significant in that it is written in the future tense,
discussing the Covenant God made with Noah, as was the case with the
Teacher, and clearly denotes him as a revealer of mysteries. That is to say it
strongly supports my argument that the latter-day Teacher is both Noah and
Jesus. From the little amount of time I have been able to give to it, I can see
that the material Eisenman was instrumental in having published will prove
very helpful in the next stage of the investigation.
Control of the Scrolls was originally given by the Jordanian Government
to the Ecole Biblique, a French school of the Dominican Order. This school
established the so-called international team, to which it gave the power of
royal descendance. That is, the team nominated replacements as they were
required, almost all of these being drawn from Catholic circles.
One exception — a token non-sectarian — was John M. Allegro,



136 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
who published a translation of the Copper Scroll (see also J. T. Milik in
Revue Biblique 1959). Not being bound by the restrictions of the Vatican,
and as witness to the damning nature of the Scrolls for Christianity, Allegro
produced The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross.19 There is much within that
text that I would dispute, but I do not question his scholarship. There can
be little doubt that the book was not so much a serious study as an earnest
attempt to bring matters out into the open — there is no question that he
was becoming increasingly frustrated with his fellow committee members.
He seems to have been something of a virgin in a whorehouse, not able to
calculate the power of the political machines that ground away in Rome
and Israel.
After the publication of the book he was hounded by his fellow
committee members. Ultimately his health failed and he died. The
committee continued in its imperious way, its motives being easily
discernible. I feel confident in saying that there exists no precedent in
biblical and archaeological research for the degree of skulduggery that has
surrounded the Scrolls.
The Dead Sea documents tell of a period of forty years after the coming
of the Teacher in which Israel is gathered. During this time of trial there are
many who join the community only to prove unsuitable. This unsuitability
causes problems and schisms within the organization, and these are
sometimes brought to crisis by people who prove to be under the influence
of negative forces. After these forty years, the community is closed and
Israel is gathered. The separation between the Jews and the Gentiles has
been made. During this timespan, only those who accept the Teacher's
interpretation of the Law may remain (refer Damascus Rule).20 This not
only harmonizes with Scripture but also confirms the concept that Israel is
a spiritually evolved species rather than a racial entity. All are welcome
who will live within the statutes.
Accordingly Moses brought together the Law and led the children of
Israel in the desert for forty years, from which, under Joshua the Sceptre,
they entered the promised land (Joshua 1: 10-11). These two heroes are
described in their roles as 'milk', the Teacher, and 'meat', the Sceptre,
bringing the people into the promised land in I Corinthians 3: 2. The
elements separating the false Christians and Jews from the true are drawn
out in the story of the two sons born to Abraham. Ishmael was born of the
bondwoman Hagar and Isaac was born of Sarah, his wife. That is to say,
one is legitimate and the other illegitimate, one is born free and the other



THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE HERESY 137
to slavery. In the story Ishmael persecutes Isaac. There are many instances
throughout Scripture where God is seen to choose one above another in
what seems an irrational manner. This all begins in Genesis 3: 15. Christian
tradition erroneously has it that the Arab nations are the descendants of
Ishmael. My interpretation is that, in a modern setting, the matter of
withholding the Scrolls is part of this Last Days epic: the Light is now at
war with the Dark.
Scripturally, Israel and Judah are spiritual Ishmaelites, referred to as wild
asses. In this respect, Genesis 16:12 says of Ishmael:
And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every
man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
That is to say, as a son of Abraham he will dwell in Israel — among his
brethren. That his hand is against every man and every man's hand is
against him is something that might be prophetically applied to modern
Jewry.
On the principle of 'As above, so below', God takes Egypt — the entire
Babylonian gentile world of today, in which we may include modern Jewry
— as a wife and begets Israel and Judah. This I take to convey the concept
of evolution, wherein God fathers the higher life-form upon the beasts;
these new creatures are subsequently and initially asses. Hosea 11: 1 says
that Israel, as a child, was called out of Egypt. Matthew 2: 15 applies this
prophecy to King Jesus, saying 'Out of Egypt have I called my son'. It need
only be pointed out that, being infertile, Sarah (also Sarai) the Goddess wife
of Abraham 'gave' Abraham/God her maid Hagar/Egypt as a wife, but
Exodus 21 quietly nullifies this arrangement. In this sense, Moses the
Teacher acts as a midwife to Egypt the mother of Israel. We accordingly
find that Moses is repeatedly called to Pharaoh before Egypt is ready to let
the people go. Ultimately the Aquarian waters break and Israel crosses the
(blood-) Red Sea. Allegorical Egypt, it seems, is destined to die in
childbirth.
Accordingly, when Israel experiences famine, it is to mother Egypt that
she turns for sustenance, and in the desert wanderings, when God chastises
his ass-like child, Israel seeks to return to that same mother Egypt.
In Jeremiah 2: 24 Israel is likened to a wild ass; likewise in Hosea 8: 9
Israel is a wild ass alone in Assyria. In Exodus 13: 13, in the law of the
firstling according to which the firstborn males are to be



138 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
given to God, the ass is to be redeemed with the sacrifice of a lamb, and
Jesus is that sacrificial lamb.
After the celebration of Passover, Israel the ass — the issue of the
marriage of heaven and earth celebrated as the marriage feast of the New
Jerusalem in Revelation — becomes Israel the sheep. Ultimately Ishmael
and Hagar, the false Israel — sons of Abraham and the world in slavery
allegorized as Egypt — are thrown out, whereupon Isaac, the true son of
Abraham and the Goddess, is born. All this is neatly confirmed in Galatians
4: 22-26:
For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the
other by a freewoman.
But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the
freewoman was by promise.
Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from
the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which
now is, and is in bondage with her children.
But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
Appendices I and II show absolutely and conclusively that the Old and
New Testaments — Old and New Covenants — are bound inextricably and
irrevocably as one book. This thus confirms that those who constitute the
present Israel are, biblically, Ishmaelites, who will be cast out as were
Hagar and Ishmael. As is evidenced by both the Old Testament and the
Scrolls, the circumcision of man's — the tree's — genitalia was to be
superseded by the circumcision of the heart.
The evidence is now quite conclusive: the Essenes created the Bible as a
vastly complex and all-encompassing version of the prophecies of
Nostradamus. In writing it, they established historical, or false, Israel. They
did so as a means of creating the true one. The actions of the wild man (the
traditional nation) would eventually drive a remnant of mankind to higher
consciousness. We must experience evil in order to rise above it; we must
be slaves before we can be free.
II Thessalonians 2: 3-12 reads:
Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except
there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of
perdition;



THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE HERESY 139
Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or
that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God,
shewing himself that he is God.
Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these
things?
And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in
his time.
For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.
And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall con
sume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the bright
ness of his coming:
Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all
power and signs and lying wonders,
And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish;
because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they
should believe a lie:
That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had
pleasure in unrighteousness.
John the Baptist's community has been in existence for twenty years
when the Teacher arrives to lead them in the forty-year sojourn.
In the commentary on Habakkuk we encounter the 'Liar', the 'Spouter of
Lies' and the 'Wicked Priest'. In the Damascus Rule he seems also to be the
'Scoffer'. Here he opposes the Righteousness Teacher, and as the Wicked
Priest he is the leader of Israel and leads them astray. That he should be the
head of the Teacher's community appears contradictory if he begins by
opposing him.
Paul says '...except there come a falling away', and this can only refer to
a falling away from this new gathering. However the Wicked Priest could
well be a leader of existing Israel, a false Messiah.
The Teacher comes and makes his revelation, which is severely criticized
by many but is nevertheless very popular. Very large numbers of people
join the community, which is bound by strict rules. The Teacher dies, many
find adherence to the law oppressive and difficult; the Spouter of Lies, who
has begun criticizing the Teacher, then steps forward and offers this group a
more relaxed and liberal approach: the law is slackened. This is the falling
away. On the principle that one needs to shift a lot of dirt



140 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
before one can hope to find a little gold, quite clearly many people must
come and go before this community is set to conquer the world. The man
of sin arises from within it, possibly labelling the Teacher as a fanatic and
extremist and eventually proclaiming the false Messiah, who is from the
existing, traditional Israel.
That the Spouter of Lies begins as one of the Teacher's apostles gives us
a new view of Judas as a betrayer of Jesus. In Matthew 26: 23 the
Nazarene tells the apostles that he (Judas) who dips the bread (wisdom)
with him is the one who will betray him. That his name is Judas may imply
(prophetically) that his betrayer is a modern Jew. We may also now see
that the entire Old Testament epic, in which Israel is unfaithful to God and
experiences chastisement through war and conquest, is just another
prophetic version of this Last Days epic.
In the first instance, this Liar is in direct conflict with the Revealer of
Mysteries. He may or may not be responsible for his demise — it is hard to
tell. As many have quite rightly pointed out, it is impossible to see from the
Scrolls if we are dealing with one or two individuals. The Liar oppressed
the Teacher even to the house of his exile. In Exodus Pharaoh opposed
Moses and pursued him and Israel to his own destruction in the Red Sea
when it parted and then drowned his army. Quite clearly the Teacher's
doctrine must be popular with the people but bitterly opposed by authority.
Without any textual support, but on the basis of logic, we seem to be
looking at two separate characters. The Spouter of Lies/Liar is the false
prophet (anti-Teacher) and the Wicked Priest is the false Messiah. The
Wicked Priest becomes the leader of a large part of this spiritual nation as
well as of traditional Israel. He defiles himself and the Temple, then leads
the people astray. The key to this conundrum is that everything exists in
opposing duplicates.
It may be possible, as far as the Old Testament is concerned, to
tentatively identify the Wicked Priest with the Lucifer of Isaiah 14: 12. He
was King of Babylon and son of the morning. Contrary to popular belief,
Satan and Lucifer are two apparently different entities. Lucifer was a king,
not an angel. In Ezekiel 28 he is the prince of Tyrus (Tyre).
Basically and simply, in the Scrolls the Wicked Priest starts off with
great wisdom and knowledge, this being after the death of the Teacher.
Hence he is the son of the Morning Star. But he defiles himself with wealth
and exalts himself above God. All this must also be seen as involving a
process in which Israel is tested and



THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE HERESY 141
purified of any weaknesses. He makes war against the saints. Thus he must
persecute those faithful to the Revealer of Mysteries.
What makes these characters difficult to distinguish is that one tends to
look at them solely from an inside-the-community perspective, but they
obviously also play roles that generally and increasingly set them centre
stage in international affairs. Thus, if these events are to occur, the Wicked
Priest may well be a religious leader of traditional Israel — perhaps even
attractive to Christianity — when he leads a large part of the Teacher's
community astray.
In Ezekiel 28 we have the following statements. In verse 2:
Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, ...Thou hast said, I am a God, I
sit in the seat of God...
In verse 13:
Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy
covering...
Verse 14:
Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth...thou hast walked up and down in
the midst of the stones of fire.
Verse 15:
Thou wast perfect in thy ways...
Verse 16:
...and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of
fire.
Lucifer means 'light'; the King of Tyre obviously has access to the tree as
one of the Sons of Light.
In the New Testament we have Jesus the Teacher whom Rome crucifies
with substantial support from the Jews. In a modern context this would
suggest collusion between Rome and Israel. We have already begun to see
this in the matter of the publication of the Scrolls. Much later, in Matthew,
Herod is eager to have the life of the baby Jesus/Sceptre. The Edomite
Herod does seem to fit the role of the Antichrist as far as the New
Testament is concerned.



142 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
I began this section by asking how much a select bit of Catholic
academia knew when it tried to suppress the Scrolls. What I hope to have
demonstrated above in respect of the Wicked Priest is that such
possibilities must have been seen by members of the Scrolls team. They
were, after all, supposed to be the world's leading experts on Scripture.
They have had all available resources at their disposal, and it cannot be
said that none was aware of comparable elements in myth in general, nor
could any of them deny an awareness of the Bible's cabalistic tendencies.
Many of these 'experts' are religionists, and some must have a conception
of the Last Days, the return of Christ etc. In my own case, I am not a paid
expert, nor do I have any religious preconceptions. I have not spoken to
any angels, nor have I had any ecstatic dreams in which all was revealed to
me. I am an enthusiastic amateur.
I ask readers, as they progress through the rest of this text, to keep this
point in mind. How is it that, with the Scrolls at their exclusive disposal,
the contents of this book appear so extraordinary at this late stage — 49
years after the Qumran discoveries? Surely, honest scholarship should by
now have led us down this path. I do not like to use the word 'conspiracy',
but the findings of this book, among many others, force the issue.
There is something afoot in relation to these matters that is going to have
an immeasurable impact on us all. The focal point is modern Israel's
building of the Temple in Jerusalem before the end of this century, an event
which will be a disaster for the whole of mankind. If current political
processes lead to Palestine becoming a separate and autonomous state,
Israel will have further grounds for declaring Jerusalem its religious capital,
and seem justified in demanding rights over the temple mount. This matter
could, even now, be part of the negotiation process with the Arab world.
In Hebrew legend Asmodeus is a demon. He built King Solomon's
Temple and was a guardian of treasure and the secrets of God.
Allegorically he may be a version of the false prophet; or he may also be
the Antichrist/Lucifer/Wicked Priest. This gives us an entirely different
view of King Solomon.
Scripture and the ancient myths in general were specifically designed to
reach deep into the unconscious. There can be no doubt that many ancient
myths and fairy tales were spawned in this way. They go directly to the
right brain, where at an unconscious level they are self-explanatory to the
feminine.
Aramaic is said to be the language of the angels. It so happens



THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE HERESY 143
that it is written from right to left, which makes it a language of the left
handed. These right-brained people are a minority credited with special
insight and intellectual skill. Recent surveys show that, whereas they were
a real minority, they are now increasing. Yet at the same time they have
long since lived under a cloud.
In everyday language they are suspected unconsciously of being sinister.
The word sinister is from Latin and means 'left'. By implication, people
who are right-handed are also right and correct. The Russians speak of
pravda, the truth, and prava, the right-hand side. For the Poles it is exactly
the same. If language had any say in the matter, only right-handed people
would know righteousness. Not only in the English-speaking world, but
almost as a universal concept, people seem divided into those who are right
and those who are left over. Even communication is given to the right who
are 'writers'. But writing and the creation of cultural myths amount to what
is very much a right brain, feminine occupation.
In 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' the wicked stepmother poisons an
apple, the Adam's apple, and the princess is left to sleep a very long time.
Then comes our gallant prince, the Teacher, who awakens her with a kiss.
Jack's poor mother sends him to buy food and he returns with a packet of
seed, from which grows a great beanstalk in which there is a castle
occupied by a giant much like Gilgamesh's Huwawa. This story does seem
to echo that of Jesus' mustard seed which grows into a great tree.
Robin Hood, the green man, is yet another vegetative Jack in the
beanstalk who robs the rich to feed the poor, as likely as not with wisdom.
And what child does not know 'Mary had a little lamb'?
There are countless old fairy stories that begin 'Once upon a time', and
which carry large elements of this, the never-ending story. But modern
media, too, has been touched by these elements.
In Star Wars we again find our hero the Star/Teacher who in this instance
is called Luke Skywalker. He must go through his initiation and learn the
power of the Force. His greatest enemy is an exponent of its dark side who
proves ultimately to be Skywalker's father. He is his own darker self
(Jesus), whom Skywalker destroys in a great clash of Titans. And only he
can save the children of Israel from the cruel mechanistic empire which this
rag-tag remnant ultimately overcomes and destroys.
In Battlestar Galactica the story moves along a very similar vein. Here
we find the twelve tribes named as signs of the zodiac. The



144 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
story is basically the same, but in this instance the troops of the
wicked empire are referred to as 'tin cans', surely an allusion to
mechanistic society. But there is in this tale a very beautiful woman;
her crowning glory is her hair, which is long and copious. She has a
young child eager to become one of the heroes, and this little boy
seems to spend his time wandering through the film looking
vacantly into nowhere and repeating 'I wonder who my father is'. He
is of course the son of the widow spider Coma. It will be recalled
that the Teacher's father 'knew him not'. The implication is that, like
Jesus, his Father is in heaven.
Quite recently I found a children's book comprising a sequence of
stories. It is The Dark is Rising sequence by Susan Cooper.21 I have no
way of knowing if Susan is priestess to the rite or if she simply had
the right-brain door open in her dreams. This work is amazing in that
it contains such detail of otherwise hidden elements. And it is
beautifully told. It is a tale about six children who, with uncle
Merryman, a reincarnated Merlin, must fight to force back the
darkness. The story has a modern setting and revolves around a
poem. The children concerned must find the Grail and other items of
power. One of them is the Sign-seeker, who gathers together the six
circles quartered by the cross, the sign of the light which happens to
be the astrological symbol for Coma. But one child must go on alone.
He is the albino of Albion. This particular theme is both persistent
and puzzling.
We are told in the Scrolls that the people did not know that the
Teacher received his instruction directly from God. In the com
mentary on Habakkuk it is said:
[Behold the nations and see, marvel and be astonished; for I accomplish a
deed in your days, but you will not believe it when] told (1: 5).
[Interpreted, this concerns] those who were unfaithful together with the liar,
in that they [did] not [listen to the word received by] the Teacher of
Righteousness from the mouth of God. And it concerns the unfaithful of the
New [Covenant] in that they have not believed in the Covenant of God [and
have profaned] His holy Name. And likewise, this saying is to be interpreted
[as concerning those who] will be unfaithful at the end of days. They, the men
of violence and the breakers of the Covenant, will not believe when they hear
all that [is to happen to] the final generation from the Priest [in whose heart]
God set [understanding] that he might interpret all the words of His



THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE HERESY 145
servants the Prophets, through whom He foretold all that would
happen to His people and [His land].
It is said here that he (the Teacher) will interpret the words of the
biblical prophets, clearly implying that in the mean time the Bible is a
mystery. Until such time the Scriptures are sealed. It is also clear that, as
with Jesus, both he and his message will be rejected.
In the Hymns Scroll the Teacher is speaking (column 1):
These things I know
by the wisdom which comes from Thee, for Thou hast unstopped my
ears
to marvellous mysteries.
In the following verse we see Jesus the Teacher as an extraordinarily
ordinary man. He says:
And yet I, a shape of clay
kneaded in water, a ground of shame
and a source of pollution, a melting-pot of wickedness
and an edifice of sin, a straying and perverted spirit
of no understanding,
fearful of righteous judgements, what can I say that is not
foreknown,
and what can I utter that is not foretold?
At the end of column 1 he says:
[but the foo]lish of heart
shall not comprehend these things.
In this instance we may guess that 'knowing' or understanding after the
Teacher comes is a right- rather than left-brain operation. It is the
developed feminine in an age when the masculine was dominant, just as we
may say the fairytales I mentioned might easily and simply have been a
right-brain product from the well of knowing.
Historically speaking, this material was just as accessible to the men of
the Church as it was to the mystics they persecuted. How



146 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
an individual reacted to it depended entirely upon whether he was
predominantly right-brained or balanced. The Church, throughout its
history, has attracted many clever and cunning people. There must have
come a point at which Rome became fully aware that her edifice was on
very shaky ground. But not only Rome: this epic involves Jewry as well. If
they were and are capable of producing the titans who have quite
disproportionately contributed to man's store in the arts and sciences, I
doubt they would have overlooked the central theme of their existence, the
Torah.
Taking the Bible as history, Adam and Eve were progenitors of the entire
human race. But they were not alone: in related legends so were, among
many others, Deucalion and Pyra. They populated the world after the flood
by casting the bones of their mother over their shoulders, as instructed by
the oracle. Their mother was the earth, and her bones are stones, as they
subsequently discovered. And so it was that they too ate the fruit of the
tree.
No indication is given as to the geographic location of the Garden of
Eden. Most likely, as John Allegro points out, from its root GAN
NARIMAN, we may guess that it is 'the canopy of the stars'.
Chapter 5 of Genesis lists the generations of Adam from Seth, of whom
Scripture tells us very little, but who has come down to us as an initiate in
the magic arts. Verse 3 reads:
...and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image: and called his
name Seth:
He declared his son Enos prince and high priest of mankind. In the
Scrolls he is subsequently killed by the Sons of Light. But there is so little
to go on.
This cycle reaches its conclusion in Noah. Genesis 5: 29 reads:
...This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our
hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.
My interpretation of this verse is that the ground which is cursed is the
earth in Pisces; the flood is global. The work of their hands comprises the
mysteries hidden in Scripture. And the comforter is the Teacher.
Noah is then credited with three sons, of whom two are Shem and Ham,
the Shemhamphorai.
After the Noacian flood the cycle starts all over again. In Genesis



THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE HERESY 147
9: 19 it is clear that the whole earth is seeded by Noah's sons; these are
obviously spiritual seed. Ham is the progenitor of Canaan, who is cursed by
Noah. The generations of the Ashkenazi, the predominant group of Jews
presently occupying Israel, are Noah, Japheth, Gomer and Ashkenaz.
If our tribe or social group had recently converted to Judaism or
Christianity for whatever reason, we might likely choose ourselves a
propitious biblical ancestor from whom we might claim descendance. We
would not choose the line Noah/Ham/Canaan, because it is cursed.
However, if I am correct, the inhabitants of Israel, the state when Israel the
nation is formed, are the Canaanites, who are the people we know as
modern Jewry.
The most prominent of the patriarchs are Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
none of whom were Jews; nor were they Israelites. God changed Jacob's
name to Israel in Genesis 32: 28. Neither was Moses or David a Jew. This
name is first found in II Kings 16: 6-7, where the Jews are at war with
Israel.
The word 'Hebrew' makes its first appearance in Genesis 14:13, where it
is a patronymic of Abraham and his seed. Later, and significantly, we learn
in Genesis 40: 15 that Joseph (the sun) was stolen out of the land of the
Hebrews. The answer must lie with Abraham, who is earlier called Abram.
In Genesis 15:7 God brought Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees. The
Babylonians and Chaldeans are established in Scripture as magi and
astronomer priests. The name 'Ur' means 'brightness' or 'light'. In biblical
allusion the Hebrews are one and the same as the people of Ur, the Sons of
Light, and Joseph the sun in the tree is stolen from among them. It then
becomes safe to say that all Abraham's seed are Hebrews, or Sons of Light,
who in the Last Days do battle with the Sons of Darkness. That is to say
that, mythically speaking, those with the sun in the tree will do battle with
those with no enlightenment.
Anyone attempting to find Israel's racial origins in the Bible is a fool, not
only because of what has been found here, but because of the impossibility
of ethnic purity as such. I speak not of the larger and predominant
groupings but of a world two to four thousand years ago when the smaller
tribes were rapidly absorbed.
In I Kings 11 the prophet rends a coat in twelve pieces to signify the
division of Israel because of Solomon's promiscuity. But it seems that yet
again someone is having trouble with his arithmetic. As we shall see in due
course, the possibility of any



148 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
scribal error in Scripture is absolutely out of the question. Verses 35-36 read:
But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee,
even ten tribes.
And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a
light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put
my name there.
Note that, though Solomon in his old age is the cause, the tribes are
divided during his son's reign. That is to say, the myth cycle is completed,
and so with Solomon's son we go back to the beginning, where we have
only twelve stars upon the tree, not thirteen. It will be recalled that this
really means eleven, not twelve, signs because Libra is Levi, which is the
priesthood of the earth and does not have tribal status. But then that means
the tree is not of eleven sephiroth but ten, because the stone of Joseph the
sun is taken away. And the light of the Jerusalem tree is this Joseph the
sun.
In this story Jeroboam does exactly as happened with Jesus the Sceptre
when Herod sought to kill him. He flees into Egypt till Solomon is dead.
Put another way, the felling of the tree and bringing down of whichever
mythical king is reigning at the time can be said to be a stoning to death. I
doubt very much if actual stoning ever occurred; its purpose in Scripture is
to describe the stoning to death of the tree.
In modern parlance, when someone is heavily affected by drugs or
alcohol we say he or she is 'stoned', not properly conscious. If they are too
far gone, they are in a 'coma'.
Historically speaking this chapter is taken to be the point at which ten
tribes are lost to Israel. All that remain are Judah, Benjamin and the
Levites. No number is given beyond telling us that they have a hundred and
eighty thousand fighting men (I Kings 12: 21).
Most significant in this tale is that Jeroboam and his remnant built the
city of Shechem on Mount Ephraim, which, as we know, is Coma.
But historically we now have the northern and southern kingdoms of two
peoples constantly at war with each other.
In II Kings 17: 6 Israel is lost altogether, being carried off into Syria, out
of the sight of the Lord. Judah is actually deported in chapter 18.



THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE HERESY 149
Again, historically speaking, around 445 BCE, in the days of Nehemiah,
the number of Israelites returning (Nehemiah 7) is forty-two thousand. This
was the Babylonian captivity, which I say is no different to an Egyptian
one in that it is purely allegorical, these being the times of the Gentiles
(Luke 21: 24).
In Esther 8: 17 it is said that there were many Persians who became Jews
for fear of the God of Israel. This greatly augments our spiritual people,
made up of all nations. But historically and ethnically speaking, not even
taking into account intermarriage during the captivity, our Jews have now
been watered down. Esther means the planet Venus, the goddess of love,
ruler over the bull of Taurus, and another form of Coma. Jacob gave this
inheritance to Joseph's younger son, not the elder Taurus as their father had
expected. In other words it is the Sceptre, not the Star, that is to inherit.
This matter of tribal corruption was made worse when the Hasmonians
conquered the Edomites, descendants of Esau. But the conquest seems to
have been the other way around, for the Edomites prospered and eventually
there sprang from them the Herodian dynasty. They also dominated the all
important priesthood, for the Pharisees were largely of this tribe. It is this
mythical Edom that is one of the major forces of the Sons of Darkness
mentioned in the War Scroll. This makes nonsense of the idea that the
historical Qumran community — the Essenes — were of Pharisaic origin.
In chapter 7 of John's gospel there is a surprising statement which tells us
Jesus is vulnerable and without divine protection:
After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry,
because the Jews sought to kill him.
This separates the Benjamites (Galileans) from the Jews. It will be
recalled that Benjamin is Gemini. These mysterious tribes so far are
Taurus, Coma and Gemini, all of which sit together at the west side of the
Temple.
In I Kings 11 the torn coat is in fact rent in eleven pieces. As mentioned
above, Judah/Leo is left to Israel and one piece is missing. Later the tribe of
Benjamin is thrown in as Israel to make up the number. If we add to this the
mass conversion of the Persians (Esther 8:17), an ethnic Israel is really
quite unacceptable.
In John 8: 33 the Pharisees are Abraham's seed. In verse 37, in complete
and utter contradiction — historically speaking — Jesus



150 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
acknowledges them as such. And so it is that in the prophetic sense the
Jews of today are at one stage Canaanites, and later Pharisees in the
Teacher's time. They are Abraham's bastard sons.
In Scripture sheep are Israel. In John 10: 26 Jesus tells them they are not
of his sheep.
In Matthew 23: 29 he says:
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build
the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous.
Historically speaking we now find ourselves at the time of the diaspora.
If the record can be trusted, in excess of one million died in Palestine in 70
CE.
Modern Jewry has no ancestral claim to the land of Israel. But this is
obviously unconscionable because otherwise any man of any race who
proves himself a spiritual child of Abraham might enter the country and
call it his home.
It is well known that, as a tool of prophecy, the Bible uses the tribes and
sub-tribes to define the various peoples of the world in the latter days.
Much more important is that the Old Testament is not historical, but
prophetic of the painful birth of a future Israel — one that 'will be' and
never was. This point cannot be overemphasized. What we have believed to
be an ancient nation in the Old Testament is actually a prognostication of
future events. None of it has actually happened. The Bible is, as I have said,
a vastly expanded version of the prophecies of Nostradamus.
Because of the vast sum of material which points to Britain having a
major involvement in the biblical scheme of things, Robert Graves felt
himself constrained, in The White Goddess, to confirm that he was not a
British Israelite. British Israel is yet another revivalist Christian sect, which
believes that Ephraim/Coma is the lost tribe now manifest as the Celto
Saxon people. It does not require much imagination to see how quickly this
kind of thing can lead to dangerous political movements based on a sort of
Christo-fascism.
In the mind of the British Israelite, he finds among the blonde and blue
eyed Europeans biblical tribal names which for him constitute evidence that
the lost tribes founded those states. Jutland becomes Judah-land, Denmark
is Dan-mark. The Hebrides become Hebrew settlements, and Spain (Iberia)
becomes the land of the Ibris (Hebrews). Zarah apparently came through
the Straits of



THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE HERESY 151
Gibraltar to Ireland and the Shelahites (youngest son of Judah by Shua, a
Canaanite) to Britain. The English, or Angles, become Angels, and so it
goes on ad nauseam. Interestingly enough, as will be demonstrated, they
have strong non-biblical evidence to support their case, not the least of
which, as has often been remarked, is the very great similarity between the
ancient Celtic and Old Testament languages. This can now be easily
explained in that the Hebrew and Aramaic of the Old Testament and early
Celtic have preserved much of the prehistoric speech of the magi.
In the ancient world, there existed a universal sacred language, used only
by the priests. A completely separate profane written one was maintained
for civil use. At the beginning of our age, when the tree was hewn down,
there came a confusion of tongues.
According to British Israel, the Union Jack is the banner of the tribes of
the union of Jacob, of which Jack is an abbreviation. Interestingly enough,
according to me and not them, upon this flag the cross of St Andrew is
broken, and thus it can be opened into a very good approximation of the
diagram of the tree.
But notwithstanding, it may also be said that the Aboriginal flag of
Australia — half black, half red with a solar disc in the centre — can also
be said to symbolize the sun rising upon the mystic tree with its branches in
space = black, and its roots in the country's red desert soil. All this proves
nothing beyond showing the prominence of this tree in the unconscious.
Historically speaking, Jesus said there would not one stone of the
Temple remain standing upon another. If Matthew 24: 2 is to be read as
history, then Jesus was wrong, for even today there remains the wailing
wall, which coincidentally is the west wall. True surviving Israel comprises
Benjamin and Ephraim, who are part of one side of the tree, as are Gemini
and Coma. There are no ethnic groups; it is all myth, in which ancient Israel
is the stars, depicting the birth of a nation in the future.
Beneath the British throne there once sat the Stone of Scone, which
British Israel claims is the stone of David. The rock of their foundation is
the prophecy in Genesis 48: 19, where Ephraim is to become a company of
nations, which according to them are the countries of the English-speaking
peoples. Manasseh/Taurus also figures in this scheme; our west wall is the
surviving stones in the tree. Spiritual Israel is the company of nations.
Notwithstanding all this, there is an element to British Israel which is
almost uncanny.



152 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Mythically speaking Jesus is absolutely correct if we apply his statement
about the destruction of the Temple to the tree.
In this tribal scheme Ephraim and Manasseh represent Britain and the
United States respectively. It is only fair to say that there are, I believe,
some fifteen hundred different Christian sects, all of which quite rightly
interpret Scripture according to the individual straw they have happened to
grasp. They cannot be blamed for innocent and honest misunderstanding.
But one wonders how much they have intentionally been misled.
British Israel points to the name 'British'. In Hebrew, brith-ish means
'covenant man'. There is, as we have seen, only one covenant man and he is
the Teacher. Should we presume that he is to spring up in Britain? After all,
the peculiar people Israel comprises all the nations of the earth.
Jacob is the younger twin of Esau (sons of Isaac). They are not the twins
who so often pop up in mythology. At the end of Genesis 25 Jacob, the
younger brother, cheats a hungry Esau of his birthright for a proverbial
mess of pottage. This theme of usurped birthright is common: we see it
again in the story of King Arthur.
In Genesis 26: 4 Isaac's seed is to multiply as the stars of heaven, which
is exactly what happens when Jacob blesses his sons in Genesis 49. He is
therefore the supplanter.
Rebekah is Isaac's wife and mother to these boys. In chapters 26 and 27
there is a brief charade. First Isaac pretends to the Philistines that his wife is
his sister; then at his death-bed she plots to have the inheritance go to her
chosen son, Jacob. In this fashion we see she is the Triple-Headed Goddess
who is manifest as Rachael/ Arachne, the wife, sister and mother.
There then follows some very provincial Victorian melodrama in which
Rebekah and Jacob plot to deceive Isaac in giving his blessing of
inheritance. It seems Esau, the logical inheritor, is a very 'hairy' man; thus
Jacob dons kid's skins to imitate his brother, Isaac being blind. But he fears
a curse, not a blessing, might come upon him. And the key is in 27:13,
where Rebekah says:
...Upon me be thy curse, my son...
There is then a display of outright lies and trickery, by which Esau is
cheated and the Spider Goddess has her way.
In chapter 36 of Genesis we find that Esau is Edom, the Edomites. We
also learn that he took his wives of the daughters of Canaan.



THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE HERESY 153
The Canaanites and Edomites, as I have said, are modern Israel. It is
believed that Jesus the Saviour was a Jew. Scripturally speaking he is not,
and this is itself an important part of his myth. But! Jacob stole the
inheritance, the Messianic expectation: the tree. My interpretation is that
the hairy Esau is primitive mankind, which is to be replaced by a more
highly evolved creature.
I have said that Israel is not an ethnic group, but an evolved humanity
from every race on earth. This begs an important question. Inasmuch as
there is to be a New Jerusalem, there must have been an old one. We know
this to have been the case. But let me be specific. I do not refer only to the
land from which the Bible arose, but to the Israel which must be the mirror
image of the new. If the new is to be called out of all nations, then so was
the old. It is, after all, to be 'reinstated'.
Daniel brings his book to a rather strange and mysterious conclusion.
Chapter 12, verse 7 reads:
And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of
the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto
heaven, and sware by him that liveth forever that it shall be for a time,
times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the
power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.
The important point here is the accomplishment of the scattering of the
power of the holy people. This was not achieved in 70 CE when the
Jerusalem Temple was destroyed; it only began then.
For example, until Europeans arrived in the Pacific, those people were
still governed by their shamans, the holy people. Even up to the time of the
expansion of China into Tibet, there still remained, in increasing isolation,
groups governed by their priesthood.
This new elect, Israel, is the shamans and magi. Jacob then is an
unspecified nation which cheats Esau of his inheritance. This I take to mean
that the source from which we were led to believe man's messianic
expectations might be fulfilled (the traditional Jews) is a false trail. And this
because Israel the chosen people is not a race as such. Hence our Star and
Sceptre, which come out of Judah and Jacob/Israel respectively, could be
sourced anywhere among whoever Judah (the Lion) and Jacob/Israel
represent.
The land of Judea is but a tiny dot, and a very inhospitable one on our
planet. Yet more human blood has been shed for that soil than for any place
on earth. The false arguments based on Scripture



154 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
are quite easily demolished with a little objectivity. I question whether the
Church or Jewry lacks that objectivity. If so, why are both the Vatican and
the Israeli Government implicated in the Dead Sea Scrolls scandal? And if
so, why, even today, are men, women and children suffering and dying
because of beliefs that are known to be false?
The institutionalizing of scholarship, as with religion, has led to the
establishment of barriers to real understanding, beyond which access is
strictly forbidden. In this sense, state education is no different to state
religion: it is just another leg of the sacred cow. We are not educated for
our benefit, but for the state's purpose. Contrary to what we are led to
believe, our actual understanding of history is rather limited. Seeing it
through only one gender literally means we see it in a cyclopean fashion.
The shameful and pathetic nakedness of the king is, in itself, of little
consequence. Shouts from the ivory towers of academia that the king is so
handsomely dressed are sufficient to bring bitter tears to the eyes. In such a
case, one can understand and sympathize with arguments that suggest the
continued intrusion of extra-terrestrials in human affairs. This is a Bandaid
argument, but it demonstrates the patient is in need of attention.
Christianity was not alone in trying to win hearts and souls in Rome: it
was one of many with similar beliefs at the time. In fact it came close to
being bettered by the very popular cult of Mithras, which was very similar
in its teachings. Mithras was the corn (wisdom) god who sacrificed the
harvest festival bull. It will be recalled that I have argued that the Teacher is
born in Taurus. This bull's tail terminated in three corn (wisdom) stalks,
which may symbolize either the three pillars of the tree or the three
messiahs. The origin of the name Mithras is almost certainly the Assyrian
'metru', meaning rain; this is obviously the word of God falling from
heaven in the form of a revelation. In this tradition the Teacher was born
from a stone, which is my argument exactly. The long-term disadvantages
of the Mithras cult were that it was overtly gnostic and made no pretensions
to historicity, as did Christianity. In our kind of age it would not have gone
the distance. Not only was Christianity's winning the day miraculous,
Mithraism actually prepared and smoothed its path.
Much later, the actual survival of Christianity against the onslaught of
Islam — shortly after the death of the prophet — suggests an organization
of human agencies on a cosmic scale. Roman



THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE HERESY 155
Christianity was, from birth, a very sickly child that survived against all
odds.
While Charles Martel and the Franks were battling Islam in Europe (see
Appendix IV), but for the Khazars (the ancestors and progenitors of
modern Jewry), who were strategically stationed along the Caucasus
mountains, St Peter's Church in Rome might well have become the site of a
mosque. It is almost as though we have chosen to ignore the most
important elements in the history of the last two thousand years.
Plate 2. Approximate extent of Khazaria.
One of these major elements, of which we know virtually nothing, is the
empire of Khazaria, which stretched from the Caucasus mountains to the
Volga. From circa 635 CE the Khazars were engaged in a war with Islam
which lasted over a hundred years. They alone prevented the invaders from
crossing this mountain range and entering Europe. Byzantium
acknowledged its indebtedness to them for its survival.
'Khazar' is probably nomenclative, describing a vast collection of diverse
tribes. Curiously, the Caucasus region is the supposed cradle of the Aryan
peoples. As Koestler points out,22 this makes anti-Semitism void; it proves
to be the cruelest joke that history



156 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
ever played. This federation consisted mainly of Magyars, Bulgars and
Turkic tribes in general. The term 'Turkic' basically means hill people. The
English 'tor' means hill, and this seems to be related to Taurus. Abraham is
derived from 'father of height'.
The conversion of the Khazars to Judaism happened circa 740 CE. The
empire was at its height between the seventh and tenth centuries. Modern
Jewish scholarship acknowledges that these people have contributed to the
composition of latter-day Jewry.
As they comprised a nation of highly successful and wealthy merchants,
Rome, Byzantium and Islam all sought to win them over to their faith.
However siding with one of these groups would have put them at war with
the others. With the cunning for which they were famed, their chieftain
asked the representative of each of these three faiths about the origin and
foundation of their separate beliefs. When they all in turn said it was the
Law of Moses and the religion of the Jews, the chieftain announced that he
and his people would convert to that faith, and they did.
Later, Khazaria was invaded by the Russian tribes to the north and the
people were scattered. As 'the Jews', their origins having long since been
forgotten, they drifted into Russia and later into Europe.
Thus it was from some smart politicking that the modern Jews sprang. It
is from this same little piece of politicking that circumstances have
developed to the point that we await a third world war generated by events
in the Middle East, and will eventually not be disappointed.
On page 26 of The Thirteenth Tribe, Koestler concurs that the Khazars
were not one specific grouping but an ethnic mosaic. The real Khazars were
likely a monarchy, similar to an Essene or Templar group of warrior
monks. They governed and directed affairs, themselves probably drawn
from an admix of ethnic groups. The Judaic doctrine they inherited and left
behind may have been an intentional shaping of history.
In the eighth century, there emerged in neighbouring Persia a
fundamentalist Jewish sect called the Karaites (Hebrew quaraim = readers,
or students of the Law). In keeping with the events that we are uncovering,
it is possible that this may prove to be yet another instance in which the
people have inherited from their absent masters a set of doctrines they did
not fully understand. It is plausible that the warrior knight masters of the
Khazars might have been a Templar-type Karaite priesthood who
eventually could hold on no longer. When the empire finally collapsed, a
nation of converts to



THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE HERESY 157
Judaism was scattered abroad. As the priests (holy people) were scattered, the
general populace throughout the globe established diverse religions in the shadow of
wisdom inherited from their former masters. But the evidence presented so far is not
all there is to hand. There are many other sources. Accordingly, we shall see that
God was arranging the chess pieces we call history, and that the outcome of these
moves is now both inevitable and imminent.
Conclusion
I began by pointing out that there is definite evidence that the committee responsible
for the Scrolls dragged their feet. I went on to say that the efforts of John Allegro
a member of the team — to bring matters out into the public arena led to his being
hounded by his colleagues. Both Israel and the Christian world have obvious
motives for this secrecy, for the Bible clearly points to a false Israel and false
Christianity. In this connection I showed that Ishmael is modern Jewry, the bastard
son of Abraham.
We have now been introduced to the Liar and the Wicked Priest, the two other
characters depicted in the Scrolls. These, I have begun to show, have their place in
Scripture. We later saw that the names 'Israel' and 'Jews' appear quite late in the Old
Testament and, when they do, Israel is at war with the Jews. This led to a review of
biblical stories that make a distinction between a true and a false Israel. I concluded
by observing that the Khazars — the ancestors of the traditional Jews — may have
learned their Judaism from their neighbours the Karaites.
Taking the notion that the twelve tribes are an allegory for the zodiac and that
Israel is not ethnic, the following may reasonably be concluded in respect of a future
Israel:
The twelve tribes are twelve divisions of mankind's ethnic makeup. Initially they
form a state that will act as a theocratic centre of government; eventually it will
govern the entire globe. At its own centre will be the Levites, who in turn are made
up of all nations. These separate tribes (ethnic groups) will never interbreed, as
evidenced by Scripture. Ultimately this new humanity will increase and the Gentiles
(existing mankind) will disappear, at which point the entire population of the world
will be made up of 'Israel'. All this has its foundation in the Teacher's revelation,
which is itself a means of selecting, or 'calling out' this new humanity. The role of
the Antichrist and False Prophet is to weed out the weaklings. And all this is itself
the result of catastrophic evolution. My proposal is that the entire Bible is devoted
to both aiding and prophesying these events.

Nemesis
Within most human hearts there is that spark which ultimately desires to
see the victory of good over evil. We have all at some time in our lives
been moved to envision that final day when, with swords blazing, we are
part of that ultimate victory in which injustice is vanquished and chaos no
longer reigns. This is itself the stuff that drives men to the Grail Quest. That
he might become that brave knight who defends the young maiden's
honour, a staff for the poor to lean upon, one whose presence sets fear in
the hearts of those who would do wrong, and one who, with humility,
bends the knee and bows low with reverence before the Lady — this is the
eternal dream of the poet.
The Qumran War Scroll is poignantly evocative of the light within us
which pleads the coming of that great day, but we should not forget that we
ourselves are also that dark horde — the sons of chaos and servitors of the
Evil One. That great battle must thus first be fought within, and the moment
of engagement to war is now. Column 1 section 2 of the War Scroll reads:
Justice shall go forth unto the ends of the world, ever increasing until all the
appointed times of the dominion of Darkness are completed. At the time
appointed by God, His lofty majesty shall shine forth through all appointed
times for peace and blessing, joy, and long life for all Sons of Light. Upon that
day when the Kittim are vanquished there shall be mighty carnage before the
God of Israel, for that is the day appointed by Him from the beginning for a
war of annihilation of the Sons of Darkness, in which there shall engage in
great carnage the congregation of angels and an assembly of men, the Sons of
Light and the Sons of Darkness, fighting each with the might of God amidst
the sound of great tumult and the war cry of angels and men for a day of
destruction.
It goes on to say in column 2:
During the remaining thirty-three years of the war the men of renown who
are called to assembly and all the chiefs of the families of the congregation
shall from time to time choose for them warriors for the lands of the gentiles.



NEMESIS 159
Long before the writing of this scroll, Zoroaster had taught, in the sixth
century BCE, that the Lord of Light, Ahura Mazda, was now locked in battle
with Ahriman the Lord of the Dark. When the Light withdrew from the
world, particles remained trapped in qelippot, the evil that binds in matter.
Tiqqun (the restoration) would only be achieved when a chosen few among
men sought aid from the Most High, who would bring about the end of all
evil. It is now clear that the Persian monotheism of Zoroaster predates that
of the Hebrews. Furthermore, the writings of the Essenes clearly
demonstrate a direct line of descent from Persia to Palestine. This then
shows us the enormous value of Professor Thomas Thompson's finding that
Israel was created by Persia. We begin now to see a unity in this new
history and may intelligently guess that the first priests of Palestine were
Zoroastrian magi.
It is well established that the authors of the War Scroll had a very
considerable knowledge and understanding of warfare and its intricate
strategies. Nevertheless the scroll stretches credibility by presuming that
the words written upon the various battle weapons themselves increase the
power of the weaponry. In column 3 we read:
Upon the trumpets of the expeditions shall they write 'God's mighty
deeds for scattering the enemy and for putting to flight all the enemies
of justice, and humiliating retribution upon all opponents of God'; upon
the trumpets of the battle arrays shall they write 'Arrays of God's
battalions for His angry vengeance upon all the Sons of Darkness'...
It continues:
Upon the trumpets of the ambush shall they write 'Mysteries of God
for the destruction of wickedness'...
In section 5 these magical words become the names of the tribes and
their epithets, and are organized around the cosmic temple. Column 4,
section 6 begins:
And when they enter into battle they shall write on their banners
'Truth of God', 'Justice of God', 'Glory of God', 'Judgement of God',
and following this all of their names in full.



160 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Section 7 then goes on to specify the length of each of the banners. But,
literally speaking, this product of poetic genius is farcical and not to be
taken seriously.
The last line of column V tells us that the first two skirmishing battalions
are to go forth with slingshots, obviously opening the battle by casting
stones. This may be equated with the Teacher casting the two stones (Sun
and Coma) in the cosmic tree. No doubt his battle-cry will be 'Mysteries of
God for the destruction of wickedness'.
It is clear and unequivocal that no-one in his 'right mind' would presume
that this is an actual description of the final battle. Each of the statements to
be written upon the trumpets, banners and weapons is a cabalistic cipher,
and the whole document is concerned with the building of the cosmic
temple/tree which is a door to the fourth dimension and from whence will
come the forces (angels) who will select and destroy those beings who have
failed to evolve. The document itself begins by stating when these events
must occur:
[For the Master. The book of the disposition of] the war. The first
encounter of the Sons of Light will be to attack the lot of the Sons of
Darkness, the army of Satan, the forces of Edom and Moab, the sons
of Ammon and the army [of] Philistia and the troops of the Kittim of
Asshur, and the offenders against the covenant who are in league with
them. The sons of Levi, the sons of Judah, the sons of Benjamin and the
exiles of the wilderness shall fight against them with [valour], against
all their armies, when the exiles of the Sons of Light come back from
the Wilderness of the Nations to make camp in the Wilderness of
Jerusalem.
Biblically speaking, the Sons of Light are the sons of Jacob, and it will
be recalled that chapter 49 of Genesis sets them in the Last Days. The Sons
of Darkness are Esau/Edom. As previously mentioned, this story echoes a
common theme in myth, in which there is a stolen birthright, or a false trail
in which light and dark appear in opposite roles, or the true Israel turns out
to be other than what was believed. If the whole thing is some kind of
intelligence test, it would be ludicrous to presume that the distinction
between light and dark would be obvious.
It will be recalled that Benjamin (Gemini) sits to the right of the
thirteenth stone on the tree. This tribe was the smallest of all, and it



NEMESIS 161
occupied northern Israel, while Judah (Leo) occupied the south after the
other tribes were lost. Jerusalem was originally in the territory of Benjamin,
but it was later ceded to Judah. Galilee was the name given to the territory
of the Benjamites in later times. Accordingly, since they were Galileans the
disciples, and Jesus too, were Benjamites, the only exception being Judas,
who was a Judean. That is to say, it is Judah (the Jews) who rejects Jesus
the Teacher. In Acts 2 it is these same Benjamites who illumine the
Scriptures and translate them into many languages. Accordingly this tribe is
'the light-bearer' or 'a light unto the house of Judah'. Thus, Jesus is also a
light unto the Gentiles.
It may appear a contradiction, but Paul, who I shall show is the Liar
(false prophet) in the Dead Sea Scrolls, was also a Benjamite. He was,
however, only so by parentage: Paul was a Roman citizen born at Tarsus,
the son of a Pharisee who learned the trade of tent-maker. It will be recalled
that the Pharisees are false Jews. It so happens that the Khazars were
tentmakers. They subsequently became prominent in the clothing trade in
Europe.
The tribe that is to be a perpetual light for David is in fact Benjamin, the
Galileans. During the time that it was attached to Judah they were lumped
in as Jews, but they never were. The name 'Jew' has become synonymous
with 'Israelite', but in fact only the Judeans were so designated; the others
were Israelites. In Romans 9: 6 we are told: 'Not as though the word of God
hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel.'
Later the Benjamites go into Asia Minor, leaving the Judeans (Jews) in
possession of the promised land, and, later still, they too are scattered — by
Rome. If we have the wit to see this as prophecy, we have here an amazing
insight into the future. For example, five years after the destruction of
Solomon's (the Wicked Priest's) Temple, the remnant of Judah and
Benjamin go into captivity in Babylon. Without a doubt, Scripture points to
Benjamin as the final and ultimate Israel, which we may see is the final and
completely evolved new humanity after a number of stumbling steps taken
by the Teacher. Accordingly, in Genesis 49: 27 Benjamin is to 'ravin as a
wolf who is to 'devour the prey' and 'divide the spoil'. In short, he will
exterminate inferior humanity.
As we are seeing, the Bible was not so much written as built. Beginning
with its surface text as a basement we find (if the image is not too
contradictory) the levels beneath rising high into the air like a great
skyscraper. It is exactly the same with the War Scroll,



162 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
which, as many have noted, has themes, borrowings and common language
with Daniel and Revelation.
Scholarship originally set the composition of this document at around
200 BCE, the purpose being to distance these writings from the New
Testament. But this would have had the text predate Daniel (circa 160
BCE), from which it borrows quite heavily. Even if it were set 200 years
later, we would still need to ask how the authors knew that Israel would be
dispersed in 70 CE and then, in the end times, return. This question is a very
obvious and important one, yet to my knowledge it has never been asked.
The statement in the scroll must be much more than an inspired guess. The
answer can only be that the authors passed through Sirius, the door to the
fourth dimension, Coma's womb. We need also to question whether they
were writing about a political state that exists today or a poetic concept of
an Israel within us all which will be manifest in the future. Certainly, the
setting of the Qumran writings in the intertestamental and early Christian
period has denied their authors a quite amazing prophetic skill. Thus the
question must be asked again: was there ever a nation state called Israel?
Taking both the evidence provided by Professor Thompson and that
given here, it is now possible to form an hypothesis as to the origins of
ancient Israel and the Bible. Once the magi moved into Judea and took
control of the territory, they would have had to create a very sizable
population quite rapidly. No doubt trade opportunities and the opening of
new lands would have helped, and, quite probably, given a period of some
two hundred years in which population and cohesion could take place, this
should not have presented too great a problem. Economically speaking, the
area of ancient Palestine was of fast-growing importance. What we need to
see is that the magi of the Holy Land and the surrounding countries were
agreed in their long-term goal. The creation of the Old Testament would
have been a major contributing factor in unifying this original rag-bag of
migrants. With the magi at the helm, and their promulgation of a
monotheistic faith in an apparently pantheistic world, this would have
quickly created a nation subservient to the priests. These people would
eventually believe themselves to be the chosen of God. We should also
remember that there existed then, as there still does today, the idea that the
letters of the Hebrew alphabet are sacred. In keeping with my argument that
settlement began after the period of the supposed Babylonian captivity, it is
not until this time that the present square characters



NEMESIS 163
of Hebrew began to emerge. Talmudic and ancient cabalistic tradition says
that they were the actual means by which God brought about the creation.
In this kind of situation the population would have actively avoided
learning, to which they probably had no access anyway; subsequently the
priests created the historical record, which no doubt was well in place by
the time the Romans arrived. If all this is so, the ancient state was created
specifically for its destruction.
As a hypothetical figure, I would suggest that the Old Testament began
to take shape some little time before 200 BCE. At this point, I postulate, the
magi began preaching this gospel to the inhabitants of Palestine, as they
were themselves developing and producing these books. The conversion to
Judaism of the original migrants and their coalescence into a state and later
a memory called Israel would have been no more difficult than, and little
different from, the conversion of the Khazars.
The Temple which Titus destroyed in 70 CE was demolished, quite
probably, only shortly after it had been finished. Let us remember that this
was the first Temple on that site and that the Herodians had still been in the
process of building it a few years before Titus came along. Herod began its
reconstruction and expansion in 20 BCE, and the work continued for about
eighteen months. Minor construction and alteration went on until close to
the time of its destruction. The building was partially restored by Bar
Cocheba in 132 CE, but was levelled three years later by Hadrian, who
replaced it with a temple to Jupiter Capitallnus. In 689 CE the site became
the third holiest shrine of Islam. The threshing floor is at present within the
Haram esh-Sherif, the sacred enclosure of the Dome of the Rock, which is
called Kubbet es-Sakhra.
The original Temple would have been destroyed solely to neutralize the
power of the priests, whom the Romans also attacked at Qumran and
Masada, which were Essene strongholds. In Antiquities 15,10,5 Josephus
tells us that Herod honoured the Essenes, who were given special
privileges. This was apparently because Manahem the Essene had
prophesied his kingship when he was a boy. Fulfilling such prophecy is
easy when, like the Druid, you have the power of king-maker. Furthermore,
outside the Bible the land was never called 'Israel'. The Romans knew it as
Palestine and Judea, and to this day it has retained that name. 'Israel' has
always been more of a spiritual concept than a country. If it had



164 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
been called Israel, surely Rome would have known it as such. It does not
require the removal of many bricks to demolish a badly constructed wall.
But there is something here which the poet knows and which can easily be
missed. History is aware of itself; it is capable of casting reflections and
appearing to repeat and fulfil itself. Time is an illusion; its pages lie
together, side by side. Ask yourself what is the primary task of the
illusionist? It is to help you create the reality that you desire. But whence
comes desire? Exodus 15:13-15 reads:
Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
habitation.
The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the
inhabitants of Palestina.
Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,
trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan
shall melt away.
These verses are an echo of the War Scroll and, as a Last Days scenario,
imply that there is no Israel as yet. Later in this chapter, in verse 23, Moses
leads the people to the waters of Marah ('bitter'), and Mariam, it will be
recalled, is also the sea. These are the bitter words of God which the people
in Pisces cannot drink. Verse 25 reads:
And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree,
which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet...
Time and again we find that beneath the ludicrous superficial miracle
there lies the poetic and more believable truth. Here, for instance, Moses as
the Revealer of Mysteries shows the people the cosmic tree, which
sweetens the words of God and gives new meaning to Scripture, which, till
then, they have found untenable.
In Exodus 17 the people are again thirsty and clamouring for the words
of God. This explains Moses' statement in verse 4, where he says '...they be
almost ready to stone me'. Verse 6 reads:
Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and
thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it,



NEMESIS 165
that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders
of Israel.
In Exodus 4 his rod has magical powers of its own. When cast to the
ground it becomes a serpent; this sits entwined at the root of the cosmic
tree. Mythologically, it is the guardian of the thirteenth stone. In chapter 7
the rod is cast down before Pharaoh and again becomes a serpent; the
Teacher makes his revelation before the allegorical Egyptians. This time it
is cast down by Aaron, whose name means 'illumined'. He is an older
brother of Moses, and thus is another mythological symbol of the sun in the
tree. In Numbers 17: 8 his rod blossoms while in the tabernacle, and
becomes an almond tree. The Aaronic priests are the celebrants of the
temple of the sun, the Levites. Moses complained to God that he was not
clever of speech; thus God gave him Aaron (Exodus 4: 10-16). It is the
raising of the sun in the tree that makes Moses the Teacher eloquent; it is
the source of his revelation. In Exodus 4: 27 Aaron and Moses meet at the
mountain of God (the tree) after another — allegorical — forty years of
separation. It was Aaron (the sun in the tree) who persuaded the people to
accept Moses as their leader. Aaron died and was buried on Mount Hor and
the people mourned him for thirty days, which must be an allegory for a
Great Month. Later, in Exodus 17, Joshua must fight against Amalek.
Moses is seated upon a stone, and each time he holds up his hands Joshua's
men are successful in battle. The hands symbolize the hand of God which,
it will be recalled, is the letter 'yod', which in turn is a flame representing
the sun rising in the tree. And, as if to clarify and confirm these matters, the
Teacher in the role of David speaks of these things in I Chronicles 28: 19:
All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his
hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.
As we have seen, the entire Bible is a series of interlocking myths with
only a few major characters. It also harmonizes with the legends of the
magi of the entire ancient world; it is therefore quite legitimate to look for
clues in otherwise unrelated traditions.
A parallel to the story of the rightful heir to the kingdom is found in the
Arthurian material. This also clarifies the matter of the Liar and the Wicked
Priest, the other two major characters of the Dead Sea Scrolls.



166 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
When Arthur was an infant, Merlin took him from Uther, his father, and
gave him in adoption to Sir Ector. The boy grew up with Ector's son Kay as
a brother. On the death of King Uther, Merlin initiated a contest of
swordsmanship to find who should be king. Kay, it transpired, had
forgotten his sword, and he sent Arthur to fetch it. Unable to do so, Arthur
took the sword from the stone and gave it to Kay, who then falsely claimed
that he himself had drawn it from its place, and thus that he should be king.
His father, realizing the ruse, returned the sword to the rock in which it had
been found and bade Arthur draw it out — which, of course, he did.
Likewise Genesis 38 contains a marvellous story which manages to kill
two mythical birds with one stone. It is important to note here that 'Jews'
are Judaites. Tamar (palm tree), who I propose is the Goddess of the
thirteenth stone, gets herself pregnant to her father-in-law, Judah, by
playing the harlot. She conceives twins, who are born in a strange and now
predictable way. He who is to be called Zarah puts his hand out from the
womb (raises the sun in the tree) and the midwife ties the scarlet thread
around it, denoting his inheritance of the throne. But it is his brother Pharez
who is born first. Thus, as mother to both Israels — the true and false Jews
— Tamar is an incarnation of the Goddess. Subsequently there is a major
dispute as to who is heir to Judah — the Jews. But it is those born last
(Zarah) who are to inherit. At the time of the Exodus from allegorical Egypt
in the Last Days, the line of Pharez (the older Jews) go into Palestine. The
Zarah line have wandered off into the mists, no doubt, of a Templar
Avalon. Curiously enough, Josephus in Antiquities 11,5,2 tells us there are
two tribes in Europe and Asia subject to the Romans. In John 11: 52 Jesus
the Teacher is to gather together the 'children of God that were scattered
abroad'.
In the second part of the story, the genealogy goes on to show that the
descendants of Pharez produce the line of David (shepherds) while Zarah's
royal thread is antecedent to the Sceptre. This line is the sceptre that did
depart from the false Israel. The true nation, it transpires, retained it. As in
the story of Arthur, so with Zarah and Pharez: the true king comes
unknown and crowned by Merlin the Star in the Last Days, on behalf of the
Old Ones. The lineage of David presents an apparent contradiction here, but
this will be clarified.
Biblically speaking, it is after the destruction of the House of David
the ancient magi priests — that the people cease to be 'the House of Judah'
and become 'the nation of the Jews' who occupy Judea. Zarah and his kin
arguably wander off to the



NEMESIS 167
north-west (Europe?), this being where we will find the Sacai or Sacea
sunni (sons of Isaac) — refer Genesis 21: 12 and Romans 9: 7. These
Saxons may also have been the biblical egel/engel, meaning bull. This ties
in well with bull worship in Britain and may provide the source for the
name 'English'. 'Ish', it will be recalled, means 'man', and Abraham is
Taurus. Thus it may also be argued that, as 'brith' means covenant, 'brith
ain' would mean covenant people.
Seeing this as a future event, Matthew 23: 2 implies that the Jews sit
falsely upon the seat of Moses, which is one and the same with the seat of
David — the Teacher, the son of the Taurean bull. In John 8: 39 Jesus tells
the Jews they are not Abraham's children. In Revelation 2: 9 we read:
...I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not,
but are the synagogue of Satan.
Revelation 3: 9 says:
Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they
are Jews, and are not, but do lie...
In a future tense where we have an alternative Israel, these passages
make sense. But let us remember that we also have alternative Christians of
every race.
Most importantly, the story of the young Arthur giving the power of the
stone to his step-brother tells us that the false Messiah, who I shall show is
the biblical Satan, will come first and that he will probably be Jewish in the
general and accepted sense.
In II Samuel 2 David the Teacher, after the death of Saul, is made King
of Judah while Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, is made King over Israel. That
is to say Paul/Saul the Liar is the priest (Judah) and Ish-bosheth is the
Antichrist who is made king of modern Israel. In this respect, Scripture
presents us with two contradictory statements, I Samuel 28: 6 and I
Chronicles 10: 13-14. Nevertheless in the latter passage God slays Saul and
gives the kingdom to David. Among his dominions, which he held for two
years, was that of the Ashurites. Ish-bosheth means 'man of shame', and it is
highly unlikely that anyone, including Saul, would name their son so, nor is
it likely that any man would retain such a name. What we have here is a
parallel of Paul/Saul's breakaway Christianism from that which is being
taught by the Righteousness Teacher in the Last



168 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Days and which is reflected in Paulism becoming the foundation of
historical Christianity. It is Paul who says that Jesus is God made flesh
and he will say the same of the Antichrist. This is what identifies Paul as
the Liar. This is what is meant in the Scrolls by 'the Spouter of Lies'.
Earlier, as we saw, Lucifer is the Antichrist in the Old Testament, and
we may now see Paul as a man who worshipped the Beast in the New
Testament. Just as there is due to come a true prophet and Messianic King,
there shall also be a false prophet and an Antichrist who fits the role of
Lucifer. That is to say, in keeping with the story of Paul, he must — after
the Teacher's death — proclaim a vision which later is fulfilled by the
Antichrist/Lucifer, who declares himself to be the Messiah. In Revelation
13: 3 the beast is 'wounded to death' and then healed. In 13: 11-12 we seem
to have a Paul-type Liar who is like a 'lamb', and his 'word' causes the
worship of the beast. This would indicate two separate characters.
In Scripture Paul is a persecutor of true Christians before having his
vision of the risen Christ. He is never an apostle of Jesus, and his teachings
become the foundation of false Christianity. The Scrolls speak of someone
who persecutes the Teacher and leads much of Israel astray. We shall get to
this anomaly in a moment.
My argument is dependent upon how one views the Wicked Priest and
the Man of a Lie/Spouter of Lies. Geza Vermes holds that they are
different, while others see them as identical. The fact is that the evidence is
inconclusive. The unquestionable logic is that in a Last Days scenario there
have to be a priest of truth and an anointed king with their deceitful
counterparts, and mankind must make its choice. Each side must appear
truthful and right, response being contingent upon the spirits of truth and
perversity which inhabit the individual. With the objective being to
eliminate perversity and bring salvation, these men are catalysts. In the
commentary on Haba-kkuk 2: 5 it is said that the Wicked Priest is called by
the name of truth when he arises. That the Teacher should teach a
conservative and occult doctrine from his revelations can only serve to
make him appear evil in liberalized societies which loosely hold to a
watered-down system of belief. It can also be added that at this point we are
forced into a decision as to whether the Scrolls and Scripture are ancient
documents expressing a failed and unfulfilled dream and are now of only
academic interest, or that they are inspired and instruct us for the immediate
future. If the latter, then Jesus the Teacher is not a historical figure but a
prophecy to be fulfilled.



NEMESIS 169
Had the Bible always been as easy to understand as I am hoping to
convey, our ignorance of it and the diverse and mutually contradicting
religious sects, which dispute with each other, would never have come
about. Furthermore, it must be understood that we are not concerned here
with becoming another useless appendage to this mindless body. I trust
that, at least thus far, I have shown that I have no interest in engaging in
religious polemic or exegesis to support some innovative but equally futile
religious movement. My sole purpose is the unravelling of a complex series
of myths. In so doing I am exposed to the very same criticism that these
diverse sects aim at each other. For example, I have used the term
'spiritually evolved Israel' throughout this book. In Romans 9: 3-5 Paul
argues against any spiritual Israel, and does so with support from scriptures
such as James 1:1, I Peter 1: 1 and Revelation 12: 17. Thus I might be said
to be in error. But, as a convenient method of conveying the idea of
spiritual evolution, I use the term without hesitation. Certainly, I totally
deny the traditional concept of ethnicity, but this stance is supported by
commonsense anyway. I suspect that, interestingly enough, the
evolutionary factor that will allow people of all races to become Israelites is
a genetic one.
In my analysis of the letter of James (below), I Corinthians 11:18ff.
stands in contradiction to James, where one body of the Church is poor and
the other is not. It is this literalism which has fed the numerous sects which
often appear like gangs supporting opposing football teams. The Scrolls
themselves highlight the underlying myth that disunites the surface text. So
it must be understood that if, for example, Scripture had been written in
such a way that James and Paul were seen to be in total opposition, the
entire structure of religious history might have been quite different: there is
always the cross-breeding of theology which allows some kind of unity.
This, again, is not my concern. I seek to go beyond this literal juxtaposition;
I am concerned with investigating the Scrolls' idea that there are hidden
mysteries in Scripture.
In the matter of Paul and the Jerusalem Church, the New Testament
presents sufficient data for us to draw parallels with the Scrolls. At some
future time, when the Teacher's followers are the only true Jews in the
world, Paul with his emphasis on faith in the resurrected Jesus (Antichrist)
brings his message to Gentiles who cannot become Jews. He waters down
the message and causes schisms within the Church of the Jews (Acts 9: 23
and 15: 5). Paul's



170 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
deviation from the teachings of James and his brush with Peter are shown
up in Galatians 2 and 3.
The matter of Paul as the Spouter of Lies thus needs to be looked at
through James, who ideologically is opposed to his teachings. Very simply,
for Paul faith in the crucified and risen Christ is enough. James's Church in
Jerusalem insists on total adherence to the law. The entire tenor of his letter
is to warn, exhort and give instruction in the law. We may see from James
2: 3-5 and Galatians 2: 10 that the Jerusalem Church are Ebionites
(Ebionim = the poor). This gives us a direct link to the Scrolls, where the
community is so designated. The letter accredited to James in the New
Testament — and it is important that this should be understood — not only
gives us a direct line with the Qumran Scrolls, but is in many respects the
antithesis of Pauline doctrine and, by implication, the antithesis of what we
know as modern Christianity. As to this letter having any relationship to
any James at all, we find that its origins are quite spurious. It must be said,
and I do not think it an exaggeration, that for modern Christianity all but
the writings accredited to Paul are not only superfluous but they contradict
him. Again in very simplistic terms, in common with the literature of
Qumran, the New Testament writings, excluding those attributed to Paul,
present a legalistic community for whom 'works of righteousness' far
exceed the value of faith. Paul presents and worships a dead god where the
other writings — with the possible exception of the mystical John
present a reluctant hero forced upon the world stage by his wisdom. They
do not see him, nor does he see himself, as anything more than a man with
a new revelation. Had an historical Jesus been divine, there surely would
not have been any reluctance displayed in his mission.
To make my point regarding the ease with which Scripture is brought
into question, let us make the following examination of James the Just, who
in translation might equally be James the Righteous. In Matthew 4: 21 and
10: 2 he is a son of Zebedee and brother of John. I have already suggested
that, mythically speaking, John the apostle could equally be John the
Baptist. It will also be recalled that Nostradamus speaks of the Teacher, the
Messianic King and John the Baptist as brothers. In Matthew 17: 1 James
and John are brothers. Mark and Luke support James being the son of
Zebedee and brother of John. In Acts 1: 13-14 we have James the brother of
John in company with James the son of Alphaeus. James the son of
Alphaeus makes his only appearances in Matthew 10: 3,



NEMESIS 171
Mark 3: 18, Luke 6: 15 and Acts 1: 13 as above. There are also three
references to James the son of Mary — not to be confused with Mary the
mother of Jesus and James the brother of Jesus. In Acts 12: 2 James the
brother of John is put to the sword. This is helpful because we now have
one less James in the crowd to confuse us. But the plot thickens. In Luke
and Jude we have two references to James the brother of Jude. Matthew 13:
55, Mark 6: 3 and Galatians 1: 19 make direct references to James the
brother of Jesus; then there are sundry other appearances that have been
used by interpreters to create a history of this character but which, under
the circumstances, are open to question. The all-important point is that
Luke has no reference to James the brother of Jesus, and Luke is concerned
with Jesus the Righteousness Teacher. What we really need to know is
which particular James is brother to which particular Jesus. His exclusion
from Luke as related to Jesus must make him brother to the Jesus in
Matthew.
The answer to our Jimmy riddle lies in the Scrolls, particularly those
unearthed by Eisenman and Wise and published in The Dead Sea Scrolls
Uncovered. As an indication of the link to be made between the Scrolls and
this particular aspect of the New Testament, Barbara Thiering in Jesus the
Man has concluded that James was the Righteousness Teacher and Jesus
the Liar. But I disagree.
In the Scrolls the ministry of the Teacher (the Jesus of Luke) is
concurrent with his persecution by the Wicked Priest. In the gospels, Jesus
dies before Paul appears on the scene. So it is logical, in the light of the
numerous incarnations of the Teacher in Scripture, that he should also make
an appearance as James the 'spiritual' brother of John and also of the
Messianic King Jesus of Matthew and be a son of Mary the Goddess. Thus,
mythically speaking, James is another version of the Teacher. In this way,
this man in the character of James is able in Scripture to play out his role
with Paul without making the comparison between the Scrolls and New
Testament too obvious. Theoretically, the mysteries have been hidden for
him to reveal and, as I have implied, if the links between Scripture and the
Scrolls had been very obvious, the problem would have been solved long
ago.
With the Bible's history being what it is, it is impossible to grasp and
economically explain the concepts we have before us. The vast panoply of
diverse religions and beliefs that have sprung from Scripture have done so
because of total ignorance regarding its true nature. Everyone took the
surface text seriously. Its total lack



172 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
of seriousness may be exemplified in the story of the birth of Isaac, who
was born to Sarah when she was 91 years old and her husband, Abraham,
who was 101 years old — refer Genesis 17: 16-19; 18:10-15; 21:1-8.
The formula is simple. Abraham, it will be recalled, is Taurus and the
Teacher is a Taurean. Sarah is the Goddess of the thirteenth stone and, in
Hebrew, Isaac means 'laughter'. When God made the covenant with
Abraham He told him he would have a son who would father many nations
which, as I have said, is the result of the Teacher's revelation. Abraham
laughed because of his and Sarah's age, so their son is called laughter. The
point is that the Goddess bears him when she is old, at the end of the age.
But one must wonder here as to who is laughing at whom. From the dawn
of Pisces two thousand years ago, the coming of the kingdom promised to
Abraham has been awaited. Most people have given up waiting. The Bible
seems too old to bear fruit, and anyone suggesting — now — that the
kingdom of heaven is at hand would be laughed at. After all, it contradicts
all accepted wisdom.
In the birth of Isaac as another incarnation of the Teacher (the son of
Abraham/Taurus), although the Goddess is near her end, just before she
reincarnates in a new age, at the terminus of Pisces she bears the man who,
in wisdom, is fathered by Taurus, and this is a great source of laughter.
What he must find in Scripture is, literally, laughable.
In Genesis 15: 16 Abraham is told that his children shall inherit the
promised land in the fourth generation. This seems quite in order, given that
a generation is an age. Hence, we have Abraham (Taurus), Isaac (Aries),
Jacob (Pisces) and Reuben (Aquarius). There is no contradiction here: the
Bible is somewhat repetitious in its plots, but it is economic in its utilization
of characters. While Isaac as a son of Taurus is, in character, the Teacher,
genealogically speaking he is also Aries, the son of Taurus. If we are to
speak of contradiction, we find it in the surface text in Genesis 17: 8, where
God says He will give the promised land to Abraham himself. This
scripture is a confirmation of Genesis 13:15, where God says:
For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy
seed for ever.
In Exodus 32: 13 Moses reminds God of this promise, so it cannot be
said that this is scribal error. The fact is that it is only with



NEMESIS 173
Abraham as Taurus and Reuben as Aquarius that these writings can be
totally harmonized. Furthermore, historically speaking, these scriptures are
more examples of the fundamental nonsense of the traditional view.
Abraham, biblically speaking, was born in 1996 BCE and, no matter how it
is viewed, his seed have not permanently held the land for the past 4000
years. If the reader should think this a matter of purely academic biblical
speculation, he should be made aware that it is because of these verses that
we are told daily of the death and destruction which has now become an
intrinsic part of Middle Eastern affairs. One example of this is the shrine in
Hebron that is claimed to be the burial site of Abraham. It is in fact no more
than about 2000 years old. It is at this 'sacred' site that Jews and Moslems
fight and kill each other for the exclusive right to worship the stars of
Taurus.
I predict that, because of these few scriptures, in the not too distant
future much of mankind will be annihilated. One possible example of this
catastrophic dispute of the future is where in Acts 7: 5 the Spouter of Lies
says that God gave Abraham 'none inheritance'. Another scriptural
contradiction solved, but it does not alter the future.
Conclusion
The argument has been expanded a little further with evidence that Israel and the
Temple appear much later in history than has been believed.
I have also expanded the roles of the Wicked Priest and the Liar to show that, like
the New Testament epic, the Old Testament too is part of this Last Days story.
We shall later hear much more of Merlin and King Arthur, who have been
introduced as the Star (Teacher) and the Messianic King Jesus who draws his sword
(power) from the thirteenth stone.
By showing that the numerous Jameses in the New Testament can be reduced to
James the brother of King Jesus, I have identified him as another version of the
Teacher. According to my further argument, this minor epic was created to allow
the Teacher to play out his role with Paul the Liar without giving the game away.
Without James, the New Testament story would have been too similar to that of the
Scrolls.
Finally, what is the connection between the War Scroll and Revelation? Did John
take a copy to Patmos, where he is supposed to have written his apocalypse? If so,
how did he obtain this text in the first instance if he was not a pagan Essene?



10
The Law and the Profits
The story of Isaac is easily shown to be yet another version of the elements
we have discussed. There is a contest between him and Ishmael, who, like
Jacob (real Israel), became the father of twelve sons and a daughter (refer
Genesis 25). His wife is an (allegorical) Egyptian. And his only daughter?
She is given in marriage to Esau (the false Israel). In the fourth chapter of
Galatians, Paul the Spouter of Lies allegorizes this story to show that Jesus
sets men free from the law — another example of the Bible scribe poking
fun at the literalism of the traditional interpreter. But the unveiling of
Scripture by Jesus the Teacher must include the revealing of the real Israel
and Messiah, and thus the Jews seek to kill him (refer John 7:1).
When Reuben rogers Jacob's concubine (Genesis 35: 22) — in Pisces the
female is in bondage so she is not his wife — mythically speaking it is
established that, though he is the firstborn of Jacob, he does not have the
role of the sun. By taking Jacob's place in his bed — 'thou wentest up to my
couch' — in the sequence where Jacob is Pisces (Israel in captivity) and
Reuben is Aquarius, it is established that Reuben is the next and new age.
In Genesis 37: 2 it is Joseph (the sun) who blows the whistle on Reuben's
committing his dastardly deed, the sun declaring a new sign (Reuben
usurping Jacob). In verse 3, Joseph's receipt of a coat of many colours,
which makes him the creator of the rainbow — a sign of God's covenant
with man — is the same as Reuben sleeping with Billhah, because it is
declaring roles and identities. In Genesis 28: 11ff. it is established that:
1. There is a stone of Israel.
2. It is the means by which God speaks to man.
3. By God's changing Jacob's name to Israel in this fashion, it is clear that
the stone is the means by which Israel is created.
In Genesis 49: 22 Joseph is described as a fruitful bough with branches
by a well, that is, a tree with its roots close to water — the words of God. In
verse 24 it is from Joseph that the 'stone of Israel' is to come. It is with this
stone, which Jesus says the builders rejected, that the divine right of
inheritance of the priest kings of Judah is established. See also I Chronicles
5:1.
In keeping with God being the sun and thus this stone, which



THE LAW AND THE PROFITS 175
man has turned his back upon, Isaiah tells us the following. In 28: 2, the
Teacher is a mighty one of God who will come with a mighty, overflowing
flood of God's word. In verse 16 God will lay a foundation stone in Zion;
in verse 19 it will be a vexation to understand the report of these words of
God. Daniel says the unrighteous will not understand when the Bible is
opened, and in John 1: 5 we read 'And the light shineth in darkness; and the
darkness comprehended it not'.
In Isaiah 28: 21 the Lord will perform a 'strange work' and bring to pass
a 'strange act'. In 33: 16 the Teacher's defence will be munitions of rocks;
like David he will hurl stones. God is thus termed the 'rock of salvation'
who in Genesis 17: 1-5 makes Abraham (Taurus) the father of not one
Israel but 'many nations'. In Genesis 17: 6-7 kings will come out of him and
Sarah, and in verses 15-16 Sarah is to be the mother of nations (plural).
It should be noted that the hovering of Israel from twelve to thirteen
tribes and back again is not isolated to the matter of the role of the Levites.
Joseph is not a tribe, and this leaves him free to pass from one sign to the
next. Thus, with Joseph the sun as his father, Jesus declares in John 14: 2
'In my Father's house are many mansions...', the houses of the moon on the
ecliptic. So, with the exclusion of Joseph and the inclusion of his two sons,
the twelve become thirteen and then twelve again with the exclusion of the
Levites.
It is during his father's lifetime (Jacob = Pisces) that Joseph goes off to
serve the Egyptians and becomes the root cause of Israel's captivity. The
families follow Joseph into Egypt, where they become slaves. Thus, the sun
enters Pisces and the nation is in bondage. Now, even the period of that
captivity is open to question — whether it was 400 years (Genesis 15: 13),
chronologically 215 years, 430 years (Exodus 12: 40), a period of affliction
lasting about 80 years or a period of distorted genealogy in Acts 7: 6. A
sensible Josephus, in Antiquities 2,15,2, makes it 215 years. This presents a
very good example of how superficial Scripture is openly contradictory.
Things are never quite what they seem.
In Genesis 46: 26 there are 66 direct descendants of Jacob/Israel who go
into Egypt with their wives. In the following verse there are added Joseph
and his two sons; thus 66 + 3 = 69. Somehow, the author of this verse
arrives at a total of 70. Acts 7: 14 makes the number 75. By the time of the
Exodus which we will generously assume as 430 years, the 66 + 3 has, I
assume, become about three million. This I conclude from Exodus 12: 37
and Numbers 1: 46,



176 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
where only males are numbered. If one follows the chronology carefully,
the captivity could not have been longer than 215 years, as I have pointed
out. This would have left Israel with a breeding programme so intense that
there would have been little time or energy left for slavery to a nation of
beleaguered, bemused and disenchanted Egyptians, whose virility was
demonstrably wanting.
The means by which Israel finally achieves its freedom from bondage is
established in the first fifteen chapters of Exodus. This comprises ten
judgements, which are the ten-sephiroth Piscean tree, and thirteen miracles,
which clearly begin with the 66 books of the Bible and the 70 elders of
Israel.
Thus, it is at the end of the Piscean captivity that Moses the Teacher
receives the Law written upon two stones, after the people of the sun and
the zodiac have escaped from bondage. The two stones, it will be recalled,
are Coma and the Sun. Thus the Old Testament legislation is not wiped
away by the crucified Jesus, as Paul will have us believe. Biblical law is
specifically for Israel in the future, and this gives us considerable harmony
between Scripture and the Scrolls. In Exodus 19: 8 the new people gives its
verbal and contractual word of acceptance of this law to God, a code
dealing with the Kingdom of God 'on earth'. In complete harmony with the
War Scroll, it is after the total destruction of Esau/Edom (the rulers of the
land of Israel in the Last Days) that the real nation will be established. Thus
the fact that Jacob and Esau are twins makes the point that at this time there
are two Israels — one, the apparent heir, is to lose its birthright and the
other is to gain it.
The perennial problem with the Scriptures is man's search for the
miraculous. The world in which we live is the absolute miracle. The Bible
is not a foundation for any sort of religious ecstasy or self delusion: it
recounts events as they will fall, as God works His will through evolution.
It also lays down a ground plan by which this is achieved. Irrespective of
who is right or wrong, or how much they may be offended by the reality
that shatters their religious dreams, they piss their self-righteousness into a
gale force wind. God the unknowable remains unmovable.
Down here on earth, each and every one of us, including the saints, are
bound by the limitations of the flesh. All debate as to the life, or even lives,
hereafter is irrelevant mass debating in which people indulge because their
stomachs are full and their heads are empty. Presupposing that there is
somewhere some kind of sanity, how can it be that a minority can devote so
much time to building



THE LAW AND THE PROFITS 177
spiritual fantasies while all around them is poverty and desolation?
Psychologically, they may be excused on the principle that these illusions
are the product of an escape mechanism which comes into play when
reality becomes too harsh. That we excuse it does not mean that evolution
will countenance it. Though Jesus walked on water, his detractors danced
on fire at the stake. Where he turned water into wine, the Church made
large amounts of gold from a little straw. But you cannot sell a product for
which there is no market. If one examines the relationship between a
prostitute and her client, it is impossible to distinguish who is exploiting
whom.
But the search for the miraculous does not end with Jesus. It continues
today with past life regressions, flying saucers and the channelling of
thirty-five-thousand-year-old demons from ancient civilizations that never
existed. The Bible tells us that the dead know nothing, that they sleep until
judgment day.
Evolution and the real world detest such weakness, and it is periodically
eradicated. How we feel about this is irrelevant: God does not consider the
opinions of the weak and foolish. By this I do not imply that any one of us
is wise; my point is that we must now urgently abandon illusion or suffer
the consequences. We cannot play the role of dreamer when we are nothing
more than a small part of God's dreaming; the dream cannot become the
dreamer. My own findings are not necessarily total truths, but they are
absolute and total evidence of our degree of self-delusion. Irrespective of
what you or I believe, that which is to occur will occur. Our opinions will
not be sought. If you choose the role of a sheep, you must accept being led
to the slaughter. The universe is causal and everything has its price. There
is none more exciting and beautiful, none more giving and bounteous, than
nature. But she is also an extraordinarily harsh mistress. As our mother, she
births and nurtures us. As our wife, she is tender, sensuous and caring. But
at the day of death she consumes us. As a woman, she cannot love a weak
man. Her femininity seeks to be conquered powerfully by one who will
seed her with healthy children. This is the nature and truth of things: she
births us, mates with us and, like the spider, finally consumes us. Oh so
sweet, but bitter-sweet, are the gifts our mother brings.
We are all familiar with the myth that during the desert wanderings God
provided manna and quails to feed the people. This, again, is miraculous.
What is rarely mentioned is that this supply was, from time to time, cut off
to drive home the message that the



178 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
law was not open to debate. God was at the helm and was setting the terms
and conditions. This, like all Scripture, has many meanings; we may
interpret this in relation to the Liar, who offers unconditional food
spiritual nourishment — which proves to be no food at all. Likewise, in
Exodus 17:1-7, God tests the people by leaving them without water (His
word), but the miracle that is remembered is that Moses drew that water
from a rock by striking it with his staff. The Hebrew in this instance is 'tsar',
which does not imply a piece of masonry among many: it refers to 'the
rock', the thirteenth stone.
Biblical law is often harsh and uncompromising. The Liar serves God's
purpose by separating those who are able to face reality from those who
prefer to play with spiritual toys. It is clear from Hebrews 9: 22-23 that
Christ — not Jesus — makes the necessary blood sacrifice; it is the
menstrual emission that cleanses the sin of the womb. In this sense alone
Christ did die for us and it is only in Christ that we shall find life. Thus all
flesh is the product of the sacrifice of the womb. This blood is of the dark
magic manifest in a very real world. Ultimately, contrary to what we are led
to believe, Isaiah 43: 11 confirms a harsh truth:
I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.
Nowhere in these texts are we dealing with religions; it is all a matter of
our individual and collective ability to face and deal with reality. The heart
of Paul's lie is to be found in the second chapter of Ephesians, where verses
15-16 read:
Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of com
mandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain
one new man, so making peace;
And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the
cross, having slain the enmity thereby:
In this, he is specifically saying that faith in the slain Jesus sets us above
the law.
In the second chapter of Colossians, Paul the Liar spells out his
blasphemies. In verse 3 he acknowledges the role of the Teacher, which he
must establish as the major characteristic of the false Messiah:



THE LAW AND THE PROFITS
In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Verses
9-17 are the crux of the matter:
For in him [the resurrected Jesus] dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead
bodily.
And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and
power:
In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without
hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of
Christ:
Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the
faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.
And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath
he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;
Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was
contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them
openly, triumphing over them in it.
Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an
holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:
Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.
These verses raise a considerable number of questions, not least of which
is Essene abhorrence of animal sacrifice. They will certainly help the non
specialist to see that, contrary to assertions, superficial Scripture does not
harmonize: in fact it is full of glaring contradictions. This is why, as I have
said, there exists such a plethora of Christian sects.
It is only when we realize that the Bible is relating a future event that we
see why Paul contradicts his fellows. In the tradition of the true initiate,
Jesus the Teacher is promoting the Law which 'has been slacked'. Paul
literally says that it is enough to worship the Beast, which according to him
is salvation. This, as an historical reality, is a shadow cast by events that
will occur when modern Israel builds the Temple in Jerusalem. Then the
false Messiah will proclaim himself, and in so doing will meet the religious
aspirations of Christians and Jews alike. The economic dominance of the
179



180 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
West and the economic and religious domination of that power by Israel
and worldwide Jewry will, with the development of modern technology,
give the Beast complete control in a very short time. With people not able
to buy or sell without the mark of the Beast, his power will be total. In a
world in ever-deepening crisis (perhaps after a major collapse of the
international monetary system), with a decline in education, mass media
communication, the means to effect electronic transfer of money, he will be
welcomed with open arms. Particularly if, as a religious phenomenon, he
restores order after chaos, order which will give him absolute power.
Paul's lies regarding the Messiah from modern Israel are confirmed in
Acts 2: 30, where his saviour is to be the fruit of David's loins, the Pharez
of Judah. This is a typical example of Scripture painting a continuous
picture of two Israels. In Matthew 1:18 — and this is an extremely
important point — Mary conceives, not from the fruit of David's loins, but
of the Holy Ghost. In Matthew 1: 3ff. this 'Davidic' bloodline goes through
to Joseph — David is the Teacher and Joseph the sun — who was not the
actual father of Jesus in literal Scripture. As a mythological construction,
the first chapter of Matthew may be seen to introduce the birth of the real
messianic King Jesus into a genealogy which then may be seen to have no
blood relationship to him at all. That is, he is born of Mary, for whom this
genealogy has absolutely no relevance, and sired by the Holy Ghost, who is
equally unrelated to anyone mentioned. But if we translate 'Holy Ghost' as
implying a spiritual rather than a physical birth, this becomes a different
matter again. Thus King Jesus (the Messiah) may arguably be spiritually
born from any race on earth. To emphasize my point, the genealogy in
Matthew may well be a religiously inspiring fairytale, but it is legally and
actually totally nonsensical. Paul's lies must then include the claim that his
Messiah is a direct descendant of Pharez, son of Judah and ancestor of
Solomon, the builder of our non-existent temple. But Solomon was not the
only son of David the Teacher, who, no doubt, will have many spiritual
sons conceived by Mary the Goddess and the Holy Ghost.
The genealogy in Matthew confirms these findings by presenting us with
a major scriptural contradiction. Deuteronomy 23: 3 reads:
An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of
the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the
congregation of the LORD for ever:



THE LAW AND THE PROFITS 181
Ruth was not only a Moabitess, she actually had one of the books of the
Bible named after her. It may be found between Judges and I Samuel. Ruth
married Mahlon of Bethlehem-Judah (Ruth 1: 2-4). According to Ruth 4:
13 she married Boaz, who, 'when he went in unto her, the Lord gave her
conception'. In the genealogy of Jesus at Matthew 1: 5-6, Boaz begets Obed
of Ruth and Obed begets Jesse, who becomes the father of David the King.
Historically speaking, this makes David and subsequently Jesus of Moabite
blood. According to Deuteronomy 23: 3 this would exclude them both from
Israel. Thus, with cunning, and demanding that we examine Scripture with
care, the genealogy in Matthew is both a description of the spiritual birth of
the Messianic King and a genealogy of the false Messiah. Quite clearly,
faith in Jesus is not enough, nor can we dismiss the Bible as a hotch-potch
of disconnected fables. II Chronicles 2:13 reads:
And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding...
Verse 12 says:
...Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who
hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and
understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house
for his kingdom.
The house he must build is the cosmic temple.
The Wicked Priest was known by the name of truth when he arose (1Qp
Hab viii 8-9). He becomes the nation's leader; he 'rules over Israel'. He robs
both the rebellious and the people; that is, those who follow him and the
Gentile nations over which he will have dominance. He builds the city
(New Jerusalem) with blood and therein commits abominations and defiles
the temple of God. So, logically, he is the builder of the temple (of the sun).
He is eventually captured and put to death by someone who is his rival and
is foreign (not an Israeli or traditional Jew). He is put to death by the
Messianic King. This agrees with the idea of a competing spiritual Israel
made up of all nations and choosing its leaders without any preference for
race.
The Wicked Priest does two major and important things: he pursues the
Teacher and is eventually responsible for doing away with him. He also
tries to cause the Teacher and his followers to



182 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
break the law of rest on the Day of Atonement. From this I postulate that,
as a result of the revelation, the Wicked Priest learns the secret of entering
into the stones of fire and thus speaks to the gods. This must become a
major means by which he appears to perform miracles and subsequently
obtains power.
He begins as a righteous man and may even amaze the world by his
power of prophecy. In his pursuing the Revealer of Mysteries, he must
initially do so in order to obtain more information as to the means of
entering the tree. In this sense David/the Teacher/ the Star (Judah)
which is the sun in the tree — is a spiritual parent of twins: he fathers both
the true and the false Messiah. He, being the Star/Sun, does so upon his
sister Coma, who is thus mother to both Light and Dark. This sets both of
them in the realm of the 'Old Ones' or 'Deathless Ones', who are above
these forces, this being the realm of God where good and evil serve His
purpose. For example, in the Damascus Rule (CD 1,14) the Scoffer shed
waters of lies (false doctrines) over Israel, but the Devil can only, like the
lion, prey upon the weak and feeble-minded.
Now, our argument may come full circle. All we need do is look more
closely at Solomon and we shall see the poetic genius and absolute
completeness of the 66 books of Scripture, which stand as a circle of
megalithic stones denying the existence of linear time.
When contrasted with his spiritual father, David, a humble stone
throwing shepherd (mage), Solomon is one of Scripture's suspicious
characters. David cast only one stone (the thirteenth), Solomon built an
entire (theoretical) temple of them, yet God loved David so much more.
Solomon is unquestionably another mythological incarnation of Lucifer,
who was the son of the morning Star/Teacher. Like Lucifer, he began with
great wisdom and spoke to God, who loved him. Likewise, as with Lucifer,
wealth, sex and power eventually brought him to disgrace. Interestingly,
Elisha the prophet, who was the spiritual heir of Elijah (the Teacher),
followed him around, but Elijah would have nothing to do with him (II
Kings 2). Ultimately, God gave Elisha a double measure of Elijah's spirit. It
is Bible stories such as this that add to the difficulty of deciding whether the
Liar/Scoffer of the Scrolls is one person or two. But let us return to the heir
to David's throne.
Solomon is a descendant of Pharez/Judah, the apparent Jews, but was
begotten by David of Bathsheba. In Judaism, bloodlines are matrilineal.
This woman was the wife of Urias, a soldier in David's army. She and
David had an adulterous relationship, and, after



THE LAW AND THE PROFITS 183
arranging Urias's death, David married her and begat Solomon. This, by the
way, makes the biblical Jesus a descendant of an adulteress as well as a
Moabite. This in itself is scripturally untenable, particularly for the man
proclaimed to be the son of God. According to biblical law — and the law
in Scripture is the fundamental — David and Bathsheba's crime was
punishable by death. This would have given us no Solomon to not build a
non-existent temple and no Jesus to fail in his prophecy that it would be
completely destroyed, and the world would then have been minus one filthy
idol, and you and I would not be unravelling this very messy ball of wool.
Tradition says Solomon built the Temple in thirteen years. Obviously, he
set down one stone per year. This raises the question as to where he got his
precious stones. Solomon is famed for his wealth, which was so great and
so quickly acquired that the only way it could have happened was for him
to have gained complete control of the financial system and receive tribute
from every nation on earth. This is what I say will happen.
His mother's name, 'Bathsheba', has some interesting connections.
Shebah, in Hebrew, is both 'seven' (the place of the Goddess on the tree)
and 'oath', the taking of which is scripturally forbidden. In Genesis 26: 32
33 it is the name of a well dug (while in search of the words of God) by the
servants of Isaac/the Teacher. In Isaiah 60: 6, Jeremiah 6: 20 and Ezekiel
27:22 and 38:13, the kingdom of Sheba (the Sabeans) is seen to consist of
traders in precious stones. The Queen of Sheba (the Goddess) visited
Solomon (I Kings 10: 1-13; II Chronicles 9: 1-12); this puts her in
juxtaposition with his adulterous mother, Bathsheba, who is obviously the
Goddess of the Piscean tree. Sheba in Joshua 19: 1-2 is a town allotted to
Simeon, who is Pisces. Sheba was also a Benjamite who was jealous of
David's power (II Samuel 20); ultimately a wise old woman had them throw
his head over the town wall. But, finally, it was Solomon who was
responsible for the destruction of the kingdom of Israel, after he had
brought it to its greatest ever height of power.
It is far too easy to imagine that the world will stand still while this
particular story is enacted on centre stage. Not so: it must be part of a much
larger canvas, lacking in the miraculous and specializing in the mundane. It
is later, after the Teacher's demise, that these events will begin to overtake
human affairs.
One needs to have a reasonable knowledge of the Bible to fully
understand — even with the keys we now have at our disposal



184 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
how massive and daunting a task it presents. With Scripture, one must
watch every word. For example, in Matthew 13: 58 Jesus' powers are
shown to be limited by unbelief. In the preceding verses astonishment is
expressed at the wisdom of a simple carpenter (someone who creates things
from trees). In verse 52, the scribes instructed in the kingdom of heaven
(the hidden mysteries in Scripture) are to bring out things new and old. In
verses 47-48 the heavenly kingdom (the stars) is likened to a net (the tree)
which brought forth many (wise) fishes. And, curiously enough, the Bible
uses the same word ('yam') for 'fish' (wisdom) and 'west' (the location of the
thirteenth stone on the tree). In verse 44 the same kingdom of heaven is
likened to hidden treasure (the mysteries in Scripture). In verse 43 the
righteous are likened to the sun, which 'shines forth'. It concludes with 'who
hath ears to hear, let him hear'. Verse 35 says:
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will
open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret
from the foundation of the world.
That is to say he will reveal all the mysteries of Scripture, which were
hidden from the time of the first civilizations. Book III of this volume is an
analysis showing that myth cycles around the globe conform to this epic.
In verse 33 a woman (the Triple-Headed Goddess) hides leaven in three
measures of meal which, of course, makes the bread (wisdom) rise. In verse
25 the enemy — the Liar — sows tares among the good seed.
In Ezekiel 21: 13 the judgements of God are a trial. In verses 25-27 we
see the conclusion of that trial as the Wicked Priest is overturned after he
has collected all the weak and foolish idolaters of the future Israel and has,
in fact, contributed to its purification by doing so. It reads:
And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when
iniquity shall have an end,
Thus saith the Lord GOD: Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this
shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.
I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come
whose right it is; and I will give it him.



THE LAW AND THE PROFITS 185
In Matthew 6: 29 Jesus points out that Solomon was vainglorious when
he says that, for all his glory, he was no better arrayed than the lilies of the
field. Here again we have the story of the Wicked Priest/Messiah who sets
himself in Jerusalem amid Israel and proclaims himself God made flesh.
The source from which the true king is to come is found in Ezekiel 17: 22:
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of
the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young
twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon a high mountain and
eminent:
The top of the tree is Leo/Judah and it is from the 'lost tribe' that the real
Messiah comes. It is the sun removed and then replaced in the new age.
This leaves us with three major themes which may be seen as follows:
1. There is a false Israel which is to be superseded by the real one. This I
take to be the spiritual nation of the Last Days which replaces the so
called ethnic state. It is from a lost tribe of Judah.
2. A real Messianic king will follow on from the false Messiah, who will be
a man from the false (present day) Israel.
3. There is a true prophet (Revealer of Mysteries) who must be
distinguished from the Liar. This man must also be differentiated from
the Messianic king, just as we would distinguish Merlin from Arthur
which is difficult in some cases.
In the Scrolls, as earlier mentioned, the Liar persecutes and is probably
responsible for the death of the Teacher. This seems to be clarified in
Genesis 4 in the story of Cain and Abel. Cain is born first, which is to say
that the doctrine of Paul the Liar is already with us. Cain was a tiller of the
soil and Abel was 'a keeper of sheep', which is a shepherd, which is another
name for a mage. Cain slew his brother because, when they brought the
fruits of their labour to the Lord, He accepted the gift of a sheep and
declined the fruits of the earth (earthly treasure). Cain being born first, in
Pisces, he brings the fruit of the ten-sephiroth tree. Abel brings (through his
revelation of mysteries) sheep — converts to the true faith. This is
confirmed in verse 15, where 'the Lord set a mark upon Cain'. This is then
the mark of (the worship of Jesus) the Beast, who is a form of the false
Messiah.
The distinction is made here between the teaching of the full



186 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
letter of the Law, as opposed to outright idolatry, with which the Liar wins
converts from true Israel.
To conclude this particular discussion it is worth looking a little more
closely at the differences between the Teacher and the Liar in terms of their
doctrines.
Now, as luck would have it, through the good offices of the Christian
Church, we have, from its foundation, a good example of life under the
Pauline doctrine. It has been a beastly and bloody disaster in which there
has been nothing more than organized chaos. Man has not found God;
neither has he found peace or paradise. In recent times, even Paulism has
been let go and now, increasingly, we live with no law at all. The world we
have today — its teetering on the edge of total destruction — is a
consequence of our individual and collective abandonment of restraint and
adherence to a specific code. Freedom comes with manifold responsibilities
and requires the capacity for each and every member of the community to
act constantly with consideration for the good of the whole. One rotten
apple can turn the entire barrel sour. Thus, mankind being manifestly
unable to cope with total freedom, it must either submit to regulation,
which is purely for the greater good, or literally end its life on earth in
chaos.
We are all familiar with the ten commandments and imagine the statutes
of Scripture to have now become grossly outdated and irrelevant. This
legislation is in many respects quite harsh, but the harshness affects only
those who contravene it. The innocent have nothing to fear; they are, in
fact, set free. Furthermore, the scriptural code is totally comprehensive and
is destined to be the guideline by which mankind will one day live.
There is no such thing as the Mosaic Law. Moses did not — does not
make any statutes. He only acts as scribe taking dictation from God. The
fundamental and underlying principle behind this legislation is that with it
we may learn to love one another.
Romans 4: 15 states that where there is no legislation there is no
transgression, whereas I John 3: 4 states:
Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the
transgression of the law.
This helps us understand that sin is not an abstract concept. It is bound
entirely to conduct, which is itself solely concerned with the kingdom of
heaven here on earth. This strict adherence to a code is



THE LAW AND THE PROFITS 187
tempered by confession, that is the individual's recognition of his failings
and God's acceptance of our frailty.
Matthew 19:17 is as a picture which speaks a thousand words:
And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none
good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the
commandments.
These are the words of Jesus, as opposed to those of the apostles, but
even so there is no real contradiction with scriptures such as John 1: 17.
As an aside, we may see here that Paul totally contradicts his own
saviour. Paul would have us believe that Jesus was more of an animal rights
activist than a Messiah, inasmuch as, having himself nailed to the cross, he
was substitute for the countless cuddly creatures who would otherwise act
as sin offerings. The Teacher quite clearly dies for the Law; he is not an
alternative to it. His dying to bring a new revelation and our faith in his
teaching are completely separate matters.
Because there is much more to reality than the three-dimensional aspects
with which we are familiar, it is impossible to comprehend that obedience
brings bounty and disobedience brings pestilence and disease in its
manifold aspects. In this respect alone, we create our own reality.
We live today in what we like to think of as an enlightened liberal
society. In my opinion, this liberalism is an attempt to avoid and escape
life's harsh realities. A brief look at the realism of biblical legislation will
give us some idea as to how the Teacher will appear as a harsh reactionary
and the Liar an enlightened and worldly prophet.
We are all familiar with dietary regulations that forbid pork and shellfish,
but it is little known that these rules are not exclusive to Scripture.
Poignantly, pork was also anathema to the earlier Egyptians and the pre
Roman Celts of Britain. Also forbidden in Scripture are duck and geese.
Nor is any kind of blood or fat to be consumed, and this can exclude a vast
range of foods. Usury is unacceptable: no money or goods can be lent at
interest, at least not to one's fellow Israelites. Exodus 21: 22-25 reads:
If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart
from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished,



188 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the
Judges determine.
And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life.
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
This basically says 'let the punishment fit the crime'. This rule also
applies to someone giving false witness: the judgement which would have
fallen on the accused must fall on the accuser.
In time to come there will be no prisons, only holding cells pending a
court decision (see Numbers 15: 34 and Leviticus 24: 12). A thief must
repay with interest, he must work to make good the loss. He may also be
given a maximum of 40 lashes (see Deuteronomy 25: 2-3).
Waywardness and stubbornness are punishable by stoning to death (see
Deuteronomy 21: 18-21). The death sentence also applies to rape
(Deuteronomy 22: 25). Adultery brings death to both parties (Leviticus 20:
10) and bestiality brings death to both the man and the beast.
Homosexuality is an 'abomination' punishable by death (Leviticus 20: 13)
and incest also invokes the death penalty. Murder that has more than one
witness carries the death penalty (Numbers 35: 30). But six cities are set
aside as refuges for those who bring about death involuntarily. Disobeying
the court (Deuteronomy 17:12), profaning the sabbath (Exodus 31: 14) and
blasphemy (Leviticus 24:16) are all punishable by death.
Miscegenation — interbreeding of races — is forbidden (Numbers 23: 9
and chapters 21, 22 and 23 generally). All crossbred people are to be killed
in the time of cleansing. The seventh commandment, which forbids
adultery, refers specifically to the adulteration of race. Common adultery is
dealt with in the tenth.
The above are just a few examples of the legislation of the future. These
statutes, when adhered to in spirit and to the letter, when administered in
respect to the common good, set us free. When the law has been uttered by
the Creator of All, it is divine, it is perfect, and if we debate it we are in
error. If we defy it we are without hope. Those few countries that apply this
kind of strict adherence today have a negligible crime rate and the populace
does not suffer the tyranny of crime that is plaguing the West. This raises
the question as to who is free and what is meant by 'freedom'. I would also
have the reader understand that, in this instance, I am reporting a biblical
fact, not necessarily expressing a personal opinion.

Conclusion
Having taken the Bible out of the hands of religionists, we may now perceive that it
is a highly complex set of prophecies, such as those of Nostradamus, achieved by
using the temple/tree as a device to visit the future, which the Book itself would
help create. I have again distinguished between a spiritual as opposed to a
traditional Israel. It having previously been said that Aaron, from whom the
Levitical priests are descended, is another version of the sun, and thus the Levites
are priests of the temple of the sun, the main thrust in this section has been to try to
distinguish the true from the false Israel and thus the true from the false Messiah. In
Scripture, the twin sons of Judah (Jews) compete for the throne. It is after the
destruction of the Temple/House of David/magi-priests that we encounter the nation
of the Jews. We thus not only have a 'lost tribe' or lost stone or lost ark, there is a
clear picture that the Messianic expectation will be filled from this 'totally
disappeared' source.
Scripture indicates that the real Israel is not that which we presently call the Jews.
The latter give rise to the false Messiah after the Temple is rebuilt in Israel, this
being the one that we know as Solomon's. And he, along with Lucifer, is a
mythological incarnation of this false Messiah, who begins with great wisdom and
is corrupted by money, sex and power. Both the true and false Messiahs are spiritual
twin sons of the Teacher, and the false saviour learns the mysteries from him.
In following the question of the Spouter of Lies and Wicked Priest, I identified
Paul as the false prophet where previously I had identified James the Just as another
version of the Teacher. The lying Paul points to the Scriptural contradiction that
Abraham was never given his inheritance, one which both Jacob and his twin, Esau,
contest, along with their families. By amazing coincidence each family comprises
twelve sons and one daughter. And, it will be recalled, Jacob means 'standing stone'.
Hence, Joseph is a rock, logically fathered by a stone.
I concluded, firstly, that Paul's major lie is that sin is cleansed by the blood of his
Messiah; and, secondly, that the Teacher will preach the significance of the law. In a
liberal-minded world this will make him unpopular. Paul will thus lead many of the
Teacher's converts astray. The beast will hold these and the rest of the world captive
through Jewish economic and US military strength.
With the power modern Israel holds in the West and the economic power the
West holds over the entire globe, with the means to electronically transfer money,
and with the West's obsession with a new world order, we could soon find that none
might buy or sell without the mark of the Beast.



190 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Presently, in the occupied territories of Palestine, Arabs and Israelis are engaged
in a bitter struggle. Palestine is one of the remaining edifices of the old colonialism.
In this case the Khazars are building an entirely new empire, one which is at
present almost unseen. Israel's power lies in the ability of the West to keep the Arab
world — a wealthy and resourceful one — divided. The differences between the
combatants appear to be religious, but they are not. The Middle East is a tinderbox
which must eventually set the world on fire. But it might well be argued that
modern Israel is economically incapable of the power that I suggest. The fact is that
her real power lies in the political and economic control she exercises over the US,
which, I say, is destined to act on her behalf.
Herein lies the significance of Scripture and our justification for trying to
rationalize the ludicrous. If I appear to be radical and uncompromising in my
stance, it is because I am aware, and would make the reader conscious of, the
poignancy of the Bible and the Scrolls. Though many now think it outdated, Israel
and the Jesusologists of the West consider the Old Testament an important aspect of
their lives. We should at least consider the power of these zealots to throw the
world into chaos. Furthermore God quite clearly wills this to be so, in order that
you and I might be tried and tested in the purifying fire of the sun in the tree.
We may now view Joseph the son of Jacob in a poetic way, which also illumines
the story of his counterpart, the husband of Mary. It is his 'going into' Egypt that
culminates in Moses' leading Israel 'out of her. Joseph, the great solar phallus,
enters Egypt, the vagina of the Gentile world, and seeds her with the stars of heaven
— the twelve tribes. This is a common theme in myth: heaven copulating with
mother earth. At their birth, these stone people then cross the (blood-) Red Sea as
they depart her womb. Israel, the issue of heaven and earth, then 'multipl[ies] as the
stars of heaven'. The spermatozoa are from the Milky Way, in Taurus, which is
Abraham, the initiator and father of Israel. Thus, Joseph is the phallus, Egypt the
vagina and Abraham the seed; and Israel is the child of this great pagan expression
of the cycle of birth, death and resurrection. They reject their harsh and rock-like
father, and the Teacher's task is to re-install this stone of the sun which the builders
rejected.
Who would have, who could have, believed that the Bible was capable of such
interpretation? I, for one, can only shake my head slowly from side to side as these
words flow from my pen. I am genuinely and honestly as amazed as may be any
who read these 'blasphemies'. But truth is not that which we choose; it is that which
chooses us.

The Devil Made Me Do It
From time to time my editor has been obliged to reason with me over some
of my more passionate statements on the basis of 'You can't say that'.
Invariably the response has been 'Why not, its damned well true, and you
know it'. At this point the argument becomes circular. I am personally
convinced that respectability and correctness are inventions of the Dark
designed to keep the Light at bay. But Grail knights die on their feet rather
than live on their knees; only God and the Lady can tame them.
Thus with thrusting sword in hand, in the full knowledge that my editor
knows not one word of Polish and seeing that the present Pope (at the time
of writing) is a Pole, I shall mount my charger and cunningly and gleefully
cry: Koniec balu panno lalu!* Liars scheme in dark corners, the Grail
knight fights openly under the sun. He fully understands the meaning of
'The truth against the world'.
The story of Daniel in the lion's den is an allegory of the Teacher in the
tree: the lion, a symbol of the sun, will not harm him as he sits on the Siege
Perilous. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego are Nos-tradamus's three
brothers — the Teacher, King Jesus and John the Baptist — who enter the
tree which has become a furnace that cannot burn them though the blazing
sun is set in it. Ironically, in a modern setting the den and the furnace seem
places of relative safety.
The story I am telling contains every element of fiction to be found on
any bookshelf: spies, intrigue, international conspiracies, quests for the
Holy Grail, passion, romance and the triumph of good over evil; and in this
case, it transpires, it's all true. Even Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson
have now manifested from the pages of fiction and have substance in our
time and space. Surely, all things considered and at this late stage, I am
justified in setting decorum aside and saying: Frankly, I don't give a damn
what the reader thinks; a world in which lies are so decorously told and
lived is unworthy of my good manners and polite conversation. The reader
must be advised that I simply do not live at the level where, for example,
race is an issue; I will not maintain my poise when I feel an unwelcome
hand and I will not lie back and
* Editor's note: Literally 'Finish dancing, little doll', a faintly old-fashioned
phrase implying 'Enough is enough'; 'Game over'...



192 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
think of England when some beast has made my mind an object of his
desire.
Every race on earth has its own specific characteristics. Humour often
captures the essence of this fact. The English vilify the Irish as stupid, but
the joke rebounds because, wise as the English may be in a temporary,
strictly material world, it sometimes seems that in every Irishman there
lives the eternal poet and the dreamer who remembers the future.
Somewhere there is a legend that God loves the Irish so much that in the
Last Days He will send a flood to kill them as quickly and painlessly as
possible. Jewish jokes are invariably about Jews and money, the best ones
being without exception those told by Jews. But here too we find an
unspoken wisdom, a philosophical acceptance of the role the Jew seems
doomed to play. In humour, Latins are lovers, worshippers of the body,
slaves to physical beauty and form. If one wanted to find a race with
characteristics that would derive a physical idol from a myth about a man
born of a virgin who walked on water and turned it into wine, the Latins
would have to be prime candidates — particularly if they happened to rule
the known world at the time. Thus their natural lust and desire to physically
touch the things that arouse their passions, and to hold aloft the rounded
protuberances of nature's forms, was ultimately fed by and expressed in the
very physical and material gods of the Latin world as we know it today. But
it did not all begin with madonnas and crucifixes. The Romans were very
busy idolizing and lusting after the same characters long before the Essenes
provided the innovation. The religious world is divided into buyers and
sellers; it's all a question of prophetability.
The astute PRO and the clever advertising executive have two basic
'words of knowledge'. They know that words are absolutely extraordinary
things and that most people are lazy in using them; they are also aware that
if they can alter your conception of a particular word they can change your
perception of reality.
Humour is a very useful escape mechanism when danger threatens, but it
does have its downside. Idolatry, by its physical manifestation, is an
admission of failure to grasp reality. 'Lets pretend' eventually becomes
absolutely laughable, and humour becomes the only real means of escape
when that danger threatens.
And so it was, when Rome showed itself as the potential coach driver on
mankind's charabanc jaunt to hell, that the Essenes decided they might as
well provide it with a devil as a tour guide. II Samuel 24:1 reads:



THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT 193
And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved
David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.
I Chronicles 21:1 says:
And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.
These two passages describe the same incident; taken together they say that
God is Satan. Isaiah 45: 7 reads:
I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the
LORD do all these things.
Quite clearly there are many who will read this work and decide that the
Devil made me do it. Before we can cut this idea off at the knees we need
to make a brief foray into a non-existent hell and demolish it, just as
Thompson did with Solomon's non-existent temple. It will also become
apparent at some stage that this poetic comparison on my part has a ring of
truth. Solomon the Wicked Priest, as an adversary (Hebrew: satan) of God,
will establish the temple of the one true hell on earth.
At this late stage in the history of Scripture the edifices created by
popular religion are — though only of cardboard and plywood construction
— most magnificently arrayed and of considerable complexity and
cunning. And they are an obstacle to understanding. True, the Bible does
not help here, but it is quite straightforward on another plane.
I have come to this subject with reasonable intelligence and no
preconceptions; much of what I am finding is as new to me as it may be to
the reader. I have absolutely no interest in what some scholars may or may
not know, and I would certainly not waste my time writing this book for
academics; besides, if they were to substantiate their claims and earn their
keep, this essay would have been written a long time ago. The formula is a
simple one. Aca-demia is very familiar with the matters raised by this text
but is keeping them all to itself. In the mean time religionists have turned
the Bible into a fiction for overgrown, mentally retarded children who ask
nothing more than a rattling good yarn. As a result intelligent people will
have nothing to do with Scripture, and thus there is no threat to the
fairytales. Academia and religion maintain the status



194 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
quo by appearing stupid in the eyes of the intelligent, but do not
underestimate their cunning.
The Bible — like the Scrolls — points to two spirits, as earlier
mentioned. These are fixed, just as a computer is programmed or as a
modern appliance has built-in obsolescence. Those whose names are not
written in the book of life cannot save themselves, nor can they be saved.
Every good film has to have its good guys and bad guys. Yes, I know, what
is the point of it all? The simple answer is spiritual evolution. God uses the
Dark to sharpen the Light. There are no goodies and baddies in the
traditional sense. The basic scenario is that evil comes from the lusts of the
flesh (bestiality or animal behaviour). To call it evil, with all the traditional
connotations, is a value judgement. When viewed through the eyes of one
who is part of this higher man (an Israelite) it is relative bestiality. It is as
illogical to chastise this inferior breed for being what they are as it is to
punish a dog for chasing cats or cats for chasing birds or either of them for
having fleas. So a general Hell begins to become unreasonable. But this
does not deny the existence of the pit in Revelation where the Beast and the
false prophet are to be punished and stored for use in about a thousand
years or so. Hell becomes a place of containment for the Devil. The terms
thus translated are:
Sheol
Sheol is a name, generally translated 'grave'. It is the place where all the
dead go (Genesis 37: 35; Isaiah 14: 9ff.). Thus death, the grave, extinction,
nonexistence is the lot of both the good and the wicked (Psalms 6: 5; 30: 3;
88: 3-6). We all go to Sheol/Hell (the grave) and sleep. Come the day of
judgement, some are raised to glory (Psalms 73: 23-24) and they have
redemption from Sheol (Psalms 49: 14-15). Punishment is then the second
death (death of the spirit) in which there is no partaking in the eternal
kingdom: being ceases.
Abaddon
The Greek equivalent in Revelation 9: 11 is Apollyon. This is simply
ruin or destruction by fire. Termination without eternal torment. Again,
cessation of being after judgement (assessment).
Gehenna
Gehenna is a place on earth; it is the valley of the son of Hinnom,
situated to the south-west of Jerusalem. It was the Jerusalem city



THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT 195
dump, and rabbinic tradition made it first the gateway to hell, then hell
itself. But this says more than is immediately apparent. Life that has not
attained a required level of evolution need not be punished: it is dumped,
disposed of. The soul goes the way of the body: extinction.
So biblically speaking Hell is a place of punishment for the Devil. Those
of us who have not evolved spiritually die permanently, and those who
have are resurrected into eternal life. And all this does not take account of
the negative karma that faces those who have hated or hurt the saints. It
now all starts to appear a lot more practical and down-to-earth. God is in
the process of creating something of which we are a part. The so-called
sinners are a byproduct of the production process. Perhaps, we might say,
they have failed the stringent road-testing requirements. Either way, man
cannot presume to understand or judge the mind of God; and refusing to
believe in and obey Him is an outright case of cutting off one's nose to spite
one's face. Our next task is to look at the now homeless but
phantasmagorical Devil and Satan.
The closest we get to the English 'devil' is the Greek 'diabolos', which
means nothing more than 'slanderer' or 'false accuser'. At some time in our
lives this could almost certainly have been applied to all of us: nothing
occult or mysterious about that. Let it be emphasized that the Greek
'diabolos', translated 'devil', has no meaning beyond someone making a
false accusation, such as might be the case with the false prophet making an
accusation against the Teacher, who suffers persecution, exile and death as
a result of this. But there is an inconsistency in the New Testament which
should be noted. Usually the translation gives the rendering 'devil' for the
word 'diabolos', but in II Timothy 3:1-3 we find:
This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come, For
men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters,
proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy.
Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent,
fierce, despisers of those that are good. (Emphasis added.)
One may wonder in passing how anyone could have made such a concise
and accurate assessment of modern man, some two thousand years ago. But
perhaps it has always been like that. If so, one way or another it cannot be
like that for very much longer.
If the translators had been consistent, verse 3 would have read:



196 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Without natural affection, trucebreakers, devils, incontinent, fierce,
despisers of those that are good.
In Matthew 4 Jesus goes into the wilderness for forty days; likewise
Israel was in its desert wanderings for forty years. Whether we say that
Jesus the Teacher is tempted to surrender his power to the Wicked
Priest/Antichrist, or whether we see it as God testing the Teacher and Israel
for any weaknesses, amounts to the same thing. The Wicked Priest wants
to know the Teacher's secrets, so in verse 3 he asks him to turn to the stars
for wisdom. In verse 6 he suggests that he jump from the pinnacle of the
Temple — jump from the cosmic tree — without dashing his foot against
the thirteenth stone. In verse 9 he is offered a reward of the kingdoms of
the earth, because the Wicked Priest has power only on earth: he has no
spiritual kingdom.
Another form in which we find the tempter in the New Testament is
Beelzebub, and I shall show later that Jehovah is a derivative of Baal
Zephon and Baal-Zebul, who in the New Testament becomes this
Beelzebub. God forbid that Jesus the Teacher should cast out devils in the
name of Jehovah/Jesus, the dominating solar power of 666.
The Satan of the Old Testament has nothing to do with the serpent in the
Garden of Eden. He neither seduced Eve nor fathered Cain upon her. The
Hebrew for 'serpent' in Genesis 3 is 'nachash'. In verse 14 it is clear that this
serpent is mortal because he is to eat dust 'all the days of his life'. The next
time that nachash appears is in Genesis 49: 17, where, in the blessing of
Dan, he is called a 'serpent' and 'adder'. Dan is Scorpio, and the presumed
thirteenth sign. In ancient Egypt Scorpio was a viper or cobra, and the
Hebrew 'nun' (fish, fifty) evolved from the Egyptian hieroglyph for serpent.
Nun the wisdom fish will be recalled.
In Exodus 4 Moses' rod becomes a nachash which heals people. In
Exodus 7: 8-9, Aaron is to cast down his rod before Pharaoh and it will
become a nachash. So Aaron is the sun, the rod is the tree, Moses is the
Teacher and Dan is the stand-in for the thirteenth sign. The snake is a
symbol of wisdom from the sun (666) which sits at the bottom of the tree
and can be seen on most chemist's shop windows as a long-adopted symbol
of their profession. The snake in Genesis etc. is nothing more than an
ordinary everyday limbless, scaly, elongated reptile of the suborder
Serpentes. Well... almost: the one in the garden could talk, but the snake is
the



THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT 197
tree and God speaks through its stones. And as a thing that speaks in the
Bible the snake is not unique; in Numbers 22: 28-30 the ass also has
something to say. The reader may well recall that Samson had a jaw-bone
of an ass (the Pleiades in Taurus) with which he slew Philistines.
In the much earlier mentioned reference to a father giving his son a stone
instead of bread and a serpent instead of a fish, this is clearly the solar
serpent through which God speaks. This must also refer to Job 12: 8, where
fishes speak too; not to mention God talking to Jacob through a stone and
to Moses through a burning bush, and healing Israelites through a brazen
serpent.
Proverbs 30:19 reads:
The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of
a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
The eagle is Scorpio, the supposed thirteenth sign, the serpent sits on the
thirteenth rock, the ship (boat) is the tree in the midst of the Piscean sea, the
man is Reuben (Aquarius) and the maid is Coma. In Fijian tradition the
mother of the Ngendai was a rock, and the Ngendai itself is half rock and
half serpent. The Fijian devil is Rati-mbati-ndua, his name indicating that
he has only one tooth. This must be the thirteenth, because teeth are stones.
The Hebrew word 'sawtawn' (satan) appears seventeen times in the Old
Testament and means 'adversary'. For example, both the Teacher and the
false prophet are satans (adversaries) to each other. The Devil and Satan are
the Liar and the Wicked Priest. The Teacher is preaching a new gospel, and
Paul says in II Corinthians 11:4:
For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached,
or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel,
which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.
The lying Paul is promoting a doctrine of Jesus the scapegoat, which is a blood
offering. Leviticus 17: 7 says:
And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they
have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout
their generations.



198 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
The Hebrew translated 'devils' in this instance is from 'sayir', a he-goat;
this gives us the English 'satyr'. These devils are 'shed', which is 'non
things'. Thus the Jesus of traditional religion is a non-god sacrificial he
goat called a devil. The worship of Jesus is as close as any traditional
Christian will ever get to a devil in the Bible.
In Numbers 22: 22 an angel of the Lord is a satan; in I Samuel 29: 4
David is a satan to the Philistines in battle — and that alone speaks
volumes. In I Kings 11: 14 a political satan from among the Edomites/Jews
is raised against Solomon. As a proper noun it appears in the book of Job,
which we shall deal with in a moment, but it may be said now that the satan
in Job is an adversary and nothing more. The same is the case in Zechariah
3: 1-2, where the scribe aids the invention of the Devil. It is important here
to realize that not only is a satan merely a human adversary but that if one
walks through the fiery stones of the tree one stands before 'the Lord' of the
lock of hair. Thus I am now in a position to comfortably contradict myself
because, having said that Lucifer is not the Devil but the Antichrist king of
Tyre, I now say that Satan is not the Devil either but he is one and the same
with Lucifer, who is the obvious adversary of the Teacher, who has the
lion's share of the Bible as his biography.
In Psalms 109: 6 we have a human satan; the word also appears in I
Chronicles 21: 1 (as above), where it may also be applied to Lucifer. In I
Chronicles 21: 7-8 it is God who exercises displeasure at David (see page
193). Had the correct word, in this sense, been used in the New Testament
it would be 'antidikos', which is a legal adversary such as a prosecuting
counsel, as in I Peter 5: 8, where also 'diabolos' is translated 'devil'.
Another word in the New Testament translated 'devil' is 'daimo-nion'. It
specifically means 'demon', and would be applied to someone who is 'mad'
— lunatic or diseased. It expresses a superstitious view of illness:
possession by the spirit of a departed mortal. For example, Hippocrates
mockingly refers to epilepsy as 'the sacred disease'. Therefore, as in
Matthew 17:18, the casting out of devils is to effect a cure as a doctor
would. In John 7:19-20 Jesus asks, 'Why go ye about to kill me?' He is told
that it is because he has a demon (daimonion) — because he is mad. This
would be a logical reaction to the Teacher's revelation by today's Scribes
and Pharisees. It is obvious that, given the degree to which Scripture is
allegorical, its authors exploited our superstitious nature, and our translators
complied. This could not be better demonstrated than by quoting Ephesians
6:12:



THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT 199
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principali
ties, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of the world,
against spiritual wickedness in high places.
This is evocative of a cheap line from a Hammer horror film, and it is
from the mouth of Paul, who begins his career as a persecutor of Christians.
The powers of darkness are nothing more than the authorities of our world
in a time to come, who will persecute this new humanity. The warning to
them is to beware the Wicked Priest, the Liar and their earthly servitors.
Accordingly, in Matthew 16: 23 and Mark 8: 33 Jesus says to Peter 'Get
thee behind me, Satan'. This is because he lusts after the things of the flesh.
Thus we see that even Peter, the rock upon which this New Israel will be
built, is himself far from perfect. We have come to fear those things that
cannot harm us because they do not exist, yet we shall one day soon make
devils and demons our masters and call them our friends.
The Scrolls story as it pertains here goes something like this:
1. The mysteries having been hidden in Scripture by God's servants the
prophets, the Teacher comes in the Last Days, reveals them and so gathers
Israel.
2. From his revelation, the man destined to be the Antichrist discovers the
means of passing through the stones and wins great favour with God.
3. Along comes Paul the Scoffer/Judas Iscariot/Liar and says that the
Teacher is a fraud. He points to the Antichrist as being the true Messiah.
4. At this point the Teacher has made the first Covenant with God.
5. The Teacher's community has a very strict regimen which the Liar says is
unnecessary for followers of the Wicked Priest.
6. In the mean time the Antichrist is talking to God and deprecating the
Teacher on the basis that he is faithful only because He has been so good to
him (this being the basis of the book of Job).
7. Israel deserts in droves, only a faithful remnant remaining.
8. Ultimately the weaklings are disposed of along with the Wicked One,
and a community of strong, law-abiding Israelites under the Messianic
King Jesus makes a new covenant with the Creator of All. Thus the Golden
Age begins.
The Teacher is a spiritual father to Israel and the Man of Sin, who learns
the secret of passing through the stones from the Teacher's revelation. Thus,
he is not only synonymous with the sun set in the tree, he is also Venus, the
bright morning star that heralds the rising



200 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
of the sun as a solar force (666), which identifies not only the masculine but
also Lucifer the Beast. Venus is not only the Goddess of love — Jesus the
Teacher preaches a gospel of love — she is also the ruling planet of Taurus,
and this man is a Taurean. Thus he is both father and son to Lucifer/Venus.
Accordingly, he is Ophiuchus the red serpent holder who releases the
serpent Antichrist from the pit; he is responsible for the rising of the Beast.
Red is Edom and the Edomites are the Khazars. The serpent in the
constellation Ophiuchus points directly to the location of Coma, who sits
between Gemini and Taurus. The Minotaur was half human and half bull,
which describes the Antichrist (and Teacher) perfectly, but he was killed by
Theseus the Sceptre. Aesculapius (Ophiuchus) became the patron of
medicine because of his healing springs — of the watery word of God.
Thus he is the 'healer' of the zodiac, and the Goddess is mother to both
good and evil.
Not only will this man father a new humanity, he carries full
responsibility for destroying the old. Accordingly, this obscure individual is
given temporary power over the All, and he is subsequently given almost
deific status in Scripture. Thus, we see him in deep anguish as he carries
his burden. In Luke 22: 41-42 we read:
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled
down, and prayed,
Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: never
theless not my will, but thine, be done.
Verse 44 reads:
And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was
as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
This cup is the true cup of the Grail which holds the blood, sweat and
tears of an ordinary mortal who must carry the burden of the ages. For this
reason alone the ancients memorialized him, as though to show support for
this man of sorrows.
We now also have an entirely new view of the book of Job, which
anyone will tell you is anachronistic in the extreme in that it paints a picture
of God and a traditional Satan playing with Job's life as though it were an
expendable toy. He is another version of the Righteousness Teacher, and it
is necessary that he loses almost all he has because the wheat is to be
separated from the chaff by



THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT 201
his adversary. This also takes us a substantial step closer to understanding
the book of Revelation.
The crux of the matter here, as is clear from Scripture, is that the Teacher
not only comes up against a Khazar Jewish Antichrist and presents a true
Israel against a false one; he is clearly in constant conflict with the Jews.
The Great Whore in Revelation, who rides on the back of the Beast, is the
city Jerusalem; she is dressed in red — red is Edom and the Edomites are
Khazars who rule her — and she is destined to be the ruling capital of the
world for a short time.
It will now be apparent that if, as I will show, the Holocaust is a lie, it is
a part of this overall scheme designed to bring about a specific objective as
indicated. World War II may now be seen as a prominent point at which the
grand epic began to coalesce: the war gave rise to Israel, and she will be the
mother of the Antichrist. The Holocaust lie has both silenced critics of this
nation's rise and brought her moral and material support. Holding it up to
scrutiny is therefore a genuine and intrinsic part of the investigation.
Most of the contents of this book rattled around in my head for a number
of years before I put pen to paper; I was, in fact, blackmailed into writing it.
The coercion came from my secretary and very dearest friend (an
implacable satan), who has laboured like a devil to see the task completed.
Oh that Adam had had such an helpmeet. The fact is that I never saw it as a
book that could be written, nor did I see any point in writing it. I do not
require the money, I do not want the fame (infamy) and I am not at all
envious of Salman Rushdi. I am by conviction a Creationist: I believe that
the first dawn of creation wrote exactly what the Last Days will inevitably
bring, and that nothing I can do will change that. And besides, my little life
is a good one as it is: the scriptwriter and casting director were most kind.
All things considered, a mature and sensible man does not take any
pleasure from telling Christians they are Philistines and Jews that they are
imposters. Disrupting a children's game only causes extensive noise pollu
tion. Yes, it is sometimes sad and a little bit lonely knowing that there is
nothing you can say to the people who pass through your life, but as they
say: Seven out of ten ain't bad.
Conclusion
This book is something of a roller-coaster, with endless twists and turns,
and covering a lot of ground. In raising the matter of the traditional Devil



202 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
being yet another fiction, I have aimed at killing two birds with but one stone. I
hope, firstly, to have encouraged the thinking investigator to realise that the Bible
itself should not be held responsible for many of the ridiculous conclusions that
have been drawn from it, a problem not helped by the lofty stance taken by
academia. Secondly, we have continued the process of seeing the numerous biblical
characters as expansions of the few characters in the Scrolls.
My argument is that the Devil and Satan are the Liar and the Wicked Priest. It
may now be obvious that many of the mysteries in Scripture exist because of
mystification by the Church and its translators. And without a Devil there is
obviously no hell — at least not in the commonly accepted sense. As is clear from
the book of Revelation, the pit is a place where the Devil and Satan are stored for a
thousand years, and from which they will be released for a little season. This is after
their now imminent appearance, in which they will do God's work by purifying the
Teacher's new humanity. That they are to be released a thousand years later is
confirmation of their evolutionary role: they will draw to them those few impurities
that were missed the first time around. We may thus speculate that, some eleven
hundred years from now, the earth will be a paradise peopled by angels. Surely
each and every one of us should be moved to hail such a future for our descendants,
and to want to contribute to it.
An extraordinary number of philosophical questions are raised by the notion that,
as Scripture tells us, the dead know nothing (they sleep until the day of judgement)
but this book simply has no space to consider them. Not least of these matters is
reincarnation, about which there has been much ridiculous speculation but very little
serious analysis. Like belief in Jesus, it has become a philosophical means by which
we might excuse our deficiencies. Where Jesus automatically forgives because we
believe in him, reincarnation allows us to presume we can have an infinite number
of lifetimes in which we can play cat and mouse with God.
All this contradicts what must be the central purpose of creation. It denies a
starting-point and a conclusion; it negates the truth that the Great Mind — an
incomprehensible entity — is working at a definite purpose. That inevitable reality
is the marriage of heaven and earth, the culmination of which is that our
descendants will live earthly lives of perfect bliss. This is all here, and it is all now.
There is no time for fantasies. That our Heavenly Father should have prepared such
a gift for us should cause us all to constantly bow our heads and bless His most holy
name.



12
Elijah the Tishbite
The Bible is an amazing and wonderful book. From it we have derived
some very strange conclusions without altering one single word of it. The
truth was always there, sitting on the surface but imperceptible without a
few basic keys. Scripture is obviously designed to be read on many levels,
the same texts providing deeper and deeper meanings.
It is difficult to say how much it encouraged deception and how much
the traditionalist sought to deceive himself. For example, chapter 11 of
Isaiah begins with the 'rod out of the stem of Jesse' prophecy. This, I said
earlier, is the Sceptre who in verse 2 is to have a spirit of wisdom and
understanding. In verse 4 he will judge in righteousness. Verses 6-9 read:
The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie
down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling
together; and a little child shall lead them.
And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie
down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the
weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.
They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth
shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
The chapter goes on to say that the dispersed of Israel are to be gathered
from the four corners of the earth.
This particular prophecy has conjured up for the traditional believer a
picture of strolling in Elysian fields with a tall, dark and handsome god-like
Jesus dressed up in a bed-sheet. Recent westernized Eastern traditions paint
the same picture, but here the godlike Jesus guru is teaching the sound of
one hand clapping or something to that effect. Everyone is smiling, all the
laws of the universe have been defied and reality has been overcome.
Nature being dismayed and defeated by all that is anathema to her, the
weak are to inherit the earth.
The events in the Isaiah prophecy take place in God's holy mountain
which, in Daniel, grows from a stone cut out without



204 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
hands. The lion is the sun, the young lion is the Sceptre, the ox is a symbol
for Coma, the serpent sits at the root of the tree and the lamb and the child
are the Teacher who leads them. Similarly, in Psalm 91: 12 we read:
They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
against a stone.
In verse 13 they will tread upon the lion and the adder, and the dragon
will be trampled under foot: more poetic licence. The book of Revelation is,
by its title and its content, a revealing of events that are to occur in the time
of the apocalypse in the Last Days. It is supposed to be a revelation of
mysteries. The book is anything but that: it is obscure in the extreme. Its
symbols are colourful and rich in imagery, and their impact on the human
psyche has been considerable. This collection of prognostications is also
known as the Apocalypse of John, but, strangely enough, its opening verses
tell a different story. The revelation is clearly that of the Righteousness
Teacher. Chapter 1: 1-3 reads:
The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his
servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it
by his angel unto his servant John:
Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ,
and of all things that he saw.
Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy,
and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.
The words 'at hand' echo the first words spoken by both Jesus and John
the Baptist; hence the time must be 'at hand', as of the coming of the
Teacher who makes his declaration to John and his community in the Last
Days (see page 99). All this is confirmed in Revelation 5: 5:
And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe
of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the
seven seals thereof.
The Lion is a symbol of the sun, which is a star. Jesus — and this is not open to
question — was the root and offspring of David.



ELIJAH THE TISHBITE 205
Thus Jesus is the Star/Teacher who opens the book and reveals its mysteries. The
precise nature of those mysteries we find explained in John 3: 4-5:
Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he
enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of
water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
The water is the mercurial wisdom that flows from God via the Teacher
apropos the cosmic tree. The Spirit is that of the man who passes through it
and into the Kingdom of God. Thus the traditional Christian nonsense
attached to the concept of being 'born again' can be seen to refer to passing
through Coma, our mother's womb. 'Resurrection' is specifically reserved
for the Beast/Antichrist (see Revelation 13: 3). As with Jesus, it is his claim
to divinity.
Words, like lumps of wood, have the capacity to become idols. The
semantic investment we make in them can often take them entirely out of
context. As far as communal investment is concerned, the words 'Jesus
Christ' have had the power to conjure more idols of the heart than the Devil
could ever have hoped for. The problem stems from the simple fact that the
word 'Christ' has been taken out of context. We probably cannot even give
Jesus the status of prophet, in the strictest sense. A Christ is a man who has
been anointed. A prophet is someone who by some means has seen future
events and reports them. From several instances, both in the Scrolls and in
Scripture, we may see that the Teacher does not qualify as a seer. By
interpreting 'all the words of the prophets', he reveals those things that are
to befall the final generation. They are a part of what the magi hid in
Scripture for him to reveal.
Nostradamus, in his letter to his 'spiritual' son, also tells us that it is by
his interpretation of 'the Prophecies' that the Teacher reveals the events of
the Last Days. He himself does not enter between the stones of fire. We
should also bear in mind that, though he has a lion's share of Scripture and
the Scrolls, he takes much of his messianic charisma from Jesus the
Sceptre, who is correctly the Messiah. Here we have a man who speaks to
God and rules the world in His name. He is just and without blemish, his
spirit — we learn from the Scrolls — is eight parts light, and one part
darkness. The Teacher is only six parts light, and is three parts darkness
refer 4Q186 (1) and 4Q186 (2), quoted on page 354.



206 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Coincidentally, Gilgamesh is 'a goring bull' (the Teacher is a Taurean);
he is the son of Ninsun the lofty cow and Lugalbanda the shepherd-king
(the rising sun of the Hyksos, the early Palestinian invaders who were
driven out of Egypt). Gilgamesh is two-thirds divine and one-third mortal
(six parts light and three parts darkness); half-human beast and half bull
the Minotaur. He binds the monster Humbaba with thirteen winds and, after
the Great Flood, restores the sacred halub tree to the Goddess Innana.
We may begin to see that there exists a world of difference between the
Teacher, as one of many ordinary men in history who have brought a divine
message, and Jesus Christ. He is distinguished because he brings the most
important of all messages; nevertheless he is only a messenger. As earlier
mentioned, in chapter 22 of Revelation, Jesus tells John to worship God
and not him. The chapter begins:
And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,
proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
Water is the words of God. It continues:
In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was
there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded
her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of
the nations.
This tree, bearing a new sign of the zodiac each month, can be none other
than the cosmic tree. It goes on in verse 6 to say:
And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the
Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants
the things which must shortly be done.
Here, Jesus the Revealer is distinguished from the prophets when he is
referred to as an angel. In verse 7 the angel/Teacher is speaking:
Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the saying of the
prophecy of this book.
Verses 8 to 16 read:



ELIJAH THE TISHBITE 207
And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and
seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me
these things.
Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellow-servant, and
of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book:
worship God.
And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for
the time is at hand.
He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be
filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is
holy, let him be holy still.
And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man
according as his work shall be.
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the
tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.
For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers,
and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.
I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the
churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning
star.
There is no ambiguity here. Jesus is just a man who plants the tree from which
the world is to be governed forever (see verse 5). As the Star he is the root and
offspring, both David and Jesus.
The primary concern of John's Revelation is the temple/tree. In chapter 11, he is
told to go and measure it and the altar of God. Verse 2 reads:
But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for
it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty
and two months.
At the beginning of chapter 9, a star falls from heaven. As the following chapter
opens, an angel descends with a rainbow about his head — Joseph the sun with his
coat of many colours will be recalled. The angel's face was 'as it were the sun'. And,
in the verse just quoted from chapter 11, the temple is trodden under foot by the
Gentiles. Thus the Star/stone falls from heaven, the new sun rises in the tree, and the
Teacher makes his revelation in a world



208 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
which at this point is populated purely by Gentiles who with the exception
of the newborn Israel refute the message from God (the tree is trodden
under foot); that which should be secret and sacred becomes public. The 42
months (the 3 1/2 years of Jesus' ministry) are the period of the Teacher's
revelation, at the end of which he is killed while speaking of the stone in
the tree. It will also be recalled that Nostradamus says he will harm the
stones. The sacred tree becomes public property, but it is necessary for the
gathering of the people of God.
The third chapter of Acts begins with the working of a miracle and the
apostles chastising the people for denying their master. Verses 17-21 are, in
themselves, very revealing. They read:
And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your
rulers.
But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his
prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.
Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out,
when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;
And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:
Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things,
which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world
began.
The gist of this passage is that there was no Jesus until the restitution of
the former things (the cosmic tree and the priest kings). His story was
preached as early as the time of Sumer, as we have discovered. The Teacher
comes and is killed, the apostles are preaching his gospel and Jesus the
Sceptre is due to take the stage. The important point is that the heaven
the thirteenth — must hold him until the time of refreshing, when all things
are made new. The key to these verses is knowing that they speak of two
Jesuses.
Nowhere, in my opinion, can be found a more spiritual and moving
moment than when, at the modern Jewish Passover meal, a glass of wine is
set on the table for Elijah, and the children are sent to open the door for
him. When they return, an adult will gently shake the table and, wide-eyed,
the children see the spirit of Elijah sip the wine. It is the stuff of magical
and enchanting dreams, another page in the book of the never-ending story.
In the midst of



ELIJAH THE TISHBITE 209
darkness, the light is kindled in a new generation. One day those children
will know, and will take their turn at nudging the table. But one day, as
sure as the rising of the sun, Elijah will come and sup with the children of
light. In the words of the Scrolls, that day will be one of reckoning for the
lot of darkness, an hour when the fearful and unbelieving will be filled with
shame, for Elijah is the herald of God and His coming to possess the earth.
Malachi 4: 2 reads:
But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise
with healing in his wings...
This clearly refers to the sun rising in the tree. Verse 5 reads:
Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the
great and dreadful day of the LORD:
Verses 5 and 6 are the closing words of the Old Testament, and this, I
believe, is significant.
In the New Testament we find Elijah, in the Greek form, as Elias. It is
clear and unambiguous that the nine references to him in Matthew indicate
that Jesus the Sceptre is not he. Mark is in complete agreement with
Matthew. Luke, who is concerned with the Teacher, is ambiguous and
inconclusive; he neither confirms nor denies. In the first chapter of John,
Elias is clearly not incarnate in John the Baptist.
The manner in which mysteries are hidden in Scripture is very simple
and totally effective, and the story of Elijah epitomizes this. To the
traditionalist there is but one Jesus and, as may be seen from the above, the
mystery of Elijah is subsequently sealed against unwelcome attention.
However, those with an analytical mind and a poetic heart would, by
distinguishing between the two Jesuses, resolve this mystery. In this
manner, the authors of Scripture were able to select who would understand
and who would not.
Elijah was foremost among the Old Testament prophets. He came to
Israel at a time of spiritual desolation. In chapter 18 of I Kings he comes at
a time of drought (when the people are without the word of God). In verse
30 he 'repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down' (he set the stone
in the tree). Verses 31-32 read:



210 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the
sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be
thy name:
And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made
a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
The seed, of course, is wisdom. The blessing/naming of the twelve tribes
— zodiac signs — by Jacob in Genesis 49 is prefaced with the words:
And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I
may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.
Elijah, like the Teacher, is without parents. In I Kings 17:1 he predicts a
drought, which is broken in 18: 1. In Revelation 11: 6 there is to be drought
during the time of prophecy by the two witnesses, the Teacher and John the
Baptist. In Luke 4: 25 and James 5: 17 the drought lasts for three and a half
years, the period of Jesus' ministry. In I Kings 17:3 the Lord takes Elijah
into hiding, where he serves an apprenticeship. This is similar to Horus
(associated with Venus, the ruler of Taurus) being brought up in hiding. In
Malachi 4: 5-6 Elijah is, like the Teacher, to precede the coming of the day
of the Lord and the Messianic king.
As mentioned earlier, Malachi 4: 5-6 tells us that God will send Elijah
the prophet. Then in Matthew's gospel (the first book of the New
Testament), at 17:12, King Jesus says of the Teacher:
But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but
have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man
suffer of them.
John the Baptist is to prepare a way in the wilderness. Malachi 3: 1 makes the
distinction between John and Elijah in saying 'Behold, I will send my
messenger, and he shall prepare the way'. Isaiah 40: 3 reads:
The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD,
make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
In Luke 1:17 John will only go 'in the spirit of Elijah'. Thus the



ELIJAH THE TISHBITE 211
three brothers — John, the Teacher (as Elijah) and King Jesus — are sent to point
the way to this new mankind. Hence it is said in Isaiah 51:1:
Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD:
look unto the rock whence ye are hewn...
This rock is the stone of the womb of the Goddess Sarah, and Abraham is her
Taurean husband the Teacher. Hence verse 2 reads:
Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called
him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.
The thirteenth rock reveals truth, and the Teacher's subsequent revelations must
shame the priests of traditional religion when, as Elijah, he repairs the stone altar of
the Lord. Malachi 2:1 says 'And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you'.
Verses 3-4 read:
Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the
dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it.
And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my
covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.
This chapter goes on to say that this Teacher is 'afraid before my name' and that
'the law of truth was in his mouth' and he turned 'many away from iniquity'. The
priests 'should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of
hosts'. Men of religion and academia are, like Judah, said to have dealt treacher
ously with the wife of their youth — the Goddess of the pre-Christian world.
John 16:13-14 reads:
Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all
truth: for he shall not speak of himself: but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall
he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
There can be no doubt that Elijah is yet another form of the Righteousness
Teacher. The countless repetitions of the same theme give



212 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
a clear indication of the necessity of building the image of this messenger,
but more importantly they demonstrate that the surface text was secondary
to the primary concern of conveying the cosmic tree across the age.
A number of theories spring to mind to explain this phenomenon, but
none of them seems worth expounding at this stage. It seems to me that this
repetition of the same simple theme does not weaken but strengthen my
argument. What we have in Scripture is probably the most complex and
sophisticated human endeavour of all time. It will be recalled that we
reached this point with the aid of a few simple keys. I can only presume
that those that would allow us to go further are simply not available to me,
but that is only as it should be.
It is amazing to think that all this points to a moment in future history, a
moment when a near perfect man takes the throne of the world and
inaugurates the Kingdom of God.
These events are described by Nostradamus. Century 4: 30 reads:
The moon will not have the sun above until the time of the eleven.
Then both are increased and lessened in degree.
And put so low that they will sew only little gold:
After famine and plague are decreased the secret will be discovered.
The 'eleven' are the sephiroth in the tree. They are 'put so low' by the
absence of the sun in Pisces. In 4: 31 we read:
The full moon at night over the great mountain,
The wise man with his brain undivided has seen it.
Invited by his disciples to become immortal,
His eyes to the south, his hands and his body amid the fire [the sun?].
The full moon is the lunar thirteenth sign and, as in Daniel, the great
mountain is the cosmic temple. Century 4: 29 reads:
The Sun shall be eclipsed and hidden by Mercury
And shall not set when in the second heaven,
Hermes will be made the prey of Vulcan.
Then the Sun shall be seen pure, shining and golden yellow.
The first line might be loosely translated: The sun wisely hidden, when
found, will give rise to the moon sign. Hermes is the wise



ELIJAH THE TISHBITE 213
young man who makes the discovery. In myth he is the son of Zeus and
Maia (Mary), one of the Pleiades, which are in Taurus. Vulcan is the lord
of fire. In 4: 32 he says:
In the time and place when flesh shall give way to fish
The common will want the law to oppose it.
The old will stand fast and then shall be removed,
Then All Things common among friends will be put aside.
The first line might be translated as saying 'When the physical gives way
to the spiritual'. The last line, as is the case with Nos-tradamus's letter to the
Teacher, refers to the end of communism. The 'common' who want the law
to stop or ban the outrage of the Teacher's revelation are those who are
Gentile at heart.
In Century 1: 8 Nostradamus speaks of the Great King's capture of
Jerusalem:
How often shall you be taken, O city of the sun? Changed by vain and
barbaric laws. Evil times are near. But you shall be freed from slavery.
Great Adrie will revive your veins.
In the following verse 'the heirs of Romulus' are the Church; the lion is
the sun, identifiable as a star and the Teacher:
From the Orient will come the lion heart To disturb Adrie and the heirs
of Romulus. Accompanied by the Libyans
The temples of Malta shall tremble and the nearby islands shall be
deserted.
The Libyan connection translates: Out of Egypt I called my son.
I shall show later that the Great King is French; given this, it is probably
more than coincidence that Nostradamus was also French.
We are looking at events that cover a period of something in excess of
forty years. During this time a new world will be born. The people who
from the beginning saw these events were poets, and they have exploited
every mythical and legendary prospect. Seeing as we do now, it is as
though we have been unaware of the sacred ground upon which the whole
world has been walking.



214 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Conclusion
I have produced yet more evidence relating characters of the Bible to the Teacher.
But two very important specific points were made. Firstly, we saw that the method
of hiding the Bible's secrets was, though simple, an effective way of leaving them
open to the poet. Thus it is not until we separate the two Jesuses that we can
identify Elijah.
Secondly, we saw that, in an opposite manner to this, right there in the surface
text of John's Revelation, Jesus himself tells us that he is not divine. But then, of
course, this would never be seen by those determined that he was the divine son of
God and, in fact, God Himself. This raises some wonderful questions about reality
and human capacity to perceive it. What we are seeing is pure and unadulterated
cabala.
The quotation from Malachi on page 211 raises an extremely important point.
Seen from a traditional and historical perspective, central to Essenism was the belief
that they possessed the only accurate calendar, which permitted the observance of
the true sabbath day and the celebration of religious festivals at their proper times.
Because of the absence of this diligence among other celebrants, God despised and
ignored their petitions. Subsequently, this calendar is central to the Teacher's
revelation.
The luni-solar calendar of the Essenes is known to be incorporated within the
pseudepigraphic Book of Jubilees; in Appendix III it is shown to underly the text of
the Bible. Setting aside all other evidence, this is very substantial proof of
Scripture's Essene origins. Furthermore, the fact that universal time should have
been measured with such pinpoint accuracy tells us that the calendar in use in the
ancient world was commensurate with the known sophistication of its astronomy.
Another point of significance is that, though some of us may find the idea that our
ancient ancestors were time travellers absolutely laughable, they themselves went to
a great deal of trouble to put into place the scientific means by which this might be
achieved.
It seems to me that if, as individuals, we do nothing other than accept that
present-day mankind is but an inferior shadow of its former self, we shall at least
have given ourselves the opportunity to conceive that improvement is plausible. In
the mean time we shall achieve nothing while our minds are imprisoned by
preconception. Letting go of the 'idols of the heart' is all we need do to be set free.
But freedom is threatening and slavery is a form of security. On this principle, the
publisher's promotion of this book would probably be best done on the basis that it
offers two idols — Jesuses — for the price of one. The Thirteenth Stone gives you
more Jesus for your dollar than any known religion. Buy one, get one free!
Miserable mortals, open your eyes and see what they are doing to you.

The Bible as Cabala
We have come to think of paganism as being generally opposed to
Christianity. The latter presents us with a relatively simple doctrine of
monotheism, which in reality is pantheistic. From the cult of Jehovah to the
countless saints that exist in effigy in the Catholic Church to the idolatry of
Jesus, its orientation is obvious. This is in direct contradiction to Exodus
20: 4. One should also include churches named for Mary, Joseph, the
Baptist, the Magdalene, the Apostles etc. The Bible is clearly a pagan
document and it insists on one God as pure spirit. It has through time been
watered down to a teaching within everyone's grasp. It is this basic
predisposition toward simplicity that allowed the gospel to spread so fast.
The pagan world in which Christianity was spawned is seen as having a
great pantheon of gods. There was a vast angelology and astronomy, and
other complex and mysterious methods of comprehending creation such as
numerology, in which every number becomes sacred. The Creator is
perceived to be a mathematician and geometer who manifested creation
through sound and number.
This system is exclusive, and clearly only accessible to a very specific
type of individual. Behind this philosophy, of which Plato and Pythagoras
were great exponents, lies the idea of dualism. Basically, within this
thinking, all things are manifest in opposites. The Creator becomes both the
male and female, the Self-Begetting, and the universe is seen to pass
constantly through light and dark. These would be more accurately
described as 'out and in', the pro-creative action of friction that generates
fire, the sun, which is the life force of our world. All things must, on the
minutest scale, be a reflection of the macrocosm.
Christianity has in the past done all in its power to eradicate this
thinking, which it regards as the ultimate heresy. However, it is now known
and accepted that, though pantheistic in appearance, paganism rested upon
belief in a single Supreme Being. The complexities of this body of thinking
are such that it could never become a religion: it is an exclusive science.
But it is no more exclusive than any other such discipline.
As we have seen, the documents on which Christianity is founded are
pagan; they were a response to changing circumstances. The



216 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
world was to be turned upside down. The earth would go through a dark
period. This was a phase in universal copulation and creation. The
subduing of the female was also a surrender on her part. This activity
would bring forth fruit. But in our age men would no longer be guided by
knowledge: they would turn to the Dark and there would be rebellion in
heaven.
But this paganism, founded on what it terms gnosis, has proved far more
persistent an adversary than the modern religions could ever have
imagined. Through our era some of the very great minds have proved to
have been adherents of this general philosophy, which Christianity insists is
the teaching of Satan himself. It is for this reason that secret societies were
formed. But, even so, the science itself was so complex as to deter the
masses anyway. This mystical doctrine came already well equipped with
the needs of such associations. Not least of these tools were the various
systems within the philosophy which allowed the conversion of letters and
numbers, and provided hidden means of communication. Outwardly these
organizations and individuals appeared to be devoutly Christian, which in
fact they were. What we have witnessed in the last two thousand years is a
macrocosmic populist people's revolution in which the aristocracy has been
overthrown. The king from the house of David is the return of the crown:
government being set in competent hands. We might say that the
Communist 'people's revolution' in Russia was a microcosm of the events
of our age, an era of godlessness and lawlessness, a situation which could
only end in chaos.
Out of the Diaspora — along with the gospels, which went in one
direction — there came Rabbinic Judaism, which in most respects was as
new as Christianity. This other new religion, theoretically based on the five
books of Moses, gathered about itself from its very learned priesthood a
vast body of writings which was constantly being augmented. The most
familiar of these is the Talmud, particularly the Zohar, 'book of lights'.
Even the Jewish calendar of sabbaths and festivals was fixed as late as
359 CE, by Hillel II. But then the concept of a Christian era beginning at
Anno Domini 1 was established by Dionysius even later, in 532 CE. The
fact is that the claim to antiquity made by Judaism and Christianity simply
cannot be substantiated.
The Talmud has given rise to what is termed cabala (received or oral
doctrine). It is in this system that we find the emasculated tree and the
attendant theosophy. Just as we find transitional teaching



THE BIBLE AS CABALA 217
and thinking in Christianity, the same is the case with Judaism. In this
instance, it was the concept of the Throne Chariot (the fiery wheels of
Ezekiel) which was suppressed. To add further confusion to these issues,
there is little doubt that the discoveries begun in 1947 in the region of the
Dead Sea were not the first.
The secret doctrine was strengthened by groups like the Templars,
Bugars, Illuminati, Rosicrucians and Cathars. Many of these societies still
exist in one form or another, though largely impotent and lost in a mire of
astrology and self-help psychology. They often promote an execrable ritual
magic which only serves to raise the demons of the mind.
Modern Western cabalism is largely based on a tiny book, the Sepher
Yetzirah (Book of Emanations), also known as the Book of Abraham. Very
likely it is derived and interpreted from a scroll found in a cave by the Dead
Sea about a thousand years ago. The Qumran magi are said to have
worshipped the sun. The Scrolls, as I have said, are known to be cabalistic
documents containing ciphers and codes.
In preparing this text, my primary concern has been to minimize the
complexities of our subject; nevertheless it is necessary to demonstrate the
existence of numerology and ciphers in the Bible. I further intend to show
that, by the use of sacred geometry, we may find the cosmic tree within
those enigmatic writings.
The Essenes, I have argued, were responsible for the production of the
Scriptures and the Scrolls alike. It would be foolish to assume that all this
was done at the monastery at Qumran until it was attacked and destroyed in
68 CE by Romans. These magi are known to have been scattered in
communities as far away as Egypt and throughout the vast area surrounding
Palestine. It is extremely likely that even the Scrolls themselves were
produced throughout the Holy Land — and in Egypt also. If legend is to be
believed, they had contact with the Druid priests of Western Europe and
Britain. Qumran and Masada are only significant as places where Essene
documents have been found and where they made a last stand against
Rome. The time and resources required to produce all sixty-six books of the
Bible were clearly at their disposal.
As mentioned earlier, in the 1920s and 1930s a Russian mathematician
called Ivan Panin discovered what he termed the numerics of Scripture.
Using the vast cycles of numerology to prove his text, he edited the
Numeric New Testament.23 Panin knew nothing of the cabala and
approached the matter from the point of view that the



218 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
vast patterns of numbers which run from Genesis through to Revelation
were evidence of divine inspiration.
Not one word in all sixty-six books of Scripture can be changed without
altering or breaking the existing tapestry. From the first verse of Genesis,
'In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth', I was able, some
years ago, to extract five tightly-packed foolscap pages of numerology.
These codes are replete with references to trees. This exhausted me long
before I exhausted it. Even the names of all the supposed authors fit into
complex patterns which run from Moses to John. It very quickly becomes
apparent that whoever wrote the books of Moses had to know exactly what
was going into the Revelation of John. He did, in fact, have to consider
what was going into all the other books. All sixty-six of them must have
been written in conjunction with each other.
Panin devoted a lifetime to this study, and produced numerous papers. In
one, he demonstrated that the named biblical authors, from Moses, Esther
and Solomon through to Matthew and John, produce complex patterns of
numbers which bind the Old and New Testaments together (see Appendix
I). In the absence of miracles and the presence of pagan cabalism — which
I believe I have demonstrated — the construction of the Bible as one book
produced at one time is irrefutable. Thus, the idea that it is an historical
document is obviously complete nonsense. Of course I accept that this is a
difficult concept for many to grasp, but we need to understand that
Scripture is not a random collection of writings: it was built with the same
complexity and genius that was applied to the Great Pyramid. It is, quite
simply, a mathematical wonder.
All the named authors, such as Moses, Matthew and Paul, are pure
fiction. Any question as to their independent authorship is now null and
void. Any discussion as to whether books such as Isaiah and Luke may
have been later added to becomes pointless. It can be said with complete
confidence that only scholarship of the type indicated by this work is now
of any value. It is clear that there is not even the slightest element of history
in all sixty-six books of Scripture. Jesus the god-made-flesh is obviously
totally mythological. There can now be absolutely no doubt that the entire
text was produced by those people we call Essenes. Quite simply, with the
numerology that binds Scripture, if we were only certain of one book
having its origins among them then we would have to accept that they all
came from that source.
And all this is not to say that something has been destroyed. On



THE BIBLE AS CABALA 219
the contrary, a truth has been discovered and a damaging falsehood laid to
rest. It is truth such as this that provides a sure foundation and a real hope
for the future. If men were to tear down every church and temple on earth,
the reality of God would not be diminished by one iota. We would, in fact,
only draw closer to Him. It would be a pity to see this new evidence as
negative and destructive when, in reality, it has enormous potential for
creativity.
There can be no suggestion that the Scriptures have been a vast
deception. In an age of potential chaos they have brought order and
continuity. Their legacy guarantees mankind's future hopes and aspirations.
Inasmuch as they are based on science rather than religion, they are
exclusive only in the sense that that science is highly technical. And even
so, they do not exclude the simple soul who loves God and desires to live
within the laws of creation. For this reason we may see in the biblical Jesus,
as aspects of the Teacher, not only an extremely wise man, but a gentle,
meek and loving one who chooses the company of simple folk, a man who
teaches both the power of knowledge and the incomparable power of love.
Such truths are not diminished but increased by our understanding of the
true nature of these writings. And, surely, God would not have made things
otherwise.
There can be absolutely no question that the Scriptures were specifically
consigned to the latter-day Revealer of All God's Mysteries. His task is to
translate and consign them to the New Israel. The contents have the power
to enliven the good and plague the wicked, such was the method of
construction.
Before we may see examples of this numerology, we shall repeat its basis
in more detail. Panin says:
NOTE In the following Papers it is intended to make upon the reader the
smallest possible demands beyond an ordinary High School education. But a few
explanations of some terms will prove useful.
Place Values, Numeric Values, and Values.
The Bible is written in Hebrew for the Old Testament and Greek for the New.
These languages are the only ones known to the writer that have this peculiarity:
All the letters of the alphabet are used also for numbers. [Hence any word, verse,
chapter and book of Scripture can be read both as words and as a series of
numbers. Within this cabalistic system number codes are valid within the area of
one neighbouring number. This is



220 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Thus the letters have for their numeric values 10, 8, 200,
70, 400, 200. As their sum is 888, and they spell Jesus, the numeric value of the
Greek for Jesus is 888. The sum of the numeric values of its letters is that of the
word they make up. The sum of the numeric values of its words is that of the
sentence, paragraph, section or book formed by them.
In addition to its numeric value every Greek letter has also its Place Value, the
place from 1 to 24 it holds in the alphabet. The first letter thus has a place value of
1; the second of 2; the last of 24. The place value of Jesus is thus the sum of the
place values 9, 7, 18, 15, 20, 18; or 87. The place value of a sentence, paragraph,
section or book is thus the place value of the sum of the words formed of which
they are made up.
The sum of the place value and the numeric is the value of the word. Thus the
value of Jesus is 888 and 87, or 975. The value of a sentence is the sum of the place
and numeric values of its words, or simply of the values of its words.
Chance and Design.
The NUMERIC VALUE of Jesus Christ is 2,368; of which Jesus has 888, and Christ has
1,480. Now
2,368 is 37 x 8 x 8 888 is 37 x 8 x 3
1,480 is 37 x 8 x 5
called 'colel'.] The 24 Greek letters stand therefore for the following Numbers



THE BIBLE AS CABALA 221
This numeric value, 2,368, itself 37 x 8 x 8, is divided between Jesus and
Christ by 37 x 8; of which Jesus has 3, and Christ 5. This of course may be a
mere coincidence, undesigned. But the chance for this being so is one in 37 x 37
x 8 x 8 x 8 or 1,369 x 512, or one in 700,928; a small chance indeed, but not
sufficient for the present purpose to establish design here.
But this numeric value 2,368 is further divided thus: The vowels have 568; of
which Jesus has 488, and Christ has 80. The consonants have 1,800; of which
Jesus has 400, and Christ has 1,400.
Vowels 568, or 8 x 71 Consonants 1,800, or 8 x 25 x 9
Jesus 488, or 8 x 61 Jesus 400, or 8 x 25 x 2
Christ 80, or 8 x 2 x 5 Christ 1,400, or 8 x 25 x 7
These divisions are not only by 8, but in the Consonants it is even by 8 x 25 or
200.
As the chance for these additional numerics is one i n 8 x 8 x 8 x 2 x 2 x 25 x
25, the chance of one in 700,928 obtained above is reduced 1,280,000 times to
896,000,000,000, to some 900 billions, ample for establishing design here.
The above is a good example of one of the methods by which the science of
BIBLE NUMERICS secures its results.
The presence of a numeric design in the Greek of Jesus Christ is not a mere
curiosity: it brings at once certainty into what had hitherto been conjecture and
disputation: The Seventy translators of the Old Testament rendered the Hebrew
Jehoshua, originally Yaishua, by JESUS, Iehsous. The name could have been
transliterated a dozen other ways. But they hit upon the one form which not only
produces with Christ a scheme of 37 x 8, but which gives for the Savior 888,
where the name of His Satanic counterpart is 666.
All discussion therefore as to whether other transliterations might not be as
proper, if not more so, is henceforth shut out. The present Greek form for Jesus
was meant to be just this — designed.
But this design tells more: The Seventy made their translation some 280 years
before the Lord Jesus was born. They could not have known that the Messiah's
name would be the Hebrew Joshua.
Here I must respectfully disagree with Mr Panin. The authors of Scripture not
only knew the name, they in fact constructed it — with one specific purpose. As we
progress we shall see that 'Jesus Christ' was plainly and simply a vehicle to carry
one of the prominent sacred measures of the temple. The Jesus Christ of the
Philistines may well come as the ruler of the world, but only as a



222 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
ruler to measure it. The beliefs that Scripture generated were essential to its
survival among primitive beasts, but its actual content has no relationship at
all to those beliefs. Our cargo cult Christianity has involuntarily preserved
the cargo. As for the number 8, it is very persistent in general myth. I am
personally satisfied that it is a direct reference to the octave. Panin goes on
to say:
Spelling of David, Oziah, and Josiah. (Matt. i. 1,8,11)
DAVID is given in the Received Text as Dabid. The oldest manuscripts followed
by the critical editors (Lachman, Tischendorff, Tregelles, Alford, and Westcott
and Hort) have Daveid. Griesbach alone has it David, the form
given in the Greek Seventy: If memory is not at fault here, Josephus has it
adding a Greek ending to whatever was to him the
Hebrew form. The confusion as to David and Dabid is thus of early origin. In the
Introduction to the Greek Numeric Testament different methods were given of
establishing David as the true spelling. Till some two years ago these methods,
laborious and exhausting, had to be followed ever since 1890. But in about 1933
it was found that every single sentence carries its own evidence as to the purity of
its text; but the fact that even demonstrably false readings also show numerics at
times had always to be reckoned with; and a short, easy, yet conclusive method
remained till recently the indispensable desideratum. This by God's grace has
been vouchsafed to the editor only recently while revising the proof-sheets of this
English Testament. This method is the Cross-section method of the Greek New
Testament Vocabulary exemplified below, setting beyond possible question
spellings like
The New Testament Vocabulary, as established by Bible numerics, has 5,304
words. The editor had known for some time that the words beginning the
thousands 1,001, 2,001, 3,001, 4,001, and 5,001 displayed elaborate design. It
occurred to him to test suspected words similarly by their place in the alphabet.
Every case so far examined of words ending in for possibly or vice versa,
has thus been cleared up; and the cases of David, Oziah, and Josiah fall in with
those so far tested.
Here are five words of which David is one whose only bond is that their order
number in the New Testament vocabulary ends in 124, each distant 1,000 words
from the other. Their Vocabulary Order Numbers, Place Values, Numeric Values,
and Values precede; the numbers of their occurrences in the New Testament
follow them:



THE BIBLE AS CABALA 223
Value 5,172 is 431 x 12 or 2 x 2 x 3 x 431
Place 430 is (431)-1 or 2 x 5 x 43
Numeric 4,742 is (431 x 11)" or 2 x 2,371
This division is (indirectly, by neighborhood) by 431, with a chance of one in
431 x 431 x 4 or 743,044.
The sum of the figures of the place values is forty-three. The entire place value
is 430, or 10 forty-threes. Two words begin and end with a consonant, David and
face. They divide the sum 430 thus:
David, face, have 172 or 43 x 2 x 2 The others have 258 or 43 x 2 x 3
This division is by 2 forty-threes. And as 430 is (11 x 13 x 3)+1, schemes of
elevens and thirteens also run through the place value, 430, which the reader may
readily find for himself. As the chance, however, for the three features of 43 is
one in 43 x 43 x 43, or 79,507, the chance for the 431 above and these 43's is now
only one in 743,044 x 70,507 or 55,000,000,000, ample to prove design; but
possible only with David, rather than Daveid.
These numerics prove not only the spelling of David, they give also certainty,
thus:
(1) The numbers 1,124-5,124 are the places for the words placed against them.
(2) Middle and passive verbs, of which the active is not found in the New
Testament, must not appear in the Vocabulary as active verbs. The change from
to in 'be transformed' destroys the design. As not a single Greek
dictionary is constructed on that principle, Bible numerics enables the
construction of a scientific Vocabulary to the New Testament, if not indeed to any
other Greek (or Hebrew) work.
In the Introduction to the Greek Testament the spelling David was
demonstrated in three other (more laborious) ways. And it was there said that
Ozias and Josias are the true forms in the Greek against Ozeias and Joseias of the
oldest manuscripts and best editors. This same short method applied to these two
words confirms the spelling obtained by the previous longer methods.



224 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
To supplement the Greek alphabet above, I offer here for the keen
student the numerical values of the Hebrew alphabet.
The shape and the number value of a letter are altered when, as a final, it appears
at the end of a word.
The next question to be asked is what is all this for? In City of
Revelation we have a demonstration of sacred geometry in Scripture,
and in this instance we see that the numbers are specific measures.
On page 114 John Michell explains:
The Literary Canon: 153 Fishes in the Net
'Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred
and fifty and three' (John 21:11).
Why there should have been exactly 153 fishes in the net is a question which
has puzzled commentators from the earliest time. Obviously the



THE BIBLE AS CABALA 225
number had an esoteric significance, and by reference to the sacred canon of
number and geometry this may be discovered. The parables and many of the
episodes in the New Testament form the literary expressions of geometrical
processes. This is particularly clear in the case of the 153 fishes. The key is the
number 1224, which is the value by gematria of both the net, and
fishes. 1224 is equal to 8 times 153, and 153 is the sum of the numbers 1
17.
He continues:
1. Seven disciples are on the shore of Tiberias. Simon Peter enters a boat to go
fishing; the others follow.
The number of Simon Peter, is 1925. A circle is there
fore drawn with circumference 1925 to represent Peter, and six more circles are
placed so that the circumference of each passes through the center of the first
circle and also through the centers of the two on either side. A large circle
contains them all. In this most economical fashion the seven disciples are packed
into the circular boat, like the coracle of the Celtic saints, which, since the
circumference of the lesser circles is 1925, will be found to have a diameter of
1224.
On page 116 he writes:
Numerology of 1224 (1224 = the net = fishes)
Like all the important cabalistic numbers, 1224 has correspondences both in
gematria and in the ratios of metrology. The significance of this number as a
symbol of the perfect creation may be inferred from the following examples:
1224 = the Lord God.
1224 = God's creation.
1224 = the Plantation, an early Christian synonym of
Paradise (see J. Danielou, Primitive Christian Symbols, Chapter 2).
1225 = God's paradise.
1225 = literally One Whole of Wholes, Plato's phrase in
Timaeus for the one, unique cosmic sphere embracing all its parts.
In Revelation 21, the total values of the names of the twelve foundation stones
is three short of 12,240. The phrase the twelve
foundation stones, has the value 1222.
1225 is the sum of all the first 49 numerals, and is therefore the number of the
magic square of Venus, which consists of the numbers 1-49



226 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
arranged on a square block 7 x 7 , each line, column and diagonal amounting to
175. The number 153 has a similar property, being the sum of the numbers 1-17.
In common with all the principal numbers of the cosmic temple, 1224 is divisible
by both 6 and 9, and 1224 or 1225 may be divided by all the first 10 numerals.
The goddess who is Lucifer, Venus or Aphrodite is 2448.
The number 1224 and its multiple 2448 have the following properties in the
numerology of measures.
2448 megalithic yards = 6660 feet
= 1500 MY + 1500 cubits = 3520 + 352 cubits
2448 feet = 900 MY
2449 = 6,000,000
As an astronomical number, 12,240 is the number of miles in the earth's
diameter together with two diameters of the moon (7920 + 2160 + 2160). It is
therefore the width of the cosmological city.
He continues on page 115:
2. That night they caught nothing. In the morning they saw the resur
rected Jesus on the shore, but failed to recognize him. He said to them,
'Cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find.' They did so
and made a great catch.
The act of casting a net from the side of a boat is described by placing the
compass point on the circumference of the circle of the boat and drawing the arc
of another circle, which contains the vesica piscis, the 'fish.' The diameter of this
circle is also 1224, the number of the net, and fishes.
3. 'Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fish
er's coat unto him (for he was naked), and did cast himself into the sea.'
The arc of a third circle is drawn to the left of the boat, and Simon Peter is
moved from the centre of the boat into the sea between the boat and the shore.
The vesica that contains him represents the fisher's coat, for the Greek word is
1060, and since the width of this vesi
ca is 612, its height is 1060.
And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land,
but as it were two hundred cubits) dragging the net with fishes.' In the net were
153 great fishes.
The net, 1224, with fishes, 1224, together number 2448, and 2448 is the
measure, round the perimeter of the 'fish' in the net. This great fish is divided into
sixteen equal parts, forming the tetraktys of the



THE BIBLE AS CABALA 227
Pythagoreans. The number 153 is brought out in two ways. First, the width of
each of the sixteen lesser fish is 153; then there are sixteen smaller making up
one greater fish, seventeen in all, and 153 is the sum of the numbers 1-17.
The disciples are said to be 200 cubits from land. The Greek cubit or ell, made
up of 25 digits, was a length of about 18 1/4 inches, which may be 1.52 or 1.53
feet. 200 cubits is therefore equal to about 306 feet, and 306 is the radius or
distance from centre to circumference of the circles that represent the disciples.
Stories such as this were composed to illustrate a secret doctrine, orally
transmitted, to which we no longer have direct access, but which may to some
extent be inferred through the contemplation of its symbols. The three
intersecting circles produce the diagram of Hebrew mysticism, the Tree of Life,
1625, identified by its number with the tetraktys, 1626,
the corresponding symbol in the Greek system. In the final episode of the 153
fishes, the disciples come to land and there is Jesus with a fire of coals and a fish
laid upon it and bread. Fire, fish and bread represent the three worlds united in
the cabalistic tree, the creative essences of the upper world and the material body
of the lower being linked by the mercurial spirit of the fish.
The Bible uses Numbers chapter 2 as a basis for the layout of the
camp (temple/tree), and it goes on to define the astronomical pos
itions of the tribes in Genesis 49. The special significance of Ephraim as
Coma (an ox) is given in Hosea 10:11, which reads:
And Ephraim is an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn
(wisdom)...
The more intricate details of the measures for the building of the
cosmic temple are then set out in numerous other scriptures. These
are the purpose of and fundamental reason for the existence of the
Bible.
The above material is of a highly specialized nature. Hence I have
provided two appendices with further evidence from Ivan Panin.
Conclusion
We have here seen unequivocal evidence that the Bible is primarily cabala, which
makes its Essene origins certain. That this numerology should, through geometry,
produce the tree of life makes our argument complete



228 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
and unassailable. On these principles alone, we have to accept that the individual in
the Scrolls who reveals mysteries must reveal these types of mysteries, and do so at
the end rather than the beginning of our age. It may well be argued that the
existence of this numerology is evidence of the Bible's divine inspiration. In this
case we need accept that the Creator is philosophically cabalistic and His
sympathies must lie with paganism. Furthermore, if this is the case then we must
think of the Dead Sea Scrolls as equally divinely inspired, and there is no question
as to their pagan origin.
This material conclusively proves our modern world religions bankrupt. In
hindsight, it is interesting to note that for some, even the system of codification
(numerology) was thought to prove the accuracy of their concocted beliefs. God is
pure spirit; His book speaks only to the spirit. It reveals, as should be expected, the
mysteries of hidden realms. In fulfilment of the prophecy, the wise have within
them a spirit of truth, and they understand. The wicked have a spirit of perversity
and do not hear the voice of God. This is the two-edged sword which the Teacher
will bring into the world.
It is abundantly clear that whatever has been practised by Judaism and
Christianity has absolutely nothing to do with the Bible. If that book should now be
taken up and claimed by the pagan heretics that the Church has tried to destroy,
there should, in theory, be no grounds for complaint. The simple process by which
the true claimants take up their heritage will be an act by which traditional
scholarship will be shown to be empty and vain.. It is then that we shall see why the
biblical Jesus regards these Scribes and Pharisees with such disdain. From what I
have seen, these self-proclaimed authorities have laboured diligently and craftily to
earn this abuse, and will be recompensed in full.
Finally, inasmuch as this evidence conclusively links the Bible to the Scrolls
community, it proves beyond doubt that Jesus and the Teacher are one and the
same. Not to my credit, but to the shame of the official body of academics working
on the Qumran documents since shortly after their discovery, we have achieved our
objective with relative simplicity.
Professor Thompson's discovery that there was no first Temple means, as we
now see, that the first Temple period in Scripture is now the second. The second
Temple period then becomes the time immediately preceding the New Jerusalem.
This fully harmonizes with my argument.
Ultimately, as has been demonstrated, the primary role of 'Jesus Christ' lay in his
name, for it enshrined the number 2368, which is primary in measuring the temple.
While Jesus Christ lived in idolatrous hearts, the measure of the temple was secure.



Book III



14
Jesus in the Americas
Sumer was mother to the later great civilizations; the arts and sciences as
we know them began with her. She is thus the great-grandmother of our
modern world, but her origins are shrouded in mystery. As I have already
said, Sumerian civilization shows little sign of evolution. Written language,
a vast and sophisticated astronomy, a classic architecture and much more
had an amazing rate of development. Far more mysterious is that the
founders of Sumer were not indigenous, or so it seems.
The same applies to the later Egypt, whose first empire was not of local
making. The second empire, no doubt, was a native effort to relive the
nation's former greatness. Here we find the building of inferior pyramids
and the beginning of their use as tombs.
Later still we see the very brief blossoming of the Hebrews, the flower of
this civilization being its Scriptures.
Legend has it that, after the dispersal of 70 CE, quite possibly many of
the Essenes moved east into India and China and there wielded
considerable influence over religion and civilization. This is supported by
writings such as the Acts of Thomas.
In South America, a very likely alien people established the great
civilizations that were later inherited by the Maya, Inca and Aztec peoples.
Tradition has it that these were preceded by the Olmecs. Some have
suggested a Sumerian contact with the Americas. Perhaps coincidentally,
the Maya knew the Goddess by the name of Ix Tub Tun, which literally
means 'She who spits out sacred stones'. Further, it is now known that
temples such as that at Teotihacan in Mexico were built to enshrine the
same sacred measures as are shown in the preceeding section of this book.
On August 3 of 1492 Cristobal Colon (Christopher Columbus), a Spanish
Sephard, sailed for the Americas. Subsequently, in 1493, Pope Alexander
VI divided the New World between Spain and Portugal. In the following
year this was ratified in the Treaty of Tordasillas. In 1519 Hernando Cortes
arrived at what is now the city of Veracruz. To his great astonishment the
Aztec ruler Moctezuma did not send warriors but gifts, including a solid
gold calendar the size of a wagon wheel, a much larger disk made of pure
silver, a pot or helmet filled with grain gold, and a headdress made of the



232 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
plumes of the quetzal bird. To the amazement of the emissaries, Cortes
thanked them by slaughtering them.
It happened that the god Quetzalcouatl, having been forced to depart
eastward of the Americas by the god of war, promised he would return
upon the wings of a great bird in the year 1 Reed, according to the local
calendar. In a fifty-two year cycle, this co-incidentally fell in 1519. Further
it was believed, amid a nation of dark-skinned people, that this plumed
serpent god hero, bringer of wisdom, would be white. For this reason
white-skinned Cortes was greeted as his emissary.
According to some legends, the founders of South American civilization
were the Toltecs, who learned the art of gold refining and smithing from
Quetzalcouatl. Gold is a symbol of the sun, and it was believed to be the
excreta or creation of this deity.
Like the founders of Sumer and Egypt, the Toltecs came in the ancient
past, established civilization, and were gone. The local people had only
lived in their image. They amassed enormous quantities of gold but did not
use it for trade: it was for religious purposes only.
In The Lost Realms24 Zecharia Sitchin says (pages 23-24) that Spanish
chroniclers of the time tried to counteract the embarrassment of the positive
impressions cast by the beliefs of what should have been American
savages. They attributed to Cortes a reprimand to Moctezuma for
worshipping idols and evilly named demons, an evil influence which
Cortes wanted to counteract when he offered to construct, on top of a
pyramid, a shrine with a cross and the image of the Virgin Mary (Historia
verdadera). But to the astonishment of the Spaniards, the symbol of the
cross was already known to the Aztecs as the emblem on Quetzalcoatl's
shield. Furthermore, despite the pantheon of deities, there was undoubtedly
an underlying belief in a Supreme God.
Sitchin goes on to point out that the only accusation of barbarity made
against the Aztecs which had any substance — the offering of still pulsating
human hearts as sacrifices to Huitzilopochtli — was a practice dating back
only to 1486. Sitchin has recognized that the great anomaly of this
civilization was that it existed as a veneer covering a primitive
understructure and hence that it might have been imported and
superimposed.
Mayan art often depicts the eagle consuming human hearts. I have
already pointed out that the eagle is a symbol for Scorpio, which is found to
be the false thirteenth sign. Likewise it may be



JESUS IN THE AMERICAS 233
said to symbolize a false Israel and a false Messiah, who could well be
allegorized as an eagle consuming men's hearts. It thus seems reasonable to
argue that the more literal Piscean inheritors of the legend may well have
gleefully indulged themselves in actual human sacrifice, as did their
counterparts across the Atlantic when they burned heretics for Jesus. This
is easily understood if we see the earth as a spot of consciousness in an
ocean of thought. The earth, and we as part of it, are continually
bombarded by both positive and negative influences. That new inventions
often emerge simultaneously in diverse places is a good example of this.
The people of South America used the wheel in children's toys but
lacked the wit to adapt it for transportation. They held religiously to
calendars of massive complexity and sophistication which they themselves
most likely did not fully understand. Their god Quetzalcouatl was as real
and historical for them as Jesus and Arthur are to our culture. What the
Spaniards found was, in fact, a shadow civilization living in the glory of its
ancient past.
In precisely the same way as the authors of the Bible, the ancient priests
of South America played a game with time, setting the future in the past. In
The Mayan Prophecies,25 Adrian G. Gilbert and Maurice M. Cotterell point
out that, for the Maya, our age began on 12 August 3114 BCE and will end
in cataclysm on 22 December 2012 CE. The Maya are renowned for their
'long count' calendar, the extraordinary detail of their prognostications and
their sophisticated astronomy. Yet to my knowledge no commentator has
seen that, until the destruction of their civilization by Europeans, they were
being subjected to the same forces as everyone else. When they, along with
the rest of us, entered a time of insanity, they went into decline. The great
mystery of this people is that, having reached the pinnacle of their
creativity at around 600 CE, they then withdrew and disappeared.
The pattern throughout the world is that priestly societies appear and then
leave behind a piece of the puzzle that comprises the alchemical sciences.
These are obviously intended to be obscure and unseen until the Teacher
comes to gather them in the new age. But equally important is the message
that they would have each and every one of us understand. Interestingly,
there is a fast-growing volume of information, intelligently produced by
sensible people using all the power of contemporary media, which presents
overwhelming evidence of a dying world, yet nobody seems to be
perturbed. But here, too, natural selection is at work. Those who



234 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
cannot anticipate long-term danger — who are existential in their reactions
— will be overwhelmed when that danger arrives.
As Mayan civilization faded, the less sophisticated Mexica (Aztecs)
were led from the fabled Aztlan to Mexico in the thirteenth century by their
very own Moses — a prophet called Tenoch who told the people he would
recognize the promised land when he saw an eagle fighting with a serpent.
The eagle, as has been said, is a symbol for Scorpio, the supposed or false
thirteenth sign and false Messiah. The serpent is the sun (Star/Teacher)
which gives rise to the real stone of destiny and the true Messiah, who kills
the false one. Coincidentally, the eagle is the national emblem of the
United States. Or is that a coincidence?
The legend of Quetzalcouatl emerged among the Toltecs, whose capital
and cultural centre was Tollon. The authors of The Mayan Prophecies say
(page 9) that the name Toltec' refers to artists or builders (perhaps builders
in stone). Tradition has it that Quetzalcouatl sacrificed certain gods to
smooth the path of the sun through the sky, and this is exactly what the
Teacher must do.
Again, in The Mayan Prophecies (pages 71-72) the authors relate the
legend of the four ages as found in the Vatico-Latin Codex. They are four
separate anecdotes, whose purpose becomes immediately obvious:
In the time of Matlactili, the age of flood known as Apiachio-hualiztli,
the sun was destroyed by rain and inundation, and men became fishes (the
Piscean age). The only couple to survive this disaster were Nene and Tata.
They were protected by an old tree living by the water (the word of God).
In the time of Ehecatl, men were turned into monkeys in order that they
might cling to trees for survival. Daniel 4: 16 says man would be given the
heart of a beast. This occurred in the year 1 Dog, and the only human
couple to survive did so by standing on a rock.
In the Tleyquiyahuillo time, men lived by eating a special fruit called
Tzincoacoc.
In the time called Tzontlilac ('black hair', equivalent to other concepts of
our present, black, iron age) mankind starved to death after a rain of blood
and fire.
The Mayan tree of knowledge was the Ceiba tree, which, instead of fruit,
had 400,000 nipples. Obviously it provided the special fruit in the form of
breast milk from the Goddess Mayahuel.
The authors of The Mayan Prophecies also investigate (pages 118-120)
the research done by Jose Diaz Bolio, who believes that



JESUS IN THE AMERICAS 235
the rattlesnake Crotalus durissus durissus, known to the Maya as Ahau
Can, played a significant part in the development of the art and geometry of
the Maya because of the paired square design on its back. There can be no
question as to the general significance of the snake as a solar symbol of
wisdom and subsequently as a phallic object paired with the vagina of the
Goddess of the thirteenth stone. But the rattlesnake is known for its
warning rattle before it strikes. This could have been utilized as a symbol
for a messenger from God giving a warning before He strikes.
Jose Diaz Bolio also puts forward the theory that the Quetzal-couatl
legends are a later development of the god Zamna of the city of Izamac. He
was a serpent deity portrayed with his mouth open in speech, as though he
were a prophet. He was, by tradition, the father and teacher of all wisdom.
On a visit to Mexico, Adrian Gilbert found that the Aztecs had a
particular fascination for the Pleiades in Taurus (page 38), which the Maya
called Tzab, meaning rattle. Because of the calendar they had inherited,
these people expected the end of the world every fifty-two years. On these
occasions they held the festival of new fire (the new sun in the tree). The
omen depicting the end was the failure of the Pleiades to cross the zenith,
which they invariably did; and, when they did, new fires were lit. This is
clearly a garbled version of the Teacher coming down from Taurus with the
new sun and giving the warning rattle. Gilbert and Cotterell say (page 135)
that Zamna was the prototype of all the later gods, particularly
Quetzalcouatl, who was linked with the Pleiades in Taurus. Likewise the
Egyptians saw the Nile as a replica of the Milky Way, which may be said to
be the water which is the fertilizing spermatozoa bringing forth the new
man living in the watery word of God. Annually they awaited its flood,
which was heralded by the constellation of Orion. Robert Bauval and
Adrian Gilbert have shown in The Orion Mystery that the pyramid complex
at Giza has been laid out as an exact scale model of the stars in Orion's belt.
The mysterious monuments and writings left behind by the ancients
serve multitudinous purposes, not least of which is the preservation of the
occult sciences. But there exists an element to these mysteries for which it
is hard to find a rational explanation: it is the extraordinary emphasis placed
upon the Teacher, who is really of little importance when compared with
the Messianic King. Perhaps the ancient priests had seen what our
generation would face, and subsequently, for purely altruistic reasons,
boosted the



236 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Teacher's role as though to tell us that our lives — physical and spiritual
depended upon our listening to and acting upon his message. And this must
be a simple and an obvious one. It is the story of a diseased old sun god
named Nanahuatzin, who must die on the funerary pyre to be reborn as
Tonatiuh — the sun of the Golden Age. This Nanahuatzin is responsible
for spitting rocks and bringing forth maize (wisdom). If I might paraphrase
Oscar Wilde: We are all of us lying in the gutter, but some of us must now
look up at the stars.
That Quetzalcouatl, the once and future Jesus/bringer of knowledge, is
yet another version of the Teacher is certain. Well... almost. As we have
seen, the two Jesuses of the New Testament are lumped together. Likewise,
we find Arthur and Merlin with a fair amount of interwoven myth. In the
Quetzalcouatl tradition, we note that he has something of a double in
Tlaloc (Chaac), the Mayan rain god, who sometimes seems to play Merlin
the Teacher to Quetzalcouatl's Arthur, the Messianic King. The South
American deity certainly has his share of those elements that make up a
prince or leader. That all three traditions have this same intersection of
characters evidences their having been constructed thus.
From the Sumerian-like creation epic to even the ancient near eastern
astrological sign for Coma, 0, incorporated into Christian iconography, the
people of America retained a large part of this epic — from their great
flood to their tree of life. Like the rest of mankind, they had inherited it
from their own ancient priesthood.
When Europeans arrived in the New World they did not find primitive
peoples. They in fact found a highly sophisticated civilization whose cities
would have been the equal of any to be found in Europe and the East. The
architecture of the step pyramids, the layout of the city precincts and the
high level of artistry and craftsmanship in the working of precious metals
were evidence of a long-established and highly developed culture. Their
knowledge of astronomy was at least the equal of any in the ancient world.
Sitchin tells us (pages 166-167) that a pioneer in the study of South
American culture, S. Hagar, demonstrated that the Incas were not only
familiar with the zodiac and its parallel months but that it was a duplicate of
that known to Europeans. This he did in a lecture to the fourteenth
Congress of Americanists in 1904 entitled 'The Peruvian Asterisms and
their Relation to the Ritual'. Even some of the names bear a considerable
resemblance to those we are all familiar with, which go back to the time of
Sumer. Of primary



JESUS IN THE AMERICAS 237
interest to us is the symbol for Virgo, where we find no ambiguity or
allegory. The name of this sign for the Aztecs was Sara Mama, the Maize
Mother, and the symbol for it was the female genitalia, the place from
which man enters the world and which, by its reentry, he may pass into the
world of untime.
It will be recalled that I found Coma, the 'female genitalia', in Virgo, and
that I drew attention to her holding an ear of wheat, to which I attached
great significance. Invariably, the theme is of wisdom coming from the
womb of God. It would be interesting to try to estimate the mathematical
probabilities of the parallels being pure coincidence.
The Aztecs opened the zodiac at their equivalent of the sign Aries, which
was the time of the spring equinox. This tells us that South American
Indian astronomy goes back in excess of four thousand years. Quetzalcouatl
was a part of this astronomy-based set of beliefs, which was left to the
Incas by the Qwipu-kamayo, the masters of the knotted cord (of 72 letters).
Like Christians awaiting the return of Jesus, with equal validity and
considerable similarity the South American people awaited the promised
return of Quetzalcouatl, who had had to leave because of the god of war,
who must in every respect be a local version of Jehovah/Jesus, the god of
Pisces. King Arthur was defeated and died, but said he would return again.
If we do not see the obvious sameness in these legends, then we must
accept that they only express a forlorn hope in a hopeless world.
But, as I have said, these same people had yet to invent the wheel. It is
clear that the inhabitants of these cities at the time of the arrival of the first
Europeans were not the descendants of those who built them. That is to say
that they were at no time privy to the knowledge of the ancient builders,
who in their minds were the gods who came, with their knowledge of the
stars, down from the stars. The ancestors of the occupants would long ago,
under the direction of these astronomer-priests, have helped to build these
architectural wonders. They themselves would have for millennia lived
simple lives in small villages outside the precincts. The city occupants
would have moved among them directing their entire living. Every aspect
of their lives, be it medicine, settling family and tribal disputes, agriculture
and even feast days, would have been governed by these apparently god
like priests. Even the delivery of infants would have been in their hands.
And from time to time one of those infants, always a firstborn, would have
been



238 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
taken into the city to be educated and to become one of their number. There
was never any guarantee that a child born to a priestess and fathered by a
priest would be suitable for the life of a shaman. Perhaps such unsuitable
children may have been adopted by the villagers, for whom the city
dwelling magi were benefactors — they completely untutored and their
shepherds all-knowing and wise.
Little did they realize that, many thousands of years earlier, the ancestors
of these magicians had lived among them as the strange individuals for
whom life was a mystery to be resolved. When young they would have
been, because of their nature, excluded by other children and even a target
of derision. But this isolation would have served them well, for eventually,
when the time was right, their inner door would have opened and their
power would have become immeasurable. And, under their stewardship,
mankind would have lived simple and peaceful lives in a Golden Age.
Though its use has recently gone out of fashion, the human brain has not
altered in size and capacity for at least the last ten thousand years. What has
changed is the external and internal forces which work upon it. If we read
the ancient myths, the Qumran Scrolls and even the Scriptures correctly
if, in fact, with the use of the cosmic tree, those ancient priests did visit and
actually are visiting our time — we must presume they were fully familiar
with our Pandora's box of modern sciences, disciplines that they were wise
enough not to exploit.
Recent archaeological evidence suggests that the Sumerians and the
ancient Chinese may have long ago visited the South American
civilizations. This has been dismissed out of hand by some; others have
labelled such possibilities as 'mysterious'. What clouds our judgement is the
fact that the bulk of ancient mankind lived simple and primitive lives.
Evidence of the existence of the priest kings is an anomaly. For a time we
even tried to associate them with aliens from another world, which is
clearly ridiculous but understandable in the circumstances.
The only real mystery that I can see is that we flatly refuse to accept that
ancient man was at least our equal in his knowledge of the universe. If he
could build the Pyramid of Cheops; if, despite its being invisible to the
naked eye, he knew that the star Sirius was orbited by another (Sirius B)
every fifty years, and that it was a dense star; if he could build the fabulous
cities of the Incas and the Aztecs: why could he not build ships that could
circumnavigate the globe?



JESUS IN THE AMERICAS 239
As the times changed, perhaps, in accord with some vast cosmic plan (I
really do not know), the priests abandoned their cities and, much later, the
peasants moved in. In many instances they were likely chased out by these
peasants. But, in any case, they promised to return. No doubt they were
careful to destroy much evidence of their world, but left us enough to
eventually learn the truth. And what about Quetzalcouatl, the white serpent
bringer of knowledge? He promised to return on the wings of a great bird.
That great bird could well be a modern airliner.
In The Lost Realms (pages 82-84) there is quoted an interesting tale
which we have inherited from ancient Egypt. The book referred to in this
story is obviously the Scriptures; the box is the tree and the rest is self
explanatory. The tale relates the adventures of Satni-Khamois and the
mummies. Its object is the association of Thoth-Hermes with the number
52 and its relationship with the cosmic tree. Thoth-Hermes is one of the
Egyptian versions of the Teacher/bringer of wisdom.
Satni-Khamois was the son of a pharaoh and, like the Teacher, destined
to become a great magician. He studied the ancient sacred writings and was
given to wandering through the necropolis of Memphis where he learned
much from the writings on temple walls. On meeting a mysterious old man,
he was told of a secret tomb where he might discover a book written in
Thoth's own hand, wherein he would find revealed all the mysteries of
heaven and earth. Therein he would learn the secrets of the rising of the sun
and the cycles of the moon; in fact, he might learn all the secrets of the
gods. This book, the old man said, was to be found in the tomb of the
Pharaoh Nenoferkheptah (circa 1250 BCE). The old man warned Satni that
the Pharaoh was dead and alive and could strike down anyone who tried to
take the book from where it lay at his feet.
Satni set out to find the tomb, which he eventually discovered was below
ground and which he entered with a magic spell. There he found the
mummies of Nenoferkheptah, his sister-wife and their son. In this instance
we see that we have repetition in imagery of Osiris the sun shut up and
living-dead. His sister-wife is the Goddess of the womb, and their son must
be the Sceptre if Satni is the Teacher who is also Thoth who recorded those
revelations in the first place.
The book at the Pharaoh's feet gave off a bright light as though the sun
was shining from within it — the Teacher setting the stone



240 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
(sun) in the tree. The sister-wife of Pharaoh was the first to speak, and she
warned Satni not to touch this text. She told him how her own brother
husband had had great adventures when he tried to obtain it.
It is worth noting in passing that we have treated as historical the idea
that the Egyptian pharaohs were given to marrying their sisters. It is now
clear that the religion of ancient Egypt was one and the same as that of
Scripture, which clearly forbids incestuous marriage. The references are
obviously pure myth, which relates to the relationship of Coma and the sun
upon the cosmic tree and their joint parentage of the Star and Sceptre even
though they are brother and sister in the heavens.
The volume that Satni sought had originally been hidden by Thoth in a
series of boxes rather like the Russian babushka dolls. He placed the book
in a golden box (the sun) which was in a silver box (the moon). These in
turn were in a series of other boxes of which the outermost were of bronze
and iron. Iron, I have said, is the Age of Pisces and bronze was the
preceding Age of Aries, which is a fire sign.
Nenoferkheptah had to overcome many obstacles to obtain the book, but
for all his efforts he invoked the curse of Thoth when he achieved his
objective, and thus he and his sister-wife were buried alive as mummies in
a tomb. Quite clearly, in this story, at the end of Pisces (the iron box)
Satni's task is not only to find what is effectively his own writings, he
obviously has some role in releasing the royal family, which is where the
story gets its theme of playing the game of 52.
Nenoferkheptah told Satni that he might only obtain the text by playing
and winning this game. He first lost, and then won, and so finally achieved
his objective. Sitchin goes on to describe this story as an ancient version of
Raiders of the Lost Ark, and he is absolutely correct. But the laws which
govern the unconscious feminine are not as those that govern the masculine
external. The only detail of this story that may need explanation is the said
game of 52.
A month is a 'moonth' or moon period of twenty-eight days, which is
exactly four weeks. If we divide fifty-two weeks into four-week periods,
we have thirteen months and a thirteen-sign zodiac, releasing Coma and the
sun. And that information was in the book which Satni sought.
Quetzalcouatl promised to return on the wings of a great bird. Jesus, we
are told, will come upon the clouds. Nostradamus tells



JESUS IN THE AMERICAS 241
us that our sage will travel far and wide preaching his gospel of the stone in
the tree. It is, I admit, no easy task to imagine an Egyptian Horus — the
god of time — stepping into the present from a modern airliner. But it is
only unimaginable if we give these deities actuality in the past. If many of
us have no difficulty in accepting that Nostradamus was a genuine seer,
why should we not read the same messages in some ancient Egyptian tomb
inscription if the message is truly there?
In Egypt the cult of Isis, Osiris and Horus is said to have pertained for at
least four thousand years. In the Egyptian pantheon Osiris is the sun, Isis is
Coma, and Horus, the all-seeing eye who revealed everything, is the
Teacher.
Osiris as a sun god is both a shepherd and a vegetative tree god; under
his administration Egypt flourishes. He brings laws and learning, and then
leaves to spread his teaching to other nations. In his absence his wife Isis
administers the kingdom wisely and the dark is kept at bay. But the first
Golden Age is about to come to an end. The forces of darkness are about to
cut down the tree.
On his return, with the aid of Aso, Queen of Ethiopia (an Egyptian
Lilith), the dark gets the measure of Osiris. He is tricked, at a feast, into
entering a chest bedecked with 'precious stones', which was made
especially for him. It is then conveyed to the mouth of the Nile. The news is
brought to Isis at Coptos by the Pans and Satyrs, whereupon she cuts off a
lock of her hair. Princess Berenice did the same for her husband's return.
Isis discovers that the chest has been carried by the sea to Byblos, where
the waves have set it in the branches of a tamarisk tree. This same tree
quickly grows to enclose the chest in its trunk. The king then takes this
trunk as a support for the roof of his house. Isis in her hunt learns this and
finds employment as nurse to the king's son, to whom she gives suck with
her finger. This pattern suggests that the king is the idol Jesus and his son
the false Messiah.
She also tries to give the child immortality by each night passing him
through the fire. The symbolism here seems quite substantial, but it
obviously refers to passing through the fiery wheels. The babe's mother
brings a sharp end to Isis' initiation of her son. In this sense the infant's
mother is also her own mother, or more accurately a negative Isis
incarnated in the Piscean Age.
Ultimately she obtains her husband's body and takes it back to Egypt,
where in her absence Set cuts it into fourteen parts and scatters it about the
land. Isis goes off hunting to find these pieces.



242 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Meanwhile Horus has come of age, Osiris is resurrected from the
Underworld, and Horus goes off to do battle with Typhon, who fits the role
of the idol Jesus. As I have said, Osiris is the sun.
Many of the pyramid texts offer keys for the use of the tree as a means of
entering the land of the dead and calling upon the Lord of the Lock of Hair.
What I have thus far termed a tree, a boat or a fisher's net, is actually none
of these things. It is an ancient piece of scientific equipment to be used for
breaking out of our own time and space — not something you would freely
hand to everyone. For this reason it was hidden that it might only be
accessible to the children of Israel, those properly trained and prepared for
its use. It is for this reason alone that, through their scriptures, the Qumran
Community appears austere and extremely hierarchical.
Let us look now at the Papyrus of Ani, The Book of the Dead, as trans
lated by Wallis Budge.26
In a hymn to Osiris, the following is said of him (page 59):
1. He is Lord of eternity and king of the gods with manifold names.
2. He is a being of hidden form in the temples.
3. He is the prince of divine food in Anu (references to the Anunnaki and
Nun the fifty will be recalled). Thus his many names total fifty. The
divine food is wisdom (bread).
4. He is the soul of Ra (the sun). He causes the sun to rise in the tree.
5. He makes his soul to be raised up.
6. He is the substance of the two lands, taken to be Upper and Lower
Egypt, but this refers to the land of the living and land of the dead.
7. He is the god of the celestial ocean from which Nu draws his waters.
Thus he is the sun rising up from the watery womb of the sea, mercurial
and wise.
8. He is the first among his brethren (the stars).
9. He sits upon the throne of his father like Ra.
10. His sister Isis has protected him against fiends in evil times.
11. She raised his member upon his dead body and conceived Horus. Thus,
at the end of Pisces, Coma has intercourse with the dead sun and gives
birth to Horus the Teacher, who in turn is a sun god for he brings the
sun to new life. She drew his essence and made an heir; likewise,
Joseph fertilizes Egypt.
12. She brought up Horus in loneliness in a place where he was not known.
This is precisely what is said of the Teacher as Elijah.



JESUS IN THE AMERICAS 243
13. Horus grew in stature in the house of Keb.
14. The company of the gods rejoiced at the coming of this son of Isis, heir
to Osiris.
It has been believed that the ancient world worshipped the sun as a god,
giver of life. We may now see where this misconception comes from.
Contrary to belief, the boat of the sun was not expected to carry the dead
into eternity: it was to carry the living. As often as not, even the names of
the gods were used to convey this information, as in the case of Ptah,
whose name means 'opener'. The Book of the Dead says (page 170) that he
opened the mouths of the gods: he caused them to reveal mysteries. Like
Ra, Brahma and P'an ku, to name but a few, Ptah was born from a golden
egg, which we might see as a stone laid by the Goddess and fertilized by
the sun.
Horus — from which we derive 'hour' — is the god who transcends time.
An hour comprises 60 minutes, each of 60 seconds. Hence an hour is 3600
seconds, and it gives the circle of 360 degrees. The number of years in an
age — 2160 — is also the tenth part of the number of minutes in a circle.
The tree is a time machine. Horus is the son of the widow, the dark Spider
Queen, weaver of webs and spells. He, like Prometheus, steals fire (the sun)
from the gods.
In the tree, the sun rises in the East (Leo) as it does in our sky. Just as he
is actually the source of all life, the Egyptians endowed him as such on the
tree. Thus the Teacher is the Star, the Star is our sun, and, in mythical
terms, this magus becomes a creator of a new world.
Khepera is in the early myths 'The Creator' and, just as was the case with
Jesus, Khepera was later made to be a form of Ra the sun (page 109); even
later he is identified with Horus. Once again, it is exactly the same case as
with the Teacher. Khepera was father of the gods and lord of heart and
mind (page 118). The scarab was his symbol, and she was mother of heart
and tongue. Later this idea transferred to the cicada, which lies dormant at
the roots of trees and feeds on their juices for many years before springing
to life.
As Budge points out, Nut was the female form of Nu, the 50. The watery
deep of which she was queen was set in the sky. This deity was both mother
and daughter of Ra. That is to say that, as the Goddess of the thirteenth
stone, she was creatress and daughter who rose up from him. Manu was the
region of the west where this Queen of Heaven manifested (page 130), just
as Coma rises in the west of the tree.
Budge points out (page 341) that the Sphinx was dedicated to Horus; it
was built for the Teacher as a signpost on his way. The



244 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Mantchet, later Atett, boat was the Egyptian name for the tree in which the
spirit travelled across the sky to meet the gods.
Thoth-Hermes was the creator and spirit of Ra. He was the inventor of
letters; he brought astronomy, mathematics and all the arts and sciences.
He was the unspeakable word that brought forth creation. He was in short a
Llew Llaw, and another generation of the Teacher.
Prior to bringing Horus into the world, Isis fashioned a wooden phallus
from which she conceived and gave birth to Harpocrates, a (spiritually)
crippled creature of loathsome appearance. This is yet another instance
where the Goddess is mother to light and dark. It is in this form that we
find her as the black madonna or prostitute who is mother to a true and a
false messiah.
On page 343 Budge makes the following statement about Thoth in a
footnote. It needs virtually no comment from me:
He was the 'lord of Law', the 'maker of Law', and the 'begetter of Law'. He
acted as the advocate of Osiris when the god was tried, at the insistence of Set
(the Devil), by the gods in the Divine Court at Heliopolis, and he proved the
truthfulness of Osiris, and showed that he was innocent of the charges made
against him by Set, and secured the acquittal of Osiris. He presided at the
weighing of the hearts of the dead before Osiris and composed the formulae
which enabled souls to find their way through Dead-land in peace and safety.
When Horus and Set were fighting to the death for mastery, Thoth appeared
and acted the part of arbitrator, and arranged the conditions under which each
god consented to live peacefully ever after. As a mathematician Thoth
computed times and seasons, and ordained laws for the heavenly bodies, and
so effected the ordering and well-being of the world which his utterance had
caused to come into being. According to an ancient legend Set attacked the
eye of the sun, and injured it very seriously; and, finding the new moon in the
sky one evening as he was wandering about the heavens, he swallowed it.
Thoth attacked Set, and cut off one of his limbs, and healed the eye of the sun,
thus restoring its light to the world, and then he treated Set in such a way that
he vomited forth the crescent moon, which Thoth at once restored to the night
sky.
His presiding at the weighing of hearts — the scales are Libra, which is the earth
— seems to echo the statement in the Scrolls that those who believed the Teacher
were saved, and those who did not



JESUS IN THE AMERICAS 245
were lost. Thus, his word of creation is repeated in Hebrew concepts in
which his revelation brings about a new word (Jerusalem) as opposed to an
old one. His word — and he is that word/lamb — spiritually creates Israel.
The attack of the serpent Set on the sun and moon gives rise to the
biblical star rising in Jacob/Judah/Leo and Sceptre coming out of Israel.
The sun has but one eye; this is the 'all-seeing eye' which also describes the
Teacher. The restoring of the sun's sight is the restoration of his all
seeingness on the tree. This being done with a limb of the serpent (the
Beast) confirms the idea of the Dark sharpening the Light. Set swallowed
the moon. But he could not utterly destroy the feminine spirit; he could
only put it out of circulation for a time. Thus the Star/Sun rises up and
brings Coma the moon spirit literally out of the mouth of the serpent Jesus
beast.
The mythmakers extracted countless threads from a very rich tapestry.
They encouraged us to think them primitive, and thus we would none of us
suspect the sophistication that lay beneath writings such as Scripture. But if
we were duped, it was only that our children might live.
The Abtu and Ant were two fishes that swam before the boat of Ra as
lookouts. They are the Star and Sceptre, and the two fishes of the sign
Pisces. 'The followers of Horus' are Israel, the smiths who built the Sampo
(footnote, page 346). Budge points out in footnote 3, page 352, a word play
on the words 'user', 'power', and 'Asar', 'Osiris'. It is from this source that we
derive Israel and Jerusalem. The Osiris of the plant world is Asar-uu, the
object here being to denote the power of the sun which is manifest in the
fifty names. It thus becomes an easy transition from Asarualim to
Yarusalaim, Jerusalem, city of the sun.
The object in the name Israel is literally to denote the people of the
power of the sun in the tree. The progression here is via Asar-uu on to
Asaruludu, which is worked through to Asarilu, and on to Isarilu etc. In this
same way we can trace the origin of the Shield (Star) of David, which can
be found even in ancient Tibet.
The Sumerians termed the land of the dead the Magan land. One entered
it in the Magan boat. The star, correctly shield, of David is in Hebrew
'magan'. Hence the tree was the Magan boat in Sumer, and for the Hebrews
a magan, shield; and thus as a six-pointed star it is a hieroglyph for the tree
of knowledge. That same star is the sun and the Teacher, the literal eye of
Horus, he who saw everything and revealed the mysteries of God.



246 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
As I mentioned earlier, the founders of the United States were
Freemasons. US currency carries a pyramid with a raised capstone which
has within it the all-seeing eye. The six-pointed star was a Templar device.
It did not become a Jewish glyph until the early nineteenth century.
Curiously, if the Jews should have a symbol it would be the Tau, the cross
painted on the doorposts at the Passover. The all-seeing eye is thus that of
the Teacher; he sees and reveals everything. This is no mere coincidence,
for on the Great Seal of the United States the heraldry is intended to convey
the number 13, which is constantly repeated in its symbolism.
In a reference on page 357, in note 3, Budge mentions the sacrum bone,
Greek 'hieron osteon', the sacred bone. This was in Egypt the hieroglyph for
teth, which in Hebrew became the letter teth, sound T', which later appears
as the cross. The bone is situated between the two hip-bones of the pelvis.
It became synonymous with the serpent's tooth, the sacred stone. The
Hebrew samec, sound 'S', is a serpent chewing its tail.
In Century 8:16 Nostradamus says:
At the place where HIERON builds his ship, There shall be a great
and sudden flood, They will not find any place nor land to save them,
The waters shall rise to the Olympic Fesulan.
The ship the Teacher (as Noah) builds is the tree, in which he inserts the
HIERON (sacred stone). It is interesting to note that, no matter what source
the material stems from, even in the smallest detail the symbols are the
same. This suggests a central source which must be the land of the dead.
Thus we see the emergence of a language of the angels, comprising
symbols with manifold meanings.
Egyptian religion is replete with references to the balance, which
scholars have seen as the scales in which the soul is weighed in judgement.
We have seen that upon the tree the scales is the earth, which is the place
of testing. It was possibly perceived as a womb from which we are born,
the fiery furnace in which gold is refined. Thus the ancient view must have
likened our three score and ten years to nine months in the womb before
birth into the eternal life. The manner of dismantling the tree has a
philosophical meaning too. Man is subsequently to be without light, with no
power of generation — and thus a eunuch unable to develop and progress.



JESUS IN THE AMERICAS 247
In this sense, man's mother/wife was sold into slavery and became the whore of
Babylon: Wisdom sold herself cheap in our time.
Conclusion
We are now seeing that the story of our two heroes goes well beyond the Bible.
Even the people of the Americas were waiting for the Teacher.
We have now also begun to form some firm idea of how things really were in the
ancient world. I have argued strongly for the case that, though the bulk of humanity
lived simple and primitive lives, they did so under the guidance of the wise priest
kings, who must have appeared like gods in their midst. These same priests were, in
previous millennia, the oddball left-handed, right-brained individuals who, with
time and the universe in propitious aspect, found total power and governed the
world in peace and justice. But they also declined as the winter season approached.
Thus the magi of Egypt were absolutely no different to those of Palestine. What we
see in the various empires is a progressive decline forcing these shamans to move
on and build new and smaller domains.
It will be recalled that references have been made to The Lost Realms. This book
is totally unremarkable in that its content presents nothing new. But it is relevant in
that it is representative of the junk press ancient astronauts genre. Such works tell us
that, in reality, we know virtually nothing of the past. In the absence of spiritual
truth, these opportunistic scrib-blings create mechanistic gods for a mechanistic age.
Two thousand years ago, Christ, the feminine spirit of inner truth and
understanding, was withdrawn, and was effectively dead to the world. The
misconceptions, misunderstandings and self-deceptions were, then, only small and
gradual, as they progressed through the times of captivity among the Gentiles. Now,
as is evidenced by the world around us, truth has been totally lost. Our world has, by
degrees, become a topsy-turvy land. Mankind has now been prepared for the
ultimate lie, which it will take to be divine revelation. This book may or may not
reveal truths. But I must insist that it raises a very large question mark as to the
solidity and reliability of the many and diverse conceptions of it to which we feebly
cling, when in reality we know truth to be singular.
Throughout this text I examine a number of religions other than those of
Scripture. The reader should understand that in these instances there is neither space
for, nor any pretention to, an in-depth analysis. I have touched upon them, only very
lightly, in the hope that it might encourage readers to make their own more intensive
examinations.



15
The Steps of Vishnu
We cannot be specific because, as I have said, there was never any cut-off
point. Perhaps it all began with the dawn of civilizations like Sumer, when
the masculine force began to assert itself and the feminine began to
weaken. Over the millennia, the priests were progressively corrupted by
material principles; the general populace was also in a state of increasing
agitation. But the remnant remained, still clinging tenuously to a degree of
power well into our age. The disappearance of the Druids and Essenes was
a very gradual process, and even today they live among us.
As I have said, tradition has it that many Essenes went east after Rome
quelled the rebellion. Again, there is no evidence, but there is
circumstantial support for the idea that they were present in India and had
some considerable influence over the culture. Either way India had a long
standing tradition of its own.
In The Hindu Scriptures, in the Rig-Veda I, xxiv: 7-8,27 the same
elements begin to occur:
In the bottomless [abyss] king Varuna By the power of his pure will
upholds aloft The [cosmic] tree's high crown. There stand below [The
branches], and above the roots. Within us, May the banners of his light be
firmly set!
For the sun hath king Varuna prepared A broad path that he may roam
along it: For the footless he made feet that he might move: And he it is who
the stricken of heart absolves.
Once again, someone is setting the sun in the tree. We have now seen
enough to recognize the entire story in these two verses. In this case, the
Teacher's name is King Varuna. The 'stricken of heart' are Israel, who are
absolved of sin by their acceptance of his message, which awakens them to
the right ways of God. These are the sleepers who awake.
The most easily recognized elements in these writings are Mother Aditi
as Coma and Bull Vishnu as yet another version of the Revealer of
Mysteries. In 1, cliv: 3 we read:



THE STEPS OF VISHNU 249
May [this] my hymn attain to Vishnu and inspire him, Dwelling in the
mountains, widely striding Bull, Who, one and alone, with but three steps
this long And far-flung place of meeting measured out.
The 'place of meeting' is obviously the cosmic tree. It will be recalled
that I said the Teacher comes out of Taurus and is Man-asseh the son of
Joseph, the sun. Likewise the Egyptian Osiris was the son of the corn
goddess, and, as her consort, would have fathered an enlightened Taurean
bull — Horus — who saw and revealed everything. His mother, Isis, is
associated with Venus, the ruling planet of the bull, and as such was the
patroness of prostitutes. Later I shall show that the Antichrist is also a
Taurian. Hence she is mother of both good and evil, the Magdalene or
black madonna. The counterpart to Horus in India was Prajapati, who was
the personal Brahma born of the golden egg — the thirteenth stone
fertilized by the sun.
We may now see the relationship between Jesus worship and India's
sacred cows. The Indian caste system is, accordingly, a foreshadowing of
how the future Israel will separate itself from, and set itself above, present
day mankind. It might also indicate how a modern Israel, led by the
Antichrist, will begin its persecution of the Gentiles. Either way, it would
seem the feeble-minded are doomed.
Immediately after he was born, Indra the bull-spirited golden child
released the rain-bringing cattle which had been captured by Vritra the
dragon, the demon of drought he slew with a thunder-stone. Indra is often
associated with Agni the sun god. These two are, as often as not, referred to
as twins, and both the sun and the Teacher are stars. Agni was the universal
soul of everything; as was the case with Elijah and Horus, his birth was
kept secret. He had ten mothers who were two sets of sisters to whom Agni
himself gave birth. There are, without the new sun, ten sephiroth on the
tree, and its appearance causes them to rise up, as balanced pairs in the
mind, after he is born of them. Furthermore his mothers were waters — the
word of God. In the Mahabharata he is the all-seeing gold-toothed one
teeth are stones — who roars like a bull. In common with the legends we
have followed, it is said that Agni was the father of three sons, whom I take
to be the Baptist, the Teacher and King Jesus. In Rig-Veda 10,xl:2 Agni
was taken to the Bhrigus, a tribe without fire: could the Bhrigus be the
British?
Where, in Hebrew Scripture, we find the sun in the form of



250 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Joseph with his coat of many colours, in the Rig-Veda we have Rudra with a many
coloured necklace (ll,xxxiii:10).
In the Atharva-Veda the Teacher becomes Brahman. In common with all other
myths, because he raised the new sun in the tree, and the sun is the creator of life,
Brahman becomes the creator. In x,ll:21 it says:
Brahman [it is who] acquires one learned in the scriptures; Brahman
[wins] the highest lord: Brahman [as] Man [acquires] this fire; Brahman [it
is who] measured out the year.
He established the sun. In verse 23 we see:
Brahman [it is who] dwells beside the gods; Brahman beside the
common people among the gods; Brahman beside this other [class], not
princely; Brahman is called Being, the princely [class].
Here we see Brahman as a man of the people and the priestly/ princely class. In
26 and 27 we read:
Atharvan sewed up his head and heart: A wind, rising above the brain,
expelled [it] from the head.
Atharvan's head assuredly Is a casket of the gods, close sealed: This head
the bread of life [prana] protects.
It is curious to juxtapose these ancient writings of a major world religion with the
statement by Nostradamus that a young man sitting late at night in his study has
discovered the great secret. He has achieved this because he has a 'complete brain':
like Atharvan he has his head and heart joined. This sage will go on to alter the
entire course of human history. Where mankind was destined to annihilate itself, he
finds the power which he gives to the king who establishes a Golden Age. In the
Atharva-Veda the New Jerusalem — cosmic tree — becomes the city of Brahman.
In verse 29 we read:
Whoso that city of Brahman truly [vai] knows As swathed in immortality,
To him do Brahman and the Brahmans give Sight, life [prana], and progeny.



THE STEPS OF VISHNU 251
In verses 31-33 the city has eight and nine entries (17); the numbers 1-17
total 153 (the 153 fishes in the net). See pages 224ff.
The city of the gods which none lays low in battle Has circles
eight and portals nine: In it is a golden treasure-chest, — Celestial,
suffused with light.
In this golden treasure-chest, three spoked and thrice supported,
In this there is a being strange [yaksa] possessed of self [atmanvat]:
That is what knowers of Brahman know.
Into this radiant [city], — yellow, gold, Compassed with glory round
about, The city unsubdued Brahma has entered in!
In X,VIII yellow male (the sun) has entered the golden yellow females
(Coma and the moon), who we later see in the form of a golden swan. In
verse 4 we find that the city tree has 300 pegs and 60 nails which none can
move, obviously referring to 360 degrees. In verse 5 it says:
Six twins there are, another born alone...
This totals 13, and it will be recalled that I divided the tree into two
wheels. Verse 6 reads:
Though manifest, it is yet hidden, secret: The 'ageing' is its name, a
mighty mode of being [pada]. Therein is this universe [firm] fixed;
Therein is [all] that moves and breathes established.
Another book of the Hindu scriptures, the Bhagavad-Gita, describes the
apocalyptic war of Krishna and the Pandavas. Like the Qur'an it deals
specifically with the destruction of the unrighteous, or those who oppose
the new universal kingdom.
It is for this reason that Islam appears to be a militant religion. Like other
descendants of an original global faith and philosophy,



252 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Islam has its particular thread of a future event. In every instance we find
that the general populace has been left with a shadow of the distant future
after the priests had finally been forced to surrender their remaining power.
But before they did so they left their spiritual children a legacy disguised as
Judaism and Christianity. This repository of false religion would be a
means of awakening them.
In Century 4: 59 Nostradamus refers to 'Nira', which is an anagram of
Iran. He speaks of the old ayatollah as 'an old dreamer'. Of these events he
says that those things which 'began' in France — the ayatollah arrived in
Iran from France — would also 'end' there. But, most importantly,
Nostradamus tells us that the ayatollah and his followers were motivated by
'too great a faith'. Throughout our quest we have found the same unspoken
truth. That which creates and is self-existent in all things manifest is the
Life Force which is all manifestation; that which is the life and soul of both
the devour-er and the devoured is the absolute and only reality. We call it
God, but cannot know it. Mankind has used religion as a universal means
of self-delusion and avoiding simple truth. God can only be loved and
worshipped by man in the love and kindness he displays toward all other
living things which themselves are the embodiment of God.
The truth, itself a manifestation of God within us, was once audible to all
mankind. We stopped listening and the message became blurred. It is the
love and kindness, the truthfulness, uprightness and justice with which we
deal with the world that is the only form of true religious worship. It is also
the only means by which man can manifest the power of God within him.
While the Indian sub-continent was part of the flow and exchange of
political, philosophical and religious ideas, China was, as she is now,
history's sleeping giant. Though she was largely able to stave off outside
influence, the turmoil within was exactly the same as was occurring
everywhere else in the ancient world. As an example of this changing of
global consciousness, by 221 BCE Shih-huang-ti, being King of Ts'in
(China), had absorbed many of the surrounding states into his own, and he
declared himself first emperor of the greater China. Foreshadowing the
coming of the Piscean Age, he declared that all the annals should be
destroyed and that history would begin with his reign.
In recent times, the West has placed a heavy emphasis on the equality of
women as a gender. How can something which is totally different be equal?
What we have overlooked is that the inequality



THE STEPS OF VISHNU 253
with which women (the gender) have been treated is only secondary and
subsequent to the oppression of the feminine within all of us. The turmoil
within has occurred, as all things must, in the microcosm of you and me
and on a macrocosmic scale such as in China, which did not import these
problems from any source other than the cosmos. Thus man came to
worship a male external god instead of the true Spirit of All.
China had been governed by priest kings just like the rest of the world.
The historical record shows a gradual decline into feudalism. Perhaps these
events began as early as six thousand years ago with the start of the winter
season of the Great Year. At this point, the masculine, material, external
forces are becoming more and more dominant.
At the start of our era, as with much of the rest of the world, China had
retained a corrupted reminiscence of the religion of the priests. The warrior
monks still existed as a class, though greatly fallen in stature. While the
Essenes were busy establishing the story of Jesus, the priest/messenger
from God, the warrior monks of China were spreading the gospel of
Confucianism.
Different races with differing natures have given the same story diverse
emphases in the varied aspects of its actual reality. In Confucius we have
less of a religious figure and more the social and political philosopher.
These teachings were grafted onto the existing remains of the beliefs of the
ancient magi to form a social and religious system which became a guide
and way of life to a quarter of the earth's population. Scholarship generally
acknowledges that Confucian doctrine antedates its supposed founder. He
himself is credited with saying that he did not create his doctrine: that he
was merely a messenger. Likewise pagan Christianity must predate the
Teacher.
This sage is said to have been born in the year 551 BCE (possibly 552) in
the state of Lu. He was the son of a widow and, like the Teacher, 'his father
knew him not'. He was of the class of warrior monks, though his mother
had fallen on hard times and was of 'low estate'. Confucius actively sought
to re-establish the monarchy of the historical rulers. Within this myth,
which is regarded as part of his country's history, we have him — like the
Teacher — going into exile, because he supported a descendant of the
ancient monarchy and his claim to the throne of Lu. Like their Palestinian
counterparts, the priests of Confucianism were called the 'Ju' (Jews).
From what can be discerned of him, particularly from writings



254 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
such as the Analects, Confucius was a student of the ancient religious
documents of his time — as must be the case with the Teacher. He was
aware of his status as a descendant of the priest kings: a humane man with
sympathy for the poor, he set righteousness above all other values. He was
— like his Palestinian equivalent — a meek and gentle man. Like the
Galilean he taught the principle of doing unto others as you would have
them do unto you. Of his disciples, three are prominent, insofar as Jan
Ch'iu seems to be the local version of the 'Scoffer', Tzu-kung seems to be
James the Just and Yen Hui would appear to be Peter. Like that of his
biblical counterpart, the life of this man is one of disappointment and
rejection. As with Jesus' gospel, his teachings were spread by his disciples
after his death.
Confucius' detractors say he was a reactionary who dreamed of the return
of the Golden Age, a conservative who believed the future to lie in the
hands of the shamans of old. But most important is the fact that he was
primarily concerned with establishing a kingdom of heaven on earth. He
did not concern himself with the metaphysical, but believed men must first
change from within. His basic attitude seems to have been that he could not
teach the mysteries of heaven when people did not understand the secrets of
life on earth (refer John 3,12). This prophet knew himself to be a messenger
sent by God, and accordingly taught T'ien Tao, the way of heaven, to be
found in Jen Tao, the way of man. His fundamental principles were Jen
(love) and Feng Tao, the way of sacrifice.
Central to Confucian worship was a stone set in the centre of a
magnificent temple. The religious rites took place at the rising of the sun.
To the west of this omphalos stone — west is the position of Coma on the
tree — stood the Altar of Abstinence, Chai Kung. The animals sacrificed
were bullocks without blemish, symbols of the Teacher who came down
from Taurus and was sacrificed to the gods.
It is said that the Tao (word) in China emerged from water as the Great
Mother:
Great is the Tao for it passes on in constant flow.
Passing on, it has become remote, but returns.
Returning, it is revealed.
Greatness and greatest is the Tao.
By its stillness, it is the female that captures the male.

From its invisibility, all things that are came into being. From its
silence, it rules and orders the universe. Great is the Tao.
Lao Tze, the father of Taoism, like Jesus suffered a fate worse than
death: having come only as a messenger he was subsequently worshipped
as divine.
Yet again we have an example of how the masculine (in both genders)
denied the equality and partnership of the feminine within. Rather than take
her as a working partner, he used her igno-rantly and unaware that she was
a rib drawn from his own side.
While China may have been far removed from the influences we discuss,
no land on earth could have been more remote and forbidding than the
continent of Australia. Even today it is a vast, hot and fly-infested sandpit
populated with remote pockets of human children building castles in the air.
The early white settlers came mostly from the lowest layers of English
peasant society. Artificially created social structures of this type cannot be
expected to have a long or healthy lifespan. Whatever stratification the
community may achieve will be purely on the basis of material wealth. And
this will lead to the greatest social poverty of all.
Once a body has been corrupted, as was the case with the dis
enfranchising of the feminine at the dawn of our age, that corruption will
percolate. At the higher social levels one will find attempts at restoring the
balance, as was the case with Templarism and Freemasonry, philosophies
designed to instil a sense of social justice. As one moves down the social
ladder, one finds excesses and extremism. Recent moves to achieve some
degree of justice by the Australian Aborigine have met with a reactionary
response. Given that it is basically a peasant society and that a large number
of white immigrants have in recent years arrived from South Africa, the
emergence of neo-Nazi attitudes is probable in a country where the
feminine in the indigenous people is now awakening, as it is throughout the
old white empire.
Homo sapiens sapiens (modern big-brained man) is about fifty thousand
years old. Australian native civilization is estimated to have been in
existence for about forty thousand years.
One form in which we find the cosmic tree among the Aborigine is the
Tnatantja, a pole reaching from earth to heaven. It was covered in down,
which was dispersed by the wind; that which fell to the right changed into
men and that which fell to the left changed



256 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
into women. Later, men slept at its foot. When, later still — the dawn of
Pisces — they went to war, they left it in the care of Termite Woman — a
Lilith type who sleeps in a termite mound as opposed to a stone. These
creatures exist by destroying trees, and all this happened when the people
went to war. Under her protection the Tnatantja snapped at its base.
Eventually it erected itself again, but it was now prone to falling over. On
one occasion it purposely threw itself down at an unnamed ancestor (an
Old One). It missed him by the breadth of a 'hair'. He picked it up, shook it
violently till it broke in two (Ezekiel's wheels) and dragged it away (as in
the epic of Gilgamesh). One part of it grew to become the sacred
bloodwood tree. In the Teacher's role as Gilgamesh, at his (spiritual) birth
he is rescued by an eagle, a concept likewise found in Australian tradition.
Wherever we find the tree we are bound to find the Queen of Heaven. In
one story, she is incarnate in the form of the three sisters who came down
from a group of three stars, these being a variant of the Egyptian Triple
Headed Goddess.
It seems that, while on their visit to the earth, one of them wandered off
and met with two separate men with whom she had intercourse. I take these
two to be the Star and Sceptre. Having had relations with mortals, she was
not allowed to return to her home in the heavens. By this method the story
establishes her as a star-born goddess among mortals. It is thus that this
becomes the story of the two sisters who are a constellation of three stars.
In the south-east of Australia we find the incarnated creator/ Teacher in
the role of Byamee. He is famous for his kindly concern for humankind and
his elevation of his favourite wife, Birrah-gnooloo, to the status of 'All
mother'. Having, as an emissary of the Great Spirit Father, created all things
and shown mankind how they should live, Byamee returned to the star
world, which among the Aborigines has a mythology replete with a
complex system of astronomy.
All was well until there came a year of drought and famine. Even the
trees died. One couple in desperation killed a rat kangaroo and ate it;
similarly Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit. They offered the flesh to a
starving friend who refused it because he remembered the instruction given
by Byamee. The couple had their fill and followed the hungry man to entice
him to eat the rest. They saw that he had miraculously crossed a fast
flowing river. This flow of water is no contradiction in the story, for it
obviously



THE STEPS OF VISHNU 257
represents — as in Scripture — the wisdom that flows from the mouth of
God. They saw him fall at the foot of a great gum tree from which there
descended Yowee, the angel of death, who took the man into the tree. It
then uprooted itself and flew off to the south (the position of Aquarius in
the cosmic temple). The tree then became the stars of the Southern Cross,
which is known as Yaraandoo. It was because of the wisdom famine that
death came into the world, and for this reason the trees wept and mourned.
Interestingly, at one end of the world the Aborigines set Yowee, the
angel of death, in the tree, and the tree in the stars of the Southern Cross. At
the other end, the Palestinian Essenes hung Jesus/Yowee, a true angel of
death in our age, on the same cosmic tree, a giant who would one day meet
his death at the hands of Jack (Jacob) the Giant Killer, who tossed him from
a rock.
Like the Babylonians -and other less remote peoples, the Aborigines
have their underworld, which the Dharuk call Binoomea. The ferryman
who takes people through the stones of fire and into the void of death is
known in Arnhem Land as Wulluwait.
Along with the cosmic tree, the Australian Aborigines have their own
version of the Flood. It was Great Kangaroo who gathered the creatures
together to push back the waters; he then spat out all the different tongues
that the peoples would speak. Given the remoteness and isolation of this
continent, we should be surprised at finding this particular legend.
In another story Byamee assembled the tribes of his creation at
Googoorewon, the place of the trees, for the first sacred bora ceremony. At
this auspicious occasion, one tribe, the Madhi, were behaving with
considerable disrespect. Even their women threatened to enter the sacred
circle, which was a representative microcosm of heaven, where Byamee
lived. This tells us that the Aborigines had their own version of the stone
circle. Byamee punished them by turning them into dingoes. Today the
dingoes live on the edge of human habitation, where even the children
throw 'stones' at them. This is their punishment for their disrespect to
Byamee.
In my wanderings I have collected many such tales, always told with
ceremonial precision, though the original meaning is usually lost. Similarly,
Freemasonry states that the secrets locked up in the Book of the Law (the
Bible) are now lost. These epics have been handed down through countless
generations — and they reach far back into the future. They are memories
of the Dreamtime and, as I have said, we are the dream within the dream
that is the dreaming.



258 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
To conclude this brief look at Aboriginal legend, I feel bound to include
the story of Byamee and his encounter with the women who lost the flying
grinding stones, which were used to grind wisdom from grass seed.
It all happened at the first corroboree (a sacred and/or festive meeting),
where Byamee took the form of a wirinun (shaman). While strolling one
morning through the grounds where the tribes were camped for the
gathering, he came across two women sitting with puzzled looks on their
faces. 'Why are you not working?', he asked. They told him that, though
they had put them away carefully the previous night, their grinding stones
had disappeared. In the story, one woman is quite confident in talking to
this great magus; thus hers is the stone of the sun. The other is shy and
withdrawn; so hers is that of Coma.
Byamee suggested that they might have loaned them to their neighbours,
the Du-mers, and forgotten they had done so. While everyone was
searching for the stones, Byamee spied a Wunda (an invisible spirit) flying
at tree-top level and carrying one of them off, obviously that of the sun,
which it planned to set in the tree. He drew the attention of the two women
to the apparently free-flying rock, to which the Du-mer women had now
begun to give chase. He then stretched out his hand and turned the Du-mer
into brown pigeons, which chased the Wunda spirit till it tired and dropped
the stone. Where it fell there sprang up a great mountain, which is
composed entirely of grinding stones. It will be recalled that, in the book of
Daniel, a stone was cut out without hands and grew to be a great mountain,
which is another name for the cosmic tree.
Whatever religion or corpus of mythology one examines, one finds the
same tradition in various states of disrepair. Wherever one goes, one sees
remnants of an ancient and high civilization.
In September 1871 a German geologist, Karl Mauch, arrived at
Zimbabwe, the prehistoric remains of what had been a sophisticated
civilization. In its vicinity lived natives in mud huts. In the Indus Valley are
the remains of Mahenjo-Daro and Harappa, which are more than 4500
years old. Like so many of their counterparts around the world, these cities
housed a militia priesthood. The precincts were set out in a manner
comparable with modern town planning, and all the houses were on mains
sewerage. So far the pictographic alphabet of the inhabitants has been
found to have some four thousand characters.



THE STEPS OF VISHNU 259
Several years ago, while visiting the main island of the Tongan group, I
was surprised to discover a place called Harmonga-a-Maui, which
translates as 'the burden of Maui'. Though made of coral rock, it is the
remains of a replica of Stonehenge in the midst of the Pacific ocean. Maui,
to my own satisfaction, is the Polynesian version of Jesus the Teacher,
whose burden is the temple of stones. From the little time I have been able
to give to this matter, it seems likely to me that Tonga was once the centre
of a priest king empire in the Pacific.
As has been said, the Great Year comprises 25,920 ordinary years.
During this time the sun and the earth spend a Great Month in each of the
twelve signs. Each astronomical period then governs both an ordinary
month and a Great Month, which, with a twelve-sign zodiac, contains 2160
ordinary years, and these are divided into four seasons. Logically, the same
must apply to the Great Year. This being so, it is arguable that modern
civilization came to fruition in the very late autumn, when the tree began to
shed its fruit and its leaves. Perhaps that season began at the dawn of the
Taurean era, six thousand years ago. In the Piscean Age, cold and dark
were upon the face of the earth. In the absence of the sun, men struggled to
store the meagre means of life. In the midst of this, our winter of
discontent, we lost sight and memory of the light, which would eventually
return.
Poetically speaking, Scripture must then be the seeds stored through
winter for spring planting. Could it all be as simple as this? It is to answer
such questions that religion exists. Plato was the originator of the legend of
lost Atlantis (the fifth book of Laws). Fortunes have been spent searching
for this fabulous and perfect city. As John Michell points out in City of
Revelation (pages 93ff.), as described by Plato it is yet another version of
the cosmic temple. Its perimeter enshrines the number 3168, which, as we
have seen, is in Scripture the value of 'Lord Jesus Christ'. Later men sought
El Dorado, the golden man, which became a golden city or island of seven
cities (the planets). The golden man is he that sets the sun in the tree which
is the city of gold.
In Europe this particular line of allegory gave rise to the search for the
Philosopher's Stone and the related fountain of youth/elixir of life, which
brought immortality. As is by now obvious, this is the fountain of wisdom
that flows from God and endows men with salvation and eternal life. The
alchemists sought to distil the hypostasis — the quintessence of creation.
The aquisition of the



260 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
lapis elixir (Philosopher's Stone) was achieved by taking a certain mineral
water — the words of God — and purging it of all that is dark, thick,
opaque and nebulous (evil, fantasy and untruth) and thereby aquiring the
materia prima. This essence, which you and I are distilling in this book,
comprises three fundamental elements: mercury, sulphur and salt. Mercury
is spirit and wisdom, sulphur is the soul and the sun, and salt is the essence
of the earth. These ultimately came together in the chemical wedding, the
unio mystica, which is one and the same as the wedding of the Templum
Hiero-solyma, the marriage of heaven and earth. Within the kerotakis
the alchemist's still — the elements comprising mind and soul were
separated, only to be reunited in the man who, through the alchemical
process, was remade — born again in wisdom. The rising of the sun in the
tree turned the base metals into gold. Even the idea that the evening and the
morning were the first day etc. played its part in this language. Each
evening at sunset the sun was seen to thrust deep into the earth and seed
her. The product of this union was Hermes Trismegistus. But ultimately the
great secrets of the arta hermetica would remain secret: God would strike
dead him who sought to reveal them. Only one man would sit upon the
Siege Perilous and live. Uncovering the theca ubi res pretiosa deponitur
was the task of this magus of the end times, who had been appointed to
reveal the process by which pure water confers eternal youth and life. It is
also noteworthy that at some point one branch of the Great Work chose the
allegory of the trade of stone-masonry, while another chose that of
metallurgy.
Everything we touch upon in this book is more than an ancient curiosity,
much more than something that has come and gone. We are walking on the
edge of the miraculous. Each find is a testimony to the genius of mankind,
its hopes, its dreams and its ambitions. Set in the background of a speck of
dust floating in space, man must be given credit for innate divine genius.
We are the flesh and blood descendants of a creature of genius and
inspiration. What has happened to that poetic brilliance? Is it not that by
our existence most of us shame the dead?
Through this entire project, logic has told me that there is no past,
present and future. That which was is; that which is will be; that which will
be was. We are all acting out a script that has already been written. Surely it
is time to hear the voice of the Old Ones and for the sleepers to awaken! Nil
nisi clavis deest.



THE STEPS OF VISHNU 261
Conclusion
We have now spread our net even further and made another wonderful catch of
mercurial fishes. Most important here is our view of the Teacher as Confucius: a
philosopher who changes the direction of mankind, a man of and in his time, the
near future. In a way we may loosely parallel this man with someone like Karl
Marx, who in a very short time changed the face of history with his philosophy. In
this instance, the change is positive and permanent; this time it is the will of God.
Perhaps the comparison should not be made so loosely because, according to
Scripture and the Scrolls, an historical Jesus would have been, and the Qumran
Community certainly was, communist. Perhaps Jesus the Teacher is influenced by
Marxist philosophy. Most likely being moved by the poverty and greed of his era,
Marx momentarily touched into his own feminine unconscious. We certainly should
not confuse Marxism with what later came to be known as Communism. We need
also to see that this philosophy was yet another purely masculine expression,
without feminine spirituality, and thus destined to be destructive and doomed to
failure. This certainly gives us a new view of what we term the political 'left' and
'right' — which, in a balanced society, should not exist. The male and female were
never intended to live in opposition, with continual struggle, mutual abuse and
conflicting points of view.
In our brief look at Hinduism we have established that it too focused upon the
cosmic tree; this implies an entirely new view of Buddha and Buddhism. I cannot
hope to make this volume anything more than an introduction to a vast subject;
nevertheless, if modesty will permit the comment, we do seem to have stumbled
upon some fundamental keys to religion and history.
At the beginning of this book I stated that Christ was originally a feminine spirit,
and I went on to relate this to the Goddess and, in fact, the feminine aspect of the
mind, the awakening of which is the development of Christ consciousness. This
point is one more example of my deep indebtedness to the writer John Michell,
whose books probably had by far the greatest influence and impact upon my initial
research.
When I first stated this conclusion regarding Christ I was not in a position to
substantiate it. Further, I mentioned earlier that the cabalistic number of this lunar
spirit is 1080 (see page 89). In terms of polarity, 1080 stands opposite to 666, but
together they create balance. With this point now established and with the
development of this argument due to progress, I am now in a position to show how I
formed my initial conclusion that Christ is feminine.



262 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
1. The radius of the moon is 1080 miles. 2.1080 is the numeric value of the Holy
Spirit 3.1080 is the numeric value of the spirit of the earth
4.1080 is the numeric value of fountain of wisdom
(Numerical values of the Greek letters are set out on page 220.) Furthermore, as has
been said, Jesus is a fish and Mary means 'sea'. She is the watery womb/word of
God in which he lives, and which he rises up from and fertilizes. As mentioned
earlier, the number of Jesus is 888; his mother, Mary has the
value 192; together they total 1080. These are just a few of numerous examples that
lead to an inevitable conclusion.
The reader may now probably be aware that, in recent years, a quiet revolution
has been taking place. Many like John Michell are doing more than their share of
helping to awaken the sleepers. Not only do we have the mounting evidence before
us, but there has been a steady growth of books, articles and debates in recent years
which say that we have got it wrong, that history and reality are considerably
different to present perceptions. Books such as The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail
(to which I shall refer later), City of Revelation, Early History of the Israelite
People and hundreds of others — including indeed The Thirteenth Stone — are not
written by cranks with a bee in their bonnet or a screw loose; nor do their authors
likely derive any pleasure from being contrary or sometimes bloody-minded.
Even the simplest of souls knows that reality has a nasty habit of catching up on
us. Surely, if only out of self-preservation, we need to consider that these
alternativists might have some reason on their side. If they have, and if they are
ignored, there could be a very high price to be paid by everyone. If they are proved
wrong on the basis of sympathetic consideration, rather than contrary and hostile
thinking, we shall all have gained from the experience. Blustering abuse and
arrogant outright dismissal are nothing short of mental assault and intellectual rape.
They are the act of a psychically frustrated man who, because he is unable to
experience the joy of giving and receiving in mutual love, can only indulge in
abusive intellectual intercourse. One can only feel pity for those entrenched
academics who make a virtue of their scientific and narrow-minded fleshly lusts.
Their libraries are filled with the pornography of mental masturbation and their
intellectual seed lies dead in their hands. Can such a perverted mind ever become
the father of truth? And what do you imagine these grubby little men are teaching
your children?



16
The Gospel of the Egyptians
Reality has a measure of elasticity, which we have all tested from time to
time. It can be stretched, but its violent return is commensurate with its
degree of distortion, as we have all discovered to our cost at some time or
another. Inasmuch as it constantly throws up different values which are
forever superseding each other, it does seem that it is locked into time. This
would imply that all things are true where there is no actual reality as such.
I cannot conclusively prove that the supposed historical Jesus actually did
not live, no more than anyone can prove that King Arthur or Hercules or
someone upon whom the characters were based did not exist in ancient
times. Yes, one can provide overwhelming evidence of the stories having
been mythologised, but to the devout believer all this is irrelevant. The
history of change and acceptance of new ideas suggests initial repugnance
and denial followed by gradual and grudging acceptance. Change is totally
abhorrent to human nature; life would never have evolved and progressed
of its own volition.
The fact is that my own theories on the origins and nature of Scripture
not only have historical precedent but may be said to have support in
significant quarters. But I cannot take the reader beyond the point of
choosing to believe that my interpretation of Scripture and the ancient
myths is more logical than any encountered to date. All my evidence is
circumstantial, even though it may be overwhelming. Logic and belief have
never shared the same bed. But the fact of the matter is that it is not for
detractors and heretics like me to prove that Jesus did not live two thousand
years ago: it is now for the Church to show that he did. It has never done
this beyond the accretion of fabled tourist traps in Israel where New
Testament events are supposed to have taken place.
Since the discoveries at Qumran many have dissented from traditional
belief. And we should remember that these discoveries followed the finding
of the Nag Hammadi documents in 1945. Together with the Scrolls, these
form a substantial corpus of very early Christian material. Being
specifically gnostic and dualistic, it points to the gnosticism of the New
Testament writings. Thus, they cannot be historical. The problem that we
heretics face is that the



264 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Church, even though it is decrepit and now lacking reason, still has
credibility with the masses and thus holds the middle ground. It can point
to its own history and authority, and thus the dissenters' case is lost. But,
because of all this new evidence, battle is once again engaged, reason is
battering at the door and the ancient and senile politburo of Rome must
eventually pay for the blood it has spilt in its lust for power and total
disregard for God. The coming of the Teacher will be the genesis of
Christianity and the nemesis and undoing of the Church, which will thus be
hoist with its own petard.
All events are consequential and causal. As the stone is cast into the sea,
new waves are forever striking the shores of human consciousness. To my
mind, the distortion of reality which has taken place in our age can only
have the one explanation.
With the arrival of modern big-brained man, there came a small number
of creatures that had both left and right awareness. Being intellectually
superior, they ultimately became the priests who controlled the planet, but
nature's object was that all should be like them. Eventually, under the
pressure which the extremes and excesses of our generation would create,
higher consciousness would evolve. That is to say that the apocalyptic
events that lie in the immediate future are themselves a psychological
pressure-cooking device. Having been created in this manner, our New
Israel will quickly become the dominant force, almost as though its
members were intellectually vastly superior beings from another world.
These, then, over approximately four hundred years, confine and eventually
eliminate the solely left-brained beasts. The Scrolls refer to these as the
times of ever-diminishing darkness. These events may be seen in the grand
historical picture as God (consciousness) continually thrusting and matter
resisting, not because it chooses to do so but because resistance is intrinsic
to its nature. This might be seen as a sort of cosmic copulation in which
new and higher life is constantly being generated.
The New Testament speaks of us as 'a wicked generation'; Nostradamus
refers to our time as 'a strange century' and 'the century of the sun', an age
of (666) bestial materialism. Interestingly, the coming years should bring an
end to any debate as to the reality or otherwise of a Creator. If there is no
God, then, as we are all becoming increasingly aware, the actions of
modern man will culminate in an end to life on earth, or at least to life as
we know it. If there is a Creator beyond what we perceive, He is our only
hope



THE GOSPEL OF THE EGYPTIANS 265
for the survival of a long-suffering world whose resources are finite. When
fish stocks are depleted, when land is grazed until it is dust, when global
warming melts the poles and the earth is flooded, I fancy our cries of
anguish will fall on deaf ears.
Most of the globe's major cities became such because they were port
cities in the days when international trade was mainly conducted by sea.
Thus, most of the planet's great centres of population are very close to sea
level. Also, the most fertile soil is found at low levels, where it is
constantly irrigated by rivers and retains rainfall. Therefore, even relatively
minor universal flooding on a prolonged scale could destroy civilization.
Those who fled to higher ground would starve to death. These events can
only be seen as a parallel of the destruction of the dinosaurs. There is no
religion: God has saved the 'righteous' because they have evolved; they are
such because they are His new seed. The unrighteous are now superseded,
and are so solely because of this. I would doubt that such an idea can be
understood unless we acknowledge that the entire earth is God's sole
property and He can do with it as He pleases. Only by the abandonment of
self-will can we become the stones the builder did not reject. We need also
to understand that, on a cosmic scale, we as individuals are insignificant.
Failing to see this is our undoing; accepting and becoming one with it is our
first step on The Way.
Apropos this evolutionary concept, the Nag Hammadi writings are much
more explicit than the Qumran Scrolls. In the light of our evidence and
conclusions this aspect is immediately obvious, particularly in 'The Gospel
of Thomas'. This collection of sayings and prophecies is given a very early
dating and reckoned to be very close to 'Q' (Logienquelle), a major
theoretical source of material for the Gospels of Matthew and Luke; it must
therefore have at least been known to the Essenes. The existence of the Nag
Hammadi codices and the Dead Sea Scrolls should, in theory, take the
middle ground from the traditional Church and demand that it prove its
argument: no more should it be the other way around.
The community associated with the Nag Hammadi library in Upper
Egypt was active long after Qumran had fallen. As Elaine Pagels points
out,28 the texts emphasize a Jungian-style approach to self-knowledge and
psychological development. But as time progressed, while the outside
world was rejecting the so-called heresy, each generation of proselytes was
of declining quality. It is not known precisely who this community were,
but the Gospel of



266 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Thomas29 makes it clear that, in the first century CE, there must have been a
strong link between the magi of the diaspora and others like the Scrolls
community.
This particular collection of oracles begins by telling us that whoever
should find the interpretation of the sayings will not see death. Let us then
see what you and I may achieve. It goes on to say, in logion 2:
Jesus said, 'Let him who seeks continue seeking until he finds. When
he finds, he will become troubled. When he becomes troubled, he will
be astonished, and he will rule over the All.'
This does not present any difficulty at all, and we may conjecture that the
man destined to make the discoveries is the latter-day Teacher, who must
be astonished at finding who he is and what he has found. Logically, the
Teacher is given temporary power over the All.
In the following saying we are given a clear indication of the macro- and
microcosmic tree as a part of an evolutionary process:
Rather, the kingdom is inside of you, and it is outside of you. When
you come to know yourselves, then you will become known, and you
will realize that it is you who are the sons of the living Father. But if
you will not know yourselves, you dwell in poverty and it is you who
are that poverty.
In logions 5 and 6 all things that have been hidden are to be uncovered.
The next saying is wonderful in its complexity and simplicity:
Jesus said 'Blessed is the lion which becomes man when consumed by
man; and cursed is the man whom the lion consumes, and the lion
becomes man.'
The lion is the sun which sits in the throat of the blessed man that
consumes it. The man consumed by the sun, the power of 666, is the
primitive animal who is cursed.
In logion number 8 the wise man is likened to a fisherman who made a
marvellous catch, then threw all the small fish back, keeping only a large
one — the serpentine wisdom fish, the Teacher.
In the following saying we see Jesus as Prometheus:



THE GOSPEL OF THE EGYPTIANS 267
Jesus said, 'I have cast fire upon the world, and see, I am guarding it until it
blazes.'
The fire he brings into the world is the sun in the tree.
Logion 11 is concerned with those of the Last Days who are the living
and those who are the living dead. It concludes:
On the day when you were one you became two. But when you become two,
what will you do?
This refers to the left and right hemispheres of the mind.
In logion 13 Jesus has measured out a bubbling spring, the word of God,
and thus revealed mysteries. Thomas is then asked by the disciples what
Jesus told him, and he replies:
If I tell you one of the things which he told me, you will pick up stones and
throw them at me; a fire will come out of the stones and burn you up.
Logion 15 is an injunction not to worship anyone born of woman, i.e. Jesus. In
logion 17 Jesus describes the mysteries he is to reveal:
I shall give you what no eye has seen and what no ear has heard and what no
hand has touched and what has never occurred to the human mind.
In logion 18 Jesus says that both his gospel and the evolutionary process
are to begin at the end: 'Where the beginning is, there will the end be.' In
logion 19 the stones will minister to the disciples, and those who become
acquainted with the trees of paradise will not experience death. In logion 20
he speaks of the mustard seed which becomes a great tree. Now the Greek
for 'a grain of mustard seed' is and its value is 1746. It
will be recalled that
the feminine principle has the number 1080 and the masculine 666. Their
total is 1746. So shall the prophecy be fulfilled. By the unification of these
two principles of the mind, our destiny is to become a great and fruitful tree
that grows from a tiny seed: the revelation of a rejected foundation stone.
According to logion 22,
Jesus saw infants being suckled. He said to His disciples, 'These infants being
suckled are like those who enter the kingdom.' They



268 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
said to Him 'Shall we then, as children, enter the kingdom?' Jesus said to
them, 'When you make the two one, and when you make the inside like the
outside and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below, and when
you make the male and the female one and the same, so that the male not be
male nor the female female; and when you fashion eyes in place of an eye,
and a hand in place of a hand, and a foot in place of a foot, and a likeness in
place of a likeness; then will you enter [the kingdom].'
This describes the evolutionary process perfectly as the right brain is
strengthened. It continues in logion 23:
Jesus said, 'I shall choose you, one out of a thousand, and two out of ten
thousand, and they shall stand as a single one.'
The rest are the Israel depicted in the Old Testament, which deserts to
the Antichrist. In logion 43 Jesus tells them:
You do not realize who I am from what I say to you, but you have become like
the Jews, for they [either] love the tree and hate its fruit [or] love the fruit and
hate the tree.
The Teacher is Jesus, but nobody recognizes him in the guise of the
revealer of the cosmic tree. Not knowing this man quite clearly indicates
that his message is unexpected and that he does not formally reveal himself,
as is exactly the case with the New Testament character. We should not
look to him; what he says is far more important. In logion 44 Jesus and
Christ are specifically separate in that blasphemy against the Father and the
Son may be forgiven, but not the blaspheming of the Holy Spirit (compare
Matthew 12:31-32).
Logion 58 describes what I termed a pressure-cooking process:
Jesus said 'Blessed is the man who has suffered and found life.'
And this the Teacher knows, for, as a suffering servant and man of
sorrows, he himself has been pressured and become Nostrada-mus's man
with a complete brain. In I Kings 19 the Teacher in the form of Elijah
collapses from exhaustion after three years of apprenticeship in a secret
place. After receiving sustenance, he spends forty days in the wilderness, as
Jesus did in his temptation; likewise Moses and Israel were in the desert for
forty years. In logion 61 Jesus confirms the left and right hemisphere
concept by saying:



THE GOSPEL OF THE EGYPTIANS 269
I am he who exists from the Undivided. I was given some of the things of My
Father.
He continues:
If he is [undivided], he will be filled with light, but if he is divided, he will be
filled with darkness.
In logion 62 Jesus confirms himself as one who reveals mysteries.
In logion 66, with due respect to the cabalistic significance of
numbers, reference is made to the stone the builders rejected, the sun
which is signified by the number 6.
In logion 77, if we 'split a piece of wood' (the tree) or 'lift up the
stone', Jesus the Teacher will be there. Logion 80 is yet another
interesting play on words, as the second 'body' is the internal tree. It
says:
He who has recognized the world has found the body, but he who has found
the body is superior to the world.
In logion 91 the kingdom of the Father is likened to a woman carrying a
broken jar filled with meal (wisdom). By the time she got it home
(the end of our age), it was empty. This broken jar is the false
religion the Teacher exposes, it having become empty of wisdom.
In logion 100 Jesus is specifically not God inasmuch as that which
is Caesar's must be given to Caesar, that which is God's should be
given to Him (compare Matthew 22: 21; Luke 20: 25); and it
concludes '... and give Me what is Mine'.
In logion 101 Jesus makes specific reference to the Queen of
Heaven as his mother (his feminine mind), saying:
Whoever does not hate his father and his mother as I do cannot become a
disciple to Me. And whoever does [not] love his father and his mother as I do
cannot become a [disciple] to Me. For My mother [gave me falsehood], but
[My] true [Mother] gave me life. (Compare Luke 14: 26.)
He receives life from the Goddess of the thirteenth stone. Logion 105
is interesting:



270 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
He who knows the father and the mother will be called the son of a harlot.
This has two possible meanings, as is often the case with this type
of material. The son of a harlot can be an alternative for the son of
the widow, but it may be recalled that the Teacher might actually be
the son of a prostitute. Pure speculation.
In logion 108 Jesus is again the revealer of mysteries:
He who will drink from My mouth will become like Me. I myself shall
become he, and the things that are hidden will be revealed to him.
In another document from Nag Hammadi, attributed to Mar-sanes
(also Marsianos), we have a very fragmentary apocalypse which
begins with an introduction to the seals (stones):
[The eleventh] and [the twelfth] speak of the Invisible One who possesses
three powers and the Spirit which does not have being, belonging to the first
Unbegotten (fern.). The thirteenth speaks concerning [the] Silent One who
was not [known], and the primacy of [the one who] was not distinguished.
The one not distinguished is the Teacher, the stone the builders
rejected, which is also the eleventh (sephirah) with three powers.
In 'The Testimony of Truth', another quite fragmented text, we
find reference to the Son of Man/Teacher perfecting himself as he
balances the hemispheres of his mind. He overcame the thoughts of
the archons and the powers of demons. He cleansed his soul from
the transgressions which he had committed 'with an alien hand'. He
then 'turned toward the parts of the right' (hemisphere) 'and he
entered into the truth, having forsaken all things pertaining to the
left' (hemisphere). He is then filled with wisdom and understanding
and breaks open all his bonds. In speaking of the Teacher's rev
elation, it says (37):
[They do] not [know] the power [of God], nor do they [understand the
interpretation] of the scriptures [on account of their] double-mindedness. [The
mystery] which [the Son of Man spoke about...]
He is said to be a disciple of his mind, and in this sense we may see that the
Father and the Mother are respectively the left and



THE GOSPEL OF THE EGYPTIANS 271
right hemispheres of the brain. His being born of a virgin makes him
spiritually born of Coma, his virgin right hemisphere.
We also see in this document the idea of the suffering servant as
presented by the Qumran scrolls. It says that he begins to keep silent within
himself. He does not participate in disputation and simply endures. This is
in keeping with the New Testament Jesus and can be verified by our own
findings in that, from his point of view, he can only leave the dead to bury
the dead: his sole task is to awaken the sleepers. It goes on to say that he is
patient; he also makes himself equal to everyone but keeps himself
separate. And he bears witness to the truth. His foreknowing of the fall of
events must influence his attitude. He is like a lamb led to the slaughter
who does not open his mouth (compare Isaiah 53: 7).
Antiquity's greatest collection of books, no doubt witnessing a long
history of gnostic learning, was at Alexandria. Late in the fourth century of
our era it was razed to the ground by Christians who, with their simplistic
idolatry of Jesus, had no more need for knowledge. If they were to establish
that theirs was the original gospel, they had to eliminate any previous
history. This brings to mind the modern cultural revolutions and the
genocide of Joseph Stalin's regime. Events such as these have been regular
occurrences in human history, and they do not sit well with the idea of man
as an intelligent animal. But it would seem that these beasts only succeeded
in digging their own pit and will lead themselves to their own destruction.
It will be recalled that I mentioned earlier a group of gnostics called the
Karaites. I suggested that they may have influenced and might even have
been the warrior monk leaders of the tribal federation that came to be
known as the Khazars, the ancestors of the modern Ashkenazic Jews.
Looking at ancient gnostic and dualistic thought through its documents
on a grand scale, as has been done in this instance, is fraught with
problems. It is far too easy to make tenuous links between disparate groups.
I should also like to make clear that I do not suggest that Qumran was some
kind of epicentre from which all the shock waves spread. The only real
significance we can give to the Dead Sea community is that it is for us the
source of very important finds. Yes, Qumran would have been of major
significance in the preparation of the Gospels, but many such communities
would have been involved in the venture. Let us also remember that both
the Qumran Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi library were hidden so



272 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
that they might be found; here I am suggesting the influence of an external
occult element.
As mentioned earlier, one of the central themes of the Scrolls is the
community's calendar, which was unique to Qumran. It is recorded and
hidden in the book of Jubilees, which is of known Essene origin. The
Scrolls say that God did not listen to the petitions of men and despised their
holy festivals and sabbaths because they were celebrated on the wrong
days. It is not until the coming of the Teacher that the true times are known,
the calendar being obviously a part of his revelation. This matter of
revealing the correct measure of time is not confined to the Scrolls, but is
moderately common in myth generally. For example the Egyptian Hermes
recorded and established the calendar after receiving instruction in divine
truth from the great dragon (the sun). He was then given a commission to
preach his gospel to all men. Some, he was told, would understand and be
saved; others would not and be damned. Daniel, it will be recalled, was told
that, come the revelation of Scripture in the Last Days, the righteous would
understand and be saved and the unrighteous would not comprehend and be
lost. It is obviously a revelation which is beyond present-day man but
comprehensible to the new spiritual humanity.
The holy days of Qumran were also adhered to by the Karaite
movement, which appears much later in history than the Essenes.
Among the Dead Sea finds were fragments of a text titled 'The Damascus
Rule'. These proved to correspond to a document already known, one that
had been found in the geniza (store room) of an ancient Cairo synagogue in
1896-97. This synagogue, it transpired, had belonged to a Karaite
community.
Before we leap to any conclusions, it should be said that the dating here
is far too late for us, and, besides, there is a simple explanation. In The
Dead Sea Scrolls: a Reappraisal30 John Allegro points out (pages 177ff.)
that, around the beginning of the ninth century, yet another Arab shepherd
boy had stumbled upon a cave in Jericho where scrolls had been hidden,
this having been reported by Timotheus, a Syrian Metropolitan of Seleucia,
at the time. Timotheus says he heard that these documents contained Old
Testament quotations in the forms in which they appear in the New
Testament. It is at about this point, as Allegro reports, that we first
encounter the term 'Teacher of Righteousness'.
These discoveries had a major impact on the Karaite movement of the
time and effectively revitalized it, so much so that it in turn



THE GOSPEL OF THE EGYPTIANS 273
had a considerable impact on mainstream Judaism. This order is supposed
to have been founded in Baghdad in about 765 CE by Anan ben David.
Such a late date is probably mythological, but this does not matter from our
viewpoint: it was quite clearly a regrouping of an ancient organization. The
Jericho scrolls did not reshape Karaite thinking: they reinforced already
central beliefs. Looking for connections between, say, the Qumran Scrolls
and the Nag Hammadi documents is easy but unnecessary because these
disparate groups were all descended from the same universal mother
movement.
It is clear from the evidence available to us that one pointer to our
coming Righteousness Teacher will be his insistence upon adherence to a
new measure of time.
Genesis 1:14 reads:
And God said, let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the
day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days,
and years...
The luminaries are to be for the day and the night, and this all occurred
on the fourth day. Logically there could not have been any life on earth
until the sun and moon were created. If we assume that the choice made by
Judaism of Sunday as the first day is correct, then Wednesday is the fourth,
and this would become the first day. This, then, makes Tuesday the seventh
and sabbath day. On the basis that days are measured by 'the evening and
the morning', the sabbath would start on Monday at sunset. But this
presupposes knowledge of the actual first day. It is arguable that the sun's
day (Sunday) was the last day of labour — the setting of the sun in the tree
— and thus, Monday may be the sabbath. Certainly, in Australian
Aboriginal tradition the sun was the last thing created. Everything had been
made but was in darkness. It was Emu, who at that time had wings to fly,
who suggested there should be light and colours in the world. She was
derided and finally tricked into losing her wings, which made her a prisoner
on earth. She avenged herself by tossing a brolga's egg into the sky; thus the
sun was born and there was light in the world. The tradition that the
Goddess gave birth to the sun and that it was a final act of creation is a
common one. This would certainly favour Sunday as the sixth day and
Monday as the sabbath. Accordingly, in Century 2:28 Nostradamus tells us
that the Prophet will take Monday as his day of rest.



274 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
We can now also fully understand that the god portrayed in Scripture is
the sun. In his old form he is the dominant male of Pisces, Jehovah/Jesus,
with the unfettered power of 666, the Antichrist whom the Jews would
worship. He is superseded by Ishi (meaning: my husband), the sun rising in
Aquarius (refer Hosea 2:16), husband to the Goddess who is then a living
entity.
There is one common bond between the Qumran Scrolls and the Nag
Hammadi Library, and it is a most interesting one. Were these documents
predominantly religious, they would give prominence to the Messianic king
instead of the Teacher. But both are mainly concerned with the gatherer
rather than the Prince of the Congregation. It is as though this man must be
given all moral and public support. The important point is not that his role
is over-emphasized but that support for him indicates a more pragmatic
than religious basis to these documents. But how can we really know when
it is all ahead of us? For myself, there is still far too much that this book
leaves as speculation. One should not put too much faith in the work of
one's own hands. But nevertheless we should feel encouraged when we
expand the horizons of that which we do not understand. Perhaps, when all
our answers each raise a hundred questions, we may be deemed wise. For
myself, I can affirm that the contents of this book have vastly increased my
awareness of my own ignorance and incompetence in fully comprehending
the very strange events that were set in motion 2000 years ago.
Like so many other writers I am bound to say that at some point this
book took on a life of its own. No longer having the form I envisaged, it
simply demands from me what it needs to manifest itself in time and space.
Its genesis lay in one individual's fascination with the ancient myths and his
chance encounter with a volume relating to the discovery of the Dead Sea
Scrolls. Eventually these two separate interests meshed and there began a
voyage of discovery. I had blindly stumbled upon a secret, not knowing it
was supposed to be so. But all this pales into insignificance as the book
progresses.
I am aware that I have acted more as an editor than someone making an
actual discovery. The material I have gathered is not in itself new but the
gathering forces new and radical conclusions. Clearly I am not the first to
reach at least some of these conclusions, and when it came to publishing
them I was brought up short by the stark reality that the Devil does not
brook dissent. Although, as I believe, this book contains little that is not
already



THE GOSPEL OF THE EGYPTIANS 275
known by a select few, there are none who will speak publicly. I am aware
that my own efforts are evocative of David and Goliath but I am not fazed
by this. Monjoy is the heap of stones, monjoy the mountain of God and
'Monjoy!' the battle-cry. The simple reality is that, now, the gap between
the known circumstances behind the major religions and what is generally
believed is so great that sooner or later someone must step into the breach
and point out the obvious.
Superficially this work is an investigation of the past; in reality it is a
journey into the future. The ancient shamanistic magi who created the vast
panoply of mythology we have inherited were solely concerned with
mapping the evolution of consciousness. That which we call God was to
them awareness progressively manifesting upon our plane. I doubt that they
would have had any problems accepting the modern big bang theory: this
could well have been the first step in the manifestation of this becoming in
our dimension of time and space. And life's long journey from single cells
to the dinosaurs and beyond would also, I think, have come as no surprise
to them. They would have perceived these many stages as thrusts of
consciousness, the progressive manifestation of God. They might even have
drawn a parallel between the sudden destruction of the dinosaurs and the
apocalyptic destruction of the majority of mankind, which they envisaged
as new life springing from death — this being just another thrust to greater
awareness, dispensing with bestial and insensitive modern man and
replacing him with a more profoundly spiritual creature. In this form of
thinking, religion and science become one; the doors of perception are
opened and there is no borderline between the realms of the body and of the
spirit.
This consciousness can be seen to have a spectrum of its own, in which a
stone may hold not only the least of the gifts of being but also the greatest.
Thus the spectral circle is completed and there is no distinction between
extreme heat and extreme cold.
I am, in a sense, able to read this book as if it had been written by
another. It has opened my eyes and I am obliged to say I am dismayed by
the sight I see. Global warming and nuclear holocausts fade into
insignificance, plague and pestilence are now mundane. Western man is
rapidly becoming a walking mindless corpse who has sold his soul to the
devil we call progress. A creature who cannot think independently has no
humanity; he is a beast who shuns education and thereby surrenders his
freedom. So



276 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
much are we already enslaved to demonic progress that many cannot
compute simple transactions without the aid of a calculator. Man has
abandoned his freedom and thus should head the list of the earth's
endangered species. The late Martin Luther King told us he had been to the
top of the mountain and had seen the New Jerusalem; mechanistic
Mammon destroyed him because he was free. But I put it to you, in the
words of Don McLean, that it is better to die on your feet than live on your
knees. Unbeknownst to us, with the subtlety of serpents, the Cythrawl is let
loose and now only a lion can save the Dagda's children. Though Arianrhod
sleeps, I doubt that a child of so noble birth will be allowed the degrading
and ignoble death which modern man embraces as a sailor at landfall
running to a poxy whore. If this book has taught me nothing else, I know
now that the sleepers will awaken and the song of songs shall once again be
sung.
Over the years I have come to love God only slowly and with difficulty.
It is part of the reason why I am setting down the things that I have
gathered here, making, as it were, a heap of all I can find. I can only strive
to tell the truth as I see it, though many will think me a heretic. The fact is
that I now fear God far more than any critics.
I consider my feeble walk toward Him as if it were an attempt to enter a
stone and finger the chasms of its mind. My hands encounter darkness and
my eyes see with a sight not my own. My fingers are touched by the wind
and my feet washed by the sea. My thoughts are now one with the stone
and they grip the white brow. I am learning the secret of the birth of the
stone. Somehow, the spikes of the iron crown spur me on. I come face to
face with the Lord of the Lock of Hair and am moved to fear and wonder.
But the Lady quietens my shaking limbs and my bowels; her beauty and
serenity give me courage. I am reminded that Abraham was a rock and
Israel a heap of rocks, and am mindful that Prometheus stole fire (the sun)
from the gods to illumine mankind. It would have been shortly after this
time that God gave to the people a pure language, that they might call upon
the name of the Lord. By which the harper's music might reach up to the
Araboth.
I can remember as a child feeling a great sense of wonder at the idea that
a few words and numbers can carry a letter to one particular person in one
specific place, perhaps on the other side of the world. Now I am amazed
that just 26 letters and 10 numerals can, in competent hands, convey all the
secrets of God.



THE GOSPEL OF THE EGYPTIANS 277
Oh that I could infect you with the sense of wonder that I have come to
feel. Only then could I rest my pen and hand knowing I need not fear the
Judgement. It is terrible to know, and even more terrible to know that you
know, of the infinite combinations and endless cycles derived from twelve
signs, seven planets and a stone. These forces, which man believes he can
reduce to nought, are of infinite power. Aware of neither good nor evil,
they are of the High Magic, and only the Old Ones truly know them.
One is told that the pen is mightier than the sword. I wonder how this can
be, when both have led men, in equal number, into folly. The writer writes
to people he does not know. Curiously, in this instance, only the reader can
truly say if this volume is an introduction to wisdom or to foolishness.
Either way, the High Magic is unmoved; we are left to cry out in the
anguish of darkness to the Most High.
Nature, they say, abhors a vacuum. Likewise, man, an amazingly
efficient predatory opportunist, exploits every need for his own advantage.
It is arguable that man as we know him today is a relatively recent
phenomenon. That is to say that, while we may have advanced
technologically, we are morally in decline, and have been for the past six
thousand years. These circumstances may well be cyclical and related to the
ongoing motions and disposition of the heavens.
There is probably no more constant and reliable market than religion.
From the merchant's point of view, this particular trade is a godsend. The
gullibility of the customers is legend and the market is limitless. In my
opinion, there is no area of human activity where charlatanism abounds as it
does in this instance. But let me assert that I do not distinguish between the
astrologer and the Catholic priest, or the rabbi and the snake-charmer.
Religion is a business which is controlled by massive international
conglomerates. As a whole, the system is in reality self-serving and cynical.
Quite simply, it parallels and is part of the general state of degradation
which mankind and its environment now face.
It follows that in a godless universe a book such as this does not justify
the author's efforts. For in such a world mankind and its environment are
doomed: as a species we are not worth saving. But to my mind there is a
God — probably quite different in every respect to the forms in which He
has been imagined — and this God governs and renews the never-ending
cycles of decline and regeneration. Thus it may be said that my own
standpoint is that I hold all



278 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
religion in absolute contempt but I do have a quite childlike and immature
awareness of a reality beyond my grasp. For these reasons I need say that,
in theory, I know so little about the Creator of All that I can do nothing
more than acknowledge His absolute and certain existence and devote
myself to a discussion on comparative religion, which is a totally different
matter. But we need to ask why comparative religion, as a form of
scholarship, exists.
Its task is to examine the sacred, and this no other discipline can do.
Whether that sacredness is found in monotheism or even tribal totems is of
no concern: the object is to understand those things which mankind has and
does invest with holiness. Whether a religion results from strictly human
agency or is divinely inspired can never be answered by any sort of formal
investigation. The best we can ever hope for is an environment which is
tolerant of dissent. Conceivably — and this ignores any possibility of
divine will — had the authors of the New Testament not fed the literature
and its cultus into the Roman system, Jesus would by now be as obscure as
he was in his supposed lifetime. Realistically, it seems to me sensible to
acknowledge that the events leading up to an almost universal acceptance
of otherwise obscure and inconsistent writings such as the Hebrew
Scriptures must be the result of both human and divine agency.
Both Christianity and Judaism maintain an international following which
has spawned a very substantial industry whose task it is to substantiate the
Bible's claim to historicity. In recent years, scientific advances and
archaeological finds should, in fact, have brought matters to a satisfactory
conclusion. The reality is that the Old Testament as an historical document
simply will not fit. Since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the New
Testament can be made to fit very comfortably, but only an entirely new
and, for most, unacceptable paradigm. What the industry of modern schol
arship is at present attempting to do is to ignore these new factors which
now threaten to ground its kite. In so doing, the practitioners hope to be
able to continue the infinite and absolutely meaningless debates in which
they are so expensively engaged. But, as history will demonstrate, the Bible
obviously had, and has, a quite prominent cabalistic or occult element
because the record is strewn with groups, both large and small, that derived
esoteric philosophies from Scripture — groups such as Freemasonry. As we
are seeing, the entire book, from Genesis to Revelation, is pure cabala, and
for this reason we not only can, but must, ignore any debate as to its



THE GOSPEL OF THE EGYPTIANS 279
historical veracity. The simple reality is that it is totally impossible for the
sixty-six books of Scripture to be both records of events which appear to
have occurred and at the same time a collection of occult cabalistic
writings. The two are oil and water; they simply will not mix.
So saying, in my view the success of Christianity as an international
conglomerate lies in the genius of those who seeded it in Rome, which in
turn fed it into Byzantium and western Europe. Later, the imperial success
of England not only expanded the frontiers of Christianity Incorporated, but
actually used Jesusology as a means of conquest and subjugation. This
international corporation is engaged in manufacturing a product, and we are
the consumers. In our environmentally conscious world we need to ask if
this spiritual junk food should carry a health warning. Rome has made of a
life-giving resource a product to poison and destroy the children of the
Queen of Heaven, whose property it truly is. But just as the ancient empires
and their gods were the phenomena of their age, so were Rome, Byzantium
and England, whose gods will fade into obscurity with them. But,
curiously, we might argue that these deities do not die but reincarnate. The
wicked and jealous queen may well have poisoned the apple, but the
beautiful princess is only sleeping. One day soon her prince will come and
awaken her with a kiss, and together they will drive evil from the land.
In one respect these gods have been seen as archetypes emerging from
the unconscious along with universal symbols such as the cosmic tree.
Another concept that fits this genre is the universal flood. The fact is that,
as yet, no religion or discipline of any kind has been able to explain
satisfactorily the constancy and universality of these archetypal legends. I
believe my conclusions resolve this problem and succeed in finding the root
from which most legend and religion springs.
James Frazer's classic The Golden Bough takes both its title and its
theme from a Roman legend in which the new priest kills the old. This
succession centres around the plucking of a golden bough; likewise Jason
must capture the Golden Fleece. Both of these are symbols of a new sun
rising in the cosmic tree in a new age. In my opinion, nothing can ever be
inserted into the ring; there are no beginnings and no endings; things appear
when we perceive them. Thus, if this book succeeds in elucidating hitherto
unresolved problems, it only does so as a result of adding to the work of
Frazer, Graves and many others. It is worth noting — and I speak



280 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
in hindsight — that people like Frazer were working in a much more
conservative and hostile environment. Furthermore they did not, as do I,
have at their disposal the vast body of material which has come to light in
recent years. In my own case, the Dead Sea Scrolls were central to the
forming of my theory. And let me add, as an aside, that in using the term
'myths' I speak of 'in the beginning' as opposed to 'once upon a time'.
Mythography and comparative religion not only have long since
established a considerable element of similarity in the belief systems of the
entire ancient world, they have discovered basic elements common to all.
This, in contradiction to the known and accepted historical record, suggests
that many thousands of years ago there existed a universal religion shared
by every tribe on earth. Furthermore, it has not gone unnoticed that these
same elements have formed a foundation for the Judaic and Christian
Scriptures and their apocrypha.
But all this hard-won understanding has been completely ignored by the
Church, which, like the tobacco companies, still insists there is no real
evidence of the weaknesses and dangers of its product. The Dead Sea
documents contain the same basic elements as the ancient myths, such as
the Cosmic Tree, the Great Flood, a sun god/hero/creator/bringer of
wisdom and a divine king who reinstates the Golden Age. Only a fool
would, at this juncture, ignore the evidence and try to stretch reality even
further. The writings of Qumran are unique insofar as they present this
material in a mundane and historical fashion: it is all recorded as very
believable events which could be slotted into the Palestine of the dawn of
our era. If so, the New Testament and the Scrolls are fakes and failures,
without claimed inspiration. This begs the question as to whether these
writings are the product of genius or of foolishness. Though few if any
scholars will publicly say it, there can now be absolutely no question that
the Jesus of the Gospel of Luke and the Righteousness Teacher of the
Scrolls are one and the same character. Thus these texts not only link
modern religion and ancient myth, they also clarify those myths and create
a psychological environment in which legend can be observed as events in
a regular world.
At some stage in the investigation, one is faced with the reality that these
epics were in no way haphazard constructions. On the contrary, the unity
and sophistication are astonishing. Thus we find ourselves having to accept
an ancient globe with a unique and unified system of belief of such
complexity as to belie the idea that



THE GOSPEL OF THE EGYPTIANS 281
our ancestors were primitive in any sense. Furthermore the entire story, as
epitomized by the legendary Jesus and the epic told by the Scrolls, does not
fit at all into the historical context it has been given. However, it fits
perfectly into the present time. In fact it slots in so well that, once inserted,
it cannot be removed. All this does not require a leap of faith or a leap of
any sort: once seen, it is eminently logical. Unfortunately, if we set these
stories in a modern context, there is no limit to what they touch. Because it
is their correct setting, a global picture suddenly springs to life. And this, in
itself, is evidence supporting my argument. The sole problem is the
massive paradigm shift required. They do not simply alter our perception of
the past: they radically change our conception of the present socio-political
environment, as we shall see.
Another point to be made also relates to the question of historicity. It is
one that was made earlier and is absolutely central to my thesis. The ancient
world evolved its beliefs along the lines of pagan dualism. In these
cabalistic systems, numbers and letters were sacred; they were, in fact, the
means by which the Logos uttered the sounds that brought about creation.
In such a system, only the priests had access to them. In Palestine the
Essenes, who are conspicuously absent from Scripture, were these
cabalistic holy men. It is my belief that, because they retained the sole right
to literacy, they were able to manufacture history and did so with impunity.
I suggest that it was by their power, their genius and God's will that they
were able to paint the historical picture we have received. I am also certain
that this was done according to the highest ideals, the object being to
transmit their knowledge across our age to their spiritual children, the
people of the New Jerusalem. This would be held secret until the time
when, like lemmings, our generation would begin running toward its own
destruction.
From our privileged vantage point we can visit a setting in future time,
an event known and remembered from the beginning of creation, the
moment when two heroes step out of the never-ending story and onto the
world stage to establish an eternal Golden Age. Emerging from
insubstantial legend and fairytale, these two men will utterly alter the
course of human history. From the beginning, they have lived in the
unconscious as a memory of the future. We have met them many times
together and alone. They are the sons of the widow, the first to open the
womb at the end of the dreaming when the making was done. And it is at
the end of this making that mankind will explore inner space, the final
frontier.



282 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
This and the coming generation of mankind live at a critical point in
human evolution. Only the children God chooses will know the eternity of
the word. He is absolutely just and honourable, and will measure out to us
with interest whatever we ask. Our asking is done by our deeds. The lies
we tell ourselves do the most harm, and cause those we tell others. We
need to learn that truth and reality are relative to time, and that it is a
transient illusion in which the body, but not the spirit, is fixed. Whether it
be our present environmental, social or religious problems, it is absolutely
imperative that we see that we as individuals are an intrinsic part of the
whole. We must also acknowledge, as individuals, that we have stretched
the elasticity of reality to breaking point. Not only will the subsequent
catastrophes fall upon our neighbours, we shall not be able ourselves to
view the apocalypse on television.
The increasing problems which you and your family face exist because
you have done nothing about them. They are there because of your mental
and physical laziness. You have allowed someone else to do your thinking.
From what you have read so far in this book and from the present state of
your world, you must admit that he could not be entirely trusted. The truth
you will never escape is that the fault is yours. You have allowed a dog into
the manger who will not eat of the body of the Christ child, nor will he
allow you to do so.
Right or wrong, you cannot deny the earnestness and honesty of my
intent. I did not acquire what you have before you by any sort of occult
revelation, nor am I more than you, intellectually or spiritually. This book
is the product of vast amounts of time and large amounts of money; it
exists in the real world. If I compare the struggle I have faced and that
which you have ahead of you, I know that my burden is light, relatively
speaking.
Our world is a wonderful and dreadful place. It is filled with danger for
the unwary, particularly for those who insist on passively consuming the
garbage and poisons which our society produces in vast amounts. And you,
you eat by choice from the gutter and wonder why you are sick. Is it so
wearisome for you to raise yourself to the table? To illustrate my point, let
me put to you a matter of pure speculation. The origins of the AIDS disease
are unknown, but in just a few years it has become a universal problem
affecting the lives of ordinary people. It is, by its very nature, the type of
disease that could have been developed as a form of biological warfare.



THE GOSPEL OF THE EGYPTIANS 283
AIDS could have been the result of an experiment gone wrong. You do not know
and neither do I; but my postulate is plausible. This is not only so because of the
actual possibility, but because you must acknowledge that you have lazily
surrendered power over your own life. God, as I understand matters, only helps
those who try to help themselves. The great division of humanity that is almost
upon us is that between the living and the living dead. Truth to tell, each of us must
make his Grail Quest alone.
Conclusion
We have seen some clear examples in ancient documents supporting the idea of
spiritual evolution, the balancing of the two hemispheres of the mind. We may
conclude that the spiritual birth of Jesus the Teacher in a stable implies his evolving
in a world of left-brained beasts. Accordingly, in the Genesis creation God made
Adam at the end of the sixth day, after He had created these beasts, over whom He
made him to rule. I contend that this first man is a version of the Teacher, and that
the end of Pisces is the conclusion of the sixth day and the creation of Homo novus
(Israel).
It may be noted that nowhere in Scripture can we get any idea of the time of
Jesus' birth, for, as the Scriptures say, even he will not know the hour of his coming;
only God knows.
More importantly, in this section we have, via the theoretical 'Q', made a tentative
connection between Qumran, the community of Nag Hammadi and the Karaites,
who I suggested earlier may have been the warrior monks who founded the Khazar
empire, from which sprang modern Jewry. At this point a little reason has been
brought to belief. The idea of a chosen race proclaims salvation for good and evil on
the one side and damnation for good and evil on the other.
I have also indicated that what we term 'God' in Scripture — and this one God
has many names — is in fact the sun as it passes through the zodiac. Consequently,
our New Israel will establish a new calendar; it will almost certainly be introduced
by the Teacher. It should be realized that, as things stand, our calendar is
astronomically out of date. We still open the zodiac at 0° Aries, whereas, according
to my tenuous calculations, we entered Aquarius as of 1993-4. Thus there is an
actual justification for a realignment of the feast days.
In an area such as religion, where preconceptions are firmly fixed, I admit that
many of my arguments are tentative, but the reader must allow that this entire
volume can only be treated as an introduction to a vast subject. On the basis of
reasonableness, my arguments are firm.

Helene and Ogmios
Greek civilization not only bequeathed to us its vast pantheon of gods; it
also gave us many of the fundamentals of modern science, mathematics,
democracy, art and philosophy. That is well known. Equally well
established is the fact that Greece was steeped in gnostic and pagan
tradition, to the degree that its contribution to what we now know as the
hermetic sciences is probably the most substantial of all. Research on the
Scrolls has confirmed that it was to the Pythagoreans that the Essenes gave
their most respectful nod.
The evidence now shows that there was never any longstanding Hebrew
culture in Palestine and that, at the time of the traditional setting of the
New Testament, the land was primarily Greek in its culture and traditions.
Accordingly, the New Testament is written in that tongue. But it is not, as
one might expect, written in some classical form, but in koine, which is a
low form of the language. This becomes self-explanatory when we realize
that only koine allows the Pythagorean to trade sound for number. This
point is fully explained in the relevant appendices to this book.
Knowing all this, we may now climb Olympus, where we shall find that
the heroes and goddesses of Greece conform to our story. As a source for
the following analysis I have relied mainly upon The Greek Myths by
Robert Graves.11
In the Pelasgian creation we find the Goddess in the form of Eurynome.
Having no place to rest, she divided the sea from the sky, then danced
towards the south, which is the position of Aquarius upon the tree. The
disturbance she caused by her pirouettes was a wind of creation. It came
from the north, which is the location of Scorpio, the false thirteenth sign.
This being a fire sign, its association with Aquarius suggests a creation
through fire and flood. It should be noted that, upon the tree, the signs have
different natures to those that are commonly assigned to them. From this
north wind she created the serpent Ophion, who later in Hebrew myth we
find in the role of Jehovah/Jesus. This serpent later angers Eurynome by
accrediting creation to himself, as was the case with this presumptuous god
in the Bible.
By her dancing she aroused him; he coupled with her and she became
pregnant. Ophion is a solar deity, and his being aroused or



HELENE AND OGMIOS 285
awakened brings about the creation of man. That is, Eurynome
subsequently laid the universal egg which Ophion hatched. This creature
does seem to be the negative Piscean sun, which in Scripture is
Jesus/Jehovah, the egg being the thirteenth stone.
Eventually, in her anger at his claims, she kicked out the serpent's teeth
and banished him to the Underworld. These teeth are, of course, stones. The
first man she created was Pelasgus, ancestor of the Pelasgians, the Teacher,
ancestor of Israel. It was he who brought knowledge to the people.
Graves says that the Sumerian name of the Goddess was Iahu. This title
later passed on to the Hebrew Jehovah and on to Jesus, the root of whose
name can be recognized as this.
The Pelasgians, Euripides says, later adopted the title 'Danaans'. They
claimed birth from the serpent's teeth, the stones in the cosmic temple; Dan,
it will be recalled, is Scorpio. Danaus had fifty daughters, who we shall
encounter in due course.
In most myths, creation sprang from chaos. The revelation comes in the
Last Days; Israel is born amid chaos.
In the story of the dethronement of Cronus we find he has married his
sister Rhea, the goddess of the sacred oak. Because it had been prophesied
that Cronus son of Uranus would be overthrown by one of his own sons, he
swallowed his children as his wife bore them. Cronus is Pisces. Rhea,
though enraged, bore a third son, Zeus, in Arcadia. His being a 'third' son
will explain itself in a moment. Zeus was foster brother to Goat-Pan whom
we shall later see is the Christ. But, most importantly, Rhea bore him in
secret and fostered him out. Isis did a similar thing with her son Horus. The
infant Zeus was kept in a golden (solar) cradle which hung from a tree. This
was done so that Cronus might not find him in heaven, earth or the sea.
Rhea had wrapped a stone in swaddling clothes and her husband swallowed
it, believing it to be their son. That is to say, in the Piscean era mankind had
the tree with ten rather than eleven sephiroth, and without the thirteenth
sign. It will be recalled that ten sephiroth accommodated twelve signs and
the extra sephirah makes room for the thirteenth.
Growing up in hiding among shepherds (magi), Rhea gave her son the
task of being Cronus's cup-bearer. She then gave him an emetic potion to
administer to Cronus with his honeyed drink, after which he vomited the
children he had swallowed. They came out in reverse order and unharmed.
First, of course, came the stone, which is likened to Zeus. Hence he is the
sun, lord of the heavens



286 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
and chief of the gods. On the principle of he who is last shall be first and he
who is first shall be last, his brothers are then the Star and the Sceptre. Zeus
then leads them in the war against the Titans, who choose Atlas as their
leader because Cronus (Pisces) is 'past his prime'. The defeat of the Titans
is achieved by hurling stones at them. They were finally put to flight by a
shout from Goat-Pan, Christ, the Spirit of the Golden Age. The stone that
Cronus swallowed was set by Zeus in Delphi, where it became an oracular
solar rock. The Titans must then be those who did not believe the Teacher,
the seekers after smooth things.
In the tale of Zeus and Metis the Titaness, she changed shape many
times to avoid his sexual advances. Here Metis is the goddess of the ten
stone tree in Pisces who did not want to mate with the sun. He eventually
caught her and she became pregnant with a girl-child, Coma, who is later
his concubine as well as his daughter. Zeus was later warned by an oracle
that if his wife became pregnant to him again she would bear a son who
would depose him, as he had done with Cronus and Cronus had with
Uranus. This process is the sun travelling through the ages — the king that
must die to be born again. Zeus coaxed Metis to a couch and swallowed
her: without the sun, or eleventh sephirah, there can be no thirteenth sign of
the Goddess.
In due course, while walking by the shores of Triton lake, this fiery god
developed a thunderous headache. So great was his anguish that the whole
of the firmament echoed to his rage. The problem was divined by Hermes,
the Teacher. With wedge and beetle, he made a breech in Zeus's skull.
From this sprang Athene, leading us into the bull cults, which we shall look
at separately.
Many creation myths speak of part-fish, part-man creators — men of
mercurial wisdom. All this is woven around the concept of the earth in
Pisces, the fishes. Thus our two heroes are fishermen who spring from the
Piscean sea. In the earth's 'Last Days' in that constellation, they father in
wisdom the children of Aquarius. The story of the birth of Aphrodite,
goddess of desire, fits this theme very well. It even contains the recurring
motif of lost genitalia.
Aphrodite was born of the foam of the sea, and rode naked in a scallop
shell. After much wandering she came to reside in Pathos on the island of
Cyprus. She is said to have sprung from the foam which gathered around
the genitals of Uranus when Cronus threw them into the sea. It is also held
that Zeus begot her of Dione, daughter of Oceanus and Tethys.



HELENE AND OGMIOS 287
It will be recalled that Cronus was the sun in Pisces. Here, since there is
no use for the genitalia of the tree, they are cast into the Piscean sea.
Aphrodite then arises from this ocean as an aspect of the Triple-Headed
Goddess. Her being begotten of Zeus from the daughter of Oceanus makes
her the granddaughter of a fisherman of mercurial wisdom raised up by
Zeus, the sun.
Zeus coupled with the mother of his son Dionysus in the form of a
serpent. It is also said that he begot Dionysus of Semele, the moon
disguised as a mortal. There is here no contradiction: the sun would as a
serpent go down to the genitalia of the tree. Semele the moon comes closer
to him by one stone when the new star arises. And if he is to beget his
mortal sons, he must at least look human.
This story concludes with Hera, the jealous wife of Zeus, suggesting to
the now pregnant Semele that she should ask her secretive lover to reveal
his true identity. This he refuses to do. But she denies him access to her
bed, and he comes at her in the form of thunder and lightning. She is
consumed, but her son Dionysus, who is the Sceptre, is saved by Hermes
the Star in a wonderful way. He sews the baby into Zeus's thigh, from
which he later delivers him. Hence Dionysus is the 'twice born', or child of
the double door. Thus he is Arthur, the once and future king, and Jesus,
born — in theory — two thousand years ago and to be born again in the
Golden Age in the form of the Sceptre. Dionysus grew to be a soldier of
great repute, and he appears again in our story when he encounters a man
who could see all things in relation to the new sun in the cosmic temple. He
could, in fact, turn everything into gold.
Old king Midas has given us the term 'the Midas touch', for everything he
touched turned to gold. This was because he set the golden sun in the tree.
He was the son of the Goddess; in this instance her name was Ida. He was
king of the Brigians/Moschians, whom Graves associates with the Mushki
(calf-men). But what about the Latin 'musca', the fly, and Beelzebub the
Lord of the Flies? Is there some link here between sacrificial bulls' blood
and Jesus the Teacher, out of the Taurean stars, making the sacrifice of his
blood of the new covenant? Flies appear where there is heat and
decomposition. A link with Jesus/Jehovah seems plausible.
Jehovah can be traced to Boreas the god of the north wind. Graves
associates him with the bull-god Baal Zephon, which indicates that this
Antichrist is also a Taurean. His mother was Baaltis Zapuna. He was a
deity in Goshen, attributed to Joseph (the sun) and his



288 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
tribe. He was lord of the northern underworld, and to the Philistines (the
worshippers of Jesus) he was a god of fertility — the phallic fish rising
from and fertilizing the virgin Piscean sea. He then became Baal-Zebul the
lord of the northern mansions which Graves tells us named the tribe of
Zebulon, which is Virgo, and is 'by the sea'. In Matthew 10: 25 Jesus is
said to have been called 'Beelzebub'. In Matthew 12: 24 he is said to cast
out devils by Beelzebub, a logical Christian response to his revelation.
Midas had a famous rose garden. The rose is sacred to Aphrodite, from
which we derive the word 'aphrodisiac'. She is queen of the genital stone.
Occult or pagan Christian groups such as the Rosicrucians have thus
adopted the rose and the cross as their insignia. Interestingly, when a girl
loses her virginity she is said to have been 'deflowered'. The female
member, and females as a whole, are likened to these thorny flowers.
Like Noah in his conversing with the Lord of Righteousness, when
Midas was an infant, ants climbed his cradle and fed him grains of wheat,
from which we must assume he later made bread (wisdom).
Silenus, a drunken soldier of the army of Dionysus, fell asleep in Midas's
garden. He later told him wonderful tales of a continent across the Atlantic
Ocean where there could be found an advanced civilization that lived in
beautiful cities. This story later influenced Christopher Columbus. He also
told of two trees which could be found beyond a whirlpool where no human
could go. These we can assume to be another version of the Piscean and
Aquarian trees. They grew by two streams. The fruit of the first caused
those who ate it to weep and pine away. The second brought the joy of
youth but caused men eventually to return to their birth time and disappear.
That is to say they entered Coma's womb and were born again. These are
the same as were in the Garden of Eden. Jehovah/ Jesus permitted eating
from the tree of life and sorrow but forbade the tree of knowledge.
Dionysus, grateful to Midas for taking care of Silenus, granted him a
boon that everything he touched might turn to gold. Midas had it in mind
that he might turn 'stones into gold'; however everything he touched,
including his food, which obviously was fish or bread, was thus transmuted.
Furthermore, his flowers were changed, and 'his house' (the temple) and its
furnishings (the sun) were also magically changed. He eventually washed
away his golden touch by bathing in the river Pactolus.



HELENE AND OGMIOS 289
Midas went to Asia, where he was adopted by the childless Phrygian
King Gordius. It seems that while Gordius was only a peasant he received
an omen of his future reign when a royal eagle perched on his ox-cart. It
will be recalled that the ox is a symbol for Coma and the eagle is Scorpio,
the false thirteenth sign. In Galatia he met a prophetess on his way to the
oracle. She offered to help him make the proper sacrifices to Zeus, but he
would only accept if she agreed to marry him. Meanwhile the existing king
of Phrygia had died childless and the oracle informed the populace of the
city that their monarch and his queen were approaching, seated on an ox
cart, the tree with the thirteenth stone.
The cart and its yoke were then dedicated to Zeus. The yoke was tied to
its pole in a manner so complex that the oracle announced that he that
untied it would become king of Asia. This knot was tied with letters, or
sounds, and is extremely difficult to unravel.
It happened that Midas was present at a musical contest between Apollo
and Marsyas. As Graves tells us, this contest was judged by the river god
Tmolus. Midas dissented when the decision went in favour of Apollo, and
was punished by being given ass's ears. These are in Hebrew mythology a
sign of kingship. Israel and Judah are also referred to as asses in Scripture;
hence to have asses' ears might imply being able to hear the word of God.
The ass (athon) is a symbol of endurance. In Numbers 22 the Lord speaks
through one of these beasts. Thus Samson (shimsha is the sun/Star Teacher)
uses the jaw-bone of an ass (the word of God from the Taurean stars) to
destroy the Philistines (false Christians). In Job 1: 14 the oxen are plowing
while the asses are feeding. That is, the king is listening while Coma is
speaking. In Zechariah 9: 9 we have the prophecy:
Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem:
behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and
riding upon an ass...
In Matthew 21 Jesus is made to fulfil this prognostication when he rides
into town on an ass.
Midas manages to hide his ears, except from his barber, the 'hair cutter'.
The sign Coma is depicted as a copious head of hair.
In similar myths of this kind, the Goddess often makes a personal
appearance. We may find her as a girl locked away and forced to spin straw
into gold. That is to say she is imprisoned in the Piscean Age and, being
without wisdom, must use straw rather



290 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
than ears of corn to make the gold of the sun. In the story of Snow
White we have the albino mother of a man who is the albino
Teacher, with the seven dwarfs (planets) actually doing the digging
for gold. Likewise Gautama — the Buddha — entered into his
mother's right side (his own right brain) in the form of an albino
elephant; these are said to have long memories. In the case of
Goldilocks and the three bears, 'Who's been eating my porridge?' has
the porridge representing bread. And the beds of the bears are in the
tree, in which — in Pisces — Coma has no place of repose of her
own. The bear is an important symbol, which we shall deal with in
due course. Let us, at this point, pick up the next thread of the story
with Hercules, who is probably the best known of all Greek heroes.
He is even found depicted among the stars as the third decan in
Scorpio. He was the son of Zeus and began his life as Palaemon. His
name was changed (like Jacob's to Israel) by Phoebus Apollo
because his fame, he said, would come from Hera, the astronomical
mother of Coma. See also Nostradamus 2: 28.
In discussing the twelve labours set out for Hercules by Eurys
teus, Graves points out that the first, fourth, seventh and eleventh
can be associated with the four cardinal signs of the zodiac. He also
identifies him with Orion, who, to the Aborigines of Western Aus
tralia, is the bringer of the serpent of creation, the phallic fish who
brings his wisdom seed in the music of the rainbow. We earlier saw
these four signs in the first chapter of Ezekiel, where the tree
becomes the fiery wheels of dancing stones.
In his first labour, our hero is to slay and flay the Nemean lion,
whose pelt is proof against iron, bronze and stone. This we can
presume to be the sun in the ten-orbed Piscean tree. This beast is
said to have been created from sea foam by Selene, enclosed in a
large ark. When Hercules came to slay it, he arrived at midday, and
the lion, like the sun, had left no tracks for him to follow.
At this juncture some verses in Genesis 49 may be seen with new
clarity. In verse 5 it is said that Simeon and Levi are brothers.
Simeon is Pisces, Levi is Libra, the earth; hence these events are
occurring when the planet is in the sign of the fishes. It goes on to
say that instruments of cruelty are in their habitation. In verse 6 they
slew a man who must be the Teacher. Superficially they were
avenging the dishonouring of their sister Dinah, the moon. The
Revealer of Mysteries exposes Coma, the genitalia. Obviously, in
Pisces she had either lost them or been deflowered. Thus in verse 7
Simeon and Levi are to be divided in Jacob and scattered in Israel.



HELENE AND OGMIOS 291
In verse 9 'Judah is a lion's whelp', the new son of the sun. In verse 8 he
is the one who his brethren (the other stars and stones) will praise. His hand
is in the neck of his enemies. The letter 'yod', it may be recalled, is a flame,
the sun. It also means 'hand'. Hence the sun of Leo belongs in the neck of
the old tree, that of 'his enemies'. It is then that 'his father's children shall
bow down' before him. In verse 10, 'the gathering of the people' will be
'unto him'. There is an indication of the Star and Sceptre in verse 11. First
there is a foal bound unto the vine, and then an ass's colt unto the choice
vine. It will be recalled that the ass is a symbol of royalty and that God
speaks through this creature.
In verse 12 we have what again sounds suspiciously like a reference to
an albino, for his 'eyes are red with wine'. In verse 22 we come to the all
important Joseph, the sun. Here he is described as a fruitful bough by a well
whose branches run over the wall. The Almighty will bless him 'with
blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings
of the breasts, and of the womb' (verse 25). In verse 24 his bow (the
rainbow) 'abode in strength'. And 'from thence is the shepherd, the stone of
Israel'. Likewise, in Japan the rainbow is the Boat of the Heavenly Stone. It
is also referred to as the Stairway to Heaven — a Jacob's Ladder. This same
stone that sits in the throat is elsewhere referred to as the 'truth chakra'. That
is to say that setting it in its place reveals the truth. The sun in the throat is
the 'Adam's Apollo', which gives voice to the spirit of the Teacher's
revelation.
Having slain the lion of the tree of ten sephiroth, Hercules must logically
slay the corresponding snake, which in this case was a hydra, a water snake
of the Piscean tree, which I identify with Lilith and Jehovah as the
Antichrist. She had the body of a dog and, possibly, fifty heads. Simply
cutting one off only caused two to grow in its place. Thus 'burning
branches' were used to sear the roots. These were gathered from a corner of
the grove which was set alight, obviously by the new sun. Hydra's only
immortal head was part gold. This Hercules cut off and buried beneath a
stone.
Having demolished the old tree, he then captured the Goddess in the
form of the Ceryneian hind. He pursued her for a year and finally caught
her asleep beneath a tree. Elsewhere, he would awaken the Sleeping Beauty
with a kiss.
Having captured her, Hercules must apprehend the Erymanthin boar,
whom Graves identifies as 'Son of Apollo' and whom I identify as the idol
Jesus (the son of the Piscean sun), a fierce, enormous



292 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
beast. It haunted the cypress slopes of Erymanthus, and Mount Lampeia in
Arcadia, and ravaged the countryside of Psophis. Hercules captured the
boar alive; it was killed at a later date, and this is confirmed by
Nostradamus. It was caught at midwinter, which indicates his Christmas
birth, and Graves (in this instance) identifies Hercules with Horus, who
avenged his father's death.
Our hero must now cleanse the tree and the world, which become the
stables of Augeas. Along with the surrounding country, the stables had not
been cleansed of animal dung. The stench did not affect the animals but
spread a pestilence throughout the Peleponnes, an apt description of the
world we live in today. He achieved his task in one day by diverting the
rivers Alpheus and Peneius (redirecting the words of God).
Likewise, this Greek god must chase away the Stymphalian birds, which
Graves identifies with ibises that breed in the Arabian desert. With the
capture of the Cretan bull (the seventh of the labours), we have exactly the
same story as that of Ephraim and Manasseh. In. this case Hercules the
Teacher is 'of the bull'. He gives it to Hera, the wife of Zeus. Like Jesus, he
offers himself as a sacrifice, the bull sacrificed for the sin of the world. In
the form of the Antichrist, Hera sets it loose. Eventually it is caught by
Theseus the Sceptre and sacrificed to Venus. The Goddess (in Pisces)
rejects the Teacher and takes the Sceptre as her consort (in Aquarius).
In the twelfth and final labour, he must capture the apples of the
Hesperides, the golden apples of the sun which are three in number — that
is, earth, moon and Coma. He achieves this, as is the case with every myth
of this genre, by raising the sun in the tree. The tree belonged to Hera and
its fruit was being pilfered by the daughters of Atlas, the Hesperides. Atlas,
as I have said, was the champion of the Titans (Pisceans). Graves quotes
Pliny, Natural History, V.5, as saying that this labour took place in the far
west at Berenice. It will be recalled that Coma is in the west wall of the
tree. Coma was the hair of princess Berenice, the wife of Ptolemy, for
whose safe return from war she offered her tresses in the temple. They
'went missing', and she was subsequently told that the gods had set them
among the stars. One cannot imagine the quality of entertainment if we had
scriptwriters of this calibre today.
Graves says that Hercules the Dactyl was associated by the Gauls with
Ogmius, who invented the Ogham alphabet and all bardic lore. He says that
according to Irish mystical tradition the



HELENE AND OGMIOS 293
chase of the hind or roe was the pursuit of wisdom which could be found
beneath an apple tree.
As Orion, or Urion, our hero is not god-born but earth-born. A boon
granted to Hyrieus, a poor childless farmer, by Zeus and Hermes, brought
about his birth. They told the farmer to sacrifice a bull, urinate upon its
hide and bury it in his wife's grave, and from that Urion was born. The
name means 'to make water'. Thus we have a firm cycle which takes into
account all aspects of the Teacher. It is not uncommon to find the Revealer
of Mysteries as a man who was pissed upon, or used by the gods.
Of the manner of the death of Hercules, Robert Graves in The White
Goddess (pages 125-126) forms a reconstruction from a variety of legends.
One particularly gruesome method has him made drunk with mead and tied
in the five-fold bond to a T-shaped oak. This tree is, because of its
longevity, a traditional British symbol for the cosmic temple. As a cross, it
is set in a circle of twelve stones. In front of it stands an altar stone. Thus,
as the Teacher, he is sacrificed to the Goddess of the thirteenth stone.
Having been bound to the oak, he is beaten until he faints, then blinded,
flayed and castrated. He is impaled with a mistletoe stake, then hacked into
joints upon the altar. His blood is then collected and sprinkled upon the
tribe to increase vigour and fruitfulness. The joints are roasted on twin
fires: it will be recalled that I divided the tree into two circles. The fire must
be kindled from the oak itself, which is then uprooted and used to feed it.
Twelve merry men then rush into the circle and dance in a figure eight
around the flames. They obviously represent the living dancing stones. The
men then tear at the burnt flesh with their teeth which are again two
symbolic circles. All of the remains except his head (the sun) and his
genitals are burnt. Graves points out that the head is sometimes preserved
for oracular use. It will be recalled that Apollo the sun/dolphin was an
oracle. Among the feats with which Hercules is credited is his causing the
spurt of milk that became the Milky Way (in Taurus). It squirted from
Hera's breasts.
The treatment meted out to our hero is, of course, symbolic; it would
otherwise suggest a considerable measure of ingratitude on the part of
Israel. Interestingly, it does seem that there is an actual rather questionable
survival in this tradition.
In Britain a tor is a sacred hill, and we have associated the Teacher with
ancient bull worship. In Spain the bull is El Toro, and it is this same bull
Hercules which is regularly slaughtered at bullfights.



294 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Graves says that to this type of hero belong such diverse characters as
Orion the Hunter of Crete, Hercules of Oeta, Polyphemus the Cyclops,
Samson the Danite, Cuchulain of Muirthemne the Irish sun-hero, Ixion the
Lapith, Agag the Amalekite, Romulus, Zeus, Janus, Anchises, the Dagda
and Hermes.
Hercules was, like the Teacher, a miraculous child who was born in a
shower of gold: he rises up with the sun in the tree. In keeping with his
birth being a spiritual one, his cradle, as with Moses, was a boat that floated
on the word of God. Therein he strangled a serpent, obviously the one that
guards the thirteenth stone. In his youth he achieved great fame as a slayer
of monsters. As I have said, the Teacher must slay the monster/idol Jesus.
And, like the Teacher, it was this hero who took on the world burden of
Atlas.
In combining these legends one finds the same theme constantly repeated
and often new elements introduced. The direction of the story can often
depend upon the region from which it is sprung. One constant theme is that
of female betrayal, as in the case of Samson the Danite. The tribe of Dan is,
as has been pointed out, the sign Scorpio, which was considered the
thirteenth sign and associated with death. The demise of our hero usually
comes from this female betrayal. One wonders how much of our story is
pure myth, and how much is mythologized aspects of the actual Teacher's
life.
But ultimately Hercules rose up to heaven, and there the Goddess of
Wisdom — as Graves tells us — introduced him into the company of the
Immortals.
This is a concise life not only of this hero from Olympus, but also of the
Teacher. Be he Hercules, Samson, Jesus or Moses, he is the suffering
servant who is named and famed by the Goddess of the stone; single
handed he returns the earth to her possession. Sadly, the scale of this
material requires a paradigm shift of Herculean proportion, even though the
basic principle is simple. History, it would seem, is a shadow cast by the
future.
Zeus ordered Deucalion's flood because he was angered by Lycaon, who
had 50 (or 22) sons. The 22 brings us a step closer to Nun the 50 because
22 is the number of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, with which the yoke
and the cart are knotted. It also happens that 50 + 22 = 72, and that was the
number of letters in the sacred name, which was set to music, and, as has
been said, the dance in a figure eight is the tree as two circles of dancing
stones.
This divine music was placed in the care of Orpheus, a perfect



HELENE AND OGMIOS 295
parallel to the scriptural David, who was king for a mythical forty years
(the desert wandering). Orpheus was the son of the muse Calliope; he
received his lyre from Apollo the sun. With his music he could not only
enchant wild beasts but cause trees and rocks to move from their place. He
visited Egypt and then joined the Argonauts, who were seeking the Golden
Fleece, the sun in the tree. He later married Eurydice, whom Aristaeus tried
to rape. She stepped back on a serpent and died.
With the Goddess killed by her own serpent, this story now has a means
of sending the Teacher, as Orpheus, into Tartarus to fetch her back.
With his music he charmed his way into the Underworld. He temporarily
stopped the torture of the damned, and won leave from Hades to return
Eurydice to the land of the living. This was agreed to on the condition that
he did not look back until his wife was safely under the light of the sun.
This, at the last moment, he failed to do, and so he lost her. Hence we are
told that the Queen of Heaven is not for him but for the Sceptre. This brings
to mind the story of Lot's wife, who became a pillar of salt when she looked
back on the destruction of Sodom. This theme is indeed universal, but it
does not easily give up its secret. It may well indicate some last-minute
faint-heartedness on the part of our hero.
Later, Orpheus preached that Helios (the sun) was the greatest of all the
gods, and was priest in the temple of Apollo. Again, the Teacher sets the
sun in the tree and subsequently reveals the truth. He was murdered by the
Maenads, who were later turned into oak trees. Orpheus's head was thrown
into a river and later attacked by a serpent, which Apollo turned into a
stone. Graves tells us of another version of his death. Orpheus had
instituted the mysteries of Apollo in Thrace, those of Hecate in Aegina, and
those of Demeter in Sparta. Zeus killed him with a thunderbolt because he
revealed the mysteries of the gods. Nostradamus says the Teacher is shot (a
thunderbolt).
According to Scripture it was sin that brought death into the world. The
Phoenix is much more poetic and symbolic in its explanation. The universe
cannot sustain its vigour indefinitely. It must die that it may be reborn with
renewed strength, a process that any keen gardener is more than familiar
with.
Poetically speaking, the Piscean Age might well have been a necessary
time of decomposition. The myths we are examining are then the dormant
seed; the Star is the first shoot to press its head



296 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
above the ground. In the mean time the weeds have been growing, and this
first shoot must compete with them. The Sceptre is then the later but still
young growth of a tree that through the ages will achieve perfection,
though, perhaps in some future time, to be cut down again.
But the Scriptures and the Scrolls would deny this. They insist that, once
the new Plant of Righteousness is established, the times of darkness will be
ever-diminishing until the end of the world. It is, perhaps, then that the
cycle begins again. Eastern tradition strongly supports this idea.
It is difficult to say if man values human life too much or not enough.
Externally, he dispenses with his brothers with ever-increasing efficiency.
Internally, he has no alternative but to put a very high price on his own
earthly existence. He can never be certain of what lies beyond, and has no
guarantee of coming back. Thus, man is understandably perplexed when
told by prophets that the crimes he commits to preserve and enrich his time
on earth, which is relatively miserable, only deprive him of the life to come.
In this macro-microcosmic cyclical scheme, the tree that died two thousand
years ago had gone through a process of decay in the previous ages. The
once all-powerful priests of Egypt and Babylon were now reduced to a
remnant. Nevertheless, its decaying and rotting branches were absolutely
essential to the new growth. The last vital sign in that plant was the dying
sun at the end of Aries.
It is clear from the Odyssey that this dying star was embodied in the
person of King Agamemnon. He was murdered by his wife, Clytaemnestra,
who even by her name is made to be the genital queen of the tree who
wishes no longer to be aroused by her husband, the sun.
King Agamemnon was mighty, and received tribute from many. He
made war against Tantalus the King of Pisa, killed him, and forced his
widow Clytaemnestra to marry him.
When Paris (the Teacher) abducted Helen (Coma) he provoked the
Trojan wars. At this time Agamemnon had been absent from home;
Aegisthus remained at home in Argo (the tree). While he was away,
Aegisthus planned to seduce his wife and to kill him with her assistance.
His hopes were high because Agamemnon had killed not only her husband,
Tantalus (Taurus), but also the baby at her breast. As we see here, the
Goddess and the sun go through continual death and reincarnation as they
pass through the zodiac, each time taking a different form. The pair



HELENE AND OGMIOS 297
decided also to kill Cassandra, the prophetess, who was Agamemnon's
mistress.
When he returned home his wife welcomed him and he was bathed. As
he stepped from the bath, instead of wrapping him in a towel she threw a
net over him and trussed him up like a fish; Aegisthus then cut off his head.
Graves gives him an alternative death, with Clytaemnestra giving him an
apple: with the fruit at his mouth she slays him. But this comes to the same
thing: if he is wrapped in a net like a fish, that means he is to be superseded
by a fish; if he is about to eat an apple (swallow a stone), the end is that he
dies on the tree.
Mythology comprises astronomical symbols which can, both in
macrocosm and microcosm, date the events of which it speaks. As a
general rule it hides its prophetic elements by inviting the reader to see the
events as history. This is exactly what we have seen in Scripture.
Mythography, the science of unravelling myths, works largely by tracing
the family tree of words, names and the concepts behind them. One such
word and syllable which has largely been ignored is 'ar'. It is a variant of ad'
— before — and of the adjective-forming suffix 'al', a variant often found
under the influence of spelling in cognate Latin nouns such as 'collar' and
'vicar'. It is also commonly found in nouns of agency such as 'beggar' and
'liar'. Ara is a southern constellation in Sagittarius. It is an overturned altar
of fire. An arc is an unbroken part of a circle; it is also a luminous bridge
between two electrodes, and it describes the movement of a heavenly body.
Arca is a chest for storing valuables. Arcane is hidden and secret. Arcas
was the son of Zeus and Callisto; he was the progenitor of the Arcadians,
and we shall return to him. Argo sailed to Colchis in search of the Golden
Fleece, the Sun/Lamb/Teacher and word which is the Star. We also have
Noah's Ark and the Ark of the Covenant, which both, like the Argo,
represent the tree, as has been explained. Arcadia is then a type of Eden.
Returning to Areas, his name means 'bear'. The Arkades were the
Arcadians, the people of the bear. Artemis and Arduina, who was her Gallic
counterpart, are bear goddesses.32 The Welsh word 'arth', as in King Arthur,
means 'bear', and this was the name by which this hero was affectionately
known. It will be recalled that 'artos' is bread, and thus wisdom. This gives
us a wise bear.
In the sign Cancer there are two decans, Ursa Major and Minor, the Great
and Little Bear. Ursa Minor now holds the pole star,



298 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
which once upon a time was in Draco the dragon. The ancient weavers of
myth have not hesitated to make much of this point.
In the blessing associating the tribes with the zodiac in Genesis 49,
where I have identified Cancer with Issachar, it says (verses 14-15):
Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens: And he
saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed
his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.
There is nothing here that would justify our linking Issachar with
Cancer, but there is one clue which immediately stands out as a
contradiction. If the zodiac was created by the ancient priests, and this at
least we must be agreed upon, they would never have put a crab in or on
something sacred. It is a scavenger and thus unclean flesh. Bullinger
agrees.33 He points out that in the Dendera zodiac this sign was a scarabeus
beetle, which in Egypt was the symbol of kingship. Much later it was
associated with royalty in general, much as was the ass.
In the Dendera zodiac this sign is called Klaria, the cattle-folds. Earlier
zodiacs give these stars to Hermanubis. The Greek 'karkinos' and the Latin
'cancer' both mean encircling. 'Ker' or 'cer' is Arabic for encircling.
Bullinger also gives the Akkadian name of the month of Cancer as Su-kul
na 'possessor of seed'. In the centre of the sign is a very bright nebula
known as the 'Beehive'. The bee became synonymous with the
Merovingian royalty of France. The Egyptian 'apis' means both 'bull' and
'bee', and Abraham is Taurus.
North and south of this nebula are Asellus Boreas and Asellus Australis,
the northern and the southern ass. Jesus makes both his entry and his virtual
exit from this world in their company. They would have been with him in
the manger, and he rode into Jerusalem upon one — which, as I have said,
is a symbol of kingship. There were also shepherds in the area of the
manger, keeping watch over their flocks by night. My mention of the
cattlefolds will be recalled, as will two other points: 'shepherds' is another
name for magi; and the Israelites are asses that become sheep.
Bullinger finds that the name of an individual star often reflects the
original name or meaning of the constellation. He points out that in Ursa
Major the brightest star is in Arabic called 'Dubheh', a herd of animals.
'Dubah' means 'cattle', and in Hebrew 'dohver' is a fold. In Chaldee the
same word means wealth. The Hebrew 'dohveh' means security. He goes on
to say that in Hebrew there



HELENE AND OGMIOS 299
is a word very similar in sound though not in spelling: 'dohv', which means
'bear'. Related are the Arabic 'dub', and the Persian 'deeb' and 'dob'. He
considers there may have been some Greek confusion over Hebrew
'dohver', a fold, and 'dohv', a bear. My own interpretation is that this is a
pun and not human error.
Again, Bullinger points out that in Job 9:9 and 38:32 Ursa Major is
mentioned as 'Ash'. In the Authorized Version it is termed 'Arcturus and his
sons'. In the Revised Version it is 'the bear with her train'.
The association of King Arthur with the ark I take to be well established;
I have here pointed out other associations, not least of which are Ursa
Major and Minor. All this so far is quite logical and not new. Furthermore,
the same would apply to the constellations Cancer and the lesser and
greater bear being an ass between two sheepfolds. My main concern is with
drawing a general picture relating the royal ass with Jesus and Arthur and
the sheepfolds with Judah and Israel — again, reasonably logical. But what
about 'dohv' the bear and the Arabic 'dub' and 'deeb'? While I appreciate
there is an apparent contradiction, it is tempting to see in this the origin of
David the shepherd king, that not being David the Teacher but the royal
lineage, the shepherds or priest-kings. It is particularly noteworthy in this
respect that 'dabar' means 'oracle'. It may be that Cancer is the astrological
birth sign of the Sceptre, just as Taurus is that of the Teacher. But the bull
is Abraham and the Jews are his 'spiritual' sons. Could it be that his
'bloodline', the House of David, may be traced through 'apis' — the bull and
the bee?
Conclusion
I did not encounter Robert Graves's The White Goddess until after I had made my
initial finds. I had simply been plowing in different ground, my sole concern being
the relationship between the Scrolls and Scripture. When I read this book, it came as
much-needed reassurance that I would not be alone in the asylum. The White
Goddess also served to bring sharply into conscious focus my awareness of the
universality of this material. Had I read the book earlier, my task would have been
made very much easier.
A section such as this one could take weeks, probably months to prepare, but
with Graves's Greek Myths and Goddess by my side the task has been completed in
just a few days.
To the serious student of myth it may well have become apparent that our two
diagrams of the tree — the ten- and eleven-sephiroth versions



300 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
resolve the mystery behind a large body of tradition. Familiar themes are the
wounded king whose realm becomes barren and the despot who supersedes a just
ruler. The female equivalent is either a wicked queen or a death crone. The hag is a
very important aspect of the Goddess insofar as she is the driving force of creation
— it is she who insists that we evolve or die. The negative idol Jesus is very much
her male counterpart.
We see that the stone (sun) removed from the throat of the tree brings about
desolation in the kingdom. The king may be wounded in the thigh or genitalia,
which is of course the effect of removing the stone; or he may lose his wife — who
never dies, but is often abducted and sometimes raped. Basically, when the
tree/king is wounded, his kingdom is barren because of the absence of the wisdom
and love of the Lady of the thirteenth stone. This realm is then ruled — in the
Piscean Age — by either a weak king with a tyrannical (sorceress) wife or a tyrant
sun king with the proverbial power of 666, the sun who has dominated the feminine
in Pisces. In the Arthurian matter, Merlin the Teacher procures the thirteen treasures
of Britain from their owners and brings about a restoration. Each of these treasures,
as in Genesis 49, has an association, though an obscure one, with the zodiac and the
tree. All in all, it is a great cycle of death and resurrection — destruction for the
purpose of creation.
The reader may now begin to grasp the vastness and unity of this story. Mount
Olympus has proved to be made of stones, and its vast pantheon has been reduced
to two heroes among their brothers, the stars.
We may now see a universality springing from our initial simple find. It is clear
at this point that the material goes beyond an individual's power to invent or
imagine it. Had I been in error, even partially, we should have stumbled before
reaching this point. One must ask what forces were at work to allow this ship, with
its precious cargo, to sail silent and unseen by most for two thousand years across
the Piscean sea.
We are looking at ancient myths and legends, which, surely, are only a diversion
for us today. Pretty harmless stuff really. But what if all this — and so much more
— were accurate and true? If truth it be, after all, we shall inevitably have to face it.
Consider, if you will, what such a realization would imply. Can you think of one of
today's so-called first degree realities that would not be radically altered by these
fairytales from our superstitious past?
A few moments' reflection will give us some grasp of the hostility that a revealer
of these mysteries would face. Perhaps after three and a half years he will thank the
gunman who takes his life. After all, can any man stand so entirely alone? Reach
into your own humanity and ask yourself that question.



18
The Rock of Islam
At various times, despite Christianity, the ancient traditions had many a
flowering in our age. Not least of these was the development of
independent religious thought in the tolerant environment of Islamic Spain.
At that point in time the civilized world was Islamic. Europe was just
beginning to emerge from the Dark Ages, and it did so with its own brand
of youthful arrogance.
History, seen from a distance, paints a picture of the ebb and flow of the
tide. The present global picture in many respects reverses the roles being
played a thousand years ago. The modern Arab nations have seen a massive
population explosion; thus, in countries such as Iran, Islam is a militant
faith for a youthful populace which displays similar religious devotion to
that of the emerging empire-builders of Europe. It is estimated that by the
year 2020 this religion will represent 25 per cent of the planet's human
occupants. The demographic decline, and the consequent deterioration of
the economies of the West, can be directly attributed to contraception,
sterilization and abortion.
Setting prophecy totally aside, these factors alone tell us that we should
expect a wave of Islamic development and growth in the not too distant
future. It would seem a simple matter of a tide turning, just as it would
otherwise eventually turn yet again. But this should only concern us if we
see matters from a tribalistic viewpoint, in which case the outcome is totally
predictable. It results in a scene of canine savagery with absolutely no
aesthetic value. Flesh is torn to pieces, blood flows like water and the
females are impregnated by the dominant pack. This massive explosion of
negative energy is concerned only with force seeking to conquer territory
and women. In this negative explosion of 666, the gentle sex eagerly awaits
its violent submission to the dominant males. This is the basis of wars, as
history has repeatedly shown.
Tradition tells us that Muhammad was a sorcerer who created a white
bull which terrorized the local population and then miraculously appeared
with a copy of the Qur'an floating between its horns. Such stories would
have been the propaganda of the time. Invariably we find that religion seeks
to express externally that which it senses internally. An albino bull would
have had a



302 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
definite impact upon the unconscious — Christians defending religious
territory.
Much of what we term cabala had its flowering in the bosom of Islam,
where it drew on both Jewish and Arab tradition. At this time Jews fled
from Christians to seek protection in the Arab world. The term 'cabala' has
come to mean many things; like the major religions it has often been taken
off into the realms of fantasy. It was originally the hidden science, hokmah
nistarah.
Nothing is ever quite what it seems; God moves in mysterious ways.
Mecca, the birthplace of the prophet Muhammad, was an essential part of
the birth of the Qur'an and the development of the religion. Not far from
the Zamzam spring was the Ka'aba shrine, a cubic stone. Its antiquity being
great but unknown, it was dedicated to Allah. At its eastern corner was
another much smaller sacred stone which obviously symbolized the rising
of the sun. It is generally believed that the Ka'aba was originally part of a
much larger configuration similar to Stonehenge.
Traditionally, the people worshipped at the shrine by circumambulating
it seven times in the direction of the sun. This ceremony was known as the
'tawwaf. An area of some thirty kilometres around it was regarded as
sacred, and weapons were forbidden there. Long before Arabs made the
annual pilgrimage to Mecca as the birthplace of Muhammad, that self-same
pilgrimage was being made to pay homage to the Goddess. Likewise 'sion'
is a stone protuberance and Mount Sion is the mountain of the rock. The
Druids knew this stone as the Maen Llog, and in some quarters Druidism
was known as Y Maen (the stone). Islamic tradition holds that the Rock of
Sion was magically suspended, that it was a rocking stone.
One of the annual rituals was for the pilgrims to go to the hollow of
Muzdalifa, the home of the Thunder God, and hurl stones at three sacred
pillars. Close to Mecca were three separate shrines dedicated to three
independent goddesses who must originally have been one. The worship of
the Lady al-Lat took place at Taif.
The Kauza'ah were the guardians of the holy place at Mecca. These tribal
priests, like their brethren around the globe, went into decline, and they
were superseded by the ancestors of Muhammad, the Quraysh clan. What
they inherited was not so much a centre of worship but the highways
linking the major trade routes that ran through the city. The Hijaz highway
linked Yemen with Syria and Transjordan. The Najd road linked Iraq with
Yemen. The



THE ROCK OF ISLAM 303
shrine itself proved to be a bonus to this sixth century family, which ruled
over a nomadic people. By the time of Muhammad, having become the
most powerful tribe in Arabia, the Quraysh became conscious of and
motivated by the religious significance of the territory they held.
Just as major technological advances are synonymous with wars,
religious milestones tend to occur at times of emotional crisis. This family
had become immensely powerful, and materialism was beginning to
threaten the survival of the clan. The younger generation — as happened in
the West in the so-called 60s revolution — were beginning to question the
quest for riches and their value. Muhammad and his Qur'an evolved from
this situation. The fact that his relatives had massive wealth, and also
controlled an ancient and sacred centre, gave him both material and
spiritual authority to launch his teachings.
The group had spent generations living the nomadic desert life, and, like
the rest of mankind, worshipping now shadowy gods. They began to fall
under the influence of the relatively new Judaic and Christian deities, but
the settled life and great wealth gave the Quraysh aspirations to nationhood
and a national god, which the prophet ultimately supplied. That God
revealed Himself in one form to the Jews, in another to the Christians and
in yet another to the Arabs does raise the question as to whether He
revealed Himself at all. Unlike the divine Jesus, and similarly to the Scrolls
Teacher, this prophet made no claim to deific nature; he insisted he was an
ordinary and sinful man.
Once again, similar to the case of the fatherless Righteousness Teacher,
Abdallah the father of Muhammad died before his mother Amina gave
birth. At that birth, his grandfather dreamed that he saw a great tree
growing from his grandson's back, which gave out a great light (the sun).
Its branches reached east and west and up to heaven. Again like the
Revealer of Mysteries, the prophet was fostered out — to a woman called
Halima.
At age twenty-six Muhammad married Khadijah, a wealthy widow
nearly fifteen years his senior. In his fortieth year, while meditating in a
cave at Hira (Jebel nur) in the month of Ramadan, he received his
revelation. It is held that, at his birth, the sacred fire of the Zoroastrians (the
sun in the tree) went out, and likewise, on receiving his revelation from the
angel Gabriel, he feared it might have been inspired by pagan demons: he
had an intense hatred of paganism. This is yet another example of how
human consciousness



304 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
changed on a global basis, with the masculine becoming ever more
dominant.
The holy day of Islam is Friday, which is sacred to the planet Venus, the
ruling planet of Taurus. Prior to the coming of the prophet, the Ka'aba was
the centre of worship for the cult of Al-uzza, that name being a
combination of God and Issa. Issa is Venus, but the name is obviously
comparable with Jesus and the Celtic Hesus. Given that the Teacher is a
Taurean, he may somehow derive some of his names from Venus, the ruler
of that sign.
The connection has often been made between Muhammad and Jesus'
saying that after he departed he would send a paraclete (comforter) (John
14: 16; 14: 26; 15: 26; 16: 7). The Greek 'periklytos' was translated into the
Arabic as Ahmad', meaning 'praised'. This was taken to refer to the
prophet. Likewise, because these religions all have a common root, the
connection has been made between his being a merchant and Jesus'
statement in Matthew 13: 45-46, which says:
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly
pearls:
Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he
had, and bought it.
The Qur'an has many common threads with the Old Testament, and at its
genesis, when Judaism and Christianity were the prominent religious
powers in that part of the world, it gives a respectful nod to the Scriptures.
It acknowledges the roles of the Old Testament patriarchs and endorses
Jesus as a prophet. It even conforms to the doctrine of the Last Judgement,
but, most importantly, in keeping with Scripture, it exemplifies the global
decline of Goddess worship, and sets a solely male god in her place. But for
all that may be said of this man and his teaching, for all that we as
Westerners may not be able to comprehend the prophet and his writings, his
book is a much more profound work than we may be ready to admit.
Whether we conclude that it may have been developed by priests similar to
the Essenes, or whether we grudgingly admit that he was a man of genius,
1380 years after it began to take shape Islam is a very considerable force,
which must be reckoned with. Probably much sooner than we might think.
In the period of Muhammad's revelation the known world was divided
between Persia and Byzantium. Twenty years after his



THE ROCK OF ISLAM 305
death, Islam had conquered Persia and was attacking Byzantium. Any critic
of the faith must always take this 'miraculous' rise into account. The
Teacher's New Israel is certain to grow at the same speed. Both Rome and,
later, the British were a means by which the holy people were to be
destroyed — the mystics disenfranchised in every corner of the globe.
Whether by accident or intent, the Qur'an owes its success to its emphasis
upon the male aspect of God in a masculine age. But, as this period passes,
the left and the right will again become one. Both the Scrolls and
Nostradamus affirm an end to religions and the beginning of true faith.
The greatest problem created by the Dead Sea Scrolls is the almost
obsessive anonymity of their authors. This same difficulty extends to the
Scriptures. It is, again, manifest in the stories of Jesus and the Teacher. The
answer seems to lie in the nature of cabala and its effect upon the
individual. It is virtually impossible to explain, and I can only draw on
personal experience. It all happens without willing or even thought for the
matter. Progressively, one goes beyond faith, one develops a scientific,
logical and rational perception of the Creator of All. There are no conscious
mitzvot (good deeds) involved; the ego steps back and seeks its own dim
inution. There is no secrecy, only a growing inability to see any
significance in self. Even the language that expresses it becomes arduous
and meaningless. But at this point the inner man is born again, quietly
knowing itself. Gone is the brashness and egotism; all bows down to the
Divine within.
I would suggest that this naturally-occurring progression may have
played a major role in the nature of the historical Essenes and will, most
likely, be a trademark of the Teacher. We see it in the biblical Jesus, who
we have come to think of as the reluctant Messiah. But, in so saying, I
make no personal claim to have had my spirit rise and travel to Camelot or
the Heikhalot. The source of the unio mystica descends from heaven; it
does not rise from earth.
As it has been said repeatedly that heaven is within us and not 'out there',
concepts that externalize the divine state are worth comment. The term
'paradise' is from the Hebrew 'pardes' meaning 'orchard', which is a place of
fruit-bearing (cosmic) trees. In our age, this became pardes perdes 'paradise
lost'. It then follows that 'heaven' must refer strictly to the place of the fruit
of the tree, which is the zodiac.
If, as Europeans, we are able to face the historical reality that



306 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
has been carefully hidden, it may be said that in the time of separation from
heaven, when the tree was cut down, the Western European was a major
means by which the power of the holy people was to be cut off.
It is particularly difficult, in the light of present international social and
political realities, to see post-Roman Europe as a dark continent which the
civilized peoples largely ignored, but it was the case that until about 250
years ago the Islamic world rarely gave any thought to Europe, which was a
backwater of civilization. It would seem that not only do old soldiers never
die, their old squabbles do not fade away. It is possible that in one sense
modern Israel represents a sort of Crusaders' revenge, in that Jerusalem is
once again — by proxy — in Western hands. In many respects, we have
done with the Arabs what Germany supposedly did with the Jews: they
have been progressively dehumanized. The same was done with the
American Indian, the African American and the Australian Aborigine, who
until relatively recently was fair game for hunting. If we accept a universe
built upon cause and effect, this behaviour may be said to be quite
acceptable. In these circumstances there is no room for complaint when
another tribe takes the upper hand and we take our turn at being victims.
Unlike the numerous commentators on Nostradamus, I do not intend to
go beyond the limited and shaky ground upon which I stand. To be
perfectly honest, where commentary on prophecy is concerned I would
normally declare myself a conscientious objector. Judging by the growing
volume of books and media involvement in the Imminent Apocalypse
Syndrome, we are clearly at the start of a wave of millenarianism. But the
simple fact is that, whether by accident or otherwise, we stand now
precisely at the point the ancient prophets predicted. It is hard to see a way
through this reality of unreality. On the one hand we find Nostradamus
telling us of an Arab invasion of Europe, and this is supported by Scripture.
On the other hand, while Arab militancy is on the increase, it does appear to
be a David and Goliath situation. Where does one find solid ground?
The Irish seer St Malachi tells us that only two more popes remain before
the end of the papacy as we know it. He cryptically designates them as
Gloria Olivae (glory of the olive) and Petrus Romanus (Peter/Stone of
Rome).
A corresponding set of prophecies was found in a burnt-out Berlin
church in 1944. Those dating from 1997 on say:



THE ROCK OF ISLAM 307
1997 Death of the Moon
1998 Glory in the Skies
1999 The new Peter
2000 Triumph of the olive
The first factor to be noticed is that they invite us to think that it will all
be over by the year 2000. Not so: this contradicts Scripture. After the
coming of the Teacher, the Church is in a spiritual wilderness for forty
years.
'Death of the Moon' may be related to Nostradamus's darkest day since
creation. 'Glory in the skies' may refer to Coma. Taken at face value, the
last two prognostications seem to fall the opposite way to Malachi, if we
assume a reference to the Papacy. But 'The new Peter' could also be the
new Stone, which would associate this with 'Triumph of the olive'.
With all the clues we have gathered for the interpretation of prophecy,
we are still substantially in the dark. But the fact of the matter is that we
have come to think of seers such as Nostradamus as obscurantists par
excellence where, in reality, the Church went to a great deal of trouble to
hide the truth. Lately, as we all know, it is the politicians and major
corporations that keep it from us. But, ever so strangely, they have done
this because we demanded it. In Century 1: 42 Nostradamus foresees the
instituting of the Gregorian calendar in 1582 by 'wicked people' who, by
this means, added to the confusion. He says:
The fire is extinguished and the diabolic gathering seek the bones of the
demon of Psellus.
But all these things were long ago written upon the pillar of porphyry
standing on the gnarled rock. We are only reading the lines.
Prophecy has generally been interpreted on the basis of wish fulfilment.
The seer is invariably long since dead and unable to answer for himself;
thus it is usually he who is blamed for the failures.
Babylonian magi established ancient Israel some five centuries or so
before our era. The prognostications that begin in Genesis are seen later to
be fulfilled. But, as it transpires, the historical messianic kingdom was as
delusory as the king's own magic clothes.
In the first case — historically speaking — this is not foreknowing; it is
simply good management of the script, in that the ancient history of Israel
is made to fit the message. In the second



308 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
instance we now find ourselves invited to see the entire concept as history,
and discover that the biblical seers have failed miserably in their visions.
Again, historically speaking, the people returned from exile and the
Temple was completed by 515 BCE. This means that an historical Jesus,
had he taken up his throne, was about 400 years late. Basically it is the
building of the Temple that heralds the Christ. This does not take into
account the fact that Scripture sets his birth in 239 CE, as earlier explained.
The majority of Christian believers throughout our era never read the Bible
because they were illiterate. Those who could must have seen the obvious
flaws.
But many of today's Christians can and do read the Book, and still
believe. Logically, if they hold on long enough, the prophecy will be
fulfilled. We see here a case of going to the seer and demanding a specific
revelation. Inevitably he is unwelcome in his own country, because his
vision does not come up to expectations. All this has an extremely
deleterious effect on what is clearly an extremely powerful body of
writings. But, much worse, it discourages the intelligent student, who might
put his study to good use. The New Age dreamer has no conception of the
damage he does.
In the gnostic Gospel of Thomas, Jesus is again a revealer of mysteries.
He brings fire (the sun) down to the earth and is concerned with the union
of the male and female within. In the form of Elijah, the Teacher repairs the
altar of twelve stones. All this happens in the midst of an invitation to the
many prophets of Baal (Jesus) to call upon their god to cook the flesh of a
bullock without their lighting the fire. They fail, but Elijah calls upon God,
who brings down fire to roast his beast upon this repaired altar of twelve
stones. Inasmuch as he sets the sun in the tree, he not only repairs the altar
but inaugurates the apocalypse, in which fire is brought down from heaven.
In a book which contradicts accepted wisdom — and I acknowledge that
the present work is an extreme case — much time must be wasted in
justifying one's right to attack society's ivory towers. The implication is that
there may be some hidden motive. At this juncture there is confusion
between what is history based on known and provable facts and what may
be termed faith in the miraculous. Quite clearly, belief seeks to ground
itself in the physical realm by claiming historical substantiation, but even
this must initially be an act of faith. In a rational world one should not need
to justify one's arguments: they should simply stand or fall on



THE ROCK OF ISLAM 309
their merits. In one sense, we fear the unknown while we wallow wilfully
in darkness.
In the 22nd logion of the Gospel of Thomas, we saw the central theme of
the Teacher's revelation. Here Jesus says, in what is now clearly no longer
mysterious language, that men will enter the kingdom when they make the
two one, the inner as the outer, the outer as the inner, the above as the
below, the male as the female into a single one. But the male is not to be
made male, nor the female made female. Eyes are to be made in the place
of an eye and a hand is to be put in place of a hand. In short, the left and
right brain will no longer be divided.
In trying to make an assessment of the material we are discussing, we
arrive at this simple and central point. The ancient wise men were so
because they unified the left and right hemispheres of the mind. We are
steeped in fear and superstition because we will not allow ourselves to
destroy the unknown. We are blind because we have closed our eyes. The
miraculous is a foolish and fantastic creation. The Bible is a book of
profound knowledge which has absolutely nothing to do with religion, and
it in turn has absolutely nothing to do with God. Prophecy, a foreknowing
of the future, has no relationship to magic and occultism. These are
superstitious indulgences, whereas foreknowing is achieved by legitimate
and scientific methods. But the truth of the matter is that we have not
arrived at this point in time as wilfully ignorant. Man stands alone; he has
no idea where he has come from and even less understanding of where he is
going. He was hopelessly lost and is now hopelessly trapped. He cannot go
forward and cannot turn back; logically he must look to his own resources.
He must win his right to survive by proving his courage to face the ultimate
enemy, his inner self. And this, in a nutshell, is the Teacher's role: to awak
en the sleeper within.
The graveyard of history is filled with the bones of alchemists — from
William Shakespeare (Francis Bacon) to Plato and Pythagoras, from
Leonardo Da Vinci to Meister Eckhart, Albertus Magnus to Nicolas Flamel,
Trevisanius to Jakob Boehme. We may also include such men as Sir Isaac
Newton and many of the great poets of the last 350 years. All of them saw,
all of them experienced, the bringing down of the sun and the rising of the
moon. There is nothing new in the story I have told: I have simply
expressed these things explicitly.
The literature of the alchemist sets the same trap as do the major



310 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
religious scriptures, and by 'trap' I do not imply an attempt to deceive. The
literalist — strictly left-brained — beast was never going to understand.
His time was limited anyway: he was the evolutionary failure that God
would destroy. And as for the man with potential, these matters could only
be transmitted subliminally to the right brain, for they are its language and
currency.
In the rejection of Jesus the Teacher we see this situation, in which he
attempts to awaken as many as possible to the inner kingdom of the
thirteenth heaven. In this arrangement there is no religion, nor any sensitive
New Agers who have carefully avoided the stark realities. It is a harsh
discipline which has its own magical impact, as many of the alchemists
have attested. It sets one aside so that evil or wrongdoing becomes
anathema to the soul. It purifies by fire and brings an awareness of a living
God which no literal religionist could begin to imagine. But, in so doing, it
brings about a commitment to truth that alienates the individual from a
society he no longer desires. He has overcome 'self will': he no longer wills
for himself. Whether it brings hardship or joy, to the initiate it is all one:
God's will. This is what is meant by 'God within us'. The inner self ceases
to be; God fills and overwhelms him. But in the process he is reborn with
increased vigour, filled by divine power. He has entered a new realm, a new
dimension in time and space. He has invariably done this quite
unintentionally and unaware of this new dimension at which he has arrived.
When setting out on his journey he could not have anticipated his amazing
destination. His instinct is to share his good fortune, but how?
There is another side to St John's world, in which none may buy or sell
unless they have the mark of the Beast. In the mind of the literalist, things
spiritual are without currency. Thus the work of the alchemist is either
literalized or dispensed with altogether. He becomes totally
disenfranchised, even deprived of the language by which these ideas may
be communicated. He is an alien in a literal and mechanistic world. A
stranger in a strange land.
Let me say again that the story I am telling is nothing new. It has been
told time and time again. I have spoken literally and presented these matters
in a manner which I hope communicates them to the literal left brain. In so
doing I have tried to avoid the language normally associated with alchemy
and wisdom literature, the existence of which has, over time, led to some
quite bizarre conclusions on the part of the self-deluded.
It seems that, starting as far back as the time of the Templars,



THE ROCK OF ISLAM 311
there has been what has come to be known as an international conspiracy of
Freemasons and Zionists. It has also at times included the French House of
Lorraine. At its pitiful least it is a right-wing fundamentalist version of the
flying saucer conspiracy. The Stone of Destiny was also the foundation of
political movements such as National Socialism, which was by no means
confined to Germany. In contrast and opposition to a lunar-based but solar
dominated Marxism, the Nazis sought to re-establish and re-live the glory
of the Templar teutonic knights. They were not without a sound
understanding of alchemy and the secrets of the temple. But once again the
future was casting a negative shadow; it held up a mirror to the past. Those
same two forces — the lunar of Marxism and the solar of Nazism — would
one day combine and create perfection, but for now they were at each
other's throats. There is a point where understanding extends beyond its
established boundaries, and there is no such thing as right and wrong.
Everything simply is, was and will be. In a very real sense we are all the
Teacher and we are all the Jewish Antichrist; the manifest world is what
happens when God utters a word.
If only by looking at the character and roughly measuring the average
intelligence of the presidents of the United States in the last 30 years, it is
obvious that real power lies elsewhere. If we consider the miracle that put
these men into the White House, then that hidden power is clearly more
substantial than might at first be realized. No society that would freely
make these cowboys president of the most powerful nation on earth can
have any hope at all. It is doomed from the ballot box. But it must be seen
that men like Ronald Reagan were part of a wave which had its
counterparts in people like Margaret Thatcher in Britain. History becomes
so much easier to understand when we see it in terms of waves striking an
unconscious shore. If there is real power being exercised covertly on an
international basis, it is done by the extraordinarily rich, whose ethnicity
and political and religious views are diverse and secondary to the protection
and expansion of their wealth. No doubt they may well exercise
considerable power over the world's various political systems, but they only
do so because you and I allow it. In a market-orientated economy they feed
us the poison we desire. Religion is le specialite de la maison. Your
objective is consumption; their objective is profit and power.
That megalomania may be part of the human condition is neither here
nor there. Alchemy has as little to do with an international



312 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
conspiracy of Freemasons and Zionists as with the actual transmutation of
base metals. The world of which we speak has equally little association
with religion and occultism. It is the realm of the psychological sciences.
To date, only one modern thinker and scientist has made any real inroads in
these disciplines: Carl Jung.
It is as though we speak of the discovery of another physical realm with
superintelligent life. We have for a long time suspected its existence.
Rumours, which are now shown to be fact, have told us that humans have
been known to visit this planet. We also know now that one may only enter
by invitation, that the inhabitants are strongly prejudiced against
materialists and materialism, and that once you enter you are changed
forever. This same dimension is both within us and light-years away. It
gave us life and has the power to destroy us.
Where we began in the shady regions of religion and archaeological
conspiracies, these are now transcended. We need no longer concern
ourselves with magic, shamanism, occult mysteries and offended
Philistines. Our broom has swept a clean path to the door of pure science.
With the aid of men such as Jung, we are now free to enter uncharted
territory and double the range of human consciousness. We need no longer
fear or be embarrassed by the lunatic fringe. There is no religion and no
mystical clap-trap; we seek to set in motion a process by which we can
become conscious of, and utilize, the workings of the right brain. If in that
process we should discover the living God, and subsequently become
whole and right-doing in every aspect of our lives, then we may perpetually
bless and thank that God for the joy of truly knowing Him. Then we may
fly on eagles' wings with our feet fixed firmly on the ground.
The modern era has not been without its share of prophets, of whom two
particularly stand out. Jeane Dixon and Edgar Cayce have demonstrated
remarkable accuracy and at the same time have been amazingly wrong.
There is no question of their having utilized any technical device such as
the tree; in fact both stem from a very traditional religious background.
Jeane Dixon is famous for anticipating the killing of President Kennedy and
trying to warn him that she had foreseen the event. Edgar Cayce is known
as the Sleeping Prophet: he would prophesy while seemingly unconscious.
We may see now that what in fact was happening with Cayce was that,
switching off his left conscious mind, his inner mind was given free reign.
Prophetic power has also been



THE ROCK OF ISLAM 313
known to manifest when people have suffered a severe illness or even brain
damage. Again, I suggest that nothing 'occult' or 'miraculous' has happened:
it would seem to be a simple matter of the right brain feeding information
to the left, bringing the unconscious into consciousness.
Jung postulated the universal and collective mind. It seems to me totally
plausible that Dixon and Cayce did nothing more magical or divinely
inspired than tap into this hidden realm, where past, present and future are
one. That Cayce and Dixon had a mixed bag of amazing success and
abysmal failure in their prophecies would seem to confirm this. It suggests
that, while their conscious was in touch with their unconscious, the
connection was imperfect. That is to say, in some instances their conscious
minds reinterpreted and confused the messages received. Perhaps they even
attached some personal values and wish-fulfilment to them.
We live in a reality of unreality. Our lives are busied with nailing down
boards we hope have some substance. We live like blind men in darkened
rooms, searching for a black cat that isn't there. It is therefore
understandable that Jesus the Teacher should be heard to say 'Father,
forgive them; for they know not what they do'. It is also pitiful that these
words should fall from his lips because, in reality, we are at the dawn of the
greatest scientific rediscovery of all time. It is a gift that all mankind can
share.
Throughout this text, I deal, perhaps a little unkindly, with many aspects
of our world. I do not do so because they make, or have made, any
difference to, or have even remotely affected, my own life and living. I am
aware that, in the absence of a sturdy lifeboat, we will all grasp at straws.
But I do feel that forthrightness to the point of being blunt is essential. I
will admit that what I would term 'idolatry' is something I find offensive,
but then I feel obliged to respect the rights of others to choose damnation.
Given that we only perceive with our conscious material mind, even
idolatry is to some degree understandable. But having dug deeper than
most, I must admit that my own overall confusion is greater than average.
The problem with the thirteenth stone is that it sits at the root of a tree with
many branches and holds back a great flood of commentary on almost
every aspect of human life. I may well have proved myself competent in
investigating the ancient myths, but this now seems overwhelmed by the
sociological and psychological aspects of the investigation. Perhaps we
have journeyed a bridge too far.



314 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
If all else in this text fails to impress, of one thing we can be certain. To
interpret history in the manner traditionally known is pointless. To imagine
that we know anything at all about the ancient world is ridiculous. Just
thirty years ago, the pre-Roman Britons were thought to have been savages
civilized by Rome, displaying a clear selectivity of information. Diogenes
Laertius (The Lives and Opinions of the Eminent Philosophers) likens the
Druids to the Persian magi and the gymnosophists. He quotes from
Aristotle and Sotion, who were much earlier sources. It is likely that
Pythagoras, who influenced thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle and Socrates,
was himself a student of Druidism. Britain was the Island of the
Hyperboreans (the land beyond the north wind), and its inhabitants were
said to be the last survivors of the Golden Age. Just as the remoteness of
Ireland made her one of the final bastions holding out against Christianity,
it is likely that even earlier the British Isles remained a remote fastness of
those halcyon days.
According to tradition, the god Apollo (the sun) came originally from
Britain. This would seem logical predictive legend if he was to be raised in
the tree by a British Righteousness Teacher, who we find in Llew Llaw, a
form of Mercury (the bringer of wisdom). The shrine at Delphi only
became the property of Apollo after he dispensed with the dragon, which
must be a form of the idol Jesus, the son of the sun in Pisces.
In Celtic astronomy the constellation Cassiopeia (a maiden chained to a
rock) was known as 'The Court of Dana'. Among the various invaders of
Ireland that historians accept as actual are the Tuatha (people) De Danann;
Dana/Diana is the Goddess. Dan, it may be recalled, is in both Hebrew and
old Celtic 'Judge', and that tribe is Scorpio, which, counting around the tree,
becomes the thirteenth sign. Dana is also rendered 'Don', 'Danu' and 'Anu'; I
have made frequent mention of the Anunnaki.
The Tuatha were a people of the Iron Age (Pisces). They brought with
them the knowledge of magic, poetry and medicine. They were also said to
be the guardians of four great treasures: the Spear of Llew, the Sword of
Nuada, the Cauldron of Dagda and the Stone of Destiny. It has been
suggested that these may be matched with the four lesser suits of the Tarot,
the first three being Wands, Swords and Cups. This leaves the Stone of
Destiny to be paired with the suit of Pentacles, which are stars. Thus this
stone is a star and the Star is the Teacher with whom it is synonymous. If
the cards of the major arcana are set around the tree in a figure eight, then
card number



THE ROCK OF ISLAM 315
seven, 'The Star', falls on Coma and card number ten, 'The Sun', sits in the
throat of the tree where the new sun rises. It is only with the extra sephirah
in the cosmic temple that the Tarot can be made to harmonize with
something of which it is obviously a part.
In Celtic legend there is a wondrous land in which a particular tree
stands tall above all others. From it hang clusters of delicious fruit and
nearby is a pool of crystal-clear water. When water (wisdom from God) is
thrown over a stone at the base of the tree, it gives access to the
Underworld. In the Persian Avesta this tree is known as the Tree of All
Healing; in Norse legend it is called Yggdrasil. The Altaic Tartars echo
Daniel and speak of it as a great mountain. In the Celtic realms that ranged
across Europe, the spirit world was a mirror image of the physical. Hence
left was right, right was left, male was female and the female was male:
clearly a reference to the left and right hemispheres of the brain.
The Celtic Bran was guardian of the life-restoring cauldron. His
obviously white head is said to have been buried on what came to be known
as 'White Hill', the supposed site of the Tower of London. Like almost
every other incarnation of the Teacher I have found, Merlin was fatherless.
Christian tradition has his mother mating with a demon. Aethra the mother
of Theseus became pregnant on the same day to both King Aegeus and
Poseidon. The same was the case with the Celtic Dechtine and her
conceiving of Cu Chulainn.
In The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, the authors caused a sensation
when they claimed the ancient French Merovingian dynasty was descended
from Jesus. The founder of this prehistoric line of Frankish kings was
Merovee. The descendants of this line are the House of Lorraine, which
now has a blood connection with most of Europe's royal families.
Genealogically they are the most illustri-oius; their significant connection
from our viewpoint is the St Clairs of Roslin. My interest in Merovee at this
juncture is his birth. As pointed out in The Holy Blood and the Holy
Grail,34 even the name seems as mythical as the character, for it echoes the
French for 'mother' as well as for 'sea'. He was born of two fathers: the wife
of King Clodio was pregnant, but while swimming in the ocean she was
seduced and seeded a second time by an unidentified marine creature who
must clearly have been part man and part fish — an Oannes or Bistia
neptunis. Significantly, the Merovingians were the originators of the bee as
a blazon of the priest-kings of the Franks.
Our task is to find our way through a labyrinth, also called the



316 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Troytown. This maze, once popular in England, was known as Julian's
Bower. We learn from Virgil in the AEneid (Book V) that this Julian was
originally Iulu. Thus the maze is lulu's city. In the original Cretan story of
the labyrinth, it was guarded by the Minotaur, which — logically — is the
Geminotaurus, and Gemini and Taurus sit either side of the thirteenth stone
in the temple. The monster was finally slain by Theseus (the Sceptre), who
then escaped the maze with a clue given by Ariadne, the Spider Queen of
the stone that the Minotaur guarded. In Australia the Troytown is known as
the path of the emu, she being the Goddess.
Thus it is another form of the Gordian knot, the Queen's chastity belt for
which — quite rightly — only Theseus the great Christian king will have
the key. The astrological symbol for Coma, is thus both symbolic of the
vagina or port of entry into heaven and also a hieroglyph for the secret city.
This has given us the symbol for the female, where the vagina is open,
as opposed to that of the Goddess, where the Christian cross of the Jesus
beast bars the way to love:
It will be recalled that I have said the Hebrew letter 'teth' has an
association with the English 'teeth', and that these are representative of
circles of stones like Stonehenge. In North Semitic the glyph for teth was
and in early Phoenician it was The Hebrew word 'teth' means
'snake'; hence the rising of the thirteenth (genital) stone/star (Teacher) is the
rising of the phallic serpent whose seed is wisdom, with which he fertilizes
Isis, the stone seat (womb) of the Goddess, and fathers Israel. The Bible
itself tells us to distinguish between the true and false Jesus — a Samael
(god of the blind). One relevant verse is Deuteronomy 21: 23, which reads:
His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in
any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of
God;)...
Acts 5: 30 reads:
The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on
a tree.
Historically, with Jesus set in a backdrop of pious followers in a pious
Israel, this is an impossible set of circumstances. If, as is believed, the New
Testament writings were largely independent



THE ROCK OF ISLAM 317
accounts of his life — assertions totally disproved by the existence of
numerology — we would never have had the received version.
The New Testament writers — and I speak as though it were history
would have been well aware of Deuteronomy 21: 23 and there could only
have been two outcomes. Either his death would have been disguised and
given another form, perhaps speared by a Roman soldier, or he might have
been stoned to death, but his hanging would have been regarded as a sign
that he was a false Messiah. As it transpires, historically speaking, Jesus
was definitely so, because he fully failed in his mission. I must insist that
only by setting him in the future — giving him a second chance, so to
speak — can we make any sense of Scripture.
The simple fact is that Einstein's discovery that time is circular, and that
it is the framework which holds our reality together, was well known to our
ancient ancestors. There is probably no way that we can hope to derive a
picture of history in such circumstances. But ultimately the concluding
comment upon the matter of the Scriptures, ancient or modern, is yours.
And what you believe is absolutely no business of mine. But I can assure
you that understanding is everything. Your life depends upon it.
Conclusion
In the introduction to this book I said that, as man sank deeper and deeper into
matter, he brought the gods down with him. With our look at Islam's pagan roots,
we now have a complete global picture of how — in our age — humanity was
swept by a wave of consciousness that subjugated every single mind to some
degree. Our examination of religion as one particular manifestation of this
phenomenon has shown us a progressive transformation of the originally feminine,
poetic concepts into masculine, material religious expression. Seeing history in this
way encourages an understanding according to which we can all admit to being
intoxicated by, and participating in, global insanity. Our present Western-style
materialism is of such a character as to suggest that this contagion is yet to reach its
peak of virulence. But the cure is simple: conscious recognition of its reality is all
that is required.
It is to the credit of Islam that it — or more precisely its adherents — did not
embrace the masculine extremes of Christianity. But then, we are dealing with an
ethnic, or at least cultural, phenomenon. It is no coincidence that Westerners first
expressed their extremism in Christianity, then in their massive empire-building
and now in the mechanistic



318 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
sciences, which threaten global destruction. But in so saying I am aware of Islam's
history and do not seek to exculpate it entirely. It is a matter of subtle differences.
Central to our entire discussion is the matter of the left and right brain, and its
eventual balancing through catastrophic evolution. The sheer mass of evidence
given in this book is absolutely necessary, but its volume can tend to obstruct our
perception of the subtle realities. What we need to perceive is the mind of man
being the microcosm of the Mind of God — that it is in mind that God is manifest.
Accordingly we may see that, in the Piscean Age, the human brain became
masculine dominant 'by [androgynous] God's will' and for divine purpose. The
global history of the last 2000 years is an expression of this division of spiritual and
intellectual genders. Ultimately, with our concept of Mind above driving mind
below, there is no longer a dichotomy between physical and spiritual reality. They
are interwoven; they are one.
Surely this understanding provides a true foundation for peace. We have all been
as children terrorized and filled with fear, which is to be dissipated by
understanding. Perhaps we might all pray: Father forgive us for we know not what
we do.
This, no doubt, is something that our Teacher will take into account. Even his
own community — the cream of humanity — will prove fickle in this respect. He
himself is imperfect, having grown in a world where double-mindedness is the
nature of man. This is epitomized in Scripture, where — in his role as Moses — we
are given some biographical detail.
The lawgiver lived among the Midianites (Kenites), who worshipped a war and
storm god. He was symbolized by a cross, which the people wore on their
foreheads. How could all this have been missed? Did the original converts to
Judaism and Christianity simply swallow it hook, line and sinker? Certainly there
were a few who took it knowing: Nil nisi clavis deest.
Likewise, as far back as 1972, Jose O'Callaghan identified one of the fragments
of Qumran cave 7 as being a New Testament text. It is numbered 7Q5, and it is from
the Gospel of St Mark (6: 52-53). It should also be taken into account that there is a
strong likelihood that the canonical version of Mark was derived from the ancient
text known as 'the Secret Gospel of Mark'. This would make it very early. Indeed it
would encourage us to think in terms of a BCE dating.
It was abundantly clear from the outset that the Essene Christians were the
authors of the New Testament. What is it that makes us all so arrogantly spit in the
face of truth?



Book IV



19
Shiloh at the Court of King Arthur
The British material centring upon the exploits of King Arthur owes much
to Geoffrey of Monmouth. Later, Walter Map enhanced it to legitimize the
Plantagenets. Under the patronage of Marie, Countess of Champagne,
Chretien de Troyes produced the fundamentals of the modern legend in the
late twelfth century.
Here Lyonesse, a mysterious land sunk under the sea, becomes evocative
of the legends of Atlantis, which obviously sank beneath the Piscean sea.
At this point the Grail family moves into Camelot and the story becomes a
vehicle for Templar philosophies. There is an extraordinary similarity here
between the Templar use of a vast body of otherwise unconnected material,
which becomes the Grail story, and the use by the magi of Greek heroes
like Jason and Sumerian legends to produce the Jesus myth. Emerging from
a largely illiterate world, Arthur has almost become historical. This should
help us to understand how relatively easy it would have been to launch a
miracle-working Jesus, particularly when the first that was supposedly
heard of him was in Rome.
If the Arthurian matter is to be given an historical timeslot it would be
between 400 and 600 CE. But it leans heavily upon legend that predates this
time, such as that of the Holy Grail, which only became a Christian relique
at the hands of Robert de Borron. This Grail goes on to be associated with a
miraculous revelation, of which the central character is Joseph of
Arimathea (the sun). It is with the German Wolfram von Eschenbach that
the Grail becomes a magical stone that fell from heaven — a fallen star.
The first assemblage of these legends in English was undertaken by Sir
Thomas Malory and was printed by the Caxton Press in 1485. Arthur, the
'rex quondam rexque futurus', had by 1590, at the hands of Edmund
Spencer in The Faerie Queene, become a shadow of his former self.
In Queen Victoria's reign, Tennyson breathed new life into our long
suffering hero, who now served to glorify, and to be emblematic of, the
greatness of Britain in the heady days of empire.
In the early ninth century Nennius wrote History of the Britons, which at
the hand of this witless cleric was really no history at all. Nevertheless,
though he was writing long after any supposed



322 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
event, his work is often used as evidence of historicity. Nennius is himself
evidence of the paucity of our knowledge of the post-Roman past of
Britain.
Though we may seek him at Tintagel or Castle Dore, even at Cadbury,
which may give faint voice to the poet's boast 'Hic jacet Arthurus, rex
quondam, rex futurus', and even though we seek him at the countless other
sites that claim him for their own, such as 'at Glastonbury on the queer',
where there hangs heavy the mists of Arthurian romance, Arthur — like
Jesus — is a phantasm inviting our credulity, then tormenting our
foolishness. Even Geoffrey of Monmouth and William of Malmesbury
were intermediaries, themselves consumers of legend and lore. Why is the
historian allowed the hearsay evidence that for others would be disallowed?
The only true knights of Camelot were those of the temple, and their king,
as the only-begotten of the Lady, would ultimately bring about the victory
of good over evil after courageously drawing his power from a rejected
stone.
History is a product of mind, and it has both a conscious and an
unconscious aspect. The real is as untenable without the romance as the
dreaming alone is without foundation. Everything boards the ark of truth
two by two and hand in hand. The formula here is simple. It will be recalled
that the Greek 'artos' means bread, which is wisdom — Sophia. She in turn
is Christ, whose menstrual blood is shed for our sins. This bloodshed is for
man's redemption, and Christ — the wisdom of the world — will not fail to
return. Arthur the wise is thus quite legitimately the once and future king.
This is not romanticism; it is the fact of the age that supersedes that of the
cyclopean giants, who even still lay us waste and torture and destroy the
minds of our children. And who is there among us brave enough to cast the
stone that will bring them to their knees? Who will dare to renew the Lady's
child-bearing crucible? Where is that stumbling-stone in Sion that will take
away our shame?
Man searches for the miraculous; often he invents his own. But he misses
the point: we are living with it in our midst. From dawn to dusk we are
surrounded by unequalled magic. Life itself is a total improbability; the
hand of God shapes the manifest world. The problems we encounter within
it result from our being out of tune with it. The solutions to its problems
cannot be discerned without reference to the Creator of All, the Great
Architect of the Universe. His presence is marked only by His creation. Our
search



SHILOH AT THE COURT OF KING ARTHUR 323
for the miraculous damns us as guilty fools seeking only fool's gold. We
search frantically for the one thing, which is there before our eyes, and we
break all the laws of God in our attempt to be in harmony with the
universe. If we are, vainly, to seek a real point of departure into this
madness, it may be at around 500 BCE, when in diverse places Confucius
and Lao-tzu, Buddha and Pythagoras, first uttered the rationalist vision. It
is of little if any relevance, but arguable, that from a scriptural viewpoint
Jesus should have manifested at about the same time as these, his
philosophical fellows.
But now the age of rationalism is ended and a growing void exists.
Nature abhors a vacuum, and the false prophets of the new era are growing
like weeds. With or without all the religious implications, it is clear that we
sit now at what has been called a crossroads in time. To know where we are
going we need to know where we have been. If our search for real truth can
be legitimized, and if it is to have any value at all, it should hopefully bring
us closer to an understanding of the real and multidimensional world.
For whatever reason, be it power, money, sex or perhaps all of these, the
miracle-workers and prophets, with their direct lines to Jesus, Nostradamus
and even God, are now becoming thicker and thicker upon the ground. In a
world gone mad, you can trust no-one in these dark days. Go your own
way. Walk the opposite way to the pack and you won't go too far wrong.
Let us then go back to what I consider to be a fundamental underlying
principle behind my own thinking. Daniel 12: 7 says:
.. .and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the
holy people, all these things shall be finished.
One of the central themes of Scripture is that the holy people who once
had great power as priests shall be gathered again. This process, I suggest,
is an evolutionary one in which the destruction is of equal significance to
the process of building. My contention is that they were the shamanic
priests who once held total power. They were the shepherds who not only
tended the sheep but also cared for the land upon which they were grazing.
The process of destruction was a long and ongoing affair; it is only now
coming to an end. The question arises: Why did the holy people have to be
scattered? Why did the spirit of Christ die for our sins and why did so much
innocent blood have to be spilt, for which God in the



324 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Last Days will take vengeance? The answer now seems to be a very simple
one. To understand, we need ask why God created the Devil (the spirit of
perversity).
My approach throughout has been to strip the Bible of its religiosity and
endeavour to have it harmonize with reality. The simplest explanation
seems to be that in matter there is inertia, and that beings formed from it
comprise more parts of impurity than gold. The object seems to be a
process of refining. This is what is meant by creation. The spirit of
perversity plays the role of refiner; that is, it brings out the worst in us. It
raises the impurities to the surface, if they exist. Ultimately the refining will
have been completed. The final testing for those impurities — according to
Scripture — is when, in the distant future, the serpent must again be loosed
for a little season (Revelation 20: 3). Thus manifest evil is the scum being
brought to the top to facilitate its being scooped away.
We may assume that the evil in the world today — though tightly
controlled by the priests — had its equal in ancient times. There would
have been no point in maintaining the status quo: the grip of the priests
would have been loosed and the beast in us set free. Then in one glorious
day it would be slain, leaving behind a greatly purified humanity. This is
the last judgement by God. As to what is pure and to be retained, and what
is impurity and to be destroyed, it is a process to which we are all
subjected. Our opinions and protestations are irrelevant. God is the potter,
we are the clay and the Devil is a tool that exposes weaknesses.
This is epitomised in the War Scroll, in column 1, section 2:
That is a time of great trouble for the people of God's salvation. In all their
troubles there was none like it, from its coming until the completion of their
eternal redemption. On the day of the battle against the Kittim they will
engage in a carnage. In three lots will the Sons of Light prove mighty to smite
the wicked, and in three lots the army of Satan shall recover to bring about the
withdrawal of the Sons [of Light]. The hearts of the skirmishing battalions
shall melt while the might of God strengthens [the heart of the Lot of
Darkness,] but in the seventh battle the mighty hand of God shall subdue
[Satan and all] angels of his council, and for all men of [his dominion there
shall be eternal annihilation].
I believe that all the angels of God must both envy and pity our generation, for,
while we shall experience the pains of birth, we



SHILOH AT THE COURT OF KING ARTHUR 325
shall participate in the conclusion of the never-ending story. Oh that all men had wit
enough to see the stubbonness of their own hearts and submit as clay to the potter's
hands, and drink from the cup of gold at the marriage feast. Column 1, section 1
concludes:
After the battle they shall go up against [the army of] the Kittim in Egypt. In
the time appointed He shall go forth with great anger to fight the kings of the
north, and His anger shall be such as to utterly destroy and cut off the horn [of
Satan.
That shall be] a time of salvation for the People of God, an appointed time
of dominion for all men of His council, and eternal annihilation for all the
sons of Satan. There shall be a [great] panic [among] the sons of Japheth
Asshur will fall, and there will be none to help him, the empire of the
Kittim will depart, and wickedness will be subdued without remnant,
and there will be no escape for [any of the Sons of] Darkness.
Ultimately, the Europeans — particularly the English — became the
weapon for the destruction of the power of the priests, when they set out to
build empires. Recently we have been made increasingly aware of the
unspeakable savagery of the early settlers in all the new world nations.
When one thinks, for example, of the pitiless and mindless evil with which
the North American Indians were hunted down, raped, slaughtered and
made to watch while their infants were butchered, one becomes confounded
by language, for no words can express this kind of pain and suffering.
When one sees the modern United States beginning to turn that same
savagery upon itself, one can imagine the massive karmic bill which that
nation is due to pay. The amazingly sophisticated weaponry that the US has
now developed is itself an indication of the absolute and unspeakable
bestiality to which it has now sunk, with the aid of its founding fathers. But
this macabre charade is not yet completed. With modern Israel's power in
the US and her manifestation of the false Messiah, America will be
instrumental in establishing his new world order. It is then that we shall see
this ancient Machiavellian plot ripen.
Two points need to be clarified. Firstly, it is true that when the Europeans
arrived in the Americas, Australia, New Zealand etc. the natives were
happily butchering each other. But it will be recalled that this was a
universal phenomenon. Progressively, over



326 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
six thousand years, the power of the shamans had been in the process of
being eroded, but this did not get into full gear until we entered Pisces. This
leads to the second point: under the governorship of the ancient magi, man
had lived a simple but peaceful life. And this in turn can explain why we
have an historical picture that shows an extraordinary division between the
masses and the priests who built the fabulous cities and temples that history
has bequeathed us. It has been noted already that this has brought about the
understandable misconception that aliens have visited earth in prehistoric
times. The massive contradictions of our ancient past are such that they
allow this type of eccentric explanation. But this does not explain why,
since about 1947, there have been an ever-growing number of UFO
sightings. One such series in Mexico, during a total eclipse of the sun in
1991, was so overwhelming in its nature and volume that it was subjected
to an international media blackout.
Life itself is made up of a series of astonishing phenomena, which
cannot easily be rationalized or explained, particularly by creatures who
only use their left (logical/masculine) brain. Again, we must see that what
is perceived depends entirely on who perceives it. For example, modern
man pollutes the air he breathes, destroys the rivers that provide him with
water, and coats the oceans with oil and uses them as dumping grounds for
nuclear and chemical waste. He creates weapons of mass destruction and
has taken chemical and germ warfare far beyond any previously conceived
obscenity. Can such a creature be trusted? Surely, to a beast of such
distorted vision, or more likely no vision at all, the UFO is clearly alien and
beyond his thinking, let alone his understanding. The fact is that this
problem does seem to have some bearing upon much of what has already
been discussed.
The picture I have painted from an astronomical viewpoint is that, as we
pass through the zodiac in the Great Year of 25,920 years, we go through
twelve Great Months of 2160 years in each sign. Some small part of this
time must be given over to an interim period where, as now, we have hit the
point exactly between Pisces and Aquarius. At such junctures we may
expect reality to be curved and inconsistent with its normal flow.
Now our universe, or at least our perception of it, is three-dimensional.
But that does not necessarily exclude the existence of a fourth and further
dimensions. That intelligent life should exist in all the worlds of God is not
an impossible contention. That such



SHILOH AT THE COURT OF KING ARTHUR 327
intelligence should cohabit with us in other dimensions does not seem
fantastic or unreasonable. That at the time between Great Months the inter
dimensional curtain is thinned and allows our perception and experience of
'the angels of heaven' seems to me a likely phenomenon. That the ancient
magi entered and experienced these other realms by walking through the
stones of fire appears logical. The simple fact is that these UFOs are part of
a number of strange phenomena which now surround us and seem to be
part of an overall scheme (see Luke 21:11).
My endeavours to paint a different picture of reality are not helped at all
by the fact that this book is primarily concerned with historically 'religious'
documents. My proposal is that history (creation) has not been a random
affair, that the events of the past six thousand years have been orchestrated
and are presently coming to a climax. Until now it has been impossible for
us to perceive the overall plan, but this scheme is a non-religious reality.
Evolution works through catastrophe; even our modern high-pressure soc
ieties may be seen as a beginning of a process by which a new humanity is
to be created. Twentieth century society itself is a part of this growing
crescendo. A man such as the Teacher is, then, someone who gathers and
rallies these new super-humans. He is a man who has, as an individual,
been subjected by God to this same pressurization.
I am not interested at all in interpreting prophecy: my sole concern is
with the Teacher, the Sceptre and the tree. It is in this search that I find an
interesting contradiction that should be resolved.
If the prophecies of the Last Days are aimed at the point where the sun
transits from Pisces to Aquarius, then the English-speaking countries must
figure quite prominently in the arrangements. By the term 'last days', I
presume the Bible to indicate the end of the Piscean era; thus it is an
astronomical reference point, not the end of the world.
The most widespread and common tongue on earth is English, and its
reach is still growing. If the Teacher is to appear in the near future, it would
be logical that he be English-speaking. It is noteworthy here that the
biblical Jesus is not a Jew.
Let us look first at the mysterious biblical Shiloh, Genesis 49: 10. Shiloh
is the seed of Judah and one of our Messianic leaders. This much is not
open to question. Unfortunately, unless this passage is explained, there is a
gaping hole in my argument. The verse reads:



328 THETHIRTEENTHSTONE
The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from
between his feet, until Shiloh come...
Looked at historically, from the point of view of Judaism and
Christianity, this is yet another failed prophecy. Judah lost its kings long
before the supposed historical Jesus or any saviour to come. And besides,
the Messiahs are supposed to establish the crown, not bring about its fall.
The timing of this passage is in the first verse of the chapter:
And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves to
gether, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.
But again, none of the Messiahs general are due to bring down the
royal house. This chapter, it may be recalled, is devoted to the assembly
of the tree through the blessings given to the tribes.
The tree may be said to be a ladder which the gods use as a method of
descending to the earth. In Genesis 28: 12 Jacob has a dream. In the
preceding passage the sun is set — it cannot be seen — so he takes a stone
for his pillow. In his dream he sees a ladder reaching from heaven to earth
and the angels ascending and descending. At its top is God Himself, who
speaks to him and reiterates the Covenant promise. Later Jacob awakes,
realizes he is on holy ground, sets his stone pillow up as a pillar of stone,
and calls the place Beth-el, which is 'house of God', the tree in the form of
a Stonehenge. In the last verse of this chapter Jacob (whose name, it will
be recalled, itself means 'standing stone') says, 'And this stone, which I
have set for a pillar, shall be God's house'.
In verse 3 of the following chapter our attention is drawn to the fact that
a great secret has been revealed:
And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone
from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again
upon the well's mouth in his place.
The well is the Scriptures. The sheep have been introduced to the rock
that brings the spirit of understanding from the waters of the womb of life.
In Genesis 35 Jacob returns to Beth-el and God speaks to him again
from the stone. It is here that God changes his name to Israel.



SHILOH AT THE COURT OF KING ARTHUR 329
This establishes that God speaks to His people through the earth's bones,
and that thus they become Israel.
This pillar later becomes that of the oak tree, as was the case with
Joshua, who in Joshua 24: 26 sets a stone under an oak as a witness to
Israel. This rock has heard all the words spoken by God to the people.
From then on it becomes the pillar at which the kings of Israel are anointed.
In Hosea 3: 4-5 the children of Israel are to live without a king, prince or
sacred stone until the latter days, when David comes. The word
'matstsebah', which is here translated as 'image', may be rendered as both
'image' and 'stone'. This stone Ark of the Covenant disappears with Israel
as they go into captivity. It only emerges again in myth and legend, where
it is seen in every part of the globe — which is exactly as it should be.
The Holy Grail, the Philosopher's Stone, the Ark of the Covenant and
even Noah's Ark are all clearly one and the same thing. Interestingly, we
have subsequently come to believe that sun and phallus worship were the
basis of the ancient religions. In the Middle Ages, the alchemists
encouraged the belief that they were attempting the transmutation of base
metals into gold. Pisces is associated with iron, Aquarius with brass, and
we have the gold of the sun in the tree. But nowhere in the world are the
legends stronger than in Britain — so powerful that many have become
almost accepted as history. At the centre of these is Glastonbury.
The city of Shiloh is in the territory of Ephraim, north-east of Beth-el.
From the time of Joshua until Samuel it was the seat of the tabernacle
(Coma).
In the book of Joshua, at chapter 18, we are told that Joshua gathered the
children of Israel at Shiloh. It is where he cast lots with the Lord for the
allocation of territories for the tribes, and from whence, led by Reuben, the
children of Aquarius, they all departed to their allotted lands. Much later, in
Jeremiah 26: 9, the house is to be like Shiloh. It is then safe to assume that
Shiloh is the Teacher, and the city of Shiloh is the tree which is his house
and made after his instruction.
There is a very strong tradition that links Britain with this legend. The
first Christian church, at Glastonbury, is said to have been founded by
Joseph of Arimathea, along with Mary — Jesus' mother — and some of the
apostles. If the history of Israel and Jesus is myth, which is part of a
concocted scheme, then the Glastonbury story and the much later legends
of King Arthur are



330 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
part of it. What we do know is that the original church of Joseph the
Aramathian has long since been said to have burnt down. We also know
that, Britain being on the edge of Rome's empire, the old traditions lasted
much longer. Furthermore that area of the country is strewn with sites
sacred to Druidism.
The trouble is that the Acts of the Apostles tells us little of the original
group — and I speak here of the future, not the past. That Peter went to
Rome is only tradition.
Visible from Glastonbury Tor is a zodiac carved into the natural
landscape. It covers an area some ten by twenty miles. As an undertaking it
is amazing. Long before its discovery, the Reverend E. W. Bullinger found
that, when opened at Leo and Virgo, the zodiac tells the story of Jesus in
pictures. This he reports in Witness of the Stars. It can be read like a
children's picture story.
Historically speaking, Joseph of Arimathea was the great-uncle of Jesus.
Legend says that he was a trader in tin, and that Jesus visited Britain with
him during his lost years, in the course of Joseph's trade. We might find
some clues in his name for, as we know, Joseph is the sun. Aram is a high
exalted place; Arimathea means height. In Mark 15: 43 he is said to be an
'honourable counsellor'. In Matthew 27: 57 he is a 'rich man', just like
Joseph in Egypt. He appears once in each of the gospels when he comes to
claim the body of Jesus and buries it in his tomb. At this point we would be
justified in being suspicious. The exalted sun, a wise counsellor of a high
place in the tree, comes to take the image of the beast and bury it in his own
tomb. Another interpretation might be that the seed of the Teacher was
buried in the tomb of the sun, from which it rose up when the stone was
rolled away. But, basically, the sun of the high place, Abraham, which rises
on the Tor, is the Star Teacher (the sun) rising in Taurus. So whence the
story of Joseph and the church at Glastonbury?
If we follow the tale from the Bible to general legend we may conclude
that Joseph not only buries Jesus in his own tomb, in which the sun has
languished for two thousand years, he succeeds him. In legendary terms,
only Joseph could found the first Christian church. Whether or not the
original circular wattle construction really was built upon the twelve hides
of Glastonbury doesn't matter from the point of view of manufacturing a
legend. You can always build one later and say the original burnt down. But
why the legend in the first place? Perhaps Britain is destined to have the
first real Christian Church in the future.



SHILOH AT THE COURT OF KING ARTHUR 331
Anciently Glastonbury, or Glassenbury, was Ynis Wytrin. The Celtic
'glais' means 'stream of water'. At this time the area was flooded, hence an
'island of glass'. It is also known as Avalon or place of the apple. No doubt
there is some link between this name and the idea that Eve gave Adam that
fruit (Apollo is the sun) from the tree (the Bible does not say it was an
apple). And amid all this sits brave King Arthur, who drew the sword from
the stone.
The word 'tor' was for the ancient Britons a high place of the bull, this
being exactly the same as the Hebrew Abraham, as I have said. No doubt
the Hebrew Torah, the books of the Old Testament sacred to Judaism, has
some association with the idea that the Law was brought down from on
high — maybe in Taurus, or more likely by Taurus, which has an
association with the Teacher/Lawgiver. Ancient bull worship clearly is a
part of this story. Even the word itself contains the Hebrew tau, which is
the letter 'T' and is a cross. The cross is the tree upon which the sun or
counsellor and lawgiver is hung, originally 'X', but subsequently
anathematized into a symbol for 'wrong' and 'hex', a curse. At the root of all
this legend lies a sacred language which was common to the ancient priests.
In his Annales, the sixteenth century Baronius tells us that in the year 35
CE Joseph and eleven others were cast adrift at Joppa in a boat without oars;
they drifted to Marseilles and from there went to Britain. Being cast adrift
in such a way sounds suspicious, especially when we find the vessel has
twelve occupants.
On arrival in Britain, we are told, they were met by the high king
Arviragus (Caractacus). This alone implies that he must have been more
than a sympathizer. He came and met them; therefore their reputation
preceded them. History also shows that it was the British who actually
proselytized Rome at the Palatium Britannicum. Britain became an
officially Christian country under King Lucius in 156 CE. This was long
before the conversion of the Latins.
King Caradoc, or Caractacus, was taken to Rome with his son Linus and
his daughters. According to Clemens Romans, the third Bishop of that city,
the Welsh Prince Linus had been the first Bishop, an assertion confirmed
later by Irenaeus. This could have been part of a concerted Essene and
Druid assault on Rome.
King Arviragus granted Joseph and his party twelve hides of land free in
perpetuity without tax. These comprise 1440 acres, symbolic of the 144,000
redeemed (Revelation 7: 4 etc.).
Without checking I might guess that the original record of this
transaction was lost when the first church burnt down, any copy



332 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
kept elsewhere having been used by some hapless ancient clerk to wrap his
lunch. It is not until 1087 that this perpetual gift is recorded in the Domus
Dei, Domesday Book. The later church was destroyed in 1184, and the
abbey in 1539. Much more to the point is that in 60 CE Boadicea, Queen of
the Iceni, was busy laying waste to Roman settlements in London,
Colchester and St Albans. The British and the Palestinians were obviously
of one mind.
John of Glastonbury (circa 1400 CE) wrote The Prophecy of Melkin the
Bard. This Melkin is obviously Maelgwyn of Avalon, who records a very
similar oracle in Historia de Rebus Brittannicus. It reads:
By the sphere-betokened to adorn a mighty virgin, thirteen dwell within
that place.
When the tomb of the Arimathian is found, all these things shall be
revealed in Jehoshaphat.
The tomb is obviously the tree: of that there is no doubt. Then who and
what is Jehoshaphat? It seems to be a repetition of the Shiloh story and a
derivation of Joseph (the sun).
Jehoshaphat is both the name of various individuals and a location.
Inasmuch as the prophecy says 'in', it must be assumed that it refers to the
place. What makes the prognostication worth investigating is the fact that it
has an air of mysteries being revealed.
Jehoshaphat is in II Samuel, I Kings, and I Chronicles the official
recorder of King David. In one sense, the Teacher may well be said to be a
recorder of the deeds of David. In I Kings the name appears as that of an
officer of Solomon. The same might apply here. In I and II Kings and I and
II Chronicles the King of Judah goes by that name. It seems that he was
esteemed by the Philistines, who brought him gifts. In II Chronicles 18: 29
31 the King of Israel changes clothes with Jehoshaphat before going into
battle, but the Syrians discover the ruse and, though they compass
Jehoshaphat about, they do not kill him; but the Lord has already decreed
that Ahab must die. If this king is the idol Jesus then we may be making
progress.
In chapter 19 Jehoshaphat is credited with putting an end to idol worship.
This is exactly what Nostradamus says of the latter-day prophet/Teacher.
All in all it does seem that Jehoshaphat plays Teacher to Ahab's idol Jesus.
But the rest of the story tends to depict more a Sceptre character
establishing the nation than a Star gathering it. The name is found again in I
Chronicles 15, as



SHILOH AT THE COURT OF KING ARTHUR 333
that of one carrying the Ark of the Covenant, and this could be applied to
the Teacher.
The territory of Jehoshaphat is mentioned in Joel 3: 2 and 12, where it
appears more profitable. This location seems a place of apocalypse, in that
all the Gentile nations are to be gathered there when the Lord calls out His
people. There He visits upon the evildoers the iniquities that they have
suffered at their hands. It would seem that 'in Jehoshaphat' refers to the
Teacher and his revelation of the sun in the tree. The territory then becomes
the time and place of these deeds. Quite clearly, whoever wrote the
prophecy knew what had been hidden and that one day it would be found.
Certainly the notion of lost secrets permeates British legend.
The earliest reference I have found to the coming of Joseph of Arimathea
to Avalon and his burial there is from Maelgwyn of Avalon, dated about
540 CE. Druidism would, at this time, still have been quite strong in
Britain. This writer is likely to have created, or simply inherited, a myth.
In City of Revelation, John Michell finds proof that the geometry and
sacred measurements of St Joseph's church at Glastonbury describe it as the
New Jerusalem (pages 54ff.).
An acre is 4840 square yards; a square area of 1440 acres has sides
measuring 7920 feet, which is exactly 12 furlongs. Twelve hides is then
seen to be an alternative description of St John's New Jerusalem, which has
a square of 12,000 furlongs. Using the description of the city in Revelation,
a circle is drawn within the square; this gives us a wall 14,400 cubits
around. This is the Egyptian royal cubit, 1.728 feet, which is 12 x 12 x 12
— refer Revelation 11: 1 (gematria of 'a reed like unto a rod'). Inside the
circle we place a hexagon, then a rectangle is drawn on its two parallel
sides. Its dimensions are 3960 x 6860 feet, this being 100 times the existing
measurements of St Joseph's Chapel, Glastonbury. This church, which is
said to have been a circular wattle construction, is manifested in this
scheme of ancient sacred geometry by placing a circle within the rectangle.
As Michell goes on to point out, the area of the building at Glastonbury
has a diameter of 39.6 feet, which is 14.56 megalithic yards. Thus the area
is 166.5 square megalithic yards, this number being a multiple of 555. As
earlier pointed out, 6 is the solar number and 666 is its ultimate expression.
Likewise, 5 signifies the earth spirit (Coma/Christ) and 555 is its ultimate
expression. According to the conventions of ancient cabalistic gematria we
find that in the



334 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Greek the term to the Spirit of the Earth, has a num
ber value of 1665. Thus the dedication of the chapel to St Mary is a
dedication to the Goddess, the Queen of the thirteenth stone. That this
should prove to be coincidence is out of the question, and it is a far from
isolated example. The ancient practice, as I have mentioned in respect of
the tree, was to establish a geometric balance of the microcosm and
macrocosm. A similar geometric layout on a much grander scale has been
found in Languedoc, France, which was an important centre of Templar
activity.
How early man came about these numbers is anyone's guess. Perhaps we
should accept the tradition that the mystic sciences were revealed by the
angels. It is possible that, just as we have exploited the development of the
left brain masculine to its full extent, ancient man developed the feminine
in like manner. No doubt the Age of Aquarius is the time when these
separately developed forces will be brought together in perfect balance. But
we can only speculate; there is no way of knowing. All we can be sure of is
that under the Druids Western Europe had a much more sophisticated
culture than we might otherwise have thought. The march of history has not
been linear; there has somehow been a folding of time — like the two sides
of the moon or of a coin, never meeting, never knowing each other.
Perhaps the rise of the Roman empire was the pivotal point at which the
coin flipped over. At that juncture, an epoch of human understanding was
not only lost, but lost to our ken.
Rome never did quite conquer Britain. For many similar reasons it had as
much to fear from the Druids as from the Palestinian Essenes, who were,
like their counterparts, determined to stem Roman power — and, I contend,
for exactly the same reasons. As Graves points out in The White Goddess
(page 39), the Druid or Derwyd was an 'oak seer', a poet to unravel the
tangled 'oak tops'. His one all-consuming concern was with the cosmic tree
in its many forms.
Certainly, working in cooperation with the Hebrew Christians down the
centuries, there would have been ample time to build the myths in Britain.
The fact is that the start of Christianity in these islands is very early. This
has always presented a puzzle. In the last sixty or seventy years it has
become clear that Druidism differed very little, if at all, from biblical
Judaism. From the history of the birth of British Christianity it is evident
that the transition from one faith to the other was very smooth and in no
way effected by a Jesus. It was likely no transition at all. But the important
question



SHILOH AT THE COURT OF KING ARTHUR 335
is why were the British involved at all in manufacturing this massive edifice. Surely
their inclusion would only serve to complicate the issue. The discovery of the Nag
Hammadi codices again demonstrates that the old faith continued under a different
title; hiding behind this new name, so-called paganism, increasingly weakened,
nevertheless survived well into our age. But what if real Christianity is destined to
begin in Britain?
Conclusion
In this section, which begins yet another approach to this epic, we started by
looking at a brief history of the Arthurian legends, which I relate to the New
Testament stories of the two Jesuses, these being Arthur and Merlin. I went on to
say yet again that there once was a time when mankind was governed by shamanic
priests, whom Scripture terms 'the holy people'. In order that there might come a
time when all of mankind might comprise this spiritualized creature, the power of
the priests was shattered by God. The chaos that has subsequently arisen will bring
humanity to eventual crisis, and this will sort the wheat from the chaff. I pointed out
that, most significantly, in Revelation 20: 3 we are told that a thousand years after
this event there will be yet another purification, brought about by the loosing of the
devil. This, I argue, is again evidence of catastrophic evolution.
It is, perhaps, not well known that there is a very strong tradition that, after the
passion, Mary and the disciples went to Britain and there built the first Christian
church. It having been argued that this, too, is prophecy, we shall now go on to see
that there existed definite connections between the Essenes of Palestine and the
Druids of Britain. In this section we have seen a few tenuous links between
Scripture and British tradition. This theme will be expanded.
Most important of all is that the church at Glastonbury was built in precise
proportion to the New Jerusalem as described in the book of Revelation. Having
seen earlier that Stonehenge also conforms to the measures of the temple in
Revelation, we now have positive proof that the biblical city is a pagan temple. It so
happens that the inclusion of Revelation in the sacred canon met with vigorous
protests from the Roman traditionalists, who declared it to be a collection of pagan
heresies. The evidence in Appendices I and II clearly and irrefutably shows that
whatever can be said of any one of the books of Scripture must be said of them all.
Furthermore, it will now be apparent that there is very little in this work that can be
attributed solely to the author's viewpoint.

St Joseph at Glastonbury
It would be far too easy just to write off Rome and her brand of Paulistic
Jesusology. The simple fact of the matter is that, long before they were
proselytized by Druids and Essenes, the Romans were themselves
originally quite happily and healthily pagan.
What made her a suitable candidate as the Christian Dark, as opposed to
the Judaic Dark, was that at that time Rome had already become a
materialistic and hedonistic society fed by empire. Corrupted by
materialism, the people were easily converted to physical gods. But why a
Christian and Judaic Dark? The answer is a simple one: Christianity would
become a fence around false Judaism. One cannot uncover the false Israel
until one abandons the effigy of traditional Christianity.
Now, as any reasonably honest historian will tell you, the contemporary
picture of European history at the dawn of our era is sketchy and extremely
limited. With our new paradigm, however, we are in a position to make far
greater sense of the events occurring in the first six or seven centuries of
our age. Mundane and obvious though the point may appear to be, we need
only keep in mind, when we use the term 'early' or 'primitive' Christianity,
that this bears no resemblance or relationship to what later became
Romanized Paulism, which is itself the sole parent of modern belief.
Primitive or pagan Christianity was precisely that: paganism. It did not in
any sense differ from Druidism or Essenism. This set of philosophies was,
by its nature, capable of diverse expression without shifting at all from its
immutable base. But even our using the term 'pagan' is misleading here
because — as must be obvious by now — Druidism and Essenism, and in
fact the multitudinous names by which the original and prehistoric
Christianity was known throughout the globe, were in reality monotheistic:
it is we who are pagans, idolizing and naming as God a pile of dead flesh
hanging from a tree. Yet again, we see that what we take to be reality is
actually only a mirror image. But magically, by this means, this
doppelganger is a way of revealing the wondrous city: Satchitananda.
Rome then became an epicentre of the Dark and, as we move out to
Europe's remoter parts, we see that there were lights still



ST JOSEPH AT GLASTONBURY 337
switched on here and there (see Appendix IV). In this respect, the history
of Britain becomes very interesting. That it was 'Christian' long before
Rome and that the British actually proselytized the Latins is no longer open
to question. The trick seems to have been to set Rome's house ablaze and
then minimize impact upon one's own territory. The damage had to be
extensive but contained.
The conquest of Britain was not an alien invasion in the sense that it was
in Palestine: the Gallic, German and Latin tribes were all branches of the
same family tree.
It is a commonly held belief that the Gospel was taken to Rome and
there spread abroad. Not so: the evidence supporting its origins in Britain is
overwhelming.
With tongue in cheek, the British claimed that it was Joseph of
Arimathea and the apostles of Jesus himself who converted them shortly
after the passion. In the mean time they continued living by their Druidic
traditions. At this point in time there existed substantial colonies of Romans
in these islands whose loyalty and eyes were still toward their motherland,
just as — for argument's sake — may be the case today with New
Zealanders, Australians and Canadians who still look respectfully to
Britain. As Pauline doctrine gathered strength in Rome, likewise would it
have done so in Roman Britain, where there would have been numerous
families that clung to their origins and followed Italian fashion and other
trends — a simple case of monkey see, monkey do. No sooner than
necessary, and only when required, the Druid flamens titled themselves
bishops and the arch-flamens archbishops. Through the centuries, the lights
were going out. Druidism was weakening and Paulism was gathering
strength through the increasingly dominant masculine forces of our age.
The subsequent lust for power became such that even the blindingly
obvious was ignored. For example there is an aspect of the crucifixion that
effectively convicts religious academia of perpetuating a lie from the very
beginning.
In the story, the crowd is given the choice of releasing either Jesus or
Barabbas, whose first name is also Jesus. 'Bar' means 'son' and 'abba' means
'father', a New Testament surrogate for God; hence Jesus Barabbas (Jesus
the son of God) escapes crucifixion while Paul's beast is hung on the cross.
It is evident from this point alone that a corrupt religion was fed into an
already decadent empire. Furthermore, the theme of escaping the cross is
central to Templar-ism and modern Freemasonry, and it is also found in the
Nag Hammadi texts.



338 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Up till the early part of the seventh century, Rome was being
progressively devoured by a foreign religion it inherited at the beginning of
its own corruption and decline. It was also under the impression that this
faith was one that it had imbibed long after the far-off islands of Britain
and accordingly deferred to her as the heartland of Christendom. Rome was
at this time not only down to its knees in idol worship, it was becoming
aware that this religion offered the prospect of a second empire. Word must
have been reaching the city from its loyalist children in Britain that Chris
tianity had either gone into what they then would have termed pagan
decline or, conversely, that the British had somehow lost the plot and were
failing to show the same zeal as Rome. The Venerable Bede, in Historia
Ecclesiastica (LIB.I,C.XXX), says that in 601 CE Pope Gregory instructed
the British Archbishop to compromise with paganism. He said 'It is not
possible to cut off all things at once from obdurate minds; he who
endeavours to rise to heaven cannot do so by leaps and bounds, but must
rise by degrees'.
Being now strong, the popes began sending to Britain missionaries who
were peremptorily told they were not required. Druidism held out for as
long as it could, and this is evidenced by the character of, particularly, the
non-English inhabitants of the country today, who, despite the English,
have retained their peculiarly Celtic and pagan spirit. Rome had been sold a
pup, one which the salesmen said had died and been resurrected. I doubt
that this city's now dominant male arrogance would ever have allowed her
to admit this to herself but, as is evidenced by the heavy-handed actions of
the Church throughout the age, she had clearly lost something and was
determined she would find it or stamp it out. Destabilized, Rome took
draconian steps to ensure that everyone else's reality conformed to her own
topsy turvy view. How could she otherwise hold that reality?
It is a wonderful curiosity of history that, in 1492, because of her
commitment to the Catholic faith, Spain expelled her Jews. These were the
Sephards, the actual descendants of those driven out of Palestine in 70 CE.
Steeped in cabala and alchemy, they had fostered the cultural rise of Spain.
Expelled, many went to Italy, where, in the small states at Rome's doorstep,
they were substantially responsible for the Renaissance, of which we are
the direct benefactors. These events are expanded upon in Appendix IV.
This strange set of events was facilitated by the fact that, while the more
remote states and communities viewed Rome as a religious



ST JOSEPH AT GLASTONBURY 339
centre, her neighbours saw her for what she really was — a politically
motivated threat. It is now clear that many of the great religious paintings
and writings that emerged from this period, such as the work of men like
Leonardo da Vinci, were used to subtly express their disgust at the idea of
Jesus as God, and that he was ever crucified or even existed. Leonardo was
not of Sephardic origin, but one of many great minds who embraced the
resurgence. Even the Shroud of Turin — now generally accepted as being
his work, commissioned by the then Pope — is believed by many to be a
self-portrait. Likewise, in his Last Supper — which has two virtually
identical Jesuses — he has portrayed himself as the second disciple from
the right, his back turned to Jesus in an attitude of indifference.
After Roman withdrawal from Britain — the Dark now rising at a pace
— Druidism was in a weakened state and unable to reassert itself. The
country was now beset by coastal raiders and invaders from the continent,
and had virtually no means for its own defence. The privations of this
period would have made recolonization through the Church a very
welcome stabilizing force. This, as it transpired, was nothing more than
annexation, with no other objective than to commandeer property and
collect taxes in the typical manner of the colonist. The old traditions were
finally finished off by the Normans and, later, Henry VIII put paid to
remaining Celtic power in Ireland. But the British never did fully succumb
to the religion of the Latin Church; in fact there are instances such as Puri
tanism which, although negative, demonstrate a distaste for food that the
British themselves had originally prepared. But it must be realized that
primitive Christianity did not invent or create this situation: it was turning
the inevitable to its own advantage.
That Joseph of Arimathea and some of the apostles arrived in Britain
some nineteen hundred years ago may now be dismissed as historical
nonsense. But — and it is a very big but — the web woven around this
story and its ramifications is powerful indeed. We need therefore to look
more closely at the artistry and genius of the bards who as early as 68 BCE
planted Mithraism in Rome as a doctrine preparatory to, and to aid the
transition to, Christianity.
Central to the legends of Insula Avalonia is the story of Joseph and his
party arriving at Weary-all (Wyrall) Hill, where he thrust his staff — some
say it was Jesus' own — into the ground and it budded, becoming the Holy
Thorn Tree. It will be recalled that the priest's staff symbolizes the cosmic
tree. In Exodus 7: 9 Aaron's staff becomes a serpent; in verse 17 Moses' rod
turns water (the



340 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
words of God) into blood — the menses of Coma (wisdom). It also buds
and becomes a tree.
But it must be emphasized again that this magic tree should not be seen
in isolation. It is universal. In Crete the goddess Europa was worshipped in
the form of a sacred tree, and in Polynesia the Goddess arose from the
sacred breadfruit tree. In Europe the Fairy Queen hid herself in the Tree of
Immortality, and her consort, the King of the Dwarfs (the sun), was hidden
in a cloak of invisibility. The Chinese had a World Tree that supported the
universe, while Egypt had the sycamore of the sky goddess. Ygdrasil was
the ash with a well at its root which provided the Hades-water of immor
tality, while the well at On was known as the spring of the sun. Indra
constructed the World House around a great tree and, in that same
tradition, the Hindu Noah was Vaiswasvata.
In China the sacred Peach Tree was cared for by the Lady Si Wang Mu,
the queen of the immortals and mother of the Western King (the sun). She
was known as the Royal Mother of the West (Coma sits in the west wall of
the temple). In Chinese tradition there was a broken pillar of heaven in the
domain of the white (albino) tiger of the west (Coma); it was later repaired
with coloured stones. Myrrha, the mother of Adonis, was a myrrh tree. In
Jubilees 14: 3 Abraham complains to God that he has no seed to inherit. He
is told to go outside and count the stars, and then told 'thus shall your seed
be' — obviously, as the spermatozoa of the Milky Way in Taurus. In China
the Milky Way was the Celestial Ho, an Atlantian-type perfect island. In
the north of China, Buddhism held that there was a garden of the Lady of
the West; within it, beneath the Peach Tree of Immortality, the Lady sat
weaving the web of the stars. The initiated could reach the garden only by
crossing the Celestial River (words of God) in dragon boats, the dragon
being a solar deity. In ancient traditions the land of the dead was invariably
located in the west.
Quite commonly the Goddess is born of or springs up from water (the
universal unconscious) and, as often as not, her soul substance lives in the
sap of trees. Another common strand of myth says that the tears of the
Goddess became the stones that were the source of creation; but she, in
turn, is seen to spring from water (God's wisdom given through the
Teacher's revelation). Again, in Jubilees 34: 15 both Dinah (the moon) and
Bilhah (a version of the Goddess) die on the same day as Joseph (the sun) is
reported dead. But the simplest and most beautiful of these stories tells us
that the



ST JOSEPH AT GLASTONBURY 341
stone of the Queen of Heaven is a gemstone that shines in the dark. Equally
simple and brilliant is the idea that the Teacher in the role of Bacchus
became fascinated with his image in a mirror (the past) and was
subsequently boiled in water (the word of God) by the Titans, who, as I
have already pointed out, are the giants of the Piscean Age, who will be
contemptuous of him and his revelations. The Glastonbury Thorn — legend
or not — is a very real tree which has the unusual property of budding
twice: in May and around Christmas. It is related to the Levantine
(Palestinian) thorn, which buds once only. It is of the variety Crataegus
monogyna prae-cox. Richard mentions it in his Life of Joseph of Arimathea
in 1520 CE. The tree was attacked and severely damaged by Puritans, who
sought to destroy objects of veneration, but Godfrey Goodman (1583
1656), Bishop of Gloucester, reports that it still budded. The present tree is
said to be a cutting from the original. The question arises, does it confirm
history or myth?
From the evidence, the following points may be made:
1. Given that the Papacy was established in Rome, it is clear that the
Church was an attempt to re-establish the imperium. Otherwise Britain
would have been the more logical and obvious choice, historically
speaking.
2. The Christianity of Rome was vastly different to that of Britain, and it
was overwhelmed by that same imperialism much later on.
3. Seeing that our evidence now clearly shows Roman Christianity to be
pagan myth, the links between the Druids of Britain and the Essenes of
Palestine are certain. No doubt Britain's geographical location at the
furthest reaches from the centre of empire supported this association.
Rome became officially Christian under Constantine in 326 CE. It is
abundantly clear that this Emperor's motives were purely political. His
inclination was towards Solar Invictus (the invincible sun), a religion
commonly described as pagan sun worship, but he could see that
Christianity was up and coming. His commitment was thus supposedly to
both faiths.
The first signs of Christianity seen in Rome occur at the Palatium
Britannicum, named thus because it was originally the home of the noble
Rufus Pudens and his British wife Claudia Britannica (Gladys), the
daughter of King Caractacus (Caradoc) and sister of Linus the first Bishop
of Rome, 69 CE, martyred 90 CE (Cardinal Baronius, Ecclesiastical Annals,
vol. 1, page 778). The marriage must have been political, with a view to
establishing Paulism at the heart of



342 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
the empire. This house stood on Viminalis Hill; it later became the site of
the church dedicated to St Pudentiana. The writer Martial (circa 68 CE)
identifies Claudia as British when referring to her as 'Claudia Peregrina et
edita Britannis' (Martial 13B, XI, 53). He also refers to Rufus as 'her holy
husband'. This gives us a direct link between the British Druid
Christianization of Rome, 2 Timothy and Paul's letter to the Romans. At
Chichester, this same 'Most Holy Pudens' built a temple to Neptune and
Minerva. It was dedicated to Tiberius Claudius, who died in 37 CE.
Caractacus and his family — including Claudia — went as prisoners to
Rome in 51 CE. Caractacus's father, Bran, was an Arch-Druid. Lionel
Smithett Lewis, in St Joseph of Arimathea at Glastonbury,35 quotes from
Tacitus and Triads, 18 and 35, 3rd series, Myvyrian Archives (The Book of
Caradoc of Llancarvan), vol. 2, in confirmation of this. It is this Bran who
later becomes mythologized as Bran the Blessed, whose white head was
buried at White Hill (the supposed site of the Tower of London).
St Joseph is said to have brought with him two stone cruets (a version of
the Holy Grail), which contained the blood and sweat of Jesus. The blood is
the menses of Coma and the sweat is from the heat of the sun in the tree.
According to legend, the thorn sprouted where Arviragus met Joseph on
Weary-all Hill. It was his staff that grew there to become the Holy Thorn.
Pitsaeus, in Historia de Rebus Anglitis (1619), seems to have inherited the
tradition that Arviragus was an illustrious writer of Britain, in which case
he need not have met Joseph the sun on Weary-all Hill in the historical
sense: he need only have invented the story. The holy tree could have
originally been brought from Palestine by a visiting Essene to complement
the myth. But the very important Lucius (Lux), great-grandson of
Caractacus, must now come under scrutiny, because his British name,
Lleiver Mawr — like the Latin — means 'Great Luminary', and he may be
nothing more substantial than the sun in the tree. But even so, the records
show that Lucius brought Elfan to Britain and he became the second Bishop
of London. The Book of Llandaff says he was consecrated in Rome; it is
also claimed he was founder of St Peter's at Cornhill. Geoffrey of
Monmouth quotes Gildas (516-570) in a lost book The Victory of Aurelius
Ambrosius as listing these missionaries. This story is repeated in the Liber
Pontificalis (circa 685 CE). The Venerable Bede (675-735) confirms Lucius'
request for missionaries, but the first truly substantiated mission is that of
Augustine in 597 CE. It is,



ST JOSEPH AT GLASTONBURY 343
furthermore, noteworthy that the Glastonbury tradition keeps bringing up
the number of twelve disciples.
It seems that, no matter how many converts join the faith, Glastonbury
continues with this figure — in honour, it is said, of the original group.
Likewise, it is said that, at about the dawn of our era, Odin arrived in
Sweden and established the priesthood called the twelve Drottars (Druids).
Central to their belief and ritual was the death and resurrection of Baldar, a
sun god and yet another version of the sun of God who died on the cosmic
tree. He was succeeded by Thor the thunder god (Jesus the sun in Pisces).
Odin, the sun, was one-eyed and Baldar his son was (like Jesus) betrayed
by one of the twelve — Loki (a Judas) — after he had built Asgard, the city
of the gods (the cosmic tree). Mythologically speaking, this raises doubts
about the historical role of old King Lucius. And what's more this all came
to an end when the Romanite St Patrick became first Abbot of Glastonbury,
which was probably the district of his birth and home — see William of
Malmesbury's Antiquities of Glastonbury, chapter 2. This is confirmed by
St Dunstan's Psalter. St Patrick is, incidentally, credited with chasing all the
snakes out of Ireland: the snakes were serpents and these were the
serpentine magi. Thus, as a herald of the Piscean Age and the Roman Dark,
St Patrick overcame the magi. A further point that cannot be overlooked,
when considering the mythic role of King Lucius as the sun in the tree, is
that his and St Joseph's tradition never seem to intersect: the claim is either
that the Arimathean founded the first church or that King Lucius (Lucifer)
Christianized Britain. Logically you cannot have two suns or two thirteenth
signs in one tree. This is yet another of the countless allusions to a true and
false star that one constantly encounters.
There is a much greater mystery here, which manifests time and again.
The tribe of Dan is symbolized by an eagle, and the eagle is universally
found in contention with the serpent. In India the man-eagle was Garuda,
while even in the tradition of remote Australia there is found this same idea.
I have repeatedly said that Dan (Scorpio) was the supposed thirteenth sign,
but in Genesis 49: 17 he is called 'a serpent'. Interestingly, he was the
'illegitimate' son of Jacob Israel by Bilhah, the handmaid of Rachel
(Arachne the spider and legitimate Goddess).
The eagle is prominent in heraldry. It was an ensign for Rome and is
such for the United States, Rome's most recent descendant, which I believe
is destined to become the military enforcer for the



344 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
false Israel. Curiously, there is a tradition which says that the Antichrist
will emerge from the tribe of Dan. This name means 'judgement', and Philo
says it is the tribe of division. On the principle that God uses the Dark to
sharpen the light, it is clear that this is all yet more allegory referring to the
Wicked Priest and the present false Israel. Interestingly, in Revelation 7: 4
8, where the 144,000 redeemed from the twelve tribes are named, Dan is
excluded, and Joseph replaces him as the true source. Verse 9 reads:
After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could
number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood
before the throne, anf before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and
palms in their hands...
This verse alone emphatically denies the concept of one chosen 'race'.
With the exclusion of Dan, which represents the present false Khazar
Israel, these verses specifically exclude this nation. The rest of the chapter
goes on to confirm that these diverse peoples are the true Israel. Verse 14
concludes:
...These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed
their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
That is to say, they are those from all nations who hearkened to the
Teacher's revelation and message, and remained faithful to God during the
tribulation of the Last Days despite the pretensions of the Wicked Priest,
who tested that loyalty, and it is these events that are played out in the Old
Testament epics.
The date of the foundation of the Glastonbury church seems to be
somewhere between 37 and 63 CE. Gildas the Wise (425-512 CE) sets it in
the last years of the reign of Tiberius (circa 37 CE). Smithett Lewis (page
20) says the Greek Church holds to the tradition that St Peter the Zealot was
martyred in Britain on 10 May 44 CE. Cardinal Baronius supports this date,
and Hippolytus (born circa 160 CE) has Peter Zealotes as Bishop of the
Britons. Pynson's Metrical Life of St Joseph (1520 CE) also supports these
dates for Peter. Eusebius (260-340 CE) says in his De Demonstratione Evan
gelii, Lib. III, that the apostles came to Britain. The Venerable Bede (740
CE) in his Ecclestiastical History, book 2, chapter 23, declares the British
Church to be the enemy of the Roman in their mass, customs and tonsure.



ST JOSEPH AT GLASTONBURY 345
Maelgwyn of Avalon (Melchinus Avalonius), circa 560 CE, supports the
historical precedence of Britain. In Three Conversions of England (vol. 1,
page 26) Robert Parsons says that Britain's conversion came through
Joseph, Fagan and Dyfan, and St Augustine. Dean Alford in Regia Fides
(vol. 1, page 19) says Aristobulus was converting in these islands before
Paul was doing so in Rome. But there is also a strong tradition that Paul
(the false prophet) visited there — see W. Morgan's St Paul in Britain.36
Polydore Vergil (born 1470), who was Prebendary of Brent and
Archdeacon of Wells, says Christianity came to the isles of the Atlantic
through Joseph, Fugatus and Damianus (History of England, Lib. II).
Gildas Bardonicus (Fox's Acts and Mon., vol. VI, p. 568) says Britain was
first to see the light of Christ. The Venerable Bede (circa 740 CE) says the
faith was preserved under King Lucius until the time of Diocletian. The
Lleiver, or Lleufer Mawr (circa 170 CE) supports the King Lucius story. St
Augustine, who came to convert the island Celts, was rejected by existing
British clerics (Bede's Ecclesiastical History, book II, chapter 2). Lionel
Smithett Lewis (a vicar of Glastonbury) in St Joseph of Arimathea at
Glastonbury says (page 18) that the country's Christian pre-eminence was
never disputed until 1409, when the French and Spanish did so for political
reasons. Its claim was asserted at the Councils of Pisa in 1409, Constance
in 1417, Sienna in 1424 and Basle in 1434, where it was stated that the
British Church 'Statim post passionem Christi'. Archbishop Ussher of
Armagh (Ussher, chapter II) points out that the gift of twelve hides is
confirmation of its claims. William of Malmesbury speaks of the original
faith of Glastonbury as progressively going into decline — the Light fading
and the Dark rising.
Smithett Lewis (page 51) quotes E. V. Duff, a Count of the Holy Roman
Empire, as saying that a tradition among Palestinian Maronites in Upper
Galilee has Jesus as a shipwright visiting Britain on a vessel from Tyre.
(This boat, I propose, is the tree.)
One is tempted here to quote William Blake:
And did those feet in ancient times, Walk upon England's mountains
green? And was the holy lamb of God On England's pleasant pastures
seen?
Even St Augustine, writing to Pope Gregory the Great, says that the
Glastonbury church was built by Jesus' own hands (Concilia,



346 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
page 5). That could well prove to be true at some future date. Joseph was
known as Joseph de Marmore of Arimathea; both 'more' (eastern) and
'mawr' (Celtic) mean 'great lord'. John of Glastonbury has King Arthur as
the tenth generation from Joseph of Arimathea. In the Welsh Brenline
Prydian Oll, King Arthur is the eighty-sixth generation from Brutus
(Brutannia). An old tradition has it that all the knights of the round table
were descended from the Arimathean. If he is the sun and they are the
twelve zodiacal signs upon the tree, then this is certainly true.
But ultimately this entire game is given away by Maelgwyn (Melchinus)
when he speaks of the burial of Joseph at Glastonbury:
Et jacet in linea bifurcata juxta meridianum angulum oratorii, crati-bus
preparatis, super potentum adorandam Virgininem supradictis spherulatis
locum habitantibus tredecim.
This tells us that Joseph is buried at Glastonbury on top of the Virgin
Mary, which means that she is there too. Where else can these two — sun
and Goddess — be buried but in the dead Piscean tree? This becomes
particularly clear with the use of the word 'spherulatis', a past participle of
'sphera', which is a circle (the zodiac) of 'tredecim', thirteen. Thus we see
why Glastonbury was known as 'secretum domini', the secret of the Lord.
In St Joseph of Arimathea at Glastonbury, Smithett Lewis (page 170) says
this passage from Maelgwyn has been an age-long puzzle. It now translates
as saying that the place where Joseph (the sun) has been buried and will be
found is:
Next to the south corner of the house of prayer, made of prepared wattles
over the adorable powerful Virgin by the aforesaid circle of thirteen inhabiting
that place.
The south corner is Aquarius, the tree is the temple or house of prayer
and this is where Joseph will be found on top of the adorable Virgin in the
process of procreating the children of Aquarius — surrounded by the
zodiacal circle of thirteen.
Ultimately, all this begs the question. Precisely what do we mean when
we speak of history? And exactly what can we now be sure of in the ancient
past? But — as a matter of pure speculation — what if, prophetically
speaking, the ancient dates BCE are read as being before our year 2000 CE?
I.e. is 1997 3 BCE etc.?



ST JOSEPH AT GLASTONBURY 347
Conclusion
This is a short but long-winded section in which I hope to have demonstrated three
points:
1. There is a well-established tradition that Britain was the first country to convert
to Christianity. This I treat as evidence that the Teacher will appear in Britain; that
he is, in fact, British.
2. By elucidation of the Joseph of Arimathea legends we may now see a direct link
between the Druids and Essenes. It may be contended that this evidence of a very
early and separate British tradition argues against my proposal that it is all prophecy
and that it actually confirms history. The fact of the matter is that the influence of
the Roman Church in Britain was very slow to manifest and never did take healthy
roots. This left British Druidism relatively free. The similarity between it and
Essenism alone shows us that the British connection with this epic is an integral part
of the entire Last Days story, just as are the Scrolls and the vast body of legend
from around the world.
3. A point of little or no consequence: This book was clearly not put together on the
basis of guesswork and imagination. The evidence is obviously there. We need only
see that it is open to interpretation. Quite clearly, purely scientific, masculine
investigation is not enough. The story I am telling is manifestly different because I
am considering the feminine, poetic elements as real and actual.
Presented with the material in this section, even the meanest intelligence would
be forced to conclude that the ancient world was playing a game with time. Given
its vulnerability to poetic manipulation, we are forced to admit, as Henry Ford said:
History is bunk. And, if memory serves me, the writer Dion Fortune once said:
Thou hast conquered, O Galilean! From Glastonbury!
Where Anglesey was a base for male Druids, Avalon was home to a college of
women. In 563 CE St Columba pulled down the stone atop the tor at Avalon, that he
might 'purge the witches from the hill'.
How sad. How very sad that ignorance of such obscene proportions should be let
loose in the world. But you say: So what!? And I say: Tell that to your Maker on the
Day of Judgement. Then shall the demons of your mind — the devils of your own
creation — reach out and possess you. And slowly and inexorably destroy you. This
because you, in some way, condoned or contributed to the hurting and killing of the
saints.

Three Things
Each and every one of us makes his or her living through the exercise of a
certain skill, which may from time to time be subject to market forces. That
such skills should be classified so as to give to individuals, or deprive them
of, social and economic status is wrong. It is for each to find his or her own
social position. Even the least in the kingdom contributes to a common
pool of needs. In our official capacities, from the king to the road sweeper,
we are all equally in service to the common good. If competent in our
diverse tasks, we are all due equal respect, privilege and restriction under
the law. That accumulated wealth should make the law unequal, this more
than anything will guarantee that maximum power will sit in the most
unsuitable hands. Societies, like individuals, are capable of contracting
cancer and then being consumed. A culture need never die: it is invariably
killed by corruption, which cannot distinguish between parasitism and
symbiosis.
It is a remarkable thing that, at present, were we each as individuals to
face the life-threatening dangers that we now do collectively, there would
be panic on the streets and heads of government would roll. What is it in
each and every one of us that convinces us that somehow we shall be
excused the death, doom and destruction that face the rest of humanity?
More to the point is that our present level of exploited mental capacity
only allows a knee-jerk reaction. Those capable of anticipating oncoming
danger are few and far between, and are hindered in or prevented from
taking action by the sloth of the majority who, like animals, are only
concerned with instant gratification.
This, and only this, is the correction that nature will soon make. This
entire book can, in fact, be reduced to a single statement: pretty well all that
the ancient world left behind was left as a warning that either we learn this
truth or we will be annihilated — totally.
Given its divine origins, we will not be allowed to destroy the planet, and
we will not be permitted to hinder that which will surely come to pass.
Conversely, from the king to the road sweeper, we are none of us excluded
from entering the kingdom of heaven on earth. It is all as simple and as
complex as joining the mind to the heart.



THREE THINGS 349
Building on past knowledge and experience is of inestimable importance
to any society. For this reason the ruthlessly honest historian is an
important requisite to any community; the past guides our future. Thus an
amateur investigator who, for example, writes a book such as The
Thirteenth Stone, in which he berates not only academia but all and sundry,
may not necessarily do so for negative reasons. It may well be done in love
and concern for us all. It may also be motivated by self-preservation, for
our futures are collectively held.
There is much in history that is ignored by theologians even though it is
clearly documented and indeed blatantly obvious. What is utterly
incomprehensible is the extraordinary mental gymnastics that academia
must constantly perform in order that it might circumnavigate it. I wonder
precisely what kind of demon possesses these miscreants that they should
have made their calculation of smooth things and ignored an intaglio and
integer in its entirety, as is the case with that which follows.
Legend says that, long before the Essenes concocted the story of Jesus,
the sun of God that was hung upon a tree, the Druids were annually
crucifying a god with the same name — Hesus. This is well known to
students of religion and mythology, yet it is overlooked by Christian
theologians. This is, at best, criminal negligence.
Tan', 'ton', 'tor', 'tot', 'twy', and 'tyn' are still found as terminations of
English and Welsh place names. They denote a high place or holy hill
where the annual crucifying of Hesus/Hu upon a tree took place. The Bel
tan was an ancient Celtic festival which celebrated the bringing down of
sacred fire. 'Tene' is fire, 'bel' or 'beli' is the sun, 'El' is the Hebrew for
'God', 'eb-el' or 'a-bel' was a small river or stream, and water, as I have
repeatedly said, is the words of God. Likewise, the Sanskrit 'svasti' means 'a
well' and its derivative 'swastika' is a symbol of the sun. Hence we see in
this instance that the word in the beginning was God. In Sanskrit 'nad'
means the making of a sound, 'nada' means 'river', and the Welsh 'neidr'
means 'snake'. 'Nad' (Welsh) is a high-pitched noise and 'nad-er' is a shrill
cry. 'Nadder' has given us the snake name 'adder', adding is a process of
arithmetical calculation, and God is the Great Numberer. This indicates a
relationship between God, water, the sun and the wise serpent who utters
the words of God as a river may flow — or he derives them from a deep
well in the sun.
Hesus or Hu Gadarn was one of the three benefactors of the Cymry. If
we take him to be the serpent Teacher, the other two



350 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
must be the Sceptre and John the Baptist (the standing stone). The latter
two are important as such because it was once a tradition that if a man
walked around Stonehenge and counted the stones more than once he
would never arrive at the same number; logically he would first count
eleven and then thirteen. Hu was the Celtic bringer of wisdom, and the
foundation of his knowledge is said to lie in the symbol \ | /, which is both
the name of God and the three sacred pillars of the tree.
The Beltane — bringing down of the sun — later became the Christian
Easter (Astarte — oestrus — is the Goddess). Easter falls on the first
Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox, and it
celebrates the rising (resurrection) of Jesus the Teacher. This all takes place
at Whitsuntide, which celebrates the descent of the Holy Spirit — the white
sun descending. This makes our Jesus a sort of white son of the sun.
This story has its antithesis in the mid-winter (Christmas) festival of
cutting the mistletoe (a Druid symbol for love and wisdom) from the sacred
oak with the golden crescent. Mistletoe was a gift that descended from
heaven, like the thirteenth stone; it was Prenawyr; its healing (tree
repairing) properties gave it the name 'all-heal'. That a kiss may be taken
under the mistletoe probably gave rise to the idea of the Prince (Teacher)
awakening the Sleeping Beauty (Goddess) with a kiss.
In the British version of the Great Flood, it was when the Llyn Llion
the watery abyss — burst forth that the Celtic world was inundated. The
sole male and female survivors were Dwyvan and Dwyvach. Their ark was
the ship of Nevydd Hav Neivion. Much later, Hu Gadarn led the people
from the land between the sea of Afez and Deffrobani to live in the White
Isle, the home of Dwyvan and Dwyvach. On their journey one tribe (the
Umbri) settled what is now Italy. Later, part of the Lloegrys settled in what
became Liguria — northern Italy and Gaul. The rest then went on to Gwas
gwyn (Gascony), then north to Armorica (Brittany), which was Llydaw ar y
Mor Ucha. These were the lands of the vine, and legend says that Merlin
ended his days there. The remainder crossed the Mor Tawch (English
Channel) to Ynys Wen (White Island). Later, the isle was called Prydain
and its inhabitants the Pretani.
The Cymry were originally the Y Lyn Troia, the people of Troy. This
takes us back to the Bible as a Trojan horse, showing us that these myths
were built on an international basis, and confirming that they point to the
idea that, after the Aquarian flood, the



THREE THINGS 351
knowledge of Jesus the Teacher — in the role of Hesus/Hu Gadarn in this
instance — is the foundation stone of the new world. Jesus is then the 'sun'
of God. To worship him is to worship a star, God meanwhile remaining
invisible. The kingship of Hu was handed to Brutus (the Sceptre) when he
followed on from Troy: hence Brutannia (now Britannia). Legend has it
that at that time Aburi (Avebury) was the seat where kings were crowned.
Could the priests of Aburi have been the Abiru, whom we now think of as
the Hebrews? Anciently, abir was a bull, and this may well have been the
origins of both 'Hebrew' and 'Abraham', whom I have shown is Taurus.
Further, the Tor (holy hill) was sacred to Venus, the ruling planet of the
bull. But this gives rise to a wonderful curiosity, because being 'Hebrews'
— sons of the bull, or sons of Abraham — will be claimed as a source of
origin by both the true and the false Israel. That the Teacher as a Taurean
— Abraham's son — is the source of this concept is without doubt. But this
particular beast has a twist to its tail. This will involve us in yet another
brief detour, but will convincingly show that the Last Days epic of which
we are speaking is not a random thing.
The reader will recall that Lucifer is the biblical Antichrist, king of Tyre,
that Lucifer — meaning light — is Venus, the morning star, and that she is
the ruling planet of Taurus. It has been noted as well that the mythology
relating the entire epic to this zodiacal sign is very considerable. It can be
said to imply, in many instances, that the Antichrist is also a son of the bull
— the Minotaur.
Of primary significance is the fact that the Teacher is a Taurean. But, that
being so, we must ask why the Taurus-related material goes beyond him
and involves the Antichrist, of all people. The biblical testimony (almost
certainly because of my own limitations) seems inconclusive — even with
Jehovah having his origin as a bull — but the evidence below confirms my
conclusion.
The simple fact is that both Israels will lay claim to being Abraham's
sons — sons of the bull. The reader may also recall that the Antichrist
begins with great wisdom and is much beloved of God, as is the case with
Solomon and Lucifer. Obviously he will have both the charisma and the
economic and political clout to put to rights a world in chaos — as was the
case with Adolph Hitler, for example, who incidentally was a Taurean.
Against such a man the Teacher must appear as a reactionary. Hence, as
Jesus, he is the stone the builders of the New Jerusalem will reject. By this
very simple process, only those with spiritual integrity, those with the



352 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
required evolutionary factor, will cling stubbornly to the Law which, as
Moses, the Teacher brings down from the mountain of God — the cosmic
tree. But does this mean that, in order to confuse everyone, the Antichrist is
also a Taurean? The evidence from Scripture would certainly confirm such
an idea. If this were so we would need to ask if Adolph Hitler was yet
another case of the past being an echo of the future. And what then is the
nature of time? Who then could speak with any confidence of reality? If a
seer in the past can envision events in the future, must we assume they
have already occurred within the prophet's time? Nostradamus speaks of
the Teacher coming up from Asia, while many traditions speak of his
bringing the Goddess up from the underworld. As has just been said, the
Hesus of Celtic tradition brought the people and the Law up from Asia.
Curiously enough, the Greek name for the Celts was 'Keltoi', and this
means 'strangers'.
The Manichees (Manichaeans) were founded by Mani, who was born in
Iraq in the third century of our era. Their influence spread from Europe to
China, and at one point Manichaeism was set to become a major world
religion. That is until this 'Manichaean heresy' was stamped out. The group
may be very loosely described as a transitional gnostic Christian sect who
held that the Messiah was incarnate as Jesus and Buddha.
Between 1902 and 1914 a number of German expeditions to Turfan in
the far north of the Taklamakan Desert uncovered a considerable number of
texts originating among the Manichees. Perhaps because of their
fragmentary condition and the intervention of World War I, these writings
have remained largely unknown. In a collection of these fragments entitled
Gnosis on the Silk Road,37 a brief text titled 'The True and the False
Maitreya' (page 327) proves to be of astonishing significance.
The discovery of this text was purely serendipitous. My editor had gone
to a book sale, was surprised to find such a tome there and concluded that it
was both obscure enough and cheap enough to purchase as a gift for me.
When such events occur I tend to search extra carefully, but I grew more
and more disappointed as these writings seemed to be lacking in the
elements that I have found in profusion elsewhere. I had almost come to the
end of the book when I encountered what is surely a most significant find.
My editor has, from time to time, quite reasonably been critical of my
scathing attacks upon academia. No doubt many of my readers concur. I
know that my attitude is somewhat lacking in



THREE THINGS 353
good old-fashioned brotherly love and forgiveness, but I must say at the
same time that these complaints do have some basis. Immediately after
finding this text I made some discreet attempts to draw attention, not to
myself, but to the discovery. The response was contemptuous indifference.
This being commonly the case, what else can you and I do but hope these
prissy little parrots can eventually be knocked off their collective perch.
They seem to be uninterested in the development of knowledge for the
common good; that being so, their affront is to none other than God. In
which case I must say that, while I cannot admire their courage, I am con
founded by their blase indifference to the related danger.
John M. Allegro points out in his book The Dead Sea Scrolls: A Re
appraisal that scholars have been puzzled by the fact that the name Teacher
of Righteousness' appears nowhere else but in the Scrolls themselves (page
178). (The exception of a copy of the Damascus Rule found in a Cairo
synagogue cannot be regarded as significant: it is obviously a copy of a
Qumran document that has migrated from that centre, the Karaites
becoming familiar with this term in the ninth century, obviously after the
discovery of the Jericho Scrolls.) But all that has changed with the
publication of 'The True and the False Maitreya', in which there appears a
'Teacher of the Law'. Now whether we translate this concept as Teacher of
Righteousness or of the Law, it means the same thing: the Scrolls Teacher
is very much a Moses whose task it is to teach the real, rather than existing,
Law. Not only is he mentioned in this new text, he appears in precisely the
same role — in contention with the false Messiah — as he does in the
Scrolls. But, significantly, as the prophet Messiah he is both Jesus and
Buddha. That this concept migrated from Qumran to Mongolia via Mani
and his followers is startling, but most important is the fact that this unique
document links the biblical Jesus with the Teacher of the Law. In this
fragmented text the false Messiah, who is referred to as 'the son of a
demon', introduces himself as the coming saviour. The document is clearly
prophetic in that it says his sign 'will be' a bull — which was my original
point. There will be no tricks or forms of magic in the world that he does
not know. By the power of Satan he will be able to do everything. He tells
this to the people and to the 'Teacher of the Law'.
It will be recalled that in II Thessalonians 3 the Antichrist, who is
referred to as the 'man of sin' and 'son of perdition', opposes all that is
called God and sits in the temple claiming he is God; he leads astray many
of the true Israel. In Revelation 13: 6 he



354 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
opens his mouth in blasphemy against God. But, most important of
all, as Lucifer and Solomon he begins with great wisdom and is
much beloved of God. In Revelation 13: 5 he continues for 'forty
and two months', three and a half years.
The Turfan text goes on to say that he becomes one of the elect
and attains the good fortune of the mystical wisdom of the divine
Buddha/Jesus (the Teacher). He then tells the 'false elect' (the false
Israel) that, having waited for him for such a long time, they should
fall down and worship him. The astrological fragment found at
Qumran, 4Q186(1), reads in part:
His spirit consists of six [parts] in the House of Light and three in the Pit of
Darkness. And this is his birthday on which he is to be born: in the foot of the
Bull. He will be meek.
This I take to be the Teacher. Of the Antichrist it is said:
...[and his cheeks are] fat. His teeth are uneven. His fingers are thick and his
thighs thick and very hairy, each one. His toes are thick and short. His spirit
consists of eight [parts] in the House of Darkness and one from the House of
Light...
The wheel, like the spider, spins the yarn of which we make the
garment that is the history with which we clothe the past. This
history then dances seductively before the naked king arrayed in his
magic suit of clothes, and, as she unveils, she shows him to be a
naked and shameful fool. Ah! 'Tis a tale told by an idiot while the
greatest fools look on. In the end there is but one thing that emerges
from these matters entirely unsullied, and that is the glory, the
splendour and the wonder of God. But we began by speaking of an
ancient and obscure Celtic myth that tells of the coming of Hu.
Tradition says that Hesus/Hu Gadarn was the founder of Dru
idism. He came up from Asia to Britain, where he established the
Law. Later, the Gomeridae set his laws in place, and the kingdom
advanced into a Golden Age. The laws were codified by Dunwal
Moelmud; as a memory of the future they live to this day. As with
their counterparts, the Essenes, the Druids held Hesus to be one of a
trinity comprising Beli (the sun), Taran and Hesus. Above these was
Duw-the All, who was so named because He was the pure light of
intellection and was completely without darkness. Duw



THREE THINGS 355
brought three things into being: light, humankind and moral choice. He
lives within man in the form of manredit, the infinite seed. In De Gothicis,
lib iii, Procopius confirms that:
Hesus, Taranis, Belenus unus tantummodo Deus. Unum Deum
Dominum universi Druides Solum agnoscunt.
Druidism held that there are three things that make a man: the worship of
God, just behaviour toward mankind and preparedness to die for a cause or
one's country. It went on to say that there are three types of men that all
should love: he who loves the face of nature, he who loves rational art and
he who looks with love upon the faces of little children.
Throughout this text I have asked the reader to believe that our records of
the past are a record of the future, a claim very easily dismissed as
impossible. The question now posed is whether we have touched upon a
truth or are, indeed, living a myth. That we may debate the nature of reality
philosophically is quite legitimate, but this only indicates our unawareness
of its actuality and its multi-dimensional complexity. Modern Israel is a real
state that has emerged from an ancient book of fables; it is a dynamic first
degree reality whose history begins with the words: Once upon a time. I
make no claim to being a seer, nor do I insist that things will happen
exactly as I say. Even if I am only partially correct, my challenge is a
serious threat to your concept of reality. The only thing now open to
question is my motives. I do not truly understand them any more than you
likely understand yours. We are certainly, all of us, more than we realise.
Such problems arise, no doubt, from our seeing through the T, as a oneness,
a unity, an intrinsic aspect of a tapestry woven by God we find the question
simply does not arise.
The turning point for the Jews was World War II. Since that time they
have held the world to ransom over their treatment in German-occupied
Europe. Take but one life, no matter what its race or creed, and you are
damned by God. Your judges should hang you from a tree. Whether Nazi
Germany was responsible for the death of six million or even three hundred
thousand, no excuse can be made. Close investigation of the real evidence
also raises the question as to whether World War II was fought solely to
liberate Europe or if it was also a war to destroy an economic system that
posed a serious threat to the established monopoly of the



356 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
international bankers — as does, at present, the Moslem world, which
forbids usury.
When the Spanish went to South America they engaged in the genocide
of the indigenous people and killed countless millions. The English did the
same in North America. Scalping was not an Amerindian invention: the
government paid white hunters for the scalps of indigenous men, women
and children. In Australia, Aborigines were discounted on the basis that
their race was dying. It was so because the English had systematically
hunted them, starved them and left them with the white man's diseases and
without help. Africa was the same: the negro was thought of as a monkey
and traded as a commodity. In New Zealand every effort was made to
destroy the Maori, the Maori wars being nothing more than white
aggression. But here the pakeha (white man) met his match. In the end
white conquest came through cultural decimation and the infamous Treaty
of Waitangi (meaning: water of sorrows). This treaty — which even today
the European continually breaks — reads like an agreement with the Mafia.
It guarantees the protection of the crown against the crown in return for
pretty well all the Maori possessed.
The opium wars were an attempt by Britain to subvert and conquer
China by making addicts of the people. Stalin, it is estimated, engaged in
the genocide of some sixteen million intellectuals. The Papacy's crimes
against humanity include the murder of nine million women for practising
witchcraft. And the killing hasn't stopped; today, as always, it is done for
economic expediency. When speaking of the Holocaust we must ask:
Which one?
The state of Israel and individual Jews had, by 1 January 1994, received
DM93.45 billion in reparations from the German Government, with a
further 29.4 billion earmarked. Their plight has wrung some $10 billion per
year in aid from the US. Where is the compensation for the rest of suffering
humanity? How shall we make good the canine savagery which was the
glory of empire? As a people that has experienced victimization, the Jews
are not unique, but they are remarkable in the vociferousness of their
protestations, which have amounted to a very successful means of moral
blackmail. The linchpin, of course, has been the Holocaust. We have all
lived through an age of suffering, and there is still a way to go; the Khazars
have had their share, no more and no less. If they are an exception it is
because they have marketed their pain for financial gain.
Even the smallest deviation of a straight line will cause that line to come
full circle and upon itself. Without strict adherence to the



THREE THINGS 357
law there can only be a progression to total lawlessness and deceit. As I
mentioned earlier, future history tells us that it was during the times we live
in now that Hesus/Hu Gadarn came up from Asia and brought the rule of
law.
He taught that there are three tests of civil liberty: equal rights under the
law, equality of taxation and freedom of movement for all.
Three causes, he said, would bring about the downfall of the state:
unequal privilege, corruption of justice and apathy.
Three things are lost without firm foundation: peace, property and law.
There are three of private rank against whom a weapon must not be
raised — a woman, a child and an unarmed man.
Three things unite a nation: its laws, its common rights and its language.
Three things are a free and common right: the forest, the unworked mine
and the right to hunt in the wild.
Three things require a unanimous vote: the deposition of the sovereign,
the alteration of religious law and the suspension of the law.
Three birthrights accrue to every man: freedom of movement, the
protection of the sovereign and equality of privilege and restriction.
Three material birthrights accrue to every man: five acres of land for his
home, the right to bear arms and suffrage in enactment of the law.
Three things are guaranteed by a society: protection of life and limb,
protection of property and respect for the rights of nature.
Three things are interdependent for their survival: the law, the sovereign
and the courage of the nation.
There are three obligations for every man: worship of God, military
service and obedience to the law.
Three are exempted from bearing arms: the bard, the judge and the
student of law.
Three have power supreme in law: the sovereign, the princes and the
chiefs of the clans.
Three things bind a man in honour: God, the priest's staff and the right
hand.
Three persons have automatic right of support: the aged, the child and the
foreigner who cannot speak for himself.
Three things are free to every man: water from a spring, river or well,
fire from a decayed tree and a stone that is not in use.



358 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Y Gwir Erbyn y Byd
Our measure of a society tends to be in accordance with its material
achievements — these are invariably monuments to the few, paid for by the
many through slavery in one form or another. The real fundamental
greatness of a community lies in its ability to maintain all its individual
members, without exception, free of hunger and fear. Once it has
established itself upon the law and this moral principle, it cannot fail. It will
even, in time, achieve the highest standards in the arts and sciences. The
simplicity and genius of these facts have been pointed out to mankind time
and again, and they must be imposed if they are not taken up; present-day
chaos is the only alternative. The law forbids and punishes only that which
is detrimental. It is not an imposition from a Creator who is external; it is
the only means by which, having had it imposed by a God within us, we
may be free. It is not a pernicious victimizer of the helpless backslider, but
rather a purge by which the many will not suffer at the hands of the few.
The law is written in the light of realities we cannot comprehend; it is wiser
than we. Legislation applied with equal rigour — without respect to
persons or class — leaves men and women free to follow their destinies, to
enjoy the fruits of their labour, to love and enjoy their lives in security of
their individual God-given right to their fair share of the fruits of the earth.
Every human being in the world dreams of freedom, yet everyone
oppresses his neighbour. Everyone hopes to go to heaven but nobody wants
to die. The solution is simple: realize that you are your neighbour's
oppressor and therefore the oppressor of your own self. There is nothing
mystical or religious here. The most intelligent defence of personal freedom
is the defence of your brother's right to be free.
The time has come for men and women to look at simple realities and
liberate themselves, primarily of this oppression which they themselves
inflict upon others. Punishment continues till confession is made. The first
step is therefore to separate from that which makes the spirit filthy.
Spiritual disease is transmitted by the diseased. Obsession with material
things will infect others with the same sickness. And the illusion of material
benefit and advantage is only that: an illusion.
The time for compromise with this spiritual Black Plague is ended. Yoke
yourself to your brother, even though it is many generations since last you
met. Separate yourself from the beast; do not



THREE THINGS 359
touch what he has touched, or all your efforts will be in vain. Do not even
give thought to his weakness; think only of your own struggle — for
struggle it will be — and build upon your growing strength. Do not
underestimate the task and do not surrender the battle, for in you lies the
entire future of humankind. The future is now and the sleeper within you
must awake. If you cannot awaken him, it is because you have poisoned
and killed him with your own disease. You yourself will know at this
moment if you are a beast or a newborn child. If the former, know your
Mother and Father have cursed you for your spiritual deformity, feeble
mindedness and pathetic weakness. Look at what you are doing to your
Mother and your brothers! Shame on you! If a child of Christ you truly are,
may God try you to the limit of your endurance and purify you, may He
judge you in lovingkindness, and hone you as His own Excalibur. May he
make you a prince of His peace to rule in the world, declaring your valiant
deeds among the Heroes and forever counting you one of the company of
the gods, a child of the Grail Family.
Conclusion
When taken in conjunction with other evidences, this material clearly
shows us that the Druids of Western Europe were both highly sophisticated
in their social organization and of one mind with the magi of Palestine. We
have seen that the Druidic version of the Teacher — a precursor of Merlin
— was called Hesus. That this hero shared virtually the same name and the
same tradition with Jesus, and that this has gone without comment by
academia, may be characterized as the remarkable made unbelievable. We
further saw evidence of the interrelation of Celtic myth and Scripture. Not
least was the appearance of the Trinity in the form of Hesus, Taranis and
Belenus.
In looking at the triads, we saw that the pre-Christian Celts had a set of
laws which are incontrovertible evidence of a most sophisticated level of
civilization. The poetic manner in which this code is presented is, in my
opinion, exquisite in its majesty and comprehensive clarity.
A significant point, academically speaking, is the discovery of the
Teacher in the Turfan texts of the Manichees. This document shows us:
1. The Antichrist is — along with the Teacher — a Taurean. This will
confuse the issue, even for those who may try to use the legends to dis
tinguish between the two.
2. The Antichrist is the leader of a false, as opposed to a true, Israel. This
confirms our concept of the two contending Israels of the Last Days.



360 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
3. Because reference to the Teacher as such is of uniquely Qumranite origin, the
discovery of this mention in the Turfan texts is very important.
4. That this text should make reference to Jesus as the Teacher is overwhelming
confirmation of the thesis I have put forward. That he should also be one with
Buddha is further extraordinary and welcome support for an otherwise eccentric set
of theories.
5. Mythically speaking, we have seen the concept of the serpent being applied to
Jehovah/Jesus and, at the same time, Jesus being said to be based upon the Teacher.
This is very typical of the double entendre found in Scripture and myth. That is to
say, as a physical being Jehovah/Jesus is a foreshadowing of the serpent Antichrist;
but as a messenger and nothing more he is the serpentine wisdom fish that swims
across the Piscean sea to emerge upon its final shore. God is spirit. We can only
worship Him in spirit and in truth: all else leads to evil.
A long time ago you and I lost something so precious that the heart is truly
broken at the thought of its loss. But look! By God's infinite grace it is being
returned to us. The days of the bondage of our spirits in Babylon are nearly over.
The most precious of all gifts — freedom — will soon be ours for the taking. If you
doubt this, look for example at the following, which has lived as a memory of the
future in the hearts of our children.
The story of Cinderella is so overt that one could not simply assign it to the
unconscious. Even her name, which she acquired by sleeping by the fire (the sun)
and consequently being covered in cinders, makes her a phoenix rising from the
ashes. Her father becomes a symbol of the impotent Piscean sun, now married to the
evil stepmother with two ugly daughters. These three comprise the negative Triple
Headed Goddess in Pisces. Her own mother, of whom she is a reincarnation, having
died at the dawn of the era, Cinderella is the Goddess of the Aquarian Age. But in
Pisces she had no bed and was a servant girl in her own home.
On one occasion, when her father went on a journey, he offered to bring the ugly
sisters and Cinderella gifts on his return. The elder asked for beautiful dresses and
the younger for pearls and jewels. Cinderella asked for the branch of a tree (the
Messianic King). She planted this over the grave of her mother and wept so much
that it was watered by her tears. Living in the tree was a white bird (the Christ spirit,
or her higher self). It spoke to her and comforted her in her trouble.
Cinderella went to the ball in clothes provided by the white bird, and the prince
(Branch) fell in love with her, but her time had not yet come. When she hastily
made her exit she left behind a glass slipper, and the prince searched the entire
kingdom until he found the only one whom the crystal New Jerusalem would fit.

Les Berger d'Arcadie
To recapitulate, there was no cut-off point. The Scriptures were themselves
the means by which the priest kings went underground. It is impossible to
say by exactly what means their power was reduced; all that is certain is
that the dawn of Pisces was for them the point at which they were about to
become fugitives. The growing power of Rome was the manifestation of
the new age and the sword by which the new gods of Pisces would strike
down the shepherd. Where can a man find greater safety than under his
enemy's own roof?
Until 1209 CE the Languedoc in southern France had existed as a
virtually independent Cathar or Albigensian state. For simplicity's sake we
may say that the inhabitants were philosophically and spiritually one and
the same with the Essenes of Qumran. They were latter-day shamans.
They ignored Rome and its corrupt priests. The entire society set a very
heavy emphasis on education. By 1209 CE the community was well on its
way to becoming one of the great flowers of European civilization. It had
become very wealthy, and it was this wealth which Pope Innocent III used
as a lure for the impoverished lords of the north to demolish this fast
growing competition. The Pope sent 30,000 knights and foot soldiers into
the Languedoc on what is known as the Albigensian Crusade. On pages
42ff. of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, the authors describe how the
entire territory was laid waste in the ensuing campaign. Villages, towns and
cities were razed to the ground and the crops were destroyed; an entire
population was put to the sword. The authors suggest that the vast and
terrible scale of the extermination was such as to likely be the first case of
genocide in modern European history. Some 15,000 men, women and
children were slaughtered in the town of Beziers alone. An army officer
enquiring of the Pope's emissary as to how he should distinguish true
believers from heretics was told to kill them all and that God would
recognize His own.
But this is only one instance of the bestiality with which Rome connived
to establish and cling to its power. Estimates of the number of people who
died because of the purpose of the Roman Church run into millions. Of the
philosophical, political and



362 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
psychological motives for this behaviour I need say nothing. But I can now
explain what the Vatican wanted, and what it urgently needed to take out of
the hands of its perceived competitors.
On page 52 of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail the authors quote
Jean de Joinville as saying that Cathars had invited the Comte de Montefort
to observe the body of Our Lord, which had become flesh and blood in the
hands of their priest. The simple explanation for it is that this shaman had
entered the cosmic tree, gone forward in time and observed the Teacher.
Rome's problem was that this tree is not accessible to everyone. For
example, when Napoleon visited the Great Pyramid in 1798 he was
observed to exit visibly shaken. He announced that it was a terrible place,
and would speak of it no more.
The Cathars, though very wealthy, are said to have held a treasure which
exceeded all material riches. The authors of The Holy Blood and the Holy
Grail say that this treasure was reputed to be kept at Montsegur, which was
their last major stronghold to fall. During the siege two men escaped with
the bulk of the community's material wealth (page 53). Before the castle
fell, the attackers offered generous terms for surrender. The defenders res
ponded by requesting a two-week cessation to hostilities while they
considered the terms. The truce expired on 16 March. The castle fell on the
following day. The Cathars were burnt to death because they would not
simply recant their presumed heresy. The night before the fall, four priests
had made a daring escape with this mystical treasure.
The truce requested by the Cathars was unnecessarily long: the terms
were simple. But the two weeks took them past the time of the spring
equinox, 14 March, this being one of the times when the tree is operable.
In 1885 a new Catholic priest — Abbe Berenger Sauniere — came to the
village of Rennes-le-Chateau in the Languedoc. He is supposed to have
discovered some very old encoded documents under the altar stone of his
church while undertaking renovations. The net result was that he became
the darling of the very influential Parisian occult circles and a very wealthy
man. All this is documented in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail.
If one wishes to be taken seriously, one must be circumspect when giving
evidence. I therefore say that while there is no actual evidence, it is possible
and plausible that his wealth came from the Vatican, which needed to
silence him. The argument against this is



LES BERGER D'ARCADIE 363
that it could have silenced him much more cheaply by arranging his
demise. However, he may have left evidence with his Parisian friends to be
made public in the event of his untimely death, before he approached
Rome. But this is very shady territory.
It is extremely relevant that the Essenes, through the Scrolls, Scripture
and numerous other sources, are seen to put inordinate store in ritual and
spiritual purity. The nature of the cosmic tree is such that any man who
passes through the stones must be spiritually pure to defend himself against
destruction. Thus the Holy of Holies within the temple is useless to the
unclean in spirit, who would be driven to destroy those fit to use it.
The Languedoc was also an area of considerable Templar activity.
Guillaume de Tyre, writing between 1175 and 1184, was the first historian
to record them. They assigned themselves the role of white-clad poor
knights of Christ. In this manner they must have appeared in Palestine as
latter-day Essenes. Their task — self proclaimed — was to keep safe the
roads of the Holy Land for pilgrims. They were anything but poor. Their
official seals show them so beleaguered that two knights are seen riding the
same horse; my interpretation of this is that the (Trojan) horse is the
Scriptures and the two knights are the two Jesuses.
Thanks to Saint Bernard, the Templars were incorporated as a religious
military order at Troyes in January 1128. As pointed out in The Holy Blood
and the Holy Grail (pages 66-67), by 1252 their power was such that they
dared to threaten Henry III of England with the loss of his throne when he
publicly criticized them, a threat that even the Pope would not dare utter.
In previous millennia kings would never have dared question the
dominance of their spiritual ancestors. But times had changed. The
masculine was now free to act upon its disdain of the feminine. It was at
liberty to rape, abuse and destroy her, and it did. The manifestation of the
Cathars, the Poor Knights of Christ and the much earlier Bogomils, and
numerous other similar groups, demonstrates that the feminine nevertheless
intended to fight back even though the odds were severely stacked against
her. It is my opinion that most of the history of the last two thousand years
is written in the blood spilt in the battle between these two opposing forces,
which had earlier worked in harmony.
In The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail the authors extol the virtues of the
Templars' contribution to science and the advancement of knowledge (page
68). They say that, well in advance of their time,



364 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
they regarded epilepsy as a curable disease as opposed to the result of
demonic possession. Such a statement speaks volumes because it takes the
order outside the realm of mystic Christian thugs. It is clear that it would
have been very early decided that, if they were to survive, they needed
initial Roman sanction, and then very considerable financial and military
clout. If they were not to go the way of their predecessors, their beliefs
would have to be kept absolutely secret. And thus was born the modern
secret society: if the feminine was not allowed to live in public then she
must exist in private.
If we look at what has happened to women in our age, we see a very
precise microcosm of the events I describe. This is not to say that the fairer
sex was an entirely innocent party. External behaviour depended, and still
depends, on the predominant spiritual gender, or orientation, of the
individual. A negatively charged or masculine-dominant female is capable
of at least equal evil to that of a male. Training and education in the ancient
mystical sciences were the means of creating this polarity. But the age
being what it was, in the end even these chevaliers overreached themselves
and went the way of their predecessors. Or did they?
At the time of the Albigensian Crusade they were busy defending
Palestine. As an expediency they remained officially neutral. In hindsight
one would imagine that, had they abandoned all else and thrown in their lot
with the Cathars, they might well have formed a state which was
impregnable against their military might, and which would certainly have
completely changed the face and history of Europe. But their all-important
task was the recovery of the Jerusalem temple treasure. In theory, their
access to the cosmic tree should have made them so much less vulnerable.
But it did not. Perhaps destiny had already been set down and there was
little room for deviation from the main path. One can reasonably assume
that the battle which has and is taking place on earth is a mere reflection of
the war that rages in heaven.
Ultimately the Templars provided arms and men for Cathar defence.
Many Cathars joined the order of the Poor Knights of Christ and
immediately took senior positions.
By 1306 Philippe IV of France was bankrupt, and more than a little
concerned at the power of the Temple. In an ambitious and highly secret
plan he arranged that all the lodges should be raided at the same time. The
members were to be arrested and their treasure confiscated. He issued
sealed orders which would be opened and



LES BERGER D'ARCADIE 365
immediately enacted on Friday 13 October 1307. One should wonder if this
particular date was coincidental. When the hammer fell the chevaliers had
been forewarned. Their treasure, believed to be immense, was gone and the
knights quietly accepted their fate. They had even had time to burn their
secret books. The Order, as history tells us, was far from finished, and in its
varied forms lives till this day. Their last Grand Master was Jacques de
Molay. He was roasted slowly to death in March 1324. From the flames
and smoke he issued an invitation to the King and the Pope to join him
before the judgement seat of God within the year. And within the year they
did.
Of all the legends that accrue to the Knights Templar the most potent is
that they were the guardians of the Holy Grail. We have seen here exactly
what this enigmatic treasure really is. Even if many of us refuse to accept
its mysterious worth, we at least now have a real insight into the workings
of the secret societies of our age. We are, for example, in a position to
understand the Essenes by looking at the Templars and Cathars.
Conversely, we may comprehend the religion and philosophy of these later
shamans by looking at the Dead Sea Scrolls.
The accusations levelled at these mystics were manifold and often
obscene. They were also accused of denying that Jesus was God. They
were said to repudiate his death on the cross, and alleged to practice
numerology, sacred geometry and astronomy.
The knights esteemed something or someone called Baphomet. There
can be no question that this was their version of the father of Asmodeus,
which I suspect represented the Star. In The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail
(page 79) the authors conclude that Baphomet might have been a corruption
of the Arabic 'Abufihamet', which, pronounced in Moorish Spanish, is
'Bufihimat'. Its meaning is 'Father of Understanding' or 'Father of Wisdom'.
In the Arabic 'Father' also implies 'source of wisdom'. It is certain that the
real God of Scripture is both male and female. The specifically masculine
creator is based upon the Teacher, the Antichrist and the sun.
Again, in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail the question of Caput
LVIIIM is also raised. It seems the Inquisition discovered a Templar relic: a
silver head of a woman. The object is said to have been of considerable
beauty. It was labelled 'Caput LVIIIM' — Head 58M. 5+8=13. is the
astrological symbol for Virgo, hence the reference is to Coma, the head of
hair. This was the head that the knights said made trees flower. As a
skeletal head set on crossed thigh bones (the genital head), it was that of the
dead Jesus and the



366 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
reborn Teacher. The the skull and crossbones was originally a Templar
device representing Golgotha, the place of the skull, a private garden (of
Eden) with a sepulchre, belonging to the Arimathean (Joseph the sun). But
they were not just another bunch of heretics. They were a link in an eternal
chain which has kept the embers of the dying sun alive. In occupying the
Languedoc, they were the guardians of the old Jerusalem.
In Genisis: the First Book of Revelations,38 David Wood has uncovered
some extraordinary material. His work was published in 1985, and in a
sane world it would have made an enormous impact, particularly in view of
its appearing subsequent to the success of The Holy Blood and the Holy
Grail. I can do nothing more than simply review it and point out the
important details.
As I understand it, Rennes-le-Chateau first came to prominence in 1974
when Henry Lincoln (later one of the authors of The Holy Blood and the
Holy Grail) produced a BBC Chronicle film entitled The Priest, the Painter
and the Devil. In it he drew attention to some pentagonal geometry in the
layout of the churches in the Rennes Valley. It becomes clear from Wood's
findings that this layout did not begin with their building but that — as is
common — they must have been erected on much earlier sacred sites. This
geometric arrangement, which includes naturally-occurring promontories,
goes back to a time well beyond the historical period. Furthermore, as
Wood discovered, it is of amazing complexity and, astonishingly, covers an
area of some forty square miles of very rugged terrain. Even using modern
scientific methods, its construction would present a major challenge of
Great Pyramid proportions.
The significance of his information is that it provides substantial
evidence supporting the idea that the Rennes Valley was the location of the
'Old' Jerusalem from which the Merovingian kings may have governed a
global federation in a bygone age.
The mystery of this district cannot be uncovered without reference to
Nicolas Poussin's enigmatic painting 'Les Berger d'Arcadie' (The Shepherds
of Arcadia), in which our three brothers, John, the Teacher and King Jesus,
in the company of the Goddess in the form of a shepherdess, examine a
tomb inscription, this being an ungrammatical 'et in arcadia ego' (I, too, live
in Arcadia). The clues are many, as Wood discovers, but they ultimately
lead to the Ark of the Covenant and the actual means of passing through the
stones of fire. This is the Great Secret of history, the thing of power hidden
for Israel — the children of Aquarius — to find.



LES BERGER D'ARCADIE 367
Primary in this matter is Wood's discovery of the pentagram's
relationship to the number 1080, which identifies it as feminine.
Allegorically the inverted pentagram is symbolic of Satan whom I have
said is the Wicked Priest — the Antichrist. The stone in his crown is
Jerusalem but, when the pentagram is set the right way up, it becomes the
genital stone of the Goddess.
Wood has also found that Poussin laid out his 'Les Berger d'Arcadie' in a
fantastically complex set of geometric patterns, not least of which is the
mathematical linkage of the genitalia and forehead of the shepherdess, who
is with child (Israel). This clearly demonstrates the unification of the right
and left hemispheres of the brain through Coma, the genital stone.
In identifying the serpent of Peyrolles, he has noticed the comparison
with the Serpent of Adams County in Ohio, USA. It is shown to be
swallowing an egg, which is the thirteenth stone, but, even more
significantly, the erect serpent is male and symbolizes the number one,
whereas the serpent chewing its own tale is feminine and forms the circle or
zero. Together they create the decad '10', which represents, in number, one
of the fundamental building blocks of the universe, the joystick and firebox
of creation. This symbolism is found in the name of Isis and her Greek
equivalent Io. Thus '10', which begins as '01', is symbolically the power of
multiplication and growth; its permutations are infinite. The '0', is feminine
and thus an unseen or unknown quantity; it lives in the realm of spirits. It is
the recognition of this fact and the 'uncontem-plation' of 01=10 that
provides us with true understanding.
In chapter 4 (The Legends), Wood begins an explanation of the role of
Isis in the geometry of Rennes. In my opinion, it is too easy to place an
over-emphasis on one symbol: there is too much interaction. For example,
where — for simplicity's sake — I describe Thoth-Hermes and Sampson as
the Star/Teacher, it is equally true that they are also representative of the
sun, which is itself a star and a creator. But if we look to the fundamental
elements of the Isis story, we find that Horus, who saw everything, also
revealed everything. It was he who finally unveiled Isis his mother to the
Aquarian sun after she had begotten him of the dead one in Pisces.
To tell the story of Isis, one must first speak of her husband, Osiris,
whom I identify as the sun in the tree, specifically the star that died at the
dawn of Pisces when the dark set in. Scholarship generally accepts that
Osiris, as a mythological character, began his life as a tree deity, bringer of
fertilizing water (words of God) and



368 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
corn god. This, of course, is totally in keeping with my theory. Much later
we find him identified with Ra (the sun), and as a dead star he is
paradoxically a lord of fertility and a denizen of the underworld: the god of
the dead in the Piscean age when the tree was without his life-giving
essence. Osiris was murdered by his brother Set (the Wicked Priest), who
coveted his harvest (his wisdom) and his flock (Israel). As the dead Jesus,
this beast replaced him as lord of that divine treasure.
The Egyptian calendar was supposedly based on a 360-day year and was
calculated on the rising of the star Sirius, which was known as the serpent's
tooth. Teeth are stones, and Osiris is the stone/star fundamental to this
calculation. Likewise, in Celtic tradition Llew Llaw Giffes derives his
name from 'stone thrower' and, curiously, in modern parlance his name can
be read as 'law giver'. Like the Teacher, Llew was the illegitimate son of
Arianrhod the Spider Goddess. The idea of a 360-day calendar is a
contradiction when one considers the sophistication of Egyptian astronomy:
one must wonder if it has some sacred significance in relation to passing
through the tree or whether it foreshadows a physical change in the earth's
motion that will take place as we enter Aquarius. If so, this alternation
would be catastrophic for existing life on earth.
Isis was born mortal and, like Mary, was a perpetual virgin; she was
never unveiled. Nut was the mother of the gods Set, Isis, Osiris and
Nephthys; on page 32 Wood points out that their initials coincidentally
spell S.I.O.N., as in Prieure de Sion, the organization that formed and later
disbanded the Templars. He notes that the cutting and scattering of the
body of Osiris has special significance. That it was his phallus that was lost
can also be taken to indicate the loss of the sun's procreative power. The
name Isis means 'seat of stone' and, as the Goddess of the stone, her seat or
place of procreation is that which heroes like David and Llew Llaw must
cast in the heavens in their role of revealing mysteries.
Wood's hunt for a starting point for the layout of the geometry of Rennes
concluded when he made the association between Isis as the Stone-Seat and
the remains of what might have been a pre-Christian temple near Rennes
le-Bains, which is known as Fauteuil du Diable, the Armchair of the Devil.
His next step was to obtain a copy of Le Serpent Rouge (The Red
Serpent), which refers to a thirteen-sign zodiac with Ophiuchus as the
thirteenth sign. He points out that this constellation is a very large one and
sits between Scorpio — the supposed thirteenth sign



LES BERGER D'ARCADIE 369
— and Sagittarius. Ophiuchus was the god of healing. The serpent he holds
runs across the sky and points directly between Gemini and Taurus, which
is the location of Coma on the tree, the area of the heavens presently
occupied by Auriga the Charioteer, which itself represents the Shekinah.
Hence, his task is to heal the zodiac: to raise up the serpent of knowledge.
In this manner, a literalist investigator would take Ophiuchus to be the
thirteenth sign and not realize his role as a signpost. Our Minotaur
(Gemini-o-Taurus) as earlier mentioned then becomes half bull and half
human (half man and half beast), which would describe our Teacher
perfectly in his role as the first but imperfect man; hence Sagittarius which
is half man and half beast. It will be recalled that Jesus says why marvel at
me when you will do so much more. In Genesis, the serpent says that men
may become like gods by eating from the tree of knowledge. This is echoed
in so much of myth in general, which speaks of the creation of
comparatively god-like mankind.
Likewise, with the countless universal flood epics, we may see that it is
the primeval beasts of Pisces that are destroyed. Water is the words of God,
and the Teacher as Noah brings a flood of wisdom from Him, this coincides
with an imminent actual flood which results from the abuse of the earth by
those who could not distinguish good from evil. But this too is to coincide
with our entry into Aquarius the water bearer who, himself, is a bringer of
the words of God and is the father of a Golden Age. The Flood is often said
to be held back by a stone which acts as a bung and which, as earlier
mentioned, is the seat of Christ and Satan. Hence the armchair, or seat of
Satan, is this stone. In The Sirius Mystery39 (page 171) Robert K. G.
Temple points out that if an Egyptian were to write 'The Goddess
Sirius/Isis' in hieroglyphics, it would result in:
This, he says, can also be read as the rising of the serpent's tooth. The rising
of teeth is the rising of stars, which are stones. Accordingly, Isis is the seat
of stone that the builders rejected. In her role as the seat of Christ and of
Satan, she is both the white and the black madonna. In one sense, this stone
was effectively rejected when on 17 January 681 CE Sigisbert IV went to
Rennes-le-Chateau. He was the son of Dagobert II and heir to the
Merovingian crown, but instead sired a line of kings who never reigned.
Wood has noticed that the Noacian Flood began on the 17th of the
second month and ended on the 17th of the seventh month,



370 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
lasting a hundred and fifty days. He says that there is obviously a
connection here between the year of 360 days and the circle of 360°,
creating a relationship between time and angular measure, this connection
being used to form a bridge between spatial and temporal numbers. Wood
refers to G. Higgins as saying in Anacalypsis that Noah is derived from
'noe', meaning 'intellect'; the Ark preserves the new and higher intellect.
Wood then draws attention to Poussin's Deluge, which depicts the serpent
of wisdom and a boat which is specifically indicative of the constellation
Argo and is symbolic of the seat, or womb, of Isis: it is the Egyptian organ
of generation.
On page 49 he refers back to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail and
points out that (mythically speaking) the Merovigian kings are descended
from the tribe of Benjamin, which sits well with the idea that, once Coma
the womb is established, her heir to the throne sits at her right
Benjamin/Gemini — and her High Priests, of which the Teacher is the first,
sit to her left — Taurus.
That the biblical Great Flood is not an historical event but a pagan myth
with underlying symbolism is easily demonstrated with a little
commonsense.
According to traditional chronology, the Flood occurred in the year 2348
BCE. The Sumerian king-lists go back to 3350 BCE, and, during the period to
which the Flood is attributed, Sumer experienced a period of unsurpassed
and uninterrupted prosperity under the governorship of Sargon the Great
through to that of his grandson Naram-Sin. Likewise, through the third to
the seventh dynasty, from 2800 to 2175 BCE, Egypt's flowering was not
interrupted by water. In China too, between 2400 and 2200 BCE, the
country flourished under the Yao dynasty without an inundation requiring it
to start all over again. Minoan civilization peaked at around 2500 BCE and
continued at a high level, untroubled by flooding, until about 1470 BCE,
when it was destroyed by volcanic eruption. Through the period of the
Great Flood the citizens of the Indus Valley built Harappa and Mohenjo
Daro, while the Phoenicians also managed to keep their heads well above
water.
Ninety per cent of all life on earth disappeared during the Jurassic period,
about 60 to 100 million years ago. Since then, about 9 per cent more has
been lost. But this still leaves Noah with a pair of each of 150 million
remaining species to accommodate on the ark he set out to build. And this
does not take account of the fowls of the air, which, in Genesis 7: 2-3, are
to be brought in by sevens.



LES BERGER D'ARCADIE 371
Given the requirements for living space for these creatures, and not
accounting for the food they would consume and countless species of flora
that would not survive such an inundation, it has been estimated that an ark
containing 51.6 million cubic feet of space would have been needed,
whereas Noah's Ark had 1.2 million (which, coincidentally, is the twelve
100,000s redeemed of the twelve tribes in Revelation). And what of the
number of people required to feed all these creatures and remove the
countless tons of dung?
The Great Flood is what occurs when poetry is taken literally. When
God rains down his wisdom upon mankind, they discover the boat (ark)
which is the cosmic tree. When, at the same time, man melts the polar ice
and brings on a major flood by his disrespect for his environment, and
when all this happens as we enter Aquarius the water bearer, the Ark
becomes the means by which the New Israel (Homo novus) survives.
What we now begin to see is that what has been for most an innocent
collection of legends was an immense military secret for a few. There
seems little point in discussing the value of the Grail in the past. I come
back to my original question. Something which has impacted, and must
continue to impact, upon human affairs as has the Sangreal of noblesse
uterine cannot have been simply lost and forgotten. If what has been
uncovered so far is an example of the power of the Holy Chalice, then it
holds in its hands the destiny of mankind. The short-term implications are
its ability to destroy the power of Rome and modern Israel, even though
their religionists have a proven history of extreme cleverness and deter
mination when threatened.
And it does not stop there: the Grail has the power to undermine other
powerful religious and subsequently political structures. Quite simply, it
holds the power for radical change. In my opinion it could only be change
for the good. One can never be certain — there is never any real evidence
— but is it plausible that the Vatican knows nothing of these matters?
When in 1947 a young Bedouin shepherd cast a stone into a cave at
Khirbet Qumran, he began a chain of events which we as yet cannot
imagine. Judging by the machinery that was quite quickly put into place,
the implications could not have been totally lost on Rome. But, as I say,
there is never any evidence, and one is still left pondering the
machiavellianism of the crafty old monks at the Ecole Biblique.



372 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
If we only take into account the work of John M. Allegro, who was a
member of the official Scrolls Committee, we must assume that Roman and
Israeli authorities know an awful lot. The Vatican has lived with the so
called 'gnostic heresy' since its birth, and it must have a vast store of
information at its disposal. The Scrolls cannot represent a new problem for
the Catholic Church; they are an old one that has simply resurfaced.
The sole object behind the Scrolls conspiracy is not religious but
political. The object is to limit and control what you and I think. As I
mentioned at the beginning of this book, it is all a matter of power and
control. In recent times the game has become global. Even electronic media
like television have become a very sophisticated sort of pacifying drug in
the community's drinking water. In so-called primitive societies, a home is
a birthright. In our culture, the box in the suburbs has become the ball and
chain we fix to our own ankles. Now that our present level of technology
has been achieved, governments are abandoning general education, limiting
the power and rights of the individual. In such circumstances, even war
becomes a manipulative economic tool. In theory, we are free. But what are
we free to do? To me it seems that the answer is: extremely little.
The potency of a female's eggs or a male's seed does not lie in any
physical attributes. It is inherent in our determination to be free. There is no
freedom without independent thought. There is no independent thought
without the desire for self-determination. That alone is life's purpose and
struggle. That struggle is the only tree that bears nourishing fruit.
Conclusion
The Languedoc was the ancient seat of the old priest kings, who, I argue, were the
Merovingians. That flower of ancient wisdom was guarded by such groups as the
Templars and was eventually crushed by Rome, the herald of the iron age. As
evidence of this I have drawn attention to the finds made by David Wood. These
amount to an elucidation of the massively complex layout of Languedoc, which not
only conveys an ancient knowledge of geometry and astronomy comparable with
that embedded in the Great Pyramid, but also shows us that the pagans who built
this massive complex had used it as a means of conveying the secret of the Ark of
the Covenant, the means by which they were able — like Nostradamus, a Grand
Master of the Prieure de Sion — to see the future and to shape it.



23
The Once and Future King
We are asked to believe that Jesus, who preached a gospel of turning the
other cheek, was the leader and inspiration of a group of people who
numbered among them the Zealots. In this respect Jesus is diametrically
opposed to the early Zealot Christian Essenes. It is only when we take him
out of that time period, and set him in the role of avenger of the righteous
saints who died to defend the faith, that his story makes any sense. At the
end of time, this messenger of God would justify them. He alone would
succeed in doing to Rome and all Sons of Darkness what they had been
unable to do. They prepared the ground for him. The Bible was the time
bomb he would explode in the face of the Great Satan.
What can be said with some certainty is that a present-day Jesus, as the
Teacher, would, by professing a 'Turn the other cheek' philosophy, imply
that the time of retribution is 'at hand'. And that, the victory now being
within reach, there is no longer any need for concern with trivia, the
outcome of the war being guaranteed. That he is permitted to reveal the
mysteries is itself a sign of the rising of Israel and a declaration of war.
Mankind has had the tree at the very least since the time of early Sumer.
There surely can be no greater tool than one which allows you to see and
prepare for the future. At this time, all humanity was ruled by priests, and
all had access to it. No doubt it allowed them to communicate with each
other. Hence the commonality of legends such as the flood.
If all Scripture is a body of apocalyptic writings, then it follows that all
the disparate pieces have been made to fit together. For example, while the
Bible is quite subtle in separating Noah and Jesus, it is clear from other
related myths that they are one, as seems to be the case in deluge epics such
as that of China, for example. The hero in this case is Yu. He dreamed one
day that he had swallowed the River Ho (the Yellow River) — the word of
God. On one occasion he saw a white half-man half-fish (Oannes) creature
rise up from the river. He gave Yu a plan for the future direction and
maintenance of the Ho; he gave him the law.
The Essene writings on this subject are not so subtle. In the book of
Enoch we see that the flood is a part of the last judgement. In the



374 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
book of Noah (contained in Enoch) at IX: 1-3 the angels Michael, Uriel
and Gabriel look down and see much blood being shed and lawlessness
abroad. They decide to bring this to the attention of the Most High. They
tell Him that Azazel has revealed secrets which men have been striving to
obtain. In X: 1-3 Uriel is sent to the son of Lamech, who must go to Noah
and tell him to hide himself, as God is going to send mass destruction,
including a flood.
The main theme of the text is that the Watchers have revealed secret
sciences which are damaging the earth and destroying mankind. These are
the Dark Old Ones of which John Dee speaks and which are now manifest
in the world. The deluge is not the sole means of judgement; it is a part of
the Last Days destruction. The object is to put an end to the giant children
born of women, fathered by the Watchers. These giants are later termed
evil spirits. They know the secrets of the sciences which till this day have
been hidden from men for fear of their power to destroy creation.
In chapter XV: 1 we are told that Enoch is the Scribe of Righteousness.
In XV and XVI there is mention of the former and the latter fiery thrones.
In XXV: 3-5 the fiery wheels become a fragrant tree which is once again to
be given to men after the judgement. Here it is described as a holy
mountain. The mountain, the stone (refer Daniel 2: 35) and the tree are one
— the New Jerusalem. This (thirteenth) stone that Daniel says smote the
image of the (Jesus) beast and became a great mountain may well find its
origins in Babylonia, where the earth was depicted as such. There, the
Goddess of the world mountain was Nin-Harsag. Most certainly, if the
book of Daniel was even remotely historical, its author would have been
familiar with this tradition. He would also have known of the nig-gil-ma
legends, which probably gave rise to our Holy Grail mythology.
In chapter XXVII we learn of the Accursed Valley, where judgement is
to be made. This obviously is one and the same as the territory of
Jehoshaphat, the rising of the sun in the tree. In XLVI we see the character
of Jesus and the Teacher, revealer of all the mysteries of Scripture.
Here we have the Son of Man/Teacher in company with the Head of
Days, who has hair as white as wool. The Son of Man has righteousness
and pre-eminence with God, who has chosen him to reveal the hidden
things. He is to raise the kings and the mighty from their seats and break the
teeth of the sinners. It will be recalled that teeth are stones; thus, breaking
the teeth of the sinners



THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING 375
might be interpreted as destroying the ten-orbed tree of Piscean Jesus idol
worship.
The chapter concludes by echoing the Scrolls in berating those who put
faith in their riches and the work of their hands.
In XLVIII the powers and deific role given to Jesus are seen here to be
given to the revealer of mysteries. Here we learn of a fountain of
righteousness surrounded by fountains of wisdom. It is at their appearance
that the Son of Man is named. This is before the sun and the signs are
created; before he sets the sun in the tree. He, like Jesus, is to be a light to
the Gentiles; he has preserved the lot of the righteous.
This is reaffirmed in XLIX, where it is said that wisdom flows like water
because this man is mighty in the secrets of righteousness. In this same
chapter the Teacher is referred to as 'the light of the Gentiles'. In Matthew
12:18 Jesus will:
.. .shew judgement to the Gentiles.
That is to say he reveals God's plan and all that is to befall the final
generation.
In Matthew 12: 21 we read:
And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
When he comes there are none in the world but Gentiles. He creates
spiritual Israel from among them; they are born 'out of Egypt'.
In Luke 2: 32 — it will be recalled that the gospel of Luke specifically
deals with the Teacher — we find:
A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.
He sets the sun in the tree. See also Isaiah 42: 6.
We may now see the meaning behind an important traditional Christian
theme. John 1: 29 reads:
The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold
the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.
As I have said, 'lamb' and 'word' are interchangeable. This is confirmed
by Allegro. It is with his 'word' of revelation that the Teacher destroys
idolatry and false religion, a point made by



376 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Nostradamus. Through his revelation he gives all mankind an opportunity
to abandon sin, to know what is real and true.
In Genesis 11: 3 the people 'had brick for stone, and slime had they for
mortar'. With this they build the tower of Babel. A modern office tower
with its high tech communications systems may be termed 'a tower of
Babel'. Within this tower sit cyclopean giants with their one-eyed tin cans
(computers). Cold and calculating, they deny the existence of spiritual
reality. They seek 'by the work of their hands' to own and enslave the
world; all must become dead like their machines. They buy and sell, raping
and pillaging the earth for their gain. They are seen, in this manner, to be
practising sorcery.
This, I suggest, is a possible origin for the term 'Babylon'. The priests
who walked through the stones of fire would have seen this as part of the
Teacher's time, a world of sin he must destroy. Like Moses, he leads the
gentle of spirit out of their pharaonic slavery in this place of execrable
magic, before God destroys all 'the seekers after smooth things'. Thus, he is
the Shepherd, the Lamb/Word who takes away the sin of the world. God
sends Moses the Teacher to these pharaohs to say 'Let my people go'.
Those that hear his word of revelation are spiritual Israel, those who deny it
are drowned in the Aquarian flood of the Red Sea, which Homo novus
crosses and survives.
In CVI: 1-6 of the Book of Enoch we have a description of the birth of
Noah, and of the man himself.
Methuselah takes a wife for his son Lamech, and she becomes pregnant
and bears a son. This baby has a body as white as snow, and his hair is as
white as wool. He also has fiery eyes which light up the house. This
obviously refers to the Teacher setting the sun in the tree. The child then
rises in the hands of the midwife, opens his mouth and begins to converse
with the Lord of Righteousness. His father runs away in terror and tells
Methuselah that he has begotten a son unlike men, but resembling the sons
of the God of heaven. His nature is different and his eyes are like the rays
of the sun. Lamech says he fears that the boy is not sprung from him but
from the angels, and that in his day a great wonder will be wrought on
earth. This story echoes that of Mary conceiving Jesus.
Here we have a description of an albino. In the book of Revelation, at
chapter 1, verse 14, we find a similar picture of the physical Jesus:



THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING 377
His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes
were as a flame of fire.
His being a lamb — sheep are usually white — may also be seen as an
albino reference.
Britain was originally called Albion, and later the people were called the
British. Brith-ish, as I have said, is in Hebrew 'covenant man'. Nostradamus
refers to Britain as 'the kingdom of the balance'; this upon the tree is
Levi/Libra the priests. Interestingly the Celtic hero Llew Llaw, who is a
version of the Teacher, gave his name to London, which would have
originally been Llewdunn. A dunn was a fortified encampment. Its
transition to 'London' probably began with 'Llewdunnium', and moved on
to Londinium.
There is an oracle, the source of which I have long since lost. I can only
confirm that the book in which it was found was published well before
1947, when the Scrolls were discovered. The prophecy was made by a seer
who was due to be consigned to Vulcan by righteous, witch-hunting
Christians. If my memory serves me well, it reads as follows:
O England, thou shalt wax wicked in thine old age, and the Lord of
righteousness shall chastise thee. But He shall look down upon thee in mercy
and bring from thee a bright star to enlighten the nations.
As far as the Teacher is concerned, I can only say I suspect he is from
the land of Albion, the Covenant man. But as for the Sceptre, I can be much
more definite.
There are among the prophecies of Nostradamus some which seem most
unlikely ever to come to pass — for example, the idea that France may one
day have a king. But then, the notion that the Romanov throne might again
be installed in Russia would have seemed utterly impossible ten years ago:
it may not happen, but it is now at least a possibility.
In Century 4: 77 Nostradamus says:
Selin made king, Italy shall be peaceful,
Kingdoms will be united under the Christian king of the world. When he dies,
he will want to be buried in Celtic territory, Having driven the pirates from the
sea.
The pirates are the Church (Italy is peaceful) who captured Jesus the Fisher King
in the midst of the Piscean sea.



378 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
And in 5: 41 he says:
Born in the shadow of night,
He shall be a sovereign ruling in goodness.
He shall cause his blood to revive the ancient cup,
Bringing forth the golden age from the time of brass.
Brass is the metal associated with Aquarius; the cup is the Grail.
Nostradamus's reference to Britain as the kingdom of the balance (Libra
the Levite priesthood) in Century 4: 96 tends to support the idea of the
Teacher/Star, like the Sceptre, emerging from the Celtic peoples. But this
does not make the Celts Jews or Israel. Both the Teacher and the Messianic
King must emerge from one race or another. After all, they are real people
in a real world. Race is otherwise not an issue. At least, not to this new
spiritual mankind called Israel.
In the process of their investigation, the authors of The Holy Blood and
the Holy Grail stumbled across an organization called the 'Prieure de Sion'
(pages 111ff. and 116ff.). This society had been publishing material since
1956, which only someone who knew at least everything spoken of in this
book could understand. This fraternity, I believe, went public after it had
done its own decipherment of the Scrolls. It has been in existence since
long before the Knights Templar, and was responsible for their formation.
It has for centuries been the power behind many thrones, and still exists
today. The society's primary objective is the restoration of the Merovingian
dynasty.
Most significantly and correctly, its literature distinguishes between
Mary the mother of Jesus the Sceptre and Mary Magdalene the mother of
Jesus the Star, who, legend has it, was one of those who brought the Grail
to Glastonbury. In the process of publishing these convoluted texts, it is
possible that four men were murdered by opponents. The authors of The
Holy Blood and the Holy Grail point out that, though it would have been
pointless, the documents could have been attributed to the dead men after
their demise. It is certainly very difficult to make the leap from obscure
religion to modern political terrorism. The object of these publications
appears to have been to make the existence of the order known to the
Teacher.
It seems the names of some of the authors of this material are cryptic. For
example, as pointed out in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (page 97),
the name 'Beaucen' is a variation of 'Beauseant',



THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING 379
the battle-cry and battle-standard of the Templars. Another text is
accredited to Walter Celse-Nazaire, the Celtic Nazarite. One work largely
comprises thirteen short prose poems which refer to a thir-teen-sign zodiac.
In this instance Ophiuchus the serpent holder is the thirteenth sign, and the
title of the document is 'The Red Serpent' (pages 100-101). In Hebrew
Edom = red; hence Edomite/Jewish serpent/Antichrist. The gist of the text
is that there is a sacred lady to be liberated. It is said that formerly she was
known as Isis and that she is also spoken of as the Magdalene. To the
initiated, she is Our Lady of the Cross. As earlier mentioned, a distinction
is made between the mothers of the Sceptre and of the Teacher. As has
been said, it is possible that the mother of the actual Teacher is a prostitute.
After all, his father knew him not and she abandoned him.
This seems to be confirmed in John 8: 41 where the Pharisees say to
Jesus 'We be not born of fornication'. In Talmud Sanhedrin 67a Jesus is
referred to as the illegitimate son of Joseph Pandera. A pan-darus was a
pimp. Accordingly Kalian lb(18b) says Jesus was the bastard of a
prostitute. Luke 3: 23 says that he was 'supposed' the son of Joseph. The
New Testament word for 'bastard' is 'nothos'. The implications are that,
according to Scripture, the son of God was not only descended from
adulterers and a Moabitess, he was also illegitimate, and as such forbidden
to enter Israel. This would then explain why Moses, as another version of
the Teacher, was not allowed by God to enter the promised land. Likewise,
he and Jesus show the same reluctance to take up their assignments.
The material gathered in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail is of
considerable importance to us. When first published, it caused something of
a sensation in that it linked the House of Lorraine to Jesus and Mary
Magdalene. The authors were, by the evidence uncovered, forced to
presume that he escaped the crucifixion and subsequently fathered much of
Europe's aristocracy. In hindsight we may see that their real mistake lay in
presuming him to be historical. What in reality they found was a line which,
beginning in Scripture, ran on the Grail trail directly to a group in France
who eagerly await the reinstatement of the monarchy of the Merovingian
kings. They have reasonably presumed history to be linear, and it is not.
This line runs directly through the Crusades and the Templars, who played
a very important role in setting the foundation stone for that history. In one
sense, it all begins with the Knights of Christ and goes both backwards and
forwards in time.
The traditional Jesus has been viewed as a specifically religious



380 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
figure. This has overshadowed his political role. He comes primarily to
establish God's kingdom 'on earth'. If we are ever to have any grasp of
Scripture at all, we must totally abandon any idea that it is a collection of
religious documents: we need to know that religion has been superimposed
upon it. In Luke 17: 21 we are told that 'the kingdom of God is within you'.
In Mark 8: 24 men are seen 'as trees, walking'; thus the kingdom is the
micro/macrocosmic tree. In the highly mystical Gospel of John, at chapter
18, verse 33, Jesus is asked if he is the King of the Jews. He distinguishes
himself as the Star/ King-maker — as opposed to Matthew's Sceptre, who
will rule the world — by responding in John 18: 36 with the words 'My
kingdom is not of this world'. It is not he (the Star) but the Sceptre who will
inherit. If God's kingdom is really and absolutely going to be established
here on earth, then it must have political foundations.
But everything happens on two levels. There is also the spiritual element,
which is the driving force — the power behind the throne. As we all know,
while we may or may not accept the reality of external influences, events
on earth grind away in a strictly material manner. As I have said, there was
nothing historical set into Scripture. It was all a reflection of events that
would unfold in a future distant from the time the Bible was written. Both
in the manner in which it was done, and in the way that history would
unravel, there would be spiritual and material events which would be
reflections of each other. Prophecy is spiritually driven but the events that it
dictates require massive organization of a strictly earthly kind, 'that the
prophecy may be fulfilled'. Thus, in one sense prognostication is the main
road of history, along which men are forced to march. But how can that be?
In the Prieure de Sion, the authors of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail
stumbled across one of history's many road-building gangs. In this
arrangement we find one major company which has won the contract to
build the road, and then numerous sub-contractors to physically bed the
stones. The start of this path goes back into dim and dark antiquity. From
the priests of Palestine to their spiritual heirs in Rome, and onto the
powerful secret societies like the Prieure de Sion, the object has been to
smooth the way for mankind. The events that the Scriptures set in Palestine
were a detour which many thought to be their destination. Ancient Israel
was created as a negative image of the true Israel of the future. The idol
Jesus, as a false messiah, was likewise a negative historical image of the
Antichrist, whom that artificial nation would one day



THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING 381
produce. The true route seems to lead specifically to Britain as Judah and
France (the Languedoc) as Israel.
When the Crusaders first captured and then lost Palestine, it might have
been just another event in history. There is every indication that it was not,
but rather the establishment of the physical, earthly thirteenth stone. From
this point, history moves both backwards and forwards. In 1099,
immediately after the capture of Jerusalem, a group of monks in secret
conclave chose Godfroi de Bouillon to be king. If the research in The Holy
Blood and the Holy Grail is accurate, and there is no reason to doubt it, this
came as no surprise to Godfroi. The authors say that uncharacteristically he
modestly declined the title, only accepting the honour of Defender of the
Holy Sepulchre. The first actual King of Jerusalem was Godfroi's younger
brother, Baudouin I. In the sense that the march of history implies it, at this
point there was established in Jerusalem the Davidic royal line. Later the
kingdom was lost.
Some events of moment either occurred or were said to occur in 1188. At
this juncture the Templars and the Prieure de Sion parted company. The
Prieure assumed the name of 'Ormus', which has on its own a substantial
Masonic history. The device for this name
was 40 The Grail romances, as is well known, were founded on
the mysticism and romance of the Templars. King Arthur was
affectionately known as 'Bear'. We have seen that the above is the
astrological symbol for Virgo, the Virgin is the mother of the
Branch/Sceptre, and this sign is the source of the thirteenth stone.
Symbols are just another way of conveying messages. They speak
directly to the unconscious, as is exemplified by the cross of
Lorraine, which subliminally points to two Jesuses.
'Ours' is French for 'bear'; this corresponds to the Latin 'ursus' and refers
to that astrological configuration. 'Or' is gold and 'ur' is light. 'Orme' is
French for elm. 'Rus' means red; hence the 'Red Serpent' Messiah. 'Or' is a
suffix occurring in Latin loan words taken specifically from Anglo-French
and denoting possession. This by no means exhausts the derivations of this
symbol. But the important reference is the elm tree.
In The White Goddess Graves reassembles the Mabinogion 'Battle of the
Trees' (page 37). Of the elms we learn that they are the henchmen of the
vine, which is a biblical term for the cosmic tree. This battle of the trees is
— as Graves discovered — a type of coded



382 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
alphabet in which the trees are associated with the months of the year and
thus with the zodiac.
Basically, in the patriarchs — Graves terms them 'the five deathless
ones' — we have the vowels of the Hebrew alphabet: Abraham, Isaac,
Jacob, Enoch and Elijah (see also pages 86-87). This is part of the
codification system that Scripture uses. The elm is the 'alim'. The 'alim' is
also 'A', and is the fir which is female (page 190). The fir is a birth tree.
Alim in old Irish was the palm, not native to Ireland; it grows by the sea in
sandy and salty soil. Associations I made with the sea, the source of
wisdom, will be recalled. The palm is also the birth tree of Egypt,
Babylonia and Phoenicia, and it is the tree of life in the Babylonian
creation. In Hebrew it is 'tamar', who is Ishtar, Isis, Coma. In Genesis 38
she plays the harlot with her father-in-law, Judah (the lion is a symbol of
the sun). She subsequently gives birth to Pharez and Zarah, and thus may
be designated the Goddess who is mother to both lines of the tribe. She also
appears in II Samuel 13, where she is the daughter of David, but never
mentioned as such. She is raped by her brother Amon, who is another
Solomon the Wicked Priest, who builds the temple; that is, he takes the tree
by force. In Ezekiel 47: 19 Tamar, interestingly, is a city by the Salt Sea,
perhaps En-gedi.
The palm gives its name to the Phoenix, which means 'bloody' as in
birth. In modern Irish 'alim' means elm. In Latin elm is 'ulmus'. It was the
tree that supported the young vine, hence alma mater. In Scripture the vine
is the cosmic tree.
We may now look at a story which is clearly not the history it is claimed
to be. In 1188 Henry II of England is supposed to have met with Philippe II
of France in a sacred field at Gisors. In that field there stood an ancient and
sacred elm. It was a very hot day. The English arrived 'first' and took
shelter beneath it. Later the French appeared, and eventually a battle ensued
over who would have its shelter now that the sun was high. The French,
being more numerous, won the day. In anger at the impudent English,
Philippe felled the tree. This is the nature and language of legend.
The voice of the Old Ones speaks to us constantly in dreams. It tells us
we are the dream within the dream of creation which is, itself, a dreaming.
Many such as Susan Cooper have had visions of night and set down their
dreaming in moving prose, as she did in The Dark is Rising sequence.
When Bran, the albino reincarnation of Arthur, says his goodbyes, even
John the Baptist is found a fitting place in the story.



THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING 383
Susan Cooper's writings serve as wonderful illustrations, for, though
children's books, the stories display a deep intimacy with the things of the
spirit realm and a knowledge which is part of the history of the occult. But
here we immediately face a problem in using the term 'occult'. More than
most others, it has a profound layering of semantic overtones. The word
itself simply means 'hidden from the eye'. If it is to be applied accurately
and without bias, then quite clearly the Bible must be spoken of as a book
profoundly of the occult.
Nostradamus tells us of the great secret being discovered by a man with a
whole or complete brain, that is to say, someone operating with both his
masculine and his feminine. The simple fact of the matter is that we all
largely operate purely with our left brain and deal only with the stimuli that
are encountered by the usual five senses. It is this that makes us the
mechanical and mindless beings that we are. But we are, in fact, only
dealing with half of actual reality. The external world is not the only one
there is. To compensate for our failure to deal with inner reality, we have
invented a whole host of disciplines which come under the general banner
of psychology. Those unfortunate enough to collide with this inner realm
we call luna-tics (being moon mad).
The Scrolls do not speak solely of disbelievers of the Teacher's message,
they refer to 'the fearful and unbelieving'. It is this fear of inner reality
which causes so many problems in everyday life. Fear of this dimension is
as illogical and damaging as is dread of the external. Ultimately it can only
lead to either the breakdown of the individual or the collapse of society as a
whole. Biblical allegory has given us a male creator who is really the
Teacher, but there can be no doubt that Scripture makes room for the Queen
of Heaven. Seeing only with our masculine external has prevented us from
perceiving the feminine internal. Surely there is nothing to fear. It may be
entirely different from the realm of logic, but we should not imagine that
the inner world is chaotic and without rules. Neither it nor we would
survive if that were the case. It is, no doubt, a place in which one may in
moments fly to the furthest star and in the same time reach down to the pit
of hell, but its logic is within our reach.
Our age has been dominated by the external masculine in every respect.
All discovery has been material, conquests physical and knowledge logical.
All this has its place, but the problems we face today are a direct result of
the purely masculine and subsequently



384 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
insensitive nature of our progress. Had the solar force of 666 been in
harmony with the lunar number 1080 we should have had progress with
consciousness and development without destruction. These matters are the
politics, religion and science of the ecology of the heart. We have, for far
too long, separated spirituality from actuality and belief from fact. They
belong together, can be bonded together and provide a broader picture of
truth and reality.
If it were somehow possible to take the ancient writings out of the poetic
and religious, if we could return them to the original realms of true and
profound understanding of creation, then we would begin to see with both
eyes. When man eventually abandons external and material religion, with
which he has absolutely no hope of communicating with the Divine within
him, he will replace it with knowledge. This understanding of the inner,
which is a letting go of the outer, will make his life balanced and happy and
itself a constant expression of spirituality. He will become a holy man
without being a holy-man. His sensitivity and fundamental knowledge of
right and wrong will make him upright, loved by both man and God. His
wisdom will endow him with powers of which we can only dream.
Mankind once had these powers. Men knew that the sun, moon and stars
are manifest within us; they comprehended that the infinite can reside
within the finite.
In our time, we lived a metaphor and religion became a mnemonic to
remember fear by. The holy trinity symbolized the Star/ Teacher, the
Sceptre and the spirit Queen of Heaven from which they sprung, but these
somehow became wrapped up in a potent male god whose life was a
blasphemous parody of reality and an insult to the one true and living
Creator. Why should God be made flesh when He is already manifest
within it? From start to finish the story is a nonsense, not even suitable as a
children's bedtime story. Yet it was and, interestingly enough, is set once
again to become believable. As standards of education drop, as crisis in
creases, the superstitious are likely to turn again to a visible and graspable
substitute for the invisible and incomprehensible.
Not only Jesus but many other legendary figures like King Arthur were
metaphors expressing the illusion of time. That which was will be, because
it is. Within the thinking of the minds that created these stories, these things
were true. On the one hand they had to deal with the transportation of the
Grail; on the other they understood that time is an illusion. With feet placed
firmly on the ground, they flew with eagles' wings. In John 1: 51 we read:



THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING 385
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the
angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
This is an echo of the dream of Jacob, who saw a ladder reaching from earth to
heaven. What is being described here does not have to be seen as myth,
magic and fairytale, nor do we need to think of the cosmic tree as 'occult'. It
is rigorous discipline. Its laws differ considerably from the technologies we
know, but it is a science nevertheless. It is the science of inner space, the
ultimate and final frontier, the magic of the Holy Grail. It is the new sun
rising in the Teacher which gives him the power to utter the message from
God. It is the Christ/Goddess filling him that gives his message the
expression of both power and love. He comes to point a new direction to a
lost humanity. As mentioned earlier, he says in Luke 17: 21:
Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of
God is within you.
Where man is certain to find God within himself, he is equally certain
not to find Him in a wooden cross or the image of a beast. But it is man's
nature and history to seek truth only in time of need: man only turns to God
when the work of his own hands has failed him. Such was the case with
King Arthur's knights. They set out to find the Grail after a period of peace
had brought decay and disenchantment. When danger threatened, this was
the time of the Grail quest.
In Sir Thomas Malory's Morte d'Arthur, Merlin, in the presence of
Arthur and his court, prophesies the birth of a man who would sit in the
'Siege Perilous', the seat of danger, which is of mortal peril to all except he
whose destiny it is to find the Sacred Challis. Death would strike down any
other man who sought to reveal the great mystery. Only the Star could
make the revelation without fear. The Siege Perilous would be his only
earthly throne.
In this tale Lancelot frees the daughter of King Pelles, who is a wounded
king reigning over a collapsed kingdom. He is the sun god of the old tree.
The king's daughter, Elaine, uses sorcery to convince Lancelot that she is
his true love, Queen Guinevere, and thus gets him into bed with her. The
issue of this union is Galahad, who in due course is knighted by Lancelot
and becomes a chevalier at Arthur's court. It is he who is destined, as a pure
knight, to recover the Grail. One may see here how the characters in these



386 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
myths reincarnate. After the Grail's mysterious appearance and
disappearance at the court, Arthur remembers Merlin's prophecy that the
initiation of the quest would spell the end of his glorious order of
champions. This, we must suppose, refers to the end of the knights of the
temple of the sun.
In their search, the chevaliers are told by hermits of the cup of the Last
Supper and of Joseph of Arimathea. Eventually Lancelot and his son
Galahad are reunited, only to be separated again. Lancelot finds himself
once more at the court of King Pelles and sees the Challis in all its shining
glory, but he cannot touch it because of his past sins. This story is reflected
almost exactly in the film Return of the Jedi.
At the behest of Christ, seen in a vision, three knights — Galahad,
Percival and Bors (the three brothers of the New Testament epic) — return
the Cup of Truth to the Holy Land.
Somewhere in the folds of the skirts of history, Arthur died, the knights
were scattered and defeated by age and the Grail was lost. And with its loss
came a darkness upon the whole world — a world destined to be without
poetry and without love, insensitive, cruel and mechanistic, and with its
own death stamped upon its face. But Arthur's parting words to Merlin
were 'I shall see you in a little while'. Legend has it that the old mage left
and ended his days in Armorica, for wheresoever Arthur goes Merlin must
go too.
Arthur was the son of Uther Pendragon, the Dumnonian King.
Significantly, the legends are set in the time immediately after the collapse
of Roman power which, I say, is brought about by the Mer-man Teacher's
revelations. During the time of Roman dominion, the faith of the Old Ones
had lain dormant and secret. The Pendragon is the last hope of stemming
the barbarian hordes who follow in the wake of Roman collapse. Add to
this the legend that he is the once and future king, and it is not difficult to
see this story as events in our time.
While Arthur is the king, Merlin is the kingmaker. Excalibur, legend tells
us, was made by the Old Smiths, not from ordinary metal but from that
found in meteorites. Hence the Pendragon's power comes from a dead but
reborn star. A sword with its blade deep in a stone would appear, with its
hilt, as a cross mounted upon a rock. The man Nostradamus calls 'the
Christian king of the world' brings the true, the ancient faith — a modern
Celtic king celebrated in an ancient Celtic legend. Upon the prow of his
ship, the cross within a circle, the sign of the Sons of Light.



THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING 387
Just as in the case of Jacob and Esau, contrary to what may have been
believed by traditional Christians and Jews alike, the kingdom is to be
taken away from them and given to a nation bringing forth good fruit from
the tree.
It is at this point that the myth becomes interesting. Arthur and Vivian
have been childhood sweethearts and they wish to marry, with Vivian to be
his queen. But it is not to be so: their mothers were twin sisters. The lass
later retreats to Ynis Witrin and becomes the Lady of the Lake, the
Goddess. Her mother is Uther's queen; previously she was the wife of
Gorlois, King of Lyonesse. The sun rising in the lion, Leo, tells us that
Gorlois is the old sun and her mother the previous mythic line of the
Goddess. That makes Uther, Arthur's father, the new sun in the tree.
Meanwhile, Vivian is raped and she bears a son. Old Uther's enemy
Margause is convinced that the child, Medraut, is Arthur's, and suspects its
parents are brother and sister. By this method we have forces of light and
dark springing up from the same source. The Saxons swarm in after the
failure of Rome, and it is Saxons who rape her. Medraut has hopes of
ultimately taking the Pendragon's crown, as he believes himself to be his
neglected bastard son. This is a common theme; we see it in the Wicked
Priest.
But ultimately Arthur is a changeling or usurper by the hand of Merlin,
who acts on behalf of the Old Ones. This is a variation on a theme which
occurs repeatedly in Scripture, the object being to convey, as I have
indicated, the idea that the kingdom is to be given to someone other than
the one who was at first believed to be the heir. This I take to be the
evolved Israel rather than the supposed ethnic nation, the new Christians
rather than the old, with the Star and Sceptre rising up from a place other
than that which was expected.
And when should we expect to see the rising of the Star? According to
Scripture, it will be very shortly after we hear a voice crying in the midst of
a spiritual wilderness, at the time of the abomination of spiritual desolation
as was spoken by the prophet Daniel. Nostradamus says: After the games of
slaughter. Probably quite soon.
Excalibur is returned to the Lady of the Lake at Arthur's passing. And the
mysterious Camelot? Just as Shakespeare derived Hamlet from Hamlodi,
Camelot was drawn from the same source: it was the mill from which the
grinding of wisdom produced wise government.
Increasingly, we find ourselves moving into a poetic reality where truth
has its most profound centre. It is more and more



388 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
apparent that we touch upon a real event in history and time, albeit in the
future. There shall be a great war, and by God's grace the Light shall finally
put an end to the Dark. On that day the people will shout, 'Hosanna to the
Son of David'. And, if they were silent, the stones would cry out.
Conclusion
Having concluded that Israel is not an ethnic group but a spiritually evolved people
of all nations, we have sought the origins of the Star and Sceptre.
On the scriptural principle that the tree is to be taken away from the presumed
heirs, and given to a nation bringing forth good fruit, I have concluded that the Star
and Sceptre may spring up from among Celts, in Britain and France respectively. I
also said that the claim of the French kings to Jerusalem as the rightful heirs of the
throne of David was established by the Templars when they conquered that city.
I hope that at this point I have provided sufficient evidence to show that this
story lives deep in the unconscious, from which it can often spring up as an eternal
poetic truth. Nevertheless, more historical evidence can be found in Appendix IV.
There is an element to our saga which has passed through this story without
being given attention. It may have gone unmentioned, but not necessarily
unperceived. It relates to the Shiloh prophecy and the passing of the sceptre.
Nostradamus tells us that when the stone is in the tree, 'the proud nation will be
brought down'.
From this and other related material, we have an otherwise impossible series of
events. As has repeatedly been said, the role of the Star is to establish the Sceptre.
Curiously, if I have read events correctly, the British monarchy will collapse during
the time of the Teacher's ministry.
Historically, the magi came out of Babylonia. Britain and the world she has
largely shaped is what Scripture refers to as Babylon the Great, the whore of
Babylon and other terms of disparagement. This same latter-day Babylon is the
cradle of the new magi led by the Teacher. If I am correct, this would prove a very
typical cycle of convoluted Bible allegory, in which Israel is born of Babylon and
Egypt. The underlying principle behind this and what I have termed catastrophic
evolution is a simple one, and one known to the ancient world: the concept of
positive and constructive imbalance. It tells us that the point of greatest stability is
found at the point of greatest instability, this being the doctrine of Eneidvaddeu. We
would think of this as critical mass. Without constant movement and disruption, life
stagnates.



Book V

Cabbages and Kings
The pattern of life in all its many diffuse expressions seems to be best
described by the pyramid. Here the vast bulk at the base is gradually
refined till it becomes the capstone, which in turn gives expression to, and
governs, the entire structure. This Great Pyramid is in turn composed of
countless smaller ones, both social and ecological. All such formations
have an internal and external structure. They are primarily driven by
unification: they need to unify with themselves and with the whole.
Nature takes full advantage of man's urge to colonize and dominate his
neighbours. Though it be to our credit that we may despise oppression of
any kind, we are obliged to recognize its utilization in the process of
evolution. By this method, one tribe or clan will develop its aggressive
capability and conquer its neighbours, claiming for itself all stores of
wealth and exacting tribute.
Much of this wealth is subsequently wasted; however, sufficient of it is
used to create a leisured class which looks to its own education and
development and in turn acquires new knowledge, which eventually
becomes the property of all mankind. This process being aided by the
liberalism which this wealth and knowledge engenders, it in turn brings
about the collapse of that empire. Life's processes are no respecters of
persons; they look to the common good.
Because man cannot see beyond his earthly life, he is bound to regard it
as precious, which, relatively speaking, it is not. Being locked into his time
and space encourages his commitment to the natural processes and the
development of the human animal.
Until the advent of the British empire, all preceding conquests were
relatively local. The transplantation of life from one area or minor pyramid
to another had no inherent ecological dangers. But Britain, along with its
neighbours France, Spain, Portugal, Holland, Belgium and Germany,
reached out to the entire globe. The small but rapacious group of creatures
who set out to colonize the ends of the earth were, in bulk, peasants. Had
they thrown themselves against their neighbours, as they had often done in
the past, the necessary checks and balances would have prevented social
and ecological disaster. Pitched against the people of the Americas, the
Pacific, Africa and Australia, it proved an uneven contest.



392 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
In time, because of the vast trading potential of this empire, the peasant
colonists accumulated considerable riches and claimed independence from
the by now beleaguered mother country. Wealth does not in itself raise our
position in the natural pyramid structure; it is only a vehicle by which this
can eventually be achieved if genetics allow.
The early settlers brought with them many species of plants and animals
which in their native environment were controlled by the same checks and
balances, but which, as exotics, caused considerable environmental
degradation. Examples of this are the rabbit, opossum, gorse and broom in
New Zealand, the opossum having been brought from Australia.
When the British colonized Fiji they brought labourers from India to
work in their sugar plantations. When they left, the Indian labourers
remained behind. Again, in the Indian environment these people had their
place within the local pyramid. Left in Fiji without checks and balances
they have generally become extremely rapacious and acquisitive. When
they are pitched against the native population, who historically have little
motive for acquisitiveness, it is an uneven fight. Without laws that prevent
Indian ownership of land, the native population would have become slaves
in their own country. The fault does not lie with the migrants; they simply
do what they do best, just like the British who put them there in the first
place. It is pointless looking to blame. Nostradamus tells us that a great
empire would be 'given' to Britain. The rights and wrongs of these things
are out of our hands. Quite logically, the power within any natural force
must have positive and negative potential.
When the Fijian Indian community moved to gain power in the
legislature, the army, with the backing of the tribal chiefs, took control. At
this juncture the Western world threw up its hands in dismay. It did so
largely without any understanding of the problems that Fiji was facing.
Without making any value judgements, this was and is clearly and simply a
matter of a local structure being disrupted by an exotic implant. This we
may say is a microcosm of our present global situation, clearly one where
the natural harmony has been disrupted beyond nature's ability to correct
matters without major upheaval. We can only be absolutely certain that the
correction will be made, whatever the cost.
As I mentioned earlier, over twelve hundred years ago a group of people
called the Khazars converted to Judaism en masse, possibly to stave off
their greedy neighbours. Eventually they were



CABBAGES AND KINGS 393
scattered when the Russians invaded, and we know them today as the
Ashkenazic Jews. It is very likely that no group of people in history ever
developed commerce and acquisitiveness as they have done. These skills
are an essential element in the development of society. They are condoned
by nature and should not be condemned by us. I do not refer to race; I
speak of the widely differing organisms that comprise mankind.
No doubt, as time wore on, the Khazars forgot their roots and identified
solely as the remnant of Israel. Most likely it was not because they were
Jews, but simply because they were unfair competition in the commerce of
the communities where they settled, that they were discriminated against
and forced to move on. This I imagine further generated in them, and the
world around them, the idea of the Wandering Jew, punished for the death
of Christ. In the mean time the real remnant of Israel, those people accused
of witchcraft and heresy, were struggling to survive the Dark Age.
In 1929 the world was faced with the greatest economic depression in
history. Despite draconian measures in some areas of Germany to control
the economic activity of the Khazars, the community became extremely
wealthy and powerful. The country itself was at this time still paying for the
defeat it had suffered in World War I. In due course Germans found
themselves in dire economic straits. As is common in such cases, they
noted that the Jews, as would any rapacious acquisitors no matter what their
ethnicity, were further exploiting and gaining from the situation. As history
tells us, the Germans do tend to go for military solutions to their problems.
The events of this period are a shameful reminder ' of the depths of
depravity to which man can reach. Today, the beast of Germany and of the
Khazars lives again.
While our Great Pyramid looks to unification, there is an equally
powerful force that looks to maintain the independence and integrity of the
component structures. Even the various layers within each local body look
to their own integrity. Thus we may see lower levels of a local or tribal
grouping display extraordinary aggression, not only towards an exotic
interloper, but also toward those who intrude from other levels (classes) of
the same pyramid.
As early as the turn of the century, Zionism was beginning to assert itself
among the Khazars throughout the world. They naturally and reasonably
sought a return to Israel, a land they had in reality never known. At the end
of World War II the suffering that they had supposedly been subjected to
and the sheer resilience of the race



394 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
eventually brought about the establishment of modern Israel, a nation that
Hitler and the Nazis played no small part in fathering.
The bulk of people who became the first settlers were poor and
displaced, but those who had gone as pioneers to the new lands in the
Americas, South Africa, etc. had in many cases become very wealthy and,
as they do today, supported the fledgling state with gifts of money.
In the United States the Israel lobby became extremely powerful. It
established a division between America and the Arab world and then
proclaimed Israel as the only friend of the West in the Middle East. This
brought ever-growing foreign aid and military resources to Israel from the
United States. The most powerful of these lobby groups in Washington is
AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. We must also take
into account the country's very large and prominent fundamentalist
Christian movement, which looks to the Jews as being a senior branch of
the chosen of God. The more one looks at this whole situation the more it is
seen to be a fantastic comedy of errors. But it is no laughing matter: now
that the Soviet Union has collapsed, the situation has become extremely
volatile.
If the events of which I speak are of purely earthly manifestation, then
my argument has a small but very noticeable flaw. As I have said, it
probably did not take many generations for the Khazar people to forget
their real origins, which became submerged by their later being the remnant
of the Chosen People.
Rabbinic Judaism has long had at its disposal a vast body of cabalistic
literature. Even the meanest of scholars would be aware of its existence and
prominent role within Judaism. Through the study of these writings, many
Sephardic Jews made the leap into becoming truly and genuinely members
of the group termed 'a holy people'. These had their blood shed because
they were accused of witchcraft, not because they were highly successful
merchants and eccentric outsiders. The make-up of the Khazars is such as
to make them successful at most enterprises to which they turn their hand.
And within the present international community such people and their skills
are essential.
I could never believe that the evidence in Scripture regarding Israel
would have been missed by many Ashkenazic rabbis. This being so, one
must wonder, when clearly there was plenty of time for change, why that
change did not take place.
Although the Khazar state may have made a massive and almost



CABBAGES AND KINGS 395
instantaneous conversion, it would have taken generations for the die to be
cast. Surely the early rabbis must have seen the inconsistencies. And, if
nothing else, they could have done better than labelling themselves the
generations of Ashkenaz. But then again there may have initially been
more political than religious motivation. My own opinion is that there were
and are external forces shaping and moulding human affairs, these being
both positive and negative. The outcome of earthly events depends entirely
on the capacity of individuals to align themselves with the light. This can
only be achieved by the ruthless acquisition of real truth and the rigorous
maintenance of the pyramid.
Behind all these events lies a 'time' bomb waiting to explode. The matter
cannot be overstated. The Scriptures and the Dead Sea Scrolls are set to
make an enormous impact on what has become an already volatile world.
Modern Israel is an accident waiting to happen. If the fallout is to be
contained, it becomes necessary that everyone concerned acknowledge
otherwise unacceptable truths. But such would be entirely out of character
for most of us, it is in the nature of man to die defending the indefensible.
My suggestion that we face the truth is thus rendered fatuous.
Because of its physical circumstances, modern Israel as a nation is
unstable and unpredictable. It holds its own conceptions of a jihad, a holy
war. The danger lies not in the simplicity of yet another instance of
religious differences in a remote place we know as the Middle East; it is
manifest in Israel's power in the United States and the Arab world's
awareness of it.
Paul Findley was a United States Congressman for twenty-two years.
During this time he displayed absolutely no trace of anti-Semitism. To the
contrary, he supported much pro-Israel legislation. In his book They Dare
To Speak Out41 he says of the Jewish lobby (pages 37-38) that lobbyists for
AIPAC generally have almost total access to members of the House and
Senate and feel free even to call them at home. He explains that they are
very professional and are known to have powerful contacts. In many cases,
they have the ability to make or break the career of a member of the
legislature.
Of all lobbyists, AIPAC is probably the most influential. Much of its
strength comes from its thoroughness in keeping records of all House and
Senate business. As Paul Findley points out, the power of this pressure
group is such that, on 3 October 1984, the House of Representatives
approved a bill that removed all trade restrictions



396 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
between Israel and the United States. Despite its damaging effect upon US
economic interests, the vote was 416 to 6.
With this kind of influence the instability of the Middle East is
transferred directly to Washington and then the country as a whole.
Inasmuch as the US is now the de facto world policeman, the situation has
become far more dangerous than it was, The Soviet imperium was
particularly despotic, but its existence succeeded in maintaining a balance
and focus of aggression in international tribalism. We should remember
that the US bolstered the economy of its enemy the USSR for some
considerable time before its collapse.
Many members of the Senate and House of Representatives are
intimidated or subservient to the Israeli and American-Jewish lobbies. As
we have seen in recent times, American presidents have been more like
cabbages than kings. It then becomes probable that the tail will wag the
dog. It is common knowledge and a standing joke in the higher echelons of
the international business community that the capital of Israel is not
Jerusalem but Washington, and that the government of the US is not
American but Israeli. In these circles even its street address in Washington
is well known.
The Arab countries are oil rich in an oil hungry world and becoming
increasingly frustrated with Israel's intransigence and what is reasonably
seen as her support by the Great Satan. The West has thus far managed to
keep the Arabs divided against themselves. Strangely enough, though
Saddam Hussein was made to appear so evil during the Gulf War, he
remained in government because he is one of the few who is able to control
the more extreme factions in the Middle East. Furthermore it is an
extraordinary coincidence that, though the West stands foursquare on the
side of democracy, light and truth, an enemy of the Zionist state is one we
are taught to hate. Yet it is more often Israel that stands as the stubborn
aggressor. It is yet another coincidence that the Arab countries have thus far
managed to stay reasonably clear of the grasping hands of the international
bankers. With United Nations' sanction, the United States is at present
bleeding Iraq dry. Sooner or later the Middle East must explode.
Though supposedly enlightened, the Christian West is historically
Islamophobic. Its inhumane inaction in Bosnia clearly evidences this — a
fact obviously not missed by the Islamic world. Furthermore, Russia's
determination to survive, and her history as Europe's first line of defence
against Asia, make her an unpredictable quantity. More than seventy years
of Communism have



CABBAGES AND KINGS 397
succeeded in creating a people left hungry and stripped of moral values.
Their pyramid structures have been utterly decimated. Islamic
fundamentalism is not only to be found in the Arab countries, many former
states of the Soviet Union have strong Islamic components. Some of these
have direct access to nuclear weapons, and they are as likely to use them as
anyone else.
In my opinion, quite contrary to what we would like to believe, man is
still predominantly an animal, made dangerous to the world and himself by
his achievements in the modern sciences. We have yet to evolve into the
species we think of as humanity. These 'Tomorrow People' will not behave
as we do; they will not be allowed to and generally should not want to. We
are all potentially these Tomorrow People; we are not limited or excluded
by race, colour or religion. We can only exclude ourselves if we fail to
make the leap of consciousness that will be a trademark of Homo novus.
Since you have reached thus far into this text, I must assume that you,
like I, are concerned with rising above the common, all-encompassing
preoccupation with food, shelter and procreation. (But let me add that, for
myself, these are not entirely without merit.) What I am setting down
before you is, quite simply and without pretension, all that I have found.
And I do so believing it to be extremely important. I am convinced of the
certainty of events that will occur in the near future. As I see matters, they
are irrevocable and unavoidable. But I believe that, as individuals, we have
the power to write our names in the book of life. And in so saying I do not
speak of religious conversion.
Contrary to popular belief, Orwell's 1984 is not behind us. It is ahead of
us. The contents of this book, seen in relation to the world's socio-political
situation, both past and present, paint a horrifying picture of 'that which
must shortly come to pass' — not in a religious sense, but as a logical
product of cause and effect.
It is extraordinary but true that in today's world, with instant global
communications, you and I know much less of the events that affect our
lives than did our ancestors who lived their entire lifetimes in small
villages. While you preoccupy yourself with improving the lot of yourself
and your family, there exists something much more powerful than you
which is planning to reduce you and yours to slavery. The cyclops that you
watch while you take your rest from your labours has been specifically
designed to weaken and subdue you into moronic indifference to your own
fate. Behind the news there is a fall of events of which you will



398 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
never be told. A small, powerful and unseen group of people with a
demonic desire for power are working to establish a global empire under a
universally appealing messianic leader. They even choose the politicians
that you vote for. And if those little men do not obey them, they are simply
replaced.
Slowly, the vice is turning. You have been anaesthetized and made
indifferent by the little mechanical toys with which you play, and which
will in due course be taken away. Almost certainly, by the end of this
decade Israel will have rebuilt the Temple, and with the military power of
the United States will, under one man — probably the most evil and
demonic who ever lived — establish a one-world government which, most
likely, will bring about the death and destruction of you and your children.
To demonstrate how much these events are 'at hand', the following is a
clear example. It paints a picture of a future you cannot avoid. Your first
step to salvation is to act in the manner of a man: to shed your sloth, gird
your loins and sharpen the weapon that is rusting on your shoulders. Death
is life's only certainty; your only choice is whether you live and die as a
man or a dog.
In a recent publication privately circulated by an American Jewish
pseudo-Christian organization based in Abilene, Texas, an appeal was
made for the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem. The document
petitions world leaders to encourage this rebuilding on the principle that it
is the only way to bring about world peace. These astute Bible scholars
appear to be at odds with Daniel 9: 25-26:
Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the
commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince
shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built
again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for
himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the
sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war
desolations are determined.
The report states that engineers and surveyors have found that the
foundations for the building of the Temple detailed by Ezekiel are already
in place. These take account of the existence of the Dome of the Rock. As
in Ezekiel 40: 19, the pavements only extend to the north and east; the
pavement of 100 cubits (approximately 175 feet) to the south — where the
mosque stands — is omitted,



CABBAGES AND KINGS 399
there being only a separating wall in its place. This extraordinary claim, if
proved, would suggest that the ancient builders of Jerusalem anticipated the
existence of the mosque, or that the Templars may have had a hand in the
work. This would certainly explain why Freemasons claim that it was they
who built Solomon's Temple. It is thus argued in the report that it can be
built next door to, and without destroying, the Dome of the Rock.
It is likely that Israel is at present negotiating this possibility with the
Arab world. And who among the devout Christians and Jews throughout
the globe would not want to contribute to this monument to religious
blindness and human suffering on a scale beyond anything we have ever
known?
'What can I do?', you ask. More than you realize. Simply educate
yourself and act upon what you learn. Do not leave the education or
entertainment of your children in any hands but your own. Decide for
yourself if you are to be free and have human dignity or if you will simply
be a beast fed through the bars of his little suburban cage. If you do not take
total control of your life, someone else will; and you will live to regret it.
The world that you knew is dying and a new one is being born. Your
commitment to it is best expressed by a commitment to truth and the
abandonment of delusion. In this time of upheaval and change, fear and
cowardice are punishable by death. Sooner or later you will be forced to
choose between dying with the old or rebirth with the new. The time of the
captivity of the meek has ended; the moment of the destruction of the weak
has begun.
Religion uses terms like 'sin' and 'guilt', and it tells us we must set the
love of God above all else. If we see sin as being behaviour which an
animal cannot control, guilt then only becomes applicable to our failure to
evolve to the level of loving the God within, who makes us angels risen
above the beast. Our evolution and its relationship to the second coming of
Christ can only happen through individual commitment to the elevation of
self.
As far as the future is concerned, no doubt our present United Nations is
a dark foreshadowing of an international state — not in any way a new
form of colonialism but a unification of mankind filled with the potential
for saintliness. But this, as I have indicated, and as seems to be the nature of
things, will be preceded by a very dark shadow — one generated by the
historical materialism that has led to the prominence and power of the
Khazars in a materialistic world. But the spiritual one that follows this
shadow



400 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
the real world — will be committed to individual freedom and the strict
rule of law, two elements which cannot be separated. At present we do
battle not with each other but with the God within us. Ultimately it is not a
question of ethnicity, though ethnic integrity must be rigorously
maintained. Tribal and cultural individuality is essential; unity is only
found in diversity. There is but one God and we are all His children. The
final distinction is between Man and beast.
Some idea of the fall of events in the immediate future may be obtained
by turning again to Nostradamus. Among his writings there are two letters:
one to his spiritual son, the Teacher, and one to the Christian King Henry
of France, the Sceptre. As best the events can be understood, the
Apocalypse gets under way with the arrival of the third and final Antichrist
in '1999 and seven months'. The seven could be July, the seventh month, or
perhaps September (sept = seven).
In his letter to the Teacher he makes the following points:
1. His son must interpret his prophecies 'for the benefit of all mankind'.
2. There is to be a worldwide destruction which includes the Noacian
flood, in which 'hardly any land will not be inundated, and this will last
until all has perished'.
3. This is to be preceded by a worldwide drought, which has already
begun to establish itself. It is combined with, or followed by, a heavy fall of
meteorites.
4. The monarchy is to return and begin the Golden Age after a long
period of republicanism which Nostradamus seems to see beginning in
1732.
5. War is to affect the entire globe.
In the War Scroll, the greatest part of the army of Satan is the Kittim.
This name has been a puzzle to Scrolls scholars, who have yet to find for it
a satisfactory identification. Most weight has been given to contentions that
they are the Romans or the Cypriots, but little evidence is offered to support
either hypothesis.
Because the War Scroll is discussing an apocalyptic war at the end of the
age, 'Kittim' must be a symbolic name. While it is not likely to give up its
secret easily, it does nonetheless present us with a clue. And perhaps the
answer has, after all, been staring us in the face. One ancient group of
people with a very similar name was known to the Egyptians as the Kheta;
Homer calls them the Keteioi. It turns out that these Hattic people, as they
are called, are



CABBAGES AND KINGS 401
none other than the Hittim — Hittites — of the Old Testament. Again, the
name is very much the same. In the Bible they have no particular
significance other than that they were one of the groups which, according
to the story, were displaced when the Israelites took over Palestine. But
when we look at their origins we may well be on the track of something
very compelling.
The Hattic people were of Turkic stock. They take their name from the
city of Hatti in central Turkey, now known as Boghazkoy. At around the
middle of the third millenium BCE the inhabitants of eastern Asia Minor
were an Armenoid type who, at the end of the third millenium, were
conquered by and assimilated with Indo-Europeans. As was the case with
the conquest of the Edomites by Israel, these conquered tribes eventually
proved more resilient and more aggressive than their conquerors.
There are strong parallels here with another group of whom we know.
The Khazars were also of Turkic stock, they have been — in some respects
— wonderful assimilators, and they have also proved far more resilient
than the various groups that have conquered them over the centuries, to the
point that they are now poised to take economic control of the world.
Scripture obviously sees the final conflagration as being a war between
two competing Israels. It seems reasonable to posit that the Kittim/Khazars
are the false Israel who follow the Antichrist.
In his letter to the 'most Christian king of France', Nostradamus may be
interpreted as saying the following:
1. The events he covers run to 'the beginning of the seventh millennium',
this being a little after the year 2000 CE.
2. At this time, the adversaries of the true Church of Christ begin to
multiply.
3. The Antichrist makes war against 'the royal person' of the Vicar of
Christ. He makes war against the Sceptre.
4. This is to be preceded by the darkest solar eclipse since the creation of
the world.
5. The dating of these events seems to be set by the prophecy that in the
month of October (1917), a great revolution is made. This gives rise to the
'New Babylon, a miserable prostitute large with abomination'. Thus,
according to Nostradamus, the Soviet Union lasts for 'seventy-three years
and seven months'.
6. The collapse of the USSR is followed at some stage by the advent of
the Teacher 'from the root that has been barren for such a long time'. He
'will renew all the Christian Church. Then shall be



402 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
great peace and union between some of the children of races long
wandering and separated by diverse kingdoms.'
7. All this will then be in the power of three brothers, the Sceptre, the
Star and John the Baptist. The youngest of these, the Sceptre, will uphold
the kingdom after the oldest, the Star (Teacher) has established it with the
community already gathered by John.
8. Nostradamus refers to 'the branch long barren'. This is Coma, who is
mother to the three brothers. He says there 'will proceed one who shall
deliver the people of the world from meek and voluntary slavery'. This
refers to submission to the idol Jesus and false religion generally. He
indicates that the Branch/Sceptre will lead a war to free his people.
9. This process of change sounds as though it will be slow and
stumbling. He says of the new Christians, 'and the senior men of the
Church shall be put back from the love of God and many of them shall
apostatize from the faith'. This must refer to the works of the Liar and the
unfaithfulness of New Israel as recorded in the Old Testament.
10. I find Nostradamus extremely hard to interpret correctly, but there is
no doubt that, while the new Church is growing and its fame is spreading, it
is often split from within and persecuted from without. Added to all this
confusion is Arab expansion, which seems to begin in 1999. The key to
interpretation of the timing of these events seems to lie in the fact that
Nostradamus makes some very obvious blunders in his dates from Scripture
and then insists that he 'cannot err'. He obviously knows only too well that
Noah, Jesus, David etc. are one, but keeps dangling very meaningful
numbers before the reader's eyes.
No doubt the cataclysm described in the vast body of eschat-ological
literature can account for the destruction of a large portion of wicked
mankind. For example, at the end of column VI of the Hymns Scroll, we
learn:
The scourging flood when it advances Shall not invade the
stronghold.
The stronghold is the temple/tree. But one must wonder how a relative
minority are to conquer the world. It must, of course, be by God's will. In
an earlier verse we find the tree with an entirely new dimension and a
means by which God may achieve this purpose, when the tree itself
becomes a weapon of war:



CABBAGES AND KINGS 403
And then at the time of Judgement
the Sword of God shall hasten, and all the sons of His truth shall awake
to [overthrow] wickedness; all the sons of iniquity shall be no more. The
Hero shall bend his bow; the fortress shall open on to endless space and the
everlasting gates shall send out weapons of war. They shall be mighty
from end to end [of the earth and there shall be no escape]
for the guilty of heart [in their battle]; they shall be utterly trampled
down without any [remnant].
We have seen, time and again, that much of the history of the last two
thousand years either has been an unconscious expression of long-lost
truths or has at least been influenced by these realities. It seems to me
preposterous, but the question needs to be asked: Is it possible that much of
science fiction and fantasy writing is an expression of what we see in the
above? Did John Wyndham find his triffids in the same unconscious
elements as H. G. Wells saw a war of the (inner) worlds? Should we see, in
much modern fantasy, latter-day prophetic writing? If taken literally, the
above suggests events which only science fiction writers could imagine.
In the above quotation from the Hymns Scroll it is said that the fortress
will open onto endless space and weapons of war will issue from its gates
to every part of the earth. This statement is evocative of the common
apocalyptic idea of fire raining down from heaven. Should we interpret this
as meaning that the angels will hijack the American Star Wars weapons
system and use it on mankind as a whole? Certainly this new-born remnant
of Israel will need all the help it can get, but the idea is preposterous.
There is, however, another more fantastic 'guess' to be made. Homo
novus, as has been said, is a new and more highly evolved species. Is it
remotely possible that the strange but intelligently moving objects (UFOs)
that appear in our skies with greater and greater frequency are there to
achieve two objectives? Firstly, they might in some way be helping with
and promoting the evolutionary process. Perhaps the appearance of crop
circles is a part of this



404 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
process: the circles themselves could well be mathematical puzzles
designed to exercise the minds of these tomorrow people. Secondly, these
strangers in our skies might well provide the fire power that the Hymns
Scroll speaks of and which may be such that all the earth's major cities
might be razed after selected individuals have been subconsciously told to
leave.
As has happened throughout human evolution, the succeeding species
has always engaged in the total genocide of its predecessor. The Bible has
numerous passages where God is telling the invading children of Israel to
leave no survivors, and the Scrolls are totally supportive of the idea. The
Talmud is even more specific. It has a number of names for non-Israel, the
most common being Goyim, 'Gentiles' (actually 'nations'). Others include
Edom, Kuth-im, Nokrim and Apikorosim. The following are a few
examples of how this new species is to treat the nations:
Reference
1. Kerithuth 6b. Israel is human, Gentiles are not.
2. Makkoth 7b. It is no crime to kill a Gentile.
3. Orach Chaiim 225,10. Gentiles are likened to animals.
4. Orach Chaiim 330,2. Gentile childbirth is not to be assisted on the sabbath.
5. Pesachim 49b. It is permitted to slaughter Gentiles on the sabbath.
6. Zohar 11,43a. Gentiles are to be exterminated.
7. Zohar 11,64b. The Gentile birth rate is to be put into decline.
8. Hilkhoth Akum 10,2. Gentiles who will not cease idolatry must be slaughtered.
9. Sepher Or Israel 177b. It is no sin to kill Gentiles.
10. Abhodah Zarah 26b. Gentiles to be slaughtered.
11. Babha Bathra 154b. Gentile property automatically belongs to the first Israel
claimant.
12. Iore Dea 154,2. Gentiles are not to be educated to the level of a tradesman.
13. Iore Dea 337,1. Gentile slaves are likened to beasts of burden.
These are but a few of countless references that indicate the annihilation
of one species by that which has superseded it. Unfortunately many
present-day Khazar Jews believe that after the coming of their Messiah it
will be their religious duty, as the chosen of God, to carry out the injunction
to utterly exterminate the Gentiles. From our humble beginnings in
Australopithecus



CABBAGES AND KINGS 405
africanus, this is an event that has occurred many times in our evolution.
One must then wonder if awareness of these events has been slowly and
inexorably rising in human consciousness as the time draws near.
The 'gentle Jesus, meek and mild' image of the Bible peddled by the
Church at Christmas belies a reality that the Scriptures promote ethnic
cleansing on an unimagined scale. Four hundred years from now
according to Daniel — humanity as we know it today will cease to exist. It
will be replaced by higher beings which, although sired by us, will have
little in common with their predecessors. But consider the implications of
this doctrine in the hands of a modern Israel powerful enough to declare
war on the world. It is a recipe for unimaginable disaster.
In one sense it would be safe to say that a substantial number of the
mysteries in Scripture were not put there by God or the scribes. They have
been created by those who have progressively mysteri-orized these writings
by building a religious edifice based on misinterpretation, which has been
progressively compounded. But then, the notion of the Bible being
addressed to the future humanity would have been beyond the
comprehension of our species. The real miracle of modern Christianity is
that it convinces its followers that they will be spared the wrath that is to
come. As an example, I Thessalonians 4: 13-18 is one of the bases for the
concept of the 'rapture'. It says in verse 16 that those who are asleep (the
dead) will be called up. Verse 17 reads:
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with
them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be
with the Lord.
As mentioned earlier, the pillar of cloud is the pillar of stone, hence
being 'caught up in the clouds' could quite reasonably be seen as an allegory
for passing through the stones. But the operative word here is 'air'. Were the
scribe speaking of being in heaven 'with the Lord', he would have used the
word 'ouranos', but he uses 'aer', the stuff that we breathe and birds fly in,
and thus, in the literal sense, has the saved in perpetual suspension in the
sky. This passage then describes passing through the stones in the spirit.
But it all gets much more serious than this. The word 'Gentile' has come to
mean Gentile as opposed to Jewish. Not so: in Scripture the Jews are
sometimes Gentiles. But then, even this statement is



406 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
incorrect. The fact is that there is no word in Scripture which can be
translated 'Gentile'. The word itself is Latin — 'gentilis'. The Hebrew 'Goy'
and Greek 'ethnos' are collective nouns which in the singular mean 'tribe' or
'nation'.
'Goyim' and 'ethne' are the plural form, meaning 'tribes' and 'nations'.
The Latin 'gentilis' refers to other nations as opposed to ours. Thus a
Roman speaking of the gentilis would refer to non-Romans, and this would
include Jews. Equally so, an Englishman might use the word to include
Romans. Likewise, a Jew might speak of gentilis and include Muslims and
Christians. The words 'goy' and 'ethnos' are used in the following passages
in Scripture to describe Israel and the Jews:
Genesis 12: 2 Genesis 35:11 Luke 7: 5
Genesis 17: 4 Genesis 48:19 John 11: 48
Genesis 17: 5 Isaiah 1: 4 John 11: 50
Genesis 20: 4 Isaiah 10: 6 Acts 24: 2
Genesis 25: 23 Jeremiah 31: 36 Acts 24:17
But what about the word 'Jew'?
'Jew' is a modern derivation dating from 1175; Sheridan, it seems,
introduced it into English in The Rivals. Shakespeare referred to the Tewe',
this being a derivative of the New Testament Tudaeus' (Latin) and
'Ioudaios' (Greek). The biblical Jews were nothing more than the
inhabitants of Judea, who appear after 536 BCE. It is a tribal name, and does
not apply to any other Israelites. Accordingly, the biblical Jesus is not a Jew
but a Galilean. Thus, the modern term 'Jewish' and its derivation actually
exclude most so-called Jews.
If we, today, make a division between Jews and Gentiles, we should not
in any way relate this to Scripture, where in New Testament times the
Romans might quite legitimately have referred to the Judeans — true
biblical Jews — as 'Gentiles'. Furthermore, Semites are the descendants of
Shem, and this term describes the Arab peoples. Modern Jews are
descendants of the Asiatic Khazars. The land of Palestine was, when
occupied by Rome, actually and ironically primarily Edomite. It is then
quite correct to say that Israel's and world-wide Jewry's antipathy to the
Arabs is anti-Semitism. The apparent nonsense of my postulate is only
indicative of the flight of fancy that establishes the opposing view.
These few illustrations will show how far removed modern religion is
from the Bible. It is ridiculous to take this new belief



CABBAGES AND KINGS 407
system back to the book and have it justified and rationalized therein. Thus
it may be reasonably argued that so-called traditionalists have strayed well
away from original scriptural beliefs and concepts and that the
interpretations found in this essay are, in fact, fundamentalist.
The following becomes abundantly clear. From the outset, traditional
Christianity and modern Judaism could not even begin to comprehend the
complexity of the Bible and, for their own convenience, progressively
moved away from it. But then, they were never going to, because it had
been aimed over their heads. It was consigned to what I have termed 'the
tomorrow people', who would understand with ease. The Teacher is then
the first of this new humanity, and this becomes obvious in verses such as
John 14: 12, where Jesus the Teacher says:
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I
do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go
unto my Father.
We might translate this as saying: Why marvel at me when, as the spirit
of the age awakens your feminine, you will achieve greater than I? Which
is to say that Jesus is only the first and relatively inept individual member
of this new wonder-working humanity.
In this instance we have another indication, from the prophet's mouth,
that this latter-day mystic is not divine; only the first among many. But this
raises the question as to whether we are speaking of a spiritual evolution
alone, or whether it is the result of a gene pool that has survived from the
time of the ancient priests. But then, if such a pool existed at that time, why
could not Israel have gone through this process thousands of years ago?
Perhaps it needed further adjustment. Interestingly, people who claim to
have been abducted and taken aboard the foreign vehicles which appear in
our skies have often said that they were subjected to medical examination.
Perhaps there is some relationship here to the development of this new
human strain.
But this is all 'perhaps...', and it is so because our intellectual resources
are being wasted specifically with a view to avoiding the truth. Most of us
accept that reality extends beyond our three-dimensional perception of it.
We term the extrasensory world 'occult' and 'mysterious'. The fact is that we
do not know because we do not want to know; and this, sooner or later, will
be our



408 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
undoing. To illustrate my point, it would be safe to say that this book
probably contains one of the largest collections of extraordinary claims
ever made in one volume. Yet, somehow, they seem to have a ring of truth;
and you will likely admit that the author seems eager to keep his feet fixed
firmly upon the ground. One could certainly not say he has lost touch with
reality altogether. This being so, and if we presume that this work is not
totally wrong in its conclusions, the question arises as to how far the world
is now removed from reality.
Look up to the sky and observe those millions of Mary Poppinses who
clearly have neither wings nor parachutes. And if even one of their number
has a map or a compass, do any of these poor beggars know how to read it?
And if one of them could, would any of them have the wit to follow this
righteous teacher of reality? How bad must your world become before you
will take the trouble to save yourself? Is what you have at the moment such
a wonderful prize? Do you somehow imagine that you can hide from the
death which, at this moment, is lurking at your door? Look up into the sky.
But then it becomes clearer and clearer that that which has been expelled
from the conscious mind has expressed itself subliminally. This repression
of the feminine has more than once given rise to false ideologies.
Nazism had a profoundly occult centre which for the Germans made it a
religious rather than political movement. Until the day of Communism's
collapse in the USSR, children in schools were daily taught to love and
revere Grandfather Lenin. Christianity has absolutely no monopoly on false
religion. What we are seeing is purely and simply primitive tribalism:
human beings running in packs, manifestly more vicious than dogs,
primarily because of the absence of the balancing and civilizing lunar force
which we described by the number 1080.
Deep inside us all lies the lust for blood, very clearly a substantial part of
both male and female sexuality. Until this beast is bred out of us there will
never be peace. The alternative is that it must be rigorously controlled until,
as we are told in the Scrolls, all the times of darkness are ended.
And it is here that we may find that total feminine understanding, the
Weltanschauung of the events I have outlined in this book. Just as the first
thoughtful primitive man began to see and truly understand human nature,
his descendant, the powerful priest, did so much more. Where we began
looking at religion through its ancient



CABBAGES AND KINGS 409
documents, and I suggested all manner of strange possibilities, we
inevitably reached the point where these writings deal with the human
condition. Unravelling the mysteries of Scripture is in itself an academic
exercise. It will ultimately only be of interest for a limited number of
people. Proving that you can get blood from a stone changes nothing;
understanding that these ancient texts go far beyond religion and time, and
speak eternal truths, is essential. Christianity has proved itself an extremely
useful holding pattern. Without it or something like it in our time, the beast
within might have manifested itself much more cruelly than it did. But that
age is now coming to a close. It is time for a new beginning.
Transitions cannot occur completely bloodlessly. The universe cannot
change gear without major upheaval upon earth. A mother cannot give birth
without spilling her own blood. As Jesus says "These things must surely
come to pass'. This then leaves matters in the hands of the individual. Be he
Christian or Jew, he must look to his own survival. Cosmic consciousness,
becoming one with the Divine, can surely never occur while he denies the
reality of his darker self. One cannot defeat an enemy whose existence is
denied, particularly if one hides him behind a curtain of false beliefs.
We have every reason to suppose that the future of mankind right here on
earth is only just beginning. If the evidence is to be trusted, unimagined
peace and happiness await us and our children. It is entirely up to the
individual to beat the sword within him into a plowshare. Until we learn the
eternal lesson that we change the world only by changing ourselves, all
wisdom and hope are lost to us.
If the word 'God', which we use to describe the Eternal, the Unbegotten,
He that ever was and ever shall be, were more akin to the word 'reality',
perhaps life would be much easier. God is surely that ultimate and perfect
truth and reality. Our walk toward Him must begin with our staring directly
at truth within ourselves. Man may in this age have been made in the image
of the Jesus beast, but in the new world he will be made anew. The
transformation cannot occur — we cannot ever hope to know the Creator
— unless we acknowledge the beast inside us all. Not until we have bound
that old serpent in chains, not until we have faced and slain the dragon who
guards and hides it from us, can we drink from the cup of the Holy Grail,
which holds within it the blood, the sweat and the tears of a living man they
called Jesus.
Interestingly, for such is the nature of things, when the Teacher



410 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
makes his appearance it is the realist who will recognize and accept him. What the
Scrolls term 'the fearful and unbelieving' will damn themselves primarily because
they fear to face reality and accept its consequences. Can there be any other
explanation for the mess the world is in and the horrors that lie ahead of us? Is it
correct to speak of the 'real world' when it is clearly a product of our avoiding
reality?
Conclusion
Let us simply list the statements made in this section:
1. The structure of societies and of earth's ecology is analogous to the Great
Pyramid.
2. Modern Israel has growing economic and political influence over an increasingly
powerful United States.
3. There are plans afoot to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem, and this accords with
prophecy of a coming Jewish Antichrist who, with the Zionist state, will rule the
world and then bring about its destruction.
4. The mass killing of inferior mankind could well involve what have come to be
known as UFOs.
5. The terms 'Jew' and 'Gentile' are meaningless in the present context, and are not
scriptural.
6. The true Jews/Israel are an evolved humanity which is yet to manifest; then there
will come a division of these and the Gentiles, the latter to be annihilated by the
former.
These points will be expanded in the following sections.
The reader has probably long since begun to puzzle as to how any one book
could contain such a collection of extraordinary claims yet, strangely, maintain an
apparent coherence and ring of truth. My response to this is: Very, very simple.
Look into the history books. There you will find, among those who shaped the arts
and sciences and who are remembered today as heroes, a disproportionate number
for whom the contents of this book and its standpoint would have been quite
unremarkable. One very recent example is the poet and mystic W. H. Auden, who
begins his poem 'The Old Man's Road' by thumbing his nose at the Church and its
wooden idol:
Across the Great Schism, through our whole landscape, Ignoring God's
Vicar and God's Ape...
Could it be that it is your world, your thinking and your life that represent the true
insanity? And, if this is so, what are you doing about it?

Matters of Interest and of Consequence
The book you are holding before you is the sum total of one man's search
for truth. But, one may ask, what is truth? That the question should be
raised implies that it is now lost to us. I am one who insists that actuality is
singular. If we set any supposed veracity in juxtaposition with another, then
quite clearly at least one of them must prove to be false. Ultimately the
only surety of a truth is its ability to survive reality and its subsequent
usefulness therein.
We might also ask ourselves if the author has the qualifications for the
task he has undertaken. Well... if I compare myself with the countless
eminent scholars who would argue that my position is ridiculous and that
they are the only spouters of truth, I am happy to say I am totally
unqualified. But then we should wonder about the motivation that would
drive a man to such arduous labour as would be required to produce a book
of this kind.
Quite simply, I measure my entire life by its degree of self de
termination; in my own mind the measure of a man is his degree of
willingness to fight for his right to think unmolested. I believe myself
arrogant and brave (foolish) enough to fight the Devil unto death for that
right. And why not? Without freedom, life is worthless.
Now, though it be a truly great treasure, and the scarcest commodity on
earth, the more that freedom is shared the stronger is its value and the
greater is its currency. Though it may seem an absolute contradiction
and I do not expect anyone but myself to understand this — I found my
greatest measure of liberty when I invited my total subjugation to God and
slavery to the spirit of Christ. No man can win and taste, by his own hand,
the incredible sweetness of the independence bestowed by the Creator.
The above is neither a public confession nor an attempt to win converts.
Our individual beliefs are strictly our private affairs, and this is an intrinsic
aspect of that same freedom.
The following few autobiographical details pertaining to the origins of
this book will give the reader some idea as to the elusive-ness of so-called
truth and reality and the dangers of being free.
How many times, I wonder, can a man love and be loved in one lifetime?
How often will he hold the delicate flower of love, be dazzled by its colour
and beauty and fill his nostrils with its sweet



412 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
perfume? Later, the romance is lost as the flower is crushed and only the
fleshly thorns remain; too great a knowledge brings disillusion. True love
falls victim to the flesh, but is what inflames a man's passions the source of
true love or the means by which the flower captures his seed? Can
something as delicate as a rose be so cynical in its mindless determination
to keep life captive in the world? Can it be that the victor is the vanquished
and to the victim go the spoils?
In similar vein, I look back upon the books I have known and adored,
those that I have held, caressed and entered. Each one gave of its essence,
surrendering to me unconditionally; but I am mindful that each of these was
something of a literary femme fatale who would have as easily given of her
innermost self to any man who could pay the price these whores of wisdom
have imprinted upon their backs. But for all that, there were some I knew as
few men have known them. One or two surrendered to me much more than
even their mother or father had realized was living within them. A sentient
man's life is solely a search for perfect love. After countless literary
debauches for which I have at last been brought to book, a vita libra filled
with these promiscuous paper roses, I think only my first love was my one
true love.
We first came together over a bottle of wine of very questionable quality.
It was in the wee small hours of morning, at that time when the spirit
hungers. At the conclusion of our encounter I was intoxicated, not only
with the wine but also with my beautiful companion. Sodden with drink
and drunk with love, I wrote an ode to my new-found inamorata.
The last verse of that poem is quoted at the end of the last chapter of this
book. It is a mystery to me that as a young man, knowing nothing of and
caring even less for the Bible and its hidden mysteries, and having
consumed a bottle of what was surely the least of the gifts of the grape,
those words should issue from my pen.
The name of this object of my love sometimes escapes me, miraculously
as she has appeared; often she has been no more than a dream. But then
clarity returns: she is The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery.42
Ah!, you say, I loved her too.
Yes, my words were inspired by a little golden-haired boy who loved a
rose in a story told in a children's book. He had left her behind in his home
on asteroid B-612, which was no bigger than a house.



MATTERS OF INTEREST AND OF CONSEQUENCE 413
My poem was a synopsis of The Little Prince. A glance at it will show
that it is an encapsulation of The Thirteenth Stone, the rest being only a
commentary that I added when, sadly, I became a grown-up. Somehow it
seems that all things are set within the circle; there is nothing new under
the sun. But the verse was only a reminder. We need to go much further
back.
My memories of childhood are few, but there is one that is as fresh as
though it were from yesterday. I was about seven or eight years of age and
sitting on the front doorstep of my home, which was some ten minutes'
walk from the old city of London. As I hugged my knees, I watched the
busyness of the street — people hurrying upon errands of consequence,
parcels delivered and collected, the postman emptying the big round red
postbox, his hand filled with a bunch of keys and his little red van endorsed
Royal Mail in gold lettering. Then I heard myself say in my mind: This will
all be gone soon, destroyed because it is wrong. The thought came from no
where, but it was one of extraordinary power, for where there were
buildings I could see open grassland and trees. All things are set within the
circle; there is nothing new under the sun.
The narrative of The Little Prince begins with the author's story of his
experience as a child when he commenced his first ventures into art. The
grown-ups seemed unable to understand his pictures: for example a
drawing of a boa constrictor after it had swallowed an elephant appeared to
them as a hat. So he set aside his sketches and never again discussed
important things with grown-ups. He simply indulged them in their concern
with things such as neckties, politics and other such matters of
consequence. He noted with considerable sadness, as have many of us, that
grown-ups will speak of houses and their monetary value but never mention
the roughness of the stones or even the flowers that grow in the garden.
Their concept of beauty lies in material values. Such people, the author
says, are to be avoided.
This beautiful little golden-haired boy was very wise, and those who
loved him came to know wisdom. In his short time on earth he made a
friend of a fox, who told him that his love for his new companion would be
as though the sun had come down to shine on his life. Having tamed the
rose, he tamed the fox, knowing full well that if you tame someone you are
responsible for them.
Back on asteroid B-612 the little prince loved to watch sunsets. His
world being so small, he could observe them for long periods; he had only
to move his chair occasionally.



414 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
It is noteworthy that the first astronomer to register the asteroid that the
little prince called his home was Turkish. Reporting his find to a world
congress, he appeared before the august gathering dressed in traditional
costume. His discovery of asteroid B-612 was not accepted. Then there
was a coup in Turkey, and the new dictator promulgated a law requiring
that any person going overseas on official business must wear western
dress. The man presented his findings to the astronomers' congress again
the following year, dressed as his ruler stipulated, and received great
plaudits for the discovery. This is so very typical of grown-ups.
It is believed that the little prince made the journey to earth by taking
advantage of the flight of a flock of wild birds. I personally believe that
these were flamingos, for I have seen them in flight and only they would be
a fitting escort for the little golden-haired prince who came to earth to find
a friend. The means by which he took his journey home again was to
receive the bite of the golden serpent. Nostradamus says the Teacher was
shot in a golden cage, which amounts to the same thing really.
Had it not been for Antoine De Saint-Exupery, I would never have made
the acquaintance of this wise little man who knew well how dangerous
baobabs can be if you do not root them out when they are small. I have
since been very careful to take this advice. Children, watch out for the
baobabs: they will grow so big that they will shatter your world.
My first meeting with this precious little man was many, many years
ago, and I have not seen him since. Sometimes in the early hours, when
writing becomes a very lonely business, I step out into the warm night air
of the back yard of my home in Fremantle. Occasionally I am drawn by the
sound of a galah, whose mirth betrays the knowledge of a secret the grown
ups would never understand. From time to time I walk to the beach and
stand upon the ramparts of an old fortress prison listening to the sea as it
whispers to the sand in the dead of night: secrets, profound secrets of the
deep.
On such occasions I look up into the perpetually clear night sky spread
over the city and the ocean, so close one might walk through it into the
vault of heaven. Looking up, I am ever hopeful that I might catch a glimpse
of the little prince's secret star, that stone in heaven that is his home. I have
yet to find it, but when I leave I always wave. I know my little friend has
not forgotten that when you tame someone you are responsible for them.



MATTERS OF INTEREST AND OF CONSEQUENCE 415
On such nights, when the spirit will not be stilled, when there is a
yearning for something intangible, only just out of reach, I ponder a
mystery I shall never resolve. Thanks to my encounter with the little prince,
I know that I am truly a man, and as a real man I shall never set aside
childish things. But my rational mind forever asks the question: By what
means did my little golden-haired friend reveal to me the mystery of the
stone in the tree? Surely I would have remembered his telling me about his
rose who was born at the same time as the sun.
Or is it that such great truths are seeds planted in the heart? Antoine met
the little prince when his aeroplane crashed in the Sahara Desert. He was
short of water and very concerned with matters of consequence; he had no
time for being a friend. Later this little man, who would never let go of a
question, gave him the water of life.
As I walk at the edge of the sea, on one side is the great expanse of the
Indian Ocean and on the other the expanse of the Australian desert. How is
it that this little man moistened my parched lips with aqua vita from
heaven? Did he come to me when I lay close to death in the sand, or is all
life an illusion?
But I cannot doubt my own conviction that the little prince was a real
person, that he is not a stretch of my imagination. As Antoine points out,
the proof that he existed is that he was charming, that his laughter was like
a peal of bells and that he was seeking a friend. If anyone is looking for a
friend, that is proof enough that he is a real person.
My nocturnal perambulations are probably my busiest times: so much is
happening; so much data has to be processed. I find myself at Fishing Boat
Harbour, where the lights on the little boats make it appear as though the
stars have come down from heaven. I think of the little prince and wonder
about a man called the Star of Bethlehem and how he will lead the wise
men to the birth of a miraculous child who will save our world from
sorrow: the son of the sun, the child of Gaia. Sometimes I think that Gaia is
not separate from us; we are an intrinsic part of her. It is we that will give
him birth and life. It also seems to me that man is not killing his mother.
That's impossible. He is committing suicide. Is this why Gaia and the sun
will send us a Saviour, a star-born man? Perhaps each of us is a
microcosmic Mandelbrot set made in the image of a vast Mandelbrot
universe. Numbers are its composition; there is order within and chaos
surrounds it. But even this does not resolve



416 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
the question that has been posed, one which only the reader is qualified to
answer.
If the sum total of The Thirteenth Stone comprises a few lines of verse
inspired by a children's book and all the rest is commentary, is this volume,
then, an inspired truth or a remarkable fiction?
It may well be the case that at this point your response to all that I have
told you is 'So what!' If so then the task left to me now is to try to
demonstrate that the contents of this book are neither academic nor flights
of fancy. I need to convince you that they point to imminent life
threatening situations. In so doing, I shall leave myself open to criticism as
to my motives; hence the above brief confession. That I should be criticized
is a matter of complete indifference to me, but that which follows could
well devalue my perceived motives and my subsequent arguments in your
view. I simply say that I am drawing your attention to the baobabs.
The game modern man has been playing has pretty well come to an end.
More realistically, we are simply at the end of one of the great cycles of
time. That which must be, will be; the prophecy will be fulfilled come hell
or high water. We need not debate this; you must see it as well as I do. But
I do not believe for a moment that we are all doomed. On the contrary, for
many of us it is a new beginning. Accordingly, I address myself solely to
those with eyes to see and ears to hear; I am otherwise deaf, dumb, blind
and utterly indifferent.
Those believing themselves to have saviours other than pure truth are, to
my mind, a lost cause. Simply look at the incredible things they believe,
then show me the man who can help them. They have, in fact, become the
oppressors of those who would choose reason. Further, it would be foolish
to presume them hapless innocents when, in reality, they are dangerous and
vicious beasts of substantial cunning. What they have done, are doing and
hope to achieve is demonic and unforgivable. It began a long time ago and
is now coming to completion. The objective is power and total dominance
effected by global control of the financial system. Money is the sole and
simple means by which everyone and everything can be controlled; religion
cannot compete here. As early as 1790 Mayer Amchel Rothschild, history's
greatest banker, said: 'Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation
and I shall not care who makes its laws.'
After investigating not only prophetic literature but also many major
myth cycles I have arrived at a very definite scenario. I should



MATTERS OF INTEREST AND OF CONSEQUENCE 417
also point out that, as of this moment, most of the pegs of these events are
already in place. It is too late to turn back. The basic outline I perceive is as
follows:
1. The international monetary system will be purposely collapsed.
2. The Temple will be built in Jerusalem.
3. After allowing sufficient time for everyone to experience the horrors of
such chaos, a man will declare himself able to solve the world's
problems.
4. One of the measures he will introduce, as part of a new economic order,
is a cashless monetary system of international credits which will be
electronically transferred.
5. The benefits of such a system will be manifold. Obvious examples are
that much crime will cease overnight and destabilizing international
speculation will end. But the disadvantage is that it will concentrate total
global power in one set of hands.
6. After three and a half years those hands will prove to be those of the
most evil man who ever lived. His lust for power over your life will
cause you to experience horror and pain that you cannot now imagine.
His reign of terror will be short, but his destruction will bring about the
end of the world as we know it.
7. Pivotal to this scenario is that this world leader, who is himself a Jew,
will, in the process of gaining dominance, call upon the loyalty of world
Jewry, which will place its financial power under his control.
I arrive at these conclusions on the basis of my understanding of
prophecy and the present political and economic global situation. Our
major problem is the perennial cry 'Anti-Semitism!'
In order to begin without hesitation and fear of wrongful accusation I
need to specify who and what I am speaking of, and why I am doing so. We
may then proceed in the full knowledge that unreasoned attack will be seen
for exactly what it is: an insistence upon the reality of the king's magic
clothes. The truth, whatever it may be, is eternal and unchanging like a
stone; lies will simply dissolve in its presence. They, in their defence, will
invariably call clamour and vociferous abuse to their aid. The outcome of
this battle is a foregone conclusion: the essence is not the war, it is the
choosing of sides.
The vast majority of Jews are not in any way involved in the matters of
which I speak; like the rest of humanity they are pawns



418 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
in the game. And the mongrel horde of which I speak has its fair share of
Gentiles, though, for reasons which will be explained, the Jews/Khazars
make up a disproportionate number of these locusts. This is not a them
and-us situation, in the sense of Jews as opposed to Gentiles. But I am
disadvantaged in presenting the argument clearly because, at the root of the
evil machinations of which I speak is Zionism, which is automatically
identified with Israel and the Jews. The fact is that everybody involved is
politically and philosophically sleeping around. You do not have to be a
Jew to be a Zionist, and there is no shortage of Jews who have spoken out
on the questions I raise. As a matter of fact it will be seen in the discussion
of the Holocaust that most of the evidence I am presenting is from Jewish
sources. It is the demons behind Zionism that have given these people a
bad name. They move silently and unseen in full knowledge of the
consequences of their actions, and human life holds absolutely no value for
them. They have taken control of the global economy and use both religion
and laudable political philosophy as a front.
These shadow men of the shadow lands, the Scribes and Pharisees of the
latter days, have one sole objective, which they are prepared to achieve at
any price. Money has nothing to do with it. Social justice is of no concern
to them, and their god is of very questionable parentage; these parasites are
diseased and corrupted by their lust for power. To actually confuse them
with ordinary everyday Jews or Gentiles (both meaningless terms in
themselves) is to elevate them to a status they could never achieve.
Now, such strong language requires justification. The example that
follows will both justify my remarks and demonstrate the power of these
people and their preparedness to use all means at their disposal. It is also
just a fraction of the evidence available.
The Institute for Historical Review is an American organization with no
religious or political affiliations. It recently published a paper, 'What is
"Holocaust Denial"?',43 reproduced in full below. It clearly demonstrates
that some Jews are questioning the veracity of many Holocaust claims and
shows how we have all been deceived with a specific objective in mind.
The notes to this paper are at the end of the chapter.
In recent years, more and more attention has been devoted to the supposed
danger of 'Holocaust denial.' Politicians, newspapers and television warn about
the growing influence of those who reject the



MATTERS OF INTEREST AND OF CONSEQUENCE 419
Holocaust story that some six million European Jews were systematically
exterminated during the Second World War, most of them in gas chambers.
In several countries, including Israel, France, Germany and Austria,
'Holocaust denial' is against the law, and 'deniers' have been punished with stiff
fines and prison sentences. Some frantic Jewish community leaders are calling
for similar government measures in North America against defiant
'revisionists.' In Canada, David Matas, Senior Counsel for the 'League for
Human Rights' of the Zionist B'nai B'rith organization, says:i
The Holocaust was the murder of six million Jews, including two million
children. Holocaust denial is a second murder of those same six million.
First their lives were extinguished; then their deaths. A person who denies
the Holocaust becomes part of the crime of the Holocaust itself.
Often overlooked in this controversy is the crucial question: Just what
constitutes 'Holocaust denial'?
Six Million?
Should someone be considered a 'Holocaust denier' because he does not
believe — as Matas and others insist — that six million Jews were killed
during World War II? This figure was cited by the International Military
Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1945-1946. It found that 'the policy pursued [by the
German government] resulted in the killing of six million Jews, of which four
million were killed in the extermination institutions.'ii
Yet if that is so, then several of the most prominent Holocaust historians
could be regarded as 'deniers.' Professor Raul Hilberg, author of the standard
reference work, The Destruction of the European Jews, does not accept that six
million Jews died. He puts the total of deaths (by all causes) at 5.1 million.
Gerald Reitlinger, author of The Final Solution, likewise did not accept the six
million figure. He estimated the figure of Jewish wartime dead might be as
high as 4.6 million, but admitted that this was conjectural due to a lack of
reliable information.
Human Soap?
Is someone a 'Holocaust denier' if he says that the Nazis didn't use Jewish fat
to make soap? After weighing all the evidence (including an actual bar of soap
supplied by the Soviets), the Nuremberg Tribunal declared in its Judgment that
'in some instances attempts



420 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
were made to utilize the fat from the bodies of the victims in the commercial
manufacture of soap.'iii
In 1990, though, Israel's official 'Yad Vashem' Holocaust memorial agency
'rewrote history' by admitting that the soap story was not true. 'Historians have
concluded that soap was not made from human fat. When so many people
deny the Holocaust ever happened, why give them something to use against
the truth?,' said Yad Vashem official Shmuel Krakowski.iv
Wannsee Conference?
Is someone a 'Holocaust denier' if he does not accept that the January 1942
'Wannsee conference' of German bureaucrats was held to set or coordinate a
program of systematic mass murder of Europe's Jews? If so, Israeli Holocaust
historian Yehuda Bauer must be wrong — and a 'Holocaust denier' — because
he recently declared: 'The public still repeats, time after time, the silly story
that at Wannsee the extermination of the Jews was arrived at.' In Bauer's
opinion, Wannsee was a meeting but 'hardly a conference' and 'little of what
was said there was executed in detail.'v
Extermination Policy?
Is someone a 'Holocaust denier' if he says that there was no order by Hitler
to exterminate Europe's Jews? There was a time when the answer would have
been Yes. Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg, for example, wrote in the 1961
edition of his study, The Destruction of the European Jews, that there were two
Hitler orders for the destruction of Europe's Jews: the first given in the spring
of 1941, and the second shortly thereafter. But Hilberg removed mention of
any such order from the revised, three-volume edition of his book published in
1985.vi As Holocaust historian Christopher Browning has noted/"
In the new edition, all references in the text to a Hitler decision or Hitler
order for the 'Final Solution' have been systematically excised. Buried at the
bottom of a single footnote stands the solitary reference: 'Chronology and
circumstances point to a Hitler decision before the summer ended.' In the
new edition, decisions were not made and orders were not given.
A lack of hard evidence for an extermination order by Hitler has contributed
to a controversy that divides Holocaust historians into 'intentionalists' and
'functionalists.' The former contend that there was a premeditated
extermination policy order by Hitler, while the



MATTERS OF INTEREST AND OF CONSEQUENCE 421
latter hold that Germany's wartime 'final solution' Jewish policy evolved at
lower levels in response to circumstances.
But the crucial point here is this: notwithstanding the capture of literally
tons of German documents after the war, no one can point to documentary
evidence of a wartime extermination order, plan or program. This was
admitted by Professor Hilberg during his testimony in the 1985 trial in Toronto
of German-Canadian publisher Ernst Zundel.viii
Auschwitz
So just what constitutes 'Holocaust denial'? Surely a claim that most
Auschwitz inmates died from disease and not systematic extermination in gas
chambers would be 'denial.' But perhaps not. Jewish historian Arno J. Mayer, a
Princeton University professor, wrote in his 1988 study Why Did the Heavens
Not Darken?: The 'Final Solution' in History: '...From 1942 to 1945, certainly
at Auschwitz, but probably overall, more Jews were killed by so-called
"natural" causes than by "unnatural" ones.'ix
Even estimates of the number of people who died at Auschwitz — allegedly
the main extermination center — are no longer clear cut. At the postwar
Nuremberg Tribunal, the Allies charged that the Germans exterminated four
million people at Auschwitz.x Until 1990, a memorial plaque at Auschwitz
read: 'Four Million People Suffered and Died Here at the Hands of the Nazi
Murderers Between the Years 1940 and 1945.'xi During a 1970 visit to the
camp, Pope John Paul II stood before this memorial and blessed the four
million victims.
Is it 'Holocaust denial' to dispute these four million deaths? Not today. In
July 1990, the Polish government's Auschwitz State Museum, along with
Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust center, conceded that the four million figure
was a gross exaggeration, and references to it were accordingly removed from
the Auschwitz monument. Israeli and Polish officials announced a tentative
revised toll of 1.1 million Auschwitz dead.xii In 1993, French Holocaust
researcher Jean-Claude Pressac, in a much-discussed book about Auschwitz,
estimated that altogether about 775,000 died there during the war years.xiii
Professor Mayer acknowledges that the question of how many really died in
Auschwitz remains open. In Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? he wrote (p.
366):



422 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
...Many questions remain open... All in all, how many bodies were
cremated in Auschwitz? How many died there all told? What was the
national, religious, and ethnic breakdown in this commonwealth of victims?
How many of them were condemned to die a 'natural' death and how many
were deliberately slaughtered? And what was the proportion of Jews among
those murdered in cold blood among these gassed? We have simply no
answers to these questions at this time.
Gas Chambers
What about denying the existence of extermination 'gas chambers'? Here
too, Mayer makes a startling statement (on page 362 of his book): 'Sources for
the study of the gas chambers are at once rare and unreliable.' While Mayer
believes that such chambers did exist at Auschwitz, he points out that
most of what is known is based on the depositions of Nazi officials and
executioners at postwar trials and on the memory of survivors and
bystanders. This testimony must be screened carefully, since it can be influ
enced by subjective factors of great complexity.
Hoss Testimony
One example of this might be the testimony of Rudolf Hoss, an SS officer
who served as commandant of Auschwitz. In its Judgment, the Nuremberg
International Military Tribunal quoted at length from his testimony to support
its findings of extermination.xiv
It is now well established that Hoss' crucial testimony, as well as his so
called 'confession' (which was also cited by the Nuremberg Tribunal), are not
only false, but were obtained by beating the former commandant nearly to
death.xv Hoss' wife and children were also threatened with death and
deportation to Siberia. In his statement — which would not be admissible
today in any United States court of law — Hoss claimed the existence of an
extermination camp called 'Wolzek.' In fact, no such camp ever existed. He
further claimed that during the time that he was commandant of Auschwitz,
two and a half million people were exterminated there, and that a further half
million died of disease.xvi Today no reputable historian upholds these figures.
Hoss was obviously willing to say anything, sign anything and do anything to
stop the torture, and to try to save himself and his family.
Forensic Investigations
In his 1988 book, Professor Mayer calls for 'excavations at the killing sites
and in their immediate environs' to determine more



MATTERS OF INTEREST AND OF CONSEQUENCE 423
about the gas chambers. In fact, such forensic studies have been made. The
first was conducted in 1988 by American execution equipment consultant,
Fred A. Leuchter, Jr. He carried out an on-site forensic examination of the
alleged gas chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek to determine if
they could have been used to kill people as claimed. After a careful study of
the alleged killing facilities, Leuchter concluded that the sites were not used,
and could not have been used, as homicidal gas chambers. Furthermore, an
analysis of samples taken by Leuchter from the walls and floors of the alleged
gas chambers showed either no or minuscule traces of cyanide compound,
from the active ingredient of Zyklon B, the pesticide allegedly used to murder
Jews at Auschwitz.
A confidential forensic examination (and subsequent report) commissioned
by the Auschwitz State Museum and conducted by Institute of Forensic
Research in Krakow has confirmed Leuchter's finding that minimal or no
traces of cyanide compound can be found in the sites alleged to have been gas
chambers.xvii
The significance of this is evident when the results of the forensic
examination of the alleged homicidal gas chambers are compared with the
results of the examination of the Auschwitz disinfestation facilities, where
Zyklon B was used to delouse mattresses and clothing. Whereas no or only
trace amounts of cyanide were found in the alleged homicidal gas chambers,
massive traces of cyanide were found in the walls and floor in the camp's
disinfestation delous-ing chambers.
Another forensic study has been carried out by German chemist Germar
Rudolf. On the basis of his on-site examination and analysis of samples, the
certified chemist and doctoral candidate concluded: 'For chemical-technical
reasons, the claimed mass gassings with hydrocyanic acid in the alleged 'gas
chambers' in Auschwitz did not take place... The supposed facilities for mass
killing in Auschwitz and Birkenau were not suitable for this purpose...'xviii
Finally, there is the study of Austrian engineer Walter Luftl, a respected
expert witness in numerous court cases, and former president of Austria's
professional association of engineers. In a 1992 report he called the alleged
mass extermination of Jews in gas chambers 'technically impossible.'xix
Discredited Perspective
So just what constitutes 'Holocaust denial'? Those who advocate criminal
persecution of 'Holocaust deniers' seem to be still living in



424 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
the world of 1946 where the Allied officials of the Nuremberg
Tribunal have just pronounced their verdict. But the Tribunal's
findings can no longer be assumed to be valid. Because it relied so
heavily on such untrustworthy evidence as the Hoss testimony, some
of its most critical findings are now discredited.
Be we Christian, Jew, Moslem or even atheist, sooner or later the Bible
will be seen to be at the root of conspiracies that even the most ardent of
such enthusiasts could never have imagined. The statistics are profuse and
confused, but there is a case for claiming that, when the final truth is
known, losses of life as a result of Allied reprisals against Germans after
peace had been declared will be seen to have exceeded the number of Jews
who died under Nazi occupation from all causes. Having the misfortune to
be in a war zone is invariably injurious to all forms of life.
In the early 1990s the Australian Government refused a visa application
by British historian David Irving, who, mysteriously, is considered a
prominent 'Holocaust denier'. Prolific though he may be, none of his books
deals with the Holocaust. The visa refusal went against Australian
traditions of freedom of speech, but objections to the visit by the Jewish
community, or a small section of it, were strong enough to persuade the
Government that it would be creating too much trouble for itself by
agreeing to the request. The point is not whether or not it was the 'right'
decision, but that a form of censorship was exercised. A similar exercise of
power ensures that rarely if ever does a mainstream newspaper publish
anything that could be construed as giving offence to Jews.
My wish here is to establish a fact, not to declare a judgement upon it.
Any group that had been vilified and scapegoated as much as Jewry would
be almost bound to set up this kind of defence. The reason for drawing
attention to it is simply to observe that media caution has led to your
relative unawareness of the power of Jewish cartels, and this must lead to a
distorted representation of the events I have said will soon unfold.
Merely to point out, in whatever context, that Jewish interests control the
bulk of the world's financial institutions would be virtually impossible for a
major media organization. Even I, as an unknown writer, have to brace
myself to say it. But say it I must if I am to be true to myself and to the very
serious messages for our generation that I have seen in prophecy.
How did the Jewish/Khazar dominance of world finance come



MATTERS OF INTEREST AND OF CONSEQUENCE 425
about? I have observed already that the Khazars always had a strong
aptitude for trade and financial dealing, but they also got a head start in the
world banking stakes through a circumstance that does no credit to another
major religious tradition — Christianity. The European countries of
Christendom would not permit their citizens to engage in usurious
occupations (that being against true religion), but were quite happy to be
served by Jewish moneylenders. Perhaps hypocrisy has never reached
greater heights. As the Jews were not permitted to own property, it was not
surprising that some of them took up the offer. If Western countries end up
suffering at the hands of powerful Jewish bankers, seen from one
perspective it will be a case of the chickens of Christendom coming home
to roost.
Naturally some of the moneylenders became skilled and wealthy bankers
long before Christians were allowed into the game. They were not
necessarily greedier than non-Jews who have acted as bankers, played the
stock market or found some other non-productive way of acquiring wealth.
The fact is that those of both religions who take usury — or who find other
means of profiting from mere financial transactions — are defying
Scripture. The instruction forbidding this is not an ancient irrelevance, and
by ignoring it we have made a bed we shall be bound to lie in.
The danger of so much power being in the hands of Jewish financiers is
that their loyalty will ultimately prove to lie elsewhere than with the
international community. It is necessary that you, the reader, understand
that my ability to convince you of the actuality of what I say is limited by
the fact that the media, as far as these matters are concerned, tells you
everything about nothing at all. Its primary concern is to divert your
attention, to amuse you like a child while the grown-ups shape your world.
The fact is that a disproportionate share of the West's media, which in view
of recent technological advances may be termed the global media, is in the
hands of these sectarians.
A predominant part of this media control is within the US, and it has, in
many respects, de facto disproportionate control of our globe. It should be
realized that the so-called 'quality' press is equally vulnerable, and may, on
the supposition that it is 'informed', be a major means by which we are
uninformed. The question arises: Cui bono? If someone has something to
gain he has something to hide; if he has something to hide it is only for
gain. The stakes at the international level of which I speak are large enough
to be



426 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
incomprehensible, and people wielding power at that level are most
unlikely to have difficulty with public relations; they have, in fact,
achieved their positions largely because of their grasp of the necessity of
image.
One point must be made clear. I do not suggest, and I have absolutely no
evidence of, some kind of conscious Zionist conspiracy. As already
mentioned, the cartels of which I speak have their share of Gentiles. The
problem lies in the predominance of Jews and the impending advent of a
Jewish Antichrist, who will have equal appeal for the materialistic atheist.
It should also be remembered that while, from time to time, the world
decides it has a Jewish problem, the Jews have always considered that it
has a Gentile problem.
The capitalist system of western Europe was one that suited the Khazars.
They thrived within it, and in doing so shaped it more and more to meet
their needs. The only thing that must concern us here is the coincidence of
a Jewish Antichrist — who will create order from chaos — and the massive
economic and political power of these people. This brings a new dimension
to the idea that none will buy or sell without the mark of the Beast. The
Khazars are simply another human tribe who, like the English for example,
have mindlessly exploited others. Like so many other nations that have rav
aged the gentle of spirit, they are the victims of their own bestiality. Only
he that is without sin can justifiably cast the first stone.
According to William of Malmesbury in Gesta Rerum Anglorum,
William the Conqueror brought the Khazars to England from Rouen after
the invasion of 1066. They were to be used as tax-gatherers and usurers, the
objective being to centralize power, but ultimately it was the kings
themselves who fell into the hands of the moneylenders. The crown
arranged that all property forfeited to them would be divided on a fifty-fifty
basis. By 1168 they had acquired a quarter of the nation's property and
wealth. At this point, the Church began a lament against this unfair
competition, which reached its crescendo in the synod of Exeter in 1287,
where rules were set down forbidding Christians to have community with
Jews. In 1290 King Richard I banished the bankers from Britain. But
ultimately they returned by financing revolution, as was the case with
Oliver Cromwell and Charles II. Historically speaking, their greatest asset
has been their persistence.
From England they were able to launch and establish themselves in
North America, which is where we begin to see that destiny knows these
children. As one burns endless midnight oil researching the



MATTERS OF INTEREST AND OF CONSEQUENCE 427
historical evidence, one is forced to a single conclusion. Just a mini-scule
error in the beginning is progressively compounded, leading to greater and
greater confusion, which is visited upon us later. Thus, with certainty, the
first dawn of creation wrote what the last day of reckoning will bring.
The original US constitution was a bar to the usurers, but the new
document of 1789 permitted the federal corporation. The fundamental
argument was over the question of sovereignty: did it rest in the
government or the people through that constitution? But the problems of
the international banking fraternity, who had earlier consisted of the less
respectable moneylenders, did not end here. They were vigorously resisted
by men like President Andrew Jackson. Unable to obtain admittance
through the front door, they decided on the tradesman's entrance. They
embroiled the United States in wars that drove the country into debt and
thereby acquired acceptance.
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States (FED) was created in
1913 by an act of Congress. It is totally privately owned, its initial purpose
being to keep the Government out of banking. The FED is the central
controlling bank of the world's most powerful nation, and is totally in the
hands of some three hundred individuals who own, among others, the
following international banking corporations:
* Rothschild of London * Lazard Brothers of Paris
and Berlin Speyers
* Israel Moses Sief of Italy * Warburg of Amsterdam Goldman,
Sacks and Hamburg Erlanger Kuhn Loeb
* Rockefeller Chase Fauld
Manhattan * Lehman Brothers of
Seligman New York
Major shareholders are marked with an asterisk.
These families not only hold the purse-strings of the richest and most
powerful nation on earth, their power stretches quite independently
throughout the nations of the world. If, as a body, they chose to collapse the
monetary system, as was the case in the 1920s, in order to bring in a
cashless society, they have the financial clout to do so. If they required the
US Senate, at economic and social cost to the people of the country, to give
Israel most



428 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
favoured trading nation status, the Senate would have no option but to
obey; and it did. Be they Khazar Jews or the Poor Sisters of Mary, such
immense power in so few hands is dangerous beyond words. These people
not only have power through their ownership of the FED; they also control
the US administration. Early in the life of the Clinton government, thirty
five of forty-eight top posts were held by Jews. With a Jewish population
of about 3.5 per cent, the US had a government that was more than 70 per
cent Jewish.
Cecil Rhodes dreamed of, then financed the foundations of, a world
government with Britain at the helm. At the turn of the century, when
Britain had begun to decline, this edifice was hijacked by the international
banking fraternity. (The problem with this material is that many aspects of
it merit a book in their own right.) Cecil Rhodes dreamed the ultimate
imperialism in a distorted Victorian world where the sun would never set
on the British Empire. In the midst of this glory, many sensitive and
intelligent men saw the depravity of it all when they moved among the
countless starving and homeless inhabitants of Victorian London — the
heart of the Empire. The socialism and concern of men ranging from Marx
to Dickens was a response to this inhumanity. It is noteworthy, and to the
credit of Jewry, that many of these social reform philosophers were Jews.
At some point the Fabians and the socialist movement adopted the global
dominion concept of Rhodes and his fellows, quite rightly seeing that the
one solution to injustice and inequality of opportunity was the institution of
a global socialist state. Here we have another example of the future casting
a shadow into the past. But this ideal dream would not work, quite simply
because it required a more sophisticated humanity. Later, on the principle
that the worse is wont to attack the better, the new imperialism (capitalism)
climbed into bed with the socialists. Very clearly, the Devil dealt these
cards. Thus, the most extreme and indefensible capitalist exploitation could
achieve its goals and at the same time be seen as altruism par excellence.
The international bankers perceived that the socialist movement could act
as a front and a fifth column which would, in achieving its ambitions,
actually achieve the objectives of the bankers, who held the purse strings
and financed revolution. Its bedfellows, with the aid of the world's most
powerful financial movers and shakers, would work feverishly for unity,
justice and equality. But they would labour in vain:



MATTERS OF INTEREST AND OF CONSEQUENCE 429
ultimately it would be seen that it was all taking place in an age when the
masculine was free to use and abuse the feminine.
The international banking community profited from World War I (as
became evident during the Versailles conference), it financed Lenin's rise
to power and, both directly and through the US, it propped up the USSR
throughout its history. In 1917 President Wilson gave the Russian
revolutionaries $325 million worth of credit. By the time Nixon became
president that debt had become $9.1 billion. He then wrote it off, and gave
the Soviet Union a further $2.5 billion in credit. How could this be if
Russia was America's sworn enemy? It was a long-standing joke among
Russians that their country's salvation lay in declaring war on the US at
midday and surrendering two minutes later.
Because the space does not exist to prove the argument, I am bound to
offer the following statement as mere conjecture. If the US and the West
gave massive economic support to the Soviet Union, which came into
existence with the aid of the international bankers, logically the USSR was
not the enemy of the West. You do not give economic support to someone
who has sworn to destroy you and is actively working to that end.
However, the existence of the Soviet enemy created public paranoia, which
then gave Western governments total popular support when they ran into
the arms of the moneylenders to pay for massive defence expenditure. That
is to say that the bankers created the Soviet Union as a means of conquering
the West through usury. Once the objective had been achieved, the USSR
was allowed to collapse into economic chaos. These same moneylenders
are now 'benevolently' solving the financial problems of the former
OZBLOC countries by putting them even further into the red.
These chosen few have long since broken through the threshold to
holding a mortgage on, and eventually foreclosing on, the entire world.
Benjamin Franklin once wisely said: 'He that goes a-borrowing goes a
sorrowing.'
In July 1944, these bankers met at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire and
subsequently formed the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
making them usurers to the entire globe. Since then, countless nations that
had been in surplus, or at any rate living within their means, have amassed
huge debts, which everyone knows they can never repay. In 1901 the US
national debt was below one billion dollars. By the time the country entered
World War I it had topped twenty-five billion, and it had risen to



430 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
forty-nine billion by 1941. By 1976 it was at six hundred and thirty-one
billion. This figure may now be counted as the stars of heaven. The degree
of debt in countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand in 1987
was such as to require 60 per cent of their exports to service it. It is
confusing, but a fact to consider, that, since there is no longer a gold
standard, money is no longer money and these debts are an illusion.
The interest paid on loans is an extra tax on individual and national
income. If, for example, you have a net salary of $600 and are paying
interest amounting to $250, your real net earnings are $350. In these
circumstances, many families with good salaries live below the poverty
line. The interest you pay is like a rental fee for the goods for which you
have borrowed. If you have a mortgage on your home you do not own the
house, the bank does; it's just another way of renting without really renting.
Under the US Law of Equity, citizens waive their constitutional rights
when they sign a bank contract; in law, the security or good is the property
of the lender. Ultimately, if you borrow enough you will lose everything to
the usurer. It is conjectural that, being set up under statute law, these
contracts may well be void under common law, which (in theory)
supersedes it.
War is a primitive means of conquest. Religion is a pernicious one. But
monetary indebtedness is conquest by stealth; it is the noose we put around
our own necks. A nation with a vigorous economy such as that of the USA
cannot lose that economic vigour overnight, as would happen in a great
depression. It simply rises to the invitation to overspend and later, at a
given point, interest payments outrun real earnings. Depression is the result
of that debt being called in — not necessarily because the debtor has
reneged but because the moneylender has come to collect his prize.
The FED is a real licence to print currency: it totally controls the money
supply. By restricting the availability of cash even the strongest economy
can be brought to a standstill. Unpurchasable goods pile up, unemployment
increases, businesses go bankrupt and the moneylender wins again. Modern
currency is not money in the historical sense: it is credit. The moneylender's
objective is the same as yours — ownership of property. Your means of
acquisition is your labour; the banker's means is also your labour. In all
events, if you overspend, reality must recover the added value you have
used before you created it. Here it will be clear that the borrower is of equal
guilt with the lender: lust creates a demand and



MATTERS OF INTEREST AND OF CONSEQUENCE 431
greed fills it. If one places a member in the lion's mouth, the animal is
bound to bite it off. That's what lions do.
Allow me at this point to make what you will almost certainly regard as
an absolutely ridiculous statement, but let me assure you that it is probably
the most undeniable fact in this entire book. Inflation has a single cause:
usury. Once upon a time, when societies used real money and forbade
usury, inflation was unheard of.
A banker produces nothing at all, but claims a substantial share of the
community's productivity. He thereby forces an increase of prices that is a
knee-jerk reaction to the need to pay him his share. Deflation occurs when
the banks restrict the money supply in order to counteract inflation. The net
result is that this becomes the means by which profit-taking by the bankers
is passed on to the most vulnerable in society. They lose their jobs or
businesses and then their possessions. The ridiculous point is that it is
totally unnecessary. The government, as an agent of the community, can
print its own money and lend it interest free. Economics is exactly like the
Bible: incomprehensible because, and only because, it was in someone
else's interest to make it that way. One really needs to be a shrewd
simpleton to understand it with relative ease. The US constitution
specifically says:
Congress shall have the Power to Coin Money and Regulate the Value
Thereof.
Conclusion
In this section I began — most reluctantly — by introducing personality and
personal experience into the text. It is my view that, in general, such an approach
does not do either book or writer any credit. However in this case it did make the
point that the unconscious mind is capable of tapping resources we cannot begin to
comprehend. Considering what was to follow, the approach also hopefully enabled
the reader to see a human personality, rather than an inhuman monster, behind the
sensitive material that was being introduced. I went on to make the following
points:
1. There was no shortage of Jews who suffered as a result of World War II;
nevertheless their suffering was shared by all parties involved, and was just
another point at which humanity as a whole bled in an age of cruelty.
2. The Holocaust is a vast exaggeration largely promoted by the USSR, the
international bankers and Zionism, which view nationalism as a threat to
internationalism.



432 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
3. In view of the evidence, the character of Nazi Germany deserves re-evaluation in
regard to precisely how cruel and insensitive the regime actually was. I suggest
they were no better and no worse than any dog in a scrap.
4. The present international level of usury is a recent phenomenon which is
inexorably leading the world towards unprecedented indebtedness, which the
largely Khazar/Jewish/Zionist international bankers will soon lay at the feet of a
Jewish Antichrist.
5. There is nothing that can be done at this late stage to alter the scenario. The
individual should prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Self-reliance is
vital. Education is the only salvation.
In regard to David Irving, it will be recalled that I drew attention to a mystery
surrounding his reputation as a Holocaust denier. Given that none of his books
mentions the subject, one must wonder how this came to be. This is not to claim
that he has not otherwise spoken on the matter.
Over a number of years Irving has gained himself an extraordinary and well
deserved reputation as one of the most competent, honest and rigorous historians of
modern times. His first crime is that he is, in the eyes of academia, an interloper. He
is not a member of the club. But his histories of Nazi Germany create a second
problem for him. In showing that the Germans were not totally black, nor the Allies
completely lily-white, he undermines the basis of the Holocaust story without
mentioning it.
As regards academia, Irving is facing a bunch of bullies defending their patch. In
the matter of the Holocaust, the answer is not so simple.
As has been seen, it is possible to make a god — an idol of the heart — of
anything and wrap a religion around it. It is clear from the irrational manner in
which all other holocausts are ignored, while that of the Jews is fanatically believed
in, that it has become yet another facet of Judaism. Someone like Irving thus
becomes a heretic, and his treatment is commensurate with that of any other
unbeliever at the hands of the mob.
It only remains for me to ask you, the reader, three questions:
1. Are you someone who believes David Irving to be a right-wing anti-Semitic
Holocaust denier?
2. If so, have you ever bothered to find out which, if any, of his books deal with this
subject?
3. If you are and have not, do you not feel a little ashamed at being part of a
senseless, howling mob?

Y Gwir Erbyn y Byd
It will be recalled that the FED was established in 1913, and that America's
debt problems began at that time. It is a private bank which lends the
American people their own money, at interest of course. It has also been
free to print currency according to its needs, which has resulted in
continual devaluation of the dollar.
Money is a simple and incredibly useful tool. It is a very convenient way
of expressing material wealth. Each time a good is produced or a resource
has value added to it, the nation's real wealth grows. As an expression of
this, the government may choose to increase the supply of bills or allow the
unit to rise in value. Money is not wealth: it is its expression and certificate,
which may be conveniently exchanged for production and services. A
nation's riches are its natural resources and its labour force. To add interest
to money is to place a demand upon a percentage of productivity and
thereby diminish the actual value of the currency and create unemployment.
This situation may be illustrated simply. If the government has a shortfall
of ten billion dollars it goes to the FED with the equivalent in interest
bearing bonds. This private bank called the Federal Reserve then takes the
bonds as security against a loan for this amount of the government's and
people's own money. Under US law, it is now free to use the bonds as
reserve to create as much as fifteen times their value in printed currency,
which it can, again, lend at interest, its only costs being the printing. This
makes a mockery of all business and enterprise. Even if you as an indi
vidual do not borrow, your labour is subject to a hidden tax because the real
value of your dollars is being whittled away by someone who is taking
income in very substantial amounts without creating it. In other words he is
acting exactly as do parasites or fleas on a dog. This theft then creates a de
facto pool of apparently non-productive workers — the unemployed.
Another practice of the owners of the FED has given them a substantial
stake in much of American industry. With their right to approve loans to
major corporations, they can, by refusing them, send the stock plummeting
in value and then purchase it and make the loan, which sends the stock up
again. But each time profit is taken without the creation of real assets. It is
an act of pirating the



Y GWIR ERBYN Y BYD 435
riches that others have created. Thus there cannot be at any given time
enough money in circulation for the nation to pay off the usurer.
Ultimately he must win and own all the country's property, vvhich he has
not created but taken by stealth.
In Billions for the Bankers,44 Sheldon Emry points out that in 1910 the
US federal debt was $12.40 per head of the population and by 1920, only
seven years after the creation of the FED, it had risen to $228 per head. We
should also take into account that this individual level of debt was
multiplied over an increased population. By 1950 the figure was $1575 per
capita. Thirty years later the figure was growing exponentially, and in 1981
had exceeded $1 trillion in federal debt. The grand total for all US debt was
$6 trillion, which was three times the value of all the land and buildings in
the country. As Emry puts it, if the people had handed over the entire
United States to the moneylenders, they would still have owed them two
more entire USAs — plus interest, of course. Since 1981 that situation, as
we all know, has deteriorated considerably.
Emry goes on to present the perfect analogy when he suggests an
imaginary poker or dice game at the casino. It demonstrates how the
receiver of interest will inexorably accrue the entire wealth of a nation. To
participate in the game one must buy chips from the banker, who proceeds
through the game by not risking any chips at all: he will invariably be able
to pay any winner from what he takes from the losers. We might assume
that he is withdrawing 15 per cent of the tokens every hour as his profit. As
the game proceeds, the number held by individual players will change
according to fortune, but the overall number being held at the table will
diminish by the said 15 per cent every hour. If the game is to continue, the
players must eventually borrow from the banker, who will require a
mortgage against their real property such as a house or car. While the
usurer is continuing to take his 15 per cent per hour, those who have
borrowed from him against their 'real' property must pay him regular
interest whether they are winning or losing. Otherwise, he will call in the
mortgage and confiscate their assets. The longer the game goes on, the
happier he is. The result is that, while the players are sitting at the table, the
moneylender is moving inexorably to the point where he has all the chips
back in his hands plus the money originally paid for them — and probably
even the shirts from the players' backs as well.
In the game nobody is obliged to go into debt. In the real world you
begin in this fashion. Even the individuals who do not personally



436 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
borrow are part of the game because the government and the municipalities
are borrowing and spending in their name and upon their property.
Earnings are then confiscated in the form of taxes, rates and numerous
other charges which are used to keep the usurer from the door. This
depresses the amount of real wealth that may be traded, and the first result
is unemployment. This begins the downward spiral that leads to the usurer
calling in the mortgages. Emry concludes by saying that the only escape is
death, but the debt then passes on to our children. If we cannot pay, the
bailiff and the police will come and confiscate our property and give it to
the moneylender. The game is rigged: you simply cannot win until you
dispense with the usurer, who by lending money is forcing up prices and
thus making everyone beg at his door. Put in the simplest terms, if you
allow someone to continually take a percentage of what you own, you will
eventually own nothing.
Unemployment is yet another social disease created by usury. It is
tantamount to a society saying that it does not have the resources to feed all
its members. This, particularly in a diverse modern economy, is absolutely
ridiculous, especially when that community pays welfare to the
unemployed by placing yet another levy on those who do have work. A
society has unemployment solely because industry and government cannot
afford the interest payments or cannot secure the loans to generate the
required industry. Interestingly, families that once maintained a given stan
dard of living with one breadwinner now require two to maintain a similar
standard. In effect, people are having to work harder for the same income.
The extra real wealth is being used by the individual and the government to
pay the banker. Those people with two family incomes are not depriving
the unemployed of work, they are struggling to support them. If anything,
usury has been the driving force behind the quest for efficiency, innovation
and technological development as a means of running faster to keep the
wolf from the door. But if the problem is so simple, why haven't
governments resolved it?
Usury on its present scale is a relatively recent phenomenon. It was once
forbidden in Christian countries because it contravened biblical law. It has
now spread throughout society like a cancer, and no government has the
power to stop it. To try to do so would be suicide. It would have to secretly
print new money, arrange a takeover of all the banks, strip them of their
assets and declare a moratorium on all debt. Were this even remotely
possible, the



Y GWIR ERBYN Y BYD 437
international bankers would forbid other countries from trading with the
renegade. And very likely they would demand that the US send in troops to
oust the government and re-install democracy.
Prior to the collapse of the German economy and the rise of the Nazis,
the price of the mark was set by the banking system. World War I
reparations were largely responsible for the country's subsequent massive
inflation. Under Hitler, the economist Dr Hjalmar Schacht took control,
setting the rate of exchange for the mark and forcing the banks to comply.
The bankers were furious, but inflation ceased overnight. These events in
Germany must be taken into account when we ask why the world went to
war in 1939. It is why, as Nostradamus puts it, the Germans became 'beasts
wild with hunger'. But it is a fact that in just a few years the nation's
economy went from total bankruptcy to boom as a result of the expulsion
of the usurers and the commencement of interest-free lending by the
government.
It also seems that a similar scenario was at the back of the Gulf War. Iraq
probably invaded Kuwait because, under pressure from the US, Kuwait
reneged on a joint Arab agreement to raise the price of oil, which would
have enabled them to pay off their debts. The US was then free to punish
Saddam Hussein for his blasphemy: he had outlawed usury and property
speculation in Iraq a short time previously. Anciently, part of this country
was Babylonia, and so it was that the Whore of Babylon brought home her
wrath like a desert storm. The circle is completed, and things are never
quite what they seem.
Perhaps the coming Antichrist will solve the world's economic ills by
making money available interest free, but he will certainly not return what
the usurers have taken from you.
This raises an all-important question, which may be answered with a
'let's pretend'.
Let's pretend that we live in a society — perhaps on another planet
where the concept of usury, banking and speculation upon homes and
money as tradable commodities is simply unknown. Without a house as a
fundamental human right for each individual or family, a community
cannot exist. In our ideal society, when a couple decide to marry they have
automatic right to a permanent peppercorn lease upon a piece of local land.
If they are country folk they are entitled to, say, a minimum of five acres. If
they are city dwellers they receive at least one-eighth of an acre. This
immediately takes the inflated land cost out of the price of the



438 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
residence. In this ideal world, the right to work is another fundamental
which today is being taken away by the usurer. To deprive a man of this
dignity is tantamount to denying him and his family the right to live. But in
our perfect world young people are encouraged to work and save for their
wants and needs. At the wedding feast the guests and families bring
presents that might range from the proverbial toaster to gifts of money and
even labour to help build their home.
Setting aside the material advantages, the social and spiritual gains in this
community are enormous. Now, without interest on loan money to inflate
the prices of concrete, bricks, plumbing, roofing etc., and given that it is a
community standard to aid the couple to build quickly, the price is
relatively small. And even if all this were not enough, they can go to the
government and obtain an interest-free loan. This society sets a non
tradable value on its homes and grades them according to their degree of
improvement and added value; this does not encourage speculation, but
simply seeks to compensate in relativity. Should the need arise for a city
dweller to move to the country and a country-dweller to move to town, they
exchange properties with some small compensation for added value in one
of the dwellings. Without the usurer to claim larger and larger amounts of
the average person's income, the number of hours worked to support a
family is radically reduced. In such circumstances, the labour required for
public projects can be acquired on a community service basis. The
materials are purchased from a tax which — because there are no usurers to
pay — is a fraction of those we pay today. These never need exceed 10 per
cent of income.
The fundamental principle behind the thinking here is that it is both
destructive and ridiculous, if not evil and pernicious, to speculate upon a
basic human right such as a place to live or to jeopardize the right to work.
A creature who believes that the sole object and purpose of his life is the
acquisition of more petty property than his neighbour is not above but
below the beasts of the field, who never take more than they need for quiet
enjoyment of life. Speculation of any kind with a view to gain — that is, the
seeking of profit beyond the rewards of labour — is a manifestation of
bestial greed. It is an expression of present humanity's primitive nature,
which will not be found in tomorrow's civilized human beings. It is without
spirituality; it destroys community and sets us at each other's throats. It
cannot continue indefinitely.



Y GWIR ERBYN Y BYD 439
Development of resources and human skills is a means by which life can
be enriched, but it must be done with spirituality, with a view to the overall
benefit of the community. Exploitation for sheer bloody-minded gain based
upon utter indifference to others is that for which much of mankind will be
destroyed. Quite simply, they cannot rise above their materialistic
bestiality. As such they are like ravenous beasts who are a threat to
civilized human society. They totally lack the civilizing, spiritualizing
feminine 1080 and express themselves with the burning and uncaring
mindlessness of 666.
As an aside, we may see here that, contrary to popular belief, we have
now an example of how at least one of the biblical laws — that forbidding
usury — is not archaic but relevant, even indispensable, to civilized and
decent society.
As has been said, had not the US and the West, at the behest of the
international bankers, propped up the Soviet Union, it would have collapsed
decades ago. Thus it could not have been used as a threat which drove the
West into debt to pay for armaments and numerous wars. Ironically, the
international banking fraternity being largely of Khazar origin, and they
essentially Russian, the Soviet Union ultimately conquered America and
the West without a shot being fired.
Daniel tells us to let the righteous be righteous still and the filthy filthy
still. These things will quickly pass away; what remains is the final battle,
which you must fight within yourself. At some time you must decide upon
your purpose. The Light is returning; only those that do not perceive it are
lost. Victory is inevitable and doubt is of the Dark. We are only at the
beginning, at the awakening, the gathering and the swarming. By our will
we shall make it be and by our petitions God will teach us to love truth and
bear its pain.
A book of this nature is likely to be read by many and understood only
by a few. This has absolutely nothing to do with intelligence; it simply
requires a gentle but strong spirit. The weak will be frightened, appalled
and confused. This is the meaning of Daniel 12: 9-10.
The more certain we are of the past the more assured we shall be of the
future. The deeper and stronger the roots, the more profuse and bounteous
the branches. We have lived with error, now compounded to near disaster.
Man cannot engage in war with the gods and expect even the remotest
chance of victory. He cannot indulge in the worship of idols and not expect,
sooner or later, to see them



440 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
shattered at his feet. Nor can man dispense with his need for belief or
overlook his total dependence upon the Most High.
From a sociological and psychological point of view there is no
difference between a state that reveres Jesus and one that idolizes
Grandfather Lenin. And in the final analysis, whatever the state religion
may be, it is an intrinsic aspect of the social order. Thus, even in a devoutly
atheistic system such as Communism, politics and faith cannot be
separated. And this is the case even if the national god is mystical and to be
worshipped in groves. Man cannot escape belief; it is woven into his
nature. In a very primitive society this god becomes the tribal totem. It may
be found in the regimental banner or in the colours of a soccer team. This
deity becomes a manifest idol of the heart, a possession that possesses.
One finds belief invested in socially dangerous and psychologically
harmful forms at all levels of the social pyramid. Every time Rome
endeavoured to raise its banners and standards in Jerusalem and Judea, the
priests whipped up the crowds; on one occasion at least, the Romans were
threatened with mass suicides. This may be perceived not so much as
religious fanaticism but as a recognition of the psychological dangers and
long-term social disruption inherent in what I shall for simplicity's sake call
false gods. The great rallies of the Nazis in Germany immediately spring to
mind.
This particular phenomenon of human nature is one that plagues us all.
The idea is to keep it under strict control, precisely in the same way that we
would endeavour to confine criminals and other sources of social
disruption. The point is that the evil we see in others also exists within
ourselves. Without the exercise of severe restraint, as much within as
without, both we as individuals and society as a whole can only face
increasing degradation. The significant point is that divine law, as it is
received in Scripture, is there for our benefit. Through it, we cooperate with
the Creator to make a better world for ourselves. God does not have a need
to be worshipped; it is we who need to bend the knee.
The ideal form of organization in modern society is democracy. It is said
that, by giving the vote to absolutely everyone over the age of eighteen
years, the system will be fair. It is also said that the road to hell is paved
with good intentions. That something is nice, fair or even perceived to be
socially just does not mean that it is in the long-term good. And besides,
what is perceived can depend very much on who perceives it.
Democracy, like everything else, has two possible outcomes. If,



Y GWIR ERBYN Y BYD 441
for example, the money that the West has spent in the last forty years on
so-called defence had been expended on education, and if television and
computers had been used for education rather than as toys for the masses, it
is likely that we might now be in a position to install some form of limited
democracy. We might note that the ancestors of most of Europe's refined
and educated aristocracy were originally raping, pillaging, murderous
warmongers who outran the competition. Over the centuries, education will
have given some of them a right to govern a democracy. But even then we
should be concerned for our safety. Nothing corrupts like power.
The level of stability within a society that practises democracy through
universal suffrage must be directly reflected in its amount of investment in
education. Any community practising this philosophy must eventually sink
or rise, to be in tandem with the degree of education of the greater number.
Its political administrators, its respect for law and order, the manner in
which it treats its disadvantaged or otherwise disenfranchised members,
will be a reflection of the values of the majority.
Within this system, logically, it is the majority who rule. If they are
largely uneducated and have been encouraged to be self-indulgent, then,
despite any shout of 'Unfair!', that society will collapse into anarchy. Law
and order will break down. The system will try to appease the law-breakers.
The liberal elements may likely suggest that prisons create more criminals
than they deter. Those at the bottom of the social pyramid will spot the
lessening restraints, the economy will deteriorate, crime will increase, and
thus we would have a situation exactly like that in many Western countries
today.
Usually, in this cycle, when the situation has deteriorated sufficiently,
there is some kind of right-wing or extremist military crackdown. Under
such a fascistic regime, the community is likely to become involved in war
with its neighbours, which leads to destruction and loss of life, which in
turn regenerates the economy and the pitiful cycle begins again. Ten years
after the stock market collapse in 1929 the world was at war. The market
collapsed in 1987 and Nostradamus tells us the world will be at war in
1999.
The major players in this pyramidal structure, of which the cycles seem
to comprise periods of approximately seventy years, are as follows. The
base of the structure is made up of a group we may term the 'proletariat'.
Above them we find the 'military' and above them the 'traders'. Then
follows the 'intelligentsia', and at the top is the 'aristocracy'. These levels
are not clear-cut: they mix



442 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
and mingle at the edges. A state does not need to have a king or queen in
order to have a ruling elite.
It seems that, within a democracy, each class takes its turn at dominance
during these seventy-year cycles. The speed at which any class may
deteriorate and be superseded increases as the cycle works its way down to
the bottom of the pyramid. The ideal is to arrest it with an honest,
accountable and socially responsible aristocracy in control. In this manner
the entire organism is made strong. There then exists an unbroken chain of
command and the enforcement of order. In theory, the entire community
gains peace and prosperity from the stability of the social structure. But, as
has often been proved the case, royalty is just as corruptible as the pro
letariat; it is only more cunning and has more genius for grasping and
holding power.
In this idealization money, or whatever is the means of transacting added
value, flows freely like blood throughout the system, primarily because
acquisitiveness and acquisitors are outlawed. To repeat, the only cause of
inflation and depression is the acquisition in vast quantities of the
community's stores of added value by a small number of people who thus
restrain the flow of economic blood and starve the pyramid most severely at
its base, which is where the cycle of deterioration begins. In the 'religious'
sense we may say that an acquisitor has made false gods of his wealth: he
has raised an image of gold. That he may rot his own soul is his private
affair. Democracy should at least be extended to allow a man to choose his
place of residence in the hereafter.
Contrary to popular belief, low inflation within the present system is no
cause for celebration. It only indicates low demand for money and
subsequently depressed activity, this being a time of recovery from earlier
inflationary exploitation. High inflation represents profiteering on the part
of the moneylenders in a buoyant economy. Even with low figures, interest
rates are commonly relatively high. And with an economy in a depressed
state, this money must still come from somewhere. It it stolen, directly or
indirectly, out of everyone's pocket — when they can least afford it.
Our economic system has been sick for a long time, and at present the
banks are kicking it to death. Its total collapse is absolutely inevitable and
cannot be that far away. This is bound to create a massive public demand
for a new economic order, and it will be met by those who seek to establish
a one-world government that will put global economic power into a few
hands. The simple and



Y GWIR ERBYN Y BYD 443
deeply regrettable truth is that a cashless society would solve countless
economic, social, legal, criminal and taxation problems. However,
whoever controls such a system would have absolute power over every
individual within it.
The adding of interest to money increases the price of a good from
production through to its retailing. The standard house with an average
mortgage can ultimately cost three or four times its original retail price,
which is, itself, inflated by the availability of loans. Interest is not paid to
protect the lender against inflation: it causes it. The result is that the rich
get richer and the poor poorer. Money paid in interest would otherwise, as
disposable income, create employment and generate economic growth. The
extremely rich do not borrow for their basic needs, but they do set the price
for the needs of the less well off; they also then set the cost at which they
will lend for the fulfilment of these needs. Interest rates are driven solely
by demand.
Psychologically speaking, the wealthy exploiter is only expressing his
religious needs. He is simply and honestly acquiring and adoring the
common god. Sociologically, he proves to be a dangerous pest who
ultimately brings down his own and everybody else's house around his ears.
In a major economic depression, the poor get poorer because, and only
because, the rich are getting richer. A society's store of added value is very
rarely subject to the kind of change that may cause sudden economic
decline. Our acquisitor has simply found a way of pilfering the idols which
that tribe worships and stores in its temples. In this case the temples are
banks. Put another way, the object of the game of Monopoly is that one
player should bankrupt the others. Often one may see among young
children an individual who may not otherwise be very bright, yet he or she
will invariably win because of powerful acquisitiveness driven by primitive
greed.
There is no reason why a game of Monopoly should not continue
indefinitely with the redistribution of wealth every fifty years. In the real
social game, 'losing' is often expressed in homelessness, starvation, crime,
social breakdown and eventually war. Thus, to term someone who acquires
more wealth than he will ever need a social pest or idolater amounts to the
same thing, and indeed is an understatement. A society will never rid itself
of the economic disruption caused by acquisitiveness while it holds gold as
its god, because then the acquisitor is the unassailable priest. If one respects
wealth one must accept the crimes of the wealthy.



444 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
In a spiritual sense, the admonition not to worship false gods is
humanitarian rather than religious. The adoration of idols — even those of
the heart — does not affect God beyond His having to observe the ensuing
chaos and destruction.
To hold the above to be an accurate assessment one cannot adhere to a
particular political or religious viewpoint. Such standpoints, based upon
emotionally driven preconceptions, blind us to reality and so to danger.
What is appropriate is an honest individual or group attempt to find and
acknowledge what is true in relation to the nature of social structure, that is,
the acknowledgement and acceptance of sometimes harsh realities. Nature
will invariably impose upon man that which he fails to take into account in
the ordering of his life.
The cycle of seventy years works within larger ones which in turn do the
same. At some stage, if geared negatively, these phenomena can become
extremely destructive. The two central pillars of the state, the religious and
the secular, are at this point extremely corrupted. They will have
completely lost touch with those eternal truths that were their birthstone.
This process of decay may well begin in the smallest, even a quite
unnoticeable, way. Once the rot sets in, it becomes increasingly difficult to
eradicate. I speak here specifically of internal and unalterable natural laws
that have been transgressed. Our sole object, as a simple matter of survival,
must be to rediscover cosmic law and enshrine it within our own. We must
then learn to live in tune with it.
Fortunately our universe is a thinking universe invested with incalculable
intelligence. It has the power to renew itself, even in the most extreme
circumstances.
In a paper by Frithjof Schuon entitled 'No Activity Without Truth'45 he
says (pages 27-29):
In our time one has often heard it said that in order to fight against
materialism — or materialist pseudoidealism — a new ideology is needed, one
capable of standing up to all seduction and assaults. Now, the need for an
ideology or the wish to oppose one ideology to another is already an admission
of weakness, and anything undertaken on this basis is false and doomed to
defeat. What must be done is to oppose truth purely and simply to the false
ideologies, that same truth that has always been and that we could never invent
for the reason that it exists outside us and above us. The present-day world is
obsessed with 'dynamism', as if this constituted a 'categorical



Y GWIR ERBYN Y BYD 445
imperative' and a universal remedy and as if dynamism had any meaning or
positive efficacy outside truth.
No man in his senses can have the intention of merely substituting one error
for another, whether 'dynamic' or otherwise; before speaking of force and
effectiveness one must therefore speak of truth and nothing else. A truth is
powerful in such measure as we assimilate it; if the truth does not confer on us
the strength of which we stand in need, this only goes to prove that we have
not really grasped it. It is not for truth to be dynamic, but for ourselves to be
dynamic in function of a true conviction. That which is lacking in the present
world is a profound knowledge of the nature of things; the fundamental truths
are always there, but they do not impose themselves in actual practice because
they cannot impose themselves on those who are unwilling to accept them.
It is obvious that here we are concerned, not with the quite external data
with which experimental science can possibly provide us, but with realities
which that science does not and indeed cannot handle and which are
transmitted through quite a different channel, that of mythological and
metaphysical symbolism. The symbolical language of the great traditions of
mankind may indeed seem arduous and baffling to some minds, but it is
nevertheless perfectly intelligible in the light of the orthodox commentaries;
symbolism — this point must be stressed — is a real and rigorous science, and
nothing can be more naive than to suppose that its apparent naivety springs
from an immature and 'prelogical' mentality. This science, which can properly
be described as 'sacred', quite plainly does not have to adjust itself to the
modern experimental approach; the realm of revelation, of symbolism, of pure
and direct intellection, stands in fact above both the physical and the
psychological realms, and consequently it lies beyond the scope of so-called
scientific methods. If we feel we cannot accept the language of traditional
symbolism because to us it seems fanciful and arbitrary, this shows we have
not yet understood that language, and certainly not that we have advanced
beyond it.
Events that have occurred and do occur to shape man's destiny are never
miraculous. To the contrary, God, as Scripture informs us, never breaks his
own laws. He has no need to impress us, but wishes only to impress upon
us. The arrivals of the Teacher and the Sceptre are unlikely to be
miraculous events. If they are to succeed in the objective of separating the
wheat from the chaff, they



446 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
must appear quite mundane. They may well be cosmic, but in their initial
stages — at least — they will be seen as social and political events reported
in the media without any mention of the Liar, the Antichrist, the Star and
the Sceptre. In fact, if the prophecy is to be fulfilled, only a select few will
know that a particular public figure is Jesus the Teacher. Our religious
expectation of a coming 'Day of the Lord', filled with miracles, is an
imposition based on a misreading of the Bible. There will be no Hollywood
production; it will all be a progression of the present rapidly deteriorating
circumstances.
Once the Teacher has planted his eternal truths — once he has again
established the boundary — those who step within it may be termed
'Children of Light' while those who choose to ignore or defy it are
obviously 'Children of Darkness'. In either case the mechanism of the
universe rolls inexorably onward. The Children of Light are saved and the
Lot of Darkness destroyed. It is a simple matter of natural selection. It is
only we who contemplate the cosmic; the universe gets on with the
business at hand.
Whether one sees in past or future tense, the impression one gets when
looking at the Dead Sea writings is, as I have said, of an extremely severe
and austere community. Membership is not for the faint-hearted. Beginning
with the years of progressing by degrees, the apprentice owns nothing, not
even the clothes he wears. In any gathering he must acknowledge the
hierarchy and not talk out of turn. He must never speak ill of his brethren,
yet if he does not report even the most minor infringement he is deemed to
be equally guilty with the transgressor. Even pointing a finger when giving
a stranger directions is a punishable offence. The punishments range from
being fined one's meals for one or two days to death for the more serious
infringements. By this method the candidate, over a period of years,
subdues his will to that of God; he overcomes his own bestiality.
Once this process is complete he becomes an overseer of a district and
acts as shepherd to the populace, obviously loved, feared and respected. His
tasks include both religious and secular administration. As priest and
administrator he receives absolutely no pay. He is, in fact, forbidden to
handle money. Decisions beyond a certain level must be approved by the
community, which has a rigid pyramid-shaped hierarchy to which all have
access through the acquisition of knowledge. In such a system the eternal
truths are the framework of life and hang like a Damoclean sword over the
head of a potential backslider. The aristocracy, by their poverty



Y GWIR ERBYN Y BYD 447
and simplicity of lifestyle, are kept honest servants of the populace at large.
Freedom within the individual's limitations is the object; peace and justice
are the result. Facing the truth and reality that life on earth is filled with
multi-dimensional dangers is the first step. The mundane and the
miraculous are interwoven within the daily tapestry of life; that either one
should at any time superimpose itself upon the other is a delusory product
of the self will.
Obedience to laws that recognize and are designed for these realities is
the panacea for our ills. They have always been there, enshrined in sacred
writings; we have ignored them at our peril. The sole task of the Teacher is
to interpret and renew those edicts. In Matthew 4: 8-9 the Devil offers the
Sceptre all the kingdoms of the world, and he does so because they are his
to give at present. This is so because we have let go the law; chaos reigns
over a rapidly growing kingdom. Yes, these events are profoundly spiritual,
but they are also mundane and relate to the realities of life on earth, with
which we shall have to live until the end of time.
It is by these methods that mankind was once governed, and it is by these
same methods that, within the not-too-distant future, we shall be governed
again. Thus shall we be free of extreme poverty, corruption and war; thus
shall we beat our swords into plowshares and know the joy of living
without fear.
The entire matter before us is so obvious that it seems almost arrogant
and condescending to detail it. But it must be done.
Nature — and man is an intrinsic part of her — has used humanity for
her own ends. The exploiters have in fact been gathering the world's
material wealth while the rest of us have been encouraged to indulge in
excessive materialism. At some point in the near future, one of their
number will declare himself the king of the Jews and they will take their
spoils — the world's wealth — and place them at his feet. In the mean time,
a man will proclaim the wealth of the spirit as far greater than the riches of
the earth. The Jewish Antichrist will turn the screw and force a decision.
His appeal will be such as to tempt even the faithful. And then, when the
Beast has gathered those who love the smooth things above the harsh
reality of truth, God will have made the separation and will destroy them.
The only other scenario for the next fifty years is that there is no God and
that we are all going to meet an unspeakable and horrific end. This will not
be the work of the Devil as Christianity has created him: he is yet another
religious misappropriation. In Isaiah 45: 7 God is speaking:



448 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the
LORD do all these things.
There is absolutely no justification for religion of any kind; no
more so is there any excuse for ignorance of a scientific knowledge
of the absolute reality of a far distant and inscrutable God who is
ever present and constantly in conversation with all that was, is and
will be. For Him they are, and they are in Him as He is in them. God
is beyond and above all good and evil.
As one who by his findings in Scripture would have more justifi
cation than most in seeing a Godless end to a mindless humanity, I
must express surprise at myself and where I stand. For I see no end,
only a beginning carefully and lovingly crafted by the Master
Craftsman. Having cast aside the illusions, I believe I have seen the
footprints of the Creator in history.
Conclusion
The US Federal Reserve is a bank in private hands which lends the government and
the people their own money and charges them interest. Being privately owned, it is
subject to corrupt practice.
America's debt problems began with the FED, and her current economic
problems stem from exploitation by usury, a system under which the banker must
eventually own everything. He achieves this by lending a nothing. Unemployment
is directly linked to and occurs in strict proportion to the amount the usurer is
stealing from the economy.
The rise of Nazism in Germany was a direct result of moneylenders destroying
the economy with the intention of installing a Communist government. The great
crime for which the country eventually paid was that, with the banning of usury, the
economy boomed. This would have set a bad example to the rest of the world. My
proposal is that the unconscious motivation of the elite of the Khazar bankers is that
they must eventually hand over their economic power to an Israeli Antichrist who
will use this power for global control.
It is my hope that two points will stand out in the reader's mind: God creates the
Dark in order to sharpen the Light; and, despite the fact that we are dealing with so
called religious material, there are no miracles here — everything is and will be
occurring in the mundane world.
That none shall buy or sell without the mark of the Beast will not appear as a
fulfilment of John's Revelation — not, at least, until it is too late. Furthermore,
scriptural law forbids the marking or tattooing of the body.

The Crucifiction
At age 19 I had a much beloved Jewish girlfriend. On one occasion when
we met I saw a book protruding from her bag. It was The Diary of Anne
Frank. I was amazed at how much the photograph on the cover looked like
my companion, who was very petite and had a wonderful child-like
innocence that interfaced with what I would term a typically Jewish
wisdom and maturity. When, later, I read the book I was incensed at the
wickedness perpetrated against that child. Inasmuch as my friend looked so
much like that charming young Jewish girl, the book was, for me, that
much more poignant and real. Time and circumstance — the script
eventually separated us and, later, my conviction that I had stepped off the
intergal-actic bus at the wrong stop and my subsequently voracious appetite
for books taught me that The Diary of Anne Frank is pure fiction.
This I know: the truth is not simply for those on a spiritual path or Grail
Quest. It is also a very sound investment in the management of mundane
reality.
That which follows is reproduced courtesy of the Institute for Historical
Review, whose research and academic integrity are beyond reproach. It
confirms that mankind, as it is today (Jews, Gentiles and Uncle Tom
Cobley and all) is a lost cause.
Since their dispersion the Khazars have, through their intense
nationalism, survived in circumstances where others would have
disappeared. The claims made by Jewry of their suffering in Germany have
intensified and justified their own nationalism and elitism and made it
impossible for any European nation to express any positive community
pride without being accused of racism. If wars have winners, World War II
was won by a state that did not exist when it was fought: Israel. A
prominent Jewish writer once pointed out that hatred of his race is so
universal that it is only rational to presume that it is generated and caused
by the Jews themselves.
Racial characteristics are a reality and fact of life. What has not been
taken into account by those who have exploited the Holocaust lie is that
sooner or later it will be uncovered, as all falsehoods must, and then there
will be an intense expression of anger which will be aimed largely at
ordinary Jews — who have been duped as much as anyone else.



450 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
The Diary of Anne Frank was first published in 1952. As a paperback it
was reprinted over forty times; it was also a successful film. Otto Frank,
Anne's father, amassed a fortune from his daughter's suffering. The
contribution of emotional support to the Zionist cause that this book has
made is inestimable, but only seven years after its publication Frank faced
litigation in a New York Supreme Court. In 1959 the Swedish journal Fria
Ord established that the novelist Meyer Levin had written the dialogue and
was demanding payment, through a court action, from Otto Frank. A
condensed version of the Swedish article appeared in the American
Economic Council Letter of 15 April 1959:46
History has many examples of myths that live a longer and richer life than
truth, and may become more effective than truth.
The Western World has for some years been made aware of a Jewish girl
through the medium of what purports to be her personally written story, Anne
Frank's Diary. Any informed literary inspection of this book would have
shown it to have been impossible as the work of a teenager.
A noteworthy decision of the New York Supreme Court confirms this point
of view, in that the well known American Jewish writer, Meyer Levin, has
been awarded $50,000 to be paid to him by the father of Anne Frank as an
honorarium for Levin's work on the 'Anne Frank Diary'.
Mr Frank, in Switzerland, has promised to pay to his race kin, Meyer
Levin, not less than $50,000 because he had used the dialogue of Author
Levin just as it was and 'implanted' it in the diary as being his daughter's
intellectual work.
On 7 May 1962 the lawyer for Levin responded in part as follows:
I am afraid that the case itself is not officially reported, so far as the trial
itself, or even Judge Coleman's decision, is concerned. Certain procedural
matters were reported in 141 New York Supplement, Second Series 170, and
in 5 Second Series 181. The correct file number in the New York County
Clerk's office is 2241-1956 and the file is probably a large and full one...
One means by which the public row over copyright has been obscured is
the raising of the question as to whether the lawsuit was over the book, the
Broadway play or the script of the subsequent



THE CRUCIFICTION 451
film. Whether the dispute between Levin and Frank was over the diary
itself, the film or the play can be dismissed as a red herring. Resolving the
point decisively has not proved to be possible, but it must be said that the
film/play story is implausible.
Someone who owns the film rights to an immensely popular book does
not go about things by commissioning a script from a third party and then
trying to sell the whole package to a producer. The valuable property is the
rights; the producer will commission scriptwriters himself. The risk of
wasting money and time on the preparation of a script would be obvious to
any reasonably astute person, and Frank appears to have been a very clever
man.
It must be understood that the belief that the diary is fictitious predates,
and does not depend on, the litigation between Levin and Frank. But the
success of this lawsuit does place a substantial question mark over Frank's
integrity. The fundamental point is that the diary's context is grossly
contradictory and its content intellectually beyond the capability of a
thirteen-year-old girl living in 1942. An in-depth examination of the
context of the diary can be found in The Journal of Historical Review,47
volume 3, no. 2, 1982.
Dr Robert Faurisson was Professor of Document Appraisal at the
University of Lyons in France. After extensive interviews with Otto Frank
and others involved, and after a thorough investigation of the published
material — Frank would never allow public scrutiny of the original — he
concluded that the Anne Frank diary was a fraud. He points out that the
original 1947 Dutch edition did not catch on, and that the subsequent
German 'translation' is 'another book altogether'. There are, he says, even
two German editions that differ from each other.
It is clear that the Franks were never prisoners in their supposed hiding
place: even the diary admits that they had Jewish visitors who were living
normal lives during the occupation. The building was Frank's warehouse,
and it is most likely that he and his family moved there in order to protect
their goods against looters — wartime shortages made this a serious
problem. It may be conjectured that the Franks were arrested for no other
reason than suspicion of black marketeering.
The entire diary epic is such a botched job that it may be assumed that
Frank envisaged only a minor publishing scam. He could not have
anticipated its ultimate success once he got the formula right; if he had, he
would surely have been more careful than he was in perpetrating his
forgery.



452 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Plate 3
What remains a grim fact is that an innocent child was declared an
enemy of the state and died of typhus in Bergen-Belsen. Her death, like
countless others, was brought about by the actions of the Germans, the
Allies and the Jews. It remains only to ask whether, like her Christian
counterpart, she rose from the dead — and rewrote her diary.
Plate 4
Other evidence of forgery is more concrete.48 Plate 3 shows part of the
diary, supposedly written and signed by Anne Frank on 12 June 1942 (Otto
Frank produced a small section of the diary for a publicity photograph at
one point). An example of her known handwriting is shown in Plate 4. It
appears on the back of one of her photographs, and is dated 10 October
1942. It will be noted that the



THE CRUCIFICTION 453
adult handwriting of Plate 3 precedes the child's hand in the second sample
by about four months. It must be observed that the signature and date on
the photograph appear to have been added somewhat later than the
inscription. However, even if there was a considerable time lapse, and the
date is that at which the signature was added, the discrepancy is still
marked: the October one is clearly much less mature than the alleged June
signature.
Press stories of March 1995 announced the publication of the
'unexpurgated' version of the Anne Frank diaries. This volume brings Anne
into the 1990s, revealing her to be both sexual and feminist. Again, it is
very much to be doubted whether the ideas and thoughts expressed therein
could have come from a thirteen-year-old in the relatively conservative
world of 1942.
Originally the diary (singular) was found hidden in a school textbook
(singular) — also implying a small diary. This was published in its entirety
with the exception of 'a very few passages'. Later — after its success
Frank speaks of 'diaries' and also publishes a collection of Anne's short
stories. Some books are for writing and reading and some are for buying
and selling.
The True History of the Holocaust also names other now known
Holocaust forgeries and products of literary licence (pages 18-19):
Notes from the Warsaw Ghetto: The Journal of Emmanuel
Ringelblum. Five Chimneys ('24.000 corpses handled every day'),
Olga Lengyel. Doctor at Auschwitz, Miklos Nyiszli. This was
Auschwitz: The Story of a Murder Camp, Philip
Friedman. For Those I Loved, Martin Gray.
The history of the last two thousand years or so can be condensed as
follows: The wolves finally got the better of the old shepherds and since
then have been harassing and slaughtering the sheep at will. But attrition
has had a beneficial impact upon their evolution. One sheep has now given
birth to a cow, and she to a fierce bull. In the light of day, the bull has sired
a man-child upon her. This man will go forth and slaughter every wolf
without a remnant. Jewish or Gentile, a wolf is a wolf is a wolf. How else
can the sheep live in peace?
The history of World War II is much more complex, and cannot be told
without taking Communist Russia and her relationship to international
Zionism into account. It is an incredible coincidence



454 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
that by and large those German camps that fell within the area conquered
by the Western allies were seen, at the end of the war, to be precisely
internment camps where prisoners were treated with due respect. The 'death
camps', it transpires, were mostly in the area taken by Soviet Russia, which
afterwards produced endless anti-German propaganda detailing supposed
atrocities against Jews without any corroboration. During the occupation
many of these German 'criminals' became a sought-after prize and
subsequently the fathers of the American and Russian space programmes.
Both during and after the war the Vatican was supportive of the Nazis and
their regime, which opposed its Jewish competitors.
In the ensuing 'Cold War', nationalist America was as much at war with
Zionism as it was with Communism. The US lost that fight. It did not win
the Cold War when the USSR collapsed; the Soviet Union was left to
collapse when the US surrendered to Zionism and the bankers. If you or I
engaged in whoring and adultery on a scale comparable with these
monsters, who politically and philosophically sleep around, I do not doubt
that God or the Catholic Church would create Hell especially for us. I care
no more nor less for Germans than for Jews; in fact I have a longstanding
love of Russians, their history and their culture. But a questionable
Australian expression sums up the matter with pinpoint accuracy: Fair
bloody go mate. That, at least, is absolutely everyone's entitlement.
The rise of Nationalist Germany was a reaction against the cancer of
creeping Communist Zionism, which, it should be appreciated, was a
mighty wave striking the shores of human consciousness before World War
I. Its influence grew substantially throughout Europe, and Germany could
very easily have fallen to it. In using this term (Communist Zionism), it
should be realized that we face exactly the same problems as we did in
speaking of Christianity and Judaism. What we are dealing with is those
wolves in sheep's clothing. It is all a massive international government
sponsored whorehouse where it is impossible to separate the mensch from
the Goys. One can dismiss the Holocaust on the grounds of their moral
decrepitude alone.
Two points are generally overlooked in the historical considerations.
Firstly, the Jews and their Gentile associates had ravaged Germany
economically to the point where she was ripe for Communist takeover.
Hitler's nationalists stepped in and prevented



THE CRUCIFICTION 455
this by disempowering the Jews and the Communists and treating them as
enemies of the state. Both during and after the war, this made Germany the
enemy of both Jewry and Soviet Russia; she would be punished for
thwarting their goals. Secondly, near the end of the war it became
impossible for Germany to feed her own people, let alone continue to
supply the internment camps; added to which German and Red Cross food
convoys destined for the camps were bombed by the Allies. As a result,
starvation and disease became rife within them, and this devastation
largely created by the Allies — was later exploited by Zionism and then the
world as being proof of German bestiality.
Furthermore, the evidence is now gathering that the number of Gentile
Germans systematically killed by the Allies after the war's end was far
greater than the total of claimed Jewish deaths. An as yet to be published
book by the historian and writer James Bacque, Crimes and Mercies, states
that at least nine million Germans — mostly women and children — died
as a result of deliberate and coordinated Allied reprisals between 1945 and
1950.
The premature termination of a life is a terrible, terrible thing, in which
race and religion are irrelevant. The degree of sympathy the world will
bestow in the face of such events seems to depend entirely on the degree to
which those deaths are for buying and selling.
If one watches a film from the 1930s or 1940s one sees that change has
taken place beyond fashion, car design and architecture. When we 'play it
again' we become very aware that other eras had different values. In those
days, when finally caught, even the most hardened movie criminal would
throw up his hands and exclaim: 'It's a fair cop, Guv.'
Popular film and music, now as then, play a major role in setting
standards for the majority. But today there seem to be no standards at all.
An obvious example is the contrast between the gentle innocence of early
pop music idols like Buddy Holly and more recent noisicologists. It is not
that people were better in those days; it simply seems that the environment,
the atmosphere, the essence of time itself demanded a standard — a degree
of self-control. In hindsight, the sixties revolution, with its sex, drugs and
rock 'n' roll, was one in which the mind broke loose from old constraints.
This was not the birth of freedom but another anarchic step into slavery.
The shift is epitomised in Don McLean's 'American Pie', in which he
lamented the death of Buddy Holly and the 'time' of the American Dream
he symbolised. In a real sense this truly was the



456 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
day that the devil danced because the music had died. Yet there is
another way of looking at this.
The Hollywood film industry and, later, the recording industry
were great Technicolor dream machines largely created by Khazars
as money spinners to soak up the new-found wealth of the common
man. By the expedient of meeting public demand, pop music became a
major component part of social degradation, and the cinema quickly
became a highly efficient propaganda machine. Change is a constant.
In the last hundred years it has come about faster and faster. There
were no good old days, and there is nothing to preserve. The
destination is the thing. As we transit to this future point, all is
scenery captured in that time and space.
In the end the real problem is Western-style democracy: we quite
simply lack the maturity to deal with it. Ultimately every society is
faced with the choice between law and order and anarchy. It is a sad
fact that some are more capable of equality than are others. Indis
criminate equality thus becomes mob rule.
One of Hollywood's major creations has been the cruel, efficient,
heel-clicking, Jew-hating German. Likewise, Nazi propaganda por
trayed the grasping Jew. How simple life would be if the world
comprised nothing but stereotypes.
Many stories are now emerging from Germany that contradict the
popular images. It seems truth is made stranger by fiction. The
record tells a very strange story, as evidenced by this extensive
quotation from The True History of the Holocaust:49
GERMAN POLICY TOWARDS THE JEWS PRIOR TO THE WAR
Rightly or wrongly, the Germany of Adolf Hitler considered the Jews to be
a disloyal and avaricious element within the national community, as well as a
force of decadence in Germany's cultural life. This was held to be particularly
unhealthy since, during the Weimar period, the Jews had risen to a position of
remarkable strength and influence in the nation, particularly in law, finance
and the mass media, even though they constituted only 5 per cent of the popu
lation. The fact that Karl Marx was a Jew and that Jews such as Rosa
Luxembourg and Karl Liebknecht were disproportionately prominent in the
leadership of revolutionary movements in Germany, also tended to convince
the Nazis of the powerful internationalist and Communist tendencies of the
Jewish people themselves.
It is no part of the discussion here to argue whether the German attitude to
the Jews was right or not, or to judge whether its legislative



THE CRUCIFICTION 457
measures against them were just or unjust. Our concern is simply with the fact
that, believing of the Jews as they did, the Nazis' solution to the problem was
to deprive them of their influence within the nation by various legislative acts,
and most important of all, to encourage their emigration from the country
altogether. By 1939, the great majority of German Jews had emigrated, all of
them with a sizeable proportion of their assets. Never at any time had the Nazi
leadership even contemplated a policy of genocide towards them.
Jews Called Emigration 'Extermination'
It is very significant, however, that certain Jews were quick to interpret
these policies of internal discrimination as equivalent to extermination itself. A
1936 anti-German propaganda book by Leon Feuchtwanger and others entitled
Der Gelbe Fleck: Die Ausrotung von 500,000 deutschen fuden (The Yellow
Spot: The Extermination of 500,000 German Jews, Paris, 1936), presents a
typical example. Despite its baselessness in fact, the annihilation of the Jews is
discussed from the first pages — straightforward emigration being regarded as
the physical 'extermination' of German Jewry. The Nazi concentration camps
for political prisoners are also seen as potential instruments of genocide, and
special reference is made to the 100 Jews still detained in Dachau in 1936, of
whom 60 had been there since 1933. A further example was the sensational
book by the German-Jewish Communist, Hans Beimler, called Four Weeks in
the Hands of Hitler's Hell-Hounds: The Nazi Murder Camp of Dachau, which
was published in New York as early as 1933. Detained for his Marxist
affiliations, he claimed that Dachau was a death camp, though by his own
admission he was released after only a month there. The present regime in East
Germany now issues a Hans Beimler Award for services to Communism.
The fact that anti-Nazi genocide propaganda was being disseminated at this
impossibly early date, therefore, by people biased on racial or political
grounds, should suggest extreme caution to the independent-minded observer
when approaching similar stories of the war period.
The encouragement of Jewish emigration should not be confused with the
purpose of concentration camps in pre-war Germany. These were used for the
detention of political opponents and subversives — principally liberals, Social
Democrats and Communists of all kinds, of whom a proportion were Jews such
as Hans Beimler. Unlike the millions enslaved in the Soviet Union, the German
concentration



458 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
camp population was always small; Reitlinger admits that between 1934 and
1938 it seldom exceeded 20,000 throughout the whole of Germany, and the
number of Jews was never more than 3,000. (The S.S.: Alibi of a Nation,
London, 1956, p. 253).
Zionist Polio/ Studied
The Nazi view of Jewish emigration was not limited to a negative policy of
simple expulsion, but was formulated along the lines of modern Zionism. The
founder of political Zionism in the 19th century, Theodore Herzl, in his work
The Jewish State, had originally conceived of Madagascar as a national
homeland for the Jews, and this possibility was seriously studied by the Nazis.
It had been a main plank of the National Socialist party platform before 1933
and was published by the party in pamphlet form. This stated that the revival
of Israel as a Jewish state was much less acceptable since it would result in
perpetual war and disruption in the Arab world, which has indeed been the
case. The Germans were not original in proposing Jewish emigration to
Madagascar; the Polish Government had already considered the scheme in
respect of their own Jewish population, and in 1937 they sent the Michael
Lepecki expedition to Madagascar, accompanied by Jewish representatives, to
investigate the problems involved.
The first Nazi proposals for a Madagascar solution were made in association
with the Schacht Plan of 1938. On the advice of Goering, Hitler agreed to send
the President of the Reichsbank, Dr. Hijalmar Schacht, to London for
discussions with Jewish representatives Lord Bearsted and Mr. Rublee of New
York (cf. Reitlinger, The Final Solution, London, 1953, p. 20). The plan was
that German Jewish assets would be frozen as security for an international loan
to finance Jewish emigration to Palestine, and Schacht reported on these nego
tiations to Hitler at Berchtesgaden on January 2,1939. The plan, which failed
due to British refusal to accept the financial terms, was first put forward on
November 12,1938 at a conference convened by Goering, who revealed that
Hitler was already considering the emigration of Jews to a settlement in
Madagascar (ibid., p. 21). Later, in December, Ribbentrop was told by M.
Georges Bonnet, the French Foreign Secretary, that the French Government
itself was planning the evacuation of 10,000 Jews to Madagascar.
Prior to the Schacht Palestine proposals of 1938, which were essentially a
protraction of discussions that had begun as early as 1935, numerous attempts
had been made to secure Jewish emigration to



THE CRUCIFICTION 459
other European nations, and these efforts culminated in the Evian Conference
of July, 1938. However, by 1939 the scheme of Jewish emigration to
Madagascar had gained the most favour in German circles. It is true that in
London Helmuth Venusat of the German Foreign Office discussed limited
Jewish emigration to Rhodesia and British Guiana as late as April 1939; but by
January 24th, when Goering wrote to Interior Minister Frick ordering the
creation of a Central Emigration Office for Jews, and commissioned Heydrich
of the Reich Security Head Office to solve the Jewish problem 'by means of
emigration and evacuation', the Madagascar Plan was being studied in earnest.
By 1939, the consistent efforts of the German Government to secure the
departure of Jews from the Reich had resulted in the emigration of 400,000
German Jews from a total population of about 600,000, and an additional
480,000 emigrants from Austria and Czechoslovakia, which constituted almost
their entire Jewish populations. This was accomplished through Offices of
Jewish Emigration in Berlin, Vienna and Prague established by Adolf
Eichmann, the head of the Jewish Investigation Office of the Gestapo. So eager
were the Germans to secure this emigration that Eichmann even established a
training centre in Austria, where young Jews could learn farming in
anticipation of being smuggled illegally to Palestine (Manvell & Frankl, S.S.
and Gestapo, p. 60). Had Hitler cherished any intention of exterminating the
Jews, it is inconceivable that he would have allowed more than 800,000 to
leave Reich territory with the bulk of their wealth, much less considered plans
for their mass emigration to Palestine or Madagascar. What is more, we shall
see that the policy of emigration from Europe was still under consideration
well into the war period, notably the Madagascar Plan, which Eichmann
discussed in 1940 with French Colonial Office experts after the defeat of
France had made the surrender of the colony a practical proposition.
GERMAN POLICY TOWARDS THE JEWS AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF WAR
With the coming of the war, the situation regarding the Jews altered
drastically. It is not widely known that world Jewry declared itself to be a
belligerent party in the Second World War, and there was therefore ample basis
under international law for the Germans to intern the Jewish population as a
hostile force. On September 5, 1939 Chaim Weizmann, the principal Zionist
leader, had declared war against Germany on behalf of the world's Jews, stating
that 'the Jews



460 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
stand by Great Britain and fight on the side of the democracies... The Jewish
Agency is ready to enter into immediate arrangements for utilizing Jewish
manpower, technical ability, resource etc...' (Jewish Chronicle, September
8,1939).
Detention of Enemy Aliens
All Jews had thus been declared agents willing to prosecute a war against
the German Reich, and as a consequence, Himmler and Heydrich were
eventually to begin the policy of internment. It is worth noting that the United
States and Canada had already interned all Japanese aliens and citizens of
Japanese descent in detention camps before the Germans applied the same
security measures against the Jews of Europe. Moreover, there had been no
such evidence or declaration of disloyalty by these Japanese Americans as had
been given by Weizmann. The British, too, during the Boer War, interned all
the women and children of the population, and thousands had died as a result,
yet in no sense could the British be charged with wanting to exterminate the
Boers.
The detention of Jews in the occupied territories of Europe served two
essential purposes from the German viewpoint. The first was to prevent unrest
and subversion; Himmler had informed Mussolini on October 11th, 1942, that
German policy towards the Jews had altered during wartime entirely for
reasons of military security. He complained that thousands of Jews in the
occupied regions were conducting partisan warfare, sabotage and espionage, a
view confirmed by official Soviet information given to Raymond Arthur Davis
that no less than 35,000 European Jews were waging partisan war under Tito
in Yugoslavia. As a result, Jews were to be transported to restricted areas and
detention camps, both in Germany, and especially after March 1942, in the
Government-General of Poland.
As the war proceeded, the policy developed of using Jewish detainees for
labour in the war-effort. The question of labour is fundamental when
considering the alleged plan of genocide against the Jews, for on grounds of
logic alone the latter would entail the most senseless waste of manpower, time
and energy while prosecuting a war of survival on two fronts. Certainly after
the attack on Russia, the idea of compulsory labour had taken precedence over
German plans for Jewish emigration. The protocol of a conversation between
Hitler and the Hungarian regent Horthy on April 17th, 1943, reveals that the
German leader personally requested Horthy to release 100,000 Hungarian Jews
for work in the 'pursuit-plane programme'



THE CRUCIFICTION 461
of the Luftwaffe at a time when the aerial bombardment of Germany was
increasing (Reitlinger, Die Endlosung, Berlin, 1956, p. 478). This took place at
a time when, supposedly, the Germans were already seeking to exterminate the
Jews, but Hitler's request clearly demonstrates the priority aim of expanding
his labour force.
In harmony with this programme, concentration camps became, in fact,
industrial complexes. At every camp where Jews and other nationalities were
detained, there were large industrial plants and factories supplying material for
the German war-effort — the Buna rubber factory at Bergen-Belsen, for
example, Buna and I.G. Farben Industrie at Auschwitz, and the electrical firm
of Siemens at Ravensbruch. In many cases, special concentration camp money
notes were issued as payment for labour, enabling prisoners to buy extra
rations from camp shops. The Germans were determined to obtain the
maximum economic return from the concentration camp system, an object
wholly at variance with any plan to exterminate millions of people in them. It
was the function of the S.S. Economy and Administration Office, headed by
Oswald Pohl, to see that the concentration camps became major industrial
producers.
Emigration Still Favoured
It is a remarkable fact, however, that well into the war period, the Germans
continued to implement the policy of Jewish emigration. The fall of France in
1940 enabled the German Government to open serious negotiations with the
French for the transfer of European Jews to Madagascar. A memorandum of
August, 1942 from Luther, Secretary-of-State in the German Foreign Office,
reveals that he had conducted these negotiations between July and December
1940, when they were terminated by the French. A circular from Luther's
department dated August 15th, 1940 shows that the details of the German plan
had been worked out by Eichmann, for it is signed by his assistant, Dannecker.
Eichmann had in fact been commissioned in August to draw up a detailed
Madagascar Plan, and Dannecker was employed in research on Madagascar at
the French Colonial Office (Reitlinger, The Final Solution, p. 77). The
proposals of August 15th were that an inter-European bank was to finance the
emigration of four million Jews throughout a phased programme. Luther's
1942 memorandum shows that Heydrich had obtained Himmler's approval of
this plan before the end of August and had also submitted it to Goering. It
certainly met with Hitler's approval, for as early as June 17th his interpreter,
Schmidt, recalls Hitler observing to



462 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Mussolini that 'One could found a State of Israel in Madagascar' (Schmidt,
Hitler's Interpreter, London, 1951, p. 178).
Although the French terminated the Madagascar negotiations in December,
1940, Poliakov, the director of the Centre of Jewish Documentation in Paris,
admits that the Germans nevertheless pursued the scheme, and that Eichmann
was still busy with it throughout 1941. Eventually, however, it was rendered
impractical by the progress of the war, in particular by the situation after the
invasion of Russia, and on February 10th, 1942, the Foreign Office was
informed that the plan had been temporarily shelved. This ruling, sent to the
Foreign Office by Luther's assistant, Rademacher, is of great importance,
because it demonstrates conclusively that the term 'Final Solution' meant only
the emigration of Jews, and also that transportation to the eastern ghettos and
concentration camps such as Auschwitz constituted nothing but an alternative
plan of evacuation. The directive reads: 'The war with the Soviet Union has in
the meantime created the possibility of disposing of other territories for the
Final Solution. In consequence the Fuhrer has decided that the Jews should be
evacuated not to Madagascar but to the East. Madagascar need no longer
therefore be considered in connection with the Final Solution' (Reitlinger, ibid.
p. 79). The details of this evacuation had been discussed a month earlier at the
Wannsee Conference in Berlin, which we shall examine below.
Reitlinger and Poliakov both make the entirely unfounded supposition that
because the Madagascar Plan had been shelved, the Germans must necessarily
have been thinking of 'extermination'. Only a month later, however, on March
7th, 1942, Goebbels wrote a memorandum in favour of the Madagascar Plan as
a 'final solution' of the Jewish question (Manvell & Frankl, Dr. Goebbels,
London, 1960, p. 165). In the meantime he approved of the Jews being
'concentrated in the East'. Later Goebbels memoranda also stress deportation to
the East (i.e. the Government-General of Poland) and lays emphasis on the
need for compulsory labour there; once the policy of evacuation to the East had
been inaugurated, the use of Jewish labour became a fundamental part of the
operation. It is perfectly clear from the foregoing that the term 'Final Solution'
was applied both to Madagascar and to the Eastern territories, and that
therefore it meant only the deportation of the Jews.
Even as late as May 1944, the Germans were prepared to allow the
emigration of one million European Jews from Europe. An account of this
proposal is given by Alexander Weissberg, a prominent Soviet Jewish scientist
deported during the Stalin purges, in his book Die



THE CRUCIFICTION 463
Geschichte von Joel Brand (Cologne, 1956). Weissberg, who spent the war in
Cracow though he expected the Germans to intern him in a concentration
camp, explains that on the personal authorisation of Himmler, Eichmann had
sent the Budapest Jewish leader Joel Brand to Istanbul with an offer to the
Allies to permit the transfer of one million European Jews in the midst of the
war. (If the 'extermination' writers are to be believed, there were scarcely one
million Jews left by May 1944). The Gestapo admitted that the transportation
involved would greatly inconvenience the German war-effort, but were pre
pared to allow for 10,000 trucks to be used exclusively on the Russian front.
Unfortunately, the plan came to nothing; the British concluded that Brand
must be a dangerous Nazi agent and immediately imprisoned him in Cairo,
while the Press denounced the offer as a Nazi trick. Winston Churchill, though
orating to the effect that the treatment of the Hungarian Jews was probably 'the
biggest and most horrible crime ever committed in the whole history of the
world', nevertheless told Chaim Weizmann that acceptance of the Brand offer
was impossible, since it would be a betrayal of his Russian Allies. Although
the plan was fruitless, it well illustrates that no one allegedly carrying out
'thorough' extermination would permit the emigration of a million Jews, and it
demonstrates, too, the prime importance placed by the Germans on the war
effort.
The intoxicating manner in which the Great Lie has been told seems to
have prevented the raising of the simplest questions. For example, Zyklon
B was and is produced specifically for the destruction of the typhus-bearing
louse. Of the gases available to the efficient Germans at the time, this
pesticide was probably one of the least suitable for mass human
extermination. An enclosed space in which large amounts of the gas have
been used requires about twenty hours to clear before anyone can safely
enter. In his testimony, taken under torture, Commandant Hoss of
Auschwitz said his men entered the chamber ten minutes after the victims
were known to be dead and dragged out the corpses. He added that they
were often smoking cigarettes as they did so. This image of nonchalance
adds a dimension to the horror, but it also tells us that they were not
wearing gasmasks. Without them, they would have been poisoned;
smoking, they would have blown themselves up, for Zyklon B is explosive.
On 4 July 1984 the offices and warehouse of the Instititute for Historical
Review were reduced to rubble by arson. One must wonder why such an
attack should occur if the organization's opponents



464 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
are themselves the embodiment of reason. Anyone who has wandered into
the wilderness as a prospector for truth will confirm that it is an elusive
commodity, and what is found will often prove to be only fool's gold.
Nevertheless, if public apathy prevents the search for it — if individuals
will not commit themselves to this as an absolute priority — our society
will die in poverty. And it is you, the individual, who will inevitably pay.
We all have an inalienable right to be intelligently proved wrong. It would
seem that, in the end, we came to love the Jews solely because we hated the
Germans. But, like Jesus and Jehovah, they will prove to be false gods.
Conclusion
The evidence presented in this section will show any reasonable person that The
Diary of Anne Frank has sufficent doubt cast upon it to warrant its being considered
as little more than a fiction. But the important point is not the diary but the motive
behind its dissemination: to win sympathy for the Zionist cause and neutralize any
criticism of the Jews while they are achieving their objectives.
No doubt there are many Holocaust deniers who are so for entirely the wrong
reasons — racism and anti-Semitism are a very sad reality. Nonetheless there are
many such as myself who have concluded that the death of six million Jews in gas
chambers is an emotionally charged religious nonsense based on a history that was
written by angry victors eager to discredit the vanquished. If it is the case that
researchers such as myself have got it wrong, it must be demonstrated to us. That
the truth will surface cannot be doubted; what is of the utmost importance is how it
surfaces.
The German people have not only paid a very high economic price for the
supposed evil of their parents, they have carried an extraordinary burden of guilt for
the last fifty years. If the Holocaust is a fallacy, and this is uncovered in the wrong
way, the price to be paid by ordinary and perfectly innocent Jews will be sad indeed.
The explosion of anger and revenge will be such as has rarely been seen in the
pitiful tale we call human history. An open, honest and unbiased investigation of
these matters could do nothing but good. If it all happened as has been claimed, then
the detractors would be silenced forever; if otherwise, the Jew would at least have
been seen to be seeking the truth. The alternative is to keep throwing Holocaust
deniers into prison until, one day, the entire situation explodes. Legislating how a
man should think only serves to provide a platform for libertarians and
revolutionists. The net result is that you cause what you tried to stop.

Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics
The significance of the following is such that it should have become major
international news. I was not aware of this information myself until August
1995, six months after its release.
In the 26 January 1995 international edition of L'Espress, a largely
Jewish owned mass circulation French weekly magazine, a well-researched
and extensive article reported that the Auschwitz Museum Trust has
declared that the supposed Crematorium I at Auschwitz was built by
Communist authorities in 1948, three years after the war ended in Poland.
This completely confirms the link between international Zionism and the
Communist movement. Professor Robert Faurisson first exposed this
particular fraud in 1976, and has since been subjected to constant terrorism.
Whereas it had been claimed that six million Jews were killed, four million
of them gassed at Auschwitz, the claim is now greatly modified.
These revelations follow the admission by the US Government (reported
by David Irving in Action Report, No. 9, May 1995) that the extermination
facilities at Dachau were built by American troops for propaganda purposes
after the war ended. This is also acknowledged by the German Government.
Indeed, as early as April 1975, in that month's edition of Books and
Bookmen, the well-known Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal said: 'There were
no gassing camps on German soil.' The gassings, he said, took place only in
Poland. Dachau never had homicidal chambers; following the L'Espress
article, it is now official that this is also true of Auschwitz.
This magazine essay was written by an anti-revisionist historian, Eric
Conan, who says that there have been many blatant falsifications at the
Auschwitz and Birkenau concentration camp sites. Among other things he
says that when, in 1948, the Auschwitz State Museum was created, the
crematoria were reconstructed, replacing a small facility that had been built
to dispose of contagious corpses. He goes further: 'Tout y est faux'
everything in it is false. That the crematoria were a later reconstruction was
first admitted to Professor Faurisson by the museum official Jan Machalek
in 1976. This was reported by Le Monde on 29 December 1978.
The present Deputy Director of the Museum, Krystyna Olesky, has said
that everything will proceed as before, and that museum



466 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
staff will continue to offer vague answers to difficult questions posed by
visitors.
This camp was a manufacturing complex producing synthetic rubber
(buna). Why, one must ask, would any nation exterminate its slave labour
force in wartime?
Revisionists have progressively subjected the Holocaust story to
increasing pressure, and it is now clear that the myth will soon be
exploded. It thus seems obvious that the L'Espress article is an attempt to
pre-empt criticism — and to confess the lie beforehand so that later, if
required, the blame can be laid at the feet of the now defunct East
European Communist governments. Meanwhile, an international press ban
on the story ensures that the lie will be kept alive a little longer.
It must be seen from the outset that this is not an attempt to justify the
German use of prison and work camps, any more than one might sanction
their use by the British, who used them in South Africa during the Boer
War, or the Americans, who used them to intern Germans and Japanese, but
termed them 'relocation camps'. What we are dealing with is the ruthless
exploitation of a crime. The article is one which, with nonchalance and joie
de vivre, attempts to roll with the revisionists' punch and express regret that
the Auschwitz committee had no alternative but to completely rebuild the
chamber of horrors. This has now become a macabre Disneyland, earning
large amounts of money and sympathy, and leaving its sponsors free to
indulge in rapine of global proportions. Conan publishes the following
admissions in his article:
1. Auschwitz was a 'temporary' labour camp.
2. Barracks B153 was a 'quarantine camp', built as early as 1941. If
Auschwitz was a death camp or extermination factory, why did the
Germans concern themselves with the health of the inmates?
3. A substantial number of facilities at the complex, including the
delousing chambers, which had been rebuilt by the Communists or simply
presented as gas chambers, have had to be closed. That delousing chambers
existed must add to the evidence that this was a forced labour camp. Why
would the efficient Germans delouse their victims prior to gassing? Most
obvious and infamous of these closed buildings is the surgery and air-raid
shelter which was claimed to be Crematorium I. The fact is that if all the
supposed homicidal facilities in German-occupied Europe had been in
continuous use during the time they were alleged to have been in operation,
only about 430,000 could have been killed. But the maximum time any
such



LIES, DAMN LIES AND STATISTICS 467
facilities could have operated is only half of the period claimed. Besides,
an International Red Cross inspection of Auschwitz in 1944 found there
was no evidence of such facilities.
4. The original Crematoria II and III were dynamited by the Germans on
20 January 1945. These were, most likely, the manufacturing plants that the
Germans did not want to leave in Russian hands.
5. As of 1952 there were only thirty-eight barracks remaining, the
majority having been dismantled for one reason or another. The rebuilding
has been done according to plans which emerged when the Soviet Union
collapsed. These, it is claimed, were the original German plans captured by
the Russians. The authenticity of these documents has already been brought
into question.
6. The 26-member Auschwitz State Museum Committee was established
in 1990. It is international, and includes Israel Gutman of the Israeli Yad
Vashem Memorial and Theo Clein, President of CRIF (Representative
Council of Jewish Institutions in France). The museum itself was
established in 1948 by the Russians. It is clear from the article that the
committee was established to 'promote' Auschwitz, which has now become
a major tourist attraction.
7. In preparation for the fiftieth anniversary commemoration, the com
mittee removed a plaque which claimed that four million died at the camp,
ostensibly because it did not specify that 90 per cent were Jews. When
another plaque that included this information was installed, the overall
death figure was given as one million. (In the process it was necessary to
deny the known deaths of 75,000 Polish resistance fighters and hostages
and 15,000 Soviet soldiers.) The best estimate that can be reasonably
established for deaths at Auschwitz is, the article says, between 800,000
and 1,200,000, of whom between 650,000 and 1,000,000 were Jews. After
considerable haggling over who had suffered the most, the figure was set at
a total of 1,100,000, of whom 960,000 were Jews. It is known that there
were fewer than four million Jews in what became German-occupied
Europe. Of these, two million migrated to Russia — out of German reach
— and more than one million to other destinations. If we also subtract the
number of Jewish survivors after the cessation of hostilities, there are fewer
than 300,000 unaccounted for, this being the number of Jewish dead. The
most likely causes of death were typhus and starvation.
8. Being concerned at the dilapidated state of the Birkenau complex,
some three kilometres away, Ronald Lauder of the Estee Lauder company
has undertaken to raise 230 million franks for initial renovations. After



468 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
an agreement signed in 1994, the Federal German Government gave 10
million marks to aid renovations at Auschwitz. A further 2 million marks
was raised in a telethon organized by Norddeutscher Rundfunk Radio
Television. Many more millions of US dollars were contributed by the
governments of most European countries.
It is clear from the article that Auschwitz had much less impact upon its
Russian liberators than might have been expected. Seemingly they regarded
it as nothing more than a prison camp with starving inmates. It was about
two months later that the Russian propaganda machine — as the article
admits — picked a random figure of four million dead. We must
distinguish here between the inevitable and typical victimization of non
combatant men, women and children in all wars, and the allegation that the
German people committed genocide on an unprecedented scale.
This is the crux of the argument. Were six million innocent people killed
in homicidal gas chambers? Or did they die from disease brought about by
camp conditions and starvation as a result of Allied bombing of food
convoys? And was the figure six million or more likely a fraction of this?
Shall we forever think of Germans as homicidal maniacs or as just another
mad dog in a scrap? But, most importantly, we must ask if there is anyone
with anything to gain by perpetuating the Holocaust myth. Certainly,
although Auschwitz was liberated in late January of 1945, the deportees
who were quickly returned to France did not begin to think of mass
extermination until the histrionics of the Holocaust were launched by the
media in October 1945. It needs to be appreciated that many would have
without conscience — gone along with the story on the basis of wishing to
be revenged upon an enemy at whose hands they had suffered. It is
generally overlooked that international Jewry commenced belligerence
towards Germany as early as 24 March 1933, with an international ban on
German goods. This, combined with the involvement of German Jews with
the Communist movement — anathema to the Nazis — led to the
government declaring them enemies of the state and interning them — as
did the Americans to their German and Japanese residents.
Even if something approaching a million souls died unnecessary and
painful deaths at Auschwitz, that they were Jews, Catholics, homosexuals
or enemies of the Third Reich seems to me to be secondary to the fact that
they were human beings. One must then ask what sort of sick and twisted
minds would turn this memorial of human shame into a Hollywood-style
extravaganza.



LIES, DAMN LIES AND STATISTICS 469
In March 1996, I learned that it is planned to build a shopping centre and
restaurant at Auschwitz. One must wonder about the euphemisms that
might be used to name the dishes on the menu at such a place. With or
without extermination facilities, Auschwitz was a house of horror. It has
been left to the non-Jewish Polish Government to order an inquiry into the
proposal.
The following questions now arise:
1. Will the international Zionist movement and the modern state of Israel
formally apologize for the Holocaust deception?
2. Will the state of Israel reimburse the German and American gov
ernments the vast sums of money it has received in compensation?
3. An entire nation of people has grown to middle age believing that their
parents participated in the most terrible crime in history. Will the state of
Israel and the international Zionist movement compensate Germans for this
suffering?
The Holocaust was a means, not an end. The actual objective was the
acquisition of modern Israel as a base and centre of empire. It would also
provide immunity from criticism in the process of achieving the financial
dominance and control that international Zionism now has. By accusing
even their mildest critic of anti-Semitism and reminding the world of their
pain and suffering — by behaving like a petulant child — they have
achieved almost total financial dominance of our globe. But ultimately,
when Zionism abandons Judaism, upon which it is a political parasite, its
indifference to the subsequent suffering of the Khazars will itself prove to
be the ultimate despotism. In this respect, I would like to relate a recent
conversation.
My editor is a man of few words, sort of self-editing. He has seen writers
come and go; he knows only that their spelling is generally appalling and
their punctuation usually worse. In a recent conversation which, to me,
seemed to have a surreal Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson flavour to it,
he gave a tacit admission to my seeming to have succeeded in resolving a
particular problem, but then asked 'What's the solution?'
Somehow I managed to refrain from easing myself luxuriously into my
metaphorical Victorian armchair, slowly and pensively removing my pipe
from my mouth and responding with a patronizing 'Elementary my Dear
Doctor Watson...elementary'. The fact is that the solution is a simple one,
but it would seem that 'these things must surely come to pass'. But for the
obvious obstacles, the following would at least, within the present system,
solve the



470 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
world's economic woes and neutralize the machinations of the international
moneylenders and Zionism in little or no time at all:
1. Outlaw usury of any kind and make it a capital offence.
2. Bring the international bankers before a world court and charge them
with wholesale extortion and massive crimes against humanity, and with
causing poverty, starvation and death on an unprecedented scale.
3. Place the production of money and credit back in the hands of
responsible government and have all banking services operated as a public
utility.
4. Return currency to a gold or silver standard and fix exchange rates.
5. Abolish absolutely all taxes and levies and institute a 10 per cent
turnover tax, which would give governments far greater revenue even than
they have now — because people would have so much more money to
spend.
6. Outlaw speculation of any kind, particularly upon private property, the
only form of legitimate income being that which adds value through labour
and services.
7. Educate the people and make them aware that as individuals, families
and nations they must live within their means, whatever those means may
be: to apply the Micawber principle.
As pointed out earlier, it is by turning credit into debt and selling that
credit — totally non-existent money — at high interest that the
international moneylenders have achieved the impossible: making
something from nothing. It is so simple that it seems utterly unbelievable.
By providing credit — lending money they never had — and demanding
profit and repayment upon this non-thing in real resources, they have
achieved virtual ownership of the world. These clever, conniving,
disreputable little merchants have pulled off the ultimate coup: they have
proved conclusively that you can get blood from a stone. By appealing to
our basest instincts and highest ideals, they have continually set us at each
other's throats, funded the fight and then claimed the spoils.
I have already mentioned that they financed the Communist revolution in
Russia. Among many sources, this is revealed in Trotsky's own biography.
From 1907 through to 1917 Lord Alfred Milner and Sir George Buchanan
provided loans via the Morgan and Rothschild banks in London. A loan of
$20 million came from Jacob Schiff of Kuhn Loeb in the US. Other funding
came from the German bank of Max Warburg. In the mean time another of
the Warburg brothers — Paul — had gone to the US and became a



LIES, DAMN LIES AND STATISTICS 471
prime mover in setting up the Federal Reserve. Between 1918 and 1922 the
Soviets paid Kuhn Loeb over 600 million roubles in gold as part repayment
of loans made prior to the revolution.
The enigmatic Leonardo da Vinci, a Grand Master of the Prieure de
Sion, once said: 'Miserable mortals, open your eyes.' Jean Cocteau, yet
another Grand Master of the order, once said:
History is an alliance of reality and lies. The reality of history becomes a
lie. The unreality of the fable becomes the truth.
But it doesn't stop there. As is well known and well documented, the
stooges that the moneylenders put into the White House sold China to the
Communists and put the US into wars in Korea and Vietnam (which
despite her capacity to do so, they forbade her to win). Their real objective
was the conquest of America.
Ultimately, mankind will not find nirvana by sitting cross-legged atop a
mountain and chanting some nonsensical mantra. It will be achieved by
facing the truth and observing the Law. But it is obvious that these things
are still beyond our understanding and will continue to be so until we cease
to act selfishly and for personal gain at the expense of others. Nirvana lies
in our finding a sense of community and in discipline being applied from
within. When, instinctively, we give our lives that others might live, then
shall we be as gods. In short, the earth must await the coming of the new
race. These simple things are beyond the ability of present-day man.
But all is not lost. Long ago, somewhere in the future, it was said:
There are three kinds of knowledge: knowledge of the nature of each thing,
of its cause, and of its influence.
There are three things that continually decrease: darkness, falsehood, and
death.
There are three things that continually increase: light, truth, and life.
The unconscious feminine within us is a microcosm of, and is directly
connected to, the universal unconscious, a great ocean of mind that
transcends all time. Through this great mind, we are all connected to each
other and are, in fact, one. Some two thousand years ago, at a moment of
perfect receptivity, a few men made some postulates and altered the shape
of the future. Tradition says that when, in our coming dark day, enough
men call upon the name of God, we shall be saved. I conjecture that the
Teacher may come



472 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
and go, almost unnoticed, but that he and his followers will make the
postulates that will echo throughout the universe and thus in the hearts of
men. With one voice they will affirm: It will be.
Accordingly, it is related in Babylonian tradition that the Zu bird, an
eagle-type false thirteenth sign as opposed to the true serpent-type, stole
the tablets of destiny. Shamash hid himself in the body of an ox (a symbol
for Coma) and, when the Zu came to feast upon him, he killed it and
restored the tablets. There is nothing to fear. All will be well when we
grasp the hero's bow and make those postulates. Then it WILL be.
But the chances are that my poetic proclamation is, in the reader's eyes,
swamped by a conception that I am nothing more than a racist bigot.
Strangely enough, such an opinion would be absolutely correct.
Were I to be rightly accused of bias or intolerance on the grounds of
nation or race, it would be in connection with my generally intolerant view
of white West Australians. Having spent many years walking up and down
in the world, my knowledge and experience of different peoples is not
inconsiderable. I regard these creatures as living Neanderthal fossils who,
lacking the required etiquette, could never be invited even to a chimps' tea
party. But if one insists upon going down into Hades one must expect to
keep company with the damned. In fact their international reputation is
such that, prior to my departing for Western Australia, a friend informed
me that it had originally been intended that Jesus would be born there, but
unfortunately the angels were unable to find three wise men and a virgin.
These comments are, of course, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but they do
demonstrate my lack of inhibition in expressing racist views, if I had them.
But note your reaction. Most likely you are deeply concerned at my
references to the Khazar Jews; probably, however, you were (if you are not
West Australian) amused at, or at least prepared to indulge me in, my
criticism of these people. Like the Khazars, West Australians bleed — or,
at least, so I am led to believe. Why then is there a difference in your
reaction? Is it because you have been conditioned? Consider all that that
implies...
If one has not lived in or visited Australia, one can have no conception of
the diversity and intensity of its beauty. But let me say that, in the cluster of
precious stones which adorn our Mother's hand, this country is the coral
that reflects the moods of the brooding and unpredictable Piscean sea.
Many of its Aboriginal people have moved to shantytowns, where they live
with what is left of



LIES, DAMN LIES AND STATISTICS 473
their holy people. In a land of untold wealth, they live in poverty and wait
for the white man to move on. But let's be fair, there is no shortage of black
men with the white man's disease. Once again, it isn't race but nature that
concerns us. Nevertheless, this creature remains a representative of the
European whose moment of glory was to be one of the hammers God used
to shatter and scatter the holy people. But the numbering of his days is writ
large in braille for even the white West Australian to read.
As a mark of his superiority, the European claimed, and still claims, that
the Aboriginal is a relatively primitive creature. This is said to be
evidenced, among other things, by the lack of a written language. But in
this respect this colony is involved in a cover-up of Dead Sea Scrolls
proportions. Before turning our attention to the location in question, let us
look at another.
Department of Aboriginal Sites site number P 01014, which is covered
by the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972-1980, represents what is probably one
of the most sacred Aboriginal places in the entire country. This legislation
includes a very clever and pernicious regulation, 10(h), which affects
access not only to these sites but also to files on their contents and nature.
In such cases, not only is hard evidence of early cultural maturity
concealed, it aids destabilization and dehumanizes the victim. Rob a man of
his bread and you take his earthly life; rob him of his culture and you
imprison his soul. My concern here is with the desecration of sacred land,
as an act of total cultural disrespect. Further, in contrasting the Holocaust
material with that which follows, I would ask the reader to bear in mind
that Britain's record in Australia is a lamentable one, which the independent
state has endorsed. Though the windows have been dressed, the policy
remains the same.
To make a related point, Britain had much to gain — as does any
adversary in wartime — from creating an image of an evil Germany. This,
history tells us, is pretty well standard. In the case of World War II, the
cudgels were taken up, and are still yet to be set down, by world Jewry. The
point is that the creation of disinformation about Germany and the
withholding of information are two tools that can be used to achieve the
same end: the swaying of public opinion.
Important archeological sites cannot and must not be allowed to become
tourist attractions. However, regulations designed to send an independent
researcher on what Eisenman found (apropos the Dead Sea Scrolls) was the
'runaround' does guarantee that information is kept to a bare minimum,
which has been the case till



474 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
now. Out of respect for the site itself and its real Aboriginal custodians, and
for no other reason, I shall not discuss its location and simply refer to it as
PWM.
Long, long before the arrival of the European, PWM was a source of
ochre, which the people used in sacred ceremonies. Perhaps more so than
any other human tribe, the Australian Aborigines were obsessive in their
relationship to the earth; they would do nothing to harm, mark or damage
the face of their mother. Though they mined at this place for what must be
assumed to be thousands of years, the land and mine would not have been
mistreated, particularly in view of the fact that it was held to be one of the
most sacred sites in Australia.
Giant Kangaroo was a Noah-type version of Jesus the Teacher among the
Aboriginals. The original name for the site was Ngana-kurakura, which
translates as 'whose/his eye'. The cave is brightly lit by the red ochre, and
could be envisaged as the inner part of a red eye that sees everything. We
might see here an albino type Horus. The red ochre came into being when
Giant Kangaroo's eye was pierced with a spear and he died there. It is quite
simply an Aboriginal Calvary. That the red ochre (blood of Christ) was
later used for body decoration is reminiscent of the agape feast: the
consuming of the menses of the earth and spermatozoa of First Man.
On 2 August 1952, S. G. Middleton, the Commissioner of Native Affairs,
wrote:
The special reserve was originally 5 acres but was eventually reduced to an
acre, to a depth of 50 feet below the floor of the cave on certain conditions.
That those conditions have been honoured more in the breach than the
observance is clearly manifested by a report, supported by photographs,
submitted recently by an office of the Native Affairs Department. The
photographs clearly indicate that the original features of the caves have been
totally destroyed.
Whether the natives ceased to take an interest in the caves before their
destruction and desecration is a matter for speculation; there is no doubt,
however, that the ruthless destruction and march of Mammon have deprived
them of their heritage. Some may feel that they also provide yet another
example of the unsuitability of our race to be custodians of the care and
welfare of a helpless, dependent native minority. We have taken so much from
them and given little in return.



LIES, DAMN LIES AND STATISTICS 475
It is noteworthy that this article was published as early as 1952; it
indicates a sensitive and sentient man in a land substantially consisting of
white savages who even today are totally ignorant and abusive of the
fundamental rights of the Aboriginal people.
When the European found the cave, he put a rail link in, used it as an
open cast mine, planned to exploit mineral deposits, then proposed making
it a tourist attraction. This is revealed in an article in an Australian
newspaper dated 16 December 1968.
In the Hunter Valley in New South Wales there is an ancient site which
is absolute and concrete living evidence that, contrary to established white
belief, the Aboriginal people of Australia once had their own complex and
sophisticated written hieroglyphic language. In working as a dealer in
Aboriginal art for the past three years, I had begun to suspect this to be a
probability. The consistent use of symbols, and the idea that every picture
is not a picture but a story, led one to see that the fundamental concepts
have long since existed. I recently watched what can only be described as
an amateur video of the site. At first viewing it is tempting to see a
similarity between these pictograms, comprising more than 250 characters,
and ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. They are not the same; and
furthermore, among them may be seen the circle quartered by the cross,
which is traditionally Celtic. To suggest that these writings may have been
produced by visiting ancient Egyptians with a sole Celtic member of the
ship's crew is not only to deny the Aboriginals their rightful dignity but to
deny the reality that the entire ancient world was once governed by highly
literate priests and that each human tribe had its own version of a truly
universal language which they received from the angels and lost when the
people went to war (the dawn of Pisces). Since then the white intruder has
kept it hidden lest he see the wrong he has done.
The question that we as individuals must ask ourselves is: how long can
we continue? Alternatively, a major apology is in order; and as a mark of
our good faith we must give back what we have taken. We should not make
the mistake of becoming sycophantic white middle-class apologists: one
sound apology is enough. We must then go back to our own roots and find
out who we were before we became what we are now. Having rebirthed
ourselves, and standing proudly upon our own cultural and ethnic roots, we
must go out and meet the world as our equals: our brothers in Christ.



476 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Conclusion
In the matter of the six million Jews supposedly gassed by the Nazis we have seen
an admission that the gas chamber at Dachau was built by American troops and that
a prominent Jewish source, in attempting to repair damage done by revisionists, has
admitted that Auschwitz is a postwar reconstruction based on imagination. This was
all part of the price the Germans paid for having been vanquished. As well, it has
been conjectured that admissions such as occur in the L'Espress article are an
attempt both to cut off revisionists at the pass and, if need be, to blame the old
Communist governments for the deception. Primarily as a result of evidence from
Jewish sources, it is no longer a matter of proving the Holocaust is a lie. The most
difficult task lies ahead: making it common knowledge.
In raising the matter of the strong likelihood of the Australian Aborigine having
once had a complex written language, I hope I have demonstrated that we are at a
point in history where a massive turnaround is about to take place. The world we
know is dying, and in its place there will be a return to the ancient ways. We are
living in a time of revelation; the old institutions and collectives will not support us
much longer. I propose that the Bible as a repository of unsurpassed wisdom was
never meant to speak to institutions but to people like you and me. Ultimately it
must be the individual who displays the courage that will win the grand prize:
freedom from fear and from slavery to his own cowardice.
On the principle that the whole is only as good as its separate ingredients, I
propose that Scripture sets out to appeal to, and to create, the individual made strong
and free by his relationship to his creator. And on the principle that the greatest
unity is found in the widest diversity, there can be no lasting social structure, nor
can there be any hope of permanent peace, until communities are established on the
fundamental principle of the inalienable rights of each and every one of us. The so
called democratic system thrives on, and is vulnerable to, corruption because of its
fundamental principle, which is the franchise given to the lowest and, by necessity,
largest social grouping, without meeting the corresponding need for education. I, for
one, insist that entropy was never a part of God's plan.
Incredible as it may seem, we shall eventually learn that all these events, up to
and including those in our time, were first set into place when Zoroastrian magi
from Persia marched into Palestine some two and a half thousand years ago. They
created the false Israel as a means of creating the true one. They established false
Christianity as a shadow of that which would come to pass. And in so doing they
guaranteed the future of mankind in a perpetual Golden Age.

Ye Booke of Beliar Ye Scrivener
An eminent, respected and highly respectable academic of the school of
Dead Sea Scrolls inactivists once quipped, when speaking of John M.
Allegro, 'Adagio Allegro, adagio'. Perhaps his amazement at and
admiration for his own wit allowed a moment of indiscretion to creep in.
This statement says 'Don't be so eager to let the cat out of the bag; there are
vested interests at stake here'. An example of this gentleman's concern may
be found in The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross,50 where Allegro is
speaking of the unnecessary occurrence in Aramaic of the word 'Abba' in
the New Testament (Mark 14: 36; Romans 8:15; Galatians 4: 6).
He says that 'My (our) father who art in heaven' (Matthew 6: 9-13; Luke
11: 2-4) is often used as a surrogate for God. The fullness of this phrase is
curious when one might expect a simple 'God' or 'Father'. He goes on to say
that the explanation lies in the Sumerian word for mushroom, AB-BA
TAB-BA-RI-GI. The mushroom grows in darkness and sprouts overnight,
and for this reason was used by the early Christians as a symbol and
hieroglyph for the cosmic tree. The cryptographers, he says, have teased out
the Sumerian into an Aramaic 'abba' debareqia': 'O my (our) father who art
in heaven'.
Though, as Allegro points out, the phrase originally had a more serious
intent — the Lord's Prayer is a well hidden magical incantation — in turn
some wise and witty teller of fairytales teased from this 'Abracadabra'.
It does seem very strange to relate that, among a few who have been
forced to keep silent, the Bible has always been known as a handbook of
the occult, yet somehow the majority have managed to maintain the self
deception. Accordingly, it will be recalled that I have made several
references to Scorpio being believed to be the thirteenth sign of the zodiac.
I have also drawn attention to Jesus' saying that if a son should ask for
bread his father should give him the thirteenth stone, and if he asks for a
fish he should give him the solar serpent. The verse following this (Luke
11: 12) continues: 'Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?'
Will he teach his son the wisdom of the true or the false Israel?
By yet another coincidence, in Genesis 49: 17 Dan is 'a serpent



478 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
(nachash) by the way', and Dan is Scorpio. In the Garden of Eden the same
solar serpent (nachash) gave Eve to eat of the tree. That is to say, the solar
phallic serpent gives life to the Goddess in the thirteenth/genital stone, his
wisdom being his spermatozoa. It may be recalled that Habakkuk 1: 5
reads:
Behold the nations and see, marvel and be astonished; for I accomplish a
deed in your days, but you will not believe it when told. (Vermes translation)
Men like Allegro have long since spoken out at their own cost and made
it possible for ordinary folk to learn the truth. Joe Public has greeted all this
new knowledge with frenzied apathy. He has, in fact, been so completely
underwhelmed that he has hardly been able to contain his indifference.
Things fall into two categories: that which can be influenced or changed
and that which cannot. Discriminating between the two contributes to a
much less stressful life; change is intrinsic to continuity.
The ancient world was governed by men and women who were literal
masters of the universe. When such minds are pitched against the great
unwashed of modern academia, it is no contest. I wonder how much longer
these fools will be allowed to play cat and mouse with reality? The joker in
the pack is, of course, the indolent Joe Public. He is simply and blissfully
unaware of how close he is to his own tragedy, as evidenced by the
following:
The United States Government has, since 1933, been operating under a
state of emergency. That is to say that from that date to the present time the
Government and presidents have had continual state-of-emergency powers
at their disposal. Australia has been governed in a similar manner since
1932. Linda Thompson, a US lawyer and President of the American Justice
Federation, has provided concrete evidence to support the following.
The US One Hundred and Sixtieth Division has been made into an
internal police force with truly draconian powers. Automatic weapons are
standard equipment, as are ex-Russian military vehicles fully equipped with
every requirement for riot and crowd control. These trucks can only be
described as mobile doom machines able to kill large numbers. As more
and more people are discovering, this military force is recruiting from
prisons and boot camps. It is taking the most primitive members of society
and, by an indoctrination which can only be described as brainwashing the



YE BOOKE OF BELIAR YE SCRIVENER 479
mindless, putting members of the criminal class into uniform and making
them social minders.
This 'Delta Force' is equipped with black-painted, unmarked helicopter
gunships armed to the teeth, which are already buzzing and harassing US
citizens. They have burned down at least one private home with an
incendiary missile. The owner and resident's only crime was to be a
neighbour of someone who has gathered seventeen million signatures with
the aim of impeaching President Clinton. This force was also responsible
for razing the Branch Davidian house in Waco, Texas. The financing of this
division is to be done by 'the confiscation of private property'.
The entire United States has been divided into ten zones which, under the
auspices of 'Operation Garden-plot', have been liberally peppered with
concentration camps. One of them, at Beach Grove, Indiana, is an ex
Amtrack locomotive repair yard. It has been fenced with a view to keeping
people in, rather than out. The rail line has been renewed and a warehouse
close by has had its windows and doors sealed. Electronic turnstiles, clearly
designed for people rather than animals, are the sole means of entry. Gas
pipelines now run to this building and to two very large gas-fired
incinerators adjacent to it. Now I am not going to say that this is a mass
extermination facility because, without a shadow of doubt, it will be
pointed out that such a suggestion is ridiculous when the facility's real
purpose is so obvious and innocent. I can only point out to the remarkable
Joe Public that 'all this and much much more will shortly be appearing at an
apocalypse somewhere near you'.
Let me add that, in revealing this, my actions are motivated by cowardice
and fear of pain. I lack the backbone of the staunch and heroic Joe Public,
who need not concern himself with these matters. When these morons come
to take him and his wife and his children to rape, torture and destroy them,
he will cope — God bless him.
Just as the thirteenth stone adds a new dimension to the cosmic tree, it
adds a new perception of life itself: we see that the whole is greater than the
sum of its parts. If man continues to insist that reality will stand still for
him, he can only progressively dig himself deeper and deeper into the mire.
In the light of this mindless indifference to reality, one can truly take to
heart scriptures such as Habakkuk 1:1-4 which says:



480 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto
thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!
Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for
spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and
contention.
Therefore the law is slacked, and judgement doth never go forth: for the
wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgement
proceedeth.
A mystery I cannot resolve is why decent ordinary people will expend so much
energy to deceive themselves when truth is such a gentle and loving
companion. Is it simply a matter of chemicals allowing a truth to enter the
mind but preventing it from reaching the heart?
Fortissimo Allegro, fortissimo! God the totally beneficent is, to them,
Maleficus.
We can be sure there is no traditional Devil or Satan in Scripture: these
roles are played by the Liar and the Wicked Priest. God uses the Dark as a
means of sharpening the Light. This is confirmed by a line in the Lord's
Prayer: 'and lead us not into temptation'. Dare we say it? — there is a Light
and Dark side to the Force.
Our findings show us that the Bible sees present humanity as beasts of
little or no understanding. We are simply another part of the animal
kingdom, destined to be superseded by a more highly evolved creature
whose progenitor is Adam the Teacher. It is all simply evolution, which
may be termed the progressive manifestation of God, and the key factor is
the development of the right brain.
With this point in mind, we have an entirely new view of the biblical
'God' and His creating man in His own image. What we see now is the
Creator as pure mind with an androgynous nature creating mankind in
His/Her own image as an androgynous creature with both masculine and
feminine understanding: Mind creating mind, the progressive manifestation
of consciousness.
In the English translation of Genesis we have the literalist idea that God
made Eve by taking a rib from Adam's side. In the Hebrew original we find
there is no literal rib; thus, with our knowledge of the left and right brain
concept, we may perceive the Teacher as a First Man made in God's
intellectual image — His (at this stage) only-begotten son (Jesus) who is
androgynous in mind like his



YE BOOKE OF BELIAR YE SCRIVENER 481
Father. The creation of Eve from his side is the awakening of his own
feminine. This finds further confirmation in the oft-asked question as to
how the sons of Adam and Eve could have gone off to take wives if Adam
was the literal first man. Chapter four of Genesis lists the birth of the sons
of this pair and concludes:'.. .then began men to call on the name of the
Lord'. Thus we may now see that God's forbidding eating from the tree of
knowledge in Genesis 2: 17 has a much more obvious meaning than its
traditional interpretation. The verse concludes: 'for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die'. That is: When the Teacher reveals the
mysteries in Scripture, the Apocalypse and Great Flood will be upon you.
The Hebrew word translated as 'knowledge' is 'da'ath', which is the
cabalistic name for our missing sephirah of the sun. It will be recalled that
this is also the 'truth chakra'.
Chapter five enumerates the generations from Adam, all these being
from literally non-existent breeding females. Genesis is not a primitive and
unsophisticated story: it is not the tale but the idiots who tell it.
In Norse mythology 'Hel' was the Goddess: the lower procreative regions
which Christianity said were the source of damnation. The fire of love
became the fires of Hell. Life and death are not in conflict but are
complementary, forming a perfect circle. Inasmuch as God (Mind) created
us in His/Her own image, it is not only that the Genesis myth is
misunderstood: our perception of it is also wrong. We are tempted by our
environment to perceive ourselves in the order of body, mind, spirit; we are
in fact spirit creating mind, and mind creating body. The intellect, which is
a multidimensional thing, has many diverse aspects to its nature.
One of these is the Predator/Destroyer, whose apparently negative facets
we are all familiar with. But its positive aspect is that it keeps all life awake
— wary and alert. Its function is therefore an extremely important one.
Without it there would be no consciousness and drive as we know it. There
would actually be no consciousness at all. What we call history and think of
as real events is only memory or record of the multitudinous and
progressive thoughts that have passed through Mind.
The Piscean Age, particularly its present manifestation and culmination,
was the roar of this wild Predator/Destroyer which would take its prey
the weak and feeble-minded — and alert the survivors to danger. And Hel
the Goddess of the procreative fire? She is the mother who alerts her young
to danger. Sadly, few heed



482 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
her cry. But then, her prodigious womb and her knowing have prepared her
for this event — the spiral is always rising. She knows the ferryman must
have his penny. Death is the price paid for living: from death real
consciousness arises; without it Her womb is barren. She herself lives
betwixt two worlds. She is life and destruction, young maid and old crone.
Do not think of her as 'out there'; She is within us as we are within Her. She
is Mind. Listening to Her and understanding Her is to come to know All at
source. This is the knowing of self from which feeble wishing takes flight.
It is the passion that causes life to be, the wild thing that knows. The
thunderclap; the lightning-bolt; the raining of water that permeates the egg;
the conception — life conceived and death rebuked.
In this cycle of Mind, the diaconein is the servant of the materia, whom
she in turn serves. The modern world has destroyed our understanding of
and faith in the never-ending cycle, and has left us to face the fear of death,
which now we struggle vainly to overcome. Within this understanding, it
would be safe to say that this man we call the Teacher, this hero of heroes
— an incarnation of so many saviours of legend— would not see himself as
such, this being his one qualification for the job that someone has to do.
No, he would not see through the 'I' — only as a thought like so many
thoughts passing through Mind as it is in the becoming.
The natural beginning for the evolution of man is with the
Australopithecines (Australopithecus afarensis), whom it seems inherited
much from Aegyptopithecus zeuxis of some thirty million years ago and
later (twenty million years ago) proconsul. More recently — some two
million years back — we greet the arrival of Homo habilis. This first tool
and weapon maker is still more baboon than man as we would perceive
him. About 1.6 million years ago we find Homo erectus. This creature is
where we first see the distinct appearance of modern intelligence. Homo
sapiens arrived about three hundred thousand years ago, the European
branch of this tree being Neanderthal. Some forty thousand years ago this
creature becomes refined and fine tuned into Homo sapiens sapiens — you
and me.
All this evolution, which appears to occur faster and faster, is effected by
four molecular building blocks called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The
ability to alter its structure gives the modern scientist the role of creator
god. Well...if tiny Homo sapiens sapiens can do it, there's little doubt that
God can do it too — in one generation. It is all from thought in Mind that is
without and within;



YE BOOKE OF BELIAR YE SCRIVENER 483
we are the dreaming within that Mind, the essence of all being. Like the
whirling dervishes, the thought increases its speed with the tempo of the
music of the spheres, spinning, spinning the web of the dance, memory
creating the genetic pool. Curiously enough, as we all know, it was man's
capturing and taming fire (the sun) which began his advance.
Perhaps the reader may perceive here that there is both a danc
ing/dreaming and a cold hard doing that walk hand in hand as do a man and
a woman. Likewise, both physical and cultural evolution have generated
our development. This combination of the inner and the outer was, is and
factually and actually will be — there is no other way. Only our masculine
sciences are foolish enough to deny this spinning dreaming.
The ancient myths also support this notion of spiritual birth. The Greeks
had Ouranos and Gaea (heaven and earth) as progenitors of a human race
born in love. It will be recalled that this First Man concept is as often as not
combined with the idea of revelation. In India, for example, Indra was a
Horus type who was all-knowing and who became the god of rain, water
being the words of God. He discovered the soma plant, which was the
source of this water of life, originating from the moon; this liquid is
referred to as 'the blood of trees'. Indra starts off as a mortal hero like all the
other Teacher types, and he derives his name in a very clever way. It is
taken from 'indu'; this signifies both a drop of water and sap from a tree
the cosmic temple — this being the fertilizing spermatozoa of the sun.
In putting together a work of this nature, one receives regular nocturnal
visitations from both the angel of hope and the demons of despair. One
wonders whether there can ever be framed that sentence or two that will
cause the reader's adrenaline to pump; whether somehow he or she can be
made aware that lies are lurking nearby with very sharp teeth and brutal
claws. Can I, I wonder, awaken in you our ancient ancestors' constant
vigilance, which made the miracle of modern man possible? Is there
something I can say that would justify the Allegros of this world and give
heart to a latter-day prophet we call Habakkuk? The most likely response is
an enthusiastic grunt of disinterest, but somehow I am captivated by the
gentle smile upon the face of the angel of hope, even though, faced by such
an incredibly noisome silence, I am forced to admit that this book is just
another tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury and
signifying...NOTHING!
Now let me emphasize that this is not an expression of pique at



484 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
having my words ignored or my genius unrecognized. That I was fortunate
enough to stumble across this remarkable information is in itself
overwhelming. I also know that the sheer volume of the evidence
supporting my arguments is such that the bulk of my claims are ultimately
irrefutable. That being the case, sooner or later the world will have to come
to terms with reality, be it from my conclusions or someone else's — it
really doesn't matter which. No doubt this will happen later rather than
sooner, even though the inexorable wheel of truth began to turn a long time
ago. This too suits me rather well, because researching and writing
continue to give me considerable pleasure. In searching out and framing
my findings, there is a beautiful and gentle sense of sitting at the feet of an
angel with infinite patience. One feels wrapped around in love. There is a
sense of being guided to a centre where perfect knowledge is perfect peace;
and the grand prize is to be suspended in an ocean of love.
My involvement with its promotion since the publication of the first
edition of this book more than two years ago has been tedious in the
extreme. But the lessons learned from it have been salutary in that in many
cases they have brought into focus the obvious truths that most of us
attempt to avoid. And here lies my motive for raising this matter. Perhaps
my greatest discovery since the publication of the first edition is that there
exists a vast international conspiracy of frenzied apathy and indifference. In
evolutionary terms, the instinct for self-preservation seems to have failed to
preserve itself. I must admit it is all completely beyond my comprehension.
No doubt we shall know all when the Teacher comes.
Most noticeable in this chorus of deafening silence were the remarks
made by an Australian writer on the Scrolls who raised herself from an
orgasmic lethargy to say of me that I do not know the difference between
history and imagination and that I have no accurate knowledge of the
contents of the Dead Sea texts. She also said that I use the name of the
Qumran documents in a magical way. This argument centres around
whether or not these writings are, in fact, 'magical'. I believe that she stands
entirely alone in implying they are not. The authors, by implication, were
not magi. Why else would Christendom deny them as genuine and original
Christian writings? That 'they are Christian' is clear to the meanest
observer; the problem lies in their being cabalistic. But then, as I have
shown, so is the Bible. This lady has also been heard to say that the Scrolls
are 'dull, dry and boring', which must leave us to



YE BOOKE OF BELIAR YE SCRIVENER 485
wonder at her real motives for writing books about them. Personally, I
think Joe Public is guilty of, and should be punished for, the crimes he
allows to be committed.
Had the response been different I would have been shocked and amazed.
I would also have been dismayed by the fact that I would obviously have
been completely wrong in my findings. The fact is that we have before us
some very important principles. If the Dead Sea writings speak of mysteries
hidden in Scripture by God, it is logical that they would stand in opposition
to traditional belief; otherwise they would not be mysteries. As Habakkuk
1: 5 says: Marvel and be astonished. Furthermore, the New Age image
given to the Essenes is clearly wrong, for we now have to accept that, as
God is the creator of the Dark and the Light, they actively worked on behalf
of both sides. Historically speaking, they established false Christianity and
false Judaism, and in so doing also provided the means by which Jesus the
Teacher might destroy them. Seeing these ancient scribes as gentle mystics
can be only the first mistake: they were men of unimaginable power and
purpose. Yes, their gentleness would have been obvious, but their purpose
was singular. They actually were commissioned by God. And it must again
be emphasized that their ability to achieve their objectives lay in the fact
that they alone were literate in society at that time.
Playing the part of the Dark and the Light, as though in anticipation of
the Roman destruction of Jerusalem, some of these ancient Rabbis moved
to Jamnia. There they established the Talmud and began to launch
Talmudic Judaism just as their brethren were launching Christianity. We
think of modern Judaic belief as centring itself on the Torah — the five
books of Moses — but this is not totally so. The religion pays relatively
little heed to the Torah: it is far more concerned with the Talmud, a
collection of writings which, in the wrong hands, are the edicts of Satan
himself. A parallel to this state of affairs can be found in modern
Christianity's almost exclusive concern with the writings of Paul (the false
prophet).
It was also at Jamnia that the canon of the Old Testament crystallized in
its present form. Until this time the faith and its Old Testament canon are
more legendary than real. This religion is not an older brother to
Christianity; they are twins. The only history of it extant today is that which
was created by the authors of Scripture: the rabbis at Jamnia formalized
legend into the canon of the Old Testament and then launched modern
Judaism. Later, the Massor-etes (as late as 500-900 CE) standardized the
text.



486 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
The Talmud was to be 'the fence around the Law'. Even more than the
Torah, it is elitist in the extreme, preaching a gospel of total annihilation of
the Gentiles by Israel. Now, if we set this in a future environment in which
not a single race but an entire species of mankind comprising 'all races' has
evolved above present-day man, this would seem understandable. It is,
after all, in the nature of things. But the fathers of modern Jewry regard it
as a promise made to them by God.
Those people who left Palestine at the time of the diaspora in 70 CE
moved to North Africa and then on to Southern Europe. We know them as
the Sephardim. As a so-called 'race' of people, they have absolutely nothing
in common with the Khazar converts to Judaism whom the world today
calls Jews. The centre of Tal-mudic Judaism being in Spain, the Sephardim
became literal prisoners to this doctrine of the chosen people. They
eventually found much more interest in culture than in religion. Being
much too urbane to take seriously the concept of a master race, these
people produced many great men of history — such as Christopher
Columbus and Benjamin Disraeli. When contact was finally made, the
Sephardim looked down upon what they perceived as the upstart uncultured
Khazars, whom they regarded as nothing more than untutored merchants
with a primitive zeal for the Talmud. Being products of a much harsher
environment, these Asiatic people soon swamped them. Now the world
sees only the Khazars when it thinks of Jews.
It is grim enough to consider that, under natural law and as part of
evolution, our entire species is to be wiped out and replaced. But inasmuch
as they anticipate this situation, the Talmud and many related documents
provide disastrous moral and religious justification for tribal elitism. Were
we to choose even a highly educated elite from any race on earth,
particularly one of high cultural attainment, sophistication and civilization;
and were we to give them the Talmud and Torah and elect them as 'God's
chosen people'; it would be just as ludicrous as to nominate a relatively
primitive Asiatic race of rapacious merchants as such. These statements are
either commonsense or shameless racism; they cannot be both. But you
must judge for yourself, for it is you who will pay. Caveat emptor. Not only
is this a recipe for the ultimate disaster, the entire concept is ludicrous
beyond words.
There are, at present, millions of Ashkenazic Khazars who believe
themselves to be God's chosen people. They await the imminent



YE BOOKE OF BELIAR YE SCRIVENER 487
arrival of their Messiah, who will lead them to dominate the entire world
and — in fulfilment of the Torah and Talmud — to utterly destroy the
Gentile nations. As they already have total control of the global financial
system, and effectively manage the governments of most if not all nations
through their domination of international finance, this unthinkable disaster
cannot be far away. And, strangely enough, they are themselves the first
nation destined for annihilation by the true Israel. The reader need only
consider these points:
1. Is the identification of the historical Jews as God's chosen people a
concept acceptable in a sane world?
2. Is this concept dead?
3. Is it imagined?
4. Is it most likely about to reach fulfilment?
On consideration it is my opinion that your safety is under such urgent
threat that you do not have time to read any further.
We seem to have found many answers by a very simple process. My
guidelines have been straightforward. I have ignored the miraculous on the
principle that the laws that govern our universe are never broken, though it
may seem so to us: this impression comes of ignorance of creation. On the
basis that the miraculous is delusory and that whatever answer remains
must be true, no matter how unlikely, we seem to have found the truly
miraculous.
It now becomes incumbent upon me to substantiate my claims in respect
of the above. For this purpose I rely on the excellent research done by
Douglas Reed in The Controversy of Zion.51
The point cannot be overstated: what Judaism terms 'the Law' is a
doctrine — in our time — of unimagined racial hatred and supremacy. If
this teaching is taken literally rather than seen in the broader context of
human evolution, and if 'the Jews' obtain the power they now seek, it is
certain that, like any other human tribe in their position, they will exploit
these resources to the full. This nation is no better or worse than any other,
but it is made extremely dangerous by the combination of their supremacist
doctrine and their power to put it into effect. One may amend this statement
by saying that it is not so much the stranglehold that they have over the
international banking system that is dangerous, it is the apathy of the
lumpenproletariat and the education of the intelligensia to the level of fools
that will be our undoing (see Romans 1: 21-23).



488 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Having earlier pointed out that the world is being conquered by an army of
bankers armed with nothing more than usury, and having gone into some detail as
to the pernicious nature of this modern financial sleight of hand, it may be argued
that these matters are too complex for the common man to understand. Nonsense! It
is simple, once one learns to ignore the economists. The Reserve Bank of New
Zealand makes the following statement:
...Banks do create money and credit, adding to broad measures of the money
supply.
The percentage of the money supply which is created by banks and other
financial institutions depends on the particular definition of the money supply
used. Notes and coins, the narrowest definition of money, are only issued by
the Reserve Bank. Commercial banks cannot print and issue currency.
However, notes and coins make up only a small proportion of broader
measures of money and credit — the majority being created by banks. A
commonly used definition of the broader money supply is M3, which includes
currency plus deposits at most financial institutions. In June 1994 M3 was $66
billion. Currency and primary liquidity issued by the Reserve Bank were
around $2 billion in June. Therefore around three per cent of M3 is created by
the Reserve Bank (currency and primary liquidity), with the remainder being
created by commercial banks.
Let me first of all affirm that this statement comes directly from the
horse's mouth, albeit the back end of the horse down under in New Zealand.
From it we may draw the following points:
1. A bank — commercial or otherwise — need only have a relatively small
reserve of cash to meet day-to-day demands. Loans are made with non
existent currency upon which interest is charged. Invariably only a small
percentage — if any at all — of a loan is withdrawn in notes. Thus, this
liquidity is substantially nonexistent funny money which accrues real
worth through interest. The small pool of real bills guarantees these
loans.
2. It will be recalled that, in the case of the US, even the official creator of
'real money' (the FED) is in private hands.
3. Ninety-seven per cent of New Zealand's cash is created by private hands.
With absolutely no outlay, this — through usury — accrues real assets.



YE BOOKE OF BELIAR YE SCRIVENER 489
4. Since currencies have been taken off the gold standard, it is open to
question as to whether even the other 3 per cent is real. The value of
gold and silver has not changed in hundreds of years. Only currency
in relation to them — rises and falls in value. Gold is the historical
measure of real worth, and today it will buy, in equivalent modern
goods, exactly the same as it purchased five hundred years ago.
Is it therefore not conclusive evidence of certifiable insanity to say that,
of all things, placing the production of money in private hands will not lead
to corruption? That this production is, throughout the globe, substantially in
the hands of Khazar Jews is a well-established fact.
Thus the prophecy is fulfilled. Their claim to being the master race
receives approbation from the sheer weight of apathy which lethargically
greets it with enthusiastic indifference to survival. Whenever before in
history did powerful nations such as the US and European countries fully
endorse the concept of an outsider being racially superior and actually aid
that nation in their own conquest, as has been the case with modern Israel?
According to the Law, Judah has no friends among the Gentiles. Friend
and foe, they are to be rooted out and destroyed on the basis that they are
not Jews, and for no other reason. But let us also remember that, as
witnessed by the Qumran War Scroll, God lends His hand to both the Light
and the Dark. Consequently we are all both the actors and the audience in a
macabre play, the object of which seems to be the preparing of mankind for
the real world.
The outcome is fixed: the Light shall put paid to the Dark. While men
have been endlessly dreaming of the Golden Age, God has been taking care
of the mechanics of such an outcome. Golden ages, peace and harmony,
love and understanding: if they are to be they require some practical and
real underpinning. On the principle that one rotten apple can turn the entire
barrel sour, the weak must be separated from the meek. Peace, love etc.
cannot exist in a vacuum; the ability to stare reality in the face is an
essential ingredient of any hope for the future. First of all, the required
genetic pool must be isolated, then stabilized and allowed to grow, this
being a task solely for God, not man. To this end, we may see that even
recent history acts in confirmation of this theory.
As has been said, once we begin to view the making of history as though
it were waves striking a shore, those waves are first heard,



490 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
then felt. If a particular one is negative, there is always plenty of warning.
The Bible says that God does nothing without telling us first, and the
Teacher is exactly such a messenger. The problem, put simply, is that
reaction when it is upon you is no reaction at all. It is a futile attempt at
survival against overwhelming odds.
Communism and Zionism were effectively the same wave, probably
originating with Calvin, whose philosophy gave voice to the Protestant
ethic and the materialist mentality. Over the centuries, that body of people
whom Rome had dismissed from Palestine, despite the efforts of Talmudic
Judaism, had begun to assimilate and was replaced by Khazar converts
who progressively became 'the Jews'. Taking upon themselves all that this
meant, they gradually increased their wealth and power until they took
greater and greater control of the finances of otherwise independent states.
Revolution and war became a tool in their hands, their loyalty being not to
their host country but to each other. They became the state within states,
setting their own law above all other.
The coming out of Zionism in 1896 was preceded by both the sublime
and the ridiculous. There were many who, with Christian zeal, concluded
that the reinstatement of the Jews in Palestine would herald the millennium,
and actively sought to aid that return. Some even set up funds to buy the
Holy Land back from the Turks. But even before this stupid indulgence,
men like Disraeli, John Adams, Edmund Burke, Michael Bakunin and
many others were warning against the progressively creeping cancer of
Zionism, the elitist religio-political philosophy that had become a hydra
like secret society. These men are now reviled as right wing anti-Semites,
as is anyone who supports their viewpoint — even though their warnings
have now become the bleeding obvious.
Who then is the enemy of Light and Truth? Not the Khazar, for we
would do the same in his shoes. It is lethargic, apathetic you and me. Who
is this evil Antichrist? He is the man next door who will only act when the
wave is upon him and he is deprived of food, shelter and procreation. Will
he pay for his wicked crimes against humanity? No: the dead feel nothing.
His life is but ballast in the hold of a ship long abandoned by its crew; he
goes willy-nilly where'er the prevailing tide commands. A bureaucratic
obeyer of orders and creator of regulations, he fears abandonment by the
system and seeks promotion and approbation from his peers. When the
truth is told, he is a coward who perpetually lives in fear, and he will
sacrifice anyone to his security. How can one do battle with



YE BOOKE OF BELIAR YE SCRIVENER 491
the dead? Only through true knowledge can we rise above the mataioo and
save ourselves.
Zionism is not new. It has been festering away for the past nineteen
hundred years or so, a legacy we are forced to accept as being left to us by
the Essenes, who were serving God by creating both the Light and the
Dark. The only real threat it ever faced was the emancipation of the
ghettoized Jews. Well-intentioned leaders who sought to free them and
give them equality were discredited, met with Jewish uprisings or faced
with the assassin's bullet. Isolation and vilification were essential to the
concept of racial supremacy and eventual election by God after an age of
preparation by Him. Apparent persecution will generate hatred; a supposed
history of suffering will engender vengefulness in anyone. But that
suffering was primarily inflicted by the rabbis, and history confirms this
conclusively. But for the concept of a captivity, there would be no people
to inherit the promise.
The further west one travelled from Russia, the greater was the degree of
emancipation. Even as late as 1945, the great lie of the Holocaust not only
served to purchase Palestine, it also forced liberal-minded Khazars back
into the ghetto mentality. Since then it is not only the Gentiles who are
reminded of Jewish suffering; the Khazar who would assimilate is
reminded of the evil depravity which only Gentiles can truly fathom. It is a
sad and horrible story to tell, for ultimately we see that this creature is as
much a victim as any other. When, under the leadership and instigation of
Theodor Herzl, the first world Zionist conference met at Basel in Switzer
land in 1897, it was not representative of world Jewry. In fact it met under
loud and considerable protest from the westernized brethren. The Zionism
that emerged at the end of the last century seemed somehow to win more
Gentile hearts than Jewish ones. Reed quotes Max Nordau, Herzl's first
lieutenant: 'Our people had a Herzl, but Herzl never had a people'. Again,
the Holocaust became an essential ingredient in the reghettoization of the
mind of its Western flock. This time Israel would become the supreme
ghetto, which would give the Jew a centre of power from which he might
rule the world. The Khazar, as becomes clear, was a captive in this plot.
That it should be they or, in fact, any other tribe was totally irrelevant from
the point of view of the plotters. The Dark had been rising for centuries; it
was not of this world and it cared for nothing and no-one at all.
The turn of the last century brought another of those waves. It



492 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
had been preceded by that of industrialization which, by necessity, had
made slaves of the people. All bowed down to the iron horse. The one of
which Herzl was a part was that of emancipation in general. Perhaps, as
some claim, there has existed and still does exist a secret society which is
the red hand of Edom. But if this is the case, and if it has the devastating
power and wealth with which this group is credited, we shall never know.
Most likely, generations of grubby little men with a love of money and
power and with absolutely no respect for human life have progressively
increased family wealth and power to a point never before imagined. And
as the Light side of the Force has worked through men of truth and gentle
spirit, the Dark has worked through these money-grubbing animals. It is the
continued presence of the Dark which has left the impression of ongoing
organization and purpose. It is a presumption to credit such people with
these long-term plans.
No doubt as power increases, human agencies will form alliances to
further promote materialist goals. But it is far too easy to grasp at the
minuscule and tangible when far greater forces are at work beyond our ken.
Everything moves in the shadow of tomorrow, and we mortals are a sorry
lot, egotistical and inconsequential links in the chain of creation. To say
that man is a wicked beast is to presume him sentient. Can we in honesty
apply the concept of judgement to a dog who consistently turns to his own
vomit? No. If we are to rise above this level ourselves, the most genuine act
of humanity must be to isolate and protect ourselves from him. The wolves
must be separated from the sheep at all costs, but is it just to focus upon the
coldness and hardness of men when they are only the children of a cold
hard universe?
Herzl obtained from Britain the offer of Uganda as a Jewish state. When
he presented this to the Sixth Zionist Conference, the vote was 295 in
favour and 175 against. The block of dissenting votes came from the
representatives of Russian Jewry, those conservative Khazars who had
remained closest to their roots. The emancipated Western Jew took a liberal
approach. The Russian — still the narrow-minded tent-making tribesman
— would not compromise. He would have Palestine or nothing. And, as
history tells us, the dissenters won the day. Russian Zionism, like its
Communist counterpart, succeeded solely, it seems, because no-one took it
seriously. It was at the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905 that Chaim
Weizmann defeated the Uganda proposal. Herzl, the man hailed as a
messiah, had contravened the first law: never compromise. He died a
broken



YE BOOKE OF BELIAR YE SCRIVENER 493
man at the age of forty-four. As has been quipped, the sum total of two and
two depends entirely on whether you are buying or selling.
Again, as Reed points out (page 208), even the Jews resident in Palestine
were in favour of the Uganda project. They declared their homeland to be
one of corpses and graves, and passion for Uganda generated in them a
hatred of their country. Ultimately the Jews went into captivity, this time to
imperialist Khazar Talmudic Zionism, the future world government which
has produced the modern Babylon in which we are all slaves. But the
division here was not between Khazars and Jews, it was between those
Asiatic converts who had become westernized liberals and the
fundamentalist tent-makers. This wave, first seen about a hundred years
ago, was the precursor of a tsunami which is now set to strike. The majority
of its victims will be the apathetic and the walking dead — again, God uses
the Dark to sharpen the Light. In perceiving order amid chaos, we must be
moved to pity for the Sons of Satan, for ultimately it is they who will
destroy the true Antichrists among us.
Two hundred years ago Western Europe was already making its mark
upon the world. Other cultures were being conquered and wealth was
pouring in. An arrogant and aggressive masculine world was being shaped,
a real world of industrialization and industrialism, and men were learning to
be its masters. They would progressively become the gods made flesh and
subsequently — in their own minds — replace God Himself. By the time
we arrive at the turn of the last century, the industrial revolution had con
firmed Western European man's omnipotence. He was now the physical
master of a material world. Out of this self-confidence, aided by an
awareness of capitalist excesses and inequality, there would spring
philosophies such as Communism — teachings that embraced anarchy and
that confidently set out to overthrow the old order and bring in the new.
This era had produced an entire army of nouveau riche merchants who,
through their banking and other skills, had become far wealthier than the
now decadent old aristocracy. This plethora of philosophical ideals leaves
an historical image of godless thinkers. It must have been the perfect
breeding ground for Zionism, which might be loosely termed the ultimate
indulgence of the merchant class.
This doctrine should in no way be confused with any sort of religious
belief. It is as political and as atheistic as Communism. It seeks — by its
own admission — to use gold as a means of infiltrating existing
governments and subverting them. Its object is to



494 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
set the people against their governments and to keep them in ferment and in
increasing confusion. Its purpose is to create, through the undermining of
the international banking and financial systems, a chaos that will drive the
world states into its arms. Ultimately it plans to govern the world of
inferior Gentiles from Jerusalem. Zionism is the ultimate imperialism, and
it will achieve its goals for a little while. It is the logical end to an age of
materialism. When this last dark empire collapses, the ordinary everyday
Khazars will be hunted down like dogs by the new Jews. It is also they
upon whom the old world will avenge itself.
Surely it must be possible for reasonable people — 'Jews' included — to
look at what is being said here and to understand that terms such as 'anti
Semitism' simply do not apply. We are looking at the mind of God, which
the Bible proclaims as being the source of both the Light and the Dark. The
Jews, in this instance, are perhaps much more the victims than are the so
called Gentiles. There seem to be no individuals. Mankind is in process of
creation; it has absolutely no right of judgement upon the Creator. And
after all, arguably, what we term history and reality are but thoughts pass
ing through His mind.
One of the tools exquisitely used by the biblical scribes is 'data of
comparable magnitude'; this is particularly the case in the New Testament.
In the parables, Jesus is seen to use simple analogies to convey complex
ideas. This subsequently produces a Jesus of the 'down home, good ole boy'
variety whom even the simplest of souls can relate to. But the genius in
using this process is that at the same time it conveys the most sophisticated
pagan concepts.
The mass of archaeological evidence obtained in the last twenty years or
so confirms the very late arrival of the Persian magi in Palestine. It is clear,
for example, from the discovery of a cave close to the Temple, in which
hundreds of shattered images of the Goddess Astarte have been found, that
the site of the shrine to Jehovah had long since been a place sacred to the
Queen of Heaven. No doubt the magi arrived in the company of an army
and a host of labourers. Having cleared it of its Goddess worship and
dumped the idols in the cave, they would have begun the work of building
the first and only Temple. Scholars have attempted to compensate for this
evidence by claiming that the original texts of Scripture probably contained
a fair amount of Goddess material but that this was edited out at a very late
stage. It is obvious from the evidence



YE BOOKE OF BELIAR YE SCRIVENER 495
of numerology that late editing — or indeed any sort of editing at all — is
absolutely out of the question.
The matter is deserving of a book in its own right, but suffice it to say
that the Bible and the Talmud not only predict the future but also set out to
create it. Our erstwhile magi, who many have so affectionately come to
think of as the harmless eccentric New Age vegetarian dreamers of dreams,
were men of power beyond our comprehension. They, in the image of God,
set in motion events that would bring about both the Light and the Dark
and culminate in the prophesied millennium at the end of this age.
Reaching this point in our understanding, we can only wonder at the
brilliance of the simplicity of it all. With a large part of our puzzle solved,
silent disbelief is our only reasonable response. All that was done in the
beginning was that a few basic premisses were shifted slightly off centre
and some new postulates established; in the then future, there would be
organizations like the Templars to make occasional adjustments, and
history would then proceed to logically write itself in the most illogical
manner.
More than two thousand years ago, a great Emett machine began to puff
and squeak, turn and grind, its cogs and wheels creating a symphony of
madness far greater than might have been dreamed up by Wagner. The sole
purpose of this great mechanical beast was the reaction of its onlookers as it
ground through time and devoured the souls of its hapless admirers.
Ultimately this insane cacophony would become the music to which the
Whore of Babylon would bump and grind. And, as slowly and seductively
she exposed and revealed her filthiness, it would be seen that she was,
herself, the sum total of the souls the machine had consumed.
In order to keep itself genetically and spiritually pure, the Israel of the
future would isolate itself from the rest of mankind — the Gentiles.
Foreshadowing this, traditional Israel established itself in a Pharisaic
isolationism within which it espoused and lived by the ultimate in
supremacist ideals. Originally it was the magi in the guise of these
Pharisees who requested Roman intervention in Judea. Thus Rome's
lancing of the cancer of elitism in the Judean province caused that cancer to
spread throughout the globe, this being exactly what was intended. This,
very likely, was mankind's first encounter with virtual reality.
So at this point in history twins were born. The one, Christianity, through
its general global acceptance, made its adherents incul-cators of the Mosaic
Law; and the other, Talmudic Judaism, made



496 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
captives of a group of people whom it would hold in a steel trap. It would
separate them from their fellow men and teach them that this separation
was a direct result of Gentile hatred of the Jews. They were taught
relentlessly — generation after generation — that they were 'called out' by
the Creator Himself. That there should one day come an actual and
genuinely superior breed of people in the future at whom this doctrine was
aimed never seems to have occurred to anyone. That this ultimate elitism in
the hands of just another human tribe should bring about the disaster now at
hand has gone unmentioned if not totally unnoticed. Ultimately, had the
racial elitism of the Talmudic Khazars been a purely political movement, it
would long since have been exposed and expunged. Were it to emerge in
the future as purely financial control of the world's governments and
economies, its declaration of power would simply be met by governments
ordering armies and police to close the banks, imprison the bankers and
confiscate their assets. With modern Christianity's de facto acceptance of
the Mosaic Law and its acknowledgement of Judaism as an elder brother,
there now exists a solid platform upon which an Israeli messiah might
proclaim himself to Christian and Jew alike and have the required ground
base from which real power can be established. But the true and real
foundation of this tragedy will be the apathy generated by the isolation and
alienation of the individual. No doubt this Antichrist will also find
countless adherents among atheists and agnostics who seek the
reinstatement of their, by then, endangered material gods.
As Douglas Reed points out (page 81) the Talmud began at Jam-nia and
Usha and went on to be completed at Sura and Pumbedita. It and its
expounders became the mobile government of the adherents of modern
Judaism. But more importantly the 'fence around the Law' became a fence
around the people; they were terrorized by it into submitting to the will of
Jehovah. This made the Jews — wherever they might be — an independent
self-determining nation within nations, a rule unto themselves, following an
entirely different path to the rest of mankind. The Gaonim (Babylonian
Talmudic princes) formed the Gaonate and their immutable Gaonic Res
ponses were both autocratic and patriarchal in the extreme. Reed refers to
this as 'an absolute despotism', and it certainly was. Again, the point must
be made that the vast bulk of the people were in fact a helpless and hapless
captivity, but they were captives to, and persecuted by, the princes of
Judaism.



YE BOOKE OF BELIAR YE SCRIVENER 497
When the Arabs moved to invade Europe, the Talmudists provided men
and money for the mission. After the conquest of Spain, Cordova became
the centre of Talmudism and of Talmudic government; unerringly they
sensed that Europe was the future theatre of global activity. These things
happened by God's will and for His purpose: the potter was moulding the
clay.
After nearly eight hundred years of rule, in 1492, the Moors were
expelled from Spain. So were the Jews, who were identified as part of — if
not masters of — this colonizing force. By this time the Jews, who at some
point could have found some direct lineage, both in blood and religious
belief, going back to the Palestine preceding the diaspora, had — in terms
of bloodline at least — been so watered down as to be termed nominal
blood descendants. Furthermore, they had not spread beyond the confines
of Western Europe and would have had little contact with those Khazars
who were living in and beyond the remote fastnesses of Russia.
But in 1492, inexplicably, the Talmudic government effectively
abandoned its western captives and moved to Poland, where it became
known as the Kahal. It drew its Russian Khazar converts like bees to a
honey-pot and, inasmuch as it was dealing with a more primitive and less
sophisticated people, the Talmudic entity within Poland was able to
exercise sufficient grip upon these converts to bring about a real state
within a state. The Polish centre somehow acted as a half-way house for the
Khazars, who were first drawn to it from the east and then went on to
financial conquest of the west. The objective achieved, in 1772 the Kahal in
Poland disbanded and became 'international'. In fact it went underground. It
is at this point that Europe and America began to experience sedition within
the ranks and revolution became a popular pastime. The exquisitely simple
role of the international banker was to generate animosity and then provide
money to both sides for the purchase of arms; in many cases he
merchandized the weapons too.
In the mean time the Khazars had derived enormous profits from their
involvement in the African slave trade, of which they controlled about 50
per cent. This historical fact alone denies them any sympathy for their
suffering. There will come a day when the collective crimes of these
merchants will be held up to scrutiny. It will be a day of shame, not only for
them, but for the 'Gentile' sycophants who wear Jewish suffering on their
liberal intellectual sleeves.
The Talmud may well be described as the most secret of the writings of
our age. Available translations have been sanitized, and



498 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
authors who have attempted to point out its virulently anti-Gentile and anti
Christian stance have been ostracized or dismissed as racists. Proof of the
Talmud's position may be found in the stating of the blindingly obvious,
viz.: If Judaism was to survive, it required adherents. This pernicious
tradition taught an elitist 'chosen-of-God' doctrine and maintained a flock
which was kept isolated from the rest of mankind. The Talmud provided
the necessary teachings of hatred of the outsider; it became the fence
around the mind.
From time to time the Jewish communities of Europe paid heavily for
their hatred when Gentiles attacked and let loose their own viciousness.
This, from the standpoint of the Talmudic princes, was a useful means by
which their doctrine might be justified in the eyes of the common man of
the ghetto. In the absence of a real war, a group of men might meet at the
local hostelry, soak up some alcohol, generate a bit of hatred, go to the
ghetto, burn some houses, kill a few men, rape some women and perhaps
even strangle a child or two. If the local priest valued his position he would,
no doubt, both praise and sanctify these acts of piety in the name of Jesus
on the next 'Sunday morning go-to-church'. That two groups of people
adhere to two separate and equally ridiculous sets of religious beliefs only
indicates the equally primitive nature of these gangsters. That they should
be constantly at each other's throats is obvious and predictable, particularly
when the smaller tribe was living within the territory of the greater. The
real problem is the primitive nature of both groups. Even forbidding their
fallacious beliefs would avail nothing: they would simply invent alternative
and equally false idols as vehicles for their naked aggression. But perhaps
this all creates an impression of a Russia and eastern Europe totally isolated
from the legends and dreams we have discussed. The secret doctrine in
Eastern Europe remains as strong as in any other part of the world today. In
fact the nature of language itself has strongly supported it.
All activity must be preceded by thought. This requires language, and it
in turn becomes the bordering and controlling factor setting the limits to
creativity. Language has thus given different nationalities specific
characteristics and created national personality and direction. The Polish
word 'rzetilny' may be translated as 'truth'; the Russian equivalent is
'rhetilny'. In fact it means much more than 'truth'. It may be said to mean
'profound' or 'spiritual' truth, implying 'the ultimate and unperceived
reality'. The Eastern European



YE BOOKE OF BELIAR YE SCRIVENER 499
languages have, by comparison with English, retained much of their poetic
or feminine expression. On the other hand English became the ultimate
mechanistic or masculine tongue.
It was for this reason — because their language forced it — that the
English, aided also by wealth from their empire, became the fathers of
mechanization and industrialization. They did not have a special genius;
they had the speech that allowed them to think the required thoughts.
Conclusion
With the completion of this section we may say that all our bases have been
covered. The Talmud and its history are notoriously as dry as bones; I have done my
best to minimize and maximize where necessary. The arguments were:
1. The Talmud obviously came out of the same stable as the Bible and the Scrolls.
2. It is without doubt — if taken racially — the most virulently racist and elitist
document ever written. It preaches the destruction of all the Gentiles.
3. It was used as a means of generating racial hatred among those it captured and
called Jews.
4. There was once a remnant of post-Roman Palestinians with some sort of blood
claim to an ancient Palestine who settled in Spain and Western Europe. These, the
Sephardim, are now effectively lost — certainly in terms of blood descendance
from an Israel which did not exist.
5. Late in European history, for no apparent reason, the centre of Talmudism moved
from Spain to Poland. This drew the Khazar converts from Russia into the country
as though they had passed through a door into Europe. (This was long after Russia
had conquered the Khazars, who were now living as Jews within her borders.)
6. With the formal admission that Auschwitz and Dachau were not homicidal
facilities, Zionism has actually and effectively admitted that the Holocaust never
happened. This hoax was a means of winning sympathy and understanding while
gradually accumulating power; it can now easily afford to abandon this legend of
suffering and persecution.
7. Given the economic strength of world Jewry and the power of modern Israel,
combined with the Talmud and the Bible teaching of Israel's supremacy before God,
this recipe for catastrophe on an unimaginable scale only requires the modern state
to find a messianic saviour. Given that so many other prophecies have been
fulfilled, this man's coming can be said to be certain.



500 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Isaiah 34: 8 reads:
For it is the day of the LORD'S vengeance, and the year of recompenses for the
controversy of Zion.
There is, perhaps, another way to tell this tale. Astarte Quadesh (Holiness) was
one of the true mothers of the ancient mother goddesses of the Middle East. She
was the bor (Hebrew: meaning 'hole' or 'cave') from which on 25 December
Christmas Day — the sun-god was born. But even so she remained a perpetual
virgin. Specifically she was a 'star' goddess and a goddess of 'the sea'. She being an
obvious prototype of Mary, her son would have been both a star and a fish, just like
Jesus the Teacher. Both Deuteronomy and II Kings tell of the destruction of idols
being ordered by God. This can have two opposing but complementary inter
pretations. In Pisces, the great solar phallic fish would stand triumphantly with one
foot firmly upon the shattered body of his mother/wife, proclaiming that he alone
was the creator of life. But, unbeknownst to him, the goddess was only sleeping.
One day the great hole from which he had emerged would consume him and feed
him to her children. Equally, it may be seen that it is as evil to make an image to our
Mother as to our Father, for they are one.
Put much more simply, after pressure had built up for some considerable time,
due to the overlapping of the sun's polar and equatorial magnetic fields, in 440 CE
there began a reversal of those fields (see pages 268-269 of The Mayan Prophecies).
This coincides precisely with the time that madness really got under way on earth.
That which happens in the above must likewise occur in the below.
Two thousand years ago a mountainous stone was rejected by the temple builders
and cast into the Piscean sea. Since then it has sat unperceived beneath the watery
deep of the word of God — the universal unconscious. The subsequent tidal wave
that was then set in motion is now almost upon us as a great and cleansing flood.
So shall the prophecy be fulfilled: the solar serpent will rise up from his death
upon the tree. As in Genesis 3: 5, mankind will inhabit a garden of Eden and the
serpent feed them the fruit of that tree. As it is written! Then your eyes shall be
opened, and ye shall be as gods...

In the Beginning
Long ago and far away in Wellington, New Zealand, I sat one night with a
Russian friend and listened to some old tales of the eastern European
dreamtime. Later, in Australia, my secretary, who is from Poland,
reminded me of one of these fables, one she knew from her childhood story
books. Briefly, the story runs as follows:
Vasilisa's young mother lay upon her deathbed while the girl and her
father offered up prayers that she might find peace and safety in the other
world.
The dying mother called to her daughter and pulled a small doll from
under the bed cover. Her parting words were: Take this doll, my darling,
and always keep it with you. Should you ever be in need of help or
guidance, it will tell you what to do. Share a little of your bread with her
and never tell anyone that you have her.
The child and her father mourned the passing of the woman for a long
time, but he eventually met and married a widow with two daughters of
similar age to Vasilisa. Unbeknownst to and unsuspected by her father, the
widow and her children were jealous of the young maid's sweetness and
treated her cruelly. Ultimately, they plotted her destruction by letting the
fire go out and sending her to the old crone Babayaga to fetch fire, knowing
all the while that she would kill and eat her.
Innocently, she set off into the wood at night to fulfil her task, but as she
journeyed she became more and more afraid. Needing to be comforted, she
reached into her pocket and held the doll her mother had given her.
Magically, her heart lightened and she felt a skip in her step. The doll also
directed her feet to Babayaga's hovel, the fence of which was surmounted
by human skulls that gave off an eerie light. As she approached the
ramshackle hut, a white knight upon a white horse went cantering by and it
became day. Then a red knight on a red horse came rushing past and the red
sun glowed in the sky. Soon afterwards there came a black knight upon a
black horse and it was night again.
When the old crone stepped from her cauldron and confronted young
Vasilisa, she looked as decrepit, ugly and dirty as her hut. In a fearsome and
hissing voice the old witch cried 'What do you want here child?' The girl
replied 'Oh wise grandmother, my family are



502 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
cold. I have come for fire.' Babayaga replied 'And why should I give fire to
a foolish child?' The doll instructed her young mistress to respond 'Because
of the asking, Grandmother.' Any other answer would have been met with
her instant death.
The child was told by the hag that she must work for the fire and began
to set her many tedious tasks, some of them impossible to perform. But
Vasilisa had no need to worry for, as she slept, the doll completed them.
One such chore was to sort — grain by grain — the mildewed corn from
the good. Its grinding was performed by three pairs of hands that worked as
though they were part of an invisible body.
The little maiden ultimately proved herself capable and wise beyond her
years, and the old witch gave her a skull filled with fire and sent her on her
way. Following the instructions given by the doll, she came closer and
closer to her home. She nevertheless became more and more afraid of the
eerie light that shone from the eyes, ears, nose and gaping mouth of the
skull; but it assured her she should continue as she had nothing to fear.
The wicked stepmother and her two daughters were aghast to see
Vasilisa return with fire. They had believed her long since dead. The skull
watched every move of the evil trio, and by the dawn of the new day it had
burnt them all to cinders.
Vasilisa's real mother is the White Goddess, who dies at the end of
Aries/dawn of Pisces. The doll is her spirit, which her daughter keeps in her
apron pocket, close to her genitalia; and none must know of its existence.
Thus the doll is both the spirit of, and the genitalia of, the Goddess and
the tree. It gives instructions by becoming excited and jumping up and
down. The stepmother and her two daughters are the Triple-headed
Goddess/Lilith (formerly a wife of Adam) in the Piscean Age. Vasilisa is
the not yet mature Goddess of the Aquarian tree. She goes into the
underworld to fetch fire (the sun) because the people of our era are without
the warmth of Light. Clearly, from the actions of Lilith, they want neither it
nor her.
The Babayaga is the Goddess in her death aspect — the cauldron to
which we must all return. The three knights play a dual role. White, red and
black signify Vasilisa's passing through time into the land of the dead,
where she is held prisoner for a while. The horsemen — similar to those of
the apocalypse — are white/albino for the Teacher, red for the sun in the
tree, and black for the Wicked Priest. The three disembodied pairs of hands
that



IN THE BEGINNING 503
grind the corn (prepare wisdom) are the three brothers: John the Baptist,
the Teacher and the Messianic King Jesus. The skull with the fire is the
dead but reborn sun: the reader may recall my references to the Templar
use of the skull and crossbones as a device. And when the new day dawns,
the sun in Aquarius destroys the wicked Pisceans.
These stories are multidimensional and much more complex than my
analysis would allow. Suffice it to say: As in the Great Mind above, so in
the human mind below.
To recapitulate, the evidence so far tells us that, in the last centuries
before our era, the original inhabitants of Palestine were made captives and
converts to emerging Judaism by the Persian magi. No doubt these
conversions extended to Egypt, Greece and other areas where large
Jewish/Israelite communities were created before the Christian era. The
magi may well have brought their own army of proselytes from Persia
itself. When Rome destroyed Jerusalem in 70 CE this 'nation' of religious
Israelites was scattered. They settled in North Africa and drifted into
Western Europe after moving into Spain with the Moors. In that country
they showed little or none of the inclination toward business that is
generally seen with the modern Khazar Jew. Comparatively speaking they
were, in fact, an aristocratic people who, when they came into contact with
the later converts from the Caspian Sea, would have nothing to do with
them. They would not intermarry with them or even recognize them as
brethren. At this point the Sephardim — if it is sensible to speak of
bloodline — had long since mixed that blood with that of Western Europe
and South America.
It may be emphasized that Jewish and Israeli academia formally accepts
that the Khazars have contributed to the present stock. But to what degree?
The answer to this question will be found in asking another: What
happened to the Sephards? History shows that at one stage, while they
occupied Spain and Portugal, their convert brethren spread through the rest
of Europe, being brought there by conquerors who used them as tax
farmers. They robbed the people and then the king robbed them. In 1290
Edward I of England began another wave of expulsions, which the rest of
Europe followed. Spain was the last to expel her Jews. She did so — in
1492 — because of pressure from the Church, applied, perhaps, because of
a Merovingian connection. It seems that at this point there was no
distinction made between these two completely separate groups.
Europe's Jews were generally given the option of conversion



504 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
before they were deported. By and large the Russian faithful declined and
the Sephards accepted. Nevertheless, more than 300,000 were driven out
from Spain in 1492. In 1502 there began a mass migration of Spanish Jews
to the newly opened territories in South America, while others settled in
Italy. Many of those who went to the Americas interbred with the natives
and established the class known as mestizos. A census taken in 1545
showed that half the population of Mexico City was Sephardic. One such
was the Archbishop of Mexico, Francisco de Vitoria.
The Jews of Spain were a highly cultured people, while the Asian
converts were Mongoloid tribesmen who sought the respectability of
marriage with them, though with little success. On this basis alone, the
contribution of the Sephards to modern Jewish stock can be said to be
minimal. One might be generous and say that a little fewer than 5 per cent
have some original blood. The Israeli historian Nathan M. Pollock has
claimed that nine out of ten Jews worldwide are directly descended from
the fierce tribes that roamed the steppes of southern Russia.
Because of the inaccessibility of the former Soviet Union, scholars seem
a little at odds over specific dates. I personally tend to rely on Arthur
Koestler, who had a proven academic record and who was, incidentally,
himself an Asiatic Jew. Some sources give the year 965 CE as being the date
when they, under King Bulan III, experienced defeat for the first time in
five hundred years, at the hands of Prince Sviatoslav of Kiev. Pollock
argues that constant attacks on Russian territory by these tribes, who were
by then Hebrew-speaking, might have given rise to traditional Russian anti
Semitism. Their conversion to Judaism had taken place circa 740 CE, and
Pollock says the empire was finally destroyed in 1239 by the Mongols
under Batu Khan. The drift of these people into Russia and Europe had, by
then, long since become historical.
It has been pointed out by the learned Rabbi Louis Finkelstein that
Judaism, Pharisaism and Talmudism became medieval Rabbinism, which in
turn became its modern counterpart. It retained Pharisaism as its spirit, and
this was itself based on what was known as the tradition of the elders
(Talmudism). It would have been this severe and extreme doctrine that
appealed to the primitive and unsophisticated Russian tribesmen. Elements
of the Talmud such as the following would have encouraged this warlike
people to pit themselves against Christianity:



IN THE BEGINNING 505
Schabbath XIV says that Jesus was the son of a prostitute.
Zohar III (282) has it that Jesus died as a beast and was buried in a dung
heap.
Abhodah Zarah (15b) accuses Christians of bestiality, in that they have
intercourse with animals.
Zohar II (43a) says that 'extermination' is a necessary sacrifice.
I am aware of trying to take the reader through a time warp, but is it not logical
that a latter-day Teacher would contrast the false Israel with the new and
true? Is it possible that the Bible records this, or on the basis of the
following, should it be banned as anti-Semitic?
Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn
from the truth — Titus 1:14
Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye
have delivered: and many such like things do ye — Mark 7: 13
Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was
a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no
truth in him. When ye speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar,
and the father of it — John 8: 44
The virulent nature of the Talmud is such that its doctrine is beyond the grasp of
most people. These writings are very rarely found in non-Jewish hands, and indeed
it is said in the Talmud itself that any Gentile reading it must be put to death
(Sanhedrin 59a).
It must be emphasized that law of any kind is 90 per cent interpretation, but there
are many elements of these writings that would be criminal and filthy in any hands.
Abhodah Zarah 37 says that a Gentile girl over three years of age may be
violated.
Choszen Hamiszpat says a Jew may treat a Gentile female as he would a piece
of meat.
Gad. Shas. 3: 2,7 says a Jew may violate a Gentile girl but is forbidden to
marry her.



506 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
If, as many Bible students believe, the Antichrist will begin as a man of
God emanating from modern Khazar Israel, the Church has reason to be
concerned by the Talmudic teachings of Josiah to Rabbi Abarbanel, in
which it is said that, when the King Messiah declares himself, he will
destroy Rome and make a wilderness of it. The Pope's palace will sprout
thorns and weeds. He will then declare war on non-Jews and overpower
them. He is to slay them in masses, kill their kings and lay waste their land.
He will instruct his people to take as prize the gold and silver of the
Gentiles.
I can only re-emphasize that my own view is non-partisan: it is
blindingly obvious that these documents emerged some nineteen hundred
years ago specifically to create — in due time — 'that dreadful day of the
Lord', their sole purpose being the catastrophic evolution of mankind. As
though in cynical confirmation of this, the Bible relates the story of the
birth of Benjamin, the last of the sons of Jacob. He was the only one born
in the promised land and the only one after God changed Jacob's name to
Israel. Benjamin means 'son of my right hand'. It will be recalled that the
hand symbolizes the sun; he is therefore the only true son of the sun. He
was born to Rachel (Arachne) near Bethlehem (the house of wisdom),
where she died and was buried. She originally named him Ben-oni (Genesis
35: 18), which means 'son of my sorrow'. 'Rachel' means lamb (Israel are
sheep and the magi are shepherds); thus she is the self-sacrificing Goddess,
who, by coincidence, of the twelve sons of Jacob was mother only to
Benjamin and Joseph (the sun).
In the Old Testament ten tribes are lost. They are banished by God
because they fail to live up to His expectations. Like Jesus the Teacher they
are imperfect: his disciples, it will be recalled, will do greater things than
he. Likewise, though Moses led the children of the stone to the promised
land (Jacob means stone), he was not allowed to enter it; it was Joshua, the
Messianic King, who brought them home. The theme is repeated when, in
II Samuel 7: 2 and I Chronicles 17: 1, David the Teacher conceives of and
prepares to build the Temple, but it is his son Solomon (the Wicked Priest)
who actually does it. In I Chronicles 22: 8 and 28: 3 God tells David he
must not do the building because he has been a man of war and has shed
blood abundantly: he was not of the perfect peaceful Israel to come.
Solomon means 'man of peace'. He builds the Temple, but he becomes the
Antichrist man of war, and it is thus destroyed. Israel still has a long way to
go.
This gives us some grasp of how subtle the Antichrist will be:



IN THE BEGINNING 507
he will lead ten of these new tribes astray and, like the Gentiles (present
day humanity), they will be lost forever.
Perhaps this matter will become clearer if we look at the more recent
historical and geopolitical picture.
The emergence of the term 'anti-Semitism' was synonymous with the
birth of Marxism, which, capturing the Russian federation, kept the history
of the Khazars out of sight and out of mind. This is yet another of history's
amazing coincidences. These events — minor ones as it would have
seemed at the time — provided the impetus and means for the rise of
Zionism and the concept of eretz Israel.
The term 'anti-Semitism' was coined in 1880 by W. Marr in an article
titled 'Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte'. Later that year Wilhelm Sherer
used it in an article that appeared in Neue Freie Presse. In its original
meaning the term did not express race hatred but antagonism towards the
involvement of Jews with Marxism and revolution. Previously and
historically, the term 'Shemitic' or 'Semitic' referred to the forty-three
language groups that make up the Arab world, a coinage of Professor
August Ludwig Schlosser of Gottingen University. Because Jews had a
dominating control of publishing in the late 1880s, they were able to
influence the dictionary development of the word 'anti-Semitism'.
It seems very likely that early Jewish Communists may have had an
almost messianic view of Marx's doctrine as a means of global domination.
In 1883 Polish Jews established the Organization for the Emancipation of
Labour. Later, Polish and Lithuanian sectarians formed the Bund. Polish
Khazars held the first (world) Communist Party conference at Minsk and
elected the first ever central committee. The first attempt at revolution in
Russia took place in 1905 while the Russians were engaging the Japanese
in the Pacific. The leader of this failed coup was a Rabbi known later as
Sydney Hillman. He subsequently fled to England and then migrated to the
United States, where, in 1921, he founded the Communist Party of that
country. The suppression of the 1905 attempted coup was later exploited by
Zionism as an expression of Russian anti-Semitism. In 1919, after the
successful Russian revolution, the Rabbi Judah L. Magnes, speaking to a
New York audience, said:
Revolutionists, socialists, bolshevists, majority or minority socialists, under
whatever name we may call them, are Jews, and they are to be found in every
revolutionary movement as leaders or propagandists.



508 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
About 5 per cent of the Russian population was Jewish, but they made
up 97 per cent of the governing bodies of the Soviet Union. The
Communist revolution was indeed Jewish. Lenin ruled with twenty-four
deputies, all of whom were Jews. The weight of evidence suggests that
Lenin himself was not, but his wife — Krupsakaya — certainly was. Stalin
also married a Jewess.
This information is largely taken from issue 251 of Common Sense. The
relevant article goes on to say that, of the 7,800,000 Jews in Russia in 1933,
one-third were engaged in government administration. The article was
written by Benjamin H. Freedman, a Khazar Jew. As I have said before,
there has been no shortage of these people who have spoken out. The
shortfall has been in mature adults — Jews and Gentiles — who would
listen. But ultimately, as truth forces itself upon us, most will close the
stable door after the horse has bolted. In Genesis 25: 23-26 we find the
following. We need know only that Esau is Edom and Edom means 'red'.
And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner
of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be
stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins
in her womb.
And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called
his name Esau.
And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel;
and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she
bare them.
Communism has been universally associated with the colour red. Jacob took
hold of Esau's heel as they were born, and Nostradamus says the Teacher
will manifest after the demise of this doctrine. The Bible is, as I have said, a
highly complex version of the prophecies of Nostradamus. In Romans 8: 29
we read:
For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the
image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
At the propitious time, the masters of the Talmud engaged in some extraordinary
sleight of hand, the Jewish rabbit of western



IN THE BEGINNING 509
Europe disappeared and — 'abba' debareqi'a' — from the east came a brand
new one which, lo and behold, we are told is exactly the same rabbit. That
history, in our age, has had two completely separate sets of Jews seems to
have been overlooked or suppressed.
Behind this picture of how modern history was written and shaped by a
small secret body of what we may now term 'the priests of the Talmud',
there lies a fascinating story. The ghetto Jews were taught, as part of their
doctrine of racial supremacy, that the written Torah was an inferior Law
shared with the Gentiles. It was claimed that there existed within it a secret
and hidden Torah available only to the Jews. It was from this concept that
there arose 'The Secret Doctrine': the cabala. Strangely enough, as has been
shown here, they were absolutely right: there are mysteries hidden in
Scripture, hidden until the coming of the real Israel. Knowing this, why did
the rabbis permit the insanity to continue?
At this point we are forced to see a fundamental principle by which the
Dark sharpens the Light. Those Jews who we know as the Sephardim, and
who later appeared as the Morrano Christian converts of Western Europe,
were abandoned by the Talmudic princes. Later the Khazars, a
comparatively primitive, very aggressive people from a harsher landscape,
become the captives of these princes. Thus the people we identify as the
historical Jews are not the point at issue. They are as much exploited as any
others in this theatro tragico. The Dark has manifested itself in a small
number of evil men who have passed on a legacy of destruction from one
generation to another. First as princes of the Talmud and then as kings of
our modern Babylon, they seek to fulfil the edict of Deuteronomy 7:16-24:
And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall
deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve
their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.
If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I
dispossess them?
Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD
thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;
The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders,
and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God
brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom
thou art afraid.
Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they
that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.



510 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a
mighty God and terrible.
And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and
little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field
increase upon thee.
But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them
with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.
And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their
name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until
thou have destroyed them.
In the name of sanity and all that is decent I must appeal to the reader's
commonsense. If this is a doctrine which an utterly insane creator has given
as nothing more than a raffle prize to some randomly chosen tribe of
present-day humanity, not only we but the universe as a whole are in very
serious trouble. If, for some reason, it has chosen itself as this monstrous
Israel, and if — as is certainly the case — they are on the verge of
achieving the power to fulfil these edicts of destruction upon all mankind,
where is your future or that of your children? I must insist that, upon
empirical evidence alone, the only reasonable explanation is that of
spiritual evolution. The whole point of it being presented to us as a virtual
fait accompli is that, by being pressured in the face of that reality, as many
of us as possible might individually make that leap from beast to Israel.
Ironically, fear of facing what the truth can bring is the sole generator of
inactivity, whereas truth itself is an impenetrable armour. But there is so
much more than just empirical evidence to hand.
The subsequent history of our century is a sad tale told by men of
cunning to a world of dolts. The question arises again: Who are the guilty
parties? I hear a voice from within saying 'You, all of you'. A handful of Dr
Mesmers have entranced us with a lie. And who is to blame? Obviously not
the bulk of people we know as the Jews. The still small voice blames you
and me. And who will pay? This whisper now becomes the roar of an angry
bull, yet its expression is measured. Deep within it holds its own sorrow.
The utterance is unholy, even though wisdom speaks. Each man sells his
life to his fear; the coward lives a tortured life and dies a torturous death.
In composing this text I have attempted to refer only to the most
commonly known myths and legends. To my chagrin I have been



IN THE BEGINNING 511
surprised to find, since the publication of the first edition of this book, that
so many of us have lost touch with even these. God has, in fact, been
totally successful in scattering the power of the holy and sacred feminine
within us all. There is a lot of which I might have spoken that would have
taken us even closer to identifying our heroes, but a voice within says no.
In fact, it is not the scientific but the empirical evidence that is significant
here. Commonsense must prevail. The pattern — extremely unlikely as it
may seem — is far too complete, far too detailed to be denied, even though
denial is an important initial part of the process of mourning the death of
the old. When anyone speaks a truth, it is not they — the individual
speaking. And when that truth is heard and perceived, it is not the
individual hearing it. It is God speaking to God; the Creator knowing itself.
We as individual entities are irrelevant in this process. We are only the
neurons within the Great Mind in self contemplation.
Love is the nature of this process. Love is, love was and love will be.
God is love that had no beginning. And when all is ended, the essence
distilled from creation will be perfect love. If we could hear its voice, we
would hear the voice of a mist. Eerie and intoxicating, gentle but with
irresistible power, its words falling like rain: I am that which IS within you.
Wherever you hide I will find you. I will take you to my breast and suckle
you or I will destroy you. I will take you as my lover, draw your seed and
then devour you. I am love that touches the heart like a feather and
consumes men like a ravenous beast. I am virgin, I am whore, I am a child
and a toothless crone. I am love, I am free, I was in the beginning: I AM.
Ah, that the thought would fly from this poet's mind. He would give you
wings that you might rise as an eagle and circle the sun. And as you settled
upon some craggy peak, the fire of freedom would burn deep within your
breast and consume you in its flame. From your smouldering ashes would
come the resurrection of love, beautiful love. As at Pasca and Natale, we
die to be born again. It is our destiny to be free, to be love.
But for now, as it was spoken by Paul, we see through a glass darkly. At
midnight, a fiery moon shines down upon sea and shore. A silhouette
appears upon the water — a longboat with its oarsman at the rear. At the
prow, a lady stands, her hair gathered behind her head, a silken green cloak
falling from her shoulders to the floor. Her gaze, unmoving, is set upon the
landing ahead. The boat beaches and the ferryman is quick to aid his
mistress. Upon



512 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
stepping ashore she is bathed in fiery light. With regal purpose she walks
on. Her hair silver, the ageing is her name. Her face, young and beautiful,
almost that of an impish child; her eyes, deep, warm and wise. Her bearing,
that of a Celtic queen. Morgana is her name.
Ahead of her, a sandy carpet made fiery red by moonlight rises into the
distance. My Lady Morgana mounts the steps of the stairway to the moon.
With only a fleeting glance she is gone. Love, like a child in sorrow, falls
to its knees at the edge of the sea. Bereft, bewildered and beyond tears, it
beseeches her return. Such a great loss, and so sad that it must grow old
alone.
In the end, though, there is only contradiction. Even though you may
disagree with the thesis, you must be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of
the contents of this epistle unto the Babylonians. But without your stopping
thinking and starting being, it is but a tale told by an idiot. My thoughts are
then nothing but wasted seed. Without your opening the womb of your
mind, there is no planting. But without the seed of truth for the plantation
of trees with roots extending to the watercourse that they may grow and be
perceived, the womb of your mind will be barren; it will wither and die
without issue and without inheritance.
Perhaps the reader will allow another childhood memory. Both my
nanny and her husband were Italian. Consequently, and ironically, I learned
to read, write and speak Italian before I mastered my native English. The
old man and I were extraordinarily close. Each evening after meal time he
would take out a copy of an Italian language newspaper and call me to him.
'Come, my eyes are old and yours are new: read the paper for me.' His eyes,
it transpired, were at least as good as mine, but by this process he taught me
to read Italian, and also gave me a very early awareness of social and
political events. At the end of each evening one article would stimulate a
debate, and the old man would always leave me with a thought or a
question to take to bed.
Of all the newspaper stories I read there is only one that I remember
vividly. It reported events of the Hungarian revolution, when the Russians
returned with a full complement of heavy armour. The photograph showed
a demolished Russian tank in the middle of a city street. Though unseen,
scattered beneath and around it were the remains of a fourteen-year-old
Hungarian school-girl. She had tied explosives around her waist and thrown
herself under the tank. No doubt history can reveal many such heroes and
heroines, for whom freedom was the breath of life



IN THE BEGINNING 513
itself. The accumulated blood of these human beings is gathered in one
voice, and it cries out against us. It must and it will be avenged; this is a
fundamental principle upon which the universe exists. Can you be sure that
the blood of so many like that young girl will not one day be upon your
head and your hands?
My early access to European language and culture made me an exile
among my own people. The English somehow always appeared to me to be
a relatively passionless nation. It would seem that the most curious and
extraordinary thing, so totally feminine in its supposed illogicality, is the
idea of the Teacher being a child of Babylon — England. All the bad blood
of Europe, from the Romans to the Vikings, the Saxons and the Normans,
was used to form this iron beast we call the English — foreigners to
Britain's shores. That they perpetrated the same evil against those they
drove out to Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall as they did in foreign
lands is often overlooked. That these are English colonies, just as all of
Britain is a colonized land, is rarely seen.
The evidence, best left unstated, tells us that memory is genetic. Like the
Great Christian King whose blood is the true blood royal, Merlin awakens
to an ancient and primeval memory of tomorrow. It is the destiny of the
three brothers, long since parted, to meet again. And in their meeting the
standing stones of old Albion will quiver, the cry of the banshee will shatter
the silence of night and, upon the hill where the ghosts of Druids long since
departed still watch over the people, the whisper in the mists will be heard:
'It is done'. The joining of their hands will complete the golden circle of
time. Together they will raise an ensign for Israel: the circle quartered by
the cross, the sign of the Sons of Light. The spirit of the Druid still stands
upon the hill and watches as an eagle guards her egrets. It watches over the
three brothers, feeding them corn and serving them water. There is a
knowing and understanding in these Old Ones; the need for vengeance for
which their blood cries out has long since risen up to the seventh heaven. It
is done, and in just a little while there shall be no more sorrow, no more
crying and no more pain. The altar of God repaired, He and His bride will
dwell among us and heaven and earth will be joined as one.
Many tens of thousands of words ago, you and I set out upon a Grail
Quest. While I am aware that we have found more questions than answers, I
nevertheless am confident that I did not mislead you in my initial invitation.
Unfortunately, you will have formed some kind of impression of your Grail
companion and guide. But



514 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
if you are to hold this sacred chalice in your own hands, it is important that
I obliterate any personal impression I might have made. Our only concern
is the cup of truth. If you should find a reflection of me or anyone at all in
the sacred drink, then it is obviously tainted and not fit for your
consumption. It may well be that you perceive in myself someone schooled
in the occult, an initiate from a school of eccentrics. I never was and never
will be. Yes, I am touched by what I have seen, and my personal Grail
Quest has changed me considerably over the years, but I have been too
busy cooking to eat. Furthermore, I never was one for joining: humans
make me nervous.
More seriously, I might have given you the impression that I have some
personal vendetta against traditional religion. I do not participate in any
formal worship and am not involved with it in any way; it is just another
human activity I ignore. We have been searching for truth; it is sacred and
all can be sacrificed to it. If traditional belief must fall victim to it, then
sooner or later it will. In all its varied forms, it seems to me just another
type of witchcraft and primitive indulgence. In that it distracts us from the
truth, I would cheer its destruction. Otherwise, I would simply not give it a
second thought. I personally seek a massive injection of God as an antidote
to the sickness of my own evil. A placebo will not cure me.
That which concerns me most is my being open to the accusation that I
am anti-Semitic. This, more than anything, may distract us from our search
for truth. For all that you know, I could well be a Jew. I have certainly lived
among them, as I have among other cultures. I am not a member of any sort
of political party or organization. I know no-one who expresses racist
views. I hold such people in absolute contempt. Racism of any kind is a vile
and disgusting aspect of human behaviour. I have experienced profound
and deep friendships, as much among Jews as any other culture. I am
neither for nor against them; there are only individual people. There is one
God and we are all His children. But for all that may be said, I claim for
myself the right to search for truth. If, in the process, I offend you, I can
only do so if you are living a lie. Christian or Jew, I suspect that you are.
And with those lies, you are destroying each other and would include me if
I allowed.
I wonder if I exceed the bounds when I say that I see sickness and
insanity on a grand scale, human beings suffering where no suffering is
needed. Christian and Jew, a plague on both your



IN THE BEGINNING 515
houses. There is no doubt in my mind that each and every one of you who
spills human blood — for whichever block of wood you worship — will
come before your maker and pay the last penny. In failing to perceive the
mystery of life, you have failed to see its holiness. In so doing you may not
answer to man, but you will certainly answer to God. As it was spoken by
the prophet Ezra, on that day all will be seized with panic; truth will be
hidden and the land barren of faith; the sun will shine by night and the
moon by day, blood will trickle from wood, stones will be heard to speak
and the stars will change their courses. When seas hurl up their fishes an
unknown voice will be heard by all at night; the earth will break open and
fire come out of her; all hope and labour will fail.
The most relevant factor in our Grail Quest is not that we have found the
truth. I would say with confidence that this book contains its share of errors
and oversights. The purpose of our quest is to show the Creator our desire
to know the truth. Only by His grace can we hope to find it. It comes from
Him; no human endeavour can hope to achieve it. Only when we abandon
the idols of our hearts can the truth flow through us. We must invoke and
rekindle our sense of wonder as to the magic and mystery of the experience
of living. Behind the metaphors we have investigated lies an awareness of
great personal power, that which comes with knowledge. Beyond that is a
sense of being, actively living. And within that lies love and respect for all
of creation. Truth gives real life to the living; we feel without touching, see
without looking and listen in the silence.
As far as hidden mysteries in Scripture are concerned, there are a few
texts where the most profound and eternal truths lie openly upon the
surface. One such example is Matthew 5: 3-11:
Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they
shall be filled.
Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is
the kingdom of heaven.



516 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and
shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
According to tradition, and quite rightly so, there is no greater treasure
than the mysteries of God. By His grace and lovingkindness I have tasted
some of this precious fruit. That which I hold most dear is the knowledge
that Christ, the spirit of our mother, is returning now. In Revelation 21: 1-7
John had a vision which refers to the time of the new heaven when there is
'no more sea', at the end of Pisces, an event that will bring everlasting
unity, peace, brotherhood and justice. This heaven on earth will, through
the millennia, grow in intensity as all the diminishing times of darkness are
brought to an end: 1 can, for myself, say with certainty that we are at the
end of the beginning:
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from
God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the taber
nacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall
be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be
no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any
more pain: for the former things are passed away.
And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, 1 make all things new.
And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the begin
ning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of
the water of life freely.
He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God,
and he shall be my son.
And so, fellow knight, our Grail Quest is concluded, even though the
journey has only just begun. Henceforward we must travel alone. My
promise kept, I bid you go in grace where the corn grows tall and strong.
Where the tree stands without pruning and the wind can sing its song.
Where nature's mighty orchestra plays its symphony of thunder, rain and
lightning, and the sunset on the sea. To the dawning of that summer day,
the still upon the lake. And the rainbow-road to heaven that we will surely
take...



Appendix I
The data in this appendix have been taken from The Shorter Works of Ivan
Panin, distributed by the Association of the Covenant People, P. O. Box
1478, Ferndale, Washington 98248, USA. My object in quoting directly
from his work is to lend currency to an extremely eccentric argument. This
has been the case with much of the material quoted or referred to
throughout the text. But it should be understood that the argument is only
eccentric because we have chosen to ignore a very real aspect of Scripture.
Investigation of Bible numerology is barred to no-one, though there is a
need for a basic understanding of biblical languages. Numerology can only
be derived from text in its original form.
While the contents of this appendix are but a mere scratching of the
surface, I take them to be absolutely conclusive and irrefutable proof of the
points set out below:
1. Any religious division of the Old and New Testament is artificial, all 66
books being tightly bound together.
2. The existence of numerology throughout the entirety of Scripture is con
clusive evidence of its pagan origins and — under the circumstances
can be taken as an Essene/Qumranite signature of authorship.
3. Any suggestion of historicity, no matter how much this may be debated,
is out of the question. All 66 books must have been written in conjunc
tion with each other.
4. There is no question in my mind that the Bible was inspired by God. But
this, as I have said, is to insist that He is philosophically pagan.
5. That the gathering of the books was in any way randomly done by other
wise ignorant clerics in Rome is out of the question. Numerology in
Scripture is evidence that the Church was for many centuries controlled
by the spiritual descendants of the Essenes, at least until the final canon
was established.
6. Not one scrap of text has been added or taken away since its conception. It
remains to this day a perfect mathematical whole.
7. It is not a religious toy; it is a profound and highly complex scientific
manual. But its use as a plaything has preserved it intact against all odds.
8. The material that follows has been in print and has been circulated
throughout the English-speaking countries since the turn of the century.
Its significance cannot be overstated, particularly in the light of the



518 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Scrolls, and it is thus both remarkable and extraordinary that no major
church or academic body has ever had it drawn to its attention. I presume
this to be the case because the only alternative is to assume that the
Church and academia have been lying through their teeth.
In a foreword to The Shorter Works of Ivan Panin, Samuel F. Hurnard
writes:
A very interesting result may be noted in the Chronology of the Old
Testament:
From Adam to the Exodus was 2,537 years
Add to Solomon's temple laid 480 "
Add to the Captivity 429 "
Add 70 years Captivity and
483 years of Daniel's 69 sevens 553 "
To Incarnation 3,999 "
To death of Christ 33 "
4,032 "
But this number 3999 equals the numeric value of the Greek alphabet.
As much as to indicate that in the year 3999 from Adam, the Son of Man
humbled Himself and became incarnate in order to save the whole world,
pictured by the Greek, or Gentile alphabet. Also the period from the
Exodus-year 2537 deducted from the date of the Crucifixion, year 4032, is
1495 years. But this period of the Law, 1495 years, is the numeric value of
the Hebrew alphabet.
Note that 3999 = 3 x 31 x 43 (their sum 77, or 7 x 11), and that 4032 =
7 x 3 x 3 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 (their sum 5 x 5).
It will be recalled that on pages 51-52 I drew attention to a discrepancy of
239 years. The calculation is as follows:
The present date in the biblical/Jewish calendar is 5757, which is 1997 CE.
5757
Deduct the birth date of Jesus 3999
1758 Thus he is born (mythically
and prophetically speaking) 1758 years ago.
To arrive at the actual corresponding date of our era, we simply deduct
1758 from 1997:
1997 1758 239 CE



APPENDIX I 519
This is more than 200 years after his supposed death.
To find the present year in our calendar corresponding to Bible chron
ology, we simply deduct 239 from 1997:
1997 239 1758 CE
Thus the current year — biblically speaking — is 1758. If nothing else,
this tells us that the biblical millennium is 242 years away. In relation to the
5757 biblical years, one year must be added in the crossover from BCE to CE.
This deficiency of 239 years, to which I have never seen any reference,
explains why the interpretation of biblical prophecy has always been such an
abysmal failure. But surely this was its purpose.
However, all this presupposes that the Christian calendar is advanced.
What if it is the Hebrew calendar that has been retarded?
If we take the present year 5757 and add the 239 missing years we have:
5757
239
5996
The Jewish New Year does not coincide with that of the Christian
calendar. So during our 1997, we have a coincidental 5997. On the biblical
principle that a day is as a thousand years, we are then only four years away
from the end of the sixth day in both reckonings, which are now
synchronized with the millennium.
There was obviously no need for the use of the Bible-based calendar until
after the Scriptures became a public document. This is now, clearly, much
later than has been thought. This 239 years is again evidence of manipu
lation from very powerful quarters in Rome. It also further compounds the
findings of Professor Thomas Thompson.
According to the theories expounded in this book, the entire period
covered by Scripture, the 4032 years from Adam to the crucifixion, can
now be condensed into a relatively short period in the future, it being
entirely prophecy. Our knowledge of the missing 239 years should, then,
aid us considerably in interpreting this prophecy. It may be further noted that
the chronology of the Bible breaks up into eight distinct periods, all of
unequal length.
Panin says:
Writers of the First, Middle & Last Books of the Bible
1. The Bible consisting of 66 books, its first, middle and last are Books
1, 33, 34 and 66. These are in the Hebrew Testament, Genesis,



520 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Song of Songs, Esther and [in the New Testament] Revelation. And their
writers are: Moses, Solomon, Esther and John.
2. Moses is the writer of 5 books: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
Deuteronomy. Solomon is the writer of 3 books: of Proverbs, Song of
Songs, Ecclesiastes. Esther is the writer of one book: Esther. John is the
writer of 5 books: John, 1 John, 2 John, 3 John, Revelation, 14 in all.
3. The Numeric Values of Moses, Solomon, Esther and John are
respectively 345, 375, 661, 1069, with 2450 as their sum.
4. Moses occurs in the Bible 847 times, Solomon 305, Esther 55, John
158, in all 1365.
This then is the only thing in common between the four names: Moses,
Solomon, Esther, John: they are the names of the writers of the first,
middle and last books of the Bible.
5. The sum of their Numeric Values: 345, 375, 661 and 1069 is 2450, or
7 x 7 x 2 x 5 x 5, or 50 sevens (Feature 1) of sevens (Feature 2); divided
thus: the writers of the first and last books of the Bible, Moses and John
have 1414, or 7 x 2 x 101, or 202 sevens; and those of the middle books,
Solomon and Esther, have 1036, or 7 x 2 x 2 x 37, or 148 sevens (Feature
3) with the sum of the figures of these factors 21, or 3 sevens (Feature 4).
The sum of the figures in the 4 numbers 345, 375, 661 and 1069, is 56, or 7
x 2 x 2 x 2 or 8 sevens (Feature 5). The figures used in these four numbers
are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. Their number is — seven (Feature 6); and their sum is
35, or 5 sevens (Feature 7). The number of books written by these four
writers (#2 above) is 14, or 2 sevens (Feature 8). Their names occur in the
Bible (#4 above) 1365 times, o r 7 x l 3 x 3 x 5 , itself 195 sevens (Feature
9); with the sum of its factors 28, or 7 x 2 x 2, or 4 sevens (Feature 10).
And this number 1365 is divided thus: Moses has 847, or 7 x 11 x 11, or
121 sevens; the others have 518, or 74 sevens (Feature 11). *
6. If now these four names be put down in alphabetical order their
numeric values are: 661, 1069, 345, 375. Multiplying each by its order
number, we have
661 x 1 is 661
1069 x 2 is 2138
345 x 3 is 1035
375 x 4 is 1500
5334



APPENDIX I 521
The sum thus obtained, 5334, is 7 x 2 x 3 x 127, or 762 sevens (Feature
12). 5334, itself 762 sevens, is neighbor of 5335, or 485 elevens; compare*
at foot of page. And if the numbers of the occurrences of these four names
be dealt with in the same manner we have
847 x 1 is 847
305 x 2 is 610
55 x 3 is 165
158 x 4 is 632
2254
The sum thus obtained, 2254, is 7 x 7 x 2 x 23, a multiple of not only
seven (Feature 13) but of seven sevens (Feature 14); with the sum of the
figures of these factors 21 or 3 sevens (Feature 15).
THESE 15 FEATURES OF SEVENS THUS PROVE: THAT GENESIS, SONG OF
SONGS, ESTHER AND REVELATION ARE THE FIRST, MIDDLE AND LAST BOOKS
OF THE BIBLE; THAT THEY ARE BOOKS 1, 33, 34 AND 66 THEREFORE; THAT THE
BLBLE THEREFORE CONSISTS OF EXACTLY 66 BOOKS; AND THAT THE WRITERS
OF THESE FOUR BOOKS ARE RESPECTIVELY: MOSES, SOLOMON, ESTHER AND
JOHN.
* Note: The number 1365 is not only 195 sevens; it is also neighbor of 1364, or
124 elevens. Accordingly the division of 1365 into 847 and 518 by sevens, has also
regard to the elevens; thus 847 is 7 x 11 x 11; or 7 elevens of eleven, and 518 is
neighbor of 517, or 47 elevens.
The Books of the Bible
1. In the Hebrew Bible, namely, the Old Testament, the books are
divided into three great divisions: the Law, Prophets, (Holy) Writings.
Genesis-Deuteronomy, the Law; Joshua-Malachi, the Prophets; Psalms
Chronicles, the Writings. 'All things written of me in the Law of Moses,
and the Prophets, and the Psalms,' in Luke 24:44 refers to this division: the
third division being designated by the book at its head. The New Testament
in its turn falls into four great divisions: Gospels, Acts, Epistles, Revelation.
2. Of the 66 books of the Bible 21 are Epistles themselves: the seven so
called Catholic, the fourteen Pauline. But the following twelve books, while
not letters themselves, contain letters: 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, Isaiah,
Jeremiah, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, 2 Chronicles, Acts, Revelation.
For convenience these



522 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
twelve books will hereafter be spoken of as the Epistolary books, as
distinguished from the Epistles themselves.
With these preliminaries thus out of the way we can now proceed to the
numeric phenomena themselves.
3. Now the first fact in Bible numerics to be noticed here is that
the number of books in the Bible is 66, or 6 elevens (Feature 1); of
these the anonymous books are 22 in number, or 2 elevens; and the
non-anonymous books are 44 in number, or 4 elevens (Feature 2).
And of these 44 non-anonymous books 22, or 2 elevens, belong to
writers of more than one book (Feature 3). The books without
Epistles are 33 in number, or 3 elevens; the Epistles and Epistolary
books are also 33 (Feature 4).
That is to say: the whole number of Bible books being a multiple of
eleven, it is divided between books naming their authors and books not
naming them, between books belonging to only one author and books
belonging to more than one, between books with letters and books without,
by — elevens.
4. The sum of the 66 order numbers of the 66 Bible books is 2211,
or 201 elevens, which is divided thus by elevens: the 22 books of
the authors of more than one book have 946, or 86 elevens; the
other 44 books have 1,265, or 115 elevens (Feature 5).
This is to say: Just as the number itself of the books is divided by
elevens between books belonging to writers of only one book and those
belonging to writers of more than one, so their order numbers are also
distributed between the two classes by elevens.
5. Of the books that are wholly Epistles the order numbers are
45-65. Now this sum 2211 for the 66 books is thus divided between
Epistles and non-Epistles: non-Epistles have 1056, or 96 elevens;
Epistles 1155, or 105 elevens (Feature 6). And of the Epistles the
first, middle and last books have 165, or 15 elevens (Feature 7), of
which in turn the first and last have 110, or 10 elevens; and the
middle has 55, or 5 elevens (Feature 8).
That is to say: Just as the number itself of the Bible books is divided
between books consisting of or containing letters and the other books by
elevens, so their order numbers also are divided by elevens between
Epistles and non-Epistles.
6. Of the sum of the order numbers of the Epistles just seen to be
1155, or 105 elevens, numbers 53, 54, 55, 59, 60, are addressed to
churches directly, namely: 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, 1 and 2
Thessalonians; 65 is addressed to Philemon and also to the church



APPENDIX I 523
in thy house. In 50, namely 3 John, the writer states that he had written
somewhat to the church, but 'Diotrephes who loveth to have the pre
eminence among them receiveth us not'. The sum of the order numbers of
these seven church or semi-church Epistles is 396, or 36 elevens (Feature
9). And if we arrange these numbers in their proper order, 50, 53, 54, 55,
59, 60, 65, the middle one is found to be 55 or 5 elevens (Feature 10).
7. It was shown above in Sec. 1 that the Bible consists of seven
great divisions. These seven divisions begin with these books:
Genesis, Joshua, Psalms, Matthew, Acts, James and Revelation.
They end with Deuteronomy, Malachi, 2 Chronicles, John, Acts,
Philemon and Revelation.
The order numbers of these books, 1, 5, 6, 26, 27, 39, 40, 43, 44, 45, 65,
66, have for their sum 407, or 37 elevens (Feature 11). These seven
divisions of the Bible consist, moreover, of two classes: those consisting of
more than one book, and those consisting of only one book each, namely
Acts and Revelation. Now this sum 407, or 37 elevens, is thus divided: the
divisions consisting of more than one book have 297, or 27 elevens; the
divisions which consist of only one book each, Acts and Revelation, have
110, or 10 elevens (Feature 12). And of this number again Acts has 44 or 4
elevens; and Revelation has 66, or 6 elevens (Feature 13).
Hitherto only the books themselves and their order numbers have been
considered. Let us now look at the names of the Bible writers.
8. The persons named in the New Testament as writers of the Old are the
authors of books with the following order numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5,12,13,15,16,
27, 35. Their sum is 132 or 12 elevens (Feature 14). While the two writers
whose names occur in the New Testament, but not as of Old Testament
writers, Jonah and Solomon, have for the sum of the order numbers of their
books 110, or 10 elevens (Feature 15).
9. In addition to the seven Old Testament writers spoken of in the New,
the following persons are named therein as New Testament writers: James,
Paul, Peter, Jude, and John. Now the names of these twelve Bible writers
named in the New Testament are found in the whole Bible 2871 times, or
261 elevens (Feature 16), of which the Old Testament writers have 2310, or
210 elevens; and those of the New have 561, or 51 elevens (Feature 17).
And Moses, who is the first Bible writer, has 847, or 1 1 x 1 1 x 7 , a
multiple of eleven (Feature 18) elevens (Feature 19).



524 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
10. The seven names of these Old Testament writers occur thus:
Moses is found in 31 books; Isaiah in 12, Jeremiah in 8; Hosea in 7;
Joel in 7; Daniel in 6; David in 28. The sum of these numbers is 99
or 9 elevens (Feature 20), of which the first, middle and last (com
pare Feature 7 above) have 66 or 6 elevens (Feature 21).
The name of the first of these seven writers, Moses, occurs in the Bible,
as has been stated 847 times. In some books it occurs more than a hundred
times, thus requiring a number of three figures to express it. In Exodus, for
example, it occurs 290 times. In others, however, it occurs less than a
hundred times, but a number requiring two figures to express it: as in
Joshua, where it occurs 58 times. In others again it occurs less than 10
times, thus requiring only one figure to express it. Now the 21 books where
Moses is found a number of times small enough to be expressed by one
figure have this name 77 times, or 7 x 11; and the books with the numbers
of more than one figure have 770, or 11 x 7 x 10. The division here is not
only by elevens, but by seven elevens (Feature 22).
Again: the Epistles form a marked division of the Bible. Now the 847
occurrences of Moses in the Bible are thus divided by elevens: the non
Epistles have 825, or 75 elevens; the Epistles have 22, or 2 elevens
(Feature 23). And of this number Hebrews, where it occurs most, has
eleven (Feature 24).
In connection then with the mere number of Bible books, their order
numbers, and the occurrences in the Bible of the names of some of its
writers, no less than 24 distinct features of elevens are to be observed.
11. These 24 features of elevens are here: they are a fact. They
may prove interesting or uninteresting, desirable or undesirable;
but our first business with them is to accept them as a — fact.
Now this fact, the presence here of these 24 features of elevens, is either
accident or design. As only every eleventh number is a multiple of eleven,
the chance for any particular number being a multiple of eleven is only one
in eleven, since the matter being left to chance, the other ten numbers have
as good a chance to merely happen as this particular multiple of eleven. So
that the chance for any one of the 24 features of elevens to merely happen
here is only one in eleven; the chance for any two features of elevens to just
happen here is only one in 11 x 21, or one in 231; the chance for any three
features of elevens to just happen here is only one in 11 x 16 x 31, or one in
5456. The chance for every additional feature of



APPENDIX I 525
eleven thus diminishes some twenty-five fold. Going thus through all the
24 features of elevens enumerated thus far, their occurrence here
accidentally rather than by design is just one in 263 x 257 x 251 x 248 x
244 x 241 x 131 x 127 x 123 x 83 x 65 x 43 x 37 x 35 x 29 x 27, a number
requiring some thirty figures to express.
When the odds against anything merely happening run into even only a
million, it is already deemed highly improbable that it just happened; when
they run into a hundred millions, it is held as practically certain, that no
mere chance was here at work; when the chances against a thing being
accidental rather than designed are some billion millions taken a million
times, rational men do not even think of ascribing it to chance.
He goes on to say:
THE PRESENCE HERE OF THESE 24 FEATURES OF ELEVENS, THEREFORE, IS NOT
ACCIDENT BUT DESIGN.
An elaborate scheme of elevens is thus seen to run through the mere
number of the Bible books, their order numbers, and the names of some of
its writers.
12. But side by side with this elaborate scheme of elevens an
equally elaborate scheme of sevens is displayed here:
The Bible falls into seven great divisions (Feature 1): Law, Prophets,
Hagiographa, Gospels, Acts, Epistles, Revelation. The Law having 5 books,
Prophets 21, Hagiographa 13, Gospels 4, Acts 1, Epistles 21, Revelation 1.
The largest divisions contain each 21 books, or 3 sevens (Feature 2). The
Epistles, one of these two largest divisions, are divided thus: seven are
addressed to, or connected with, churches as such (Feature 3). The so-called
Catholic are seven in number, the Pauline Epistles are 14, or 2 sevens
(Feature 4). These Pauline Epistles are addressed to bodies, or individuals.
Now they are addressed to just seven specified bodies: to Romans,
Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colos-sians, Thessalonians
(Feature 5). Their order numbers are 52-60, their sum 504, or 72 sevens
(Feature 6).
13. In 1 and 2 Corinthians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2
Thessalonians, Philemon, the apostle associates others with himself
in the address. These Epistles are seven in number (Feature 7), and
their order numbers, 53, 54, 57, 58, 59, 60, 65, have for their sum
406, or 58 sevens (Feature 8).
In 1 and 2 Thessalonians, with order numbers 59 and 60, Paul



526 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
associates with himself two persons, whereas in the others he has only one.
Accordingly, the number 406, or 58 sevens, is thus divided: 1 and 2
Thessalonians have 119, or 17 sevens; the other Epistles have 287, or 41
sevens (Feature 9).
The three associates of Paul are Silvanus, Sosthenes and Timothy. These
names occur respectively in the New Testament 2, 16, 24, times: 42 in all,
or 6 sevens (Feature 10).
Of the 66 order numbers of the books of the Bible, or 6 elevens, every
eleventh number is: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66; their sum is 231, or 7 x 11 x 3.
This number is not only itself a multiple of seven as well as of eleven
(Feature 11), but the sum of its factors, 21, is also a multiple of seven, it
being 3 sevens (Feature 12).
14. The number of Old Testament writers named as such is 21, or
3 sevens (Feature 13), of which 14, or 2 sevens, are not named in the
New Testament as Bible writers, and seven are so named (Feature
14). These seven writers occur in the Old Testament 2310 times, a
multiple of both seven and eleven, it being 7 x 1 1 x 2 x 3 x 5 (Feature
15); while the sum of its factors, 28, is 4 sevens (Feature 16).
Of these 2310 occurrences the writer whose name occurs most, David,
has 1134 or 7 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 2 , not only itself a multiple of seven
(Feature 17), but the sum of its factors, 21, is 3 sevens (Feature 18). Again;
Moses, the first Bible writer, has 847, or 7 x 11 x 11, a multiple of both
seven and eleven (Feature 19). And this number is thus divided: the books
which have this name less than ten times have 77, or 7 x 11; the others have
it 770 times, or 7 x 11 x 10, also a multiple of both seven and eleven
(Feature 20).
The Old Testament books which belong to authors of more than one
book are: Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Proverbs, Song of
Solomon, Ecclesiastes — seven in number (Feature 21). The sum of their
order numbers, 105, is 15 sevens (Feature 22). And of this number Moses
has 14, or 2 sevens; and Solomon has 91, or 13 sevens (Feature 23). And of
Solomon's three books again Proverbs has 28, and the Song of Solomon
and Ecclesiastes have 63, or 9 sevens (Feature 24).
15. These seven Old Testament writers have for the sum of the
books in which their names occur 99, or 9 elevens. That is to say: the
number for the books of the seven Old Testament writers named in
the New are specially marked off, so that their sum should be so
many elevens. A similar design is marked off for the New Testa
ment writers themselves, only the number here is seven instead of



APPENDIX I 527
eleven. For the names of the New Testament writers occur thus: James is
found in 11 books, Peter in 8, Jude in 8, Paul in 15, John in 7; in all 49, or 7
sevens (Feature 25). Their order numbers are 45,46, 47, 51-65, their sum
1008, or 144 sevens (Feature 26).
16. The chance for these 26 features of sevens being here undesigned,
merely accidental, is about one in 81,472,966,297,612,001 x 16,807; the
chance for these sevens to merely happen at the same time with those 24
features of elevens enumerated above is only one in a number of some
forty-five figures. And the above enumeration of the features of sevens and
elevens is in nowise exhaustive.
17. Coming now to the question, Who is it that put this design thus into
the Bible, let just the single case of the name of Moses be considered.
The Old Testament was written by at least 21 different writers; the New,
by at least five. So that the Bible, according to its own testimony, was
written by at least 26 different writers. The whole of the Old Testament was
translated from the Hebrew into Greek as early as some 280 years before
Christ. As the New Testament could not have been written before the
crucifixion in A.D. 30, some 300 years thus lie between the writing of the
two Testaments.
It could indeed be shewn that between the writing of his books by Moses
and the writing of the Revelation by John not indeed three but some sixteen
centuries must have passed; but for the present purpose the particular
number of centuries does not matter. Enough if it be established that
between the writing of the two Testaments there lie — centuries.
Let the reader now turn to Sec. 10 and look once more at the phenomena
there presented by the name of Moses alone, to say nothing at present of the
other names.
18. If the Bible writers themselves are the ones who planned this
distribution of the name Moses with its double scheme of sevens
and elevens, how did they contrive to accomplish it? Only by an
understanding among the 26 different writers of the 66 different
books so to insert this name in their writings that it shall be found
in all of them just 7 x 11 x 11 times with several other features of
sevens and elevens. This implies that Moses began this scheme
deliberately, expecting that subsequent writers after him, some of
them following him only after centuries, would insert his name just
enough times to keep the design in suspense, — yet always in full
view by each writer — until it gets to John, who by using it in his



528 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Revelation just once at last completes the centuries-ago planned and
waited-for design.
Merely to state it thus is to say at once that 26 men writing centuries
apart, and living in different lands, could have had no such understanding
among themselves. Such an understanding, if had, could originate, be kept
up for centuries, and finally carried out only by a miracle, and moreover by
a continuous miracle.
19. One other possibility remains: Some one may have revised the whole
Bible in such a manner as to distribute deliberately the name Moses among
its different books so as to produce these numeric schemes. It must clearly
be either someone who lived after Revelation, in which book Moses is
found; or its writer, John himself: since without this one occurrence of
Moses in Revelation this elaborate numeric design is — destroyed. But the
Hebrew text of the Old Testament was already settled centuries before
John; the text was most zealously guarded by the Jews even to its jots and
tittles; and since the numeric scheme runs through both Testaments as a
unit, the alterations in the text must have been made by a hated Christian.
So far as to the impossibility of deliberately altering the Old Testament; yet
the numeric scheme, if deliberately put into the Bible thus positively
demands such alteration. Any tampering, however, with the text of the Old
Testament, even by the apostle John himself, would be rebuked at least by
the Diotrepheses of his day who did not shrink even from refusing to
receive him. Moreover, for the purpose of carrying out the numeric design
alteration in the New Testament without any in the Old would be of no
avail. And even apart from these considerations, nothing short of
miraculous skill would be required for carrying out this design even in the
case of the name of Moses alone. David's case with his 1134 occurrences
presents, however, the same need of miraculous skill; the same is true of
the rest of the seven names which form that special group with Moses and
David (named elsewhere). And again, several of the numeric features run
already through the Old Testament alone independent of the new.
20. On mere human grounds, therefore, these numeric phenomena, even
those in the name of Moses alone, are simply inexplicable. And this is the
case of only one in thousands. The hypothesis that these numeric
phenomena got into the Bible by the design of man thus proves equally
impossible with the hypothesis that they are due to mere chance.



APPENDIX I 529
There thus remains the only explanation that to rational minds presents
no difficulty whatever: that a mathematical mind superior to man, the great
mathematical builder of nature, has planned and executed the same design
in His Volume of Creation as Revelation. Only those who deny that there is
at all an Intelligent Creator of the world, and those who deny that such a
Creator would write a book thus, can turn away from this the only
explanation of these otherwise wholly inexplicable facts. But to thus turn
away from facts, and from the most elementary laws of Logic, is to stamp
oneself not as a rational but as an irrational mind.
Genesis 1:1. "In (the) beginning God created the heavens and the earth"
I.
This verse has seven words (Feature 1), with 28 letters, or 4 sevens
(Feature 2): of which the first three words, the subject and the predicate of
the sentence, have 14, with a Place Value of 140, or 20 sevens (Feature 3);
the last four, the two objects of the sentence, have also 14, or 2 sevens
(Feature 4). Of the two objects each has seven letters (Feature 5). Another
division of seven into three and four produces the following: The three
leading words: God, the heavens, the earth, have 14; the remaining four
have also 14 or 2 sevens (Feature 6): with 924 for the value, or 132 sevens
(Feature 7) divided thus: The Place Value has 147, or 3 sevens of sevens
(Feature 8); and the Numeric Value has 777, itself 111 sevens (Feature 9);
of which the units have seven (Feature 10); the tens, seven (Feature 11),
and the hundreds have seven (Feature 12). The middle word, the shortest,
has seven letters with its right hand neighbour (Feature 13); and seven with
its left hand neighbour (Feature 14).
This numeration is in no wise exhaustive; but the chance for these 2
sevens of features of seven being accidental, undesigned is already only one
in seven multiplied by itself 14 times, or, 678,623,072,849 one in nearly
seven hundred thousand millions. An elaborate design of sevens thus runs
through the seven words of the first verse of the Bible.
II.
The number of letters 28, is 4 x 7, a multiple of four as well as of seven
(Feature 1); divided thus: the first four (Feature 2) words have 16 or 4 fours
(Feature 3); the last three have 12 or 3 fours



530 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
(Feature 4); the same division into 16 and 12 is formed thus: the first two
and last two words, the outer four (Feature 5) have 16 or 4 fours (Feature
6). The three between have 12, or 3 fours (Feature 7). The three between
have 12, or 3 fours, (Feature 7). The same division is for the third time
formed thus: The first, last and middle words have 12, or 3 fours; the
remaining four (Feature 8) have 16 or four (Feature 9) fours (Feature 10).
The numbers for the letters in the seven words are 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6. Four
are duplicates: 3, 3, 5, 5, (Feature 11); their sum is 16 or four fours (Feature
12); leaving 12 for the others, or 3 fours (Feature 13). The duplicates are
the odd numbers. Those in the odd places 2, 3, 5, 6, have also 16 or 4 fours
(Feature 14); the even places have 12, or 3 fours (Feature 15). The largest
and smallest numbers have 8, or 2 fours; the others have 20 or 5 fours
(Feature 16).
The chance for these 16 features of 4 to be here undesigned is less than
one in 3,600,000,000 or three thousand, six hundred millions. An elaborate
design of fours as well as of sevens runs through the seven words of
Genesis 1:1.
III. The numeric value of Genesis 1:1 is 2701, or 37 x 73, the combination
of thirty-seven (Feature 1) with its reverse 73; divided thus:
Words 1-5 have 1998 or 37 x 18 x 3
Words 6-7 have 703 or 37 x 19 This division is by 37 (Feature 2); and
the sum of the figures of 1998 x 703 is 37 (Feature 3). The number 703 is in
its turn divided thus:
Word 6 has 407 or 37 x 11
Word 7 has 296 or 37 x 2 x 2 x 2 (Feature 4). Of the last division it is
to be noted that the sum of the figures of the factors is 28 or 4 sevens; and
that of the figures of 407 x 296 is also 28 or 4 sevens.
The leading nouns, God, the heavens, and the earth have 777 or 21 thirty
sevens, the other words have 1924, or 52 thirty-sevens (Feature 5); and the
sum of the figures of 777 and 1924 is 37 (Feature 6). Of the 777 God, the
heavens have 481 or 37 x 13; and the earth has 296 or 37 x 8 (Feature 7).
The words with the largest and smallest Numeric Values 913 and 86 have
999, or 37 x 3 x 3 x 3; the others have 1702, or 37 x 2 x 23 (Feature 8), with
the sum of the figures of 999 and 1702 also 37 (Feature 9). The sum of the
figures of their factors is 36, itself 6 x 6, but neighbour of both 37 and 35 or
5 sevens (Feature 10).



APPENDIX I 531
Again: Words 5-6 have for their Numeric Value 802, neighbour of 803,
or 11 seventy-threes the reverse of 37; leaving for the other 1899,
neighbour of 1898 or 73 x 2 x 13. This division is by 73. But the sum of the
figures of 802 and 1899 is 37 (Feature 11). Again: the seven Numeric
Values of the words of Genesis 1:1 arranged in their actual order 86, 203,
296,395,401,407, 913, their Nos. 1-3 have 585, or (73 x 2 x 2 x 2)+l; and 4
7 have 2116, or (73 x 29)-l. This division is also by 73, but the sum of the
figures of the factors of 585 and 2116 is 37 (Feature 12).
If now the four figures of 2701 be multiplied by their order numbers, 1,
2, 3, 4, we have:
2000 x 1 is 2000 700 x 2 is 1400
0 x 3 is 0
1 x 4 is __ 4
3404; or 37 x 4 x 23 (Feature 13)
The same multiplication inverted gives:
2000 x 4 is 8000
700 x 3 is 2100
0 x 2 is 0
1 x 1 is ___ 1
10101; or 37 x 3 x 7 x 13 (Feature 14).
The chance for these 14 features of 37 being undesigned is one in 37
multiplied by itself 14 times: 352,275,361 multiplied by itself thrice taken
1369 times, a number of some twenty-eight figures.
An elaborate design of 37 as well as of 4 and 7 thus runs through the 7
words of Genesis 1:1.
IV.
The Numeric Value 2701 is the combination of 37 with seventy-three
(Feature 1), its reverse. At Feature 11 of the 37 it was already seen that the
division is by 73 (Feature 2). The Numeric Values of the 7 words of
Genesis 1:1 are 913, 203, 86, 401, 395, 407, 296, which in their natural
order are 86, 203, 296, 395, 401, 407, 913, as seen above at Feature 12 of
the thirty-seven. It has already been seen that the division at Feature 11
above is by 73 (Feature 3); likewise the one at Feature 12 above (Feature
4). Now the first and middle words in the text have for their Numeric
Values 913, and 401 or 1314 which is 73 x 18; the others have 1387, or
73x19 (Feature 5). This division is moreover by the nearest two halves 18 x
19 into which the uneven 37 can at all be divided.



532 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
If now the seven Numeric Values be multiplied by their order numbers 1,
2, 3,... 7 we have: 86 x 1 is 86 203 x 2 is 406 296 x 3 is 888 395 x 4 is 1580
401 x 5 is 2005 407 x 6 is 2442 913 x 7 is 6391
13798; or (73 x 7 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3)-l the
combination of seventy-three (Feature 6) with seven; divided thus:
Words 5, 7, have 8396 or (73 x 5 x 23)+l The others have 5402 or 73 x 37
x 2 (Feature 7). The chance for these seven seventy-threes to occur here un
designed is one in 73.7, or 10,640,000,000,000.
A most elaborate design of sevens, fours, 38 and 73 runs through the
seven words of the first verse of the Bible in Hebrew. As no mere man
could by his own attainments perform the feat of such four different
schemes here, this verse alone thus demonstrates its Inspiration by the
Master Mathematician of Creation, who duly weigheth and counteth all that
comes from His hand.
Genesis 1:3 "And God said, let there be light"
1. — 50 — VAYOMER — And-Said
2. — 41 — ELOHIM — God
3. — 25 — Y'hee — Be (there)
4. — _27 — Ohr — Light
143
The Place Value in the Hebrew of these four words is 143 or 11 thirteens
(Feature 1); the sum of the figures of the four numbers is 26, or 2 thirteens
(Feature 2); of these the units have 13, and the tens 13 (Feature 3). The first
two words have 91, or 7 x 13; the last two 52 or 4 thirteens (Feature 4).
To these four direct features of 13, the following are produced indirectly
by neighbourhood: 143 being a multiple of eleven as well as thirteen, is
divided thus:
First and last words 77 or 11 x 7, or (13 x 6)-l



APPENDIX I 533
The middle have 66 or 11 x 6, or (13 x5)+l
This division is by eleven, but producing the 13 also (Feature 5).
The last two words, with their sum 52, or 13 x 4, are divided thus:
The third word has 25 or (13 x 2)-l
The last has 27 or (13 x 2)+l (Feature 6).
The same division producing the elevens and thirteens is formed thus : The
four words have 16 letters, with the following Place Values: 6,10,1,13,
20,1,12, 5,10,13,10, 5,10,1, 6, 20. Letters 1-9 have 78 or 13 x 6 or (11
x 7)+l Letters 10-16 have 65 or 13 x 5 or (11 x 6)-l (Feature 7)
If now the four Place Values, 25, 27, 41, 50, be each multiplied by its
order number, 1, 2, 3, 4, we have 25, 54,123, 200; the sum 402 is (13 x
31)—1 the combination of 13 (Feature 8) with its reverse 31 (Feature 9) by
neighborhood.
An elaborate design of thirteen and eleven thus runs through these four
words of Genesis 1:3. Not a verse or even a sentence of the whole Bible,
Hebrew or Greek, but shows the same Numeric designs impossible for
man: proving the handiwork of the Great Numberer in Nature, the God and
Creator of the Universe.
I have made it clear in the text that my understanding of how these
numerical patterns came about differs from Panin's, though I cannot
emphasize too strongly the fundamental importance of his discoveries.
As I have indicated, my own account of the 'elaborate design' of the Bible is
that it was written, as a whole, by the Essenes. Let me, as this book draws to a
close, point again to some concrete evidence that supports my case.
As far back as 1972 Jose O'Callaghan identified a fragment from Qum-ran
cave 7 (7Q5) as being from the Gospel of Mark (6:52-3). How could it have
got there? Catholic academia has come up with the amazing notion that
Christians must have occupied the cave during the revolt led by Bar
Cocheba in 132-135 CE. Not only is the cave virtually inaccessible, the
fragment clearly comes from a scroll, whereas the more convenient booklike
codices had taken over from scrolls before the turn of the first century.
Alternatively, we could entertain the notion that a Christian Roman
soldier, a member of the 'Fretensis' legion, which overran Qumran in 68
CE, was lowered by a rope into the cave, where he accidentally left his hot
off-the-press copy of the gospel. The plausibility of this scenario is not
enhanced by the fact that the legion came from Syria, not Palestine.
The only thing that now prevents the BCE dating of the New Testament is
insistence upon the historicity of Jesus. In other words, blind faith.



Appendix II
Examples of numerology in Scripture from the Numeric New Testament
edited by Ivan Panin. These do not have the obvious significance of the
material in Appendix I, but they add substance and demonstrate its
importance to academic scholarship.
Panin refers to the divisions of text made by Wescott and Hort; I take it to
be implied that they have intelligently made these divisions as they were
originally intended.
PAPER I
Design in Paragraphing. (Matt, i-ii)
1 The first two chapters of Matthew are separated by an interval of some
twenty-eight years. They are accordingly spaced off heavily by Westcott
and Hort from Chapter III in their Greek Text. Though these chapters have
897 words Westcott and Hort make seven (larger) divisions of them of
various sizes from eight words (1:1) to 458 (2:1-23). The second chapter is
subdivided by them at verses 13 and 16, without, however, beginning them
with a line. So that with these subdivisions these chapters present nine
divisions, with the following number of words in each.
1 Matt. i. 1 has 8 words
2 2-6 a has 82 words
3 6b-11 has 82 words
4 12-16 has 74 words
5 17 has 32 words
6 18-25 has 161 words (7—ii. 7-12 221
8 13-15 78

897 897 is 23 x3 xl3 or 13 x 69 or (7x8x8 x2)+1 or (8 x8 x2 x7)+1
As 897 is itself a multiple of 23 and 13, and by neighborhood of seven
and eight, four distinct schemes of twenty-threes, thirteens, eights, and
sevens run through these 897 words.



APPENDIX II 535
2 The sum of the figures of the seven numbers is 69 or 3 twenty-threes
(Feature 1); of which those occupying places 1,3,5, have 23, and the even
have 46 or 2 twenty-threes (Feature 2). The sum of the seven numbers, 897,
is 39 twenty-threes (Feature 3), divided thus:
897 or 23 x 39 or (32 x 4 x 7)+1 or (7 x 4 x 32)+1 The odd numbers
have
161 or 23 x 7 or (32 x 5)+1 or 7 x 23 The even numbers have
736 or 23 x 32 or 32 x 23 or (7 x 7 x 3 x 5)+1
This division is by twenty-three (Feature 4) and produces also 32, the
reverse of 23 (Feature 5).
This is only a scratch on the surface of the numerics of these 897 words,
but the chance for what is already given being undesigned here is only one
in 23 x 23 x 23 x 23 x 23 x 32 x 32 x 7 x 7 x 7 or 4,436,343 x 1,024 x 343 x
2 or one in 3,000,000,000,000, three million millions, far beyond what is
required for demonstrating design here.
The sevens and the thirteens appear thus: First and middle have 532 or 7
x 76 or (13 x 41 )-1 The others have 365 or (7 x 4 x 13)+1 or 13 x 28+1. The
factors of 897 are 13 x 3 x 23, their sum is 39, or 3 thirteens.
If now the smaller divisions also are considered, we have (see below as
to the multiplication)
1 has words 8 x 9 or 72
2 haswords82x8or656
3 has words 82 x 7 or 574
4 haswords74x6or444
5 haswords32x5or160
6 haswords161x4or644
7 haswords221x3or663
8 haswords78x2or156
9 haswords159x1or159
897 3,528 or 7 x 7 x 8 x 9
As 7 and 8 have 299 or 13 x 23, leaving for the others 598, we have
299 or 13 x 23 x 1 598 or 13 x 23 x 2 897 or 13 x 23 x 3
combining the factors 13 and 23 into a division by 299.



536 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
If the nine numbers be multiplied by their order numbers reversed, the
result (last column in Table above) is 3,528, or 7 x 7 x 8 x 9, not only
seven sevens, but the sequence of the factors 7,8,9. Of this number the first
two have 728, leaving for the others 2,800. 728 is 7 x 8 x 13 or (9 x 9 x 9)-1
2,800 is 7 x 8 x 50 or (9 x 311)+1 3,528 is 7 x 7 x 8 x 9 or 9 x 8 x 7 x 7
reproducing the 7 and 8 of 897, while 9 is only 3 x 3 (897 is 3 x 299). This
multiplication alone demonstrates the exact number of words in each of the
nine divisions, since a single change in any one of the numbers vitiates this
result.
A sidelight on the extent of Numerics here is this: The above collocation
fully factored is
728 is 7 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 13 2,800 is 7 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 5 x 5
3,528 is 7 x 7 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3
The sums of the three sets of factors are 26 or 13 x 2 or (25)"
25 or (13 x 2)-1 or 25
26 or 13 x 2 or (25)+1
the 13 and 25 appearing in each case,
728 being a multiple of 13 2,800 being a multiple of 25.
PAPER II
Christ a Common Noun in the New Testament.
(Matt. i. 1)
1 Of the two great divisions of the Genealogy in Matthew i. 1-17, verses 1
11 form the first. They have in the Greek a VOCABULARY oi 49 words or 7 x
7, seven (Feature 1) sevens (Feature 2); with the sum of its factors 14, or 2
sevens (Feature 3). They have 266 letters, or 7 x 2 x 19, itself 38 sevens
(Feature 4) with the sum of its figures 14, or 2 sevens (Feature 5), and the
sum of its factors 28, or 4 sevens (Feature 6). The letters are divided thus:
140 are vowels, and 126 are consonants. This division is not only by sevens
(Feature 7) but by 2 sevens; thus:
140 is 7 x 2 x 2 x 5
126 is 7 x 2 x 3 x 3



APPENDIX II 537
The 49 words themselves are similarly divided: Begin with a vowel,
28 or 7 x 4 Begin with a consonant, 21 or 7 x 3 (Feature 8).
Again: 35, or 5 sevens occur more than once; 14, or 2 sevens occur only
once (Feature 9). Seven occur in more than one form; and 42, or 6 sevens,
in only one form (Feature 10). The same division is produced thus: 42 are
nouns, and seven are not nouns (Feature 11); of the nouns 35, or 5 sevens,
are Proper Names, and 14, or 2 sevens are common nouns (Feature 12). Of
the proper names 28 are male ancestors of the Lord Jesus; and seven are
not (Feature 13).
As the chance for these 13 features of sevens alone is already only one in
13,841,287,201, or nearly fourteen billions, an elaborate design of sevens
thus pervades the mere Vocabulary of Matthew i. 1-11. Now features 12
and 13 involve the status of Christ as a common noun. These alone,
however, do not yet suffice to establish it.
2 Here are the seven common nouns (including Christ), with their place,
numeric, and values preceding them; and their occurrences in the passage
and number of letters following:
These words are seven (Feature 1), having 49 letters, or seven (Feature 2)
sevens (Feature 3); divided thus: the first three words have 21, or 3 sevens,
and the last four have 28 (Feature 4). The middle word has seven (Feature
5). Of the first three words, the first has seven (Feature 6). Of the last four
words the last has seven (Feature 7); the longest and the shortest words
have respectively 10 and 4 letters, with 14 for their sum, or 2 sevens
(Feature 8). The three longest syllables, have 12 letters,
the two shortest, a, a have 2 letters; the shortest and the longest syllables
have thus 14 letters, or 2 sevens, and the others have 35, or 5 sevens
(Feature



538 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
9). Lastly, if the seven occurrences are multiplied by their order numbers
we have:
2 x 1 or 2
1 x 2 or 2
l x 3or 3
1 x 4 or 4
1 x 5 or 5
2 x 6 or 12 1 x 7 or 7
35
The result is 35, or again 5 sevens (Feature 10). As the chance for ten
features of sevens here is only one in seven multiplied by itself ten times,
or 282,475,249, the mere letters present alone an elaborate design of
sevens, with Christ as one of the seven common nouns.
As, however, Christ itself has seven letters, even this elaborate design
does not yet demonstrate its being a common noun.
3
The following numerics, however, do supply the final proof required
here that Christ must be taken as a common noun:
The sum of the figures of the seven numeric values is 91, or 13 sevens
(Feature 1), of which the middle has 14, or 2 sevens, and the others have
77, itself 11 sevens (Feature 2), with the sum of its figure 14, or 2 sevens
(Feature 3); of which the units have seven and the tens seven (Feature 4);
the largest and smallest have seven figures (Feature 5), with their sum 21,
or 3 sevens; leaving for the others 70, or 7 x 2 x 5, itself 10 sevens (Feature
6), with seven for its own figures, (Feature 7) and 14 for the sum of its
factors, or 2 sevens (Feature 8). The four words for persons: brother, king,
son, Christ, have 56, or 8 sevens; the three for things: book, birth, removal,
have 35 or 5 sevens (Feature 9). The same division is produced thus: tens
have 35, the units, hundreds, and thousand have 56 (Feature 10).
This elaborate design of sevens in the mere matter of the sum of the
figures of the numeric values is possible only with Christ as one of the
seven common nouns.
4
The value of these seven nouns presents an even more elaborate scheme,
in fact a double scheme. Because the value of the figures of these seven
numbers 112, being not only 16 sevens but also 7 sixteens, or 2 eights,



APPENDIX II 539
the persons have 48 or 8 x 2 x 3 or (7 x 7)-1 the things have 64 or 8 x 8
or (7 x 9)+1 112 or 8 x 2 x 7 or 7x16. This division presents directly three
features of eights; but by neighborhood, indirectly, also three features of
sevens.
The first, last, and middle values have for the sum of their figures 57,
leaving 55 for the others. This divides 112 into its nearest unequal halves;
but
57 is (7 x 8)+1 55 is (7x8)-1 112 is 7 x 8 x 2 The same combination 7 x 8
is repeated twice; thus:
Nos. in odd places (1,3,5,7) have 57 or (7 x 8)+1 Nos. in even places (2,4,6)
have 55 or (7 x 8)-1 The nos. 885, 371,1,598 have 55 or (7 x 8)-1 The
nos. 932, 742, 544, 764 have 57 or (7 x 8)+1 The first set ends without
duplicate figures; the second ends thus: two with 2, two with 4. And this
distinction is marked by numerics. As the chance for these collocations
alone is only one in 160 billions, they amply establish elaborate design
here. But this is in nowise exhaustive. Thus of the figures 885, 932, 371,
544, 764, 742, 1,598 the odd places have 49, and the even have 63, the
same division seen above in 48 and 64, only the sevens and sixteens chang
ing places; thus:
49 is 7 x 7 or (16 x 3)+1 63 is 7 x 9 or (16 x 4)-1 The sum 112 is, moreover,
divided thus: the units and hundreds have for the sum of their figures 70,
the tens and the thousands have 42. This division is by 2 sevens; thus: 70 is
7 x 2 x 5 42 is 7 x 2 x 3 112 is 7 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2
with 70 having for the sum of its figures seven, and the sum of its factors
14, or 2 sevens.
There remains only to be added that the place values have for the sum of
their figures 66, or 6 x 11. Accordingly, they present an elaborate scheme
of sixes; the odd numbers have 36, or 6 sixes, the even 30, or 5 sixes; first,
last, and middle again 36, or 6 x 6, and the others 30; 1-3 have again 6 x 6 ,
4-6 have 30, and so on with other features.



540 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Every passage of the New Testament where Christ occurs will be found
witnessing to the same fact: that the word is in the New Testament not a
proper name, but a common noun.
PAPER IV
Jehoiachim. (Matt. i. 11-12)
The question whether Jeconiah of these two verses is the son of Josiah, the
Jehoiakim of the Old Testament, or his grandson, Jehoiakin, is settled by
numerics as Jehoiakim, grandfather of Salathiel by his son Jehoiachin. The
proof is as follows: Of the persons 'begotten' in this genealogy Isaac is the
first, and the Lord Jesus the last. Of the birth years of the links from the
first to the last only the following can be obtained from the Bible
chronology as established by numerics, the data for the birth of the other
links not being given in the Bible.
1 Isaac is born in Year 2108 of Adam
2 Jacob 2168
3 David 2944
4 Rehoboam 3013
5 Jehoshaphat 3080
6 Jehoram 3108
7 Uzziah 3208
8 Jotham 3251
9 Ahaz 3272
10 Hezekiah 3283
11 Manasseh 3325
12 Amon 3370
13 Josiah 3386
14 Jehoiakim 3400
15 Lord Jesus 3999
46,915
The sum of these dates, 46,915, is itself 4,265 elevens; by its neighbor
46,914, or 7 x 2 x 3 x 1,117, it produced a seven; by its other neighbor
46,916, or 37 x 2 x 2 x 317, it produced a thirty-seven. Accordingly three
distinct schemes of seven, eleven, and thirty-seven, run through these 15
dates; which would require dozens of pages to expound here. For the
immediate purpose of this paper the very first number alone suffices to
establish design; thus:
46,915 is (7 x 6 x 1,117)+1 or (37 x 2 x 2 x 317)-1 or 11 x 5 x 853



APPENDIX II 541
2,108 is (7 x 7 x 43)+1 or (37 x 3 x 19)-1 or (43 x 7 x 7)+1Others
44,807 is 7 x 37 x 1,073 or 37 x 7 x 1,073 or 43 x 2 x 521.
Here the sevens (with 7 x7) appear, and the 37, but in addition a forty
three appears (with the sum of the figures of the factors, 43, 7, 7, being 21,
or 3 sevens, and the same for 37, 7, 1,073 being 28, or 4 sevens). But in
addition to the sevens and thirty-sevens; (1) the eleven reappears in the sum
of the figures 2,108: (2) a 43 appears in both 2,108 and 44,807; and (3) the
factor of 1,117 x 7 x 6 reappears in the sum of 7, 37,1,073, which is also
1,117.
The chance for this collocation produced by one item alone out of the
fifteen is one in 7 x 7 x 7 x 7 x 7 x 11 x 11 x 11 x 37 x 37 x 43 x 43 x 1,117
x 1,117, or 16,807 x 1,331 x 1,369 x 1,849 x 130,689, a number of 19
figures.
The year 3,108 produces a similar division; thus: 46,915 is (7 x 2 x 3 x
1,117)+1 or (37 x 4 x 317)-1 3,108 i s 7 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 7 o r
3 7 x 4 x 3 x 7 43,807 is 7 x 7 x 2 x 3 x 149 or 37 x 37 x 4 x 4 x 2
This division is by 7 x 6 (with 7x7) and by 37 x 4 (with 37 x 37 x 4 x 4).
The chance for this collocation is one i n 7 x 7 x 7 x 6 x 6 x 3 7 x 37 x 37 x
4 x 4 x 4 x 2 or 343 x 36 x 50,653 x 128 or 78,200,000,000.
As Jehoiachin's date is 18 years later, in 3418, these two vast schemes of
7's and 37's are destroyed by changing 3400 into 3418.
Incidentally these two schemes alone also establish every date as exact
from Adam. It is needless to add that when the Bible chronology was
established by Bible numerics, its discoverer knew nothing about its
bearing on the Jehoiachim, -chin question.
PAPER V
Order of Words.
(Matt. iv. 1)
As the values of words in the Bible are not affected by their order in the
text, the order cannot be determined from the values merely. Numerics,
however, do furnish methods of determining the order also. The case of
Matthew iv. 1 furnishes a good illustration of one, short, method.
The Authorized and Revised Versions, as well as Alford's English
Version of his own Greek Text, give the verse thus: 'Then was Jesus led up
into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil', with the Sinai
manuscript; the Alexandrian is defective



542 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
here. In his edition of the English New Testament for the German
Tauchnitz publishers of Volume 1,000 of their English Library,
Tischendorff uses the text of the Authorized Version, but notes the reading
of the Vatican (adopted by Westcott and Hort, and Alford in his Greek
text) as giving 'into the wilderness' immediately after 'led up'. The
Ephraemus supports the Vatican, but Tischendorff does not cite it, as he
gives only the readings of the Vatican, Sinai, and Alexandrian.
Here is the verse in the Greek as given according to the Vatican
manuscript in the Numeric Testament. (Wescott and Hort offer the
omission of the article before Jesus as an alternative in their uncertainty).
The place values precede the words:
The place value of the verse is:
868 or 7 x 4 x 31 or (11 x 79)-1 or (17 x 17 x 3)+1 The two middles:
120 or (7 x 17)+1 or (11 x 11)-1 or (17 x 7)+1 The rest:
748 or (7 x 107)-1 or 11 x 17 x 4 or 17 x 4 x 11
The chance for this division producing accidentally the sevens, elevens,
and seventeens is one in 7 x 7 x 7 x 11 x 11 x 11 x 11 x 17 x 17 x 17 / 2
(the sum of the figures of 868 being 22 or 2 elevens, or (7 x 3)+1; and the
sum of its factors 7, 4, and 31 being 6 sevens), or 5,500,000,000.
With the change of order this design of sevens, elevens, and seventeens
is destroyed.



APPENDIX II 543
The one collocation given here is only one of several that mere inspection
reveals; thus the two middle numbers that produce it, 69 and 51, have for
the sum of their figures 21, or 7 x 3 or (11 x 2)-1, and 69 is (17 x 4)+1 or (7 x
2 x 5)-1 51 is 17 x 3 reproducing by themselves the 7, 11, and 17. The last
number 77, and the largest, 119, produce numerics of their own, 77 being 7
x 11 and 119 being 7 x 17.
Thus by one item in the place values alone, the order is established; also
the article before Jesus, left uncertain by Westcott and Hort, is thus secured
against further suspicion.
PAPER VI
Interrogatives.
(Jas. ii. 1)
James ii. 1 is given by Westcott and Hort as a question without an
alternative. The American revisers give it as a command, with the
interrogative as the alternative. The ancient manuscripts having no
punctuation are here no help.
The second chapter of James has the following interrogative sentences,
with the number of words in each: ii. 1 has 13 ii. 14 has 6
4 has 9 15-6 have 33
5 has 20 19 has 6
6 has 11 20 has 14
7 has 10 21 has 16
14 has 13 25 has 17 = 168
The words in these 12 interrogative passages are 168, or 24 sevens
(Feature 1); of this the first, middle, and last (13, 13, 6, 17), with seven
figures (Feature 2) have 49 or seven sevens (Feature 3), and the others have
119 or 17 sevens (Feature 4).
This division produces twenty-four at the same time; thus: 49 is 7 x 7 or
(24 x 2)+1 119 is 7 x 17 or (24 x 5)-1 168 is 7 x 24 or 24 x 7 The same
division is produced by means of neighborhood thus: The units have 48 or
(7 x 7)-1 or 24 x 2. The tens have 120 or (7 x 17)+1 or 24 x 5, and with it
Features 5 and 6 of the sevens.



544 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
A third division producing the sevens and twenty-fours is:
The odd places have
71 or ( 7 x 2 x 5 ) +1 or (24x3)-1
The even places have
97 or (7 x 7 x 2)-1 or (24 x 2 x 2)+1, producing Features 7
and 8 of the sevens.
The numbers with one figure have 21 or 7 x 3 or (4 x 5)+1
The numbers with two figures have
147 or 7 x 7 x 3 or (4 x 37)-1
This division produces not only Features 9 and 10 of sevens, but
combines them with 3, producing at the same time a division by fours.
An elaborate design of sevens and twenty-fours thus runs through these
12 (half of 24) passages in the mere matter of the number of words in each;
99 the chance for mere coincidence being here so far only one
in7 x 7 x 7 x 7 x 7 x 7 x 7 x 7 x 7 x 7 x 24 x 24 x 24 x 24 x 3 x 3 or
282,475,249 x 331,776 or 84,000,000,000,000.
This enumeration is not exhaustive; as 168 is neighbour of 169 or 13 x
13, a scheme of thirteens also runs through these 12 or (13)-1 numbers. All
these designs are possible only with the thirteen words of ii. 1 which are
thus established as Interrogative, rather than a command.
PAPER VII
Romans xvi. 7. (Read Junia.)
The hitherto uncertainty whether the Greek, Iounian is the
accusative of Iounia, feminine, or Iounias, masculine, is now removed in
favor of Junia by Numerics thus:
Among the numerous persons saluted by Paul in Romans xvi are the
following seven women.



APPENDIX II 545
The figures in the seven place values preceding the names are seventeen
(Feature 1), their sum is 578, or 2 seventeens (Feature 2) of seventeens
(Feature 3), of which the first name has 102, or 6 seventeens, and the other
six have 476, itself 28 seventeens (Feature 4), with the sum of its figures
seventeen (Feature 5). This division, moreover, is by 2 seventeens; thus:
578 is 17 x 17 x 2
102 is 17 x 2 x 3
476 is 17 x 2 x 2 x 7 The numbers with two figures have
255, or 15 seventeens; those with three have 323 or 19 seventeens (Feature
6).
The two women who are named together, Tryphaena and Tryphosa, have
221, or 13 seventeens, leaving for the others 357, or 17 x 3 x 7, or 21
seventeens (Feature 7).
The three middle names have 288, leaving for those on each side of them
290, each neighbor of 289.
288 is (17 x 17)-1 or 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3
290 is (17x17)+1 or 2x5x29 so that this division is the
nearest possible unequal division into two halves, each of seventeen
(Feature 8) seventeens (Feature 9).
This enumeration of the numerics of the seven women (whose sole bond
is that they are named by Paul to be greeted among many others) is in
nowise exhaustive; but these suffice for the present purpose. The chance for
these numerics to be a mere coincidence here, undesigned, is (with due
allowance for the neighborhood feature which has not as good a chance as
the direct features of 17) one in
17x17x17x17x17x17x17x17x2x2x2x2x2x2, or 441,000,000,000, or 441
billions. An elaborate design of seventeens thus runs through the seven
names possible only with JUNIA, and is DESTROYED with its omission from
the list.



Appendix III
Over time there has developed a general academic view as to the origins of
the Essenes, which the evidence in this book completely disputes.
Nevertheless, it will help us if it is briefly outlined here.
At some vague point in the pre-Christian history of Israel (as it is
commonly understood) there occurred the development of a highly
complex and arcane luni-solar calendar. It was influential within the
Temple to the point of creating a division between the liberals, who wished
to stay with the existing method of measuring time, and the conservatives,
who sought to put in place what they understood to be the accurate means
of timing festivals and, indeed, the correct day of the sabbath, which, they
argued, could not be obtained from the simpler version.
With no resolution forthcoming, the conservatives (being in the
minority) withdrew from Jerusalem and formed communities such as
existed at Qumran, where they seemingly waited for the imminent
vengeance of God to fall upon the false Jews of Jerusalem. According to
these 'Essenes', the priests of the Temple were pious without purpose. God
would neither hear their prayers nor accept their sacrifices because of their
failure to keep the proper sabbath and feast days. This, it should be
understood, is the central theme of Essenism in the historical context
they claimed that only they could accurately time the festivals, and their
righteousness revolved around this.
The extreme accuracy with which time can be calculated with the Essene
system suggests that there is another dimension to its purpose. My proposal
is that this is related to the need for absolute precision in establishing the
correct time for passing through the stones of fire to speak to the gods. It
might thus be argued that this rigorous calculation of time dates back at
least to the Sumerians and that it was universal.
The calendar, which is secreted away in the pseudepigraphic Book of
Jubilees — a document formally acknowledged as Essene — is known to
have been unique to that group. The accepted view is that it was indeed the
order's raison d'etre. Jubilees itself is believed to have influenced Qumran
writings such as the Damascus Document (see CD 16: 2-4), the Hymns
Scroll, the Manual of



APPENDIX III 547
Discipline and the Cave 4 Florilegium. Thus, over and above the evidence
already presented in this book, finding the calendar in Scripture would
surely silence absolutely any critic. And if it was found to come directly
out of the mouth of Jesus himself this would obviously confirm him as the
Scrolls' Teacher and put yet another Essene signature on the Bible.
In Jubilees 2: 19-20 there is a repetition of the declaration that the chosen
of God are to be called from all nations. God will then sanctify them by
revealing the true sabbath to them — obviously from the mouth of the
Revealer of (this greatest of all the) Mysteries. It also follows here that if
an historical Jesus was the Teacher he would have revealed this, but he did
not.
Jubilees begins with Moses the teacher of the Law being called up to the
mountain of God (the tree) where he receives the two stone tablets with the
commandments upon them. He is then told all that is to befall Israel in the
'Last Days'. Chapter 1, verse 26 reads:
And you write down all of the matters which I shall reveal to you
on this mountain: that which was in the beginning and that which shall
be at the end, that which shall be in all the divisions of the days which
are in the Law and the testimony, and throughout their weeks of years
according to the Jubilees forever, until I shall descend and dwell with
them throughout eternity.
We have repeatedly seen that Jesus is just one of many versions of the
Teacher and that as Moses his task is to establish the Law for Israel. Central
to his task of revelation must be this Jubilees calendar, preserved for the
new humanity. Even the almost certain origin of the name 'Jesus' confirms
all this.
On page 33 of The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross, John M. Allegro
refers to Dioscorides, the first century writer on medicine, who speaks of
the ancient Persian magi. Apparently they were very reliable sources of
information on the names of plants, and were expert in their therapeutic
use. In this role they were called 'prophets' (prophetai). Allegro goes on to
say that this is interesting because the Sumerian word for 'physician' was A
ZU or I-ZU, which literally means 'water, oil expert'. The term also
described a prophet or seer as such.
It will be recalled that I have quoted Philo (on page 21) as referring to
Deuteronomy 32: 13, which speaks of two rocks, one providing oil (the
sun) and the other water (the word of God). He goes



548 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
on to tell us that these two rocks are one stone, which is feminine and is the
source of life and wisdom. Allegro says that the name 'Essene' probably
derives from A-ZU/I-ZU. Under these circumstances it seems to me very
likely that a latter-day Righteousness Teacher who is an obvious expert on
at least one plant — that of righteousness — and on the sun and the watery
word of God would have been given the name 'Jesus' as a derivative of A
ZU or I-ZU. It will also be recalled that I have derived the Hebrew
'Yehudim' (Jews) from Yeshu/Yeshua and pointed out that the priests of
Confucianism were the Ju, all of these obviously conveying the idea that
the new Israel is made up of those who follow the Teacher, whose real
name must be the basis for these word plays.
In Jubilees 6: 32 there is an exhortation to hold fast to the year of 364
days lest Israel falls into error. This ancient concept eventually gave rise to
the idea of a year and a day. The exhortation is followed by a convoluted
story about Noah planting a vine and subsequently getting drunk and
uncovering himself. After numerous covert allusions to festivals in
Scripture, two of his sons then walk backwards carrying on their shoulders
a cover with which to conceal his nakedness. This little allegory serves as a
means of denoting times and seasons in relation to the movement of the
planets.
A jubilee in Scripture and by tradition is taken to be fifty years. Well,
this is one of those cases where the answer is definitely yes and no. The
following gives us a wonderful sense of the meaning of the term 'chutzpa'
(cheek). The Book of Daniel is, as I have said, generally credited as being
of Essene origin. Chapter 9, verse 24 reads:
Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy
city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to
make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting right
eousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the
most Holy.
The following verse begins by saying 'Know therefore and understand...'
and goes on to say that the completion of the restoration will be 'seven
weeks'. In allegorical numerology this gives us a period of 7 x 70 = 490,
which is a well-established unit of time in Scripture. This 490 years is ten
times 49 years.
Jesus makes an allusion to this verse in Matthew 18: 21-22. Whereas
twelve signs (tribes/apostles) give us a solar measure of



APPENDIX III 549
time, thirteen give us a lunar one. Now, of all the apostles to whom Jesus
could be speaking in this instance, it is Peter the thirteenth rock who asks
the question. The verses read:
Then came Peter to him, and said Lord, how oft shall my brother
sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but,
Until seventy times seven.
Seventy times seven — like seven times seventy — is four hundred and
ninety years. In verse 23 the kingdom of heaven (the stars and planets) is
likened to a king who reckoned his debts. According to the biblical law of
Jubilee (Leviticus 25 and 27), all debts are cancelled and all property must
be returned during the festival. Curiously, this is pretty well the only
biblical law that even the most orthodox of modern Jews completely
ignores. The parable that follows the above exchange between Jesus and
Peter establishes the unit measure of ten. In the unlikely event that the
reader has missed the point, in the following chapter the Pharisees ask Jesus
if it is lawful for a man (solar) to put away his wife (lunar). In verse 5 Jesus
says they are to be of one flesh — the sun and the moon are to be reckoned
together. Later in this chapter the kingdom of heaven is likened to little
children. This terminology for the heavenly wanderers is very common in
myth.
If the reader has at this stage still missed the point, we are told by Jesus
in verse 23 of chapter 19 that 'a rich man (the sun) shall hardly enter into
the kingdom of heaven'. That is, do not make a purely solar calculation.
There is repetition in verse 24, where Jesus says:
And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the
eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
The calculation is as follows (see page 224):
The letter Gimel means camel and has the value 3
The letter Ayin means eye and has the value 70
The letter Vau is a pin or hook (needle) and has the value 6
Multiplying 3 x 70 x 6 we get 1260, which tells us that the problem is one
of harmonizing the planetary movements on a basis of more than twelve
and less than thirteen, as confirmed by related cabalistic correspondences.
See postscript on page 551.



550 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Leviticus 25: 8-10 reads:
And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall
be unto thee forty and nine years.
Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the
tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make
the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year...
The question arises as to whether this fiftieth year is solar or lunar. The
following calculations are made with the aid of Secrets of Time in
Prophecy by Stephen E. Jones.52
A lunar month comprises 29.53 days, and there are twelve of these in a
lunar year. A jubilee of lunar years would then be 50 x 12 months
comprising these 29.53 days, a total of 600. These fifty years would then be
600 x 29.53 days. This gives us 17,718 lunar days in a lunar jubilee. There
are 365.24 days in a solar year, as opposed to 354.36 days in the lunar
equivalent. The number of days in 48 solar years (the closest
approximation to 50 lunar years) is 365.24 x 48, which is 17,531.52. The
deficit in days between the solar and lunar calculations may be derived
thus:
17,718 days in 50 lunar years
17,531.52 days in 48 solar years 187
Starting with a theoretical date of the first day of the first month of the
first year, we begin our calculations in accord with the biblical year, which
begins in spring (Exodus 12: 2). This lunar calendar comprised 354.36708
days, it being eleven days short of the solar year. This is compensated for
by the periodic addition of a thirteenth month. The twelfth month being
Adar, the thirteenth is called Ve Adar. The year begins with the month
Nisan (also called Abib). See Exodus 13:4,23:15 and 34:18. Days begin in
the evening, and the time of appearance of the stars brings a further fine
tuning to the calculations.
Ignoring the fraction (.52 amounts to an error of a little over fifteen
minutes per year, for which compensation can easily be made, as in the
resurrection sequence), the sum above indicates a difference of 187 days
between the lunar jubilee and its solar equivalent.



APPENDIX III 551
This, when added to our biblical calendar starting at Nisan in the theoretical
spring on the first of the first of the first, takes us to the tenth day of the
seventh month. Thus, the beginning of the seventh sabbath year (7 x 7 =
49) on 10 - 7 - 48 is precisely the same as the number of days in fifty lunar
years. Now, as extraordinary 'coincidence' would have it, this brings us
exactly to the Day of Atonement that begins the forty-ninth year sabbath.
That is, the beginning jubilee year is also the beginning of the forty-ninth
sabbath year. The trumpet being blown at the end of the year.
Using the above approach, the difficulty of harmonizing the cycles of the
sun with those of the moon is overcome.
This, it will be clear, is but a preliminary examination of the Essene
calendar. My contention is that the revelations of the Righteousness
Teacher will be along these lines and obviously in far greater depth.
Postscript to Appendix III
If we create a theoretical pyramid with the diameter of the earth (7920 miles) as its
base and its apex at the centre of the moon, imagined as touching the earth, its shape
would be exactly that of the Great Pyramid, the angle of slope of the sides being 51°
51'. The height of this pyramid — the sum of the radii of the earth and the moon
is 5040 miles, which is the number of the phrase 'The kingdoms of our Lord, and of
his Christ' (Revelation 11: 15). Its base perimeter is 31,680 miles (4 x 7920), and, as
has already been noted, 3168 is the number of 'Lord Jesus Christ'. It is also the sum
of the numerical values of the names of the twelve tribes as given in Genesis 49.
The radius of the moon in miles —1080 — is the gematria of 'The heaven is my
throne, and the earth is my footstool' (Isaiah 66: 1). Its diameter — 2160 — is the
number of 'The stone which the builders rejected' (Mark 12: 10 etc.).
This is not the place to go into great detail, but the reality that the Great Pyramid
is both a time machine and an absolutely perfect universal calendar finds illustration
in the fact that its base side length is 365.242 sacred cubits, the exact number of
days required for the earth to orbit the sun. Not a very likely coincidence,
particularly when all the other measurements of that silent sentinel in the sands of
Egypt are taken into account.



Appendix IV
While Rome was sinking beneath the Pauline heresy, Western Europe,
under the guidance of the Merovingian Fisher Kings, took a more sensible
view. Jesus was a man with a prophetic role — a messenger from God
but nevertheless only a man. One of the bishops attending the Council of
Nicea in 325 CE was a Libyan by the name of Arius. He was a leading
proponent of this viewpoint, and it subsequently came to be known as the
Arian heresy. It is at this point that the die is cast for our age. There is a
populist people's religious revolution and the Church sets the stage for the
great merchandisers. History, at this juncture, begins to be written in blood
— the Holy Blood.
It will be recalled that Godfroi de Bouillon, who was the Duke of Lower
Lorraine and a Merovingian brother of Count Eustace III of Boulogne, was,
in 1099 CE, offered the kingship of Jerusalem, which he declined in favour
of Baudouin I. But it was not the first time that this kind of momentous
event had occurred: the family's links with the Davidic throne had, by this
time, long since been established.
Our story begins in earnest in about 655 CE, up till which time Rome
had not been strong enough to take on the Merovingians of the west and
eradicate Arianism, which was a serious threat to its political ambitions.
The idea that Jesus was God was obviously popular with the uneducated
masses. If, despite the fact that they obviously knew better, the bishops
could establish that the Church was his only representative on earth, the
Roman empire might well have a renaissance. But such an outlandish idea
needed universal acceptance if it was to succeed.
The Merovingian King Sigisbert II died in 655 CE when his son
Dagobert was only five years old. With Roman connivance, Grimoald, one
of Sigisbert's ministers, abducted the child, sent him to Ireland and put his
own son upon the throne. Twenty years later Dagobert (II) returned,
married Gizelle de Razes at Rennes-le-Chateau, exposed the conspiracy and
took back the crown. This was Rome's first serious attempt to subvert the
Merovingians. It failed, but a more successful operation followed a few
years later.
In 679 CE, by the treachery of the Papacy, Dagobert was assassinated by
henchmen of Pepin the Fat of Herstal, at Stenay in the



APPENDIX IV 553
Ardennes. The Pope very quickly nominated Pepin as king in his stead, and
thus began the dynasty of the Carolingians. Pepin fathered the bastard
Charles (Carolus) Martel, who gave this family its only distinction — his
prowess as a commander in the field. Martel drove the Moors back to
Narbonne, in the south, which then became the Arab centre of resistance,
and from there they would shift no more.
The next of these fellows to take the throne was Pepin the Short, who
conceived of the idea of coming to an understanding with the Sephards of
Narbonne in regard to another attempt to get rid of the Moors. They were
willing to cooperate, but with two major conditions. The first was that,
should a positive outcome result, they be allocated their own kingdom; the
second was that they be allowed to choose their own king — a descendant
from the Royal House of David.
The Moors were indeed expelled, and the Jewish kingdom of Septimania
(the Midi) was established. Then came the choice of their king. Which
venerable Jew did they select? Wrong question. In 768 CE the Sephardic
Jews chose Guilhelm de Toulouse, the son of Theodoric — a Merovingian
— to be their king, on the basis that he was a direct descendant of the
House of Judah.
I can find no record of how the Princes of the Talmud reacted to what
must have seemed as treachery. Fortunately for them, at about this time the
ferocious Khazar tribes living to the north-east of the Caspian Sea were
dropping like flies at the feet of Jehovah. But could we be missing
something very important here? The fact is that the Sangreal — this royal
bloodline of the Jews from David's house — eventually produced the Stuart
kings of Scotland. This provides an amazingly revelatory backdrop to
British history, filling in a plethora of gaps. But the question must be asked:
Why did the Sephards do that? It is entirely out of character for the people
we know as the Jews to elect a gentile and proclaim him a direct descendant
of Judah. Or is it that we do not know the real Jews at all? And was this
king, in the real sense, a Gentile?
The Merovingians must have known what lay ahead well before the
advent of the Roman Church. Many of the Sephardim, or at least their
aristocracy, would have been privy to this knowledge and party to it also. I
would again draw the analogy of a coin flipping over: one era was coming
to an end and another beginning. The new would eventually obliterate any
record of the old. But it must be realized that there was a time when the old
order had as



554 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
much power as the usurper. The problem is that we do not see it now
because the coin flipped such a long time ago.
When Pope Innocent's soldiers ravaged the Languedoc, which they did
for some thirty-five years, they were in fact conquering what had much
earlier been the territory of the Sephardic Septimania — destroying the
'heresy' that these spiritual Jews had planted and burying the knowledge
that they had passed on. For the Cathars were the philosophical
descendants of these people who held that the Merovingians were their true
kings.
Out of the eight crusades which culminated in 1291 CE there emerged
many chivalric orders, including the Knights Protectors of the Sacred
Sepulchre, the Ordre de Sion and, of course, Le Chevalier de la Croix (the
Templars), whose existence actually preceded their supposed foundation by
Hugues de Payens. When, much later, they were all forced off the official
stage of history, many of those in France went to Portugal and regrouped as
the Knights of Christ. Scotland became the refuge for those knights who
had been based in England and were banned (with some reluctance) by the
English king. Perhaps because of their remoteness, the highlands became a
major centre of activity. The fact of the matter is that they still had one very
important task to perform.
The Portuguese order attracted men like Ferdinand Magellan, Vasco da
Gama and Christopher Columbus, whose biographers seem to be agreed
was a mystic and a solitary. It is more than passing queer that this 'sailor
who found America' did not — or so the documentary evidence suggests
know his own birthday or have a clear idea of the proper spelling of his
name. On the face of it, it is a wonder that this great navigator could
actually find his shoes and his ships.
It is also notable that Columbus made no effort to win the kudos of
having the discovery credited to him, and the continent being given his
name. This honour ultimately went to an also ran: Amerigo Vespucci
(1451-1512). But here we find yet another link in this mysterious chain of
events.
The discovery of the New World was first accredited to Vespucci by a
monk named Waldseemuller in his 1507 A New Introduction to
Cosmography. He was also known by the esoteric name of Hylacomy-lus,
and was — most interestingly — from the Duchy of Lorraine, a major
centre of the Templars and Merovingians. Another curious connection is
that Columbus was sponsored by Leonardo da Vinci, who later (1510)
became Grand Master of the Prieure de Sion.



APPENDIX IV 555
The solution to the puzzle is to be found in the church at Roslin, near
Edinburgh. The building of Rosslyn Chapel was begun in 1446 by William
St Clair (Sinclair) and completed by his son Oliver in 1486. Columbus set
sail across the Atlantic on 3 August 1492, six years after the chapel's
completion. The St Clairs are direct descendants of the Merovingians, and
have very long and well established Templar and Masonic connections.
Rosslyn Chapel, a major centre of activity for Le Chevalier de la Croix,
expresses this very clearly in its architecture, so much so that one often
finds it referred to as the chapel of the Holy Grail. But — and this is the
most fascinating point of all — it is liberally decorated with stone carvings
of plants that grew only in America. At the very latest, these carvings were
completed six years before Columbus set off, and probably a hundred years
before American maize and aloe were known in Europe. Again, in what I
have come to think of as my book of coincidences, William Sinclair was
Earl of Caithness, Chancellor and Grand Admiral of Scotland. It thus now
comes as no surprise to find that the Templars had long since known about
the continent across the Atlantic, which they called La Merika. Its
subsequent naming for Amerigo Vespucci has then to fall into the category
of likely tale.
Let us now put this matter into its proper perspective. The remarkable
part of the story is the grail connection. That contact with the Americas
predates Columbus is well known, and that it may be very ancient has been
well argued by investigators such as Jim Bailey, who has competently put
the case in his Sailing to Paradise.53 More than adequate support for the
Merovingian connection can be found in Bloodline of the Holy Grail by
Laurence Gardner,54 who is the Chevalier Labhran de St Germain, Prior of
the Celtic Church's Sacred Kindred of Saint Columba, Presidential Attache
to the European Council of Princes, Historiographer Royal and a member
of the noble household guard of the Royal House of Stewart. That the
Templars — and, indeed, the Sinclairs — went to America before
Columbus would seem to be undeniable. That this Knight of Christ, flying
the Templar blazon, sailed on his voyage of discovery with ready-made
maps seems equally certain. It likewise now becomes clear as to why the
US war of independence and the establishment of the Republic were so
substantially influenced by Freemasons.
The Grand Plan had been established long ago, and the discovery of
America was made at the propitious time. It was a step along the path of
progressive revelation and enactment. Two thousand years ago mankind set
sail upon the dreadful Piscean sea. Without



556 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
these navigators to show the way, not only would there be no future, the
ship would have sunk before reaching this point in time. Given the stormy
nature of this cruel sea, there would now be nobody to write this history,
and certainly no-one left to read it.
Traditionally, man (the masculine) has thought of woman (the feminine)
as irrational, illogical, impractical and therefore insufferable. For example,
were we — however gently — to tell a proponent of this view that we
believed his society's knowledge of astronomy was far exceeded by that of
the old shepherd who trudges the miles over yonder hills and measures the
universe with a rough-cut stone, no doubt we would be deafened by the
howls of laughter. But watch, I can prove this to be true.
The principle in cabalistic numerology is that like explains like. In
Hebrew, 'shepherd' has the number value 275. A square with such sides has
a perimeter (4 x 275) of 1100. The biblical Greek for 'stone' totals 110. If
275 were the diameter of a circle, the circumference would be 864, and
864,000 miles is the diameter of the sun. If this perimeter is then turned
into a square, each side would be 216, and the diameter of the moon is
2160 miles.
The apparent immaturity of this way of expressing astronomical science
is belied by the actual truth of these measurements. Our shepherd isn't as
stupid as he looks. The old fellow might lean upon his crook and say of
those who subscribe to this arrogant mentality that they are pagan idolators
who worship their own selves; their gods are devils, and they make devils
of the gods. Having noted what we have seen so far, we had better look a
bit more closely at what this man is saying.
The beast in Revelation 13: 18 has, as we know, the number 666. Prior to
the publication of St John's enigmatic book, the symbol for value 6 (stigma)
had been dropped from the Greek alphabet and its phonetic burden taken by
sigma. As a textual convenience, sigma is taken to have the original stigma
value (see page 220). If it were given its sigma value (200), the total of this
word would be 860. In Genesis 1: 1 God (Elohim) has the value 86.
Further, the sum of the factors of 3168 (Lord Jesus Christ) is 6660. What is
more: 'Man of Sin' has the value 2260.
'Image of the Beast' has the value 2260.
'Son of Man' (an appellation for Jesus: like
wise has the value 2260.
Further, the values of 'the Son of Perdition' and
'Power of Christ' are both 2385.



APPENDIX IV 557
It will be recalled that I have said Jerusalem, as the city of the Antichrist,
will become the capital of our modern Babylon. My identification of her as
the Khazar Jewish whore has total support from Scripture, for 'Babylon'
and 'the holy city Jerusalem' both
have the value 1285.
These are just a few examples. To dismiss them as coincidence is, in my
opinion, crass and bloody-minded stupidity.
On examination, these numbers are also found to be relevant to Poussin's
'Les Berger d'Arcadie', in which appear the enigmatic words 'et in arcadia
ego'. Taking 'arcadia' to be a homophone, the reference is to the Arca Dei
— the Ark of the Covenant, or, as we have come to know it, the cosmic
tree. Properly, the above phrase should read 'et in arcadia ego sum', the
addition of this final word putting it into grammatical order and giving it
the present tense. Thus, as was found to be the case with Joseph and Mary
at Glastonbury, the words quite correctly inform us that the sun is
entombed in the Ark, and that — not the dead — but the true and living
Jesus the Messiah is to be found in France: in Languedoc.
In our time Iesu has led us a merry dance: the Arcam Dei tango. That is
to say, if you exclude Jesus, you will behold the Ark of God
— the cosmic tree. Logically enough, this new phrase, formed by
removing from the previous one the letters I, E, S and U and deriv
ing an anagram, contains thirteen letters.
It is a fact that every liar, in order to appear genuine, must speak with at
least a little honesty. Accordingly, in Galatians 4: 16, that horrible
blasphemer Paul is made to say:
Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
Is all this new? Have I just discovered it or invented it? No. I could point
you to at least a hundred books in which all this and much more can easily
be found. This tells us something about our Righteousness Teacher. It is
obviously to be doubted that what he uncovers is not to some degree known
already to a few. His ability
— and his role — is to bring it to the attention of the masses. It will
now be abundantly clear that history does not result from a series
of disconnected accidents. It has been written by the Grand
Architect of the Universe and enacted by men to whom he gave
extraordinary power — men whose intellect and understanding
were beyond our comprehension.

Glossary
The following statements summarise the author's interpretation of the
meaning of key biblical and other names and terms. These are offered for
the assistance of readers who wish to consolidate their understanding of the
approach, having already followed the argument behind the concepts.
Aaron
Moses told God that he was unsuitable for the job he had appointed him
to because he was not clever of speech. The Lord therefore gave him
Aaron, whom He could have chosen for the job in the first place. As it is
the setting of the sun in the cosmic tree (see Cosmic tree) that is the
primary source of the revelation, and given that Aaron means 'illumined', 1
take him to be our sun entering Aquarius (see Reuben).
Abraham
Abraham is the constellation Taurus, the earth having been in this sign
from approximately 4000 to 2000 BCE. Taurus is the birth sign of the
Scrolls' Righteousness Teacher; thus, as a creator of wisdom, Abraham
like Adam — is also a form of the Revealer of Mysteries: a First Man
archetype.
Bread
In Scripture bread is knowledge, and so it is a staple to the spirit as
ordinary bread is such to the body.
Christ
Christ is separate from Jesus; she is the Goddess, who, by association
with Jesus, acquired a masculine gender. This 'Christ' is the spirit within
that makes a man Christed — a Messiah.
Coma
A minor sign of the zodiac within the constellation Virgo, taken to be the
thirteenth sign/stone (see Stone). Coma's significance is in her long flowing
tresses, her hair being the abode of the spirits. (A non-biblical name.)



562 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Corn/Wheat/Grain
As they are the raw material of bread (see Bread), they symbolize the
source of knowledge. As mother of the thirteenth sign (see Coma), Virgo
holds corn in her hand.
Cosmic tree
It is at the same time a map of the universe and a diagram of the human
body. In Scripture it is the tree of life, the tree of knowledge, the Ark of the
Covenant; it is the Temple in Jerusalem and the city New Jerusalem. It
seems to have been a sort of shamanic cosmic telephone. It should be noted
that in one sense there are two cosmic trees: that which has lived in our
age, without its truth stone (see Stone, Sephiroth), and that with the
thirteenth sign, which the children of Aquarius will use to speak to the
gods.
Dagon
A version of the idol Jesus (see Jesus, Fish).
Fish
Mercurial wisdom as it rises up from the Piscean sea, the watery womb
of the virgin (see Mary).
Gematria
A form of codification of information in the numerology that lies
beneath the text of the Bible. (A non-biblical term.)
Hand
Inasmuch as it is the one part of the body upon which our destiny is
written, and insofar as the fingers are symbolic rays, the hand, in Scripture,
is a symbol of the sun.
Isaac
The constellation Aries and an incarnation of the Teacher. The earth was
in this sign from about 2000 to 0 BCE.
Jacob
The constellation Pisces. The earth entered this sign 2000 years ago
when Jesus the fish god is said to have been born (see Jesus, Dagon, Fish).
We are now about to enter Aquarius (see Reuben). His name means
'standing stone', and it was later changed to 'Israel' by God. This shows us
that He speaks to man through stones and creates Israel from them.



GLOSSARY 563
Jesus
Jesus represents three separate characters: a non-person fish idol that was
and is worshipped and has dispensed false wisdom in our age; the Jesus in
Luke who is the Scrolls' Righteousness Teacher; and the Jesus in Matthew
who is the Scrolls' Messianic King. As the idol, he is a prophetic
incarnation of the coming Antichrist.
Joseph
Joseph represents our sun in the heavens, a star (see Star). His beaming
down upon the watery womb of the Piscean sea (see Mary) makes him
father to Jesus the Teacher and causes the stone/star of wisdom (see Star) to
rise in the tree.
Mary
There are three Marys in the New Testament, and each is an aspect of the
Triple-Headed Goddess. The name in Hebrew is 'Mariam', which means the
sea, and she is that watery womb/Piscean sea from which the mercurially
wise Jesus fish/Teacher rises up (see Jesus, Fish).
Nun
Nun is a letter of the Hebrew alphabet and also a symbol for the number
50. It means 'fish', and the symbol resembles a fish. I have made an
association with the 50 Anunnaki (fish-men creators) and the Argonauts.
Jason, their leader, is the Greek Jesus. Nun was also the Old Testament
High Priest father of Joshua (Hebrew for Jesus), Joshua being a version of
Matthew's messianic King Jesus.
Reuben
The firstborn son of Jacob (see Isaac, Jacob) and the sign Aquarius; thus
he represents the dawn of the Golden Age.
Rich man
Possessing the necessities and comforts of life in abundance, as is the
case with Joseph in Egypt (see Joseph) and Joseph of Arima-thea, a rich
man in Scripture signifies our sun.
Sephiroth (singular: sephirah)
This term applies solely to the orbs or stations upon the cosmic tree, and
should not be confused with stones (see Stones). The tree is a diagram of
the universe; we might say that the sephiroth and the paths are the stations
where the stones (signs of the zodiac) belong.



564 THE THIRTEENTH STONE
Shepherds
Shepherds are magi (wise men of the occult sciences) who care for the
sheep, a term that refers to Israel (the congregation).
Star
The Star (sun) and Star/Teacher of the Scrolls are both separate and
synonymous. Jesus the Teacher is both the son of Joseph (the sun) and his
brother, and they are joint fathers of Jesus the Messianic King in Matthew.
Hence the Star of Bethlehem is Jesus the Teacher in Luke who leads the
magi (wise men) to the birth of the saviour.
Stones
Stones are stars or constellations of stars, the source of all knowledge
and understanding. The thirteenth stone is the constellation Coma in Virgo
(see Coma, Mary). It is the seat, womb and vagina of the Goddess, the
point of entry and spiritual birth from the cosmic tree (see Cosmic tree).
This is the stone Jesus says the builders rejected when building the old
temple/tree. Being permanent and unchanging, stones are symbols of
eternal truth.
Vine
The grape is used to produce wine (see Wine), and the vine is thus a
form of the cosmic tree (see Cosmic tree).
Water
Water is the universal unconscious, the mind of God. It represents also
the words or wisdom that flow directly from His mouth. This water is to the
spirit as ordinary water is to the natural body, which is largely composed of
water. All things were created by the Word.
Well
An endless source of water (see Water) and hence a symbol of Scripture.
Wine
Wine is the Christ spirit (see Christ). As wine intoxicates the body and
the mind, biblical wine intoxicates the spirit. Christ the Goddess is the
ultimate intoxicating love, and subsequently there is a marriage of heaven
and earth out of which Israel is born — from the stone (see Jacob) which
the builders rejected.
