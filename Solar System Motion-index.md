If this is the case then the observable of the stars moving
across the sky at 50+ ̋p/y (a.k.a. precession) may actually
contain some geometric effect (similar to parallax)
as seen from a moving SS. According to the USNO, this
type of observable would be seen from any planet that
is part of a binary or multiple star system. The motion
of the stellar system around its common center of mass
would cause a change in orientation to points outside that
moving frame commensurate with the periodicity of the
binary orbit, plus or minus local effects.
WHAT ARE WE OBSERVING?
The observable of the stars moving across the sky at
approximately 30 degrees per month is obviously due to
orbital motion - the earth’s orbit around the sun. Could
the observable of the stars moving retrograde across
the sky at the rate of about 30 degrees per 2000 years,
(a.k.a. the precession of the equinox) also be due mainly
to orbital motion; the orbit of our solar system around
another star?
If so, it would produce the observable we now call the
“precession of the equinox” yet have little to do with local
dynamics. (See Possible Kepler Solution)

DOES SOLAR SYSTEM MOTION MATTER?

PARALLAX OR PRECESSION?
The observable known as precession may include a component of geometric effect - seen from a moving solar system.
A STATIC SOLAR SYSTEM MODEL
Changes in the earth’s orientation are measured to VLBI
reference points far outside the moving frame of the solar
system – yet do not account for motion of that frame.
When the lunisolar theory of precession was developed
astronomers were unaware the SS moved. SS motion is
now accepted, and while its magnitude is unknown, it is
artificially constrained by lunisolar theory that requires
all changes in earth orientation to be attributed to “local”
dynamics. This legacy argument forces a static solar
system model, and a quasi pre-Copernican assumption
“it does not move”.
SOLAR SYSTEM ON THE MOVE
MOTION OF SOLAR SYSTEM
Opher et al., 2007/Science
Our solar system flies through space in the shape of
a speeding bullet, according to data from NASA’s two
Voyager spacecraft.
CONCLUSION
Motion of the frame of the solar system must be
accounted for when measuring changes in the earth’s
orientation to points outside that moving frame.
The observable of the stars moving across the sky by
about 30 degrees per 2000 years (a.k.a. precession) is
most likely a geometric effect like parallax (due to the
motion of the SS), having very little to do with local
dynamics. With this knowledge the precession nutation
model can be simplified and problems can be solved.
Most will argue that a dynamic SS model cannot be
taken seriously until the cause of its motion is found (a
companion star?). But given the far greater accuracy of
this model we should not ignore the advice of a certain
16th century astronomer that once said:
“E pur si muove”
IMPLICATIONS
Given the fact the moving solar system model can create
all the same observables of the change in orientation
called “precession”, and given the fact a moving solar
system model is a more accurate predictor of changes in
the rate of reorientation, we have to seriously consider if
there might be something wrong with lunisolar
dynamics.
One possibility is that the moon causes nutation, but the
sun may have no effect on the oblate earth at the time of
the equinox (when the sun’s gravity acting on the oblate
spheroid is equalized), and the slight tug that peaks on
the solstices may be offset by a third body aligned in the
solstial direction. If this is correct then the major forces
are accounted for, but they result mainly in nutation,
requiring much of the so called precession observable to
have another cause – solar system motion.
A dynamic SS model addresses many problems:
Solves precession observation paradox. Understanding
the SS is a moving frame explains the difference in pre
cession measurements to local objects vs. VLBI measure
ments to distant objects.
Explains why the precession rate change is presently
increasing (even though the moon is not getting any
closer) and puts limits on the maximum and minimum
precession rate over any given 24,000 year cycle.
Provides a simple, reliable and accurate way to predict
incremental changes in the precession rate. Solves pre
dictability problem.
Simplifies earth orientation and coordinate systems
issues: the earth goes around the sun 360 degrees in a
tropical year with a relatively stable axis (except for nu
tation and purely local effects). Most of its major motion
(50.290966 ̋p/y in J2000) is because the solar system
moved by this amount NOT because the earth wobbled
by this amount.
It might also answer the sun’s loss of angular momentum
(AM) relative to the planets problem and possibly shed
light on anomalous acceleration of spacecraft flybys,
Gravity Probe B problems, Voyager 1 and 2 results, IBEX
data, stellar position software, etc.
BINARY MODEL - KEPLER SOLUTION
An observer on a planet in a binary system would notice a change in orientation at a rate
commensurate to the orbit period around the common center of mass. (USNO)
With minor local effects and no eccentricity, this type of change in orientation at 50 ̋p/y
would equate to an orbit periodicity of 25,920 years. (1,296,000/50 = 25,920).
At 54 ̋p/y, again with minor local effects and no eccentricity, this type of change in
orientation would equate to 24,000 years (1,296,000/54 = 24,000).
In 1894, about the same time that the great astronomer Simon Newcomb gave us a
precession formula with a constant of .000222 p/y (designed to predict changes in the
precession rate), an Indian astronomer, Sri Yukteswar, explained that the moving equinox
(precession) was a result of a moving solar system and he gave us a binary orbit periodicity
of 24,000 years, with apoapsis at 500 A.D. Thus, one scientist gave us a strictly local
dynamics model and the other a strictly non-local dynamic SS model. Which model was
more accurate over the next 100 years?
100 YEAR TEST
From Yukteswar’s orbit parameters, and
utilizing the same rate of change numbers
that Newcomb used for the period before
1900, we can apply Kepler’s laws to
Yukteswar’s orbit data (constrained by
a 24,000 year orbit period and apoapsis
at 500A.D.) to come up with a forced
eccentricity and expected rate of change
for the 100 year period between 1900 and
2000 of .000349 ̋p/y.
Yukteswar = .000349 ̋p/y
Newcomb = .000222 ̋p/y
The actual rate of change for the
precession observable (or change in
angular velocity traveled by the solar
system along its binary orbit path in the
dynamic SS model – seen as parallax)
was .000346”p/y.
.000346 - .000349 = .000003 ̋ .000346 - .000222 = .000124 ̋ .000124 / .000003 = 41
Comparing Yukteswar’s and Newcomb’s
predictions to the actual we find the
dynamic SS model to be 41 times more
accurate than the lunisolar precession
model over the last 100 years.
SEPARATING THE COMPONENTS
Nutation is obviously driven by local dynamics as its 18.6-year signature
reflects the timing of the moon’s orbit parameters. And Chandler wobble
and other short-term polar motions would also appear to have a basis in
local dynamics.
PROBLEMS WITH CURRENT THEORY
The history of the lunisolar precession model suggests something is wrong:
Newtons’ equations did not work. D’Alembert and others since have added
and changed input values until they fit the observable of approximately 50 ̋
p/y. Designed to fit the data they appear accurate but lack predictability.
Consequently the model has been changed repeatedly over the last few
hundred years and now (the 2000A version) includes almost 1400 terms
yet it still fails to accurately predict “changes” in the precession rate. While
the continued revisions are written to get us ever closer to the observed
number they have failed a key test: dynamic equivalence.
In 2006 the IAU declared the precession nutation model is
“not consistent with dynamical theory” (IAU P03).

ACCORDING TO JPL VLBI
“Changes in the Earth’s orientation in inertial space have two causes: the gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon and the redistribution of total angular momentum among the solid Earth, ocean, and atmosphere. VLBI makes a direct measuremnt of the Earth’s orientation in space from which geoscientists then model such phenomena as atmospheric angular momentum, ocean tides and currents, and the elastic response of the solid Earth.”

Change in arc length traveled p/y by a body in a 24,000 year elliptical orbit from apoapsis, 500 AD, to periapsis, 12,500 AD.
Change in arc length travelled p/y by a body in 24,000 year elliptical orbit from 1700 AD to 2100 AD.
Rate should range from a low of about 50” p/y to a high of about 62” p/y.
PRECESSION RATE TRENDS ANALYSIS - LAST 100 YEARS
The first nine points are from Newcomb (or use Newcomb’s methodology) and the last three are from the Astronomical Almanac. The red line is a plot of the rate of increase (in arc length) required for a body in a 24,000 year orbit (Dynamic Solar System Model). Note the slope of the red line better fits the long term precession observable.
365.24219878 x 86400s = 366.24219878 x 86164.0905382s = 31,556,925.97s
This equation describes Earth's complete 360° period of revolution of 31,556,925.97s relative to a fixed frame of reference, implying that the position of the vernal equinox remains fixed with respect to the orientation of Earth's axis in space. The total number of rotations of Earth in such a complete orbit is expressed by the equations:
1 ÷ (1- (86164.0905382 s ÷ 86400 s)) = 366.24219878
86400 s ÷ 235.9094618 s = 366.24219878
No precession with respect to the SS frame.
ROTATION-TIME EQUIVALENCE
PRECESSION MEASUREMENT PARADOX
Studies show that changes in earth’s orientation relative to
objects “inside” the SS (i.e. Sun, Moon, Venus, etc.) are negligible
(less than an arc second or two p/y), whereas changes in earth
orientation relative to objects “outside” the moving frame of the
SS (fixed stars, quasars, etc.) are over 50 ̋p/y. In fact, rotation
time equivalence studies and lunar studies show the earth hardly
“precesses” at all relative to objects within the SS.
Most astronomers acknowledge this
in practice by using a non-precessing
tropical frame to locate objects “inside”
the SS, whereas they require a precessing
sidereal frame (or T[J2000]+PxY) to find
objects “outside” the moving SS.
But all of these are relatively small
compared to the 50+ ̋p/y precession
observable, which causes the tropical
year to differ from the sidereal year
by more than 20 minutes. This delta is
comparable to the delta we see between
the tropical day and sidereal day due to
the earth’s orbital motion.
