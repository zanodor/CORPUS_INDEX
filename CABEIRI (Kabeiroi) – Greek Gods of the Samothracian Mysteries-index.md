>> >> Cabeiri (Kabeiroi)
THE KABEIROI (Cabeiri) were twin gods
(daimones) who presided over the orgiastic
dances of the mysteries of Samothrake
(Samothrace) which were held in honour of the
goddesses Demeter, Persephone, and Hekate.
They were famed metal-workers, dwarfish sons
of the god Hephaistos (Hephaestus), who served
their father at his Lemnian forge. Like their
mother Kabeiro (Cabeiro) the pair were also sea
divinities who came to the aid of sailors in distress.
According to Clement the Kabeiroi were three in number, but two of
the brothers committed an act of fratricide. The pair later recovered
the phallus of Zagreus who had been dismembered by the Titan
gods and established it in the shrine of the Mysteries. In the Cabiri
by Aeschylus, the two gods welcomed the Argonauts to their island
and initiated them in a drunken orgy.
The Kabeiroi were closely identified with a number of other
korybantic daimones including the Cretan Kouretes (Curetes), the
Trojan Daktyloi (Dactyls), and the Phrygian Korybantes (Corybantes).
According to some the Samothrakain Kabeiroi were a larger group of
deities which included not only the sons of Hephaistos but also
several Korybantic sons of the god Apollon. Both groups were
portrayed as shield-clashing, dancing warriors of the orgies.
Kedalion (Cedalion), the Lemnian attendant of Hephaistos, was
sometimes numbered amongst the Kabeiroi. The twin gods were



also identified with the Dioskouroi (Dioscuri) especially in the myth of
the Argonauts.

ENCYCLOPEDIA
CABEIRI (Kabeiroi), mystic divinities who occur in various parts of the
ancient world. The obscurity that hangs over them, and the
contradictions respecting them in the accounts of the ancients
themselves, have opened a wide field for speculation to modern
writers on mythology, each of whom has been tempted to propound
a theory of his own. The meaning of the name Cabeiri is quite
uncertain, and has been traced to nearly all the languages of the
East, and even to those of the North; but one etymology seems as
plausible as another, and etymology in this instance is a real ignis
fatuus to the inquirer. The character and nature of the Cabeiri are as
obscure as the meaning of their name. All that we can attempt to do
here is to trace and explain the various opinions of the ancients
themselves, as they are presented to us in chronological succession.



We chiefly follow Lobeck, who has collected all the passages of the
ancients upon this subject, and who appears to us the most sober
among those who have written upon it. (Aglaopham. pp. 1202-1281.)
The earliest mention of the Cabeiri, so far as we know, was in a
drama of Aeschylus, entitled Kabeiroi, in which the poet brought
them into contact with the Argonauts in Lemnos. The Cabeiri
promised the Argonauts plenty of Lemnian wine. (Plut. Sympos. ii. 1;
Pollux, vi. 23; Bekker, Anecd. p. 115.) The opinion of Welcker (Die
Aeschyl. Trilog. p. 236), who infers from Dionysius (i. 68, &c.) that
the Cabeiri had been spoken of by Arctinus, has been satisfactorily
refuted by Lobeck and others. From the passage of Aeschylus here
alluded to, it appears that he regarded the Cabeiri as original
Lemnian divinities, who had power over everything that contributed
to the good of the inhabitants, and especially over the vineyards. The
fruits of the field, too, seem to have been under their protection, for
the Pelasgians once in a time of scarcity made vows to Zeus, Apollo,
and the Cabeiri. (Myrsilus, ap. Dionys. i. 23.) Strabo in his discussion
about the Curetes, Dactyls, &c. (x. p. 466), speaks of the origin of
the Cabeiri, deriving his statements from ancient authorities, and
from him we learn, that Acusilaus called Cadmilus a son of Cabeiro
and Hephaestus, and that he made the three Cabeiri the sons, and
the Cabeirian nymphs the daughters, of Cadmilus. According to
Pherecydes, Apollo and Rhytia were the parents of the nine
Corybantes who dwelled in Samothrace, and the three Cabeiri and
the three Cabeirian nymphs were the children of Cabeira, the
daughter of Proteus, by Hephaestus. Sacrifices were offered to the
Corybantes as well as the Cabeiri in Lemnos and Imbros, and also in
the towns of Troas. The Greek logographers, and perhaps Aeschylus
too, thus considered the Cabeiri as the grandchildren of Proteus and
as the sons of Hephaestus, and consequently as inferior in dignity to
the great gods on account of their origin. Their inferiority is also
implied in their jocose conversation with the Argonauts, and their



being repeatedly mentioned along with the Curetes, Dactyls,
Corybantes, and other beings of inferior rank. Herodotus (iii. 37)
says, that the Cabeiri were worshipped at Memphis as the sons of
Hephaestus, and that they resembled the Phoenician dwarf-gods
(Pataïkoi) whom the Phoenicians fixed on the prows of their ships. As
the Dioscuri were then yet unknown to the Egyptians (Herod. ii. 51),
the Cabeiri cannot have been identified with them at that time.
Herodotus proceeds to say, "the Athenians received their phallic
Hermae from the Pelasgians, and those who are initiated in the
mysteries of the Cabeiri will understand what I am saying; for the
Pelasgians formerly inhabited Samothrace, and it is from them that
the Samothracians received their orgies. But the Samothracians had
a sacred legend about Hermes, which is explained in their mysteries.
This sacred legend is perhaps no other than the one spoken of by
Cicero (De Nat. Deor. iii. 22), that Hermes was the son of Coelus and
Dies, and that Proserpine desired to embrace him. The same is
perhaps alluded to by Propertius (ii. 2. 11), when he says, that
Mercury (Hermes) had connexions with Brimo, who is probably the
goddess of Pherae worshipped at Athens, Sicyon, and Argos, whom
some identified with Proserpine (Persephone), and others with
Hecate or Artemis. (Spanh. ad Callim. hymn. in Dian. 259.) We
generally find this goddess worshipped in places which had the
worship of the Cabeiri, and a Lemnian Artemis is mentioned by
Galen. (De Medic. Simpl. ix. 2. p. 246, ed. Chart.) The Tyrrhenians,
too, are said to have taken away the statue of Artemis at Brauron,
and to have carried it to Lemnos. Aristophanes, in his "Lemnian
Women," had mentioned Bendis along with the Brauronian Artemis
and the great goddess, and Nonnus (Dionys. xxx. 45) states that the
Cabeirus Alcon brandished Hekatês Diasôdea purson, so that we
may draw the conclusion, that the Samothracians and Lemnians
worshipped a goddess akin to Hecate, Artemis, Bendis, or
Persephone, who had some sexual connexion with Hermes, which



revelation was made in the mysteries of Samothrace.
The writer next to Herodotus, who speaks about the Cabeiri, and
whose statements we possess in Strabo (p. 472), though brief and
obscure, is Stesimbrotus. The meaning of the passage in Strabo is,
according to Lobeck, as follows: Some persons think that the
Corybantes are the sons of Cronos, others that they are the sons of
Zeus and Calliope, that they (the Corybantes) went to Samothrace
and were the same as the beings who were there called Cabeiri. But
as the doings of the Corybantes are generally known, whereas
nothing is known of the Samothracian Corybantes, those persons
are obliged to have recourse to saying, that the doings of the latter
Corybantes are kept secret or are mystic. This opinion, however, is
contested by Demetrius, who states, that nothing was revealed in
the mysteries either of the deeds of the Cabeiri or of their having
accompanied Rhea or of their having brought up Zeus and Dionysus.
Demetrius also mentions the opinion of Stesimbrotus, that the hiera
were performed in Samothrace to the Cabeiri, who derived their
name from mount Cabeirus in Berecyntia. But here again opinions
differed very much, for while some believed that the hiera Kabeirôn
were thus called from their having been instituted and conducted by
the Cabeiri, others thought that they were celebrated ill honour of
the Cabeiri, and that the Cabeiri belonged to the great gods.
The Attic writers of this period offer nothing of importance
concerning the Cabeiri, but they intimate that their mysteries were
particularly calculated to protect the lives of the initiated. (Aristoph.
Pax, 298; comp. Etymol. Gud. p. 289.) Later writers in making the
same remark do not mention the name Cabeiri, but speak of the
Samothracian gods generally. (Diod. iv. 43, 49; Aelian, Fragm. p. 320;
Callim. Ep. 36; Lucian. Ep. 15; Plut. Marcell. 30.) There are several
instances mentioned of lovers swearing by the Cabeiri in promising
fidelity to one another (Juv. iii. 144; Himerius, Orat. i. 12); and Suidas
(s. v. Dialamdanei) mentions a case of a girl invoking the Cabeiri as



her avengers against a lover who had broken his oath. But from
these oaths we can no more draw any inference as to the real
character of the Cabeiri, than from the fact of their protecting the
lives of the initiated; for these are features which they have in
common with various other divinities. From the account which the
scholiast of Apollonius Rhodius (i. 913) has borrowed from Athenion,
who had written a comedy called The Samothracians (Athen. xiv. p.
661), we learn only that he spoke of two Cabeiri, Dardanus, and
Jasion, whom he called sons of Zeus and Electra. They derived their
name from mount Cabeirus in Phrygia, from whence they had been
introduced into Samothrace.
A more ample source of information respecting the Cabeiri is opened
to us in the writers of the Alexandrine period. The two scholia on
Apollonius Rhodius (l. c.) contain in substance the following
statement: Mnaseas mentions the names of three Cabeiri in
Samothrace, viz. Axieros, Axiocersa, and Axiocersus; the first is
Demeter, the second Persephone, and the third Hades. Others add a
fourth, Cadmilus, who according to Dionysodorus is identical with
Hermes. It thus appears these accounts agreed with that of
Stesimbrotus, who reckoned the Cabeiri among the great gods, and
that Mnaseas only added their names. Herodotus, as we have seen,
had already connected Hermes with Persephone; the worship of the
latter as connected with that of Demeter in Samothrace is attested
by Artemidorus (ap. Strab. iv. p. 198); and there was also a port in
Samothrace which derived its name, Demetrium, from Demeter. (Liv.
xlv. 6.) According to the authors used by Dionysius (i. 68), the
worship of Samothrace was introduced there from Arcadia; for
according to them Dardanus, together with his brother Jasion or
Jasus and his sister Harmonia, left Arcadia and went to Samothrace,
taking with them the Palladium from the temple of Pallas. Cadmus,
however, who appears in this tradition, is king of Samothrace: he
made Dardanus his friend, and sent him to Teucer in Troas.



Dardanus himself, again, is sometimes described as a Cretan (Serv.
ad Aen. iii. 167), sometimes as an Asiatic (Steph. s. v. Dardanos;
Eustath. ad Dionys. Perieg. 391), while Arrian (ap. Eustath. p. 351)
makes him come originally from Samothrace. Respecting Dardanus'
brother Jasion or Jasus, the accounts likewise differ very much; for
while some writers describe him as going to Samothrace either from
Parrhasia in Arcadia or from Crete, a third account (Dionys. i. 61)
stated, that he was killed by lightning for having entertained
improper desires for Demeter; and Arrian (l. c.) says that Jasion,
being inspired by Demeter and Cora, went to Sicily and many other
places, and there established the mysteries of these goddesses, for
which Demeter rewarded him by yielding to his embraces, and
became the mother of Parius, the founder of Paros.
All writers of this class appear to consider Dardanus as the founder
of the Samothracian mysteries, and the mysteries themselves as
solemnized in honour of Demeter. Another set of authorities, on the
other hand, regards them as belonging to Rhea (Diod. v. 51; Schol.
ad Aristid. p. 106; Strab. Esccrpt. lib. vii. p. 511, ed. Almelov.; Lucian,
Dc Dea Syr. 97), and suggests the identity of the Samothracian and
Phrygian mysteries. Pherecydes too, who placed the Corybantes, the
companions of the great mother of the gods, in Samothrace, and
Stesimbrotus who derived the Cabeiri from mount Cabeirus in
Phrygia, and all those writers who describe Dardanus as the founder
of the Samothracian mysteries, naturally ascribed the Samothracian
mysteries to Rhea. To Demeter, on the other hand, they were
ascribed by Mnaseas, Artemidorus, and even by Herodotus, since he
mentions Hermes and Persephone in connexion with these
mysteries, and Persephone has nothing to do with Rhea. Now, as
Demeter and Rhea have many attributes in common--both are
megaloi Deoi, and the festivals of each were celebrated with the
same kind of enthusiasm; and as peculiar features of the one are
occasionally transferred to the other (e. g. Eurip. Helen. 1304), it is



not difficult to see how it might happen, that the Samothracian
goddess was sometimes called Demeter and sometimes Rhea. The
difficulty is, however, increased by the fact of Venus (Aphrodite) too
being worshipped in Samothrace. (Plin. H. N. v. 6.) This Venus may
be either the Thracian Bendis or Cybele, or may have been one of
the Cabeiri themselves, for we know that Thebes possessed three
ancient statues of Aphrodite, which Harmonia had taken from the
ships of Cadmus, and which may have been the Pataaïkoi who
resembled the Cabeiri. (Paus. ix. 16. § 2; Herod. iii. 37.) In connexion
with this Aphrodite we may mention that, according to some
accounts, the Phoenician Aphrodite (Astarte) had commonly the
epithet chabar or chabor, an Arabic word which signifies "the great,"
and that Lobeck considers Astarte as identical with the Selênê
Kabeiria, which name P. Ligorius saw on a gem.
There are also writers who transfer all that is said about the
Samothracian gods to the Dioscuri, who were indeed different from
the Cabeiri of Acusilaus, Pherecydes, and Aeschylus, but yet might
easily be confounded with them; first, because the Dioscuri are also
called great gods, and secondly, because they were also regarded as
the protectors of persons in danger either by land or water. Hence
we find that in some places where the anakes were worshipped, it
was uncertain whether they were the Dioscuri or the Cabeiri. (Paus.
x. 38. § 3.) Nay, even the Roman Penates were sometimes
considered as identical with the Dioscuri and Cabeiri (Dionys. i. 67,
&c.); and Varro thought that the Penates were carried by Dardanus
from the Arcadian town Pheneos to Samothrace, and that Aeneas
brought them from thence to Italy. (Macrob. Sat. iii. 4; Serv. ad Aen. i.
378, iii. 148.) But the authorities for this opinion are all of a late
period. According to one set of accounts, the Samothracian gods
were two male divinities of the same age, which applies to Zeus and
Dionysus, or Dardanus and Jasion, but not to Demeter, Rhea, or
Persephone. When people, in the course of time, had become



accustomed to regard the Penates and Cabeiri as identical, and yet
did not know exactly the name of each separate divinity comprised
under those common names, some divinities are mentioned among
the Penates who belonged to the Cabeiri, and vice versâ. Thus
Servius (ad Aen. viii. 619) represents Zeus, Pallas, and Hermes as
introduced from Samothrace; and, in another passage (ad Aen. iii.
264), he says that, according to the Samothracians, these three
were the great gods, of whom Hermes, and perhaps Zeus also,
might be reckoned among the Cabeiri. Varro (de Ling. Lat. v. 58, ed.
Muller) says, that Heaven and Earth were the great Samothracian
gods; while in another place (ap. August. De Civ. Dei, vii. 18) he
stated, that there were three Samothracian gods, Jupiter or Heaven,
Juno or Earth, and Minerva or the prototype of things,--the ideas of
Plato. This is, of course, only the view Varro himself took, and not a
tradition.
If we now look back upon the various statements we have gathered,
for the purpose of arriving at some definite conclusion, it is manifest,
that the earliest writers regard the Cabeiri as descended from
inferior divinities, Proteus and Hephaestus: they have their seats on
earth, in Samothrace, Lemnos, and Imbros. Those early writers
cannot possibly have conceived them to be Demeter, Persephone or
Rhea. It is true those early authorities are not numerous in
comparison with the later ones; but Demetrius, who wrote on the
subject, may have had more and very good ones, since it is with
reference to him that Strabo repeats the assertion, that the Cabeiri,
like the Corybantes and Curetes, were only ministers of the great
gods. We may therefore suppose, that the Samothracian Cabeiri
were originally such inferior beings; and as the notion of the Cabeiri
was from the first not fixed and distinct, it became less so in later
times; and as the ideas of mystery and Demeter came to be looked
upon as inseparable, it cannot occasion surprise that the mysteries,
which were next in importance to those of Eleusis, the most



celebrated in antiquity, were at length completely transferred to this
goddess. The opinion that the Samothracian gods were the same as
the Roman Penates, seems to have arisen with those writers who
endeavoured to trace every ancient Roman institution to Troy, and
thence to Samothrace.
The places where the worship of the Cabeiri occurs, are chiefly
Samothrace, Lemnos, and Imbros. Some writers have maintained,
that the Samothracian and Lemnian Cabeiri were distinct; but the
contrary is asserted by Strabo (x. p. 466). Besides the Cabeiri of
these three islands, we read of Boeotian Cabeiri. Near the Neïtian
gate of Thebes there was a grove of Demeter Cabeiria and Cora,
which none but the initiated were allowed to enter; and at a distance
of seven stadia from it there was a sanctuary of the Cabeiri. (Paus. ix.
25. § 5.) Here mysteries were celebrated, and the sanctity of the
temple was great as late as the time of Pausanias. (Comp. iv. 1. § 5.)
The account of Pausanias about the origin of the Boeotian Cabeiri
savours of rationalism, and is, as Lobeck justly remarks, a mere
fiction. It must further not be supposed that there existed any
connexion between the Samothracian Cadmilus or Cadmus and the
Theban Cadmus; for tradition clearly describes them as beings of
different origin, race and dignity. Pausanias (ix. 22. § 5) further
mentions another sanctuary of the Cabeiri, with a grove, in the
Boeotian town of Anthedon; and a Boeotian Cabeirus, who
possessed the power of averting dangers and increasing man's
prosperity, is mentioned in an epigram of Diodorus. (Brunck, Anal. ii.
p. 185.) A Macedonian Cabeirus occurs in Lactantius. (i. 15, 8; comp.
Firmicus, de Error. Prof. p. 23; Clem. Alex. Protrept. p. 16.) The
reverence paid by the Macedonians to the Cabeiri may be inferred
from the fact of Philip and Olympias being initiated in the
Samothracian mysteries, and of Alexander erecting altars to the
Cabeiri at the close of his Eastern expedition. (Plut. Alex. 2; Philostr.
de Vit. Apollon. ii. 43.) The Pergamenian Cabeiri are mentioned by

NAMES OF THE CABEIRI
CLASSICAL LITERATURE QUOTES
Aeschylus, Cabiri (lost play) (Greek tragedy C5th
B.C.) :
This drama [i.e. the play Cabiri], named for its
Chorus, represents the earliest known
appearance of these gods in Greek literature.
Weir Smyth (L.C.L. volume) summarises evidence
of the play: "Athenaeus, Deipnosophists 10. 33.
428F, declares that it was Aeschylus who first
introduced drunken people to the sight of the
spectators of ‘tragedyʼ; and that this evil
eminence was displayed in his Cabiri, in which
play he represented Jason and his companions
as drunk. Fragment 49 would seem to refer to
the hospitable reception of the Argonauts by the
Cabiri, who furnished them with an abundance of
wine upon their landing at Lemnos, the first
stopping-place of the Argo on its eastward
voyage. The introduction of a drunken orgy has

caused many scholars to regard the play as
satyric rather than tragic. Whether pure tragedy
may thus relax its gravity is a question that has
been raised also in connexion with the Ostologoi
of Aeschylus and the Sundeipnoi of Sophocles. The Scholiast on
Pindar, Pythian 4. 303, states that the names of the heroes of the
Argonautic expedition were set forth in the Kabeiroi."
Aeschylus, Fragment 49 Cabiri (from Plutarch, Table Talk 2. 1. 7.
632F) (trans. Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :
"[The Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) address the Argonauts :] ‘We shall make the
house to be scant of vinegar.ʼ" [I.e. the gods jest that they will
exhaust all the wine in their drinking and be forced to resort to
vinegar.]"
Herodotus, Histories 2. 51. 1 ff (trans. Godley) (Greek historian C5th
B.C.) :
"The ithyphallic (erect phallus) images of Hermes [the Hermai]; the
production of these came from the Pelasgians [of Thessalia
(Thessaly)], from whom the Athenians were the first Greeks to take
it, and then handed it on to others . . . Whoever has been initiated
into the rites of the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri), which the Samothrakians
learned from the Pelasgians and now practice, understands what my
meaning is. Samothrake (Samothrace) was formerly inhabited by
those Pelasgians who came to live among the Athenians, and it is
from them that the Samothrakians take their rites. The Athenians,
then, were the first Greeks to make ithyphallic images of Hermes,
and they did this because the Pelasgians taught them. The
Pelasgians told a certain sacred tale about this, which is set forth in
the Samothrakian Mysteries."
[Cf. Clement Exhortations below for the "mystery" of the Kabeiroi
and the sacred phallus.]



Herodotus, Histories 3. 72. 1 (trans. Godley) (Greek historian C5th
B.C.) :
"Thus too [the Persian invader Kambyses (Cambyses)] he entered
the temple of Hephaistos (Hephaestus) [i.e. the Egyptian god Ptah]
and jeered at the image there . . . I will describe it for anyone who has
not seen these figures: it is the likeness of a dwarf. Also he entered
the temple of the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) [i.e. Egyptian gods idenitified
with the Kabeiroi], into which no one may enter save the priest; the
images here he even burnt, with bitter mockery. These also are like
the images of Hephaistos [Ptah], and are said to be his sons."
N.B. The Greeks identified the Kabeiroi with certain dwarfish sons of
the Egyptian god Ptah. Presumably these were the divinities who
recovered the phallus of Osiris after he had been slain and
dismembered by Set. The Kabeiroi played the same role in the myth
of Zagreus--recovering the god's virilia after he had been torn apart
by the Titanes.
Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 1. 916 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic
C3rd B.C.) :
"They [the Argonauts] beached this ship at Samothrake
(Samothrace) . . . He [Orpheus] wished them, by holy initiation, to
learn something of the secret rites, and so sail on with greater
confidence across the formidable sea. Of the rites I say no more,
pausing only to salute the isle itself and the Powers [the Kabeiroi
(Cabeiri)] that dwell in it, to whom belong the mysteries of which we
must not sing."
Callimachus, Aetia Fragment 115 (trans. Trypanis) (Greek poet C3rd
B.C.) :
"And they [the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri)] grew up secretly by the furnaces of
Hephaistos (Hephaestus) [on Lemnos], learning the art of the
hammer . . ((lacuna)) Onnes now . . ((lacuna)) iron shields which they
themselves forged on the anvils of Hephaistos."



Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 43. 1 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek
historian C1st B.C.) :
"There came on a great storm [in the north Aegean] and the
chieftains [the Argonauts] had given up hope of being saved, when
Orpheus, they say, who was the only one on ship-board who had
ever been initiated in the Mysteries of the deities of Samothrake
(Samothrace) [i.e. the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri)], offered to these deities
prayers for their salvation. And immediately the wind died down and
two stars fell over the heads of the Dioskouroi (Dioscuri), and the
whole company was amazed at the marvel which had taken place
and concluded that they had been rescued from their perils by an
act of providence of the gods. For this reason, the story of this
reversal of fortune for the Argonauts has been handed down to
succeeding generations, and sailors when caught in storms always
direct their prayers to the deities of Samothrake and attribute the
appearance of the two stars to the epiphany of the Dioskouroi."
Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 48. 6 :
"[The Argonauts] had already reached the middle of the Pontic Sea
when the ran into a storm which put them in the greatest peril. But
when Orpheus . . . offered up prayers to the deities of Samothrake
[i.e. the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri)], the winds ceased and there appeared
near the ship Glaukos (Glaucus) the Sea-God, as he is called . . . and
he counselled them, accordingly, that so soon as they touched their
lands they should pray their vows to the gods [the Kabeiroi] through
the intervention of whom they had twice already been saved."
Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 49. 8 :
"The Argonauts, they say, set forth from the Troad and arrived at
Samothrake, where they again paid their vows to the great gods [the
Kabeiroi (Cabeiri)] and dedicated in the sacred precinct the bowls
which are preserved there even to this day."



Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 48. 2 - 6 :
"Zeus desired that the other of his two sons [Iasion of Samothrake
(Samothrace), brother of Dardanos] might also attain honour, and so
he instructed him in the initiatory rites of the Mysteries [of the
Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) of Samothrake], which had existed on the island
since ancient times but was at that time, so to speak, put in his
hands; it is not lawful, however, for any but the initiated to hear about
the Mysteries. And Iasion is reputed to have been the first to initiate
strangers into them and by this means to bring the initiatory rite to
high esteem.
After this Kadmos (Cadmus), the son of Agenor, came in the course
of his quest for Europe (Europa) [his sister abducted by Zeus] to the
Samothrakians, and after participating in the initiation [into the
mysteries of Samothrake] he married Harmonia, who was the sister
of Iasion and not, as the Greeks recount in their mythologies, the
daughter of Ares . . .
Now the details of the initiatory rite [of the Mysteries] are guarded
among the matters not to be divulged and are communicated to the
initiates alone; but the fame has travelled wide of how these gods
[the Kabeiroi] appear to mankind and bring unexpected aid to those
initiates of their who call upon them in the midst of perils. The claim
is also made that men who have taken part in the mysteries become
both more pious and more just and better in every respect than they
were before. And this is the reason, we are told, why the most
famous both of the ancient heroes and of the demi-gods were
eagerly desirous to taking part in the initiatory rite; and in fact Jason
and the Dioskouroi (Dioscuri), and Herakles (Heracles) and Orpheus
as well, after their initiation attained success in all the campaigns
they undertook, because these gods appeared to them."
Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 64. 3 :
"But some historians, and Ephoros is one of them, record that the



Daktyloi Idaioi (Idaean Dactys) [here meaning the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri)
or Korybantes (Corybantes)] were in fact born on the Mt Ida which is
in Phrygia and passed over to Europe together with Mygdon; and
since they were wizards (gonta), they practised charms and initiatory
rites and mysteries, and in the course of a sojourn in Samothrake
(Samothrace) they [as Kabeiroi or Korybantes] amazed the natives of
that island not a little by their skill in such matters. And it was at this
time, we are further told, that Orpheus, who was endowed with an
exceptional gift of poesy and song, also became a pupil of theirs,
and he was subsequently the first to introduce initiatory rites and
mysteries to the Greeks."
Strabo, Geography 7 Fragment 47 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer
C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.) :
"Iasion and Dardanos (Dardanus), two brothers, used to live in
Samothrake (Samothrace). But when Iasion was struck by a
thunderbolt because of his sin against Demeter, Dardanos sailed
away from Samothrake, went and took up his abode at the foot of
Mount Ida, calling the city Dardania, and taught the Trojans the
Samothrakian Mysteries."
Strabo, Geography 7 Fragment 50 :
"Many writers have identified the gods that are worshipped in
Samothrake with the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri), though they cannot say who
the Kabeiroi themselves are, just as the Kyrbantes and Korybantes
(Corybantes), and likewise the Kouretes (Curetes) and the Daktyloi
Idaioi (Idaean Dactyls), are identified with them."
Strabo, Geography 10. 3. 7 - 9 :
"Some represent the Korybantes (Corybantes), the Kabeiroi
(Cabeiri), the Daktyloi Idaioi (Idaean Dactyls), and the Telkhines
(Telchines) as identical with the Kouretes (Curetes), others represent
them as all kinsmen of one another and differentiate only certain



small matters in which they differ in respect to one another; but,
roughly speaking and in general, they represent them, one and all, as
a kind of inspired people and as subject to Bacchic frenzy, and, in
the guise of ministers, as inspiring terror at the celebration of the
sacred rites by means of war-dances, accompanied by uproar and
noise and cymbals and drums and arms, and also by flute and
outcry; and consequently these rites are in a way regarded as having
a common relationship, I mean these and those of the
Samothrakians [the Kabeiroi] and those in Lemnos and in several
other places, because the divine ministers are called the same.
However, every investigation of this kind pertains to theology, and is
not foreign to the speculation of the philosopher . . .
But I must now investigate how it comes about that so many names
have been used of one and the same thing [the daimones called
Kouretes, Korybantes and Kabeiroi], and the theological element
contained in their history. Now this is common both to the Greeks
and to the barbarians, to perform their sacred rites in connection
with the relaxation of a festival, these rites being performed
sometimes with religious frenzy, sometimes without it; sometimes
with music, sometimes not; and sometimes in secret, sometimes
openly. And it is in accordance with the dictates of nature that this
should be so, for, in the first place, the relaxation draws the mind
away from human occupations and turns the real mind towards that
which is divine; and, secondly, the religious frenzy seems to afford a
kind of divine inspiration and to be very like that of the soothsayer;
and, thirdly, the secrecy with which the sacred rites are concealed
induces reverence for the divine, since it imitates the nature of the
divine, which is to avoid being perceived by our human senses; and,
fourthly, music, which includes dancing as well as rhythm and
melody, at the same time, by the delight it affords and by its artistic
beauty, brings us in touch with the divine, and this for the following
reason; for although it has been well said that human beings then act



most like the gods when they are doing good to others, yet one
might better say, when they are happy; and such happiness consists
of rejoicing, celebrating festivals, pursuing philosophy, and engaging
in music."
Strabo, Geography 10. 3. 15 :
"They [the poets] also invented some of the names by which to
designate the ministers, choral dancers, and attendants upon the
sacred rites [of Rhea and Dionysos], I mean Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) and
Korybantes (Corybantes) and Panes and Satyroi (Satyrs) and Tityroi."
Strabo, Geography 10. 3. 19 - 21 :
"(1) Others say that the Korybantes (Corybantes) were sons of Zeus
and Kalliope (Calliope) and were identical with the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri),
and that these went off to Samothrake (Samothrace), which in earlier
times was called Melite, and that their rites were mystical.
(2) But though the Skepsian [Demetrius of Scepsis, grammarian
C2nd B.C.], who compiled these myths, does not accept the last
statement, on the ground that no mystic story of the Kabeiroi
(Cabeiri) is told in Samothrake, still he cites also the opinion of
Stesimbrotos the Thasian [writer C5th B.C.] that the sacred rites in
Samothrake were performed in honor of the Kabeiroi: and the
Skepsian says that they were called Kabeiroi after the mountain
Kabeiros (Cabeirus) in Berekyntia (Berecynthia) [in Mysia].
(3) Some, however, believe that the Kouretes (Curetes) were the
same as the Korybantes and were ministers of Hekate (Hecate).
(4) But the Skepsian again states, in opposition to the words of
Euripides, that the rites of Rhea were not sanctioned or in vogue in
Krete, but only in Phrygia and the Troad, and that those who say
otherwise are dealing in myths rather than in history, though perhaps
the identity of the place-names contributed to their making this
mistake. For instance, Ida is not only a Trojan, but also a Kretan
(Cretan), mountain; and Dikte (Dicte) is a place in Skepsia [in the



Troad] and also a mountain in Krete (Crete); and Pytna, after which
the city Hierapytna [in Krete] was named, is a peak of [Trojan] Ida.
And there is a Hippokorona (Hippocorona) in the territory of
Adramyttion [in the Troad] and a Hippokoronion in Krete. And
Samonion is the eastern promontory of the island and a plain in the
territory of Neandria and in that of the Alexandreians.
(5) Akousilaüs (Acusilaus) [mythographer C5th B.C.], the Argive,
calls Kadmilos (Cadmilus) the son of Kabeiro (Cabeiro) and
Hephaistos (Hephaestus), and Kadmilos the father of three Kabeiroi
(Cabeiri), and these the fathers of the Nymphai (Nymphs) called
Kabeirides (Cabeirides).
(6) Pherekydes (Pherecydes) [another mythographer C5th B.C.] says
that nine Kyrbantes (Corybantes) were sprung from Apollon and
Rhetia, and that they took up their abode in Samothrake; and that
three Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) and three Nymphai called Kabeirides were
the children of Kabeiro, the daughter of Proteus, and Hephaistos,
and that sacred rites were instituted in honor of each triad.
(7) Now it has so happened that the Kabeiroi are most honored in
Imbros and Lemnos, but they are also honored in separate cities of
the Troad; their names, however, are kept secret. Herodotos
[historian C5th B.C.] says that there were temples of the Kabeiroi in
Memphis, as also of Hephaistos [i.e. the Egyptian god Ptah and his
sons], but that Kambyses (Cambyses) destroyed them. The places
where these deities were worshipped are uninhabited, both the
Korybanteion in Hamaxitia in the territory now belonging to the
Alexandreians near Sminthion, and Korybissa (Corybissa) in Skepsia
in the neighborhood of the river Eurëeis and of the village which
bears the same name and also of the winter torrent Aethalöeis.'"
Pausanias, Description of Greece 4. 1. 7 (trans. Jones) (Greek
travelogue C2nd A.D.) :
"Methapos (Methapus) was an Athenian by birth, an expert in the



mysteries and founder of all kinds of rites. It was he who established
the Mysteries of the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) at Thebes."
Pausanias, Description of Greece 9. 22. 5 :
"Just about the centre of Anthedon [in Boiotia] is a sanctuary of the
Kabeiroi (Cabeiri), with a grove around it, near which is a temple of
Demeter and her daughter, with images of white marble."
Pausanias, Description of Greece 9. 25. 5 - 26. 1 :
"[In the town of Thebes in Boiotia] you come to a grove of Demeter
Kabeiraia (Cabeiraea) and Kore (Core) [Persephone]. The initiated
are permitted to enter it. The sanctuary of the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) is
some seven stades distant from this grove. I must ask the curious to
forgive me if I keep silence as to who the Kabeiroi are, and what is
the nature of the ritual performed in honour of them and of the Meter
(Mother). But there is nothing to prevent my declaring to all what the
Thebans say was the origin of the ritual. They say that once there
was in this place a city, with inhabitants called Kabeiroi; and that
Demeter came to know Prometheus, one of the Kabeiroi, and
Aitnaios (Aetnaeus) his son, and entrusted something to their
keeping [probably the phallus of the dismembered god Zagreus].
What was entrusted to them, and what happened to it, seemed to
me a sin to put into writing, but at any rate the rites are a gift of
Demeter to the Kabeiroi.
At the time of the invasion of the Epigonoi (Epigoni) and the taking of
Thebes, the Kabeiroi were expelled from their homes by the Argives
and the rites for a while ceased to be performed. But they go on to
say that afterwards Pelarge, the daughter of Potneius, and
Isthmiades her husband established the Mysteries here to begin
with, but transferred them to the place called Alexiaros. But because
Pelarge conducted the initiation outside the ancient borders,
Telondes returned again to Kabeiraia (Cabeiraea). Various honours
were to be established for Pelarge by Telondes in accordance with



an oracle from Dodona, one being the sacrifice of a pregnant victim.
The wrath of the Kabeiroi no man may placate, as has been proved
on many occasions. For certain private people dared to perform in
Naupaktos (Naupactus) the ritual as it was done in Thebes, and soon
afterwards justice overtook them. Then, again, certain men of the
army of Xerxes [the historical Persian general] left behind with
Mardonios in Boiotia entered the sanctuary of the Kabeiroi, perhaps
in the hope of great wealth, but rather, I suspect, to show their
contempt of its gods; all these immediately were struck with
madness, and flung themselves to their deaths into the sea or from
the tops of precipices. Again, when Alexandros [i.e. Alexander the
Great, the historical Macedonian leader] after his victory wasted with
fire all the Thebaid, including Thebes itself, some men from
Makedonia entered the sanctuary of the Kabeiroi, as it was in enemy
territory, and were destroyed by thunder and lightning from heaven.
So sacred this sanctuary has been from the beginning."
Pausanias, Description of Greece 10. 38. 7 :
"The Amphisians [of Lokris (Locris)] also celebrate Mysteries in
honour of the Boy Kings (anaktes paides), as they are called. Their
accounts as to who of the gods the Boy Kings are do not agree;
some say they are the Dioskouroi (Dioscuri), and others, who
pretend to have fuller knowledge, hold them to be the Kabeiroi
(Cabeiri)."
Clement, Exhortation to the Greeks 2. 16 (trans. Butterworth) (Greek
Christian writer C2nd A.D.) :
[The early Christian writer Clement divulges the secret mythos of the
Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) of the Samothrakian (Samothracian) Mysteries :]
"If you would like a vision of the Korybantian Orgies (orgia
Korybanton) also, this is the story. Two of the Korybantes
(Corybantes) [i.e. the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri)] slew a third one, who was
their brother, covered the head of the corpse with a purple cloak,



and then wreathed and buried it, bearing it upon a brazen shield to
the skirts of Olympos (Olympus). Here we see what the Mysteries
(mysteria) are, in one word, murders and burials! The priests of these
Mysteries, whom such as are interested in them call ‘Anaktotelestesʼ
(Presidents of the Princes' rites), add a portent to the dismal tale.
They forbid wild celery, root and all, to be placed on the table, for
they actually believe that wild celery grows out of the blood that
flowed from the murdered brother . . . .
The Korybantes (Corybantes) are also called by the name Kabeiroi,
which proclaims the Rite of the Kabeiroi (teletes Kabeirikes). For this
very pair of fratricides got possession of the chest in which the virilia
of Dionysos [i.e. the phallus of the god Zagreus who was
dismembered by the Titanes] were deposited, and brought it to
Tyrrhenia [i.e. Lemnos], traders in glorious wares! There they
sojourned, being exiles, and communicated their precious teaching
of peity, the virilia and the chest, to Tyrrhenoi (Tyrrhenians) for
purposes of worship. For this reason, not unnaturally some wish to
call Dionysos Attis, because he was mutilated."
Orphic Hymn 31 to the Curetes (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd
B.C. to 2nd A.D.) :
"Hymn to the Kouretes (Curetes). Leaping Kouretes, who with
dancing feet and circling measures armed footsteps beat: shoe
bosoms Bacchanalian furies firer, who move in rhythm to the
sounding lyre: who traces deaf when lightly leaping tread, arm
bearers, strong defenders, rulers dread: famed deities the guards (of
Persephone) preserving rites mysterious and divine: come, and
benevolent this hymn attend, and with glad mind the herdsman's life
defend."
Orphic Hymn 38 to the Curetes :
"To the Kouretes (Curetes) [here the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) of
Samothrake], Fumigation from Frankincense. Brass-beating



Kouretes, ministers of Ares, who wear his arms the instruments of
wars; whose blessed frames, heaven, earth, and sea compose, and
from whose breath all animals arose: who dwell in Samothrake's
sacred ground, defending mortals through the sea profound.
Deathless Kouretes, by your power alone, the greatest mystic rites to
men at first were shown. Who shake old Okeanos (Oceanus)
thundering to the sky, and stubborn oaks with branches waving high.
'Tis yours in glittering arms the earth to beat, with lightly leaping,
rapid, sounding feet; then every beast the noise terrific flies, and the
loud tumult wanders through the skies. The dust your feet excites,
with matchless force flies to the clouds amidst their whirling course;
and every flower of variegated hue grows in the dancing motion
formed by you; immortal Daimones (Spirits), to your powers
consigned, the task to nourish and destroy mankind, when rushing
furious with loud tumult dire, overwhelmed, they perish in your
dreadful ire; and live replenished with the balmy air, the food of life,
committed to your care. When shook by you, the seas with wild
uproar, wide-spreading, and profoundly whirling, roar. The concave
heavens with echo's voice resound, when leaves with rustling noise
bestrew the ground. Kouretes, Korybantes (Corybantes), ruling
kings, whose praise the land of Samothrake sings; great Zeus'
assessors; whose immortal breath sustains the soul, and wafts her
back from death; aerial-formed, who in Olympos shine the heavenly
Twins [Dioskouroi (Dioscuri)] all-lucid and divine; blowing, serene,
from whom abundance springs, nurses of seasons, fruit-producing
kings."
Orphic Hymn 39 to Corybas :
"To Korybas (Corybas), Fumigation from Frankincense. The mighty
ruler of this earthly ball for ever flowing, to these rites I call; martial
and blest, unseen by mortal sight, preventing fears, and pleased with
gloomy night: hence fancy's terrors are by thee allayed, all-various



king, who lovest the desert shade. Each of thy brothers killing, blood
is thine, twofold Kourete (Curete), many-formed, divine. By thee
transmuted, Deo's [Demeter's] body pure became a Drakon's
(Dragon's) savage and obscure: avert they anger, hear me when I
pray, and, by fixed date, drive fancy's fears away."
Aelian, On Animals 15. 23 (trans. Scholfield) (Greek natural history
C2nd A.D.) :
"They say that the pilot-fish is sacred not only to Poseidon but is
also beloved of the gods of Samothrake [the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri)]."
Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica 2. 431 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic
C1st A.D.) :
"[The Argonauts sail towards the isle of Samothrake (Samothrace) :]
Electra's island grows larger, guarding the secret of the Thracian
rites [of the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) and other gods]; for here dwells the
great and terrible god, and here are ordained penalties for an
unguarded tongue. No storm sent by Jove [Zeus] ever dares to beat
with its billows upon this land; of his own will the god makes fierce
his waves, what time he would forbid faithless sailors to touch his
shores. But Thyotes the priest meets the Minyae [Argonauts] and
bids them welcome to the land and to the temples, revealing their
Mysteries to his guests. Thus much, Samothrace, has the poet
proclaimed thee to the nations and the light of day; there stay, and
let us keep our reverence for holy Mysteries. The Minyae, rejoicing in
the new light of the sun and full of their heavenly visions, seat
themselves upon the thwarts [and depart from the island]."
Nonnus, Dionysiaca 3. 61 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :
"Already the bird of morning was cutting the air with loud cries [on
the island of Samothrake]; already the helmeted bands of desert
haunting Korybantes (Corybantes) [or Kabeiroi (Cabeiri)] were
beating on their shields in the Knossian (Cnossian) dance, and



leaping with rhythmic steps, and the oxhides thudded under the
blows of the iron as they whirled them about in rivalry, while the
double pipe made music, and quickened the dancers with its
rollicking tune in time to the bounding steps. Aye, and the trees
whispered, the rocks boomed, the forests held jubilee with their
intelligent movings and shakings, and the Dryades did sing. Packs of
bears joined the dance, skipping and wheeling face to face; lions
with a roar from emulous throats mimicked the triumphant cry of the
priests of the Kabeiroi, sane in their madness; the revelling pipes
rang out a tune to honour of Hekate, divine friend of dogs, those
single pipes, which the horn-polisher's art invented in Kronos'
(Cronus') days.
The noisy Korybantes (Corybantes) with their ringing din awoke
Kadmos (Cadmus) early in the morning; the Sidonian seamen also
with one accord, hearing the never-silent oxhide at dawn, rose from
their rattling pebbly pallets and left the brine-beaten back of the
shore."
Nonnus, Dionysiaca 4. 184 ff :
"Grottoes of the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) and Korybantian cliffs [on the
island of Samothrake]."
Nonnus, Dionysiaca 14. 17 ff :
"[When Rheia summoned the daimones to join the army of Dionysos
for a campaign against the Indians :] First from the firepeak rock of
Lemnos the two Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) in arms answered the stormy call
answered the stormy call beside the mystic torch of Samos
[Samothrake], two sons of Hephaistos (Hephaestus) whom Thrakian
Kabeiro (Cabeiro) had borne to the heavenly smith, Alkon (Alcon) and
Eurymedon well skilled at the forge, who bore their mother's tribal
name."
Nonnus, Dionysiaca 17. 192 ff :



"[During the Indian War of Dionysos :] Orontes [an Indian chief]
dashed hot upon the front ranks, reaping a harvest in both kinds
[men and women]. Not one of all the wide front durst abide the
adverse onset of so mighty a champion--not bold fiery Eurymedon,
not Alkon (Alcon) his kinsman [the two Kabeiroi (Cabeiri)]."
Nonnus, Dionysiaca 24. 77 ff :
"[When the Indian River Hydaspes tried to drown the army of
Dionysos :] Hephaistos (Hephaestus) took care of his sons the
Kabeiroi (Cabeiri), and caught up both, like a flying firebrand."
Nonnus, Dionysiaca 27. 120 ff :
"[The Indian Deriades addresses his troops :] ‘Let Lemnian Kabeiro
(Cabeiro) unveiled lament the death of her two sons; let sooty
Hephaistos (Hephaestus) throw down his tongs, and see the
destroyer of his race sitting in the car of the Kabeiro (Cabeiri)i, see
Deriades driving the bronzefoot horses!ʼ"
Nonnus, Dionysiaca 27. 325 ff :
"[Zeus encourages Hephaistos (Hephaestus) to help Dionysos
during the Indian War :] ‘Do you sit still, Hephaistos, and will not you
save your children? Lift your accustomed torch to defend the
Kabeiroi (Cabeiri); turn your eye and see your ancient bride, your
Kabeiro (Cabeiro), reproaching you in love for her sons.ʼ"
Nonnus, Dionysiaca 29. 193 ff :
"[During Dionysos' war with the Indians :] Two firestrong citizens of
Samothrake [the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri)] also ran wild, sons of Lemnian
Kabeiro (Cabeiro); their eyes flashed out their own natural sparks,
which came from the red smoky flame of their father Hephaistos
(Hephaestus). They rode in a car of adamant; a pair of colts beat the
dust with rattling hooves of brass, and they sent out a dry whinnying
from their throats. These father Hephaistos had made with his



inimitable art, breathing defiant fire between their teeth, like the pair
of brazenfooted bulls which he made for Aietes (Aeetes) the
redoubtable ruler of the Kolkhians (Colchians), with hot collars and
burning pole. Eurymedon [one of the Kabeiroi] drove and guided the
fiery mouths of the ironfoot steeds with a fiery bridle; in his right
hand he held a Lemnian spear made on his father's anvil, and by his
wellmade thigh hung a flashing sword--if a man picked up a small
stone in his fingertips and struck it against the fire-grained surface
of the sharp blade, sparks flashed of themselves from the steel.
Alkon (Alcon) grasped a fiery bolt in one hand, and swung about a
festal torch of Hekate (Hecate) from his own country."
Nonnus, Dionsyiaca 30. 42 ff :
"[During the Indian War of Dionysos :] The prodigious [Indian chief]
Morrheus attacked the warriors of Bromios [Dionysos]. He wounded
[the Kabeiros (Cabeirus)] Eurymedon, cut through the groin with his
blood-stained spear: the mad point ran through the thigh and tore
the skin from the fat of the flesh; collapsing he fell on his knee to the
ground. Mailclad Alkon (Alcon) [the other Kabeiros] did not neglect
his brother's fall; but lifting spear and round buckler he made for the
fallen man, and covered the warrior well, holding the shield tower
like over his body, and thrusting right and left his unresting spear,
brother protecting brother against the foe. He stradled across the
wounded man, as a lion over his cubs, shouting loud and letting out
mad Korybantic cries from his lips. When Morrheus saw him moving
with neat steps about his brother, defending the fallen Kabeiros, the
monster went raging like Typhon and attacked both brothers, that
Kabeiro (Cabeiro) might shed her tears for two dead sons, slain in
one day with one spear. And now he would have dealt equal
destruction to both, but Eurymedon called upon his Lemnian father
[Hephaistos (Hephaestus)] with voice that gasped and strained from
his mouth : ‘O Father, firebreathing lord of our laborious art! Grant



me the boon once earned, when Deo [Demeter] of the threshing
floor alone seized threecliff Sikelia (Sicily), as sightingprize for
Persephoneia hidden there, and knocked over your windblown
bellows in the west and your wide forge and gripping tongs: but I
defended my father and scared her off, protecting your anvil. You
owe it to me that the air is black and hot with your Sikelian sparks!
Then save your son I pray, whom savage Morrheus has wounded!ʼ
At these words fiery Hephaistos leapt down from heaven, and sent a
flame leaping and fluttering with many tongues about his son,
whirling in his hand a shoot of fire. About Morrheus' neck the flame
crawled and curled itself as if it knew what it was doing, and rolled
round his throat a necklace of fireblazing constraint; the blazing
throat once encircled, it rand down with a springing movement to the
end of his toes, and wove a plait of fiery threads over the warrior's
foot, and there firmly fixt the earth scattered its dancing spars--the
helmet caught fire and his head was hot enough! And now he would
have fallen flat, struck with the fiery shot, had not Deriades' [river
god] father Hydaspes come to the rescue. For he sat watching the
battle high on a rock, his full-form having a false guise of human
shape. He poured a quenching stream and saved the man's life,
cooling the hot blast from the firebeaten face, brushing off the ashes
and dirt from the helmet. Then he caught up Morrheus wrapt in a
darksome cloud, covered and hid his limbs in a livid mist; that the
firebearing Crookshank [Hephaistos] might not destroy him with his
blazing shower of deadly Lemnian flame; that old Hydaspes, the
tender-hearted father, might not see another goodson of Deriades
perish after the first, and lament the death of Morrheus along with
Orontes. But firebearing Hephaistos drove away all the warriors who
stood round the just-wounded boy. Then lifting his son on his
shoulder he took him out of the fray and rested him against an
oaktree hard by; he spread simples upon the wounded groin, and
saved him alive his after his collapse."



Nonnus, Dionysiaca 30. 135 ff :
"[During the Indian War of Dionsysos :] Madly he [the Indian
Tektaphos] pursued the army of Lyaios (Lyaeus) [Dionysos] and
[slew several Satyroi (Satyrs)] . . . and indeed he would have killed a
crowd of Bakkhai (Bacchae) besides; but quickfoot Eurymedon [one
of the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri)] saw him and rushed up, shaking his
Korybantian (Corybantian) twibill against him. He smashed his
forehead and clove his head."
Nonnus, Dionysiaca 43. 307 ff :
"[A Bassarid] whose home was in the Samothrakian cavern of the
Kabeiroi (Cabeiri), skipt about the peaks of Lebanon crooning the
barbarous notes of Korybantian tune."
Suidas s.v. Zerynthia (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek lexicon
C10th A.D.) :
"Zerinthian cave, where they used to sacrifice dogs. There the
mysteries of the Korybantes (Corybantes) [i.e. the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri)]
and of Hekate (Hecate) took place."
Suidas s.v. All' ei tis humôn en Samothraikei memuemenos esti :
"All' ei tis humôn en Samothraikei memuemenos esti (But if there is
someone among you initiated in Samothrake (Samothrace), now is a
fine time to pray that both feet of the pursuer be put out of joint): In
Samothrake there were certain initiation-rites, which they supposed
efficacious as a charm against certain dangers. In that place were
also the mysteries of the Korybantes (Corybantes) [i.e. the Kabeiroi
(Cabeiri)] and those of Hekate (Hecate) and the Zerinthian cave,
where they sacrificed dogs. The initiates supposed that these things
save [them] from terrors and from storms. The bone-socket of the
pursuer to be ‘be put out of jointʼ means to ‘be distorted and
dislocated.ʼ The way forward becomes an obstacle to him, so that he
can no longer turn back."
