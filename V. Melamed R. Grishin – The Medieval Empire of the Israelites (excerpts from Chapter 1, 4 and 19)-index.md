Preface
In William Shakespeare's tragedy, "Othello," there is one riddle: what religion does Othello profess? Desdemona says directly: By heaven, you do me wrong. as I am a Christian! But here the frank and honest Othello is hiding something. It is considered that he, a black-skinned Moor, is a Moslem or at least descendent of Moslems. And if one is to follow the traditional history, then there really is no other variant. Othello, before he ends his life in suicide, recalls: . . . And say besides, that inAleppoonce, Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk Beat a Venetian and traduced the state, I took by the throat the circumcised dog, And smote him, thus. (Stabs himself) That is, according to contemporary ideas, Islam already was in the world, since some kind of "circumcised dog" in a turban fought with the Venetian in Aleppo. Meanwhile, still rather recently (in historical measurements) the military personnel of many countries have worn the turban. And circumcision, as it will be shown in our book, is a most complex phenomenon, which is characteristic at a definite stage for all of human culture. Thus it is impossible to understand who Othello is regarding faith, and it is not clear why he calls the Turk a dog. But it is not worth accusing Shakespeare of a mistake. Not only he, but also the English in general up to
the 17th century did not mention anywhere in written sources the words: "Moslem, Islam, Koran, minaret, muezzin, hijra, Caaba." The full impression is that they did not know them. But you know, the sons of an obscure Albion already had visited all the corners of the world and should have known them. No, these words clearly were unknown to William
Shakespeare as well as to both Francis Bacon and other great Englishmen of that era. They are unknown also to the Italian writer Giraldi Cinthio, upon whose novella the "Moor of Venice" (the "Hecatommithi" collection or "One Hundred Tales." 1566) Shakespeare created his masterpiece. So, perhaps, there still was not an Islam? The riddle of Othello grows into one of the cardinal questions connected with medieval times, when modern nations, states and religions were being born. Our book is devoted to this era. Scientific facts are collected in it that prove that now the predominant historical science is Utopian. It was built on false premises and an artificially constructed chronology. There is a multitude of evidence of the fact that all "ancient" manuscripts are literary

works of the 15th - 16th centuries and that there never was in reality any "ancient" Rome and Greece as historical science teaches us. We have collected the conclusions of dozens of scientists from various countries that the most ancient monuments of mankind, the pyramids of
Egypt, were erected in the period between the 11 and 18th centuries of our era.
The processing of written sources on a computer, with a comparative analysis of their authenticity, and the other newest methods of the study of history, which were found by the scientists, allows the contention that: in the
13 - 14th centuries of our era, the first world war in history broke out. It ended with the formation of a colossal empire with a capital in Istanbul, which at that time was called Jerusalem. Its territory included a large part of Europe, Asia, all of the civilized regions of Africa and Japan. There is basis to say that the Aztec civilization also was included in the Empire's composition. Its subjects named their country Israel Israel History : Empire of Jews and practiced a religion which approximately is set forth in the Old Testament. They named their faith catholic. Having existed for 70-80 years, the empire broke up. The violent creation of states began and the formation of peoples and nations in the modern meaning of these words. An objective political need arose for the writing of one's own history, in comparison with a history common and characteristic for an empire. It was necessary to find or to create the proper historical roots, one's own antiquity, which was not the same as the antiquity of the neighbors. In which connection, the more deeply these roots went into the centuries, the more legitimate those or the other rulers looked in the eyes of the subjects. It was as if their authority was sanctified by the centuries. And then the primary framework of modern historiography was invented. A hunt was launched for manuscripts which were declared as ancient. The main body of sources on the history of antiquity appeared over only 2 centuries - the 15th and 16th. How this happened is well known not only to critics of traditional historiography, but also to the traditionalists themselves. The ancient manuscripts appeared according to a scheme which is well seen in the example of one of the brightest forgers of that time, Poggio Bracciolini. He, an author of historical and moralistic books, was in the full sense of the word the dominant influence of his century. Many found it possible to define the first half of the Italian 15th Century as Poggio's century. Florenceraised a statue to him, which was carved by the sculpture Donatello. With the cooperation of the Florentine scholar and book collector Niccolo Niccoli, Poggio Bracciolini established a kind of permanent study of ancient literature and attracted a whole series of collaborators and partners to the business. Poggio Bracciolini and Bartolomeo di Montepulciano made the first of their "finds" in the era of the Council of Constance. In a forgotten, damp tower of the St. Gall monastery, in which a prisoner would not survive even three days, they chanced "to find" safe and sound a heap of ancient manuscripts: essays by Quintilian, Valerius Flaccus, Asconius Pedianus, Nonius Marcellus, Probus and others. After some time, Bracciolini supposedly discovered fragments "from Petronius" and "the Bucolics" of Calpurnius. Poggio's clients were the Medici, the aristocratic families of England, the House of the Dukes of Burgundy, Cardinal Orsini, Colonus, the wealthy such as Bartholomeo de Bardis, and universities. He became very rich on "ancient" manuscripts. One would think it was impossible to forge archaeological finds. But one can find just that which is needed and there where it is needed. The excavations of Herculaneum began in 1711, and in 1748, the excavations at Pompeii. They bore an advertising and commercial nature. There was no discussion of any scientific research. The first excavations in Athens were made by the English "Society of Amateurs" in 1743-1751. It

was as it was called - a society of amateurs, and it is not suitable to speak about the scientific level of the excavations. But even this is not the main thing. The archaeological expeditions which followed purposefully destroyed all the discoveries that contradicted the established views on history. In the best case, they declared them as erroneous. Sculptors also created a supposedly ancient history. The facts are well known when some of them buried statues of their own creation in the ground and several years later informed the world about the fact that they found in their own vegetable gardens the imperishable works of the ancient masters . The history of Russia and China is full of distortions and fictions. For political and many other reasons, legends were constructed of the Tatar Mongolian yoke in Russia and the centuries old struggle with the Huns in China. Both that and the other are simply untrue. And so, we shall try to explain in the pages of this book what it was in fact and why the Great Wall was built in China in the 15th and 16th centuries. The high-minded direction of traditional European history was developed in the 16th-17th centuries, in the era of the Reformation and the Counter-reformation. The slogan of Nicolo Machiavelli, "The end justifies the means" and the appeal of Martin Luther, "He who is not with us is against us" became the main principles of the greatest historians of that time. The originator of the modern chronology, Joseph Scaliger (Bordone), brought up by his philosopher father in the spirit of "paper will endure all, provided that it is beautiful," Henry IV Bourbon's court chronicler, was right after his master first a Catholic, then a Huguenot. He composed a "continuous" chronology of the French royal dynasties, in order to legitimatize and perpetuate the rights of the Bourbons, who had destroyed the previous Valois dynasty. All the rest of world history was called up only to serve as a background for this purpose. The Austrian Cuspinian (Johann Spiesheimer) carried out the same work for the Hapsburgs, deriving their uninterrupted genealogy from Julius Caesar. The history of Great Britain in the editions of the father and son lords-chancellor Bacon became the most "pseudo-scientific," which were provided moreover with brilliant "PR" in the form of Shakespeare's narrative plays. The peaceful unification of England and Scotland under the crown of the new Scottish dynasty of the Stuarts predetermined also an "uninterrupted legitimate" history of the dynastic replacement of Scottish rulers over 1,200 years. The Roman Catholic Church, which was alarmed by the preservation of its political influence, took in the process of the creation of a pseudo-scientific "worldwide secular" history the most active participation, in particular, in the person of the Jesuit monk, Dionysius Petavius. The adoption itself in Europe of a modern chronology by a decision of the 1563 Council of Trent became an important turning point - only in this year was it declared that it was coming up on namely 1,563 years since the birth of Christ, and all sources which contradicted this were ordered to be burnt. At the same time, the "Book of Popes" also appeared which recorded somehow the uninterrupted succession of the Roman Popes from the 4th through the 9th centuries (to Pope Nicholas I.) Even business created a modern historical tradition. From the middle of the 15th century, by the efforts most of all of the Florentine Medici bankers, history became the object of an extremely profitable business - starting from "holy relics" and ending with "ancient manuscripts." The most glaring example is the "Donation of Constantine," the forgery of which Lorenzo Valla proved right in the middle of the 15th century. At this time an important event in civilization occurs - the appearance of printing, which stimulates the unsatisfied market demand for books. Well, and there where demand is, there also are supplies. An abundance of just discovered "ancient" manuscripts and chronicles becomes the most widespread. . As a rule, they stop suddenly "somewhere in antiquity." A typical example is the chronicle of the Saxon Grammatica, which breaks off in 1185 and is discovered in 1514. This chronicle also was fixed into the foundation of the

history of the Scandinavian countries. A certain Gall Anonim wrote a
similar "ancient Polish" chronicle that ranges to 1113, and it was discovered in that very same 16th century. During the 16th and 17th centuries, their own chronicler appeared in
every European monarchy. "History is necessary to the prince of such that it allows him to most effectively rule his people," thus the founder of political science, Niccolo Machiavelli formulated a thesis which defines even today the relationship of authority to history. Up to now, very rarely is the research of history free from political sympathies and antipathies and the wish that it not begin to play up in a positive sense the role and significance of the people among whom the researchers count themselves. Thus, the brilliant Russian mathematician and revisionist historian, Anatoly Fomenko, attaches all development of civilization to Slavic roots, and the Turkic writer M. Agaji - to Turkic. The Western historians Otto Rahn, Guido von List and many others have gone along the very same path. Book authors suppose such an approach is in error. They stand in that position, that still very recently, several centuries ago, people did not consider themselves either Turks or Russian, or Jews or French, nothing again in the present meaning of these definitions. There existed a period when they were not divided in creed, inasmuch as being the subjects of one empire, they professed one and the same religion - monotheism. Protojudiasm became a starting position for the creation of worldwide religions - of the main driving force in mankind's spiritual life for the centuries ahead. And this book, relying on the evidence of the past and those reconstructions which the critics of traditional historiography suggest today, speak of the empire and its ideology.

The idea of "empire" (Latin imperium is authority) in modern historical science denotes the name of huge monarchist states of various epochs, which unified various ethnic societies. It is correlated with Persia and Rome, Byzantium and Russia, Britain and Spain, with different dynasties of the European, Indian, South American and Chinese monarchs. Never and nowhere has this meaning been used for the designation of some kind of a state formation of a Judaic sense: the facts of history are unknown, when would a small people, living at the meeting point of Africa and Asia, have been creating their empire? In other words, would they have conquered neighboring and far-away countries, asserting their authority and might by force of arms, while imposing tribute on the vanquished and demanding submission and obedience? On the contrary, in all the available sources it is firmly established that the Israelites were steadily persecuted, that they practically at all times over the centuries and millennia went from one captivity to another, from one enslavement to another, and always were subservient to someone. At the same time, however, they in a mysterious way maintained their national uniqueness, often, in defiance of their own practicality; they were true to the faith of the fathers and in any empire achieved striking successes in economics, politics and culture. Depending on sympathies for or antipathies toward the Israelite Jews, the authors of works have explained and explain this real social phenomenon of them by special positive or negative qualities. The impression is being created, that it is not about ordinary people who possess the very same advantages and disadvantages as others, but about some kind of extraordinary subjects, which were engendered either by divine or by dark forces. In any case, nowhere, unfortunately, is there a clear and scientific explanation of this phenomenon, which actually has a place in the history of European and in part of Eastern civilizations. The uniqueness of the Israelite people is affirmed, most of all, by the authority of the world's religions and writings which could make up an enormous library. As asserted by theologians, their faith in a single God and union with the Lord, fortified by a number of rituals and rules and covenants, allegedly played a primary role in the destiny of the Israelites. The fundamental features of this faith lay too at the basis of Christianity, and Mohammedanism, which have united hundreds of millions of people in all the world, and therefore, indirectly, they have played a determining role in the spiritual history of modern mankind. In his book "The Meaning of History," the views of the classical Russian historian, Nikolai Berdyaev, who virtually surrenders scientific positions and transitions to religious mysticism as soon as it becomes a question of the Israelites, are typical in this regard: "To the Jews belonged an absolutely extraordinary role in the origin of the perception of history, in an intense feeling of historic destiny, namely the start of the 'historic' was introduced into the worldwide life of mankind. And I want to address myself seriously to the most historic destiny of the Jews and their significance in world history as one of the continuously functioning worldwide beginnings even to our time, who possess their own specific

mission The Jews have a central significance in history. The Jewish people are, predominately, a people of history, and in their historic destiny is felt the inscrutability of the Divine will. When the materialistic sense of history attracted me, when I was trying to test it for the destinies of peoples, it seemed to me that the historical destiny of the Jewish people was the greatest obstacle for it. It must be said that from any materialistic and positive historic point of view, this people should have ceased to exist. Its existence is a strange, mysterious and wonderful phenomenon, which shows that special designs are connected with the destiny of these people. The survival of the Jewish people in history, their resistance to destruction, their endurance as one of the most ancient peoples of the world under completely extraordinary conditions, that fateful role which these people play in history it all points at the particular, mystic foundations of their historic destiny. ... A particularly strained dramatic quality of history plays out around the destiny of the Jews." Per se, such is the logical plan practically of all positive arguments about the role of the people of Israel in the development of mankind. As regards the negative, then they are united by the notion of "antiSemitism." Researchers have produced hundreds of works in attempts to understand their nature. They have searched for the roots of hatred toward the Jews in their national character, in appearance, in customs and way of life, and in devotion to their religion. Many authors have been struck by mysticism, by genetics and by heredity. Even so-called "instinctive" antiSemitism is considered as a serious scientific hypothesis. That is, hatred for the Jews which supposedly lies in the genes of the anti-Semite. The medieval Christian description of Jews as "devils" is documented at length in the work of the historian Joshua Trachtenberg, The Devil and the Jews (Yale University Press, New Haven, 1941.)
The rather well-known early 20th century historian, Flavien Brenier, in his book "The Jews and the Talmud, wrote: "Of all the tribal and religious questions which have been proposed by history, there was not one more constant or more universal and insoluble than the Jewish question. No matter how far we have dug into the past, since the time of the settling of the Jews among the other tribes, we always meet them in an unceasing struggle with the peoples who have taken them into their midst. Part of ancient history and all of the Middle Ages are filled with the repercussions of this age-old struggle. At the present time, if this struggle between the Jews on the one hand and the Christians and the Moslems on the other, outwardly has obtained a semblance of fewer harsh words, then it only is because Israel skillfully has concealed its, in the past almost always straightforward and open, hatred. But lift up any of these so cunningly fabricated masks, and beneath the threat of national security, material well-being, religious freedom or social structure of every people you almost always will meet the Jew.
The Jews have caused anti-Christian persecutions in many countries in order to appease the ancient hatred of this tribe toward the servants of Christ. It is the Jews who have laid the fire under the social structure, sowing in the world the ideas of collectivism thanks to their agitators and Jewish theorists, the names of whom are: Karl Marx, Lassalle and Singer in Germany; Neumayer, Adler and Aaron Lieberman in Austria; Frieburg, Leon Frankel and Haltmayer in France; James Cohen in Denmark; Dobrogeanu-Gherea in Rumania; Coen, Lyon and Samuel Gompers in the United States.
In the whole world, behind the scenes of all attempts of moral corruption in the area of literature and the arts, you again come across Jews. Finally, the Jews constantly serve as spies against all states, which carelessly have given them refuge."
Professor Steiner in his article in the magazine, Psychology Today, (February 1973) notes: "The triple appeal of the Jews for perfection (through 1/Jewish Ethical Monotheism; 2/Christianity and Islam; 3/messianic socialism) gave birth to

a deadly ill-will in relation to the Jews in the social consciousness. The Jews were transformed into the 'guilty conscience' in the history of Western civilization." One can quote both the admirers of the Jews and their persecutors for as
long as one likes. The 20th century is especially rich in such "research." It is marked by the savage outburst of Nazism, an extreme expression of racism and xenophobia, and simultaneously - by the vast sympathy of the worldwide community for the Jews, who had endured the Holocaust and with the support of the countries victorious over Fascist Germany had created the state of Israel. Such are the two basic stereotypes of the appraisal of Judaism and its native peoples of Israel. And it is extremely difficult to shake them, because there is not one serious scientific work which explains the origin and functionality of the world's Jews as a social phenomenon. Meanwhile, history is full of facts which are contrary to the existing ideas, both positive and negative. It is not only a question of Judaism and Jews, and so it makes sense to determine from which positions in general historians assess that which does not correspond to their views and beliefs. Sadly enough, but one and the same principle is operative: if the facts are not in keeping with generally accepted concepts, then so much the worse for the facts. They hush them up. If it is impossible neither to avoid, nor silence them, then they attach the label that they are erroneous. There is no end of writings of the historians and philosophers of the past which have been declared unscientific only because they are not in keeping with the prevailing historical patterns. But these very patterns, you see, are based on extremely shaky and questionable sources. Everything that supposedly was written by the historians in the early centuries is well-known to us mainly from copies and
scraps of copies of a later time, and that too is just from references of 17th
and 18th century authors to the works of predecessors who they, in their words, read or of which they had heard from their teachers and colleagues. The originals, as a rule, are considered lost, and most often - burnt. Not one library of the world has in its archives the original writings of the ancient writers and historians and the works of the scholars of the early Middle Ages. The works, proclaimed as copies, appeared in a mass way in the world only in the late Middle Ages, as if appearing out of thin air. Some of them were, to the amazement and joy of the historians, in beautiful condition and contained the most detailed reports of the events and the heroes of history of centuries ago. It is enough to recall for example, the works of Josephus Flavius, who describes the Judaic wars in every detail. There arose, however, a paradox which required explanation: before the Middle Ages, no one knew anything about these works. In other words, history in the past for some reason was interrupted for a thousand odd years and a temporary vacuum was created between antiquity and the Middle Ages. Where were the originals in this period, how were they able to be preserved for so many centuries in order to emerge suddenly from nonexistence and there and then, unfortunately, burn up or be lost? The adherents of official historiography have introduced into scientific use the terms "the Dark Ages" and the "Renaissance." They mean that after the Roman Empire, which was destroyed by the barbarians, savagery and neglect dominated over the expanses of the planet for centuries, and no one kept chronicles and did not fix the events worthy for the memory of descendants. And only after the extermination of paganism and the complete victory of Christianity in a refreshed Europe did the rebirth of culture begin in the full meaning of this word. There remained, it is true, the unexplained question about how nonetheless were the writings of the ancients able to be preserved over the extent of so many centuries of the raging of barbarism. But it already interested only a few: a plan of development was created which was convenient for all who

were concerned with history. More precisely, it composed a history which responded to the spiritual needs and practical interests of society of that time. Since then, historians talk about events of great antiquity with steadfast confidence based on the "copies." With fantastic precision, they cite data about the dates of birth and death of kings and emperors, about the locations of battles, and even the dialogues and expressions of heroes of the past. Everyone has heard the immortal words, somehow uttered by the ancients, of the type: "The Rubicon has been crossed," "I came, I saw, I conquered," ((1)) "Et tu, Brute?" ((2)) There are few who meditate over how they became known to the descendants, who wrote them down at that moment when they were spoken, and whether someone was writing them down in general. As before, there is no deep, objective analysis of the authenticity of the historic data, and this results in a steady regulation of history for the political interests of today's states. And what is more, for the momentary needs of one or another ruler. The writing of history continues even in our days. The technology for fabricated historical facts and events which was used widely in the later Middle Ages and which has become the basis for contemporary historiography recently has become understood. The well-known contemporary mathematician A. Fomenko has performed the following research. If one takes the biography of any person and writes down the dates of the primary events of his life, taking the birth date as 0, then a definite series of dates will result: 0 -- birth. 12 -- serious illness. 22 -- marriage. 27 - a war. 29 -- birth of a son - an heir. ....... and so on. The resulting series has an interesting property - individuality. With a sufficiently large quantity of dates, the probability of the coincidence of any two biographies is practically equal to zero. There are a thousand times more chances to win a million playing the lottery than to get even one such coincidence. Fomenko, a mathematician with a worldwide name, is an honorary member of many mathematical societies, and he has put into a computer the dynastic data of many of the royal families both of Europe and of Asia and has compared the results. They have turned out to be amazing. The biographies
coincided when it was a question of rulers who lived earlier than the 17th
century. After the 17th century, the coincidence is not observed. This has forced Fomenko and his colleagues again and again to check the method and the conclusions, but there were no errors. For example, the
biographies of all the Chinese emperors earlier than the 17th century duplicate with precision the biographies of the medieval European rulers.
Besides the duplication of the one and the same heroes under various names, huge shifts in time of the events described have been detected. Among the most significant examples are the numerous coincidences of the numerical characteristics of the biographies of the Egyptian pharos and the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. Analyzing the writings of the Roman historian Josephus Flavius on the computer, and he is one of the classics, the works of whom describe solid periods of history both of Israel and of ancient Rome, the scientists have discovered that, from the point of view of the implacable computer, it is simply a retelling of the Old Testament with the shuffling of the names and geography of events. Or, conversely, the Old Testament was adopted from Flavius. With only the difference that in the Old Testament they are talking about the Judaic kings and Flavius is writing about the Roman emperors. The conclusions are unexpected and absolutely unusual for any person educated in the historic traditions of Western civilization. Meanwhile, they reinforce themselves with strict scientific calculations and rely again after all on facts which neither can be refuted nor concealed. But there is talk ahead about them.

For the time being, let's examine such a question as the uniqueness of the people of the Israelites. So much has been said about it both by supporters and detractors, that, it would seem there isn't even anything else to say here. However, let's not be in a hurry. There are serious grounds for thinking that there wasn't such a secluded ethnic group in antiquity. In general there wasn't. And there is evidence for it. At that, they, which is paradoxical, are conspicuous to everyone who will not consider it worth the effort to see them. It is enough to look at a map of the world and read the descriptions of the customs, ceremonies and rituals of peoples which inhabit the planet. The map shows graphically how widely Judaism was spread among the most diverse of people, located at times thousands of kilometers from each other. They belong to various races; they have different skin color and an outward appearance which is evidence of Mongoloid, Negroid and other roots. They speak in languages which have nothing in common with Hebrew. Their way of life, habits and art are radically different from everything that is peculiar to European Jews. Nonetheless, they maintain that they are descendants of the lost tribes of Israel, of those very same that, according to traditional ideas, at some time were dispersed throughout the whole world as a result of the aggressive wars of neighbors and the devastation of their historic homeland. The legend about the lost tribes is interesting mainly in the fact that it is the only version assumed by official history which explains why Judaism is so spread out. It allows one not to reject the usual dogma as regards Judaism, and in this its value is in the eyes of the theologians. For them, the principle racial distinctions between the Jews of the various continents do not have any significance, that which people who belong supposedly to one nation cannot be so different from each another. Belief in the truth of what is said in the Old Testament about the dispersion of the Jews muffles all arguments.
But here is what the facts say. In the mountainous regions situated along both sides of the border between India and Myanmar (formerly Burma) live the Menashe (Shinlung) people, which numbers up to two million people. These people look like the usual inhabitants of China or Burma. Let us recall that one of the twelve tribes of Israel was called Menashe. According to their version, the ancestors of these people were exiled to Assyria in 722 B.C. with the other tribes of Israel. Later Assyria was conquered by Babylon (607 B.C.) which also was subsequently conquered by Persia (457 B.C.) Greece conquered Persia under Alexander the Great (331 B.C.) Exactly in this period the Menashe tribe was deported from Persia to Afghanistan and other regions.
With the advent and expansion of Islam, many of them turned to this religion. But during the whole time, the Torah scroll was found with the tribe, kept with the elders and priests.
From Afghanistan, the route of the people lay to the east, to China and the valley of the Wei River. This happened in 231 B.C. The tribe has religious holidays which are marked at the very same time as the Jewish. A traditional song about crossing the Red Sea which was written by the ancestors has been handed down from generation to generation: "We shall celebrate the Passover festival; we have crossed the Red Sea. By night our way was lit by fire, by day a cloud showed us the way. Enemies tried to catch us, the sea covered their chariots, and they became food for the fishes. And when we experienced thirst, the rock gave us water to drink. ((3))"
In every village there was a priest, the name of whom was supposed to be Aaron. Included in the duties of such priests was supervision over the life of the villagers and the fulfillment of religious ceremonies. The office of the priest was handed down.
The scrupulous precision of the dates is striking in the tale of a traveler who visited the Menashe relatively recently. A shepherd tribe, which migrated for

centuries from one place to another, entirely illiterate and not having either a calendar or a tradition to fix the birth dates of their own children, nonetheless knows with precision to the year the time of the Assyrian and Babylonian captivity, the period of Alexander's conquests of Macedonia and the date of their own arrival on Chinese land. And this doesn't surprise anyone! Neither the traveler nor the publication that published his story. In that very same Burma, in the Mizo tribe, which has not been disturbed by numerous missionaries and has had no contact with the Menashe people, is observed a great number of Jewish ceremonies and rituals: circumcision, Shabbat, various holidays, etc.
Kashmir Five to seven million people live in this region who also consider themselves descendants of the lost tribes of Israel, although all of them are Moslems.
Here are place with names of obviously Judaic origin: Har Nevo, Beit Peor, Pisga and others. The same thing concerns men's and women's names, and also the names of some villages. The Udu language used in this region includes a great number of Hebrew words.. The priest Kitro in his book, "A General History of the Mughal Empire" declares that the population of Kashmir is descended from the ancient Israelites. The Arab historian and traveller El Bironi made the following record: "In the past, permission to enter Kashmir was given only to Jews." The priest Monstrat has said that during the times of Vasco da Gama in the
15th Century, "all the inhabitants of this land are people who have been living here since ancient times... they trace their ancestry from the ancient Israelites. Their features, external appearance, build, clothing, way of conducting business all show that they are descendants of the ancient Jews." The people who live in these places light candles before the start of the Sabbath, wear curls (resembling forelocks), and beards; they also have the image of the Star of David. In the area of Kashmir which borders with Pakistan and is called Yusmarg (Handwara), there lives a national group which to this day calls itself Bnei Israel (the Sons of Israel.) Many inhabitants of Kashmir say that Bnei Israel is an ancient name for all of the population of Kashmir.
Also in this region exists a strange legend about the fact that Jesus Christ did not die on the cross, but reached the Kashmir Valley in search of the lost ten tribes and lived there right up until death. The local population says that his grave is found here and some inhabitants somehow know where it is located.
In one of the small Kashmir villages, alongside the Wallar Link, exists a belief that Moses himself is buried in this location. Moreover, some believe that none other than King Solomon came to the Kashmir Valley. Two historians - Mullah Nadiri, who wrote "The History of Kashmir," and Mullah Ahmad, the author of "Events of Kashmir," did not doubt that the origin of the Kashmiri people comes from the ancient Israelites.
The Pathans
This society numbers nearly 15 million people, who live on the territory of Persia, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. As the Israeli anthropologist Shalva Weil notes, the Pathans have preserved a tradition that their forefathers are all representatives of those same lost ten tribes of Israel. Numerous Jewish traditions are observed by these people to this day. For example, the Pathans circumcise their children on the eighth day of their life. The Pathans have something similar to the small Jewish Talit called a "Kafan." This is a fourcornered covering on the corners of which are attached tassels.
The Pathans honor Shabbat. For them, this day is a symbol of rest; on Shabbat they do not work, they do not prepare food, and they are not involved with housekeeping. Before each Shabbat, they bake 12 Challahs in order to glorify this day, as was done in the ancient Jewish temple. The Pathans also have the tradition of Kosher. Thus, they don't eat horse flesh

and camel meat, which are very popular in the region, but forbidden for any Jew. Many men bear the names Israel, Samuel, etc. There are practically no such names in the Moslem's world. The Pathans prey toward Jerusalem in the mosques. The Shield of David is almost in every home. The richest inhabitants make it from valuable metals; those who are poorer manage with simple wood. One may see the Star of David on towers, schools, chains and bracelets. In Minerajan there are schools where they are attached to the doors or even suspended above them.
ETHIOPIA. The Falasha lived in the country all the way to the very last decades, another supposedly lost tribe of Israel. As the Czech African researcher Zdenek Polacek ((4)) testifies, up until resettlement to Israel, the Falasha lived (and the rest of them still live) scattered between the largest northern Ethiopian ethnic groups (the Amhara and Tigrean) in the Begemdir and Tigray provinces.
The Falasha called themselves "The Home of Israel" (Beta Israel) or in their native language of the Cushite group they have used the self-designation of "Kayla." Generally the Falasha did not know Hebrew. One may consider the "Sabbath Instructions" (Tehezaze Senbet) as an original work of Falasha literature. In this book, Shabbat is personified - it is understood as a female being, which embodies a heavenly light. In it the legends which relate to Shabbat are set forth in an engaging form. The Judaism of the Falasha is peculiar. It contained a series of elements of the epoch of the first temple (the sacrifice of animals, the institution of the priesthood.) The Falasha didn't know either the Mishnah or the Talmud. A synagogue was in every village or hamlet where at least one priest lived. Falasha priests (cahenat, singular - cahen) were descended from Aaron. The whole community selected a candidate for the position of priest. According to the instructions of the Torah, circumcision (gizret) was done to children on the eighth day after birth.
ECUADOR.
As regards the South American Indians and their possible relationship to the lost tribes of Israel, an article was published in the Israeli newspaper "Maariv" (December 1974) with the following content: "In 1587, the Jesuit Nicholas Delltsu was sent to South America by the King of Spain for missionary purposes - to convert the Indians to Christianity. In Argentina, Nicholas discovered a people who bore Jewish names, namely: Abraham, David, Moses and so forth. To the question about whether they were circumcised, these people answered thus: 'Yes, just like our ancestors.' In this same region were found stone knives used for circumcision. Sharpened stone knives are mentioned also in the Bible as special instruments for completion of the rite of circumcision. The Argentine tribe where a stone slab with three commandments was found causes no less interest: 'Do not steal,' 'Do not lie' and 'Do not kill.' One may assume that these commandments are from the Old Testament, and they appeared in these lands before the arrival of the Spaniards. In 1974, in this very same region were found round stone slabs with a Jewish menorah (a seven-pointed candlestick) on them; along the sides of the menorah in the Aramaic language was the inscription 'Passover.' The Aramaic language, we recall, is the language of the ancient Jews. Alongside the slab was found a long stone, in a shape which resembles a brick, with an engraving of a ship (the emblem of the Zevulun tribe) and with the engraved word 'Zipporah' (the name of Moses' wife, and perhaps, the name of the ship.) Does this mean that the Jews sailed here on a ship? ... Scientists think that this stone is nearly 3,000 years old."
It must be said that the problem of the South American Jewish Indians was occupying minds in Europe as early as the 17th century. The Amsterdam rabbi Manasseh Ben Israel devoted many years to it. A deeply religious man,

Japanese "Shofar"
he believed that there existed on earth the mysterious Sabbatical river Sambation which is mentioned in the Talmud. Its miraculous property is that it, rough and pushing along stones, is absolutely insurmountable on week days, but with the advent of the Sabbath rest it calms and becomes quiet. The Jews who live on that side of the Sambation have no possibility of crossing the river, inasmuch as its would be a violation of Shabbat, and they can only exchange words with their fellow tribesmen on this side of the river, whenever it becomes calm. The ancient historian Josephus Flavius ("The Judaic War") and Pliny the Elder ("Natural History") wrote about the Sambation.
Manasseh Ben Israel emphasized in his book that many learned men believed that the ten tribes of Israel settled on the other side of the river. He also quoted many authors, for example, Josephus Flavius, who in his own works had maintained that supposedly the Emperor Titus himself had seen this river. Later, after a meeting of Manasseh with the missionary Antonio de Montezinos, the rabbi finally was convinced that the American Indians in particular were the descendants of the 10 tribes of Israel. Manasseh learned from Montezinos that in 1642, when the latter was traveling in the mountains of Ecuador, four Indians met him, who greeted him with the Jewish prayer, "Shema Israel." "Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one." The traveler said that the Indians spoke with him in Hebrew and called themselves the descendants of Reubin and Levi. Here even Manasseh came to the conclusion that the American Indians are the descendants of the lost tribes of Israel. On 23 December 1649, he wrote to John Drury, the Puritan divine: "I think that the descendants of the ten tribes live not only in America but also around the whole world. These are those Jews who have not seen the second temple; they, possibly, will be dispersed until the prophecies of their reunification are realized."
Traces of the influence of the lost tribes of Israel are found even in Japan. The Japanese writer Arimasa Kubo has performed special research and come to the conclusion: a great number of the local ceremonies testify to the fact that the Jews arrived at some time on the territory of this country and settled here. Shinto, the traditional religion of the Japanese, bears strikingly pronounced features of Judaism. Arimasa Kubo has collected extensive ethnographic material in support of his conclusion.
Here are some of Arimasa Kubo's conclusions.
The large Suwa-Taisha Shinto shrine is in Nagano prefecture. The traditional Ontohsai festival is held here each year (when the Japanese, as also the Jews, used the lunar calendar, the holiday was held in March or April). During the festival there is a certain activity which illustrates something very similar to the story of the sacrifice of Isaac.
At the festival, right up to the last century, the following happened: they tied a boy to a wooden column and they placed him on a bamboo cover. A Shinto priest, holding a knife in the hand, approached the boy and menacingly cut off a piece of the upper part of the column. Suddenly a messenger (another priest) approached the priest, and they set the boy free.
At this same festival the sacrifice of animals took place, in particular: of 75 does. In ancient times in Japan there were no sheep, and this may be the reason why they used does in this practice (the doe is a kosher animal.) Even in ancient times the tradition of bringing does to the offering seemed strange, since the sacrifice of animals is not a Shinto tradition.
Today the custom has been preserved symbolically to depict how they intend to sacrifice the boy, and then let him go free. There is a

onie-bashira
Yamabushi with a Tokin

wooden column called "oniebashira," which signifies the "sacrificial column."
The Japanese religious
"Yamabushi" priests put small black boxes (tokin) on the forehead the same as the Jews' phylactery. This custom existed in Japan much earlier than Buddhism spread through the country (the 17th century.) The size of the tokin is practically the same as the Jewish phylactery. The only difference is in the shape: if the Jewish phylactery is square, then the Japanese tokin is round. .
The Yamabushi has one more thing in the arsenal: a large sea shell which he uses as a horn. This horn is reminiscent of the Jewish shofar from a ram's horn. Even the sounds produced by both instruments are similar to each other.
In Japan there is the legend of "Tengu," a legendary being who possesses supernatural capabilities. The essence of the legend is: A Ninja, while carrying out the wishes of his master, goes looking for Tengu in the mountains in order to receive the same capabilities. Tengu not only endows the Ninja with special powers, but also gives him the "tora-no-maki" (a scroll of the torah.) This "scroll of the torah" is given to the Ninja as a very valuable, almost magical book which is capable of helping in any situation. The phrase "torano-maki" has become a Japanese idiom and is widely used to the present day.
The clothing of the Israelite and Japanese priests is very similar to each other. Marvin Tokayer, a rabbi who has lived in Japan for 10 years, has written: "The linen clothing which the Japanese Shinto priests wear has the same shape as the linen clothing of the ancient Israelite priests."
The construction of a Japanese Shinto shrine is similar to the construction of the Tent of Revelation in ancient Israel. Inside, the Tent of Revelation in ancient Israel consisted of two parts. The first is the Sanctuary; the second is the Holy of Holies. The Japanese Shinto shrine also is divided into two parts. The internal arrangement of the Japanese shrine is similar to the arrangement of the Jewish portable temple. Only the Shinto priests or special people have the right to enter the Sanctuary. Priests only enter the Holy of Holies of Japanese shrines during special festivals. Precisely the same as how the Jewish temple was arranged.
Opposite a Japanese shrine there usually are two statues of lions, known as "komainu." They sit on both sides of the entrance and play the role of guards of the shrine. There was the very same tradition in ancient Israel, too. In the temple of the Most High in Israel and in the palace of King Solomon there were statues of lions (Melachin (Third Book of Kings) 7:36, 10:19).

Generally, in ancient Japan no lions were to be found. Nonetheless, there have been portrayals of lions in Japanese shrines since ancient times.
The Japanese have a tradition of using salt for purification and consecration of something. Sometimes people sprinkle salt after the presence nearby of an unpleasant person.. It is possible the ancient Israelites had the very same tradition. For example, when Abimelech destroyed Shechem, he "sowed it with salt." (Book of Judges (Shoftim 9:45).
Although Shinto is a polytheistic religion, Kubo thinks that he has the reasons to propose that at some time Shintoists believed in Yaweh. "Amenominakanushi-no-kami" is considered to be the very first Shinto god. The Japanese believe that he was born before all the gods, lived in the center of the universe, had no form, was eternal and, being the invisible creator of the universe, was the sole god.
The colossal geographic prevalence of those or other forms of Judaism leads to definite conclusions: either the Jewish Israelites are the ancestors of nearly all mankind, or there never existed a Jewish people, and the followers of the faith of Abraham called themselves Jews, to which tribal clan they would not have belonged.
In connection with this, the words of Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, a contemporary Jewish theologian and spiritual mentor of Russia's Jews, are recalled: "The Jews are not a nationality. They are a metaphorical essence of a people who bear a defined mission and are called upon to become an instrument for the execution and realization of the divine plan" ("Exodus" magazine, 2003.)
Adin Steinsaltz is resolving the problem of the present definition of the Jews along a maternal line using a comparison of the Jews with noblemen. The nobility has been and is hereditary and is conferred for any kind of services. The Jews go along the very same paths. Some Jews are defined according to maternal lines; others go through a rite of dedication and conversion.
In our opinion, the comparison of Jews with nobility has a deep historical sense, and A. Steinsaltz, it is possible, doesn't even suspect how right he is.

LEGENDS OF "ANCIENT" GREECE
As we already said in the preface, the creation in the Middle Ages of a chronology which predominates even today in historiography, by no means was caused God knows from where by the whim of the lovers of antiquity who had emerged. This is in principle an important aspect which demands explanation. Otherwise, it will be complicated to understand what happened with the history, for example, ofEurope in Scaliger's accounts and of his followers. The political situation in the European countries, the aspiration of those holding supreme power to demonstrate to the whole world the antiquity of their race and on this basis to confirm the legitimacy of claims for leadership both within the state and in the international arena have become the chief stimulus in the creation of a traditional chronology. Well, where there's a demand, the supply springs up too. Under all monarchal courts immediately are found literate and in many instances, talented people who carry out the most important political orders. It is clear, not unselfishly. Often even his life depended on the talent and eagerness of the writer. It didn't cost the all-powerful kings and dukes anything to send an untalented scribbler to the block if his writing didn't suit them. And there was another, powerful stimulus: rewards, honors, scientific titles, and the benevolence of the monarchs. By the way, this works in out time, too. Not long ago, a certain author showed in his writing that the representatives of the now ruling houses of Europe are the descendants of Jesus Christ! (D. Kalyuzhny and A. Zhabinsky. "The Other History of Wars.") They complimented him for it and an English prince even conferred some awards. But let us return to Joseph Scaliger, the founder of the traditional chronology who lived and labored in that epoch. Then, besides the dynastic, the question of the origin of the European peoples was one of the most pressing. The process of their formation in the modern sense of this word took place, and each of them, naturally, wanted to know who the ancestors were. The roots were called various things: both biblical and Greek and barbarian, that is, German and English. The Trojan version of the origin of the French was popular. The historians situated the centers of ancient cultures in their works not only in Greece and Rome, but also in Spain, England and France. Everything depended on in which of the capitals the writers were living. The very fundamental requirements for roots were equal and common everywhere: the more ancient, the better, and the more "antique" writings are found, the more convincing. After the destruction of Rome by the forces of Charles V (1527), there appeared so many new versions of the origin of the European nations that Anthony Grafton, author of a book about Scaliger, compared the historical science of that time with a mirrored labyrinth in which it is impossible to understand and determine anything. Joseph Scaliger (1540 - 1609),

philosopher, analyst of ancient texts and mathematician, decided to put everything in order. He didn't erect his creations in an empty place, but to a significant degree, adhered to the generally accepted ideas of his epoch. In particular, to the very popular idea of the "succession of kingdoms" or the "succession of monarchies." According to this idea, some kind of a center of worldwide supremacy - a capital of the main king, of an emperor, existed from the very beginning of human history. At that, it changed its location several times. As a result, the history somehow was divided into three parts - three monarchies. The first was called the Babylonian. At first they called it Assyrian (Chaldean), then - Persian-Medean. But the capital remained the same - Babylon. The second is the Greek or Macedonian with a capital in Alexandria. It had been thought, and even now it is thought in traditional history that the founder of the monarchy, Alexander of Macedonia made Alexandria his capital. Finally, the Roman monarchy. They called it the last worldwide monarchy. It was split into the Eastern and Western Roman Empires. They, for their part, were broken up into a multitude of independent states. Such is the overall plan. As the adherents of the new chronology note, its traces are maintained in modern history textbooks. Only instead of "monarchies" the term "succession of civilizations" is used. The first civilization arose in the area between two rivers - the "Babylonian Kingdom," then "ancient" Greece appeared, AND, finally - Italy - the "Roman Empire." (Gleb Nosovskiy, Anatoliy Fomenko "A New Chronology of Russia, England and Rome") If one tries to examine the idea of the "three kingdoms" in more detail, then questions unavoidably arise which demand explanations. How in general was the idea born about worldwide monarchies? Why in particular are there three of them and not two or five? On what grounds were the kingdoms placed in the pages of the historic works, in particular in such an order and not in any other kind? The adherents of the traditional chronology confidently answer that these are the results of archaeological research, an analysis of the compositions of the ancient authors, linguistic investigations and so on and so forth. Analyzing these questions in particular, scholars of many generations have created truly vast libraries of works. Hundreds of books, dissertations, surveys, and abstracts written, for example, one after the other about Ancient Greece alone. Is it possible their authors relied on sources which didn't contain a grain of truth, didn't reflect the real situation of things? That doesn't happen, they tell us. And they will be right. The inventive nature of "ancient" sources consists not in the fact that the events described in them and their heroes are fantastic, but in the fact that they, these events, which occurred in the Middle Ages, have been renamed and spread over various epochs and countries in accordance with the ideological and other purposes of noblemanly clients. In connection with this, the notion of a "worldwide monarchy" is of special interest for us. In Scaliger's epoch there are no such monarchies. There exists, as already has been said, a multitude of independent states. From where, then, was the idea of "a center of worldwide supremacy" taken? I doubt from the imagination of historians. The memory of such a
center of such a monarchy was still very fresh in the 16th century. Yes, there was a worldwide empire, at that, according to historic measurements, very recently, and all the states, which arose on its ruins, all the life of the people still bore on itself the indelible stamp of this grandiose state structure, the first in the history of mankind, under the name of the Byzantine Empire. As regards the quantity of "worldwide empires," then it needs to be said that Scaliger's predecessors and he himself didn't write history, but computed it. There were whole trends in just such a method of historiography numerology, cabala and astrology. Scaliger's older contemporary, Jean Boden, composed a solid work, "A Method of Easy Determination of History," in which he showed in particular, how, in his opinion, to detect empires.

He wrote: "The square of 12 is 144, and the cube is 1,728. Not one empire in its existence exceeded the value of the sum of these numbers; therefore, the larger numbers should be rejected. Of the spherical numbers included in the great number there are four - 125, 216, 625 and 1,296. With the aid of several of these numbers. . . . . we permit ourselves to study the miraculous changes of almost all states. . . . . Starting with the cube of 12, we shall find that the monarchy of the Assyrians from King Ninus to Alexander the Great embodies this number precisely. . . It would be more accurate to say that a single monarchy of the Assyrians and Persians existed than there allegedly existed two different monarchies. In a different case, we are supposed to distinguish the kingdom of the Chaldeans, Medians and Parthians from the Assyrian-Persian monarchy. . ." It is impossible to distinguish; otherwise, the great number will be broken. That is, the author discovered an entire world empire, as they say, at the tip of a pen, as a century later the astronomers Leverrier and Adams calculated the planet Neptune. Actually, the "perception of history" is an extraordinarily easy method. And discoveries, as we see, of a strictly limited quantity of empires. Relying on an understanding of numerology, the author also easily and naturally finds other chronological dates of various states in antiquity. He juggles the names like a magician: "As regards the cube of seven, there also are many examples. This number was chosen by Moses for the establishment of a great festival. From the victory of the Jews over Haman with the aid of Esther to the victory over Antioch, 343 years had passed, and both that and the other victory were
gained on the 13th day of the 12th month, which the Jews call Adar. . . That same number of years had passed from the time, when Augustus I established control, until the time when Constantine the Great achieved domination. The kingdom of the Persians, from Cyrus to Alexander, lasted 210 years - a number which is formed from 30 whole sevens." The whole book is built on such arguments. For Boden, history is not the past of mankind, but a design created as a result of manipulations with numbers. He is a faithful adherent of the Masons and numerologists who impart a mystical essence to numbers. It wouldn't be worth talking about Boden's exercises if they weren't used and developed in the works of Scaliger and his followers, especially Petavius. The astrologers, numerologists and prophets are who laid the basis of the traditional chronology. And this is appropriate. One need remember that other methods for the analysis of history still didn't exist then. There were and could not be any other fundamental principles besides those designated in the Bible and in a number of mystical studies. Thus, numerology for Scaliger and his followers is not a questionable mind game, but a serious method of historic research. One need recognize that they were executing a task of grandiose complexity: they were forming a plan of the development of all world history! No one after them has undertaken such a fundamental problem. They wrote, more than once, numerous volumes of writings with the envelopment of the majority of countries and peoples, but in the main it was the very same plan of Scalger and Petavius. What is especially important, in this plan such a structural-forming medieval result also is used as the theory of historic cycles. Quite a number of the names of the disciples of their theory have been preserved. Traditional historiography relates them to various epochs and peoples. Here are both Ancient Greece, and Rome, and China and Central Asia. The Roman historian Polybius supposedly as early as before the start of the Christian Era wrote a 40 volume "General History," in which it was based on the notion of "historic cycles." Polybius and his confederates examined the history of society as a rotation, as a movement along a closed circle with a periodic return to the starting point. This meant that mankind moves endlessly along a wheel, stretched out in time. Then an understanding of the cycle as a spiral began to prevail, the repetition of analogous, but distinct phases in a forward movement, an

undulating and progressive development. (Yuriy Yakovets "Cycles. Crises. Forecasts" 1999) As is explained in the books on "cycles," all great phenomena and facets of life also have their own "spirals," and each country, it is clear, also. They endlessly are superimposed on each other, resembling on the whole the entangled turns of barbed wire. We will not examine the validity of such a vision of history. Perhaps there are its own reasons in it. Let us say only that it too now is enjoying relative popularity. In the times of Scaliger it was overwhelming. And it allowed the chronologists to arrange historical events as the theory suggested. And if they discovered that, let us assume, on the coil of "ancient" Greece, which corresponds to today's coil, there is no event similar to it, that has happened now, and then they sent a duplicate of such an event into extreme antiquity. Since history is repeated, that means at some time the very same thing happened as today. At the same time, history should have been sufficiently consistent and allowed to fabricate solid and convincing genealogical rulers and to fill the past as if it were with significant events which have great moral and educational significance for the descendants. Scaliger and his followers in the literal sense of the word created history and were convinced that they were doing a good thing. They fabricate history, unfortunately, in all epochs, including too in ours, and in all countries, recasting it in accordance with present political interests. Let us look at how the medieval reality of "ancient" Greece was reflected in history. What do we know about this country? We know, to our delight, much. To our delight for the reason that none of the originals of the "ancient Greek" compositions ever were in the hands of even the most conscientious researchers. Some are only references in works ascribed to various chroniclers, frequently also to the legendary. At that, these works appeared after the millennium of the "Dark Ages," when no one and nowhere recalled anything about a Greece and a Rome. In the Middle Ages themselves both the volumes of ancient historians and the poems of Homer and also of other Hellas poets, and legends and myths were found suddenly. . . Where they were hidden for ten centuries, no one knows. And they still say that there are no miracles in the world. But we will not find fault. The traditional views are such: the history of Ancient Greece starts from the turn of the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C. -- with the rise of the first state
formations on the island of Crete, and ends in the 2nd - 1st centuries B.C., when the Greek and Hellenistic states of the Eastern Mediterranean were conquered by Rome and included as part of the Roman Mediterranean power. We shall single out several bright moments in this history, which are the most well-known to the readers. One of the most popular is the Trojan War, described in the poems of the great blind poet, Homer. Historians have been drawing from them over the centuries one or the other signs of the past. The poems "Iliad" and "Odyssey" became, per se, a source for the construction of a whole section of Greece's history. The Trojan War, as the traditional historians write, is a war of the Achaeans
against Troy at the end of the 13th century B.C. According to mythological tradition, the abduction by Paris, the son of the Trojan king Priam, of the beautiful Helen, the wife of the King of Sparta, Menelaus was the casus belli. Then irregulars of kings from almost all the areas and cities of Greece, who at sometime had laid claim to Helen's hand and were connected by a vow to always aid him whose wife she became, were assembled. According to Iliad there were 100,000 warriors in the Achaean force, and 1,186 ships. An attempt to obtain Helen's return by negotiations (the embassy of Menelaus and Odysseus to Priam) failed, and a siege of the city began which lasted more than 9 years.
The events of the final, 10th year of the war make up the content of "Iliad." Apollo's priest, Chryses, asked Agamemnon to return to him a

daughter who had been taken captive, Chryseis, but was refused. Apollo, who had been aiding the Trojans, inflicted a plague on the Achaean forces. In order to propitiate the god, Agamemnon returned Chryses' daughter, but in exchange took Briseis from Achilles as his prisoner. The angry Achilles refused to take part in the war. The Achaeans began to meet with failure after this, and many heroes were casualties. Only when the Trojans burst into the Achaean camp and began to threaten the ships did Achilles send his friend Patroclus, having given him his own armor. The Trojans ran to the protection of the fortress walls, but Patroclus died by Hector's hand. Achilles, avenging his friend and in new armor forged by Hephaestus, entered the battle and killed Hector, desecrating his body. Hector's father, the old Priam, on coming to Achilles prayed for the return of his son's body. At the sight of the father's grief, Achilles softened and gave back Hector's body. "Iliad" ends with the funerals of Patroclus and Hector. Excavations in the places referred to in the myths about the Trojac war supposedly confirm the historicity of a huge military clash of Achaeans with
the tribes of the northwestern part of Asia Minor in the beginning of the 13th Century B.C. So write the traditional historians. They suppose that the fall of Troy occurred in 1225 B.C. The precision of the date is astonishing if one considers that no written sources which confirm it exist. Well and when did Homer live? According to the Columbian Encyclopedia (U.S.), the poems "Iliad" and Odyssey were written by the poet for an aristocratic audience in Asia Minor before 700 B.C. That is, if one is to believe this report, the author lived 500 years after the war. Just how come one can write beautiful verses and about events of such long standing? One can expect everything from poets. But, you see, Homer didn't write anything, not ever: he was blind. Moreover, his poems, written in small print, take up 700 pages! Let us assume Homer possessed a staggering memory and recalled all the lines composed by him. But you see, the poems weren't written during down his lifetime as well. Commentators report to readers that a special commission in Athens wrote down the "Iliad" and Odyssey" for the first time several hundred years later. How did these works then get to the commission? The traditional historiography promotes the following version: fellow citizens of the poet learned by heart all 700 pages, then retold them to new audiences, who in their own turn, to the next generations, and thus it was continued for several centuries.
For the sake of fairness, it must be said that the 20th century knows several outwardly similar cases. When the Kirghiz, who live in Central Asia,
received their written language for the first time (the first half of the 20th century), their national oral epos "Manas" finally was fixed on paper, the text of which was handed down from generation to generation. In Uzbekistan in that very same decade, the "Alpamysh" epos was written down. Musicians and poets used special techniques and methods for the fixation of the famous Uzbek "Makom," the popular sung legends of hoary antiquity. It would seem, in relation to "Iliad" and "Odyssey," one also can assume such a variant. But all the trouble is in the fact that these poems over many centuries are the "Dark Ages"! - they were not known to anyone. The traditional historians themselves write: "In medieval Europe, they knew Homer only through the quotations and references from Latin writers and
Aristotle. At the end of the 14th century, the Italian humanists became more closely acquainted with Homer. . . Only in 1723 did the first translation of the "Iliad" appear, done by the poet Anton Maria Salvini". It is asked, where then was the text of the Homeric compositions for nearly 2,000 years? In which heads were they kept? And did a blind poet by the name of Homer exist in any event? Vico (1668-1744), the author of the work "Principles of the New Science Concerning the Common Nature of Nations" thought that the Homeric poems were written by various authors and in various epochs. He, as also many others, started from the works themselves. They were written as

magnificent verse, polished to perfection, and strike one with a wealth of vocabulary and persistent expressions, and this testifies beyond controversy to the fact that the author or authors were grounded in the solid poetical traditions of their time. However, we know neither Homer's predecessors nor
followers. As early as the 20th century, there existed the opinion that Homer created in proud solitude. On the other hand, the composition of the poems is loose, full of long, drawn out passages, unnecessary insertions and digressions, which don't relate to the subject. For specialists, this is serious evidence of the fact that more than one author had art and part in the creation of Iliad and "Odyssey." A question about the authorship of the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey" was put forward in 1795 also by the German scholar Friedrich August Wolf in a forward to an edition of the Greek text of the poems. Wolf considered the creation of a large epos in an illiterate period as impossible, suggesting that the tales were created by various poets. Scholars were divided into "analysts," followers of Wolf's theory (the German scholars Karl Lachmann, A Kirchhoff with his theory of "small eposes;" G. Herman and the English historian George Grote with their "theory of the basic kernel," in Russia F.F. Zelinskiy shared it) and the "unitarians," adherents of a strict unity of the epos (the translator of Homer, Johann Heinrich Voss and the philosopher Gregor Wilhelm Nitzsch, Friedrich Schiller, Johann Wolfgan von Goethe, and Hegel in Germany, and N.I. Gnedich, V.A. Zhukovsky and Alexander Pushkin in Russia.) At the same time, however, not one of them doubted that nonetheless there had been a Trojan War. The archaeological digs performed later, in particular by Heinrich Schliemann literally according to Homer's poems, also somehow showed that the Trojans at sometime had been beaten with the Achaeans there in particular where the "Iliad" indicated. Contemporary commentators of the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey" are in full rapture from Schliemann: "The sensational discoveries of G. Schliemann in 1870 - 80 have shown that Troy, Mycenae and the Achaean strongholds are not myths, but reality. . The consistencies of a number of his finds in the fourth tunneled tomb in Mycenae with Homer's accounts have amazed Schliemann's contemporaries. The impression was so strong that Homer's epoch for a long time began to be associated with the period of the flourishing of Achaean Greece in the
14th - 13th centuries B.C." However, in other works devoted to the Trojan War, the traditional historians just as joyfully write: "Like Columbus, he opened up a world more astonishing that that which he had searched. These riches were many centuries older than Priam and Hecuba; these graves were not the tombs of the Atrides, but ruins of an Aegean civilization in continental Greece, just as ancient as the Minoan epoch of Crete. While not suspecting it himself, Schliemann confirmed the truth of Horace's famous line: vixerunt fortes ante Agamemnona - "Brave men were living before Agamemnon." So, finally, did Heinrich Schliemann discover Troy or something else? No one knows. Indignation bursts from archaeologists when they recall Heinrich Schliemann. They write that he was a self-taught person, had digs while not observing any rules and destroyed beyond hope whole cultural groups at the site of an ancient settlement, which arbitrarily was called Troy by him. That is how the discoverer turned out. As regards the Trojan War itself, then it turns out there is evidence of its immediate participants. That is, there was. And these participants are called Dictis and Dares Phrygius. Only they didn't live in great antiquity, but in the Middle Ages and wrote not in Greek, but in the Latin language. At that, their "dry and monotonous account of the facts of the siege" was thought of more highly in those times than "Homer's incredible poem." In particular, not just anybody writes in such expressions but the traditional historians themselves. The journals of Dictis and Dares gave birth in medieval Europe to a multitude of works which are combined today under the title of the "Trojan
Cycle." And their fame eclipsed the fame of Homer until the 17th century

itself: "Dares Phrygius became one of the most well-known writers of antiquity." But, perhaps, Dictis and Dares also were invented? Nothing like it. Both of them are mentioned in Homer's poems. If one recalls that the text of "Iliad" and "Odyssey" appeared for the first time only in the 14th century, then everything falls into place. They really existed and really wrote their journals long before the author or authors of the poems which afterwards mentioned them in their own compositions. There is an interesting fact in the history of the Middle Ages: supposedly
in the 8th - 9th centuries A.D. at the court of Charlemagne there lived the famous poet Englebert. And he bore the name of Homer! Would he one way or the other give his own name to the Greek variant of the description of the Trojan War? However, we won't persist in this, because there is one more fact worthy
of mentioning. The 19th century German historian Ferdinand Gregorovius in the thorough monograph, "A History of the City of Athens in the Middle Ages," gives a detailed alphabetized index of the names of rulers, heroes and warriors. Among them is also the family Saint Homer, that is St. Homer, who
played a noticeable role in the history of Italy and Greece in the 13th Century A.D. Representatives of this family were participants of the "Trojan" war of
the 13th century. It is fully assumable that someone of the representatives of this family - a remarkable poet of the 14th - 15th centuries - collected and wrote down the family legends of the family of Homers about this war in the form of the two grandiose epic poems. In any case, "Iliad" and "Odyssey" are belated works of art which were created in the Renaissance epoch as the poetic peak of all the "Trojan Cycle." (Gleb Nosovskiy, Anatoliy Fomenko "Russia and Rome," Vol. 1) The Trojan War in "ancient" Greece is an imaginary reflection of the Gothic War, which occurred in the early Middle Ages. A detailed comparison of the two wars shows their coincidence even in trifles. We shall cite some of the results of the research described in the book "Russia and Rome." The Trojan kingdom knows seven kings who ruled in sequence. The first is the founder of the city and all the state. The fall of Troy and the death of the kingdom occurs with the seventh king. The Roman Empire, described by Livy, also has seven emperors who ruled in sequence. The first is the founder of the city and the state. Rome comes to an end and is turned into a republic during the seventh empire. Both wars last almost equally: the first - 10, the second - 12 years. The Trojan kingdom was destroyed twice. And these collapses are the only ones in its history. In the history of the Roman Empire (according to Livy) and its duplicate - Roman Empire III (in the West), there also were two collapses. The second and final is the Gothic War. These two collapses are also the same in the history of Roman Empire III. The two newcomer-strangers Jason and Hercules destroyed the first Trojan kingdom. "Newcomers from the West. . . captured the city" ("Trojan Legends") The two newcomer-strangers Odoacer and Theodoric destroyed the "purely Roman" Empire (First Empire), having invaded from the northwest. After the first destruction, the Trojan empire, in essence also becomes Trojan: earlier it had been called the Dardan Settlement. After the first collapse, the Roman Empire in the West changes its name. It is turned into an Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy. A Tarquin-ruled dynasty. The Trojan name arose from the name of the new king, Troil, who "built more than others in the city and gave it his own name - Troy." A new name appears at the end of the Roman Empire II - the Emperor Trajan. The newcomer Greeks complete the second and final destruction of the Trojan kingdom. The second and final collapse of the Roman Empire III in the West also is the handiwork of the newcomer Greco-Romans.

The Trojan War flared up because of a woman - a so-called offence to Helen, wife of Menelaus. The Tarquin War was caused by an offence to Lucretia. This is most colorfully described by Livy. A quarrel breaks out between the husband rulers of the kingdoms over whose wife is better. "Each extremely praises his own," and the quarrel soon develops into an armed conflict. In the tale about Troy, Paris kidnaps Helen by force. According to Livy, Sextus Tarquinius seizes Lucretia and dishonors her. . . Don't let the numbering of Roman Empires I, II and III confuse the readers. In the opinion of the adherents of the new chronology, the real Holy
Roman Empire was in the 10th - 11th centuries. The rest, which are referred to by the traditional historiography in various centuries are the imaginary reflections of the Middle Ages. The parallels between the Trojan and Gothic wars are endless. Even the famous episode with the Trojan horse coincides. What is known about it? It is so huge that several hundred warriors were able to find room inside it. It stands on wooden legs. It in some way got into the city. In "Iliad" it says that the stupid Trojans pulled it into Troy. This is as absurd as the historical joke about the fact that the shepherds of ancient Greece were singing Homer's verses for several hundred years while educated people didn't write down the poems. (Dmitri Kalyuzhny, Aleksandr Zhabinsky) Is there anything similar in the Gothic war? Of course. The Greeks also used guile in the storming of Naples (New Town or New Rome), which they had not been able to take in any way. They penetrated it at night through a huge, recently deserted aqueduct which was a stone tunnel with an exit beyond the fortress walls. In the morning they opened the gates, and the troops who attacked slaughtered the still sleeping defenders of the city. The evidence of the fact that the famous Trojan horse is the poetic form of the real aqueduct water supply is not complicated. The first Trojan chronicles which reached us, as we recall, were written in Latin. And in Latin the word "horse" is written "equa," and water is "aqua." That is, practically the same. Moreover, the word aqueduct - "aqua-ductio" - "that which leads water" is identical to the word "that which leads a horse" "equa-ductio." There is a difference in only one vowel. Therefore, aqueduct also was changed into a perception of the late foreign authors who confused one vowel, in horse, which called into being a blossoming of absurd legends about the Trojan horse. It must be said that there are a lot of similar events in literature, and it concerns in particular the literature and not the true history. Only the most well-known. We already have talked about the fact that in the translation of the Old Testament from Hebrew to Greek the Reed Sea, on the bottom of which Moses led the Jews during the Exodus from Egypt, was turned into the Red and even remained so in the text of the Scripture. There also is another famous example, but it is somewhat amusing. Charles Perrault, the author of the world-renowned tale "Cinderella," was not writing in the least about a glass slipper which fell off the heroine's foot at the ball. He was writing about a lady slipper, edged with fur. But in the translation from the French, the lady slipper by mistake became a glass slipper, and this was so in keeping with the spirit of the tale, that the slipper has stayed in it forever. And so the aqueduct in the passing of centuries in the poems was changed into the Trojan horse. The classical period in this story, according to the accepted periodization, embraces the time from the threshold of the 6th and 7th centuries to 338 B.C. Greece had to defend its distinctive character and right to existence in a struggle with the Achaemenid power, which was realizing its expansion to the West. Let us chose one moment in this battle: In 480 B.C., a huge Persian army and navy under the leadership of King Xerxes invaded Greece. Despite the heroic resistance of a detachment of Spartans headed by King Leonidas in the Thermopylae ravine, the Persians broke through to Central Greece. The population of Athens fled, the conquerors captured the city and plundered it. The main events occurred in 479 B.C., when the Persians endured two defeats - both on the land and at sea. Greece had been able to defend its independence.

The legendary battle at Thermopylae of 300 Spartans with the Xerxes horde is well known to the whole civilized world. It is glorified in many works as an example of fearlessness and bravery of people in a struggle for the freedom and independence of their country. The "father of history" Herodotus wrote about it in his monumental work, "The Histories," which is devoted mainly to the wars of the Greeks with the Persians. But whether there was such a battle in actual fact and really whether Herodotus lived in the 5th century B.C. evokes deep and well-founded doubts. Having glanced at Ferdinand Gregorovius' writing devoted to medieval Greece, we will find there a detailed description of the same battle. With only one difference: instead of the Spartans, 300 knights were active in it. The events in the Middle Ages developed according to the same plan as with "antiquity." (According to the "historic cycle"!) Byzantine and Turkish forces attack the country (1275 A.D.) Much about them is curious, the navy supports them from the sea. They surround the city of Neopatria. The city's ruler, having safely escaped and stealing his way through Thermopylae to Duke Jean la Roche, asks him for help. The latter gathers 300 well armed knights and meets the aggressors in the Thermopylae ravine. By the way, among the knights is Lord de Saint Homer, that is, of the Homers. But this is an aside. At the sight of the large numbers of enemy, Jean la Roche pronounces the famous phrase: "Many people, but few men." It is well known by the fact that, it turns out, the Persian King Xerxes pronounced it 1,800 years before the duke, when he was preparing to battle with the 300 Spartans. Here are Herodotus' precise words: "Then, one can say, it became clear to all, and especially to the king himself, that the Persians have many people, but among them the men are few." An absolute coincidence. Therefore, it cannot be accidental. Ferdinand Gregorovius is in some confusion from such a turn: "It seems to me that these words are borrowed from Herodotus.. . Although its expression was able to enter the duke's head simply at the sight of a similar state of affairs." The author, naturally, is in no condition even to imagine that it is a question of one and the same battle, and that, most likely, Herodotus was writing his book not in great antiquity, but as early as after the battle at Thermopylae,
not earlier than the 14th century. Otherwise, he would not have found out what the most gallant and worthy duke had said. Ferdinand Gregorovius generally notes quite a few coincidences that occurred in the Middle Ages, with the period of "antiquity." For example, of the sort: "Suleiman, the valiant son of Orhan, crossed the Hellespont by night in 1345. . . Here for the first time the Turks gained a foothold on European soil. The Byzantines compared this horde of conquerors with the Persians and even called them that same name." That which they were comparing was not surprising: people always compare something somehow. But the fact that they called the Turks Persians defies any explanation. This in any case what the German masses of the Second World War called the French, recalling Napoleon's campaigns. The next famous event in Ancient Greece is the Peloponnesian War of 431 - 404 B.C. It is described in detail by Thucydides, a military leader and Greek historian of that time, in "The History of the Peloponnesian War." The traditional historiography reports that his work became will known in Europe thanks to the Latin translation of Lorenzo Valla and the English of Thomas Hobbes. That is, according to historic measurements, quite recently. Just where did the book disappear over the centuries until it became well-known in Europe? Traditional historiography is keeping quiet. The historians are saying nothing and because of the fact that the views of Thucydides', who is well-known for his aphorism, are very close to the logical creations of the father of political science, Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527 A.D.), who thought that in history one must search for methods of strengthening sovereign power and that its main goal is to serve the interests of the rulers. Thucydides expressed himself more abstractly, but per se he thought the same way: "History is a philosophy in examples." With such an approach there cannot even be talk about an objective account of the movement of events that took place. This is a view of a medieval historian

who worked for the sake of certain goals. And you see, between Thucydides and Machiavelli, in the opinion of the traditional chronology, is the abyss of centuries. Let us look at what Thucydides writes. In 431 B.C., a war broke out between the Peloponnesian and Athenian naval allies, which had seized all of Greece and received the name of the Peloponnesus. It continued, with a short period of truce all of 27 years, but Thucydides told only about the first 20 years. Adherents of the new chronology think that well-known medieval war in Greece (1374 - 1387), which led to the death of the Catalan state on this country's territory, was its original.
The people of Navarre and the Athenians participate in the14th century war. A most huge congress preceded it, at which delegates from all the areas of Greece had gathered. Sparta and Athens collide in the Peloponnesian War. The congress of deputies of the Peloponnesian Alliance preceded it. In both cases, the war started a year after the meetings. In the Middle Ages, the Peloponnesian and Corinthians invade the enemy's territory. The Corinthian principality is the strongest in Peloponnesia in that epoch. The Spartans (Peloponnesians) headed by the Peloponnesian Alliance attack Athens.. In both cases, Athens held out in the first military period. In both cases the war bears a violent nature. Both Gregorovius and Thucydides write about it.
At the end of the war of the 14th century, Nerio Acciaiuoli becomes the leader. A successful military leader, a fine diplomat. His forces capture Athens in particular. At the end of the Peloponnesian War, the Spartan Lysander advanced into first place. A successful military leader, a fine diplomat. He destroyed the Athenian state in particular. The storming of Athens in both cases is identical. The victor Nerio establishes a new political order - tyranny. He is now called "the Athenian Tyrant." After the victory, Lysander introduces in Athens "the tyranny of the thirty." This period in the history of the ancient city also is called: "the government of the thirty tyrants." ... The coincidences fall as if from the horn of plenty in the hands of the goddess Gaia. The fact that brought itself to the attention of the adherents of the new chronology is that Thucydides in his "History" described three eclipses which occurred in the Mediterranean Sea area during the war. In as much as eclipses occur with invariable precision and regularity over the course of thousands and thousands of years, the possibility appeared to determine in which centuries in particular and years this astronomical show took place. It turned out that of the temporal segment from 900 B.C. to 1700 A.D. there are only two precise astronomical calculations. And both of them are related
to the 11th century. In the first solution - for the 1039th, 1046th and 1057th
years. In the second, for the 1113th, 1140th and 1151st years. In both cases, the triad embraces 18 years each and the intervals between the eclipses coincide. There has not been such a triad of eclipses in the last 2,600 years of precise astronomical calculations. It is useless to argue with astronomy. Therefore, one may say unambiguously that there were no such eclipses in ancient Greece. Consequently, there wasn't even the Peloponnesian War itself. True, the eclipses also don't occur for the years of the medieval war. But as has been discovered by the adherents of the new chronology, a displacement of temporal segments happened steadily in the traditional historiography, which is called chronological shifts, when several real events are mixed up onto one whole and later carried into the distant past. The mathematical methods used in the analysis of traditional history have shown that these shifts and carry-overs are not chaotic. The have approximately the same magnitude and are found in hundreds of cases. And what is more in accordance with the "historic cycles" and Masonic numerology with its magical numbers. The graphical representation of the

Scaliger chronology, created by contemporary scholars, even looks on the surface like symbols of masonry - the compass (Greek history) and the set square (Roman history.) This, as Dmitri Kalyuzhny and Aleksandr Zhabinsky write, is the "composite center" of Scaliger history. ("The Other History of Wars") Moving further along the time scale, we come to Alexander of Macedonia. In the traditional history it is recounted that a new force gradually ripened in the north of Greece - the Macedonian Empire. With King Phillip II (359 - 336 B.C.) it achieved power that had been unknown earlier. Athens headed a battle with Phillip. But, despite desperate resistance, they suffered defeat. As early as with Alexander's father war starts with the Persians, however, the murder of Phillip in 336 B.C. postponed the realization of the Eastern Crusade for some time. Having come to the throne, Alexander cruelly dealt with the father's killers and possible pretenders to the throne. In the spring of 334 B.C., the Macedonian army and allied Greek detachments ferry to Asia Minor. Alexander's army was considerably inferior numerically to the Persian, but won in a severe battle, and the way to Asia Minor was opened to Alexander. Having finished its conquest, Alexander entered Northern Syria. Here he had once again to meet with Persian forces - this time King Darius III himself stood at their head. The Macedonians succeeded in winning the battle that took place the fall of 333 B.C. near Issa. Later, Alexander captures the Phoenician Coast, where Tyre rendered the most stubborn resistance, but in 332 the city was taken by storm. The capture of Gaza opened the way to Egypt, the satrap of which, not having sufficient forces for resistance, surrendered. During the stay in Egypt, Alexander founded a city in the Nile delta, giving it his own name. He completed a pilgrimage to the oracle of Ammon in the desert, priests of whom declared Alexander as the son of Ammon, having recognized, consequently, his divine parentage. Thus his power over Egypt received a divine basis. In the spring of 331 B.C., Alexander moved to the north. Crossing the Euphrates and the Tigris, he approached the small town of Gaugamela, and here on 1 October 331 B.C. occurred the decisive battle. Although the Persian army was stronger than at Issa, the Macedonians did not succeed this time in routing it. Now Alexander already had been dreaming about worldwide rule. He conquered vast areas along the Indus river, but nevertheless, he did not succeed in completing the Indian campaign. The army, exhausted by the campaign, refused to go further. Alexander turned back with the remnants of his army to Babylon. The king's policy at that time was directed at the unification of his huge state. A broad campaign for the founding of new cities in the conquered territories is put into practice (Alexander viewed them as the strong points of his power.) He also was preparing for new campaigns. However, at the high point of these preparations, Alexander dies in 323 B.C. from a fever at the age of 33. A fine subject, worthy of the pen of a great writer. A whole epic, compressed by us to the dimensions of one page. But, alas, it is not original. The empire of Alexander of Macedonia has too many of the same features as
the Osman (Ottoman) Empire, which was founded in the 15th Century by Mahomet II. He conquered countries just as it is described in the legends about the Macedonian. In a comparison of the maps of the Osman Empire and the Macedonian empire, it is clearly visible that the European and Mediterranean borders of both conquests practically coincide. There are overly curious pages in the medieval writings and manuscripts connected with the Macedonian and Mahomet II. In some Turkish documents of that time, Mahomet II is glorified as Alexander! In others - of European origin - Alexander the Macedonian pays compliments. . . to France. Monks are present with crosses and thuribles during the funerals of the great conqueror. And the Macedonian is buried not anywhere, but in one

of the Egyptian pyramids. From the point of view of the traditional historians, all of this is absolute nonsense. One may add that, in the opinion of the medieval authors, "Orpheus is the contemporary of Aeneas, Sardanapal - the King of Greece, and Julian the Apostate - a Papal chaplain. That is, a multitude of epochs, countries and names is supposedly fully mingled. It is not difficult to understand the contemporary historians when they write that in the Middle Ages "the notion of chronological consistency almost was lost. . . Everything in this world takes on a fantastic coloring. The most coarse anachronisms and the strangest fabrications get along peacefully. The basis for such a conclusion is the same: the medieval evidence does not correspond to the place of Scaliger and Petavius. Well, and since they do not correspond, then, consequently, in the Middle Ages everyone was going crazy together, and hardly had started to write history. And the medieval author Fredegarius Scholasticus even pointed to King Priam (from the legendary Troy! ) as a personage of a previous generation. Scholasticus already had fully lost his bearing in the centuries and the adherents of the traditional chronology are at a loss how to react. As we see, the documents of that time are full of names which supposedly belonged to distant ancestors. This seems absurd and laughable, because today the notion reigns that in the Middle Ages names were distributed that weren't in "antiquity." A mistaken notion. Books, messages, and letters of that time are evidence of it. For example, Georgius Phrantzae in "History" (1258 - 1476 A.D.) names his contemporaries: Antioch, Demetrios, Dionysius, Minos, Cleope and so forth. Nil Sinayskiy in that very same period writes letters to the monks Demosthenes, Apollosius, Aristocles, Aristarchus and the like. An obvious "antiquity"! But it shows only that not only various events, but also the names of their heroes were replicated and referred to in the distant past, according to the historic cycles. (Anatoliy Fomenko, Gleb Nosovskiy "Which Century Is It Now?") In history textbooks it is emphasized that the time of Alexander of Macedonia was noted by many important achievements in Greek literature, science, philosophy and art, and it is connected with the creation of such prominent thinkers of antiquity as, for example, Plato. And generally, then a significant phenomenon sprang up in the history of ancient Greece which was called the Hellenic period. It is acceptable to examine it as the expansion of Greek culture in the countries conquered by the Macedonian.
The 15th century A.D. is in no way distinguished from antiquity in this regard. The fall of Byzantium and Greece and the formation of the Osman empire caused medieval Hellenism which is well known in history and which spread to all Europe. Ferdinando Gregorovius writes: "From the moment of the fall of Hellas, the story of the Greeks is split: one into their enslaved motherland, the other into exile. . . . they came to be resettled in strange countries in masses. The West accepted them hospitably. . . Their religious aristocracy found refuge in the capitals and in the educational institutions of Italy, bringing Greek literature here anew." Everything is correct except the word "anew." There was nothing "anew," everything was for the first time. And that which is ascribed to antiquity is a duplicate of medieval events and personalities. Even Plato is a duplicate. Supposedly it is known of traditional history that "Plato was the greatest representative of the idealistic school in ancient Greek philosophy. He created the Academy - a school of philosophy in which his students were united. The notion of ideas became the basis of Plato's instruction - of the eternal and unchanging image patterns of things, the weak reflections of which are the subjects of the real world." (Encyclopedia) It is thought that his instruction died in order to be reborn several hundred years later reappears in the famous Plotinus (205 - 270 A.D.) His name, it is clear, is absolutely accidental, and practically identical to Plato's name. Then Platonicism again for some reason dies, in order to be reborn in the 15th century in the teaching . . of Pleton! He also is almost Plato and also a famous philosopher, writer and public figure.

For fullness of the picture, let us say that Plato's ideas appear out of
nowhere for the first time from in the 15th century, at the high point of Pleton's activity, and that Pleton organizes in Italy, in Florence, the Pleton Academy - an exact analogue of the Platonist Academy. And the fact is of interest that Pleton writes "Utopia," as did Plato, and also "A Treatise on Laws," following in everything his own "ancient" predecessor, the author of the treatise "Laws." At the same time, the Pleton
of the 15th century as too the ancient Plato, promotes the idea of an ideal state. The traditional historians know all this well. All the examples cited by us have been taken from their works. It would seem the conclusions suggest themselves: the ancient Plato is the duplicate of the medieval Pleton! But no, it is impossible to violate Scaliger's chronology, and therefore, Plotinus and Pleton are declared neoplatonists, that is, followers of Plato.
The development of art in the 4th century A.D. reflects the new phenomena of Greek society, it is said in the solid works devoted to antiquity. Greek sculpture knows many prominent masters (Scopas, Leochares, Bryaxis, Praxiteles, Lysippus.) Their works supposedly have been found with various excavations, often just "by accident." Travelers bring them to museums and merchants sell them, who, heaven knows by which routes, have obtained the "antique" from some kind of unknown secondhand dealer. But here is the trouble: from time to time it turns out that one or the other work is counterfeit. From century to century skilled craftsmen are discovered who work "like the old days" in order to earn their daily living. A great deal of books have been written about the counterfeit industry, no less fascinating than the detective stories of famous writers. At that, they tell only about those cases when falsifications have been discovered. And how many have not been discovered! . . Here are only several subjects. We already have talked about the origin of a series of "ancient" sculptures. Even the great Michelangelo sinned with counterfeits in his youth. He created a figurine of Cupid and at the suggestion of a friend sold it as an antique original. The forgery presently was uncovered, but the sculptor was already well known: they thought that he was able to "ascend to the mastery of the ancient sculptors." The famous Benvenuto Cellini told in his own autobiography how he created vases which were declared as antique: "By this little job I obtained much." There were sculptors who even specialized in this source of counterfeits. One of them was so successful that he merited the nickname Antico. Israel Rouchomovsky was famous in the 19th century, the author of a whole series of "antiques." The Louvre bought the "tiara of Saitapharnes" from him for 200,000 francs as an original of 3rd century B.C. Grecian art. Only later did it become clear that the figures on the tiara were copied from pictures out of an atlas of cultural history published in 1882. They were made so skillfully that they didn't believe Rouchomovsky when he announced his authorship of the tiara. Then he produced a series of "antiques" of his own productions and the museum gave in. They called Alceo Dessena the king of antique forgeries. He had a special workshop which flooded the worldwide market with counterfeit antiquities: "Athenian" statues, sculptures "a la Gothic," and statuettes "three thousand years old." Afterward Dossena exposed himself. The fact is that he, as did Rouchomovsky, had been using the services of a firm for marketing in "antiquities" and became dissatisfied that they paid him so little. And he decided to take revenge. But they didn't believe him! Then, in 1927, he shot a film about how he made an "antique" statue of a goddess. Only here did he convince everyone. In 1937, a certain Honon, while plowing a field not far from Brizet, found a marble statue of Venus. Specialists unanimously proclaimed it a work of the first century B.C. Honon received 250,000 francs for a "creation of Praxiteles or Phidias." But in 1938, the sculptor Francesco Cremonese, declared that he had hidden a statue of his own execution in the field. And he

proved this. And he had completed the forgery in order to show to everyone of what he was capable as a sculptor. Though, as regards "ancient" sculptures and other works of "antiquity," one can manage even without these examples. It is enough just to glance into the textbooks and study aids for specialists who talk about the properties of natural stones. Here is what is said about marble: "A stone, like metals, subject to corrosion. The stone's corrosion appears in the form of peeling, splitting, swelling and a loosening of the rock, the appearance of cracks, splotchiness, cavities and scabbings, discoloration or coloration of the stone's surface in dark tones, the appearance of brown and greenish spots of organic origin. Among damages of the surface layer one also can pick out a sugary and scaly disintegration of the stone. The sugary disintegration of marble is caused by the uneven disintegration of the surface layer. At the same time, the rough surface of the stone resembles the texture of sugar. . . . It is necessary to note that the Italian, Greek, and Turkish classifications of the stone do not use the term "marbleized limestone." An overwhelming quantity of limestone is called marble. The durability of limestone is 120 years. The durability of real marble is up to 300 years! It is worth scrutinizing marble sculptures which are displayed in museums as authentic works of two millennia ago and right away it will become clear when they were made. And, finally, about archaeological monuments. For the start, let's say that the first catalogue of inscriptions and local names of monuments in Athens
was established just in the middle of the 15th century. But the fateful lot of a majority of originals befell it: the catalog was lost! If one doesn't know that in particular the traces of the subsequent forgeries were wiped out, then one may think that the evil fate from the Greek myths had risen in earnest in the Middle Ages. Contemporary specialists are acquainted only with the mention of the catalog in the works of later authors. Ferdinand Gregorovius notes, "over the course of time, the original name of the majority of ancient Athenian monuments, from which in many cases only individual ruins remained, was forgotten." One can understand the historian's assertion. According to his ideas, the monuments had to be named as it said in the "ancient" writings. And living people were calling them otherwise! That means, they had forgotten the original names. Ferdinand Gregorovius does not offer other variants. That they named the monument themselves is, in the opinion of the traditional historians, absurd. They considered the remnants of the Olympion in those days as a basilica, "since no one knew that it is the ruins of the once world renowned temple of Olympus." Ciriacus (the compiler of the first catalog) calls these tremendous ruins. . . Adrian's palace, as the Athenians themselves called it. . . In 1678, Babin didn't know where the temple of Zeus was in Athens. . . the Academy, Lyceum, Stoa and gardens of Epicurus had disappeared without a trace. In the times of Ciriacus, they called some kind of a group of basilicas the Academy, the location of which it is impossible to determine. . . They located the Lyceum or Aristotle's didascalion in the ruins of the theatre of Dionysus. . . Ciriacus copied the Greek inscription here, not mentioning the great philosopher. . . The ruins near Callirhoe turned out to be the remnants of Aristophanes' stage. The traditional historiography, thus, supposes that not only the authors of the medieval writings, but also simply the residents of Athens were great muddle-headed persons and dreamers. The whole world knew the Olympic temple, but they didn't even guess that it was located in their home town. And they didn't have the slightest idea where the Academy and the gardens of Epicurean were located. Moreover, they considered the great comedian Aristophanes almost as their own contemporary. As too many other figures of "antiquity." There were not dreamers. They were guided by personal recollection and real knowledge, and what the creators of "antiquity," who were in no way satisfied with the Ciriacus catalog, write later about Athens.

As sad as it is to part with the usual ideas mastered while still in school about Ancient Greece, one need recognize that it is only a reflection of medieval Greece. Not always precise, often even warped, but only a reflection.

CHAPTER NINETEEN MANKIND'S DISPLACED MEMORY
For some centuries already researchers have been trying to understand and explain the nature of anti-Semitism. It has spread everywhere. Its manifestations are found even in those countries such asKorea or Mongolia, where the Jews never were in the past. Everywhere the words "Hebrew" or "Jew" evoke vigilance, anxious alarm, and the expectation of something bad. They resound as a danger signal. These feelings more often than not have no relation to specific Jews. It is impossible to count how many mixed marriages have been performed, are being performed and will be performed in all the countries where Jews live. The count comes to many hundreds of thousands in the United States and Russia. It is not by chance that the U.S. Jewish community declines from decade to decade - not owing to emigration to Israel or an increase of the death rate, but only because children in mixed families stop considering themselves Jews. And nonetheless, their non-Jewish relatives behave on the whole negatively toward Judaism. It is perceived as an abstract Evil, as a sinister fate, which hangs permanently over mankind. Such a relationship influences even Jews themselves. Jewish antiSemitism is wide spread among a significant part of them. At the everyday level, it is manifested in the fact that one or the other man considers himself a true Jew, and those compatriots whom he hates, are degenerates: "They disgrace us, the real Jews." A great deal of the works of the anti-Semitic sense have been written by Jewish authors who attempt to distance themselves from those who as before consider themselves representatives of this people. State and public figures, businessmen, artists and painters who have, besides others, Jewish roots too, as a rule, conceal the fact. Jews, who have converted to Christianity or in general have rejected any kind of religion, often are the most consistent antiSemites. The brightest examples are the inquisitor Torquemad and the atheist Karl Marx. The prominent 19th century researcher Daniil Khvolson considered that in a century "nearly 150 Jews who converted to Christianity published essays that were hostile with respect to Jews. . . five or six of them were filled with phantasmagoria about ritual murders. (Daniil Avraamovich Khvolson. On Some Medieval Accusations against Jews. A Historical Investigation according to Sources. - St. Petersburg, 1880, pages 279-280).
The prevalence of anti-Semitism and its influence on people stumps researchers. Prominent men of letters, historians, philosophers and even businessmen (Henry Ford) have taken up this topic. They have held to various views of Jewry, often diametrically opposed, about which we were speaking in the beginning of the book. They have brought in as evidence whole libraries of works. Nevertheless, the problem has not been made clear so far. Many contemporary scientists trace the reasons for anti-Semitism to xenophobia. Indeed, xenophobia, which means in translation from the Greek "fear of foreigners," underlies all nationalistic views. As has been



2022. 03. 17. 16:27 antisemitism
web.archive.org/web/20200221115951/http://www.revisedhistory.org/antisemitism.htm 2/15
discovered, it is even a principle of animal psychology, which gave birth to natural selection. In the animal world the outsider, as a rule, brings danger. Therefore, our smaller brothers will not accept outsiders. And, in the opinion of psychologists, primitive man inherited this phobia, transferring the notion of "outsider" to unknown tribes. In primitive society "we" is always "people" in the direct meaning of the world. Whereas "they" are not quite people. A further transformation of this formula: "they are not quite people" is the corner stone of racist doctrine, a negative reaction to everything that originates from another nation. "Nationalism starts there where the consciousness of our own individuality changes into a hostile psychological purpose which increases the feeling of fear, hatred and intolerance. They ascribe aggressiveness, ill-will and a whole spectrum of negative antihumanistic features to the other people. Their own on the other hand - they endow with all possible virtues that serve as a psychological justification of the negative relationship to strangers (V. Iliushenko) However, all of this concerns nationalism and xenophobia on the whole. As regards anti-Semitism, then its broadest prevalence testifies to additional roots, which define its uniqueness as a social phenomenon. We see these roots most of all in the existence in the Middle Ages of a worldwide empire of monotheists. When the adherents of Judaism, Semites from the Middle East, changed into a predominant priestly caste in the worldwide Catholic-Judaic empire (they called themselves Catholics!) when they took to introducing monotheism there and everywhere by force of arms, when, finally, in its name they began to remove from people the last property to the treasury of the emperor, then did hatred for the Jews flare up as a bright flame, leaving the deepest footprint on the historical memory. This hatred raged especially frantically after the empire collapsed and nothing protected the "Jew-foreigners" any longer. Competition extremely intensified the situation on the part of the Christian trade and financial capital that was again coming into being. And as expected by the new participants of the struggle for supremacy in the trade and financial markets, they established as their goal the weakening, and still better - the extermination of the Jewish competitors, who no longer were supported by the military power of the former empire. A colossal public relations smear campaign of the caste of duty and tax collectors was created for these purposes. The newcomers must be given their due: they brilliantly used the chronic hatred of the tax-payers. When they were unable to beat the competitors with smarter transactions, the new masters of the finances and markets elevated the people to the fight under slogans of extermination of those who believed otherwise, the damned murderers of Jesus Christ, the enemies of mankind, the devils incarnate. And then, sometimes in one country and sometimes in another, the pogroms rolled and the fires of auto-da-fe blazed. Often, when one really wanted to rob the Jews, the monarchs didn't bother themselves with slogans and appeals. Daniil Khvolson cites such a fact: "The German emperor of the time, Albrecht, in the capacity of, as he said, the heir of the emperors Vespasian, Titus and Charlemagne, declared claims to the supreme truths over the French Jews. Consequently, the King (Phillippe IV "The Fair") suddenly detained all the Jews of France, men and women, old people and children, for one day, took from them all personal assets and real estate, confiscated for his own use all their debts to Christians and, leaving them only the shirt on their backs, banished 100,000 people from the country, having made them beggars. "Here are your Jews! " - he mockingly said then to the German emperor. " Daniil Khvolson does not mention the paradoxical, at first glance, situation: the king considers the claims of the German emperor on the French Jews are normal. One would think, for what reason can one state manifest its laws on the citizens of another country? It can be only in the case if it is a question of people who have a supranational status that everyone recognizes. Calling himself the heir of the emperors Vespasian,

Titus and Charlemagne, Albrecht was speaking, per se, about the legacy of the empire of monotheists. In "A History of Anti-Semitism," Leon Poliakov also cites data which is evidence of the purely material justification for the persecution of the Jews:
"The connection between the struggle for the purity of the truth and the class or caste interests is especially keenly observed in Castile, where from
the end of the 13th century (according to the Scaliger chronology - author's note) ) the strengthening bourgeoisie received their own representation in the chapter, and also the right to send their own delegates to parliament (Cortes) and to approve taxes." They themselves didn't keep the pogroms waiting. The arising bourgeoisie elevated the rabble against the Jews. The slogans are curious under which the crowds threatened those who believed otherwise: "In Barcelona the crowd cried: the rich want to destroy the common people!" That is, it was a question not of those who believe otherwise and other nationalities, but of coin purses. In many works devoted to anti-Semitism, a list of Jewish pogroms and persecutions is cited which were committed in various centuries. Here are some lines from this list: . . . 1290 - The expulsion of the Jews from England. 1391 - The pogrom in Seville (Spain). 30,000 people killed. 1394 - The expulsion of the Jews from France. 1492 - Hundreds of thousands of Jews expelled from Spain. . . (M. Chernov "Suicide," "Continent USA," 2003)
We propose that these events need to be dated as the second half of the
15th century, with a time interval of 30 - 40 years. On 2 January 1492, Their Catholic Majesties Ferdinand and Isabella ceremoniously entered Granada. On 31 March of that very same year, they signed an edict about the banishment of the Jews from Spain: ". . . We have received information from the inquisitors and from other persons that contact of Jews with Christians is leading to the worst of consequences. . As a result, our sacred Catholic faith has been humbled and dishonored. Thus, we have come to the conclusion that the only effective means to put an end to these misfortunes consists of the final severance of all contacts between Jews and Christians, and this can be achieved only by the expulsion of the Jews from our kingdom" Leon Poliakov) Events in neighboring Portugal developed somewhat differently. Expulsion would have represented an immediate catastrophe for the small country's economy. Forced Baptism was the only solution, which was compatible with Portugal's political ambitions. At Easter 1497, events began to unfold at an accelerated rate. They took the children from their parents and carried them to Baptismal fonts. Those of the parents who did not follow their children voluntarily were taken there by force several weeks later. "A blasphemous farce, caused by the lowest and vilest of material
motives" - such was the verdict in the 20th century of Menendez y Pelayo. The "Jewish Encyclopedia" cites the following numbers: from England in the 13th century 16,000 Jews were expelled, from France in the
14th century 100,000, and from Spain in the 15th century - 200,000 people. Over time, the persecution of the Jews took on a mystical nature. As their role was forgotten in an empire that had passed into non-existence, the existence itself of this group of people began to be perceived as evidence of Satan's schemes. They had become the embodiment of the dark forces, the conductors of Evil in this world. And they were idolized in their own way, they both observed customs which were not the customs of their own people and they prepared something like their own nourishment. But chiefly, the world's gold literally stuck to their hands. It is not unlike the Devil protected them. This accusation was especially popular in the decades when the plague and cholera epidemics savaged Europe. As evidence of the connections of the Jews with Satan was the fact that in the years of the "Black Death" fewer of the "Devil incarnate" died than Christians. Now we understand that the



2022. 03. 17. 16:27 antisemitism

isolated life in the ghetto and the observance of special purification rituals adopted in Judaism saved quite a few lives. But at that time they saw in this the hand "of a human sort of enemy." They were blamed that they, being protected by the Devil, were attempting to annihilate the Christians and wrongly treated the sick, set deprivation upon them with witchcraft and even poisoned the wells. In Chillon a certain Jew under torture "confessed," that some of his like believers in the south of France conspired and prepared poison from spiders, frogs, lizards, human flesh, Christian hearts and impure hosts. They distributed the powder made from this mixture among the communities so as to scatter it into the wells from which the Christians drew water for drinking. This supposedly also caused the terrible epidemic around all of Europe. And most often, accusations were repeated of the kidnapping of Christian infants and their ritual murder. However, not everything is understood with these accusations. Traditional
historians with some surprise noted that before the 12th century, Christian society not once made similar accusations concerning the Jews. There are some reports about murders committed for magical and bewitching purposes, but Jews do not figure in them, but heathens. Reflecting on this fact, the historians assume that "Obviously, the influence of the horrors which were enkindled by the crusades was decisive." It turns out that before the crusades, they were speaking about the bloody customs of the Jews nevertheless, but quietly, and so the crusades for the liberation of the Holy sepulcher added fuel to the fire. How so? It is enough to read the records of one of the participants of the crusade, Robert de Clari, which have been preserved to our time, in order to see what goals the crusaders had set for themselves. They thought about money and plunder, but not about the Holy Sepulcher. And even in general their goal was "slaughter the Saracens," and not "save the Sepulcher." There is not a single word about Jesus or the cross or about the Holy Sepulcher! (Edgar Holmes McNeal The Conquest of Constantinople of Robert of Clari. New York, 1936) Robert de Clari also didn't mention a word about the Jews - "Christ's killers." In our opinion, they did not accuse the Jews of ritual killings for the
reason that the Israelites, that is the followers of monotheism, were everyone in that period. Above all they are the ruling elite of the empire! And only then when the empire collapsed, was all that mud, which previously had fallen onto the polytheists, slung onto the Jews. The dubious honor of the birth of blood libel belongs to England. According to the traditional chronology, at the start of the 12th century here, in Norwich, the first matter of a similar accusation was investigated. The body of a young apprentice, William, subsequently recognized as a saint, was discovered the day before Good Friday in a forest. The first accusation and first murder of a Jew. A broken-down debtor knight of the dead boy cut him down. "An accidental coincidence," write the traditional historians. Hugo of Lincoln in England, supposedly crucified by Jews in 1255, even became the hero of folk ballads. There was also such a variant of the accusations: In the Temple of Jerusalem supposedly they worshipped the head of a donkey (according to another variant - of a pig) and once a year they sacrificed a captured and well fed Greek. Why in particular a well-fed, and not a skinny Greek, history conceals. If one is to believe the modern Russian anti-Semite Oleg Platonov, then in the Kievan caves are preserved to this day relics of Saint Evstratius, "who was crucified on a cross by Jews on Good Friday in a rite of slandering Jesus Christ in 1096" (Oleg Platonov, Russia's Crown of Thorns. A Secret of Lawlessness. Judaism and Freemasonry versus Christian Civilization. Moscow, 1998, page 109)
In many cases they availed themselves of the accusations of ritual murders soberly and prudently. S. Resnick, who has researched the history of blood libel in detail, writes:

"The schemes were well developed. An ordinary Christian child crucified or killed by other means excites the crowd and causes a pogrom during which . . the Christians succeed in making a good profit. Later the authorities intervene. They calm down the crowd. . . and impose an indemnity on the Jewish community. When little of this is found, they expel the Jews, having robbed them blind. A simple and reliable method to supplement the emptied treasury of a landlord, monastery or kingdom. Tales of man-eating Jews who kidnapped youths, in order to revel in Christian blood in the secret ceremonies of their "Basurman" religion, were part of the consciousness of the peoples of Europe. Rumor ascribed to the Jews special diseases and properties from which they were able to be saved only with the help of Christian blood. According to these legends, Jewish women in childbirth were not able to be delivered without the help of Christian blood; their children were born blind, and in order to regain their sight, they also supposedly required Christian blood. It too was needed for the marriage ceremony and for the rite which was performed over a dying Jew; in order that wild boar's tusks and ears didn't grow in them; even to stop menstruation in Jewish men, which supposedly was peculiar to them the same as even to women. And, but of course, the most wide-spread rumor was repeated over and over again about the unleavened Passover bread, into which the Jews supposedly mix Christian blood. (S. Resnick. "Blood Libel in Russia," Washington, 1999)
But even this, in our view, does not fully clarify the reasons and incurability of anti-Semitism. The history of mankind knows quite a number of wars in which the enemies committed inconceivable atrocities in relation to each other. Nonetheless, in the historical memory of peoples, who at some time have suffered huge losses during battles and in years of lawlessness, there is no chronic hatred. No one takes revenge on the heirs of former enemies, experiences jealousy and alarm, and having seen them, calls on fellow citizens for the destruction of the "strangers." Only the Jews alone are favored with such an honor. Modern psychoanalysis gives a persuasive explanation for this phenomenon. It has revealed that human consciousness breaks up and replaces unpleasant memories. Here is a typical syndrome described in psychiatric textbooks. A father, overall an easy-tempered man, while drinking whiskey, lit a cigar and treated his son roughly and cruelly. When the son had grown, and his father has died, the son with trepidation began to react to his memory, in many respects exaggerating the father's actions. The unpleasant memories have been crushed completely and sincerely. However, with the smell of cigar smoke asthmatic spasms and the on-set of asphyxia started in him. Treatment with medicines has not helped, and then the psychiatrists, while doing a checkup, ascertain that in the son's consciousness the memories of the real father were split: the "good" father was idealized, and the "bad" replaced and displaced into the subconscious. And it reacted to cigar smoke. A further development of this scientific course which is called neofreudism, has led to the discovery that something similar happens with social memory.
One can fully seriously contend that memories of the real empire of the Israelites, in many respects cruel and ruthless, have been split in the consciousness of European society into a good hundred idealized stories and one displaced memory. Among the versions, according to the reasons for the events of those years, our historical memory has brought into the world the "ancient Roman," "Byzantine," "ancient Greek," "ancient Jewish," "ancient Russian," "Mongolian," "ancient Chinese" and some other histories. In which connection, as already was shown, they are idealized, that is, they are distinguished by the brilliant heroism of the participants of the events, by their nobility, by the pure feelings, by fearlessness in the struggle for justice and the like. Chroniclers and historians have called and call the ancient times the "Golden Age," when both people were supposedly better and life considerably more interesting. The very role of the "cigar" in the public memory has fallen to Judaism.

Taking after Freud, S. Resnick emphasizes that the legend of the "use of Christian blood" is nothing other than the transfer to the Jews of an antiSemite's own secret longings. "Christianity has condemned human sacrifice as a terrible sin, but the atavistic inclination for orgies of blood has not disappeared. It has been suppressed, displaced into the subconscious. And afterwards it was carried over to the Jews. . ." (S. Resnick, The Seduction of Hatred. Blood Libel in Russia. Daat/Znanie Publishers, Moscow-Jerusalem, 2001)
Thus, at the root of anti-Semitism, in our view, lies the displaced memory of mankind about the cruel and bloody features of the first empire of monotheists. The facts connected with the cardinal question: when did Anti-Semitism arise? testify, in particular, to the validity of our approach to this phenomenon. Indeed, did it exist until the Middle Ages? The author of the well-known work, "A History of Anti-Semitism," Leon Poliakov, thinks that antiSemitism arose in the Hellenistic era, and is dated by the period of Alexander the Great's campaigns to the 30s of our era. The first manifestations of antiJewish sentiments are observed, in his opinion, in the city of Alexandria. V. Iliushenko, an Orthodox historian, author of numerous articles about the mutual relations of Christianity and Judaism, holds another view: "Anti-Semitism existed before Christianity. It has a pagan origin. And it is connected with the fact that Judaism, which the Jews professed, is a monotheistic religion, it opposed the pagan polytheism in a natural way. The facts of Jewish pogroms were well known as early as the first century B.C. in Alexandria." As we see, the opinions agree on one thing: the first pogroms supposedly took place in ancient Alexandria. The assertion of V. Iliushenko, irreproachable in its logic, is cheapened by the reference to this Egyptian city. And here is why. That which are the "facts of the Jewish pogroms were well known as early as the first century B.C.," is based on documents composed in the Middle Ages, as demonstrated by the adherents of the new chronology. Not a single original of these documents has been preserved. Their appearance itself testifies to massive forgeries: they only appeared when the monarchs, bishops or noble grandees ordered them. Thus it happened, for example, with the speeches and letters of Cicero, which no one knew before the Middle Ages. And, you see, in them are very sharp anti-Semitic expressions which are used to this day: "You know, Laelius, what kind of a gang this is, how they hold together, what influence they exert on the meetings. Therefore, I will speak in a low voice in order that only the judges can hear me, because many people will be found who are ready to set this crowd on me and on every respectable man, and we don't want to make this easier. . ." "The Jewish people are spread over the whole earth, scattered among the residents of a multitude of countries." "There is neither one city of the Hellenes and not one of the barbarian people where our custom of celebration of the Sabbath, fasting and lighting of candles would not have penetrated," writes Josephus Flavius supposedly at the start of the new era. Meanwhile, as the adherents of the new chronology have shown, there is evidence of the fact that his compositions were written after the sailing of Christopher Columbus. Max Weber is categorical: "The universal propagation of 'anti-Semitism' in antiquity is a fact." Theodor Mommsen maintains: "From Horace's slight mockeries of the obsessive Jews from the Roman ghetto it was a huge step to the absolute hatred of Tacitus for these fiends of a humankind, for whom everything clean is unclean, and all that is unclean is clean. . ." ("Roman History," volume V) The hatred of Tacitus is not the least classical. Tacitus himself appeared at that time when it had become necessary to have an ancient history of an
arising Germany. So then, in the 15th century, the Roman Pope, Leo X
(really the 10th? ) publishes Tacticus's "Germany," which there and then

becomes the foundation of German history which was unknown to anyone before that. As early as 1425, the papal secretary, Poggio Bracciolini, a well-known Italian forger of "ancient" works, ordered this production in the German Hershfeld monastery. In 1455, the manuscript was, finally, brought into Italy by a certain Alberto d'Ascoli. The popes did not decide to publish the remake for dozens of years, and when, at last, they did decide, they immediately destroyed the original of the manuscript. The inquisition after some time makes short work of one of d'Ascoli's descendants. Probably, they were destroying the last traces of the fraud. Up to now, no one has attempted to explain how Tacticus's manuscript came to be in a German monastery, how it was preserved there 1,500 years and why they had not used it all this time. ( Dr. Lucas Brasi, Der groe Schwindel. Bausteine fr eine wahre Geschichte der Antike. 1955)
That which is "ancient anti-Semitism" is in fact a tracing of the antiSemitism of a completely different era, and by implication the traditional historians recognize themselves, and even everyone, who for some kind of reasons is involved with this problem. True, they are expressed carefully, using words of the type "surprisingly," "strangely enough," "mysteriously," and the like. But the essence remains the following: "Antiquity in interrelations with the Jews demonstrates to us the features, which sometimes surprisingly are reminiscent of a new time, even the last century or the last decades. . . The principle factors which define even now the situation of "Jewry" already were present in antiquity. So writes Igor Shafarevich, who stands on the side of "moderate" antiSemitism. One of the most surprising peculiarities of the persecutions consists of the fact that they have born, so to speak, a cyclical nature. Periods of persecutions where replaced by an invitation to the Jews to return to the countries from where they were expelled. Characteristic in this regard is England, where a broad discussion of the merits of Judaism and its consequences preceded their return. The preacher and theologian, John Toland, who is called the "first free thinker in the history of the West," in connection with persecutions against the Jews even brought an accusation against the fathers of the church of the distortion of the original Christian teachings ("Nazaicus, a Jewish, Gentile and Mahometan Christianity" (1718): ". . . the true Christianity of the Jews was suppressed as a result of the actions of the much more numerous heathens who did not endure the simplicity and full agreement with the reason of this Jewish Christianity (.. . ) Thanks to that very same heathen tradition, veneration of the saints, prayers for the dead, the worship of icons and other manifestations of Greek and Roman superstitions were introduced, not the least trace of which it is impossible to find anywhere in the Bible. A brave assertion for the start of the 18th century. In the work, "Arguments in Favor of the Naturalization of Jews in Great Britain and Ireland," John Toland assures his readers of the fact that a significant part of them has Jewish blood in their veins, especially this concerns the Scots, "which is the reason for which numerous residents of this part of the island experience a significant aversion to pork and blood pudding, while not speaking of some other easily noticed coincidences." It is funny to read that Jewish blood flows in the veins of Scots. It is much more serious to presume that in the Scots a bias toward pork has remained since the times of the empire of the monotheists! But we are getting into details already.The main thing in the other, in Toland's opinion, is the Jews need to return to England. Why? John Toland, as too many other authors, insists on special Jewish abilities, which were claimed again by yesterday's thugs and murderers. A weak basis. The heirs of the imperial publicans and money-lenders did not possess any kind of special economic and financial talents, without which those driven out of a country, in particular, England, almost perished. There were no such talents, even as there wasn't even a Jewish nation itself. . Then nations generally didn't exist in the modern meaning of this word. People defined themselves according to beliefs. When Jesus Christ said that

"there is neither Greek nor Jew" before the Most High, he didn't have in mind Jews and Greeks as nations, as it is understood now by the popular perception. By Jews in the Gospels they have in mind the followers of the teachings of Moses, that is monotheists, and by Greeks - pantheists, the heathens who recognize polytheism. Not an ethnic, but a religious classification of the population held sway. This tradition has been maintained in many countries to now. In Jewry itself, deeply believing people even up to the present time think Jews only are those who religiously obey the instructions of the Torah. Therefore, a non-believer for them is not a Jew, even if all his forefathers were faithful Jews. But they unconditionally recognize as Jews, for example, native Russian peasants from the Smolensk, Astrakhan and Voronezh areas of Russia who professed Judaism as early as the second century.
Instead of "nation" in the historical sources are met the expressions "Germanic tribes" (for example, the Angles, Saxons, Francs and Goths), the "Slavonic tribes" (the Krivichi, Polieni, Drevliani, and Vyatichi), the "Iberian tribes" (the Picts, Basques, Turdetans, Torduls) and so on. The common word "tribes" here is accompanied by definitions of the "Germanic," "Slavonic," and "Iberian." . . But the are the ideas equivalent that are contained in these definitions to the idea of "nation"? The first edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica (Edinburgh, 1771 )
maintains that the word German meant even as early as the 18th century "half-blooded, a relative by blood," that is of the same tribe. The word german generally still didn't have the meaning "German as nation" at that time. Therefore, "ancient Germans" - is any community of people who adhere to a clan-tribal structure of interrelations which is based on a blood
relationship. Any tribe, for example, Slavonic - the same as Germans, as too Saxons, Sweves and Cimbri. In the Spanish language, for example, the word hermano even today means "brother" and hermana is "sister." Once we have touched upon the etymology of the names of tribes and nations, we shall clarify what "Jew" means. According to the research of Emile Benveniste, a first-rate modern expert in these questions, "Jew," besides "stranger" means the same thing that "Hun" and "Tatar" and "Turk" mean. They express the idea of a "mixed people" in various languages. And today there is the international word hybrid (English hybrid "dissimilar, mixed," Italian ibrido. ) Jews (English Hebrew,-they themselves are Iberian) - this is a mixed population in the ethnic sense of the medieval Mediterranean Sea, according to Father Alexander Men, a "Mediterranean Sea race," and by no means Jews in the modern sense. Nations and peoples were formed only after the fact as states rose on the ruins of the empire. They are the produce of the historical development of recent centuries! And only the Scaliger chronology has allowed transferring to the depths of the centuries the realities of the newest times and to declare peoples as ancient, and others supposedly as young. We all are from the same time. Traditional history, but of course, does not agree with this. It thinks that the formation of peoples went in accordance with a plan that was clearly prescribed in the march of Moses: they left from some kind of region for another region, conquered the aboriginals of that place, organized a state in the new place headed by some ruler, lived through a period of flourishing and. were turned into aboriginals for new conquerors. Thus did the ancient "ethnos" appear and disappear, and circles of human civilization replaced each other, while being elevated according to the Marxist spiral supposedly all the way to the 17th century, when, at last, modern nations were formed by the labors of the humanists. Here is such a plan which was highlighted as early as in the Old Testament, according to which the whole Scaliger chronology was constructed. In it, it would seem, even the history of the Jews is confined. However, how does one explain the fact that they do not disappear? From all the other "most ancient ethnos" some names remain, and Jews as they were, so have they too remained in this world. An inexplicable anomaly. Just as, in

the best case, is "the riddle of the historical process," in the worst are the "intrigues of Satan." But let us return to the questions of just what the secret of the return of the Jews to one or the other country is. It consisted, above all, of their financial and trade connections. No persecutions were able to extirpate the traditions of the former imperial caste, the solidarity of its members, professionals in financial spheres, their mutual aid and support. Their connections ranged to all countries, regardless of borders and distances. They knew that without economic and financial interaction with neighbors not one state can exist, and therefore, sooner or later their experience, skills and their business contacts again will be needed. And when they invited them, they returned to continue their business. It is clear, with a great advantage for themselves. There is no place for unselfishness in business. "The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of a merchant, generally of a man of means. Money is the jealous god of Israel, in the face of which there is not supposed to be any other god." Karl Marx) The Jews were also extremely useful as skilled craftsmen, experienced physicians, musicians, naturalists and even simply a literate people. In the conditions of persecutions they, essentially, trusted only their own and preferred to carry on business mainly with their own. In this is one of the chief reasons for the ineradicability of Judaism, which is connected with the caste's code. Its moral standards, rules of behavior and rituals, language and external attributes have served as infallible guidelines in the recognition of their own.
The Russian historian, Vladimir Soloviev wrote: ". . . besides a passion for money, the Jews also have another peculiarity: the strong unity of all of them in the name of a common faith and a common law. . . Both all Israel, and every family in it. . . they are penetrated to the depths of the soul and to the marrow of the bones with the sense and consciousness of their own national, familial and personal I. . . " (Vladimir Soloviev "The Jews and the Christian Question")
One doesn't pretend it possible to agree with the historian. Everything about which Vladimir Soloviev wrote is inherent not to a nation. There is nowhere in the world a nation, all the members of which equally would be "penetrated with the sense and consciousness of their own national, familial and personal I." A nation is not an army which lives according to military regulations. And the fact that a discipline, comparable with military, was inherent to the Jews in many ways serves as another proof of its caste roots. One may compare it with the nobility in the era of the medieval flowering of this class. To be a noble by blood or by the grace of a king was considered the highest honor, although it also applied extremely tough limitations on behavior and dictated everything, right up to the point of how to dress, how to travel (only on horse!) and how to treat the common people, who deserved only arrogant and scornful treatment. It is enough to read a number of places in the Talmud in order to feel a truly nobleman's attitude of the Jews to those who believe otherwise. Haughtiness and contempt for the "Goyem" are in excess there. The founding fathers of the modern state of Israel have felt perfectly the cliquishness of the Jews. One of them has talked about the fact that he dreams of a time when their own criminals, prostitutes and prisons will be in Israel. And then it will be a normal state, the same as all the rest. In other words, not a caste. The dreams of the founding fathers have been realized in full. Israel exists, and the Jewish people live there. And it has prisons, prostitutes, drug addicts and gays. As all people have. The times of the caste and its global role in the world have ended. The main reasons for the formation of this people, in our view, was the colossal external pressure on the Jews and the caste discipline in their midst. This process was concluded by the creation of the state of Israel. The role of anti-Semitism in the unity of the Jews more than once has been underscored by the founders and ideologists of Zionism. Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, wrote in his diary: "Anti-Semites will be our most reliable friends, and anti-Semitic countries - our allies"

(Patai, 1960, volume 1, page 84).
Dr. Arthur Ruppin thought: "Although it is impossible to maintain that anti-Semitism alone contributed to the rise of Zionism, but at least in Western Europe anti-Semitism is the strongest agitator for Zionistic affairs. Anti-Semitism, having perished, would have carried even Zionism behind it to the grave" ("Jews of the Present" Jewish Publishing House, Cologne, 1911, page 278).
Dr. Leo Wertheimer wrote in his book published in 1918, "Anti-Semitism and the Jews": "Anti-Semitism is the savior angel of the Jews, it takes care that the Jews remain Jews... Anti-Semites have aroused the Jewish consciousness in many Jews who didn't want to have it" (Quotation from the book: "Dr. Franz Sheidl. "Israel - Dream and Reality" Vienna, 1962, page 18).
Noam Goldman said in his welcoming speech at the Worldwide Jewish Congress on 23 July 1958 in Geneva: "When anti-Semitism in its classical form disappeared, this improved the material and political position of Jewish communities throughout the whole world, but it also rendered a negative influence on our inner life. . . Our people know how to fight heroically in bad times, buy still have not learned to live constructively in good times" (New York Times, 24 July 1958.)
Professor Jeshua Goldman declared at the 26th conference of the Worldwide Zionist Organization in Israel on 30 December 1964: "The greatest danger for the Jews and Jewish unity is the absence of antiSemitism" (Franz Sheidl, op.cit., page 18).
All these pronouncements are used by anti-Semites for evidence of the artificiality, even the illegitimacy of the appearance of the Jewish nation and its state. But with the closest examination, it turns out that all states and the overwhelming majority of peoples of the world have gone through stages of violent, and this means, artificial unification! In the relatively distant past these are the English, French, Spanish and Italians who have lived through severe unifying wars. In more recent times-Russia, Germany and China. All states and nations of North and South America were formed by no means in a natural course. . But let us return to the Jews. One of the most popular legends about Jews is connected with their supposed attempt to predominate in the world. All anti-Semitism, in essence, is supported by this. There is no special need to enumerate in detail the works on this subject: It is enough to recall "The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion," the reference book for anti-Semites of all countries. It already had been shown long ago that it is a forgery, created for the basis of persecutions of the Jews. Its authors have been revealed, the sources analyzed scrupulously that were used by the compilers of the "Protocols," and all the absurdities and stupidities made by them have been pointed out. However, nothing is injurious to the book's popularity. It responds to the unconscious feeling of jealousy and alarm that people experience, having heard the word "Jew." As regards the predominance of Jews in the world, that, in our opinion, the anti-Semites are somewhat right, while not knowing it, obviously, themselves. The descendants of the monotheist Jews really do rule the world. But only it isn't those who live in Israel. It is a question of the royal, tsarist, princely and similar dynasties, both in Europe and in Asia and North Africa. It is common knowledge that they are connected with each other by old kindred ties and that many of them are proud of their legendary origin from the family of King David and his distant descendant Jesus Christ. In particular, as we already have said, the memory has been maintained in such a mythological form of the affiliation of their ancestors to the ruling elite of the empire of the Israelites. However paradoxical it is, in relation to other peoples the Jews fulfill that very same function that anti-Semitism is in relation to the Jews. The political scientist Alexander Verkhovsky spoke about this very precisely, in our view, in a recent lecture at the University of Sussex (2003), which was devoted to nationalism:

"An enemy is the most necessary part of any nationalistic concept, but a defined hierarchy of enemies is better. In this sense, it is simpler for orthodox nationalists since the main Enemy was known in advance - it is the Anti-Christ. And there is a rich tradition of describing the enemies subordinate to it - the Jews, Catholics, etc. It is fine if the enemy is invisible and ubiquitous. Then the human imagination will fill out its form with such horrific details that no additional propaganda will be needed. People will be flocking together, ready for everything for the sake of its annihilation. And then not even is an open appeal enough, but a hint at the fact that those who believe otherwise are to blame for everything, so that the throngs under common, most often national, banners rush to annihilate them, believing that as a result a heavenly life will ensue. As the researchers of various countries note, in the later Middle Ages, the European question fell into the context of the concept of progress. This concept became a secular reflection of religious concepts of a coming Heavenly Kingdom on Earth. The inquisitive minds of Europe developed various plans of social order which could put an end to injustice, oppression, poverty and the lawlessness of people. They believed that it is possible to transform the world according to a thoroughly considered plan. The main thing is to provide for and count everything. It was Utopia. Usually, when they speak about Utopia, they have in mind socialistic ideals. However, an absolute monarchy became the first such Utopia. The works of prominent philosophers and the statesmen of that time are well known, in which exceptional value and the need for the power of an absolute monarch was proven for society's progress (Niccolo Machiavelli. 1469-1527. "The Prince). For the Jews, the remains of the caste of the old empire, there was no place, naturally, in this Utopia. And persecutions of them intensified repeatedly. Then the Utopism of the nation arrived to replace the Utopian monarchy. It was especially popular in the 18-19th centuries (William Pitt the Elder (1708-1778), when modern nations and countries were being formed. Its main distinguishing feature became the assertion that the state should be mononational. A rapid and quite often violent abrasion of differences between peoples inhabiting the British Isles, between Swabians and Prussians in Germany and Ukrainians, Byelorussians and Russian in Russia proceeded. . . And here again they were imposed on the Jews, who did not wish to be joined into the nation-building process.
National Utopism began to exhaust itself toward the middle of the 19th century. It had become clear that the creation of nations does not solve the most acute social problems. And then social Utopia appeared in the first plan - to build a society of justice, where all are equal, outside of the dependence on nationality. Karl Marx and Frederick Engels.) It brought mankind the greatest losses and sufferings, inasmuch as one can create such a society only while destroying enormous masses of people who do not correspond to the criteria of the new teachings. It is enough to recall if nothing else the October Revolution of 1917 in Russia, where they shot hundreds of thousands of citizens only because they thought not as the Bolsheviks prescribed. For the seven decades of the existence of the Soviet Union the number of those repressed there numbered in the millions. The mass repressions didn't cease
for even a year in all the countries that entered toward the middle of the 20th century into the "world of socialism." It was possible to compel the people to live according to the contrived programs exclusively by force. Jews played the most active role in attempts to realize the social Utopia everywhere. And this generously fed anti-Semitism. The American author, Douglas Reed, in the book "The Controversy of Zion" wrote that the "primitive tribes from the distant interiors of Africa," against whom "national animosity was so strong that to assuage it turned out to be impossible" led the revolution of 1917 in Russia. Thus did Douglas Reed explain and justify that during the civil war in Russia both the Whites, followers of the overthrown tsar, and the Reds, the Bolsheviks, destroyed Jewish townships.

Many researchers see a reason for the revolutionary sentiments of the Jews in the fact that Jewish communities in Eastern Europe were in distress. Douglas Reed thought that the Jews themselves were to blame for their poverty. In his opinion, they violently resisted any attempts to improve their situation, maintaining it "for reasons of the arrangement of revolutions and world wars." ("The Controversy of Zion") Later it became clear that it is impossible here, on Earth, to create a kingdom of universal happiness. Something or someone will interfere. Some kind of enemies will upset the apple cart. And then a new anti-Semitism evolved, which accuses the Jews of the collapse of the worldwide Communist experiment. The Italian writer Umberto Eco, as too other authors, distinguishes religious, popular and "intellectual" anti-Semitism. He writes: Religious anti-Semitism, undoubtedly, bore the responsibility for popular: after all, the fact that the Jews were the people who killed God, justified the pogroms. . . But underneath "intellectual" anti-Semitism I have in mind a theory, which is based on historical and anthropological arguments, which is set in the superiority of the Aryan race over the Jewish, and the political doctrine of the Jewish conspiracy for the conquest of the Christian world, which most fully is presented in the 'Protocols of the Zionist Wise Men.' It is also a product of the European secular 'intelligentsia.'" "Intellectual" anti-Semitism, in his opinion, is born at the end of the 18th - start of the 19th centuries in Italy and France. In particular in France, by an irony of fate, the old seat of Catharism, with which the Judaic first inquisition struggled, they get the development of a theory of racism or ethnic roots of civilization, the theory of a Jewish conspiracy is developed which is responsible from the start for the mistakes of the French revolution, and afterwards for intrigues for the purpose of subjugating the Christian world. Racist theories also bloomed like a magnificent flower in the Russia of
the 19th - start of the 20th century. The Russian predecessors of the German Nazis wrote: "It is necessary to understand that racial characteristics have delimited the Jewish people so greatly from all of mankind that they have made of them completely special creatures who cannot be part of our notion of human nature. We can examine them as we examine and study animals, we can feel aversion and dislike toward them, as we feel toward a hyena, toward a jackal or spider. . . ". Alexander Arkadievich Stolypin. "New Times," 1911, 5 October.)
Another publicist, he himself a clergyman, Pavel Florenskiy thought that equality of peoples was thought up by the Jews in order to "take advantage of us." Altogether they wrote that all religions are a vestige, for the purpose of "taking from us our strength - our trust. . . they taught us 'autonomous' morals in order to take away existing morality and instead to give us vulgarity. . . The weighty grain is for them, and the chaff is for us, the 'cattle,' in their view." (Efim Kurganov. Pavel Florenskiy and the Jews. "Russkiy Evrey," 1999, Volume 2 (11), pages 22-24).
It further turns out that now there is not one people in the world that is completely free of Jewish blood. Every people with every year increases the percentage of Jewish blood, that is it is rarefied in their own distinctive character. . "The percentage of Jewish blood in all peoples will be so significant, that this blood finally will drown out any other blood, eat it as acid eats paint. . . Even an insignificant drop of Jewish blood. . . will impart to all the structure of the soul the die and the stamp of the Jews." So wrote a Christian clergyman. Thus, the waves of anti-Semitism are all the more drastic and merciless than the more acute social and political problems in one or the other society. In such periods the chronic paranoiac relationship to Jews, which has become part of the social consciousness, automatically suggests to people who are in a severe material and moral situation who is to blame for their misfortunes. The greatest persecutions of the Jews, the most misanthropic appeals and pronouncements we observe in the decades, are a turning point for one or the other country.

In order to make certain of this, it is enough to recall when in particular anti-Semites raised and raise the banners of their own predecessors, it would seem, surely buried in the depth of the centuries. The most recent examples:
in France it is the second half of the 19th century, in Russia - the start of the
20th century, before the First World War and the October Revolution, and in Germany - after the First World War. Psychologists and political scientists connect this with a common phenomenon which has received the name Weimar Complex. It existed long
before the start of the 20th century, but is known as Weimar because in particular in Germany, which was beat in the First World War, it developed especially distinctly. The complex is based on the humiliation and feeling of inferiority, and also on the wish to restore greatness and to take revenge on enemies. But, the first enemy, as is well known, is the Jews. And Hitlerism started from it. Now a paranoiac relationship to the Jews is observed especially distinctly in post-Soviet Russia and the Arab world, where social and economic antagonisms are extremely acute. The Jews are perceived as Russia's main enemy and of Orthodoxy in general. An important feature of the Jew as enemy is the fact that he invisibly stands for all the other visible enemies. The control of the Jews over the United States or over the worldwide financial system is commonplace. And they control the press: "The strongest weapon in the arms of the Zionists is their control over all means of information." ("The Controversy of Zion")
The Catholics also are under control of the Jews. Theorists of antiSemitism write today: "The past years have clearly shown that the heretic Vatican has become the main tool of the godless Israel in the affair of "the Judaisation of Christianity." What is more. "both the Catholics and the Jews are waiting for the same Messiah," that is the Antichrist. Even the most ardent Russian anti-Semite - neo-heathens - submit to the Jews: "As regards the appearance of neoheathenistic, although anti-Zionist books, that is of no surprise, since those very same Zionists are imposing the neoheathenism." "Beyond the explosions of the rockets in Afghanistan it almost is not heard how beneath the Al-Aks mosque with the labor intensity of ants they are working on the reconstruction of the third temple, where the Antichrist is supposed to be enthroned. (Telecast "Russian Home," Moscow, 8 November 2001. ) The old anti-Semitism hated the Jews. The new considers Jewish everything that it hates. They no longer seek on the basis of blood. As one of the most typical Russian anti-Semites, General Albert Makashov, said: "Yid is not a nationality, and not every Jew is a Yid. A bad person of any nationality. . . he is called a Yid." . The orthodox Moslems also see in the Jews the cause of the most serious economic and political gaps of their countries. They rely on the antiJewish sura in the Koran. According to the sacred book of the Moslems, for example, those of the Jews "who have not come to believe are in Gehenna's fire, residing there eternally. They are the worst of creatures." As a political ideology, Islamic fundamentalism declares war on modern Western democratic values as Jewish. This sounds like: the core of democratic society consists of the fact that the "Jews . . could indulge in debauchery, lie and cheat without problems." Another author writes: "Anyone who tears the umma (Moslem society) from its religion and the Koran can be only a Jewish agent - willingly or unwillingly, independent of origin. The situation is repeated with modern Christian anti-Semitism: everything that is hated is proclaimed as Jewish. The sentiments of Moslem radicals in Chechnia, one of Russia's autonomous republics, are typical, where a bloody war has been going on for

some years between the central authorities and the orthodox of the Wahhabit type. After a temporary victory of the separatists in 1996-1999, Chechnia became, strangely enough, a region of prevailing anti-Semitism. There were practically no Jews in Chechnia. Nonetheless, the rebels announced that "the Chechens have become the victim of the worldwide Zionist conspiracy" and that "the Jews are killing the Moslems with the hands of the stupid Russians." The incursion of the Islamists into Dagestan the summer of 1999 was proclaimed by its initiators as the continuation of the struggle not with Russians, but with "worldwide Zionism," and the final goal of the war that was starting was called "the liberation of Jerusalem." (According to the materials of the Moscow Bureau for the Rights of Man: www.answering-islam.org in the sections Muhammad and his Enemies, Islam & Terrorism)
Nowadays in Europe, blood libel no longer enjoys popularity. Instead in the Moslem world, in the masses of illiterate peasants and tradesmen, it has received broad dissemination. In which connection this phenomenon is in particular of our time. When in 1840, the so-called "Damascus Affair" arose, the Jews of Damascus were accused of the murder not of a mullah, but of a Christian Capuchin. Christians introduced blood libel into the Moslem world. Today their help is no longer necessary for the Islamic radicals. The Moslems believe blood libel unconditionally, especially since people who are considered respectable learned men speak and write about it. Thus, a professor of the Korolevskiy University Al Dammam (Saudi Arabia), Doctor Umaima Akhmad al-Jalama, tells his listeners that during the Purim holiday the Jews prepare special dishes, which are mixed of human blood. He describes with relish how they obtain this blood: they shove a non-Jewish child, a Moslem or a Christian, into a barrel, which is studded within with nails. They granulate the blood received, hand it over to a "Jewish priest," and he prepares hamentaschen cookies and presents them to the parishioners. They, tasting the cookies, get drunk on wine until they lose human appearance and have sexual orgies in the synagogues. ("Al-Riad" newspaper, 10-12 March 2004)
The procession of anti-Semitism continues. No one knows, per se, how to curb it. Many set hopes on an increase of society's education: the more people there will be with upper and secondary education, that is with more developed intellect and culture, the less room will remain for nationalistic prejudices. Life, however, convinces about the other. In all countries, the representatives of the intelligentsia are the most uncompromising antiSemites. They are those who write the books, publish the newspapers, teach the children in the schools and lecture on the "Zionist wise men." They themselves create the nationalistic organizations and establish the international connections with like-thinkers. Solid financial circles in dozens of countries are their support. So, an overall upgrade in the level of culture and education, alas, will not help. In our view, the problem is not in the education as it is and not in the culture, but in their content. Anti-Semitism, as we have been assured, is based on myths connected with the postulates of traditional history. And one needs to begin with these postulates. The light at the end of the anti-Semitic tunnel will begin to appear when school children study not the myths and legends about the past of their peoples, but authentic history. It is full of cruelty and sufferings, and one cannot always be proud of it. But it allows one to see who is who in this world. The better means of persuasion is historical truth. It is too bad that not all require it.
