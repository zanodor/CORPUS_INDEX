CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
The argument of this thesis will be primarily based upon a contextual approach to
the Old Testament. It will first address the historiographical issues concerning the Joshua
narratives as a result of the archaeological evidence in the region during his time. Based
on the problems with literalist interpretations of the Joshua narratives that stem from
archaeological data, this thesis will then propose a new method of reading and
understanding the figure of Joshua that builds upon the theory of a mixed multitude of
Israelite ethnogenesis. In this reading it is possible that Joshua's accomplishments as
described in the biblical narrative may have been feats of other individuals but were
instead credited to the person of Joshua by the biblical writers in order to further unite the
diverse groups that composed the early Israelite people. To validate this possibility, there
will then be a textual and archaeological comparison with Sargon of Akkad, a legendary
figure who likewise has accomplishments of other kings credited to him. Ultimately this
proposal to understand Joshua in such a way is in no way authoritative, but will provide
one additional possible way of reconciling the archaeological evidence with the biblical
narratives.
Introduction to the Contextual Approach
According to William Hallo, the goal of the contextual approach is to "silhouette
the biblical text against its wider literary and cultural environment and thus to arrive at a
proper assessment of the extent to which the biblical evidence reflects the environment

or, on the contrary, is distinctive and innovative over against it."1 In order to apply the
contextual approach, it may be helpful to first distinguish "comparative" studies and
"background" studies as two different methods within a contextual approach.
Comparative study, as the name implies, involves inter-comparing materials of different
cultures from a broader cultural framework. Background studies (or cultural studies), on
the other hand, involves analyzing the written and material culture of the ancient peoples
in order to reconstruct and understand the worldviews and beliefs of the culture in
question.2 That said, the two are not separate; no single aspect of any people or culture in
a context can be seen in isolation from others.
When one attempts to reconstruct a material world of an ancient society by means
of archaeology, one inevitably will create a timeline of events as a result of chronological
dating and thus engage in studies in history. In doing so, surviving writings from a
culture may appear and then linguistic studies that take into account an entire language
family are necessary to understand the writings, which in turn may give historical insights
as well. In other words, the "contextual approach" consists of multiple "sub-methods,"
each of which relate and correspond to the other. As a focus point, then, this analysis will
first take an archaeological perspective to illustrate the relationship between the sub
methods in the contextual approach when addressing questions of context.

Historiography
Defining history. Before one can draw conclusions from archaeology, however,
one must determine the purpose of excavations and analyzing material culture from
ancient civilizations. At the heart of this lies the question of history--the monumental task
of defining it and, perhaps just as importantly, defining what it is not. The term "history"
can have three different meanings; it can refer to the actual events that happened in the
past, the surviving traces of these events, or even the mere interpretation of past events.3
Another way of defining history can be seen in the different German terms for history.
The term geschichte refers to the academic discipline of history writing, while historie
refers to a less formal narrative history and the term storie refers to mythical and folkloric
narrative that still aims at recounting past events. Furthermore, in the study of history one
can also distinguish between different specializations. These specializations include
political history, intellectual history, socioeconomic history, technological history, art
history, ideological history, natural history, and culture history.4 As a result, a proper
study of “history” will include the study of texts, artifacts, and even natural sciences such
as geology in order to analyze the environment of past human existences. Ultimately,
perhaps the best description of history would be that it is a multi-disciplinary field that

reviews every relevant bit of information in any given investigation rather than attempt to
discover any particular piece of evidence that will answer a particular question.5
In light of this multi-faceted nature of history, what distinguishes the study of
history from social scientific disciplines is that history is ideographic while social
scientific disciplines are nomothetic. Instead of attempting to explain a particular issue in
terms of a model or system as in other social scientific disciplines, a historian instead
seeks to establish and identify patterns of cause and effect. To illustrate this, Edelman
(1991) provides an example in a comparison of how a social scientist and a historian
would investigate the coup of biblical King Jehu. In this investigation, the social scientist
would use the same sources as the historian, but would likely use theories and models
based on other case studies particular to the social scientist's own field. In contrast, the
historian would attempt to determine patterns of cause and effect by essentially imagining
oneself as someone living in Israel at the time of King Jehu.6
Of course, actually living in the past and observing past events as a first-hand
observer is but a fantasy. What any researcher of past events has access to in order to
reconstruct an understandable picture of the past is only that which has survived to be
studied. Such surviving material must be distinguished into consciously transmitted
information and unconsciously transmitted information.7 Consciously transmitted
information could include monuments, ancient chronicles, and epics in that they were
intentionally created for future peoples to study. On the other hand, unconsciously

transmitted material includes human remains, business records and other simple artifacts
such as cooking pots. In either case, the picture such evidence provides to the researcher
is always extremely fragmented and must be interpreted. Both texts and artifacts can be
considered "encoded messages" about how human past was perceived and therefore must
be interpreted.8 In this attempt to reconstruct the world of the past from the surviving
material, inevitably much of the past is lost to time be it due to physical erosion of
material evidence or due to the intentional tampering of textual material. As a result,
there is the need to hypothesize in order to fill the missing gaps in any presentation and
reconstruction of the past.9
Consequently, every analysis of the past is still an interpretation from the vantage
point of the present time. While in the 19th century some scholars such as J.G. Droysen
may have believed that empirical history (that is, the actual events that happened) can be
determined from the sources, it would appear in more recent scholarship that "history" is
but an intellectual construct.10 In other words, "time travel" by means of studying ancient
texts and artifacts is an illusion; the past is past. What remains is historiography.
Historiography can refer to the evolution of the form of historical narratives, the nature
and composition of histories, or the tracing of the evolution of mental states in surviving

literature.11 Literature, however, must also be understood in context. Due to the low
literacy rates of ancient times, literature is dominantly the product of a small minority of
intellectual elite. In addition, literature is written for a specific audience and intended to
communicate primarily the author's perspective and interpretation of reality. Even when
dealing with past events, literature does not tell "how it really was." In other words, one
could consider literature "symbolically encoded thought and behavior" that is ridden with
ideology.12
To summarize, history is based on the interpretation of sources. This
interpretation itself is based on the theoretical approach of historians, which is in turn
based on the historians' previous knowledge of history. Despite these difficulties and
complexities of analyzing history and reconstructing the past, however, it may still be
possible to create an "objective" history in that it is still possible to construct history in
accordance with principles of objective knowledge based on observation and test. Even
though objective knowledge itself is preliminary and transient, it is still a valid product
from hypothesis, test, theory, and experience.13 In this understanding, one could say that
no scientific methodology or perspective of analyzing history cannot be disproven and
conjecture is always necessary, but given the limited sources available to the researcher
the dependence upon the foundation of what is observable and testable (which Thompson
calls "the observable singular") is nonetheless still the best method to employ in historical

inquiry.14 As will be further explained below, however, a proper application of said
"objective" study must not be purely positivist as anything in scientific history is just as
disputable as the "objective facts" themselves. Both science and the humanities proceed
by conjecture and refutation, and both result in only theories that interpret reality. The
difference, as Knauf points out, is that in the study of natural sciences it is easier to
formulate tests than it is in the study of history.15
Biblical History
History of research. When applied specifically to biblical history, one can identify
three reasons the historiographical debate has been a controversial and complex subject.
First, the Bible is ancient; the texts are not preserved in their original form and textual
critics have identified numerous inconsistencies between the surviving texts. Second, the
Bible consists of multiple books and genres, and as a result determining the intent of each
book of the Bible requires extensive study. For example, V. Phillips Long suggests that if
a biblical narrative of the Deuteronomistic History is a coherent story and the
Deuteronomistic History itself is intended to be history, it is indeed making historical
claims unless one has either understood the text improperly or else other evidence points
to the contrary.16 Third and most importantly, the Bible is theological in nature and still
holds theological authority in present-day faith communities. As a result, modern

scholarship of the Bible has led to many questions and criticisms of both the
methodology of biblical studies and the Bible's historical veracity itself. The origin of this
scientifically-dominated paradigm began in the Ages of Reason and Enlightenment which
saw the beginning of the emphasis on the empirical method of testing hypotheses.17
Granted, even "science" in the 19th century falls short of the scientific standards of the
present, but by the 19th century there was nonetheless a clear shift away from trust in
tradition and religious means of explaining the world.18
During this time also rose the historical-critical method which was exemplified
under the works of Julius Wellhausen. Although the documentary hypothesis was
formulated before him, Wellhausen proposed a chronological order for the Bible's
sources.19 He concluded that the first six books of the Hebrew Bible consisted of four
sources: the Jahwist, Elohist, Deuteronomist, and Priestly sources. Wellhausen dated J to
the period of the United Monarchy, E to the Divided Monarchy, D to the period of the
Josianic and pre-exilic prophetic movements, and finally P to the Exile and post-Exile.
The implication from this designation was monumental for later research as will be
further discussed below; the assumption that each source dated to specific time periods
meant that the historicity from the periods described in each source was inaccessible to
the researcher. Instead, only the context of the particular time the books were written

(that is, the time period of the sources) could be studied.20 Each biblical author had
different opinions, and modern scholarship must as a result recognize how each author's
perspective could influence the text's presentation of the past. That said, in the 19th
century the assumption was still that the biblical texts were written in definite historical
circumstances that could be understood by the researcher.21
At this point in time, both historical criticism and the study of archaeology in
Israel were still rooted in the Bible's own portrayal of the world. Archaeological
discoveries were essentially seen to coincide with the Bible and were thus used as a
means of support for the Bible's historical veracity. William F. Albright, for instance,
sought to combat historical criticism by means of excavating evidence of the ancient
biblical cities despite frequently finding evidence suggesting that the archaeology and
Bible did not, in fact, always agree. Toward the mid-20th century, however, Albrecht Alt
and Martin Noth hypothesized that the historical truth in the Bible was not to be found in
a simplistic face-value reading but rather in the Bible's core traditions.22 The assumption
under Alt and Noth was that the biblical texts, beginning with the stories of the
patriarchs, were rooted in history and the goal of historical-critical study was to find the
roots in the sources and traditions.23 Under this assumption, Martin Noth gave the first
complete argument for the unity of the Deuteronomistic History. He observed that the

language style and themes of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings had very clear
connections to the book of Deuteronomy, implying an overarching D source perspective.
For example, Deuteronomy emphasizes centralization of worship and fidelity to YHWH
alone. In the judgment of the kings as described in the book of Kings, how the king is
judged is based dominantly on the criteria of whether he upheld the laws of
Deuteronomy.24 This is not to say that there was clearly only one author for the entire
Deuteronomistic History, however, and some of the problems with viewing Joshua as a
Deuteronomistic historical work will be discussed below.
Towards the 1970s and 1980s, the assumption that the biblical texts had any roots
in history was eventually questioned by those who expanded upon the Wellhausian
assumption that a biblical document reflects the context of its own formation rather than
the context of the events it describes. The analysis of Albright's work (both
archaeological and textual) under Thomas L. Thompson and John van Seters resulted in
the conclusion that much of the evidence corresponding to the age of the Patriarchs under
Albright's analysis was instead to be dated to the Iron Age instead of the Late Bronze or
earlier. As a result, they concluded that the patriarchal stories were instead "proto
history" and the patriarchs could not be placed in a specific historical period at all.25
Subsequently, under the scheme established by Herman Gunkel and H. Gressman earlier
in the 20th century, Israelite historiography was accepted to have been developed from
earlier oral forms of sage and legende and into historical writing in the period of the
United Monarchy. While the details of how history developed from oral tradition are still

11
a matter of debate, what is clear is that the scholarly consensus toward the end of the 20th
century agreed that the biblical narratives were written with a specific purpose related to
the social and political circumstances of the time of composition.26
Revisionist challenge. This emphasis on the problems of ideologically-based
history brings the discussion of historiography to the most recent debates; if the "history"
contained in the Bible can only reflect the thoughts and context of the writers and is
ridden with ideology, does a "biblical history" even exist if the texts were written in the
Iron Age or later? While in the 1980s most scholars still believed that it was possible to
gain some historical understanding from studying the biblical narratives despite evidence
indicating that the events did not occur exactly as described, in the 1990s the very
existence of a "history of Israel" was questioned. Scholars such as Thomas L. Thompson,
Niels Peter Lemche, Philip R. Davies, and Keith W. Whitelam have been labeled as the
"minimalists" as a result of their conclusions. They suggested that the Bible is entirely
too problematic for it to be regarded as a source for studying Israel's past. Based
primarily on philosophical analysis and literary criticism, the Bible was seen by the
minimalists to have been written with preconceived notions of the meaning of the past.
As a result, in this view fiction and history are so interwoven that it has become
impossible to distinguish between the two in biblical study. Some of the more extreme
minimalist positions even held that ancient "Israel" itself may not have really existed.
Philip R. Davies, for example, has suggested that "ancient Israel" was not a unified group
but rather a kingdom destroyed by the Assyrians in the 8th century BCE. According to
Davies, during the Persian period scribes created a national history (an "Israel of
26 Van Seters, In Search of History, 246.



12
tradition") and an ethnic and political origin in order to unify the postexilic Jerusalemite
community.27 Thompson likewise agrees that the formation of ideologically-motivated
narrative begins during the Assyrian conquest, and that this surviving "tradition of Israel"
came to be during the pre-Hellenistic postexilic period.28 In other words, "biblical Israel"
was entirely an intellectual construct formed in the Persian period; there was no United
Monarchy or even a Divided Monarchy. There was only the Palestinian kingdom
destroyed by the Assyrians and the returning exiles who were eventually unified under a
work of "pious fiction.”29
The minimalists, often also called "revisionists," can be said to be reacting against
late 19th-20th century positivism. In other words, they are attacking the presupposition
that objective and discoverable truths are accessible through observation of empirical
evidence. Perhaps most distinct of this movement in regards to the topic of biblical
history is that the focus has shifted entirely away from history and towards viewing the
biblical narratives simply as stories.30 Even if the Bible's stories do contain historical
information, methodologically-speaking it is impossible to separate the fact from fiction
according to the revisionist line of thought. The surviving "Israel of tradition" (as
opposed to an "Israel of history"), Thompson acknowledges, may indeed be based on
older oral traditions and legends. He notes, however, that even in a "minimalist" or
"revisionist" methodology one must still take into account the limitations that come with
the contextual gap; anything read today is still read in today's context. He asserts that

13
tradition is the fundamental starting point for history's understanding of Israel and it
would be anachronistic if the tradition is used as historical evidence for the history prior
to the context of tradition. If the tradition is understood teleologically, however, the
tradition gives direction for research and the "Israel of tradition" is the proper subject of
historical explanation. The task of exegesis, then, is not to imagine traditions behind the
texts, but to focus on the final form of the text and to find the significance in the
surviving theological tradition.31
Response to the Revisionist school. The revisionist view has not gone
unchallenged. Thompson and Lemche, in their emphasis on the notion that the biblical
narratives are but "stories" rather than histories, assign the term "literature" to the biblical
narratives. In their view the designation of "history" upon the biblical texts was, in fact,
forced upon it and only recently so.32 This is obviously an exaggerated claim as the
biblical narratives have been regarded as truthful accounts of past events for millennia,
but their claim can be paraphrased in Whitelam's pronouncement that the study of the
history of Palestine based on the Bible is "dead." The problem in such a statement is that
if the history is to be dismissed on ideological elements in the text, the methodology
assumes a double standard. Why does ideology in a text void its historicity when every
historical investigation and, indeed, every human endeavor employs it? Their
methodology in itself is ideologically-motivated in that there is the hope of formulating a
"real Palestinian history" that somehow does not involve viewing the notion of biblical
history as a working hypothesis. How is it that one can say there is no such thing as a
31 Thompson, “Text, Context, and Referent,” 67-75.
32 Dever, What Did the Biblical Writers Know, 10.



14
biblical Israel any more than there is one?33 Ultimately, it appears that the issue in
Whitelam's statement is not a matter of whether one relies on evidence in historiography
but rather what counts as evidence, and the revisionists seem to have automatically
voided the Bible.34
While the revisionist view is correct in acknowledging the difficulty in accessing
the contexts beyond the surviving tradition seen in the final form of the biblical texts,
there are many affinities between both earlier and later traditions. The revisionists
overemphasize the contextual gap in that they assume that the Bible is a closed book that
exists only in its postexilic context. The truth is that all literature is of human origin; all
narrative and languages share common features be it ancient or modern.35 The
revisionists, in essence, assume an ideology of science that supports their
deconstructionist position. However, a proper scholarly mentality should naturally hold
that everything one says is potentially wrong; every theory can be disproven. The only
people that are "always right" are ideologists.36 As already mentioned, every scientific
methodology is but a working hypothesis used to interpret reality. To summarize the
problem with the revisionist school of thought,
What sense does it make, exactly, to concede that all literature is ideological in nature and then to criticize other scholars for writing histories of Israel that are reflective of their own ideology? How else could they write? What sense does it make to allow that history is elusive in an objective sense, is inevitably the construct of the historian, and then to criticize others for creating the construct "ancient Israel"? And what possible sense can it make, in the

15
context of all such concessions, to claim that one’s own group alone are the guardians of real
academic scholarship, and that everyone else is only pretending?37
As a result, both positivism and the seemingly nihilist perspective of the
revisionist schools can be considered too generalizing and simplistic. Indeed, the Bible's
historicity cannot be dismissed simply as "fiction" as it is at once historical, theological,
and literary. The "fictional elements" should instead be viewed as artistry in the same
manner as that of a painting rather than a photograph. The Bible's narratives, being
written after the events described, also shows the significance of the events' post-history
in a creative, aesthetic manner.38 The Bible should therefore be treated on its own terms
as a diverse collection of books written over a large period of time and with multiple
genres and purposes, even in the so-called Deuteronomistic History; not all narratives
were only intended to describe actual events of the past.39 Instead of utilizing a flawed
and too-encompassing methodology, then, the biblical narratives should be studied on a
case by case basis. If one does not respect and appropriate the testimony of any ancient
text in this manner, inevitably any attempt at applying an objective perspective will fail
and end up limiting what the texts actually say. All history and study of history is a
matter of testimony; ancient texts can be fictionalized and portray incomplete pictures,
but they still can represent the past.40 The revisionist schools, then, are essentially too
confident in their deconstructionist methodology. An awareness of the difficulties and

16
impossibilities of fully reconstructing the past should lead on to scholarly humility and
openness to dialogue rather than nihilism.
Final Remarks on Biblical History. What appears universally agreed upon in
current scholarship is that the Bible cannot be viewed as a simple recounting of the past
at face value; to do so would be to ignore the contextual gap and to misinterpret the
writers' intentions. The topic of historiography is an ongoing debate and the comparison
between Joshua and Sargon is not intended to solve it. Nonetheless, even if the Bible is
ridden with ideology, Mesopotamian texts are no different, as will be discussed below.
As a result, the comparison between Joshua and Sargon will be based on the assumption
that there is historical truth in the biblical (and Mesopotamian) narratives, and some of it
is indeed accessible through a multi-faceted contextual approach by means of utilizing
both textual and archaeological evidence. Even though these methods are constantly
changing and imperfect, they are nevertheless useful as working hypotheses. On the
subject of working hypotheses, however, it is necessary to note that a discussion of the
plausibility of divine intervention and miracles is ultimately irrelevant for the comparison
between Joshua and Sargon; the basis of the comparison rests on whether or not Jericho,
Hazor, and Ai were destroyed in the time periods corresponding to the Israelite conquest
of Canaan. As a result, the comparison will not factor in supernatural elements in
hypothesizing what really happened in the past.



17
Role of Archaeology
The use of archaeology to reconstruct a history of Israel, as discussed above,
suffers many similar challenges as the use of texts. Not only is the material evidence of
the past extremely fragmented, the archaeological material must also be interpreted. Even
though an object found in the dirt cannot simply be dismissed as "fiction" in the same
way as a narrative can be, the archaeology is still dependent upon the texts for
interpretation. For example, if one were to find a simple cooking pot in Iron I Canaan,
there is nothing explicit about the pot that would indicate that it was made or used by an
Israelite as described in the Bible. Without the texts that suggested such an association,
there would not be a discussion as to whether the pot was "Israelite" at all. The only term
that could properly describe the cooking pot, then, would be "Iron I," and even that term
is a modern designation. In other words, regardless of whether one defends or attacks the
veracity of the relevant texts, inevitably one still uses the texts as a framework for
interpretation.41 Consequently, the interpretations of the archaeological evidence are
myriad as will be demonstrated below.
Nonetheless archaeology has certain advantages over textual studies when it
comes to reconstructing the past. First, archaeology deals with any and all surviving
material as an evidence-based discipline. Whereas texts such as the Bible are interpreted
indirectly in the sense that readers interpret the authors who themselves interpreted the

18
data or events, non-textual archaeological data is interpreted directly.42 As a result one
could say that while the Hebrew text is a secondary source, the non-textual
archaeological material (which constitutes the vast majority of archaeological data),
being interpreted directly, is a primary source.43 Second, archaeology offers insights into
the ancient world that texts cannot offer. Archaeology and the Bible, for example, present
two histories. Biblical history is text-based, political, and theological. Archaeology, on
the other hand, provides a technological and cultural history. Biblical texts, being written
documents, are selective and elitist; they reflect a principal ideology and are a closed
corpus. In contrast, archaeological artifacts are populist and broadly representative; they
constitute a random sample, they reflect practice instead of ideology, and they are a
dynamic and expanding source of data with new discoveries every day. Archaeological
artifacts also reflect "real" life in that what the ancients really used is what is found. With
exception to the occasional forgery, the evidence is not "tampered" with like an edited
text.44 Third, archaeology provides an external witness to the biblical texts and can act as
a corrective for textual interpretation as will be demonstrated below.45 As a result, while
archaeology may not be able to supplant any written source due its dependence on texts
and its fragmented nature, it is nevertheless a vital component in the study of history due
to the fact that it provides a broader picture of the ancient context.

Application of the Contextual Approach
Joshua in Context
In order to address context, then, one can begin by comparing the biblical
narrative to other texts of similar geographic regions and time periods. As mentioned
above, when under the assumption that a biblical narrative is intended to be read as a
history, the Bible's historical claims can only be accepted as true if there is no evidence
pointing to the contrary. One could consider such evidence to be an "external witness,"
whereas the text itself is an "internal witness."46 In the case of Joshua, then, it is clear that
the text can be categorized as a conquest narrative. Perhaps the foremost work in this
subject would be Ancient Conquest Accounts47 by K. Lawson Younger, Jr. who compares
the Joshua conquest narratives to similar narratives found in Egyptian and Mesopotamian
texts.
The first example found in Younger's book is the issue of the Gibeonite deception
in Joshua 9. While M. Noth and J. Liver suggest that the Gibeonite deception was
essentially an explanation devised by later writers for the Gibeonite presence in their
time, Younger references the story of Gyges king of Lydia who "deceived" the king of
Assyria by submitting to be a vassal until his ends were met from the relationship and
then broke the oath. A similar case is found in the treaty between Mursili and the Azzi in
which the Azzi swore servitude only to break the oath, so Younger suggests that this kind

20
of deceptive submission presents itself as an Ancient Near Eastern "transmission code"
which the Gibeonite deception in Joshua 9 may follow.48 In Joshua 10 YHWH is said to
have rained hailstones from heaven, and once again a parallel is seen in the Ten Year
Annals of Mursili in which the storm god sends a meteor against the land of Arzawa.49 In
addition, Younger notes that another transmission code is evident in that both accounts
involve the deity hurling stones, the leader figure pursuing the enemy, and the leader
conquering the region in one unit of time as seen in Joshua 10:42.50 Furthermore, in the
Old Babylonian narrative “Sargon, the Conquering Hero,” in lines 40-91 the sun is said to
have darkened and the "stars sallied forth against the enemy.”51 This motif of the sun
darkening could be considered similar to the story of the sun standing still in Joshua 10,
and Younger notes that numerous other ancient texts (including but not limited to the
Iliad, Habakkuk 3, and the Annals of Tiglath-Pileser I) describe other similar cases of
divine intervention.52 From these texts, it is clear that divine intervention is a frequently
seen feature in Ancient Near Eastern conquest texts when describing real events, and
Joshua employs many of the same elements in its own narratives.

21
Literary Narrative
The fact that the biblical narratives like some Mesopotamian literature can be
historical, literary, and theological simultaneously means that the proper intent of each
book must be looked at carefully. As mentioned above, even though the biblical books
are compiled into a single canon the individual books have different genres and even
within each genre each book may have different purposes and different degrees of
historical intent. For example, the portrayal of King Abijah in I Kings 15 and II
Chronicles 13 is very different. In I Kings presents Abijah as a king who was not true to
YHWH, whereas II Chronicles portrays the opposite. The reason for this difference is a
matter of the respective writers’ intent; the book of Kings’ overarching theme is
explaining why the Exile occurred and therefore emphasized the sins of the kings,
whereas the post-exilic book of Chronicles’ emphasis is on presenting a positive model of
behavior. As a result, Abijah, who may have acted faithfully to YHWH at one point in his
life and unfaithful in another, is simply portrayed differently depending on the authors’
vantage point.53
However, certain details in the biblical narratives seem to be in error in light of
external evidence and consequently warrant explanation. William Dever suggests that the
biblical writers should have possessed (and therefore displayed) certain historical
information even if the intent of their writings was communicating YHWH's deliverance
or the reasons for their socio-political situation. The fall of Lachish for instance,
brilliantly attested in both Sennacherib's palace relief and the ruins of the city itself, is
53 Longman, “History and the Old Testament,” 116-118.



22
only mentioned in passing in Kings and Chronicles. In addition, it seems as though the
biblical writers wrongly dated the siege of Lachish to 714 BCE and even recorded the
wrong Pharaohs.54 However, the burden of proof does not exclusively reside with the
biblical account. As will be demonstrated below, Mesopotamian texts suffer many of the
same difficulties in both historical and historical-literary texts as biblical literature. In
addition, the apparent errors are only based on the extant evidence; the very next day
there may be an archaeological discovery that reconciles the contradiction between the
biblical narratives and the extra-biblical literature.
Ancient Mesopotamian Texts
A comparison between the literature concerning Sargon of Akkad and that of
Joshua son of Nun first requires that the differences between the information available be
laid out clearly. Sargon’s historical existence has not been questioned as much as Joshua
firstly because there are numerous contemporary monuments documenting the
accomplishments of Sargon. On the other hand, the earliest mention of Joshua lies within
the Pentateuch which seems to have been compiled into its final form centuries after the
events of Joshua took place. Another important distinction to note when comparing a
biblical figure such as Joshua to a Mesopotamian king is that while there is one major
text for biblical figures, the literature surrounding Mesopotamian kings is often diverse
and relatively scattered across time. As a result, the following section will briefly identify
some of the major genres of Mesopotamian literature.
54 Dever, “Archaeology, Material Culture, and the Early Monarchic Period,” 106-107.



23
“Historical” texts. The royal inscription, probably the most typical of "historical"
texts, is obviously not unique to ancient Mesopotamian cultures but Sumerian and
Akkadian inscriptions do possess a number of distinct features that warrant some
description. A royal inscription, in its simplest form, can be considered a "label" where a
king states ownership of a building such as a temple. Some such inscriptions can be
commemorative in which they would be longer and put in public places while others are
considered "votive" inscriptions when dedicated to a deity. Sometimes such inscriptions
also have blessings, curses, or a history of the temple's restoration with the intent of being
found by future renovators.55 In the category of royal inscriptions are also annals which
were written by Assyrians that are written in the first person of royalty describing
campaigns in chronological order. In these inscriptions scribes would abbreviate earlier
accounts or conflate versions of the same account resulting in the text fluctuating
between first and third person, often resulting in exaggerations within their later versions.
However, even though similar annals were found in Anatolia and Egypt, none are from
Sumer and Babylon.56
The next category are the King lists, which are chronographic texts that resemble
chronicles in that the texts possess some dating formulas and narrative regarding
important events. The prime example of a king list for this discussion would be the
Sumerian King list, which has been preserved in a number of copies from the Old
55 Van Seters, In Search of History, 60.

24
Babylonian period. Written in Sumerian, the Sumerian King List57 explains how kingship
descended from heaven and was first established in Eridu, followed by a list of 8 or 9
kings before the great flood. After the flood, kingship is then said to have descended
upon Kish, followed by yet another list of reigning kings. Historically speaking, however,
the Sumerian King list assumes a certain linearity of kingship when in reality multiple
kings ruled simultaneously. In addition, some versions do not have the section listing the
antediluvian kings which suggests that it was probably a later or completely different
tradition.58 The Assyrian King List, for example, does not have the same division based
on the flood, and the entire list concerns Assur only rather than multiple cities like in the
Sumerian King List.59
The enigmatic "omen text" can be best summarized as a text containing an
interpretation of an event. Hypothetically, if a string of meteorological events
corresponded with the death of a king, the occurrences would be linked in the minds of
contemporary persons. This, then, could form the basis for the omen text.60 While such
texts may suggest prophetic or astrological intent, when put side by side omen texts and
chronicle texts can sometimes appear very similar in both structure and content.61 Indeed,
the resemblance to chronicles cannot be denied, and even though omens may have been

25
predictions the interpretations seemed to have been based on what were perceived to be
real events. One problem, as van Seters notes, can be seen in the Cuthean Legend of
Naram-Sin in which the moral of the story was that ill fate befell the kingdom because he
failed to heed the omens. However, the actual discovered omens corresponding to
Naram-Sin all seem to speak of his success rather than fall. As a result, even the facts and
"real events" that may form the basis of omen texts may be distorted.62 Methodologically
speaking, it is essential that one does not simply remove mythical or religious elements
from texts such as omens and then claim that they have found a "historical kernel." The
earliest omens, in fact, are so vague that they cannot allude to any specific event to verify
historically.63
A chronicle, to be distinguished from a King List or royal inscription, is typically
"narration of political or religious events in chronological order and is closely dated to
the years of a king's reign."64 J. J. Finkelstein suggested that the omens, as mentioned
above, actually served as the basis of Mesopotamian chronicles; ancient Mesopotamians
viewed the significance of past events based on their exemplificative value.65 Van Seters
challenges this claim in that omens, unlike chronicles, were based on the belief that one
could affect the outcome of future events by communication with the supernatural and, as
62 Van Seters, In Search of History, 78-79.
63 Mario Liverani, “Model and Actualization: The Kings of Akkad in the Historical Tradition,” in Akkad: the First World Empire: Structure, Ideology, Traditions (ed. Mario Liverani; HANE/S 5; Padova: Tipografia Poligrafica Moderna, 1993), 44.

26
a result, would not evolve into a historical consciousness.66 Even though information in
some chronicles may have been derived from omen texts such as in the Chronicle of
Early Kings, Van Seters instead argues that the chronicles were more likely based on
astronomical diaries rather than omen texts as seen in the Babylonian Chronicle Series
where each regnal year is one entry and events are dated to the day and month of that
year.67 However, this is not to say that chronicles are historical by modern standards
either; the Chronicle of the Reign of Sargon, for instance, mentions Sargon's greatness
but also his sacrilege of moving clay from Babylon to form Akkad.68
Historical-Literary texts. "Historical-literary" texts, although a modern term, tend
to belong to various refined literary forms while their content is centered on what were
perceived to be real events. Grayson categorizes "historical-literary" texts into three
genres: prophecy, historical epic, and pseudoautobiography. Prophecies, such as the
Marduk Prophetic Speech which reflects on the reign of King Nebuchadnezzer I, contain
"predictions" of past events written as a prose composition.69 It is important to note that
oracles and Akkadian prophecies are not the same thing; oracles had an oral background
and were single divine utterances usually through named medium to kings for a specific
time. In contrast, Akkadian prophecies described longer periods of time in vague terms.70

70 A. K. Grayson, Babylonian Historical-Literary Texts (TSTS 3; Toronto, Canada.: Univeristy of Toronto Press, 1975), 13.



27
The Babylonian prophetic genre has also been noted by scholars such as William Hallo
and W. G. Lambert to bear similarity to portions of the book of Daniel. Both
Mesopotamian chronography and Daniel seem to concern themselves with the concept of
the rise and fall of empires in what is labeled "dynastic prophecy.”71
Epics such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and Enuma Elish must be distinguished from
“historical epics." The general term “epic” essentially refers to a long narrative poem.
The epic form is of Sumerian origin, but the historical epic specifically appears to have
been an Akkadian phenomenon.72 A historical epic, unlike the generic “epic,” specifically
centers on the activities of figures perceived to be real persons and focuses specifically on
social-political events rather than the activities of the gods. However, sometimes the
distinction is not so clear; a text can be both historically-minded yet still contain
significant mythological elements as seen in the Sargon Birth Legend. In addition, even a
real figure such as Sargon of Akkad seems to be the subject of both historical and
mythological literature.73 Nonetheless it is still sometimes useful to use the category
“historical epics” in order to make a distinction between those perceived to be real figures
and those that may be fictional when analyzing poetic narratives. For example,
Gilgamesh may have been fictional, but Sargon of Akkad was certainly seen as a real
figure.74

28
A third type of historical-literary text is the fictional autobiography. Also called
"naru-literature" or "pseudoautobiography," these first-person writings typically have a
didactic intent as seen in the Cuthean legend of Naram-Sin.75 Regardless of the exact
definition for the genre there are identifiable characteristics: they are written in the first
person, they concern the figure of a great king with unusual experiences, they are
pseudepigraphical but purport to be royal inscriptions written in poetic narrative style,
and they conclude with a blessing oracle or curse formula for future kings.76
Pseudoautobiographies may or may not recount actual events of an individual, but they
are certainly pseudonymous as they were written at a later period of time.77 Pseudo
autobiographies originated in the Sumerian period, but even though there is a
composition about Djoser in Egyptian that is similar in form, there is no evidence of such
texts in Hebrew or Hittite.78
Historicity of Mesopotamian texts. While royal inscriptions, king lists, omen texts,
and chronicles may seem to hold more historicity than historical-literary texts, it is clear
that no ancient Mesopotamian genre of texts can be considered a simple recounting of
past events. Even though these genres may deal with past events, generally speaking the
purpose of these were for reasons other than reporting what really happened. Omens and
chronicles, J. J. Finkelstein says, may have been the exception in that they were intended

29
to give accounts of actual events (although van Seters disagrees as mentioned above), but
it would seem that even these writings had intentions beyond the mere recording of
events.79 According to E. A Spieser, ancient Mesopotamian interest in the past could be
considered to be focused on maintaining continuity of a "covenantal" relationship
between the community and gods.80 Methodologically speaking, however, it is essential
that one does not simply filter mythical or religious elements from texts such as omens
and then immediately claim that one has found a "historical kernel" as even the events
themselves may have been altered for certain non-historical ends.81

CHAPTER TWO
THE PROBLEM OF JOSHUA AS PRESENTED BY ARCHAEOLOGY
At the heart of archaeology is chronology, and comparing literary aspects of
ancient texts do not aid in the dating of any specific text.82 As a result, the search for the
artifacts of the Joshua narrative discussed here will be focused not on tracing "events" per
se, but on finds from specific cities which are mentioned in the biblical narratives.
Beyond acceptance of the chronology established by I Kings 6:1, there is no other data
that can serve as an absolute chronology for the Exodus or the conquest. If one assumes
the biblical “Shishak” from I Kings 14:25-28 to refer to Sheshonq I, then the date of
Solomon's reign is firmly established to be in the 10th century BCE as Sheshonq I ruled
sometime in that period.83 With the 480 years mentioned in I Kings 6:1 taken into
account, the Israelite conquest would therefore be dated to sometime around the 15th
century BCE. However, it has been suggested that that the biblical chronology from this
passage could be taken as twelve generations rather than 480 years as the number 480
does represent twelve sets of 40, with 40 years possibly representing a generation. In
addition, based on the length of the reigns of the leaders from Exodus to I Kings, the date
of the Exodus could also have taken place in the 13th century based purely on the biblical
chronology.84 Nevertheless, archaeological excavations in stratum that correspond to
either date may provide answers to the historical nature of the Joshua conquest.

31
Archaeology of Ai
The city of Ai is said to be one of the three cities (the others being Hazor and
Jericho) Joshua burned to the ground and as a result is one of the major ancient sites
concerning the archaeological study of the Joshua narratives. While studies under Judith
Marquet-Krause have indicated that et-Tell (the most widely accepted location of biblical
Ai) was long destroyed during the period between 1500 BCE and 1200 BCE, there has
been some debate as to the proper identification of the site of Ai.85 Two alternative sites
have been suggested: Khirbet Nisya and Khirbet el-Maqatir.
The primary supporter of the identification of Ai as Khirbet Nisya is David
Livingston. It has been argued that William Albright's identification of et-Tell as Ai was
based on the assumption that Beitin is Bethel and that Joshua's Ai had to be east of Bethel
in accordance to Joshua 7:2’s orientation.86 As a result, et-Tell seemed to Albright to be
the only possible location for Canaanite Ai given that et-Tell is the only mound in the
area which was both east of Beitin and near Beth Aven, which he identifies as Burqah.87
In addition, Albright's identification of Beitin as Bethel followed Edward Robinson's
analysis of Eusebius/Jerome's Onomasticon. According to Onomasticon Bethel is located

12 miles (Roman) north of Jerusalem, going towards Sichem or Neapolis.88 However,
this orientation ultimately is still imprecise; it only points to a general area east of
Jerusalem and, if one measures from the Damascus gate based either by distance or by
the latest Roman mile markers set by Marcus Aurelius, one will end up in an area
between Beitin and Bireh/Birah.89 Robinson suggested that Bireh is the same as biblical
Beeroth, but Eusebius/Jerome indicates that Beeroth was 7 Roman miles north of
Jerusalem, not 12. According to Livingston, this would leave Bireh to be the only other
possibility for the true identity of Bethel. Not only does the strategic geographic location
of Bireh fit as an essential border city between Israel and Judah, Beth-Aven would also
be properly oriented to the west of Michmash in accordance with I Samuel 13-14 instead
of to the north as in the case of Et-Tell.90 Preliminary archaeological excavations at Bireh
have also resulted in large assemblages of Iron II pottery, which would fit the presumed
importance of Bethel as a border city and a religious center as described throughout the
biblical narratives. In contrast, according to William Dever excavations at Beitin have
yielded very little Iron II material, which makes the identification of Beitin as the cult
center of biblical Bethel very unlikely given the plentiful Iron II finds at Tel Dan.91 In
light of this new assumed location of Bethel at Bireh, one new possibility for the true
location of Joshua's Ai is Khirbet Nisya.

33
According to Joshua 7 Ai is supposed to be east of Bethel, and Khirbet Nisya is
indeed east of Bireh. Khirbet Nisya is also approximately 4-5 acres in size, which
satisfies the requirement of being smaller than Gibeon.92 In addition, there are artifacts
and potsherds from the MB II and LB I periods indicating settlement, and there is then a
period of abandonment in the LB II period before it is resettled in Iron I.93 Thus far,
Khirbet Nisya seems to be more likely Joshua's Ai than et-Tell. However, as of yet there
have not been any fortifications or gates found in the MBII or LB I period, and there has
been no evidence of a destruction or burn layer either.94 One could conclude, then, that
archaeologically there is still insufficient evidence to confirm beyond a reasonable doubt
that Khirbet Nisya could be Joshua's Ai, even if the geography and geological features
seem to match the biblical account.
Khirbet el-Maqatir, like Khirbet Nisya, is east of Bireh but it is only slightly west
of et-Tell. In addition, it is smaller than Gibeon, thus fulfilling the requirement set by
Joshua 10:2.95 Geographically, in accordance with Joshua 8 Khirbet el-Maqatir possesses
a valley to the north and a possible ambush site to the west.96 Perhaps more telling,
however, is that whereas Khirbet Nisya revealed no fortifications, excavations at Khirbet
el-Maqatir under Bryant Wood have yielded a small fortress made of inner and outer

rows of laid fieldstones with a solid stone core. The fortress also had a gate on the north
side of the fortress. Based on the pottery, the fortress was provisionally dated to Late
Bronze I as of the 1995-1998 excavations.97 As of the excavations from 2000, however,
ash layers in two parts of the site, calcined stones from the fortress, and re-fired LB I
pottery indicate a conflagration in the LB I period.98 Intriguingly, above the ash layer was
also a pile of twelve megalithic stones. Despite the uncanny number of stones, however,
it would be premature to immediately identify these stones as the pile Joshua raised as
said in Joshua 8:29 due to the fact that similar other megaliths were found throughout the
site as well.99
While Khirbet el-Maqatir's archaeological finds seem convincing, David
Livingston notes that unlike Khirbet Nisya, Khirbet el-Maqatir does not appear to have
any evidence of occupation during the Persian period. Ezra and Nehemiah both refer to
exiles returning from Babylon resettling in Ai which should result in evidence of a
Persian period occupation. In addition, since the return is a resettlement, there must have
been an Iron II occupation in Ai as well--and Khirbet el-Maqatir is lacking in that regard
as well. Even if the returning exiles to Ai in the Persian period were small in number and
may have settled in a nearby location instead, there is still the lack of Iron II remains that
presents a problem for el-Maqatir.100 Khirbet el-Maqatir instead appears abandoned
following the Iron I period all the way until the late Hellenistic and Hasmonean

35
periods.101 As a result, while both Livingston and Wood both agree that Bethel is el
Bireh, Livingston believes that el-Maqatir may be Beth Aven instead. First,
archaeologically the settlement periods and destruction layer correspond to Beth Aven.
Second, el-Maqatir faces the wilderness as Beth Aven does in Joshua 18:12-13. Third, el
Maqatir is also closer to Michmash than Beitin, making it a better candidate for Beth
Aven than Beitin based on I Samuel 13-14.102 Livingston's argument, of course, assumes
that Iron Age Ai was in fact settled by Israelites on the same location as Joshua's Ai.
Nonetheless, it would appear that Khirbet el-Maqatir seems to better match the biblical
accounts for the location of Ai better than et-Tell or Khirbet Nisya, but the matter is far
from concluded. Ultimately, Ai cannot currently be a reference point for the date of
Joshua’s conquest since the very location of the site is uncertain.
Archaeology of Hazor
Location of Hazor
Unlike Ai, the location of Hazor is not as much of a mystery partially due to a
significant number of biblical and ancient extra-biblical references to the city. However,
the earliest reference is found in the 19th century Egyptian execration texts listing Egypt's
potential enemies in its external provinces, followed by two letters discovered in the Mari
archives of the 18th century BCE. In addition, Hazor is listed as one of the conquered
cities under Thutmose III, Amenophis II, and Seti II as well as being mentioned in the
13th century Papyrus Anastasi I. In these letters, Hazor is the only city in the area that is
101 Wood, “Khirbet el-Maqatir, 2000,” 251.
102 Livingston, Khirbet Nisya, 210-212.



36
mentioned.103 Biblically speaking, in Joshua 11:10-11 Hazor is said to have been the head
of the northern kingdoms of Canaan under the rule of king Jabin and was burned by
Joshua. Judges 4:2, I Kings 9:15, II Kings 15:29 also reference the city of Hazor. The
latest historical reference to Hazor is seen in I Maccabees 11:6 where Jonathan fights
against Demetrius in 147 BCE.104 Clearly, Hazor was perceived as an important city by
multiple nations across centuries. Of all tells in the area, then, Tell el-Waqqas (el-Qedah)
is most certainly the best candidate for the proper location of Hazor based on its location
and prominence.105 Tell el-Qedah lies approximately 14 kilometers north of the Sea of
Galilee in the Huleh plain, holding a critical strategic location on the Via Maris and
comprises of more than 25 acres in area, making it larger than even Megiddo.106
Conquest or Local Uprising?
The relevant date of the city's demise seems to be unanimously 13th century,
which leaves the traditional 15th century date of Joshua's conquest as proposed by John
Garstang in a problematic position. Yigael Yadin's excavations of Area C of Hazor
uncovered a "well-built city" with houses and drainage systems that were filled with
Mycenaean pottery and other finds that date to the 13th century BCE. According to

Yadin, this was evidence that the main city met its demise in the 13th century.107 This
date was later confirmed by excavations under Meir Ben-Tor with the discovery of an
extensive burn layer which corresponds to the 13th century.108 While it has been
suggested that this destruction date better corresponds with the Egyptian conquests of the
late 13th and early 12th centuries, an interesting discovery of these excavations at Hazor
are 14th and 13th century palaces with seven Egyptian statues mutilated.109 Ben-Tor
argued that it would not make sense for an Egyptian ruler to do such a thing, but it would
make perfect sense if it was an Israelite ruler as a result of their anti-idol religion.110
The main issue of Hazor, however, is the nature of the destruction. Even if it may
be characteristic of Israelite rulers and conquerors to destroy idols of other religions, the
Israelites may not have been exclusive to this form of desecration. Firstly, more recent
excavations under Ben-Tor and Zuckerman have yielded no archaeological evidence of
warfare; nowhere in the site that corresponds to the time frame of the conflagration are
the remains of human victims or weapons.111 If the destruction of Hazor was caused by
any external force--be it Israelite, Egyptian, or any other--there should have been
evidence of struggle and warfare. Second, the temples of Hazor gradually saw less and
less maintenance after the city's zenith in the Late Bronze period. It was as if the rituals

38
and procedures required of the temple cults were neglected before being ultimately
destroyed.112 Third, Ben-Tor's more recent excavations show that it was the only
monumental structures like the Podium Complex and Royal Sanctuary that were
destroyed in the conflagration rather than the entire city.113 This contradicts Yadin's
original conclusion that the entire city was put to the torch in one cataclysm in the 13th
century, and as a result another explanation is warranted for the fact that not only was
Hazor only partially destroyed, the monumental buildings showed a clear indication of
gradual decline before being burned.114
Zuckerman has suggested that the destruction of the monumental and religious
buildings at Hazor can be categorized as "termination rituals," which she says were
conducted not by external conquerors but by the local community. It is obvious that
temples and religious objects represent power and the ruling institution, so it is only
natural that in any conquest against those symbols of power that they would be destroyed.
However, Zuckerman notes that there are two possible interpretations for such
destructions; the first, most typical of that of conquerors, would be simple desecration
and humiliation. The second, however, could be reverential in nature where one returning
to a destroyed site might bury the sacred items with respect.115 Whichever interpretation
is more accurate for the case of Hazor is still uncertain, but the gradual decline and

39
neglect of the monumental structures of Late Bronze Hazor seem to suggest that the cult
institutions at Hazor fell out of favor and were ultimately destroyed as evidenced by what
Zuckerman calls "religious crisis architecture.”116 The prospects of this interpretation and
its role in the understanding of the Joshua conquest narratives will be discussed in further
detail below.
Archaeology of Jericho
Location of Jericho
There is little doubt that the site of Jericho is Tell es-Sultan. Not only does the
neighboring modern village of Er-Riha still retain the original name of Jericho, the city
itself was a prominent location that was inhabited from before Neolithic times all the way
to the late second millennium.117 However, some have suggested that Tel es-Sultan is not
actually biblical Jericho, or that simple erosion prevented anything indicative of Joshua’s
time from being found by archaeologists. While entirely possible, as it is there is no solid
evidence for such claims.118 For example, excavations have revealed that there are Early
Bronze Age walls missing due to erosion even though there were walls present in even
earlier times. However, despite the erosion bits and pieces of the Early Bronze wall in the
trench below the tel have been found while absolutely no Late Bronze age pottery has

40
been found in the trench.119 Until another tel emerges as the real Jericho, Tel es-Sultan is
still the most likely place as Joshua 5 indicates that Joshua and the Israelites just crossed
the Jordan River to Gilgal, which is said to have been “on the plains of Jericho” in Joshua
5:10. Gilgal is just northeast of Jerusalem, and unless the locations of ancient Gilgal and
Jerusalem have been incorrectly placed, Tel es-Sultan must be Jericho of the biblical
narrative.
Preliminary excavations under Garstang and Kenyon
The first excavations of Jericho were conducted under Warren, Conder,
Kitchener, Sellin, and Watzinger. Their excavations did not discover a late Bronze Age
wall, however, and therefore found no evidence of a 15th century destruction of
Jericho.120 In the 1930s John Garstang continued excavations of Jericho. He believed the
Israelite conquest took place around 1400 BCE. A cartouche referencing Amenhotep III
(which he dated 1413 to 1377 BCE) was the latest of the 80 cartouches that he
discovered, and as a result Garstang concluded that the final occupation of the city ended
in the late 15th to early 14th century BCE.121 In addition, Garstang's excavations noted
that following Amenhotep's reign Jericho was no longer mentioned in the Amarna letters,
no additional royal signets were found, and no more imported Mycenaean pottery was

41
found. Occupation of Jericho seemed to continue after the sudden disappearance of
Egyptian rule, although it seems to have been only a small occupation.122 Most
importantly, however, Garstang is famously known for revealing walls that were "thrown
down" by an earthquake around 1400 BCE.123 Under Garstang's initial analysis, the
sudden end of Jericho could then be safely corresponded to the biblical narrative's
Israelite conquest under Joshua.
The excavations of Jericho under Kathleen Kenyon from 1952 to 1958 resulted in
some agreement with Garstang, but there was a major discrepancy in the dating of the
"thrown down" walls. Even though he did not attribute the earthquake that destroyed the
walls to be the same reason the entire city was destroyed, Garstang corresponded the
dates of both the destruction of the wall and of the city to around 1400 BCE.124 While
Kenyon agreed that it was fire and earthquake that ultimately destroyed the city, she
dated the demise of the city to the Middle Bronze Age (around 1550 BCE) rather than to
around 1400 BCE.125 The set of walls Garstang dated to be the Late Bronze Age wall was
re-dated by Kenyon to correspond centuries earlier to the Early Bronze Age, meaning that
the Late Bronze Age Jericho which corresponds to the traditional 1400 BCE conquest
date did not show any sort of destroyed city wall.126 Based on the lack of houses and
material found in Late Bronze Age Jericho and the re-use of tombs nearby, Kenyon then

42
concluded that while there may have been minor occupation in Jericho after the initial
destruction, Jericho was ultimately abandoned by the third quarter of the 14th century.127
If Kenyon's analysis is correct, the destruction date does not correspond to the traditional
biblical date, and even if one adopts the later 1200 BCE date for Joshua's conquest of
Jericho it would mean that Joshua attacked a more or less abandoned city.
Further excavations under Wood
More recent studies by Bryant Wood have shed new light on the same data found
by Garstang and Kenyon. Wood believes that the city's destruction Kenyon dated to 1550
BCE was a result of both Kenyon and Garstang failing to identify Cypriot bichrome
pottery that Garstang discovered in his excavations. This pottery, Wood argues, is clear
evidence of a Late Bronze Age occupation in Jericho and would likely have convinced
Kenyon to date the destruction to 1400 BCE.128 However, widespread destruction
patterns in Canaanite cities such as Hazor seem to point to 1200 BCE as a more likely
date of an Israelite conquest. For example, excavations from Tel Beit Mirsim, Tel ed
Dubeir (Lachish), and Bethel have shown that the clear destruction layers date to the late
13th century.129

43
Conclusions
As a result, if Jericho was destroyed by the Israelites in the 15th century, there is
little evidence of destruction in the entire region that could indicate an Israelite conquest.
Conversely, if the Israelites destroyed Hazor and caused the widespread destruction
patterns throughout the region in the 13th century (possibly including the destruction of
Ai), then Jericho could not have been destroyed in the same campaign. Assuming the
current archaeological picture is correct, it is clear that a traditional literalist
understanding of the historicity of Joshua is problematic regardless of whether one adopts
the 15th or 13th century dates for the destruction of these cities.

CHAPTER THREE
HARMONIZATION BETWEEN TEXT AND ARCHAEOLOGY
Even if new archaeological data confirms the destruction of the cities as
corresponding to the biblical conquest narrative it does not automatically mean it was
indeed a group of Israelites who caused it. Ethnogenesis of Israel is a large and
controversial debate on its own, however, and therefore will not be discussed in detail
here. Nonetheless, some defining characteristics (or lack thereof) of Israelites must be
identified before addressing interpretations and theories that resulted from the
archaeological data produced from excavations.
The first extra-biblical reference to Israel was believed to be found on the
Merneptah Stele and was initially dated to around 1200 BCE, but more recent studies by
Manfred Görg, Peter van der Veen and Christoffer Theis have suggested that an Egyptian
statue fragment contains a mention of "Israel" 200 years before the Merneptah stele.130 If
verified, it would indicate that an entity known as "Israel" existed at that time, but it
would only mean that a 15th century Israelite identity existed--not that the conquest
actually happened. In order to determine what can be considered “Israelite,” further
archaeological data is necessary.
In the late 1970s Amihai Mazar discovered a distinct form of collar rim jars that
dates to the 13th century BCE.131 In addition, excavations in the highland villages have
revealed that in the Iron I period a new form of “pillared house” became widely used.
130 Hershel Shanks, “When Did Ancient Israel Begin?” Biblical Archaeology Review 38 (January/February 2012): 61.
131 Dever, Who Were the Israelites, 81.



45
These two discoveries may indicate a new cultural or ethnic group entering the region,
and many scholars have identified these two features as being distinctly Israelite.
However, Michael Coogan notes that there is greater difference between 12th century
Megiddo and Tanaach than there is between Canaanites and supposed "Israelite"
settlements identified by the aforementioned features.132 This would mean that there is
little indication of anything that could be distinctly considered “Israelite.” Perhaps the
only exception appears in the Iron I period in which villages in the highlands were devoid
of any pig bones whereas the Philistines on the nearby coast raised and ate them in
plenty. This can only be explained by a clear difference in culture, which may very well
be indicative of an Israelite presence.133 Nonetheless, as these discoveries are dated to the
Iron I period, these also do little to verify any historicity to the Joshua conquest. In
general, without contemporary writings from the Israelites themselves such discoveries
only offer possibilities, for which the interpretations are myriad.
Interpreting the Archaeology
Israelite Ethnogenesis
The traditional approach to the interpretation of the archaeological finds regarding
the period of the Israelite conquest is simply that--an Israelite conquest, or "conquest
model." William Albright and G. Ernest Wright's interpretations defended such a model
132 Lawrence E. Stager, “Forging an Identity: The Emergence of Ancient Israel,” in The Oxford History of the Biblical World (ed. Michael D. Coogan; New York, N.Y.: Oxford University Press, 1998), 136-137.
133 Finkelstein and Silberman, The Bible Unearthed, 119.



46
based on older data. However, later excavations by Garstang, Kenyon, and others as
described above made the conquest model highly problematic and generally rejected by
most scholars.134 Even conservative scholars such as Kenneth Kitchen have rejected the
idea that all of Canaan was conquered in a single blitzkrieg campaign, instead suggesting
that the book of Joshua only mentions Jericho, Ai, and Hazor as being totally destroyed
while much of the land was still to be conquered.135
In the 1920s the German scholar Albrecht Alt suggested that the Israelites did not
violently conquer the Canaanites at all but were rather nomadic herders that eventually
settled into the land in a peaceful manner until a conflict of resources stirred some
skirmishes, formulating the "peaceful infiltration" model. This model accounts for the
lack of evidence for a single campaign that destroyed the Canaanite cities, but data from
the 1970s have shown that the herders and farmers were part of a single society rather
than distinct groups that came into conflict with each other when the herders settled
down.136 In 1962, then, George Mendenhall proposed a "peasant uprising" model that
views Israel not as nomads or conquerors but as native Canaanites that revolted against
the Late Bronze city states.137 After their overlords (and possibly their gods, which would
account for the intentionally-destroyed idols mentioned above) were overthrown, they
settled in the hill country, established their own new identity and eventually became the
Israelites. While this suspiciously Marxist theory is arguably possible given

137 Pfoh, The Emergence of Israel, 14.



47
archaeological data such as the results from recent excavations at Hazor, as of yet there is
insufficient evidence from the archaeology to fully validate it either.138
A fourth and emerging model, on the other hand, integrates all of the above
models and takes into account the evidence from both the archaeology and the biblical
text. William Dever suggests that the "Israelites" are, in fact, a "motley crew" consisting
of multiple ethnicities and backgrounds.139 Some groups may have left Egypt and
conquered cities, some may have been herders settling down, while others may have been
revolting Canaanites. What united them was a monotheistic faith in YHWH, which
eventually developed into the biblical tradition known today which included the Exodus
and conquest.140 Although Finkelstein and Silberman may not agree with Dever's model,
they too acknowledge that Joshua is a "literary expression of the desires and fantasies of a
people at a certain time and place" which, ironically, was compiled into its final form
during the time of Josiah–a name suspiciously similar to Joshua.141
Conclusions Regarding Israelite Ethnogenesis
Given both the historiographical debates and the archaeological evidence, the
mixed multitude theory seems to be most likely. There is evidence of some external
conquest such as with Jericho and Ai, some possible evidence of internal revolt that

48
resulted in collapse of some city states such as Hazor, and some migration and eventual
settlement of peoples in the land in which a new cultural group ultimately did emerge.
The greatest advantage of this model above the others is that it allows for vastly
different stories and material cultures to be rendered possible in the historical sense.
Dating of destruction layers or settlement patterns are no longer critical for historical
veracity because if one assumes the Joshua narrative is indeed a collection of different
stories, each story may have occurred at a different time and place and was simply
compiled together into a grand national epic. In addition, to appeal to a more traditional
approach, the Bible itself attests to the idea that the Israelites were indeed a "mixed
multitude" as seen in Exodus 12:38. The “drawback” of this interpretation is that it
indicates that the Joshua narratives possess fictive elements and do not present a
completely literal “history,” which in turn may strike at the belief systems of many
individuals in faith communities. That said, it cannot be dismissed as “ahistorical” either.
The campaigns and conquests very well could have been actual events, but were simply
depicted in a different fashion than that which a modern historian would expect of a
historical text.
Composition of the Joshua Narrative
Authorship and Date
Much of any text's perceived intent depends on its authorship and date of
composition, however, and the book of Joshua itself appears to be just as much a "mixed
multitude" as the Israelites it describes. Joshua is not only one of the Former Prophets, it



49
is also the final book of the Hexateuch and has been suggested to be part of the
Deuteronomistic History as described above.142 The Hexateuch, according to von Rad,
essentially centers around a "history of redemption" that goes over how God created the
world, promised the patriarchs the land of Canaan and then led the Israelites out of
Egypt.143 The Deuteronomistic History has been viewed as the product of a school of
Mosaic reformers from the time of Josiah to the Exile with intent of explaining the
destruction of Jerusalem.144 Most scholars have noted how the district divisions in Joshua
seem very much based on Josiah's kingdom, and combined with the concept of Israel's
sanctity and unity of the land of Israel it would seem that the formation of Joshua as we
know it is firmly grounded in Deuteronomistic ideology.145
However, one problem with identifying Joshua as a "Deuteronomistic historical
work" is that while the Deuteronomistic recension may have been compiled in its final
form during or after the time of Josiah, the fact that Joshua does not mention in any way
the unification of the cult with a single chosen place of worship suggests that the Former
Prophets as a whole are not a unified work and each book must still be treated as distinct.
Even though Joshua does contain elements of D and P stylistically, this does not
necessarily mean there is a dependence upon the Pentateuch–only that Joshua contains
some material from those who wrote in the style of D. In addition, the late recensions and
narration of the destruction of Jerusalem seen in Kings is absent from Joshua, Judges, and

50
Samuel, indicating that Kings was compiled after Josiah's period while the other three
books were not.146
In essence, it would appear that the book of Joshua as it appears today is too much
the work of a process with the influence and mark of multiple traditions for a single
author and simple date of composition of the book to be assigned here. Even if the final
form of the book of Joshua was only completed in Josiah's time, the story of Joshua may
have been known and passed down orally long before then. Of course, it is probably
impossible to determine the exact content of any oral tradition beyond what is received
through the texts. As a result, the intent of the book of Joshua will only be looked at in its
final form in the comparison with Sargon of Akkad.
Interpreting “All the Land”
In light of its place in the rest of the Hebrew Bible, there remains the question as
to why Joshua seems to portray a contradictory picture to the following biblical books.
Joshua, on a first reading, appears to portray a complete conquest of Palestine while the
book of Judges suggests that the conquest was only partial. The usual solution to this was
to posit different traditions to the two books; in this interpretation Joshua could be from a
unique perspective of a D editor.147 A more likely possibility is that Joshua's conquest,
although appearing to have been written as a "complete" conquest, is instead an account
of a temporary conquest that employs hyperbole in the same manner as other Ancient
146 Yehezkel Kaufmann, The Biblical Account of the Conquest of Canaan (Jerusalem, Israel: The Magnes Press, 1985), 19-20.
147 Younger, Ancient Conquest Accounts, 242-243.



51
Near Eastern conquest accounts. In comparison to other Mesopotamian literature, the use
of hyperbole is in fact typical of conquest transmission codes. For example, the use of the
phrase "all the land" may be a hyperbole, but the 10 year annals of Mursili II uses the
same phrase.148 In a similar vein, as mentioned above, the title "šar-kiššati" came to mean
"king of the universe," but clearly it must be understood as hyperbole as no
Mesopotamian ruler has conquered the "whole universe." As a result, if one compares
Joshua to other conquest accounts of the Ancient Near East, the contradiction between
Joshua and Judges is harmonized; neither book need be dismissed on historical grounds
due to hyperbole any more than one would dismiss the historicity of Egyptian accounts
when they say "the king dispatched."149 A third possibility is that the narratives describe
only the land’s subjugation and not its occupation. In this interpretation, the cities were
only destroyed by the Israelites; they were not occupied by the Israelites until much
later.150 However, this interpretation does not solve the problem of the different
destruction dates of Ai, Hazor, and Jericho.
An Alternative Reading
If one accepts the mixed multitude theory and the idea of a national epic compiled
from many separate stories or traditions as a result of the archaeological evidence, one
could view Joshua as something of a mythical or legendary character instead of a purely
literal historical character in order to harmonize the biblical narrative and archaeological
148 Ibid., 246-251.
149 Ibid., 266.
150 Provan, Long, and Longman, A Biblical History of Israel, 167.



52
record. In this understanding Joshua son of Nun may have indeed been a real living
figure, but in the writing of the biblical narratives Joshua became known and remembered
to be far more than who he was in person. In order to unite the “mixed multitude” under a
single Yahwistic faith during the time of Israel’s formation, one clever method of
unifying the hearts and minds of the diverse peoples would have been to attribute the
conquests and victories of all the diverse groups to a single, legendary hero (whose very
name “YHWH is salvation” suggests the character’s unifying intent) in a single national
epic that depicts an idyllic time. The value of this interpretation based on context is that
in it the current archaeological data and the biblical text can be harmonized; in this theory
the destruction dates of Jericho, Hazor, and Ai do not correspond to a single time period
simply because they were destroyed by different groups under the leadership of various
individuals but the credit of the cities’ destruction was given to Joshua alone. In order to
validate this literary feature of biblical writing with the contextual method, however, it is
necessary to see whether or not such a literary feature can be found in other Ancient Near
Eastern literature. As a result, the following section will demonstrate how the legacy of
the legendary Sargon of Akkad provides an example of this literary feature by going over
some of the features from texts regarding Sargon.



53
CHAPTER FOUR
SURVIVING TEXTS OF SARGON OF AKKAD
Texts from the Sargonic Period
As already mentioned above, one major difference between the texts of Sargon
and those of Joshua is that Sargon has contemporary texts that survived. Sargonic period
inscriptions mentioning Sargon of Akkad can be found on stelae, stamps, pottery, and
seals both in original form and in copies. Even without cross-references from other texts,
from the inscriptions of Sargon and his dynasty alone one can already see the extent of
his campaigns whereas without the biblical text Joshua's very existence and Israelite
campaign would likely have been left completely unknown through the ages. Due to the
great quantity of texts, for organization's sake the following overview will summarize
only the contents of some of the texts.
Perhaps the most foundational conquest of Sargon was the city of Uruk. Two
tablet copies of an inscription (E.1.1.1) from Nippur describe Sargon's defeat of Lugal
zagesi, king of Uruk. In this text Sargon is said to have conquered Ur, Eninmar, Lagash,
and Umma. In addition, Sargon is said to have been given the "Upper Sea" and "Lower
Sea." Interestingly Mari and Elam are also said to have "stood in obedience" before
Sargon in this text, and Sargon is said to have united two parts of Kish into one city
before the inscription concludes with a curse to anyone who removes the inscription.151
151 Douglas Frayne, Sargonic and Gutian Periods: (2334-2113 BC) (RIME 2; Toronto, Canada: University of Toronto Press, 1993), 9-12.



54
Several other inscriptions, including one inscribed on a statue, likewise describe Sargon's
conquest of Uruk and Ur.152
Several other inscriptions record also a second military campaign eastward
against Elam and Parahšum. Two texts essentially list the locations conquered, one of
them (E.1.1.8) mentioning the city of Arawa which lies on the western edge of Elam. As
a result this was most likely the first major step in Sargon's conquest eastward. When
Susa and its region fell to Sargon, it seems as though this marked the total conquest of
Elam as evidenced by Sargon's title "conqueror of Elam and Parahšum" as seen in the
text.153 Other references to this campaign are seen in both Akkadian and Sumerian texts
from Nippur. Another inscription (E.1.1.12) explains how Dagān gave Sargon Ebla in
addition to Mari, suggesting that Sargon's campaigns extended much further west to the
upper Euphrates as well.154
Although the Telloh victory stele (AO 2679), consisting of both a relief and
inscription probably is not datable to the time period of Sargon himself it does appear to
date to Sargonic periods based on art-historical grounds and bears some worth in
mentioning.155 It is a fragmented text and the name of the king seems to have been
intentionally destroyed. What remains, however, seems to say "-uš," so it has been
suggested that the smiting king depicted in the relief is Rimuš, son of Sargon of

55
Akkad.156 Naram-Sin, grandson of Sargon of Akkad, is depicted as wearing a wrist band
in one victory stele in the same manner of the figure on the Telloh stele, further
supporting the idea that the inscription dates to Sargonic periods.157 Interpretation-wise,
the relief itself seems to depict a king in the act of smiting which would suggest a
military conquest and subjugation of slaves, while the surviving text speaks only of land
distribution.158 The significance of this will be discussed further below.
Chronicles of Sargon
Sumerian King List
While the Sumerian King List does add more details for certain figures beyond
the name and length of reign such as profession and achievements, of all kings in the
Sumerian King List Sargon of Akkad was clearly perceived to be someone special. The
description of Sargon's father's profession, Sargon's profession before kingship, and his
accomplishment of building Akkade are mentioned, indicating that there was circulation
of his stories.159 It is possible that the very act of founding Akkade is in itself a
declaration of independence from Ur-Zababa king of Kish, under whom Sargon served as
cupbearer. The importance of the Sumerian King List, in addition to its special treatment
of Sargon, is also in the fact that is the only chronology of the Sumerian kings.

158 Ibid., 25-29.
159 Van de Mieroop, Cuneiform Texts, 64.



56
Unfortunately, the reliability of the document's contents cannot yet be verified.160 In
addition, there is some difficulty with the exact chronology in dating Sargon's ascension
to the throne due to the fact that there is no date list in the Sumerian King List. Currently
it is impossible to know if the 56-year reign of Sargon began when he acceded to the
throne in Akkade or whether he became king of Akkade later.161
Chronicle of Early Kings
The Chronicle of early Kings is a first millennium document that recounts
Sargon's campaigns. The text itself seems partially derived from earlier omen texts, and
covers the reigns of Sargon of Akkad to Agum III, who reigned sometime around 1450
BCE.162 In this document Sargon is depicted as a great conqueror without rival who
conquers lands both east and west, clearly depicting something on an idealized character
from a first millennium perspective.163 In Chronicle of Early Kings Sargon is said to have
"crossed the Sea in the east" possibly reflecting a tradition of Sargon as other texts such
as the Sargon Geography seem to agree.164 It also says that Naram-Sin, "son of Sargon,"
conquered Apisal and Magan. Of course, even though the Sumerian King list says Rimuš
and Maništušu were sons of Sargon, here Naram-Sin is said to be Sargon's son rather than

his grandson. It would seem as if the two kings between Sargon and Naram-sin were
overshadowed by their significance, and consequently had their accomplishments
conflated into the reigns of Sargon and Naram-sin instead.165
Weidner Chronicle
Although it is labeled a chronicle, the Weidner Chronicle (also known as the
"Chronicle of Esagila") portrays a very different picture of Sargon than other chronicles
and overall seems to have a different purpose than other chronicles. The text itself is
written from the perspective of the Esagila cult regarding Sargon of Akkad's
accomplishments and eventual downfall. It portrays Sargon as a significant figure, but
unlike the other texts regarding Sargon the Weidner Chronicle clearly depicts Sargon in
far less of an idealistic light even though some repeated phrases regarding his greatness
are seen in the first few lines. In this text Sargon's building of Akkad from the soil of
Babylon was an act of pride, and subsequently caused his kingdom's downfall.166
However, in light of other texts concerning Sargon of Akkad it would seem as if his
dynasty did not suffer the same catastrophe recorded in the Weidner Chronicle, and
therefore the text was probably intended to be didactic rather than historical, even by
ancient standards. As a result, the Weidner Chronicle can be considered religious
propaganda by the Esagila cult concerning the offenses of kings against the temple of

Marduk in Babylon.167 Similarly, the Chronicle of the Reign of Sargon says that Sargon
won favor with Ishtar and marched against Kasalla and Subartu, but built Akkad from the
soil of Babylon. As a result of this, Marduk was angered and caused a famine in the land
and the people consequently opposed him.168 The reference to the destruction of Kasalla
and Subartu is also mentioned in the Chronicle of Early Kings, so while the Weidner
Chronicle and Chronicle of the Reign of Sargon may be religious propaganda, it is likely
they borrowed from other traditions that portrayed Sargon in a more idyllic light.
Sargon Geography
The Sargon Geography is partially preserved in two tablets, one Neo Assyrian
(VAT 8006) and one Late Babylonian duplicate (BM 64382+82955). While the text says
Sargon's empire essentially covered the entire earth’s surface, there are specific names
that provide a possible perception of the Mesopotamian cosmic world and of Sargon's
own empire.169 It describes the various regions he controlled by either identifying border
points or listing the size of each region.170 Based on its close connection with traditional
and legendary literature, however, the Sargon Geography is most likely a literary text
instead of a practical document. As such it is most likely the work of a later author who
used multiple sources including omens and legends such as the Sargon Birth Legend.171

59
The Neo-Assyrian period seems the likely date due to the use of the term "Hanaean" and
others, which are terms only used in Neo-Assyrian texts. As a result, the composition
itself may have been sometime after the 3rd millennium but it is clear that there was
editing done in the 1st millennium. In addition, Akkad is mentioned four times and Mari
twice; this repetition was most likely in order to interpret the empire of Sargon's empire
in Neo-Assyrian terms and for edification of Sargon II of Assyria.172 As also evidenced
by the Neo-Babylonian copy, traditions of Sargon of Akkad's power were still a matter of
interest all the way into the 1st millennium BCE.173
Legends of Sargon
Sumerian Sargon Legend
As already mentioned, in the Sumerian King List Sargon of Akkad was the
cupbearer of Ur-Zababa, king of Kish. The Sumerian Sargon Legend is essentially a
literary narrative detailing how Sargon rose to the throne, although the surviving
fragments do not contain the entire story. Despite the literary nature of this legend, the
Sumerian Sargon legend does not have fictive historical elements in the same way as
other legends such as the Curse of Akkad. The Sumerian King List confirms the main
events of the Sumerian Sargon Legend in that it chronicles how Sargon took over Ur
Zababa's kingdom in northern Babylonia and then defeated Lugalzagesi of Uruk which
172 Ibid., 93.
173 Van Seters, In Search of History, 85.



60
was in southern Babylonia.174 Essentially, the Sumerian Sargon Legend can be
considered a literary adaptation of real historical events, but does not give additional
historical information regarding the rise of Sargon that is not seen in other texts.
Sargon Birth Legend
As already discussed, the genre of naru-literature, or fictional autobiography, is a
literary composition written in the first person and resembles royal inscriptions with
blessing and curse formulas toward the end.175 Interestingly the autobiographic prose
introduction in naru-literature such as the Sargon Birth Legend resembles the opening
statement of the code of Hammurabi in that the structure and content is very similar.176
The introduction in the Sargon Birth Legend indicates that his mother was a priestess,
and that he never knew who his father was. Following this, the legend then evokes a
rather familiar tradition that involves Sargon being placed in a basket as an infant and
floated down a river to preserve his life before he is adopted by Aqqi the water-drawer.
Sargon would then become a gardener, gaining the favor of Ishtar before becoming king.
After a list of accomplishments Sargon then challenges future kings to do likewise. In
the final surviving section, the legend oddly concludes with a string of rhetorical
questions with metaphors involving animals and natural forces.177

176 Ibid., 55.
177 Westenholz, Legends of the Kings of Akkade, 39-41.



61
The date of composition of the Sargon legend was at first believed to have been
contemporary with Sargon, but more recently scholars have realized it was a later
composition rather than a royal inscription.178 The introduction of origins, infant
exposure tale, and epilogue that resembles a blessing oracle all seem to suggest that the
author used multiple traditions as source material. As a result, the date of composition is
difficult to determine but it is most certainly written after the Old Akkadian period.179
Theoretically, the Sargon Birth Legend could have been written any time between the
reigns of Sargon and Assurbanipal. Arguments for an earlier date (that is, first half of
second millennium) include traces of early traditions found in the Sargon legend and the
fact that pseudo-autobiography has been found in the first half of the second millennium,
while the use of later vocabulary and lack of archaisms indicate a much later date. Either
way, the purpose of the text is also unclear. The blessing formula toward the end
challenges future kings to emulate Sargon, so perhaps the moral was simply that if one
wishes to rule as well as Sargon did one should emulate him.180 Other possibilities
include simple scholarly interest, entertainment, or even for comparing contemporary
kings with Sargon.181 Ultimately, the purpose of the Sargon Birth Legend does not appear
to be the recounting of past events, but there are historical elements within the legend that
are attested in other texts such as the 56-year reign and conquest of Tilum and Der.182

Other References to Sargon
Omens, Seals, and other Narratives
There are many other texts regarding Sargon that are neither chronicles nor
legends, and some of them are probably much older than either the chronicles or legends.
As mentioned above, it has been suggested that omens could have provided much of the
source material for chronicles. Whether or not that is correct, omens of Sargon are among
the older surviving texts. For example, one of the oldest haruspical superstitions mentions
Kish and Sargon, inscribed on a clay liver. This text most likely is an omen text
foreshadowing the rise of Sargon the cupbearer against the king of Kish Lugal-zagesi.183
Other older inscriptions on seals and stamps that likely date to the Sargonic period
include references to Sargon's family; these texts tell of his wife TašLULtum, his son SU
Enlil, and the entu priestess En-hedu-ana, Sargon's daughter.184 Such details from omen
texts and other inscriptions may provide further background information on the actual
person of Sargon, and as a result are essential to seeing the contrast between the person
and the legend.
Narratives such as "Sargon the Conquering Hero" and "Sargon in Foreign Lands"
are neither particularly mythical in nature nor a chronicle, and as a result can probably
simply be considered a "historical-literary" composition. The contents of "Sargon the
Conquering Hero" primarily concern the military campaign into Uta-rapaštim and the

63
land of Simurrum, but also contains inspirational speeches by Sargon, his army's
champion, and one of the king's servants.185 "Sargon in Foreign Lands" is similar in that
Sargon once again speaks to his troops in regards to another military campaign and even
mentions the darkening of the sun during the battle. The text itself is rather fragmented,
however, and much of the story is missing or unclear.186
A Hittite Reference
One additional luxury to Sargon's legacy that Joshua does not share is a cross
reference seen in Anatolia. While Sargon's legend was popular for two millennia in both
Anatolia and Egypt, Hattusili I of Hatti mentions the campaign of Sargon of Akkad.187 In
his inscription regarding Sargon of Akkad, Hattusili I says Sargon crossed the Mala
(river) and defeated the army of Hahha but did not destroy the city itself. In addition,
Sargon's campaigns into Anatolia are mentioned in various texts including the "King of
Battle" narrative where Sargon crosses a river to attack Hahhum, possibly referring to the
same event as Hattusili. What this demonstrates is a familiarity of Sargon of Akkad
among the Hittite kings, and the fact that this text appears to be annalistic rather than
literary means that there was most likely a "historical tradition" passed down through
seven centuries between Sargon and Hattusili I.188 Clearly, the perception was that

Sargon was a great conqueror in the historical sense extended far beyond the reaches of
his geographic kingdom.

CHAPTER FIVE
ARCHAEOLOGICAL REMAINS OF SARGON OF AKKAD
Location of Akkad
Unlike Jericho and Hazor, the exact location of Akkad remains unknown. Based
on the use of Old Akkadian in Sargonic texts, it is most likely that the city lies
somewhere in the area of the confluence of the Diyala and Tigris rivers.189 Perhaps the
main proponent of this attribution is Christophe Wall-Romana who bases this location not
only on the use of Old Akkadian but also on the texts themselves.
Textual Analysis
The first thing Wall-Romana notes is that the name Agade probably existed
before Sargon even if it does not appear among pre-Sargonic texts as the name "Agade"
probably is a re-used name of a small insignificant town before being rebuilt by Sargon.
Another distinct aspect of the city of Agade under Sargon, however, was that it depended
primarily on commercial expansion and administration instead of agricultural production,
so Agade must have been located in relation to commercial arteries that linked Lower
Mesopotamia to the west, north, east, and especially southeast since that is where the
Akkadian kings developed their commercial axis after Sargon.190
189 Frayne, Sargonic and Gutian Periods, 5.
190 Christophe Wall-Romana, “An Areal Location of Agade,” Journal of Near Eastern Studies 49 (1990): 207-209.



66
Wall-Romana notes that most Assyriologists believed Akkad was located along a
branch of the Euphrates as most cities of Lower Mesopotamia before the Seleucids were
located there, but Wall-Romana argues that textually speaking there is no evidence
linking Akkad to the Euphrates. First, he notes that the "Curse of Akkade," which dates
no later than the Ur III period, references a harbor and ships from Meluhha and Magan;
the only river mentioned in the entire composition is the Tigris. Second, the idiom "Tigris
and Euphrates" that is normally used to refer to the "whole of Sumer" is not used in a text
from Utu-Hegel regarding the conquest of the king of Gutium--only the Tigris is
mentioned, and the Gutian conquest was mostly restricted to the land of Akkad.191 Third,
texts from the Sumerian Temple Hymns, the Hiza text, Sutruk Nahhunte text, and an
inscription from Nebuchadnezzer all suggest that Akkad was located at the intersection of
the Tigris and Diyala rivers.192 Finally, Cyrus of Persia also refers to Akkad as "across
the Tigris," and due to his vantage point from Babylonia Akkad could not have been at
the Euphrates.193
Geographic Analysis
Based on the textual parameters discussed above, Wall-Romana concludes that
Tel Muhammed (Adams' site 414) is the most likely location of Akkad in the area based
on the size and occupation span. From a geographical standpoint, Wall-Romana also
notes that there is a line of tels heading southwest from the Diyala river, ultimately
191 Ibid., 209-212.
192 Ibid., 219-235.
193 Ibid., 216.



67
reaching the Tigris river at none other than site 414. The tels along the line were all
founded in Akkadian times, suggesting they were built along a canal in order for Akkad
to be linked with the Diyala branch.194 However, the settlement distribution during the
Early Dynastic and Akkadian periods indicates that the mean location center of site
distribution is just northeast of Kish and Ishan Mizyad, 50 kilometers south of Tel
Muhammed. In addition, half of all settlements in the region of Akkad fall within 33
kilometers of Kish and Ishan Mizyad.195 Another interesting point with Ishan Mizyad is
that it is situated in a swampy basin-depression only 15 kilometers northeast of Babylon,
and based on the Weidner Chronicle's reference to essu, or "back-swamps," it is possible
Ishan Mizyad is the actual location of Akkad.196
A brief note on Babylon and Baghdad is warranted as well as it is possible Akkad
was simply built over and renamed. It has been suggested that Babylon is a synonym for
Akkad based on the Babylonian Chronicle that says Esarhaddon rebuilt Akkad, but there
is no evidence that one city's name was used to designate another city. In addition,
according to Nabonidus Esarhaddon restored the Eulmash temple in Agade, but no
temple of that name existed in Babylon.197 Baghdad is a different story, however; the
name "Baghdad" itself retains the phonetic segment "aγda," which is seen in the word
"Agade" as well.198 Baghdad is fairly close to Tel-Muhammed, and the trade routes on

68
the Tigris/Diyala confluence were used both in ancient Akkad in the 3rd millennium BCE
and in Baghdad.199 Unfortunately, current archaeology of ancient Baghdad is lacking and
will most likely remain that way for some time.
Material Analysis
From a material standpoint, it would appear that the location of Akkad may have
been further south along the Tigris River at Qadisiyah rather than the Diyala region.
Westenholz (1999) already suggested that Akkad should be located around the
confluence of the Tigris and Adheim rivers, so the material analysis from Qadisyah
further support this theory. In addition, an Old Akkadian site with a royal building has
been identified along the Adheim, so it is possible that Akkad is located along this region.
What will further support this identification would be evidence of 3rd millennium
imported stone statues, and of the sites in the region discovered so far, Qadisiyah has
perhaps the largest.200 The stones from the fragments and stelae from the late 3rd
millennium BCE are generally black and grey, often with a greenish tinge. The use of this
kind of hard, dark material for monuments was largely established by none other than the
Old Akkadian emperors.201 The statue from Qadisiyah itself has rather simpler fringes
compared to those from the period of Maništušu, so the date probably better corresponds

201 Ibid., 258-260.



69
with Sargon or his son Rimuš.202 As a result, the material evidence from Qadisiyah makes
it yet another possible candidate for the ancient city of Akkad.
Real Estate Management
Since the city of Akkad itself cannot offer any insight as to the legacy of Sargon
himself due to its still-elusive location, evidence from the empire of Sargon may yet
provide some answers as to the historical reliability of the texts concerning Sargon of
Akkad. As already discussed above, the texts concerning Sargon of Akkad say that he
conquered Uruk, Elam, Mari, and Simurrum. Furthermore, a list of cult centers appearing
in the En-hedu-ana compilation of temple hymns suggests Sargon's empire stretched from
Eridu in the south to Hiza on the middle Tigris in the North, and from Kazallu in the west
to Der in the East.203 Without these texts, there would arguably be little evidence to
suggest even the existence of the Sargonic empire. However, Benjamin Foster has
suggested that an analysis of the real estate management described in Sargonic texts (the
Telloh Stele in particular) can offer a general idea of the extent of the Sargonic empire.
The Telloh fragment (AO 2679) disposes approximately 133,979 hectares in the Lagash
region, with each city approximately taking up 78 square kilometers while there are only
half as many agricultural centers. Eight of the major agricultural centers consist of
perhaps 2 percent of all arable land in Babylonia. To put this in perspective, the
enormous area managed by the great Kassite temple is only 52,488 hectares and the
entirety of the land granted by Kurigalzu to the Ishtar temple is only a third of the size of
202 Ibid., 262-264.
203 Frayne, Sargonic and Gutian Periods, 7-8.



70
the Sargonic domain. In addition, the estate of Mesag, a dignitary in Umma-Lagash
during Naram-Sin's time, was only 1,270 hectares.204 Even if these texts were
exaggerations, the Telloh stele clearly speaks of far greater proportions of real estate
management and suggests that the Sargonic empire was indeed enormous by
contemporary standards.
Surviving Texts and Transmission
Much like biblical literature, texts concerning Sargon of Akkad often have
sources, are copied, and are written from different periods and copied in different
locations. For example, the Sargon Birth Legend tablets were copied for practice of
scribes in learning on practice tablets such as BM 47449.205 Sargon himself did erect
statues commemorating his feats in the courtyard of the Ekur, Enlil's temple in Nippur.
These texts remained there until at least the early second millennium, and even though
new dynasties controlled Nippur the statues were not destroyed. It is possible that
following the Gutian invasion the Akkadian kings had already attained a legendary status
and their statues were therefore not destroyed, but preserving statues of even hated
figures is not something unheard of in those days. Regardless, copies of the statue
inscriptions survived even if the statues themselves eventually were destroyed. Although
the surviving texts are poorly preserved, there are no less than sixteen texts from Sargon's

71
statues. Two such manuscripts contain inscriptions from Sargon, Rimuš, and Maništušu
on a single tablet.206 In addition, most records of Sargon's campaigns in Syria survive
only in copies.207 Interestingly one copy of "King of Battle" written in Akkadian was
found at el Amarna, and a number of paraphrased fragments of the text were also found
in Hattusa. The story was probably a second-millennium Babylonian text that was
exported to Hatti and Egypt along with some other texts; their survival into the first
millennium further indicate Sargon's enduring fame.208

CHAPTER SIX
COMPARISON AND CONTRAST BETWEEN JOSHUA AND SARGON
Attribution of Credit
Legacy of Sargon
From the textual evidence already discussed there is no doubt that Sargon of
Akkad, although already impressive based on the remains of his empire, was regarded as
a larger-than-life figure. It is possible that the legends of Sargon were written in the time
of the two Assyrian kings that named themselves after him, possibly for the sake of
comparing themselves to the original Sargon.209 Not only is there evidence of Egyptian
and Hittite traditions of Sargon that lasted two thousand years, Sumerian mythological
legends regarding Sargon, and special treatment seen in Mesopotamian chronicles,
Sargon of Akkad was also deified from the third millennium BCE all the way until the
Persian period. Although deification of kings is commonly seen in ancient Mesopotamia,
few kings can rival the duration of the cult of Sargon of Akkad, further displaying the
extent of his fame.210 Case in point, Shamshi-Adad, an Amorite king who lived in the
early 18th century and unified northern Mesopotamia, interestingly called himself "King
of Akkad." He even set up statues of Sargon and Naram-Sin in Mari and offered sheep to
them in homage to the legendary kings of the Akkad dynasty.211
209 Lewis, The Sargon Legend, 102.
210 Van de Mieroop, Cuneiform Texts, 63-67.
211 Ibid., 65.



73
This is not to say that Sargon was universally loved as an ideal figure; not only
did the Esagila cult portray him as a flawed character as mentioned above, in the early
days of his reign he, unsurprisingly, had many political opponents. When Lugal-zagesi of
Uruk and Urukagina of Lagash fought against each other, neither side found allies.
However, when Lugal-zagesi battled against Sargon he was able to rally many allies to
fight Sargon. In addition, the city of Nippur apparently bitterly opposed Sargon despite
his attempts to follow Sumerian tradition. This could have been because he himself was
not a Sumerian, but it could also be a result of the fact that Sargon was seen as far more
than another "Great King" like Lugal-zagesi; an emperor like Sargon would likely
diminish the power of the Sumerian ruling cadres and even threaten their "ideological
base of existence.”212 It was the Akkadians that viewed Sargon as the divine figure, not
the Sumerians. Yet even among Akkadians Kish and Kazallu fought against Sargon and
Kish even tried to gain independence from Naram-Sin. Ultimately, with the Akkadian
empire under the Sargonic dynasty being the most successful and with Akkadian
language becoming the lingua franca of most of the Ancient Near East for millennia, the
general perception of Sargon was overwhelmingly positive, even if it was not absolutely
everyone. Indeed, the Akkadians in general eventually regarded Sargon as something of a
"messiah.”213
212 Westenholz, Legends of the Kings of Akkade, 110.
213 Ibid., 111.



74
Sargon and Naram-Sin
The most significant feature of discussion of Sargon's legacy in comparison with
Joshua son of Nun, however, lies in the fact that Sargon is credited not only with feats
and exploits far beyond Mesopotamian confines, but also with the accomplishments of
other individuals. As mentioned above the Chronicle of Early Kings actually ignores the
reigns of Rimuš and Maništušu, mentioning only Sargon and Naram-Sin while calling
Naram-Sin the "son of Sargon.”214 As a result, it is likely that both figures were regarded
as legendary, larger-than-life figures. However, it is sometimes difficult to determine
whether a particular accomplishment was actually Sargon's work; in some cases the
textual and material evidence suggests that some of the accomplishments of Sargon
actually belong to Naram-Sin. First, based on Sargon's inscriptions it is clear that he did
not reach beyond Tuttul on the Middle Euphrates and only had minor contacts with lands
further north-west while archaeological and textual evidence suggests that Naram-Sin
was in actuality the one who expanded in that direction. Nonetheless, in "King of Battle,"
Sargon is the one who attacked the Anatolian city of Purushhanda rather than Naram-Sin.
While it is possible that Sargon simply did not leave any archeological material or that
Naram-Sin ignored Sargon's accomplishments, it is more likely that Sargon is regarded
by "King of Battle" as a "model to be imitated.”215 A similar case is seen in the city of
Ebla; as already discussed above there are texts saying that Sargon took the city. This
conquest was at first thought to be confirmed by the discovery of a burnt palace in Tell
214 Cooper, The Curse of Agade, 17.
215 Liverani, “Model and Actualization,” 52-53.



75
Mardikh in western Syria, but there was once again no archaeological material to suggest
Sargon's involvement while Naram-Sin also says he conquered Ebla.216
While Sargon's legends such as the Sargon Birth Legend portray Sargon as a
glorious king with no rival, the legends of Naram-Sin seem to portray Naram-Sin as a
morally questionable king. The Cuthean Legend of Naram-Sin, a pseudo-autobiography,
speaks of how Naram-Sin's kingdom is invaded by bird people and inquires of gods but is
given negative oracles, and therefore ignores them. He then questions himself as his
kingdom falls, but Ea intercedes and Naram-Sin eventually emerges victorious. In this
tale the main moral is that one must heed the diviners or suffer the consequences as
Naram-Sin did.217 The third millennium text "Curse of Akkad," similarly, concerns the
mistakes of Naram-Sin, even beginning with a summary of Sargon's greatness--almost as
if in order to provide contrast to Naram-Sin.218 Essentially, the story involves Naram-Sin
destroying the Ekur temple, resulting in the anger of the gods and the subsequent
destruction of Akkad.219 While the "Curse of Akkad" glorifies the destruction of Akkad,
the text itself is not anti-Akkadian per se. Rather, it was more likely didactic like the
Cuthean Legend of Naram-Sin. Historically speaking, the contents of the "Curse of
Akkad" were more than likely fictional. In the Ur III period statues of Sargonic kings
were honored at the Ekur itself; Naram-Sin in actuality rebuilt the Ekur rather than

76
destroyed it as the narrative suggests.220 The reason for this could have been because
Naram-Sin tried to relocate old local cults to Akkad, and in doing so anger the
Sumerians. The fall of Akkad in reality happened in the time of Naram-Sin's son
Šarkališharri, but in an inversely-similar manner to Sargon Naram-Sin is the one blamed
for the destruction of Akkad.221 All things considered, Naram-Sin's actual
accomplishments more than likely rivaled those of Sargon of Akkad, but in these legends
he is instead regarded as the reason for the end of the idyllic age despite the older omens
of Naram-Sin depicting a far more favorable picture.222
Sargon as Type
Etymology "Šarru-kin "
While it has already been established that Sargon is an example of a figure who is
given the credit of other individuals' accomplishments, some mention of the etymologies
of the names "Sargon" and "Joshua" will further illustrate the legendary figures of both
individuals. The name Sargon is a transliteration of "šarru-kin," meaning "the true king."
The name itself is first seen in the 3rd millennium BCE on the Maništušu Obelisk and
other Sumerian inscriptions from the Ur III period. In addition, it is found as an element
in a number of Old Akkadian personal names of the Ur III period such as "šar-ru-GI-i
li.”223 Yigal Levin says that this is clearly a throne-name and not the actual name of

Sargon given the political circumstances of the time. When Sargon attempted a coup
against Ur-Zababa, he probably failed the coup despite killing Ur-Zababa and was
therefore exiled to Akkad. To further legitimize himself, then, it is possible Sargon took
the name "true king.”224 However, Douglas Frayne disagrees, as the appearance of the
Old Akkadian name Šarru-Dan provides a possible parallel.225 After all, any personal
name could have any number of possible origins; biblical names such as "Abimelech"
imply royalty, but that does not automatically mean they were throne-names.
Royal Titles
In the second millennium, the most common spellings for Sargon were šar-ru-GI
and šar-ru-ki-in in both Sumerian and Akkadian texts, although LUGAL.GI.NA appears
in a few texts of this period. In the Sargon Legend and texts from the first millennium,
the name LUGAL.GI.NA then became most frequent spelling of Sargon in Assyria.
However, this epithet "strong/legitimate king" originated in the Ur III period and was
used by Nabopolassar and all major Assyrian rulers after Arik-den-ili until 612 BCE,
meaning Sargon himself did not use it.226 Instead, in the late 3rd millennium Lugal a-ga
deki was used in Sargon's own inscription, referring to the city he built and representing
the larger region of Northern Babylonia.227 Nonetheless the title "King of Kish" (šar
kiššati) was also used by Neo-Assyrian kings to mean "King of the Universe" and the

78
divinely authorized ruler over all Sumer. In particular is Sargon II, whose full title was
"the Great King, the Mighty King, King of the Universe." It was to Kish, after all, that the
gods bestowed kingship to humanity after the flood according to the Sumerian King List.
As a result, even though Sargon added to his list of titles Lugal a-ga-de
ki
(King of
Akkad), "King of Kish," "King of Akkad," "Strong King," and "True King" seem to have
been closely connected in meaning.
228
Nimrod
The person of Nimrod is a curious case in that his characteristics bear a striking
resemblance to Sargon of Akkad. According to Genesis 10:9-12, Nimrod is apparently
the founder of the entire land of Sumer, with Babel and Akkad among his administrative
centers before heading north to the Assyrian region like Sargon. The land of שנער could
be a dialectic form on Sumer based on the toponym "Šanhar." Genesis 10 also mentions
that Nimrod founded Calah, the capital city of the Assyrian empire from the 9th century
until the reign of Sargon II.
229
The question with Nimrod's Mesopotamian affiliation was
that he is listed under the descendents of Ham, and Mesopotamia is not Ham's direction.
Some suggest that it was a scribal error from the J writer, while others suggest that
Nimrod really had a Cushite or Ethiopian background and simply moved to
Mesopotamia. More likely, however, is that "Cush" actually refers to a different
Mesopotamian people or region and the biblical writers simply confused the actual
228

229
Ibid., 352-353.



79
"Cush" that begot Nimrod with the Cush under Ham's line.230 Based on how Nimrod is
credited with managing and founding the major cities in Mesopotamia and was also
credited with extraordinary prowess like Sargon, however, it is most likely that "Cush"
actually refers to the ancient city of Kish, where kingship first descended after the flood
and where Sargon rebelled against Ur-Zababa. As such, the story of Nimrod is simply the
Israelites' version of how kingship descended from heaven after the flood.231 In summary,
Nimrod was not any particular historical individual, but rather the "figure" of Sargon-
that is, the first great king after the flood.
Moses
As for Moses, the similarity with Sargon is obviously in the infant exposure
narrative. Like the Sargon Birth Legend, the story of Moses has an explanation of
abandonment and lineage, infant exposure, discovery and adoption, and
accomplishments. However, the Sargon Birth Legend does not say Sargon was nursed in
an unusual manner, it does not involve a sister in any way, and it does not connect the
name "Sargon" with the event.232 In addition, while Moses was placed in a basket to
avoid genocide, Sargon's reason for exposure is not explicit although it may have to do
with his mother being an entu priestess in that she may have been supposed to avoid
pregnancy.233 To put the infant exposure motif in perspective, the motif is found in 71

231 Ibid., 361-364.

233 Lewis, The Sargon Legend, 38, 264.



80
various tales worldwide and may occur for any number of reasons; as a result, it is
entirely possible the stories of Sargon and Moses developed independently.234 In other
words, the similarity of story elements may be a result of similar historical situations
rather than shared literary traditions.235
Joshua as Type
Etymology "YHWH is Salvation"
Numbers 13:16 clearly refers to Hoshea as the original name of Joshua. In the
biblical narrative the name "Yehoshua" is given to Hoshea, adding the divine name
"YHWH" onto Hoshea. As is well known, this in turn results in "YHWH is salvation" for
the meaning of the name "Joshua," which in Greek is "Ιησουσ" and also known in
English as “Jesus.” The name Joshua is also similar to the name Josiah, and if the final
composition of the Pentateuch/Hexeteuch was formed in the time of Josiah, one could
consider the book of Joshua to reflect the ideology of the Josianic period of reforms.236
Given how the district lists of divisions of the land are based on Josiah's kingdom as
already discussed, it is possible there is a connection between the persons of Joshua and
Josiah.237 Nonetheless, the most important feature of Joshua's name lies in the fact that he
is the first person in the Hebrew Bible to have "YHWH" incorporated into his personal
name, given by the one who received the theophany at Sinai no less. Indeed, his name

81
itself refers to both his character and role in the story; the overarching theme of the
Exodus and conquest of Canaan is YHWH's deliverance of Israel, and Joshua's name
represents just that.238 If the biblical authors indeed gave the credit of multiple
individuals' conquests that gave rise to the nation of Israel, what better way of unifying
the mixed multitude than to have a single national epic with a single legendary hero
whose name points to a single all-powerful God?
Joshua “Son of Nun”
"Son of Nun" most likely simply refers to Joshua's father, who is the son of
Elishamma according to I Chronicles 7:26. Curiously, however, "Son of Nun" is used 30
times in the Old Testament while "Son of Jesse" is used only 19 times. The most likely
reason for this is to distinguish Joshua son of Nun from other Joshua’s and to remind the
reader that Joshua is the leader of the second generation of wanderers.239 There is also a
medieval story of Joshua in Jewish tradition that explains how Joshua came to be called
"son of Nun." The story begins by telling how a husband and wife pray to God because
the wife could not produce children, but when a child was born the father learned from
heaven that the son would kill him. As a result, the mother placed Joshua in a chest and
cast him down a river, where YHWH sent a fish to swallow him. A king cut the fish open
for a feast and found the child, who grew up to be royal executioner that eventually
executed his father. After this he approached his (unbeknownst to him at the time) mother

82
to have relations with her, but learned through a miracle that she was actually his mother
before learning of his birth and consequently make atonement for killing his father. As a
result of being swallowed by a fish (Aramaic nun), Joshua became known as "son of
Nun.”240 This story that seems to take elements from many familiar traditions almost
certainly has no historical truth to it, but once again the infant exposure and eventual
adoption motif with a royal connection appears in a story regarding a legendary figure.
Proto-King
The biblical portrayal of Joshua is very multifaceted. He displays military
leadership, spiritual leadership, and obedience to the laws of Moses.241 Many scholars
have also compared Joshua to a biblical king; based on Joshua 1-8, Richard D. Nelson
suggests that Joshua was described in the Deuteronomistic History in terms usually
reserved for a king. God's charge to Joshua's assumption of leadership, the people's
pledge of loyalty to Joshua as successor of Moses, the ceremony of covenant renewal,
and God's command for Joshua to "meditate upon [the Book of the Law] day and night"
all suggest a kingly figure.242 In comparison to Ancient Near Eastern kings, in Egypt the
enthronement of a new pharaoh included a ceremony called the "circuit of the wall"
which obviously is reminiscent of the siege of Jericho. In addition, the marching of the
Ark of the Covenant into battle is reminiscent of how Naram-Sin marched with two horns
240 Lewis, The Sargon Legend, 154.
241 Hall, Conquering Character, 9-14.
242 Finkelstein and Silberman, The Bible Unearthed, 95.



83
which were emblems of Annuit and Silaba.243 However, just as possible is that the
succession of Israelite kings is based on Joshua instead of the other way around.244
Joshua as a whole seems largely critical of kings, as the only city not to oppose Israel is
Gibeon which was not a kingdom.245
In general, however, Joshua is not portrayed as a perfect idyllic character. In
Joshua 2 he displays some timidity like Moses at the burning bush and decides wrongly
in the case of the Gibeonites.246 Overall it would seem that he is not a "type" even if he is
a model leader. As for whether or not he is a king, Joshua is a spokesman, seer, prophet,
and warrior; combined with the lack of any explicit royal designation to Joshua, he is
probably too multifaceted to be seen as a king or even a prototype of a king. Rather, his
leadership should be seen in light of being Moses' successor instead of a king, proto-king,
or a copy of Moses.247 Oddly, even though I Chronicles places Joshua in the genealogical
line of Ephraim, Joshua himself did not appear to have any sons from even the temporal
vantage point of the Chronicler. This may simply be because Joshua did not have any
sons, but it is unusual especially given his importance. In any case, Joshua is portrayed as
a very multifaceted character who may certainly have been a historical figure, but is
depicted as someone larger-than-life like Sargon of Akkad.

84
Intent of Legend Creation
Political Implications Based on Date of Composition
Once again, the significance of any historical endeavor for the ancient
Mesopotamians was not in the recording of "what really happened" but in the
exemplicative value. As such, the Akkad dynasty is regarded as an idyllic time and
Sargon of Akkad was the founder of this golden age. In this explanation, it would then
only be natural for the literature and legacy of Sargon's accomplishments to become of
legendary proportions.248 Samuel Noah Kramer introduced the concept of the "Heroic
Age" in Assyriology, suggesting that stories of heroes like Gilgamesh and Enmerkar
reflect a period of conquest for the Sumerians. In the same way, the Sargonic period can
be considered the "heroic" age for Akkadians. Prior to Sargon, the Akkadian region may
have been little more than a backwater compared to Uruk and Ebla, but as a result of
Sargon's feats the Akkadians became a major empire.249
Since it is clear that every work of literature was written for contemporary
purposes, the exact intent of each text regarding Sargon largely depends on the date of
composition.250 For example, if the Sargon Birth Legend was indeed written during the
time of the Assyrian kings that named themselves Sargon, then it is very likely the
purpose of the legend was not so much to glorify Sargon of Akkad, but rather the Sargon
of that time. If the text was written in a different period, naturally the purpose would have

85
been different as well. The Sargon Geography, likewise, provides points along the
frontiers of the Neo-Assyrian empire, explaining the expanse of Sargon of Akkad's
empire in terms of the contemporary Neo-Assyrian empire.251 The "King of Battle,"
however, was probably composed in the time of Shamshi-Adad, and therefore was most
likely written in order to urge the king to reestablish trade routes between Assur and
central Anatolia.252 What is clear, however, is that Sargon of Akkad was regarded as the
standard by which all other kings would be compared, similar to King David of biblical
literature.
Future Hopes in Joshua
Despite the Josianic-period elements in the text’s division of land, it has been
suggested that the book of Joshua is not simply referencing later topography but rather
early hopes for the Israelite people. In Joshua 14-19 the allotments of land are arranged in
two phases with chapter 18 marking the second phase, indicating that there was much
land still to be taken up.253 The allotment to Asher, for instance, includes Tyre and
Sidon–cities far beyond the reaches of the United Monarchy.254 In Joshua 21 the
allotment for the Levitical towns is the final aspect of the distribution of the land, very
much displaying characteristics of the later P source. First, Jerusalem and all of Judah in
the Persian period is omitted for the Levitical towns. Second, all but four priestly towns

86
listed were in Edomite territory at the time. Third is the inclusion of Eltheke, Gibbethon,
and Gezer, which were all cities clearly still to be conquered by Israelites as seen in I
Kings. It is clear, then, that the picture Joshua presents in the land allotments is idyllic in
character rather than a fulfilled reality.255
It is important to note, however, that these hopes were also of an archaic nature in
that they were early ideals from even before the monarchy. For example, even though the
Philistine cities in Judges 1:18 were defeated by the Israelites, the attempt to actualize the
ideal of Joshua 15 failed in the long run as Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron were clearly not
inhabited by Israelites in Samuel and Kings.256 Furthermore, not only is there a lack of
any mention of return from Exile in Joshua, Ezekiel 27-28 speaks not of Tyre and Sidon's
occupation like in Joshua but rather their destruction.257 It would almost appear as if even
the writers of Joshua themselves were living in an idyllic time to have such high hopes
for the twelve tribes’ campaigns in the land of Canaan.
Conclusion
In summary, the portrayals of Joshua son of Nun and Sargon of Akkad share
many similar features. The archaeological evidence for either figure is fragmented and
somewhat inconclusive, but the textual evidence clearly reflects similar patterns in the
traditions surrounding Joshua and Sargon. While both traditions may portray an actual
historical figure and may also recount actual historical events, they both reflect an idyllic

time, and both characters were made into larger-than-life legends by later times for later
purposes.

CHAPTER SEVEN
IMPLICATIONS OF THE PROPOSED CONNECTION BETWEEN JOSHUA AND SARGON
Problem of the Contextual Approach
Despite the similarities between the two figures, the contextual approach used in
this discussion has an arguably problematic presupposition. Cultures across the Ancient
Near East may have similar features as seen in the legendary nature of Sargon of Akkad,
but that does not necessarily indicate a cultural connection–yet the methodology in the
contextual approach presupposes that there is. Not only are geographically widespread
practices often chronologically widespread, each culture is unique in its own right and
cannot be used to prove or disprove the reliability of any biblical text.258 Linguistic
cognates between different cultures may also denote different concepts as well–it is no
secret that languages change over time and space. For example, the term for "leviathan"
is used in many Semitic languages, but the various uses of the term do not necessarily
carry identical meaning.259 In other words, the biblical writers may be unique in their own
regard. Just because most Ancient Near Eastern scribes did not record events “as is,” it
does not mean the numerous biblical writers all did the same; the Joshua narratives may
have indeed been intended for such literal historical purposes, but further archaeological
and textual evidence is required to determine what the intent of each author was and such

259 Ibid., 229.



89
evidence may be inaccessible. As a result one could say that the problem with studying
the biblical narrative's historical veracity is not a matter of the hyperbole or ideological
intent behind the narratives, but rather of the modern scholar's limited interpretive
methods.260
Theological Implications
If one takes on an evidentialist approach, it is clear that the problems of ancient
history are applicable to both the Bible and other Ancient Near Eastern texts. As the city
of Akkad has not even been located, the archaeological evidence supporting Sargon of
Akkad may be just as lacking as it is for Joshua. The main controversy with the biblical
book of Joshua is that the events surrounding Joshua son of Nun, being part of a much
larger story that extends, are a vital link in a theological chain. If Joshua's events did not
occur as described based on contextual studies (such as if other peoples’
accomplishments were simply attributed to him), what of King David and subsequently,
of Jesus and the resurrection? If the accomplishment of multiple individuals were given
to a single individual in the case of Joshua, would it not also be possible that the same
applies to David and Jesus?
While certain archaeological or textual discoveries may challenge certain
theological positions, it is important to re-emphasize the nature of textual and material
evidence in regards to such matters. Scholars such as Dever suggest that texts are mere

90
symbols of how people perceived reality, not descriptions of "what really happened." In
this view history writing is but the "grammar" to analyze the "language" of the past and
the modern scholar is not a native "speaker."261 Likewise Piotr Michalowski suggests that
history to the early Mesopotamians is but a “space that informed the present.262 In
addition, Iain Provan argues that it is impossible for scholars today to investigate such
facts without engaging in meta-narrative, citing Ahlström who says that the researcher,
too, is often influenced by his/her contemporary culture and ideology when investigating
questions of the past.263 To circumvent these issues one may turn to archaeology due to
its unique nature of being physical and material, but even archaeology is limited to the
scholars’ interpretations.
Archaeology, too, presents its own history and its own "language" which cannot
answer all historically-related questions.264 What the archaeologist and biblical scholar
has access to as a result of archaeological excavations is simply what the archaeological
picture is--whether or not that picture overrides or supplements literary analysis,
theology, or factual history is not its proper intent. The dynamic nature of archaeology is
such that a single discovery can completely change the current archaeological picture.
For example, the singular discovery of the Tel Dan stele and its reference to the “House
of David” put to rest many minimalistic positions on the existence of King David. In the

263 Iain Provan, “Ideologies,” 591.
264 Ahlström, “The Role of Archaeological and Literary Remains,” 140.



91
same way, in any given day in the future a new discovery may put to rest the problem of
the dating of the Israelite conquest and perhaps, subsequently, the entire issue of Joshua’s
historicity. Even in its ever-changing nature, however, archaeology has enabled biblical
scholars to have a visual understanding of the biblical world as a result of archaeology's
unique ability to reconstruct the material past. Determining how that data can be used for
politics, theology, or history is not the archaeologist's purpose.



92
CHAPTER EIGHT
CONCLUSION
Summary of Argument
Sargon’s legacy is certainly impressive; not only was he deified for over a
thousand years, he is very clearly a historical figure that is a special character in
chronicles and the main character in numerous epics and literary narratives. Later
Mesopotamian kings emulated him and even named themselves after him in hopes of
following in his footsteps. His legacy was so great that the accomplishments of his
successors, including Naram-Sin, were credited to him instead. Even if not explicitly
named as such, there is even a Sargon-like figure in Genesis by the name of Nimrod, and
the biblical story of Moses and the basket may very well have been taken from the
Sargon Birth Legend. As a result, the answer to whether or not there is any evidence of a
legendary figure taking the accomplishments of other individuals is a definite yes. The
biblical narrative of Joshua son of Nun may have employed the same feature in the
biblical text, and if so then it is possible that the destruction dates of Hazor and Jericho do
not match simply because Joshua was credited with the accomplishments of other
individuals from different periods of time. That said, the attribution of credit seen in the
case of Sargon does not automatically mean that the biblical writers employed this
feature; rather, it is only a possibility given the parallel from the Ancient Near Eastern
context.



93
Contextual Approach - An Overview
It would appear that the contextual approach to questions of biblical historicity,
although imperfect in its own right, is a largely indispensable approach that raises just as
many questions as it seeks to answer. The use of texts from other cultures in
understanding the biblical narratives may validate or contradict various possibilities of
interpretations, but it does not necessarily prove any particular understanding to be the
correct one. The question of the Bible's historical veracity is ultimately unanswerable just
as it is for ancient Mesopotamian texts, but the fact that the authors of both the biblical
narratives and Mesopotamian accounts may not have even intended for historical veracity
leaves this question ultimately irrelevant–there is simply too much uncertainty within the
scholars' own methodologies as to whether it is even fair to demand "historical veracity"
in the first place. Archaeology, likewise, can raise questions about historicity but does not
intend to answer them. Rather, archaeology has become a largely independent discipline
from history and theology that seeks not to prove or disprove anything but rather to let
the stones speak for themselves. The contextual approach, then, is a tool to help modern
scholars bridge the gap between the minds of the present day and the ancients. As a tool,
it is not the authoritative interpreter but rather the interpreter's guide to bridging the
chasm between the past and present.
