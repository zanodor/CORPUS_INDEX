Indus Script hieroglyphs arka, mēḍhā, karba, karṣa 'wealth signifiers' on hilts of Viking swords
I submit that the following hieroglyphs on hilts of Viking swords are Indus Script rebus readings:
arka 'sun' rebus: arka 'gold, copper' agasale 'goldsmith workshop'అగసాలి or
అగలెవాసాడు agasāli. [Tel.] n. A goldsmith. కంవాసాలిడు .
मेढा [mēḍhā] A twist or tangle arising in thread or cord, a curl or snarl (Marathi). Rebus: meḍ 'iron
karba 'stalk of millet' (holcus sorghum) rebus: karba, ib 'iron' (Compares with the symbol shown on Mari procession) Rein: káśā f. ʻ whip ʼ RV., ʻ rein ʼ Śiś., ʻ string ʼ lex., kaśa -- m. ʻ whip, thong ʼ MBh.(CDIAL 2965) Rebus: kārṣāpaṇá m.n. ʻ a partic. coin or weight equivalent to one karṣa ʼ. [karṣa -- m. ʻ a partic. weight ʼ Suśr. (cf. OPers. karša -- ) and paṇa -- 2 or āpana -EWA i 176 and 202 with lit. But from early MIA. kā̆ hā ̊]
Pa. kahāpaṇa -- m.n. ʻ a partic. weight and coin ʼ, KharI. kahapana -- , Pk. karisāvaṇa -m.n., kāhāvaṇa -- , kah ̊ m.; A. kaoṇ ʻ a coin equivalent to 1 rupee or 16 paṇas or 1280 cowries ʼ; B. kāhan ʻ 16 paṇas ʼ; Or. kāhā̆ ṇa ʻ 16 annas or 1280 cowries ʼ, H. kahāwan, kāhan, kahān m.; OSi. (brāhmī) kahavaṇa, Si. kahavuṇa,  ̊vaṇuva ʻ a partic. weight ʼ.(CDIAL 3086) Thus, karṣa is a signifier of wealth

Drawing of the Sæbø sword and its inscription from Petersen (1919).--The sword is notable for its blade inscription, which has been interpreted as runic by George Stephens (1867), which would be very exceptional; while Viking Age sword hilts were sometimes incised with runes, inlaid blade inscriptions are, with this possible exception, invariably in the Latin alphabet.; the blade inscription Leutfrit (+ LEUTFRIT)?

Huge Hoard of Viking Sword Parts Found in Estonia
Archaeologists have uncovered the fragments of about a hundred swords that once belonged to Viking warriors . They were unearthed in the Baltic country of Estonia. The experts believe that the fragments were once part of weapons used as grave markers or funerary monuments for warriors. The fragments were uncovered in two separate although neighboring locations, near the coast in Northern Estonia. ERR reports that Mauri Kiudsoo, an archaeologist and archivist from Tallinn University, stated that the “two sites were located just 80 meters apart”. “The fragments were found in the territory of the ancient Estonian county of Ravala, late last autumn” according to ERR. This is not far from the capital of Tallinn. Viking-era burial monument
In the two finds were found several dozen fragments from swords and also a collection of spearheads. Researchers have established that the artifacts were of a type used by
the Vikings. Archaeology.org reports that they have been dated to “the middle of the tenth century AD”. Some sword hilts were recovered, and they have Viking era design motifs.

It seems that the swords were deliberately destroyed by the Vikings, who would break up weapons as part of their burial customs . The fragments were parts of a memorial to a warrior or group of warriors who had died. Archaeology.org quotes Kiudsoo as saying that “bits of broken weapons may have been cenotaphs or items left as a monument to warriors”. They may have been commemorating Vikings who had fallen in battle or died on trading missions and been buried elsewhere. This may explain why no human remains were found at either of the two sites. The finds were made in an area that was situated near a major Viking trade route. These fierce Scandinavian warriors often raided the area of what is now Estonia. They also established trade outposts and hill forts in the region, especially in coastal areas. However, they never managed to conquer the fierce Finnic tribes in the interior, who retreated into marshes and forests in the face of the Viking assaults.

The fragment hoard found at Ravala is the largest find of Viking weaponry parts in Estonia. They are very similar to other Viking-era swords in Northern Europe. The grips of the swords helped the experts to classify the weapon. ERR reports that Kiudsoo stated that “the grips of the swords allow us to determine which type of swords they are”.
The parts have been definitively identified as coming from swords of the H-shaped type. They were double-edged swords and were very effective weapons and gave the Vikings a real advantage over their enemies . This type of sword was widely used as is evident in the fact that some 700 have been found over a wide geographical area. These weapons were used by Vikings in their battles and raids all over Northern Europe and beyond.

Vikings Brutally Slain in 750 AD May Have Been on a Peaceful Mission Discovery of Two Boat Burials Changes Viking Timeline The Ancient Legend of the Monstrous Rat King Vikings in the Baltic The latest find means that the number of H-type swords found in the Baltic country has now risen to about one hundred. They have mainly been found in the north of the country. The find is demonstrating that the H type swords were in use by at least the mid-10 th century in the Baltic area. The discovery of the fragments of the swords is adding to our knowledge of the Viking-era in Estonia. They demonstrate that the northern coastal area was under the direct influence of these fierce warriors and great traders. It is possible that more finds, similar to the warriors’ burial monument could be made in the general Ravala area.

Archaeologists have discovered fragments of about a hundred Viking swords, the largest find of Viking swords in Estonia to date, in northern Estonia.
The fragments were found in two closely located sites in a coastal area of north Estonia, in the territory of the ancient Estonian county of Ravala, late last autumn.
The finds consisted of dozens of items, mostly fragments of swords and a few spearheads.
Mauri Kiudsoo, archaeologist and keeper of the archaeological research collection of Tallinn University, told BNS the two sites were located just 80 meters apart. The swords date from the middle of the 10th century and are probably cenotaphs, grave markers dedicated to people buried elsewhere.
The reason why the swords were not found intact, Kiudsoo said, is due to the burial customs of the time. It is characteristic of finds in Estonia from the period that weapons were put into the graves broken or rendered unusable.
While the Ravala fragments constitute the biggest find of Viking-era weapons in Estonia, more important according to Kiudsoo, is the fact that the grips of the swords allow us to determine which type of swords they are. They have been identified as H-shaped double-edged swords. This type of sword was the most common type in the Viking era and over 700 have been found in northern Europe.
Kiudsoo said that by 1991, eight more or less intact type H swords and about 20 fragments had been discovered in Estonia but the number has risen to about 100. The overwhelming majority of the Estonian finds have come to light on the country's north coast, which lies by the most important remote trade route of the Viking era.
Since the Ravala finds date from the middle of the 10th century they prove for the first time that type H swords were in use in the territory of Estonia in the 10th century, Kuidsoo said.
