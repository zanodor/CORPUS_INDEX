R̥tvij at Shahr-e Sūkhté & Mohenjo-daro
Images: 1. Conjectural graphic reconstruction of the likely original setting of the Zahedan Museum torso as a "Priest King", based upon the head from Chah-i Torogh 2 (Seistan, Iran) visible in Fig, 3, and the general form and proportion of statuette L 950 (Fig. 4). The side view is less certain than the front and the rear ones (drawing M. Vidale). 2. A frontal picture of the Zahedan Museum torso. 2 and 3: graphic enhacements of the front and rear of the same fragment based upon 1.1 (picture and drawings by M. Vidale). 3. Seated male figure with head missing from Mohenjo-daro (back).
4. Seated male figure with head missing from Mohenjo-daro (front). https://www.harappa.com/content/priest-king-shahr-i-sokhta
