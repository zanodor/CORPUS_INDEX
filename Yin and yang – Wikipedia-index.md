Yin and yang
In Chinese philosophy, yin and yang ( 陰 陽 yīnyáng, lit. "dark-bright",
"negative-positive") describe how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may
actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural
world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one
another. Many tangible dualities (such as light and dark, fire and water,
expanding and contracting) are thought of as physical manifestations of the
duality symbolized by yin and yang. This duality lies at the origins of many
branches of classical Chinese science and philosophy, as well as being a
primary guideline of traditional Chinese medicine,[1] and a central principle
of different forms of Chinese martial arts and exercise, such as baguazhang,
taijiquan (t'ai chi), and qigong (Chi Kung), as well as appearing in the pages
of the I Ching.
Duality is found in many belief systems, but Yin and Yang are parts of a
Oneness that is also equated with the Tao. The term 'dualistic-monism' or
dialectical monism has been coined in an attempt to express this fruitful
paradox of simultaneous unity/duality. Yin and yang can be thought of as
complementary (rather than opposing) forces that interact to form a dynamic
system in which the whole is greater than the assembled parts.[2] Everything has
both yin and yang aspects (for instance, shadow cannot exist without light). Either
of the two major aspects may manifest more strongly in a particular object,
depending on the criterion of the observation. The yin yang (i.e. taijitu symbol)
shows a balance between two opposites with a portion of the opposite element in
each section.
In Taoist metaphysics, distinctions between good and bad, along with other
dichotomous moral judgments, are perceptual, not real; so, the duality of yin and
yang is an indivisible whole. In the ethics of Confucianism on the other hand, most
notably in the philosophy of Dong Zhongshu (c. 2nd century BC), a moral
dimension is attached to the idea of yin and yang[.3]

The Chinese terms yīn 陰 or 阴 "shady side" and yáng 陽 or 阳 "sunny side" are
linguistically analyzable in terms of Chinese characters, pronunciations and
etymology, meanings, topography, and loanwords.
The Traditional Chinese characters 陰 and 陽 for the words yīn and yáng are both
classified as radical-phonetic characters, combining the semantically significant
"mound; hill" radical阝 or 阜 with the phonetic indicators yīn 侌 and yáng 昜. The
first phonetic yīn 侌 "cloudy" ideographically combines jīn 今 "now; present" and
yún 云 "cloud", denoting the "今 presence of 云 clouds".[4] The second phonetic
yáng 昜 "bright" originally pictured 日 the "sun" with 勿 "rays coming down".[5]
This phonetic is expanded with the "sun" radical into yáng 暘 "rising sun;
sunshine". The "mound; hill" radical 阝 full forms semantically specify yīn 陰
"shady/dark side of a hill" andyáng 陽 "sunny/light side of a hill".
The Simplified Chinese characters 阴 and 阳 for yīn and yáng combine the same
"hill" radical 阝 with the non-phonetic yuè 月 "moon" and rì 日 "sun", graphically denoting "shady side of a hill" and "sunny side of
a hill". Compare the Classical Chinesenames (which contain tài 太 "great") for these two heavenly bodies: Tàiyīn 太陰 "moon" and
Tàiyáng 太陽 "sun".
The Modern Standard Chinese pronunciation of 陰 or 阴 is usually level first tone yīn "shady; cloudy" or sometimes falling fourth
tone yìn "to shelter; shade", and陽 or 阳 "sunny" is always pronounced with rising second toneyáng.
Sinologists and historical linguists have reconstructed Middle Chinese pronunciations from data in the (7th century CE) Qieyun rime
dictionary and later rime tables, which was subsequently used to reconstruct Old Chinese phonology from rimes in the (11th-7th
centuries BCE) Shijing and phonological components of Chinese characters. Reconstructions of Old Chinese have illuminated the
etymology of modern Chinese words.
Compare these Middle Chinese and Old Chinese (with asterisk) reconstructions oyfīn 陰 and yáng 陽:

ʔjəm < *ʔəm and jiaŋ < *laŋ (Axel Schuessler)[9]
'im < *qrum and yang < *laŋ (William H. Baxterand Laurent Sagart)[10]
Schuessler gives probableSino-Tibetan etymologies for both Chinese words.
Yin < *ʔəm compares with Burmese ʔumC "overcast; cloudy", Adi muk-jum "shade", and Lepcha so'yǔm "shade"; and is probably
cognate with Chineseàn < *ʔə̂mʔ黯 "dim; gloomy" andqīn < *khəm 衾 "blanket"

Yin and yang are semantically complex words.

The compound yinyang 陰 陽 or 阴 阳 means "yin and yang; opposites; ancient Chinese astronomy; occult arts; astrologer;
geomancer; etc.".
The sinologist Rolf Stein etymologically translates Chinese yin 陰 "shady side (of a mountain)" and yang 陽 "sunny side (of a
mountain)" with the uncommon English geographic terms ubac "shady side of a mountain" and adret "sunny side of a mountain"
(which are of French origin).[12]
Many Chinese place names or toponyms contain the word yang "sunny side" and a few contain yin "shady side". In China, as
elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, sunlight comes predominantly from the south, and thus the south face of a mountain or the
north bank of a river will receive more direct sunlight than the opposite side.
Yang refers to the "south side of a hill" in Hengyang 衡陽, which is south of Mount Heng 衡山 in Hunan province, and to the "north
bank of a river" inLuoyang 洛陽, which is located north of theLuo River 洛河 in Henan.
Similarly, yin refers to "north side of a hill" inHuayin 華陰, which is north ofMount Hua 華山 in Shaanxi province.
English yin, yang, and yin-yang are familiar loanwords of Chinese origin.
The Oxford English Dictionarydefines:
yin (jɪn) Also Yin, Yn. [Chinese yīn shade, feminine; the moon.]
a. In Chinese philosophy, the feminine or negative principle (characterized by dark, wetness, cold, passivity,
disintegration, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in
physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Alsoattrib. or as adj., and transf. Cf. yang.
b. Comb., as yin-yang, the combination or fusion of the two cosmic forces; freq. attrib., esp. as yin-yang symbol, a circle divided by an S-shaped line into a dark and a light segment, representing respectively yin and yang, each containing a 'seed' of the other.

For the earliest recorded "yin and yang" usages, the OED cites 1671 for yin and yang,[13] 1850 for yin-yang,[14] and 1959 for yang
yin.[15]
In English, yang-yin (like ying-yang) occasionally occurs as a mistake or typographical error for the Chinese loanword yin-yang
yet they are not equivalents. Chinese does have someyangyin collocations, such as 洋銀 (lit. "foreign silver") "silver coin/dollar", but
not even the most comprehensive dictionaries (e.g., the Hanyu Da Cidian) enter yangyin * 陽 陰 . While yang and yin can occur
together in context,[16] yangyin is not synonymous with yinyang. The linguistic term "irreversible binomial" refers to a collocation of
two words A-B that cannot normally be reversed as B-A, for example, English cat and mouse (not *mouse and cat) and friend or foe
(not *foe or friend). Similarly, the usual pattern among Chinese binomial compounds is for positive A and negative B, where the A
word is dominant or privileged over B, for example, tiandi 天地 "heaven and earth" and nannü 男女 "men and women". Yinyang
meaning "dark and light; female and male; moon and sun", however, is an exception. Scholars have proposed various explanations
for why yinyang violates this pattern, including "linguistic convenience" (it is easier to say yinyang than yangyin), the idea that
"proto-Chinese society was matriarchal", or perhaps, since yinyang first became prominent during the late Warring States period, this
term was "purposely directed at challenging persistent cultural assumptions["1.7]
Needham discusses Yin and Yang together with Five Elements as part of the School of Naturalists. He says that it would be proper to
begin with Yin and Yang before Five Elements because the former: "lay, as it were, at a deeper level in Nature, and were the most
ultimate principles of which the ancient Chinese could conceive. But it so happens that we know a good deal more about the
historical origin of the Five-Element theory than about that of the Yin and the Yang, and it will therefore be more convenient to deal
with it first."[18] He then discusses Zou Yan (鄒衍; 305 – 240 BC) who is most associated with these theories. Although Yin and
Yang are not mentioned in any of the surviving documents of Zou Yan, his school was known as the Yin Yang Jia (Yin and Yang
School) Needham concludes "There can be very little doubt that the philosophical use of the terms began about the beginning of the
-4th century, and that the passages in older texts which mention this use are interpolations made later than that tim[e1."9]
In Daoist philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in the Tao Te Ching at chapter 42.[20] It becomes sensible from an initial
quiescence or emptiness (wuji, sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until quiescence is reached again.
For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this
alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more.
Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities. Further, whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to
transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die
back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.
It is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a
mutual whole (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is to postulate the
notion of a race with only men or only women; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, men and women together create
new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two gives birth
to things, like manhood.[21] Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a

Nature



retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky—an
intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while
roots grow in darkness.
Certain catchphrases have been used to express yin and yang complementarit[y2:2]
The bigger the front, the bigger the back.
Illness is the doorway to health.
Tragedy turns to comedy.
Disasters turn out to be blessings.
Yin is the black side with the white dot in it, and ayng is the white side with the black dot in it. The relationship between yin and yang
is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the 'shady place' or 'north slope') is the dark
area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (literally the 'sunny place' or 'south slope') is the brightly lit portion. As the sun
moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was
revealed.
Yin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity,
and nighttime.
Yang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity and
daytime.[23]
The Yin-Yang symbol, having no "officially standardized" rendition, has been the basis of much artistic variation, most of it
"frivolous" (that is, "merely" artistic, with no philosophical/mystical meaning, e.g., tattoos).
Yin and yang also applies to the human body. In traditional Chinese medicine good health is directly related to the balance between
yin and yang qualities within oneself.[24] If yin and yang become unbalanced, one of the qualities is considered deficient or has
vacuity.
In the I Ching, originally a divination manual of the Western Zhou period (c. 1000–750 BC),[25] yin and yang are represented by
broken and solid lines: yin is broken (⚋) and yang is solid (⚊). These are then combined intotrigrams, which are more yang (e.g.
☱) or more yin (e.g. ☵) depending on the number of broken and solid lines (e.g., ☰ is heavily yang, while ☷ is heavily yin), and
trigrams are combined into hexagrams (e.g. ䷕ and ䷟). The relative positions and numbers of yin and yang lines within the
trigrams determines the meaning of a trigram, and in hexagrams the upper trigram is considered yang with respect to the lower
trigram, yin, which allows for complex depictions of interrelations.
The principle of yin and yang is represented in Taoism by the Taijitu (literally "Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate"). The term is
commonly used to mean the simple "divided circle" form, but may refer to any of several schematic diagrams representing these
principles, such as theswastika, common to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Similar symbols have also appeared in other cultures,
such as in Celtic art and Roman shield markings.[26][27][28]
Taijiquan (Chinese:太极拳), a form of martial art, is often described as the principles of yin and yang applied to the human body and
an animal body. Wu Jianquan, a famous Chinese martial artsteacher, described Taijiquan as follows:

I Ching
Taijitu
Taijiquan



Various people have offered different explanations for the name Taijiquan. Some have said: – 'In terms of self
cultivation, one must train from a state of movement towards a state of stillness. Taiji comes about through the
balance of yin and yang. In terms of the art of attack and defense then, in the context of the changes of full and empty,
one is constantly internally latent, to not outwardly expressive, as if the yin and yang of Taiji have not yet divided
apart.' Others say: 'Every movement of Taijiquan is based on circles, just like the shape of a Taijitu. Therefore, it is
called Taijiquan.
