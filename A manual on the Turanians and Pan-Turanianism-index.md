NOTE
The present Manual has been written with a view
to supplying the information which is essential to a
thorough understanding of the character and aims of
^ Pan-Turanianism '.
The work is divided into six chapters. The first,
after stating the source and meaning of the term
' Turanian % furnishes a general survey of the Turanian
race, setting forth its origin, migrations, present dis
tribution, numbers, characteristics, language, religion,
and civilization.
The following chapters describe the five main branches
of the Turanian people together with the subdivisions
of each branch. Each chapter begins with a general
characterization of the branch with which it deals.
Then comes a detailed account of the tribes forming
divisions of the main branch. Each is uniformly de
scribed with regard to its habitat, name, number, mode
of life, characteristics, language, literature, religion, and
history. This arrangement is intended to facilitate the
comparison of the numerous tribes described in the
Manual. Each section of a chapter concludes with a
bibliographical note, while the many numbered notes
493784



6 NOTE
relating to points of detail are relegated to the end of
the chapter itself. The subject-matter is as a rule
presented in such a way as to leave the reader to draw
his own conclusions. But sometimes, when occasion
offers, as in the comparison of the Turks and Hungarians
(pp. 77-8), observations bearing on Pan-Turanianism are
made. Otherwise some general conclusions that may
be drawn from the data supplied in this volume are
reserved for the end of the last chapter. The accom
panying map presents the area occupied by Turanian
populations in five colours corresponding to the five
main branches, while the subdivisions are indicated by
coloured names only and without boundaries^ which in
all cases are somewhat indefinite. The ethnographical,
in contrast with the political, frontiers are only approxi
mate as indicated by the edges of the five colours. Thus
within the confines of the yellow Mongolian area in the
south-west some Tibetan, and in the extreme east some
Chinese, elements are scattered.

CHAPTEK I
^ ^ INTRODUCTION
DufeiNG the last few years there has taken place in Turkey the awakening of a national consciousness aiming at the
purification of the Turkish language by the expulsion of all foreign elements, and the establishment of a civilization based entirely on old Turkish traditions. With this is combined a Pan-Turanian, that is to say, a Pan-Turkish movement, the
goal of which is a powerful and independent union of all the
Turks in the world, embracing a population of 5 0,000,000. ^
This movement involves a policy of Irredentism, which aspires not only to stimulate by moral and intellectual propa
ganda the feeling of racial community among kindred peoples,
but under favourable circumstances to free their kinsmen
politically irom their Russian, British, Persian, and Afghan rulers. Turkish writers have begun to speak of their ' ideal
fatherland, their Turania, the cradle of their nation and home
of their race '. The poet Ziya Gok Alp, called by a country
man * the great apostle of Turanianism ', celebrates Attila,
Jenghiz, and Oghuz Khan as heroic figures that stand for the proud fame of his race, and describes the fiatherland of the Turks not as Turkey or Turkestan, but as ' the broad eternal land of Turania '. While the primary object of the National Pan-Turanian ideal is the inclusion and union of all branches of the race within the Turkish Empire, it is an important
secondary aim to give independence to all the followers of Mohammed, the united Turks being then the centre of gravity
of the world of Islam. In view of this new situation it is
of importance to examine the geographical, historical, ethno
logical, religious, and social facts bearing on the populations that may 'be affected by Pan-Turanian aspirations. It will then be easier to estimate the likelihood of these aspirations,
if unchecked, being realized. Such is the purpose of the
following pages.



';l\l,'':\': '[..': /'''. -,/ INTRODUCTION
Turania
The term ' Turanian ', as designating a group of languages and the peoples speaking those languages, is derived from the Persian Tflrdn, which is used by the Persian poet Firdusi in
his 8hahnar)ie or ' Book of Kings '
(composed about a. d. 1000)
as the name of the country beyond (i.e. north and east of) the
Oxus (now Amu Darya) as opposed to Iran or Persia. Though
the name Turdn is found neither in the inscriptions of
Darius I (521-435 B.C.) nor in Greek writers, it is of great antiquity. For its earliest form Tu7*a (with the adjective
tuirya^
' Turanian 'Y is not only repeatedly found in the ancient sacred book of the Zoroastrians, the Avesta^ but also occurs in
an Avestan hymn (gdtha) which was undoubtedly composed
by Zoroaster himself and in which the Turanian Fryana and his descendants are commemorated as faithful followers of the prophet.^ The name Tura also appears in the Avesta when it sets forth its primitive ethnographic division of the inhabi
tants of the earth, which is based solely on acquaintance with the immediate neighbours of ancient Iran. Just as in the Old
Testament Noah has three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japhet, ancestors of the three races of the earth, so Thraetaona, the successor of Yima (the Avestan Noah) has three sons, Airya,
Sairima, and Tura, between whom the earth is apportioned, Airya* receiving Iran,^ the centre, Sairima the West, and Tura the East.^' The Aryans must have been in occupation of the
Iranian plateau by 900 B.C., for we know that the Assyrian King Shalmaneser II came into conflict with one of the
Iranian tribes, the Modes, in 836 b. c. The evidence of the Avesta shows that by . the time of
Zoroaster"^ the Iranians formed a settled people who practised
agriculture, and among whom (as among the cognate Indo
Aryans) the cow, on which their industry chiefly depended,
had acquired a peculiar sanctity. It is also clear from the Avesta that hostilities prevailed between the Iranians and the
predatory nomad Turanians, who moreover differed from the former in religion. In these conflicts the Turanians were
sometimes victorious.^ Attempts were also made to proselytize the Turanians, for the Avesta states that at least one Turanian tribe was converted to Zoroastrianism,^ and it



THE TERM / TURANIAN-^ A :..::' '.: :t^"^{ i A
observes that there was hope even for the Turanian enemies-#)t' the Zoroastrian faith.^^ From a selection of Zoroastrian texts compiled about a.d. 900,^^
it appears that boundary disputes must have prevailed between
the two hostile peoples, as we read there :
^^ ' For Iran . . . and
for the sake of the pacification of a dispute which had arisen,
Auharmazd (Ormuz, Ahura Mazda) produced a great Ox, by
whom the boundary' of Iran next to Turan was intimated by
pawing with his hoofs.' In his Shahname Firdusi (c. a. d. 1000) still divides the world into three parts : one comprises the country of Roum^^
and the west, the second Turkestan^* and China, and the third the country of the heroes of Iran.^^ The boundary between Iran and Turan he defines thus :
' The whole part of the earth which is comprised between the Jihoun and the frontier of Roum, and which extends from there in a continuous line to China and Khotan, became with its cultivated and waste districts the empire of the people of Turan; the dominion of ZaP^ was to ^ end at the boundary where commenced the custom of tents,^"^
and which the Turks,^'^ on their part, were not to cross ; it was thus that the thrones and crowns were divided.' ^^ Firdusi also preserves in a modified form the Avestan story of the division of the earth and the hostility between Iranians and Turanians.
Here it is Firedhun ( = Thraetaona) who apportions the earth
among his three sons, Eraj, Tur, and Salem. The murder of Eraj by Tur leads to a blood feud between Iran and Tiiran.^^
The poet also relates that Zoroaster at the outset of his missionary career, when he failed to win converts in Iran, won
over parts of Turan to his new religion ;2^ but that later a religious war with the Turks in Turan broke out as a result
of a strenuous crusading policy.^^ Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Persian Empire (who reigned from 558 to 5.28
B.C.), was, according to Grreek sources, killed in battle against the Turanians in the north-east of the Empire ; according to
Herodotus (i. 204) he fell fighting against the Massagetae,^
who dwelt beyond the Oxus in what is now Bokhara, a part
of ancient Turan. From the above evidence, derived from Persian sources, we may gather that by the ancient Turan,
or Turania, was meant that central Asian territory which extends from the north of Persia and Afghanistan to the Aral Sea, and eastward to the borders of Chinese Turkestan, its



:H^'l '-.'- '; ; . i . INTEODUCTION
modern geographical equivalent being thus approximately represented by Eussian Turkestan.^^
Origin of the term ' Turanian '
In the second half of the nineteenth century the term
'Turanian' came into use as a loose designation of all or nearly all languages of Asiatic origin that are. neither Aryan nor Semitic. It appears to have been introduced in this sense by
Bunsen,^* who speaks of' all the languages of Asia and Europe
which are neither Semitic nor Arian '
; adding, ' I ventured
in 1847 to write all these under the name Turanian '.^^ Farrar more vaguely speaks of ' various sporadic families which some
would call Turanian '.^^ Whitney protests against ' the old
" Turanian "
aggregation, which has for a generation been a stumbling-block in the way of science '. The term is still
vaguely applied to a primary linguistic family of the eastern hemisphere which is more usually called 'Altaic'-*^ or 'UralAltaic '.^^ The word has also been used in a racial sense with
similar indefiniteness, as will appear from the following examples. Richardson in his Persian Dictionary/ (1771) treats 'Turanians' as synonymous with 'Tartars'. Hulme^^ (1861) defines the area of the ' Turanians ' as Mongolia and Manchuria.
Max Muller in 1861 writes :^^ 'The name Turanian is used in
opposition to Aryan and is applied to the nomadic races of
Asia as opposed to the agricultural Arj^an races.' Finally, it is to be inferred that Sir James Frazer^^ (1913) employs the. name as equivalent to ' Ural-Altaic ' when he says :
' The
Magyars belong to the great Turanian family of mankind.'
Gejieral distrilmtion of the Turanians
Now of the various divisions of the ethnic family, which we here propose to call Turanian in the definite sense of Ural
Altaic,^^ a part of only one, the Turks, occupies the ancient Turan, and there is evidence to show that the cradle of the
family is to be sought elsewhere.^^ At the present day we find
the Turanians occupying a broad belt of territory extending
across Asia from the Eastern Mediterranean to the Sea of Japan, and reaching in the north the coast of the Arctic
Ocean. Two of their main divisions have in their migrations overflowed into Europe ; one in the north as far westward as



GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE TURANIANS 15
tke Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, and in the south as far as Budapest; the other in the south-east has overrun a considerable part of the Balkans.
Their Common Characteiisfics^
The Turanians have several common characteristics proving
that they constitute an ethnological unit. Firstly, they all
speak the same type of language as contrasted with their neighbours, the Aryans and the Semites in the West and South- West, and the Chinese in the East. Secondly, they have a distinctive physical type, though this has, in some of the subdivisions, been almost or altogether obliterated by
absorption in other racial types with which they have come in contact or by which they have been surrounded. Thirdly, their original religion was Shamanism, which still survives in their northern and north-eastern branches and which has left
traces in the rest, though the latter have adopted the religions of the superior civilizations influencing them : Buddhism in
Eastern Asia, Mohammedanism in Central and Western Asia,
Christianity in Europe. Fourthly, in their original home, the steppes of Central Asia, they were nomads, a manner of life imposed on them by the nature of the country which they inhabited. This characteristic survives to a greater or lesser extent in all the main divisions ; and even in those branches which have adopted a settled life it is known to have existed in former times and is still recognizable in certain traces which it has left behind.
Turanian Linguistic Unity
As contrasted with the highly inflexional Indo-European and Semitic linguistic families on the one hand, and the monosyllabic Chinese on the other, the Turanian languages are
typical examples of the agglutinative form of speech. Here unchangeable roots ^* (never used alone) are combined with
suffixes, by means of what is called progressive vowel harmony, in such a way that the vowels of the endings are assimi
lated to that of the root. Thus the infinitive element male, which appears in Osmanli Turkish yaz-mak, ' to write ', becomes 7neJc in sev-mek ' to love '. Other features of Turanian speech
are that there are no prepositions, but only postpositions, and that two consonants never begin or end a word. The close



16 INTRODUCTION
linguistic relationship of the Turanian peoples was first proved by Castren^^ (l'813-53). the Finnish ethnologist and philolo
gist. He drew the essential outlines of their kinship, though research has not yet gone sufficiently into detail to settle
various minor questions of relationship.
Five Main BrayicJies
Castren set up five main branches of the Turanian family of
speech : the Finnic, the Samoyedic, the Tungusic, the Mongolic, and the Turkic. The results of recent research indicate that these five branches form two main divisions. One of them embraces the Finno-Ugrian and the Samoyedic, which
agree not only in having reached the highest development of the agglutinative system,'^^ but in sharing a striking similarity of vocabulary ; moreover, the names given to themselves by these two groups are almost identical. The other division embraces the Tunguses, the Mongols, and the Turks ; among these the Turkic and Mongolic branches are more intimately related. The affinity of these five branches, as descended from
a single parent speech, is similar to that of the eight main branches^' of the Indo-European family, but is less intimate :"^
thus Lapp and Manchu are further apart than English and Sanskrit.
Though it is well known that identity or kinship of language is no proof of the ethnic identity or kinship of the people that speak it,^^ there can be no doubt that the proto-Turanians, as shown by the ph^^sical and other characteristics of their
present-day descendants, were a single race which in prehistoric times dwelt around the Altai*" mountain range, which
is still exclusively inhabited by Turanian peoples, and which
can be shown to have been the original home of even the most remote branches of the Turanian family.
The Successive Mlgratiotis of the Turanicms
The combined evidence of their language, of historical data, and of their present habitat indicates that the Finnic branch
separated from the parent stock much earlier than any of the
others, migrating to the north and west in prehistoric times. Again, the Tunguses must have completed their migration
eastward while the Turkic and Mongol tribes were still dwell
ing side by side in the Altai steppes,



MIGEATIONS OF THE TURANIANS 17
The Mongolians, on the whole the most typical members of
the Turanian family, were the last to sever the common connexion, spreading southwards and eastwards over a territory
contiguous with their old home on the Altai range.
With the exception of one Turkish tribe (the Osmanlis) and
one section of the Finnic branch (the Hungarians), the Tura
nians have nowhere developed sufficient political aptitude to establish independent states of any permanence ; and even in
the two exceptional cases of the Turkish Empire and the King
dom of Hungary, comparative success has been due to so large
an infusion of European blood that the physical characteristics
of the Turanian race have been almost entirely obliterated in
the Osmanli Turks and the Hungarian people. Otherwise the
Turanians, distributed, though very sparsely, over a vast territory, are at the present day subject to foreign rule the Samoyeds, Finns, Tunguses, and Turco-Tatars^^ in the Russian, and the Mongols in the Chinese Republic.
Total Turanian Population
The aggregate number of Turanians, as far as can be estimated from the most recent information,*^ is about 48,000,000,
of whom about four millions more live in Asia than in Europe.
According to the latest authority, the figures in round numbers
for Europe are: Magyars, 10,000,000; Finns and Samoyeds, 6,000,000; Turks, 6,000,000; total, 22,000,000. They form very nearly 5^ per cent, of the population of the whole of Europe, and nearly 8 per cent, of the inhabitants of European Russia.*^ In Asia there are about 115,000 Finns, Samoyeds, and Tunguses, all in Asiatic Russia ; about 6,000,000 Manchus, Mongols, and Turks under Chinese rule ; 8,200,000 Turks
in Asiatic Russia;*'^ about 3,500,000 in Persia and Afghanistan; and about 8,000,000 Osmanli Turks'*^ in Asia Minor; making a total of 26,000,000 in Asia.*^
Physical Characteristics of the Turanians
The normal Turanian is middle-sized and of muscular build. He has a broad flat face, with small slanting eyes, high cheekbones, broad flat nose, thick lips, and low forehead. His com
plexion is yellowish brown, his hair straight and jet black, and his beard scanty. There has been a considerable intermixture among the Turanians themselves, especially between TURAKIANS B



18 INTRODUCTION
Samoyed, Finnish, and Turkish tribes ; also between Turkish and Mongol tribes, in the formation of the hordes with which various conquerors invaded the west. It was only on their western confines that they mingled to any extent with alien peoples, especially Slavs. Here many Finnish tribes have been strongly influenced or have even been absorbed by the
surrounding Russian population ; some peoples have preserved their language, though they have lost most of their physical Turanian characteristics, as the Hungarians and the Osmanli Turks ; while others have lost both their language and their
physical type, as the Volga Bulgars, whose name alone has survived in the Bulgarians of to-day. Only those sections of
the Turanians that have come into close contact with the
Aryans of Europe have been able to rise from their primitive civilization to a comparatively advanced state of culture, that is, the Finns in the narrow sense, the Hungarians, and the Osmanli Turks.
Original Religion of the Turanians
The primitive religion which was peculiar to the Turanians
generally goes b}^ the name of Shamanism, so called because its distinctive feature is the agency of the Shaman,^"^ or wizard priest, whose intervention is required to influence the supernatural powers. It is a religion of witchcraft, in which it is the function of the Shaman to master all that in nature is
hostile to man, to curb the elements, to conjure spirits, to pro
duce health or disease, fortune or misfortune. The Shaman
thus represents a primitive combination of priest and physician. Though he operates mainly against demons, he also
believes in higher gods, on whom he calls by means of prayer
and sacrifices to assist him in attaining his ends. Ancestor worship is, moreover, a characteristic feature of Shamanism.
Its adherents believe in the close connexion between men now living and their long deceased forefathers. This belief resulted
not only in uninterrupted worship of ancestors, but in the
conviction, leading to hereditary Shamanism, that only he
who was able to be in continuous touch with his ancestors was qualified to act as a Shaman. The drum is an important
instrument in the rites of the Shaman. It is by means of this
that he can summon spirits, through the power of his ancestors, and compel them to give active help. The methods of



ORIGINAL RELIGION OF THE TURANIANS 19
his religion are those of magic, and are mainly concerned with counteracting the attacks of hostile lower spirits. It is owing to this predominant aspect of his ritual, in which the
Shaman endeavours to establish good relations with the powers
of darkness, that the Russians regard the Shamanism of the
present day as a religion of the devil.*^ Among the Turkish peoples the Shaman is called Kam.
He directs prayers, thanksgivings, and the sacrifice, conjures spirits, purifies the house from the souls of the dead, besides
being soothsayer, weather-prophet, and physician all in one.
He appears only when summoned by the master of the house
in cases of danger, illness, death, and cattle disease. He
begins with a short conjuration, in which he inquires of his
ancestors the cause of the infliction. On ascertaining the cause, he communicates it and states what sacrifice is neces
sary, to what god it is to be offered, and in what it is to consist. There is evidence that even the ancient form of Turanian religion was not concerned merely with witchcraft. Thus, early Chinese and Christian writers state that the contemporary Turks not only paid reverence to natural
phenomena, such as sun and moon, fire, air, earth, water, as well as to the spirits of ancestors, but that they also worshipped
a deity whom they regarded as the creator of the world and to
whom they offered animal sacrifices. Mediaeval writers give a similar account of the religion of the Mongols. So at the
present day the Tunguses worship a supreme being and various
natural phenomena, besides praying to images and fetishes.
In all the Asiatic branches of the Turanian family Shaman
ism is still found. But it is only general among the Tunguses,
all the tribes of whom (except the Manchus) are devoted Shamanists. Among the Mongols, the Buryats on Lake Baikal
are the only tribe in which Shamanism is still prevalent. Among the Turks, Shamanism survives only in the tribes that
remained behind in the fertile valleys of the Altai range.
Here it is being encroached upon by Buddhism from the east
and by Christianity from the north and west. From the rest
of the Turkish peoples Shamanism has been extirpated by Islam ; nevertheless there are clear traces of the old religion among single tribes of Turkish nomads, such as the Kazak
Kirghiz. That Shamanism was formerly the religion of all
Turkish peoples is clear from the prevalence among them of
b2



20 INTRODUCTION
the Turkish name Kam for Shaman ; and in the oldest document of Turkish literature, the Uigur Kudatku Bilik
(a.d. 1070), the word Kam twice occurs in the sense of 'sooth
sayer'. The Samoyeds are still largely Shamanists, their
religious beliefs being much the same as those of the Tunguses.
On the other hand, the Hungarians and Finns adopted Christianity many centuries ago. But those Finnish peoples
that still retain some memory of their former paganism show traces of beliefs like those of the rest of the Turanians.
Turanian Civilizatioti
When the Turanians first appeared on the stage of history their civilizatioii was of a very primitive type, which they have
preserved on much the same level, with the few exceptions
caused by European contact, down to the present time. While
the Chinese, Egyptians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Indians,
Persians, Greeks, and Romans cultivated the earth and built cities in remote antiquity, the Turanians were nomads, and they have remained so to this day except where brought to
a standstill by the dam which the European nations opposed
to them in the west. Since the time of Zoroaster, when they
first became known, till now, they have retained unchanged
the patriarchal system of government without advancing to
any higher stage of political organization. Their nomad habits facilitated the formation of those hordes which at successive periods poured into and devastated eastern Europe. Their unsettled habits have, since the adoption of Islam by the
Turkic branch, made them for centuries the main cause o unrest in the history of the world. The struggle between the Aryan and the Turanian has thus been going on for nearly
3,000 years, from the age of Zoroaster down to the present day. The chief reason of the persistence of the nomadic civilization of the Turanians appears to be the fact that the cultivable soil of the ancient world had already been taken possession of by the Chinese, the Aryans, and the Semites, while the ProtoTuranians were still occupying their original homes around
the Altai mountains. They were consequently compelled to continue wandering in barren steppes to maintain themselves,
and the struggle for existence naturally brought them into predatory conflict with the settled and more prosperous neigh
bouring peoples. The immemorial nomad habit has in the



TURANIAN CIVILIZATION 21
course of thousands of years become so ingrained in their nature that it appears to be the chief means by which they
preserve any sense of nationality, for they lack the unifying
bonds of political organization. Hence when they once, by contact with a higher civilization, take to life in fixed abodes,
they rapidly lose their racial identity by absorption in the
population of their more cultured neighbours.
One of the consequences of their migratory life, as affecting the Turanians themselves, is the perpetual feuds, chiefly concerning boundaries, which have from time immemorial prevailed among their tribes, and which have largely fostered the fighting spirit among them. Another effect has been the universal practice of exogamy in those Turanian tribes which have adhered to the nomadic manner of life. For as marriage
between blood relations, as represented by the clan, are avoided among them, brides are sought in other clans or tribes
of the same people, the members of which are no longer
regarded as akin.
After this general survey of the Turanians, we can proceed to examine their main divisions and subdivisions in detail. It would seem most suitable to treat the five branches in order
of geographical contiguity Finno-Ugrians, Samoyeds, Tun
guses, Mongols, and Turks beginning with the Finns who
came into contact with European peoples in very early times, and ending with the Turks, whose invasions of Europe during
the Middle Ages threatened to involve Western civilization in destruction, whose conquest of the Balkans has for centuries been a cause of war and political unrest, and whose present ambitions may continue to be a source of danger to the peace of the world in days to come.

CHAPTER II
THE FINNO-UGEIAN DIVISION
Habitat. This branch of the Turanian family consists of the
two principal groups of the Finns and the Ugrians, the former being represented by the Finns proper, the latter mainly by
the Hungarians. The Finnish group inhabits partly the region lying between the eastern Baltic, the Arctic Ocean, and the White Sea, and partly the districts of eastern Russia situated near the middle course of the Volga. The Ugrians, so called
from Ugra, the old name of the country on both sides of the Ural mountains, where they all dwelt in former times and
where two branches of them still remain, but whence the
Hungarians long ago migrated till they finally settled in their present country on the Middle Danube. The Finnish group appear in the course of their migration to have reached their
present habitat by the first century of our era, while the
Hungarians took possession of the territory which they now occupy at the end of the ninth century. Number. The total Finno-Ugrian population amounts to
about 16,000,000, almost entirely located in Europe. Excepting some 25,000 in north-west Siberia, the Ugrian population is
represented by the Hungarians with nearly 10,000,000. The Finnish branch is, with the exception of about 60,000, almost equally divided between Norwaj^ and Sweden, otherwise confined to the Russian Empire, with a total of rather over
6,000,000. Some of the Finno-Ugrian tribes still retain their
nomad habits, though they generally appear to avoid open
steppes, preferring wooded country, especially in the vicinity of rivers and lakes.
Language. The speech of the Finno-Ugrians forms a homogeneous linguistic unit, undivided by any striking differences. It is distinguished from the other divisions of the Turanian
family both in grammar and vocabulary. The tendency to
form compounds is very marked in Finnish and Hungarian,
as well as in some of the other languages of this group. Vowel
harmony is completely observed in Finnish and Hungarian,



CHARACTEEISTICS AND CIVILIZATION 25
though in the other languages it has been either imperfectly developed or has been lost under Eussian influences.
Some of the minor tribes have lost their native dialects,
having exchanged them for those of the surrounding alien population.
Finno-Ugrian Characteristics and Civilization
Characteristics. In physique the Finno-Ugrians are for the
most part strongly built and of middle height, with a tendency to
be short, squat, and brachycephalic Their complexion is greyish or olive-coloured ; their eyes are grey or blue, their hair light,
and their beard scanty. They are as a rule wanting in energy
and alertness both of mind and body. They are slow and
conservative, inclined to be suspicious and vindictive, taciturn
and melancholy. With the exception of the Hungarians, they
have hardly ever displayed warlike qualities. The favourable side of their character includes patience, perseverance and
industry, faithfulness, and honesty. When they get over their
natural distrust of strangers, they are found to be friendly and
hospitable.
Civilization. Various stages of progress are apparent among the Finno-Ugrians. Some, as the Finns and the Hungarians, have, at least in the towns, adopted the ordinary civilization of Europe. These two are the only Turanian peoples who,
while following in the steps of European culture, have preserved their individual nationality. Other tribes have adopted
agricultural pursuits. These are mostly insignificant populations living scattered in Russia, which will doubtless in course of time be absorbed in the surrounding Slavonic population.
The lowest stage is represented by the wilder tribes, such as
the Ostyaks, Voguls, and Lapps, who are still nomads, though
as a rule they no longer frequent open steppes. They are
generally keen hunters. They are mostly divided into a num
ber of small clans which are exogamous. Women among
them occupy a very inferior position, being treated as servants,
and not being allowed to take part in their heathen religious
ceremonies. There is still found among them the most primitive form of house, which consists of converging poles covered with skins or sods so as to form a screen round a central fire.
Their winter dwellings are partly underground. They use
long snow-shoes in winter, and largely employ boats in summer.



26 THE FINNO-UaRIAN DIVISION
The evidence of the higher numerals, which vary in the
different languages and are sometimes evidently borrowed, indicates that their original system of counting did not extend
beyond seven ; and even now these tribes show little aptitude for calculation or trade. Those tribes which have not been subject to direct European influence have even at the present
day not progressed beyond the simplest form of patriarchal
government. The nomadic tribes are now partially beginning to settle down.
Religion. With the exception of a few outlying tribes, the Finno-Ugrians have adopted Christianity ; but several thousands of the Ugrian Ostyaks and Voguls and the east Finnish Cheremisses are still unbaptized. Many old pagan beliefs also survive among the nominal Christians, besides
being found in poetry such as the Kalevala. The deities here
are chiefly spirits representing phenomena of nature. Thus, there is a forest god among the Finns, Lapps, and Cheremisses.
Again, Yumala, the Finnish name for god, seems originally to
mean ' sky '.^ Traces of ancestor worship also survive. Thus,
the Ostyaks sacrifice to ghosts and make images of the more important dead. Images are also found in the tombs and
barrows of most Finno-Ugrian tribes. The Voguls still use
idols, generally wooden, to which animal sacrifices are offered, and the lips of which are sometimes besmeared with blood. Some curious combinations of Christianity and paganism are found. Thus, the Cheremisses are said to sacrifice to the Virgin Mary. All the tribes seem to believe that disease, due to possession by an evil spirit, can be both caused and cured by
spells and incantations, to which they attribute extraordinary
potency. Such belief is conspicuous in the Kalevala. A
knowledge of the necessary magical formulae is possessed by wizards (the equivalent of the Shamans of the Central Asian
Turanians), who are both exorcists and mediums able to ascertain the will of the gods. Their oflice is generally
hereditary. A magical drum plays a prominent part in their
invocations. Thus it appears that the three main features of
the original Finno-Ugrian religion were nature worship, ancestor worship, and witchcraft. History. Most of the Finno-Ugrian tribes have no recorded history, and their oral traditions shed but scanty light on
their past.



HISTORY OF THE FINNO-UGRIANS 27
It is only the Finns proper, and especially the Hungarians, who, in their later period, play a part in ordinary European
history. The linguistic and archaeological data collected chiefly by Finnish scholars have made it possible to reconstruct in outline the migrations of these tribes. The results of these
investigations are the following. The Finno-Ugrians originally lived together east of the Ural mountains, and spoke
a common language. They were hunters and fishermen, not
agriculturists. At some remote period of antiquity they
moved into Europe, and perhaps settled on the Volga and
the Oka, where they learned some rudiments of agriculture. They were still in the neolithic stage. About 600 b. c. they
came in contact with an Iranian people, from whom they learned the use of metals and borrowed the numerals for 100 and 1,000. Hungarian and some other languages also borrowed
the word for 10. There was probably a trade route up the Volga in the fourth century b.c. About that time the Western
Finns must have separated from the rest and begun migrating north-westwards. Soon after the Christian era they came into contact with Letto-Lithuanian peoples in the Baltic
provinces, and then with Scandinavians. From both Lithuanians and Scandinavians they borrowed a very large number of words expressing materials and ideas of civilization. Thus the Finnish names for gold, king, and everything concerned
with government are Scandinavian in origin. The Finns had
probably completed their occupation of Finland by about
A.D. 700. Meanwhile the Slav tribes known later as Russians, which had been coming up from the south, pressed the Finns northward and separated the Western from the Eastern Finns
and the Ugrians, who were driven back towards the east. The introduction of Christia^ity among the Finns about a. d. 1000
was followed by a long political and religious struggle between
them and the Swedes. About a. d. 1300 Finland was definitely converted and annexed to Sweden, remaining a dependency of that country till 1809, when it was ceded to Russia.
The Western Finns have thus been almost completely dominated by Swedish civilization.
The Ugrians and the Eastern Finns, cut off from a westward movement, came in contact with tribes of another division of
the Turanians, the Turks or Tatars, by whom they were more
or less Tatarized. Some tribes adopted a Tatar language.



28 THE FINNO-UGRIAN DIVISION
while others (the Mordvins, Cheremisses, and Votyaks) bor
rowed many Tatar words. One of the large settlements
formed by Eastern Finns was Great Bulgaria on the Volga,
which continued to exist as a state till 1238, when it was destroyed by the Mongols, another division of the Turanians.
A branch of these Bulgarians had many centuries earlier
migrated to the Balkan peninsula, where they were so completely Slavonized that the identity of their language and
race survives only in the name of the Bulgaria of to-day.
The Hungarians, after moving westward, remained during part of the ninth century in a district probably lying between
the Dnieper arid the Danube. Then crossing the Carpathians
they conquered the old Roman provinces of Pannonia and
Dacia, which they have now occupied for a little more than a thousand years.
A. The Finns
Name. It is certain that the Finns were in Europe soon
after the beginning of our era. The earliest authority for the
name, the meaning of which is entirely doubtful, is Tacitus (c. A. D. 100). In his Germania (ch. 46) he locates the Fenni in
the country which is now Lithuania, and describes them as a tribe of hunters in the lowest stage of civilization, poor, living in tents, and wearing skins. It is to be inferred from his account that they were without any knowledge of reindeer
and of the use of snow-shoes. Half a century later Ptolemy
wrongly pushes the Finns, whom he calls ^lwol, to the southwest on his map, placing them to the east of the Vistula, between the Ovii/eSoi ("Wends) and TvOmves (Goths). But the habitat which he assigns to them at any rate shows that they must by that time have advanced to the neighbourhood of the
Baltic. The name assigned by these two ancient authorities,
Fenni and ^lwol or ^ei/i/oi, undoubtedly survives in that of the inhabitants of Finland. Earlier Habitat It is thus probable that the Finns had by the beginning of our era moved from their earlier habitat on the Ural farther northwards, and at the time of Tacitus extended from the Ural to the region of the Baltic, occupying the whole of the territory of Northern and Central Russia of to-day ; for
many Finnish place-names are found in these regions. Much later other branches of the Finnish race still lived near the



THE FINNS 29
Ural MouD tains, and even to the east of them on the Irtish river. At that time these branches were probably not separated
by Slavs, but occupied all the intervening country. Thus at the time of Nestor (eleventh century) there lived in the interior
of Eussia Finnish tribes which have now disappeared. Again,
the still existing Finnish tribes were formerly much larger, for with the spread of Christianity they have been more and more absorbed by the Russians, and, in any case, as nomads in
former times they required more territory than they do now as agriculturists. It is probable that before the Teutonic
migrations a large part of Eussia was occupied by Finns, and that before the incursion of the Slavs the north of Russia was the exclusive possession of Finnish tribes. After the Goths moved to the Pontus, the Teutons became acquainted with the Finno-Ugrian tribes of inner Russia. Among the
peoples ruled by the Ostrogoth king Hermanarik, the Mordens
(i. e. the Mordvins described below) are mentioned ^ in the fourth century of our era. That the Finns extended southward
as far as the isthmus between Don and Volga is indicated by
the fact that the Volga first became known by its Mordvin
name Rhau to Ptolemy, who calls it the Ra.^ Early Civilization. The numerous words borrowed by the Finns from the Teutons are important as throwing light on
the state of civilization at which the former had arrived by the time they came into contact with the Teutons.*
From this evidence it is clear that the Finns borrowed mythological ideas as well as customs from their Teutonic
neighbours. The results of research, however, do not so far
justify the assumption that the geographical contiguity of
Finns and Teutons goes back into prehistoric times. Accord
ing to A. Hackmann,^ the Finns when they migrated into
Finland were already familiar with the use of iron. The
Teutons were deeply impressed by the Shamanism of the
Finns, and marvelled at their skill in magic.*^ It was not long before the Teutons entered into trade relations with their
northern neighbours, and they early imposed tribute in furs
upon them, as we learn from Old Norse authorities."'
Finns and Lapps. The old Teutonic authorities extended
the name of Finns to the inhabitants of the high latitudes of
the Scandinavian north, the Lapps, who, though they at the



30 THE FINNO-UGEIAN DIVISION
present day both culturally and racially diverge widely from
the Finns, were at that early period hardly as yet differen
tiated in language and physical type from the Finns of Finland. This is the Finna land of the Anglo-Saxon epic
Beowulf (a. D. 580). In Norway even now the Lapps are
called Finner (old Norse Finnar) or Finns.
i. The Western or Baltic Fimis
The Finnish people that is the most important, both numeri
cally and culturally, are the Finns proper. In their own language they call their country SuomL Habitat. They inhabit mainly the Grand-Duchy of Finland,
which till the fall of the Czar was governed by the Emperor of
Russia as its Grand Duke, but which in October 1917 declared itself an autonomous Republic, and more recently a constitutional monarchy. It is situated between the gulfs of Bothnia
and Finland, including also farther north a large territory in Lapland. They are also scattered over the adjacent Russian
Governments of Olonets, Archangel, Novgorod, Petrograd Tver, Yaroslavl, besides certain districts of Norway (Finn
marken in the extreme north, above Finland) and of Sweden. There are two main subdivisions of the Finns the Tavasts who occupy the southern and western parts of the GrandDuchy, while the Karelians are found to the north and east of them. Number. The number of the Finns in Finland in 1900 was
2,352,990,^ constituting 86 per cent, of the inhabitants of
the Grand-Duchy, the remaining 14 per cent, being Swedes. There are besides about 8,000 in Norway, 20,000 in Sweden,
and about 200,000^ distributed over the adjacent parts of
Russia proper. A considerable number of emigrant Finns
also now live in the United States of America. The total number of Finns at the present day may be estimated at
something over 2,600,000.1^ Language. The Finnish language is fundamentally Turanian,
and in particular has very fully developed the characteristic feature of vowel harmony. But it has been profoundly in
fluenced by Scandinavian, both in vocabulary and structure. In its present form it consists of Turanian material recast in an Aryan mould. It is full of Swedish words, some of the
simplest terms being borrowed from Scandinavian. The



WESTEEN OR BALTIC FINNS 31
grammar has been radically modified, both by the rejection of
un-Aryan and by the adoption of Aryan peculiarities. The various nominal or verbal forms are no longer merely roots
with a string of obvious suffixes attached, but the ending
forms a whole with the root as in Greek and Latin inflexions. The adjective is declined and agrees with its substantive. The verb forms compound tenses by means of auxiliaries. There is also an abundant supply of relative pronouns and
particles. Literature. The oldest linguistic material in Finnish
consists of lists of single words, chiefly personal and proper names, compiled in the first half of the thirteenth century.
But the first Finnish book did not appear till 1544. An
energetic study of the national language as well as antiquities has resulted in the publication of numerous works in Finnish. Several collections of Finnish popular and mythological
poetry have been published, and there is a copious general
modern literature in Finnish.
Characteristics. In physique the Finns, as opposed to the
Swedish-speaking population who retain their Scandinavian
characteristics, are a strong and hardy people, short in stature,
with almost round head, and neck very full and strong. The forehead is low, the face flat, the cheek-bones prominent,
the eyes mostly grey and slanting somewhat inwards. The
nose is short and flat, the mouth protruding, the lips thick, the beard weak and sparse. The hair, which was no doubt
originally black, is now brown, red, or even fair. The complexion is brownish. The Finns are morally upright, hospitable, faithful, and submissive, but are also somewhat stolid, indolent, irascible, and vindictive. They are dis
tinguished by a keen sense of personal freedom and inde
pendence. Many of these physical and moral qualities they
have in common with the other divisions of the Turanians. The qualities in which they diverge are doubtless due to the considerable infusion of Swedish blood which they have
undergone.
Civilization. Originally leading a nomadic life as hunters
and fishers, the Finns have long ago succumbed to the
influence of European civilization. They are now everywhere settled as herdsmen, agriculturists, traders, or follow the various other occupations of a modern European state. They



32 THE FINNO-UGRIAN DIVISION
may be said to be on the same cultural level as tbe Swedes, whose civilization they have adopted and under whose
political system they lived for centuries. The early Finlanders, before they came under Swedish influence, do not seem to
have had any political organization, but to have lived in separate communities independent of each other. It is a striking feature of the country life of the Finns of to-day that they hardly ever live in houses clustered together as villages, but in isolated farms in the middle of their fields and meadows.^^ This may be a survival from their nomadic period,
when, owing to the necessity of wide pasturage, their dwell
ings lay far apart. Religion, The higher religion of the. ancient Finns consisted
in the worship of gods who were the personified forces of
nature, as Ukko the god of the air, Akti the god of waters, and others. After their contact with the Swedes, the Christianization of the country began in the twelfth, and was
completed by the end of the following century. In 1529 Gustavus Vasa introduced the Lutheran form of
Protestantism, which has remained the religion of the country
in spite of the temporary effort, made under Russian rule in the reign of Alexander III, to subject the Finns to the Orthodoxy of the Greek Church.
History. The migration of the Finns into the regions now inhabited by them began at the latest in the fourth century of
our era, and by a. d. 700 they were probably in complete possession of the Finland of to-day. They probably found the
Lapps in previous occupation of the country. It was not till the introduction of Christianity in the middle of the twelfth century that they were brought into contact with civilized
Europe. The early Finlanders seem to have been both brave and
aggressive. Their 'repeated attacks on the coast of Sweden resulted in the invasion of their country in 1157 by the
Swedish King Eric IX, who conquered the people and had
them baptized. Finland was gradually reverting to inde
pendence and paganism, when in 1209 a missionary bishop
named Thomas (an Englishman) arrived and began the work
of reviving Christianity.
He nearly succeeded in detaching Finland from Sweden
and forming it into a province subject only to the Pope. In



WESTERN OR BALTIC FINNS 33
1249 the famous Birger Yarl undertook a crusade in Finland, compelling the Tavasts, the western subdivision of the Finns
proper, to accept Christianity. After finally subjugating the country, the Swedes spread their civilization among the
Finlanders, gave them laws, according to them the same
civil rights as belonged to themselves, and introduced agriculture and other beneficial arts into the country. .Gustavus
Vasa and his successor did much for Finland by founding
schools, building churches, encouraging learning, and intro
ducing printing. In the beginning of the seventeenth century Gustavus Adolphus established the Diet of Finland, composed
of the four orders of the nobility, clergy, burghers, and peasants.
The conquest of Finland by Sweden resulted in almost continuous wars between that country and Russia, in the course of which Finland was constantly devastated and suffered great misery. Peter the G-reat tried to wrest Finland from Sweden, and by 1716 was in occupation of the whole country. In
consequence, the province of Viborg, the eastern division of
Finland, was in 1721 finally ceded to Russia. After two unsuccessful attempts to recover the lost province, war broke out again between the two countries in 1808, but was ended in 1809 by the cession of the whole of Finland, and the Aland
Islands to Russia. Finland, however, did not become a part
of Russia as a conquered province, but, maintaining her free constitution and fundamental laws, became a semi-independent Grand-Duchy with the Tsar as Grand Duke. But towards the
end of Alexander Ill's reign, the Slavophil movement in Russia began to aim at subjecting Finland to orthodoxy and
autocracy. With the accession of Nicholas II, the constitutional conflict became acute, and the 'February manifesto' of 1899
virtually abrogated the legislative power of the Finnish Diet.
Russian officials and the Russian language were forced on
Finland, and in April 1903 the Russian Governor was invested
with practically dictatorial powers. To all this the people of
Finland opposed a determined resistance, which in November 1905 culminated in a national strike.
' As a result the demands of Finland were granted and the status quo ante 1899
was restored. In 1908-10 friction with Russia was again
renewed, the Imperial Government repeating the attempt to
curtail the power of the Finnish Diet. The collapse of the
Russian Empire holds out to Finland the prospect of gaining
TURANIANS C

permanent freedom. In October 1917 a commission of the Finnish Diet was appointed to work out a scheme of Finnish autonomy in federation with Russia.

a. The Karelians
Habitat, The Karelians form the second of the two main subdivisions of the Finns in the narrow sense. They occupy
the east and the north of Finland, extending from the extreme east end of the Grulf of Finland past Lake Ladoga towards
the White Sea, and southward from the Government of Arch
angel through Olonets (around Lake Onega), Novgorod, and
Tver. Three small groups of Karelians are also found in Ingria, which forms the northern and north-western part of the Government of Petrograd. They are believed to have migrated here from Finland about a.d. 1100. There appear, moreover, to be authentic traces of a Karelian population in the Governments of Kaluga (south of Moscow), Yaroslavl (east of Tver), Vladimir, and Tambov, as far south as the Volga, but here they have been merged in the Slav people. Though the
Karelians are not generally regarded as separate from the Finns, they have long been a distinct tribe. Living farther east, they have come less under Swedish and more under
Russian influence than the inhabitants of West Finland. But as many of the districts which they inhabit are out of the way,
the Russian influence has not been strong. Hence they have
adopted less of European civilization, and have in places
preserved their own customs better than the Westerners. Number. The total number of Karelians is about 260,000,^ ^
of whom about 63,000 live in Olonets, and about 195,000 in Novgorod and Tver. These figures include the Karelians of
the southern districts who can still be distinguished from the
Russians, but not any estimate of those who have become
totally absorbed in the Slav population.
Language. The language of the Karelians is practically the same as that of the Tavasts or Western Finns. It is,



WESTERN OE BALTIC FINNS 35
however, purer Finnish, because it has been far less subjected to Swedish influence.
The great national epic of the Finns, the Kalevala, was collected among the Karelians, chiefly in East Finland and Olonets, by Elias Lonnrot in 1835. It is only since then that
the Finnish language has been used for literary composition, and it has been so used with ever- increasing enthusiasm. Several authors have distinguished themselves in this way ;
but the most gifted of the imaginative writers in Finnish is
Johani Aho, who was born in 1861. The most important works on the language itself have been Lonnrot's great Finnish -Swedish Dictionary and Donner's Comparative
Dictionary of the Finno-Ugrian languages (in German).
Those of the Karelians who live near Russian settlements
can generally speak Russian, though they use their own language among themselves.
Characteristics, The Karelians are slighter in build and better proportioned than the Finns. Owing doubtless to intermixture with the Russians, they resemble the latter to a considerable extent. Their eyes are usually blue, their hair is
generally brown or reddish, and is clipped level with the
eyebrows. They have low foreheads. The Karelians are more
enterprising, vivacious, and sociable, but less persevering than the Finns.
Occupations. The occupations in which the Karelians engage
are very various. One of them is agriculture, which however
in their habitat is a struggle against nature. Another,^
the best and most profitable, is the felling, transport, and floating of timber for the saw-mills. Fishing in rivers and
lakes is a common occupation among them. They also fish in
the sea for salmon, herring, and marine animals in Kandalaksha
Bay (the north-western branch of the White Sea). Hunting
in the forests has been reduced from what it was in former
days since the law against trapping was passed in 1892. The
carrying trade with Finland, which used to be extensively
practised, has also been reduced since the Finns have taken
to opening a shop in almost every Karelian village.
Dwellings and Food. The houses of the Karelians are built
on a sort of permanent scaffolding and are reached by ladders.
A corridor divides the rest of the house from the store shed. On the ground below are sheep pens and cattle sheds. The c2



36 THE FINNO-UGEIAN DIVISION
principal food of the Karelians consists of fish and vegetables ;
but they also use flour. On fast days they eat salted mushrooms and edible fungi stewed with turnips and potatoes. They
brew a sort of country beer called hraga. They do not drink vodJca. Religion. Owing to E/Ussian influence the Karelians belong
to the orthodox Greek Church, while the Finns are Lutheran Protestants. The Karelians began to be Christianized in the thirteenth century.
We learn from Russian Chronicles that in the year 1227 Prince Yaroslav sent out priests to baptize a number of Karelians. According to a bull of 1351 the Karelians had before that date adopted the Catholic doctrine, which the same bull informs us they had been obliged by the Russians to renounce.
History. Though the language of both tribes is the same, the Karelians have not only always been separated from the Tavasts while in the north, but have even often been engaged in actual hostilities with them. Their history is almost entirely unknown till the time of the Swedish invasion in the twelfth
century. They are first mentioned in the ninth century. An
early Norse account ^^ states that in a.d. 877 a vassal of Harold Haarfagar in Lapland was visited by an envoy of the Kvens
(or Finns) ^* and asked for help against the Karelians, who had
been devastating their land. We further gather from a Saga that the Karelians, as well as other Finnish tribes, were tributary to the Swedish King Eric Edmundsson, who died in A.D. 833. It is most probable that the Russians of Novgorod began early in the twelfth century to exact tribute from the Karelians. They had to enforce it sword iii hand, for it was
resisted by the Karelians, who in 1187 murdered the Novgorod tribute collectors. But in spite of the conflicts between the
Novgorod Russians and the Karelians^ they often made common cause. The Karelians are mentioned (for the first time in Russian history) as having in 1143 made a raid against the Finns (whom the Russians call Yem). They also fought on
the side of the Novgorodians against Sweden. But in 1323
a peace was concluded by which the Russians ceded a large part of Karelia to Sweden. Peter the Great wrested Karelia from Sweden in 1721, since when it has been part of the Russian Empire.

Nestor (eleventh century), the reputed author of the earliest
Russian Chronicle, mentions a trade route from Greece along the Dnieper and Lovat to Lake Ilmen (on which Novgorod is
situated) and thence down the Volchov, the Ladoga, and the
Neva into the Gulf of Finland. The Karelians as inhabiting these latter regions naturally took part in the trade which passed through their country. Bjorko in the Gulf of Finland
was the emporium of this trade, and during the Middle Ages
used to be a depository for the trade of the Hanseatic towns with Russia.

b. Other Western Finns
There are in Western Russia four other tribes of Baltic
Finns, which are closely allied in speech.
1. The Vepsas, or Northern Chudes, inhabit the country round the upper course of the Oyat river (east of Lake Ladoga),
and extend to the south-west of Lake Onega in the Government
of Olonets. There is written evidence that the Vepsas and Karelians lived on the north-east of Lake Kubinsk (north of the town of Vologda) as late as the middle of the thirteenth
century. A hundred years later a Russian monk, who founded a monastery at the south-east corner of Lake Onega, mentions
the Chudes (Vepsas) and Lapps as living in the neighbourhood
of that lake.^'"* The Vepsas probably represent the Ves, who
are stated by the Russian Chronicle to have lived near Lake
Bielozero (60 N., 38' E.). They now number about 25,000,
being the remnant of a once much larger tribe. Both the Vepsas and the Votes are closely allied in language to the Esthonians. 2. The Votes, or Southern Chudes, at one time probably the original inhabitants of the whole of Ingria, the district round
Petrograd, are now restricted to about thirty parishes in
the north-western part of that region. They were partly
driven out of their old home by Karelians from Finland and by Russians from the south.
They are first mentioned by Nestor in 1069.^^ About ten
years ago they numbered, together with the Ingrian Karelians,
about 14,000.1^ 3. The Esthonians inhabit the province of Esthonia, the



38 THE FINNO-UGEIAN DIVISION
north of Livonia, nearly as far south as the river Salis, as well as the islands of Dago and Oesel. There are also smaller
groups of them to the east in the neighbouring Governments
of Petrograd, Pskov, and Vitebsk. The name Est or Ehst, by
which they are known to foreigners, is probably the same as
the Aestii of Tacitus, though the latter designation originally belonged to a totally different tribe. The Esthonians call
themselves md Tties or ' country people ', and their country vivo. They are the peasantry of the Russian province of Esthonia and of the neighbouring districts. Next to the Finns they are the largest western tribe, the
Esthonian population exceeding 1,000,000.
They were serfs till 1817, when they were freed. But their condition was so little improved that a serious rebellion broke
out among them in 1859. Owing to the influence of the
surrounding Russian and German population, they have
become more civilized than the other tribes in these regions.
Two dialects may be distinguished in the Esthonian language, a northern spoken around Reval, and a southern around
Dorpat. The oldest linguistic records are single words, mostly place and personal names, dating from the first half of the thirteenth century. The first traces of their literature, which made a great start in the nineteenth century, goes back to the sixteenth.

4. The Livonians are the old Finnish inhabitants of West Livland (or Livonia) and North Kurland. They have become almost entirely absorbed by the Letts. They are mentioned
as a warlike, predatory pagan tribe in the Middle Ages. Their
language has borrowed almost half its vocabulary from Lettic, which has also influenced its word-formation and syntax. It
is a dying language, which twenty-five years ago was spoken by about 2,000 people. It survives, if at all, only along a
narrow strip of coast in the extreme north-west of Kurland. ^^

WESTERN OR BALTIC FINNS 39
c. The Lapps
Linguistically the Lapps are closely allied to the western
branch of the Finns, but racially they occupy a somewhat
doubtful position. Habitat. The territory inhabited by the Lapps is chiefly
the extreme north of the Scandinavian peninsula, for the most
part within the Arctic Circle, whither they have been driven
by the Finns. The term Lapland is used to designate some
what vaguely the region occupied by the Lapps in Norway,
Sweden, Finland, and Russia. In Norway it covers the divi
sion of Finmarken and the higher inland parts of Tromso and
Nordland ; in Sweden the districts of Norbotten and Vesterbotten, besides the ^lyq districts called Lappmark ; in Finland
the northern part of the district of Uleaborg, chiefly around
Lake Enare ; and in Russia the western part of the Govern
ment of Archangel in the Kola peninsula. The southern
boundary of the Lapps in Sweden is roughly 64*" N., though
scattered families of them occur much farther south. Names, The Lapps are by the Swedes called Lapper, by the Russians Lapari, and by the Norwegians Finner. They
call their country Sahme or Same, and themselves Samelats :
names almost identical with those employed by the Finns for
their own country and race. ' Lapp ' is probabty a nickname
imposed by foreigners. Classes. The Laplanders may be divided into the three
classes of Mountain Lapps, Forest Lapps, and Fisher Lapps,
the proportions of the three varying according to the nature of the territory which they inhabit. The first two classes are nomadic, and are the true representatives of their race.^^ In the wandering life of the mountain Lapp, his autumn residence
on the borders of the forest district may be considered the central point. It is there that he erects on piles his small wooden storehouse. Early in November he begins to wander south or east into the forest land, and, in Sweden, occasionally visits the towns. About the beginning of May he is back at
his storehouse ; but as soon as the weather grows warm he
pushes up to the mountains, and there throughout the summer pastures his herds and prepares his stores of cheese. By
October he is busy at his storehouse, killing the surplus rein
deer and curing meat for the winter. In Norway the Mountain



40 THE FINNO-UaEIAN DIVISION
Lapps lead a harder life. There they are in winter usually
settled near the churches, while in summer they visit the coasts. Flesh is the favourite and in winter the only food of the Mountain Lapps. They also use reindeer milk and cheese, and rye or barley cakes.
The Forest Lapp is mainly distinguished by the narrower
limits of his nomadic life. He never migrates outside a certain district. For in this he possesses hereditary rights and maintains a series of camping grounds which he visits in regular rotation. In April or May he sets his reindeer free to wander as
they please ; but immediately after midsummer, when the
mosquitoes become troublesome, he collects them again. About the end of August they are again let loose, but are once
more collected in October. During the winter the Forest
Lapp pursues the same course of life as the Mountain Lapp. Besides the Mountain Lapps, there are in Norway both River
and Sea Lapps. The E-iver Lapps, many of whom are descend
ants of Finns proper, breed cattle, attempt a little tillage, and entrust their reindeer to the care of Mountain Lapps. The
Sea Lapps are in some respects hardly to be distinguished from the other coast dwellers of Finmark. In Finland the great bulk of the comparatively few Laplanders in the Duchy belong to the fisher class, many of them
being settled in the neighbourhood of Lake Enare. In the
spring they go down to the Norwegian coast to take part in the sea-fisheries, returning to the Lake about midsummer.
Formerly they found the capture of wild deer a profitable
occupation. The Eussian Lapps are also for the most part fishers. They maintain a half-nomadic life, very few having become settlers
in the Eussian villages. It is usual to distinguish them according to the district of the coast which they frequent, as
Murman and Terian Lapps. A separate tribe, the Filmans
(i.e. Finmans), who wander about various tundras, or mossy steppes, along the northern coast of the Kola peninsula, owe their peculiar dialect and their Lutheran creed to a former connexion with Sweden. Number. The total number of the Lapps is over 30,000, distributed as follows: in Norway, 20,786 (in 1891); in
Sweden, 7,000 (in 1904) ; in Eussia 2,040 (in 1897) ; and in



WESTERN OE BALTIC FINNS 41
Finland about 1,000. They seem to be increasing in Norway,
and are pushing farther south. But in Sweden they are
gradually abandoning their nomad habits and becoming merged in the Swedish population.
Language. The Lappish language is very closely connected
with Finnish, but its phonetics are diiFerent and more complicated. It is broken up into very distinct and even mutually
unintelligible dialects, owing chiefly to the influence of the various nationalities with which the Lapps have been in
contact. An eminent authority, Baron G. von Duben, dis
tinguishes four leading dialects, but a greater number is recognizable. Thus, according to Lonnrot, there are in Russian Lapland alone three dialects due to the influence of Norwegian,
Karelian, and Russian respectively. Lappish has borrowed many words from Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, and Russian. That it began at a very early period to borrow from Old Norse is shown by the use it still makes of Scandinavian forms
belonging to a linguistic stage older even than that of
Icelandic. An analysis of their vocabulary throws some light on the state of their civilization before they came in contact
with the Norse. Thus agricultural terms, the names of the metals, and the word for 'smith' are all of Scandinavian origin. Literature. The language of the Lapps was long ago reduced
to writing by missionaries, but very little has been printed in
it except school-books and religious works. The New Testa
ment was only translated into Norwegian Lappish in 1840,
and it was not till 1895 that the entire Bible was printed in the same dialect. The only Gospel that has been translated into Russian L/appish is that of St. Matthew in two versions.
A number of Lappish popular tales and songs have also been
taken down from the lips of the people and published. One
of the Saga-like pieces thus preserved seems to contain
a reminiscence of the original home of the race in Central
Asia ; for a reference to Lake Baikal, and possibly also to the Altai Mountains, has been found there. The story of Nyavvisena, daughter of the sun, is full of quaint folklore about the taming of the reindeer.
Characteristics. The most obvious physical characteristic of
the Lapps is shortness of stature, the average height of the
men being 5 ft. and of the women 4 ft. 9 in. The body is as
a rule fairly well proportioned, but the legs are rather short



42 THE FINNO-UGRIAN DIVISION
and inclined to be bandy. The complexion, though usually dark, is sometimes fair. The colour of the hair varies from
blond and reddish to a bluish or greyish black. The eyes are
^
black, hazel, blue, or grey. Besides being the shortest, thfe
Lapp is the most brachycephalic type of man in Europe,
perhaps in the world,^*^ their average cephalic index being
about 83. In width of face the women are more Turanian than the men. but in neither sex is the opening of the
, eye, though narrow, really oblique. The nose is always low
and broad. The muscular system is usually well developed.
But there is a deficiency of fatty tissue which affects the
features (especially by making the eyes prominent) and the general character of the skin, the thinness of which can hardly
be paralleled among other Europeans. Among the Lapps, as among other lower races, the index is shorter than the ring
finger. The Lapps are a quiet and an inoffensive people, among
whom crimes of violence are almost unknown. The only
breach of law common among them is the killing of tame
reindeer which are the property of others. The Russian Lapps are morally inferior to those of Scandinavia. They
have a bad reputation for lying and untrustworthiness, and they are very generally addicted to drunkenness. In Scandinavia the importation of intoxicants among the Lapps has been
restricted since 1723. Here too education has made some
advance, while the Russian Lapps are still quite illiterate.
The Lapps are even now largely nomads, many of their habits having probably changed but little since they first
tamed reindeer. Their manner of life is still in the patri
archal stage.
Religion. The great majority of the Lapps are nominally Christians, being Protestants in the Scandinavian countries
and members of the Grreek Church in Russian territory. Though the first attempts to Christianize them began in the
eleventh century, they openly worshipped their heathen idols till nearly the end of the seventeenth century in Swedish Lappmark, and secretly in Norway till some way on into the
eighteenth century. The practice of heathen rites survived into the nineteenth century, and is probably not yet extinct.
Lapp graves prepared in the old heathen manner have been found in Norway dating from as late as the years 1820-6.



WESTERN OE BALTIC FINNS 43
History, The very fragmentary information that we possess of the history of the Lapps is based on the evidence of language
and on the scanty references to them in the literature of the
peoples with whom they have come in contact. From the
geographical position which they have long occupied in
the extreme north-west of Europe, it is to be inferred that
the Lapps represent the first wave of the westward migration of the Turanian race in Europe. Linguistic evidence shows
that they were in touch with the Scandinavians in the first centuries of our era. In the early Middle Ages they began to
be discriminated from the Finns by the name of STcridefinnas
or 'run-Finns ',2^ the first word of the compound referring to
the snow-shoes (now sM) used by them. Procopius (1053-4)
calls them ^kplBl^lvol^ and Adam of Bremen (eleventh century)
places them, under the name of Scritifinni, on the boundary
of Sweden and Norway. In early times the territory of the
Lapps in the east extended much farther southward. In the fourteenth century they were still to be found on the shores of
Lake Onega. In the middle of the sixteenth century they were found in south-east Finland near Lake Saima, as far south as about 60 N. latitude. In Norway and Sweden they did
not come into the southern parts of their present habitat till after the Middle Ages.22

ii. The Eastern (Kama) Finns
Habitat. The eastern branch of the Finns, which consists of four main tribes with a population of over 2,000,000, is scattered over a wide territory in Eastern Russia, extending from about 65 to 53 N. and from about 42 to 55 E. In the south-west of this territory they border on the region (in the Governments of Vladimir and Tambov) which the Karelian branch of the
Western Finns appear to have occupied in bygone times.^"^



44 THE FINNO-UGRIAN DIVISION
Among the Eastern Finns the Permians constitute a closer
group based both on proximity of habitat (the region of the
Kama river) and on the intimate affinity of their languages.
a. The Permyaks The Permyaks form the first subdivision of this group. They may be treated as practically one tribe with the Zirians, because their dialects differ only very slightly, because both
call themselves by the same name, Komi-mort or ' Kama
people ', and because the two peoples only begin to be distinguished towards the end of the Middle Ages in the Russian Chronicles. In early times the Permyaks were almost as famous as the old Bulgarians. In the Scandinavian Sagas
their country was celebrated under the name of Byarmaland.
Their proper home was, and to a large extent still is, the river district of the Kama. Thus a Russian qhronicle of 1396 says :
' The Kama river surrounds the whole Permyak land, and on this river live many heathen ; it flows southward into the
Tatar land, and falls into the Volga sixty versts below Kazan.' 2* Trade and Trade Routes. In the Middle Ages the Permians
were great traders. They are stated in 1096 to have made
a trade route to Yugria over the Urals, along the Vogulka
river (a tributary of the Kama) and the Sosva (in Western Siberia). There was formerly a trade route from the Caspian along the Volga, Kama, Dvina, and Pechora to the Arctic Ocean. For this trade there were three emporia : Bolgari on the Volga, Cherdin on the Kolva (a tributary of the Kama),
and Cholmogor on the Dvina. To Bolgari wares came direct
from Persia, Bokhara, Armenia, Arabia, and, according to some,
even from India. A part of these wares then went north to
the Permians, who exchanged them for furs which they obtained from Siberia. The Permian tribes were long in
exclusive possession of this important trade. But the powerful mercantile republic of Novgorod, from about the beginning of the eleventh century, commenced attempts to subject Permia, owing to its value for their trade, and succeeded in doing so
by 1100. After the fall of Novgorod, the Permians came under
the dominion of the princes of Moscow. In 1472 Cherdin and
nearly the whole of the territory of Permia were conquered. But till the middle of the sixteenth century the Permians still
retained their own chiefs as vassals of the Czars.



EASTERN FINNS 45
Habitat, Number, S^c. The Permyaks live in the districts
of Perm and Cherdin in the Government of Perm. Their numbers in 1897 were about 50,000.'-^5 Their occupations are
hunting, fishing, and agriculture. Their language has been the subject of treatment by various Eussian scholars.^^
They belong to the Greek Orthodox Church. The first Christian missionary who worked among them (1375-96) was St. Stephen. Of all the surviving Finnish tribes the Permyaks are the
most Russianized, and they will probably before very long be absorbed in the Slav population. ^"^
b. The Zirians
Habitat. The important tribe of the Zirians ^^ is the most northerly of the Eastern Finns. They inhabit in the province
of Archangel more than half of the Pechora District (of which they formed 60 per cent, of the population in 1899), and in the Province of Vologda the whole of the Ust-Sisolsk District (on the Sisola), and two-thirds of the Yarensk District (on the
Vichegda). They are also found on the upper Kama, in the Governments of Vyatka and Perm. Their centre is the town of Ust-Ishma, at the junction of the Ishma and the Pechora. In former times they extended farther west than they do now.
On the east about 1,000 Zirians live on the Asiatic side of the Urals along the lower Ob.
They call themselves, from their old home, by the same name
as the Permyaks, Komi-mort or ' Kama-people'. Number, Their total numbers are about 208,000.2"^ Characteristics. The average height of men among the Zirians is 5 ft. 4 in.^^ They are robust in build. They are
bl(3nd and grey-eyed. They do not differ much in physique
from the ordinary Russian peasant of Archangel. The physi
cally best type is found about Ust-Ishma and Makheva.
Occupations. The Zirians are hospitable, vivacious, and of
easy morality. They are an energetic, enterprising, and shrewd people, given to trade and commerce, the trade across the Urals in Samoyed wares being largely in their hands.
They also practise reindeer breeding, in which they have been
engaged for a very long time. In 1896 they possessed in
the Pechora district about 225,000 head of reindeer,^^ single Zirians sometimes owning as many as 4,000 each. They



46 THE FINNO-UGEIAN DIVISION
further engage in hunting and agriculture to some extent. They often hire Samoyeds as labourers and herdsmen.
Manner of Life. Having been in constant touch with the Russians since the ninth century, the Zirians have adopted
much that is Russian in customs and dress. They are ceasing
to be nomadic, having assimilated the rural institutions of the
Russians. They often live in large villages, inhabiting log
houses much the same as those of the Russian peasants. Their food is chiefly meat, fish, and milk. They are fond of vodka,
but they also brew a sort of beer from barley malt.
Religion. The Zirians were converted to Christianity in the
fourteenth century by the missionary and later bishop of Perm,
St. Stephen. They are now devout adherents of the Orthodox
Greek Church. Nearly every village in their country has a well-built church.
Language. The language of the Zirians ^^ is closely allied to that of the Permyaks, the two tribes being mutually intelligible. It has borrowed many Russian words. There is also in the vocabulary a Samoyed element associated with reindeer; for the Zirians have derived from. the Samoyeds the art of breeding and herding those animals.
Among the Finno-Ugrians the Zirians, next to the Hun
garians, have the oldest, though only scanty, linguistic texts. They date from the second half of the fourteenth century,
consisting chiefly in a translation of the Gospels, probably the work of St. Stephen. These are partly written in Zirian characters which St. Stephen formed out of the Church Slav alphabet.^^ Otherwise the Zirians have no literature nor written memorials. *
c. The VotyaJcs Habitat. This tribe forms the third member of the Permian
group, being closely allied to the Zirians. Their territory lies to the south of that of the Zirians, for the most part along the river Vyatka and the upper Kama, chiefly in the south-eastern part of the Government of Vyatka. They are also found in
the Government of Ufa,^^ into which some of them migrated about the sixteenth century ; and this region being more
fertile is said to have improved their physique here. As
a rule the Votyaks are physically weak, and possess only moderate intelligence. They are an agricultural people.



EASTERN FINNS 47
but they are also noted as very industrious and skilled artisans. Number. Their total numbers are about 420,000.^*
Language. The language of the Votyaks, like that of their
kinsmen the Permyaks and the Zirians, has borrowed many
elements from the Chuvash, Tatar, and Eussian. Religion. The Votyaks may have been Christianized about
the same time as the Permians and Zirians, but there is no
trustworthy information on this subject. They are now, like the other divisions of this group, adherents of the Orthodox
Greek Church. When Castr^n wrote (1851),^'^ there were,
however, still some pagans in the population. In any case, Shamanistic practices still survive among them.^^
In the Middle Ages the Votyaks became subject to the republic of Chlinow, which was founded in 1174 by colonists
from Novgorod, on the river Vyatka. This republic lasted till
1459, when it was overthrown by a Prince of Moscow. After
the fall of Chlinow and Novgorod, the Votyaks came under the dominion of Moscow. They are said to have retained
a kind of independence till 1589, when they voluntarily became subject to the Russian Czar Feodor Ivanovich.^"^
According to their own traditions, the tribal chiefs of the
Votyaks formerly dwelt on the Kazanka, in the neighbourhood
of Arskoi Prigorod, where they had a fortress, but whence they were later driven by the Tatars into their present
territory.^^
d. The Volga Group
The Volga (or Bulgarian) group of the Eastern Finns
inhabit the regions of the middle Volga, and consist of three main tribes. They have borrowed more Tatar elements, while
the Permian group have come more under the influence of the
Slavs. This contrast is reflected in the outward appearance of the two peoples. The Volga Finns are no longer nomads, having adopted the settled life of the surrounding Slavs. In
early times the Bulgars are described by the Teutonic writer
Jordanes as having their seat above the Pontus. The Arab
writer Ibn Fozlan describes them as living on the middle
Volga near its confluence with the Kama. He, in a.d. 921,
visited their capital, which was on the left bank of the Volga
(situated c. 54 54' N. lat.), and gives some information about



48 THE FINNO-UGEIAN DIVISION
it. Islam was adopted there in the following year. Some five
centuries before a section of the Bulgars had left the main
body, crossed the Danube, and penetrated into Moesia."'-^
Here they became so merged in the Slavs with whom they
came in contact that they lost not only their racial type,^^ but their language. Thus it has come about that their origin is indicated almost solely by the name of the modern state of
Bulgaria.*^ 1. The Mordvins. Habitat. This tribe lives in the region of the middle Volga in the Grovernments of Samara, Simbirsk, and Penza. ^^ There are two sub-tribes, the Mokshans in the
east, living chiefly on the Sura and Moksha rivers, and the Ersans in the west, on the Oka. They are found scattered over the Governments of Vyatka, Kazan, Nizhni Novgorod,
Penza, Saratov, Tambov, and Simbirsk.*^ Names and Mode of Life. These two subdivisions are already
mentioned by Rubruquis ** under the name of Moxel and
Merdas or Merduas. Herberstein,*^ who knows them only
under the name of Mordwa, says they were good bowmen, but differed from the Cheremisses in having stationary dwellings.
Owing to the fertility of their land, they had early given up their nomadic life and taken to agriculture and cattlebreeding. Though they were once a very warlike and cruel
people, they are now peaceful and industrious agriculturists and bee-keepers. Of their old customs they have retained little
or nothing. Religion. Pallas found some heathen among them, but they
are said to have adopted Christianity, which has been preached
to them since the time of the Empress Anne (1730-40).
Number. The total number of the Mordvins is over
1,000,000,* and is even given as high as 1,860,000.^7
Dialects. There are two Mordvin dialects, which show many borrowings from Chuvash, Tatar, and Russian.
History. Jordanes, who first mentions this people under the name of Mordens, seems to have counted them as belonging to the dominion of the Gothic leader Hermanarik. It is uncertain to what extent they were later subject to the
Bulgarian kingdom. Nestor (eleventh century) speaks of them as Finnish, and they are mentioned by many mediaeval
authors, who however give little information about them. In 1104 they repulsed the attack of a Muscovite prince named



EASTEEN FINNS 49
Jaroslav Svyatoslavich.^^ rpj^^ attacks were repeated by his
successors, who succeeded in making some sections of the
Mordvins tributary. But soon after came the Mongol invasion,
which subjected both Russians and Mordvins. When Mongol
rule in Russia terminated, the Mordvins, in alliance with
Tatars and their kinsmen the Cheremisses, again engaged in
conflicts with the Russians. Ultimately, when the dominion
of Russia on the Volga was consolidated, the Mordvins became subject to that power. 2. The Cheremisses. Habitat. This tribe inhabits the banks of the Volga, chiefly the western or 'meadow' bank, for the
most part in the neighbourhood of Kazan. The few who live
on the mountainous side are called ' Hill Cheremisses ' and are
physically stronger. They also extend to the north of Kazan,
along the Kama and the Vyatka rivers, occupying the southern
parts of the Governments of Perm and Vyatka. They are
further to be met with in the Governments of Kostroma,
Nizhni Novgorod, Ufa, and Orenburg.
Number. Their number, which seems to have increased
considerably during the last century, is now about 375,000.'*^
Name. The name 'Cheremiss' is said to have been given
them by the Mordvins and to mean ' Easterners '. They call
themselves Mara ' men '.^^
Language. The language, in which two dialects, the
Western and Eastern, are to be distinguished, has been
strongly influenced by Chuvash, Tatar, and Russian.^^
Manner of Life. The Cheremisses have given up nomad
life, and are now active agriculturists. They live together in villages consisting of only a few houses, at the most twenty to thirty.
Religion. Though long subject to Tatar rule, they did not
adopt Islam, but retained their own Shamanistic cult, which has even now not disappeared. Christianity, which was introduced among them in the middle of the eighteenth century, is
only nominal, the population generally being still heathen.^^ History. In history the Cheremisses are first mentioned by
Jordanes (who calls them Svemniscans) as among the peoples
whom Hermanarik, King of the Goths, subjected about
A.D. 350. In Russian history their name first occurs in Nestor (eleventh century), but the information which he and the
Russian Chronicles supply about them is very scanty. The
TURANIANS



50 THE FINNO-UGEIAN DIVISION
oldest accounts represent them as living in the centre of
the Bulgarian state ; hence they probably formed a part of that great and famous kingdom. After the destruction of that power by the Mongols, the Cheremisses became subject to the
Tatar Khans, whose seat was at Kazan. From that time onwards they are often referred to in Eussian history. They
always made common cause with the Tatars, and fought obstinately against the Russians ; and even after the fall of
the Khanate of Kazan they maintained their hostility. At
that time they were a very wild, cruel, and rapacious people.
They used to wander about as nomads in the forest region
between the Volga and the Vyatka. According to their own
traditions, the Cheremisses formerly lived under their own
tribal chiefs, and their manner of life was much the same as
that of the Ugrian peoples.^^ 3. The ChuvasJies. Habitat. This tribe consists of -a mixture of the Cheremiss branch of the Volga Finns with Tatars.^* They live on the right bank of the Volga and on the Sura,
in the Governments of Kazan, Simbirsk, Samara, and in lesser
numbers in Saratov, Ufa, and Orenburg. Number. Their numbers in 1897 were 843,755.'^^ Characteristics. Physically the Chuvashes resemble the
.Finns, being round-headed, flat-featured, and light-eyed, but their type has been affected by long association with the Tatar element. In dress they have been thoroughly Russian
ized. They are described as industrious, moral, and very cleanly in their habits.
Occupations. They are agriculturists, cattle-breeders, and bee-keepers, as well as fishers and hunters.
Religion. Since the middle of the eighteenth century >they have been Christians for the most part, but they hold the
heathen magic priest in high regard, and cling to many of their old Shamanistic practices.

B. The Ugrians The Ugrian group consists of three branches. Two of
these, the Ostyaks and the Voguls, living as neighbours,

chiefly on the Asiatic side of the Urals, are more closely associated as Ob-Ugrians, and are few in number. The third, which has been separated from the other two for more than
1,000 years, is by far the most important, occupying a wide
territory with a large population. These are the Hungarians.
Name. This group is called Ugrian from the name of the
extensive region on both sides of the lower Ob and Irtish which is bounded by the habitat of the Samoyeds in the north,
of the Tatars in the south, b}^ the Urals in the west, and by
the rivers Nadim, Agan, and Vach in the east. Within these limits are found the Ostyaks and the Voguls, who in Eussian
chronicles and other old documents bear the common name
of Ugrians. South of these, in prehistoric times, lived various
kindred tribes, among whom the most powerful were the Unogurs, later called Ugurs, Uigurs, and Ungars^^ (the modern Hungarians). Migrations. This latter tribe migrated westward by various stages, till they finally settled in the basin of the middle
Danube, which they occupy at the present day. It is im
possible to say when the Ugrian group left their original
home in the Asiatic Highlands, but they had probably reached the region of the Ural mountains in the early centuries of
our era. History. In the eleventh century the Ugrians are often mentioned as on the banks of the Volga. But the first trust
worthy account of the present Ugrians is derived from Nestor,
who for the year 1096 notes that they were southern neighbours of the Pechorians and Samoyeds. In 1187 the Ugrians were tributary to Novgorod, and in a chronicle of the year 1264 Yugra is mentioned as one of the districts of Novgorod.
In the time of Jenghiz Khan's successors Yugria seems to have sufiered from the devastations of the Mongols, as related
by Piano Carpini, who in 1246 journeyed through Russia as
Papal Envoy to the Mongol Grand Khan. He tells of an
expedition made in 1242 by a part of Batu Khan's hordes
through the country of the Mordvins, Bulgars, and Bashkirs
against the Samoyeds and others as far as the Arctic coast.
In 1499 Ivan Vassilyevich sent his armies into Yugria and made it a Russian province.'^' In 1571 the Tatars again
endeavoured to found a new kingdom, but it was short-lived,
for in 1580 the famous Russian Cossack Yermak appeared on d2

the scene, expelled the Tatar Khan, and conquered Yugria as
well as the whole of Western Siberia.^^
a. The Ugrian Ostyaks
Habitat This tribe lives along the Ob, the Irtish, and its
tributaries the Konda and the Vasyugan, in the Tobolsk and
the Tomsk Governments. There are three groups of Ostyaks : the northern Ostyaks in the northern Berezovsk District ; the eastern, south of
Surgut and along the Vasyugan as far as its tributary the Chayanka and south-east of that river about as far as the
latitude of Tomsk ; and the south-western or Irtish Ostyaks in the northern part of the Tobolsk District, along the Ob, the
Irtish, and the Konda. At the present day the territory of the Ostyaks is almost entirely restricted to Asia, but about a thousand years ago their lands still stretched into Eastern Europe, whence they were for the most part driven back over the Urals by the Russians. In the central provinces of Russia
numerous place and river names of Ugrian origin still survive.
Here the Ostyaks have almost entirely disappeared, having, where not expelled by the Russians, become merged in the neighbouring Zirian, Vogul, and Samoyed tribes ; it is only
in West Siberia that they remain comparatively intact.
Name, The name Ostyak has no linguistic affinity with any of the languages of the three people so called. The
Ugrian Ostyaks are known simply as Ostyaks or as Ugra,
Yugra. The most probable derivation of ' Ostyak ' is from the Tatar word Oushtak, ' barbarian ', by which the Tatars called
all the tribes of the middle Yenisei and the Ob, when they reached the Yenisei valley in the thirteenth century. In the old Novgorod annals of the eleventh century, the Ostyaks are
known by the name of Ugra. The old term Ugra or Yogra is still used by the Zirians for their neighbours the Ostyaks of the Urals. The Samoyeds call the Ostyaks Yara7i or Yargai (from Ya7'a '
stranger '). The general name by which the Ostyaks (as well as the Voguls) call themselves is Mans. Number. The number of the Ugrian Ostyaks is given in Asiatic Russia (for 1911) as 18,591.^^ They seem to be de
creasing, as infant mortality is high among them and they
suifer much from famine.
Characteristics. The average height of the Ugrian Ostyaks



THE UGEIANS 53
IS 5 ffc. 3-4 in. They are long-headed and have round flat
faces, broad and rather flat noses, prominent cheek-bones, dark
narrow eyes, and yellow or yellow-gre}^ complexions. Their
hair is long, smooth, and mostly black. Their beards are scanty. Owing to admixture with Russian blood, the Turanian type is, however, less marked among them, though they live
almost entirely in Asia, than among the Mordvins, who live in
Europe. In character they are timid, good-natured, obliging,
simple, and superstitious. They are also honest where they
have not been affected by civilization.
Mode of Life. The Ugrian Ostyaks are still nomads. In the south-west, where they have been most influenced by
Russian colonization, they have in some places given up their wandering life, though even here they remain seasonal
nomads, living in their wooden huts for the fishing season, and often for the hunting season as well. In the northern and eastern districts they are wanderers. In winter they live in tents made of reindeer-skin and sometimes in half-underground log-huts covered with snow. In
summer they live in tents made of birch-bark. During their
migrations reindeer are used for drawing their wooden sledges.
Their winter dress is made chiefly of reindeer-skin, while their summer clothing consists of fish-skin, or is woven by
women from the nettle plant. The dress of the Ostyaks in -the Obdorsk region is practically the same as that of the
Samoyeds, except that they have adopted the veiling of women from the adjacent Tatars.
Their food consists chiefly in fish (eaten raw in summer and frozen in winter) and the flesh of reindeer, the entrails of which are eaten raw, while the rest is usually cooked. They also frequently gather cranberries and cedar nuts. They are fond
of drinking vodka.
Occupations, Their occupations are hunting, fishing, and
reindeer breeding. They hunt, chiefly in winter, elk and reindeer, on snow-shoes with the aid of dogs, using oldfashioned flintlocks. In remoter districts they also employed bows and arrows recently. In winter they also fish through
the ice. Very few of them engage in agriculture.
The Ostyaks are skilled in handicraft such as wood and
bone carving, fine embroidery on linen, and the manufacture
of ornaments with beads. They make musical instruments.



54 THE FINNO-UGEIAN DIVISION
shaped either like a boat with five reindeer-sinew strings,
called the domhra (which they consider to be their original
instrument), or like a swan with nine metal strings. On these
instruments they play their own original music.
Language. The Ostyak language has three or four dialects, the purest of which is said to be that which is spoken at
Surgut. The dialect employed round Berezov is so different from that round Obdorsk that the two are mutually unintelli
gible. The Ostyaks have no written records, but possess an oral tradition of legends and a national war epic called
Tarnin-a7'a, ' the song of Tarn '
(an evil anthropomorphic
power). As ifc makes no reference to the conflicts of the
Ostyaks with the Tatars who subdued them in the sixteenth
century, we may infer that it originated at a period anterior to
those conflicts.
Clans. Like the Samoyeds, the Ostyaks are split up into a number of small clans under patriarchal institutions, each with an elder at its head. The clan consists of a number of families of common descent who consider themselves related,
and is consequently exogamous. The clan migrates as a body on nomadic expeditions.
Neighbouring clans are combined under a common chief,
who is accounted a prince and whose main duty is to pre
serve harmony among them. This status was recognized b}^ Katharine II (1762-96), and has been continued by the Russian
Government down to the present day. The chiefship and the
eldership are hereditary dignities. The national epic of the
Ostyaks shows that at the time when it was composed they
were already organized as a confederacy consisting of many
small settlements, each with its own elder and all under
a supreme chief (called z/or, ur, or urt).
Civilization. The civilization of the Ostyaks is still very
primitive. They understand counting by tens, but they have
no knowledge of figures. Among them, as among the Samo
yeds and other related races, marriage is concluded by the
father or nearest male relative of the bride, for whom a price
(kalim) is paid by the bridegroom. The woman has no say in the matter. She is strictly a servant, is considered unclean,
and lives a life of degradation. Polygamy is allowed, but is rare nowadays because of the high price that has to be paid
for the bride. The dead are interred in forests. No graves



THE UGRIANS 55
are dug, but the body is laid on the ground and covered with
skins. In the north the old custom of burying the dead in
a canoe is still practised. All the belongings of the deceased
are placed in his grave because of the very widely diffused belief that the departed continue to have the same wants and occupations as when alive. Both at his funeral and for some years afterwards his relatives offer reindeer on his tomb.
Religion. Many of the Ostyaks have since 1715 belonged officially to the Kussian orthodox Church, but such adherence has not to any great extent influenced their Shamanistic beliefs
and practices. In the Berezov and Taz districts they are even
officially still classed as pagan.
There are three great gods common to all the Ostyaks. One
of them is ' the old man from the mouth of the Ob', the god of
all fish. The first catch of fish is offered to him every season, and many sacrifices of animals are offered and various objects
are deposited where he is thought to live. He is always repre
sented with a bow and arrows and a shield. The second is the
goose god, the protector of all birds (i.e. that frequent the
river Ob). The third is the god of the Konda, of whom we
know very little. The principal destructive deity is Tarn,
god of war, sickness, bad weather and everything injurious to life, generally regarded as a female. The great gods are usually represented by anthropomorphic idols, which the Ostyaks seldom keep in their tents, but
usually in the open air on a distant wooded height. Near
these sanctuaries there is usually a Shaman, who looks after
the image of the god. Besides the great gods every Ostyak has a lesser family
deity, the image of whom he keeps in his tent. These private gods are accounted tutelary deities. They accompany the Ostyak on all his wanderings and are kept in a separate sledge. Sacrifices consist in besmearing the lips of the idols with fish oil or blood, and placing a vessel with fish oil or flesh before them as nourishment. Sacrifice is regarded as a gift for service to be done, or as a reward for service already done.
Mystical properties are possessed by the swan and the goose
among birds, and especially by the bear among animals. When
a bear has been killed his body is placed on the ground, while the people dance round it and apologize for killing it, throwing



56 THE FINNO-UGRIAN DIVISION
the blame on the Eussians for having supplied them with iron arrow-heads.
The Shaman, who is not necessarily hereditary, chooses his successor, male or female. His costume is very similar to that
of the Samoyed Shaman, being made of reindeer hide, with
many metallic jingles. The magic drum of the Ostyak Shaman
differs from the type used by the other natives along the Yenisei in being round instead of oval. It is an absolutely
necessary implement to the Shaman, who is in every respect an interpreter of the gods. Conversation with a god can only
be carried on by him and only by means of song and beat of
drum. This ceremony is always accompanied by a sacrifice
consisting of one or more reindeer. Now that the southwestern and many of the northern Ostyaks are nominal Chris
tians, the marriage ceremonies among them are a combination
of Christian and Shamanist rites. The oath with the Ostyaks as with the Samoyed s is an act
of the highest religious importance, and that which is taken on a bear's snout is the most sacred. History. The Ostyaks have no historical records of their own, though from their legends and their national epic some
inferences of an historical nature may be extracted. What we
know of their history is derived from Russian chronicles.
From the Novgorod annals we know that they were called
Ugra in the eleventh century, when they had fights with the Novgorodians. In 1398 they are mentioned as distinct from but related to the Voguls. These two tribes are again men
tioned in 1483, when a Moscow military expedition conquered
their lands. When the Ostyaks were driven from their
European settlements by the Russians, it is probable that they concentrated in Western Siberia, where they fought with the Samoyeds for supremacy in the region between the Urals and the Ob. These fights are vividly described in the old war epic of the Ostyaks. As a result of the conflict some of the Ostyaks were merged in the Samoyed tribes, but the bulk of the Ostyak nation still exists in the same region as they have occupied for many centuries. About 1500 the Tatars subdued
the whole valley of the Irtish. In 1581 the Ostyaks succumbed to the Russians, and in 1586 the first Cossack settlement was built at the mouth of the Irtish. It was, however,
only after a long and hard struggle, and not till forty-one



THE UGEIANS 57
Ostyak villages had been destroyed that the Eussians entirely
subdued them. Later, the Ostyaks helped the Eussians in
conquering other native tribes. At the time of the Eussian conquest the Ostyak territory extended much farther than it does now. Eemains of their forts destroyed by the Cossacks in the sixteenth century are found in several parts of the country, many near Obdorsk. In 1897 some South Ostyak
villages still spoke a Tatar language, and Mohammedan customs, such as abstention from pork and the veiling of
women, prevailed. But Eussian influence has revived among
the Ostyaks and has been making great progress among them,
chiefly in consequence of Eussian women marrying Ostyak
men. Hence many Ostyak villages in the Irtish region
speak only Eussian, and young men will not learn Ostyak,
though the old men still speak it. The Eussification of the Ob Ostyaks has also been extended by trade.
In the case of the Ostyaks we have an example of the partial mixture of three branches of the Turanians Ugrian, Samoyed, and Tatar besides intermarriage to some extent with the non-Turanian Eussian.

b. The Voguls Habitat. This tribe lives on both sides of the Urals, but the bulk of them are found between the Urals and the Irtish and the Ob. Formerly they extended farther to the west and the
south. Most of them are settled in the Government of Tobolsk, including the territory' of the Konda, but they also extend
eastwards to near the Irtish, Tavda, and Tara ; westwards beyond the frontier of the Government of Perm (between the head waters of the Pechora and the Urals) ; in the north to the Sosva ; and in the south to the Lozva.
They are closely allied to the Ugrian Ostyaks, to whom and
themselves they apply the common name of Mansi (from the
river Man, the scene of the Vogul deluge), as being one people.
The Zirians call both by the common name of Yograyas.
Number. Their numbers are about 7,000,^^ of whom about
2,000 are in Europe. Their population seems to be decreasing,
partly in consequence of admixture with the Eussians.
Characteristics. They differ little from the Ostyaks in



58 THE FINNO-UGRIAN DIVISION
physique. They are below middle height. The face is round
and flat, the cheek-bones prominent, the nose broad though
not flat, the hair long and black, the. beard weak, the complexion dark. The features are not markedly Turanian. The Voguls are said to be the least sociable of the Siberian tribes.
Mode of Life. Like the Ostyaks they are mostly hunters and fishers. They breed reindeer, but have few horses. Those in the southern districts practise agriculture to some extent.
They are half nomads, spending the winter, like the Lapps, in
wretched huts, but in summer and autumn wandering about,
occupied chiefly with hunting, especially the sable. They trade with the Samoyeds, Ostyaks, and Russians, principally in furs. Their food consists chiefly of fish or the flesh of reindeer.
They usually wear Russian dress. They also weave garments of nettles, or at least did so in recent times.
Language. In their language, which is closely allied to Ostyak, two dialects may be distinguished the northern, spoken on the upper Lozva, the northern Sosva with its tribu
taries, and the Ob ; and the southern, spoken on the lower
Lozva, the Pelinka, Vuglak, Konda, and Tavda.
Burial. When a Vogul dies his body is not taken out
through the door, but through the window or a specially made
hole. The graveyard is usually in a forest. The body is conveyed there by reindeer and laid in a boat or boatlike
coffin. The burial is accompanied by a funeral feast.
Religion. Though the Voguls have been mostly nominal Christians for a century, they are still largely devoted to their old Shamanistic religion.

c. Hungarians or Magyars
Habitat The Magyars are by far the largest and most
important branch of the Ugrian group. They are the dominant race in the Kingdom of Hungary. They constitute nearly
50 per cent, of its population, and are much the most numerous



THE MAGYARS 59
and compact of its many racial elements. The country in
habited by them is a remarkable geographical unit defined on all sides by the natural boundaries of mountains (chiefly the
Carpathians in the north-west, north, east, and south-east) and rivers (the Danube, Save, and Unna), and forming the basin of the Middle Danube. Most of the Magyars inhabit the major
portions of two extensive plains, one of which lies to the west and south-west of Budapest and has an area of about 6,000 square miles, while the other, which lies between the Danube and Transylvania and is much larger, has an area of about 37,000 square miles. In the former is scattered a considerable
German population. In the latter, however, the Magyars form a solid racial block with hardly any alien elements inter
spersed. The plain, which is traversed by the Theiss (Tisza)
and its many tributaries, extends over the greater portion of
Central and Southern Hungary. Though in some parts covered with barren wastes of sand
alternating with marshes, the plains in general present a very rich and productive soil, and form the most fertile part of the
kingdom. They were occupied by the Hungarians a thousand
years ago, as a territory congenial to their then nomadic habits. There is on the extreme east a compact isolated body
of Magyars surrounded on all sides by the Rumanians of Transylvania and of Rumania. It embraces the three Szekel
counties of Transylvania. Name. The Hungarians call themselves Magyars or ' sons
of the earth ', and their country Magyarorszdg, ' land of the
Magyars', in Turkish Magyaristan,^^ country of the Magyars'.
But the general European name given them and their country
(Latin Hungaria, French Hongrie, English Hungary, German
Ungarn) is derived from Ugria, the old designation of the Ugrian territory on the Urals (see pp. 24, 51). It is preferable
to use Magyar as an ethnological term, because ' Hungarian '
may be used in the political sense of ' inhabitant of Hungary ',
a territory which in addition to the Magyars contains at least
seven other ethnic groups Serbians, Croats, Slovaks, Ruthe
nians, Rumanians, Slovenes, and Germans (besides Jews and
Gipsies).
Number. The Magyar population in 1916 was 10,050,000
out of a total of 20,886,487, or slightly under one-half.^ The remaining population of Hungary consists mainly of six



60 THE FINNO-UGEIAN DIVISION
other races distributed either in compact ethnic groups or in colonies surrounded by other nationalities. These are :
Eumanians, 2,949,000 ; Germans, 2,037,000 ; Slovaks, 1,968,000 ; Croats, 1,833,000 ; Serbs, . 1,006,000 ; Euthenians, 473,000.=^
Thus in round numbers the Slavs contribute five and a half, the Eumanians three, and the Germans two millions to the
population of Hungary. Emigration. Emigration has been a very serious drain on the population of Hungary, which in the period between 1896
and 1910 lost more than one million of its inhabitants in this
way. Of upwards of 150,000 Hungarians who emigrated in
1906 more than one- third were Magyars. The cause of this
great outflow before the War was partly the grinding poverty
of the mass of the peasantry, and partly the resentment of the subordinate races against the Magyarization to which they
have long been subjected by the Government. The flow of
emigration, being chiefly to the United States, has had considerable effect on the political situation in Hungary, because
a proportion of the emigrants return ^* with much wealth and Americanized ideas.^^ There is also an annual emigration from the Transylvanian counties to Eumania and the Balkan territories of 4,000 to 5,000 persons. There has been a steady
migration from Hungary proper of peasants and workmen into Croatia-Slavonia, where they become rapidly merged in
the Croat population. Racial Problem. The position of the Magyars in the centre
of Hungary presents a racial problem of grave significance. They are here surrounded by a fringe of other nationalities
which mainly occupy the circumference of the kingdom in large, compact, and uniform ethnic groups. Each of these groups is in direct touch with a kindred people living across the border of Hungary ; in the east the Eumanians in Tran
sylvania and the Banat with those in Eumania and Bukovina ; in the south the Serbs and the Croats with those on flfc other bank of the Danube, the Save, and the Unna ; in the ^est the
Germans with those in Lower Austria and Styria ; in the north the Slovaks with those in Moravia ; and lastly the Euthenes with those of Galicia who occupy the opposite slopes of the
Carpathians. The disruptive tendencies within the Kingdom
of Hungary, caused by differences of nationality and the
repression exercised on the subject races by the Magyars, are
w^



THE MAGYAES 61
strengthened by the attraction of the contiguous kindred races beyond the frontiers.
Supposing at the end of the War it were proposed to form
new states by the union of these alien races with their extraneous kinsmen, it is not likely that the Magyars, accustomed to a tradition of domination extending over a thousand years,
would yield without strenuous resistance. As a result of such a dismemberment the Kingdom of Hungary would shrink to
a territory of some 40,000 square miles with boundaries hard to defend and a population, even if the isolated German colonies
were included, of not more than 10,000,000.
Characteristics. When the Hungarians arrived in their present habitat they formed an amalgam of two Turanian
elements Ugrian and Turkish. ^^ Owing to their admixture
with the Slavs or semi-Slavs already in possession of the
country and with the very numerous foreign immigrants who from time to time settled in Hungary, the Magyars have lost
their once distinctively Turanian type. They may be de
scribed as being, at the present day, of medium height, muscular, well-built, with sharply cut features, dark fiery
eyes, black hair^ and the darker complexion which prevails in south European countries. They are vivacious, excitable,
and fiery in temperament ; intelligent, good-natured, and
hospitable. They have the gift of oratory, and are intensely
patriotic. They are skilled riders and make very brave
soldiers. They are fond of music and dancing. They have
a characteristic national dance, called Csardas, in which slow and very rapid movements alternate.
Occupations. When the Magyars entered the plains of Hungary they were nomads, but they early gave up this
mode of life and adopted the settled civilization of Europe.
Their main occupations are agriculture and cattle-breeding.
Hungary is a pre-eminently agricultural country and one of
the principal wheat-growing regions of Europe. In 1900 nearly 69 per cent, of the total population derived their main
tenance from agriculture and cognate pursuits. Arable land forms nearly 43 per cent, of the total area of the country and is being constantly added to by the reclamation of the marshes,
but especially by the transformation of waste prairie land.
Agriculture has also made some progress by improvements in
method, by the use of the most modern implements, and by



62 THE FINNO-UGRIAN DIVISION
the application of scientific discoveries. Owing to its wide
expanses of meadow and pasture land, which embraces 23 per
cent, of the area of the country, Hungary is exceptionally well adapted for cattle-raising. In 1895 the numbers of the
live stock, in round figures, in Hungary proper were : pigs 6^,
sheep 7i, cattle 6, and horses 2 millions. The breed of Hungarian horses has been improved by government action in
establishing state studs and importing foreign, especially English, stock. Forests cover 26-60 per cent, of the land of Hungary, mostly in the mountainous tracts of the Carpathians.
Hence forestry gives occupation to large numbers of the population in those parts.
IndusU^y. Native industry has been greatly developed by
the state since 1867. The principal industry is flour-milling;
the number of steam mills in 1905 was 1,845. Brewing and
distilling have been greatly developed. The sugar industry
has made great strides, the amount of beetroot used having increased tenfold between 1880 and 1905. Other principal industries are : the manufacture of agricultural machinery
and implements, leather, glass, and earthenware, cotton and woollen goods, chemicals, tobacco (a government monopoly), iron foundries, petroleum refineries, and paper mills. In 1900
2,605,000 persons, or 13J per cent, of the total population, were dependent on industries for their livelihood in the Kingdom
of Hungary. ^ Commerce. Hungary forms with Austria a single customs and commercial territory. In 1907 the imports amounted to
66,000,000 and the exports to 64,700,000; of the former 75 to 80 per cent, came from Austria, and of the latter 75 per
cent, went to Austria. The imports were chiefly cotton,
woollen, silk and leather goods, clothes, haberdashery, and linen. The exports, consisting of flour, wheat, maize, barley, wine in barrels, beef, cattle, pigs, horses, clearly indicate the
predominantly agricultural character of the country. Government. Hungary is a constitutional monarchy under
an hereditary king, who is at the same time Emperor of Austria. Beyond this personal union the two states are independent
of one another, each having its own constitution, legislature, and administration. The constitution is superficially
analogous to that of Great Britain, especially in being based on no written document, but on immemorial prescription,



THE MAGYARS 63
coiijfirmed or modified from time to time by a series of enact
ments. The earliest and most famous of these was the Golden Bull of Andrew III, the Magna Carta of Hungary, which
dates from 1222, only seven years later than the English
Magna Carta of King John. The ancient constitution was
reformed under the influence of "Western liberalism in 1848. It secured the supremacy of the Magyar race by a franchise
so narrow that it wholly excludes the representation of the working classes in Parliament. Suspended after the collapse of the Hungarian revolt in 1849, the constitution was restored in 1867 under the terms of the Compromise (Ausgleich) with
Austria. The legislative power is vested in Parliament, which consists of two houses the Upper, or House of Magnates, and the Lower, or House of Representatives (who are elected for five years and are paid). The official language here is Magyar,
but delegates of Croatia-Slavonia may speak in their own
tongue. The executive power is vested in a responsible cabinet of ten ministers.
Religion. Most of the Hungarians, 49 per cent., are Roman Catholics (Magyars, Slovaks, Germans, and Croats) ; 14 per cent, are Calvinists (Magyars) ; 13 per cent, adhere to the Orthodox Greek Church (Serbs and Rumanians) ; 11 per cent, are Uniates
(Rumanians and Ruthenians) ; 7 per cent, are Lutherans (Slovaks and Germans) ; 5 per cent, are Jews.^^ Perfect
equality is accorded to all religions and creeds.
Language. The Hungarian or Magyar language is akin to
those of the four other divisions of the Turanian family of
speech the Samoyed, the Tungus, the Mongolian, and the Turkish. There are two groups of words that afford evident
proofs of this linguistic kinship the names of parts of the body, and the numerals. Another evidence of relationship is
the fact that in these languages a word regularly begins with one vowel or one single consonant, but never with a group of
consonants, as is often the case in the Indo-European languages. The specifically Turanian feature of vowel harmony is more
consistently followed in the Hungarian, Finnish, and Turkish
languages than in any of the others. It is also to be noticed
that the main accent in Hungarian, Balto-Finnic, Lappish, and Vogul is always on the first syllable. There is in particular
very extensive evidence of kinship between Finno-Ugrian and
Turkish in the use of possessive personal endings.^^ Thus,



64 THE FINNO-UGEIAN DIVISION
although the Magyars have for a thousand years been established
in Europe, and subjected to Aryan influences, their language has nevertheless retained its essential Turanian features. Literature. The Latin alphabet was introduced among the Magyars in the eleventh century by Christian teachers from
Venice, and their earliest literary productions appeared in the
twelfth century. But it was not till the dawn of the Reformation that the Hungarians began to substitute their own
language for Latin as a literary vehicle, a native Magyar
literature commencing to develop between the years 1437 and
1530. From this period dates the text of the oath taken by
John Hunyadi when he was elected governor of Hungary
(1446), and the translation of the four gospels completed in
1466. To the next period (1530-1606) belong several Magyar translations of the scriptures. During the seventeenth and
the greater part of the eighteenth centuries the progress of the national literature was checked by the Germanizing influences
at work under the Hapsburg dynasty. The end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth saw the regeneration of the native literature and the revival of the native language. The establishment of the Hungarian Academy
in 1830 marks the beginning of an epoch in which gigantic
efforts were made to raise the intellectual life of the nation by
the cultivation of the native language and literature. Not only has there been since then a great advance and increase in the production of works of pure literature and of learned and scientific books of all descriptions, but also of periodical literature. Thus in 1830 there appeared only ten Magyar
periodical publications, but in 1895 there were 806.^^
History. The migrations of the Magyars, before they appeared on the stage of history a thousand years ago, are
obscure. Early settled on the Urals, they moved westward
under the pressure of other tribes. They first migrated to the
Volga, where they formed part of the kingdom of the Bulgars. After the overthrow of the latter and of their successors the
Khazars, the Magyars settled in the territory now called Bessarabia, Bukovina, and Moldavia. Driven hence by the
Allied Bulgars and Pechenegs, their seven independent tribes
combined under the leadership of a single chief named Arpad, and crossed in the district of the Verecze Pass, into the region of the Upper Theiss in .895. Here they must have felt at



THE MAGYARS 65
home, for many parts of these low-lying lands resemble the
steppe regions of Central Asia."^^ The country now called
Hungary was at that time for the most part occupied by an
Aryan population, chiefly Slavs or semi- Slavs. The Magyars
first overthrew the kingdom of Moravia (founded c. 850) ; the Bulgars, Serbs, Croats, and Avars, in the southern parts,
were next subdued, and Arpad completed the conquest of
the whole country by 906. This forcible intrusion of a non
Aryan race altered the whole history of Europe. A striking
result was the dislocation of the great Slav people by separating
the northern from the southern, and the eastern from the western branches. One of the consequences of this rupture
was the Teutonization of the western Slavs, who no longer
able to stand alone, and cut off from both Eome and Con
stantinople, were compelled to take Christianity and civilization along with it from Germany.
The arrival of the Magyars in Hungary was soon followed by
a period, extending over more than half a century, of devastating
raids which made their savage horsemen the terror and scourge
of Europe. They ravaged Thuringia, Bavaria, and Swabia ; Lotharingia and Burgundy; penetrated into Italy as far as
Otranto ; and invaded the Eastern Empire, being bought off only under the very walls of Constantinople. This state of things was put an end to by the overwhelming defeat which the Magyars suffered on the Lech in 955 while they were
besieging Augsburg. Stephen I, one of the great constructive statesmen of history, was the real founder of the Magyar dominion by establishing
firmly the Hungarian State and the Hungarian Church.
Though his predecessor had been baptized, Stephen was the
first Hungarian ruler under whom Christianity was introduced
among the people. He also set about civilizing the country
with the aid of foreign monks, who instructed the Magyars in
agriculture, arts, and handicrafts. The monks were followed
by foreign husbandmen, artificers, and handicraftsmen who, encouraged by reports of abundant land, settled in the country.
Immigration was further stimulated by the bad harvests and
the epidemics that prevailed in Europe from 987-1060. By
the end of Stephen's reign Hungary came to be regarded as
a promised land in which peoples of all religions and nationali
ties dwelt together in security. TURANIANS

Stephen broke up the tribal system "^^ and encouraged the private ownership of the soil, making grants of land for military service, not however on the basis of feudalism, but on
that of the organization of the Frankish Empire. He borrowed
the county system, which even now plays a prominent part in
Hungarian national life. He divided Central and Western
Hungary into a number of counties to be ruled by counts or
lord-lieutenants nominated by the king and liable to military
service. But Stephen made no attempt to weld into a united nation the various races combined under his crown. NonMagyars were governed by the lord-lieutenants as subject
races forming the mass of the peasants who down to 1848 bore nearly the entire burden of taxation.
Hungarian life was still simple and primitive : the king's
property chiefly consisted of flocks and herds, or the products of the labour of his serfs. But by the end of the century that
elapsed between their entry into Hungary and Stephen's accession, the Magyars had been transformed from pure
nomads into a settled people ; and even in those parts of the country where nomadism survived longer it had by the middle of the eleventh century practically ceased to exist."^" During the rest of the eleventh century the Hungarian
kings were engaged in almost incessant fighting. In 1046 and
1061 two dangerous pagan risings took place, followed by the attacks of fierce barbarian hordes the Pechenegs in 1067-8
and the Rumanians in 1071-2. Under Ladislaus and Koloman the Hungarian dominions were extended by the conquest of Croatia and a portion of the Dalmatian coast. Ladislaus
planted large colonies of Pechenegs in Transylvania and the
Trans-Dravian provinces. Under the rule of Koloman, who
greatly encouraged agriculture and trade, Hungary is said to have been the best governed state in Europe.
In the twelfth century Hungarian history was chiefly characterized by the interference of the Eastern Empire with
Magyar affairs, resulting politically in the increase of the power of the nobility, and ecclesiastically in the diminution of the influence of the Catholic Church. The thirteenth century was marked by two very important events. The first was the enactment of the Golden Bull, the foundation "^^ of Hungarian constitutional liberty. The chief
aim was to strengthen the Crown by uniting its interests



THE MAGYARS 67
with those of the mass of the Magyar nobility against the encroachments of the great barons. It includes among other
provisions the anti- feudal prohibition of heredity in the title and estates of lord-lieutenants and the exemption of the
nobles from all taxation. The other outstanding event of the thirteenth century was the Tatar invasion in 1241-2. This was followed by a whole
sale immigration into the country. Rumanians, mostly pagans, settled in Hungary in vast numbers, threatening to overwhelm the Christian population. In the year 1301 the house of Arpad came to an end, de
stroyed by the rise of the great nobles to power and a recognized position. During the four centuries of the rule of this dynasty the nomadic Magyar race had established itself
permanently in Central Europe, adopted Western Christianity, and founded a national monarchy on the Western model. Under the house of Anjou (1310-82) the Hungarian State was built up again, and the Magyars were led back to civilization. In 1370 Poland was added to the Hungarian throne, and during the next twelve years the dominions of King Louis included the greater part of Central Europe from Pomerania to the Danube, from the Adriatic to the Steppes of the Dnieper.
On the other hand, Hungary suffered during the fourteenth
century from various disasters, losses, and new perils. Hungary
was twice ravaged (1347-60, 1380-1) by the Black Death, which carried off at least one-fourth of the population. The
Vlachs (or Rumanians) of Moldavia (which together with Bessarabia and the Bukovina the Hungarians had ever since
the eleventh century claimed as part of their original home before they entered modern Hungary) threw off the Hungarian
yoke. King Louis was compelled in 1353 to acknowledge the ruler of the Bosnians as King of Bosnia, while both the Serbians
and the Bulgarians refused to acknowledge the hegemony of
Hungary. In the middle of the fourteenth century a new
danger began to threaten the kingdom. The Ottoman Turks
in 1353 crossed the Hellespont from Asia Minor and began
that career of conquest which made them the terror of
Europe, and in particular of Hungary, down to the end of the seventeenth century. They conquered Southern Bulgaria in 1365, overpowered Serbia in 1371, and threatened Croatia and Dalmatia in 1380. E2



68 THE FINNO-UGRIAN DIVISION
The Turkish peril became acute under Sigismund (1387
1437), who made it the chief aim of his policy to expel the Turks from Europe, or at least to keep them out of Hungary. For this purpose he endeavoured in 1413 to unite Christendom against the Turks, and thrice himself met them in the field.
He also fortified the southern frontier and turned a small fort,
the later Belgrade, into an enormous first-class fortress, which
proved strong enough to repel the Turks for more than a
century. In spite of wars and rebellions Hungary made some
progress during his reign. Magyar students at this time began to resort to foreign universities in considerable numbers ; thus between 1362 and 1450 no fewer than 4,151 frequented Vienna, and nearly as many Prague, though there were
already two universities in Hungary itself. Sigismund's successor Albert renewed hostilities in 1439
against the Turks, who had captured an important fortress in
Serbia and subjugated the greater part of Bosnia. The Magyars
under John Hunyadi defeated the Turks in 1442, but were in
turn beaten at Varna in 1444. Hunyadi, who in 1446 had been elected governor of Hungary, relieved Belgrade in 1454
and overthrew the Turkish army. Hunyadi's son, Matthias,
was elected King of Hungary in 1458. He raised an army of
first-rate efficiency, which also acted as a civilizing force by
curbing the lawlessness of the Magyar nobility. Politically,
Matthias raised Hungary to the rank of the greatest Power in
Central Europe. He succeeded in preserving the territorial
integrity of Hungary against the Turk. But throughout his
reign the Czechs and Germans were just as dangerous to his country as the Turks. After his death in 1490 the Magnates plunged the country back into the chaos of mediaevalism. There followed a period which was the. most discreditable in
the whole course of Hungarian history. In 1514 took place a terrible peasant rising, of which the enslavement of the Hungarian peasantry was the immediate consequence. The labouring class was converted into a
sullenly hostile force within the state. To this has been
mainly due the impossibility, from that time onwards, of a
healthy political life in Hungary.
The pressure of the Turks now began to be more serious than ever. In 1521 Sultan Suleiman succeeded in capturing
Belgrade, and in 1526 inflicted on the Magyars a complete



THE MAGYAES 69
defeat on the plain of Mohacz. He returned to his dominions with 105,000 captives and an enormous amount of booty, after utterly devastating one -fourth of Hungary. In 1541 Suleiman again invaded Hungary and captured Buda, finally agreeing
in 1547 to a five years' truce, for which the Hapsburg emperor
paid 100,000. The outcome was the division of the kingdom of Hungary into three parts, the Emperor holding thirty-five counties, the Hungarian ruler, with the title of prince, retaining Transylvania and the sixteen adjacent counties, while the rest, comprising most of the central counties, was annexed to the Turkish Empire. This division, in which the aims and interests of the parts were totally divergent, continued for
more than 150 years. Two fresh Turkish invasions took place
in 1552 and 1566, resulting in the capture of many forts. The suspension of hostilities was brought about by the truce of
Adrianople which, concluded in 1568, was prolonged till 1593
and consequently called the ' Long Peace '. It is probably no
exaggeration to say that no nation ever suffered more from the effects of foreign invasions combined with the misgovern
ment of its rulers than the Hungarians in the sixteenth
century. Their plight was aggravated by the hostility of the
Hapsburgs, who were determined to rule the Magyars from Vienna by means of foreigners, mainly German and Czech.
To all these evils were added the terrors of religious persecution. The Eeformation had in 1552 obtained complete recognition in Transylvania. But with the entry of the Jesuits
was inaugurated a fierce persecution, the deliberate object of
which was the extirpation of Protestantism. But as the latter was by this time identical with Magyarism, the very existence
of the Magyars as a nation was now threatened. A better
day, however, dawned with the Peace of Vienna, concluded
in 1606 by Stephen Bocskay of Transylvania. This treaty secured for the Magyars of Eoyal Hungary religious liberty,
political autonomy, and complete amnesty. It is remarkable as the first constitutional compact between the ruling dynasty and the Hungarian nation.
Almost equally important was the twenty years' truce of
Zsitvatorok, which was negotiated by Bocskay between the Emperor and the Sultan. This arrangement for the first time
established a working equilibrium between the three parts of
Hungary, with a decided preponderance in favour of Transyl



70 THE FINNO-UGRIAN DIVISION
vania. For more than half a century after the Peace of Vienna Transylvania thus became a bulwark of the liberties
of the Magyars. During these fifty years the Turkish Empire in consequence
of misrule was powerless to interfere in Hungarian politics.
But in 1657 the Turks again became active and occupied Transylvania, which in 1661 became a feudatory of the Turkish
Empire. In 1664 the Treaty of Yasvar gave Hungary a respite from regular Turkish invasions for a space of twenty years.
Meanwhile the Catholic reaction in Hungary, begun in 1601
on the plan of converting the great families, proved so successful that in 1665 only four noble Protestant houses remained in
Royal Hungary, and the country was completely Catholicized.
Under the Hapsburg Emperor Leopold I (1657-1705) the
Hungarian gentrj^ were subjected to cruel oppression as members of an inferior and guilty race. The activities of the Turks were renewed in 1683 with the
siege of Vienna, which was, however, unsuccessful. Their aggres
sive power was now on the wane. They were successively driven
out of Buda in 1686, Belgrade in 1688, and Bosnia in 1689. Though they rallied and threatened Vienna anew, they were defeated in 1691, and in 1697 were routed by Prince Eugene of
Savoy at Zenta. The Peace of Karlowitz, concluded in 1699, left the whole of Hungary (except an insignificant amount of territory) in the hands of the Emperor, finally reuniting her long
separated provinces under a common sceptre. This year marks the final deliverance of Hungary from Turkish dominion.
Liberation from the Turks, however, brought the Hungarians no internal relief Leopold had in 1687 transformed the
elective monarchy of Hungary into an hereditary one, and the
Peace of Karlowitz only strengthened the despotism prevailing in the land of the Magyars. The situation was aggravated by
the determination of the Primate Kollonich to Germanize Hungary by wholesale immigration into the recovered pro
vinces. A rising of malcontents in 1703 was followed in 1711
by the Peace of Szatmar, which guaranteed a general amnesty,
full religious liberty, and the recognition of the inviolability
of the ancient rights and privileges of the Magyars. By this
settlement the Hungarian nation secured all it had won by
former compacts with the Hapsburgs. Now began a new
period in which the interests of the dynasty and of the nation



THE MAGYAES 71
were identical, and in which the Magyars enjoyed the advan
tages of domestic tranquillity and recuperation for nearly a
century and a half.
By the Pragmatic Sanction, which secured the female succession of Maria Theresa, Hungary became an integral part of
the Hapsburg dominions.
A standing army under the control of the Austrian council
of war had hardly been established in 1715 when a new Turkish war broke out in the following year. Though the
Magyars were victorious (1716-18) and gained a considerable
amount of territory, nearly all their conquests were lost again
in a fresh conflict in 1739.
Now followed forty years of enlightened absolutism, in
which educational reform was promoted in Hungary, schools
and colleges being founded all over the country.
The well-meaning but misguided policy of Joseph II (1780
90), under whom an edict making German the official language
of the common state of Austria-Hungary was passed and a census for the purpose of taxation was introduced, led to a dangerous rebellion. His successor Leopold (1790-2) found
the country on the verge* of revolution, but by his wisdom
won back the Magyars. The Diet of 1790-1 passed^ laws
confirming the royal prerogatives and the national liberties.
Hungary was declared a free, independent, and unsubjugated
country, governed by its own laws and customs. Legislation
was to be exercised by the King and the Diet conjointly and by
them only. Diets were to be triennial. Latin was still to be
the official language, but Magyar was now to be introduced into universities and schools. The bonds between the Magyar nation and the Hapsburg dynasty were drawn closer by the struggle between Francis I
(1792-1835) and the French Eevolution, and were strengthened by Napoleon's mutilations of Hungary. Though towards the end of his reign the forces of reactionary absolutism were
everywhere supreme, a strong undercurrent in the opposite direction was beginning to run in preparation for future
emancipation. Thus when in 1823 a war-tax was imposed and recruits were called out without consulting the Diet, the counties instantly protested against this as an attack on the
constitution. In 1832 there was a large majority of Liberals in the House of Representatives, but their activities were



72 THE FINNO-UGEIAN DIVISION
frustrated by the Upper House, in which the Magnates united with the government to form a Conservative party.
On the accession of Ferdinand I (1835-48), the government,
becoming alarmed, attempted to crush the reform movement
by arresting and imprisoning the leading agitators, the chief
of whom was Louis Kossuth. But in 1839 the Liberals succeeded
in passing two important measures one making Magyar the
official language of Hungary, and the other freeing the
peasants' holdings from all feudal obligations. The Liberals under Kossuth in 1843 gained fresh triumphs in
the Diet ; Magyar was now declared to be the language of the schools and law-courts as well as of the legislature ; mixed
marriages were legalized ; and official positions were thrown
open to those who were not members of the nobility. In the next few years a disintegration of the Liberal party
set in, but in 1848 Deak reunited all the Liberals on the common platform of the 'Ten Points'. These, under the name of
the ' March Laws ', were adopted by the legislature and received the royal assent. Hungary thus became to all intents and
purposes an independent state. Though the Magyars were supported by the German demo
crats, who were in temporary power in Vienna, there was an ominous stirring of the subject races in Hungary itself. Croats, Vlachs (Rumanians), Serbs, Slovaks, resented Magyar domina
tion, which had been carefully secured under the revolutionary constitution by means of a very narrow franchise. Each of these races hoped that out of the chaos then prevailing it might succeed in creating for itself a separate national existence. Slav aspirations soon adopted the deliberate policy of a federal
system as opposed to the Magyar-Austrian dualism in favour at Pest and Vienna. Even the Imperial Government was induced to declare publicly at Vienna that the basis of the Austrian State was ' the recognition of the equal rights of all nationalities'. This at once roused the Hungarian Liberals. In July the Diet, under Kossuth, refused supply for the Croatian troops, and consented to sending reinforcements to the Imperial forces in Italy only on condition that the anti-Magyar races in Hungary should be first disarmed. The Croatians at once
declared open war on Hungary by crossing the Drave with an
army of 36,000 men. This placed the extreme revolutionaries in power at Pest. After the defeat of the Croatians on Septem



THE MAGYARS 73
ber 29, a large force of Hungarian militia was sent to the aid of the
German revolutionaries in Vienna, but they were defeated, and
the Vienna revolution collapsed. In December, 1848, Ferdinand abdicated in favour of his nephew Francis Joseph, then aged
eighteen. But the Hungarian Diet refused to acknowledge
him, on the ground that without the consent of the Diet no one could sit on the Hungarian throne. The nation was called
to arms, Louis Kossuth meanwhile being the actual ruler of
Hungary. In the ensuing* warfare the Austrians were at first
successful, but the Hungarian leader, Girgei, afterwards gained
the upper hand. On April 14, 1849, the Diet proclaimed the independence of Hungary, excluded the house of Hapsburg
from the throne, and elected Kossuth President of the Hungarian Eepublic. This step resulted in an alliance between
Austria and Eussia. One of the Hungarian armies was defeated
by the Austrians, and the other surrendered to the Russians, while Kossuth took refuge in Turkish territory.
Hungary was now placed under martial law, under which the country was subjected to wholesale confiscations and brutalities. Six years (1851-6) of pure terrorism were suc
ceeded by the Bach system of ruling the Magyars. Not recognizing historical Hungary, it 'postulated an Empire con
sisting of one common indivisible State, of which mutilated
Hungary (shorn of Transylvania, Croatia and Slavonia, Fiume
and the Temes Banat) formed only an important section. The
supreme government was entrusted to an imperial council responsible to the Emperor alone, while the counties were
administered by imperial officials Germans, Czechs, and Gali
cians who did not even understand the Maygar tongue. As
the Magyar nation refused to recognize this system, it was ofiTered a shadowy constitution and autonomy in the ' October
Diploma'. The Hungarian leader, Deak, however, demanded
the restoration of the constitution of 1848 in its entirety, and the Diet of 1861 adopted an address to the crown praying
for the restoration of the political and territorial integrity of Hungary, a full restitution of the fundamental laws, and
a public coronation of the king. The reply to this was the dissolution of the Diet and the levying of taxes by military execution. The attitude of the Emperor was, however, fundamentally modified by the Peace of Prague, concluded at the
end of the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. The exclusion of



74 THE FINNO-UGRIAN DIVISION
Austria from Italy and Germany made the fate of the Haps
burg monarchy depend on some permanent arrangement with
Hungary. The result was the Compromise (AusgleicJi) of 1867,
which practically consisted of an amplification of the March
laws of 1848. A public coronation of the king took place on
June 8. Hungary was now a free and independent state.
Since 1867 the Magyars have been divided, broadly speak
ing, into two parties those who accept the Compromise, believing it to have increased the polftical influence of Hungary ;
and those who see in the Compromise an abandonment of the essentials of independence, and aim at the , restoration of the conditions established in 1848.
Count Andrassy was instrumental in preventing the Imperial Chancellor, Beust, from intervening in favour of France in the
Franco-German War of 1870. In the following year he succeeded Beust as Foreign Minister, the first instance of a Hun
garian statesman attaining to this position under the Hapsburg dynasty. It was fortunate that, in the hopeless political confusion prevailing in Hungary at that time, Count Tisza, the leader of the Liberal party, succeeded to power in 1872.
During the next eighteen years he practically ruled Hungary
as a dictator. The chief aim of his policy was to transform the
old polyglot Hungarian kingdom into a homogeneous Magyar
state. With this object in view he succeeded in putting an
end to the old strife between Catholics and Protestants by
uniting them in a common zeal for a race ideal. He also did
much to promote the astonishing material progress made by Hungary during the last fifty years. Though it must be admitted that the political corruption of Hungary has been mainly due to him, he undoubtedly deserves the credit of having placed the country on a sound economic basis. It was his statesmanlike temper that made Hungary a power in the affairs of Europe. It was also largely his influence that restrained the anti-Russian ardour of the Magyars on the outbreak of the
Russo-Turkish War of 1877-8. The following nine years were devoted to the financial and commercial rehabilitation of Hun
gary by developing a vast system of railways, and by other
measures. This was chiefly the work of Gabor Baross, who entered the cabinet in 1886, and was Hungary's greatest finance minister. The attacks made on Count Tisza during the debate on the



THE MAGYAES 75
Kossuth Eepatriation Bill led to his resignation. The ministries that followed were of brief duration. BaniFy, in 1894, carried through the Army Education Bill, the aim of which was to
Magyarize the whole Hungarian portion of the joint army ;
but he was so violently attacked on the proposal to renew the commercial convention with Austria that he resigned in 1899.
The treaty was, however, renewed till 1903. The proposal made in 1902 to raise the contingent of Hun
garian recruits by 15,000 revived the question of a common Austro-Hungarian army. Parliament refused to pass the Bill except in return for the introduction of the Hungarian national
flag into Hungarian regiments, and the substitution of Magyar
for German in words of command. The king, however, refused
to yield his prerogative under the Compromise of 1867, and
reaffirmed the rights of the crown to maintain German as a
common military language. Count Istvan Tisza tried to carry out the programme of the king and the majority, but. failed.
He appealed to the country, but was utterly defeated. The repressive measures which the Government thereupon resorted
to censorship, restriction of the right of public meeting, dismissal of officials, dragooning of assemblies and municipalities
were steadily met by the Magyar nation with a refusal to
pay taxes, to supply recruits, and to carry on the machinery of administration. The main object of the resistance was to im
pose, by coercion, or if necessary by corruption, the Magyar language and Magyar culture on the non-Magyar races of
Hungary. As a remedy for this state of affairs a coalition
government was formed, which, having agreed with the crown
to postpone military questions, put forward the proposal of universal suffrage, so as to obtain the opinion of the whole people on the points at issue between them and the crown.
In the ensuing election the Liberal party was practically wiped out, and the coalition cabinet remained in office for two years and a half without carrying out its programme. Meanwhile, all the abuses previously prevailing were continued muzzling of the press in the interests of Magyar nationalism, imprison
ment of non-Magyar deputies, and persecution of subordinate
races. In October, 1907, there was a great demonstration in favour of universal suffrage, followed by riots at Budapest. Finally, in November, 1908, Count Andrassy introduced a Bill granting manhood suffrage, but with so many qualifying con



76 THE FINNO-UGEIAN DIVISION
ditions as to make its effect nugatory. Among its neutralizing
features were plural voting and the absence of the ballot. Its
intention was at once recognized as Magyar domination rather
than fulfilment of the contract. Had it passed, it would only have strengthened the Magyar and the German elements in the
electorate. A crisis arose in 1909 on the question of a separate Hungarian bank, in view of the expiry, at the end of 1910, of the Charter of the Austro-Hungarian State Bank. It was proposed to open negotiations for a convention between the banks of Austria and of Hungary, and in the case of failure to establish
a Bank of Hungary entirely dissociated from that of Austria.
The Emperor opposed this scheme on the ground that electoral
reform, the chief article of the ministerial programme, had not
been carried out. Dissensions broke out in the cabinet in regard
to the separate bank and the Magyarization of the Hungarian
regiments. As the King- Emperor refused to make any concessions to the Magyar national demands, the Hungarian Par
liament was adjourned indefinitely at the end of the year without even voting the estimates for 1910. Hungary thus once
more entered on a period of extra- constitutional government.
The most important event in 1910 was the collapse of the
Coalition and the accession to power of the new ' National
Party of work '. A cabinet of moderate views was formed, but was met with a vote of want of confiidence. The following
general election gave the government a triumphant majority.
The King in June announced that a Bill would be laid before
the Chamber ' on the basis of universal suffrage and in complete maintenance of the unitary national character of the Hungarian
state '. A new constitution was also promulgated for the provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina which had been annexed in
1908. A proposal to increase the Austrian Army and Navy
was further announced. The renewal of the Charter of the Austro-Hungarian State
Bank, which had expired at the end of 1910, again led to the
Independent party pleading for Hungary having a bank of its
own. The general election held in June, 1911 ; made the Social Democrats the predominant party in the Diet. In this year
a protest was made against the German dues exacted from
Austro-Hungarian shipping on the Elbe, while a strong feeling was aroused regarding the Italian attack on Turkish torpedo-boats near Prevesa on the Albanian coast.



THE MAGYARS 77
A resolution was passed by the Kossuth group that reservists should not in future be called out in time of peace unless the annual levy of recruits had been previously passed by the Chamber ; but on the King threatening to abdicate the resolu
tion was dropped. A two years' military service Bill was
passed ; and a Bill to increase the annual contingent of Honved
recruits was adopted, but amid scenes of great violence. On
December 31, 191.^', was produced the long-expected Reform Bill
(delayed since 1905), by which the number of voters was
increased by 75 per cent, of what it then was.
On March 8, 1913, the Franchise Reform Bill was passed. It was in almost every detail marked by a determination to maintain at all costs the hegemony of the Magyar element. Dis
turbances in Croatia were allayed by an arrangement allowing the use of the Croatian language on Croatian railways.
On June 28, 1914, the murder of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand and his wife took place at Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. This crime being treated as the result of a Serbian conspiracy,
a peremptory note of unprecedented harshness was on July 23 presented to Serbia requiring a reply by 6 p.m. on July 25.
Serbia accepted the conditions ' in principle ', but suggested arbitration. Diplomatic relations were at once broken' off,
and though Sir E. Grey proposed arbitration by the four
Great Powers, war was declared on Serbia by Austria- Hungary on July 28.
a. The Hungarians, who were once the bitter enemies of the Turks and were subject to their rule for a century and a half, have for the first time become the allies of the Turks in the present war. It is noteworthy that there is a marked
parallelism between the position of the Hungarians and the
Ottoman Turks as nations. Both are members of the Turanian family. They are the only two members of that family that
have shown themselves capable of founding and maintaining independent states for centuries. Both have lost their original racial characteristics by constant admixture with non-Turanian elements, but have both nevertheless preserved their original Turanian languages which are closely akin. Both have
about the same populations (c. 20,000,000), of which scarcely
50 per cent, are Hungarians and Turks (cp. pp. 59 and 212),
the rest of the inhabitants of their states being made up of
a number of alien races. Both aim at preserving their own



78 THE FINNO-UGRIAN DIVISION
nationality intact by repressing the peoples subject to them. Both are predominantly agricultural and both are warlike. There might thus seem to be the possibility of a natural
feeling of solidarity between the two nations. It is, however, doubtful whether they will ever be drawn together except by
motives of expediency and self-interest. It is true that during
the Eusso-Turkish War of 1877-8 the Magyars showed strong sympathy with the Turks, but this was most probably due to the anti-Russian feeling caused by the part B-ussia had played
in suppressing the Magyar revolution of 1849. On the other hand, there was in the earlier period of Turanian studies
a distinct bias among Magyar philologists against recognizing close kinship with other Turanians as representing a lower
grade of civilization. Again, the languages, though akin, are
mutually unintelligible ; and difference of religion, combined with historical associations, profoundly divides the two peoples. The Turk, on the other hand, is more and more tending to reject European culture and influence. Thus the alliance of the two Turanian elements, in association with the two Germanic nations of the Central Empires, is likely to continue on a utilitarian basis only.

TURANIANS



CHAPTER III
THE SAMOYED DIVISION
Hahitaf. This division of the Turanian family, though
numericall}^ small, covers an immense territory, extending along the coast of European and Asiatic Russia from the
White Sea to the banks of the river Khatanga, and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Sayan mountains in the south. Their chief abodes are the desolate Tundras^ of the Arctic coast. In old accounts of voyages Samoedia was always regarded as the country between the Pechora and the
Ob, but at the present day the Samoyeds extend much farther
east. On the western side of the Urals they occupy the district
of Mezen in the government of Archangel, and on the eastern side, in Siberia, the territory from 44 E. as far as the peninsula of Taimir. Formerly they extended southward to
the Altai range and its eastern extension, the Sayan mountains,
and to the Upper Ob and Yenisei, but were driven northwards by Turco-Tatars in the fifth century of our era and later
by Ostyak tribes. They gradually spread northward, following
the course of the Ob and the Yenisei, occupying the region between these rivers till they reached the Arctic coast, along which they spread westward to the White Sea and eastward into the Taimir Peninsula. Tribes. There are three main tribes of the Samoyeds :
a. The YuraJcs, who occupy the coast region from the
White Sea to the Yenisei. They are a vigorous and brave
people, mostly reindeer nomads who wander in the woodless Tundras within the Arctic circle. They also engage in hunt
ing and fishing to some extent, displaying great daring during their expeditions. Their chief centres are near Obdorsk and near the Gulf of Mezen. Five sub-dialects may be distinguished
in their language.
b. The TavgJiis, who live east of the Yuraks in the Taimir Peninsula, and extend from the Yenisei to the Khatanga.
They are mostly reindeer nomads who wander in the Tundras.



TRIBES 83
c. Tlie Ostyak Samoyeds, who do not belong to the Tundra district, but live south of the other two tribes in the forest zone of Tobolsk and Yeniseisk between the Middle Ob and the Yenisei (lat. 60 N. and between long. 80 and 90 E.).
They are for the most part forest nomads, living chiefly by hunting, though they at the same time fish in the Yenisei. Instead of reindeer they have horses as well as dogs. They do not live in tents but in small huts called yurtas. Only a small portion of this tribe lives in the north, on the Taz river. These
own reindeer, but only few in number. d. These main tribes are further subdivided. Thus in the Yamal Peninsula ten different sub-tribes may be distinguished,
each with its fixed boundaries for reindeer pasture. Besides these three main branches, there are in the south of Siberia several small tribes of Samoyed origin that still to some
extent inhabit the old home of the Samoyed group, the Altai and the Sayan mountains, and the region to the north of these
ranges, between the Upper Ob and the Yenisei, in the south
of the governments of Tomsk and Yeniseisk. These. tribes have been largely Tatarized and are fast losing their identity.
At the time of Pallas (1776) they spoke the Samoyed language,
but a few decades later they were much under Tatar influence,
and now there are only traces of their real relationship to be
found. Here again we have an example of members of one Turanian group being absorbed by those of another. These' southern Samoyed s are :
1. The Soyotes (or Soyones), who live between the Altai and
the Sayan mountains, partly in the Chinese territory of northwestern Mongolia on the Russian frontier, from the sources of
the river Kobdo to lake Kossogol, and still farther eastward
towards the Selenga. They are a small and rapidly disappear
ing tribe, isolated among their cold and bare mountains.
They live entirely by hunting the sable, the squirrel, and the
bear, the fur of which they exchange for their own requirements. They use reindeer, less often horses, for driving and
hunting. They live in wooden huts (yurtas) in different places
according to the season of the year. A section of them has
adopted a Mongolian (the Buryat) dialect. Their religion is partly the Lamaist form of Buddhism, partly Shamanism. They are an example of a Samoyed tribe which was formerly
Turkified, and is now being rapidly Mongolized. f2



84 THE SAMOYED DIVISION
2. The Karagasses inhabit the northern slopes of the Sayan
range (between 90 and 95 E.). Numbering only 449 in 1911,- they are losing their distinctive characteristics.
3. The Motars (or Motors), who live to the north of the
Karagasses, have become merged in the neighbouring Tuba
Tatars and the Soyotes. One section of them formerly entered China and was exterminated. 4. The Kamassins live to the north of the Motars in the Kansk district of Yeniseisk. They are herdsmen and agriculturists. Their language has a large Tatar admixture.
5. The Koibals, who inhabit the Upper Yenisei, formerly left the Sayan mountains and took possession of the Abakan Steppe (in the Minusinsk region), which had been abandoned
by the Kirghiz in the earlier years of last century. They are hardly to be distinguished from the Tatars of Minusinsk. They are cattle-breeders.
6. The Belth's, who live in the Abakan Steppe, are agriculturists and cattle-breeders. Their language is of a Tatar
type. In religion they ar6 nominally Christians.
Name. The name Samoyed, by which the Russians call this
people, is of uncertain meaning ; but the first part of the word is most probably related to Saine and Suomi, the names b}^
which the Lapps and the Finns respectively called their own
country. They call themselves Hazava, ' the men '. The
.Ostyaks call them Orglioy or VorTcho, names which suggest
relationship to ' Ugrian '. The name Samoyed itself occurs in a Russian chronicle as early as a. d. 1096. Number. The total number of the Samoyed population is
somewhat conjectural. Though formerly doubtless very much
greater, it is now seriously reduced and can hardly amount to
much over 20,000. The figures given for the three main tribes"" in Asiatic Russia (for 191 1) are : Yuraks, 7,057 ; Tavghis, 1,370 ; Ostyak Samoyeds, 6,559 ; a total of 14,986 for Siberia. To these should be added about 6,000 Yuraks on the European
side of the Urals. We thus obtain an aggregate of nearly 21,000. By the inclusion of the small remnants of the Tatarized
Samoyed tribes of Southern Siberia, the sum total of the
Samoyeds recognizable as a distinct racial unit can hardly
exceed 22,000 souls. Characteristics. In general physique the Samoyeds resemble
the Ugrian Ostyaks. But their eyes are narrower, and their



CHAEACTEEISTICS AND MODE OF LIFE 85
complexions and hair are darker than those of people belonging to undoubted Finno-Ugrian stocks. The Samoyed is short in
stature the average height of the men being 5 ft. 2 in., that of
the women slightly less. They are mesocephalic. Their hair is
straight, black, and glossy. The colour of their skin is sallow.
The eyes are narrow, oblique, and far apart. The face is broad, flat, and round, with little or no beard. The cheek-bones are prominent ; the nose is flat and open ; the lips are thick. As a rule they are stoutly built and very muscular. There has been some admixture of Russian blood, the race being less pure in the west than in the east. To the west of the Pechora a Slavonic and Teutonic strain is observable, some Samoyeds being found here with light hair, fair skin, and eyes of the
Aryan type. They are intelligent, energetic, pacific, and cheerful ; sociable and hospitable ; honest, but thriftless. They are very dirty and never wash; and never change their clothes till they
fall to pieces. Women are regarded by them as unclean, and
are not allowed to enter certain parts of the chum or conical
tent made of reindeer skins.
Mode of Life. The main occupations of the Samoyeds are reindeer breeding, hunting, and fishing. Before their north
ward migration they also practised agriculture. The Yuraks
and Tavghis, as mainly reindeer breeders, are nomadic, being
on the march with their tents for four months in the year, as
they migrate south in winter and north in summer. A rich
Samoyed the richest are found in the Yamal Peninsula may
possess as many as 5,000 reindeer. The Ostyak Samoyed is
more engaged in hunting and to a less extent in fishing. In
hunting the Samoyeds formerly used bows and arrows, but
now employ primitive flintlocks. Most of the implements
used by the Samoyed are made of bone and stone. But he
also employs three metal tools the axe, the knife, and the
borer with which he is very dexterous. The women are
expert in sewing.
The Samoyeds, like the Osfcyaks, also engage in trade, taking
their furs to Berezov, Obdorsk, and elsewhere. But the Zirians, who are the Jews of the Tundra, have most of this trade in their hands. But though the Samoyeds are nomads, they have shown
themselves capable of settling down. Thus at Kozhva, in



86 THE SAMOYED DIVISION
the Government of Archangel, some of them have become
a stationary population engaged in growing barley, rearing
cattle, and fishing.
Clothing and Food. The clothing of both men and women among the Samoyeds is made of reindeer skin. Both sexes
wear charms, the favourite one being the tooth of the bear. Their chief food is the flesh of reindeer. In some parts they
make a kind of rye bread. They are fond of chewing tobacco,
taking snuff, and drinking vodka.
Customs. Monogamy prevails among the Samoyeds, though
there is no objection to polygamy. A price is regularly paid
for the bride. The Samoyed will sometimes sell his wife for
some teams of reindeer or exchange her for another man's wife. Interment has become the custom of the Samoyeds since
their adoption of Christianity. But the traditional method of burial was to deposit the bodies on the Tundra in what were
merely wooden boxes, which were consequently often rifled by wolves and foxes. The indigenous belief of the Samoyeds is
that beyond the mouth of the Ob below the earth lies the world of the departed, where the shadow will live as long as it lived on earth, while the soul is reincarnated.
Religion. Though the Samoyeds are nominally Christians they have retained a good deal of their primitive religion, and are essentially still heathen. They believe in their old divini
ties, offer sacrifices to wooden idols, and hold their Shaman
priests (called tadehi) in high esteem. They think that the
God of the Christians cannot know much about reindeer, and consequently appeal to their native gods in matters connected with their herds. Of their indigenous deities the chief is Num, the giver of life. They also believe in a devil called Aa, in
certain other spirits, and in household gods. The latter can be approached without any mediator, but for the others the inter
vention of a Shaman, who is regarded as a representative of
Num, is necessary. The Samoyeds have no temples, but resort
to certain places in the hills which they consider sacred. The
island of Vaigach is regarded as especially holy, and it is there
that, the devout Samoyed would wish to be buried. One of
their chief idols, called Khese, is in the Yamal Peninsula.
Language. Linguistically the Samoyeds are more closely connected with the Finns than with any other branch of the



LANGUAGE AND HISTORY 87
Turanians. In these two divisions the agglutinative process
has advanced much further than in Mongolian, Tungusic, and
Turkish. Moreover, the relationship in vocabulary of these
two languages to one another is much closer than to any of the
other Turanian divisions. The degree of agglutination attained
by them is not far removed from the inflexional character of
the Indo-European languages. They thus form a kind of tran
sition to the inflexional stage. Within the three main dialects twelve sub-dialects have been distinguished.
History. The Samoyeds have never played any part in
history, and little is known of their origin ; but that their old
home lay in the Altai and Sayan ranges is indicated by the fact that several South Samoyed tribes that still spoke the
Samoyed language in the eighteenth century even now inhabit
the northern slopes of those ranges. The exact period when
the main body of the Samoyeds in the north migrated from
this region is uncertain, because the earliest information we Lave of them is from Nestor, in the eleventh century, when
they were already in occupation of their present territory.
The cause of their northward migration was the pressure of
the Turks who invaded Southern Siberia in the fifth century. One section of them followed the course of the Yenisei, the other that of the Ob. That this movement was due to the Turks is shown by the fact that, whenever in the south a still
existing Samoyed tribe is found, there is always a Turkish one south of it, and that all the Samoyed tribes that have lost their
nationality appear to have become Turks only. The Samoyeds also came into contact with Finnish tribes. Tradition indicates
that some of the Samoyed tribes were driven away by Finns,
while others drove the Finns away. Thus the Ugrian Ostyaks
are said to have expelled the Samoyeds from the lower Ob to the coast of the Arctic Ocean. The only region, on the other hand, from which the Samoyeds seem to have ousted the Finns is that which lies to the west of the Urals, It is from the Russians that we derive most of our scanty knowledge of the Samoyeds in earlier times. Three Samoyed peoples are mentioned in Siberia as living east of the Yenisei
and south of the river Kan the Tubins, the Motars, and the Kamassins. Although small in numbers they were warlike,
and strenuously resisted subjection to Russian supremacy. The Tubins first began to pay tribute to the Russians in 1629,



88 THE SAMOYED DIVISION
but they only did so regularly after 1654. These three tribes
were forest Samoyeds, whose chief occupation was hunting,
which accounted for their skill in archery. At the present day
the Tubins have disappeared, and the rest, with the exception
of a few Kamassins, have been Turkiiied. But the name Tuba has remained, for the Koibals call themselves by it even now,
while Altaian tribes call the Black Forest Tatars ' Tuba '. The Bubo, mentioned by the Chinese, were no doubt the same Samoyed tribe. This is indicated not only by the name, but by the habitat of this people mentioned by the Chinese, as well
as by their occupation with hunting and fishing, which they never changed from the seventh to the seventeenth century.
The connexion of the Samoyeds with the Eussians in Europe
is of long standing. In the eleventh century they paid tribute to the Novgorodians. Since the sixteenth century they have
been protected by law in their occupation of the Tundras. In the south they have been impoverished by the loss of their hunting grounds as Russian civilization has spread northward. Russian rule, however, is not oppressive. Thus an adult Yurak pays a tax of l, which cannot be considered heavy. In 1835
the Samoyeds were given considerable powers of self-govern
ment, being ruled in their own affairs by elders or mayors, one
for each Tundra, who is governor and judge in one, as well as collector of the tribute, which he pays to the Government.
A further advance in this direction was made in 1892, when a law was passed sanctioning native councils. These meet annually in winter.
The Samoyeds are a dying race as a separate people; for they are being pushed farther north, and are becoming poorer.
They attach great importance to their nationality, and keep aloof from the Russians, being conscious that they cannot retain their language, religion, and customs in contact with civilization.

NOTES
^ The term tundra, borrowed by the Russians from the Finns, signifies a treeless, swampy, moss-producing country fringing the Arctic Ocean. As the Samoyeds, like the Lapps, mostly possess reindeer herds, they have to
keep to these inhospitable regions, which are little suited for human habitation.
^ According to Asiatic Russia, Petrograd, 1914.
^ Castren considers the Samoyeds to be a mixture of Ugrians with Mongolians, while Quatrefages classes them with the Voguls. Radlolf thinks it is Ugro-Samoyeds whose relics are the numberless graves of the Bronze Period which are scattered through western Siberia, in the Altai, and on the Yenisei in the Minusinsk region. The people buried in these graves were
not nomads, but husbandmen, who kept horses, sheep, and goats. They were familiar with mininor.



CHAPTEE IV,
THE TUNGUS DIVISION
Habitat. The vast domain inhabited by the Tungus covers many hundred thousand square miles in central and eastern Siberia and in the basin of the Amur. It stretches from the Yenisei eastwards to the Pacific, where it occupies most of the seaboard between Korea and Kamchatka. It touches the Arctic Ocean in the coast district from west of the Lena to east of the Yana river. It continues along the Anyui river
and the Stanovoi mountains eastward to the Chukchee Peninsula. But the Tungus are chiefly to be found in the region watered by the three large eastern tributaries of the Yenisei, which are respectively called the Upper, the Middle or Stony,
and the Lower Tunguska. The Amur also is mainly a Tungus
river almost from its source to its mouth, a number of their tribes being distributed along its course, as well as along its
tributaries, the Sungari and Ussuri, in the south-east of Manchuria, and the Shilka in the north-west. Name. The name in its Eussian form, Tungus, is the Chinese
T'unghu, which is probably a corruption meaning ' the people '.
The Samoyeds call them Aiyas, 'younger brothers', which
implies that they were late immigrants into the territory near
the Yenisei from their original home in the east on the Amur.
Numbers. Though wandering over so vast a territory, the Tungus are very few in number, not exceeding 75,204, according to the estimate given by Asiatic Russia (1914),^ in Siberia.^ There are besides, in China, over a million Manchus,^ who are the most important Tungus tribe. The numbers of the
Tungus are steadily decreasing, owing to the ravages of small
pox, scarlet fever, and especially famine. Their domain is also being encroached on from the north and east by the aggressive
Yakuts, and from the south by Eussians, now settled in compact bodies in the province of Irkutsk about the upper course of the
Yenisei. In the Amur valley the same fate is overtaking the
kindred tribes, who are disappearing before the great waves of



CHARACTERISTICS, ETC. 91
Chinese migration from the south, and Russian encroachments from both east and west.
Characteristics. The physical type of the Tungus essentially resembles the Mongolian. They have broad flat features, small
nose, wide mouth, thin lips, small black and somewhat slanting eyes, black lank hair, scanty beard, dark olive or bronze com
plexion, and low stature averaging not more than 5 ft. 4 in. They are distinguished from other Turanian peoples by the square shape of the skull and the slim, wiry, well-proportioned
figure. The preceding description applies more particularly
to the Tunguska tribes, who may be regarded as typical Tungus. They are fearless hunters, capable of enduring hardships and
want with great fortitude. They are cheerful, persevering, frank, trustworthy, modest, yet self-reliant. In moral qualities they appear to be easily superior to any other native inhabitants of Siberia.
Mode of Life. The great bulk of the Tungus, quite 95 per
cent., are nomads, who use the reindeer both for riding and
driving. They also to some extent use horses, cattle, and dogs.
They chiefly hunt fur-bearing animals, the most valuable cf
which is the black fox. They exchange the skins with Russian
and Yakut traders for provisions, clothing, and other neces
saries of life. Only about 1 per cent, of the Tungus are agricul
turists, who, having intermarried with Russians and forgotten
their language, have settled down chiefly in the Trans-Baikal
district. The remaining ^ per cent, of the Tungus have, like
some of the Mongolian Buryats, joined the regiment of Cossacks.
The Tungus have no towns, villages, or houses, but only tents, of which not more than two or three are found together. The summer dwelling is made of birch-bark, the winter one
of skins, more rarely of logs. Their main food is the milk and the flesh of reindeer, dried
fish, and a sort of cheese. They have little liking for a
vegetable diet.
Customs. A son grows up in his father's dwelling and has
no property of hi own. When he is married he occupies his
own section of the tent. The Tungus girl is free in her choice
of a husband, and receives her own share of inheritance like
her brother. Marriage is exogamous, though in the north, as



92 THE TUNGUS DIVISION
among the Yakuts, endogamous tribes are found. There is no
objection to polygamy, but few Tungus can afford more than
one wife. When a man dies his corpse is usually sewn up in reindeer
skin and then placed in a wooden coffin, sometimes on high
wooden posts, while among the pastoral people round Lake
Baikal it is interred in the ground. On returning from the funeral the mourners try to obliterate their tracks,'* or cut
down trees to bar the way, in order that the spirit of the dead
man may not pursue them.
The Tungus have a peculiar dance, which consists in
stamping on the ground while they repeat again and again one particular word. They have but few musical instruments. Among the southern Tungus, the influence of China has led to the development of beautiful forms of art.
Religion. Though many of the northern Tungus have been
baptized and are therefore reckoned as ' G-reek Christians *, they have not been affected by Russian orthodoxy below the surface, and most of them are still devoted to Shamanism, secretly keeping the claws of wild animals as amulets and
observing Christian rites only under compulsion. Among the
southern Tungus a good number are Buddhists owing to Chinese influence ; the rest are Shamanists. History. There is no doubt that the original home of the Tungus was Manchuria, still the habitat of their most im
portant tribe, the Manchus, and that all the Tungus tribes wandering in eastern Siberia started from the fertile banks of
the Amur. Hardly anything is known of their early history excepting the information supplied by the Chinese and sum
marized below (under Manchus). The Russians, who found the northern Tungus on the Yenisei at the beginning of the
seventeenth century, first mention their name in 1612. In
the following century these Tungus are described as engaged in severe struggles with the Yakuts.
Tribes. We may distinguish two main divisions of the
Tungus based on their geographical distribution the northern
or Siberian Tungus who are scattered over different parts of Siberia (in the west on the Tunguska, in the north-east over Yakutsk, and in the south-east on the Amur), and the southern Tungus in Manchuria.



CHARACTERISTICS, ETC. 93
A. The Northern or Siberian Division
This includes : {a) In the west, the Chapogir who inhabit
the territory between the Lower and the Middle Tunguska. (h) In the north-east a reindeer nomad tribe living between
Chaun Bay and the Anadir, to the north of the Stanovoi
mountains, and the Lamuts in the Verkhoyansk and Kolima districts of Yakutsk, along the northern shore of the Sea of Okhotsk ; in the south-east, eight tribes which are either wholly
or partially Tungus, falling into two linguistic groups of four.
(c) The most widely spread and at the same time the westernmost of these are the Orochon. They extend from the north
of Lake Baikal eastwards to the Shilka, along that river and
the Amur to near its confluence with its northern tributary the Oldoi (c. 123 E.), and northwards along the Olekma valley almost as far as Olekminsk on the Lena, and southwards to
the Khingan mountains. Originally living in Yakutsk they
migrated to the Amur in 1825 and occupied part of the territory of the Manegir. They inhabit both sides of the Amur. In' physique they are small and thin. They have flat
faces, with small, sleepy-looking eyes, which are black or brown in colour ; large, often pointed noses ; large mouths, with thin lips and broad cheeks. Their hair is black and smooth ; their eyebrows are thin and their beards scanty.
They are a nomadic people occupied with reindeer breeding
(as their name indicates). They have preserved their tribal
peculiarities in great purity. Nominally Christians, they keep up a good deal of their old Shamanism. They wear the teeth and claws of animals as amulets, and erect wooden idols in their yurto,s or huts.
{d) The Manegir live east of the Orochon, along the right
bank of the Amur, from the mouth of the Oldoi to that of the Zeya, and up the latter river and its tributaries to about
lat. 54 K and between long. 123' and 128 E. They are
nomadic, but they employ horses, of which they have large herds, while the Orochon use reindeer. They frequent the
river banks in summer but the forest regions in winter. Their language is like that of the Orochon : both for instance
accent the last syllable of words. But their physique is more like the Manchu type, while that of the Orochon rather resembles the Tungus of the north.



94 THE TUNGUS DIVISION
(e) The Birar occupj the valley of the Bureya and its affluents up to about lat. 52 N., and extend towards the river
Dichum (c. lat. 49 N., long. 131 E.). They are nomads who, like the Manegir, employ horses. They resemble the Manegir
both in physiognomy and in language. They have borrowed words from the Chinese, the Manchus, and the Daurians. (/) The Kile live east of the Birar in the valleys of the
Urmi and the Kur (which are northern tributaries of the Amur on its north-easterly course), but do not extend down to the Amur. They seem originally to have been a tribe of reindeer
nomads who, having settled on the Kur, took to hunting and
fishing.
In the region of the lower Amur near the sea there is a linguistically connected group of Tungus tribes whose habitat
lies between 50-53 N. and 136-143 E. Three of these are on the mainland and one on the island of Sakhalin. Taken from north to south they are the following :
ig) The Negda inhabit the valley of the Amgun down to
near its confluence with the Amur.
(h) To the south of them live the Sanagir, along the upper and middle course of the river Gorin, and extend north-eastwards from the west of Lake Ovoron.
(i) The OlcJia, located to the east of the Sanagir, occupy
both sides of the Amur from the mouth of the Gorin to the
coast. As they show a modification of the Tungus type, they have by some been thought to be of Mongol origin. They
keep dogs in large numbers. (j) The 07'oJi:e inhabit the northern half of the island of Sakhalin. They are said to be only 749 in number. They are reindeer nomads. They are alluded to as early as 1709 by travellers as the reindeer-owning inhabitants of Sakhalin.
They use bows, arrows, and spears for hunting. Their food consists offish, meat, roots, and herbs.
B. TJie fSoutJiern or Manchuricm Division
The Southern or Manchurian group of the Tungus occupies the territory south of the Amur, not only Manchuria, but also the coastal region to the east of the Ussuri river. (k) The Dauriaiis live on the right or southern bank of the
Amur below Blagovyeshchensk. They are also found farther
west on the Nonni river.^ Both physically and linguistically



CHARACTERISTICS, ETC. 95
they show a strong Mongolian and Chinese admixture. In type they are hard to distinguish from the Manchus. They have ovhl and intellectual faces ; their cheeks are less broad than those of other Tungus ; their noses are rather prominent ;
their eyebrows are straight; their skin is tawny, and their hair brown. They are a tall, strong people. They have to a great extent adopted Chinese customs ; thus the upper class shave their heads in front and grow pigtails behind. By
occupation they are primarily hunters, but they also engage in fishing. In religion they are Shamanists. Outside many of their houses are to be seen shrines containing idols with basins of incense before them. Another religious decoration is a long pole adorned with votive skulls. (Z) The Solo7i are an important tribe of Northern Manchuria, neighbours of the Daurians. They live on both sides of the
Nonni river, northwards of Tsitsikar. They are chiefly hunters,
though some of them are agriculturists, cattle-breeders, and traders. They begin hunting the sable early in October.
They are nomadic, using horses for hunting, in which even
their women take part. They keep horses, sheep, oxen, camels,
and hunting dogs. As regards religion they, like all Man.churians, are devoted to Shamanism. Like the Daurians, they have been largely mixed with Chinese. (m) The Ma^ichus are the sole Tungus tribe that has dis
tinguished itself. The only one with any history, they have
given to China its last dynasty, which ruled from 1644 down to the establishment of the Republic a few years ago. Their
original home is the region round the upper course of the
Sungari, north of Kirin (lat. 44 N., long. 1.26 E.). Their name, which seems to have been first used by the Russians atjput the middle of the seventeenth century, is of uncertain
origin.*^ The number of Manchus in Russian territory is 3,340, while in Manchuria it perhaps exceeds 1,000,000."^ Here the Manchus are outnumbered by the Chinese immigrants ^ and
the half-breed population. The Chinese who migrate into
Manchuria nearly always intermarry with Manchu women.
Thus the Manchu nation is gradually being absorbed by the Chinese. The Manchus are most numerous in the towns as officials and merchants. But a considerable proportion of them still live in the mountains round the valley of the Liao.
A considerable number of Manchus live in China as officials,



96 THE TUNGUS DIVISION
but they disappear in the Chinese population. . The Manchus are an energetic and warlike race. They are taller in stature than any of their neighbours. They have also more' marked
features, thicker and more arched noses, less thin lips, and larger mouths.
The Manchu language, which is still characterized by the
Turanian vowel harmony, is more worn down than the sister
languages, being regular and easy to learn. It is the only Tungus dialect which has developed a certain amount of
literature; for since the foundation of the Manchu dynasty
in China, many, and those chiefly the most important, Chinese
works have been translated into Manchu. The Manchus have used writing for about two centuries and a half, their alphabet
having been developed from the Mongolian.
The Manchus gave their name to the whole of Manchuria, because the founder of the last Chinese dynasty called the
whole nation after his own tribe. Practically nothing is
known of the history of the Manchus prior to 1644, since
when it has been associated with that of China. For they are never mentioned in earlier Chinese history, which, however, refers to other Tungus tribes, some of which played a very
important part in the history of China. The earliest informa
tion which the Chinese give of what is now Manchuria dates from the eleventh century B.C. and relates to the powerful
tribe of the Suchiu (now ShucJii, Yuchiu, &c.) : they are described as having brought to the Chinese arrows made of the wood hu with tips of hard stone. After a long silence the same tribe is again mentioned in 263 after Christ, as having sent to the then ruling dynasty of China tribute consisting of bows, arrows, armour, and sable skins. Their country and institutions are described at some length. In the fifth centi^ry after Christ another tribe composed of several hordes called
Mu-Tcy (later also Mo-hho or Mo-ho) is mentioned as living in
Manchuria on the Sungari river, and some account of their
manner of life is given. In the same century the Chinese annals speak of a tribe called Chy-Goey inhabiting the northernmost parts of the
present Manchuria and consisting of a northern and southern
division. The former were a reindeer people, chiefly occupied
with hunting and fishing, who lived partly in subterranean
dwellings, partly in tents of bark. The southern section, who



CHARACTERISTICS, ETC. 97
spoke the same language as the Mo-ho, lived in a swampy, cold forest country, and kept horses, cattle, and many pigs.
To the southern Chy-Goey belonged a tribe called Khitan, who
were driven north by the Chinese and for a time acknowledged their supremacy. But in the sixth to the ninth centuries they rebelled against the Chinese. In 907 their chief
named Apaokhi founded the Khitan Empire, which embraced
the whole of Mongolia and Manchuria, extending from the
ocean in the east to Kashgar in the west. From time to time
northern China was subject to the Khitan dynasty till it was destroyed in 1125 by the Kin dynasty. The latter arose from the Tungus tribe of the Shuchi (mentioned above) on the ruins of the Khitan Empire. It reduced China to a tributary state
and lasted till 1235, when it was in turn destroyed by O'gotai,
the son and successor of Jenghiz Khan. From that time
onward the Tungus tribes were first subject to the supremacy
of the Mongols and then of the Chinese, till the Manchu dynasty came to the front in 1644. This line also derived its
origin from the wild Shuchi tribe. It gradually acquired such
power as to subjugate not only China proper, but also Mongolia, Manchuria, Tibet, Bokhara, Dzungaria, alnd other territories. Like all foreign hordes that have invaded and ruled
China, the Manchu dynasty has been completely absorbed by Chinese civilization. (n) The Goldi live in the north-east corner of Manchuria
along the Amur and its tributaries the Ussuri and the Sungari. Their neighbours on the north are the Sanagir and the Olcha, on the east the Oroch, on the west the Kile and the Manchus.
They number about 5,000. Two physical types have been distinguished among them. In the one the face is round or oval, with the well-known Mongol characteristics broad
cheek-bones, small oblique eyes, broad, low noses. In the other, the cheeks are wider, the eyes less oblique, the nose higher
and more arched, the lips thicker. Both types have black hair, scanty beard and moustache, bony and muscular frames.
They are described as timid, good-natured, and honest. They have acted as transmitters of Chinese culture to tribes beyond them.
By occupation they are chiefly fishermen, using as a rule small birch-bark canoes for one, but also larger boats. The}^ employ dogs to tow their boats up-stream. They also to some TURANIANS Gr



98 THE TUNGUS DIVISION
extent engage in hunting, but liave settled homes and are not nomads. They cultivate small - plots of land in which they
grow vegetables. They are good smiths and make beautiful
ornapaental spearheads. The women are skilled in needlework
and embroidery. In religion the Goldi are devoted to Shamanism. They
bury their Shamans, as well as other important people, in huts ; but the bodies of the poor are bestowed in wooden coffins which
are placed in trees out of the reach of wild beasts. As men are
in a majority there is no polygamy among them.
(o) The OrocJi live in the Eussian coast province, to the east
of the Ussuri and the lower Amur from de Castries Bay in the
north down to Amur Bay in the south. Their neighbours in
the north are the Olcha and in the west the Goldi. In the south they are much intermixed with Chinese. Their physical type has been modified by Chinese and Gilyak admixture. They are very short in stature. Their heads are proportionately big, while their extremities are small. Their faces are flat and almost square ; the forehead is low and somewhat receding ; the cheek-bones are prominent, the eyes small and slanting ; the nose is small and flat, the mouth large, and the lips thin. Their complexion is less dark and their hair less thick than that of the Ainu, while their beards are very scanty. Their hair is black or brown, and their eyebrows are
strongly marked. In spite of their name, which means ' reindeer-keepers', they
are now nomad hunters and fishers. The number of this tribe is stated to be 2,407.

CHAPTER V
THE MONGOL DIVISION
Habitat. The original home of the Mongol race is Mongolia,
which forms a geographical link between the habitat of the Southern Tungus on the east and that of the Turks on the west. It is separated from Siberia in the north by the Altai, the Sayan, and the Yablonai ranges ; from Manchuria in the east by the Khingan mountains ; from China and Tibet in the south-east
and south by the In Shan and Ala Shan ; from Turkestan in the
south-west by the northern frontier of Dzungaria ; and from Russian Central Asia in the west by no very definite natural
boundary. This territory lies roughly between lat. 40 to 50 N. and long. 90 to 120 E. About nine-tenths of its inhabitants
are pure Mongols. The whole Mongolian race at the present day lives within the boundaries of the Chinese and the Russian Empires, about three millions being subject to China and half a million to Russia. Main brancJies. There are three main branches : (1) the
Eastern Mongols, or Mongols proper, practically all in Mongolia ;
^ (2) the Buryats, in Siberia around Lake Baikal and in south Irkutsk ; and (3) the Kalmuks, partly in and around
Dzungaria (to the - west, north, and south-east), partly in
southern Russia, and between the Don and the Volga. These main tribes are further subdivided into a number of small hordes. Number. The total number of the Mongols may be estimated
at rather less than 3,500,000. The Eastern Mongols are by far
the most numerous, comprising probably 2,580,000. The
Buryats number 332,554,^ about two-thirds of them inhabiting the districts round Lake Baikal, the rest the south of Irkutsk. The West Mongols or Kalmuks total about 530,000, of whom
370,000 live in China, 110,000 in Southern Russia, and 50,000 in Siberia. Name. The origin of the name Mongol is obscure ; but Schott's derivation of it from mong^ 'brave', is commonly



CHARACTEEISTICS, ETOL: 101
accepted." In the tenth century they are first mentioned by
the Chinese under the name Mang-yu or Mang-yus, and by 1135
the Mongols are known by their present name as Mung-Tcu or
Mung-Jcus. But this name is very rare in 'Chinese chronicles.
Instead of it, Tata, which first appears in 880, is commoner.
From this time the expression Tata first appears in Chinese
history as a designation of wild hordes in the In Shan derived from the Mo-kho tribe. Henceforth the term received a wider
application and finally came to designate as ' Tatars ' the wild hordes not of the Mongol, but of the Turkish race.* Characteristics. The Mongol is somewhat below the middle
height ; he has a short neck and slender limbs. He is charac
terized by small black eyes, narrow straight eyebrows, promi
nent cheek-bones, broad flat nose, thick lips, short chin, and large protruding ears. His hair is black and coarse, and his
beard scanty. He is brachycephalic. Though his complexion
is brown, he shows colour in his cheeks. The east Mongolian is slender and strong, but the other two branches show a tendency to fatness.
The Mongols are by nature a lazy, phlegmatic people, not having the quickness, intelligence, and energy of the Tungus
and Manchus. They like a quiet, peaceful life : those of them that live within Chinese territory are satisfied with being
called the allies of China and being its actual vassals. But
that they have had the energy for great deeds is shown his
torically by the achievements of Jenghiz Khan and of Timur;'^ for they founded the greatest empire that the world has ever
seen, conquering nearly the whole of Asia and a great part of Europe. It is inconceivable that this should ever happen again. For the main body of this race, which inhabits Mongolia, are
now devoted adherents of Buddhism, by which religion they have been transformed from a very warlike into a peaceful and
unenterprising people.
Manner of Life. All the Mongolian tribes are nomads, whose
chief occupation is cattle-breeding accompanied by trade. Religion. Though originally Shamanists, the Mongols have
adopted the religions of the more civilized peoples by whom
they have been subdued: Buddhism from the Chinese,
Christianity from the Russians, and to a slight extent Islam
from the Tatars by whom they have, been Turkified in the
neighbourhood of the Altai range.



iO.2 THE MONGOL DIVISION
Language. The main Turanian language to which Mongolian
is most nearly allied is Turkish, the two having more than
half their roots in common. All the three main dialects of the
language (corresponding to the three racial divisions) are so closely related in roots, inflexions, and grammatical structure
that whoever understands one of them understands all. They
share the Turanian phonetic characteristic of ' harmony of
vowels ' by which all the vowels of the same word belong to
the same class, so that the nature of the first or root vowel determines the nature of the other or inflexional vowels.^
The vocabulary contains many Chinese, Turkish, and Tibetan words.
Writing. The Mongolian characters (used in a slightly
modified form by the Manchus also) form not an alphabet but a syllabarium, the unit of which is the syllable, that is, a consonant with its accompanying vowel. These characters are lineal descendants of the original Uigur forms which were
themselves derived from the Syriac (Aramaic) writing brought
to the Uigurs' by Nestorian missionaries. An Indian and Tibetan influence is noticeable in them. The arrangement in
perpendicular lines read downwards is due to Chinese, though the columns are read from left to right (the direction of the
Indian script). This writing was given its ultimate shape by
two learned Lamas in the thirteenth century. It is, however,
very imperfect owing to the ambiguity of certain of its
letters. History. The surest source of the earliest history of the
Mongols are the Chinese chronicles. These name the so-called
Hiung-nu as the first powerful people inhabiting the country
which is now Mongolia. De Guignes, the celebrated author of
the history of the Huns and Turks,^ as well as Klaproth,'^ Ritter,^^ and others, regard this people as Turks, while the Russian Hyakinth,^^ followed by Neumann,^^ take them to be
Mongols. The balance of evidence, however, seems to be in favour of the Turks, as some of the few known words of the
Hiung-nu language are of Turkish origin. De Guignes regards
the western Huns who invaded Europe under Attila in the
fifth century as a branch of the Hiung-nu people and conse
quently as Turks also.
From the history of the T*ang dynasty of China (a.d. 618-905) and later works it appears that the original camping grounds



HISTORY 103
of the Mongols were along the courses of the Kerulen, the upper Nonni, and the Argun rivers. But the origin of the race
is obscure and mythical. Thus the native Mongol historian Sanang Setsen (c. 1660) ^'' traces their descent from a blue
wolf. The Mongols did not begin to play any important part till the second half of the twelfth century, having before then
been mostly vassals of the Tungus dynasties of Khitan and
Kin. Then, however, they were collected by Jenghiz Khan to lay the foundation of his mighty empire. Their reputed ancestor Budantsar by craft and violence became the chief
of a tribe living in the neighbourhood of his mother's tent.
His descendants increased in power till the eighth in succession,
Jesukai, made his power felt over a large area. He threw off
the yoke of the White Tatas (the Turks), to whom his own tribe, the Black Tatas, had long been subject, and for the first time united all the Black Tatas to one people. Jesukai was
the father of Jenghiz Khan (1162-1227), who, born as the chief
of a petty Mongolian tribe, became one of the greatest
conquerors the world has ever seen. He called his own tribe ' Mongol ' or rather ' Koko '
(Black) Mongol as a distinction
from the White Tata (or Turk) tribes. In the course of his life he subjected the whole of Central Asia (including Man
churia, Mongolia, Turkestan), and after destroying Peking
conquered northern China. When in 1219 he started from
Karakorum, his capital in Mongolia, on his westward advance, his armies ravaged the north-west of India and penetrated
into southern Eussia. Thus when he died in 1227 he left an empire which extended from the China Sea as far as the banks
of the Dnieper. And though it dwindled under his incom
petent descendants and finally disappeared without a trace, a momentous result of his rule was the presence of the Turks in Europe ; for it was the advance of his armies that drove
the Osmanlis from their original home in northern Asia and
thus led to their invasion of Bithynia under Othman (died
1326) and finally their entry into Europe under Amurath I
(or Murad I, 1319-89). Jenghiz Khan's empire was divided in 1227 among his sons,
and his conquests were continued by his grandsons. Ogotai,
the second (and eldest surviving) son who had become chief Khan, died in 1241 and was succeeded by his son Kuyuk, who reigned only seven years. The latter showed favour to



104 THE MONGOL DIVISION
Christianity; for his two ministers as well as his physicians
were Christians, and a Christian chapel stood before his tent. Upon his death the lordship of the Mongols passed to the
house of Tuli (or Tului), the youngest son of Jenghiz Khan.
In 1251 Tuli's eldest son Mangu was elected chief Khan. He
practised perfect impartiality towards Christians and Moham
medans alike, though Shamanism was recognized as the state religion. In 1253 Mangu was visited by Eubruquis ^* and
other Christian monks. The former gives an account of the chief Khan's palace at Karakorum, contrasting greatly with
the nomad tent- life of his forefathers. Assisted by his brothers Hulagu and Kublai he considerably increased the Mongol
Empire. He himself conquered China, Tibet, and various territories bordering on India. Hulagu stormed Bagdad, de
stroyed the Khalifate there, and made the Seljuk sultans of
Iconium tributary. Hulagu was meditating the capture of
Jerusalem in order to restore it to the Christians, when he was recalled by the death of Mangu in 1260. Kublai was now elected Great Khan. By this time the Mongol Empire had attained a greater extent than any empire of the world either before or after, reaching from the Sea of China to the frontier of Poland, from the Himalayas to deep into Siberia. But this vast empire
was already developing the seeds of dissolution, which was accelerated by Kublai's transfer of the capital to China in 1280.
Even during his reign several sub-khans made themselves
independent and formed a number of kingdoms of which Turkestan, Persia, East and South Russia were the most power
ful. In China itself Mongol rule lasted under the name of the
Yuen dynasty till 1368, when China threw off the alien yoke,
the house of Jenghiz Khan being supplanted by the Ming
dynasty (1368-1644).
The Mongols then withdrew to the regions outside the
Great Wall, where they united in the land between the Amur
and the Selenga with their kinsmen who had remained behind.
At first the descendants of Jenghiz Khan ruled here, but soon the people divided into independent hordes with different names. In Persia Hulagu had founded in 1265 the dynasty of the
Il-khans, which lasted down to 1349. The Mongols here
completely adopted the language and customs of the country,



HISTOEY 105
the Sultans embracing Islam and even introducing the ArabPersian constitution. In the land north of the Caspian between the Yaik (Ural)
and the Volga, the grandsons of Jenghiz Khan, Orda and
Batu, had founded an empire which extended to the Dnieper,
but which soon dissolved into several small Khanates. These
were gradually all subjected by the Eussians.
Their original nomad jnode of life, as well as their Shaman
istic religion, was most faithfully preserved by the Mongols of Transoxiana, where Jenghiz Khan's son Jagatai had founded
in 1227 a kingdom which extended from the Jihoun (Oxus) to the Irtish. In this region arose that second great conqueror
Timur (' iron ') Lenk (' lame '), corrupted to ' Tamerlane '
(1333
1405), who united the power of the Mongols and Turks, and
led them to new conquests. He was born at Samarkand,
which became his capital. He first subjected Persia, then Georgia; in 1394 he penetrated to Moscow, overthrew by degrees all the kingdoms of Central Asia, and in 1398 con
quered India from the Indus to the mouth of the Ganges.
In 1401 he destroyed Bagdad, then invaded Asia Minor, and
in 1402 defeated the Osman Turks at Angora with his numerically far superior Mongol army. After his death in 1404 the dissensions among his relatives in regard to the succession
soon led to a complete dissolution of the empire. Only in
Jagatai have the dynasties of Jenghiz Khan and Timur sur
vived down to the present under foreign sovereignty. It was from here that Babar ('the lion'), fifth in descent
from Timur and born in 1483 in Ferghana, founded the new
Mongolian Empire in India, that of the Great Moguls (that is, Mongols) by defeating the Sultan of Delhi at the battle of Panipat in 1526. This conquest of India was in no real sense a Mongolian achievement. For Babar's invading army, which* consisted of only 12,000 miscellaneous adventurers from Central
Asia, probably contained hardly any actual Mongols. The dynasty itself was Turkish as descended from Timur, Mongol only in the sense that it arose in the kingdom founded by the
Mongol Jagatai, Jenghiz Khan's son, in Transoxiana. The Mogul Empire in India came to an end in 1858.
With this quite nominal exception the whole Mongol race
has for centuries been subject to other powers, predominantly the Chinese and the Eussian Empires. Certain small sections



106 THE MONGOL DIVISION
of tlieiu were subdued by or merged in the Persians and Turks.
The Mongols were a brave and hardy people, but they never
showed themselves capable of consolidating the fruits of
victory, of forming a settled type of government, or of gaining the allegiance of conquered peoples. The part they played in
the history of the world was transitory, for it virtually came
to an end after a century and a half. Their activity during
this period was mainly destructive, showing no sign of inde
pendent constructive political ability. On the contrary they
have tended more and more" to assimilate themselves to the superior civilizations with which they came in contact those
of the Chinese, the Eussians, and the Persians. Thus in the thirteenth century they adopted Buddhism from the Chinese in the east, and later Christianity from the Russians in the west. AVhen in touch with their kinsmen, the Turks, they
for the most part adopted Islam, which they exchanged, like the latter, for their primitive Shamanism. Under these influences they have on the whole become a peaceful, timid,
indolent people, steadily losing their racial individuality. It is therefore not in the least likely that they will ever again lead or even join in a career of conquest as they did in the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Branches. The whole Mongolian race may be divided into
three branches speaking the three main dialects corresponding
to them : (i) The Eastern Mongols, (ii) The Buryats, (iii) The Kalmuks.
i. The Eastern Mongols
Habitat. The Eastern Mongols, or Mongols proper, inhabit their original home, Mongolia, which the Chinese divide into Outer and Inner Mongolia. Outer Mongolia, which is conterminous on the north and west with Russian territory, is the
habitat of the Khalkas, who extend from the north-eastern end of the desert of Gobi to the borders of Russian Siberia. The Khalka people are divided into four great tribes.
The Urianghai territory, which covers an area of about 52,000 square miles in the extreme north-west of Mongolia south of
the Sayan range, is inhabited by five main tribes, estimated to
number about 100,000, which are now virtually Mongols, but in origin are probably akin to the Samoyed Soyotes of Siberia
(p. 83). ^^



THE EASTEEN MONGOLS 107
Inner Mongolia, which is divided from Outer Mongolia by
the desert of Gobi and borders on China Proper and Manchuria along the whole of the north-eastern and eastern frontier, is
inhabited by twenty-four tribes, which, from the military divisions in which they are grouped, are known as the Mongols of
the Forty-nine Banners. Besides these there are what the Chinese call the 'Herdsmen tribes ', especially the Chakhar tribe, which inhabit the territory in immediate proximity to the Great Wall. Number. The total estimated number of the Mongols proper
has already been stated to be 2,580,000 (p. 100). But no approximate trustworthy estimate of each of the main tribes taken separately seems to be obtainable. Cliaracteristics, Besides the racial and mental characteris
tics of the Mongols in general already mentioned (p. 101), the people of the eastern branch are described as inquisitive, frank, good-natured, and acute in practical matters. It is to be noted that they have never intermarried with the ruling Chinese race, even in the districts bordering on China. The hold that
the Lamaistic Buddhism of Tibet has on the Eastern Mongols is indicated by the fact that the country is covered with
lamaserais. It is estimated that the Lamas constitute five
eighths of the population. Mode of Life. They are genuine nomads, living in tents. Only princes, officials, and soldiers on service live in houses. Their dwellings consist of round huts (yurtas) on wooden frameworks covered with felt. In the middle is the hearth, on which only dung is burnt. Opposite the door is the domestic altar. Carpets or felt cloths are used for sleeping or sitting on. The clothes of both sexes are sim'ilar and consisted originally of materials derived from cattle and other animals.
But horse -hide and felt garments are being gradually replaced by Chinese jackets and cloths. High caps of sheepskin . are everywhere usual. The head is shaved, only a large plait
being left hanging down the back. The beard is shaved or
plucked out. Women wear plaits adorned with corals, ribbons,
and beads, and allowed to hang down over the breast. The food of the Mongols is chiefly derived from the products of
the cattle they rear. A favourite article is also brick tea pre
pared with meal, salt, butter, and milk. From milk, butter
and cheese are made, and Jcumiss distilled. Brandy is much



108 THE MONGOL DIVISION
drunk, but water not at all. Opium smoking is very general.
The Mongols are very dirty in their habits, and bathing is un
known among them, as among the Chinese and the Kalmuks.
Occupations. The principal occupation of the Mongols is cattle-breeding. It is estimated that each family has on the
average 50 sheep, 25 horses, 15 horned cattle, and 10 camels. Among their domestic animals goats are included. Their sheep are of the fat-tailed breed. Their cattle are also trained
for both carrying and riding. The Mongols engage largely in the transport of goods. It is calculated that 100,000 camels are used for the transport of tea only from Kalgan to Siberia ;
and that no fewer than 1,200,000 camels and 300,000 ox-carts are employed in the internal caravan trade. The eastern
Mongols also to some extent engage in hunting. Agriculture is only practised sporadically, chieily in the south, where the Mongols have been taught by the Chinese. Various domestic industries are also carried on by them.
Literature. The literature of the Mongols is chieily religious,
consisting mostly in translations from Tibetan and Chinese. Their printed books are few. One of the most noteworthy of
these is the History of the Eastern Mongols,^'' by the Mongol chief Sanang Setsen, dating from about 1660.
ii. The Buryats Habitat. The Buryats extend from the Chinese frontier in the south as far as lat. 55 on both sides of Lake Baikal, and from the Onon in the east to beyond the Oka in the west towards the town of Nizhni Udinsk. They thus live nearly all
round Lake Baikal. Eleven sub-tribes have been distinguished among them four to the west, and seven to the east of the
lake. The Buryats are most numerous on the east side, in the
valleys along the Uda and the Onon, and in the neighbourhood of Nerchinsk. These Trans-Baikal Buryats came to their
present home only towards the end of the seventeenth century from the territory of the Khalkas in northern Mongolia. They appear to be increasing in numbers.^^'
The Buryats round Selinginsk, who claim Jenghiz Khan as their ancestor, moved northward in the thirteenth century, when they arrived on the upper Amur. Thence they migrated westwards to Lake Baikal. Characteristics. The Buryats physically resemble the



THE BUEYATS 109
Kalmuks. They are broad-shouldered and inclined to be
stout. They have large heads, square faces, small slanting eyes, high cheek-bones far apart, broad flat noses, low fore
heads, thick lips, swarthy and yellow complexions, jet-black
hair, and scanty beards. They keep their hair cropped very
close except on the crown, where it is made to grow in a long
queue hanging down behind. They are an intellectual, but a phlegmatic and easy-going
people, lacking enterprise, but showing some energy when they engage in agriculture.
Mode of Life, The dwellings, or yurtas, of the Buryats are not erected in rows, but are scattered about and are surrounded by large enclosures. At some distance there are huge enclosed
spaces where cattle graze in winter, and large crops of hay are
stored in summer. The Buryats are so fond of their manner
of living in their yurtas that when they inhabit houses they
make a hole in the roof and keep a fire burning in the centre
of the floor. In the north they use wood for fuel, but in the
south camel's dung. In summer they dress in silk or cotton, but in winter in fur and sheepskin. As food they chiefly eat mutton. They drink- brick tea, blending it with rye meal,
mutton fat, and salt. They are also fond of drinking intoxi
cating liquor and of smoking tobacco. Customs. Marriages are generally arranged by two families exchanging daughters. But if there are only sons, a Jcalim, or bridal price, consisting of cattle has to be pajd for the bride, who, however, receives a dowry which counterbalances the Jcalim. The Buryats used to burn their dead till it was forbidden by the Russian Grovernment. Nevertheless they still sometimes cremate the bodies of Shamans before depositing the remains in the trunks of trees. At Buryat burials a horse is sacrificed.
Occupations. The Buryats are a nomad people occupied with
horse and cattle breeding, hunting and fishing. A good many
of them, under Russian influence, also cultivate rye and wheat. They are adepts at silversmith work, which is noted throughout
Siberia as ' Bratsky work '
(Bratsky, ' brother \ being the
Russian name for the Buryats). They are also skilled in
producing leather work and textile fabrics. Government. The Buryats are under a special Russian
steppe government. But their own elders, the Taishas, still



no THE MONGOL DIVISION
exercise great influence among them. Several clans form
a commune, at the head of which is a chief Taisha.
Religion, The Buryats have, nominally at least, adopted either Christianity or Buddhism. Those in the north, follow a form of ordinary Buddhism, while those in the east are
Lamaists. Among them the Lamas, who form a large portion
of the population towards the Chinese frontier, are greatly revered. They lead ascetic lives, refrain from spirits and
tobacco, avoid taking animal life, and are celibate. Like the Tibetans they use praying machines. The western Buryats
are Christians. But Shamanism has by no means been destroyed among them. It has annexed the crucifix as a symbol for its rites, but shows few signs of otherwise falling under the influence of the cross.
Language. The Buryat dialect ^" is closely akin to the East
Mongolian. The phonetic differences between them are slight^
Thus the Mongolian ^.s- appears in Buryat as ss ; e.g. tsalc ' time ' in the former is ssah in the latter. The relation of the Buryat
language to that of the Kalmuks is similar. Three sub-dialects
can be distinguished in Buryat. The Buryats have some books of their own. For writing
they use Mongolian characters, which, as has been pointed out, are defective in various respects (p. 102).
iii. The Kalmuks
Habitat The Kalmuks form the western branch of the
Mongol race, living partly in Asia and partly in Europe.
The Asiatic Kalmuks are found mainly in Chinese territory :
in Kobdo and Dzungaria, in East Turkestan, in the eastern portion of the T'ien Shan, on the southern border of the Gobi desert, on the Koko-nor range, and in the province of Kansu. Several hordes are also under Eussian sway. They are thus
now found in the territory of Semiryechensk (near Kulja), and
in the southern part of the government of Tomsk on the Altai.
Widely separated from these are the European Kalmuks who
inhabit the banks of the Volga around Astrakhan and Stavropol towards Saratov, and nomadize on the steppe between the Volga and the Ural. Number. The total number of the Kalmuks is estimated at 530,000, of whom 370,000 live in Chinese territory and 160,000 in the Russian Empire.^ ^ In the steppe of the Kalmuks, which



THE KALMUKS HI
extends between the Caspian and the Volga in the east and the
Don in the west, and from the town of Sarepta in the north to
the Kuma and the Manich in the south, the Kalmuk population amounts to 76,000 ; to these are to be added 25,000 more on the borders of the Don Cossacks ; and lastly 8,000 in the
adjoining provinces- of Orenburg and Saratov; making alto
gether 109,000 in European Eussia. The remaining 50,000 or so are in Asiatic Russia. Name. The name ' Kalmuk ' is used only by the Volga
Mongols in the form of Khalimak, and even among them is
not common as a designation of themselves, but is rather
applied to them by the Tatars (Turks). The Kalmuks on the
Altai are also called Black ^^ or mountain Kalmuks as distinguished from the Turkified white Kalmuks (or Teleuts) of the Government of Tomsk. Kalmuk is probably a Tatar word, but it is as yet unexplained. The Tatars also call them Olot
(Eleuts), while the Eastern Mongols designate them Ogeled.
The favourite name among the Kalmuks themselves is ' Mongol
Girad ' or ' Mongol related tribe '. The ' Dorbon Oirad ' or
' Four related Tribes ', of which the Kalmuks have consisted
from ancient times, are the Dzungars in Dzungaria, the Torgod2<^ in Kobdo, the Koshod,^^ and the Dorbot (Dorbot). Characteristics. The physique of the Kalmuks completely coincides with that of the eastern Mongolians, with wh9se manners and customs theirs are also closely allied.
Occupations. The Kalmuks are nomads, chiefly occupied with cattle-breeding. Their trade consists in bartering cattle
for corn, woollen clothing, cooking utensils, and other requirements. Goveriiment. Among the Chinese ancj Siberian Kalmuks
the administration is in the hands of their tribal chiefs. The Russian Kalmuks have as their chief a Lama who is appointed
by the Russian Government and who lives in Bazar Kalmuk
on the Volga near Astrakhan. As regards education the
Russian Government has done much for the Kalmuks in recent times.
Religion. The Kalmuks in Chinese territory are mostly Lamaist Buddhists. In Siberia they have here and there
adopted Christianity. Some, again, have taken Islam from
the Tatars with whom they have been in contact. Thus in
1904 a 'prophet' among the ^Kalmuks of the Altai region



112 THE MONGOL DIVISION
caused a ferment which led to the assassination of the Russian district administrator.
Language. The language of the Kalmuks differs only slightly from that of the Eastern Mongols. The dialectic difference very
frequently lies only in a divergent pronunciation of certain
sounds. Thus East Mongolian ds appears in Kalmuk as a soft
s (=z). The characteristic Turanian vowel harmony has in
Kalmuk reversed its direction, the vowels of the endings influencing those of the roots instead of vice versa.
Writing. The characters of the Kalmuk script are an extended and improved variety of those of the Eastern Mongols. They were devised in 1648 on the basis of the latter. They
have a rounded appearance as compared with the Mongolian
letters. New signs were added so that each sound of the language has its distinct graphic character. Hence no letter
is ambiguous or liable to be mistaken for another. The
Kalmuk writing is therefore the key to the other Mongolian dialects, which it enables the reader to understand easily.
The Kalmuk orthography is phonetic, while the Mongolian is historical. Thus in the spoken language a g between vowels
is dropped, the vowels then contracting; e.g. khan (originally Jchagan) is pronounced in both dialects, while Jchdn is written
in Kalmuk, but Ichagan in Mongolian ; similarly Kalmuk nor ' lake ', Mongol nagor, but both pronounced 7idr.
Literature. The Kalmuks have, in addition to written laws, a literature consisting mostly of poetry and historical traditions mingled with sagas ; an heroic epic poem,^^ and a collection
of fairy tales.^^
History. Nothing is known of the early history of the
Kalmuks ; but from the beginning of the seventeenth century
we begin to obtain information about their migrations and other political events. Before 1600 there were probably no
Kalmuks west of the Altai. From their original seats in Dzungaria parts of the ' Four related Tribes ' turned in their
migrations to the north, first to the Altai, then westward across the steppe of the Kirghiz to the head waters of the Tobol, and
gradually reached the Emba and the Or. Between these two rivers and the Ural the Torgod settled in 1616. Thence they
crossed the Volga in 1650 and took possession of the now so-called steppe of the Kalmuks. They were followed in 1672
by the Dorbot, and in 1675 by the Koshod. Meanwhile a



THE KALMUKS 113
chief named Galdan, who became famous in Central Asia, founded in 1671 a kingdom of short duration by subjecting
all the Olot (Kalmuk) tribes, the Telenget and the Kirghiz,
and expelling from their home the Khalka Mongols, who
migrated to the neighbourhood of their kinsmen the Buryats on Lake Baikal. Galdan in 1696 was defeated by a nephew,
who with the help of the Chinese put himself at the head of
the Dzungar Kalmuks and founded the Dzungarian Kingdom
at Hi. This kingdom, however, only lasted till 1757, when it
was destroyed by the Chinese. Those of the Kalmuks who had remained behind in the seventeenth century resolved in 1703
to escape from the persecutions of the Dzungarian king, and
settled down in E,ussia between the Yaik (Ural) and Volga.
Some 40,000 Koshod, Dorbot, and Dzungars in 1759 fled before the Chinese conquerors of Dzungaria to the Volga. After the Torgod, at the invitation of the Chinese Emperor, had in 1771
returned to Hi, a large part of the other Kalmuk tribes, dissatisfied with Russian rule, returned amid great danger
and privations to China. Out of 169,000 about 100,000 are said to have perished. Those who remained in Russia have
since the end of the eighteenth century lived peacefully as nomads on the steppe between Volga and Ural. Besides the
Kalmuks some Buryats returned to Chinese territory, which
hereby gained a large accession of population. Since then the Kalmuks, like the Mongols, have lived as peaceful subjects of the Chinese Empire.

CHAPTER VI
THE TURKISH DIVISION
Habitat. The Turks inhabit an area which in geographical
extent and variety of climate and soil is equalled by the home
of no other people. The territory occupied by them forms an almost continuous band across Asia into eastern Europe, between the extreme limits of long. 150 E. in the east to long. 25 E. in the west, and of lat. 35 N. in the south to lat. 55 N. in the north, reaching at one point in the north-east as far as lat. 75 N. This Turkish territory is bounded in the south by Tibet, Afghanistan, Persia, and Arabia ; in the north by Liberia and northern Russia ; in the east by Mongolia ; and in the west by the Don, the Black Sea, and the eastern Mediterranean. Starting from their original home, the Altai Mountains, they have overspread to the north-east and the west a vast area,
limited chiefly to Asia, but also reaching in Europe as far west as the Crimea and the south-eastern corner of the Balkan
peninsula. Their rule, based on the conquest of alien populations, still nominally includes Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine,
and Northern Arabia, and formerly extended temporarily to Persiu, Afghanistan, and India ; in Africa to Algiers (till 1830) and Egypt (till 1914) ; in Europe to the whole Balkan peninsula, and (till 1600) even to the plains of Hungary. Turlis and Mongols, Though ethnographically the Turks
are not easy to differentiate in physique and customs from the
Mongols, there is at the present day no difficulty in distinguishing between Turks and Mongols. The former speak Turkish
dialects, are Moslems by religion, live almost entirely in the
western half of Asia, and fall within the Arabic and, to some
extent, the European sphere of influence ; the latter speak Mongolian languages, are Buddhists by religion, live in the eastern half of Asia, and fall within the sphere of Chinese influence. The difficulty of ethnographical demarcation be
tween these two racial divisions is partly due to the physical
h2



116 THE TURKISH DIVISION
affinity of the Turks to the Mongols being closer than to any
other branch of the Turanians, and partly to the former fluid condition of the tribes of the different Turanian divisions in Central Asia. Hordes belonging to one branch when engaged
in raids were often joined by hordes belonging to another.
Thus the Mongolian hordes of the conqueror Jenghiz Khan
(1162-1227) were joined by contingents of Turks, who were probably far more numerous than the Mongols themselves ; for the chief traces left in Europe of the Mongol invasion consist in the Turkish-speaking Tatars^ in Russia ; and the
name of Jenghiz Khan's son Jagatai is commonly applied to
a Turkish dialect and Khanate in the region of the Oxus. It
was also the Turks who, set in motion by the Mongol inva
sions, were responsible for the introduction of Mohamme
danism into Europe, as well as largely responsible for the
introduction of Mohammedanism into India. Number. Nearly one-half of the Turkish race inhabits
Russian territory, more than one-third the Ottoman Empire,
and the rest (more than one-seventh) parts of China, Persia, and Afghanistan. In Russian territory there are over
12,500,000, under 4,500,000 of these being in Europe. In Turkey there are 1,891,000 on European'^ and about 8,000,000=^
on Asiatic soil, making altogether less than 10,000,000. In Chinese Turkestan there are about 1,000,000 Turks, scattered about in Persia about 2,000,000, and in the north of Afghanistan about 500,000, the total of Turks in these three countries being thus about 3,500,000. The aggregate number of all the Turks in the world is therefore about 26,000,000.* These figures may be expressed as follows in a tabulated form : The Turkish People

MEANING OF THE NAME 'TURK' 117
Name. The term Turk is now primarily applied to the Osmanli branch of the race which conquered Constantinople
(in 1453) and the regions known as Turkey. The word is
probably derived from Tu-Mu (T'u-chueh), the name of a new tribe mentioned by the Chinese as appearing in High Asia in
the sixth century, after the empire of the Hiung-nu had been
destroyed. ' Tu-kiu ' is first used by the Chinese in recording
the events of a. d. 545 and the following years. The ethnic
designation TovpKoi (Turks) first occurs among the Byzantines, in particular in the account^ given by Zemarchos of his journey
in A.D. 568 as ambassador sent by the Emperor Justin II from
Constantinople to a Turkish chief in the Altai mountains. To
the Arabs the name first became known on missionary journeys and during their conquest of Transoxiana (c. 650). The first
Turkish source (written in Turkish) in which the name Turk
appears is the Kudatku Bilik (a.d. 1070). The Turkish-speak
ing tribes of Eussia, who are mostly Moslems and of Turkish
origin, go by the name of Tatars,^ a term which not only was
and is unknown to the Turks proper as an ethnic designation, but is regarded as an insult if applied to them.^ It was intro
duced into Europe by the Russians, who at the time of Jen
ghiz Khan gave this name to the Mongols and Turks as
a whole, because the vanguard of his army, when.it appeared, consisted of the tribe called Tatar. In the Middle Ages it was
used as synonymous with ' barbarian '.^ The term ' TurcoTatar ' is generally used by scholars to designate non-Russian Turks. In order to avoid confusion it is preferable to employ
the general name Turk with a local or dynastic qualification where necessary, as is done here : Siberian Turks, Volga Turks, Seljuk Turks, and so on. Language. The Turkish languages are remarkably uniform. Allowing for the lapse of time and the importation of foreign words, it is hardly an exaggeration to say that from the Lena
to Constantinople, from the old Turkish (Uigur) inscriptions of
the eighth century down to the present time, we have merely
one language in different dialects. The native vocabulary' and grammar remains substantially the same in all of them.
Writing. The resemblance between Turkish dialects is increased by the fact that they are nearly all written in a
somewhat artificial and standardized form. For the Arabic
characters, though extremely ill-suited to represent Turkish



118 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
sounds, are everywhere used by Mohammedan Turks. Hence pure Turkish words written in Arabic letters are often hardly
intelligible even to Turks. Turkish-speaking Armenians and
Greeks often write in their own alphabets. Turkish newspapers printed in Armenian characters are published in Con
stantinople, and Greek characters are similarly employed in several parts of Asia Minor. In the Middle Ages the Uigurs and eastern Turks used a short alphabet of fourteen letters borrowed from a Syriac source, and probably introduced among them by Nestorian
missionaries.^^ The most interesting forms of Turkish writing are represented by the inscriptions found in Siberia near the Yenisei and Orkhon rivers, first discovered in 1722. Still more important are the inscriptions discovered in 1889 in Mongolia, south of Lake Baikal, one of them in Turkish and Chinese dating from a. d. 733, and another dating from 800 to 805. The script is derived from the Aramaic alphabet.
Ethnic affinities and types. Ethnically the Turks are closely akin to the Ugrians ; but their affinity to the Mongols is still
greater, both physically and linguistically. Thus the Mongolian language has, besides identity of many forms, more than
half its vocabulary in common with Turkish. Owing to this intimate kinship and to the admixture of foreign blood during
centuries of migration, it is no easy matter to set up a general but distinctive Turkish racial type. The predominant characteristics of the Turkish physique may, however, be said to be
the following: a short, thick-set body, with broad, strong bones, a large brachycephalic head, small slanting eyes, low forehead, flat nose, broad chin, scanty beard, black or brown hair, dark (almost yellow) complexion. These are the characteristics of
the Kazak-Kirghiz, whom Vamb^ry^^ considers to be the best
representatives of the proper Turkish type, since they are still
found in their old home, have not been much drawn into the stream of world-historic events, and so have maintained the primitive Turkish mode of life more faithfully than their other
kinsmen. This Kazak-Kirghiz type, if emphasized, would coincide with the Mongolian type, which there is good reason
to believe most nearly represents the proto-Turanians before they separated into their five main branches.
Religion. Shamanism, the original religion of the Turks, has survived, almost alone among the Turks of Siberia, of



TURKISH EELIGION 119
whom, to the number of over 300,000, this is the real faith. But even these are mostly nominal Christians. There are also about 30,000 Christians among the Volga Turks. Otherwise
practically the whole Turkish race are followers of Islam, which they adopted in the first few centuries after the rise of that religion. More or less distinct traces of their ancient faith, however, survive in all their tribes. Of what their original religion was like in early times we have some evidence from Turkish archaeology and ancient inscriptions, as well as from old Arabic, Byzantine, and Chinese writers. Thus, images have been found in Turkish graves buried with the body, as well as carvings of animals sacrificed for the funeral feast. The Arabic writer Abulghazi tells of
a custom from the heathen period- of the Turks : on the death
of a beloved member of the family, a kind of doll or image was made, kept for a long time in the house,^^ offered food, care
fally cleaned, and finally prayed to. Theophanes (6th cent.), in liis detailed account of the embassy sent in the sixth century by
the Byzantine Emperor Justin II to Mokan Khan in the Altai,
tells how it was received on arrival in Sogdiana by men who
warded off misfortune by means of bells and drums : Shamans are here doubtless meant.^^ The Chinese, in describing the
religion of the Turks, state that they worshipped fire, air,
water, earth, and that they had a god whom they revered
as Creator of the world and to whom they sacrificed horses,
cattle, and sheep. At the beginning of the yes^r they assem
bled at the capital of the Khan in the Altai in order to offer these sacrifices to the Creator in a valley in which their ancestors had lived. In the fifth month they assembled again and
sacrificed to the other gods, to heaven, earth, air, water, fire, and to the spirits of their ancestors ; while in the autumn they
made offerings to the tutelary deities of the soil, the fields, and
the meadows.^^ A branch of the Turks giving an account of itself in the early part of the eighth century mentions heaven
or Tangri ^^ as its chief deity, and its worship of spirits of the earth and waters. It is probable that before they adopted Islam the Turks also
practised Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, and Nestorian Christianity
in a desultory way in Turkestan. Thus we know from the
archaeological discoveries, during the last twenty years, of
Dr. Sven Hedin, Sir Aurel Stein, Dr. von Le Coq, and other



120 THE TURKISH DIVISION
scholars near Khotan, Turfan, and other localities in the same
region, as well as from the travels of the Chinese pilgrims who visited India by way of Central Asia between a.d. 400 and 700,
that Buddhism flourished in East Turkestan from about the
beginning of our era down to about a.d. 800. We are further
told by one of these pilgrims, Hsiian Tsang, who was enter
tained by the Khan of the Western Turks near Tokmak
c. A. D. 630, that the Turks here were fire-worshippers, and would not sit on wooden seats. The evidence of MSS. discovered by the above-named explorers during their excavations shows that there were followers of Nestorian Christianity and even of Manichaeanism in East Turkestan during the fifth and seventh centuries. Character and Cwilization. The Turks are imitative rather than original. In all their branches they have to some extent assimilated the nearest civilization with which they came in contact. Thus the only culture which they possessed up to the seventh century of our era consisted in scraps of Chinese and Indian civilization. Later, the eastern and western states founded by them adopted Perso- Arabic civilization along with
Mohammedanism. The Osmanlis have in addition absorbed the Byzantine and the West European influences to which
they have been subjected. The Turk, apart from the effect of
foreign civilizations, has uniformly been described in earlier times by Chinese, Persians, Byzantines, and Arabs as by
nature savage, untameable, faithless, heartless, rapacious, and work-shy. The verdict of modern times endorses this judgement. The course of history shows that no other race has
brought such devastations and massacres, such lasting derange
ments, into the life of other nations. The Turk has, more
over, displayed no power of developing his own civilization, which has consequently remained far behind that of both the Iranians and the Semites. Nor has the Turk ever exhibited any political capacity ; for he has only succeeded in establishing one single State of any permanence, and that State has
been a glaring example of incorrigible misgovernment. Thus
he has come to be regarded as the personified opponent of modern civilization, the arch-enemy of Europe, from which he should be expelled at all costs ; and the watchword of both past and present has been 'Down with the Turk '. The fundamental cause of the secular conflict between Turk



TUEKISH CHAEACTER AND CIVILIZATION 121
and Aryan has been the former's love of wandering and the
accompanying love of war, which has been more developed in
him than in the nomads of any other race. But the complete
failure of the Turk has been due to the combination of two unfortunate circumstances. In the first place, the cultivable soil of the ancient world had already been appropriated by the
Chinese, the Aryans, and the Semites. For the Turk, when he came on the scene, there were only left the barren steppes of Central Asia, on which he could maintain his herds and
flocks only by constantly shifting his dwelling-place. Such
conditions naturally led to attacks and raids on the more
prosperous settled peoples in the neighbourhood, and the struggle thus begun has lasted for thousands of years. In the second place, an unfortunate fate brought the Turks, at the time of their intensive activity, into contact with Islam, which confirmed them in many of the dangerous aspects of
Asiatic modes of life and thought, while they lost many of the
good sides of their previous civilization. They early became
the sword of Islam, and from the Crusades onwards down to the battle of Plevna and the recent Balkan wars, to the massacres of Armenians and the persecutions of the Syrians in the present war, it has been the Turks in most cases, whether
in Europe, Asia, or Africa, who have appeared as the champions
of the teaching of Mohammed and of the Asiatic world-view. They have been subdued by Eussia throughout Siberia and
Central Asia, and have lost nearly all their independent territory in Europe. In the present war they have further been deprived of a considerable area in Asia, and in Africa of the sovereignty over Egypt. It remains to be seen whether the
political existence of the only remaining independent section of a race that for thousands of years has exercised a gigantic influence on the fortunes of Asia and Europe will survive. If it falls a remarkable drama in the history of the world will have come to an end. The Turks may be able to save themselves by combining the national Turkish elements into a single
homogeneous State. In that case they might either enter the circle of cultured nations on a peaceful basis ; or, if organized
according to the Prussian gospel of force, they might become a more permanently disturbing element in the world than
they have been in their unorganized past. Migrations. Linguistic and ethnic evidence, corroborated



122 THE TURKISH DIVISION
by the geographical distribution of the Turanians, make it
probable that the Finno-Ugrian branch had long ago started
on their north-westward migration to Europe at a time when the Turks were still in the steppe region of the Altai, in immediate proximity to their nearest kin, the Mongols, lead
ing beside them their primitive nomad life. Archaeological evidence indicates that the westward extension of the Turkish
people began from the Altai and Sayan mountains, where to this very day lies the boundary between the Turks and the Mongols, and that it reached from there to the northern coast of the Black Sea in very early times. The images found in the graves near the Sea of Azov show an unmistakably
Turkish type : large head, flat nose, small slanting eyes, and beardlessness just the portrait that Jordanes gives of Attila.
The degree of civilization, as revealed by antiquities, differed but little in those early days among the Turks from that which the Russians found in Southern Siberia a few centuries ago.^^'
We have, however, no positive evidence as to the period when the Turks separated from the Mongols. It is not till the fifth century after Christ that Turkish movements into Europe become historical. There have been two lines of Turkish westward migration,
both starting from a common centre, but diverging to the north and the south. The northern movement extended from
the Altai to the Volga, its general direction being represented
by the Trans-Siberian Railway. A comparatively small section of the Turks followed this line. Starting from their original
home in the steppe country, about the upper courses of the
Yenisei, the Ob, and the Irtish, in a north-westerly direction, they crossed the Tobol, and spread westward as far as the
gradual withdrawal of the Finno-Ugrians permitted. They probably did not reach, at least in appreciable numbers, beyond the Volga, because their farther advance on the middle course of that stream was stopped by various Ugrian tribes such as the Mordvins, as well as by the Slavs.
The southern migration, comprising the great bulk of the
Turks, moved partly eastward after crossing the T'ien Shan, partly westward, long before historic times.
To the south-eastern movement belonged the Uigurs, whom Chinese chronicles alread}'' mention in 400 b.c. as living west of Lop-nor, and who must early have moved from the Upper



MIGEATIONS OF THE TUEKS 123
Irtish across tlie T'ien Shan, and by the Urumchi of to-day towards the desert of Lop, but without taking possession of
its southern margin, which was occupied by an Aryan colony.^'
Nor did the eastern boundary of the Turks extend beyon^ the
Kumul or Hami of to-day. But all the farther did the main
stream move towards the west. It must have been Turkish hordes which, advancing across the ancient Sogdiana, attacked
and destroyed the empire founded by Alexander the Great,
and during the period of the Sassanids nomadized on the eastern frontier of Iran. It could only have been Turks who, in the heroic legends of Iran, are described as naked foes resembling monsters that lived to the north of this land. Extending from the T'ien Shan to Asia Minor, the south-western
line was much longer than the north-western. The single units
Kazaks, Uzbegs, Turkmens, Osmanlis, and others, of which
it consists like a chain are also much more compact. They
all speak the same group of dialects, and have always been in
close touch with one another. But their movement was much slower than that of the north-western line, because it was first
checked by Iran, Eome, and Armenia, and later by Eussia,
Byzantium, and Hungary. The north-western line of migra
tion, on the other hand, was both much shorter and found less
resistance in the Slavs and Ugrians, with the latter of whom
they, to a considerable extent, even amalgamated.^^ It is somewhat remarkable that these two migrations were brought to a standstill at their extreme ends by Ugrian peoples, another branch of the Turanian race which had preceded the Turks on their westward wandering. The fragments of Turkish peoples left behind by the Mongolian
irruption, such as the Nogaians, constituted a chain connecting the extremities of the northern and the southern migrations of the Turks. History. Our chief sources for the early history of the Turks
are Chinese Annals and the works of the Arabic Mohammedan authors Eashid-ed-din, Abulghazi, and several others. The account given by the latter of the origin of the Turks is
obviously fabulous. In the mythical genealogy with which they begin, Turk, as one of the eight sons of Japhet, is here stated to have settled in the region of Lake Issik-kul and of
the river Ili.^'^ One of his descendants had twin sons, of whom the one was called Tatar, the other Mongol. The implication



124 THE TURKISH DIVISION
of close kinship in the latter statement at any rate confirms the conclusion otherwise arrived at as to the intimate relationship of the Turkish and the Mongolian divisions of the Turanian
family.
Early Chinese sources, especially about 200 b. c, make
mention of warlike nomads called Hiung-nu, who were a danger to the Empire. They seem to have wandered on the north and north-west frontiers of China, chiefly in the
region of the In Shan range, whence they made frequent
raids into Chinese territory. As a protection against their attacks, the Chinese built their great wall. According to a Chinese annalist of the first century b. c, the Hiung-nu were an extremely savage and warlike people. Their whole education consisted in training for war, which was their chief
occupation. They were a nation of horsemen, who at the
same time were hunters and cattle-breeders. Grazing their
horses, asses, camels, cows, and sheep along fertile rivers, they wandered about without settling anywhere, and nowhere built
cities or castles. Their clothes were made of the skins or the hair of animals. They believed that the washing and drying
of anything soiled was displeasing to the gods, who punished such action with thunder and lightning.^*^ There can be little doubt that the Hiung-nu are identical with the nomad horde
called Huns, who under Attila made a devastating raid across Europe, and were in a. d. 451 ultimately defeated in France. It is more doubtful whether they belonged to the Turk or to the Mongol division of the Turanian family. Such indications
as there are seem to favour the latter alternative. No mention of any of the chiefs of the Hiung-nu is made till Teuman (214 B.C.), whose son in 209 b.c. became the real founder of the Hiung-nu Empire. Between 177 and 165 b.c. he subjected nearly the whole of High Asia, conquered Turkestan and
Bokhara, and extended his dominions to the Caspian. The Hiung-nu at this time drove before them the tribe called
Yiieh-chi, who divided into two hordes, one of which invaded the valley of the Indus, while the other expelled the Sacae from East Turkestan and drove them into the valley of the Hi. About the beginning of our era we hear of the existence in
East Turkestan of several independent cities, of which Khotan was the most important. Dissensions among the Hiung-nu led to their empire, in



HISTOEY OF THE TURKS 125
A. D. 48, splitting into a northern and a southern half. The northern section on being attacked, with the assistance of the
Chinese, by the southern division, migrated north-westwards to the region of the Aral Sea, where the Kazaks wander as
nomads at the present day.
In the sixth century a new tribe, the Tu-kiu (T'u-chiieh),
appeared in High Asia. After the Empire of the Hiung-nu had been destroyed, their remaining hordes were driven by the Chinese to the shores of Lake Balkhash. But even here they
found no rest from their enemies. A legend preserved by the
Chinese narrates that at last only a single boy survived. He was nourished by a she- wolf ^^ till both were by some higher power carried off to a mountain situated to the north-east of the land of the Uigurs. Here they entered a cave through which they
came to a fertile valley 20,000 miles in extent. In this locality
the she-wolf bore ten young, who grew up to be warriors and captured wives for themselves. Their leader was the wolf-son Assena or Tsena ('wolf') : even in his time the wolf clan had come to consist of 500 persons, who by reason of their origin had a wolf's head as their banner. ^^ Their valley soon became too small for them ; obliged to abandon it, they scattered in the glens of the Gold Mountain (Altai). After they had settled at the foot of a hill resembling a helmet, which in their lan
guage was called tu-Jciu, the people adopted Tu-kiu (the Chinese
phonetic equivalent of Tiirk) as their own name. Chinese sources of the sixth century furnish a good deal of information about the Turkish institutions and customs of that time. The following are among their statements : The Khan was invested with supreme power. Marriage was effected by
arrangement, not capture. Amusements consisted of singing, playing at dice, drinking Jcumiss to the point of intoxication.
They had a written alphabet, and used a duodenary cycle in
which the ^^ears were designated by the names of animals. The period 546-82 was the first brilliant epoch of early Turkish history. The tribes, united under the leadership of
Tumen, who took the title of Il-khan, made astonishing progress. Though the chief of what had been only a servile
clan in China fifty years before, he had acquired so powerful a position that he was able in 567 to send an embassy to the'
Byzantine Emperor Justin II, with a view to establishing commercial relations, especially in the silk trade, with the



126 THE TURKISH DIVISION
west, and to co-operating with the Greeks against the Persians.
The Emperor sent a return embassy under Zemarchos, who describes their reception and the barbaric pomp and luxury at
the court of the Khan. The Turks at that time were not only masters of Transoxiana, but also of Khorasan to the south-west of the Oxus, receiving tribute from the settled Aryans in that
region. Nevertheless, they kept to their nomadic manner of life and remained in the steppes on the other side of the Yaxartes as far as the Altai. Menander, who has preserved
the fragments of Zemarchos, calls the Turks of the embassy
Sacae, which is also the name given by the Byzantines to the Turks beyond the Oxus and the Yaxartes. The Khan's Turks
were evidently not Kirghiz (Kazaks), because he presented Zemarchos with a Kirghiz female slave captured by himself. Several names mentioned by Zemarchos are Turkish, such as
Tarkhan, Khakan ; and Talas is the name of a place still exist
ing on the edge of the Kirghiz steppe. The Volga, the Ural,
and the Emba already had Turkish names at that time.''^^ Several enibassies were subsequently exchanged between the
Turkish Khans and the Byzantine Emperors, and in 620-8 the Turks assisted Heraclius in his campaign against Persia. In 582 the Turks split into two Khanates, which are heard of for a century and a half: the northern near Lake Baikal and the southern tributaries of the Yenisei ; and the western, with two head-quarters, the one near Urumchi and the other north of Tashkent. But their conquests and raids extended
much farther west and south than these names imply.
In 630 the Chinese pilgrim Hsiian Tsang (Yiian Chwang) ^^ was, on his way to India, well received by the western Turki-sh
Khan, who exercised some kind of authority from Turfan to Merv. The western branch was independent till about 650,
and lasted as a political name till about 750. From about 650 the conquests of the Arabs, as a result of the preaching of Mohammed, led to the subjection of Persia followed by that of Transoxiana. Meanwhile dissensions had broken out among the western Turks, between the tribes on the western and those on the eastern side of Lake Issik-kul. The Chinese in 659 seized this opportunity to declare the annexation of the whole
"territory of the western Turks, including Dzungaria, Tashkent, Ferghana, Bokhara, Khulm, Badakshan, Ghazni, Bamian, Udyana, Wakhan, and Karateghin. For a whole century



HISTORY OF THE TURKS 127
(650-750) the possession of these domains was disputed, not only by the Chinese, but also by the Tibetans in the east
and the Arabs in the west. Soon after 700, however, the Mohammedan conquest of Transoxiana was completed. In the east the really effective power seems to have been exercised by
a new Turkish tribe called Turgash, which had capitals at
Tokmak and Hi. For the history of the northern Turks, our only authorities are the Orkhon and Yenisei inscriptions as well as Chinese writers. The half century following the division of the Turks (582) was prosperous for the northern branch. Their growing
power made them a menace to the Chinese, who however conquered them in 630. This is the 'Chinese servitude ' mentioned in the inscriptions. In 682 Kutluk re-established a Turkish
State on the Orkhon. He was succeeded by his brother, the
great chief Kapagan Khagan (691-716), who either subdued
or drove southward the Turgash early in the eighth centur}^ In 744 the northern Khanate was destroyed by a coalition of
the Uigur and two other, probably Turkish, tribes.
The Uigurs-^ established themselves at Balasaghun (near
Lake Issik-kul) in the middle of the eighth century. That they
were Turks is certain from the evidence of words taken down by early travellers and of the literary relics in the Uigur
language. They already possessed an advanced civilization in
the fourth century, as is shown by the records of a Chinese
pilgrim who in a. d. 399 found west of Lop-nor 4,000 strict
Buddhists among the Uigurs.^^ In a.d. 478 the Chinese men
tion the writing of the Uigurs, and in the same century state
that the Uigurs possessed a number of translations from Chinese works. In 515 and 528 the Uigurs sent requests to China for various Chinese books and a Chinese teacher. According to a later Chinese authority, not only Indian Buddhism but Persian Zoroastrianism, Nestorian Christianity, and even Manichaeanism flourished side hj side among the Uigurs in the tenth century.
The Chinese at this period give an account of the capital of the Uigurs, and state that there were eighteen cities in their
territory .^"^ They describe the Uigur country as producing
corn and fruits of all kinds, and as well adapted for silk
culture. They also mention that the Uigurs had their own
writing, though they also used that of the Chinese, while some of them spoke Arabic. They observe that the wedding and



128 THE TURKISH DIVISION
funeral ceremonies of the Uigurs were the same as those of the Chinese, but that their customs were otherwise identical with those of the Turks. In the Khanates of Jenghiz Khan's
successors, the Uigurs were highly respected for their learning and were employed in all the highest offices. But later
various peoples, other Turks, Mongols, and Chinese, migrated into their country ; through the constant influence of Arabs and
Moslem Turks they gradually, lost their peculiar culture ; and when they coalesced with the eastern Turks their name vanished from history. From the middle of the eighth century we hear nothing
of the Turks for about 200 years. But in the tenth century Turkish adventurers appear as founders of the dynasty of the
Ghaznevids at Ghazni. About the same time we hear of an Uigur kingdom which extended from Issik-kul to Kashgar. Satok Boghra Khan, the ruler of this kingdom, was converted to Islam soon after a.d. 941, and his dynasty lasted till 1120. The earliest product of Turkish literature, the poem called
Kudatku BiliJc,
' the Blessed Knowledge ', which was finished
at Kashgar in 1070, gives a picture of life in East Turkestan
after its conversion to Islam, which still shows traces of Chinese influence. But after this period nearly all Turks, except a few obscure tribes like the Yakuts, adopted the Perso-Arabic civilization. Several of the Turkish tribes, however, such as the Kazaks, the Turkmens, the Yuriiks of Asia Minor, retained their nomad mode of life, and have not yet
abandoned it. But all Turks, whether nomad or settled, have
throughout the course of their history, down to the present day, shown two national characteristics : submissiveness to
their own authorities, combined with attachment to the
despotic form of government ; and as fighters the power of initiative independent of their officers a trait noticed both
by the ancient Chinese and by modern European officers. In the tenth century information about the Turks is also
supplied by the Emperor Constantinus Porphyrogenitus, who
in 940 wrote his treatise De administrando imperio. By that time Turkish hordes were already getting nearer the frontiers of the Byzantine Empire and eastern Europe. The collective
name of Turk was also already giving way to tribal names
such as Khazar, Pecheneg, Ghuz, and Uz. Of the Pechenegs,
who were a purely Turkish tribe, the Emperor tells that at



HISTORY OF THE TUEKS 129
first they dwelt on the Volga and the Ural, but about 890,
pushed by the Uz, they settled in the steppe regions of the
Don and the Dnieper a statement confirmed by the Russian
annals, which place the appearance of this people on the frontier of Russia about a.d. 915. The Turks are described by the Emperor as an eminently warlike nation of riders, divided into tribes and clans, mostly nomad, paying great attention to their horses, which they allowed to graze in the
open, summer and winter ; a people hardened against the severities of climate, hunger, and thirst. This account corresponds exactly to the life and character of the Turkish nomads of to-day, such as the Turkmens and Kazaks. The accounts of the Turks by Arabic writers that have come
down to us from the tenth century are more detailed and concrete. The two oldest of them, Ibn Dasta and Ibn Fozlan, speak only of the western Turks on the Volga and the Black Sea, of the Bashkirs and Pechenegs, as well as of the Magyars.
Mas*udi (943-8) in particular gives a very trustworthy picture of the Turks. To the same century belong several other Arab
writers who supply information about the Turks. These
Arabs give the collective name of Ghuz to all the Turkish nomads that wandered on the steppes east of the Volga, beginning from the north of the Caspian and the Aral Sea,
and extending southward towards Dehistan, their neighbours in the north being the Bashkirs and in the west the Pechenegs.
Mas'udi, who divides them into upper, lower, and middle Ghuz, speaks of their capital as situated about a mile from the Yaxartes and two miles from its mouth in the Aral Sea. All the Turkish nomads in the north of Iran are called Ghuz and are referred to as the plague of their civilized neighbours from
of old. To the tenth century belongs the rise of the Seljuks, the leaders of the Kabaks, a tribe of the Ghuz, first heard of in Transoxiana about 985. The activities of their chiefs resulted in turning the Turkish dynasty which had established
itself in 962 at Ghazni (between Kabul and Kandahar) towards
India, the north-western part ai which became a Mohammedan conquest between 1001 and 1026.'-^^ The Seljuk chiefs estab
lished themselves as protectors of the Abbasid Caliph, who
formally ceded his temporal power to them. Alp Arslan, son of Chakir, defeated the Byzantines at Manzikert in 1071, and prepared the way for Ottoman conquests. His son Malik Shah TURANIiNS I



130 THE TURKISH DIVISION
ruled over nearly the whole of modern Turkey in Asia and the
territory to the east as far as the frontiers of China. On his death in 1092 the Empire broke up : Konia became the capital
of the Sultanate of Asia Minor, and various Seljuk dynasties established themselves in Kirman, Irak, and Syria.
A new Turkish power was founded by the Khans of Khiva,
who were known as the Khwarizm Shahs. They were originally
vassals of the Seljuks, but made themselves independent and conquered Khorasan and Irak. They had to contend with
another new arrival from the east, the Kara-Kitais, who were probably Turks also and who were pushed westward from China by the Kins. 'These new-comers conquered Kashgar,
Khotan, Yarkand, and later Transoxiana, pushing the Ghuz tribes before them into Afghanistan and Persia. In 1219 an extraordinary wave of invasion surged across
Asia to Europe under Jenghiz Khan, the greatest personality ever produced in the sand deserts of Asia. After his death his
conquests were divided, Transoxiana, Kashgar, Badakshan, Balkh, and Ghazni falling to the share of his second son
Jagatai, after whom the population and the language of the
countries about the Oxus came to be called. The latter never ceased to be Turkish in speech and customs, because the hordes
of Jenghiz (though he himself and his family were Mongols)
comprised a large Turkish element. The Jagatai Khanate lasted from 1234 to 1370. In 1321 it split into two consisting of Transoxiana and Dzungaria.
In the latter part of the fourteenth century a new wave
of conquest was started by Timur (1333-1404), who had an
extraordinary power of collecting and leading Central Asian
hordes. He was a Turk by descent, and a native of the district
of Samarkand. He conquered Dzungaria (1370), Persia and
the Caucasus (1390), the Kipchaks on the Volga (1395), and
Northern India (1398). He then invaded Syria and Asia
Minor, where he defeated, though he did not annihilate, the Osmanlis at Angora in 1402. His successors ruled at Samarkand
till 1499, their possessions including the northern parts of Afghanistan and Persia, as well as Transoxiana. Timur's
Empire having fallen to pieces after his death, Mohammed I (1413-21) succeeded in recovering for the Osmanli Turks all the territories which his father had ruled over, and in re
capturing the stronghold of Iconia (1416). His services in



HISTOEY OF THE TURKS 131
the regeneration of the Turkish power can hardly be over
estimated. The Ottoman Navy is for the first time heard of in
his reign. His successor, Murad II (1421-51), laid siege ^to Constantinople in 1422, but did not succeed in capturing the city. By a treaty signed in 1424 the Emperor Manuel II
agreed to pay a heavy annual tribute and to surrender nearly
all the towns on the Black Sea. The .next few years were marked by attacks on Serbia d-nd Hungary. In 1432 the
Turks plundered in Hungary as far as Temesvar and Her
mannstadt, while in Serbia they captured Semendria and
invested Belgrade. But in 1442 the Hungarian hero, John
Hunyadi, expelled the Turks from Semendria and, penetrating into the Balkans, inflicted severe losses on the Turkish army.
A large Christian army was led against the Turks in 1444, but
was completely defeated by Murad at Varna. In 1446 Corinth,
Patras, and the northern part of the Morea were added to
the Turkish conquests. Two years later Hunyadi, who had
collected the largest Hungarian army yet raised against the Turks, was defeated at Kossovo with very heavy losses. In
1451 Murad died at Adrianople. He was succeeded by his
son Mohammed II (1451-81), who at once set about the realiza
tion of the long-projected conquest of Constantinople. This was accomplished after a siege of fifty-three days, as the result of a tremendous assault with enormously superior numbers, on May 29, 1453. This great event marks the entry of the Turks
as a European power, the history of which belongs exclusively to the Osmanli branch of the Turkish race.

Owing to their two lines of migration westward, the whole Turkish race may be divided into the two groups of Northern
and Southern Turks. But as this old division no longer
clearly corresponds to the geographical distribution of to-day,
it is more satisfactory to distinguish the following five groups based on the twofold division : i. The Siberian Turks, comprising three branches : the eastern on the Lena consisting of the Yakuts ; the central, chiefly north of the Altai and between the upper Yenisei and i2



132 THE TURKISH DIVISION
the upper Irtish ; and the western branch, between the rivers
Tom and Tobol, both north and south of the Siberian railway. ii. The Central Asian TurJcs, comprising the inhabitants of Chinese Turkestan, and of the steppes of southern Siberia and
Eussian Turkestan, a territory which extends from Lop-nor in the east to the Caspian in the west, from the Siberian Railway in the north to the frontiers of Afghanistan in the south,
and is inhabited by the largest and most compact body of the Turkish race.
iii. The Volga TurTcs, or the Turkish peoples inhabiting the territory of the middle Volga in the Governments of Kazan,
Ufa, Simbirsk, and Samara, and possessing an historical sense
of racial unity as always having occupied the region between Tobolsk and the Volga. iv. The Blade Sea Turks, the descendants of the ancient
Pechenegs, Uz, and Kumanians, who since the appearance of
the Huns have lived to the east and north-east of the Black Sea and west of the Caspian, and of whom single fractions
still live partly in this region, and have partly migrated
down to the Caucasus or have been absorbed by other cognate
tribes.
V. The Webtern Turks, consisting chiefly of the Azarbaijans in Persia and the Caucasus, and above all the Osmanlis in Asia
Minor. They migrated with the armies of Seljuk and Jenghiz Khan, partly also of Timur, to Western Asia. By descent
belonging to the Black Sea Turks, they must have come from the northern coast of the Caspian and the Aral. They origi
nally belonged to the Turkish tribes known in the Middle Ages as Uz, Ghuz, or Kumanians. Each of these live groups is subdivided into tribes. They
are here treated, as far as possible, according to their geographical distribution from east to west.
i. The Siberian Turks
a. The Yakuts occupy nearly the whole valley of the lower
Lena down to the coast, where they extend between the Khatanga and the Kolima (from about long. 100 E. to 160 E.). In the south they reach from the sources of the Vilyui river to the Sea of Okhotsk. In the beginning of the thirteenth cen
tury they lived near Lake Baikal, whence they were driven
northward by the Mongol Buryats, who arrived in that region



SIBERIAN TURKS 133
about 1200, under pressure of the Mongol hordes moving
westward under Jenghiz Khan. In their present territory they are surrounded by other Turanians ; the Tungus in the
west, south, and south-east, and the Samoyeds in the northwest. They are thus completely isolated from the other
Siberian Turks. Their settlements are now steadily advancing
southwards into the hunting domains of the Tungus, who give way before their superior civilization.
Name. The Yakuts call themselves Sakha or Sakhov. There is still located in the neighbourhood of Minusinsk a Turkish tribe called Sekha. This indicates where their original home was before the time when their migrations
began. They owe their present name of Yakut to the Russians,
who borrowed it from the Tungus form Yeko or Yekot. One branch, found between the Yenisei and the Khatanga in the
Yeniseisk Government, is known by the name of Tolgan.
Number. The Yakut population in 1911 numbered 245,500.^9
They are a prolific race, averaging ten to a family, and are increasing in number. They absorb many Russian settlers,
who adopt their language and customs.
Language. The Yakuts speak a purely Turkish language, which differs considerably from the western Turkish dialects,
being more archaic than any of the others, as is regularly the
case when a branch of any language is isolated. Characteristics. Owing to admixture with the Tungus on
the one hand and with Russians on the other, the Yakuts show more variations from the normal racial type than any other
Turkish or any Mongol people. But their usual physical characteristics are the following. They are middle-sized, thickset, robust, and muscular. They have small round heads, nar
row foreheads, broad flat noses, narrow eyes, wiry black hair, and scanty beard. They usually cut their hair short, except
the Shamans, who grow it long. When well nourished they
are tall and active ; but in the north they are below medium
height, have a sickly complexion, and are indolent.
They show much more intelligence than the Tungus;
they are, in fact, probably the most intelligent native Siberian
tribe. They are good-tempered, orderly, and hospitable, labo
rious, enterprising, and skilful as artisans, traders, and agriculturists alike. They are sociable, being fond of noise, song, dance, and cardsv



134 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
Manner of Life. The Yakuts are nomads, whose chief occu
pation is the rearing of horses and cattle. The breeding of the
former was the more usual in earlier times, but that of the
latter has become more prevalent at the present da}^ Lately they have begun to breed dogs, to which, however, they are
harsh, considering them to be unclean and to have no soul. They also fish and hunt, and search for the ivory of the fossil mammoth, which they carve with some skill. The cultivation of cereals has also been introduced among them. They were familiar with smelting the iron ore of the Vilyui valley long before they came into contact with the Russians. The steel
which they produce is flexible, but very good.
Dwellings, Their winter huts are made of logs, with small windows, in which plates of ice or pieces of skin are inserted instead of glass. They contain two compartments, one for cattle, the other divided into sections for the use of the family. In summer they leave these wooden dwellings and encamp in conical huts made of birch-bark. Food. The Yakuts who frequent the rivers live chiefly on dried fish; the inland tribes like horseflesh, but they rarely kill oxen for food. They are specially fond of Jcumiss, the
intoxicant made of fermented mare's milk. They also like
drinking large bowls of melted butter. A delicacy among
them is a jelly extracted from reindeer horns and flavoured
with pine-bark. A favourite form of food are berries and
cedar cones, which they collect in large quantities. Social Institutions. The Yakuts are divided into clans, which again combine to form larger units. Formerly the clans were very extensive, when the Yakuts owned great herds
of horses, but since the adoption of cattle-rfearing both the herds and the clans have grown smaller.
As the clan consists of blood relations, marriage is exoga
mous. Among the Arctic Yakuts, however, endogamous marriage has been introduced through the influence of their
eastern aboriginal neighbours, the Yukaghirs, who live on the
lower Yana and Kolima. The marriage ceremony consists in
an exchange of gifts, the bridegroom bringing the bridal price and the bride the dowry. "When the Cossacks first came across the Yakuts early in the seventeenth century they found polygamy general among them, but this institution is little
practised now.



SIBEEIAN TURKS 135
Every Yakut is given two names, by one of which he is
never called. The latter corresponds to the 'secret' name
which in India has been given from the earliest times down to the present day. and which is never divulged, in order that
witchcraft may not by its means be practised against its owner.
When an important Yakut dies his best horse is killed and eaten.
Religion. The Yakuts have been nominally Christians'^
since the beginning of the eighteenth century, but they have a very hazy idea of the teachings of Christianity. They retain
much of their original nature-worship and Shamanism. Their native chief god is called Tangra ; they also believe in many
malevolent spirits. In 1877 a Yakut definitely stated at
St. Petersburg that his people still secretly adhered to their belief in their national gods.
History. Of the origin and earliest migration of the Yakuts
we have no direct historical evidence. Linguistic arguments, however, indicate that they are descended from the eastern Turks who, long before our era, lived north of the T'ien Shan,
and are known under the collective name of Uigur, and whose
language represents the oldest and least corrupted form of Turkish.^^ It is known that at the beginning of the thirteenth
century they inhabited the region of Lake Baikal, whence they were driven northward by the arrival of the Mongol
Buryats. They made for the Lena, but had to move far north
in order to escape from the raids of the Tungus. The tide has
now turned, and the Tungus are giving way before the south
ward pressure of the Yakuts. The Cossacks first came in contact with the Yakuts in 1620, when they were engaged in internal dissensions. After becoming subject to Russian rule
the Yakuts were taxed in furs ; but now a poll-tax of four roubles is (or was) paid by them in coin.

136 THE TURKISH DIVISION
of the Turks are meant the tribes still occupying part of the
region that was the cradle of their race. Their home lies chiefly in the southern portions of the Grovernments of Tomsk
and of Yeniseisk. This territory extends from north to south between the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Altai mountains
(lat. 55-50 N.) and from west to east between the southern tributaries of the Upper Ob and those of the Upper Yenisei
(long. 83-98 E.). The population consists of a mixture of Turanian remnants Samoyeds, Mongols, Turks in which, however, the Turkish element and the Turkish language prevail..
These Turks are more numerous in the Government of Tomsk,
much less so in that of Yeniseisk. In the former Government 70 per cent, speak their own language only and 30 per cent.
Russian as well, while in the latter 88 per cent, speak Turkish
and 1 2 per cent. Russian also. Name, There is no general name by which this group of
Siberian Turkish tribes call themselves. But as the Altai
range is their original home, in which some of them still
live, and as the geographical area which they occupy extends
northwards almost continuously from that range, we may con
.veniently call them Altaian Turks. Number. The total number of the Altaian Turks is 158,303,
of whom 109,807 live in the Government of Tomsk and 48,496 in that of Yeniseisk. Characteristics. Where they adjoin the Mongol-Kalmuk
territory, these Turks show a decidedly Mongolian type of
features. The most characteristically Turkish tribe among
them appear to be the Kumandins, who live to the north of
the Altaians proper. These tribes, however, being on the whole an amalgam of different racial elements, present no uniform special Turkish characteristics, but many variations of the general Turanian type. Though their mental faculties are little developed, these
Turks are not without wits and common sense. Their apathy and their strong attachment to old Asiatic customs strike the
observer who compares them with the Russians. In agricultural labour they are apt to be lazy, partly ^perhaps because they are more easily exhausted than the Russians. Mode of Life. These tribes are nomads or half nomads according to the climatic and territorial circumstances of their existence : the mountains and valleys restrict the



SIBERIAN TURKS 137
migratory instinct, while the plateaus afford free scope to
the cattle-breeding nomad; the forests on the other hand
impose a new kind of life, that of the settled nomad who fishes or hunts. All these classes of the population practise
agriculture, especially the cultivation of barley, to a certain
extent. The iron industry is plied by a fraction of the Altaians
and the Forest Tatars, and has progressed among them as far
as the production of steel. Trade is also carried on from this region along a route which has been used for centuries,
the main points of which are Petro-Paulovsk, Semipalatinsk, Tyumen, Kurgan, and Tobolsk. This trade extends from the extreme north to the Oxus region in the south-west, to the
Kirghiz steppe, and even to Persia. The produce passing westwards are silk and cotton goods, raw wool, tea, dried
grapes and plums, horses, sheep, felt, skins, and other com
modities. The stock-breeding part of the population pay special attention to their horses ; for, being born riders, they, like Turks in general, bestow the utmost care on these animals, and feel more at home on their backs than anywhere else.
Those who have become settled live in villages during the
winter, but always endeavour if possible to move into the open
during the summer. Village groups ranging from 200 to 3,000 inhabitants are administered by elders, who, being survivals of
old patriarchal rule, are greatly respected. Dwellings. The tent is not in such general use among the
Siberian Turks as among the Kirghiz. Commoner are different kinds of dwellings ranging from the hut constructed of pine branches to the square strongly- built winter house, which is furnished with a stove, and beside which there is a cattle-yard and a storehouse. The cattle-breeding nomad in summer erects a hut formed of several poles held together by two rings and
covered with felt, while in winter he lives in a wooden yurta with a conical roof. The forest nomad inhabits a square hut made of boards. The wooden huts are poor and dirty, having
in the middle a hearth which gives out little heat but much smoke. Food. The food of these tribes is much the same as that of the Kazan Turks. The favourite drink among them is tea,
especially brick tea, which they obtain from China. It is
boiled with salt as among the Mongols and Kirghiz. They are also fond of airan or buttermilk. Kumiss is not in such



138 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
general use as among the Kirghiz. From this they make
a kind of brandy, which they indulge in copiously, not con
sidering it to be forbidden by law, because it was not known
at the time of Mohammed. Dress. In the south the fashions of China in dress, in the north those of Russia, and in the neighbourhood of Tomsk
those of Bokhara prevail. The costume worn by the Kumandin
tribe is probably the oldest. The footgear of these tribes in
general resembles that of the Mongols, being in summer made of horse-hide, in winter of the skin of the wild goat.
Family Customs. Marriages are arranged by the father of
the bridegroom at a time when the future husband and wife
are still infants. The Jcalim, or price paid for the bride, a generation ago varied from 5 to 15 roubles among the
poorer classes. The betrothal is generally completed by the father of the bride giving some presents to the parents and nearest relations of the bridegroom. The wedding, which is usually celebrated in summer, takes place after the young couple have entered their seventeenth year. Funeral Rites. Many heathen features are retained in the
funeral rites of even those Siberian Turks who have adopted
Christianity. Men are buried in their rain-coats, women in their silk cloaks, while children are wrapped in birch- bark. The corpse is interred lying on its back, with face directed towards the east. Food and drink are placed in the grave.
Sometimes the favourite horse of the deceased man is sacrificed, its fiesh being consumed at the funeral feast and its skull being fixed to a pole, which is set up over the place of interment. Light is set to a funeral pyre, around which
dancing and carousing go on for days together. Religion. In the matter of religion the Altaian l^urks may be divided into three groups : Christians, Mohammedans, and Shamanists. Christianity was introduced among them after 1584, when
this region was incorporated in the Eussian Empire. It is chiefly found where the Eussian colonists are numerous, where pressure is exercised by the Eussian administration, and where the Turks have adopted the Eussian language ; but
their Christianity consists chiefly in the superficial practice of its' ceremonies, for they are Shamanists at heart. It is somewhat remarkable' that Christianity seems hardly ever



SIBERIAN TURKS 139
to take root among Turkish peoples, while Mohammedanism
appears to be peculiarly adapted to their religious needs.
Islam came into contact with the Siberian Turks at a much earlier period. Its first emissaries probably reached the region of the Tobol, the Ishim and the Irtish, at the time of the Old Bulgarian Empire, by the trade route which in the eleventh
and twelfth centuries already extended from the Volga into
Eastern Asia. This earliest Moslem influence came to the Siberian Turks hand in hand with trade. But it was not till the religion of the Arabian prophet had assumed a Turkish guise that Islam was able to contend successfully with Shamanism, the old national religion. It then established itself here, and not only survives, but even flourishes under the Christian rule
of Russia, whose missionary efforts against it seem to be of but
slight avail. The Arabic-Persian civilization of Islam has here effaced all but a small remnant of ancient Turkish sagas and
customs, which survive only among the lowest orders of the
population. The third religion found in this part of the Turkish world is the old national faith, Shamanism. The tribes among
whom it chiefly survives are the Teleuts, the Shors, and the Black Forest Tatars. It has maintained itself here because the influence of the Chinese Buddhist culture from the southeast and of Islam from the south and west could not easily
reach them in this region. Had the Siberian Turkish dynasty not been destroyed by the Russians at the close of the sixteenth
century, Mohammedanism would probably be the religion of
the whole of this territory. Eventually Shamanism is likely
to disappear gradually before Islam or Buddhism rather than "
Christianity. One of the most primitive traits surviving among these Shamanists is that Tengere KJian^ ' Lord Heaven', figures as the supreme deity. There are also mountain, forest, river, and house spirits that are propitiated by sacrifices and
offerings. The sacrifices consist chiefly of horses, cattle, sheep, the flesh of which is roasted or boiled and hastily consumed by the worshippers, while the skins of the victims are hung
on long poles to appease the evil spirits. Prepared food and drink are also offered, including wine and brandy, but never
water. The hunter offers a wild goat made of dough, which
he places on the altar. The services of the Shaman, or Kam
as he is called, with his drum are constantly called in. He



140 THE TURKISH DIVISION
acts as a magician, exorcist, rainmaker, interpreter of dreams,
and in other similar capacities. With these survivals of old Turkish religion there is a strange mixture of Buddhist in
fluences. Thus, in a cosmogonic myth appear two personages
called Mai-tere and Mandi/shireh, who are merely transformations of the Buddhist Bodhisattvas Maitreya and Manjusri. Iranian elements may also be traced in this type of myth.
Language. The language of the Siberian Turks has a marked
resemblance to the Uigur of the Kudatku BiliJc (1070), much in
the same way as the spoken dialects of Bokhara, Samarkand,
and Khiva are related to the literary Jagatai. In prehistoric
times it must thus have been identical with the Uigur language,
from which the Kazak first separated, and much later the Kara-Kirghiz. Of the various Altaian dialects, that of the Chernevs and of the Shors are nearest to this old Turkish
tongue. Literature. Eadloff has collected specimens of the popular literature of the tribes of South Siberia, consisting of the fairy
tales, songs, and legends of the Altaian Turks. These represent genuine Turkish modes of thought in a manner not to be
found even among quite primitive Turkish peoples whose poetry has been strongly influenced by Islam.
History. Nothing certain is known about the Siberian
Turks till the sixteenth century, wheji they were under the
rule of a prince named Yadikar, a contemporary of Ivan
the Terrible (1530-84), who subdued Kazan in 1552, Astrakhan in 1554, and the Bashkirs in 1555. In the latter year an ambassador of Yadikar appeared at the court of Moscow bringing a tribute of 700 sable skins. The last prince of the Siberian line was attacked b}^ the Cossack adventurer Yermak with a force of 2,000 horsemen, and with the aid of fire-arms a form of weapon at that time entirely unknown to the Siberian Turks defeated in 1579. Finally, after varying
warfare, the prince was irretrievably vanquished in 1598, his empire being destroyed, and his dominions incorporated in Russia. Thus, with the tragic end of their last prince, the Siberian Turks lost their independence, suffering the same fate
as their kinsmen on the Volga and in the Crimea. The hordes of the Ostyaks and of the then numerous Voguls both tribes of another branch of the Turanian family helped the
Russians to consolidate their new conquests in Siberia. When,



SIBERIAN TURKS 141
in the middle of the eighteenth century, the Chinese destroyed
the Dzungarian Empire, new Turkish and West Mongol elements from the northern slopes of the Sayan mountains submitted to Russian rule. Since then Russia has had in its hands the destinies of all the Siberian Turks. The Yakuts had been subjected in the seventeenth century. Islam enables the Moslem Siberian Turks to resist the encroachments of
Russian civilization, because it protects them from absorption and, by supplying them with an ordered system of social life, improves their economic condition. It has had a similar effect on the Turks of the Volga and the Crimea in the face of
zealous efforts at Russification. On the other hand, the Christian and Shamanist Turks are being rapidly denationalized and are on the way to complete absorption or
destruction. The Russians have been steadily encroaching on
the territory of the nomads, ousting them from mountain,
valley, and forest. The simple nomad and forest- dweller is
also unscrupulously exploited by being paid ridiculously low
prices for his produce and being exorbitantly over-charged for
Russian manufactures. He is, moreover, over-reached by
scandalously high usury, while his health is ruined by the deadly poison of brandy. Thus the time seems near at hand
when a large piwportion of the Turkish Altaians, completely impoverished and decimated by disease, will cease to exist
except in name, destroyed by the melancholy fate which has overtaken so many primitive races as a result of contact with
a higher civilization. Tribes. About ten main tribes may be distinguished :
1. The Altaians, who live at the northern end of the Altaian range in the valleys of the Katun and of the Chulishman. They call themselves Altai KisJii or 'Altai Men', while the
Russians call them Altaian Kalmuks, a term which is mislead
ing because, though their type is closely akin to that of the Mongols, they are Turks. They are divided into twenty-four clans, which, though territorially a good deal mixed up, have
a strong feeling of community of origin. Members of the same clan consequently do not intermarry. Every clan has
its own tutelary spirit and certain peculiar prayer formulas.
Their facial type is uniform and Mongolian. The face is broad and flat, the eyes small and oblique, the cheek-bones
prominent, the nose depressed and much too small for the



142 THE TURKISH DIVISION
face, the mouth large with thick lips, the beard scanty, the complexion dark ; the eyebrows are deep black as well as the
hair, which is hard and bristly. The men mostly shave their
heads, leaving on the top only a small round patch, which they
plait into a thin pigtail. The figure is thick-set, spare, and muscular. The legs are mostly crooked, doubtless as a result
of early and constant riding. Their gait is waddling. The Altaians differ from the Mongols in having smaller figures
and flatter faces. The Altaians have many good qualities. They are honest
and straightforward, peaceful and unobtrusive ; and they
show great respect to age as well as obedience to superior
authority. In spite of their docility, they value freedom above everything. They hate service to such a degree that they would sooner starve than endure it, and have no stronger term of abuse than 'servant'. They are also extraordinarily hos
pitable. They are extremely attached to their families, clans,
and homeland. Though they regard women as an inferior
race, they never beat their wives, and generally treat them
kindly. They are imaginative, but credulous and superstitious. Their chief vices are indolence, dirtiness, and intemperance. Spending the greater part of their lives in doing nothing, they often suffer great hardships in consequence >f their laziness.
Nevertheless they are able, when necessary, to endure long spells of strenuous effort and privation. The dirtiness of the
Altaian is still more striking. He is so thoroughly water-shy
that his body is covered with a complete crust of dirt. Men
and women wear their under-garments till they rot off their bodies. These people even consider dirt beneficial and cleanliness dangerous. They consume their weak brandy, which they distil from kumiss (fermented mare's milk) and ah^an
(buttermilk) in great quantities. Consequently almost half the
population is continuously drunk during the milk-producing
summer months. Even women and children drink this brandy,
but in great moderation. This intemperance is not only very harmful to their health, but is economically very injurious
to the population, because it prevents their making provision for the winter. The Altaians are also passionately fond of
tobacco, which is partly cultivated by themselves, partly obtained from the Russians. Men, women, and children can
hardly pass an hour without smoking.



SIBERIAN TUEKS 143
The Altaians are mostly nomadic. As the splendid valleys of the Altai supply rich pasture lands, they devote themselves
to cattle-breeding as their chief pursuit. Not only is there excellent grass for horses, cattle, sheep, and goats, but the whole of the Altai is free from all insects injurious to cattle, while in winter its mountain meadows are free from snow.
The life here is, however, not truly nomadic. The pasturage being so abundant, even large herds move over a very small
territory, while poor people can remain on the same spot
throughout the year. It almost looks as if their own extremely dirty habits were the chief cause that forces them to change their abodes ; for they never clean their dwellings, close beside which their herds spend the nights. Though not
a people of hunters, they nearly all engage in hunting to some extent, being for the most part excellent shots. In fact, the whole male population during the winter shoot various kinds of deer and wild sheep, ducks, and geese for the sake of their flesh ; but the proper object of their pursuit are the small
animals, such as the common and the black fox, the sable, the squirrel, and others whose fur is valuable and much sought
after by merchants. They employ only fire-arms, the use of
bows and arrows having died out since the beginning of the nineteenth century. There are only the beginnings of an artisan class, comprising chiefly workers in wood and tan
ners. More advanced are the smiths, who though few in
number know the art of making steel and are very skilful.
Hence Altaian knives are preferred to those made by E/Ussians.
The dwellings of the Altaians are mostly felt yurtas, those covered with bark being rare. Of the former there are two kinds. The first, which is conical in shape, is formed of ten to fourteen poles covered with felt cloths, and tied down with
hair ropes. When migration takes place the poles are left behind, only the felt covers being transported. The second kind has a sloping roof and vertical walls, the frame being
either fixed or transportable. The interior arrangement of these yurtas is always the same, there being in the middle
a kettle and hearth, on which a fire bums all day. The Altaians chiefly eat mutton, but also to some extent horseflesh. Though they often have large herds of cattle, they
do not use them as food. Accustomed from youth to the



144 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
greatest irregularity in feeding, they can fast for days, but
when they have food they eat to excess.
Young men and girls are allowed to speak to one another
freely, and women never conceal their faces. In arranging
a marriage, the bridegroom pays the bride's father the Tcalim
in money or cattle. The bridegroom's father builds his son
a new yurta and hands over to him a part of his property
when the wedding has taken place. The dead are generally
buried in hidden spots among the mountains. The body is
placed in the grave fully dressed, and is provided with a small
sack containing food for the journey.
The language of the Altaians is a pure Turkish dialect of
a very archaic type. It indicates that the Altaians have lived for centuries separated by Mongols from the bulk of the
Turkish tribes of the south. Though it has many Mongol loan
words, it is by no means a mixed language.
The Altaians are Shamanists by religion. In their yurtas
are to be seen, suspended from the poles of the roof, images of
their gods who are called Tcudai. These, being made by Sha
mans or other experts, are hung up to bring luck and to protect against the evil powers of darkness.
No statistics are available for the present numbers of this or of the following tribes, because Asiatic Russia supplies, according to the local census of 191 1 , the totals of the Siberian Turks
in each Government (Tomsk, Yeniseisk, &c.) only. The estimate given by Vambery in 1885 amounts to between 14,000
and 15,000. 2. The Mountain or Black Forest Tatars, the Uryanchai of the Mongols and the Chernevs of the Eussians, call themselves
Tuha Kishi'^^^ (Tuhsi men). They live in the mountains thickly
wooded with cedar in the region of the river Biya, between the
Katun and Lake Teletskoe. They are the most northerly of
the Turks inhabiting the spurs of the Altai, acknowledged as the immemorial inhabitants of these localities. They consist
of an aggregate of five sub-tribes, which are again divided into
clans. They are semi-nomads, partly occupied with cattle
breeding, trade, and agriculture. They keep more horses than
cows. They till the soil with the hoe, and sow wheat as well
as barley. . They are, however, for the most part hunters, as well as collectors of cedar nuts and roots.^^ According to Radloff =^* they numbered about 3,500 in 1869. Their language



SIBERIAN TURKS 145
is a Turkish dialect closely allied to that of the Altaians. In religion they are for the most part Shamanists. They believe
in a seven-headed demon who swallows the moon,^^ but is forced by the god Ulgon to restore it.^^ These Tatars, as well as the Altaians, divide the year into thirteen lunar months. They attribute the discovery of fire, from iron and stone, to
the three daughters of Ulgon.
The greatest poverty prevails among the Black Forest
Tatars. This is due to their own laziness and improvidence, and to the consequent advantage which is taken of them by the
Russian population, and against which they cannot be protected. They might otherwise be very prosperous by making hay in summer, by fully utilizing the large quantities of game in the forests, by keeping bees and profiting by the wild
honey in which their country abounds, and by reaping a rich
harvest of cedar nuts (in the immense tract of cedar forest
extending from the Tom to Lake Teletskoe), which are a dainty not only to the Russian Siberians, but also to the whole of Northern Russia. 3. The Kumandins or Kumandi Kishi live partly on both
banks of the Biya from the mouth of the Lebed downwards, and partly on the river Ishi and other tributaries of the
Katun. They are settled, living in small villages of from
five to ten houses. They are divided into Upper Kumandins
with two clans and Lower Kumandins with four. They are
almost exclusively agriculturists, who till the soil with the
hoe. They chiefly sow barley and rye, much less wheat. They
manufacture their own linen, and from the wool of their sheep
they produce a coarse cloth which they dye. They also engage in fishing, while their hunting is limited to small
animals, chiefly squirrels, the skins of which they sell to the
Russians. Their clothing is very si'mple, that of the men being almost the same as that of the Russian peasants. Their houses are built of wood, and the dwelling-room is provided
with a stove. In religion they are Shamanists, who keep images of the gods in their houses. As they are very tenacious
of their old traditions, Christianity has hardly made any
headway among them. In 1869 their numbers were 2,177,
4. The Lehed Tatars live along the Lebed, an eastern tributary of the Biya. Their language is the same as that of the Kumandins, coming midway between the dialect of the Shors
TUEA.NIANS K



146 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
and the Altaians. Though they engage in agriculture to some extent, they are chiefly devoted to the chase. They hunt the
sable chiefly near the sources of the Abakan. In summer they shoot deer, and in winter squirrels, on the Lebed. Their main exports are furs, which they sell to the merchants of Biisk and Kuznetsk. In physique they closely resemble the Shors. By
religion they are Shamanists, retaining much of their primitive Turkish mythology. The primaeval Father, the Creator of all, is called Kudai Bai Ulgon.
5. The SJiors inhabit the forest region which extends northwards from Lake Teletskoe, living on the Kondema, the Mrass, and the Tom. They are called Shor by the Altaians ; but they
have no general name of their own, calling their various divi
sions after the rivers on the banks of which they live, as Tom
people, Mrass people, or Kondema people. They are divided into many clans. Though officially called nomads, they are for the most part settled. They all live in villages, a custom
which they seem to have adopted spontaneously. In this they differ from other Altaian Turkish tribes, which have only given
up their nomadism owing to the pressure of the Russians.
There are two kinds of Shors. The lesser section, settled on the lower Mrass and the Tom, are agriculturists who live in villages like those of the Russians, and are to a great extent Russified in language, religion, and customs. The other division are the Black Forest Shors, whose chief occupation is hunting and fishing. They also live on cedar nuts and wild honey collected in the forests. They have become greatly
impoverished. According to Vambery they numbered 10,688
in 1869. Though nominally Christians, they know hardly anything of Christian doctrine and are in reality still inclined to Shamanism. One of their marriage customs consists in
carrying off the bride by stealth.
6. The Teleuts were formerly a considerable and warlike
Turkish people, who have migrated from the mountains to the low country. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
they were greatly mixed with their northern, western, and
southern neighbours. The small remnant now called Teleuts live chiefly in the district north of Kuznetsk. These are devoted Shamanists, and offered a stubborn resistance to Russian subjugation. Another section of them lives south of Biisk on the
lower Katun. These are Christians. A third branch of them



SIBEEIAN TUEKS 147
are to be found near the town of Tomsk. In the seventeenth century they mixed with the neighbouring Turkish tribes and became Mohammedans. There are two divisions of the Teleuts, called Telenget and Ach Keshtim, both of which are subdivided into many clans. They call themselves Telenget
Kishi (Telenget men), while the Russians name them 'White
Kalmuks '. They are mostly settled in villages, and practise
agriculture. To a considerable extent they have been Russian
ized. The language of the Teleuts is the same as that of the Altaians, and the poetry of both is of quite similar character.
The latter consists largely of songs composed in four- lined
stanzas. One of them, the song of ATc Koholi, is prevalent among all northern Turks. The musical instrument of the
Teleuts (as of the Altaians) is a kind of rough wooden guitar.
The number of the Teleuts in 1885 was, according to Vam
bery, 5,800. Three Turkish tribes of mixed origin live in the Abakan
valley, having occupied this territory in the seventeenth
century after the Kazak-Kirghiz had retired from the Abakan and Yenisei steppes. These are the following :
7. The Sagais. who inhabit the left bank of the Abakan river to the south-west of Minusinsk. Tiiey are settled agri
culturists, who no longer use a hoe for tilling the soil, but
a very primitive plough. They cultivate rye, wheat, and
barley. They all keep a small number of cows, sheep, and horses. Formerly they were Shamanists, but now, at least nominally, belong to the Greek Orthodox Church. They still use the services of Shamans. They have been Russianized
to a considerable extent, and have lost much of their national characteristics. In 1864 they numbered 11,720.
8. The Kachins live on the east side of the Abakan. They
are semi- nomadic, forming a transition to the stage of s.ettled peasants such as their western neighbours the Sagais. They are for the most part cattle-breeders, often owning considerable
herds. They are much wealthier than the Sagais. They carry
on agriculture only to a small extent. What distinguishes
these and other Abakan Turks is the rich development among
them of epic poetry, fairy tales, and heroic sagas in verse. The language of both these two neighbouring tribes is very similar. It was formerly greatly influenced by those of the Kirghiz and Teleuts. K2



148 THE TURKISH DIVISION
9. The Kyzyls, who belong to the district of Achinsk and inhabit the Yiis steppe, are neighbours of the Kachins. They
have long lived in this region, being mentioned as allies of the Kirghiz in 1635. Various elements, such as Kirghiz, Teleuts, and probably many Yenisei Ostyaks, have been absorbed by this tribe. It consists of ten clans. Their language is nearest
that of the Kachins. About seventy years ago their number is stated by Eadloff to have been 4,362.
10. The Tatars of the Chulim, a tributary of the Ob, are found to the north-west of the Yiis steppe in the district of Achinsk, isolated in the midst of a dense Russian population. They live for the most part like Russian peasants, and have by
this time given up their native speech. Thirty-five years ago
Radloff estimated that not more than 500 of them still spoke their Turkish dialect. They are thus becoming fused with the
Russians. They are in physique more like Mongols than
Turks. Their language, too, though Turkish, contained many Mongol and Yakut words. It indicated that the majority of
them must have been immigrant Baraba and Irtish Tatars as
well as Teleuts. They consist, or formerly consisted, of three clans. c. The West Siberian TurJcs. The western section of the Turks of Siberia live in the Government of Tobolsk, inhabiting the Baraba steppe between the Ob and the Irtish, as well
as the valleys of the Irtish and the Tobol above Tobolsk. The total number of the Turks in the Government of Tobolsk is 73,000, according to the local census of 1911 as given in Asiatic Russia. Their habitat is bounded in the south by the Trans
Siberian railway.
1. The Baraba Tatars, who are divided into several clans, have been driven more and more, before the encroachment of the Russian settlers, out of the fertile portions of the steppe into the marshes and forests. They occupy for the most part
the region between the Om and the Tara, eastern tributaries
of the Irtish, where they live in separate villages or along with Russians. They are agriculturists. Till the beginning of the nineteenth century they were for the most part heathen,
but are now all Mohammedans. Formerly they offered a strenuous resistance to Russian conquest, and later suffered
much from Kazak and Kalmuk raids.
2, The Tm'a Tatars, who call themselves Tarlyk, live chiefly



SIBEEIAN TUEKS 149
on the banks of the Irtish, from the mouth of the Tara down to the district of Tobolsk, and not far from the Irtish, on its small tributaries and on the lakes to the south of it. They are divided into four tribes, which Siberian history shows to have been in this same region in the seventeenth century. Owing to their isolation they have preserved their racial purity better
than the two following groups ; but there are among them
a considerable number of immigrants, Sarts and Bokharans,
who form an administrative district of their own. 3. The bulk of the Tohol Tatars live on the Irtish from the district of Tara down to the town of Tobolsk, and on the Tobol from the latter place up to the district of Tyumen. There are
also a few north of Tobolsk. The population on these rivers mostly consists of old Turkish inhabitants ; but those living farther west and in the region of Tobolsk have been con
siderably mixed with Sarts, Bokharans, and even Volga Turks.
The distinction of clans has, however, not been altogether effaced among them.
4. The Tyumen Tatars live almost entirely in the districts
of Tyumen and Yalutrovsk, about two-thirds of them around the former town, the rest to the east and the west of Tobolsk. The number of those living to the north and south of these districts is very small. This population consists of a mixture of old inhabitants of the Irtish with Bokharans and Volga Turks. The total number of the Siberian Turks in 191 1 {Asiatic Russia) was 537,015, made up as follows:
1. Yakuts . . 246,405 2. Turks of Central, West Siberia, and the Far East Country 245,586 3. Kirghiz in Siberia 37,982 4. Karagasses 449

ii a. East Central Asian Turks
Habitat. The habitat of the south-eastern portion of the Central Asian Turks is East Turkestan, which, lying between the T^ien Shan range on the north and the Kuen-lun range



150 THE TURKISH DIVISION
on the south, stretches from the Pamirs in the west to the Desert of Gobi and the Chinese province of Kansu in the east (long. 98 E.). The centre of this territory is taken up by the Desert of Takla-makan, around which lies the habitable land. Geographically this area forms Chinese Turkestan, but administratively the Chinese province extends farther north across the T'ien Shan, and includes the valley of Hi or Kulja, besides the district of Dzungaria. The extreme eastern limit of the Turkish population is the town called by the Turks Kumul, but by the Chinese Hami, which forms the Chinese linguistic frontier.
The great bulk of the inhabitants are of Turkish stock. The
agricultural portion, which shows a strong Aryan admixture,
inhabits the oases. Those who live in the seven large towns
are more distinctly Turkish, consisting of Sarts and Uzbegs.
On the eastern and southern slopes of the T'ien Shan and the northern slopes of the Karakoram range, various Turkish tribes,
collectively called Kirghiz (strictly speaking Kara-Kirghiz),
still lead a nomad life. Chinese Turkestan is the country in which the Turks have from the earliest times been in contact on the east with their nearest kinsmen, the Mongols ; and
though it was conquered by the Chinese (who had already exercised an intermittent sovereignty over East Turkestan from about 50 b. c. for eight centuries) in the middle of the
eighteenth century, the majority of the population is still Turkish. Name. A common political name is not used in the country
itself, because the man of East Turkestan only calls himself by the district in which he lives. The vague terms 'Kash
garlik ',
' Kashgarian ', and '
six-city man '^^ are sometimes used in a general sense. The Turkish inhabitants still call their
country Mogulistan,^^ ' Land of the Mongols ', a name which occurs as early as the fourteenth century for the territory
comprising Dzungaria and the greater part of East and West.
Turkestan.^^ The mass of the people also speak of themselves
as Sarts. The considerable Turkish population of Kumul
(Hami) and the surrounding villages, who constitute a speech island among Mongolian tribes at the eastern end of the T*ien Shan, call themselves Yerlik, ' country people
' or 'natives' ; by the Mongols they are, like the Sarts of Central Asia, termed
Khotafi, ' townsmen ' or * settlers '
; and by the Kirghiz they are spoken of as Sarts.



CENTRAL ASIAN TURKS 151
Number, The total Turkish population of East Turkestan probably amounts to over 1 ,000,000, which was the estimate of Vamberyin 1885. The non-Turkish elements, which comprise Tajiks, Hindus, Afghans, Mongols, Chinese, Dungans (Chinese
converted to Islam in past centuries), are (including the in
habitants of Dzungaria and Kulja) in all likelihood much less
numerous. But no exact figures are available. The total
population (including all races) is estimated by Forsyth ^^ in 1873 at 1,015,000; by Kuropatkin at 1,200,000; by Pyevtsov
at 2,000,000; by Sven Hedin at between 1,800,000 and 2,000,000 ;
by Hartmann *^ at 1,500,000. The population of Dzungaria is estimated at 600,000, and that of Kulja at 150,000.
Language. The Turkish idiom universally spoken in Chinese Turkestan is Jagatai Turkish, the Uzbeg dialect of
Central Asia, and is essentially identical with the language
of the Sarts in Ferghana. Hence the inhabitants of East Turkestan and of Transoxiana can easily understand each
other, and the literary language of both regions may be said to be almost identical. Though the former never apply the
term Turk to themselves, they call their language Turkl. The relationship of Turki to Uzbeg is not that of identity, but that of a sister dialect ; for its grammar and vocabulary point to
its having had a separate origin and an independent development. Various traces connect it with the old Uigur dialect
which is represented by the Kudatku Bilik (finished in a.d. 1070),
and which in the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries underwent a considerable modification in consequence of the application to it of the Arabic script as a result of the adoption of Islam.
Religion. Shamanism was doubtless the original religion
of East Turkestan. But we know that Buddhism prevailed there from the second century onwards till the end of the tenth century, and that Zoroastrianism and Nestorian Christianity were introduced into the country early in the seventh century.
But Mohammedanism is now the religion of Chinese Turkestan
generally. It supplanted Buddhism during the period of
Uigur rule, becoming the prevailing religion of the country in the latter half of the tenth century after the conversion of Satok Boghra Khan. Among the Kirghiz of the mountains
its hold is quite superficial, nor does it go very deep among the industrial and mercantile classes. Its influence is greatest
among the peasantry, who also supply the largest contingent



15^ THE TUEKISH DIVISION
of pilgrims to Arabia. Introduced from Transoxiana, Islam has always, both before and after the Mongol irruption, been reinforced from that region, but the Moslem fanaticism of the
west has never prevailed here, as it has among Tajiks, Uzbegs,
and Afghans. Racial Affinity and Type. The Turks of East Turkestan are
the descendants of the ancient Uigurs, who were the most
eastern branch of the Turks remaining behind when the first westward movement was made. Among the Turkish inhabitants of the present day the
Mongol type, both in face and build, is more pronounced in the north of Turkestan than in the west and south. The Turk of Aksu, Kucha, and Turfan is characterized by a broad head
and nose, small eyes, scanty beard, medium height, and strong build. But the people of Yarkand, Khotan, and to a less extend those of Kashgar, show unmistakable traces of Aryan admixture.^^ It may be said of the inhabitants of the 'six
cities ' *^ generally that they differ from other Central Asiatic
Turks by their more distinctively Mongolian type. Characteristics. The people of East Turkestan have some traces of the genuine Turkish national character. They show
more simplicity of manners than their western kinsmen. Excepting the inhabitants of Kashgar, Yarkand, and Khotan (who have been prejudicially influenced by Tajiks from Khokand and Kashmir), they are less addicted to lying and deceit than other inhabitants of Central Asia, though they have been
subjected for three centuries to the demoralizing effect of
Dzungarian and Chinese oppression. This despotic rule has, however, resulted in depriving this people of all courage, for
probably no other Central Asians are so cowardly. A lax state of sexual morality has been observed to prevail among the people of East Turkestan. There is also a good deal of
indulgence in intoxicating liquor. The smoking of nish, a narcotic prepared from a species of hemp, prevails in all classes of the population, and produces greater mental and
physical injury even than opium. The inhabitants of every
part of the country are devoted to music and singing. Men
tally these people are unintelligent and lethargic ; but they are honest and hospitable, kind in family relations, and submissive to superiors. The peasantry are also among the most
industrious agriculturists of the Turkish race, surpassing th



CENTEAL ASIAN TURKS 153
Uzbegs, Azarbaijans, Osmanlis, Nogaians, Bashkirs, Kazanians, both i,n this and in various domestic industries.
Dwellings. In keeping with the general agricultural character of the people, their dwellings are niore like those of the Afghans, Persians, and Osmanlis than those of the
Uzbegs, who prefer a felt tent in the midst of an enclosure.
They are houses built of stone, one-storied, and most primitive in type, with windows looking on the inner court-yard, and
a bare, irregularly built, rough, exterior wall. Both the inside
and the outside present a poverty-stricken appearance. With less irrational methods of cultivation, and above all with a less oppressive government, the land north and south of the Taklamakan, and to the north of the T'ien Shan, might be trans
formed into a smiling and prosperous country. The not
inconsiderable part of the Turkish inhabitants who are nomads,
and who change their places of abode according to the season, though to no great distance, live in felt-covered tents. Even
when they cease to wander, they still preserve their preference for the yurta^ like the Uzbegs. Dress. In dress the people of East Turkestan differ from their western co-religionists only in the colour and the material of their garments. The dark-blue linen gejierally used for the upper garment is due to Chinese influence. The head-gear
consists of a round cap made oT wool or sheepskin ; only the artisans and the traders wear a many- coloured turban, while the white muslin turban is distinctive of Mollahs and Hajis. The Turks of the north-east differ from the rest in wearing a mitre-like cap of red and green cloth with a tassel hanging
down behind. The dress of women is much the same as that of men, except that they wear a different kind of high cap. They also use ear-rings and nose -rings as ornaments. They follow the same fashion as other Turks in dressing their hair,
girls wearing a single long plait intertwined with ribbons
hanging down the back, while women have several small ones. Food. In the matter of food the Turks here differ from their western kinsmen in eating much more meat and fish, as well as in consuming the flesh of animals forbidden by the Kuran. In cooking they follow Chinese rather than Turkish
usage. Marriages. Otherwise the Turks of this country conform on the whole to the ethical standard prescribed by the system



154 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
of Islam. Marriages are arranged by the parents, as in other
Turkish countries, or are the result of personal affection, the
seclusion of women not being so rigorously observed as else
where. The bridal price Qcalim), which is not of such importance here as among nomad Turks, consists mostly of articles of dress or ornaments. At the wedding ceremony the marital
union is ratified by a piece of bread being dipped into a bowl
of salted water and then presented to the young couple. Before
entering the house of her husband the bride is placed on a carpet and carried round a fire burning in the open air. This is a very old custom, which is observed by the Uzbegs also. Birth Ceremonies. Immediately after birth a piece of sugar
is placed in the mouth of the infant, which is not taken away
from its mother till the eighth day. On the fortieth day, after
the priest has whispered the creed in its ear, it receives its
name. The tenderness for children is very marked among
this people. Position of Women. What is specially striking in the family
life of this country is the much greater legal and social inde
pendence enjoyed by women than among other Moslem Turks.
This is primarily due to the extraordinary facilities for divorce prevailing in all parts of East Turkestan. It may also in
some degree be connected with the striking preponderance of
women over men in the population. As it is so much easier
here for women to maintain an independent social position, they are often found at the head of commercial undertakings.
In the frequent political upheavals from which the country
has suffered, there are said to have been women who even commanded divisions of armies. Chinese Social Influence. In the rules regulating social intercourse and in their games the Turks of East Turkestan
have borrowed many details from their Chinese neighbours.
The use of white as the colour of mourning is also due to Chinese influence. Intellectual Life. East Turkestan produced the oldest and
most important literary monument of the Turkish race, the
Kudatku Bilik,"^^ a poem composed by Yusuf Khass Hajil at Kashgar (1065-70). But it has long been forgotten in the
land of its origin, where its very name is perfectly unknown.
Yet its language differs less from that which is regarded as literarily correct at the present day than does the mediaeval



CENTRAL ASIAN TUEKS 155
(thirteenth century) German of the Nihelungenlied from the classical language of modern Germany. It might have been
expected that in a predominantly settled population a literary
tradition would have survived. But all literary activity and even interest have long been as good as non-existent. Nor is any kind of higher education to be found. Nothing beyond the lowest grade of mechanical scholastic teaching is obtainable even in Kashgar and Yarkand. For all education is here
still in the hands of ignorant Mollahs, as it was centuries ago.
The near future holds out no prospect of the very low intellectual level of the Turkish population being raised, for Kashgaria can only look to itself in the matter of schools.
The Chinese Government has never done anything ; nor has
the activity of foreign missionaries hitherto produced any
appreciable result. Not much can be expected from Turkey, the numerous political agents of which, sent from Constanti
nople, have only been uneducated intriguers. The great development of Islam in Hussian Turkestan may perhaps
gradually lead to the improvement of purely Mohammedan learning in East Turkestan ; but that the indirect influence of the Volga Turks will soon make itself felt in the promotion of secular education in the schools of the country does not seem likely. About ten years ago some 2,000 students in winter
and 700 in summer availed themselves of what teaching the schools in Kashgar provided ; but of these not more than
50 per cent, were genuine learners. Yarkand,*^ which till the conquest of East Turkestan by the Chinese was the capital of the country and at the same time its chief seat of learning,
now comes a long way behind Kashgar in the number of its
students ; for in 1895 there were only 200 attending its schools. Neither in Yarkand nor in Kashgar do there seem to be any
public libraries.
Administration. The Chinese administration causes much discontent among the population, because in practice it is
oppressive and very detrimental to the economic prosperity of
the country. The whole weight of taxation falls on the agri
cultural and settled population. All the taxes and dues, if
expressed in money, would not amount to more than two
roubles a head. This sum in itself is not high ; but the burden is so greatly increased by the extortions of officials that it vir
tuall}^ reaches 30 to 40 per cent, of the annual produce of



156 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
the soil. The corruption among the officials, high and low, is
general. The Chinese rulers, who are ignorant of the language
of the natives, treat them with the greatest contempt, and deal
with them only through the medium of Beys and interpreters.
The latter, as chief exploiters of the people, do not show much enthusiasm about bringing their complaints to the ears of the higher authorities.
The nomadic population is much better off, for the Mongols of Karashar and the Kirghiz of Kashgar, Aksu, Sarikol, and
E-askem are in the first place governed by their own chiefs.
The Kirghiz are, moreover, exempted from imperial taxation,
besides enjoying various special privileges. The Chinese Government has followed this policy for the distinct purpose
of conciliating this border population, so as to have their support against foes from without. It has not, however, been successful. The Kirghiz regard this treatment as a sign not
of magnanimity, but of weakness, and as a recognition due to
their own merit. Looking down on the Chinese with com
plete and undisguised contempt, thdy would not hesitate, any more than in earlier years, to join in any insurrection that
might arise. Products and Trade. The products of East Turkestan may
be grouped under fiYQ heads : wheat and maize ; grapes ; cotton ; silk ; cattle and sheep. Of these only the last three are exported : cotton and silk as raw material, animals less as live stock than in the form of manufactured products, as hides, carpets, and felts. The chief market for these exports is Russia ; the next, India. In 1904 the value of the exports to Russia
was 300,000 (four-fifths by way of Osh, one-fifth by way of
Narinskoe) ; of those to India, 100,000. The imports from India, chiefly cotton and silk textiles, were worth 75,000
those from Russia, 325,000. A considerable proportion of the textile imports from India were marked 'Made in Germany '
!
^^'
Trade Routes. Through East Turkestan passes the main
trade route which, having existed from very early times, connects China with the "West. Kashgar forms its centre.
From here the main caravan route passes eastward through
Aksu, Kucha, Turfan, Kumul, Ansichow to the gate in the Great Wall of China near Suchow on the border of the province of Kansu.^"^ The journey from Kashgar to Suchow takes two months and a half (74 days) as tested by Sir Aurel



CENTRAL ASIAN TURKS 157
Stein.'*^ From Kashgar the main caravan route passes west
ward via Osh through Russian territory. Another route leads northward from Kashgar to Narinskoe. There is also a
caravan route connecting Kashgar with India.*^ Starting
from the Punjab via Kabul in Afghanistan and Leh in West Tibet, it crosses the Karakoram range. The route then divides
into two, the one leading to Khotan, the other to Yarkand, which is still the chief mart in Chinese Turkestan as far as
trade with India and Afghanistan is concerned. Silk, porcelain, musk, rhubarb are still regular articles of export from China
passing through Yarkand. From the latter place the route continues till it reaches Kashgar in the north. '''^ Attitude towards non-TuvT^s. The strongest bond of union among the inhabitants of East Turkestan is, as hitherto in all Islamic lands, that of religion. The second unifying bond is
that of their language, to which they give the common name
of Turki. Except as expressed by the latter general term, they are hardly conscious of a racial unity, for they never call
themselves Turks, but only name themselves according to the
separate parts of the country to which they belong. It is primarily difference of language which keeps them aloof from
foreigners. Of the aliens who do not speak Turki, the Arabs
are the only people towards whom they have not this feeling,
and whom they hold in high esteem, doubtless because the language of the Arabs is that of the Kuran. They are also well-disposed towards a section of the Persians : not the Shiite
population of Iran, who seldom come to East Turkestan, but the Sunnite inhabitants of Badakshan, who are covered by the
general name of Tajik. With the Afghans, who have not inconsiderable colonies in Kashgar, Yarkand, and Khotan,
there is a good deal of friction. In spite of community of
religion, there prevails a pronounced hostility towards the
Dungans, the Chinese-speaking Moslems who live in the country and partly also inhabit the valley of the Ili.^^ Here the race feeling is so effective that various conflicts have
taken place between the two elements, though it might have
been expected that both would combine against the common enemy, the Chinese. Hostility to the Chinese themselves is based on all the most potent causes of estrangement : difference
of religion, language, and race, reinforced by the political discontent resulting from the oppressiveness of Chinese rule.



158 THE TURKISH DIVISION
History. We know from early Chinese annalists that a
Chinese protectorate was established in the first century b. c. in East Turkestan ; that it ceased for more than half a century till it was revived in a. d. 76 and lasted till the end of the
Later Han Dynasty (a.d. 25-220). We further know from the evidence of Sir Aurel Stein's archaeological discoveries
(corroborating the accounts of Chinese pilgrims from c. a. d. 400-800) that Buddhism was introduced into the country from India in the second century and lasted till the end of the eighth ; and that the use of an Indian language derived from Sanskrit and an Indian script prevailed there in the early centuries of our era. After the defeat of the Western
Turks in a.d. 658 Chinese sovereignty was restored, and, inter
rupted by a Tibetan occupation (676-9.2), lasted till the middle
of the eighth century. From a.d. 790 the whole of the Tarim basin seems to have been under Tibetan supremacy till a.d.
860, when it was broken by the Uigurs, who established, north
of the T*ien Shan, a powerful kingdom which extended west
ward as far as Aksu and lasted till it was destroyed by
Jenghiz Khan. We have already seen that the south-eastern
branch of the Central Asian Turks first became known under the name of Uigurs. This name penetrated to Europe in the
sixth and seventh centuries, and the Uigurs early came to be regarded as Turks par excellence. Thus they are not men
tioned by the Arabic geographers of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries as Uigurs, but always only as Turks. It is
not till the Mongolian irruption under Jenghiz Khan, with
whom they allied themselves, that the name of Uigur is
revived and we hear of the country of Uiguristan north of the T'ien Shan. The Kudatku Bilik gives the oldest authentic picture of the social conditions of the Turks as drawn by a section of the race itself It shows that the Uigurs were no
longer a nomad people, but were entirely or half settled. It
also shows that there were still some remnants of Shamanism among them. It mentions caravans as coming from China.
In 1220 Jenghiz Khan conquered Turkestan; and in 1389
Timur devastated both that country and Dzungaria. East
Turkestan was visited by the Belgian monk Rubruquis in
1254, by Marco Polo in 1271-5, and in 1603 by Goes, who
noted the Moslem tolerance prevailing among the inhabitants.



CENTEAL ASIAN TUEKS 159
We have already remarked on the absence of religious fanati
cism among them at the present day.
In the seventeenth century there arose a powerful Kalmuk (Mongol) confederation which, expelling the Turkish element from the north-west of the T*ien Shan, extended its rule over the Hi and Issik-kul basins as well as East Turkestan. The Turkish nomads who had been driven southwards wandered during the seventeenth century in the eastern Pamir and
the north-western spurs of the Kum Mountains in the region of Sarikol. In 1758 the Chinese invaded Dzungaria, where
they perpetrated an appalling massacre, and then conquered East Turkestan. Chinese rule here was temporarily overthrown by Moslems from West Turkestan in 1825, 1830, and
1847. An insurrection broke out in 1857, but after the lapse of a few months the Chinese regained possession of East Turkes
tan. In 1864 a Dzungarian outbreak expelled the Chinese, and
an adventurer from Tashkent named Yakub Bey made himself
master of Kashgar. He ruled the country with a strong hand, and not altogether to its disadvantage, till his death in 1877. The dream of a Central Asian Islamic Empire which arose during his dominion then came to an end, for dissensions
among his sons gave the Chinese their opportunity. They
re-established their rule in 1878, and East Turkestan once more became a Chinese province. But the strong Islamic con
nexions brought about with the west, especially Tashkent,
during Yakub Bey's rule, have been maintained, and owing to the great development of Islam in Eussian Turkestan this influence is likely to increase. a. The TarancMs. To the people of East Turkestan belong the
Taranchis, the name given to those Sarts who were transported to the Kulja region by the Chinese after they had gained possession in 1758 of the Hi valley along with East Turkestan.
The nucleus of this Kulja population were Turks who were descended from the Uigurs, and were partly settled here at
the time of the Kalmuk Khans in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Most of them were, however, transferred here as political delinquents from East Turkestan after
the Chinese conquered the valley of the Hi in the middle of
the eighteenth century. The Chinese are stated to have settled
6,000 families of Taranchis at that time on both banks of the Hi. The Taranchis are said to have numbered 40,000 when



160 THE TURKISH DIVISION
Eussia temporarily acquired Kulja ; but when this town and district were again ceded to the Chinese, the majority pre
ferred, together with the Dungans (or Chinese-speaking Moslems), to emigrate to that portion of the Hi region which fell to the Russians. At the present day the Taranchis constitute about two-fifths of the population of Kulja, while their numbe;- in the Russian
province of Semiryechensk^^ amounts to 83,000,^^ being more than three times as great as that of the Dungans.^*
The name Taranchi in Chinese means '
agriculturists
' or 'labourers'. This is the capacity in which they were em
ployed by the Dzungarians in the seventeenth century.
The Taranchis have retained no individual characteristics.
In physical type, occupations, dress, houses, they are not to be
distinguished from the Sarts who live south of the T'ien Shan in East Turkestan. Their language, too, is identical with the
dialect of the Kashgar Sarts, which itself hardly differs from that of the ordinary Sarts.

ii b. West Central Asian Turks
The Central Asian Turks include a group of four steppe nomad tribes, all inhabitants of Asiatic Russia, the Kazak
Kirghiz, the Kara-Kirghiz, the Kara-Kalpaks, and the Turk
mens, who exhibit quite a special civilization. They have
always been described as fierce, unruly marauders, not only by Persian, Chinese, and Russian writers, but by European travellers and scholars as well. Lack of the sense of subordination
is characteristic of them. They represent, however, only an early stage of development that forms a contrast to the cul
tural epoch of settled peoples. They do not live in anarchy,
but in the perfectly regulated conditions of a primitive civilization.



CENTRAL ASIAN TUEKS 161
1. The Kazak- Kirghiz
Habitat. The Kazak-Kirghiz are undoubtedly, both in num
bers and conservative type, the most important nomad people of Turkish descent. They extend over an immense territory stretching from Kulja and Lake Balkhash in the east to the Aral Sea, the Caspian, and the lower Volga in the west, from the sources of the Irtish in the north-east to the Pamir and the Uzbeg country in the south-west. They thus inhabit
a region of nearly 2,000,000 square miles lying roughly between lat. 40 and 55 N. and long. 50 and 80 E. They
everywhere roam in steppes and grassy valleys that afford sustenance to their flocks and herds. Number. This tribe of steppe-dwellers numbered 4,692,384 in IQll.-^^
Name. They never call themselves Kirghiz, but have from
of old called themselves only Kazaks, a word supposed to mean ' rider '. It is only by the Russians that they have by mis
take been named Kirghiz. They should be carefully dis
tinguished from the Kara-Kirghiz, because, though similar in customs and manner of life, they differ in physique and lan
guage. The earliest reference to the name of the Kazaks is to
be found in the Persian poet Firdusi (c. a.d. 1020), who speaks of the Kazak tribes as much-dreaded steppe marauders, all mounted and armed with lances.^*^ Since the eighteenth cen
tury the Russians have used the compound expression Kirghiz:
Kaza^k chiefly in order to distinguish them from their own Cossacks. Scholars and official writers also employ this term to differentiate the Kazaks from the Kirghiz proper (or Kara
Kirghiz).^' The first European to mention the Kirghiz by
name was Siegmund Herberstein (1486-1566), who speaks of
them as Tatars, that is, as a people of Turkic rather than of
Mongolian stock.
Language. The Kazaks, though inhabiting so vast a territory, form so individiial a linguistic unit that there is hardly any difference of dialect between the Kazaks on the Caspian
and those on the upper Irtish. The universal prevalence of
a nearly pure variety of Turkish speech throughout the Kazak
steppes is almost sufficient to show that the Turkish element
must at all times have been in the ascendant. But though the
language is purely Turkish in structure, it contains not only TURANIANS L



162 THE TURKISH DIVISION
many Mongolian, Persian, and even Arabic words, but also
some words unknown to the Mongols and perhaps borrowed
from Palaeo- Siberians who had been partly absorbed by them.
Racial Affinities. The Kazaks in their whole extent, not
only linguistically but also politico-socially, are so unified that they can be called a single people. Their manners, customs,
mode of life, and character are ever3nyhere strikingly similar. They have always and everywhere the same consciousness of belonging to the people of the Kazaks. All this divides them
sharply from every other Turkish people. Their physique shows that they have an admixture of Mongolian and to a less extent
of Iranian blood. The Mongolian element is due to their
having mingled with the Volga Kalmuks in the west and the
Dzungarian Kalmuks in the east. Thus, though ethnically they represent rather the Mongolian type of features, they retain the primitive Turkish speech of their race unimpaired.
The Mongolian type is, however, not so pronounced as in the Altaian Turks (p. 141, 1). They have, it is true, broad, flat faces, but the forehead is not so receding as with the Kalmuks; the cheek-bones are less prominent, while the nose is more so. They have a small mouth, narrow slits of eyes,
though not oblique, and a scanty beard. The head is brachy
cephalic, and the hair long and black. The complexion is
dirty brown or swarthy, often of a yellowish tinge. But beside this Mongolian type there are in almost all families single individuals with an entirely different physiognomy : these
have oval faces, thick, bushy eyebrows, strong beards, prominent curved noses, and occasionally fair complexions. Such modifications of the fundamental type are probably due to Finno-Ugrian influence in the north, and Iranian in the south.
The normal Kazaks are of medium height, broad-shouldered, thick-set, often with a bull-like neck. They are frequently
corpulent when advanced in years. Their gait is lumbering, but on horseback they are agile, active, and enduring. Their
eyesight is very keen, for they are accustomed continually to observe surrounding nature. They are thus able for days to follow the track of a lost animal. Character and Habits. In character the Kazaks are honest
and trustworthy, but they are heavy, sluggish, sullen, unfriendly, and inhospitable. They are excellent riders, horsemanship being their chief amusement. They are more war



CENTRAL ASIAN TURKS 163
like than their kinsmen the Kara-Kirghiz. They are hardy
and long-lived, but, largely no doubt owing to their dirty habits, they suffer a good deal from diseases such as ophthalmia,
small-pox, and syphilis. They are naturally musical and
poetical, having a number of national songs ^^ which are usually
repeated from mouth to mouth with variations, and are sung to the accompaniment of the flute and an instrument called
the balalaika. In summer the Kazaks spend most of their
time in sleep or in drinking Jcumiss, followed at night by feasting and the recital of tales varied with songs. Though they receive a certain amount of instruction from Mollahs, reading
and still more writing are rare accomplishments among them.
Nomadism. The Kazaks are genuine nomads : they wander
about the steppes without fixed libodes, always setting up their tents where there is food for their flocks. It is not an aimless roaming in the steppes like that of the hunters in the Tundras and forests of north Siberia. This would be impossible with such large herds as those of the Kazaks, because the interests of neighbours would constantly clash. Hence a definite division of the land takes place : a tribe regards a certain territory
as its property, and brooks no intrusion. The tribe again con
sists of clans, and these of subdivisions, which regard certain
sections of the greater territory as belonging to them. In winter either a forest tract or a deep valley sheltered from the wind is resorted to. Here they are altogether confined to the tent, and undergo endless discomforts. In summer, on the other hand, open level tracts, well- watered and not infested by insects, are sought after. It is on the winter abodes that the
density of the nomad population depends ; hence all conflicts and warlike expeditions of Kazak hordes during past centuries are to be regarded as due to pressure for the obtainment of the best winter quarters. In recent times, under Russian rule, definite districts have been assigned to them, and a regulated condition of property has taken the place of the former less
definite state of things. Now every Kazak family has a winter territory which lies within exactly fixed boundaries and can
only be transferred by legal sale. The price of the winter
tract varies according to its quality, and it is the endeavour of every well-to-do Kazak to improve and add to his winter tract.
The summer seats, on the other hand, are the property of the
clan as a whole. For these the Kazak generally starts from L2



164 THE TURKISH DIVISION
his winter abodes with his flocks and herds about the middle
of April. The return takes place, usually by the same route,
in the middle of August. There is an autumn sojourn of
a month on the way (about September 15 to October 15),
the winter quarters being taken up at the beginning of
November.
Dwellings. The Kazaks live exclusively in yurtas or circu
lar tents, consisting of a light wooden framework covered with felt or red cloth, and provided with an opening above for light
and ventilation. An invariable feature of the yurta is a large
iron pot in the centre. ^ Clothing. The Kazaks . wear a flowing robe fastened with a silk or leather girdle, which holds a knife, tobacco-pouch, and other necessaries. They also wear wide pantaloons made of
cloth, silk, or leather. Food. The Kazaks live chiefly on boiled mutton, in the cooking of which they are unexcelled. They also eat the flesh
of horses and goats. They make butter and cheese from the
milk chiefly of sheep, less commonly from that of cows. From fermented mare's milk they produce Jcumiss, which is their universal drink and which they consume in large quantities.
Occupations. The chief occupation of the Kazaks is the
breeding of iive classes of animals : camels, horses, sheep, goats, cattle. They raise camels only in small numbers, but keep far more horses than are required, probably because the Kazaks are a nation of riders. They breed only one kind of sheep, the fat-tailed variety. These are strong and very fleshy, but the wool yielded by their fleece is very hard. The
tail is often very heavy, and has to be dragged on the ground ; a kind of cart, with two wheels is accordingly attached below
it for its support. Some of the wealthy Kazaks own as many
as 20,000 of these large fat- tailed sheep. The vast herds and flocks are the chief property of the Kazak. They are at the same time his sole means of existence. Their loss means to him death by starvation. Their relative importance is well
expressed in his greeting, ' Are your animals and your people
well?' On their products he depends not only for food, but for clothing and even housing. The chief industries are there
fore skin-dressing and weaving. The wool is turned into felt, which for firmness is superior to that of the Kalmuks and
Mongols. It is used for covering the yurtas, for mattresses.



CENTEAL ASIAN TUEKS 165
and for other things into which it can be made. A large
amount of this felt is exported to Central Asia and Eussia.
Six kinds of carpets are made out of the fine felt. They are
coloured with vegetable dyes produced in the country or with
dyes bought from the Eussians. Tanned lambskins are exported to Eussia in great quantities/ Of lambskins the
Kazaks also make furs and caps. They make their own riding
trousers exclusively of goatskins, which they also export in large numbers to Eussian villages. There are among the
Kazaks also a few workers in silver, copper, and iron. Trade is confined among them mainly to the exchange of live stock,
skins, felts, and carpets for woven and other goods from Eussia, East Turkestan, and China.
Three gi^eat Divisions or Hordes. An old division''^ of the Kazaks is that into three hordes called Jws (' hundred '), which
are subdivided into tribes and clans down to communities of ^YQ to fifteen tents. 1. The great Horde comprises the nomads south of Lake
Balkhash between the Chinese frontier east of Lake Issik-kul and the Yaxartes (Sir Darya). It is subdivided into a large
number of clans.*^''
2. The middle Horde occupies the steppe to the north of the great Horde between the upper Tobol and the upper
Irtish. It comprises fiYQ tribes (subdivided into many clans) : the Argyn, quite in the north of the steppe, on the middle Irtish, Tobol, and Ishim ; the Naiman, south of the Argyn, on the middle Irtish, from the Chinese frontier to Lake Balkhash ; the Kipchak in the north-western part of the steppe
near the rivers Turgai, Uhagan, Tobol, Uya, as far as the town of Troitsk ; the Kirai, mostly on the upper Irtish in Chinese
territory ; and the Kongrat, chiefly in the neighbourhood of Tashkent. 3. The little Horde are the nomads of the western steppe
only, wandering mainly between the Aral and the Caspian.
It consists of the large tribe called Alshin and an association of
seven clans. A part of the Alshin tribe in 1801 migrated into the Government of Astrakhan, and forms the so-called ' Inner Horde '.. All the Kazaks of the three hordes count the mythical Alash-khan as their tribal ancestor, and all three use AlasJi as their watchword. Each clan also uses the name of one of its



166 THE TURKISH DIVISION
remote clan ancestors as its special watchword, and has its
special insignia and its own genealogy.^^ Organization. Though the Kazaks have been completely subject to Russia since the eighteenth century, the tribal and
clan organization still remains fairly strong. They still choose
their own Khans, who are confirmed by the Russian Govern
ment, but possess little authority beyond their respective
tribes. The real rulers are the elders of clans appointed by
public election. Brigandage and raids arising out of tribal
or clan feuds were formerly recognized institutions, but are
now severely punished. But though, since their subjection to Russia, the Kazaks have become less lawless, they have scarcely
become less nomadic. A change of habit in this respect is opposed not only to their tastes, but to the conditions of the country which they inhabit. All the tribes are thus so essentially nomadic that they cannot adopt a settled life without losing their sense of nationality and being absorbed in the
Russian population. Religion. The Kazaks adopted Islam about a. d. 1500, and
are adherents of the Sunnite sect. But though Mohamme
danism has destroyed the religious side of their civili
zation, except the cult of the hearth, their belief is lax.
They have few Mollahs, no Mosques or regular prayers, and
they make few pilgrimages to Mecca ; but they revere the tombs of saints, which are a prominent feature in the steppe land
scape. The chief prescription of the Kuran for which they
show respect is polygamy. They are really Shamanists at heart, worshipping besides the Kudai, or good divinity, the Shaitan, or bad spirit. They have a strong belief in the talchi,
or soothsayer, and other charlatans.
History. The Kazaks (a well as the Kara-Kirghiz) seem, from ancient times, to have been at home in the same parts
of Central Asia as they still occupy. They are already men
tioned by Zemarchos, who traversed their country on his way
to the Altai, as nomads on more or less the same steppes as those on which they wander to-day. They were probably in
possession of the great steppe to the north of Yaxartes (Sir
Darya) long before the time of Jenghiz (1162-1227),. under
whose sway they came and under whom (as well as Timur) they fought. After Jenghiz Khan's death they fell to the share of his eldest son Juji, head of the Golden Horde, but con



CENTRAL ASIAN TURKS 167
tinned to retain their own Khans. When the Uzbegs acquired
the ascendancy many of the former subjects of the Juji and
Jagatai hordes seceded and joined the Kazaks. Thus about A.D. 1500 the Kazaks formed a powerful state, having under
their Khan Arslan, as stated by the Sultan Babar^^ (14831530), the founder in 1526 of the Mogul dynasty in India, as many as 400,000 fighting men. Their numbers continued to be swelled by fragments of the Grolden Horde, such as the Kipchaks and others. The middle and the little Hordes of the Kazaks voluntarily submitted in 1730 to the Empress
Anne of Russia. Most of the great Horde were subdued by
Yanus Khan of Ferghana in 1798, and all the still independent j
tribes finally accepted Russian sovereignty in 1819. During the centuries when the hordes of the Kazaks lived in perfect freedom between the extreme limits of the Russian and the Chinese empires, which were not yet strong enough to
attempt to subject them, they never showed the capacity of
uniting to a single power and of forming an organized political state. They lacked the fundamental requisite, the force of
a common interest, which alone would have been capable of
combining their tribes and clans. The power of the Khan was nowhere able to guarantee their property to individuals
or to protect them from the irruptions of neighbours, for it was far beyond his capacity to rule the vast territory nominally subject to him. The power of wild hordes surrounding a leader
of this kind became effective only when they invaded a hostile
territory : motives of self-preservation in face of subjected foes forced the single tribes to hold together, the whole horde being transformed into an army, as was the case during the
invasions of Jenghiz Khan. The Kazak hordes have had no
opportunities for such temporary consolidation during the last
two centuries. Every tribe, having otherwise no interest in
looking beyond its own borders, always aimed at the obtain
ment of as much prosperity as possible. It therefore resorted
to arms only when the advancement of its prosperity impelled
it to do so, or when the political circumstances of neighbours
promised rapid acquisition of great wealth by means of predatory attack. Marauding excursions in the unlimited steppe,
the conflicts and insurrections of which the history of the
Kazaks consists in previous centuries, would have completely
ruined any settled people. But for the nomads it was a period



168 THE TURKISH DIVISION
of prosperity : it was just under these circumstances that the wealth and the prestige of the Kazaks increased. But since peace and quiet have entered the Kirghiz steppe, there has
been a steady decline in the prosperity of the Kazak tribes, increasing with the progress of order. That the warlike and
marauding spirit has not been extinguished among them by
Russian rule is indicated by what happened in 1916 among
their kinsmen, the Kara-Kirghiz.^^ Their turbulent spirit may very well revive with the resumption of political independence. In the beginning of 1918 Russian Turkestan was reported ^'^ to have declared itself a republic as a federal state of Russia. Five months later a meeting of Bolshevist delegates, including fifty Mohammedans, declared that Turkestan should be autonomous, but federated to Russia.

2. The Kara-Kirghiz
Habitat. The Kara-Kirghiz live chiefly in the Government
of Semiryechensk, especially in the region south of Lake Issik-kul, on the slopes of the T'ien Shan, extending from the
river Tekes westwards towards Khokand and the rivers Chu and Talas; southwards to the Pamir plateau and to the northern slopes of the Karakoram range ; and eastwards into the district
of Sarikol in the western parts of Chinese Turkestan. The
western limits of the present territory of the Kara-Kirghiz are
the watersheds of the rivers Chatkal and Talas. On the east they extend beyond Aksu into Chinese territory. In the south they reach to the neighbourhood of Shahid-ullah on the road from Leh to Yarkand. Number. Their numbers exceed 400,000/^ of whom the great majority are found in the Government of Semiryechensk.



CENTRAL ASIAN TURKS 169
Name. The Kara-Kirghiz or ' Black '
Kirghiz appear to be
so called from the colour of their tents.^^ They call themselves
simply Kirghiz. The name is already mentioned in the sixth century in the form of Kherkis by Zemarchos ^"^ in his account
of the embassy sent by the Emperor Justin II to the Altai. By
the Mongols and Chinese they are called Bur-ut.^"^
Race. The Kara-Kirghiz, having remained almost entirely unmixed, are on the whole the purest and best representatives of the Turkish race. It is to them alone that the distinctive
national name of Kirghiz strictly belongs/'^ Branches. There are two main branches of the KaraKirghiz, the Sal (' left ') in the west, between the head streams of the Talas and the Oxus in Ferghana and Bokhara,
where they come in contact with the Galchas, or Highland Tajiks; and the Ong ('right'), who are much less numerous, in the east, on both sides of the T'ien Shan about Lake Issik
kul, and in the Chu, Tekes, and Narim (upper Yaxartes) valleys.
Each of these branches is divided into six or more tribes.*^*^
Occupations. The Kara-Kirghiz are essentially nomads,
whose chief occupation is stock-breeding. Some, however, engage in agriculture, growing wheat, barley, and millet. They trade chiefly by barter, cattle being exchanged for manufactures from Turkestan, China, and Russia. Their industries differ only slightly from those of the Kazaks. Their
domestic animals and their daily pursuits are also much the
same. They breed camels, horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. Their method of encamping is described by Radloflf '^ as differing from that of the Kazaks. In winter they encamp in whole clans on the banks of rivers in an uninterrupted series of yurtas, often extending to several miles in length. In
summer they similarly encamp in rows of yurtas as they move
higher and higher into the mountains, each clan thus using
a particular strip of pasture. This method of nomad encamping is partly due to the geographical conditions of the country, but also to the warlike character of the people itself. It enables a whole army in a few hours to be ready for attack or defence. That their turbulent spirit can easily be aroused is shown by the Russian official account "^^ (printed below as
Appendix B) of a rising of the Kara-Kirghiz which took place
in August, 1916. The instigator of this revolt appears to have
been the German emissarj^, Dr. Werner Otto von Hentig, as



170 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
indicated by a notice in The T'imes of June 12, 1917, and
printed below as Appendix A, p. 229. Government. The Kara-Kirghiz are governed by tribal
rulers elected by themselves, who enjoy unlimited authority
and with whom the Eussian administration interferes but
little.
History. Having played a much less important part in political events than the Kazaks, the Kara-Kirghiz are very
seldom mentioned in history. Their name in its present form occurs for the first time, as stated above, in the sixth century after Christ. They are mentioned in Chinese chronicles of the thirteenth century as living on the T'ien Shan. It is therefore likely that the Kara-Kirghiz have inhabited this region since
then down to the present time.

3. The Kara-Kalpaks
Habitat. The Kara-Kalpaks, or ' Black-caps ', inhabit chiefly the territory to the south-east of the Sea of Aral and on the
eastern side of the lower course of the Amu Darya (Oxus). Number. They number 134,313 altogether in Eussian
Turkestan. The majority (111,425) live in the Amu Darya division of the Sir Darya province, forming 50 per cent, of the
population of that division. The rest live in the Khanate and in the Khokand district of the province of Ferghana (22,888).
Name. Their name of ' Black-caps
' has been given to them in allusion to their high sheepskin hats.
Characteristics. The Kara-Kalpaks of the pure type, who
live near the Aral Sea, are a tall, powerful race, with broad, flat faces, large eyes, short noses, and heavy chins. Their
women are described as the most beautiful in Eussian Tur
kestan. They are pacific by temperament, and have conse
quently suffered much from the attacks of their fierce nomadic
neighbours, the Kazak-Kirghiz. Manner of Life. The Kara-Kalpaks are still to a certain extent nomads, with large herds of cattle ; but they are on the
whole a peaceful agricultural people. History. They are mentioned by the Eussian annalist Nestor
(eleventh century) by the name of ' Black Hats ', along with the Turkmens, as neighbours of the Eussians. Later they



CENTRAL ASIAN TURKS 171
ruled for a time at Kazan on the middle Volga. Afterwards
they moved from that region to Central Asia. The raids of
the Kazak-Kirghiz drove them several times to move their
abodes, till ultimately they sought refuge under Russian sovereignty in 1742. In the first half of the eighteenth century they were still located at the mouths of the Sir Darya, but
now they are mostly to be found in the delta bf the Oxus, and only sporadically in the district of Zarafshan.

4. The Turkmens
Habitat. The Turkmens have from time immemorial been settled in their present home, the steppe region between the Oxus and the Caspian, extending from the north of the latter
sea south-eastwards, bounded by Persia and Afghanistan in the south, and the Khanates of Khiva and Bokhara on the east. Their chief habitat is thus the Province of Transcaspia. Here there seem never to have been other nomads than the Turkmens. There are also some Turkmen tribes in the Oxus plains of Afghan Turkistan (the northernmost province of
Afghanistan) ; in Persian territory near the Hari Rud (not far from the Afghan frontier) as well as in the Persian province of
Astarabad (near the south-east corner of the Caspian) ; and in Turkey itself, scattered over the central plain of Anatolia. Number. The number of Turkmens in the Russian Empire
was 290,170 in 1911.'^ No figures seem to be available for the
Turkmens of Persia, Afghanistan, and Turkey, but it may be conjectured that their total number does not exceed 350,000.
Name. Turkmen is the correct form of the name, Turcoman being merely a variation in spelling. As Turks par excellence
they have probably retained the name because, according to
tradition, at the tim^. of Oghuz Khan all Turks were called
Turkmen ('Turkdom').
Characteristics. In physical type the Turkmens are Turks
in the most proper sense. Though they belong to the group of
the west-central Turks, they form a link with the western
Turks, not differing essentially from the Azarbaijans of Persia
and the Osmanlis of Anatolia, except that down to the Russian occupation of Merv (1883) they retained the condition of pre



172 THE TURKISH DIVISION
datory, horse-riding nomads, who were greatly feared by their neighbours as ' man-stealing Turks '. Until their subjection
by the Russians, the Turkmens were a warlike people, who conquered their neighbours. It was their boast that not one Persian had crossed their frontier except with a rope round his neck.
Now they have become a peaceful population. Among the
early Arabic writers who mention them, Mas*udi (943-8) speaks of the Turkmens as thick-set and with small eyes, and
as much feared by their neighbours owing to their power.
There can be no doubt that by the people whom they call
' Ghuz '
(derived from an earlier Oghuz) they meant the Turk
mens of to-day. For Rashid-ed-din Tabibi, the genealogist of the Turkish race, at the beginning of his account of their origin,
remarks, ' At that time the whole people of Oghuz still goes
by the name of Turkmen.' The names Ohuz and Turkmen were also in alternative use, for while the Byzantines and
Arabs prefer to speak of the Uz or Ghuz, Nestor, in the eleventh century, speaks of the Turkmens as neighbours of
the Kara-Kalpaks, and the name Turkmen or Turcoman was
not unknown to the writers who describe the crusades. Tribes. The Turkmens are divided into seven main tribes, each of which consists of several clans. They are the fol
lowing : (1) The Chaudors, the remains of a powerful tribe which in the sixteenth century occupied a considerable part of the terri
tory of the east coast of the Caspian. They now wander in the
steppe north of Karabugas Bay.
(2) The Yamut chiefly inhabit the south-east coast of the
Caspian. A considerable part of them have settled in the
island of Cheleken, and have exchanged cattle-breeding for
the petroleum industry which prevails there. A fraction of this tribe is to be found half-settled in the Khanate of Khiva, especially in the south-western part, whither they seem to
have been forcibly transplanted as colonists at the beginning of the nineteenth century. (3) The GoMens live in the mountains near the upper course of the Atrak river, in the territory of the Shah of Persia, to
whom they pay, or used to pay, tribute. They are said to be
the most civilized and friendly of all the Turkmens. As occupying the richest pasture-land on the northern edge of



CENTRAL ASIAN TUEKS 173
Persia, they have from early times suffered much from the attacks of the Persians as well as the Kurds. (4) The Tekkes are first heard of in the peninsula of Mangishlak on the north-eastern coast of the Caspian. They were driven out of it by the Kalmuks in 1718. Later they occupied the Akhal oasis, extending south-eastwards from Kizil-Arvat along the Persian frontier, and the oasis of Merv. They were
the most important Turkmen tribe when the Russians con
quered Transcaspia. They suffered a crushing defeat at Goktepe in 1881. (5) The SmiJcs have at all times lived on the middle Murghab from Yolatan to the western spurs of the Paropamisus range,
in the neighbourhood of Penjdeh. They seem to be first mentioned towards the end of the fifteenth century. They are divided into five branches, which are again split into lesser clans. Their number has been greatly reduced by the severe conflicts in which they have been engaged during the nineteenth century with the Tekkes and the Salors, as well as the Persians. (6) The Salors are accounted the oldest and noblest of the Turkmen tribes. Salor is the name of the great-grandson of the mythical Oghuz Khan. It is known that the Salors came
in contact with the Arabs when the latter were advancing towards the Oxus in the seventh century. Later, Salor was accounted a collective name for all the Turkmens. Thus they were the first of the Turkmen tribes to appear on the stage of
history, and they have preserved their generic name longest.
From ancient times they have remained in their old home in the western corner of the Paropamisus range. They are also
found scattered in groups, north, south, and east of Merv. A section of them migrated, in 1857, into Persian territory on
the left bank of the Hari Rud near the Afghan frontier. They
suffered much during the nineteenth century in conflict with the Tekkes. It is not likely that they will long maintain their identity as a warlike independent tribe of nomads. (7) The Ersaris in the middle of the sixteenth century were near the south-west coast of the Caspian, and a century later
in the Mangishlak peninsula, whence they were driven by a tribe of Uzbegs into the steppe in the south of the IJst-Yurt
plateau. In the beginning of the eighteenth century they are found, subject to Bokhara, on the left bank of the Oxus, where



174 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
they still live, from Khwaja Salar to Kerki, near which place they
are most numerous, while farther up the river there are but few
of them. They are in a stage of transition to a settled mode
of life, and with the adoption of agriculture are losing their
warlike spirit as well as many traits of their nomad tradition.
There are, besides these seven main tribes, several scattered
half-nomadic groups of Turkmens, living on the Volga, in the
district of Amu Darya, and in the region of Zarafshan, Astrakhan, and Sir Darya. All these Vambery estimated at about
16,000 in the aggregate. The population of the seven main tribes is greatly over-estimated by him, as the total of his
figures amounts to nearly one million Turkmens."^*

5. The Sarts
Habitat. Interposed in the chain of the west-central group
of Turks lies a mixed Turkish people, the Sarts, who occupy
the territory which, lying on both sides of the Sir Darya (Yaxartes), extends from Samarkand in the west to beyond Tashkent in the east. The great majority are found in Ferghana, nearly all the rest in the territories of Sir Darya and Samarkand. Number, In population the Sarts take the second place among the Turkish peoples of Asiatic Russia, coming next to the Kazaks with 1,847,000. There are 1,392,167 in Ferghana, 359,744 in the territory of Sir Darya, and 73,634 in that of Samarkand. Eace. They are a mixed race based on the original Iranian
inhabitants of the fertile parts of Turkestan, who have inter
mingled with their conquerors, the Turkish Uzbegs. They are sharply divided in their type from the remaining Turkish inhabitants of Central Asia, resembling completely the Persian
speaking Tajiks in build, swarthy complexion, large expressive black eyes, straight nose, average mouth, even straight teeth, bushy black brows, and very strong beards. Their physical type and the fact that at Khojend and Samarkand they speak Persian combine to show that the Iranians and not the Turks were the fundamental element in this population. They them
selves know nothing of their origin.

Name, This people are called Sart both by the Kazaks and
the Uzbegs, their surrounding neighbours. The name Sart is given by the Eussians both to the Turkish language spoken in
Bokhara, Samarkand, and Ferghana and to the people speaking it, as opposed to Tajik,'^^ which denotes the Iranian agri
cultural population immediately to the south of the territory occupied by the Sarts. The term is not properly an ethno
logical name. It is found in the Turkish work Kudaiku Bilik (eleventh century) in the sense of ' merchant V^ because at this time and still earlier Iranian merchants from the Oxus traded among the Turks. Hence the word Sart (from old
Turkish ' to wander ') came to be used for (Iranian) ' merchant '
and finally for (non-nomad) ' agricultural Iranian '. Contrast with Tajik, His nearest kinsman, the Tajik, representing the pure Iranian, besides retaining his Iranian physique, retains his Iranian language also. The Sart, while
retaining much of his original type, speaks Turkish through
out. He has, however, lost what is still to be found among
the Tajiks, and is their chief peculiarity a graceful carriage.
The Sarts also show less individuality, being unusually alike and uniform.
Occupation, As occupation the Sarts prefer trade or light work ; but they like complete inactivity best. Religion. Like their pure Turkish neighbours, the Sarts in
religion are Mohammedan Sunnites.

Here may be mentioned two Turkish tribes inhabiting the
region of the Yaxartes (Sir Darya).
6. The Kipchaks
The Kipchaks are a half-nomadic tribe inhabiting the north
of Ferghana, especially the district of Andijan and Osh, in the
region south of the upper Sir Darya, forming about 10 per
cent, of the population of the former Khanate of Khokand. They consist of purely Turkish elements from Central Asia.
They are perhaps more correctly to be regarded as a clan of
the Kara-Kirghiz, and should be called Kirghiz-Kipchaks. Although they are partly settled, they have preserved the wild and warlike spirit of complete nomads. In all the feuds, wars.

7. The Kuramas
The Kuramas are a completely settled people living on the
banks of the Chirchik and the Angren, tributaries of the Yaxartes. They consist of a mixture of impoverished Kazaks,
who have been forced to settle, and of Sarts or perhaps Uzbegs.
At the present day they form the most industrious part of the
population of the middle Yaxartes. Their name Kurama in Turkish means 'mixture'. Their numbers are quoted by Vambery from Kostenko (of the general staff in Russian
Turkestan) as 77,301. As they are not mentioned in the census lists of Asiatic Russia, they are perhaps, in the latter work, included among the Sarts.

8. The Uzbegs
Habitat. The Uzbegs occupy the country which extends from about long. 72 E. along the east side of the Oxus, and
from about lat. 41 N. also on the west side down to the Aral Sea, being bounded on the latter side by the territory of the
Turkmens. They are the predominating population of the province of Samarkand, and of some parts of the provinces of Ferghana and Sir Darya. In the Khanates of Khiva and Bokhara, where the Turkish element forms the great majority, the proportion of Uzbegs is great. In Khiva, where the Turks in general form 99 per cent, of the whole population, the
Uzbegs number 65 per cent. ; while in Bokhara, of the 67 per cent, of Turks, about one half (or about 33 per cent, of
the whole population) are Uzbegs. A considerable part of the population of the towns of Afghan Turkistan (the most
northern province of Afghanistan) are of Uzbeg stock. Number. The number of Uzbegs in Russian Asia amounts



CENTRAL ASIAN TURKS 177
to 592,150.'^^ To these must be added the Uzbegs in Afghani
stan, estimated by Vambery at 200,000, making an aggregate of about 800,000 Uzbegs. The numbers of the Uzbegs in the three territories of Russian Turkestan in which they live are :
Samarkand, 490,143 ; Sir Darya, 76,784 ; Ferghana, 25,223.
Name. The term Uzbeg is not an ethnological, but a politi
cal name. It is derived from Uzbeg Khan, who ruled the
Golden Horde till 1340, and who was a great propagator of Islam. So ' Uzbeg ' in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
came to mean Moslem Turks, as opposed to those who still
remained in the rough civilization associated with Shamanism.
At the beginning of the sixteenth century this name was
assumed by the adherents of Shabani Khan, the last conqueror
of Transoxiana. Finally it was employed as the designation of the ruling tribes in the Central Asian Khanates (much as Osmanli in Turkey), in opposition to Kirghiz and Sarts as well as to non-Turkish tribes. Race. The Uzbegs are of Turkish origin, but they are
a mixed race, the elements of which are, however, for the most part various Turkish clans. The army with which Shabani
Khan invaded Transoxiana from the lower Yaxartes on the north-east consisted chiefly of Turkish nomads inhabiting the tract between the Aral Sea and the river Ural. The population which they here found and conquered was itself a Turkish one,
with some Mongolian admixture, who had reached a more
advanced civilization, and who described the northern Turkish invaders as naked barbarians, denouncing their vandalism in
destroying many works of art in Samarkand. The Turkish
amalgam produced by the conquest gradually adopted from the
conquering element the name of Uzbeg, which thus acquired the value of an ethnic designation for the Turks of Transoxiana. The inhabitants of Khiva, on the left bank of the Oxus, are, with the exception of the Turkmens and a few Sarts in the
towns, Uzbegs throughout. In Bokhara the Uzbegs, on both
banks of the Zarafshan, as well as in the southern and western
districts, form the preponderant part of the agricultural popu
lation. A similar remark applies to the Uzbegs of Kunduz,
Khulm, Akcha, Shibarghan, Andkhui, and Maimana in Afghan
territory. There are said to be thirty- two clans among the Uzbegs. "When sections of the same clan have become locally separated, TURANIANS M



178 THE TURKISH DIVISION
the bond of kinship is by no means so strong among the
ITzbegs as, for example, among Turkmens and Kirghiz. Characteristics. It is impossible to give a general account of a specifically Uzbeg type, because of the influence exercised
by the admixture, in different localities, of Tajik, Sart, Persian, and Afghan blood. Thus the Uzbegs, even in different parts of Khiva, may to some extent be distinguished. Here the
Uzbeg may be described as taller than the Kirghiz and more thick-set than the Turkmens, but not so tall and not so strongly built as the Kara-Kalpak. The head of the Khiva Uzbeg has
an oval shape, his eyes are elongated, his nose is mostly thick,
his mouth large, his chin round, his cheek-bones not specially prominent, and his complexion much fairer than that of the Tajiks. His hair is more abundant than that of the Turkmens, and its colour is predominantly brown. The Uzbegs of Bokhara
show traces of a more intensive mixture with the original Aryan inhabitants, for dark hair and skin is much more frequent than in Khiva, while the Uzbegs of Khokand are
scarcely to be distinguished from the Sarts living there.
Ujfalvy^^ gives the following general description of the
Uzbeg. He is of medium height, thin, with a dark-brown
skin tinged with yellow ; his hair is black, red, and rarely
chestnut brown f^ his beard sparse and black, his nose short,
straight, and broad at the base, his lips thick and protruding, his brows arched but rather scanty, his mouth large, his chin massive, his cheek-bones prominent, his whole face inclined to be square, his ears large and prominent, his hands and feet small. Vambery^^ thinks that a generalization such as this can hardly be accepted, owing to local variations observed by
himself and to the divergent impressions made on different travellers by the external appearance of the Uzbegs.
Besides still retaining many genuine Turkish customs, such
as subdivision into clans, the Uzbegs preserve most of the
attractive qualities of their Turkish kinsmen. The uniform
basis of their character is honesty, independence, and gravity. They regard swift bodily movement as degrading, and consider slow action of the limbs and stony expressionlessness of face to be essential elements of decorum. "With these qualities their
mental sluggishness harmonizes, and they are consequentl}^ taken advantage of by the more alert Tajik. The Uzbeg's ideal is the fearless and loyal warrior, straight in speech and



CENTRAL ASIAN TUEKS 179
action. He has consequently been averse to peaceful occupa
tion and the cultivation of arts and sciences. He looks down on the Tajik artisan and merchant as an inferior being. He
does not even regard very highly his Mollah or spiritual teacher. His lower intellectual capacity is shown by the fact
that in the colleges of Khiva and Bokhara, Uzbeg theological
students are regularly found to be surpassed in ability by those of Tajik descent.
In compensation for these weak points the Uzbeg shows
many fine traits in his family life. He treats his wife much better than the Tajik does, and the deference paid by children,
even when advanced in years, to their parents is striking. Though in public intercourse the rules of Islam prevail among them, in private, within the walls of their dwellings, the prac
tices of primitive nomadic life still survive, little affected by the Iranian Moslem civilization in the midst of which the Uzbegs have lived for centuries.
Mode of Life. In their manner of life the Uzbegs are
partly settled and partly half-nomads. The former, found
chiefly in the Khanates, are engaged almost exclusively in
agriculture, only very few carrying on trade or industry. They are specially numerous along the Zarafshan river, and above all along the left bank of the Oxus in Khiva, where the
Uzbeg husbandman is a model of his order. He is thoroughly versed in the very important art of irrigation, and is devoted
to his occupation. The Uzbeg generally cultivates his own
fields, and it is difficult to realize that this simple, honest
peasant represents a conquering race. But he has remained
a warrior down to modern times, and this same peasant who
follows his plough is still ready to leap into the saddle, and,
sword in hand, to fight vigorously against his enemies. The
Uzbegs in fact form the fighting men in Khiva, Bokhara, and on the left bank of the Oxus. In the latter locality they have suffered a good deal in conflict with the still more warlike
Afghans. Showing little aptitude for trade or industry, the Uzbeg
prefers an open-air life, living in isolated settlements, where he pitches his felt-covered tent in a court surrounded by high
walls, liking it better even in winter than a fixed abode. The
nomad life would still appeal to him most if circumstances
permitted him to follow it. The number of complete nomads
M2



180 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
among the Uzbegs is, however, extremely small, being at the present day almost exclusively limited to the left bank of the
Oxus in Afghan Turkistan. The number of half-nomads is
considerably larger, because every Uzbeg is biassed in favour
of this mode of life, and is ready to spend the summer in the open with his flocks and herds. But if the Uzbegs remain
under Eussian rule they will doubtless in the end completely
settle down to agriculture and other peaceful occupations, as
the Tatars of Kazan and Astrakhan have done.
Language. The language of the Uzbegs is called Jagatai
from the name of Jenghiz Khan's son, which came to be applied not only to the Central Asian dominions ruled by him, but to the Turkish language spoken by the inhabitants of that
region. The term Jagatai should properly be restricted to the
early literary records, which are written in the Uigur language
of the earliest Turkish settled inhabitants of Central Asia who came from the east. The Uzbeg language is the result of the dialect of the Turkish invaders from the north being grafted on the older Jagatai. Literature. Uzbeg literature, that is, the modern Turkish
literature of Central Asia, is only a popular literature, which cannot compete with the superior Persian literature of Central Asia. It consists chiefly of religious and chivalrous tales derived from Moslem legend and the popular poetry of the
nomads, especially the Kirghiz, adapted to the somewhat more
refined taste of the Khanates. The historical works are for the most part annals of Khiva and translations from Persian or Arabic. Civilization. Owing to the different influences to which the
Uzbegs of the Khanates have been subject and the varying length of time since they have become settled, their civilization
is not uniform. Those who live on the lower Oxus and on its left bank have preserved more traces of their old Turkish ways
than their kinsmen in Bokhara, Khokand, and East Turkestan.
Again, the Uzbeg of Khiva, the most genuine representative of the race, observes many practices of the Persian civilization
of the ancient state of Khwarizm (Khiva). This indicates that Turks were already settled on the lower Oxus before the adoption of Islam. Among the reminiscences of Persian influence
is the celebration of the spring equinox, which is as strictly observed in Khiva as among the Persians of Iran. Traces of



CENTRAL ASIAN TURKS 181
fire-worship survive in the belief of the Khiva Uzbegs in the healing power of the sun and of fire. Traces even of old Iranian myths have been preserved among the Turks of the
lower Oxus. In dress the Uzbeg resembles his kinsman the
Turkmen rather than the Iranian Tajik. In food he differs little from other Turkish nomads ; only Jcumiss is hardly ever
to be met with. In spite of centuries of Moslem influence, it
is not the parents who arrange marriages, but the young
people themselves. The kalim paid for the bride consists of
horses, cows, sheep, camels, and so forth. The worship of
saints flourishes much less among the Uzbegs of Khiva than
those of Bokhara and Khokand, and the number of pilgrimages
to Mecca is exceedingly small.

iii. The Volga Turks
1. Kazan Turks
Habitat. The Volga Turks are found, with Kazan as their centre, to the north, east, and west of the middle course of the Volga. They are almost restricted to the territory of the
following ten governments of Russia : Kazan, Orenburg, Samara, Simbirsk, Vyatka, Saratov, Penza, Nizhni Novgorod,
Perm, and Tambov. A small number of them are scattered
about elsewhere, perhaps altogether 20,000. Most of these
have migrated to Ryazan or are descended from prisoners who
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were settled in Lithuania about Vilna, Grodno, and Podolia. Others (about
2,000) live in Petrograd, where they pursue the callings of
coachmen and of waiters in restaurants. There are also some in the Plock district of Poland. Number. The total number of the Volga Turks is about 1,500,000. The Government of Kazan contains by far the most, with more than half a million ; Orenburg comes next with over a quarter of a million. The Turkish population in the other governments diminishes in the order in which they
are enumerated above, down to Tambov with scarcely 15,000. Name. By the Russians these, like other Turks living in
Russian territory, are called Tatars. - But they call themselves simply Moslems or Musulmans, as opposed to the surrounding



182 THE TURKISH DIVISION
Russian Christians; for among them religion is by far the
strongest and most distinctive bond of union. Language. In spite of the racial mixture the Volga Tatars speak a pure Turkish dialect.
Race. It is somewhat uncertain who exactly were the an
cestors of the Turks of Kazan, or how and when they reached
their present home. It is, however, not improbable that they
are descended from that section of the Kipchak horde which in the thirteenth century moved northward and conquered the
region of the Kama, and after the devastations of Jenghiz Khan and Timur, mingling with the remnants of the old Bulgars, retired westwards and founded the city of Kazan, out of which, in 1445, the Khanate of Kazan was created. It is also likely that other elements of the Golden Horde came from the southeast and settled in Kazan. In any case, there is no doubt as
to the Turkish origin of the Kazan Tatars, or the strong racial admixture which they have undergone. The Eastern Finns
(Votyaks, Mordvins, Cheremisses), who from time immemorial have dwelt on the middle Volga, undoubtedly exercised a great influence on the ethnic development of this people. Characteristics. Their physical characteristics are sufficient to show that they are a mixture of Turks and Finns. They
are middle-sized, broad-shouldered, deep-chested, and strong. They have long, regular faces, rather high cheek-bones, straight
noses, mostly black eyes, a yellowish complexion, and thin beards. The Volga Turks are on the whole distinguished by their
sobriety, honesty, thrift, and industry. By their assiduity they often acquire considerable wealth. They live on the best terms with their Russian peasant neighbours^
Occupations. The chief occupation of the Kazan Turk is
trade, to which he at once turns when he has acquired a small
capital by agriculture. On his commercial journeys he is always a propagandist of Islam. His chief industries are soap
boiling, spinning, and weaving. He is sometimes a worker in
gold. He makes a good shoemaker and coachman. Dwellings. The houses of the Volga Turks differ from those
of the Russians, the windows all looking into an inner court,
as with their kinsmen who live far away in Chinese Turkestan.
These Turks are more cleanly in their houses than the Russian
peasantry.



THE VOLGA TUEKS 183
Customs. In the marriage customs of these Turks, the price
of the bride {kalim) is as important as among their nomad
kinsmen. It is negotiated between the parents of the bride
and of the bridegroom. Among rich Tatars it often amounts
to 1,000 roubles. Only one half of the sum is claimed by the parents of the bride, the other half being spent on her trousseau. Polygamy is practised by the well-to-do only, and is a declining institution. Birth and death customs are almost identical with those of all other settled Moslems. The festivals of Kurban, Bairam, and Ramazan Bairam are celebrated in the same way as in Bokhara and Stamboul.
Literature. The literature is chiefly religious, as among
other Turks, theology together with Persian and Arabic being
the main subject of study. There is, however, some popular
poetry which expresses the national spirit better, and contains less of the foreign element than Osmanli literature does.
Religion. The Volga Turks are all Mohammedans excepting
about 28,000 Christians, or Keresh as they call themselves,
the descendants of those Tatars who were forcibly converted by Ivan the Terrible in the sixteenth century. Religion, with these Turks, is the most powerful of the motives by which they are swayed. They are more like the orthodox Central Asians
in their religious zeal than the Mohammedans of Turkey and
Arabia. When in 1556 Ivan the Terrible captured Kazan,
even the harshest measures employed by him could not shake the attachment of these Tatars to Islam. Till the end of the sixteenth century no mosques were tolerated in Kazan, and
the Tatars were compelled to live in a separate quarter. But
the predominance of the Moslems gradually prevailed, so that in the second half of the eighteenth century there were as
man}^ as 250 mosques in the Government of Kazan. A Ukase of tolerance promulgated in 1773 helped the cause of Islam
among these Turks. Far from being won by Russian toler
ance, the Moslems of the Volga have in modern times become
more closely united than ever with the Mohammedan world. At the present day the Kazan Mollahs are trained not only
in Bokhara but in Constantinople, Cairo, and (till recently)
Medina. There has been a rapid increase in the number of
mosques, and a steady improvement in the status of Moslem
schools in the Government of Kazan. Between 1781 and 1868 the number of mosques rose from 250 to 729. In the latter



184 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
year there was one mosque to every 310 men, and one school to every 119 boys. These schools have not been affected in the least by the Russian educational system.
Education. The education in the Moslem schools has been a re
ligious one only. Arabic and Persian being the chief languages, the study of the mother-tongue has been quite neglected, as among the Uzbegs and (till lately) among the Osmanlis,
and Russian is not taught at all, though the Tatar learns to speak it otherwise. In consequence of the attention paid to
education, the percentage of Kazan Turks who cannot read and
write is extremely low. The production of printed books has also been considerable among these Moslems. Thus in the period 1802 (when an Oriental press was established at Kazan)
to 1885, more than 1,000,000 copies of Oriental works, almost restricted to theology, were issued at Kazan. Some of these even reached Central Asia, and India. Thus, during a period of 360 years of Russian rule, the Asiatic conservatism of these Kazan Moslems has in no way been weakened or influenced by Russian culture. Every reform introduced by the Russian
Government has only stimulated the Tatars' zeal for their own
religious learning. Hence no conversion except among their ruling families takes place, and only the quite uneducated element is liable to be absorbed in the Russian population.
On the other hand, the Mollahs seem to have more success among the Keresh or Christian Tatars than the Orthodox Russian missionary has among the Moslems. In fact, the
Keresh have remained, both in certain customs and still more in language, more Tatar than the Moslems themselves ; for
they intermarry much oftener with the neighbouring Christian Chuvashes, Cheremisses, Votyaks, and Mordvins than with Russians, and are on the other hand less exposed to the foreign Arabic-Persian influence than the Moslems. Turkish national modes of thought and life have thus been better preserved
among the Kazan Turks than among those of the west, Azarbaijans and Osmanlis ; and in spite of a settled life of centuries under Russian sovereignty, there is no prospect of
their absorption by the ruling race. What has here been said
of the Kazan Tatars applies to the Volga Turks in general.
Kazan was their educational centre both before and after the
Russian occupation in 1556. Even now in national, religious, and intellectual matters Kazan takes the lead, because all the



THE VOLGA TURKS 185
Tatars on the Volga, from above Kazan down to its mouths, always identify their interests with those of their principal
city.

2. The Baslikirs
Habitat. The Bashkirs inhabit the south-eastern part of
European Eussia, the region of the governments of Vyakta,
Perm, Ufa, Samara, and Orenburg, between the Kama and
Middle Volga on the west and the Ural range on the east.
They extend farther north than any other member of the
Turkish race in Europe, forming an intermediate population
between the genuine Turks and the Ugrians. Number. The Bashkir population at the beginning of the
century numbered 757,300.^^ Race. The Bashkirs are commonly regarded as Turkified
Ugrians ; but racial, linguistic, and historical evidence appears decidedly to favour the view of Vambery that in this people,
which is a mixture of Turk and Ugrian, the fundamental
nationality is Turkish, which, mingling with the neighbouring
Ostyaks and Voguls, has adopted many racial peculiarities
from these, but without changing their national Turkish idiom,
much in the same way as the Magyars have retained their
language. Character. There is a difference of type between the Bash
kirs living in the valleys of the Ural range and the inhabitant of the steppes. The latter has a more pronounced
Turkish appearance. He is of medium height, with a large head, broad, flat face, low nose, and prominent chin. His kinsman in the forest regions has a long face, a convex profile,
a prominent nose, and higher stature, resembling rather the Caucasian Asiatic. It has been observed that the Bashkirs on the whole can hardly be distinguished from the Turks of Kazan, Astrakhan, and the Crimea. They are predominantly
black-haired, black-eyed, and brachycephalic. The general character of the Bashkirs shows both the good
and the bad qualities which distinguish most Turks who have



186 THE TURKISH DIVISION
only recently exchanged a primitive nomad existence for a settled or half-settled manner of life. Hospitality is one of
the traits which they have preserved from earlier times. On the other hand, the Bashkir suffers from excessive indolence, the habit of brooding for hours on end and indulging in absolute
inactivity, from which even pressing necessity cannot arouse him. In spite of the general impoverishment from which he consequently suffers, one of his characteristics is cheerfulness, or rather levity, in which he resembles the Kirghiz, though without the cunning of the latter. Among the crimes which
he commits horse-stealing is the chief. He is not particularly
revengeful or intriguing. On the whole he has been a peaceful
and submissive subject under Eussian rule.
Manner of Life. Inasmuch as the Bashkirs, like the Tatars of Kazan, the Nogaians, the Kirghiz, and the Central Asiatics,
are dominated by Moslem civilization, they naturally do not
differ greatly in manner of life from the neighbouring Russian Turks and the Kirghiz. The exterior of their houses resembles that of their Tatar neighbours, contrasting with the latter
chiefly in their poverty-stricken and ruinous appearance. The interior arrangements are, however, more like those of the Kirghiz tent than of the Kazan house. In dress the Bashkirs differ little from the Tatars and Kirghiz. Their food is strikingly similar in material, form, and nomenclature to that still prevailing among the Kirghiz and in Central Asia. The fact that
airan (buttermilk) and kumiss (fermented mare's milk) are their favourite drinks is an indication that no great length of time has elapsed since the Bashkirs gave up a regular nomadic
life, for those beverages have long disappeared among the
Uzbegs, the Tatars of Kazan and the Crimea, and the still half-nomadic Yiiriiks of Anatolia. In family life the Bashkirs follow the usages of the Turks of Kazan, to whose standard of civilization they conform in general. Marriages are con
tracted after the Jcalim has been fixed, the amount ranging
from 3,000 roubles among the rich to a load of wood or hay among the poorest. Although the betrothal often takes place
in early childhood, marriage is seldom consummated before
the age of eighteen in the case of men and sixteen in the case of women. The wedding ceremonies resemble those of no
madic rather than settled Turks. In the amusements of the
Bashkirs, music, song, and dance play an important part. Their



THE VOLGA TUEKS 187
dancing resembles that of the Chuvashes as well as of the Magyars. Religion. The Bashkirs probably adopted Mohammedanism
at an early period, but their adherence to Islam is lax, like that of regular Turkish nomads. The veiling of women is not required among them. Nor do they strictly observe the pre
scriptions of Islam regarding ablutions and food, and they are
by no means averse to the use of vodka. The Mollahs have, however, exercised a beneficial influence in the matter of education. The number of schools is very considerable, and
the proportion of those who can read and write is consequently remarkably high. Teaching is, however, restricted to the
study of the Kuran, all secular subjects being excluded. Every
attempt to transform the schools into centres of general educa
tion and culture according to the European model has hitherto failed.
Literature. In literary matters the Bashkirs are far behind
the Turks of Kazan. With the exception of some school-books,
which are rather written in the dialect of Kazan, the literature
of the Bashkirs consists exclusively of popular poetry, mostly
songs of four stanzas, dealing with love, chivalry, and attach
ment to home. Here the national Bashkir spirit coupled with
the use of national imagery prevails, rather than the con
ventional style and the gloomy breedings of Persian-Arabic poetry. Occupations. The force of circumstances has transformed the Bashkirs from nomads into a settled people, who to some
extent are still semi-nomads. Their migratory instinct now
no longer goes beyond exchanging their fixed winter dwell
ings for other abodes during the summer months, as is usual among all settled Turks. Their favourite pursuits are wood
cutting, carting, bee-keeping, hunting, training falcons, fishing.
They also work as labourers in mines. But their nomadic
nature has so little adapted itself to agriculture that they are among the most sluggish and inefficient cultivators of the soil, inferior even to the Uzbegs of Central Asia, and much more so
to their neighbours the Chuvashes. Though often possessing enough arable land to render other peasants prosperous, Bash
kirs lapse into poverty. Cattle-breeding would be more to their taste, but the wide pastures that would appeal to them are lacking, so they do not thrive even in this direction.



188 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
There has consequently been going on among them a general
impoverishment, which will probably lead to their ultimate
absorption in the surrounding Russian population.
Language. The language of the Bashkirs appears to be one which, since the separate existence of this people, has had the character of an independent dialect, and which is one of the links in the Turkish linguistic chain extending from the upper
Irtish to the middle Volga. One point in which this dialect differs from the rest is a slight influence exercised upon it by
the Ugrian language, both in vocabulary and phonetics (as the change ofs to ^, e.g. Turkish soz ' word ', Bashkir Tioz), History. The earliest information we have of the Bashkirs is derived from Ibn Fozlan, who gives an account of the
journey which he made in a. d. 925 as an envoy of the Khalif
Muktedir Billah to Bolgari on the Volga. On his way thither
he passed, on the lower course of the Ural, the steppe inhabited
by the Bashkirs, of whom he says :
' We reached the land of
a Turkish people called Bashkird, against whom we were particularly on our guard, for this is the worst of all Turkish
peoples, being distinguished as the most violent and daring of
them in fight.' In describing their faith he speaks of the
wooden idols to which the Bashkirs turn when in distress,
though they have twelve special deities, those of earth, summer
and winter, rain and wind, trees, men and foals, water, night and day, death and life. In these we may recognize the
tutelary spirits of the Altaians and the Chuvashes. This shows that there was in the tenth century, east of the Volga, a Turkish
people called Bashkirs, who lived in the immediate neighbourhood of their present home, and who have, unlike so many other kindred peoples, preserved their ethnic identity for a thousand years. That they were once exclusively nomads is
shown by the fact that at the beginning of the thirteenth
century they joined the Mongol hordes of Jenghiz Khan, and were for their services rewarded with a seal and flag, the usual emblems of national independence. The Franciscan friar
Rubruquis narrates how in 1253, after a journey of twelve
days from the Volga, he reached the Bashkirs on the Yaik
(Ural). These people were throughout herdsmen, who had no
towns or forts, and who preferred the region of the steppes to the mountains for their dwelling-place. In the middle of the sixteenth century they came under the Russian rule of Ivan

the Terrible. In 1773 they assisted Katharine II to quell
a revolt, and even fought for Russia, under a special military
organization, against Sweden, Poland, and Turkey. There is evidence that even in the eighteenth century the habitat of
the Bashkirs extended much farther south. It is recorded that about 1700 they lived on the lower course of the Yaik (Ural), and that their pastures extended up to the Ural range ; that whole districts of the Kirghiz steppe of to-day had formerly been abandoned by the Bashkirs; and that about
1800 the Bashkirs wandered on the plateaus between the Emba and the Ural mountains. In 1798 the Russian Government, turning to account the warlike spirit which still manifested itself among the Bashkirs, formed out of them an irregular
cavalry force, armed with bows and lances, to guard the frontier along the Ural river against the Kirghiz. In 1812
Bashkirs fought against Napoleon in the 30th Cossack regi
ment. The frontier guard was disbanded in 1814 ; but in 1 876
a new regiment of Bashkirs armed with rifles was established.

3. Astrakhan Turks and Kundurs
Habitat. There are, besides, two small groups of Turks who
live at the mouth of the Volga. One of these are the Astra
khan Tatars, numbering about 10,000 souls, who, along with
the Mongol Kalmuks (p. 110), are all that is left of the once
powerful Astrakhan Empire. Their occupations are agricul
ture and gardening.
The other group are the Kundurs, who number about 12,000 and call themselves Kara-agach (' black- tree '). They separated
from the Nogaians of the Great Horde in the middle of the
thirteenth century, and when the Kalmuks in 1771 completely abandoned the territory of the lower Volga, on their return to the Hi valley (p. 113), they settled in the delta of the Volga, on the banks of the rivers Ak-tobe and Bereket, in the neighbourhood of the towns of Seitovka and Khoshdutovka.
Mode of Life. Here, in the vicinity of one of the Kirghiz hordes and of the Kalmuks, \\\ey lead a half-nomadic existence, passing thewinter in the towns just mentioned, but wandering



190 THE TURKISH DIVISION
during the rest of the year on the left bank of the Aktobe
river. Their features display a strikingly Kalmuk type. In
constructing their tents they give them an oblong shape rather than the circular form usual among other Turkish nomads. In their dirtiness and extraordinary indolence they
resemble the Kalmuks rather than the Nogaians.
Language. It is only in language and in a certain number of customs that they retain traits of their Turkish origin. Their language is related to the Nogaian, and not to the Turkish spoken in the Caucasus and in Persia. The influence of the latter country is shown by the fact that the Kundurs still belong to the Shiite sect of Islam. In 1771 they submitted to Russian rule. In 1785 they were placed under the adminis
tration of the Krasnoyarsk district of Astrakhan, when summer
and winter quarters on the Volga were assigned to them. Divisions. The Kundurs are divided into two branches, each of which consists of several clans. It is somewhat strange that this section of the Turks should, in spite of their association with Kalmuks and Kirghiz, have been transformed from regular nomads into semi-nomads of a restricted type within
the comparatively short period of a hundred years.
Food and Drink. In the matter of food the Kundurs resemble nomads rather than a settled population, for they live chiefly on meat and different forms of milk. They drink Jcumiss, and above all brick tea, which they seem to have become acquainted with through the Kalmuks. Cost of Living. The struggle for existence is a hard one for the dwellers in the Astrakhan steppe. Sixty years ago an income of at least 135 roubles was necessary to support
a family of two persons : to obtain this the Kundur had to sell
one camel, two horses, one bull, two cows, five sheep, and
five goats. Marriage Customs. Marriage is based, as everywhere among the Turks, on the Jcalim^ which varies from 50 to 1,000 roubles. To counterbalance this the bride brings with her to her future home certain articles of furniture, a tent, a pair of oxen, and other valuables. The bride is con
ducted home with the same ceremonies as prevail among the
Crimean Tatars and Nogaians. The Kundurs resemble the
latter also in their chief amusement, dancing, which has
ceased to exist among the neighbouring Turks, the Kirghiz.



THE VOLGA TUEKS 191
Religion. In religion the Kundurs are Mohammedans who have maintained their adherence to the Shiite sect in the midst of a purely Sunnite population. The continuance among them of this sect in the neighbourhood of the fanatical Volga Turks is probably due to that lukewarmness in matters of religion which is characteristic of nomads and seminomads.
Race. We have seen that the Kundurs are ethnically
a branch of the Nogaians, but linguistically they are clearly less closely allied to the Nogaians than to the Kazak-Kirghiz.
Now, the recurrence of several of the Kundur clan names
among the Kazak-Kirghiz shows that they, and consequently
also the Nogaians, once formed part of the Kazak nation. Though treated here as Volga Turks because of their geo
graphical position, the Kundurs belong to the division of Black Sea Turks under which the Nogaians are treated below
(pp. 194-7).
BiBLiOGRAPnY. Vambery, Das Turkemolk, pp. 443, 552-7.
4. Chuvashes
Race. Though this people has already been mentioned above (p. 50) as a branch of the Volga group of the
Eastern Finns, Vamb^ry^-'^ may be right in regarding them as
fundamentally a section of the Turkish race which has been modified by the influence of their Finnish neighbours, the Cheremisses. His theory is based on both the physical
characteristics and the language of the Chuvashes. On neither
ground does he appear to be convincing. He describes them
as of medium size, with a clumsy gait, a predominantly dark
brown complexion, somewhat prominent cheek-bones, brown or black eyes, narrow forehead, and black hair. In the women, he says, the narrowness of the eye and the prominence of the cheek-bones are more marked, while the complexion is
much fairer than that of the Tatars. This account does not
altogether agree with that of other observers, and it is in any case doubtful whether the evidence of physique favours a Turkish rather than a Finnish origin in the case of tiiis mixed people. The linguistic evidence seems to be no more decisive. For though the Chuvashes speak a Turkish language, it is to be noted that while two Turkish peoples living so far apart as the Anatolians and the inhabitants of East Turkestan



192 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
can understand each other, the most accomplished Turkish
scholar can make out a Chuvash text only after an intimate
study of the accidence and phonetics of the language. Still
less does the mode of life followed by this people from very
early times support the Turkish theory. The Chuvashes have
been strictly settled perhaps longer than any distinctively Turkish population, having early become the eminently
agricultural people they are known to be at the present time. Such a past is by no means in keeping with the character of
the Turks, who have always shown a reluctance to abandon their original nomadism.
Character. Their industry has helped them to prosperity,
and poverty is seldom to be met with in their settlements. The Chuvash is distinguished for his kindness to his family, and he honours and regards his wife far more than the Russian or the Tatar does. Customs. A few points in the customs of the Chuvashes
may be added. Marriages are not arranged by the parents,
but the bride is chosen by the young man himself. The
practice here prevails, as among the Turks, of paying a Jcalim, which rises to the limit of 200 roubles. This is,
however, occasionally evaded when the youth has not sufficient means. Then, with the consent of his parents, and in collusion with the bride, he captures the latter, and carries her off to his house, later on paying a kalim proportionate to his
means. When a man dies his body is dressed in his best clothes and interred with the things which he used most
during life, such as tobacco, beer, and, according to his occupa
tion, an axe, a musical instrument, or other object. A dead woman, on the other hand, is supplied with needle, thread, flax, linen, and other articles. History. Some further details about the Chuvashes may
here be supplied. Their name first appears in the Russian
annals in the year 1524. Some more information about them
has come down in connexion with the foundation of various towns in the sixteenth century. They suffered many centuries
of subjection to Bulgars, Mongols, and Tatars successively till
1743, when they came under Russian rule and began to adopt
Christianity. Thej^ have long been among the most peaceable and submissive subjects of the Russian Empire.
Religion. In religion the Chuvashes are chiefly nominal



THE VOLGA TURKS 193
Christians, but also partly Moslems and partly still adherents
of their old pagan faith. No definite data are available as to the local and numerical distribution of these forms of belief; but it may be said in general that the majority of the pro
fessed Christians live in the Government of Kazan on the right bank of the Volga, while on the left bank, in various districts of the Government of Samara, Ufa, and Orenburg,
many Mohammedans are interspersed, and in the districts of Sizran, Kuznetsk, and Petrovsk the heathen population predominates. The Chuvash easily identifies Christian saints with his old pagan gods, mainly owing to the extensive use of
images in the Russian Church ; while among those who are
Mohammedans almost every reminiscence of their ancient faith has disappeared, in consequence of the strict monotheism
and intolerance of idolatry characteristic of Islam. The surviving form of the old religion of the Chuvashes is a modified kind of Shamanism, improved and widened by Christian and
Mohammedan influence.
Bibliography. Vambery, Das Turkenvolk, pp. 444-95 (where a. full account of the language and religion of the Chuvashes is given).
5, 6. Meshchers and Tepters
In this connexion may be mentioned two small peoples
living in the Governments of Kazan, Ufa, Perm, Penza, and Saratov, numbering, according to Vamberj^'s estimate in 1885,
140,000 and 130,000 respectively. They are unmistakably Ugrians in origin, but have been mixed with Turks, the
majority speaking a Turkish language and having adopted Turkish customs. Meshchers. The Meshchers of Penza and Kazan have been
completely Russianized in language, customs, and religion. They are almost exclusively agriculturists. The more numer
ous fraction of the Meshchers, who are Mohammedans, at the present day live in the midst of the Bashkirs, and are said to
differ as little in their customs and their mode of life from their Turkish neighbours as the Christian Meshchers do from the Russians. They compare favourabl^^ with the Bashkirs in their greater cleanliness and prosperity. They are industrious and skilled tillers of the soil. Their physiognomy shows
I. clearly that they are not Turks, for the majority of them have
oval faces, fair hair, and light blue eyes. TURANIANS "K



194 THE TURKISH DIVISION
Tepters. The Tepters are widely scattered in the Govern
ments of Orenburg, Ufa, Vyatka, and Perm, mostly in regions that were formerly occupied by the Bashkirs. They do not
show any distinct type, for they are the result of a mixture of Turks with various East Finnish tribes, such as the
Mordvins, Chuvashes, Votyaks, and Cheremisses, who, after
the destruction of Kazan in the sixteenth century, fled to the Urals, and there formed a racial amalgam the elements of
which are not easy to distinguish. The Tepters are divided into Moslems and pagans, there
being also a few Christians who have been converted in recent
times. Though they have long been settled, they are among the laziest and most unskilful cultivators of the soil, and in
consequence miserably poor, as far at least as the Moslem section is concerned. The pagan Tepters, however, being
comparatively good and industrious agriculturists, seldom suffer from poverty. The religion of the heathen Tepters shows traces of a cult similar to that of the Chuvashes. They
believe in a supreme being who lives in heaven and to whose power the evil spirits are subject. To the latter they attribute all the diseases and all the misfortunes that befall mankind.
Believing that man continues to live after death, they suppty the deceased with a switch to drive off the dogs that endeavour
to devour him in the next world. Their religious ceremonies consist in sacrifices which they offer to the evil spirits (called
hereynet) once a year. It is to be noted that marriage by
capture is in vogue among them even when they are not driven to this practice by the lack of a kalim.^'^ It is interesting to note that there was formerly a small
Moslem population (probably now extinct) living among the Votyaks and called Besarmen, a corruption of the Turkish
Busurman for Musurman, Musulman. Besarmen or Basarman was also corrupted to Basarban, a name applied about 1100 to Moslem Turks living in Moldavia. This region consequently came to be called Basarbania or Bessarabia.
iv. Black Sea Turks
a. The Nogaians Habitat. The Nogaians at the present day inhabit the
Government of Stavropol, extending southward of the Kuma
to the territory of the Terek Cossacks and to Daghestan. At



BLACK SEA TUEKS 195
one time they preferred to wander in the steppes to the north and north-east of the Caspian ; and there is no doubt that even in earlier centuries they lived in the low country on the right
bank of the Volga down to the Sea of Azov. Name. Their designation is not an ethnic but a political
one, being derived from Nogai, the name of a great-grandson
of Jenghiz Khan, who in 1259 distinguished himself in the army sent out to devastate Poland. It was transferred to that part of the Golden Horde which fell to his share, just as Seljuk, Osman, and Uzbeg were to the hordes subject to those leaders. It was thus adopted by numerous Turkish tribes extending
from the Irtish to the Crimea, and came to be given as a collective term to all the Turks on the Black Sea, the Caspian,
and the Volga.^'^ In history, too, from the thirteenth century
onwards down to modern times, the Nogaians are constantly mentioned in this sense as in alliance with Russians and
Byzantians, or fighting among themselves, or in conflict with various neighbours, such as the Circassians, Kirghiz, Bashkirs, Kalmuks, always present, but nowhere at home. The Nogaians have, of all Turkish peoples, suffered most from the blows of fortune to which warlike nomads have always been exposed.^* They have in course of time been scattered and broken, not
only by the neighbouring nomads, but by the advancing power of the Russians. Migrations, The Nogaians seem often to have shifted their habitat in bygone times, and it is impossible to determine the exact territory occupied by them in former centuries. But it is historically certain that they were located to the west of the Sea of Azov and the north of the Crimea in the beginning of
the fifteenth century. We also know that a fraction of this
people, who in the beginning of the seventeenth century were found on the middle Yemba, were driven westward by the Kalmuks, and were transplanted by Peter the Great to their
kinsmen in the steppe on the Kuma and the Kuban.
Hordes. In the eighteenth century the following five hordes of the Nogaians were to be distinguished : the horde on the
Sea of Azov between the Don and the Kuban ; the Crimean horde ; the Astrakhan horde, which was greatly diminished by
migration to the Caucasus, the Crimea^ and the territory of the Bashkirs; the Kasai and the Noruz tribes on the Kuban,
and especially the Laba ; and lastly, on the Aktobe (Akhtuba)
N2



196 THE TURKISH DIVISION
river, a branch of the Volga, the Kundurs, who have already
been described among the Volga Turks (pp. 189-91).
Number. The great bulk of the Nogaians live in the
Government of Stavropol, where there are about 85,000 ; over 8,000 are to be found in the territory of the Terek, and nearly 2,000 in Daghestan. There are also a few thousands in Taurida, the southernmost government of Russia (north of the
Black Sea). The total number of the Nogaians therefore
amounts to about 100,000.^' Characteristics. In spite of their contact with so many
kindred and foreign elements, such as Bashkirs, Kalmuks, Caucasians, Russians, Poles, Rumanians, and Hungarians, the
portion of the Nogaians who have remained faithful to their
old nomad life, the so-called Kara-Nogaians, have preserved
a comparatively purer Turkish type of physique than many of their kinsmen. They have a thick-set figure, with a large head,
small eyes, and scanty beard, strongly reminiscent of the original Turkish type. The settled or half-settled population,
however, which has been strongly intermingled with Caucasians, approximates in many points to the type of the latter.
The Nogaians have few vices and many merits. They are
law-abiding, and submissive to authority. Robbery and murder are practically unknown, though cattle-stealing is
pretty frequent. They are temperate and less given to drinking brandy than their kinsmen on the middle Volga and in
the Crimea. The Nogaian is strikingly quiet and silent, a prototype of the old Turkish virtue of gravity.
Occupations. The Nogaians are no longer anywhere in
veterate nomads like the Kirghiz and Turkmens. But they
still have a predilection for cattle-breeding ; their dwellings are either miserable clay huts or tents of felt ; and they prefer meat as food. Airan (buttermilk), kumiss, and the various kinds of cheese are just as popular with them as with the
steppe-dwellers to the east of the Caspian. Brick tea, which
is unknown to the Turkmens and the other western Turks, is
as much a necessity to the Kara-Nogaians as bread is to a
European. They must have become acquainted with it through their contact with the Kalmuks, of whom, as well as of other Mongols and of the Kirghiz, it is a favourite drink.
Dress. The dress of the men shows the strong influence of



BLACK SEA TUEKS 197
the neighbouring Caucasus, but the costume of the women resembles rather that of the Kazan and Volga Tatars. Customs. Little that is characteristic remains in the customs of the Nogaians. The bride is conveyed to her new home in
a wagon, on which, in the case of rich girls, a bridal tent is set up. The Nogaians take their wives chiefly from the settled
Tatars of the Crimea. The Jcalim is thirty cows or less. The wife is treated like a slave, and enjoys none of the privileges that are accorded to her among the Turkmens and the Kirghiz.
Polygamy is said to prevail pretty widely among* them. The
birth and death customs show not the slightest trace of old
nomad usages. Yet the account given by the traveller Tavernier of the Nogaians shows that at the end of the seventeenth century they were more typical of Turkish nomadism than the Kirghiz and the Turkmens are to-day.
Religion. In religious matters the Nogaians are more
closely connected with the nomad than with the settled or half-settled Turks. They are nominally Sunnite Moslems, but they are lax in their beliefs. Little influence has been exer
cised on them by the Mohammedans of Kazan, whom they are inclined to despise. They look rather to the Mollahs from the
Turkmen steppes, and especially those from Khiva and Bokhara,
who are highly respected by them.

b. The Caucasian Turks
A group in the Black Sea Turks is formed by those inhabit
ing Cis-Caucasia, who came from the north and are Sunnites,
and those of Trans- Caucasia, who came from the south and are Shiites. Their total number is 1,879,908 according to the Russian census of- 1897. 1. The Kumulcs inhabit the region of the north-eastern Caucasus along the western coast of the Caspian from Shamkhalyangi-yurt to Yemikent in the Government of Daghestan. One part of them lives in the valleys of the mountainous
country to the south, while another section occupies the sandy plains between the Terek, its southern tributary the Sunsha, and the Sulak. They may have been in possession of this
territory since the eighth century, for Derbend even at that



198 THE TURKISH DIVISION
time formed the boundary between the Aryans and the Turks in the Caucasus. Race. They would thus be the descendants of the Turks
who wandered on the steppe and the plains extending from
the right bank of the Volga to the Don and the Dnieper. In any ease, a fraction of the Kumuks, called Nogai Kumuks, are directly descended from the Nogaians. Under the pressure of the Russians a section of the Nogaians retired to the territory
next to the Kumuks on the left bank of the Terek, where they
are still known under the name of the Kara-Nogais. The
main stock of the Kumuks were thus Turks who in very early
times migrated from the north into the region still occupied by them, and formed the nucleus around which, in the course
of centuries, other stray Turkish fragments gathered. This group formed, till the Turkification of Eastern Transcaucasia, the ethnic frontier between Turks and Iranians. After the Mongol invasion, when the stream of Turks began to flow from the south, the chain connecting the Turks north and south of the Caucasus was geographically established. But the racial
. bond that might otherwise have united Kumuks and Azarbaijans has never done so, because they have always been separated by difference of sect as well as of manners and customs. The Azarbaijans, owing to the cultural influences
to which they have been subject, have always belonged to Iran ; while the Kumuks, as immediate neighbours of the Caucasian mountaineers, have from early times followed the Caucasians in their manner of life. Number. According to the Russian census of 1897 the
total number of the Kumuks was 100,838, a figure which, after the lapse of twenty years, must be considerably exceeded at the
present time. The proportion of the population of Daghestan to that of the Terek region is as two to one.
CJiaracteristics. In physique the Kumuk shows hardly any trace of the genuine Turkish type, far less than do his kinsmen on the Kura and the left bank of the Terek. In manners and customs this is still more the case. They are described as on the whole an industrious and peaceable people.
Mode of Life. Having been settled for centuries, the Kumuks maintain themselves by rearing live stock (especially sheep),
agriculture, bee-keeping, and fishing. The men also engage in
the industry of making weapons, the women in that of silver



BLACK SEA TURKS 199
and gold embroidery. In dress the Kumuks differ little from
the neighbouring people of Daghestan.
Religion. The Kumuks are Sunnite Moslems, like all CisCaucasian Mohammedans. Having adopted Islam at a very
early period, they even in the Middle Ages played the part of
missionaries and civilizers among the heathen mountaineers. They consequently exercised a strong influence on their neigh
bours, many of whom adopted their language and customs, just
as the Azarbaijans who penetrated into the Caucasus from the south converted the Iranian population to Islam and gradually
imposed on it their Turkish language. History. After their conquest by the Russians in 1559, the
Kumuks liberated themselves in 1604, but submitted to Peter the Great in 1722, when he made his expedition to Persia. Since then they have been subject to Russian rule. 2. The Karachai tribe of Turks inhabit the territory of the head waters of the Kuban at the western foot of Mount Elbruz.
Language. Although surrounded by Circassians, they have
preserved down to the present day their Turkish language,
which resembles that of the Codex Cumanus of 1303, and has dialectic peculiarities showing that the Karachais came neither
from the east nor the south, but from the north, that is, from
the Kuma steppe. Characteristics. In appearance the Karachais are as un
Turkish as the Osmanlis and the Azarbaijans, being well-built,
with large black eyes and fair complexion. They are regarded as the handsomest of the Caucasians. Occupations and Customs. The occupations and customs of the Karachais, as may be inferred from the Alpine character
of their home, are totally different from those of their kinsmen
in the north and the south. Living chiefly by agriculture and also to a considerable extent by domestic industries, they have
long lost the warlike habits of their nomad ancestors. Traces of old Turkish practices, however, survive in their love of
horseflesh, their addiction to beer-drinking (in which they resemble the Chuvashes of to-day and all the Black Sea Turks
of former times), and in some specifically Turkish superstitions.
Number. According to the Russian census the number of
the Karachais in 1897 was 27,222. As according to the latest statistics available in 1885 Vambery ^^ estimates their popula



200 THE TURKISH DIVISION
tion at 19,800, it is likely at the present day to number nearly
40,000.
3. On the lower course of the Kuma there is a tribe of nomads called by the Russians Truchmen, which is merely
a corruption of Turkmen. They are undoubtedly a branch of the Turkmens, as is clear from the dialectic character of their language. The time when they separated from their kinsmen on the east side of the Caspian is not known, but it cannot be long ago, since they would otherwise hardly have
been able to maintain their ethnic individuality. Their number according to the Russian census was 24,522 in 1897.^^ It has
probably risen to between 30,000 and 40,000 at the present time. 4. There are various Turkish tribes in Transcaucasia, dis
tributed in the provinces of Kutais, Batum, Tiflis, Elizavetpol, Baku, Daghestan, Erivan, and Kars. They inhabit partly the mountains and partly the steppes, especially those around the
Kura river. They are most numerous in the governments of
Elizavetpol, Baku, and Erivan. These Turks first penetrated into the Caucasus on the occasion of the Seljuk invasions,
about A. D. 1200, from Azarbaijan. Other migrations of these
Turks into Transcaucasia took place much later, in the sixteenth and even the eighteenth centuries. In physique there is little difference between these Turks and their Caucasian brethren. But though they have for a century and a half been under Russian rule, they have not in the
slightest degree changed in religion, customs, and usages. In spite of being most fervent Shiites, they are on very good terms with the Caucasian Sunnites and with their Russian
neighbours. Polygamy is rare with them, and their women go unveiled to work. These Tatars are noted for their excel
lence as gardeners, agriculturists, cattle-tenders, and artisans. The total number of Turco-Tatars (that is, Turks) in Caucasia
was in 1897, according to the Russian census, 1,879,908.^" After the deduction from this aggregate of the figures for the
Nogaians, Turkmens, Karachais, and Kumuks, there remain about 1,665,000 Turks for Transcaucasia.'*^ After the lapse of twenty years the Turkish population of the whole of Caucasia
must now amount to well over 2,000,000.'^^



BLACK SEA TURKS 201
c. The Crimean Turhs
Habitat, The plains and valleys of the Crimean Peninsula
have been occupied for at least seven centuries by Turkish
tribes that migrated thither from the steppe country which
extends from the east of the Sea of Azov to the Dnieper,
a region long occupied by Turkish peoples.
Number. In 1793 the number of the Crimean Tatars was estimated at 159,125 ; but the emigrations into the Ottoman
Empire, which were resumed in the first years of the twentieth century, have reduced their population to about one-half of
what it was at the end of the eighteenth century. At the present day it cannot amount to more than 80,000.^^ Characteristics. Three types may be distinguished in the
Turkish population of the Crimea. The Tatars inhabiting the
northern plains have preserved the original Turkish physique.
These steppe-dwellers are of medium height and strong build,
with a dark yellow complexion, prominent cheek-bones, dark
ej'-es, narrow and oblique, broad nostrils, large ears, black hair,
and very scanty beard. The Tatars inhabiting the northern
slopes and the valleys of the Crimean mountains differ essen
tially from those in the plains. They are tall, sinewy, and slender. Their complexion approaches in fairness that of the
Caucasians. They have large dark eyes, and thick black hair
and beards. They are on the whole a handsome race. The
littoral Tatars, again, are probably a mixture of Turks, who early penetrated into the peninsula, with Greeks, Romans, and later with enslaved Circassians, Poles, Rumanians, Germans,
and Magyars. Being the result of the most complex imagin
able fusion of different elements, this class of the Crimean Turks has been divested of almost every vestige of its original type. They are tall and strongly built, with tanned oval faces,
fine sparkling eyes, glossy black hair, and long noses of Greek
or Roman mould. Among the mountain and littoral Tatars,
women of a perfectly ideal type of beauty are often to be seen ;
but in consequence of early marriages and the hard work to
which they are subjected, they soon grow prematurely old. Name. ' Crimean Tatars ' is a political rather than an ethnic name, given by Europeans to this fraction of the Turks after the Crimea as an independent state entered into intercourse



202 THE TURKISH DIVISION
with the neighbouring Christian powers. Krim, the name of the peninsula, is a Turkish word. Dwellings. The houses of the Crimean Tatars are built of brick in the plains, and of stone in the mountains. They
commonly have a terrace on the top, used chiefly for purposes of social entertainment. The interior of the house is divided
into three parts : kitchen, reception-room, and harem. A striking feature is the hexagonal or octagonal stove with a
dome-shaped top. A regular feature are also the gaudily coloured chests, which are found, from the Volga region to the interior of Anatolia, as articles of furniture among the
settled Turks, as well as among the Magyars. As a general rule, the houses of the Crimean Tatars are distinguished by
their orderly and cleanly appearance. The house stands in a courtyard surrounded by a stone wall or a fence (coated on the outside with clay), within a part of which the cattle are confined at night, in order that the dung, which is used for fuel, may more easily be utilized. Stalls are rare, as the cattle are commonly left in the open air, even during the winter.
Dress. The dress of the Crimean Tatars differs only slightly
from that of the Anatolians, the costume of the women being
much the same as that of the men. The women contrast with
the girls only in their head-gear. They wear a turban, with
their hair divided and hanging down on both sides. The girls, on the other hand, wear a fez adorned with coins and other ornaments, while their hair in several plaits hangs down their backs and on their shoulders. Food and Drink. The food and drink of the Crimean Turks resemble those of the Osmanlis rather than of their kinsmen in the north. They eat meat, especially in summer, only in
small quantities, but all the more garden produce. Coffee, owing to their continuous intercourse with the Osmanlis, has long been a favourite drink among them. But spirituous
liquors are little used, the steppe-dwellers even considering it a sin to cultivate a vineyard.
Occupations. Agriculture is the chief occupation of the Crimean Tatars. It is at its lowest level among them, partly'
owing to the climatic conditions, which expose them to frequent
droughts, early frosts, and flights of locusts. Though the soil is very fertile, it requires irrigation, which has not been sufficiently supported by the Russian Government, as it formerly



BLACK SEA TUEKS 203
was by the native Tatar rulers of the Crimea. This state pi
things has led to the rapid impoverishment of the Crimean
Tatars under Russian domination. A contributory cause has been the natural laziness of the Tatar. Satisfied with little, these descendants of a once fiercely warlike people are given up to
indolence, and sometimes prefer to starve rather than by a little
work to improve the conditions of life. Hence horticulture,
which might be made very profitable, is neglected by them.
The same applies to cattle-breeding, though there is plenty of
rich grazing-land. The number of cattle they keep is generally small, and large flocks of sheep numbering 2,000 are rare. These in spring are driven to the rich pasturage on the mountain heights. The same breed of dogs is here used to guard the
sheep against wolves and thieves as in Hungary. The pastoral life of the Crimea has so many points of resemblance with
that of the Magyars on the Hungarian steppes that both must
have started from a common source at a time when the ancestors of the Crimean Tatars and the Magyars dwelt side by side.
Among the Crimean Tatars, as among the Magyars, the
gipsies are the musicians and entertainers. The favourite instruments are the fiddle, the flute, and the drum. The singing, as with the Osmanli Turks, is slow and melancholy. The
national dance, the performance of which is accompanied by the strains of the national melody, is described as unsurpassed in the gracefulness of its movements. It is restricted to men, because Islam forbids female dancing. Eesembling the national dance of the Chuvashes and the Csardas of the Magyars, it
seems to have been common at one time to all Turks who extended from the north of the Caspian to the Danube, but to
have been preserved in its purest form by the Magyars. The Crimean Tatars are roused to moods of merriment chiefly by the monotonous and melancholy national melodies played by
the gipsies.
Marriage Customs, A Crimean Tatar, who seldom marries
before thirty, can only procure a wife by payment of a Jcalim,
which is negotiated with the father of the bride, whose wishes
are little consulted in the matter. Even when the price demanded is exorbitant or the bridegroom has insufficient
means, marriage by capture is seldom resorted to. because the
father ultimately accommodates himself to the situation. The



204 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
marriage festivities here, as among other Turks, last for several
days in the house of the bridegroom, who collects the wedding presents, which range in value from three to fifty roubles. It
is an unheard-of thing to attend a wedding without presenting
a gift.
Religion. The Crimean Tatars are Moslems, and have been so from very early times. Their devotion to Islam is, how
ever, weak ; but they adhere to its forms sufficiently to be
proof against Christian propagandism. While among the
Kazan Tatars one who cannot read or write is -a rarity, in the
Crimea whole villages are found in which, except the Mollah,
no one can read, to say nothing of write, the Kuran. The status of the Mollah himself is low, because the Moslems of the Crimea are poor, and nine-tenths of the Mohammedan religious endowments have been diverted by the Eussian
Government. A religious revival was caused a generation ago by the establishment of a press at Bakhchisarai and of a Tatar paper which has had an increasing circulation.
History. The Crimean Tatars occupied the peninsula in the thirteenth century. They became tributary to the Ottoman Empire in 1478, but during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries formed an independent Khanate, which prospered
till it fell under Turkish rule. They then suffered much from the wars fought between Turkey and Russia for the possession
of the peninsula. In 1777 they became dependent on Eussia,
which finally, in 1783, annexed the whole of the Crimea. The
Crimean War of 1854 and the Eussian laws of 1860-3 and 1874 caused the Crimean Tatars to emigrate in large numbers
into Turkey.

V. Western Turks
This branch of the Turks comprises all those Turkish tribes which inhabit the territory of the Persian and the Turkish
Empires. a. The Persian or Iranian Turks
Habitat. The Iranian Turks in the widest sense include
those of Transcaucasia, who have, however, been grouped



WESTERN TURKS 205
above as IV b, 4 (p. 200), because of their political position as inhabitants of Russian territory. Those of them that live in Persia proper are distributed in the following regions : 1. Azarhaijan, from the Araxes southward along the frontier
of Kurdistan past Urmia towards Kirmanshah. Here the
Turks are most numerously represented, being contiguous to
their kinsmen in Transcaucasia, from whom they are only
politically separated. They thus form the chief seat of the Turkish element in Persia.
2. Khamseh, the district between Azarbaijan and Tehran, especially in the neighbourhood of Zinjan.
3. The district of Tehran^ in the immediate neighbourhood of the capital and in the valleys of Damavand. 4. Kirman : in the district bordering on Ears. 5. IraJc : in the neighbourhood of Hamadan. 6. Fars : where they wander between the borders of Isfahan and the sea coast. 7. Khorasan : where they are most numerous around Nishapur and Kuchan. Eace, Racially and linguistically the Turks of Persia differ little from one another. They are descended from the Turks
who under Seljuk came from the north of the Sea of Aral. That they are closely akin to the Turkmens is shown by the fact that several of their tribes, such as the Khoja-ali and Begdilli in Karabagh, the Kara in Kirman, the Bayat around Nishapur, as well as the Kenger in Transcaucasia, are identical
in name with corresponding tribes among the Turkmens of
Russian Turkestan. Other tribes are known to be of Turkmen
origin, though their names have disappeared from among the
Turkmens proper. Such are the Avshars, a very numerous
tribe, near Urmia, who have become Shiites. Another such tribe are the Kajars, who formerly lived in the steppe border
ing on Astarabad and are now scattered about in Persia ; from them comes the present dynasty of the Shahs of Persia.
Again, the Kashkai in Fars are known to have migrated to
the south of Persia during the rule of the Il-khans.^'^ Thus the Turks of Persia ethnically form a connecting link between the Turkmens proper and the Osmans.
Each of the tribes has its own chieftain, who is appointed by the Shah. In former centuries the clans seem to have lived in compact masses, and to have been confined to particute



206 T^HE TUEKISH DIVISION
localities; but at the present day neither is the case. Only the large and powerful tribes attach importance to their
descent ; while the small fragments are very much in the dark as to their origin. Tribes once forming numerous units are scattered across the wide territory extending from the Paropamisus to the Kurdistan mountains, and from the Caucasus to the Persian Gulf. Thus members of one and the same tribe
may now be found in the Caucasus, in Khorasan, in Hamadan,
and in Kirman.
The only exceptions are the following four tribes, which are less dispersed and partly occupy their old habitat.
1. The Kajars, the chiefs of whom constitute the present dynasty of the Shahs of Persia. They formerly dwelt on the
borders of Syria, but in a.d. 1400 they were forced by Timur
to migrate towards their old home in Turkestan ; on the way, however, they settled in Azarbaijan and Irak. Till the time
of the Shah Abbas the Great (1585-1628) some of them also remained in Transcaucasia ; but that monarch forcibly settled them to the north of Astarabad and in the neighbourhood of Kuchan, for the twofold purpose of breaking their power and of making them a barrier against the predatory Turkmens.
2. The /Shahsevens or 'adherents of the Shah', whose name is not an ethnic but a comparatively modern collective name of a tribe composed of various Turkish elements from Azarbaijan and the Caucasus. The bulk of them at the present day live in summer on the slopes of Mount Savelan near Ardebil, but in winter farther north in the Moghan steppe. Besides these a considerable fraction of the tribe is found within the Persian frontier, between Kum, Tehran, Kazvin,
and Zinjan. They are, generally speaking, the most restless Turkish element in Persia, being still half or entirely nornadic.
3. The Kaslikais smd AUahverdis of the south, in the province of Fars, are with few exceptions nomads.^^ The
name Kashkai is still found as a clan name among the Turkmens.
4. Karakoyunlus, in the neighbourhood of Khoi, are in all
probability descendants of a Turkmen tribe against which Timur carried on a war of extermination all his life, but of which a considerable number have survived.
Numher. The Iranian Turks number approxi m ately 2 ,000,000, or rather more than one-fifth of the total, population of Persia.



WESTEEN TURKS 207
Characteristics. The Turks of Persia have been mixed with
various Aryan peoples Caucasians, Kurds, Armenians, Iranians as the result of the importation of male and female slaves,
which went on for centuries. A distinctively Turkish type can therefore not be looked for among them ; but a marked
mixed type, the basis of which has left genuine Turkish
physical traces, is noticeable as soon as Azarbaijans are seen side by side with the relatively pure Persians of Sliiraz.
According to a close observer, the Iranian Turks compared with the Persians have a less oval skull, a broader and less
expressive face, less arched brows, thicker eyelids, a shorter and broader nose, wider cheek-bones and chin, more fleshy lips, a taller and more massive and muscular iigure.^^ The description of the Turks of Transcaucasia given by another
authority ^^ is similar. Vambery,^^ who agrees with these accounts, adds that along the whole northern frontier of Persia the Turks in Azarbaijan and in Khorasan show far more traces of the national type than, for instance, the Kashkais in the south. It is natural that a considerable change in customs must
have been undergone by a people who, separated for more than eight centuries from the bulk of their kindred, have for so long lived in the midst of old Persian culture, and been strongly influenced by the religious bias of the Shiite sect.
Hence the Iranian Turk appears polite and refined compared with his congeners in the north-east and the west. But his native Turkish awkwardness and frankness is still apparent
when he is contrasted with the Southern Persian. This difference is still observable among the townsmen of Tabriz,
Tehran, and Hamadan in spite of the immediate influence of these centres of Persian culture, while the population of the country districts shows still more evident traces of the Turkish national character, some of their customs being clearly reminiscent of those still prevailing among the Turkmens of
the steppe. This similarity extends to various usages of family life, such as certain benedictions, which are almost identical, birth and
wedding ceremonies, and particularly the laws of hospitality,
which the Iranian Turk observes much more conscientiously
than the Persian. The word of the Turk, too, is much more to be depended on than that of the Iranian. He is also



208 THE TURKISH DIVISION
decidedly superior in manly qualities. To these he owes his dominant position for centuries in Persia, where he represents the really warlike ele'ment, for the army of the Shah consists
predominantly of Turks. The affinity to the Turkmens is still more evident among the
nomads. The very fact that single tribes, in spite of local difficulties and social pressure, have kept aloof from settled life sufficiently indicates the essentially Turkish character of these people. The chiefs alone are tinctured with Persian culture, while the masses differ only in externals, but not in modes of thought or customs, from their kinsmen of the steppe.
War and raids are the ideal of their life, and the monotony of
their ordinary leisure, lasting often for months, is varied only by the care they bestow on their horses and their weapons.
The maxims of Saadi, of Hafiz, and of other Persian poets are indeed often on their lips, but on their hearts are engraved the old Turkish saws which they follow as their standard of life and action. This tenacious devotion of the Turks to their traditional customs is a somewhat striking ethnological phenomenon. For there are few examples of a continuous and intensive contact between two heterogeneous racial elements in which the minority has been so little influenced by the majority as the Turks in Persia. Though bound together by
a common faith and by political interest, they are still as
mutually antagonistic as they were nearly three thousand
years ago, in the days of Zoroaster. The Persian still sees in the Turk the type of barbarism and ugliness as delineated in
the Shahname, while the Turk despises the Persian as
a coward. Hence a well-organized propaganda might probably without great difficulty succeed in consolidating the Turkish population of Persia and in bringing about the incor
poration of that country in a,n enlarged Asiatic Turkish
Empire.
Manner of Life. In their mode of life the Iranian Turks are
divided into two classes : the settled and the nomads or halfnomads. To the settled class belong those Turks of Azarbai
jan, Khamseh, Tehran, Irak, and partly also Khorasan, who
after the invasion of the Seljuks adopted the manner of life
of the Iranian population, settled down in towns and villages,
and devoted themselves to trade, industry, and agriculture. But it is to the latter occupation that they are chiefly addicted.



WESTERN TUEKS 209
because they took to it by way of cattle-breeding, which was
an element in their previous nomadism, whereas in trade and
industry their Persian neighbours, with their greater aptitude for these pursuits, have generally got the better of them. In the whole north-western part of Persia the country population
is exclusively Turkish ; in Azarbaijan and Khamseh this is also the case in the towns, while elsewhere the town population consists of a mixture of Turks and Persians. The change to settled existence came about chiefly after the rule of the Kajars
began, when the military and official class, attracted by the
life of ease now opened to them, grew more and more accustomed to fixed abodes, and exchanged the sword for the
plough.
As to the nomads and semi-nomads, they are by no means
new arrivals from the steppe who have begun to wander in Persian territory for want of arable land. They are original
nomads, who have been in the country for centuries, and,
owing partly to vicissitudes of history, partly to the strong national Turkish distaste for a settled life, have continued their old wandering habits. The territory in which these
Turkish nomads (called Hat, ' the people ') migrate can only be stated in a general way. Thus, the Shahsevens are chiefly to be found in the regions of Transcaucasia already mentioned,
but also in Khamseh and in the district of Tehran; the tribes
Khoja-ali, Begdilli, and Sheikhlu in Karabagh ; the Mah
mudlu in Maragha ; the Janbeglu, Imamlu, Avshars, and Usanlu, as also the Kajars, in Mazandaran ; and the Kashkais and Allah verdis in the south of Persia. The designation of nomad in the Central Asiatic sense of
the term is hardly applicable to any of the Turkish migratory tribes in Persia, because in the first place they lack extensive pastures, and their flocks and herds are, moreover, insignificant
compared with the Turkmen and Kirghiz scale. They breed
chiefly sheep, fewer camels, and still fewer horses. The sheep form a transition between the Central Asian , fat-tailed <5ype and those of Anatolia, while their horses are a cross between the original breed of the steppe and the Arab, but without the
speed or the endurance of their progenitors. The Shahsevens, the Kajars, and the Avshars appear to have the best horses.
The impression made on the observer by the Turkish nomads of Persia is one of poverty and wretchedness. They
TURANIANS



^
210 THE TURKISH DIVISION
live in long low tents which are made of woven horse-hair,
and are by Europeans generally called ' gipsy tents '. The interiors are bare and uncomfortable, suggestive of a people
that, without abandoning its ingrained love of wandering, has long lost the real spirit of the primitive nomad. Only the old clan conditions and the blind obedience to the tribal chiefs (Il-khan) have still to some extent been preserved among
them. All able-bodied men are ready to take up arms at the
summons of the chief. Thus the Il-khans of the Kashkais have succeeded down to modern times in inspiring the Persian Grovernment with fear. The same is the case in the north of
Persia, where the Khans still enjoy greater authority than the
Shah, who would take care to avoid meddling in the internal affairs of the various tribes. The patriarchal constitution of the Turkish nomads in Persia, and even in the Russian territory of Transcaucasia, has thus been but little modified by the
ruling power.
Language. As regards its linguistic character, the Turkish
of Azarbaijan is most closely connected with the Osman dialect, especially that spoken in Anatolia. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there was probably no difference at all between these two dialects, as at that time the Iranian Turks and the Osmans constituted one and the same tribe, the nearest kin to the Turkmens of to-day. The comparison of
the earliest linguistic records confirms this conclusion. A Turkish Seljuk poem dating from the thirteenth century and
the language of the historian Neshri, who lived in the second half of the fifteenth century, compared and contrasted with the Azarbaijan Turkish of to-day, show clearly that these two
old Turkish specimens are both grammatically and lexically very closely akin to the dialect of the present day Iranian
Turks. In course of time the Osman dialect, owing to special
cultural influences, diverged more and more from the common
language, while the Azarbaijan dialect remained essentially
unchanged. The Iranian Turks can understand the Osmans
much more easily than they can the Turkmens. Literature. Owing to the strong influence of Persian writers there has been little chance for the development of a national Turkish literature among the Iranian Turks. In
the first place, there have been very few Turkish literary men in Persia, and these have for the most part conformed to the



WESTERN TURKS 211
fashion of employing the Persian language. 'A small number
have, however, written Turkish poetry, which generally bears the stamp of Central Asian culture or resembles the popular lays of Anatolia. The works of some of the Turkish poets of Transcaucasia belonging to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries have been collected and published.^^ There is also a collection of epic songs by the national hero and national
bard Koroglu, who always appears as the prototype of the Turkish spirit and the true representative of Turanian heroism.
That the nucleus of this heroic saga ^^^ was brought with them
by the western Turks from their home in the steppes is un
doubted. The epic of Koroglu is known among the Uzbegs
and Turkmens in Khiva, by the Kazaks on the Sea of Aral and to the north-east of the Caspian, and westwards as far as the
coast of Syria. Though not of much linguistic value, this epic is all the more important as representing the national Turkish character. There are besides some wedding songs, parables, and proverbs that live in the tradition of the Iranian Turks and can all be traced to a Turkmen or Central Asian source. They all show how superficially centuries of Persian influence have affected the customs and the modes of thought of the
Iranian Turk. He still appears much nearer to his Central Asian kinsman than to the Osman, in spite of the bitter feuds that have raged for 400 years between the Shiite Turks and their Sunnite brethren in the north-east. History. When the Turks first entered Iran it is difiicult to say. But we know from the evidence of the Avesta that Turanians, that is, Turks, were on the borders of Iran and in conflict with its inhabitants many centuries b. c, and there
can be no doubt that the northern edge of Iran, that is, Khorasan, the southern shore of the Caspian, and Transcaucasia must from time immemorial have been subject to the invasions of single Turkish tribes and hordes. But the Iranian Turks of
to-da^^ are for the most part descendants of those Turks who invaded Persia from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries
during the Seljuk and the Mongol periods. Bibliography.

212 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
b. The Ottoman Turks
Habitat. The remainder of the "Western Turks inhabit the Turkish Empire, having moved farther away from their
original home than any other branch of their -race. By far
the most important tribe here are the Osmanlis or Ottomans. Though not distinguished from other Turks in language or
customs they have played a more prominent part in history than any other tribe of the race. This is the branch which
first became known to the west. They were originally a tribe, settled in the mountain district to the south and south-east of the Sea of Marmora, that took their name from their leader Osman. Their habitat at the present day is, in Europe, the south-east corner of the Balkan peninsula, and in Asia, Anatolia, Armenia, and Northern Syria. Number. In the absence of any trustworthy statistics it is impossible to give a probable estimate of the numbers of the
nomad and semi-nomad Turkish population of Asia Minor.
Vamb^ry, thirty- three years ago, thought the Yiiriiks numbered about 300,000. If this figure is approximately correct,
all these nomads taken together cannot exceed half a million, or rather less than 5 per cent, of the total population of the
Turkish Empire. It is probably considerably less. The total number of Turks, settled and nomad, in the whole Empire is about 9i millions. Of these less than two millions are to be found in Europe. The latter were probably never
more numerous m the past, because the object of their con
quests beyond Adrianople and Philippopolis was the spread of Islam and not of Turkish nationality ; for the Turks never
felt quite at home in Europe, and preferred Asiatic soil for their habitat. Name, The name of the Osmanli Turks is genealogical
rather than ethnic, for it means the clan of Osman and their descendants as opposed to Seljuks and other Turks. ' Otto
man '^^^ is only a modification of ' Othman' (the Arabic form
of ' Osman ') much as ' Turcoman '^^^ is of the correct ' Turkmen '. In the thirteenth century the whole of that part of Asia Minor which was inhabited by Turks was called Turk
menia, at least Marco Polo (ch. ii) speaks of the regions of Konia, Kaisari, and Sivas by that name. Similarly other
mediaeval travellers treat Turkmen as a collective national



WESTEEN TURKS 213
designation, while the individual is called Tiirk. The name Osmanli has become a sort of Imperial designation of the
religious and political unity of the Empire.
Race. To the ethnographer the Osman of to-day is a man
in whose veins Turkish blood constitutes an infinitesimally
small proportion, and whose physique shows not the slightest
trace of the Turkish type. His nationality is Turkish in a
political sense only; ethnologically it represents the most
varied conglomerate imaginable, an extraordinary mixture
of Turks with Aryan, Semitic and other races, such as Greeks,
Slavs, Kurds, Persians, Armenians, Georgians, Circassians, Arabs, Abyssinians, Sudanese, and so on. The Turanian type
has become so effaced that traces of it are very rarely to be
met with among them, while on the other hand representatives
of the pure Aryan or the pure Semitic type occasionally crop
up in this mixed population. The physique of the Osmans living in old Armenia, especially from Kars to Malatia, shows a predominantly Aryan type founded on a Kurdish basis. It
is only in Anatolia proper (the provinces of Aidan, Konia, Kastamuni, and Sivas) that the majority of the Osman popu
lation shows a certain uniform type evolved from a Greek substratum. Here the small number of immigrant Turks has
to such an extent been absorbed in the predominant original
Greek population that there has arisen a special Greek-Turkish type in which the Greek element prevails more and more as
the coast is approached. In regard to European Turkey,
Stamboul itself presents the highest degree of mixture be
tween Turks and the people of the nearer Asiatic, the Caucasian Greek, and the Slavonic types, so that the Moslem Osmanli is
indicated only by his dress, his head-gear, his beard, and his
shoes. Hence the Osman of the Bosphorus can be transformed
into a Greek or regular South European by mere change of
dress and other means of external adaptation. The same
applies to the remaining European Turks, except that among
them the southern Slav and the Albanian type predominates.
Nomad Tribes. The Osmanlis are, however, not the only
Turks in the Turkish Empire ; for after the defeat of the Em
peror Romanus at Manzikert (1071) Turkmens and Turks of
every description poured into Asia Minor. These are represented by a few single tribes which have remained nomads or semi-nomads and, being less mixed than the Osmanlis, have



214 THE TURKISH DIVISION
preserved more of the Asiatic type. The most numerous of these
are known as Yiiriiks, and Turkmens, who wander in various parts of Western and Southern Asia Minor, chiefly in the districts of Aidan, Marash, and Diarbekr. The Yiiriiks extend in small groups from the neighbourhood of Smyrna to the eastern
Taurus, and as marauders infest the whole of the south-western parts of Asia Minor. ' Yiiriik ' means ' nomad ', the name given them by their settled Turkish kinsmen, while they call them
^' selves ' Tiirk ' or ' Turkmen '. The Yiiriiks are the most
thoroughly nomadic of all the races of Antolia, preserving the old Central Asian nomadic habit with many customs accompany
ing it. They sometimes wander very great distances between
their summer and their winter haunts. The attempts of Abdul
Hamid to force them to settle were only partially successful. They resemble the Azarbaijans of Transcaucasia both in physique and in dialect rather than the Osmanlis. Thus they have retained a considerable number of old Turkish words ^ which in Osmanli have been modernized or replaced by ArabicPersian loan-words. Like other nomads the}^ attach great
importance to their division into tribes and clans. Some of their clan-names occur among the Turkmens also ; one of them, Kajar, is that of the Turkish family on the Persian throne. This shows the close connexion of these nomads with the steppe-dwellers of Northern Persia, and leaves no doubt as to
their Turknien origin. Down to the fifteenth century the Yiiriiks were joined by fresh accesssions of Turkish nomads,
and as they continued to adhere to their migratory habits,
they have remained racially and linguistically purer than their settled kinsmen in Asia Minor. Though they do not appear
to have a religion of their own, they are only nominally
Mohammedans. Their marriage customs are identical with those of the Azarbaijans. It is somewhat remarkable that their tents have not the same form as that of the Iranian Turks, but have retained the circular Central Asiatic shape. Their popular poetry, too, is more akin to that of the eastern than of the western Turks. Their chief occupation is the
raising, of live stock ; in particular they are great camel breeders. The Turkmen tribes extend widely over Anatolia, but their principal haunt is in the level plains around the great salt lake in the centre of the country and in the eastern Taurus



WESTERN TURKS 215
Mountains. They are already mentioned as nomads in the
twelfth century. They are a tall, powerfully built race, more
distinctively Asiatic in physical type and in occupation than
the settled Turks of the towns and villages, who are more like
Europeans. The Kizil-Bash Turks are found in the plains of Asia Minor around Angora, Tokat, and Karahissar. They are not Yiiriiks or Turkmens, but are for the most part descendants of Iranian Turks from Azarbaijan and Transcaucasia. They differ some
what from the surrounding settled Turkish population, both
in physique and customs. They are only semi-nomads, as they spend the winter in huts and to some extent engage in
agriculture. They call themselves Eski Turk. Their women are said to enjo}^ unusual freedom. They have a secret reli
gion in which Shiite tenets seem to be combined with older pagan elements. Other small fractions of half or entirely nomad Turks are
the Avshars in the Anti-Taurus, who according to their own tradition came from Khorasan and are probably related to
the Avshars who still live in that province, and from whom Nadir Shah emerged.
There are, besides, the Nogaians around Adana, who formerly consisted of 20,000 families, but by 1885 had been
reduced to only 2,000. This contingent of the Nogaians
migrated to Asia Minor from Russia after the Crimean War.
Language. When the Osmans appeared in Asia Minor they spoke the same inner Asiatic dialect which, with slight modifications, prevailed among the Turks from the T'ien Shan to the Ural. This appears from the evidence of the personal
Turkish names occurring in the earliest Osman historians, as
compared with the same names found in the Kudatku BiliTc
(1070), and in the chronicles of the Ghaznevids. But Islam exercised a more disintegrating effect on the language and literature of the Osmans than on those of any other branch of the Turks. Thus even in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries their literary language was filled with an immense number of
Arabic-Persian loan-words, as it has continued to be down to quite recent years, when the Pan-Turanian movement has been endeavouring to eliminate them. It is only the popular
songs of Anatolia that have partially preserved the stamp of
the Turkish popular spirit ; still more their proverbs and



216 THE TURKISH DIVISION
parables, many of which, have remained so unadulterated that they are still to be found in a literally identical form among the Turkmens and the Uzbegs of Khiva. Only very slight traces of the Turkish spirit survive in the Sharkis or ' love-songs ', which for the most part imitate Arabic and Persian models.
The music that accompanies these is of pure Persian origin. Old Turkish melodies are to be found among the Yiiriiks only.
The dialects of the settled Turks of Asia Minor may be divided into the northern, western, and southern, the varia
tions of which are, however, very slight. The philological evidence of these dialects shows that the ethnic basis of the
population speaking the first two was predominantly or perhaps exclusively Greek, while the third was fundamentally
Turkish. The southern dialect contains a considerable number of words akin to the Turkish of Central Asia : an indication
that its vocabulary was less exposed .to the denationalizing influence of Arabic and Persian literature than that of the
Osmanli literary and official language. A detailed study of these dialects will probably shed more light on the proportionate relations of the Turkish and the original elements in
the present population of Asia Minor. Civilization. The Moslem culture of centuries has produced
an Osman civilization greatly modified by climatic and by
Greek intellectual influences. In spite o the deep division between Moslems and Christians, the former were unable to remain unaffected by Byzantine culture. As long as society
was constituted on a nomadic military basis, the leaders of the Persian-Turkish world view, of which Konia, and later Brusa, were the centres, could remain unmoved. But when the Turks appeared on European soil and received a multitude of
Greek Christian neophytes, the foundations of Asiatic Moslem civilization were bound to be modified. Thus Byzantine architecture took the lead instead of the Persian Central Asiatic style. Selim I (1465-1521) introduced the custom of
shaving off" the beard, which among other Moslems, especially those of Central Asia, is strongly objected to, and by the
orthodox is regarded as downright apostasy. The adoption of
the short jacket (called salta) by the Osmans is reprobated by the adherents of the Moslem rules of dress, which require the
use of garments reaching to the ankles as well as concealing the contour of the body. These are some of the usages and



WESTERN TURKS 217
customs which can be attributed to Graeco-Byzantine influence only. Modifications of Turkish clothing and food have also been brought about by the requirements of the climate of Anatolia. Social History. Three successive main periods are observable in the history of the social life of theTurks. The first has a strongly marked Persian character, coming down to the consolidation of
the Ottoman State, especially to the conquest of Syria. During this period the Persian influence made itself felt both in everyday life and in literature. One of its manifestations is the predilection for Persian words and phrases which characterized
the first phase of Osman literature. The second stage bears
an Arabic stamp. In proportion as the Osmans subjected the
Arab element of the population, the Arabic influence as
embodied in the Kuran, increased more and more both in
language and in social life. Society assumed a strictly Mos
lem aspect, and even in popular language the commonest
ideas came to be expressed by Arabic words. The third
period began when the Osmans took root in Europe. Their upper classes were at that time already so permeated with Grreek elements that Hellenic blood flowed not only in the veins of single grand viziers, but even of influential Ulemas
(priests). For a considerable proportion of Byzantine intellect
was now in the service of the conquerors. Thus not only in
political administration, but even in ecclesiastical life, institutions and dignities came into being which were in opposition
to the real spirit of the Moslem-Asiatic world, and were forbidden as opposed to Moslem law. Only the power and
respect which the Osman procured for the doctrine of the
prophet were able to mitigate his transgressions and sinful
innovations in the eyes of the fanatics in the east. But
Arabs, Persians, Indians, Afghans, and Central Asians have
always regarded the Osmans as co-religionists whose manners
and customs were strange and surprising, without being able to account for the nature and causes of this divergence. Survival of few old Turkish customs. The strict centralization exercised since the middle of the sixteenth century by
Constantinople, the centre of this mosaic civilization, even on the most remote provinces of the Ottoman Empire, has naturally obliterated many old Turkish traits. The adoption of Persian culture resulted, as early as the beginning of the sixteenth



218 THE TUEKISH DIVISION
century, in the Osmans looking down on Turkish civilization, so that ' Turk ' and ' Turkish ' became synonymous with ' rude '
and ' uncouth '. Islam has always tended to denationalization, but it has nowhere worked more effectively in this direction than among the Osmanli Turks. Thus onl}^ a few of the old
customs which they brought with them from their home in the eastern steppes still survive among them. These are the
following. In the interior of Anatolia, especially among the
Turks of Tokat, Sivas, and Engiirii (Angora), a child at birth is bestrewn with salt and smeared with fat, as well as swaddled
in the same way as among the Kirghiz. At the wedding
ceremony the bride goes to the house of the bridegroom in the same festal manner (though no longer on horseback, but
in a palanquin) as is the custom of the Kirghiz ; similarly the daughter-in-law is not allowed to show her face to her fatherin-law, or to address him and her brothers-in-law by name.
The wedding formulas and songs resemble those of the Iranian Turks of Azarbaijan ; but of the Tcalim or price paid for the
bride, so universal among other Turks, there is no longer the slightest trace. Among domestic utensils the kettle
{kazan) still plays as important a role as is assigned to it by Turkish nomads in general. The Osman's predilection for the profession of arms and for the horse, but especially for cattlebreeding, is a reminiscence of his old manner of life. More
over, the thoroughly Hellenized Osman still pastures in the
valleys of Karaman the same species of sheep which his Turk
men ancestors brought with them from the banks of the Yaxartes and of the Tejend (Hari Rud), and which even after a separate existence of more than six centuries has not lost its excellence.
Characteristics. But what especially stamps the Osmanlis as Turks is the general character of their moral qualities, which,
in spite of the strong Islamic tinge it has acquired, shows a genuine Turkish groundwork that has prevailed over the
superimposed heterogeneous ethnic elements. Hence even though he may be like the Greek, the Armenian, or the Cir
cassian in features and build, the Osman in his mien and
bearing, in his movements and manners, betrays the real Turk. In his heavy and portly appearance, in his seriousness
and sedateness, he is exactly like his tent-dwelling kinsman of the steppes. The Anatolian peasant is honest, sober, and



WESTEEN TUEKS 219
industrious, suffers with the utmost patience the oppression of officials, makes great sacrifices for his sovereign and his faith ;

he is kind and unassuming in his domestic relations, and on the field of battle makes one of the best soldiers in the world.
It is somewhat surprising that all these good qualities no admixture of foreign blood has been able to extinguish. Political success of the Osmanlis. It is a striking fact that of all the Turkish tribes the Osmanlis have been the only one that has succeeded in establishing a permanent state. "Whereas the hordes of nomadic horsemen under Attila, Jenghiz Khan,
and Timur swept like a hurricane from the heart of the east far into Europe without leaving behind a trace of their power,
the Osmans were able to found a state which has lasted six
hundred years ; which, at the period of its culmination, by its extension far into three continents and its despotic rule over
peoples of various speech, faith, and colour, surpassed even the
Roman Empire in its prime ; and which the combined power of the west has only succeeded in reducing to comparative
impotence after a struggle of centuries. The opportunity for
the brilliant military triumphs of their early period was due to their having penetrated farther west than any other Turks,
and to their occupation of territory in immediate contiguity
to that of the Byzantine Empire at a time when that Empire
was in a condition of rapid decay. But how has this branch of the Turks been able to maintain for so long the dominion over foreign races which they established by the power of the sword ? There can be no doubt that this capacity has resulted partly from the strong admixture of Aryan blood and partly
from that fusion of Moslem Asiatic with Christian Occidental civilization which have transformed the Osmanli Turk. The Osmans brought with them from their home in the eastern
steppes the Turanian virtues of bravery, simplicity and the
patriarchal spirit, and spent the early period of their western
existence under the aegis of the comparatively higher Moslem
Persian civilization. When they appeared on the stage of
world history, they already approached, by the absorption of
so many Graeco-Slavonic elements, much nearer to Occidental
civilization than is commonly supposed. The official and
ruling class, even in the reign of Suleiman I (1520-66), during
which Turkey attained the highest point of her glory, had already lost several elements of the old Turkish national



220 THE TURKISH DIVISION
character, which, though capable of founding a military state,
had never possessed the art of maintaining it. The Osmanli
acquired this faculty by his occidentalization, aided no doubt by the unifying power of Islam, which he imposed on all
conquered nationalities. At the same time he retained the old Turkish submissiveness to and belief in despotic rule.
This trait has led to a degree of misgovernment never equalled in any other large state, because absolute power has been in
the hands of a long series of mostly incompetent and self
indulgent sultans controlling a highly centralized system,
which even the ablest and most industrious rulers could not have dealt with adequately. The result has been a general
condition of corruption and oppression prevailing not only in conquered countries, but even in the homeland of the Osmanlis.
The disintegrating influence of the political and social degradation working within has gone hand in hand with a number of unsuccessful wars, which have shorn the Empire of practically all its conquests and reduced it almost to the limits of
the area inhabited by the Osmanlis themselves. Had the
Osmans not spent their energies in long-continued conflicts with Hungarians, Germans, and Italians, but concentrated their attention on collecting and consolidating their scattered
Turkish-speaking kinsmen whom they left behind, and who extended from the T*ien Shan and the Altai to the Crimea and the Danube, they might have formed a much greater and much
more stable combatant power highly dangerous to western
civilization. But they lacked the necessary political insight.
The denationalizing influence of Islam made them forget their kinsmen in the east. As the vanguard of the Turks in the west they remained cut off from their motherland, without endeavouring to keep in intellectual touch with, and to reinforce their power from, Central Asia.
History. The starting-point in the political history of the Osmanlis is the period in which Er-tograul, or rather his son
Osman (died 1326) laid the foundation of the later Osmanli state. But we must go back more than 200 years before this
to reach the epoch at which the Turks, under the name of
Seljuks, first entered (1071) Armenia, Anatolia, and North Syria in considerable numbers. The Persian writer Mirchond ^"^ designates the Khazar steppe, that is, the region to the northeast of the Caspian, as the locality whence these Turks came.



WESTERN TURKS 221
and the neighourhood of Yend in the north of Bokhara as the
starting-point of Seljuk's march against Samarkand. Most Oriental authors represent the Seljuk Turks as belonging to the Oghuz, a Turkish tribe whose identity with the first Turks that in prehistoric times moved westward is undoubted.^^'^ These statements of Eastern authorities, taken in combination
with the evidence of the Seljuk dialect, justify the assumption that the majority of the Turkish invaders, under Seljuk and his descendants, of Northern Persia and Asia Minor were the blood relations of the present Turkmens who, in the eleventh
century and earlier, were in occupation of the steppes extending from the north of the Caspian to the Volga.
The successors of Osman rapidly overran the north-western part of Asia Minor and the south-western part of Europe, ultimately making themselves heirs to the old Seljuk Sultans
of Konia or Roum, and leaders of the entire Empire. At this time the Turkish power was bounded on the south by the Taurus Mountains ; it was not till the beginning of the sixteenth century that the Osmanli Sultans extended their sway south of the
Taurus, conqu ^ring Cilicia, Syria, and Egypt under Selim II
(1524-74). Judging by the Turkification of the names of Greek towns,
which was in existence even in the earliest period of Osmanli history, the influence of the Turkish language very soon began
to make itself felt in Anatolia. But the real Turkification did
not set in till the struggle of the Byzantine Emperors against
Turkdom had lasted nearly 200 years. It was chiefly the
Greeks and the Armenians who were most exposed to Turkification, while the Semites in the south, the Kurds in the east, and the Caucasians in the north were affected by it in a lesser
degree and at a later period. With the Greeks the trans
formation proceeded very rapidly. For after the lapse of scarcely a century it could be said in 1334 that, in the whole of Western Asia Minor, Philadelphia alone retained its Greek
character. It was the Osmans who energetically entered on
the policy of Turkification, because they rather than the Seljuks conceived the idea of developing a political state in Western Asia. The devastating incursions of the Turks caused the Greeks to flee first to the coast and then to Europe. The
interior of Anatolia thus becoming depopulated, the gaps were filled up by the influx of Moslem Turks. Hence by the end of



222 THE TURKISH DIVISION
the fourteenth century Anatolia was probably as much Turkified as it is to-day. Even in Europe the ethnic transformation produced by the Osmans was early concluded. Future of the Turkish race. Till the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917 it seemed likely that the two-thirds of the
Turkish race that are outside the Ottoman Empire, having
lost their political independence, were moving under the
guidance of Russia in a direction opposed to Moslem culture, and were tending either to absorption in Russianism or to
a stagnation of their own civilization. It also seemed probable
that the independent fraction, forming the inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire, after having lain for centuries under the blighting influence of Asiatic Moslem civilization, would have neither the will nor the power to pull themselves to
gether, and by assimilation to the over-mastering spirit ot the west, to escape destruction. Neither forecast, as matters
now stand, appears likely to be realized. On the one hand, Russian Turkestan has recently proclaimed itself an autono
mous republic, and the Turkestan extraordinary Mohammedan
general Congress has appointed a provisional government ,^^'^ and by the terms of the treaty recently concluded between Germany and Russia, the Transcaucasian regions of Batum, Ardahan, and Kars are to receive the right of ' self-determina
tion'. On the other hand, the Pan-Turanian propaganda from
Constantinople has already been set in motion ^^^ among remote tribes of the Turks,^^*"' such as the Yakuts of East Siberia, and even among non -Turkish Turanians. The Osmanlis and other branches of the Turks have, since their earliest appearance on the stage of history, been the embodiment of perpetual warfare and of brute force.' If the various sections of the race came to be united under the leadership of
a rejuvenated Turkey and were efficiently organized, such a combination might become a permanent source of unrest,
and in particular of danger to the Indian Empire.
Conclusions
Conclusions to be drawn from the data supplied above :
1. Owing to differences of religion, language, spheres of civilization, and to wide geographical separation, the Finns and Ugrians, the Samoyeds, the Tungus, the Mongols, and



WESTERN TUEKS 323
the Siberian Yakuts are not in the least likely to be drawn into the Pan-Turanian movement.
2. Owing to community of religion, language, race, type of
civilization, and geographical contiguity, the Pan-Turanian
movement might possibly succeed among the following Turkish peoples : the Osmanli, the Caucasian, the Persian, the Afghan, the Volga, the Crimean Turks, and those of Turkestan (East
and West), and of Siberia : a total population of 26,000,000. 3. Owing to their national indolence, to their political ineptitude, and to the steady diminution of the Turks of Anatolia,^^^ the best element in the Ottoman Empire, the Turkish peoples are not likely to combine, unless they allow themselves to be organized by an outside power, that is,
Grermany.^*^^
4. There is a risk of the Iranian Turks, who constitute oneiifth of, and the most warlike element in, the population of
Persia, combining, as a result of propaganda,^**^ with their
kinsmen and neighbours in the Caucasus, and ultimately entering into closer relations with the Ottoman Empire.^^^

returned yesterday, having carried through, under dangers and difl^iculties, an important diplomatic mission to the Amir of Afghanistan for the German Government. Hentig's activities are described as having frequently been the subject of discussion in the House of Commons, while The Times is said to have recently called him by the honourable name of ' * firebrand ". The expedition, which lasted
over two years, went via Persia, Afghanistan, Turkestan, and China, across the Pacific, and back to Germany by North America and
Norway.
The activities of Dr. von Hentig in China, Turkestan, and Afghanistan were described in a dispatch from our Peking Correspondent
published in The Times of April 10 last. Hentig, after being thrown
out of Afghanistan, proceeded to Yarkand, and by lying and bribery induced the local Sarts and Kerghiz in Hi to rise and murder many
Russian subjects, including women and children. In their turn, thousands of the deluded rebels were killed, while Hentig marched comfortably across China to the security of the German Consulate at Hankow.' Hentig is twice mentioned as an associate of Capt. Niedermayer in German Intrigues in Persia : The Diary of a German Agent [W. Grie
singer] : The Niedermayer Expedition through Persia to Afghanistan and India (translated from the German), London, 1918.
B.
THE DISTURBANCES IN SEMIRECHIE
From Official Data.
Extract from Semirechenskia Ohlastnia Viedomosti, Nos. 200-215.
*0n the evening of 30th August (1916), news arrived concerning the disturbance near Merke and in the region between Aulie-Ata



230 APPENDIX
and Merke. It is clear that the rumours were exaggerated beyond measure. By the 5th September it was ascertained that the centre of the
uprising of the Kirghiz of Syr-Daria was, as a matter of fact, not at Merke, but in the valley of the Chu (whence the bands make their appearance periodically) and near the post route. Troops have already been sent there. Moreover, the detachment of 2nd Captain Poltoratski, with Lieutenant Levashof to help him, has been sent from the direction of Pishpek.
Noteworthy information arrived, which was no mere rumour, concerning events which had taken place in Semirechie between the dates of 30th August and 5th September. The district of Prjevalsk was in a very bad plight. Only the town itself remained
intact, and a small part, Preobrajensk to Teplokliuchinsk, as well as the village of Mikhail obsk (Sukhomlinovsk) and the Cossack villages of Nikolaevsk. All the rest was in ruins. There were many victims.
The monastery of Issyk-Kulsk had not escaped violence. (No. 200.)
On the 5th September, official information of the 1st September was received from the district of Prjevalsk. This made it clear that
the uprising in the district had begun by a Kirghiz attack on the vil
lage of Gregorevka near Sazanovka, on the evening of the 9th August. By the morning of the 10th the uprising had already spread to Preobrajensk. The same day the insurgents undertook an attack
upon Prjevalsk. The town was fortified ; there were 42 men belonging to the frontier guards on the spot, and 86 rifles among the inhabitants. Peasants from the neighbouring villages arrived daily. They related that the Kirghiz at first confined themselves to plundering, but eventually began to massacre the Kussians. The school of rural economy was destroyed, the inmates of the school and the
peasants who had taken refuge there were killed. The inhabitants
of the villages of Pokrovsk, Svetloi Poliana, Ivanitsk, Vysok, Bogatyrsk, and Lipinsk had reached Prjevalsk. The inhabitants of the
villages of Lizogubovsk, Sokolovsk, Otradny, Kazdolni, Graf Palen, Valerianovsk, and Bobrik had collected at Teplokliuchinsk, where they successfully withstood a siege. The villages on the south bank, Issyk-Kulya Tarkhany, Barska-Un, and Gogolevka, suffered most of all, and the population of Koltsovka was killed, including Kaichef,
the assistant district chief. Of the convoy of Kaichef only 5 men of the lower ranks returned. All the inhabitants of the village of Kybache reached Prjevalsk in boats, and those of the villages on the north bank and of the monastery collected in Preobrajensk.
On the evening of August 15th, Cavalry Captain Kravchenko arrived from Karkara with a company of the Drujina of Jarkensk



THE DISTUEBANCES IN SEMIEECHIE 231
and 30 Cossacks under Cornet Berg. He was accompanied by the inhabitants of Karkara and of the villages of Tavrichesk and Vlaislavsk.
On 19th August, Ensign Kyskin brought to Prjevalsk the inhabitants of the hamlets of Meshchansk, Krasnoiarsk, Novokievsk, and of the colony of Ohotnichi. All the refugees found shelter in the town. On 16th August a detachment of mounted troops under the Uralian Ouchinnikof was sent to rescue the inhabitants of Sazanovka, where, during six days, the peasants and the soldiers of Cornet Pokrovski had been resisting the Kirghiz. Pokrovski and Ouchinnikof brought the
inhabitants of Sazanovka, Semenovka, Gregorevka, and Kamenka in safety to Preobrajensk.
On the 19th or 20th, the sotnia of Cornet Ugreninof entered
Prjevalsk. Things had recently quieted down. The Kirghiz had begun to leave for Syr-Daria. On 28th August, Berg routed a band, destroying 800 desperate fighters, and dispossessed them of a huge quantity of cattle and sheep. According to a statment made by the prisoners taken from
the insurgents, the latter tvere led hy a TurMsh General and two Europeans. According to the assertions of the prisoners, the General and the unknown Foreigners had taken part in the battle on the Kastek. The same Berg and the Engineer Golovin were
sent on two other expeditions, which, moreover, met with complete success. On 27th August, the detachment of Sotnik Volkof entered
Prjevalsk. On 1st September, the detachment of Bychkof (Voiskovoi Stai-shina) entered Prjevalsk in safety. Instead of crossing by the Aksuiski Pass, where the heat had made huge crevasses in the glaciers, the detachment was obliged to cross the mountains at the station of
Choktal by a goat-track ; nevertheless, they covered the distance in 7 days (from Verni to Prjevalsk). They saw .many victims of the rising. The telegraph was completely destroyed, but in the monastery the churches, the dwelling-places, and the defences were intact. Bychkof and his men picked up on the way, and brought to Preobra
jensk, 4 men, 10 women and girls, and 50 children.
Judging by Colonel Ivanofs supplementary report, the garrison
had to work hard. On 13th August he summoned a special council of war, consisting of Generals (retired) Korolkof and Narbut, General Krasnoslobodski, and a number of officers and doctors. This council distributed the relugees, saw to the defences of the town and its



232 APPENDIX
surroundings, conducted requisitions, and devised military measures. The engineers and officials among the newcomers took part in the council. On 3rd September, the Voiskovoi Starshina Bychkof, with the detachment of Sotnik Volkof, was ordered to set out for the Syrty
to destroy the insurgents who were withdrawing. According to the report of Colonel Ivanof, the crops were neither burnt nor trodden down. This being the case, the peasants would be sent back to
their villages, on the first peaceful opportunity, to gather in the crops. (No. 201.)
The village of Stolypino (Kochorka, " circonscription " boundary of Narynsk) was the first victim of the rebellious Kara-Kirghiz of the
neighbouring communes. On 8th August it was surrounded by the Kirghiz ; the peasants defended themselves for two days until they were relieved by a small detachment of troops from Naryn.
The Kirghiz, however, continued the siege and set fire to the village :
the bazaar, the prayer-house, and other buildings were burnt. The detachment decided to make for Tokmak, taking all the villagers with
them. From Kybach onwards the detachment was continually attacked, especially while crossing the narrow ravine of Boamsk. All the stations and bridges were burnt, and the telegraph line was
destroyed. The Kirghiz kept up a fairly accurate fire on the detach
ment from the overhanging rocks and hill-tops. The ^ ' Intendance " bridge over the river Chu near Kok-Mainak was burnt, so that the stream of refugees was obliged to ford the deep and rapid river under fire. About 10 women and children were drowned here. The Kirghiz rolled down stones on to the road to stop the troops. According to eye-witnesses' accounts, the attack was fiercest at the Semenovsk bridge, where the Kirghiz fired fusillades at the troops and fugitives.
A great number of horses were killed, and about 40 carts abandoned on the road. The sick and wounded from the village of Bystroretsk (about 8 in number) were sent to Tokmak, but the refugees went on to Kara-Bulak (Mikhailovsk), where they were soon joined by the
peasants from the villages of Orlovsk, Belopiketsk, and Bystrorechensk. The villagers of Novorossisk (in the Bolshaia Keben) were particularly heroic. They organized a kind of fortification in the middle of the
village, and held out for 12 days against the Kirghiz-Sarybagish, the
chief leaders of the revolt, by whom they were surrounded. All the streets in the village of Novorossisk leading towards the peasants' fortifications were strewn with Kirghiz corpses. The peasants of Novor .... are at present at Samsonovskaia station, where they have
been treated liberally. (No. 204.) The Prjevalsk and Karkarinsk Kara-Kirghiz have concentrated on



THE DISTUEBANCES IN SEMIEECHIE 233
the Tekes and the Siiimb. The Chinese Kalmuks had received bribes from them, but the regular Chinese troops refused to let the insur
gents pass. A division is now taking place among the latter, part having decided to throw themselves on the mercy of the Russian Government. The communes plunder each other mutually, and the situation of the insurgents bids fair to become very serious in the future. The Kara- Kirghiz of the south bank of the Issyk-Kul and a portion of the Pishpensk intend apparently to escape over the frontier to Aksu, but the Chinese troops have set out irom Uch-Turfan to meet them. All the most turbulent elements of the different communes of the districts of Vernensk and Pishpensk have assembled at Balkhash.
The peaceful Kirghiz at first gave them all the help they could, but
now strife has also arisen at Balkhash. There is no bread to be had, and the rebels are living on mutton and berries. (No. 207.)
The telegraph to Prjevalsk was restored on the 15th September. The line to Naryn will soon be restored.
The insurgents from Kochorka have left, having been dispersed by the troops ; part have gone to the Ulakhol towards the south bank of the Issyk-Kul, and part to the Jumgal. They were there encountered
by fresh troops. In the district of Prjevalsk many Russian prisoners were set free.
The latter state that the insurgents are in a great state of discouragement, and the irreproachable attitude of the Chinese Government
causes them particular apprehension. They hoped they would be welcomed with open arms, as they had been assured hy agitators that there would soon be war between China and Russia. Nevertheless, the Chinese sent forward troops and received the insurgents with
artillery fire. The provincial administration has just come to a very important
conclusion, concerning the revolt of the Kara-Kirghiz. As a result of the report of the district administration and the military leaders, the head military Governor decides that the conduct of the rebels of
the districts of Pishpensk and Prjevalsk affords no hope for the future that Russians and Kara-Kirghiz can live on good terms in the same region. The behaviour of the insurgents has always been outrageous, and the Russian population has suffered far too much at their hands for them to continue as neighbours. As a proof of this
there is the fact (according to the data given by the refugee organization) that the number of victims in the sector of Issyk-Kul is over
3,000, of whom there are about 2,000 killed, and more than 1,000
missing.



234 APPENDIX
Certain measures have, of course, been already adopted as reprisals against the insurgents. Many thousands of Kirghiz have been killed by the troops. Their camps are being destroyed, and an enormous
number of their flocks are already in the hands of the army and administration. Punitive troops are in hot pursuit of the rebels,
inflicting fresh losses upon them and setting free many prisoners.
But this is not all : the principal result of the combined operations of the troops is that all the rebels are now driven into such mountainous regions that they will soon feel the full effects of their foolish
revolt, owing to hunger and cold. Information is already coming in as to their privations, the sickness that is rife among them, and their utter confusion. The troops have been ordered to give no quarter to the
enemy. A part of the rebels may perhaps make their way into China, but the Chinese authorities will not admit them all. The insurgents know well that it is useless for them to seek to make peace at present. They will receive no mercy. Sooner or later, time will oblige them to repent and accept any conditions that may be imposed upon them. Then, and then only, may their voices be heard by the authorities.
The basis for future discussion with the Kara-Kirghiz will be clearly of a special nature.
In the first place, it is recognized as absolutely inadmissible that the Kara-Kirghiz should return to the Keben valley and the east part of the Chuiskaia valley around Tokmak.
Secondly, it is recognized that the banks of the Issyk-Kul should be cleansed of the Kara-Kirghiz for ever. Thirdly, it is recognized that the valley of the Tekes should become
a region exclusively Russian. Every rebel community of the places already mentioned, whatever its size may prove to be, is to be relegated to the mountainous tract in the southern half of the district of Prjevalsk, to the region of Lake Son-Kul, and to the boundary of Atbashinsk. The status of
these communities is to be that of purely pastoral people.
A new form of government has to be organized for them. The military will be stationed at a series of newly -fortified points, and will
support the government. All these projects w^ere submitted in general terms by special telegram to the General Governor in chief of the region. General
Adjutant Kuropatkin recently confirmed in principle the views of the administration of Semirechie, giving instructions to elaborate the
said schemes in detail, with plans, maps, and statistics. (No. 216.)'



CONFISCATION OF LAND IN TURKESTAN 235
Journal, 28th October, 1916.
