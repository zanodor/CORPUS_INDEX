INTRODUCTION
I n Japanese mythology, gods are born from the eyes or noses of oth
gods. They marry their brothers or sisters. They produce food out
their rectums. They get mad and chop one another up into pieces.
One god yanks down her clothing and performs a dance in front of
the other gods and they all crack up laughing.
None of this is precisely the behavior the Japanese people
expect from themselves, however. In fact, Japanese people often
behave quite conservatively and are famous for valuing courtesy,
restraint, and cleanliness. Yet outrageous behavior is pretty normal
in Japanese mythology. The behavior of the gods is strange at best,
and sometimes disgusting. It usually does not set a direct example
for human beings of how to behave. Sometimes the message seems
to be that the gods do not have traits that are human. While they
may be described as though they are human, they are not. In many
creation myths, for example, gods exist in a realm quite different
from the one in which humans inhabit. In these myths, gods live in
a world that existed before creation, before the sun and the moon,
and before the land and the sea. It represents a time before the laws
of nature existed and before human laws and customs existed either.
Japan's name in Japanese, Nihon or Nippon, comes from the
Chinese characters that mean "origin of the sun." Japan is to the
east of China—the direction from which the sun rises. According
to Japanese myth, the Japanese people are the children of the

red circle on it. That red

Japan's native
religion, Shinto, is
based upon the
worshipping of
many gods and
spirits; the word
Shinto means
"the way of the
kami." In Japanese,
gods are known as
kami, and they are
believed to inhabit every living thing,
including humans, as well as nonliving things like rocks, trees,
waterfalls, or buildings. Many of the stories that make up Japan's
mythology revolve around the sun goddess Amaterasu.

JAPAN
erhaps the most important thing to
remember about Japan is that it is an
island nation: an archipelago of small,
mountainous islands possessing few
natural resources. Unlike many
modern countries, Japan is
largely homogeneous ethnically:
almost all the people there
share the same heritage and
customs.
Throughout their history,
the Japanese have learned
things from other cultures and
then made these things their
own. They learned writing and
centralized government and

Buddhism from the Chinese in the 500s. They learned technology
from the United States and Europe in the nineteenth century and
again in the twentieth. Anything they learn—how to manufacture
automobiles or cellular phones, for example, or how to figure skate
or play baseball—they rapidly do as well as, or better than, whomever
they learned it from. The Japanese are famous for this trait.
Historically, periods of intense learning in Japan have alternated
with periods of withdrawal from the rest of the world. During these
times, Japan takes advantage of being an island nation. It shuts itself
from other countries and rediscovers its own identity, as it did between
the beginning of the 1600s and the middle of the 1800s. For 250
years, the Tokugawa shogunate banned travel to foreign countries
and all trade with Europe and the United States.
Having adopted Buddhism as a religion and added it to Shinto,
the native Japanese religion, Japan attempted in the nineteenth
century to reject Buddhism and reestablish Shinto. This was in part
a response to Japan's having had its national doors pried open by
the West: In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry arrived with a fleet
of ships and forced Japan to open trade relations with the United
States, and then with Europe. Emperor Meiji, who was then
restored to power after years of military dictatorships, decided it
was time to modernize. He wanted Japan to compete economically
in the industrializing world, but he still did not want the Japanese
to lose their identity. What resulted was a period of strong nationalism
and the use by the government of certain elements of traditional
Japanese mythology. One of these myths said that the emperor was

the direct descendant of the goddess of the sun
and was himself a god. This myth reiterated that
Japan was a superior nation because of its line
age. For a time, this myth was also understood
to mean that the emperor had a right to rule
the world.
Industrialized Japan
Japanese businesses flourished, and so did its
economy. Japan industrialized rapidly. In just a
few years, it successfully went from being an
agricultural nation to one with the highest gross
national product (GNP) in the world. Then, during
World War II, Japan fought on the side of the
Axis powers, with Germany and against the
United States and Russia. Japan entered the
war in a dramatic way on December 7, 1941, by
bombing the United States naval base at Pearl
Harbor. The bombing killed more than 2,000
American sailors and brought America into
the war. Japan surrendered only after the

United States returned the aggression and dropped atomic bombs
on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Emperor Hirohito
renounced his claim to being a god and Shinto was ended as the
official national religion. The Japanese again industrialized with
such speed and efficiency that many people are still writing books
trying to figure out how they did it. Yet, throughout all the periods
when the state decreed a religion, the Japanese have continued to
tell their myths to each generation and continued to visit Shinto
shrines and Buddhist temples.

M uch of what makes a
culture unique is its tradi
tions. A culture's ways of
eating, speaking, dressing,
and celebrating holidays
are passed down from one
generation to another, by
word of mouth, in writing,
or by example. These
traditions may change
through time, as technology
advances or as cultures
are influenced by one
another, but it is still
possible to see distinct
patterns in the traditional
behavior of a people.

The Magic of Mythology
Storytelling is one important part of traditional culture. These
stories can be about heroes or villains, creation or destruction, great
battles won or lost, epic journeys, or the adventures of children or
animals. A myth is a special kind of story.
Myths, Legends, Folktales, and Fairy Tales
Often, though not always, people recognize a difference between
true stories and stories that the teller and the audience know are
told for entertainment. Yet even stories that aren't true communicate
values. We don't think stories like that of Cinderella are true; still,
we know that the story tells us that Cinderella's behavior is preferable
to her sisters' behavior—especially in the German version in which
little birds peck out the eyes of Cinderella's sisters. Fairy tales, like
legends and myths, offer an insight into the ways in which we feel
about ourselves and the people and the world around us.
Myths are another kind of story, originally passed down orally,
by word of mouth. People who study traditional stories sometimes
say that the difference between a myth and a folktale is that a myth
is told as true. Myths are stories that people believe or at least that
the people of their culture tell them to believe. As opposed to a
legend, like those about Paul Bunyan or Johnny Appleseed, a myth
may be set in the distant past, in a time before the world existed as it
does now. Myths may contain information about gods or supernatural
beings, or interactions between gods and humans. Myths often
explain how things came to be the way they are now and answer

questions about the origin of Earth and of life: Where did the
world come from? How did the sun and the moon come to inhabit
the sky? Why do people have to die? What happens to us after
death? Why are there men and women?
Myths that account for how the world is ordered, how it began,
and, often, the place of human beings in the grand scheme of things
are cosmologies, or cosmogonies, from the Greek word kosmos
14



The Magic of Mythology
meaning "order." Myths tell people how to behave toward a god or
gods and toward one another. They explain why people celebrate
certain holidays or conduct certain rites (traditional activities or
ceremonies like those associated with birth, becoming an adult,
marriage, and death). Myths are often about matters that are
mysterious and unknowable. Often, though not always, they are
sacred and are related to a culture's religion.
15



JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
Around the end of the 1700s, the artist Torii Kiyonaga created this image of a Japanese ritual: the marriage ceremony.
Myths also deal with heroes who may be part human and part
divine. Some Japanese myths after the introduction of Buddhism tell
of great Zen masters, warriors, or monks. They, like the Buddha
himself, are historical figures who become supernatural, which
poses no problem for a culture in which people became gods after
death anyway.
16



The Magic of Mythology
Interpreting Mythology Through the Ages
If your first thought when you hear the word "myth" is "falsehood,"
you might be interested in knowing that the Greek philosopher
Plato said it before you did. In the early fourth century BCE, Plato
contrasted rational argument with mythic thought. Plato believed that
mythology was the opposite of reason. Today's understanding that a
myth is an incorrect explanation for a scientific or historical event
comes from Plato and the ancient Greeks. The thinking of the Greek
philosophers paved the way for the modern scientific method and for
a way of looking at and examining evidence. It did not bring myth
or religion to an end, however, or even stop myths from developing
since Christianity and Islam became world religions after Plato, but
it suggested a different way of asking and answering questions about
the creation of the world.
The tension between these ways of examining the world has
remained important throughout the ages. During the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, a time known as the Age of Enlightenment,
scientific thinkers again rejected myths. Thinkers of the Enlightenment
believed mythology got in the way of genuine inquiry. Why did people
believe such stories? they wondered. After considering the newly
"discovered" (and conquered) peoples of the New World, scholars
suggested that mythology represented a kind of universal "childhood
of man," when cultures created myths to explain things they otherwise
could not understand.
17



JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
It is not only the Japanese people who have stories to explain their origins. A 1534 Bible included this picture of God creating Adam and Eve, the Garden of Eden, and the sun, moon, stars, and sky around them.
18



The Magic of Mythology
Why Are Myths from Distant Cultures Similar?
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, scholars studying the
myths of various cultures began to wonder why myths showed so many
similarities even though the cultures themselves were so different.
Did all the myths begin in one part of the world and then travel with
various cultures as they migrated and merged? India was suggested
as one possible geographical point for the source of world mythology.
At that time, scholars interested in learning the origin of language
were trying to explain the similarities among many European and Near
Eastern languages. The scholars traced the languages back to an
earlier Indian language and then documented how it had changed as it
developed. Some scholars believed that the spread of cultures accounts
for the similarities among mythologies. In some instances, this is
correct. Some Asian myths resemble one another because the cultures
were exchanging those stories.
Another way of explaining the similarities in myths was suggested
in the twentieth century by psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. He sug
gested that myths (and dreams) represent in symbols the basic aspects
of human experience. Freud believed that the most basic forces in
human nature are aggression and love. To Freud and to his student,
Carl Jung, myths were not leftovers from the "childhood of man"
and the similarities in myths were not due to their having spread
from one original source. Freud believed that myths were vital and
necessary expressions of essential parts of the human mind and the
human experience.

JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
A Shared Human Experience
Anthropologists and folklorists—social scientists who study cultures
and their traditions—look at myths as a reflection of the basic values
of the culture in which they are told. If, as it seems, most cultures
have needed to account for the origins of the world and of the
place of human beings in that creation, what do the specific stories
of these events tell us about the culture? What do the myths tell
the people about themselves? In what way do the myths tell people
what to value and how to live? This approach asks about differences
among mythologies as well as their similarities. Human beings are
born, grow up, grow old, and die; we love and hate our families;
we see the sun come up in the morning and we wonder at the
vastness of the stars. And yet cultures celebrate and mourn in
different ways. They disagree about whether evil is basic to human
nature or whether people are basically good. They emphasize the
individual more than the group or vice versa. They understand
gods, humans, and animals to be quite different with a clear hierarchy
among them, or they understand a world in which gods dwell in
every rock and rodent. The study of a culture's myths is one way to
look at these differences. In doing so, we can try to understand
how other peoples see their world.

power and ought to be revered. Kami include not only mysterious
beings that are noble and good but also malignant spirits that are
extraordinary and deserve veneration." Anything that inspires
feelings of awe, anything unusual in nature—a waterfall, an ocean,
an unusually shaped rock—houses a kami. Thunder is the kami that
rumbles. The emperor is a kami and so are one's ancestors. Even an
object made by human beings, like a boat, may contain a kami. In
fact, everything is potentially a kami. "I do not yet understand the
meaning of the term kami," Norinaga admitted, having studied the
matter at length.
During ancient times, honoring the kami was not part of an
organized religion. Japan was a series of islands and it had no
central government. Social organization was based on clans, tribes,
and extended families. People tilled the land, planted rice, and
honored the kami at shrines and in their homes. Probably many of
the kami were known only to the family that honored them or to the
people of one town. One of the ancient Japanese chronicles says,
"In their world myriad spirits shone like fireflies and every tree and
bush could speak."
We know that around the third or fourth century CE, the
Japanese people told stories and built shrines to some important kami.
One is the shrine of Amaterasu, the kami of the sun. She, like the
kami of the moon and storm and others—the "kamis of the heavenly
plain"—more closely resemble the ancient gods of the Romans or
Aztecs. They are very powerful, not of the earth, and immortal. A
shrine in Ise contains the Sacred Mirror, which has an important
role in a myth about Amaterasu.
22



Japanese Mythology
Shinto
Honoring the kami became known as Shinto—which simply means
"the way of the kami"—only after it needed to be distinguished from
Buddhism, which was brought to Japan from Korea in 522 CE. By
this time, writing had been introduced from China, and the stories
of the kami were written down as well as passed along by word of
mouth. However, the earliest text we have of Shinto stories is from
712 CE. Written at the emperor's request, it is called Kojiki, or
"Record of Ancient Matters." It includes myths about the creation
of the world and of the islands of Japan, the origins of the sun and
moon, and how death came into the world. The Kojiki also explains
the necessity of washing and ritual purification, both essential to
Shinto and to Japanese culture.
Shinto is a religion that concentrates on our life in this world.
Although its myths speak of the heavens (the High Plain of Heaven,
from where the original gods came) and of an underworld (the Dark
Land, an unclean place), they did not resemble a Christian heaven
or hell. Neither is a place where people go to be punished or
rewarded after death. The Kojiki includes no commandments or
explicit rules for how to live. It does not even say that people have
to believe in the kami: it just tells the tales. The Kojiki also gives a
genealogy (family tree) of the gods, which says that the emperor's
family is descended from the kami of the sun. (The command to
write the Kojiki was intended to strengthen the imperial family's right
to rule at a time when Buddhism and other Chinese influences were
emerging and the various tribes were not yet fully under the emperor's

power. The book was meant to establish that
the emperor wasn't just any kami but was
descended from the most important kami.)
Unlike many other religions, Shinto was
not and is not based on a holy book or on the
agreement to believe certain stories or teach
ings. Shinto did not originate from a single
person's beliefs or experiences. At the core of
Shinto are the spiritual rites of washing and
purification and offerings to the kami, such
as food or tokens that have been bought at
the shrines. These tokens usually accompany
a prayer or a request. Shinto also has its roots
in communal and family festivals celebrating
the annual spring planting and fall harvest,
as well as births and marriages. Because the
kami are everywhere, in everything, Shinto
honors and focuses on nature.
This idea of paying attention to nature is
important because each kami has the power
to be creative or destructive, gentle or fierce.
The rituals help people avoid the destructive,
angry aspects of the kami. They also help
The Kojiki-the "Record of Ancient Matters" contains Shinto stories that were already old when they were written down in 712 CE by order of the emperor.

Before they enter a Shinto shrine, people purify themselves by washing in the river. Cleanliness and purification were important when this picture was painted in the late 1500s, and they are still an important part of Japanese culture.
26



Japanese Mythology
people avoid the aggressive, destructive aspects of themselves.
There is little sense in Japanese mythology of an ongoing fight
between good and evil. Still, humans sometimes do wrong and
must recognize these wrongs and purify themselves.
Shinto Myths
People had told some of these Shinto myths for centuries before they
were written down. When they were documented in the Kojiki,
they were written down for the emperor, at his command, at a
time when Japan was reflecting on its relationship to Chinese and
Korean cultures. The Shinto myths in the Kojiki are official versions,
intended (among other things) to prove divinity of the emperor.
But before that, there were already many written and oral versions
of these myths. Even before writing, there was the katari-be, the
"corporations of reciters," who had, however, become less important
after the stories were documented in writing. As is often true, many
versions of the myths existed. There wasn't necessarily a "right" one.
Buddhism
Buddhism was introduced in Japan in the sixth century CE when the
Korean king sent the Japanese emperor a golden statue of the Buddha.
Buddhism, by this time, was 1,000 years old and had already taken
many forms in various regions throughout the world. Unlike Shinto, a
Japanese tradition that had no specific founder or dogma, Buddhism
27



JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
After Buddhism was introduced in Japan, it merged with Shinto. This statue of the Buddha, the religion's founder, is from the thirteenth century, when Buddhism was becoming more important in Japan.
28.



Japanese Mythology
had priests, many written texts, and well-defined beliefs. Central to
these is the belief that people are meant to gain wisdom and eventually
free themselves from the cycle of reincarnation—death and rebirth
and from a physical world of suffering.
It was Chinese Buddhism rather than the Korean form of
Buddhism that was eventually accepted by the Japanese court
and then by the people. Rather than replacing Shinto, however,
Chinese Buddhism was absorbed and changed, as Japanese society
adapts and reinterprets everything it learns from other cultures. If we
imagine culture as a rich soup, then the addition of Chinese Buddhism
in Japan wasn't like adding noodles, which are independent from
the broth, but rather like adding an ingredient that becomes part
of the broth itself. This combination of Shinto and Buddhism
remains to this day. Buddhism added to Japanese religion a concept
of an afterlife—a time when people are judged, then rewarded or
punished. The lines between Buddhism and Shinto are often
blurred. The merging of Buddhist and Shinto teachings is even
referred to as Ryobu-Shinto, or "Double-Shinto."
Buddhism teaches personal salvation and escape from the
cycle of life, death, and rebirth, but it split into various branches.
Originally it taught that people must follow the teachings of the
Buddha—the person who began the religion, who then became
the subject of many myths. Another branch said that people could
get help from innumerable smaller gods, though they are actually
more like saints, or, in Japan, which adopted this form of
Buddhism, like kami.
29



JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
Buddhist Gods
Bodhi Dharma, an Indian monk who traveled to China, began Zen
Buddhism. One day while practicing meditation, he fell asleep.
When he awoke, he was so angry
with himself that he cut off his
eyelids, ensuring that he would
never sleep again. From his eye
lids grew the first tea plants. Tea
is sacred to Zen Buddhists; it also
contains enough caffeine to help
people not fall asleep. Although
Bodhi Dharma is presumed to be
a historical character, the myth
resembles the Shinto myth in which
the body parts of a dismembered
god are transformed into foods
that are essential to the culture.
There are three distinct
Buddhist deities in Japan—Amida,
Kannon, and Jizo—and they are
considered gods of mercy. (There
are also many other deities, though
they are lesser known.) The first

Zen Buddhism, has an un-Japanese appearance in this portrayal showing him with a bushy beard and eyebrows.

derived from the Sanskrit figure Amitabha since India is the birth
place of Buddhism. Amida is a bodhisattva ("an enlightened being")
who postponed the opportunity to obtain his own salvation until all
humans had been saved.
The second god of mercy, Kannon, is another bodhisattva whose
desire to protect humanity comes in the form of a postponed salvation.
He is the god who protects children (and women during childbirth).
Japanese Buddhists turn to Kannon for wisdom and counsel. Kannon
is usually depicted as Senju Kannon, or the "Kannon of a Thousand
Arms." These images are similar to those of Indian bodhisattvas with
all of their arms outstretched in a pose showing their compassion. In
Japan, Senju Kannon is also usually seen with a miniature Amida
on his head. Kannon is sometimes depicted holding a lotus, or as a
horse-headed figure with a third eye.
Jizo is the third Buddhist god of mercy. Like Kannon, he protects
children, especially those who have died. Jizo also protects human
souls who are in pain. Japanese Buddhists believe Jizo can redeem
troubled souls from hell. Temples honoring Jizo are popular in Japan.

JAPANESE GODS AND GODDESSES
.he Japanese say there are more than eight million or "800
myriad" kami. This isn't meant as a definite number. Eight
million is another way of saying countless—or even infinite
since everything and everyone is a potential kami.
Of those countless kami, some are like the gods and
goddesses of Greece, Rome, and Egypt. They are
from a time before the world was modern,
when the kami created and fought with
one another, brought death into the
world, and sometimes behaved
in evil ways such as destroying
irrigation ditches and murdering
relatives. They also behaved

in ways that Japanese people are supposed to, such as purifying
themselves with water. The tendency of gods to do horrific actions is
just one of the things that has made myths interesting and confusing
for thousands of years.
Sometimes it's helpful to think of the kami as demonstrating
what Japanese should not do. Their misadventures show us what
they can get away with—or not—but what we as mere humans most
definitely cannot. Their behavior demonstrates that they are not of
our modern world but rather of an earlier time. When a god goes
into the underworld and gets into trouble, it tells us that we are
supposed to leave the underworld untouched. We also learn what
the culture's idea of the underworld is. In the case of the Japanese/
Shinto myth, it is a place of impurity and decay.
The Heavenly Deities
Before there was breath or form, before heaven and earth were
separated, before there were names, the first three kami came into
existence. They were invisible. The earth looked like "floating
oil" and "drifted like a jellyfish." Something like young reeds
sprouted and from them two more invisible kami came forth. Since
they are not visible, they are not described, but they are known as the
Separate Heavenly Deities. Other deities followed, and they were all
invisible (at least to humans). They are the gods of Takamagahara,
or the "High Plains of Heaven."
The oldest of these gods was called Amanominakanushi-no
kami, or the "Lord of the Center of Heaven." Two other kami
34



Japanese Gods and Goddesses
of the High Plains of Heaven were called Takamimusubi and
Kamimusubi. These three kami, along with two lesser gods named
Umashiashikabihikoji-no-kami and Amanotokotachi-no-kami, formed
the five Separate Heavenly Deities, which were followed by seven
consecutive generations of heavenly gods and goddesses.
Izanagi and Izanami Create the World
The last two heavenly deities created were called Izanagi-no-mikoto
("The August—distinguished and grand—Male") and his sister and
wife, Izanami-no-mikoto ("The August Female"). The other heavenly
deities commanded them, "Complete and solidify the drifting land,"
and gave them the heavenly jeweled spear.
Izanagi and Izanami stood on the Heavenly Floating Bridge
(perhaps a rainbow, or the Milky Way). Reaching down, they
churned the primeval salt waters with the spear, making a churning
sound, koworo korowo ni. When they lifted the spear, the brine
dripped down and created solid land: the island of Onogoro.
Izanagi and Izanami descended from the heavens to this island
and built a pillar and a palace. They agreed to walk around the pillar,
Izanagi from the left and Izanami from the right. When they met,
Izanami spoke first. Then Izanagi spoke. But he was displeased. He
said the man should speak first. They soon had a child, but the child,
Hiruko, was a deformed creature, a "leech child," and they put it on
a boat made of reeds and floated it out to sea. (An ancient Japanese
ritual reflects this myth when after the birth of a couple's first child,
they place a clay figurine in a small reed boat and cast it out to sea.)
35.



JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
36



Japanese Gods and Goddesses
Izanagi and Izanami agreed to talk to the
heavenly deities about what had gone wrong,
and the deities performed a divination, heating
the shoulder blade of a deer and examining the
cracks that formed. The gods told them that
the man should have spoken first. The birth
of the demon child was the result of his mother
having spoken out of turn during the ritual of
courtship, a myth that some people today
believe contributes to—or reflects—the
inequalities between men and women in
modern Japan.
After, Izanagi and Izanami went back to
the island and performed the rite again, only
this time Izanagi spoke first. Then Izanami
gave birth to the eight islands of Japan. After
that were born the kami that would inhabit
and rule the islands. These included the gods
of wind, the seas, the rivers, the trees, the
mountains, the plains, the seasons, and
many others.
This "wedded rock" shrine represents the marriage of Izanagi and Izanami. The rope must be replaced several times each year.

JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
The thunder god (right) and wind god (left), both weather deities, together create a big noisy wind storm.
The Death of Izanami
As Izanami gave birth to the kami of fire, Kagu-tsuchi, she was burned
and became ill. In her death throes, she vomited up the gods of
metal and mines. She urinated the gods of water and the green plants
that grow in water. She excreted, and in her excrement were the gods
of clay or earth. Afterward, she died and Izanagi buried her.
Izanagi wept and raged in his grief. "I have given away my
beloved spouse in exchange for a mere child," he said. His tears
became the kami whose name means "Weeping Marsh Woman." In
his rage he took his sword and cut off the head of Kagu-tsuchi.
From the fire god's blood and from all his body parts came other
gods, known as the kami "born of sword." They are gods connected
with fire and rocks, the gods of the volcano and of earthquakes.
38



Japanese Gods and Goddesses
Izanagi went to the land of the darkness, Yomi-tsu-kuni, the
underworld, to seek his wife. When he found her, at the dark
entrance of the underworld and shrouded in shadows, he said, "Oh,
my beloved spouse, we have not finished making the lands. You must
come back!" She backed away and warned Izanagi not to look at her.
It was too late. Izanami had already "eaten at the hearth,"
meaning she had eaten the food of the underworld. She said, however,
that she would ask the gods of Yomi if she could return to earth
and said again that Izanagi must not look upon her. But while she
was away, he grew impatient and curious. A long time passed. He
wanted so strongly to see his wife again that he broke off a tooth
from the comb in his hair and used it as a torch. He went into the
room where Izanami had gone and saw at once that she was a rotted
corpse full of squirming maggots.
Izanagi was afraid and fled, but Izanami was angry at his having
shamed her. She sent after him the hags of Yomi. Izanagi threw down
the vine that held his hair and it bore grapes, which the hags
stopped and ate. When they pursued him again, he pulled out the
comb from his hair and threw it down. This time it bore bamboo
shoots. Again the hags stopped and ate. Izanagi fled again, waving
his sword behind him. He threw three peaches at his pursuers
(which by now included the hags, the warriors of Yomi, and eight
thunder deities that had formed in Izanami's body) and asked them
to save him, which they did.
Izanami herself chased after him then, but he escaped and moved
a huge rock to block the pass between them. They broke their
wedding vows, divorcing. Izanami swore that she would kill 1,000
39



JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
people a day, and Izanagi swore that he would cause 1,500 births
each day, accounting for human mortality and for population increase.
Izanami became kami of the world of death. It is not a place of
punishment or judgment in Shinto myth, but a place of darkness,
decay, and pollution (in the sense of ritual uncleanliness).
The Birth of the Sun and Moon
Izanagi said, "I have been to a most horrid, unclean land. I must
purify myself." (Traditionally, the Japanese still take a ritual bath
after a period of mourning.) At the mouth of a stream in Hyuga
(northeast Kyushu), Izanagi took off his clothing, out of which
were born many kamis, and he bathed. From his bathing, other
deities were born. The last three were the most important. When
he bathed his left eye, Amaterasu-no-mikoto, the sun was born,
literally "August [important] Person Who Makes the Heavens
Shine." When he bathed his right eye, Tsuki-yomi-no-mikoto ("the
August Moon") was born. And when he washed his nose, Susano
no-mikoto ("the August Raging Male") was born.
Izanagi rejoiced at these three noble children and he gave his
power to them. He decided to divide the earth and give each god a
portion of it. To Amaterasu, he gave a jangling necklace and said,
"You shall rule the High Plains of Heaven."
To Tsuki, he said, "You shall rule realm of the night."
To Susano, he said, "You shall rule the ocean," although
Susano is also the kami of storms, which come from the ocean.
40



Japanese Gods and Goddesses
In the Japanese creation myth, the sun goddess, Amaterasu, is lured from the cave where she has hidden herself by the sounds of a noisy dance.
41



JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
Obediently, Amaterasu and Tsuki went to rule the realms that
had been given to them, but Susano wept and howled, until mountain
vegetation died and the rivers and seas dried up. (He seems to have
been using up the world's water, not adding to it, as a storm would
later.) His father asked him, "Why do you weep and howl instead
of ruling the land entrusted to you?" "I wish to go to the land of
my mother," Susano answered.
Angry, Inazagi banished Susano, saying, "You may not live in
this land." This last myth has two endings. In one, Susano ascended
to heaven where he remains in the Younger Palace of the Sun. In
the other version of this myth, Susano is enshrined at Taga (in Shiga
Prefecture, Honshu).
Susano Challenges His Sister
Susano said that if he was banished, he first wanted to visit his
sister, Amaterasu. When he went up there, the mountains and
rivers roared. The land shook. Hearing this, the sun goddess
believed her brother was coming to take her lands, and she pre
pared herself for battle. She tied her long hair in bunches and put
on two quivers of arrows, one containing 1,000 arrows and another
containing 500 arrows. She put on the arm guard that protects the
arm from the string of the bow, and she stomped on the earth,
sinking to her thighs, kicking the earth as if it were light snow.
"Why have you come?" she asked her brother.
Susano said that he had no ill intentions, but Amaterasu wasn't
certain if she should believe him. They agreed to a contest that
42



involved each of them bearing
children.
Amaterasu asked for Susano's
sword. She broke it in three pieces,
washed it, and then chewed the pieces
and spat out three goddesses. Susano
asked for the string of many beads
that Amaterasu wore in her hair,
chewed them up, and spat out a male
god. He did the same with the vines
in her hair and the beads on her arms.
Who won? They couldn't agree.
Susano had produced the male
children, but since he had used things
belonging to Amaterasu, she claimed
they were hers. He, however, argued
that the contest was to prove him pure
of heart. His having helped produce
the first three "graceful maidens"
proved this.
Susano then had a kind of victory
rage. He broke down the ridges
between his sister's rice paddies and
covered up the irrigation ditches. He
defecated and scattered his feces
in the hall where the first fruits
were tasted.
Japanese Gods and Goddesses
Susano generally causes trouble in the myths, but he does kill an eight headed dragon (mostly hidden in the raging waters m this scroll painting) and rescue the princess Kushinada
43



JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
Amaterasu did not scold him, perhaps hoping to calm him, but
it didn't help. Susano then took a heavenly pony (probably a
piebald, dappled one, which in many cultures is thought to resemble
the stars), skinned it backward, and then heaved it through the roof
of the heavenly weaving hall where his sister was working. A weaving
maiden was so startled that she injured herself and died.
The Sun Conceals Herself
Amaterasu was afraid, and she hid herself in a cave or house of
rocks, the Heavenly Rock Cave, or Ama-no-iwato. The High Plain
of the Heavenly Deities and the Central Land of the Reed Plains
the world of human beings—were in darkness. There was only
night. The voices of the kami rose in alarm and terrible things
happened.
Omopi-kane-no-kami thought about the problem. (Omopo
literally means "to ponder," and this kami is always the one
called upon to come up with ideas for the heavenly kamis. His
whole name suggests that he is "thought-combining-kami," able
to hold many thoughts, or to think with many kamis.) Eventually
the kami constructed a large mirror and suspended it from the
branches of a sacred tree taken from the mountains. They hung
white and blue cloth in the tree. At the top of the tree was a
perch (whose shape became the shape of a Shinto shrine) with a
rooster on it. One kami held up the tree while another spoke
solemn words of magic. Then a beautiful kami, Ama-no-uzume,
44



Japanese Gods and Goddesses
stood on an upside-down bucket and danced, exposing her body,
until all the eighty myriad kami laughed. (She wasn't performing
a nightclub act, but rather the dance of a female shaman, a woman
of magic power.)
Amaterasu cracked open the door and said, "I thought that the
lands would be dark. Why is Ama-no-uzume singing and dancing
and all of you laughing?"
Ama-no-uzume said they were laughing because there was a
kami superior even to Amaterasu. Two gods held the mirror facing
the door of the cave where Amaterasu was hiding. As she emerged
and approached the mirror, it was as if a ray of dawn had broken. A
god who had concealed himself, a god of great strength, pulled her
out; another god extended a magic rope behind her, saying "You
may go back no further than this!"
And so, with the sun's reappearance, the light came back into
the world, as the sun comes out after darkness, after the storm of
her storm brother's actions. Amaterasu had restored sunlight to
the world.
The eighty myriad kami punished Susano severely, making him
pay a fine of a thousand tables of ritual offerings. They also cut off
his long beard and his fingernails and toenails, and forced him from
heaven, sending him back to earth. When he returned, he got into
more trouble, although eventually he killed an eight-headed dragon
by getting it so drunk on rice wine (sake) that he could chop it up.
While hacking up its tail, he discovered in it a sword that appears
in many other Japanese myths.
45



JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
Replicas of that sword, the mirror that was used to entice
Amaterasu from hiding, and the beads that Amaterasu wore in her
hair, from which Susano created children, are given to each new
Japanese emperor when he is enthroned. They are the three insignia
of kingship that tie the emperor to the gods, and especially to
Amaterasu, from whom the emperor is descended.
Other Shinto Gods
The Shinto religion includes other gods not mentioned in the previous
myths. Okuninushi, "the Great Lord of the Country," had eighty
brothers, and all of them, including Okuninushi, wanted to marry
the princess Ya-gami-hime. On their way to court the princess, the
brothers saw a rabbit with no fur weeping from pain at the side of
the road. The brothers told the rabbit that he must bathe in salt
water and dry himself in the wind on a mountain. This, of course,
hurt the rabbit even more. Okuninushi told the rabbit to bathe in the
sweet water at the mouth of the river and to roll in a particular kind
of pollen. The rabbit, a god in disguise, was cured and promised
Okuninushi that he would wed the princess.
There are many stories about Okuninushi, some of which pit
him against Susano, whom he finally overcomes. While Susano is
asleep, Okuninushi ties his long hair to the rafters of the palace.
Ogetsu-no-hime is a goddess of food. In different versions of
the myth, either Tsukiyomi (the moon god) or Susano is given food
by Inari. The food comes from her whole body—it comes out her
46



Japanese Gods and Goddesses
mouth, her nose, even her rectum. Offended, the other god kills her.
From her dead body come silkworms, rice, millet, red beans, wheat,
and soybeans—essential products in traditional Japanese life.
When this myth is told of the moon god (as it is in theNihonON
Shoki, the "Chronicles of Japan," written shortly after the Kojiki),
it can account for why the moon was banished to the dark sky:
after his act of destruction, the sun says she never wants to see
him again.
Other gods include Inari, the rice god who ensures a bountiful
rice harvest and is also considered the god of prosperity. Ebisu is
the kami who is the god of work. The Japanese even have a deity
to oversee kitchen appliances! Kamado-no-kami is the god of
kitchen ranges. Truly, the Japanese world is full of kami.
Shinto Demons
Shinto, like many other world religions, has its equivalent of hell,
partly acquired from Buddhism. This dark realm is called Jigoku,
and it consists of eight regions of fire and eight regions of ice. The
ruler of Jigoku is known as Emma-ho. He is the one responsible for
judging the souls of male sinners, condemning them to one of the
sixteen regions for punishment. His sister judges female sinners.
As a ritual of punishment, each sinner stands before a mirror where
his or her sins are reflected back at him or her. But the souls of
sinners can also be saved. This salvation requires intervention by a
bosatsu or by bodhisattva kami.
47



JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
Emma-ho, ruler of the Shinto equivalent of hell, can assign dead sinners to eight regions of fire and eight of ice.
48



Japanese Gods and Goddesses
Demons that inhabit both Jigoku and Earth are known as oni.
These demons cause events such as tragic storms, fires, epidemics
of disease, famine, and other catastrophes involving large losses of
life. Some oni can even take on a human or animal form, though
most are invisible.
49



MYTHOLOGY IN MODERN JAPAN
he myths in this book are ancient, and neither Shinto nor
Buddhism were or are primarily religions based on the retelling
of myths. Most reference books about modern Japan claim that
religion is not a very important part of the lives of
the Japanese. Yet Akihito, who became
emperor in 1989, traces his family
back more than 2,600 years to the
emperor Jimmu, and thus to the
sun goddess. In October 2005,
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi
of Japan angered other Asian
nations by visiting Yasukuni
Shrine in Tokyo at which the
Japanese who died in wars
are "memorialized and
worshipped as deities"
including soldiers
who were executed as

rituals. The Japanese appreciation of nature, their emphasis on
cleanliness and on purification, and the discipline they bring to play
and work are all related to Shinto and Buddhist traditions.
54



JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
52



Mythology in Modern Japan
There is a popular saying in Japan: 80
percent of the people of Japan say they are
Buddhist, 80 percent say they are Shinto, and
80 percent say they believe in no religion at
all. The Japanese blend of Buddhism and
Shinto is less about belief than it is about
acting in certain ways—meditating, visiting
Buddhist temples and Shinto jinta, or shrines.
(Most houses contain both types.) Most wed
dings are Shinto. Most funerals are Buddhist.
Both traditions emphasize ritual purifica
tion: you wash out your mouth and wash your
hands before visiting a shrine. And a lot of
shrine visiting and ritual blessings go on.
When the ground is broken for a new building,
there is a ceremony to pacify the kami who
dwell there and to purify the place. New air
planes are purified before their first flight
and so are new cars on a factory assembly line.
Toyota executives travel three hours from
their headquarters to unveil their newest cars
at the shrine of the sun goddess, Amaterasu.
In a modern Shinto-style wedding, the bride and groom pass a ceremonial cup of sake (rice wine) back and forth three times, taking a sip each time.
53



JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
On the first business day of the year, these businessmen are at the Shinto shrine of commerce and industry, where the priest performs a ritual blessing.
The myths aren't as important as they once were, but Japanese
tradition goes on—with some typically Japanese modifications. A
shrine visit still includes washing, ringing a bell (to summon the
kami), bowing twice, and clapping the hands two times before giving
an offering. Few Japanese communities are without their own
Shinto shrine; they number more than 80,000 throughout the country.
You can still get your fortune on a piece of paper at a shrine. If it's
good, you keep it, and if it's bad, you leave it tied near the shrine,
where the kami will make it go away. The modern difference is that
now you can buy your fortune from a vending machine.

About the Author
Judith Levin studied folklore in a Ph.D. program at the University of Pennsylvania,
where she learned about mythology as well as other aspects of folklore and
cross-cultural studies. She is the author of many books for children and young
adults, including a biography of Ichiro Suzuki, who is the first Japanese position
player (a player other than a pitcher) to come to U.S. major league baseball.
