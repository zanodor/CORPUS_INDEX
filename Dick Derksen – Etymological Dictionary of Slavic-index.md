PREFACE
The work on the etymological database on which this dictionary is based began in the autumn of 1998 and continued until the spring of 2002, when I started compiling a Baltic etymological database. The project was nanced by the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO), whose support I gratefully acknowledge. Since July 2005 I have been employed part-time as an editor of the Indo-European Etymological Dictionary project, which position is nanced by Leiden University and Brill. In this period I completed the Slavic etymological database as much as possible and transformed it into a book. It is my convinction that historical linguistics is all about details. Most of the entries that make up this dictionary fail to meet the standard that I consider desirable for etymological investigations. That said, I admit that the project of a single-volume Slavic dictionary to be written by one author called for a di erent approach. This book is as much a tool for further research as it is a collection of etymological case-studies. I hope that I shall be able to tie up some loose ends in my Baltic etymological dictionary. For at least ten years the collaborators of the IEED have exchanged views at Tuesday morning sessions. It seems appropriate to thank all colleagues who took part in these sessions at one time or another and may have made a contribution to the present dictionary. They are, in alphabetical order: Lucien van Beek, Robert Beekes, Dirk Boutkan†, Johnny Cheung, Michiel Driessen, Alwin Kloekhorst, Guus Kroonen, Alexander Lubotsky, Hrach Martirosyan, Michaël Peyrot, Tijmen Pronk, Peter Schrijver, Michiel de Vaan, and Caroline aan de Wiel. I owe special thanks to Alexander Lubotsky for his willingness to be the sole proofreader of the manuscript. Jan Bi ovský provided useful comments on the Czech material. For technical support I would like to thank Thomas Olander, who supplied a font that even includes Slovincian, and Maarten Hijzelendoorn, who wrote a macro for generating the indices. Furthermore, I would like to express my gratitude to Willem Vermeer, who was always prepared to share his vast knowledge of Slavic accentology, and my promotor Frederik Kortlandt, whose work in the eld of Slavic provided the foundation for this dictionary. To my regret, our Ukrainian colleague Anatolij Nepokupnyj, linguist and poet, who always showed a keen interest in the Balto-Slavic component of the IEED, is no longer with us to witness the publication of this dictionary. I fondly recall our conversations in Vilnius and Paris.

INTRODUCTION
1. ORIGIN OF THE DICTIONARY
The dictionary is based on a database that was created within the context of the Indo-European Etymological Dictionary project (IED). The circumstance that the dictionary originates from a database is still apparent from the way the lemmata are structured. This type of rigid structure is at times a burden for the author, but it also increases the value of the dictionary as a book of reference. The main objective of the dictionary is to present an up-to-date etymological account of the Slavic inherited lexical stock. Since there is no consensus on neither the reconstruction of the Indo-European proto-language nor on the reconstruction of Proto-Slavic, the etymological dictionary is bound to represent my personal views, which obviously re ect my academic background (see section 2). Few will deny, however, that especially from the Indo-Europeanist’s point of view the dictionary is more up-to-date than, for instance, the timologi eskij slovar’ slavjanskix jazykov (ESSJa) or Pokorny’s treatment of the Slavic material in his Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch (IEW).
As to the scope of the dictionary, it must be said that it has not been easy to de ne the set of etyma that were to be discussed. It was completely out of the question that I should be able to cover as many lemmata as the ESSJa, which at the moment contains about 20,000 entries (many of them marginally attested and of unknown origin), neither would it have been desirable for a dictionary concentrating on the inherited lexical stock. It was therefore decided to focus on etyma that have been part of the scholarly discussion in the eld of Indo-European linguistics, e.g. etyma that occur in Pokorny’s dictionary or LIV. Obviously, this selection includes a number of etyma that may be considered borrowings from a non-Indo-European substratum language (see 2.2). Excluding such etyma would not be very wise, as the classi cation of a word as, for instance, “North Indo-European” is merely provisional. Furthermore, even the possibly non-Indo-European elements of the Proto-Slavic lexicon usually meet the IED’s criterion that an etymon must be attested in at least two branches of Indo-European in order to be included. An important di erence between the present dictionary and etymological dictionaries such as the ESSJa or the S ownik pras owia ski (S awski SP) is the fact that an attempt is made to reconstruct the prosodic characteristics of the ProtoSlavic etyma. I regard this as a justi able goal in itself, but Kortlandt’s theory about the origins of the Balto-Slavic acute and circum ex intonations (see 2.2.3.3), to which I subscribe, adds signi cantly increases the importance of Baltic and Slavic accentology for the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European. The accentuation of an etymon may reveal the former presence of a laryngeal or be decisive in cases where it is unclear whether or an aspirated or an unaspirated voiced stop must be reconstructed.



INTRODUCTION
2
At an earlier stage of the project I planned to present the reconstruction of the accent paradigms more or less as given facts. Then I decided to provide more information on the accentuation of the forms attested in the individual languages, for instance by adding information on the accentuation in Old Russian or presenting a number of case-forms. While this dictionary does not aim at completeness, I have strived for an accurate representation of reliable data. Since the database hopefully remains available on-line, the set of data may be expanded. Unlike many other etymological dictionaries, the present dictionary does not abound in references. The Etymologický slovník jazyka staroslovenského (ESJS), for example, painstakingly lists the most prominent etymologies, which are subsequently evaluated. Though I highly value this approach, I felt that my dictionary had to be set up in a di erent manner because otherwise too much time would be taken up by reproducing and scrutinizing the scholarly literature. I realize that by limiting the number of references I am at risk of ignoring valuable contributions to Slavic etymology. This I regret, but I think that it is a concession I had to make.
2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
2.1 General considerations and Proto-Indo-European
Not surprisingly, the ideas about the structure of the Indo-European proto-language underlying this book conform with the theories propagated by Leiden based IndoEuropeanists such as Beekes, Kortlandt, and Lubotsky. The best introduction to this theoretical framework is Beekes 1995, which is the English edition of Beekes 1990. The existence of this introductory work largely relieves me of the obligation to present an outline of the theories on which my Proto-Indo-European reconstructions are based. Thus, I shall con ne myself to representing some of the main aspects. It is a well-known fact that Leiden Indo-Europeanists tend to deny that there was a Proto-Indo-European phoneme *a (see especially Lubotsky 1989). Nevertheless, it is quite possible that a Proto-Slavic etymon derives from a form containing *a. The Proto-Slavic lexical stock contains numerous elements that do not have an IndoEuropean origin. These may have been borrowed from a substratum language, possibly at an early stage. The *a that these words may contain is sometimes called “European *a” because the substratum language was located on European soil. I subscribe to the hypothesis that Proto-Indo-European did not have an opposition between palatalized and plain velars (cf. Meillet 1894, Steensland 1973). The latter arose from depalatalization in certain constellations, in particular aဦer *s (though not before *i) and aဦer *u, where the opposition between the palatovelar and labiovelar series was neutralized. Depalatalization before resonants unless followed by a front vowel occurred in Balto-Slavic and Albanian (cf. Kortlandt 1978a: 240-242). The latter development is to a considerable extent responsible for the variation between velar stops and sibilants that we observe in both Baltic and Slavic.



INTRODUCTION 3
The traditional Proto-Indo-European system of voiceless, voiced, and aspirated voiced stops has repeatedly been challenged on typological grounds. As an alternative, it was proposed that the unaspirated voiced stops were actually glottalic (e.g. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984: 5-84). The glottalic hypothesis was applied to great e ect by Kortlandt, who employed it to tackle a diversity of issues in various branches of Indo-European (cf. Kortlandt 1985a). Crucial to the present publication is Kortlandt’s interpretation of the Balto-Slavic development known as Winter’s law as the merger of the glottalic element of the traditional mediae with the re ex of the Proto-Indo-European laryngeals (see 2.2.2.3). In Proto-Indo-European, the lengthened grade vowels * and * occurred in a limited number of categories, which can ultimately be reduced to monosyllables and forms ending in a resonant (cf. Beekes 1990: 204, 1995: 167, Kortlandt 1986: 154-155). Contrarily to what is generally assumed, lengthened grade vowels are regularly circum ex in Balto-Slavic. Forms presented as counter-examples contain either a laryngeal or can be regarded as examples of Winter’s law. Another source of circum ex long vowels is contraction. A special case is the constellation * H (* H ), where according to Kortlandt the laryngeal was lost (Kortlandt 1985b: 115, 118-120). As can be gathered from the preceding paragraphs, I adhere to the view that there once existed a Balto-Slavic linguistic unity. It can be demonstrated that Baltic and Slavic underwent a sequence of common developments, a number of which relate to the place of the stress. In view of its complexity as well as the important role it plays in this dictionary, Balto-Slavic accentology will be the subject of a separate section.
2.2 Balto-Slavic accentology
2.2.1 Introduction
As stated above, Kortlandt’s theory about the origins of the Balto-Slavic acute and circum ex intonations signi cantly increases the relevance of Balto-Slavic accentology for etymological studies. This is re ected in numerous publications by Indo-Europeanists from Leiden, for instance in several monographs that appeared in the Leiden Studies in Indo-European series. A good example is Schrijver 1991, where a conscious e ort is made to take the Balto-Slavic accentual evidence into account.1 My own book in the series, Derksen 1996, is a slightly di erent matter, as it deals with an accentological subject, the problem of metatony in Baltic. It contains a brief survey of Balto-Slavic accentology, which partly coincides with Derksen 1991. I shall here repeat some of the points I tried to make in these two publications, while shiဦing the emphasis onto Slavic phenomena.
2.2.2 Balto-Slavic developments
Over the years Frederik Kortlandt has devised a detailed relative chronology of developments ranging from Proto-Indo-European to disintegrating Slavic. It was
1 We may draw a comparison with the thematically similar dissertation Beekes 1969, where BaltoSlavic accentology still does not play any role of signi cance.

rst published in a Serbo-Croation translation in 1989. The English version, which was marred by many misprints, appeared in 1994, to be followed by a corrected version on the World Wide Web (2002). Articles reproducing and discussing large parts of the relative chronology are Kortlandt 2005 and 2007. Kortlandt’s chronology might be called the backbone of my investigations in the eld of Balto-Slavic historical linguistics, which is not to say that it will be treated as if it were carved in stone. The Balto-Slavic section of Kortlandt’s relative chronology contains a number of developments that concern accentology. These are conveniently listed in Kortlandt 2006a (349):
“1. Loss of PIE accentual mobility, of which there is no trace outside the nominal exion of the consonant stems, e.g. Lith. duktᔂ ‘daughter’, piemuõ ‘shepherd’, and the exion of the athematic verbs, e.g. duodãᐱs ‘giving’ (cf. Kortlandt 1985b on the latter). 2. Pedersen’s law: the stress was retracted from medial syllables in mobile accent paradigms, e.g. acc.sg. dùkter , píemen , Greek thugatéra, poiména. 3. Barytonesis: the retraction of the stress spread analogically to vocalic stems in the case forms where Pedersen’s law applied, e.g. acc.sg. ãv ‘sheep’, sᔆn ‘son’, diᑱv ‘god’, žiᑱm ‘winter’. 4. Oxytonesis: the stress is shiဦed from a medial syllable to the end of the word in paradigms with end-stressed forms, e.g. inst.sg. s numì, inst.pl. žiemomìs. 5. Hirt’s law: the stress was retracted if the vowel of the pretonic syllable was immediately followed by a laryngeal, e.g. dúona ‘bread’, výras ‘man’, dᔆmai ‘smoke’, Vedic dh nᔄs, v rás, dh más.
6. Winter’s law: the PIE glottalic stops dissolved into a laryngeal and a buccal part. The former merged with the re ex of the PIE laryngeals and the latter with the reex of the lenes stops, e.g. Latvian pêᐰds ‘footstep’ < *pedóm, nuôgs ‘naked’ < *nogᐁós, duômu ‘I give’ < *dodH mí.
7. Retraction of the stress from nal open syllables of disyllabic word forms unless the preceding syllable was closed by an obstruent, e.g. Lith. gen.sg. viᒘko ‘wolf ’, dat.sg. viᒘkui, gálvai ‘head’, nᑱša ‘carries’, Serbo-Croatian vᎉka, vᎉku, gl፹vi, nᎀse ‘carried’, neuter pᎃlo ‘drank’, but Lith. gen.sg. aviᑱs, gen.pl. vilk ጀ < *-òm, nom.sg. galvà < *-àH, Russian pilá ‘she drank’ < *-àH, neuter nesló, in nitive nestí, where syllable- nal consonants (including word- nal laryngeals) prevented the retraction of the stress.”
2.2.2.1 The rise of the mobile paradigm
The developments 1-4 and 7 are intended to account for the accentual curve of the Balto-Slavic mobile paradigm. Here a few words on the historical background of the problem are in order. According to de Saussure (1896), the Lithuanian opposition between barytona and mobilia continues an Indo-European opposition between barytona and oxytona. As the identity of the Lithuanian and Proto-Slavic mobile paradigms is beyond doubt, this implies that the Balto-Slavic mobile paradigm arose from an oxytone paradigm. De Saussure’s explanation for the origin of the Lithuanian mobile paradigm started from consonant stems of which the number of



INTRODUCTION 5
syllables did not remain constant within the paradigm. In Kortlandt’s chronology it appears under the name Pedersen’s law in view of Pedersen’s e ort (1933: 25) to reformulate the law proposed by de Saussure. The prehistory of the Balto-Slavic accentual system has been the subject of much debate (see especially Olander 2006 for an overview). Kortlandt’s development (1) places him at the same starting-point as de Saussure: the early Balto-Slavic system mainly had an opposition between barytona and oxytona. The few traces of original accentual mobility that survived only played a modest role. The question is if it is possible to strengthen the link between the Balto-Slavic accentual mobile paradigm and Proto-Indo-European accentual mobility. We may note that Illi -Svity , when he set out to provide comparative proof for de Saussure’s hypothesis on the IndoEuropean background of the Balto-Slavic barytone and mobile paradigms (1963, English translation 1979), tried to gain a better understanding of Pedersen’s law by suggesting a link with the survival of mobile root nouns. With respect to the IndoEuropean situation he preferred the term “mobile-oxytone” to “oxytone”. It so happens that Kortlandt himself (2006b) has recently modi ed his account of the rise of the Balto-Slavic mobile paradigm. Instead of assuming an early loss of Proto-Indo-European accentual mobility, he now starts from the Late Indo-European hysterodynamic and proterodynamic paradigms. The rst step is the replacement of the isolated root stress of the Nsg. of the hysterodynamic paradigm by nal stress. The sigmatic Nsg. of the proterodynamic paradigm then underwent the same development, creating a clear accentual opposition between end-stressed masculines and feminines on the one hand and root-stressed neuters on the other. The medially stressed case-forms, viz. the Asg., Lsg., Apl., and Npl. forms of the hysterodynamic paradigm and the Dsg. and Npl. forms of the proterodynamic paradigm, subsequently retracted the stress to the initial syllable. Kortlandt’s objective here is to reformulate Pedersen’s law as a phonetic development. Furthermore, the scope of the barytonesis has been limited:
“The barytonesis did not a ect acc.sg. ãv ‘sheep’, sᔆn ‘son’, which had preserved Indo-European radical stress, nor žiᑱm ‘winter’, which was built on the original nom.sg. form *ᘷheim (cf. Beekes 1985: 44), but did yield the retraction in diᑱv ‘god’, cf. Vedic devám, because the o-stems had xed stress from the outset.” (Kortlandt 2006b: 3)
Finally, the existence of oxytonesis as a Balto-Slavic development is put into doubt. The accentuation of Lith. s numì Isg. and žiemomìs Ipl. may be old because it replaces the end-stressed instrumental in *-b᎙i. On the whole, the new scenario links the Balto-Slavic state of a airs more closely to Late Indo-European nominal accentuation. The retraction listed as number 7 was rst formulated by Kortlandt in 1975 (5-7). Since it was inspired on a retraction formulated by Ebeling, it was baptized Ebeling’s law, but in recent publications by Kortlandt this designation tends to be avoided. An interesting consequence of the condition that the stress was not retracted to syllables ending in an obstruent is the rise of a class of oxytone neuters. In Slavic, these

oxytona ended up in AP (b). If the root contained the re ex of a laryngeal or the laryngeal part of a PIE glottalic stop, it was lost in pretonic position. In Baltic, the oxytone neuters became barytone when the stress was retracted from nal *-à, yielding metatony (Derksen 1996: 96-128, 229-232, see also 2004: 87-89). Words belonging to this class were occasionally misinterpreted by Illi -Svity (1963). The e ects of Ebeling’s law may also be observed in masculine o-stems (Derksen forthc. a).
2.2.2.2 Hirt’s law2
Hirt’s law, which is listed above as development 5, was proposed in order to account for the large number of correspondences between Baltic and Slavic barytona and nouns which considering the Sanskrit, Greek and Germanic evidence had mobile/oxytone accentuation in PIE. In Hirt’s original formulation (1895) the stress was retracted to long root syllables. Since then the law has been reformulated a remarkable number of times, among others by Hirt himself (1899). An important observation was made by Bonfante (1935, 1937), who showed that the stress was only retracted to non-apophonic long vowels, i.e. to sequences of a short vowel and a laryngeal. Aဦer a thorough investigation of the “Hirt-Bonfante hypothesis”, Illi -Svity (1963: 80 = 1979: 63) concluded that the retraction was indeed limited to nonapophonic long syllabic elements, i.e. to non-apophonic long vowels, long resonants and long diphthongs. He contrasts syllables containing “new length” from laryngeal loss aဦer a syllabic element with syllables containing apophonic length or an original sequence of a short vowel followed by a resonant and a vocalized laryngeal, e.g. *ten፦uᐵós < *tenHuᐵós, cf. Gk. ‘outstretched, tall’, Latv.tiêvs ‘thin’. This invites the conclusion that at the time of the retraction the laryngeals were still present, as has indeed been argued by some scholars (cf. Kortlandt 1975a: 2, Rasmussen 1985: passim). In that case one might simply say that the stress was retracted to an immediately preceding syllable containing a vocalic element followed by a laryngeal. That the position of the laryngeal plays an essential role was demonstrated by Kortlandt in connection with the accentuation of the Slavic l-participle (1975: 2-4). He suggested that in instances such as Ru. pilá f.sg. ‘drank’ the laryngeal must originally have preceded the i of the root. His reconstruction *pHiláH is supported by full grades of the type *pe/oh3i- or *pe/oh3- e.g. Skt. p yáyati. The opposition between *-HI- and *-IH- has a parallel in Greek and Italo-Celtic, where we nd indications that pretonic *-HI- yielded a short re ex (Schrijver 1991: 512-536). It may be clear that Hirt’s law is a strong argument for a Balto-Slavic linguistic unity.
2.2.2.3 Winter’s law
Winter’s law, which in its original formulation is vowel lengthening before PIE unaspirated voiced stops (Winter 1978), is without doubt a sound law of major

INTRODUCTION 7
importance. So far, however, it has not received the recognition it deserves. The main reason for this is probably the fact that a number of appealing examples seem to violate the law. Since a survey of the evidence clearly indicates that the law is essentially correct (cf. Young 1990, Rasmussen 1992, and especially Dybo 2002), the next logical step is to look for special circumstances which might provide an explanation for the apparent exceptions. For ‘water’ (cf. OCS voda vs. Lith. vanduõ 3a) and ‘ re’ (cf. Lith. ugnìs, OCS ogn’ቲ), Kortlandt has proposed that the law did not a ect the clusters ndn and ngn (1979: 61, 1988: 388-389). The nasal in x which may be reconstructed for Balto-Slavic must have developed from a nasal su x in PIE times already (cf. Thurneysen 1883). Another major exception is Slavic *xodጀ ‘going, course’. Here the absence of Winter’s law may originate from a reduplicated present stem *sizd-, where the law was blocked by an intervening z (Kortlandt 1988: 394). This is not the place to discuss the various attempts to modify the formulation of Winter’s law, for which I refer to Derksen 2003a, 2004, and forthc. b. I would like to elaborate, however, on Kortlandt’s interpretation of Winter’s law and its relationship to the Balto-Slavic prosodic system. According to the traditional doctrine, the BaltoSlavic acute intonation, which is usually reconstructed as a rising tone, re ects length, i.e. original length or length resulting from the loss of a laryngeal. If Winter’s law is interpreted as vowel lengthening, the fact that the law yields acute long vowels and diphthong is only to be expected. The regular re ex of a lengthened grade, however, is circum ex in Balto-Slavic, as Kortlandt has argued on several occasions (e.g. 1985b, 1997a). The main reason why this is not generally recognized is the ease with which some Indo-Europeanists postulate lengthened grades, thereby obscuring the original situation. Since both the presence of a laryngeal and Winter’s law generate acute syllables, one may try to link this observation to the hypothesis that the PIE voiced unaspirated stops were actually (pre)glottalized (Kortlandt 1978b). In Kortlandt’s interpretation, Winter’s law is the merger of the laryngeal element of the glottalic stop with the re ex of the Indo-European laryngeals, which had become a glottal stop in Balto-Slavic. An advantage of Kortlandt’s interpretation of Winter’s law is the possibility to regard the Latvian and Žemaitian broken tones as direct continuations of a BaltoSlavic glottal element (Derksen 1995, Kortlandt 1998). This does not imply that already in Balto-Slavic glottalization existed as a vocalic feature. There are no indications that the Balto-Slavic glottal stop lost the status of a segmental phoneme which it must still have had when Hirt’s law operated (see 2.2.2.2). The Balto-Slavic distinction between acute and circum ex syllables, which was clearly independent of the place of the (free and mobile) ictus, was originally the distinction between the presence and absence of a glottal stop. It most certainly was not a tonal distinction originating from PIE (cf. Kortlandt 1985b, Nassivera 2000). The rise of tonal distinctions must probably be dated to the separate branches of Balto-Slavic. One of the subjects of the next section is the rise of distinctive tone in Proto-Slavic.

The starting-point of modern Slavic accentology is the publication of Stang’s Slavonic accentuation (1957).3 In this study Stang e ectively did away with a number of concepts of what is oဦen called “classical accentology”, though in particular the interbellum witnessed many unrealistic theories. Stang ends his book with a list of conclusions (1957: 179), which I shall now try to rephrase and provide with comments (cf. Derksen 1991: 53-55). Stang established three (Late) Proto-Slavic accent paradigms, each with its own prosodic characteristics:
(a) Fixed stress on the stem. If the stem is monosyllabic, the stressed syllable is “acute”, i.e. we nd a short rising tone on a historically “long” syllable, which is equivalent to saying that the nucleus of the root syllable is not constituted by monophthongal *e, *o, *ጀ, or *ቲ. A special class is formed by nouns of the socalled *vò#a type, where the root has neo-acute intonation. Stang discusses these nouns within the context of ( j) -stems belonging to AP (a), but there are good arguments to classify them as belonging to AP (b), which is what will be done in this dictionary. If the stress is on a medial syllabe, there is a greater number of possibilities regarding the prosodic qualities of the root. Since these cases are not crucial for understanding the three basic types, I shall not go into the matter here.
(b) The stress alternates between the last syllable of the stem and the rst syllable of the ending. Stem-stressed forms have a rising tone with retention of the old quantity of the syllable. This tone is called “neo-acute”. Forms with stress on the ending have a short rising tone.
(c) The stress alternates between the rst syllable of the stem and the ending. Stemstressed forms have a falling tone and lose the stress to a clitic. End–stressed forms usually have a short rising accent, but in some cases a long rising accent. The falling tone is sometimes referred to as “circum ex”. This is potentially confusing because the same designation has been used to refer to any non-acute long syllable or even to any non-acute syllable (cf. Derksen 1991: 55).
In classical accentology, an acute or a circum ex tone changed under certain conditions into a neo-circum ex and a neo-acute tone, respectively. This process, called metatony, yielded four distinctive tones (Kortlandt 1978c: 271). In Stang’s system there are three tones, which are all connected with a speci c accent paradigm. Stang now showed that the neo-acute originated from a retraction of the stress.4 He also showed that the neo-circum ex is an innovation of Slovene and the Kajkavian

dialects of Serbo-Croatian rather than a Proto-Slavic tone.5 The next question that we must address is the relationship between the Slavic and the Baltic accent paradigms.
2.2.3.2 Progressive shiဦs
Lithuanian nouns belong to one of four accent paradigms, of which (1) is barytone, while (2), (3), and (4) are mobile. Monosyllabic stems are acute in (1) and (3), while they are circum ex or short in (2) and (4).6 If the stem is polysyllabic, the situation is slightly more complicated, but that need not concern us here. The four accent paradigms can be reduced to a barytone and a mobile paradigm if one takes into account the progressive shiဦ which is commonly referred to as de Saussure’s law. Employing the method of internal reconstruction, de Saussure (1896) demonstrated that at a certain point in the history of Lithuanian accentuation the stress shiဦed from a circum ex or short syllable to an immediately following acute syllable. This development was independently discovered by Fortunatov (1897). Hence, de Saussure’s law, when applied to both Baltic and Slavic, is sometimes referred to as Fortunatov’s law. Propagated by none other than Meillet,7 de Saussure’s law came to occupy an important place in classical accentology. The law was oဦen considered a Balto-Slavic innovation, though Meillet regarded the progressive shiဦs in Baltic and Slavic as parallel developments (1900: 350-351, 1924: 145). The decline of de Saussure’s law as a Balto-Slavic development may be said to have started with Kury owicz (1931: 75 , 1952), who denied its operation in Slavic, albeit basically without addressing the facts. A much heavier blow, one might argue, was delivered by Stang (1957: 15-20), who by presenting a series of factual arguments undermined the at the time prevailing view that de Saussure’s law had also operated in Slavic. Now as we have seen, Stang reconstructed three Proto-Slavic accent paradigms, whereas the Lithuanian situation points to a system with two paradigms, one of them barytone and the other mobile. Since AP (a) corresponds to Lithuanian AP (1), while AP (c) corresponds to (3) and (4) (see the next section), the core of the problem is the relationship between AP (b) and AP (2). As shown by Stang, the neoacute tone originates from a retraction of the stress, a development now generally referred to as Stang’s law. This means that AP (b) was originally oxytone. AP (2), however, is a mobile paradigm originating from a barytone paradigm as a result of de Saussure’s law. Stang did not have an answer for this discrepancy, but he made it clear that the answer most certainly was not de Saussure’s law. A solution was proposed by Dybo and Illi -Svity , who argued that the oxytone paradigm which must have existed prior to Stang’s retraction had been generated by a progressive stress shiဦ that cannot be identi ed with de Saussure’s law (see especially Dybo 1962, Illi -Svity 1963: 157-161 = 1979: 140-144). According to Dybo’s

law, also known as Illi -Svity ’s law,8 a syllable which was neither acute nor falling lost the stress to the following syllable, causing a split of the Proto-Slavic immobile paradigm. The syllable which received the stress became falling, which provided the input for Stang’s law, the retraction of the stress from long falling vowels in nal syllables.9 The scenario proposed by Dybo and Illi -Svity allows us to derive the Baltic and Slavic accentual systems from a stage when there were only an immobile barytone and a mobile or oxytone paradigm. As later publications from the Moscow accentological school have shown (see especially Dybo 1968a), it is possible to distinguish between dominant (“strong”) and recessive (“weak”) morphemes at this stage. The place of the stress is governed by the valency of the morphemes that constitute a given form (cf. Dybo 1981: 260-262, 2000a: 10-14, Lehfeldt 2001: 67-69). Whether a morpheme is dominant or recessive cannot be predicted on the basis of its phonological structure: the distribution of morphemes over the two classes is “traditional” (Dybo 2000a: 10).10
2.2.3.3 Illi -Svity ’s law and the neuter o-stems11
In his monograph on nominal accentuation in Baltic and Slavic, Illi -Svity tried to explain why so many PIE neuter o-stems appear to have become masculine in Slavic, an observation which was rst made by Hirt. A comparison with accentual data from Baltic, Greek, Sanskrit and Germanic led Illi -Svity to conclude that PIE barytone neuter o-stems correspond with Slavic masculine o-stems belonging to the barytone class in the case of “long” roots and to the oxytone class in the case of “short” roots (in Stang’s terminology to accent paradigms a and b, respectively). As we have seen, AP (a) and (b) continue a single barytone paradigm, which allows the conclusion that PIE barytone neuter o-stems became barytone masculine o-stems in Slavic. This shiဦ of gender must be rooted in Balto-Slavic (see below). In originally masculine mobile o-stems with a non-acute root, accentual mobility has been generalized (Illi Svity 1963: 109-119 = 1979: 94-104), a development that is sometimes called Illi Svity ’s law. Thus, Slavic masculine o-stems belonging to AP (b) in principle continue old neuters. I consider it possible, however, that masculine o-stems that were oxytone in Late Balto-Slavic, i.e. aဦer Ebeling’s law, escaped the transfer to the mobile class (cf. Derksen forthc. b).
8 The designation Illi -Svity ’s law is also used to indicate the transfer of masculine o-stems belonging to AP (b) to the mobile accentual paradigm.
9 This is actually the formulation of Stang’s law as it appears in publications of Dutch accentologists. Stang himself did not limit the retraction to nal syllables. In order to account for the *vò#a type, he also assumed that the stress was retracted from semi-vowels. For Kortlandt’s solution, which is connected with a development that he baptized “Van Wijk’s law”, see Kortlandt 1975: 30-32.
10 It should not be leဦ unmentioned that in the last few decades the concepts of the Moscow accentological school have undergone signi cant modi cations, on which see Vermeer 2001. Since at present it is doubtful whether these modi cations can be regarded as improvements, a discussion of the relevant issues fall outside the scope of this dictionary. I shall con ne myself to the remark that the new scenario for the rise of AP (b) comes close to a rehabilitation of de Saussure’s law for Slavic.
11 This section derives from an (unpublished) paper that was presented at the Fachtagung of the Indogermanische Gesellschaဦ in Cracow (October 2004).



INTRODUCTION 11
Whereas the barytone neuter o-stems became masculine, PIE oxytone neuter ostems remain neuter in Slavic. According to Illi -Svity , the majority of the Slavic neuter o-stems belong to the oxytone class, Stang’s AP (b). Mobile neuter o-stems (c) contain, as a rule, a historically long root or have a ᒙo-su x. In my opinion, the distribution between AP (b) and (c) is not completely clear. We can say with a high degree of certainty, however, that originally oxytone neuters of the structure CVC&C'-ó (where C1 is an obstruent) belong to (b), in conformity with Ebeling’s law (see 2.2.2.1). Proto-Slavic neuter o-stems belonging to AP (a) originate from the retraction generally known as Hirt’s law, which generated a new class of neuter ostems with xed root stress in Balto-Slavic times already. It is remarkable that Illi -Svity , who reaches the conclusion that the Baltic and Slavic accentual paradigms were identical, does not make an attempt to connect the Slavic NAsg. -o with the Lithuanian ending -a, which now only occurs in adjectives, participles and pronouns but must have been the East Baltic NAsg. ending of neuter o-stem nouns, as is evident from Baltic borrowings in Finnic. While he follows Nieminen (1922) in deriving the East Baltic ending from pronominal *-od, Illi Svity assumes that Slavic -o continues stressed *-om, a delevopment advocated by Hirt (1893). In my opinion, it would be natural to look for a common origin. Since I do not believe that *-om ever yields Balto-Slavic *-o, the best option would be to assume that in Balto-Slavic the ending *-om was replaced by *-od in oxytone neuters. In that case one would expect Old Prussian neuter o-stems to correspond to Slavic neuter o-stems and end-stressed neuters in other Indo-European languages. The evidence seems indeed to point in that direction, e.g. (cf. Kortlandt 1983: 183). Illi -Svity ’s law implies that barytone neuter o-stems were still distinct from masculine o-stems. Though the above-mentioned bifurcation of neuter o-stems seems to be Balto-Slavic, suppletive neuter plurals may have existed both in Baltic and Slavic. The existence of suppletive neuter plurals may also explain why we nd so much vacillation between neuter and masculine o-stems belonging to (a) and (b). Illi -Svity ’s law must have preceded the rise of distinctive tone in mobile paradigms because the transfer to the mobile class was based on the identity of the barytone case forms. For the same reason, Illi -Svity ’s law must have preceded Dybo’s law. The above-mentioned developments may be illustrated with the following examples:
PSl. *t+lጀ (a) ‘back of the head, back’ (e.g. Ru. tyl, Cz. týl) < *túHlom, cf. Skt. tᔆlan. ‘tuဦ, reed, panicle’. Secondary *t+lo in Slk. tylo. PSl. *dvòrጀ (b) ‘courtyard, door’ (e.g. ak. dvõr, Cz. dv,r) < *d᎙uórom, cf. Skt. dvᔄra- n.‘door, gate, passage’. PSl. *z፱ᐣbጀ (c) ‘tooth’ (e.g. ak. zᎉb, Sln. z፱ᐑb) < *ᘷómb᎙os, cf.

2.2.3.4 The fate of the Balto-Slavic acute and circum@ex
As I explained in the section on Winter’s law, the Balto-Slavic opposition between acute and circum ex syllables is in Kortlandt’s framework equivalent with the respective presence or absence of a glottal stop. Before discussing the fate of the glottal stop in Slavic, I would like to present a concise account of the rise of the East Baltic tones (cf. Kortlandt 1977, Derksen 1995).12 The crucial point is that the broken tone is an archaism. In East Baltic, the glottal stop became a feature of the neighbouring vowel, yielding the laryngeal pitch that in Baltic linguistics is known as “broken tone”. Tonal oppositions arose when the stress was retracted from prevocalic *i and word- nal *-a. In the Aukštaitian varieties of Lithuanian, retraction onto glottalized syllables yielded a rising tone and loss of the laryngeal feature, e.g. ᔂdis ‘food, fodder’, cf. ᔁsti ‘eat’ (of animals). In originally stressed syllables, the glottalic pitch changed into a falling tone, e.g. sᔁti ‘sow’, whereas the non-glottalic pitch merged with the new rising tone, e.g. duktᔂ ‘daughter’. Retraction of the stress onto non-glottalized syllables yielded a middle tone, which later merged with the falling tone, e.g. vìlkF ‘she-wolf ’, cf. viᒘkas ‘wolf ’. In unstressed syllables, glottalization was eventually lost. In Žemaitian, the broken tone was preserved under the old ictus, e.g. ᑲᐒmᙓiᑲs (Kretinga) ‘age, century’ = ámžius. In Latvian, the retractions of the stress yielded a rising tone on both plain and glottalized vowels. The other stressed vowels became falling per oppositionem. Subsequently, glottalization was lost under the falling tone. The result was a stretched tone, which later merged with the rising tone, e.g. sᑱt ‘sow’ with the same tone as sniᑱdze ‘snow-bunting’, cf. snìegs ‘snow’. The remaining glottalized stressed vowels, which had lost their distinctive tone when the glottalic feature was lost under the falling tone, lost their glottalization as well and became falling, e.g. deᐰᐐsts ‘plant’, cf. dᑱstît ‘plant’, dêt ‘lay (eggs)’. In originally unstressed syllables, glottalization was preserved as a broken tone, e.g. gaᕗva ‘head’, Lpl. gaᕗvâs, cf. Lith. galvà, Lpl. galvosè. This scenario is in con ict with the widespread view according to which the broken tone results from retraction of the ictus. The system with a threefold tonal opposition only survives in certain Central Latvian dialect areas.
Apart from the fact that it is not always easy to tell if the tone of a given syllable is metatonical, the way in which the Balto-Slavic acute and circum ex are re ected in East Baltic is fairly straightforward.13 It is oဦen insu ciently realized that this is not
12 Since our knowledge of West Baltic is based on a limited number of Old Prussian documents, the accentual developments in this branch of Balto-Slavic cannot be determined in detail. The system reflected in the Enchiridion points to a rising acute and a falling circumflex. Furthermore, Old Prussian seems to have undergone a shiဦ of the ictus from any short vowel to the next syllable (Kortlandt 1974).
13 In this account the term “circumflex” refers to non-acute long vowels and diphthongs. In my description of the Balto-Slavic situation I, strictly speaking, used the term as a designation of every non

the case in Slavic. A common misapprehension, for instance, is the idea that the “Serbo-Croatian” short falling tone indicates that the syllable was originally acute. In reality, the situation is much more complex. If the form belongs to the neo-Štokavian variant of Serbo-Croatian, the short falling tone indicates that the syllable was already stressed before the neo-Štokavian retraction of the ictus and that it is short. The quantity may be related to the fact the syllable was originally acute, but it may also have been originally short or originate from a comparatively late shortening, for instance the shortening of long falling vowels in forms counting more than two syllables. The fact is that the history of Slavic quantity is immensely complicated. Both the vowels that on qualitative grounds are considered “historically long” and the ones considered “historically short” may be re ected as either long or short. In order to establish the origin of a morpheme in terms of acute and circum ex, one must evaluate the information o ered by the individual Slavic languages regarding stress, tone and quantity within the context of the Proto-Slavic accent paradigms, which is by no means simple (cf. Vermeer 1992, Kortlandt 2005). In the classical view, sequences of vowel plus laryngeal merged with lengthened grade vowels. Subsequently, long vowels acquired an “acute” tone movement, probably a rising tone.14 Thus, the Balto-Slavic acute is about vowel length. As one might expect, Winter’s law, insofar as the law is accepted, is interpreted as vowel lengthening. The di culties raised by the classical scenario are numerous (cf. Vermeer 125-126). In Kortlandt’s theory, sequences of vowel plus laryngeal (including the glottal stop that arose from Winter’s law) remain essentially distinct from lengthened grade vowels up to the end of the Proto-Slavic period. With the exception of certain positions where the distinction was lost (see below), the original contrast is re ected by a quantitative di erence. I shall now give an overview of the fate of the laryngeals in Slavic (cf. Kortlandt 1975: 21-37, Vermeer 1992: 127-130):
(1) The laryngeals were lost in pretonic and postpostonic syllables with compensatory lengthening of the adjacent vowel. In mobile paradigms the loss of the laryngeals gave rise to an alternation between long vowels and sequences of vowel plus laryngeal. In root syllables the long vowel was generalized. This is Kortlandt’s explanation of Meillet’s law, according to which mobilia with an acute root underwent metatony (Meillet 1902).
(2) The laryngeals were lost in the rst posttonic syllable without compensatory lengthening. In stressed syllables the glottal stop became a feature of the adjacent vowel. Since the new short vowels had the same timbre as the long vowels and the glottalized vowels and therefore did not merge with the old short vowels, the timbre distinction became phonemically relevant. In pretonic syllables, where the laryngeals had been eliminated at stage (1), quantitative oppositions were rephonemicized as
acute syllable. It may be clear, however, that there is no distinction between acute and circumflex short
vowe1l4s.Note that in the traditional view the distinction between the rising acute and falling circumflex must have existed in unstressed syllables as well.

qualitative oppositions. In other words: pretonic long vowels were shortened. At a later stage, Dybo’s law reintroduced phonemic length in pretonic syllables.
(3) Glottalized vowels lost their glottalic feature and became distinctively short rising. This development must have been posterior to Dybo’s law because the progressive shiဦ only applied to non-acute non-falling syllables.
Summarizing, we could say that originally acute syllables are re ected as short vowels in syllables which prior to Dybo’s law were stressed or immediately followed the stressed syllable. In originally pretonic or postposttonic position acute and nonacute long syllables merged. Non-acute long vowels and original diphthongs are long in AP (b), whereas in AP (c) they oဦen fell victim to the widespread shortening of falling vowels. Length was preserved in monosyllabic and disyllabic word-forms in Serbo-Croatian and in Slovene monosyllables.
2.3 Substratum borrowings
The Indo-Europeans who populated Europe must have come into contact with speakers of non-Indo-European languages, who to a certain extent were assimilated to the invading tribes. Consequently, we expect to nd traces of non-Indo-European substrata in the attested Indo-European languages. In Leiden, the study of substratum in uences received an impetus from Kuiper 1995, where mainly on formal grounds three substratum layers were distinguished (see also Beekes 1996: passim, Boutkan and Siebinga 2005: xiii-xvii). What these layers have in common, is the frequent occurrence of the vowel *a, which did not belong to the Proto-IndoEuropean phoneme inventory (see 2.1). One of the layers, labelled A3, is the language of Krahe’s hydronymy and is usually called “Old European”. It is, among other things, characterized by the vocalism *a and the high frequency of continuants and *s. Substratum A2, quali ed as “European”, only had aspirated voiced stops in antevocalic position, or rather the antevocalic stops were identi ed with the traditional mediae aspiratae. Furthermore, there seems to have been variation between labial and velar stops. The vowel *a was frequent and there probably was no distinctive vowel length. Another characteristic feature are vowel alternations of the type *a :*ai and *a : *au. Substratum A1, which is mainly re ected in Germanic, but also leဦ traces in Italo-Celtic and Balto-Slavic, is claimed to have had *a : *i : *u vocalism, prenasalization, initial consonant clusters *Kn- and *Kl-, as well as a remarkable alternation of root- nal stops, including geminates. While A3 did not prove to be a fruitful subject of investigation, one might say that as far as Kuiper’s substratum layers A1 and A2 were concerned, the hunt was on, e.g. Beekes 1996, Schrijver 1997, Boutkan 1996, 1998, 2003, Derksen 1999, 2000. Kuiper’s criteria for identifying substratum borrowings were applied to various Indo-European languages and attempts were made to establish more phenomena indicative of non-Indo-European origin, of which Schrijvers pre x *a- (1997: 307



INTRODUCTION 15
312) is among the most spectacular.15 At the same time, Kuiper’s distinction between A2 and A3 was called into question by Beekes (1996: 217), who proposed to group these two together under the name “European”. I am inclined to agree with him that in this respect Kuiper’s classi cation seems premature. Beekes (ibidem) also suggested the designation “Helladic” for the non-IE substratum language that leဦ so many traces in Greek, but he himself now seems to prefer “Pre-Greek”. Without question, Beekes deserves great credit for his attempt to reconstruct Pre-Greek through a careful analysis of the Greek material (1997, cf. Furnée 1972). A di erent approach is applied by Schrijver (2007), who tries to link the Pre-Greek substratum to “Minoic” (attested in Linear A) and Hattic. In his view, we are dealing here with the language of the rst agriculturalists, who migrated from Asia Minor to Central Europe through Greece and the Balkans and whose language leဦ traces in Anatolian, Greek, Albanian, Germanic, Balto-Slavic and Italo-Celtic. Undeniably, it makes perfect sense to look for formal characteristics of non-IndoEuropean elements in the vocabulary of the individual Indo-European languages. Within a couple of years aဦer the publication of Kuiper’s article, however, the limitations and inherent dangers of this new line of research became apparent, in particular with regard to the Pre-Germanic substratum, where there was a tendency to pay insu cient attention to the role played by speci cally Germanic developments, such as Kluge’s law (see Kroonen forthc.). Though it seems to me that the Indo-European origins of Balto-Slavic etyma which in view of their Germanic cognates seem to violate Winter’s law are suspiciously oဦen unclear, it cannot be denied that the typically Germanic alternation of root- nal consonants may at least partly result from Proto-Germanic sound laws. Nevertheless, the question why Germanic underwent these speci c developments (the rise of geminates, for instance) is still legitimate. So far I have only discussed borrowings from a non-Indo-European substratum, but we must also reckon with the possibility that etyma were borrowed from an unknown Indo-European language. An interesting attempt to demonstrate a layer of borrowings of this type was made by Holzer (1989, cf. Kortlandt 2003). Holzer reconstructs an Indo-European language whose main feature is the fact that it underwent a consonant shiဦ: the traditional tenues became mediae, while the mediae aspiratae became tenues (hence the name “Temematic”). This shiဦ enables Holzer to propose alternative etymologies for words that oဦen belong to classes where substratum borrowings are expected. Holzer’s etymologies will occasionally come up in this dictionary.
3. STRUCTURE OF THE ENTRIES
3.1 The reconstructed etymon
The reconstructed etyma represent a late stage of Proto-Slavic, posterior to the loss of glottalization under the stress and Stang’s law. Quantity, tone and stressed are

marked accordingly (see 3.5) The most recent development that I have taken into account is the shortening of the falling tone in word-forms of more than two syllables, e.g. *sቲᐢrdቲce. With respect to the metathesis of liquids (and the East Slavic polnoglasie), which shows dialectal di erentiation, I had no option but to let the forms re ect the stage where the syllable was still closed, even though the metathesis preceded the above-mentioned developments. The alphabetical order observed in this dictionary is: a b c d e Y < g x i j k l m n o ፱ p r s š Z t u v ጀ y ቲ z ž. Please note the following:
The results of the second and third palatalizations of velars (*k, *g, *x) are written *c, *dz and *Z. This may seem inconsistent, but I considered that there was nothing to gain by using *\ and *d] or *፳ᐑ. The introduction of *Z, on the other hand, could not be avoided, cf. *vቲZቲ ‘all’ vs. *vቲsቲ ‘village’. I have employed the signs *#, *_ and *` to render sequences of resonant + *j. In the alphabetical order these signs are equivalent to *lj, *nj and *rj, respectively. I follow the ESSJa in writing anachronistic *tj, *dj rather than *t\, d፳ᐑ vel sim. Word-initially, I do not distinguish between *e- and *je-. I simply write *ebecause the *j- was automatic before front vowels from a certain stage onwards. I also write *Y- for etymological *Y- and *ja-, which merged aဦer the rise of prothetic *j-. I do distinguish between *u- and *ju-. Initial *jቲ- < *i- is more complicated. I have argued that we basically had stressed *ji- vs. unstressed *jቲwith generalization of the latter in mobile paradigms (Derksen 2003b). Nevertheless, I have decided in favour of a uniform spelling *jቲ-, which is more conventional.
3.2 Grammatical information
Following the reconstruction, there is an indication of the word class the etymon belongs to. In the case of substantives, the stem class is preceded by an indication of gender, e.g. “m. n” for “masculine n-stem”. The exion types to which OCS mlቲn’i(i) ‘lightning’ and svekry ‘church’ belong are designated with and , respectively. If there is more than one lemma, the grammatical information runs parallel to the lemmata. For the sake of readability, the attested Slavic forms are generally speaking only provided with grammatical information if they belong to a di erent word class than the etymon.16 This practice extends to non-Slavic forms insofar as it does not cause confusion.
3.3 Accent paradigm
In those cases where I deemed it justi ed to reconstruct the accent paradigm of a noun or verb, the paradigm is indicated by Stang’s (a), (b) or (c). I am not convinced
16 In the case of original u-stems it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the fact that in the attested languages the u-stem and (masculine) o-stem paradigms have merged into a single paradigm, which here will be referred to as the o-stem paradigm.



INTRODUCTION 17
that there ever was a Proto-Slavic paradigm (d) (Bulatov, Dybo, and Nikolaev 1988, cf. Vermeer 2001). I have occasionally resorted to designations such as (b/c) in those cases where there is strong evidence for two accent paradigms. Tone and quantity are indicated in the same way as is conventional for literary Serbo-Croatian:
short rising: *màti (a) ‘mother’, *m፱ᐐka (a) ‘torment, torture’, *nòžቲ (b) ‘knife’ long rising: *bᖂlጀ (b) ‘white’, p፱ᐑtቲ (b) ‘way’ short falling: *sቲᐢrdቲce (c) ‘heart’ long falling: *m<ᐣso (c) ‘ esh, meat’, *bᎅgጀ (c) ‘god’ long unstressed: *m፲kà ‘ our’ (b), *osnov ‘base, foundation’ (a)
Thus, I have not adopted any of the special signs that are sometimes used to indicate the original acute, e.g. *maᐙti or *maᐅti.
3.4 Meaning
Unlike the ESSJa, I have attempted to provide a reconstruction of the Proto-Slavic meaning of an etymon. In principle, attested forms meaning the same as the reconstructed etymon have not been glossed, though occasionally the meaning has been retained for the sake of clarity. This holds good for both the Slavic and the nonSlavic forms.
3.5 ESSJa
The line beginning with the reconstructed etymon is concluded by a reference to the ESSJa unless, of course, the latter dictionary does not have a corresponding lemma. The most recent volume at my disposal was volume 32 (-*orzbotati). I have not included a reference to the S ownik pras owia ski because at this point the number of published volumes is too limited.
3.6 Church Slavic
The eld “Church Slavic” contains forms that occur in texts belonging to the Old Church Slavic canon as well as forms that occur in Church Slavic texts whose language was in uenced by the local vernacular. The latter varieties of Church Slavic are called recensions. With the aid of the Slovník jazyka staroslovYnského, which, by the way, includes a number of texts that fall outside the canon, and the Staroslavjanskij slovar’, I have tried to keep Old Church Slavic and Church Slavic forms apart. Here I should also mention Birnbaum and Schaeken 1997, where attention is paid to the lexicon of the manuscripts that were discovered at the Monastery of St. Catherine at Mount Sinai in 1975. It is not unusual to present Old Church Slavic forms in a normalized shape and this is the practice I have adopted here. If an etymon is only rarely attested, however, I usually present the form as it occurs in the manuscript(s). If an etymon occurs in a

fairly limited number of manuscripts, the latter have been mentioned. I have used the following abbreviations:

3.7 East Slavic
The East Slavic eld comprises three living languages: Russian, Ukrainian, and Belorussian. Furthermore, an important place is occupied by Old Russian, which can sometimes hardly be distinguished from Russian Church Slavic. Here I generally follow the ESSJa. For Old Russian accentual data I have relied on Zaliznjak 1985. The accentuation of a noun or verb in Old Russian is chie y mentioned in those cases where it deviates from the modern Russian standard language. My main sources for Russian dialect material are the classic dictionary by Dal’ and the Slovar’ russkix narodnyx govorov (SRNG). To indicate the region where a form is attested I have used a number of abbreviations: Psk. (Pskov), Olon. (Olonec), Arx. (Arxangel’sk), Novg. (Novgorod), Smol. (Smolensk), Rjaz. (Rjazan’).
3.8 West Slavic
Czech forms may belong to the literary language, for which the SSJ is an important source, or originate from dialects. Dialect material generally stems from the ESSJa or from Machek’s etymological dictionary. A special category is formed by the 18th century dictionaries of Jungmann and Kott, which include archaic and dialectal forms, but also borrowings from other Slavic languages and neologisms. An analysis of the material from these dictionaries is beyond my competence, so I have con ned myself to indicating Jungmann (Jg.) or Kott as the source. Slovak forms, insofar as they are not dialectal, are generally quoted according to the Slovník slovenského jazyka (SSJ). Since the juxtaposition of Czech and Slovak forms is interesting from an accentological point of view (cf. Verweij 1993), the collection of Slovak material is relatively comprehensive. Upper Sorbian is one of the languages that are not heavily represented in this dictionary. Nevertheless, the language has retained a number of features which may provide additional information about Proto-Slavic prosody (cf. Dybo 1963, 1968b, Derksen forthc. c). In this respect Lower Sorbian has less to o er. Schuster-Šewc’s

INTRODUCTION 19
Sorbian etymological dictionary (HEW) deals with both languages and may also function as a source of older attestations and dialect forms. A considerable portion of the Polish material in the ESSJa, which subsequently found its way to the present dictionary, is quoted from the voluminous dictionaries by Kar owicz et al. (1900-1927) and Doroszewski (1958-1969). For Old Polish the main source is, of course, the yet un nished S ownik staropolski. The etymological dictionaries by S awski (un nished) and Ba kowski (in progress) provide a lot of information about the earliest attestations of an etymon. In this context the S ownik j<zyka polskiego XVII i 1. po owy XVIII wieku (Karplukówna and Ambro ewicz 1999-) is also worth mentioning. Within West Slavic, Slovincian – now extinct – and the North Kashubian dialects are unique in having preserved accentual mobility, albeit with certain restrictions. Furthermore, old quantitative distinctions have been transformed into qualitative distinctions, like in Polish. In Slovincian and Kashubian, however, this phenomenon (called pochylenie in Polish) applies to a greater number of vowels. Our most important source for Pomeranian, as Slovincian and Kashubian are sometimes called, are the works of Friedrich Lorentz (e.g. 1903, 1908-1912, 1958-1983). The westernmost attested Lechitic language, Polabian, only plays a marginal role in this dictionary. Forms will be quoted according to Pola ski and Sehnert 1967.
3.9 South Slavic
The name “Serbo-Croatian” will occasionally be used as a generic designation for all varieties of the language spoken in Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Montenegro. The abbreviation “SCr.”, however, refers in principle to neo-Štokavian, i.e. to those Štokavian dialects that underwent the neo-Štokavian retraction of the stress. A prominent example is the language that was codi ed by Vuk Karadži and uro Dani i in the 19th century and subsequently became the basis of normative grammars and dictionaries, for instance the Rje nik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika (RJA). The Serbo-Croatian (neo-Štokavian) forms presented in this dictionary usually conform to aforementioned normative tradition. In some cases I have quoted directly from Vuk Karadži ’s dictionary (abbreviated as “Vuk”).19 The akavian dialects of Serbo-Croatian are mainly represented by Juriši ’s description of the Vrgada (Vrg.) dialect (1966-1973), Kalsbeek’s description of the dialect of Orbani i (Orb.) near Žminj (1998) and Beli ’s description of the dialect of Novi (1909), which is the best-known description of a akavian dialect. In addition, I have occasionally added data from Hvar (Hraste 1937), Cres (Tentor 1909, 1950), and Orlec20 (Houtzagers 1985). The Kajkavian dialects are respresented by Jedvaj’s description of the Bednja dialect. The Slovene material originates almost exclusively from Pleteršnik’s dictionary (1894-1895), which is a compilation of data from a great variety of sources presented
19 For practical reasons, I have used the third edition of Vuk’s dictionary (Belgrade 1898) instead of the second, which appeared in Vienna in 1852. The latter would have been preferable, as the later editions are marred by misprints.

in a historical spelling, i.e. in a spelling that re ects dialectal di erences that are absent from many dialects, including the ones underlying the modern standard language. The reader will therefore be confronted with the spectacular dialectal di erentiation that is characteristic of Slovene (cf. Greenberg 2000). Bulgarian and especially Macedonian provide little information on the prosody of Proto-Slavic.21 Nevertheless, it is clear that this corner of the Slavic territory must not be neglected. The material presented here is chie y modern Standard Bulgarian.
3.10 Balto-Slavic
Since I adhere to the view that there was a Balto-Slavic proto-language, I found it atttractive to include a eld “Proto-Balto-Slavic” in order to obtain a modernized version of Trautmann 1923a (cf. Derksen forthc. d). As I explained above, I follow Kortlandt in not reconstructing any Balto-Slavic tones. The stage represented by my reconstructions is posterior to Winter’s law. The re ex of the laryngeals and the glottal element of the (pre)glottalized stops is indicated by ᕒ, the IPA symbol for a glottal stop. The phonological system is as follows (cf. Kortlandt 1994):
pb m t ds nl r
kg ᕒ jw iu e! o" a#
With respect to morphology, it is important to note that the barytone neuters have a Nsg. in *-um < *-om, while the originally oxytone neuters have *-o < *-od << *-om. Notwithstanding my comparison with Trautmann’s Baltisch-slavisches Wörterbuch, it is my opinion that these reconstructions in themselves do not have independent evidential value for the Balto-Slavic hypothesis, as striking formal similarities between Proto-Baltic22 and Proto-Slavic etyma usually relate to those common developments on the basis of which the Balto-Slavic linguistic unity was postulated. We must reckon with the possibility that seemingly Balto-Slavic etyma are actually old borrowings from Slavic into Baltic or vice versa. In particular, Baltic substratum words in Slavic are a factor that is to be taken into account (cf. Nepokupnyj 1976). The assumption that there was a Proto-Baltic-Slavic stage raises the question how to act if an inherited Proto-Slavic etymon does not have a Proto-Baltic counterpart?
21 This does not hold good for Middle Bulgarian, which is the language of a number of accented texts. Since Middle Bulgarian is on a par with Russian Church Slavic, etc., it belongs to my category Church
Slavi2c2. Actually, I am not convinced that it is justi ed to reconstruct a Proto-Baltic stage. The term ProtoBaltic is used for convenience’s sake.



INTRODUCTION 21
Does it make sense to reconstruct a Balto-Slavic form anyway, thereby assuming that the etymon was lost in the other branch? In my opinion, it does not. The main point of the eld Balto-Slavic is to get an impression of the number of lexical items shared by Baltic and Slavic. A Proto-Balto-Slavic reconstruction of an etymon that is exclusively found in Baltic or Slavic would just be one of many intermediate stages. Another, quite common problem is the determination of the orginal stem class of a noun in those cases where Baltic and Slavic diverge. Unless there are clear indications which stem class is more archaic, I considerered it best to allow the variation to be re ected in the Balto-Slavic reconstructions.
3.11 Baltic
It stands to reason that Baltic is fairly well represented in this dictionary. On the other hand, it would hardly make sense if the Baltic material were so extensive as it will be in my Baltic etymological dictionary. For this reason I cut down on the Lithuanian and Latvian data by leaving out some of the morphological and accentual variants. Where the modern Standard Lithuanian form serves our purpose, I have quoted from the fourth edition of the DLKŽ. The most important source for Lithuanian, however, is the LKŽ, which has incorporated data from older periods and dialect data. The most important Old Lithuanian text is Daukša’s Postilla (DP). Latvian data will be quoted from the dictionary by Mühlenbach and Endzel ns (ME) and the supplement by Endzel ns and Hausenberg (EH). The orthography used in these works deviates from modern Standard Latvian orthography but is still customary in the scholarly literature. Forms followed by 2 originate from a dialect with two tones (instead of three), where the tone of that particular form is ambiguous from a historical point of view (cf. Derksen 1996: 11-14). We are dealing either with a con ation of the broken and the falling tone (West Latvian) or a con ation of the sustained and the falling tone (East Latvian). These tones are indicated by ^2 and `2, respectively, but it should be noted that there exists considerable variation regarding the realization of the con ated tones. The Old Prussian evidence stems from the Enchiridion (or Third Catechism) unless indicated otherwise: I write “I” for the First Catechism, “II” for the Second Catechism, “EV” for the Elbing Vocabulary, and “Gr.” for Simon Grunau’s vocabulary. The forms are quoted from Trautmann 1910 and Mažiulis PKEŽ.
3.12 Proto-Indo-European
The eld “PIE” basically contains forms that may have belonged to the Proto-IndoEuropean vocabulary. I do not wish to condemn the practice of reconstructing quasiIndo-European forms, as the latter may contain useful information, even in the case of etyma that may have been borrowed from a non-Indo-European language, but I personally prefer to let this information be part of the discussion of the etymology.

3.13 Cognates
It is not my intention to present an exhaustive list of cognates from other branches of Indo-European. One may expect to nd quite comprehensive lists of cognates in the dictionary that is the ultimate goal of the Indo-European Etymological Dictionary project. I have tried to mention forms that are in all respects close to the Proto-Slavic etymon, but occasionally I had to settle for forms that merely contain the same root.
3.14 Discussion of the etymology
As a rule, the etymology of a given root is discussed under a single lemma. If the eymology is perfectly clear, there may be no discussion at all. Instead, only a ProtoIndo-European reconstruction is given.
3.15 Notes
Any lemma may contain a number of notes pertaining to a variety of subjects. The notes do not directly concern the etymology of the lemma, which is discussed elsewhere (see 3.13).
3.16 Cross-references
The last eld mentions all cognate lemmata except the ones that are referred to in the discussion of the etymology. If the discussion of the eymology contains a reference to a cognate lemma, the eld is omitted.

In view of the Baltic forms as well as Ru. ja- (je- > ja- is common in West Slavic and western South Slavic but not in East Slavic), we must reconstruct *oᙑs- < *Heh -s- for Balto-Slavic.

As far as I can see, there are no serious objections to the daring etymology *h&oh&ᑆuptr- ‘fast-flier’ (Vey 1953, cf. Kortlandt 1982: 26). According to Vey, the Slovene falling tone points to the former presence of a weak jer in the medial syllable, but it seems to me that the neo-circumflex may also reflect original posttonic length. The compound has nice parallels in Homeric 62 ‘a swift-winged hawk (or falcon)’ and Lat. accipiter ‘hawk, falcon’.

Though the details would remain unclear, there is definitely a possibility that this is a substratum word showing prefixation of a non-Indo-European type (cf. Schrijver 1997: 307-312). Among the alternative solutions, the analysis *h&oh&ᑆu-sker-, a compound of the word for ‘quick’ and the verbal root that is found in Gk. [ ‘frisk’ as well as probably Lith. skFrᑳs ‘harvestman, daddy-long-legs’ and Latv. š ìrgaîlis2, seems the most attractive (Vey 1953, see also ፖ *astr<bጀ).

BSl. * w-? B Lith. ovyje (DP) ‘in reality’
PIE *h' u- i
Cogn. Skt. víᑣ ‘apparently, noticeably’; Av. auuiš ‘apparently, evidently’
OLith. ovyje ‘in reality’ is sometimes regarded as a borrowing from Slavic but there are no compelling arguments for this view. The absence of initial j- rather points in the direction of an etymological relationship (thus B ga RR I: 370), cf. OLith. jovnai ‘openly’, which is a borrowing from Belorussian. In that case we would have to start from a PBSl. i-stem * v-i- (cf. Anikin 1998: 21, see also s.v. *aviti). On the other hand, it seems possible that the form ovyje, whose oldest attestations are two occurrences in Daukša, is based on Church Slavic avY. The Slavic adverb, in turn, may have been borrowed from Iranian (Lubotsky p.c.).

BSl. * w-? B Lith. ovytis ‘appear’, 3sg. ovijasi
Lith. ovytis (arch.) ‘appear’ derives from the i-stem which must underlie ovyje ‘in reality’. Fraenkel (I: 519) claims that ovytis ‘appear; rage’ and Latv. âvîtiês ‘talk nonsense, get up to mischief ’ are inherited words cognate with Lith. óvaidas (< *avivaidas) ‘rowdy, braggart’, while Lith. jᔁvaidas (< *jeva-vaidas) ‘ghost’ and Latv. jàvîtiês or jâvîtiês ‘behave like an idiot’ are borrowings from Slavic (see also Anikin 1998: 22). I am not convinced that this solution, which seems to rely exclusively on the presence or absence of j-, is correct. Moreover, it is not obvious that ovytis ‘appear’ and ovytis (also jõvytis) ‘rage’ are cognates. It seems quite possible that Lith. óvaidas must be connected with Ukr. jávida (dial.) ‘devil’, Ru. jávid’ (dial.) ‘snake’.

*bàjati 33
There is no direct evidence for a suffix *d᎙l-ቲji-, but the form bali from the Freising Fragments could be regarded as counter-evidence, as dl is regularly retained in this dialect, cf. modliti. It is not impossible, however, that bali is of Church Slavic origin. Truba ev bases his reconstructions *badlቲji and *badlovati chiefly on derivatives of the type of OCz. p edlí ‘spinster’, švadlí ‘needlewoman’. According to the ESSJa (I 137-138), further evidence for a suffix *-d᎙l- is provided by SCr. b፸jalo m. ‘sorcerer’, Ru. bájala (dial.) m./f. ‘talker, chatterer, story-teller’, which may be transformations of *badlቲji. Meillet’s idea (Ét. I: 417) that *bali is based on a derivative in -l- deserves consideration.

This etymon is limited to West and East Slavic. It is tempting to seek a connection with MoDu. bagger ‘mud’ < *b᎙og᎙- and assume that we are dealing with a substratum word. Semantically more remote is OIc. bekkr m., OHG bah m., OS beki m. ‘brook’, which nevertheless may belong here (*b᎙og᎙-nó-?). The problem with an oxytone proto-form (b), whether the root was *b᎙og- (> *boᙑg-) or *b᎙ g᎙-, is the West Slavic evidence for a short root vowel. Lith. bõgnas and bognà 4 are generally regarded as borrowings from Slavic.

In Balto-Slavic, the meaning of this root seems to shifted to ‘to stab’, however, which makes one wonder if ፖ *stegnò ‘thigh’ may derive from a root meaning ‘stab’ as well, cf.

If we assume that *berstጀ is cognate with ፖ *bèrza, which has an acute root, we must explain the variant belonging AP (b). In my view, a form *b᎙erHᘷ-tó- (admittedly with slightly unexpected end-stress) would remain oxytone in Balto-Slavic, in which case the root would be affected by the Proto-Slavic loss of pretonic laryngeals. As I consider it possible that the generalization of accentual mobility in masculine ostems with a non-acute root vowel did not apply to the marginal class of Balto-Slavic oxytona, Illi -Svity ’s reconstruction of a substantivized neuter adjective is not necessarily correct.

PIE *b᎙oid᎙-eh'
Cogn. Alb. be f. ‘oath’ {2}
According to B ga (RR I: 345-346), Lith. bFdà 4 ‘misfortune, trouble, guilt’ is probably not a borrowing from Slavic because it has F instead of the expected ie (cf. biᑱdnas ‘poor’). Indeed, there seems to be no obvious reason why bFdà and Latv. beᐰᐐda ‘sorrow, grief, distress’ should not be old. These words could be connected with bãdas ‘hunger’ and Skt. bᔄdhate ‘oppress’ (B ga l.c., Derksen 1996: 258). However, a dilemma arises if we consider that Slavic *bYditi ‘force, persuade’ cannot be separated from Go. baidjan ‘force’. We must either declare the Baltic forms borrowings or assume that in Slavic *bYd- < *b᎙oid᎙- and *bYd- < *b᎙ d᎙- were contaminated (cf. Anikin 1998: 39). In the latter case OCS bYda ‘distress’ and ‘necessity’ would continue different roots. This is a possibility which cannot be excluded. The hypothesis that Lith. baidýti ‘to scare’ < *b᎙iH- ‘to fear’ is cognate with *bᝐdà and *bYditi (cf. ESSJa II: 55-56) must be rejected, if only on formal grounds.
{1} The vocalism of Modern Polish bieda ‘id.’ is of Mazowian origin, cf. biada ‘woe!’. {2} Demiraj (1997: 94) prefers *b᎙eid᎙-i-s to an -stem.

PIE *b᎙oid᎙-eie
Cogn. Gk. [ ‘persuade’; Go. baidjan ‘force’; OHG beitten ‘demand’
It is very unlikely that Slavic *bYditi ‘force’ and Go. baidjan ‘id.’ belong to different roots. Stang even includes these words in his “Sonderübereinstimmungen” (1972: 14). The meaning ‘persuade’ is another indication that we are dealing with PIE *b᎙oid᎙-. The question is whether denominative *bYditi ‘reduce to poverty, live in poverty’ ultimately continues a different root (see *bᝐdà).

Since both Slavic and Baltic point to BSl. *s instead of *ᑣ, it has been suggested that the root of this etymon was *b᎙oiHd᎙-, cf. Lat. foedus ‘repulsive, terrible, disgraceful’ (cf. Pedersen 1895). An extension of the root is also found in Lith. baidýti, Latv. ba§dît ‘scare’, but it is uncertain if this *d, which may be identified with *d᎙h&- ‘put’ and is part of a productive suffix (cf.

PIE *b᎙lek-o
The semantic connection between *blek(ot)ጀ as the name of various poisonous plants and *blekotጀ ‘chatter, chatterer’ is the fact that particularly henbane may cause a delirium, cf. Ru. belenít’sja (dial.) ‘become infuriated’, SCr. belèna ‘fool’ from *belena ‘henbane’, or the Polish expression brodzi, jakby si< blekotu (‘fool’s parsley’) objad , which equals Cz. jako by se blínu napil. I am inclined to consider the verbs *blekati ‘chatter, mutter, bleat’ and *blekotati derivatives of *blekጀ and *blekotጀ rather than vice versa (pace ESSJa). The development of a meaning ‘bleat’ may have been favoured by the onomatopoetic qualities of the root. Alternatively, we could distinguish a separate onomatopoetic root *blek- ‘bleat’ or even separate *blek‘henbane’ from *blek- ‘chatter, mutter’.

In view of Winter’s law, we would expect to find traces of a glottalic element in BaltoSlavic. The accentuation of Lith. blaivas – the Proto-Slavic form is mobile and therefore inconclusive – offers no evidence for an original acute, however.

B Lith. bálnas 3 ‘white, having a white back (cattle)’

Both the ESSJa and S awski SP (I: 307-309) are inclined to derive *bolna ‘membrane, sapwood’ and *bolna ‘turf, meadow’ from a root meaning ‘white’ (see also Urbutis 1982: 163-164). Though the relationship between ‘membrane’ and ‘white’ may not be obvious, the relationship between the usually light-coloured sapwood and ‘white’ is unproblematic. In view of the semantic similarities between ‘sapwood’ and ‘membrane’, the etymology advocated by the ESSJa and S awski SP may very well be correct. The connection between *bolna ‘turf, meadow’ and *bolto ‘swamp’, where an etymology involving the root for ‘white’ is widely accepted, seems quite plausible.

It seems plausible that we are dealing with two, formally indistinguishable roots (cf. IEW: 122-123, 125-126). The meaning ‘pillow, bolster’ belongs to the same root that underlies Lith. baᒘnas, OHG balg, etc. Stang (1972: 14) attempts to separate ‘beam’ from ‘pillow, bellows’ on formal grounds (*ᘷ vs. ᘷ᎙, respectively), but this does not seem to work, as the Balto-Slavic forms that are supposed to contain *ᘷ do not show the effects of Winter’s law.

According to the ESSJa, *borna ‘harrow’ and *borna ‘guarded entrance, barrier’ belong to one and the same root. Though this may be correct, I prefer to leave it an open question whether these words may be identified. In my opinion, this is tantamount to leaving the question whether PSl. *borti, Lat. fer re and OIc. berja are cognate with Gk. [ «, Lat. for re and OIc. bora unanswered.
{1} We find attestations of bróna (bruna) from the 16th century onwards (S awski SP I: 324).

Likewise, Proto-East Baltic *bristi must have ousted *birsti < *b᎙rd᎙-ti on the analogy of forms with full grade. How old the metathesis actually is, cannot be determined.

Attempts have been made to connect *b+strጀ with ፖ bጀᐐdrጀ ‘cheerful, lively’, which derives from PIE *b᎙ud᎙-. This etymology fails to provide an explanation for the acute *y, however. We could assume that the root is simply *by- ‘be’, but in that case the origin of the suffix would be unclear. In my opinion, it is not unattractive to assume a connection with Skt. bhᔆᑣati ‘support, be active, strengthen’, the root of which is probably an s-enlargement of *b᎙Hu- ‘be’.

Probably the best etymology stems from Zubatý (1894: 385), who connected *cᖃsta with Lith. káišti ‘scrape’. In this view the road is a worn path, cf. Lat. via tr ta (ESSJa s.v.) or Pl. utarta droga (Fraenkel I: 205).

The accent paradigm of * adጀ cannot be determined with certainty. Bogatyrev (1995: 29) slightly prefers (a) to (c). Since the etymology is also unclear, there are a number of possible reconstructions, e.g. *k(ᐁ)ed-o-, k(ᐁ)eh&d(᎙)-o- or – if AP (a) is secondary k(ᐁ) d(᎙)-o-. See also ፖ *kadìti.

Cogn. Skt. cᔄyati ‘perceive, observe’; Gk. [ ‘esteem, respect highly’
Its has been a matter of dispute (see LIV: 377) whether or not the root contains a laryngeal. Even though Dybo (1968: 205, 234, 236) classifies * ajati as (c), it seems to me that the evidence warrants the reconstruction of AP (a), which in my framework implies the former presence of a laryngeal.

The root may be reconstructed as *k(ᐁ)eh&s-, but it has been suggested that the *s belongs to the suffix, the root *k (i.e. *keh&) being a variant of *k (i), cf. Skt. cᔄyati. For the latter verb I have reconstructed *kᐁeh&i-e/o- (ፖ * àjati). The connection with Alb. kóhë f. ‘time, season, weather’ is not straightforward (cf. Kortlandt 1987: 222, Demiraj 1997: 221-222).

Stang (1961: 68-69) has suggested that ekati is cognate with OPr. kackint ‘attain’, Lith. kàkti ‘be sufficient’ (cf. Toporov PJ 1980: 162-163 for the semantic development). In Slavic, we may originally have had * ekti alongside the intensive * Ykati. According to an older etymology (cf. Vasmer s.v. ekát’), * eka- is a reduplicated variant of the root *keh'- that we find in Lat. c rus ‘dear’, MHG huore ‘whore’ (note, however, that according to Schrijver (1991: 95, 112), the -r- belongs to the root here). It seems to me

According to Pokorny (IEW: 224), OCS dažda is analogical after *Ydja (the substantive jažda is not attested in OCS). The j -stem is based on the reduplicated root *dad- < *dodh - (ፖ *dàti), which shows the effects of Winter’s law.

PIE *d᎙egᐁ᎙
In view of the presumed connection between *žegti ‘burn’ and Lith. dègti ‘id.’, *degጀtቲ is sometimes regarded as a borrowing from Baltic. I find it more likely that it is a relic of the original root *deg- < *d᎙egᐁ᎙- (cf. S awski SP III: 34-35), cf. Sln. d<ᐑgniti ‘radiate’, OCz. dehna ‘devil’.

Cogn. OE delfan ‘dig’
Variant with e-vocalism of ፖ *doltò. The ESSJa adduces Cz. dletko (Kott) ‘edge of a plane’ to show that *deltò is not limited to South Slavic. It seems plausible that the egrade is analogical after the verb, but it must be admitted that *delti is hardly attested. The only form mentioned in the ESSJa (IV: 205) is ak. dlisti.
{1} Pleteršnik actually has dlétᑲ, which is probably a misprint.

The ordinal was later reshaped into *dewino-. In view of OPr. new nts ‘nine’, it is possible that the numeral still had initial *n- at the end of the Balto-Slavic period (the *d must have been adopted from ‘ten’), but German influence cannot be excluded.

Perhaps cognate with Skt. dayᙃ ‘fly (of birds, chariots, horses, gods)’. In view of the evidence for circumflex long i, the East Baltic forms may be borrowings from Slavic, but the semantic difference (cf.

Note that East Latv. dìeks2, provided that this is indeed the correct interpretation of the form d ks in that area, may reflect *deik-.

*dòlnᆑ 111
The straightfoward analysis *d᎙oih&-eie- meets with several difficulties.

Skt. dháyati ‘suck’ has been analyzed as *d᎙h&-eie- (see LIV: 142, where the same analysis is applied to OSw. d a), but this reconstruction cannot account for the Slavic form. Klingenschmitt (1982: 148) has suggested for both Slavic *dojìti and Go. daddjan that the formation is built on the present stem, i.e. *d᎙(h&)éie- gave rise to *d᎙oᒙéᒙe-.

According to Ba kowski (2000a: 282), this etymon spread from Belorussian, where it originated from a Lithuanian substratum, to Ukrainian, Russian and Polish. The secondary meaning ‘fate’ is assumed to have arisen in Belorussian. Though this is not an implausible scenario, it should be noticed that the ESSJa mentions late 14th century attestations of dolja in Old Russian / Russian Church Slavic, in the meaning ‘fate’ as well as in the meaning ‘part’.

It has been suggested that the Slavic root *drYm- is a contamination of *dreh&-, cf. Skt. ni-dr yᔄt (Br) 3sg. opt. ‘may sleep, slumber’, and *drem-, cf. Lat. dormi ‘sleep’. A reconstruction *dreh&m is in conflict with the accentual evidence, however. It is therefore more likely that *drYmati has a secondary lengthened grade vowel, which is not uncommon in intensives (cf. Klingenschmitt 1989: 81). One might argue, however, that ‘doze, slumber’ is hardly an intensive meaning.

Unlike the ESSJa, I have separated *drobà II ‘sediment, dregs, entrails’ from *drobà I ‘crumb, small fry, small livestock’, etc. It can be argued that the meanings ‘dregs’ and ‘crumbs’ may be covered by the designation ‘remnants’, but for the root of *drobà I the notion ‘small, fine’ seems essential, while *drobà II is about thick, weak masses.

If the Polish forms are “Ruthenianisms”, there is no objection against positing a root containing a nasal, cf. *d<ga, *d<glጀ, *ned፱gጀ. On the other hand, the parallellism between Pl. duo and Lith. da gia is suggestive. Possibly, the roots *d፱g- and *dug

{1} According to Ba kowski (2000a: 312), duy ‘strong’ and duo (due ) ‘very’, which are attested since the 16th century, originate from Ukrainian.

PIE *d᎙ub᎙-no
The Slavic vacillation between root-final *b and *p (cf. ፖ *dupa) does not have a Baltic counterpart. In East Baltic, however, the full grade *daub- occurs both with acute and circumflex tone, e.g. Latv. duôbjš ‘deep’. The acute variant could be attributed to Winter’s law (note that PGmc. *deupa- ‘deep’ < *d᎙eub᎙-n- by Kluge’s law), but this would leave us without an explanation for the other forms. The many formal problems connected with this root have made it a prime example of a borrowing from a substratum language (cf. Kuiper 1995).

Watkins (1991: 175-176) argues that the basic meaning ‘rainstorm’, which is still attested in OCS, explains why the compound contains the element *dus- ‘bad’, cf. Skt. durdina- < *dus-di-n(-o)-. In this way he challenges the view that Trubetzkoy’s and Vaillant’s etymology (see Trubetzkoy 1927, Vaillant 1927) cannot be correct because to the farmer rain is beneficial. I assume that the long vowel attested in several languages results from the retraction of the ictus from final jers (Derksen forthc. a., forthc. d).

E Ru. dyrá ‘hole, gap’; ORu. dyrja ‘hole’ W Plb. dar ‘hole, prison’
PIE *dr(H )
In the ESSJa, it is argued that Ru. dyrá, which occurs alongside dirá (ፖ *dira), results from secondary ablaut (starting from *dጀr- instead of of *dቲr- ‘tear’). The same is suggested for ፖ *dura. It seems to me that such a scenario requires that there existed a formally and semantically similar root. In this particular case the root of Lith. dùrti ‘stab, push’ has often been mentioned, but more often than not (e.g. Vasmer s.v. dyrá, Fraenkel I: 113, S awski SEJP I: 208) the latter root is considered etymologically identical. This implies that already in Balto-Slavic both *dir- and *dur- functioned as the zero grade of *der- ‘tear’. Here I would like to adopt a more agnostic attitude, i.e. I prefer to provisionally separate forms belonging to the “u” ablaut series from *der‘tear’. Note that Baltic *dur- is firmly acute, while in the case of the verb ‘tear’ there are many indications for an old circumflex.

PIE *h&ed᎙-(H )iH-no
In view of Ru. odín, Gsg. odnogó, etc., the form *edቲnቲ must be due to analogy. The vowel of the second syllable behaves similarly to a so-called “tense jer”: in strong postion we find i (sometimes e), in weak position the vowel is lost. This behaviour might be linked to the j of ፖ *jቲnጀ. Though the j, which before words beginning with a front vowel had arisen as an automatic Hiatustilger, is absent in *edinጀ/*edቲnጀ, it is conceivable that it conformed to the pattern of *jቲnጀ. The problem with this hypothesis is that forms with *jn- < *jቲn appear to be lacking. Andersen’s reconstruction *edeino- alongside *edino- (1996: 116) is, in my opinion, an unsatisfactory explanation for the alternation mentioned above. The origin of the element *ed- < *(h&)ed᎙- is unclear. Pokorny’s reconstruction *ed- is in conflict with Winter’s law.

Connecting the name of the ‘spruce’ or ‘fir-tree’ with Lith. ãdata ‘needle’ and adýti ‘to darn’, as advocated by Fraenkel (I: 117-118) and Pokorny, is semantically attractive but does not make much sense in relation to Lat. ebulum (cf. Andersen 1996: 119).

As the ESSJa observes (VI: 305), the semantics of Pokorny’s root *el- are capacious and complex. In my opinion, there is little evidence for a root *el- ‘light-coloured’. It is tempting to seek a connection between *elቲcቲ and OHG alunt ‘ide’. Pokorny identifies what is presumedly the root of the latter word with the first element of *alb᎙o- ‘white’ and links it to *el-. Since the fish-names under discussion refer to shining, whitish species, this is semantically unproblematic. Nevertheless, it seems quite possible that the root *al/el (Slavic *el as a result of Rozwadowski’s change?) originates from a substratum language.

This plant name is probably a borrowing from a non-Indo-European substratum language. The Slavic forms with *jቲm- may be due to popular etymology (the mistletoe’s sap is used to produce bird-lime), cf. OCS imati ‘to take’.

PIE *HerH(k)s
The š of Sln. rᕕš፧k may have originated in a form *erš-ቲcቲ < *erx-iko- (cf. Andersen 1996: 140). Bezlaj (1977: 17) has proposed to link the Slovene word to SCr. rèkeš ‘eryngo’ (Dubrovnik), with metathesis. The etymological connection with Skt. anrᐩkᑣará- ‘thornless (path)’ – if reliable – is attractive, but the fact that Baltic forms require a laryngeal is problematic.

B Lith. erᐓnis m.(io) 2 ‘wolverine’
Young (2001: 163-164) links Lith. erᐓnis ‘wolverine’ to ORu. renቲ ‘hatred, malice, spite’ and derives these words from Pokorny’s root *er- ‘sich in Bewegung setzen, erregen (auch seelisch ärgern, reizen’ (IEW 326-327). LIV distinguishes between *h&er- ‘wohin gelangen, geraten’ (238, 303) and *h er- (299) ‘sich in (Fort-)bewegung setzen’, cf. Kümmel 2000. Formally *ertቲ may only belong to the former root, which is semantically less attractive, but it should be noted that the distinction between the roots is not always clear.

If the root is indeed PIE *h&es ‘to be’, which would lead to a reconstruction *h&os-en-, the e- of the Slavic forms as opposed to the *o- elsewhere (Old Prussian being inconclusive) may be an instance of ablaut or a result of “Rozwadowski’s change”.

PIE *h'eᑆ-er
It seems obvious that this Balto-Slavic etymon is cognate with Germanic *ah-s-/*ahiz- ‘ear’, cf. Go. ahs n., OIc. ax n., OHG ahir, ehir n., and with such forms as OHG ahil ‘Ährenspitze’, MoE (arch.) ail ‘beard on wheat and barley’ (Kluge-Seebold 1999: 21, Falk-Torp: 1326). A nice parallel for the meaning ‘perch’ is OIc. ፱gr ‘bass’ < *agura- < *h'eᑆ-. Since the root is probably *h'eᑆ- ‘sharp’, the forms with *e- must be considered instances of Rozwadowski’s change. Note that we find a- in the Latvian forms but also in Lith. ašakà ‘fishbone’ and aš(t)rùs ‘sharp’.

This is another case where we find Balto-Slavic evidence for *e- corresponding to *aor *o- in other branches of Indo-European (Rozwadowski’s change). Toporov (PJ I: 67) regards the k of the Baltic forms as evidence for a western technological borrowing. Since the Baltic and Germanic forms mean exactly the same, while the Slavic forms are semantically more remote, this is a serious option.
{1} The Standard Lithuanian form with a- may stem from the territory where the development e- > a- occurred. In any case, the attestations of the form with e- (see the LKŽ, s.v.) indicate that there are Lithuanian forms completely matching Latv. ecêšas.

The Baltic forms are not without problems, however. Forms like erškᑱtas and erškᔁtras were probably influenced by erškᔁtis ‘thorn’ (thus B ga RR I: 328), though it must be admitted that a development erškᑱtas < eškᑱtras is plausible in itself (cf.

Cogn. MoHG jauge (dial.) ‘barn’
It is evident that *evቲja is a borrowing from Baltic. The Baltic word is a derivative of the word for ‘grain’, Lith. java§, which lacks a Slavic counterpart. The resyllabification of *iauᐵ-i to *iau-ᒙ may account for the metatonical acute tone of both the Lithuanian and the Latvian form, if we assume that the original form was *iauᐵ-ì . The East Slavic word *ovinጀ apparently underwent the e- > o- shift (I do not share Andersen’s objections to the ESSJa’s Proto-Slavic reconstruction *evinጀ, theoretical though it is).
{1} The form without -n- has been recorded from 1540 onwards in many different shapes, e.g. ev’ja, jav’ja, evga and javga. According to Anikin (2005: 143), only the form jaÓja is known in the living language. The other forms are limited to areas that were inhabited by Lithuanians.{2} Since 1554 many variants have been recorded, e.g. jawia, jawgia, jewia, jowia. {3} There are many variants, viz. jáujF, jáujis, jáujas, jáujus. {4} The oldest source (1604) has the spelling jawyge (Toporov PJ II: 21).

A cognate from outside Balto-Slavic is Arm. ezr ‘bank, border, limit’ < *h&(e)ᘷ᎙- (ፖ *Yzጀ for the semantic aspects of the etymology).

The root of this adjective can be identified with *h'eid᎙- ‘kindle’ if we assume that the acute originates from the suffix *-Hsk- << *-sk-, cf. OIc. eiskra ‘rage with heated excitement’. Here the laryngeal of the suffix must have arisen through reanalysis of sta-presents containing a root ending in *-RH (Derksen 1996: 291-294, 337). This development can easily be pointed out in East Baltic, where it spread to roots of other structures, but is not so clear if it can be traced back to Proto-Balto-Slavic. My explanation of the acute in the etymon under discussion implies that it can.

Cogn. Arm. ezr ‘bank, border, limit’
Meanings such as ‘mill-pond’, ‘drain, canal’ and ‘brook’ form a semantic link between *Yz-/ez- ‘dam, weir’ and ፖ *ᎀzero ‘lake’, cf. MoE dike ‘thick bank or wall built to control water’ vs. MoHG Teich ‘pond’. The original meaning in Balto-Slavic is best covered by the word balk, meaning both ‘boundary-strip, dividing ridge’, ‘wooden beam’ and (dial.) ‘fishing-weir’. Arm. ezr (ፖ *ᎀzero), which basically means ‘edge’, agrees semantically very well with the Balto-Slavic etymon under discussion.

It seems perfectly plausible to me that this etymon is cognate with ፖ *ežቲ ‘hedgehog’ (thus B ga RR II: 217). Like its close relative the perch, the ruff has prickly fins (cf. MoHG Barsch ‘perch’, Borste ‘bristle’, Lith. ešerᑳs ‘perch’, which presumably derives from *h'eᑆ- ‘sharp’). The g of this word may be the well-known Baltic intrusive velar. In that case, archaic Lith. egžlᑳs would have preserved the original constellation. The Slavic forms would have to be borrowings from Baltic, which in view of their distribution is not unlikely.
{1} Other dialect forms are jaškar and jazgar. {2} In this case the term “northern dialects” probably refers to Kashubian. {3} The Standard Lithuanian word is p gžlᑳs.

The root of *gadati, which seems to have lengthened grade, could be regarded as a variant of *gᐁet, cf. the synonymous ፖ *g tàti, Go. qiþan ‘say, speak’. Late Vedic gádati ‘say, speak’ may have originated from *gat- as a “Reimbildung” after vádati (Mayrhofer KEWA: 318), which renders a direct comparison with *gadati doubtful (pace ESSJa s.v.). More convincing than the suggested connection with *gᐁet- is the etymology that links *gadati to OIc. gáta ‘get, learn, guess’, Gk. 1⁄4 ¶ [ ‘contain’, Lat. prehend ‘take, seize’ < *ghed-.

CS CS gatati ‘tell fortunes, guess’ W OPl. gata\ ‘talk, chatter’ S SCr. gátati ‘tell fortunes, guess, await, talk’; Sln. gátati ‘guess, tell fortunes’, 1sg. g፹tam (possibly of Serbo-Croatian origin); Bulg. gatam ‘tell fortunes, guess’
Cogn. Go. qiþan ‘say, speak’
The etymological relationship with Go. qiþan etc. is plausible, but the fact that there is a synonymous verb ፖ *g dàti presents a problem. Unless we wish to assume that the latter verb, which may contain a root *g᎙ d-, originates from a variant of *gᐁet-, we may consider the possibility that we are dealing with two etymologically distinct roots that became mixed up.

E Ru. glaz ‘eye’ W Cz. hlaz (Kott) ‘eye’ (probably a borrowing from Russian); Pl. g az ‘rock, cobble-stone’
Etymology unclear. If we accept that here the *z arose from *s as a result of Zupitza’s law (cf. Shevelov 1964: 147-148), it is possible to establish a connection with OHG glas ‘glass, amber’, MoE glare, etc. The correctness of the law is doubtful, however.

PIE *ghlend
Cogn. OIr. as-gleinn ‘investigate, examine’; MHG glinzen ‘shine’
LIV (200) reconstructs *g᎙lend᎙- because a proto-form with root-final *d would trigger Winter’s law, which is not in agreement with the circumflex of the BaltoSlavic forms. It is unclear to me, however, what exactly is the evidence for a BaltoSlavic circumflex. The mobile accentuation of Ru. gljadét’ (ፖ *gl<dYti) is inconclusive, while there is ample evidence for *gl<ᐐdati, with fixed stress on an originally acute syllable. To my knowledge, there is no Baltic evidence for an original circumflex, the Latvian forms being ambiguous. I therefore prefer the reconstruction *g᎙lend-, which has the additional advantage of corresponding with the Germanic forms.

B Lith. gla§stas m. 2/4 ‘layer of clay, plaster’
Though masculine o-stems belonging to AP (b) in principle continue old neuters, I am uncertain if this holds for original oxytona, i.e. words that were already oxytone before Dybo’s law. Here the reconstruction of an old oxytonon may account for the unexpected absence of a laryngeal in the root, which can now be attributed to the Early Slavic loss of laryngeals in pretonic position. In view of Hirt’s law, which would have generated root stress, a reconstruction with a zero grade (*glh&it-tó) is preferable. The semantically different Lith. gla§stas probably continues an old neuter, in which case métatonie douce is plausible.

The etymology of *glob- is unclear and so is the issue if we must distinguish more than one root.

S SCr. glòbati ‘gnaw’; Sln. gl፱ᐑbati ‘excavate, gnaw’, 1sg. gl፱ᐑbam, 1sg. gl፱ᐑbljem
The root *glob- has been connected with Gk. ¤ ‘hollow, hollowed’, ¶ [ (Hes.) ‘scrape up, dig up, hollow’, but this etymology seems doubtful to me. Note that for the meaning ‘excavate’ we must reckon with influence of globòk ‘deep’, cf. globíti ‘excavate’, glóbsti ‘excavate, carve’.

Etymology unclear. It seems completely unlikely that *glota derives from *gel- ‘swell’ and has anything to to with Go. kilþei ‘womb’ (pace Pokorny IEW: 358)

It is often assumed that the root of this adjective is connected with *gleub᎙-, cf. Gk. [ ‘cut out, engrave’, but the presence of *፱ < *oN (not *uN) can hardly be accounted for. Note that Slk. hlboký seems to derive from glጀbòkጀ.

B Lith. gniᕀsas m. ‘parasite’
The ESSJa holds that the forms mentioned above reflect a late variant *gn’usጀ rather an original e-grade *gneus. In neither case would I expect a development *u > *ቲ. In order to get the desired reflex we must posit a comparatively early form *gnjus-. Here the *j could have been adopted from *gnjous- < *gneus-, but there is no evidence for variants with an e-grade. Lith. gniᕀsas is probably a borrowing from Belorussian (thus Skardžius 1931: 76), though one may call it suspect that this is precisely the language that has forms containing a sequence hnju, e.g. hnjus ‘bastard, miser’.

B Latv. gàle f.(!) ‘thin crust of ice, remnants of ice on the road after the snow has gone’
The ESSJa adheres to the view that *golotቲ is cognate with ፖ *gòlጀ ‘naked’ (cf. Berneker SEW I: 322). Seemingly more straightforward from a semantic point of view is the link with forms such as Lat. gel ‘ice’, which derives from *gel- or *ᘷel‘freeze’. On the other hand, it is a fact that there are compounds referring to ‘ice’ that contain the adjective *gòlጀ, e.g. Ru. gololédica, Pl. go omróz. Furthermore, the etymology that starts from the root ‘freeze’ would give rise to the question of the relationship between the initial velars of *golotቲ and ፖ *xᎅldጀ.

PIE *g᎙ost(i)-pot
Cogn. Lat. hospes m. ‘host’
To my knowledge, there is no convincing explanation for the problem that the ProtoSlavic etymon has a *d. According to Ernout-Meillet (529), the variation between *pot- and *pod- is old, cf. Gk. X[ ‘be master’, but in view of Winter’s law this explanation does not work for Slavic.

I have adopted the widespread view that *g፱ba ‘tree-fungus’ and *g፱ba ‘lip, mouth’ are etymologically identical, the latter being secondary. Formally there are no problems. In the case of Cz. huba and houba we may be dealing with differentiation resulting from the generalization of either the short or the long variant of the root (the long variant originated from the so-called “Czech lengthening”, see Kortlandt 1975a: 19). The connection with Gk. , ‘sponge’ is formally very difficult.

Adjectival derivative of ፖ *grozà. Sln. gróz፧n ‘stately, beautiful’ has been compared to Latv. gr<zns ‘beautiful, lush, proud’, Lith. gražùs, grãžnas ‘beautiful’. Though this is an intriguing idea, it seems hardly plausible that the Slovene adjective is to be separated from the other Slavic forms.

These words are usually considered cognate with Latv. graûds ‘grain’, OIc. grautr ‘groats’, etc., in which case the root is *g᎙roud-. The nasal in Pl. gr d may be secondary. I have adopted the ESSJa’s set of lemmata, but it should be noted that the evidence for a nasalized vowel is very limited. One may wonder if the o-stem *gr፱dጀ belongs here. The reconstructions with *፱ are partly based on the suggested connections with ፖ *gr<da and ፖ *gr፱ᐣdቲ, neither of which is beyond doubt. Forms such as Bulg. g rdá ‘breast’, which points to a nasal, may not belong here.

The numerous formal difficulties connected with this etymon and its cognates render the reconstruction of a proto-form impossible (cf. Schrijver 1991: 487-488). Unlike the ESSJa, I am not unclined to reject the connection with the non-Slavic forms.

On the basis of Balto-Slavic, we may propose a reconstruction *ᘷ᎙uoiᘷ᎙-d᎙eh&-, but considering the fact that in Lithuanian we find žvai( g)zdᔂ alongside žvai(g)ždᔂ (with assimilation?), the reconstruction *ᘷ᎙uoid᎙-d᎙eh&- is a serious alternative, cf.

Pokorny’s reconstruction *ᘷhuᐵoigᐁ- is based on the connection with Gk. È£ ‘pure, bright, radiant’, which I consider untenable.

The Baltic material points unambiguously to an acute root, which is in agreement with the vocalism of *gyža, whether *y reflects *unᙑ or *uᙑ.

that there is also evidence for ፖ *guzጀ. Another form containing a nasal is Lith. gùnga ‘hump, hunch’, where the *ᘷ was apparently depalatalized, unless we assume that this word is not related. Still more remote is Lith. gugà ‘bump, knot (in wood), withers’, where apart from the nasal also the glottalization is absent, cf.

The s-stem that occurs in Slovene and in late Church Slavic texts must be analogical after forms such as kolesa ‘wheels’, ojesa ‘thills’ (cf. Vaillant Gr. II: 237).

The connection with Lith. áigyti (dial.) ‘prick, sting, incite, beat’, a§garas ‘straw’ (Toporov PJ s.v. ayculo), does not seem implausible. OPr. ayculo may have <c> for g. The assumption that ay- reflects *ei is not trivial. The Slavic root may have either zero grade or e-grade unless the root has initial *h' or *h . Note that in case of a zero grade in the root the *u of the suffix would have blocked the progressive palatalization.

are possibly cognate with Lith. jᔆra ‘sea’, Latv. j ra ‘id.’, etc. On the other hand, Sln. ir is similar to vir ‘Wasserwirbel’, which seems to belong together with *vቲrYti ‘boil’, etc. Formally, *jቲrጀ( jቲ) and Lith. jᔆra could both continue *iuHr-, but in that case it becomes impossible to establish a connection with *ueHr, cf. Skt. vᔄr ‘water’. A full grade *euHr- would yield BSl. *iouHr-, cf. Lith. jáura ‘marshy land’. Subsequently, the *i- could have spread to the zero grade. The PSl. reflex of *uHr- would have been *vyr-. Nevertheless, it seems more probable to me that such forms as Ukr. výrij were influenced by derivatives containing the prefix vy- or arose from collocations with *vጀ (cf. ESBM II: 279-280).

Drawing a comparison with Germanic forms such as MHG witewal, with a first element meaning ‘wood’, Bulaxovskij (1968: 104) has proposed that *jቲvቲlga continues *jቲvo-vቲlga (*jቲva ‘willow’). This is a reasonable attempt to account for the problematic prothetic vowel. I consider it possible, however, that we are dealing with a substratum word, cf.

The fact that the accentological evidence points to AP (a) is problematic if, following LIV (371), we reconstruct the root as *kᐁei- ‘observe, perceive’. Since this is the root that I (s.v. * àjati) reconstructed as *kᐁeh&i-, the formal difficulty may be solved by positing *kᐁoh&i-. From a semantic point of view, however, I consider it more plausible that we are dealing here with the same root as in ፖ *cYnà, where the reconstruction of a laryngeal seems unfounded.

Unlike the ESSJa, I consider it unlikely that the Baltic forms are borrowings from Slavic (see also Fraenkel s.v. klᔁtis, Anikin 2005: 169-171). I agree that long vowels in borrowings are not necessarily circumflex in Lithuanian, but the vocalism F instead of ie is not what we would expect in a loanword from Slavic. The ESSJa assumes that



*klìknቂti 225
the vocalism is due to remodelling, but I find that unconvincing. It seems preferable to reconstruct *kleh&-ti- with secondary mobility in the Slavic i-stem. The reason why the Baltic words have been regarded as borrowings is that it makes it possible to derive the *Y of the Slavic etymon from *oi, cf. Go. hleiþra ‘hut, tent’, OIr. clíath ‘hurdle, woven wall’, late Lat. cl ta ‘enclosure’ < *ᑆlei-, whereas a root ᑆleh&- cannot easily be connected with forms from other branches of Indo-European.

I assume that the mobile o-stems found in East Slavic are secondary and that the root-final laryngeal was lost in pretonic position in an end-stressed noun kolᙑtò or kolᙑtጀᐐ. Note that due to the transfer of the original barytone neuter o-stems (in *-om > *-um > *-ጀ) to the class of the masculine o-stems, there was widespread vacillation between the Nsg. endings *-ጀ and *-o (cf. Illi -Svity 1963: 49, Derksen forthc. a: passim). The relationship between *kóltጀ and ፖ *koltìti (see also Derksen 1996: 118) may be compared with the one between ፖ *moltጀ and ፖ *moltìti but is not completely parallel (see ፖ *moltጀ). I wonder if the East Slavic variant kólot may be analogical after mólot. The East Baltic forms do not show metatony, which is regular in the case of to-derivatives of dominant acute roots. The final stress reflected by the Slavic etymon may be due to the productivity of the neuter suffix *-tò (*-tጀቹ). In view of the numerous Old Prussian derivatives in –tan (e.g. dalptan ‘punch’), the spread of the suffx may have been a Late Balto-Slavic development, in which case the East Baltic state of affairs results from redistribution according to the accentual properties of the root.

Etymology disputed. An attempt can be made to connect *kò_ቲ with Ru. kobýla ‘mare’, etc., which may be cognate with Lat. caballus ‘working-horse’. In that case we might posit a (non-IE) root *kab- (with a non-glottalized *b) and derive *kò_ቲ from *kab-n-io-. Another possibility is to start from *kom-nቲ and seek a connection with ORu. komonቲ, Cz. komo ‘horse’ and maybe also Lith. kumᑱlF ‘mare’.

The reconstruction *k(ᐁ)h'uop-o- was first proposed by Schrijver (1991: 161), who tried to account for the accentual difference between Latv. kûpt, kûpêt ‘smoke, steam’ and Lith. kvᔂpti ‘cough, breathe’ by placing the laryngeal before the *u. The broken tone of Latv. kvêpt is assumed to be analogical after the zero grade. I would like to add that the broken tone may also orginate from the sta-present, cf.

The often advocated connection with Lith. karᐓšti, Latv. kᕧrst ‘comb, card’, Lat. carrere ‘card’ (from PIE *(s )ker-s-) is problematic because the tone of the Baltic verb does not match the acute of *kòrsta. Perhaps there is a relationship with PGmc. *harska‘raw’. It seems hardly possible that we are dealing with a borrowing from German, cf.

Schrijver (1991: 429) makes an effort to derive the various forms that have been mentioned in connection with Lat. carin re (ፖ *koriti) from *k(e/o)r-. One may consider a reconstruction *kar-, however. Note that Gk. ¶ cannot reflect a form with syllabic *r. The etymological connection with Lith. kãras ‘war’, which has also been connected with *korጀ, seems quite uncertain (see Fraenkel s.v.).

This etymon can be analyzed as *kor- ‘cut’ (PIE *(s)kor-) plus the suffix *-yto that we find in Ru. kopýto ‘hoof ’. We may compare Lith. prãkartas ‘manger, trough’, OPr. pracartis ‘trough’, which contain a root *kort- ‘hew’, an enlarged variant of the abovementioned root.

The ESSJa regards *kosà ‘scythe’ as etymologically identical with ፖ *kosà I. This may indeed be the best solution. It seems unlikely that *kosà ‘scythe’ derives from PIE *ᑆos-, cf. Skt. Zástra- n. ‘knife’. Positing original zero grade of the root, as has been done for Skt. Zástra- and Lat. castr re, does not seem to explain the depalatalization of *ᑆ- because in that case we would expect *kox- < *koᑣ- << *kᑣ-, but before a consonant *kos- < *koᑣ- << *kᑣ- is possible. Likely candidates for this development, such as Slk. kostura ‘big knife’, Ukr. kostúra ‘knife for slaughtering animals’, seem to be related with ፖ *kᎅstቲ ‘bone’, however.

Cogn. Lat. costa f. ‘rib’
The relationship with the otherwise isolated Lat. costa ‘rib’ seems quite possible. An interesting hypothesis is to regard the *k of *kᎅstቲ as the reflex of the initial laryngeal of PIE *h'ost- ‘bone’, cf. Skt. ásthi, Gk. » a , in an Indo-European substratum language (cf. Kortlandt 1997b: 47, where the option is dismissed, however). Meillet (e.g. 1921, Ét. II: 262) regards the *k as a prefix. If the root is *h'ost-, we are probably dealing with an original neuter *kosti.

According to one theory, *kotìti s< derives from *kotጀ ‘cat’, which must be a borrowing from a non-Indo-European language (cf. Lat. cattus, attested since Palladius, which ousted f l s). On the other hand, there is Lat. catulus ‘young of an animal’, already attested in Plautus, which has been connected with OIc. haðna f. ‘goat’.

In view of the East Baltic forms, the root must have ended in a dental stop. We may reconstruct either *k(ᐁ)ond- (where Winter’s law would be responsible for the acute) or *k(ᐁ)onHd(᎙)-. It is therefore formally possible to regard the root under discussion as a nasalized variant of the root of Skt. kh d- ‘chew, bite, eat’ and Arm. xacanem ‘bite’. Like the Armenian form, Slavic *k፱sati seems to contain *-s-.

Etymology unclear. The ESSJa derives this etymon from the root *(s )ker- ‘cut’.

B Latv. krijât ‘skin’
In my dissertation (1996: 271-272) I discussed the accentual properties of the East Baltic root *krei- ‘skim, fish’. Beside solid evidence for an original acute, we find forms pointing to a circumflex. Schrijver, in his discussion of Lat. cern (1991: 407408), does not commit himself. LIV (366-367) now reconstructs a root *kreh&(ᒙ)‘sieben, trennen’ and claims that CS kroiti continues an iterative *kroh&ᒙ-éᒙe-, but with a root *kroih&-, which is supposed to be analogical after the metathesized zero grade. In view of similar problems connected with roots of the structure CVHI- (cf. ፖ *gojiti), I think that this is acceptable. The original full grade *kroh&ᒙ- seems to be present in ፖ *kràjቲ.

Etymology unclear. An analysis *krot-sno, with the root of Lith. krᔂsti ‘shake’ (Vaillant Gr. IV: 584) is semantically not particularly convincing. More promising is the connection with forms such as Lith. krãsF (obs., dial.), krᑱsF (dial.) ‘chair’, Latv. kreslis ‘(simple) sledge’. The relationship between this root *kres- and the root of ፖ



*krotìti
250
*krᖃslo < *kréᙑslo, cf. also Latv. kreᐰᐒsls ‘Stuhl, der Teil des Spinnrockens, in dem die Beine ruhen’ is unclear to me. Even the assumption that a lengthened grade yields an acute brings no solution because the fact that this Balto-Slavic neuter o-stem has fixed stress must be due to Hirt’s law, which is a retraction of the ictus to a nonapophonic vowel.
*krotìti v. ‘tame’ ESSJa XIII 17
CS OCS krotiti (Euch., Supr.) ‘tame, reassure’, 1sg. krošt፱ E Ru. krotít’ (dial.) ‘soothe, restrain, tame, club to death (fish, seals)’ W Cz. krotiti ‘soothe, restrain, tame’; Slk. kroti ‘soothe, restrain, tame’; OPl. kroci\ ‘soothe, tame’ S SCr. kròtiti ‘tame, calm’; Sln. krotíti ‘tame, restrain’, 1sg. krotím

According to Berneker (I: 624), we must start from a meaning ‘castrate’, but there is little formal support for this hypothesis, Gk. a[ ‘rattle, clap, knock, strike’ being the best example. The connection with *(s )kert- ‘cut’ (ፖ * ersti) would require Schwebeablaut and is therefore not very convincing.

The root *kr፱k- has been linked to words meaning ‘bend’ (cf. ፖ *kr፱ᐣgጀ), but the voiceless root-final velar is awkward and almost isolated within Slavic. Vasmer (s.v. kru ína) mentions Sln. ukro iti, ukrokniti ‘bend’.

CS OCS kuritጀ s< (Euch.) 3sg. ‘smokes’ E Ru. kurít’ ‘smoke’, 1sg. kurjú, 3sg. kúrit W Cz. kou iti ‘smoke’; Slk. kúri ‘kindle, smoke’; Pl. kurzy\ ‘raise dust, smoke’ S SCr. kúriti (dial.) ‘smoke, set fire to’; ak. k rᎂt (Orb.) ‘smoke (ham, etc.)’, 1sg. k rin; Sln. kúriti ‘kindle, smoke’, 1sg. kúrim
B Lith. kùrti ‘light, kindle’; Latv. kurᐓt ‘light, kindle’
If *k rìti is cognate with Lith. kùrti, the vocalism * < *ou must be secondary. The Lithuanian verb, which also means ‘make, create’ has been connected with Skt. krᐩᑓóti ‘do, make’ < *kᐁr-. This etymology is not implausible, though the fact that the East Baltic evidence points to a root-final laryngeal is problematic. One may consider an extended root *kᐁrH-, which would not be unprecedented. A reconstruction with a labiovelar has the advantage that it explains why we find *ur instead of *ir. It seems to me that if we also wish to establish a link with Lat. carb ‘charcoal’, Go. hauri n. ‘coal’, OIc. hyrr m. ‘fire’, it might be best to give up the above-mentioned etymology and simply reconstruct *kerH-.

BSl. *kupB Lith. k pᔁti ‘boil over’, 3sg. kᕀpa
In my opinion, Schrijver (1991: 260-263) correctly separates kypᖃti from Latv. kûpêt ‘smoke, steam’, vapor ‘steam, heat’, etc., which he derives from a root *k(ᐁ)h'up- (ፖ *kopጀtቲ). An analysis of the East Baltic material alone nearly suffices to establish the roots *kûp- ‘smoke, steam’ and *kup- ‘boil, seethe’, e.g. Latv. kûpt, kûpêt ‘smoke, steam’ vs. kupêt, kupuôt ‘seethe’. The latter root may go back to PIE *kup-, cf. Skt. kupyati ‘swell, heave or boil with rage or emotion, be angry, be angry with’, Lat. cupi ‘desire’. LIV distinguishes between *keuᐵp- ‘innerlich beben’, *kuᐵeh&p- ‘sieden’, and *kuep‘hauchen’. The root *kuᐵeh&p- is posited on the basis of forms that do not or not necessarily require a laryngeal, such as Lith. k pᔁti ‘boil over’ (cf. Lith. kùpti, Latv. kupt ‘rise (bread)’ and OCS kypYti, the etymon under discussion. The forms that do require a laryngeal, viz. Latv. kûpt and kûpêt ‘smoke, steam’ have a different meaning and can be linked to the forms mentioned under *kuᐵep- if we adopt Schrijver’s reconstruction.

*làjati I 267
BSl. *kuᙑs-aᙑ
Latv. kûsât ‘boil’
LIV (374) derives Slavic *kys- from an aorist stem *kuth'-s. The root is reconstructed as *kuath'-, cf. Skt. kváthant- (YV+) ptc. prs. act. ‘bubbling, boiling’, Go. ፥aþo f. ‘foam’. I seriously doubt the necessity to reconstruct *a for this root, but my main objection is that the fact that the root is acute is not explained, cf. also Ru. kvásit’ ‘make sour, pickle’, SCr. kv፸siti ‘moisten, dip’. If we want to stay close to LIV’s reconstruction (the presence of a dental before *s would explain that in the zero grade we do not see the effects of the ruki-rule, but perhaps this is due to analogy), we may posit *kuHth'-s-, but of course there is a possibility that the Slavic root is not cognate with Skt. kvath-.

Lith. lãvinti ‘train, develop’ must derive from lavùs ‘adroit, dexterous’ (ፖ *lovጀkጀ) and is therefore not to be compared directly with *lovìti. Latv. lavît ‘catch’ is probably a borrowing from Slavic.

This word for ‘vine’ is usually compared with Lith. lazdà ‘stick, staff, (OLith., dial.) hazel’, Latv. la(g)zda, OPr. laxde ‘hazel’, which are semantically closer to ፖ *lᝐskà. In addition, the latter etymon contains a consonant sequence that can be linked to Baltic *( g)zd. On the other hand, the root vocalism of lozà is the same as in the Baltic forms meaning ‘hazel’. The problem is to explain the relationship between the *-z- of *lozà and the consonant sequences that occur in the Slavic and Baltic words for ‘hazel’. Possible parallels are ፖ *gr<zti vs. Lith. grimzd- ‘sink’ and ፖ *bጀrzdጀ, Lith. burzdùs, vs. ፖ *bጀrzጀ.

B Latv. làuskas2 Npl. ‘flake, dandruff ’
According to Vaillant (Gr. IV: 122), *luska derives from the verb *luskati < *lup-sk-ati (< *loup-). Though the accentuation of several forms is in conflict with this etymology, it is nevertheless an attractive solution. The East Latvian form làuskas2 may very well differ etymologically from laûska ‘something broken, potsherd, splinter, the breaker (personification of frost)’, which clearly derive from laûzt ‘break’. This raises the question to what extent *louᘷ-sk- may be present in Slavic. Though *louᘷ-sk- would regularly yield *lusk- in Balto-Slavic, it is only to be expected that the glottal stop originating from Winter’s law was occasionally restored.

PIE *meh's
In spite of the fact that the x in *maxati is not the regular reflex of *s in this position, I assume that we are dealing with a Balto-Slavic enlargement s of the root *meh'- ‘to beckon’ (cf. Vaillant Gr. III: 332), for which see ፖ *majati, *mavati.

BSl. *maHB Lith. móti ‘beckon’; Latv. mãt ‘beckon’
PIE *meh'Cogn. Go. afmauiþs ‘tired’; OHG muoan ‘alarm, worry’
It is clear that *majati and *mavati continue one and the same verb, j and v being “Hiatustilger”. While majati ‘to beckon’ cannot be separated from Lith. móti, Latv. mãt ‘id.’, majati ‘to detain, to tire, to exhaust’ has been linked to Germanic forms like OHG muoan and Go. afmauiþs (cf. Stang 1972: 35). The respective roots in Pokorny are m - (693) and m - (746). If we assume that *majati indeed continues *meh'- as well as *meh - (LIV: 382), we have to settle for semantic arguments. Since it is also possible to argue on semantic grounds that *majati ultimately continues *meh'- ‘to beckon’ only (ESSJa XVII 134), it is to a certain extent a matter of taste which solution one prefers.

The Germanic forms show grammatischer Wechsel as well as an alternation * : *a. The vocalism, which could reflect PIE *eh& : *h&, does not match the of the Greek and the Slavic forms, which leads us to assume that the vowel alternation arose when at a comparatively late stage the root m k- was borrowed into Germanic (cf. KlugeSeebold: 565). The Lithuanian and Latvian forms are usually considered borrowings from Germanic, whereas OPr. moke may have been borrowed from Polish. The Estonian and Livonian forms must be borrowings from Baltic, probably Latvian. It is generally agreed upon that ultimately we are dealing with a word of non-IndoEuropean (Mediterranean?) origin.
{1} Besides, we find the variants maguona and mag na. The forms with m are restricted to the area around KlaipÛda. {2} I have found the variants magùona2, magana, magane and mag ne. The initial m of the word for ‘poppy’ was apparently lost in Lithuanian but not in Latvian. The Lithuanian dialect forms with m- may be due to the influence of the (Latvian) language of the fishermen of the Curonian Isthmus (cf. B ga RR III: 320). Sabaliauskas (1960: 71-72) suggests dissimilatory loss of m, parallel to the loss of r in arotai : rarotai, akr tas : rakr tas, Latv. ruodere : uodere, eris : eris. {3} The first element means ‘sleep’, cf. Nw. vale (dial.) ‘deep sleep’, Sw. valbjörn (dial.) ‘Schlafdorn’.

The question is whether *màlጀ can be linked to PIE *melH-, as has been advocated by Varbot, for instance (1972: 63). In view of the acute root vowel, I consider this unlikely: we would have to posit a lengthened grade root of which the acute intonation is analogical after forms with full or zero grade. Thus, I prefer to reconstruct a root *mh&-, which in the etymon under discussion is followed by an lsuffix (cf. Vaillant Gr. IV, 545, where the root is assumed to be identical with the root of Ru. májat’, which I reconstruct as *meh'-). The Germanic forms would have s mobile and zero grade of the root. Notice that Pokorny classifies CS mYlጀkጀ under 1. mel-, mel፧- ‘zermalmen, schlagen, mahlen, etc.’, while OCS malጀ can be found under m lo-, sm lo- ‘kleines Tier’.

According to van Wijk (1934: 73), *mamiti is the original denominative verb (ፖ *m፹mጀ), while *maniti arose through dissimilation, which was probably favoured by the existence of *man፱ti. Van Wijk’s hypothesis is supported by the fact that there is more or less a geographical distribution. The form *mamiti occurs in West and South Slavic, whereas *maniti occurs in East Slavic and in certain West and South Slavic regions. I consider both the Latvian and the Lithuanian forms to be borrowings from Slavic. Endzel ns is inclined to regard Latv. mãnît as an inherited word.

*màslo

S Bulg. Mára ‘name of a fairy-tale monster’
PIE *meh'-reh'
There are basically two views on the origin of *mara. According to a hypothesis put forward by Franck (1904: 129, against Solmsen 1908: 580-582) and advocated by a.o. Schuster-Šewc (HEW 885ff ), *mara continues PIE *m r and differs from *mora only in having lengthened grade. The alternative etymology, which can at least be traced to Zubatý 1894, connects *mara with the root ma- < *meh'- of *majati, *mamጀ, etc. Though at a first glance it seems unsatisfactory to separate *mara from *mora – in Polish, for instance, mara and mora are synonymous –, it is awkward that in most Slavic languages both apophonic variants would occur side by side. Perhaps we have to start from *mara ‘illusion, apparition’ beside *mora ‘female demon that tortures people with nightmares’, which later became confused. This scenario may also offer an explanation for the fact that the accentual paradigm of both words is so hard to determine. We would expect *màra (a) – in view of Hirt’s law – beside *morà (b) or (c). Nevertheless we find forms like Ru. móra and mará (beside mára). I think that in this respect, too, we have to reckon with analogy.

PIE *meh'tor
While the ESSJa states that *matorጀ is older than *materጀ, the same dictionary considers the o-grade of the suffix in *matorቲnጀ as well as the meaning of this formation (in comparison with materቲnጀ ‘motherly’) to be late. The point is, however, that *matorቲnጀ and *materቲnጀ may not be cognate with *m፸ti at all. Lat. m t rus has been connected with m nus ‘good’, OIr. maith ‘id.’ (Pokorny 693, Ernout–Meillet s.v., Schrijver 1991: 143). In Truba ev’s dictionary, the connection with the latter form is dismissed. Instead, *matorጀ is considered cognate with both *màti and m t rus (with references to Truba ëv 1959: 32 and – incorrectly – Meillet

Ét. II: 407, where merely the connection with m ne and m t rus is considered). Yet another etymology was proposed by Vaillant, who tried to link the Slavic etymon to words meaning ‘big’, such as OPr. muis ‘bigger’ (1961: 189). In my opinion, Lat. m t rus has the best chance of being cognate with *matorጀ etc. (pace Vasmer s.v. matëryj). The connection with *m፸ti cannot be disproved on formal grounds but there are sufficient semantic reasons for keeping this word apart. Athough ultimately we may be dealing with the same root, it is unlikely that *matorጀ is a recent derivative of *m፸ti.

BSl. *moᙑ]B Lith. mᔁžti ‘manure, muck out’; Latv. mêzt ‘muck out, sweep’; muõzêt ‘gobble, pound, fool, harass, beat’
For the time being I have grouped together Slavic *màzati and Lith. mᔁžti ‘manure, muck out’, Latv. mêzt ‘muck out, sweep’ and muõzêt ‘gobble, pound, etc.’ (cf. Oštir 1912: 214, Fraenkel I: 444). It seems to me that the Baltic words can be linked semantically to *màzati ‘smear’ if we start from a meaning ‘smear, wipe, sweep’ (for the semantic development attested in muõzêt, cf. Ru. smázat’ ‘strike a blow’, MoDu. afsmeren (dial.) ‘give s.o. a beating’). Another possibility would be to connect *màzati with Gk. ሲ¶ [ (aor. pass. ሲ Ç «) ‘knead’ (provided that the root is not ሲ instead of ሲ -, which, according to Chantraine (670), cannot be determined), Arm. macanim ‘thicken, stick together’ (Meillet 1916: 122) and OHG mahh n, OS mak n, etc. ‘make’. This would entail a reconstruction *meh'ᘷ- (*maᘷ- in IEW), which would preclude a connection with mᔁžti, Latv. mêzt.

This etymon has often been considered a borrowing from Germanic, but the Slavic short vowel does not match the long vowel of the Germanic forms. The vacillation between *e and *ቲ may be attributed to the raising of pretonic *e in the vicinity of a palatalized consonant (see Kortlandt 1984-1985), but this development seems to have occured prior to Dybo’s law and there is no particular reason to regard *me ቲ as an old oxytone noun.

I feel that we should not attach too much importance to De Vries’s observation that with respect to Germanic it is unwarranted to start from an original meaning ‘Tragkorb aus Fell’ (1962: 382). In fact, the same would apply to the Baltic forms. I consider the semantic similarity between, for instance, Lith. ma§šas ‘ein aus Schnüren gestricktes Heunetz’ (note that the meaning ‘net’ is also attested in Slavic), OIc. heymeiss ‘hay-sack’ and MoE maiz (dial.) ‘large, light hay-basket’ sufficient evidence for the etymological identity of the Germanic and the Balto-Slavic forms. MoIr. moais ‘bag, hamper’, moaiseog ‘wicker basket’ is doubtless a borrowing from Germanic.

The Baltic and Slavic forms are formally compatible with the root *melH- ‘to grind’, the Baltic word showing s mobile. The lengthened grade vowel points to an old root noun. Semantically, this etymology does not seem implausible to me (pace Stang (l.c.), who, by the way, does not mention any Baltic forms).
{1} Judging by the Lithuanian evidence, the zero grade of the root was originally acute: smiltis (LKŽ) 1/3/4 ‘fine sand, gritty earth’. The only non-ambiguous Latvian forms in ME are smìlts and smìltis ‘sand’, however. The most plausible option is that the Latvian falling tone is secondary (cf. Derksen 1996: 147). {2} The Scandinavian forms with sm- could derive from the root melH- ‘grind’ preceded by s mobile. OIc. melr and Sw. mjåg (dial.) < *mjalg are mentioned by Stang in connection with Ru. mel’, etc. (1972: 36). According to Stang, these words point to *melha-/melga-. Therefore the possible etymological relationship with the Slavic forms is limited to the root.

As observed by Fraenkel (I: 460), the problem with the connection with Lith. mìsti ‘feed, live, stay’ is that the acute tone of the root of *mᖃsto is left unexplained. The same holds for the etymology advocating a t-enlargement of Skt. may- ‘fix, build’, mitá- ‘built, established’. To my knowledge, there are no satisfactory alternatives.

Obviously, some forms have been influenced semantically and/or formally by ፖ *m<zdra. The original meaning of the etymon seems to be ‘sap of (trees)’ rather than ‘sap-wood’. The connection with MoHG Maische, MHG meisch, OE m x-wyrt ‘mash (in a brewery)’ is not unattractive, but becomes less plausible if the Germanic word derives from OHG miscen, OE miscian ‘mix’. The ESSJa suggests that the root is *h meiᘷ᎙- (ፖ mižati II, etc.) and adduces Sln. m፧zᑰᐑti ‘trickle’, mᑰᐑžiti se ‘begin to contain sap’. The seemingly obvious semantic link may be secondary, however.

The generally accepted apophonic relationship between Slavic *mogti, Lith. magᔁti, etc., on the one hand and mᔁgti ‘love, like’, Latv. mêgt ‘be able, be accustomed to’ on the other cannot be maintained if one adheres to the view that the lengthened grade yielded a Balto-Slavic circumflex. The acute of the latter verbs may be due to Winter’s law (*h&meᘷ- if cognate with Gk. « ሲ a[ ‘be aggrieved, chafe’). The ovocalism of magᔁti and the Slavic and the Germanic forms points to an old perfect. For the semantic development ‘to be able’ ፖ ‘to like’, cf. Go. mag vs. MoHG mögen. As Pokorny remarks himself, his reconstruction *mag᎙-, m g᎙- is entirely based on the presumed connection of the aforementioned forms with Gk. ሲ 1⁄4 1⁄2 ‘means, instrument’, ሲÇ1⁄4 ‘instrument, apparatus’, Dor. ሲ 1⁄4¶ , ሲÝ1⁄4 , which was rejected by Endzel ns (1931: 183), Fraenkel (1951: 168), Stang (1972: 37) a.o. for various reasons (cf. ESSJa X: 110) but nevertheless reappears in Lehmann 1986 (239).

Traces of AP (b) are sparse in this etymon. Nikolaev (1989: 54, 89) mentions m ót, Gsg. m óta in a archaic dialect of Upper Sorbian, mlát, Isg. mlátom in a grammar of a Posavian variant of Serbo-Croatian, and a number of end-stressed froms from Belorussian and NW Russian dialects. Since there are no neuter variants (cf. ፖ *kóltጀ, where the evidence for AP (b) is much stronger), we might posit an original masculine o-stem, which become mobile as a result of Illi -Svity ’s law. In that case the accentuation of moltìti could simply reflect the original state of affairs.

Pokorny assumes a connection with *mer- ‘aufreiben, reiben; packen, rauben’, which is not entirely convincing. For a discussion of the relationship between *mora and *mara, see s.v. *mara.
{1} The noun also occurs in kikímora m./f. ‘house-sprite that spins at night’. {2} In dialects, we find a variant mora. {3} The folkloristic belief that the mora is an evil female creature (witch, sorceress) is mentioned in Karadži ’s dictionary (cf. the form from Orb.). {4} There is a variant mᎅra ‘nightmare, house-spirit, creature that at night suffocates people in their sleep and harms animals’ (Slovar slovenskega knjižnega jezika II: 238.

I agree with Mayrhofer (EWAia s.v. meghá-) that we must in principle distinguish PIE. *h meiᘷ᎙- and *h meig᎙- (cf. Kern 1894: 106). The former root is present in Lith. mᑳžti, Latv. mìzt ‘urinate’, and is, in my opinion, sparsely attested in Slavic. On account of their semantic similarity, the above-mentioned Slavic verbs meaning ‘drizzle’ are sometimes connected with mᑳžti, etc. I think that the Slavic etyma listed above show that verbs like *mቲžiti are best grouped together with *mቲglà. A more complicated issue is the relationship between words meaning ‘mist, drizzle’ (*meig᎙B ‘dunkel vor den Augen werden, Nebel, Wolke’ in Pokorny) and words meaning ‘blink, twinkle’ (*meig᎙- A ‘flimmern, blinzeln, mic#re’), which I discuss s.v. mᎃgጀ. Since there is no obvious semantic link between these groups, the ESSJa basically tries to keep them apart, e.g. *mቲžiti I ‘blink, twinkle’ vs. *mቲžiti II ‘drizzle’ (but Ru.(dial.) mža ‘doze; drizzle; said about smth. which vanished rapidly’ without further distinctions). It is not entirely clear how the meanings ‘doze, drowsiness’ and ‘swarm (with)’ fit in. LSrb. migoriZ se ‘move to and fro, swarm with, drizzle’ (Schuster-Šewc 907) is matched by MoDu. miggelen, miegelen (dial.) ‘drizzle, swarm with.’ Ru. mžit’ (dial.) ‘doze, be delirious’ is mentioned by the ESSJa s.v. *mቲžiti I, but a connection with *mቲžiti I cannot be excluded, cf. SCr. míždati ‘drizzle, doze’, MoHG drisseln ‘drizzle, doze’, drusen ‘doze’, drussig ‘clouded’, Lith. blañdas ‘sleepiness; cloudiness’ (cf. Merkulova 1975: 59). Discussing the origin of the meaning ‘doze’ is essentially the same as establishing the semantic connection between Slavic *mቲgand Lith. miᑱgas ‘sleep’, mìgt ‘sleep, fall asleep’, miegóti ‘sleep’, etc. Fraenkel (I 447) considers the meaning of miegóti to have evolved from ‘close one’s eyes’ (cf. Kern 1894: 109). This seems plausible indeed. On the other hand, there are parallels for a connection between ‘sleep’ and ‘cloud’, e.g. Av. snaoÇa- ‘cloud’ vs. Lith. snáusti ‘doze’ or OIr. nél ‘cloud; swoon, faintness, stupor’ (cf. Merkulova 1975: 58-59). As long as there is no evidence for a formal distinction between the roots of *mቲglà and *mᎃgጀ, I think that we must start from a single root *h meig᎙-.
{1} Illi -Svity lists a number of SCr. dialect forms which point to AP (b) (1963: §40). The standard language has secondary mobility in this word. {2} It cannot be excluded that miggelen is cognate with MDu. miegen ‘urinate’.

BSl. *n w(ᙑ)B Lith. nõvyti, nóvyti (OLith., dial.) ‘kill, torment’; Latv. nâvît ‘kill, destroy’; nâvîtiês ‘exhaust oneself, toil’
Like the Baltic verbs, *naviti may derive from a noun with lengthened grade (ፖ *navቲ). The ESSJa is probably right in suggesting a connection with ፖ *nyti, *nùditi, etc. Note that *nùditi, *n፱ᐐditi is also attested with the meaning ‘exhaust, torment’.

In view of the Baltic evidence, the root must probably be reconstructed as *n uH-, with the Latvian broken tone reflecting the root-final laryngeal. If the root was *noHu-, we would expect to find fixed root stress on an acute syllable.

It seems to me quite natural to connect this compound with ፖ *d<glጀ ‘healthy, strong’, etc., which has an acute root. The ESSJa suggests that the (various) roots *d፱ž- and *dug- may have become mixed up, cf. ፖ *dužቲ.

What makes this etymon interesting, is the fact that it may contain *neto- < *nekᐁto‘night’, with e-grade as in Hitt. nekuz ‘at night’. Vaillant (Gr. I: 83, IV: 655) reconstructs original o-grade, however. The second element is often interpreted as *pyrቲ ‘flier’, with a lengthened zero grade (ፖ *pariti, *pቲrati). A reanalysis *ne-topyrቲ seems only possible for East Slavic (Ru. ne ‘not’, topýrit’ ‘bristle’). According to Vaillant (l.c.), *pyrቲ has replaced original *pirቲ under the influence of the suffix *-yrቲ, which originated in borrowings from Greek (cf. Ru. psaltýr’).

It is clear that this compound must be analyzed as *ne + *vodጀ. According to Vasmer (s.v. névod), the negation is motivated by reasons of taboo. The root may be identified as the o-grade of *ued᎙- ‘lead’ (ፖ *vestì), but on the other hand the attempts to connect the Germanic forms with *uh'd᎙- ‘wade’, cf. OHG watan



*neže
352
‘advance, wade’, Lat. vad ‘wade’, v d ‘go, walk’ must be taken seriously in view of parallels such as Ru. bréden’ ‘a kind of dragnet’. It is not attractive, however, to separate the Balto-Slavic forms from their Germanic synonyms (the connection with ‘wade’ is formally impossible for Balto-Slavic) and a borrowing from Germanic into Baltic and Slavic does not seem very likely.

If this etymon is to be connected with Gk. « f. ‘fallow-land’, the g- of the SCr. and Sln. dialect forms, which could account for the sequence nji, must be secondary.

Formally, *nùditi matches Lith. naudóti ‘use’, Go. niutan ‘attain’, in which case the acute of the root could be attributed to Winter’s law. Semantically, the etymology fails to convince, however. More attractive is the connection with OPr. nautin Asg., nautins Apl. ‘need’, Go. noþs f., OHG n t m./f. ‘need, force’, which may contain a suffix *-ti-. (cf. IEW: 1351). Besides *nùditi, *n፱ᐐditi, we also find ፖ *nutiti (*n፱titi) and ፖ *nukati (*n፱kati). We may posit a root *neuH- (cf. ፖ *nyti) with various enlargements (as well as secondary nasalization), but it can hardly be excluded that *neuH- is itself an enlargement, the other root variants being enlargements of *neu-. The accentual evidence is not always unequivocal and besides the verbs may have influenced each other.

According to Kortlandt (1979: 60-61, 1988: 388-389, cf. Hamp 1970a), *og_ቲ reflects a Balto-Slavic noun *ungnis, where *-ngn- blocked the operation of Winter’s law (cf. Thurneysen 1883). The sequence *un was lowered to *on before a tautosyllabic stop, with subsequent loss of the nasal as a result of dissimilation (ፖ *vodà). Apparently, the latter development occurred in Baltic as well. The expected reflex of Winter’s law is found in ፖ *v+gጀ_ቲ, v+gጀ_a.

If the PSl. reconstruction *olb- is correct, the fact that the root shape *lab- occurs outside South Slavic and Central Slovak suggests that we are dealing with an originally acute root (cf. Meillet 1934: 83), which would be in conflict with the



*olbodà; *elbedà
366
traditional etymology that the etymon derives from a root *h'elb᎙- ‘white’. Unless one adheres to the view that a lengthened grade yields an acute in Balto-Slavic, a reconstruction *h'l b᎙- (with Schwebeablaut) does not solve the problem. Apart from the etymology, the distribution of the reflexes *la- and *lo- needs to be explained. It is possible to argue that the reflex *le- in Ru. lébed’ (perhaps from *lobefore a soft labial, cf. tebe < tobY) continues the short reflex of *ol- in the oxytone forms of a mobile paradigm, but there is no such explanation for the West Slavic forms. Kortlandt (2005: 128) makes an attempt to account for the facts while starting from the hypothesis that the etymon originally belonged to AP (a) and only became mobile after the rise of distinctive tone and the South Slavic lengthening of initial vowels before tautosyllabic resonants.

The anlaut of dialect forms such as Pl. ab d] or SCr. laboda must be analogous after the words for ‘swan’. The reconstruction *olboda is not without problems in view of the consistent reflex *lo- in South Slavic (but cf. SCr. rᎄb ‘slave’?), which also does not match the *la- of the ‘swan’ word. We must seriously consider the possibility that the proto-form was *h'lob-oda (*h'leb-eda) (for further discussion see s.v. *olb፱dቲ).

In my view, the reconstruction * lk- < *h&eh&olk- (Rasmussen 1999: 199) cannot account for the acute tone of the root. For this reason I reconstruct *h&olHk-. The colour of the initial laryngeal is based on OIc. illr < *elhila-. The connection with the latter adjective is not beyond doubt, however, so that we might reconstruct *h' or *h . The verbal root is limited to Balto-Slavic.
{1} According to the Staroslavjanskij slovar’, the ratio between alጀk- (including a ̄k- and alk-) and lak- is 19 : 9, respectively. Zogr. (1 : 4), Mar. (3 : 1) and Ass. (3 : 1) have both variants.

Forms with *( j)e- are limited to Bulgarian, e.g. MBulg. jelovo, Bulg. élavo (dial.). In Russian dialects, we find a form lov’ (Voronež), which may reflect *olvቲ. The fact that we do not have *lavቲ < *olHvi-, as we might have expected on the basis of the Baltic forms, can be explained by assuming that the laryngeal was eliminated according to Meillet’s law before the metathesis of liquids. Pokorny derives the Balto-Slavic word for ‘tin, lead’ from *al(፧)- ‘white’. This more or less presupposes that the original meaning was ‘tin’ (plumbum album) rather than ‘lead’ (plumbum nigrum). In view of both the formal problems and the sphere to which this word belongs it seems preferable to regard it as a borrowing from an unknown language.
{1} It is unclear to me on what grounds the LKŽ assigns AP 1 to this word. To my knowledge, the only accented form is á wu Isg. (DK), which points to AP 1 or 3. The Modern Lithuanian form ãlavas is a borrowing from Slavic.

As Schrijver observes (1991: 40), this etymon presents two problems. The first problem is the anlaut. The Slavic forms with je- cannot be explained away by assuming analogy after the word for ‘spruce’: je- also occurs in West Slavic, where ‘spruce’ is jedl-, not jel- (pace Kortlandt apud Schrijver: o.c. 41). The a- : e- variation in Germanic suggests that the variation in Baltic and Slavic does not result from “Rozwadowski’s change” alone (cf. Andersen 1996: 130). The second problem is the alternation between i and zero in the second syllable. It is true that the *i and *u (cf. the Latvian toponym Aluksne?) of the Germanic forms may continue the regular ablaut of an s-stem (Schrijver: l.c.), but the fact that we find *i of in Slavic and East Lithuanian as well indicates that it should be taken at face value. The abovementioned peculiarities of the etymon strongly suggest that we are dealing with a word of non-Indo-European origin. The fact that there are North Slavic forms with s alongside the expected x must be connected with the Baltic presence in the area (cf. Anikin 2005: 85-86).
{1} In Russian dialects there are apparently also forms with a vocalized medial jer, e.g. elóxa (Kostr.), alëx (Voron.), olëx (Rjaz.) ‘alder’ (cf. Popowska-Taborska 1984: 39). {2} The form with e- is actually reflected as àlksna (Bersohn, E. Latvia) (M-E: s.v.). {3} From *aluz- and *elustr (< *elastr ?), respectively.

The quantitative variation in the second syllable reflects accentual mobility, as pretonic long vowels were shortened but posttonic long vowels were not. The laryngeal of the second syllable had been lost with compensatory lengthening at an earlier stage.

Unlike the ESSJa, I think that an etymological relationship with Germanic forms such as Go. arbaiþs f. ‘labour’ and OIc. erfiði n. ‘id.’ is highly plausible. These forms are possibly cognate with Gk. » ‘orphan’, Lat. orbus ‘deprived of, orphan’ from a root *h erb᎙-. The South Slavic variants reflecting *robጀ, with unexpected *rob- < *orb-, must be borrowings from West (or East) Slavic.

In Balto-Slavic, zero grade of the root (cf. Lith. ìrklas ‘oar’) was apparently replaced by full grade after the verb ‘to plough’. The fixed stress on the root must result from Hirt’s law. OCS oralo (Ass.) is clearly analogical after orati.

The literal meaning of OCS oriti, which in Supr. 510,8 translates Gk. a « , is apparently ‘drag down’. The ESSJa (s.v. *oriti II) connects oriti in this particular meaning with SCr. òriti se, Sln. oriti se ‘resound’ as well as with Lat. or re ‘speak’. I am inclined to consider the reconstruction of a second etymon *oriti unnecessary.

I assume that the root-final laryngeal (see ፖ *oràti, *òrdlo) had been lost in pretonic position before the word-initial metathesis of liquids. The fact that we find no lengthening is also connected with non-initial stress.

The Lithuanian variant arᑱlis is limited to the area where e- becomes a- (B ga RR II: 508). The East Baltic forms therefore all have initial *e-. Since this is unexpected, these forms may be labelled as an example of “Rozwadowski’s change”.

If this etymon is to be identified with ፖ *arቲᐐmጀ, *arቲmò, the root vocalism may be attributed to the influence of ፖ *oràti ‘plough’. Note, however, that the long vowel of *arቲmጀ/o is unclear.

In his list of laryngealized roots in Slavic, Kortlandt (1975a: 63) groups the abovementioned Slavic and Baltic together, which since a publication by Zubatý is not uncommon.

The obvious connection with forms containing a root *pol- (e.g. ፖ *polìca) forces us to reconstruct a lengthened grade *p l- for *palica. This is not in agreement with the accentual evidence, however. The etymology of the root is unclear.

If there is a connection with Gk. ሲ ሲ« ‘kindle, burn, blow’, which continues a root *preh&-, we must assume Schwebeablaut. Furthermore, the acute must have been adopted from forms where the laryngeal was preserved. It might be better to seek a connection with ፖ *pariti, even though this root is generally considered to have no laryngeal. As in other cases, (Balto-)Slavic may have a secondary *H.

It seems that Balto-Slavic offers evidence for both *pleh u- and *pleu- (cf. Derksen 1996: 116-117). LIV (485, 487) distinguishes between *pleh - and *pleu-, while entertaining the possibility of a *uᐵe-present for the former root. Balto-Slavic *pleh umay be a conflation of these two roots. The existence of an acute root *pl( j)ouᙑd- < *pleud-, cf. Lith. pláusti ‘wash, bathe’ (alongside pláuti), OIc. fljóta ‘flow’, may have added to the confusion.

In view of the Sanskrit and Old Prussian evidence I am inclined to posit a BaltoSlavic oxytone neuter o-stem. I suspect that the Nsg. in *-o was replaced by *-ጀ at a stage when barytone masculine o-stems continuing old neuters still had a NApl. in *-aH and may have shown neuter agreement (see Derksen forthc. a).

He derives OIc. rámr ‘hoarse’ from *Hreh&-mo- and OIc. róᐑmr from *Hreh&-mo. LIV (l.c.), however, claims that Rasmussen is right in deriving the Old Icelandic forms a root *rem-.

The fact that there are no South Slavic forms pointing to *rY- may, for instance, be considered a counter-argument (but cf. OCS retቲ). More importantly, *arቲmጀ/o is usually derived from PIE *h'er-, which seems incompatible with *remy. On the other hand, the relationship with MHG rieme m. ‘strap, belt’, the etymology of which is unknown, is also unclear.

CS OCS sYšti (Euch., Supr.) ‘cut’, 1sg. sYk፱ (the attested forms are sYky Nsg. m. ptc. pres. act. (Euch.) and sY ete 2pl. (Supr.))

It is hardly imaginable that *sYkti is not cognate with Lat. sec ‘cut, mow’. The acute root cannot be reconciled with the root variant *sek-, however. LIV (524) predictably reconstructs an acrodynamic present to account for the Slavic length, which in their framework yields the desired acute. Kortlandt claims that “*sYkti adopted the long root vowel for disambiguation from the root which is preserved in Lith. sèkti ‘watch, follow’ and Slavic so iti ‘indicate, pursue’” (1997a: 28). The original short vowel is attested in OCS sekyra ‘axe’.

If one does not wish to posit PIE *seH- alongside *sei- (Insler 1971: 581 ff ), Lith. siᑱti, Latv. sìet ‘tie’ must reflect *sHei- (Schrijver 1991: 519) or rather *sh'ei- (LIV: 544).On the basis of Hitt. išᑅamin- c. ‘cord’ alongside išᑅ i, 3pl. išᑅiianzi ‘bind, wrap’, Kloekhorst (2008: 393) has argued that we must reconstruct PIE *seh'- and *sh'-(o)i-. This seems to be a satisfactory solution. Baltic forms with e-vocalism, e.g. Lith. sᑱja (dial.) ‘ties’ can easily be analogical. On the other hand, we may wonder wat the fate of *sh'-oi- would be in Balto-Slavic. It is possible that *sh'-oi- > would develop into a root *soi-, which could have given to rise to new apophonic grades *sei- and *si-. The root of *sYtቲ seems to be acute, however. Perhaps the zero grade *sh'i-provided the basis for a new full grade *soh'i (after all, *Ce/oHI : *CHI is a common type of ablaut) or the word for ‘net’ was influenced by the verbal root *seᙑi- ‘sieve’. The semantic connection is obvious.

The fixed root stress originates from Hirt’s law. The original form must have been *seh&i-tó(d ). The Latvian broken tone is explained by the fact that barytone neuter ostems with an acute root became mobile in Latvian (see Derksen 1995).

A reconstruction *sh'i-tóm (cf. ፖ *s dlò) seems possible, as there are indications that neuters in *-tò were productive anterior to the loss of the laryngeals in pretonic syllables, but we would have to assume that *-to was replaced by *-tጀ. This is not unprecedented in original neuters, however. Alternatively, we may posit a secondary e-grade *seitom (see ፖ *sYtቲ), cf the (rare) Lithuanian variant se§tas 2.

Though Latv. slãbs matches the Slavic etymon perfectly, I am inclined to regard the Baltic forms as borrowings (cf. Derksen 1996: 83).

Since he also claims that Winter’s law applied exclusively to the

The root-final laryngeal reflected in Baltic as well as Slavic is a Balto-Slavic innovation. We must assume an original root noun with lengthened grade.

For the root we may perhaps compare Lat. l v re ‘be livid, bluish’, OIr. lí ‘colour, pallor’. In that case the reconstruction would be *(s)liH-uᐵ-. Lith. slyvà 2 and slᑳvas (dial.) ‘plum, plum-tree’ are borrowings from Slavic.

I have no explanation for the tonal difference between Slavic and the Latvian form (see Derksen 1996: 137 for a the complete Baltic material). In my dissertation I opted for a root *slonHk-, even considering to give up the connection with Lith. sliñkti ‘sneak, crawl’, Latv. slìkt ‘lean over, be submerged, drown’. The snipe, however, is an extremely elusive bird and a name corresponding to OHG slango m. ‘snake’ would be entirely appropriate. I also failed to point out that Lith. slánka may very well show métatonie rude, cf. pe ialìnda, pe ialánda ‘leaf-warbler’, from pᑱ ius ‘oven’ and lᔀsti ‘crawl’. The root is therefore to be reconstructed *slenkᐁ- and the Slavic acute must be regarded as irregular.

Slavic *s- < *Z- was adopted from forms with e-grade. The acute of Lith. kláusti may originate from a desiderative *ᑆleu-Hs-. The question is if this is also the origin of the acute tone of *slùšati. As we have seen s.v. ፖ *slàva, the presence of a laryngeal is not limited to the root variant with *-s, at least not in Slavic.

To explain the prosodic characteristics of the noun one could posit a seᑥ variant *d᎙orH- (cf.

Since a proto-form *teh'i-s-tóm would yield fixed stress on an acute syllable in BaltoSlavic, we may consider *th'ei-s-tóm. It is unclear to me why the etymon ended up as a mobile o-stem, however. Originally oxytone neuter o-stems with a first syllable closed by an obstruent typically belong to AP (b). I suspect that the suffix *-to is secondary.

Cogn. Skt. ucyati ‘be accustomed to’ (*h&uk-); Go. biuhts adj. ‘accustomed to’ (*h&euk-)
The main problem with this etymology is the Balto-Slavic evidence for an acute. Kortlandt (1977b: 38) claims that initial *u yielded PSl. acute *vy- under the stress



*ujᆑ 507
and *vጀ- pretonically. The East Baltic reflexes under the stress are Lith. ᔆ and surprisingly – Latv. û. Since we have ፖ*v+kn፱ti (a), it is possible to assume that the zero grade *uᙑ- provided the basis for full grades *ouᙑk- (<< *ouk- < *h&ouk-) and *jouᙑk- (<< *jouk- < *h&euk-). We must keep in mind, however, that Winter’s law has significantly reduced the evidence for the development proposed by Kortlandt. Note that the j- of the Baltic forms must be secondary.

*u ᆑjᆑ adj. jo ‘better’
CS OCS un’ii ‘better’, n. unje; unYi ‘better’, n. unYje; RuCS unje Nsg. n. ‘better’
Etymology obscure. Semantically, the connection with Skt. vanóti ‘defeat, conquer’ is not unattractive, but we would have to assume Schwebeablaut. If the adjective contains an n-suffix, the root *h&euH- of Skt. ávati ‘help, protect’ is a candidate (cf. Meillet Ét. II: 435),
* slò(?) n. o (b) ‘woven fabric on a loom’
E Ru. usló (Kostrom.) ‘woven fabric on a loom’ {1}
The most plausible etymology for this obscure form involves a connection with Lith. áusti (1sg. áudžiu) ‘weave’. Vasmer (s.v.) reconstructs the suffix as *-slo, but I find *-tlo more attractive. In this case, the correspondence between AP (b) in Slavic and an acute root in Baltic would not pose a problem because the glottal stop originating from Winter’s law would be lost in pretonic position (see Derksen 1996: 105-111).
{1} As far as I know, this form has only been recorded by Dal’, who adds a question mark. The word is illustrated by the sentence ᅣᅲለᅩᆑ ሦᄦᅩᅅᅲለ ᅧᆅᅩለ? ‘ሄሗለᅢለ ᅩᅅ ሗሓሂᅲሓᅩሓ?’ See also Eckert 1970.

PIE *Hous-t- (h'/ eus-t-?)

The vocalism of the East Baltic forms may have been adopted from *h oh&-(e/o)s‘mouth’, cf. Lat. stium ‘mouth of a river’ (EIEC 387, Derksen 2002: 40-41).

PIE *h'eus-rom
Cogn. Gk. « adv. ‘tomorrow’; Lat. auster m. ‘south wind’; OIc. austr m. ‘East’
The traces of s in this etymon are too many to be ignored. It must be admitted, however, that the loss of s in PSl. *justro is irregular. According to Nieminen (1956), the s was lost as a result of dissimilation in syntagms such as *za ustra and *sጀ ustra.



*vabiti 511
The main problem of the etymology *h'eus-ro- is not the absence of s but the PSl. acute intonation of the root. I suspect that we are dealing with an instance of contamination here, but for the time being a proper candidate seems to be lacking. Here Kortlandt’s theory that *(H )u- yielded *uᙑ- comes to mind. The zero grade rom which the acute would have spread is not attested, however.
{1} In the Psalterium Sinaiticum there is a single occurrence of zaustra ‘in the morning’. In view of Bulg. zástra, Mcd. dzástra, this is unlikely to be a writing error. {2} In Old Polish we find such forms as justrzejszy ‘tomorrow’s’, justrzenka ‘dawn’.

Cogn. Go. wopjan ‘call out’; OHG wuoffen ‘bewail’; wuofen ‘whine’; OE w pan ‘weep’
The West and South Slavic evidence points to AP (b) and therefore to lengthened grade of the root, in which case we may reconstruct *u b- (with loss of *ᕒ after a long vowel in BSl. *u ᙑb- from Winter’s law?). If the East Slavic accentuation is old, however, the root may have been *ueh'b- or *ueh b-.

B Lith. vadìnti ‘call’
Cogn. Skt. vádati ‘speak, talk’; Hitt. uᐵ tarnahh- ‘order, instruct’
If we derive *vaditi from *h'uedh' (cf. Skt. vadᙃ ‘speak, talk’), the *a can be attributed to Winter’s law. This would rule out a connection with Lith. vadìnti ‘call’, which is best derived from *ued᎙- ‘lead’, cf. Latv. vadinât ‘lead, accompany, urge, lure’, vedinât ‘urge, lure’ (cf. Trautmann 1923a: 337, B ga RR II: 642). It seems to me that Ru. vádit’ (Novg.) ‘lure, spend (time), deceive’ cannot be separated from vodít’ ‘lead’ (Baltic influence?) and therefore does not belong to our etymon *vaditi.

The etymological relationship with the Greek forms is not without problems, however, cf. the existence of a variant ] . The only other suggested cognates outside Balto-Slavic are a limited number of forms from Avestan (see LIV: l.c.). I conclude that the Indo-European background of our Balto-Slavic root is far from solid.

There are basically two etymologies for this noun. According to, among others, Meillet (Ét. II: 407-408) and Vasmer (s.v. vedró), *vYdrò derives from the root of *uod-r/n- ‘water’ (ፖ *vodà), cf. Gk. ‘water-pot, pitcher, vessel’. The other option is to connect the word for ‘bucket’ with forms meaning ‘womb, belly’. The former etymology offers a much better explanation for the full grade of the Balto-Slavic



*vᑐno 519
forms. In both cases the long vowel of the root can be attributed to Winter’s law, which at first sight is incompatible with AP (b). In my framework, however, it is possible to assume that in Proto-Slavic the reflex of the laryngeal was lost in pretonic position (the sequence -dr- prevented the Balto-Slavic retraction of the stress from final open syllables). The remaining problem is the fact that the evidence points almost exclusively to a short root vowel, as words of the aforementioned type as a rule appear to have escaped the pretonic shortening that took place before Dybo’s law.

The origin of *vodà is the heteroclitic noun *uod-r/n- ‘water’. The fact that the etymon was not affected by Winter’s law calls for an explanation. Kortlandt (1979: 60-61, cf. 1988: 388-389) claims that the vocalism of *voda continues the Gsg. *(v)undnes of a Balto-Slavic noun *vond r, with a nasal infix originating from a suffix, as in Lat. unda (cf. Thurneysen 1883). The sequence *ndn blocked Winter’s law (cf. the regular acute in Lith. vanduõ). The vocalism *vod- arose in Proto-Slavic when *un was lowered before a tautosyllabic stop, which development was followed by the dissimilatory loss of the *n (cf. ፖ *og_ቲ).

*vòrna
528
Cogn. Go. wrikan ‘persecute’
The reconstruction of an initial laryngeal hinges on Gk. [ ‘shut in, shut out’, which may or may not be cognate (cf. Derksen 1996: 73-74). I now believe that the Baltic o-stem substantive mentioned above was an end-stressed neuter at the time when the East Baltic retraction of the stress from word-final *-a operated, causing metatony. The Slavic form, which obviously was not neuter, cannot be regarded as a barytone masculine o-stem that became mobile as a result of Illi -Svity ’s law because the root was originally acute (this is a correction to o.c.: 74). It is therefore an original mobile noun that underwent Meillet’s law. The acute originates from Winter’s law.

BSl. *wórᙑnaᙑ
B Lith. várna; Latv. vãrna OPr. warne
This is a perennial example of Balto-Slavic métatonie rude resulting from vrኗddhi (e.g. Pedersen 1933: 55). Kortlandt (1985b: 121) draws a comparison with Gk. : and Lat. corvus : corn x (both ‘raven’ : ‘crow’) and assumes that in BaltoSlavic the root *kor- ‘burn’ was replaced with the synonymous *wor-. The metatony is attributed to the fact that the suffix of *wor-ᙑn-aᙑ ‘crow’ contained a laryngeal, while the word for ‘raven’ originally had a suffix *-wos. This ingenious explanation has met with scepticism because of its ad hoc character. I would argue, however, that a unique case of Balto-Slavic metatony calls for a unique explanation.

There are basically two views on the origin of *vጀ(n). It is either regarded as zero grade or as an o-grade of PIE *h&en ‘in’. In the latter case, the development to *vጀ(n) must have occurred in word-final position. I prefer the hypothesis that *vጀ(n) is to be identified with Lith. < *h&nᐩ.

The root *vyg- reflects *unᙑg < *h&ngᐁ-. Here Winter’s law was not blocked by a cluster *ngn, nor was the root affected by lowering (ፖ òg_ቲ, *፱ᐐglቲ). There is no reason to assume that the initial *v is the preposotion ‘in’, cf. *v+dra.

The root is usually reconstructed as * ps-, cf. Gk. ° ‘high’. Kortlandt (1977b) has argued that in Balto-Slavic initial *u yielded acute “long” *u (Lith. ᔆ, PSl. *vy) under the stress and short *u in pretonic position. The acute variant is supposed to have originated from a Balto-Slavic prothetic laryngeal. The Slavic situation regarding initial *u undeniably resembles the situation regarding initial *i, where I have claimed (2003) that stressed *i- yielded *( j)i under the stress, but *jቲ in unstressed position. In my opinion, it is likely that the reflex *vy- originated in stressed position, cf. v+sቲ and the comparative v+še.

According to Kortlandt (1997: 161), this etymon continues a hysterodynamic uh'stem (see also Beekes 1992: 184). In his view, the e-grade of the Asg. must have spread to the Nsg. at an early stage of Balto-Slavic, i.e. before the development *eu > *ou before a vowel, because otherwise the medial front vowel of OPr. widdew is hard to explain. For the initial laryngeal, cf. also Lubotsky 1994, where it is argued that the adjective on which the word for ‘widow’ is based ultimately goes back to *dui-d᎙h&-u.

The oxytone accentuation of the Balto-Slavic form hinges on the absence of Lithuanian forms belonging to AP (2), the Slavic evidence being inconclusive due to the generalization of accentual mobility in masculine o-stems. The evidence from other branches of Indo-European points to an original barytone.

BSl. *wiᑣos B Lith. vìsas; Latv. viss OPr. wissa
PIE *uisoCogn. Skt. víᑣu- ‘in all directions’ (only in compounds)
The origin of this etymon may be a Lpl. *uiᑣu. In Lithuanian, the š < *ᑣ may have been replaced with s when the variant -su of the Lpl. was generalized (F. Kortlandt, p.c.). Slavic generalized the ending -xጀ < *-ᑣu in the Lpl., which is why the pronoun has *Z < *x as a result of the progressive palatalization. In North Russian, we still find forms with x (cf. Vermeer 2000: passim).

Compound of *za- and a derivative in *-dlo < *d᎙lom (ፖ *borti). Cz. zábradlí, Slk. zábradlie ‘railing, balustrade’, derives from *bቲrati ‘take’. The East Slavic forms containing -ra- are obviously of Church Slavic origin.

The question is if this root is to be identified with the root of ፖ *g_ìti ‘rot’ and ፖ gnᎅjቲ ‘pus, manure’. Semantically the connection does not seem implausible to me, while the variation gn- : zn- may originally have been conditioned by the following vowel.

A connection with the root *ᘷomb᎙- of PSl. *z፱bጀ, Latv. zùobs ‘tooth’ cannot be ruled out, but it is possible that we are dealing with a migratory term, cf. Osset. dombaj ‘bison’.

The problem connected with the reconstruction presented above is the fact that Hirt’s law apparently did not operate. Kortlandt (1975a: 54) assumes lengthened grade for this etymon, suggesting that the Baltic acute may be an instance of metatony resulting from a retraction of the stress in a form corresponding to Gk. . I find that hard to believe, in particular because the Latvian form has a broken tone, which in Kortlandt’s theory is the reflex of an unstressed acute. Perhaps one might combine the reconstruction of a lengthened grade as well as a laryngeal and assume loss of the laryngeal in a monosylabic form.*ᘷ᎙u h&r. The forms with an acute root may reflect the ful grade of other case-forms.

Pokorny (IEW: 491) recontructs the root as *ᘷ᎙uᐵon-, cf. Alb. zë m. ‘sound’, Arm jain ‘id.’. The hypothesis that Slavic *zvᎅnጀ continues PIE *suonh - (e.g. Meilet 1934: 30), cf. Lat. sonus ‘sound’. must be considered a serious alternative, however. The anlaut may have been influenced by ፖ *zጀvati.

Cogn. OHG kegil m. ‘nail, peg’
The connection with OHG kegil ‘nail, peg’, etc., which would point to *geᘷ᎙-l- is uncertain. The variant with *ቲ results from raising of *e in a pretonic syllable in a palatal environment, which occurred prior to Dybo’s law (Kortlandt 1984-1985). The



*ž ኃdàti
560
noun was oxytone due to the fact that it had escaped Ebeling’s law, which states that the stress was not retracted from open final sylables to a syllable closed by an obstruent (Derksen forthc. a).

In view of the Old Prussian and Welsh forms (note that in this case the vocalism of Old Prussian forms cannot reflect * because <ei> is also found in the vocabularies), we must reconstruct *e-grade. Since in an o-stem neuter fixed root stress must result from Hirt’s law, we are confronted with the problem that *gᐁeHi-to- is impossible because of the o-colouring laryngeal of the root for ‘live’ (see also Derksen 1996: 117). If we wish to maintain e-grade, there are several options. First, we may reconstruct a full grade *gᐁeih -to- based on a metathesized variant of the root (cf. ፖ *gojiti). Second, we may assume that the full grade was created after the Balto-Slavic the merger of the laryngeals, thus abandoning the direct connection with Welsh. Third, the root may be considered to be a variant with *h&, for which there is evidence in Greek (cf. Beekes 1969: 248-249).

PIE *g᎙euro
Cogn. Skt. ghorá- (RV+) ‘terrible, terrifying’; Go. gaurs ‘sad’ (both with o-grade)
According to Young (2002: 111-114), the West Slavic forms continue a denominative verb based on an unattested adjective corresponding to Lith. žiaurùs ‘cruel, savage’, which he assumes to have the same root as Lith. žvFrìs ‘wild animal’ (*ᘷ᎙euh&r-?). Like Vasmer and others, he connects the East and South Slavic forms with Skt. ghorá‘terrible, terrifying’ and Go. gaurs ‘sad’. Since the meaning of the West Slavic forms may have been influenced by German sauer ‘sour, angry’ (perhaps through association with West Slavic *žurጀ ‘sour mass used for soup or bread’, which is regarded as a borrowing), I wonder if it is necessary to assume a different origin for the West Slavic forms on the one hand and the East and South Slavic forms on the other.
{1} With dissimilation of *žu - to zu - in Czech (Machek 1971: s.v.). The Slovak form may be a borrowing from Czech.

While ፖ *zelenጀ ‘green’ has *z- < *ᘷ-, *žቲltጀ has *ž < *g- as a result of the first palatalization. The depalatalized velar must originate from the zero grade, where it was followed by a syllabic resonant. This suggests that the e-vocalism of the East Baltic forms is secondary (Kortlandt 1978b: 240).
